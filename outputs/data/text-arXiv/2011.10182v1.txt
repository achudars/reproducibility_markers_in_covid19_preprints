Abstract—The COVID-19 pandemic has depressed overall
mobility across the country. The changes seen reflect responses
to new COVID-19 cases, local health guidelines, and seasonality,
making the relationship between mobility and COVID-19 unique
from region to region. This paper presents a data-driven case
study of electric vehicle (EV) charging and mobility in the wake
of COVID-19. The study shows that the number of EV charging
sessions and total energy consumed per day dropped by 40%
immediately after the arrival of the first COVID-19 case in Utah.
By contrast, the energy consumed per charging session fell by just
8% over the same periods and the distribution of session start
and end times remained consistent throughout the year. While EV
mobility dropped more dramatically than total vehicle mobility
during the first wave of COVID-19 cases, and returned more
slowly, both returned to stable levels near their mean values by
September 2020, despite a dramatic third wave in new infections.
Index Terms—COVID-19, electric vehicles, mobility.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Nearly one year after the first case of COVID-19 was
reported in the United States on January 20th, 2020, mobility
remains depressed as travelers seek to avoid the risk of
COVID-19 transmission. Nationally, visits to retail and recreation, transit stations, and workplaces remain 14%, 32%, and
30% below baseline, respectively [1]. Mobility and COVID19 transmission are positively correlated across the country,
but changes in infections lag those in mobility by up to three
weeks [2]. This lag challenges effective policy development
to curb the COVID-19 transmission.
In response to COVID-19 precautions and stay-at-home
recommendations from health experts, corporations and their
employees have embraced work-from-home opportunities.
Seventy-seven percent of employees now work from home
as compared to just 9% prior to the COVID-19 outbreak [3].
This shift reflects a 68% increase in employees who now work
from home 5 days per week. As more employees work from
home fewer get into vehicles for their daily work commutes,
which comprise 682 billion, or 28%, of annual vehicle miles
traveled in the U.S. [4].
The overall decline in mobility offers an opportunity to
explore how this shift manifests in electric vehicles (EVs)
as distinct from internal combustion engine vehicles (ICVs).
Public transportation, which may expose users to other people,
exhibits decreases in utilization that exceed the drop in mobility broadly. New York City, one of the most transit-dense

cities in the country, observed a 92% decrease in public transit
ridership during the heart of the infection wave in April 2020
[5]. Ride-hailing trips from Transportation Network Providers
such as Uber and Lyft decreased by up to 80% in the spring
of 2020 when compared to the same period in 2019 [6]. In
some instances public transit, car pooling, and micro-mobility
providers have limited or suspended service. These shared
transit modes were, and continue to be, supplanted by private
car travel.
Although the private (or personal-use) car market is dominated by ICVs, EVs represent an increasing share. This paper
explores how private car travel has changed between these
two vehicle classes in response to COVID-19. Additionally,
this work explores how EV charging behaviors and energy
demands have changed since the onset of the pandemic.
Typically, EV driving patterns differ slightly from ICV driving
patterns due to their relatively limited range, sparseness of
charging stations, and time required to recharge. Industry,
utility, and local government stakeholders across the country
recognize the persistence of range anxiety as a barrier to EV
adoption and have advanced measures for the deployment of
EV charging infrastructure ultimately decreasing air pollution
and increasing electricity sales. Further energizing this work
is the positive correlation observed between publicly available
EV charging infrastructure and EV adoption [7].
To the authors’ knowledge, this study presents the first
exploration of EV mobility in comparison to ICV mobility
in the time of COVID-19. The analysis presented relies upon
national mobility trends with a focus on available traffic
volume and EV charging data in the state of Utah. Section
II reviews the available data, scope of analysis, and sets the
context for the results presented in Section III. High-level
implications of these findings are presented Section IV.
II. DATA AND M ETHODOLOGY
This paper identified four sources of data, in addition to
COVID-19 case numbers [8], for this data-driven analysis of
EV and ICV driving. Mobility data lays the groundwork for
private car travel in the United States and Utah. Utah traffic
volume data offers highway specific transit patterns. When
observed in before, during, and after temporal contexts, Utah
EV charging data can be used to study changes in EV driving.
Mobility and traffic data is set in time by overlaying COVID19 event data in Utah.

A. Mobility Data

D. Utah COVID-19 Event Data

This work employs Google COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports (CMRs) to inform mobility analysis [1]. The
study of mobility is incorporated to understand the dominant
trends that exist in the presence of holidays, days of the week,
and seasonal changes. This high-level depiction of mobility
allows for separation and observation of COVID-19 impacts
on human mobility. The CMRs are taken from anonymized
Google location data and track changes in destination mobility.
Google has categorized all destinations as one of retail and
recreation, grocery and pharmacy, parks, transit stations,
workplaces, or residential. Formally, the five weeks of January,
an approximate “pre-COVID” period in the United States, are
used as a baseline for mobility comparison. Note, CMR data
does not offer multi-year comparison data or feature correction
to allow for controlled comparison of mobility throughout the
COVID-19 pandemic. Baselining is limited to the five week
period spanning from January 3 to February 6, 2020. Percent
mobility changes are measured in comparison to this period
for the corresponding day of the week.

The trends depicted by mobility, traffic, and EV charging
data are set in time by key events, such as case spikes and
health guidelines, during COVID-19 in Utah. The occurrence
of these events is taken from the Utah COVID-19 response
team’s timeline [11]. These events are overlayed on top of
mobility trends to better understand how the public at large
responded to COVID-19 and focus on how those responses
manifest among ICV and EV drivers. On February 28th, the
first COVID-19 patient arrived in Utah. In response, the state
government issued the “Stay Safe, Stay Home” order on March
27th. On April 17th, the state announced its plan for reopening. The 49 days between the arrival of the first case
and announcement of re-opening correspond with the greatest
change in mobility.

Highway sensors around Utah record passing vehicles by
anonymously sensing on-board electronic signals such as
bluetooth and Wi-Fi [9]. A vehicle picked up by two sensors is
called a “match.” Matches do not provide a precise measure of
traffic volume, but inform average speed and relative changes
in vehicle movement. A primary highway in the Salt Lake
City metro area is selected as representative of metro-area
traffic throughout the state. The Nov. 2019 - Nov. 2020 dataset
for this stretch of highway includes over 1.5 million vehicle
matches. Focus on the Salt Lake City metro area follows from
the increased risk of COVID-19 transmission in urban areas,
social distancing and health guidelines non-withstanding, and
the fact that 31% of the state of Utah lives in Salt Lake County.
C. Utah EV Charging Data
Session level EV charging data, charger identity, charger
location, session start time, session end time, and energy,
is taken from networked EV charging stations around the
state comprising more than 28,000 charging sessions, 2,000
EV drivers, and 300 MWh of energy over the Nov. 2019 to
Nov. 2020 analysis period [10]. Session level data informs
EV charging patterns before, during, and since the onset of
COVID infections. This work analyzes local and long distance
driving modes by grouping chargers into public, highway, or
other classes. Public chargers are those located at commercial
businesses, public parks, and municipal buildings along surface streets in cities and suburbs. The public charger dataset
includes 18,000 sessions across 20 level 2 (L2) chargers.
Highway chargers are located at gas stations along major
highways in support of long distance EV trips. The highway
charger dataset includes 800 DC fast and 400 L2 charging
sessions across a total population of 8 DC fast and 8 L2
chargers.

Rolling averages offer a means to distinguish the COVID19 influence on mobility from normal daily patterns. Changes
in COVID-19 cases and consequent health guidelines have
long-term, greater than three weeks [2], impacts on mobility
in aggregate. This study considers day-to-day oscillations
in mobility, or more precisely changes in mobility by type
of location visited, as signal noise that is short in period
and counter-indicative of long-term COVID-19 caused trends.
Daily workplace visitation, as measured by changes in mobility, depicted in Fig. 1, illustrates the difference in short and
long term mobility trends. Here, the regular oscillations of
transit patterns are present in the daily values.

Figure 1. Daily percentage change in workplace visits across Utah.

The percent change in workplace mobility first drops due
to the President’s Day holiday and then remains close to zero
percent indicating a continuation of regular mobility patterns,
as compared to the baseline period in January. The daily
results presented in Fig. 1 depict normal, weekly oscillations.
Regular, positive weekend spikes in workplace mobility represent a regression to the baseline mobility as fewer workplace
commutes occur on weekends. A large decrease in workplace
mobility occurs on the Memorial Day holiday followed by
a short-term doubling in the number of new daily COVID19 cases [8]. The close occurrence of the holiday weekend
and an increase in COVID-19 is an example that fits into
the literature establishing a correlation between mobility and
COVID-19 transmission [2]. Rolling averages offer a means to
filter out short-term oscillations in mobility, expose long-term
changes, and extract COVID-19 impacts from this data.

A. Mobility
Changes in mobility by destination classification is presented in Fig. 2 according to Google Community Mobility Reports (CMRs) data. The 30-day rolling average captures both
long-term COVID-19 changes in mobility as well as seasonal
changes. A significant increase in park visitation in the Salt
Lake City area occurs in the spring and summer. Throughout
the western United States, increased park visitation during
the spread of COVID-19 was driven by the change in season
[12]. Recall that the baseline for mobility is January, 2020 and
CMRs do not offer year-over-year analysis, so it is expected
that park visitation greatly increase in the summer as compared
to a winter baseline.
Controlling for short term oscillations and seasonal change
clarifies the connections between mobility, COVID-19 transmission, government policies, and the public’s response. A
decrease in visitation to public locations beginning in March,
reaching their lowest levels in April, are reflective of the first
wave of COVID-19 cases in Salt Lake City. The sustained
increase in visitation to residential locations suggests people
have shifted recreational trips from public locations to private
residences they consider safer. Workplace mobility remains
far below baseline levels as employers adopt work-from-home
policies [3] and illustrates the subtle weekly periodicity of
the dominant Monday to Friday work week. Only grocery
and pharmacy mobility has returned to near baseline levels
indicating the regular need for food and medicine for a
population regardless of the season, holiday or COVID-19
events. Although still depressed, mobility trends in the Salt
Lake City area have stabilized and disconnected from the
trajectory of new COVID-19 case numbers since a marked
decrease during the first wave of cases in April and May.
B. EV Charging Preferences
The magnitude and timing of EV charging demand are
important to utility load planning [13], [14]. This work offers
a unique insight into how EV charging demand profiles
change during a pandemic. COVID-19 infection trends are
classified into three primary time periods, “before,” “1st wave,”
and “1st fade,” according to their relation to the 49 days
between the state’s first case on February 28th and the state’s
announcement on April 17th of an economic recovery plan for
reopening [11]. Within the 1st wave period, the state issued a
“Stay Safe, Stay Home” directive on March 27th in response
to the growing number of new COVID-19 cases. The 49 days
immediately after the announcement of the reopening plan
represents the 1st fade analysis period. Since April 17th, the
period since the directive, Salt Lake City has experienced two
additional waves of new COVID-19 cases.
The 1st wave period correlates with the biggest change in
EV charger utilization. Average daily energy demand from all
EV chargers in Salt Lake City dropped from approximately
1200 to 700 kWh per day in the weeks immediately before
and after COVID-19 in Utah, as shown in Table I. The number
of sessions per day and total EV charging energy dropped by
35% and 40% respectively, but charging energy per session

dropped by just 8%. This discrepancy indicates that despite a
large change in charger utilization in the aggregate, individual
charging session preferences remained fairly constant. Similarly, a modest decrease in active charging duration of 12%
occurred. The drop in active charging duration and session
energy may suggest that EV drivers took shorter trips during
the “Stay Safe, Stay Home” period and thus had lower EV
range demands, but EV trip specific data is not available to
make that claim explicitly. The 1st fade period exhibits a slight
rebound in session level energy, but otherwise characterizes a
decrease in total non-residential EV charger utilization.

Beyond the “1st fade” period from April 17th to June 4th,
this study classifies three additional 49 day periods, “2nd
wave,” “2nd fade,” and “3rd wave” to explore the longer term
recovery of EV charging after the initial onset of COVID19 transmission and statewide response. These periods span
the dates of June 5th - July 23rd, July 24th - September
10th, and September 11th - October 29th. These subsequent
periods continue the modest rebound in total EV charger
utilization after the “Stay Safe, Stay Home” directive. This
trend is depicted in the total energy and number of sessions
plotted per period in Fig. 3. The lowest period of EV charger
utilization correlates with the period of lowest mobility shown
in Fig. 2. Over these six periods, average energy consumption
per session ranged between 9.89 and 11.39 kWh.
The consistency of per session energy consumption is
further underscored by the comparison histogram in Fig. 4.
The distribution of sessions by energy consumption remains
consistent throughout all six periods outlined in this work.
Most EV charging sessions consume less than 10 kWh per
session, corresponding to an added EV range of up to 30 miles
[15]. Comparing the added 30 mile range to the average U.S.
vehicle trip length of 10.5 miles illustrates the capabilities of
EVs to perform similarly to ICV for most trips [4].
Charging session preferences can be further expressed according to session start and session end time in Fig. 5. Session
start time for charging at publicly sited EV chargers follows a
bi-model distribution which corresponds with EV commuters
arrival to work and return from lunch [7]. The broad adoption
of remote work and school practices does not change the
dominant EV charging session time behaviors, but makes them
less prominent.
The total number of EV charging sessions in Salt Lake City
dropped significantly after the arrival of COVID-19, but the
profile shape remains consistent in Fig. 5. The decrease in

C. EV Charger Utilization
Publicly available EV charger energy consumption, a surrogate for EV driving, offers an indication of EV driving trends
in comparison to highway traffic volume data. This study
focuses on public and highway EV chargers to illustrate how
mobility patterns changed during COVID-19 regarding local
and long distance EV travel. Recall, public chargers in the
studied dataset are located along surface streets in near cities
and highway chargers are located along highways.
The Utah traffic volume and EV charging data are standardized in Fig. 6 for side-by-side comparison. Highway traffic volume data comprises travel by both ICVs and EVs, but mostly
represents ICVs as EVs comprise a small percentage of the
vehicle market [7]. Highway traffic exhibits a seasonal trend
with increased volumes in the summer. The results in Fig. 6
shows the start of increased traffic in the spring, followed
by a COVID-19 disruption, and finally slightly increased
summer travel. Collectively, both EV and total highway traffic
respond to the state’s “Stay Safe, Stay Home” directive for
social distancing on March 27th. Public EV chargers most
support local EV commuting for trips to work, errands, and
recreation. These public EV chargers are concentrated in urban
centers where COVID-19 infection has increased the fastest.
Consequently, public EV chargers energy exhibits the clearest
drop in response to the arrival of COVID-19. EV drivers tend
to come from high income households with high educational
attainment and highly educated employees are most likely to
work from home [16], [17]. This data suggests that EV drivers
are more likely to work from home than the average employee
resulting in a deeper mobility drop for EV drivers.
The trajectory of public EV charger utilization and highway
traffic volume changed on the date that the State of Utah
announced its plans to re-open its economy, but while highway
traffic volume returned to its mean value soon after the
Memorial Day holiday, public EV utilization lagged behind
indicating that a smaller share of EVs were on the road after
the emergence of COVID-19. The lagging reaction of public
EV charger utilization to the 2nd wave and 3rd wave periods
of COVID-19 infection suggest a pattern in which EV drivers
increasingly return to the road as the number of new COVID19 cases slows down and then temporarily reduce their driving

Figure 6. Utah highway traffic and electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) utilization timeline (30-day rolling average).

when cases accelerate. It remains to be seen if the latest rise in
cases will similarly depress EV driving. This phenomenon is
not observed in the highway EV charger utilization trend and
offers a distinction between EV and ICV driving preferences.
Highway EV charger utilization presents a more erratic
trend. The highway EV chargers available are sparsely distributed across the state where the spread of COVID-19 has
varied from community to community. For example, while
the latest count for new COVID-19 cases in Salt Lake City
region was 800, there were just 28 new cases the neighboring
Tooele county [8]. The varied exposure of different regions
of the state to the pandemic results in diverse responses in
mobility which may account for the erratic utilization trend
exhibited by highway chargers. As of approximately Sept.
2020, public and highway EV charger utilization returned
to its mean value as measured on a year-over-year basis
while highway traffic continues to present increased volume
after the summer travel season. Conversely, EV utilization
measured across all EV chargers continues to lag behind its
mean value. This discrepancy may be attributeable to the
inclusion of workplace chargers, excluded by the public and
highway trends, whose utilization is depressed by the COVID19 reduction in workplace commuters.
IV. C ONCLUSION
This analysis shows EV drivers have responded differently
than ICV drivers to the pandemic, but individual’s EV charging
preferences remain consistent over this period. Total EV
energy consumption dropped by 40 to 50% during the six
COVID-19 periods identified due to a decrease in EV mobility,
but session level energy changed by just 8%. EV mobility
lagged behind highway traffic volume in recovery after the 1st
wave of infections. Critically, highway traffic volume in the
state of Utah has detached from the number of new COVID19 cases, as indicated by mobility during the 2nd and 3rd
waves, implying driver fatigue with COVID-19 risks and stayat-home recommendations. Public EV chargers use, on the
other hand, suggests a slight, lagging response of EV drivers
to increasing risks during these later infection waves. When
COVID-19 cases increase, EV drivers are more likely than

ICV drivers to decrease their mobility and return to driving
more slowly once cases decrease.
