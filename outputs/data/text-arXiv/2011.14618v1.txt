infrastructure and essential medical facilities. This has led to a high
surge in scientific volume ranging from proposal for innovative
medical devices, vaccines, infection prediction, and propagation
models for COVID-19. For instance, we witness several tongue-incheek media headlines like ‘Scientists are drowning in COVID-19
papers. Can new tools keep them afloat?’ 1 . Several COVID-19 specific
search and recommendation tools have been developed recently
by various research groups.2 However, to the best of our knowledge, systems that leverage graph-based interactive visualizations
to navigate the vast research volume are not available.
A large volume of social media discussions around the COVID-19
has also led to several natural language processing (NLP) limitations
like identifying facts or opinionated messages, COVID-19 specific
trending topics, and fake or hate messages. Except for COVIDspecific data curation strategies [2], we find a few works [4, 6]
that address some of these NLP limitations. None of the available
systems has attempted to encapsulate social media discussions with
scholarly search and recommendation.
In this paper, we propose a multi-faceted AI-based search and
visualization engine, CovidExplorer. Our system aims to serve
as a means for researchers to understand COVID-19 research and
visualize the trends in the expanding pool of scientific articles on
coronaviruses. Our system seamlessly integrates three different
aspects of COVID-19 into a single platform (i) search and recommendation, (ii) statistics, and (iii) social media discussions. The
system aims to facilitate the researchers and decision-makers with
the latest global research updates and social discussions in India.

ABSTRACT
The entire world is engulfed in the fight against the COVID-19
pandemic, leading to a significant surge in research experiments,
government policies, and social media discussions. A multi-modal
information access and data visualization platform can play a critical role in supporting research aimed at understanding and developing preventive measures for the pandemic. In this paper, we
present a multi-faceted AI-based search and visualization engine,
CovidExplorer. Our system aims to help researchers understand
current state-of-the-art COVID-19 research, identify research articles relevant to their domain, and visualize real-time trends and
statistics of COVID-19 cases. In contrast to other existing systems,
CovidExplorer also brings in India-specific topical discussions on
social media to study different aspects of COVID-19. The system,
demo video, and the datasets are available at http://covidexplorer.in.

The White House and a coalition of leading research groups
provide CORD-19 [7] to the global research community. We also
curate about 227 million tweets relevant to the COVID-19 pandemic
(hereafter ‘Tweet’ dataset). We periodically collect relevant tweet
IDs from a publicly available COVID-19 TweetID corpus [2]. The
tweet IDs are hydrated using the DocNow Hydrator tool3 . We
only explore India-specific tweets by using location metadata or
the presence of Indian locations (states, cities, towns, and village
names) in the tweet text. We also include tweets that are either
posted as a reply to the India-specific tweets and tweets for which
India-specific tweets were posted as a reply. In this paper, we present
all our analyses on this subset of tweets. Both datasets are updated
weekly. Table 1 presents statistics of the CORD-19 and Tweet dataset.
We release the processed data with a clear and accessible data usage

(3) Query Processing Module: This module is responsible for
answering user queries. It fetches query results from the
processed data. For CORD-19 data, this module supports the
keyword search, timeline, and entity queries. It also processes temporal queries about tweet data.
(4) User Interface Module: The User Interface module renders
the query results using interactive visualizations.
We use Flask5 framework, written in Python, for web deployment. We use Elasticsearch6 for data storage and querying. The
timelines are generated using TimelineJS7 and plots are rendered
using Plotly8 , Dash9 and amCharts10 . The tweet preprocessing is
done using NLTK and Gensim libraries.

ARCHITECTURE

In this section, we present the detailed architecture of CovidExplorer. The proposed system comprises four interdependent modules: (i) Data Retrieval and Storage, (ii) Information Generation,
(iii) Query Processing, and (iv) User Interface. Figure 1a shows the
system architecture. Figure 1b shows the landing page of CovidExplorer.
(1) Data Retrieval and Storage Module: This module periodically downloads the data updates from both the data sources
(described in Section 2) and performs pre-processing. The
pre-processed data is stored in a semi-structured format to
facilitate a quick query response. Elasticsearch engine indexes the CORD-19 dataset, and the Tweet dataset is stored
as CSV dumps.
(2) Information Generation Module: This module processes
the curated data. It extracts biological entities and updates
entity statistics (Section 4.1.2) from the CORD-19 dataset.
The Elasticsearch engine also indexes this generated entity
information. In the case of Tweet data, it performs basic
location-based filtering, generates timelines, performs topic
modeling, and generates India-specific insights.

4 FUNCTIONALITIES
4.1 COVID-19 Scholarly Search
We develop COVID-19 scholarly search facilities using the CORD-19
dataset. The search facility comprises several components described
in the following sections.
4.1.1 Full-Text Search. CovidExplorer supports a keyword-based
search in three categories: authors, papers (title), and full-text papers. In addition to the text of the articles, metadata such as title,
abstract, author names, publication year, and venue is used. Each
search query list of relevant papers displayed along with their
authors, venue, the date of publication and bio-entities mention
(described in the next section), and segregated by the year of publication. Each search result is linked to the original paper source URL.
These search results can be further filtered by applying a range of
publication year, or by their bio-entity mentions. Figure 2 shows one
example of paper search results for keyword ‘hydroxychloroquine’.
4.1.2 Named Entity Recognition and Visualization. CovidExplorer
is equipped with a Named Entity Recognition (NER) system for aiding navigation through the large volume of papers. The NER system
uses the state-of-the-art language model for scientific and biomedical text SciBERT [1]. We fine-tune SciBERT using the JNLPBA
corpus [5] and the NCBI-disease corpus [3]. Every article in the
search result shows the biological entities extracted from its abstract.

The current NER functionality identifies seven different types of
bio-entities: DNA, RNA, proteins, cell types, cell lines, diseases, and
chemical names. Any entity belonging to multiple types is assigned
the maximally occurring type for that entity. We assume that other
entity types (except disease) are sub-types of the chemical name
entity type. Hence, other types are given priority over the chemical
names type during the assignment.
We provide multiple insights about the recognized entities. For
each entity type, we display a timeline to visualize the first mention
of each entity of that type, shown in Figure 3a. We also list the top10 most frequently mentioned entities for each entity type. Table 2
shows the statistics along with the names of popular instances in
each entity class. For each entity, we also individually show the
first mention, a visualization of popular co-mentioned entities, and
the year-wise distribution of mention frequencies. We also display
all papers that contain these individual entities segregated by the
year of publication. Figures 3b and 3c show the entity statistics and
co-mentioned entities for candidate entity ‘Hydroxychloroquine’.

India-specific Infection Statistics

CovidExplorer also displays a statistics page that keeps track of
the daily evolving pandemic situation in India. Daily, it updates the
total cases, active cases, deaths, and recovery counts. Besides, it
provides state-wise cumulative data of the number of active cases.

Social Media Discussions

The filtered dataset of ∼5.7 million tweets is processed and in the
following sections, we describe some of the India-specific social
media insights.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS

In this work, we present CovidExplorer. CovidExplorer aids
researchers in understanding current state-of-the-art COVID-19 research, identify research articles relevant to their domain, visualize
real-time trends and statistics of COVID-19 cases, and understand
social media discussions. In the future, we aim to provide APIs
to enable researchers to access the query results. We also aim to
create named entity-based networks that visually depict the context of occurrences of the entities across the resource pool. The
Tweet dataset can be further processed using BERT-like models to
construct sentence embeddings for unsupervised topical clustering.
This method can be an effective method of labeling the dataset.
