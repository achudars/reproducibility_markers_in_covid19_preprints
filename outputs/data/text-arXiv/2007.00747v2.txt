1 INTRODUCTION
The immense amount of data is constantly being generated in a variety of fields including environmental,
biological, and physical sciences due to the rapid advancements in monitoring and computational techniques
[1][2]. The massive data requires efficient tools and intermediates for data management [3], analysis,
visualization, and communication [4]. Web-based information systems (IS) serve as one-stop platforms to
access, analyze, and explore information effectively for decision-making purposes [5][6]. Although current
systems are proved to be successful to communicate and analyze data efficiently, they still suffer from the
complexity and the higher learning curves due to the limitations of conventional interaction methods [7]. Users
of information systems (e.g. public, workers, managers, decision-makers, organizational leaders) often look for
a certain piece of knowledge for which they may have to master the functionalities and resources provided by
the IS [8]. This is especially tedious and discouraging for users who are not continuous visitors to the system.
Thus, modern approaches are needed to free the users from the nuances and complexities of information
systems and provide a feasible tool to access knowledge [9]. Automated knowledge communication will be
critical for participatory decision-making process in disaster mitigation as well [10][11].

With the advancements in artificial intelligence, there is a significant surge in research of chatbots, which
can be defined as intelligent agents (i.e. assistants) that have the ability to comprehend natural language
queries and produce a direct and factual response utilizing data and service providers [12]. More recently, the
increased prevalence of deep learning tools and generalized algorithms resulted in the growth of chatbots fueled
from deep learning’s ability to make robust and scalable inferences out of high-dimensional and likely noisy
data [13]. Technology companies have been taking the lead on operational virtual assistants integrated into
their ecosystem which triggered a brand new and massive market that was valued at US$ 2.2 billion in 2018
and is expected to reach US$ 11.3 billion by 2024 [14]. However, the usage of chatbots for effective and reliable
information communication is not widespread among public, government, and scientific communities [15]. As
of 2018, only 16% of Internet users have ever used a chatbot [16] despite the fact that there is a substantial
demand [17]. Several publications emphasize the potential chatbots hold to serve as the next generation
information communication tool and make the case for an urgent need for chatbot development and adoption
in their respective fields [18][19]. The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Institute for Water
Resources reports that virtual assistants hold great promise for the USACE to better serve the public, enhance
workflow, and improve decision-making while saving time and financial resources [20]. Voice-enabled
knowledge systems can support novel virtual reality systems [21] for emergency response training and disaster
risk communication [22]. More recently, the rise of the COVID-19 pandemic made it clear that chatbots will be
instrumental in cases where accurate information needs to be communicated to a substantial group of people
with different backgrounds and technological resources as reported in a Nature article [23]. Sohrabi et al. [24]
describe how artificial intelligence-powered chatbots can be widely used to provide up-to-date information
regarding the COVID-19 out-break in the context of prevention and management.
While these reports put forth a futuristic and essential vision, they are held back by several challenges
regarding the adoption of virtual assistants [25]. One of the major obstacles of virtual assistant development
and utilization is that the available services usually require a centralized data flow (e.g. server-side processing
of voice, sentence, or data) involving a third-party service provider which presents concerns in terms of data
privacy, security, and compatibility [26]. Currently available frameworks for chatbot development often employ
vertical integration in which the developers find themselves stuck with the ecosystem of the service provider
[27]. A 2019 report on the virtual personal assistant market concludes that the high-growth inflection point of
the market and wide adoption of smart assistants in many fields will occur as open-source and free assistant
development tools [27]. A second major challenge is that the workforce and / or financial resources required to
initialize and maintain a chatbot discourages establishments, governments, research groups, and non-profits,
while for larger companies and organizations these costs justify themselves for the long term [28]. Furthermore,
active internet connection is often needed for chatbot to operate at its simplest level, which presents a significant
setback as many use cases do not have a reliable and consistent internet connection [20].
This paper presents Instant Expert, an open-source semantic web component to build and integrate voiceenabled smart assistants (i.e. chatbots) for any web platform regardless of the underlying domain and
technology. The component allows non-technical domain experts to incorporate an operational assistant with
voice recognition capability into their websites by simply adding as little as a single line of HTML code while
customizations are enabled for more advanced use cases. The component entails an encapsulated user
interface, that accepts natural language questions via text and speech inputs as well as selection from a
predefined list of questions. A knowledge generation module processes questions to map them to the configured

2

arXiv:2007.00747 [cs.AI]

data resource and returns the answers utilizing its inference engine and natural language mapping methods
powered by deep learning and heuristic algorithms. Instant Expert is capable of automatically parsing,
processing, and modeling internal (same-origin) or external (cross-origin) Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
webpages as an information resource as well as communicating with an external knowledge engine for more
advanced use cases. The presented framework is powered by advanced web technologies to ensure reusability
and reliability and deep learning to perform accurate natural language mappings. A use case for creating an
informatory assistant for COVID-19 based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data is
presented to demonstrate the framework’s usage and benefits.
The main contributions of this research can be summarized as follows. The presented component makes it
possible for any web system on any domain to have its own voice-enabled smart assistant to instantly provide
factual responses to natural language queries. It can grow the system’s visibility and increase user retention
and satisfaction due to providing the user with the information they desire without a hassle. The component can
especially be valuable for individual developers, academic research groups, small companies, non-profits, and
public offices that may not have the resources for the development and maintenance of commercial smart
assistants for their organization. The framework liberates developers from the limitations and boundaries of any
given ecosystem and maximizes customization based on available resources and needs while providing a
generalized framework to offer standardized, robust, and efficient smart assistants. The framework is
completely built on web technologies (e.g. HTML5, JavaScript, CSS) working on the client-side which eliminates
the dependence to server-side technologies and assures data privacy. Finally, the Instant Expert’s
independence from any service pro-vide and ecosystem paves the way for its expansion into virtual reality (e.g.
A-Frame), and augmented reality (i.e. HoloLens and Magic Leap) applications through web [29].
The remainder of this article is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the methodology of the development
and implementation of the intelligent web framework. Section 3 describes a case study on COVID-19 and provides benchmark results and performance analysis. Section 4 concludes the articles with a summary of
contributions and future work.
2 METHODS
The Instant Expert web component entails several components all of which are implemented using Hypertext
Markup Language 5 (HTML5), JavaScript (JS), and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). The component runs
completely on the client-side (i.e. utilizing only the client’s hardware) by which significantly minimizes the
workload, and consequently, the maintenance cost to employ a smart assistant. The framework can be
abstracted into two main semantic units: 1) user interaction and interface and 2) knowledge generation. Various
features of ECMAScript 6 (ES6) have been utilized in the software including JS Modules to avoid global
namespace pollution and provide a degree of encapsulation against potential conflicts between the smart
assistant and hosting web platform. The framework can be imported into any web application as a script as
demonstrated below.
<script src="instant-expert-dist.js"></script>

Additional benefits of utilizing ES6 include default parameter values, string interpolation, OOP-style (ObjectOriented Programming) classes, which lead to a robust, clean, and extendible product. The usage of web
frameworks (e.g. Polymer, Stencil) is considered when designing the web component, though consciously
avoided to minimize the learning curve and eliminate the dependency on any framework’s abstraction. The

3

arXiv:2007.00747 [cs.AI]

code of Instant Expert is fully open-source and accessible via GitHub (https://github.com/uihilab/instant-expert)
with detailed documentation guiding developers on how to employ and configure the framework. Figure 1
summarizes the overall architecture of the presented framework.

Figure 1: System architecture of the Instant Expert

2.1 User Interaction and Interface
The Instant Expert is built upon the features provided by the Web Components. Web Components are a
collection of web technologies combined with the purpose of creating reusable, customizable, and encapsulated
HTML elements [30]. It is mainly powered by three web technologies. Custom Elements enables the creation
of new HTML elements. HTML templates offer the mechanism to define HTML content that can be instantiated
during runtime instead of getting rendered when the page is loaded. Shadow DOM provides encapsulation of
an element’s features with a shadow tree associated with the web component [31]. The major consideration
when designing the component is to prevent it to affect the visual and functional integrity of the hosting web site,
as well as to prevent it from getting affected by the hosting web site. Shadow DOM prevents potential integration
complications by creating a shadow root under the custom HTML element and rendering it separately from the
main document DOM. These new technologies are not yet widely adopted in the industry and especially in
academia despite the remarkable benefits they offer. Another aim of this paper is to serve as an example to
advantages of Web Components by reducing the technicality.
CSS Containment
Containment is a CSS feature that aims to isolate a contained element’s contents from the rest of the
document, as much as possible. The main purpose of the containment is to provide optimization and offer
stability in rendering and painting of web pages by providing a standardized way. Browsers are always looking
to make optimizations when rendering a page. Containment provides a standardized way to tell the browser
where and how it can optimize without breaking the intended functionality. When using third-party DOM, such
as the Instant Expert, containment can prove to be useful to sandbox the component to protect and increase

4

arXiv:2007.00747 [cs.AI]

the performance of the page. It should be noted that containment is not a security feature and is not aimed to
provide a full encapsulation.
There are 4 main types of containment that can either be used individually or in groups. The details of each
containment type can be found in the specification document published by the World Wide Web Consortium
(W3C) [32]. For the purposes of Instant Expert, Content Containment has been used which combines Layout,
Paint, and Style Containments. A web component already brings the containing functionality; however, Content
Containment introduces significant performance benefits and decreases rendering runtime. This is especially
valuable to protect the performance of the website that integrates the Instant Expert. As of June 2020, CSS
Containment is supported by default by the latest versions of major browsers (i.e. Google Chrome, Opera,
Mozilla Firefox Nightly, and Microsoft Edge). Another advantage of using Content Containment is that it will not
affect the functionality of Instant Expert even if the client browser does not support it.
User Input
There are three ways for a user to interact with the system; a) manually typing the question to a text box, b)
invoking voice recognition to ask the question using a microphone, and c) selecting from a predefined list of
questions (Figure 2). Text input is the most common type of interaction due to the search engine culture. Having
a predefined list of questions allows the user to explore the system and better understand its capabilities. Voiceenabled communication is supported using Web Speech API, which is an experimental technology that defines
a JavaScript API to integrate speech recognition and speech synthesis functionality into web pages. As of June
2020, speech recognition is supported by the latest versions of Google Chrome, Opera, and Microsoft Edge
browsers. Speech synthesis is supported in all major browsers (e.g. Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Opera,
Microsoft Edge, and Safari). The component checks the client browser at initialization to test if Web Speech
API is supported and disables speech features if not supported. The component allows the incorporation of
third-party speech recognition and synthesis APIs, however, it requires modification of the component’s source
code. Upon the construction of the natural language question in text format, all input types eventually follow
through the same flow to be passed to the knowledge generation module.
2.2 Knowledge Generation Module
The knowledge generation module is tasked with the complete workflow of producing a direct response to the
given natural language question. There are two main approaches for powering the Instant Expert with a
knowledge base; knowledge engine mode and question and answer (Q&A) mode. The knowledge engine mode
relies on the integration of an external server-side knowledge engine that is capable of accessing and analyzing
vast amounts of data in response to a natural language question. The Q&A mode requires a list of question &
answer pairs supplied manually or by providing the URL of a webpage containing such pairs (e.g. Frequently
Asked Questions). The Q&A mode utilizes deep learning models to create a tensor representation for each
question in the knowledge base in order to calculate semantic similarity with the user question.
2.2.1 Q&A Mode
A major motivation of Instant Expert is to augment existing web platforms with a plug-and-play importable web
component with minimal effort. In most use cases, static and textual responses can suffice to help users find
useful information that they were looking for. Such pieces of information are often presented in a web platform
in the form of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ). However, searching for information via FAQs is often

5

arXiv:2007.00747 [cs.AI]

discouraging, hard to navigate, time-consuming, and results in failure of communicating critical information in a
timely manner [33]. As a solution, the Q&A Mode of the Knowledge Generation Module is equipped with
functionalities to parse and process FAQ pages and to efficiently and effectively map any user question into
one of the question and answer pairs in the generated knowledge base. Thus, the Instant Expert effortlessly
enhances user experience by allowing the users to verbally communicate with the system and receive a direct
response without the hassle of going through potentially hundreds of frequently asked questions. Figure 2
visualizes the workflow for the Q&A Mode.

Figure 2: Flowchart summarizing the Q&A Mode's execution logic.

Q&A Parsing and Collection
There are two approaches to collect Q&A pairs; manual entry and automatic FAQ parsing. For web platforms
that do not have already established FAQ pages, the web component allows the developers to enter questions
and their respective answers through HTML <slot> elements within the scope of Instant Expert in a hierarchical
and organized manner. Since the Q&A pairs are directly provided, no further processing has been done before
the encoding stage.
Automatic FAQ parsing requires the developer to supply the direct URL of the webpage containing the FAQ
into the web component as an attribute. Both same-origin and cross-origin addresses are accepted given that
the FAQ pages, that are not hosted in the same domain as the application, are navigated via a proxy server.
The strength of the FAQ parsing and Q&A extraction comes from its unique design where no preprocessing is
required regarding the webpage structure. Heuristic algorithms can perform just as well or better than machine
learning approaches for similar scraping tasks as reported in the literature [34]. Our novel heuristic algorithm is
built on the basis of two assumptions concerning the structure of the FAQ webpage: 1) the majority of question
mark characters belong to the FAQ on a given page, and 2) both the questions and answers follow a certain
HTML structure (i.e. not arbitrarily placed). The first assumption is clearly the case for the majority, if not all, of
the FAQ pages since most FAQ questions end with a question mark and it is extremely unlikely to have more
question marks in the remaining of the page. As for the second assumption, all questions in a given FAQ
webpage is highly likely to follow a certain convention for the purpose of clarity, symmetry, maintainability, and
effectiveness. More concretely, the HTML elements containing the FAQ question will likely share certain
characteristics such as element tag, class, styling, immediate parents, and DOM depth. Thus, a pattern can be

6

arXiv:2007.00747 [cs.AI]

inferred by analyzing these correlations in an efficient way. The same condition is applicable for the FAQ
answers.
The parsing process begins with finding innermost HTML elements containing a question mark to retrieve
unique texts. Per our assumption, the majority of these question marks should belong to FAQ questions. To
deduce a pattern, we traverse each retrieved element to keep record of their and their closest three parents, if
exist, tag names along with their depth within the DOM tree. Per our symmetry assumption, the elements
containing FAQ questions should produce the same values for tag names and depth. Using a hash table, the
frequency of each combination is measured to identify the correct pattern. Thus, all FAQ questions are
successfully retrieved based on the inferred pattern. Before initiating the process for parsing the FAQ answers,
a challenge arises regarding the scope. For example, the innermost element containing the question might have
parent elements for visual and interactive purposes (e.g. buttons, container boxes) before continuing to the
following question or answer. It is known that the answer to a question lies somewhere between the text of that
question and the text of next question. However, it cannot be known whether the answer is grouped with its
question:
<div id="questionGroup1">
<div id="question1Container">...</div>
<div id="answer1Container">...</div>
</div>

or simply have been coded sequentially in the same scope with other questions and answers:
<div id="question1Container">...</div>
<div id="answer1Container">...</div>

Even if processing would have been performed to find the uppermost parent containing only the question
text, scope issues still would not fully resolve since it is a common practice in FAQ pages to group questions
by topic, which breaks the sibling relationship between the last question in a group and the first question in the
next group. As a solution, a heuristic approach is taken to deduce a pattern to work in all possible webpage
configurations. First, the uppermost parent of each question that does not contain its following question is
retrieved, and its distance to the child is recorded. Per the symmetry assumption, the majority of retrievals will
share the same distance value. Thus, the system is able to extract all answers regardless of their scope and
structuring. Thus, all Q&A pairs are extracted from an FAQ webpage in a heuristic manner requiring no data
other than the URL of the Q&A page.
Q&A Encoding
The extracted Q&A pairs are processed to create an encoded and numeric representation of the questions
so that the user question can effectively be mapped. Due to the high variety of expression styles for questions
sharing the same intent and desiring the same output, the structure and the words in the sentence should be
analyzed while preserving the semantic integrity [35]. Furthermore, this representation will only be used to
calculate similarity between different question sentences, and thus, natural language parsing and data
extraction is not a necessity. An additional design choice is to be able to efficiently perform the encoding process
on the client-side. Given these requirements, the Instant Expert utilizes the Universal Sentence Encoder (USE)
[36], a model that is designed to embed text to produce a vector representation entailing the semantic
information within the sentence. More specifically, the Transformer architecture [37] constitutes the underlying
encoding model for context-aware representations of words resulting in a 512-dimensional vector. Within the

7

arXiv:2007.00747 [cs.AI]

presented framework, a lightweight version of the USE with an 8,000-word vocabulary is imported and executed
with TensorFlow.js, an open-source JavaScript library that can train and deploy machine learning models on
the client-side via the browser.
All questions (n questions) in the collected Q&A pairs are provided as input to the USE model via
TensorFlow.js which produces a 512-dimensional tensor per question and results in a [n, 512]-sized matrix.
This process takes place asynchronously in the background while allowing the users of the website to continue
their interaction as usual. Once the processing is complete, the tensor matrix as well as the list of Q&A pairs
are saved within the duration of the session. If the developer enabled downloadModel attribute of the Instant
Expert web component, then the framework will generate a JSON file consisting of the tensor matrix and the
Q&A pairs. This JSON file can be hosted on a server and the URL to access the file can be provided to Instant
Expert. This mechanism allows the developers to prevent the client’s hardware resources to unnecessarily be
used by the embedding process, and make the Instant Expert instance to be initialized instantly to respond to
any questions without needing to wait for the asynchronous operations to be completed. Thus, the framework
allows three different usage styles for the Q&A Mode: same-origin or cross-origin FAQ webpage, manual Q&A
definition, and JSON file containing Q&A pairs and question embeddings.
Response Generation
Each time a user asks a question through Instant Expert, the USE model is utilized in the same fashion to
generate the embeddings in the form of a tensor. Thus, every predefined question with known answers as well
as the input question are represented as points on a 512-dimensional coordinate system. Distance between
these points is used as the criterion to assess semantic similarity. As the distance measurement technique, this
framework utilizes the Cosine Similarity (Eq. 1) which is defined as;
cos θ =

𝑋. 𝑌
‖𝑋‖ ‖𝑌‖

(1)

, where X and Y are the tensor representations of the user’s question and a predefined question in the parsed
Q&A pairs, respectively. For robust calculation of dot products and norms, an open-source JavaScript library
(Math.js) is utilized. This similarity is calculated for n questions that result in a similarity array where the values
closer to 1 indicate higher correlation. Before completing the mapping to the question with the highest similarity,
a threshold value is established to filter unrelated questions where a satisfactory answer is not present in the
knowledge base. This is especially important to eliminate the potential to misguide users with unrelated or
unappropriated information. This threshold value can be adjusted according to the nature of the use case to
determine the trade-off between precision and recall. The framework performs the response generation phase
asynchronously so that the hosting website is not throttled or disturbed. The generated response is returned to
be displayed via the web component’s interface along with the source of information to ensure the recipient of
the information is aware of the source.
2.2.2 Knowledge Engine Mode
The presented component can be connected to an external knowledge engine for more sophisticated use
cases of intelligent assistants. A server-side engine may utilize semantic webs to aid in the inference process
and dynamic and distributed data resources to respond to complex queries. The main advantage of such engine
is the use of custom natural language processing approaches capable of extracting useful information from the
question such as time and date, location, intent, output type (e.g. graph, image, numeric value), ontological

8

arXiv:2007.00747 [cs.AI]

entities, and mathematical and statistical operations [38]. Thus, the knowledge generation process pertaining
to an external engine has a computational essence in comparison to merely providing textual information.
The web component retrieves the answer for the input question by making an HTTP POST request to an
external knowledge engine using the webhook link provided with the ‘engine’ attribute of the element. The only
parameter passed to the engine is the question text using the parameter key ‘question’, which can be modified
per developer’s configuration. The component expects a response from the engine in JSON format with a keyvalue pair where value represents the response. The module requires the response to return within 2 seconds
to portray a realistic and natural interaction with the user. If the engine and the web page that integrates the
Instant Expert are not hosted on the same origin, then the engine should be able to handle requests from origins
outside of its own by setting up Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), or utilize other solutions such as to
use a proxy server or script.
3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
3.1 Q&A Mode – COVID-19 Case Study
The generalized nature of the presented framework makes it suitable for usage in any domain. For the purpose
of demonstrating its workflow and benefits, an example use case needs to be selected where the necessity and
impact of chatbots are evident. The degree of misinformation and sparseness of sources results in a data mess
for topics ranging from politics to health. Social media and online news outlets often receive the same
information from the same source, yet, reports it as duplication through a story with a narrative, which in turn,
results in information pollution. One of the advantages of the Instant Expert is that it allows the sharing of
information through numerous challenges by referencing the original source instead of duplication which opens
the way for distrust. A recent example of such scenario is the ongoing pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019
(COVID-19). It has been widely reported how chatbots can prove to be useful during the pandemic on different
levels envisioned and developed by various organizations and companies. Examples to these chatbot use
cases regarding COVID-19 include, but not limited to, assessing eligibility for plasma donation [39], symptom
checkers and health screening [40][41][42], and information dissemination, which is especially crucial as
chatbots provide a direct and single response to a given question instead of the alternative of being succumbed
to social media posts and the spread of misleading or incomplete information [43][23]. It has been advised that
local authorities and healthcare businesses should utilize chatbots to ensure 7/24 accurate information flow
powered by the extensive amounts of Frequently Asked Questions available by authoritative sources such as
CDC and WHO [44]. Yet, the realization of this vision is hindered by the lack of technological capabilities,
resources, and funding available to such local and healthcare organizations. Thus, an information dissemination
chatbot for COVID-19 has been selected as the use case in this paper to demonstrate the presented
framework’s usage and benefits due to the urgent demand as COVID-19 pandemic is progressing.
According to web analytics service [45], the CDC website has received the highest number of visits (i.e.
traffic) among websites that are served in English and that offer information and statistics on the spread of the
COVID-19 infection. Thus, we have selected the CDC’s official Frequently Asked Questions webpage
(https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html) as a source for the following use cases. On that page,
there is a total of 119 questions spanning various topics ranging from COVID-19 basics to cleaning and

9

arXiv:2007.00747 [cs.AI]

disinfection as of June 20, 2020. Figure 3 shows screenshots from the Instant Expert instance with CDCpowered Q&A set.
The case study has been performed on an average personal computer that is powered by Intel(R) Core(TM)
i7-7700HQ CPU @ 2.80 GHz, 32 GB 2400 MHz RAM, and an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050.

recommendations to the user.

3.1.1 FAQ from a Web Page
The Instant Expert has been initialized in the FAQ mode and provided the CDC’s FAQ URL as the information
source. Due to the cross-origin limitations, a proxy server (CORS Anywhere) has been utilized to retrieve the
webpage contents. Exactly all 119 Q&A items on the CDC page have successfully been extracted with a 100%
precision and recall, followed by the embedding of all questions for natural language mapping. The average
time spent on parsing the Q&A pairs and for embedding the questions using the Universal Sentence Encoder
has been reported in Figure 4. In order to visualize the processing complexity, this benchmark has been
performed for subsets of the CDC questions so that the correlation between the number of questions and the
processing time is clear. The runtime measurement does not include the time spent for the retrieval of the FAQ
page via GET request and loading the USE model as both of their performance is out of the presented
framework’s scope and affected by external parameters such as the internet speed. Furthermore, these actions
are only performed once, and thus, is neither related to the number of questions nor the structure of the FAQ
page.

Figure 4: Benchmarks for powering the Instant Expert from an FAQ webpage: parsing time and embedding time.

One of the main purposes of the FAQ Mode is to allow users to ask questions in various natural language
expressions. A test set is generated to quantify how flexible the Instant Expert is in terms of accurately mapping
question variations that share the same intent. The test set contains the original FAQ question, answer, and
one natural language question that expects the same answer with different phrasing. For objectivity, a thirdparty software (i.e. QuillBot), which is a machine learning-powered paraphraser and sentence restructurer, is
utilized to produce high-variance natural language questions with a similar meaning to the original. Minor
manual modifications have been made to questions in order to challenge the inference component of the system
by referencing the actual questions asked by people on the internet. Table 1 provides examples of the generated
questions in comparison to the original question. Additionally, the test set also contains three questions that the
CDC’s FAQ cannot and should not answer. These three questions are taken from the US Federal Drug
Administration’s (FDA) FAQ webpage. The reason for this addition is to make sure that the chatbot does not
disseminate inaccurate and unrelated information. Thus, the test contains a total of 122 questions. For
measurements, a benchmark analysis has been carried out to experiment with a broad range of confidence
threshold values with respect to the precision and recall values. For reference, precision represents the
percentage of questions that have been mapped to the correct answer out of all the questions that are mapped
to some answer. Recall, on the other hand, represents the percentage of questions that have been accurately
mapped. Both the benchmark code and a complete test set can be found on the GitHub repository for
reproducibility and reanalysis.

have been selected for this imbalanced classification problem with multiple classes as formulated below [46]. n
value in the equations below represents the number of different questions in the FAQ (i.e. classes).

Figure 5 shows how precision and recall values are affected based on the selected confidence threshold. To
achieve an accurate and complete system, the goal is to maximize the precision and recall values, however, a
trade-off evaluation is required [47]. Based on the use case, it may be important to maximize the precision for
making sure to always provide the accurate answer for questions that are mapped or to maximize recall for
mapping as much question as possible while potentially sacrificing the accuracy of a few. For this use case, the
recall starts to drastically decrease around confidence level of 0.8 while the precision stabilizes as seen on
Figure 5. Looking at a confidence level of 0.75, the precision is maximized with a value of 100% while recall
value is 97.541%. Coincidently, the ideal confidence value for the highest possible recall is also observed to be
0.75, though for other cases this value might differ resulting in a trade-off to prioritize either maximum precision

12

arXiv:2007.00747 [cs.AI]

or recall. This ideal confidence level can also be observed with the harmonic mean of precision and recall values
(i.e. f1-score) where f1-score is the highest at 0.75 confidence.

Figure 5: Precision, recall, and f1-score values for different confidence thresholds based on generated test data.

For applications when the prediction results in critical information regarding human health, such as the use
case for COVID-19, precision is more critical than recall. Because, providing the wrong information can have
detrimental results. Thus, based on the experiment, the confidence threshold is set to 0.75 by default to ensure
perfect precision of 100%, which results in 3 out of 119 questions are left unmapped. These three questions
are examined to identify why they have not reached to satisfactory confidences. Table 2 summarizes the original
FAQ text, the test question, and commentary on why the mapping was not successful. Based on the
investigation, we conclude the questions that are not context-independent and not well-structured are more
difficult to be mapped from to-the-point questions that an average user of the system might ask.

The structure of the original question is not in
the form of a question, and rather a
recommendation. Especially since there are
similar questions exist in the FAQ on dealing
with people with underlying conditions, the
mapping process couldn’t complete with a
satisfactory confidence.

meaning depend on a previous question in the
FAQ list.

The Instant Expert can be instantiated based on a FAQ webpage by simply providing the URL. This use
case is especially suitable for cases where the information in the FAQ change frequently. As an example, it has
been widely reported that the constantly and rapidly changing nature of COVID-19-related data and guidelines
cause misinformation or confusion of the public [48]. Thus, this mode can justify the required client-side
workload when the source is an ever-expanding and ever-changing list of question and answers. Example
usage is shown below.
<instant-expert
mode="faq-web"
faq-url="YourProxyURL/

</instant-expert>

Parsing FAQs from Other Sources
As a tangent to the COVID-19 Case Study that is powered by CDC data, we have experimented with FAQ
webpages from other websites and domains to showcase the Instant Expert’s generalized structure and domain
independence. Table 3 summarizes five FAQ sources that were used in the same manner as described in the
implementation above by providing the respective URL. The output of the parsing component has been
recorded and analyzed to measure the success rate. In this context, precision represents the number of the
accurate text groups that were labeled as a question or an answer, whereas, the recall represents out of all the
question and answers on the given webpage the framework was able to accurately parse. The analyzed FAQ
webpages are structured in various ways and in different languages (e.g. English, German, Spanish, French),
thus, demonstrating the parsing process’ generalized workflow. All FAQ pages below analyzed as of June 26th,
2020.

3.1.2 FAQ from a Custom List
Some use cases may require manual definition of question and answers instead of having or relying on an
existing FAQ webpage. To enable such initialization, the Instant Expert presents a mode, called faq-custom, in
which HTML Slot elements are utilized to allow the developer to specify questions and their corresponding
answers as shown below.
<instant-expert mode="faq-custom">
<div slot="questions">
<p>Question 1</p>
<p>Question 2</p>
</div>
<div slot="answers">
<p>Answer 1</p>
<p>Answer 2</p>
</div>
</instant-expert>

3.1.3 FAQ from a Model
Most of the parsing and embedding process takes place on the background (i.e. async) to allow users to
continue normal operation, however, it still consumes client resources and requires varying time depending on
client hardware. Both previous FAQ processing approaches (i.e. web, custom) come with the capability of
extracting a JSON file containing the parsed Q&A pairs along with their USE embeddings (e.g. a 512dimensional tensor). This downloaded model file can be provided to the Instant Expert directly to eliminate the
time and resources required for FAQ processing. This use case is suggested as the default method to ensure
the users can use the chatbot immediately after the page is loaded. Since no new processing is done, the
precision and recall values are the same as reported above. Example usage is presented below.

Knowledge Engine Mode

An example use case of the presented framework in Knowledge Engine Mode is the development of a generic
question answering assistant using the Project Answer Search by Microsoft Cognitive Labs. Project Answer
Search is an experimental technology to instantly answer natural language user queries with factual responses

15

arXiv:2007.00747 [cs.AI]

[49]. This use case is specifically developed to be a complete solution that (a) will serve as an adoption guide
to the users, (b) can be easily accessed to try the presented software, (c) and can be conveniently reproduced
for production use or ensure the component’s correctness. There are two parts constituting this use case;
developing a question-answering engine as the backend and developing a website that implements the Instant
Expert component integrated with the engine. The backend is implemented as a Node.js application and served
on a cloud platform (i.e. Heroku). The source codes for both the backend and the website are available on
Instant Expert GitHub repository in the examples directory along with the directions necessary for reproduction.
The validation of use cases of the Knowledge Engine Mode belongs to the external natural-language question
answering service where the accuracy can be measured for response generation. For this use case, an already
validated system (i.e. Project Answer Search) is utilized to focus on the framework’s communication
mechanism. Figure 6 shows this use case in action.

4 CONCLUSIONS
This research introduces the Instant Expert, an open-source semantic web framework to effortlessly create and
integrate fully functional voice-enabled smart assistants (i.e. chatbots) into any web platform with as little as a
single line of HTML code. It provides a complete solution with its user interface and functionalities,
communication protocols, and knowledge generation components powered by heuristic algorithms and deep
learning models. It utilizes a variety of advanced web technologies including Web Components with Shadow
DOM and CSS Containment to provide an isolated, robust, and efficient solution, and frees the developers from
the complications of integrating third-party components into existing web platforms.

16

arXiv:2007.00747 [cs.AI]

To the best of our knowledge, the presented framework is the first FAQ-powered chatbot that is fully opensource and free-to-use as well as the first that can fully operate on the client-side, which is favorable to minimize
maintenance and operation costs and to protect user data. Additionally, the framework minimizes the complexity
and the effort needed to implement and maintain chatbots and allow individual developers, academic research
groups, small companies, non-profits, and public offices to enrich their web platforms with natural language
communication. Furthermore, information delivery enhanced with natural language voice interactions instead
of browsing through broad and entangled websites simplify the learning process for people with cognitive and
mobility impairments. Another potential advantage is that the simplified design of the Instant Expert’s visual
elements eliminates distractions in the learning process for people with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder
(ADHD).
For future work, there are many paths to advance the proposed vision. The parsing component of the FAQ
Mode can be improved to 1) recursively parse question pages with links and 2) to group questions by their focus
to recommend solutions to the user in cases where their question cannot directly be answered. Another potential
improvement to the FAQ Mode would be to allow multiple custom question variations to better model an intent
so that the recall can be maximized while the knowledge base scales. For the Knowledge Engine Mode,
integration modules can be developed to effortlessly connect third-party services for natural language
processing and inference. The Instant Expert’s scope and capabilities can be expanded into virtual reality (e.g.
A-Frame), and augmented reality (i.e. HoloLens and Magic Leap) applications. Finally, the framework can be
utilized to scrape multiple FAQs from a variety of sources to create a smart assistant for a selected subject in
any domain.
