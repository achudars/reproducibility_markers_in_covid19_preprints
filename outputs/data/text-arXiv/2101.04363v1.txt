Abstract—Following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic
and subsequent lockdowns, software engineers’ daily life was
disrupted and abruptly forced into remote working from home.
This change deeply impacted typical working routines, affecting
both well-being and productivity. Moreover, this pandemic will
have long-lasting effects in the software industry, with several
tech companies allowing their employees to work from home
indefinitely if they wish to do so. Therefore, it is crucial to
analyze and understand how a typical working day looks like
when working from home and how individual activities affect
software developers’ well-being and productivity. We performed
a two-wave longitudinal study involving almost 200 globally
carefully selected software professionals, inferring daily activities with perceived well-being, productivity, and other relevant
psychological and social variables. Results suggest that the time
software engineers spent doing specific activities from home was
similar when working in the office. However, we also found some
significant mean differences. The amount of time developers spent
on each activity was unrelated to their well-being, perceived
productivity, and other variables. We conclude that working
remotely is not per se a challenge for organizations or developers.

investigated specific software development practices, such as
process [9], [10] or communication [11]. Also, collaboration
and characteristics of remote and asynchronous projects have
been extensively studied by the Global Software Engineering
community [12], [13]. Such studies typically focus on the
interaction of software development teams co-located in
different geographical areas. However, the focus has been on
software development teams working together on distributed
projects. So far, the research on working from home practices
has been quite limited. One reason is that managers are quite
skeptical about remote working due to worries concerning
employees’ reduced focus, productivity, company culture, or
team cohesiveness [14]. Nevertheless, the pandemic made many
of us realize that some fears are unfounded (such as decreasing
productivity) and that we have to face such challenges until a
sufficient number of people have been vaccinated, a process that
might take several years. Hence, anecdotal evidence driving top
managerial decisions due to the lack of specific research [15]
should be supplemented with scholarly evidence. Thus, we
formulate the following research questions:

90s, scholars started asking themselves about the challenges investigated predictors of well-being and stress in occupational
and opportunities of working from home [8]. Researchers settings [18], [19], [20] has not measured the specific activities

that might have contributed to higher stress and lower levels
of well-being. However, the type of activity someone is doing
might contribute to higher stress levels beyond other factors
identified by previous research, such as support by coworkers
and supervisors [21]. If we were to identify that specific
activities are associated with higher or lower levels of stress or
well-being, this would provide valuable information for future
research investigating predictors of stress.
Over a two-week period, we collected twice information
regarding developers’ activities and self-reported well-being
and productivity measures to assess changes along with the
lockdown. We compared wave 1 with wave 2 to assess our
test-retest reliability and stability of the data along with the
pandemic. In particular, we found that the time software
engineers spent doing specific activities from home was overall
comparable when working in the office. Indeed, the working
activities’ rank remained almost the same, e.g., coding >
emails > codereview > networking. Nevertheless, we also
reported some significant mean differences, such a lesser time
dedicated to meetings and breaks and more specification and
documentation. Furthermore, the amount of time people spent
on each activity was not related to their well-being, perceived
productivity, and other variables.
In the remainder of this paper, we describe the related work
in Section II, followed by a discussion about our research
design in Section III. The analysis and related results are
described in Section IV. Implications and recommendations
for software engineers and organizations are then outlined in
Section V. Finally, we conclude this study by outlying future
research directions in Section VI.

judgment and analyzing such data through statistical techniques.
These two sample studies generalize their result on the entire
software engineering population [1], [5].
Content wise, half of the papers are concerned with specific
topics related to working from home, such as security [8],
[27], process [9], work productivity [11], and inclusion [26].
The other half mostly investigated well-being and productivity
while working from home during the pandemic [2], [1], [5]
and productivity-related to projects’ characteristics [4].
It is evident from the few related work that remote working
in software engineering is an under-researched topic. Possibly,
one reason might be that businesses in the IT sector, allowing
software professionals to work from home in a structured way,
are relatively few [28]. Most importantly, to this work, no one
so far analyzed specific working activities while working from
home and how this influences both the perceived productivity
and well-being of software engineers.
III. R ESEARCH D ESIGN
To answer in a reliable and meaningful way our research
questions, we employed a post-positivist epistemological stance,
using a longitudinal design. Carefully recruited software
professionals were asked to complete the same survey twice,
two weeks apart from the others. Unique randomized IDs were
assigned to participants to preserve their anonymity and track
their individual participation across both waves.

Materials. The longitudinal design also allowed us to compute
test-retest reliabilities, rit (i.e., the stability of responses across
two or more time-points), by correlating responses given by
participants at time 1 with those at time 2 (we are using
time and wave interchangeably), which provides additional

information about a scale’s reliability to the commonly used
Cronbach’s alpha [31]. Coefficients close to 0 are undesirable
since they indicate a low association between the two timepoints, suggesting, among others, poor data quality.
Activities. We measured the same 15 activities that were
measured by Meyer et al. [16]. We did this because we
believe they covered most activities and to have a pre-pandemic
comparison group. We asked participants ”During the past week,
how much time did you spend on each task percentage-wise
(%)?” This was followed by the 15 activities (e.g., ”Coding”,
”Email”, ”Bugfixing”) which were rated on a slider-scale
ranging from 0% to 100%. For the activities which might
have been more ambiguous, a brief explanation was added in
brackets such as ”Helping (helping, managing or mentoring
people)”, ”Networking (maintaining relationships)”.
Well-being. We used the Satisfaction with Life Scale [32].
Our Cronbach’s alpha2 values to measure internal consis2 Cronbach’s alpha is a measure of scale reliability. For exploratory research,
using new measurement scales, values above .60 are desirable while for
confirmatory research the threshold is above .70 (and below .95) [33].

To test whether software developers’ activities have changed
during the pandemic, we first compared the time participants
reported to have spent on each of the 15 activities with those
reported by Meyer et al. [16] (first research question). The
results are displayed in Figure 1, as well as Tables III and IV. To
test whether participants in our sample reported spending more
or less of their time on certain activities than the software
developers surveyed by Meyer et al. [16], we performed a
series of one-sample t-tests. For example, we compared the
percentages of participants in our sample at time 1 spend
coding was significantly different from 15%, which is the
percentage reported by Meyer et al. (see Table III, second
column). We performed 15 (activities) × 2 (time points) = 30

3 Because of the large number of comparisons, we adjusted the α-threshold
from .05 to .003 to reduce the risk of false-positive results. This means that
we considered only p-values of < .003 as statistically significant. This is a
standard procedure for studies that involve many variables to ensure reliable
results, e.g., [42]. Note that changing the α-threshold impacts the test statistic
(e.g., t−value), as the test statistic and p-value are perfectly associated with
any given sample size [43]. For example, for an α−threshold of .003 and a
sample size of 192 (time 1) or 184 (time 2), the critical t-values are 3.006 and
3.008. In other words, only if the t−value obtained from a t−test is larger than
3.006 (or 3.008), the p-value would be < .003, and we would consider the test
result to be statistically significant. Note that a Bonferroni-correction would
have resulted in an adjusted alpha-level of .05/30 ≈ .0017, which is overly
conservative and does not consider that some of the variables are correlated
(e.g., between time 1 and 2). Thus, the adjusted significance threshold of .003
seemed appropriate to us, neither overly conservative nor liberal.

they are not linked to their organization or their colleagues, breaks and networking during the second measurement point
since the time spent on networking remained the same. This might indicate that they became more used to their new WFH
condition. Accordingly, professionals learned to spend their

working time more efficiently. Unfortunately, we did not collect
any additional data that might support this point. However,
similar conclusions are supported by the literature [2], [5].
Finally, we did not find any significant results from our
extensive correlation analysis between working activities and
potentially relevant variables (with one exception). This is a
generally positive finding, as it shows that important psychological and social variables have no direct influence on developers’
working tasks while working remotely.
The only significant relation was productivity, which correlated negatively with breaks in wave 1. Despite being
intuitive, we are very cautious about concluding that developers
should take fewer breaks to be more productive since such a
relation was not significant at wave 2 (although still negative).
Regarding the other activities, we conclude that the time
spend on each task does not affect productivity. Similar
considerations can be made with well-being. We did not register
any significant effect on how the amount of time dedicated to
development activities impacts software engineers’ well-being
working from home. We consider this evidence supportive of
an extensive working from home setting since developers’ wellbeing and productivity are not related to individual working
tasks, meaning that organizations can plan working schedules
as remote workers would still work from the office.
Furthermore, the stress in particular, which is an indicator
of burnout [21], seems not to relate with any particular activity,
meaning that none of the performed work tasks are per se
associated with stress. This is reassuring as it suggests that no
activity causes stress, burnout, or lower well-being levels. We
can draw similar conclusions for the other identified variables.
None of the working activities were related to boredom. This
means that while working remotely, developers did not felt
any specific task as dull and demotivating. Previous studies
showed that during the pandemic, it is essential to have daily
routines to improve personal well-being [5]. However, when
it comes to individual activities, routines seem not to play a
significant role. Regardless of how software engineers organize
their day, this does not affect the amount of time they dedicate
to one activity or another. Likewise, possible distractions that
might happen while working from home (e.g., children at
home) does not influence the time spent on work activities.
This is also a very relevant result, as the literature suggests
that distractions play a significant role when working remotely
[1]. Although we do not contradict the conclusion of Ralph
et al., we do report that distractions per se are not related to
developers’ working tasks. Self determination theory measures
innate psychological needs [40], and its three dimensions need
for autonomy, competence, and relatedness are associated with
work motivation in general [44]. To the best of our knowledge,
this study is the first in our community to assess whether
specific activities are correlated with autonomy, competence,
and relatedness. We found overall that psychological needs
were unrelated to people’s specific activities. This means that
developers were not generally unmotivated (or motivated) with
the time spent on the working tasks performed remotely. While
working remotely, quality of communication can be challenging,

as face-to-face communication has to pass through a medium
(e.g., MS Teams, Zoom). Not being directly connected to the
organizations can, therefore, become a big issue for remote
workers. For example, research suggests that lower support
from coworkers and supervisors [20], perceiving the values
of one’s organization to be different to one’s values [19], and
unfair treatment and lack of appreciation [18] are putting the
mental health of remote workers at risk. Interestingly, our
results suggest that the quality of communication does not relate
to individual working activities. This can also be considered
a positive finding, as the time spent by software engineers
for each task is not detrimental to the relations with their
organization.
Prior research has mostly ignored whether activity type
plays a role in professionals’ psychological and social factors.
Typically, scholars only measured whether people are, e.g.,
stressed overall, as opposed to stressed by specific activities [18], [19], [20]. Our research suggests that the type of
activity is not a confounding variable, which increases our trust
in prior research, which has typically looked at subjective work
experience in general rather than actual activities. To conclude,
our findings imply that software engineers’ psychological and
social factors do not matter on what work activity they are
performing, but rather how it is done.
B. Threats to validity
To conclude this section, we briefly address the most relevant
limitations.
Reliability. We investigated our subject matter through a
two-wave longitudinal study. Notably, over 90% of our initial
informants also took part in the second wave. Participants
were identified using a multi-stage selection process to ensure
(i) they are professionally active software engineers, (ii) data
quality, and (iii) that they were working from home during the
lockdown.
Construct validity. To enhance reproducibility, we used the
taxonomy by Meyer et al. [16] to define the daily activities of
software developers. Similarly, we used those benchmarks to
confront it with working from home setting. Also, we report the
Cronbach’s alpha across both waves of ten identified variables,
as well as their test-retest reliability.
Conclusion validity. Our conclusions rely on multiple
statistical analyses, such as one-sample t-tests, paired t-tests,
and Pearson’s correlation. Furthermore, we also ran a nonparametric Spearman’s rank correlations test for our conclusion’s consistency since not all distributions were perfectly
normally distributed. To support Open Science, we made the
replication package in R and our raw data and openly available
on Zenodo.
Internal validity. For this investigation, we used self-reported
measures for well-being, productivity, and other psychological
and social variables, which might be considered a limitation.
However, similar to Meyer et al., our primary focus was to
understand the developers’ perspective of what makes “a good
day” and how individual tasks influence both well-being and
productivity while working from home. The research was

TABLE VII

Working activity distribution WFH compared to a
typical office day.

Overall, the ranking among work activities remains unchanged. However, when WFH developers spend less time
in: Bugfixing (t1 = −5.31, t2 = −3.55), Meetings (t1 =
−9.95, t2 = −6.63), Breaks (t1 = −7.39, t2 = −14.30),
Interruptions (t2 = −5.39), E-Mails (t1 = −3.69),
and more time in Specification (t1 = 4.65, t2 = 4.05),
(t1 = 4.65, t2 = 4.05), Testing (t1 = 3.41, t2 = 3.32),
Administration (t1 = 4.58, t2 = 4.28), Documentation
(t1 = 5.18, t2 = 5.07), Learning (t1 = 4.24, t2 = 3.38).

WFH does not affect the time spent on working tasks
by software developers and the distribution is comparable
to a typical office day. The significant time reduction of
meetings suggest that online-meetings are more time-efficient
than physical ones. Also, professionals seems to be more
focused when working remotely, having fewer interruptions.
This allows them, among others, to dedicate more time in
developing their own skills.

Working activity distribution during the pandemic.

Very high correlation of the group averages of time 1 and 2:
r(13) = .99, p < .0001. Two exceptions were more Breaks
(t = 4.71) and Networking (t = 4.33) at time 1 compared
to time 2.

Developers had a very regular work activity distribution
during the pandemic, which was comparable to their office
day. Fewer breaks and networking might depend that
professionals adapted to the new situations towards the end
of the lockdown, being more time-efficient.

Effects of well-being and
productivity on working
activities while working
from home.

Only the relation between Productivity and Breaks was
significant at time 1 (r1 = −.30, p1 = .00002); at time
2 the correlation was again negative but not statistical
significant (r2 = −.16, p2 = .03).

The time spent by software engineers on individual tasks
while working from home does not affect their productivity
or well-being. In the case of WFH, organizations can plan
work activities as they have done so far.

Influence of psychological and social variables
on working activities while
working remotely.

No significant correlations between any activity and variable
(r < .25, p > .0005).

We could not associate any indicator of burnout, motivation, disengagement, relation to the organization, and selforganization with the activities performed while working
from home. This suggests that WFH is per se, not a burden
for developers.

performed towards the end of the worldwide lockdown in
spring 2020. This enabled our participants to report a more
mature and stable assessment of the new working setting. We
only considered countries with comparable lockdown measures
(e.g., we excluded, among others, Denmark, Germany, and
Sweden as these countries did not face a total lockdown or
had different measures in place in the country’s regions). Thus,
we asked both waves about lockdown conditions in their home
country and if they were still working from home. Since all
selected informants faced comparable conditions, we did not
exclude any of the 192 selected software professionals.

External validity. We designed this study to maximize
internal validity. Therefore, we determined our sample size
with an a priori power analysis. So, we did not work with a
representative sample of the software engineering population
in mind (such as Russo and Stol [29] did, where the research
goal was the generalization of results, surveying over 400
software engineers). However, we recognize having submitted
our surveys in the middle of a very peculiar period. This limits
the extent to which we can generalize our findings in a nonpandemic working from home setting. Notwithstanding, we
also realize that we require fast and reliable evidence regarding
the COVID-19 crisis we are facing right now, improving the
quality of developers’ daily lives. This study will also enable
a better-informed research design for future remote working
studies once this pandemic is over.

VI. C ONCLUSION
This research focused on software engineers’ work distributions during enforced WFH and the association between
single tasks with well-being, productivity, and other social and
psychological variables. To do so, we employed a longitudinal
study design across two waves. We found that developers
still spend proportionally the same amount of time on their
different daily activities. For example, the software engineers
in our sample still spent most of their working time on
coding, bugfixing, meetings, testing, and e-mails, as previously
reported by Meyer et al. [16]. Nevertheless, we found some
significant mean differences. Our participants reported having
spent less time in meetings and breaks, suggesting that both
were less common, possibly due to developers’ adaption of
working remotely. Similarly, no significant relations have been
found between productivity, well-being, and relevant social
and psychological variables with working activities. Based on
our findings, our research suggests that WFH does not per se
presents a challenge for either organizations or developers.
Future research will focus on exploring moderation effects
by investigating whether perceived effectiveness, independence,
and meaningfulness of a task moderate the relation between
each work activity with well-being and productivity and other
relevant variables. Further, more tailored recommendations
based on developers’ persona would provide a more nuanced
understanding of the subject matter since we only considered
average effects in this study.
