Abstract:
We characterize the network of COVID-19 spread in India and find that the transmission rate
is 0.43, with daily case growth driven by individuals who contracted the virus abroad. We
explore the question of whether this represents exponentially decaying dynamics or is simply
an artefact of India’s testing strategy. Testing has largely been limited to individuals travelling
from high-risk countries and their immediate contacts, meaning that the network reflects
positive identifications from a biased testing sample. Given generally low levels of testing and
an almost complete absence of testing for community spread, there is significant risk that we
may be missing out on the actual nature of outbreak. India still has an apparently low current
caseload, with possibly a small window of time to act, and should therefore aggressively and
systematically expand random testing for community spread, including for asymptomatic
cases. This will help understand true transmission characteristics and plan appropriately for the
immediate future.

1. Introduction:
The novel coronavirus COVID-19 has rapidly spread across the world in the early months of 2020,
with the World Health Organization categorizing it as a pandemic [1], leading to unprecedented
measures to contain its spread [2]. India saw its first case of COVID-19 in a student who returned
from Wuhan on January 30, 2020. After three initial cases in 2020 between January 30 and February
3, there were no further cases recorded for a month [3]. Since March 3, however, there has been a
steady uptick of cases and there is a real concern of community spread occurring in India (Fig. 1a) [4].
There also appears to be heterogeneity in the spread of the virus across different states (Fig. 1b) [4].

The key parameter to characterize an outbreak is the transmission rate, which is a measure of the
average number of individuals infected by an individual carrying the virus. A commonly used metric
of transmission is the basic reproductive number 𝑅0 , which is the transmission rate given that the
population has no immunity from past exposures or vaccination, nor any deliberate intervention in
disease transmission [5]. When 𝑅0 > 1, the number of infections grows and spreads in the population,
but not for 𝑅0 < 1. 𝑅0 is generally modelled from data on the spread of the disease, with the
assumption that the dynamic of spread is underway in the community and that the measure therefore
parametrizes the extent of intra-community spread.
In this work, we look at the data on each individual case of COVID-19 infection and attempt to create
the network structure of infections for India. Essentially, we attempt to identify how each individual
was infected - whether the individual carried the infection from abroad (Level 1), or if it was local
transmission in the country from an individual who had been infected abroad (Level 2), or if it was
community transmission between individuals in the country (Level 3). Using this characterization of
individual infections, we create the network of COVID-19 infections in India, and compute the
transmission rate as the average number of neighbours of a node in the network. We also simulate
different scenarios of transmission using a simple Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR)
epidemiology model [6], to highlight potential pathways of spread. The model considers a system of
𝑁 individuals split into 3 compartments at any given time 𝑡: 𝑆(𝑡) is the number of individuals
susceptible to the infection; 𝐼(𝑡) is the number of infected individuals; and 𝑅(𝑡) is the number of
recovered individuals. The model has two parameters: effective contact rate (𝛽) and mean recovery
rate (𝛾) and operates based on a set of three Ordinary Differential Equations:

2. The network of COVID-19 transmission:
We use March 13, 2020 as the date on which significant interventions happened in India to restrict the
spread of disease, including the suspension of almost all visas for tourists entering the country, in
addition to measures adopted by a number of states closing schools and colleges, as well as malls and
movie halls. As of this date, we find that there were 86 cases of individuals who had contracted the
virus, and we were able to identify the sources of infection in 82 of these cases. Because case numbers
in India are still close to 200, we find that newspapers are still tracking individual case histories; and
we use these newspaper reports and Wikipedia to construct the data set on individual transmission [3,
7-27]. Out of these cases, we identified 58 (71%) as Level 1, 23 (28%) as Level 2 or local
transmission, and only one (1%) as Level 3 or community transmission (Fig. 2a).

Figure 2: The mechanisms of viral transmission. a) Evolution of fraction of Level 1 (blue), Level 2 (red), and
Level 3 (green) cases over time reveals that Level 1 remains the most significant transmission mode (until
March 18, 2020). b) Network structure of COVID-19 infections in India until March 13, 2020 reveals that most
transmission has occurred from individuals with recent travel history abroad (node 0).

Based on identification of the sources, we were able to create the network structure of the COVID-19
virus transmission (Fig. 2b), which shows that most cases of infection in India had their sources
abroad (generalized as node 0), and a few of these infected nodes then contributed to local
transmission. We computed the transmission rate of the virus, defined as the average number of
neighbours of a node in the network (except node 0, which simply stands for infection prior to
entering the Indian network), to be 0.43. This is equivalent to the transmission rate of the virus as it is
a measure of the average number of infections caused by an infected individual. There appears to be
an anomaly here with the revealed transmission rate of 0.43 (< 1) indicating that the spread of the
virus should be decreasing, while the data clearly demonstrates that cases are going up from day-to-

day (Fig. 1a). This anomaly is resolved when we assess the network structure, which reveals that a
majority of infections still being identified are those who contracted the virus abroad (71%, Fig. 2),
and this is a trend that continues in network structure even until March 18, when cumulative caseload
was 166.
However, given the international travel restrictions put in place by the Government of India on March
13, we would expect that as their impact starts reflecting in the data by the end of March, and the
number of new cases with Level 1 transmission will tend to zero. One might expect the overall spread
of the disease to show an exponential decline from that point (as depicted in simulations in Figs. 3a
and 3b), but before reaching any conclusions we must consider the all-important question of whether
the data is a reasonable reflection of the true underlying dynamics of the spread of COVID-19 in
India.

Figure 3: SIR model of COVID-19 spread with transmission rate < 1. a) Temporal evolution of caseload based
on the following initial conditions and parameters: 𝑁 = 𝑆(0) = 1,300,000,000; 𝐼(0) = 1000; 𝑅(0) = 0; 𝛽 =
0.086; 𝛾 = 0.2. b) Temporal evolution of caseload based on the following initial conditions and parameters:
𝑁 = 𝑆(0) = 1,300,000,000; 𝐼(0) = 10,000; 𝑅(0) = 0; 𝛽 = 0.086; 𝛾 = 0.2.

3. Issues in testing for community spread:
In countries where the virus has seen community spread, 𝑅0 has been estimated in the region of 2.5 −
3, which indicates exponential growth dynamics [28]. While there is emerging research suggesting a
degree of climate determination in the spread of COVID-19 as well as a correlation with geographical
latitude, these results are very new and need confirmation [29,30]. Therefore, in the absence of
clinching evidence relating to environmental factors, we ask the question of what is driving this
discrepancy in transmission rates between India and other countries experiencing community spread.
To answer this question, we must first turn our attention to testing processes on the ground to identify
cases of COVID-19 in India. It has been widely reported that the testing in India has been focused on
(and limited to) citizens who have travelled from a set of high-risk countries and those who have
come in contact with these cases [31-32]. There has been no systematic testing process in place for

testing the extent of community spread in India [33]. Given this bias in testing, it should be no
surprise that among the observed cases of COVID-19 in the country, a majority are travellers from
high-risk countries and their immediate contacts with local transmission (as reflected in the networks
structure of infections, Fig. 2b). Recently the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) confirmed
that limited testing on community spread had been initiated - 1,020 tests of people without travel
history or contact with infected persons were to be done, though details of the randomization process
in selecting these cases are not available [34]. While this is a start, it must be kept in mind that the
actual network of spread will continue to reflect the same bias until community testing becomes a
significant part of the testing strategy. Consolidated data from ICMR tells us that India has so far
tested a total of 13,486 samples [35], or 10 tests people per million population, which is very low
compared to other countries that have been testing for community spread [36], and creates the risk of
missing such transmission in case it is already underway in the country. India currently has over 200
COVID-19 positive cases, but is yet to hit the kinds of caseload spikes seen in China, the US and
Europe [2]. Given this shrinking window of opportunity and the significant lacuna in testing, India
must, aggressively and systematically, proceed to widen the scope of testing for possible community
transmission immediately. In this context, ICMR has just announced the introduction of tests for
asymptomatic direct and high-risk contacts of a confirmed case [37]. However, given the tremendous
void in testing for community spread so far, there is a need for larger scale random testing of both
symptomatic and asymptomatic cases, in order to better understand the extent of spread in the broader
community.
This is particularly critical because if indeed community transmission is underway in India, we could
see significant proportions of the population being infected by COVID-19 before the epidemic
recedes – we simulate these possibilities for 𝑅0 = 1.5 (which is at the lower end of transmission rates
from global evidence on COVID-19) and 𝑅0 = 2.5 (which is close to the median transmission rate
from evidence so far) and find that with community spread, we could see maximum infection
caseloads of 6% and 23% of the population respectively (Figs. 4a and 4b).

on the following initial conditions and parameters: 𝑁 = 𝑆(0) = 1,300,000,000; 𝐼(0) = 1; 𝑅(0) = 0; 𝛽 =
0.3; 𝛾 = 0.2. b) Temporal evolution of caseload based on the following initial conditions and parameters: 𝑁 =
𝑆(0) = 1,300,000,000; 𝐼(0) = 1; 𝑅(0) = 0; 𝛽 = 0.5; 𝛾 = 0.2.

Epidemic spread models used by the UK and US predict much higher infection rates – with 𝑅0 = 2.4,
they estimate that up to 80% of the population of the US/UK would be infected in the absence of
intervention [38]. Even if we assume that maximum infection load in India peaks at 6%, (about 80
million people) and even if only 5% of these cases are most severe requiring intensive care, this
means that the Indian health system would need to cater for 4 million ICU beds, but it is estimated
that there are only around 100,000 ICU beds in India – or 1 ICU bed for 40 people [39]. Given the
state of the Indian health system, it is essential that we do as much as possible to test randomly for
community spread – both symptomatic and asymptomatic - and attempt to unearth the gravity of
spread in India as soon as possible, especially while the current restrictions on international travel,
closure of places of gathering (schools, colleges, malls, temples, workplaces etc.), household
quarantines, and other social distancing measures that are already in place.
