Abstract: The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pneumonia has posed a great threat to the world
recent months by causing many deaths and enormous economic damage worldwide. The first case of
COVID-19 in Morocco was reported on 2 March 2020, and the number of reported cases has increased
day by day. In this work, we extend the well-known SIR compartmental model to deterministic and
stochastic time-delayed models in order to predict the epidemiological trend of COVID-19 in Morocco
and to assess the potential role of multiple preventive measures and strategies imposed by Moroccan
authorities. The main features of the work include the well-posedness of the models and conditions
under which the COVID-19 may become extinct or persist in the population. Parameter values have
been estimated from real data and numerical simulations are presented for forecasting the COVID-19
spreading as well as verification of theoretical results.

1. Introduction

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that cause illnesses, ranging from the common cold to more serious illnesses
such as Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). The new
coronavirus COVID-19 corresponds to a new strain that has not previously been identified in humans. On 11 March 2020,
COVID-19 was reclassified as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). The disease has spread rapidly from
country to country, causing enormous economic damage and many deaths around the world, prompting governments to
issue a dramatic decree, ordering the lockdown of entire countries.
Since the confirmation of the first case of COVID-19 in Morocco on 2 March 2020 in the city of Casablanca, numerous
preventive measures and strategies to control the spread of diseases have been imposed by the Moroccan authorities. In
addition, Morocco declared a health emergency during the period from 20 March to 20 April 2020 and gradually extended it
until 10 June 2020 in order to control the spread of the disease. In this paper, we report the assessment of the evolution of
COVID-19 outbreak in Morocco. Besides shedding light on the dynamics of the pandemic, the practical intent of our analysis
is to provide officials with the tendency of COVID-19 spreading, as well as gauge the effects of preventives measures using
mathematical tools. Several other papers developed mathematical models for COVID-19 for particular regions in the globe
and particular intervals of time, e.g., in [1] a Susceptible–Infectious–Quarantined–Recovered (SIQR) model to the analysis
of data from the Brazilian Department of Health, obtained from 26 February 2020 to 25 March 2020 is proposed to better
understand the early evolution of COVID-19 in Brazil; in [2], a new COVID-19 epidemic model with media coverage and
quarantine is constructed on the basis of the total confirmed new cases in the UK from 1 February 2020 to 23 March 2020;

2 of 15

while in [3] SEIR modelling to forecast the COVID-19 outbreak in Algeria is carried out by using available data from 1 March
to 10 April, 2020.
Mathematical modeling, particularly in terms of differential equations, is a strong tool that attracts the attention of many
scientists to study various problems arising from mechanics, biology, physics, and so on. For instance, in [4], a system of
differential equations with density-dependent sublinear sensitivity and logistic source is proposed and blow up properties
of solutions are investigated; paper [5] presents a mathematical model with application in civil engineering related to the
equilibrium analysis of a membrane with rigid and cable boundaries; [6] studies nonnegative and classical solutions to
porous medium problems; and [7] a two-dimensional boundary value problem under proper assumptions on the data.
Herein, we will focus on the dynamic of COVID-19. Tang et al. [8] used a Susceptible–Exposed–Infectious–Recovered (SEIR)
compartmental model to estimate the basic reproduction number of COVID-19 transmission, based on data of confirmed
cases for the disease in mainland China. Wu et al. [9] provided an estimate of the size of the epidemic in Wuhan on the basis
of the number of cases exported from Wuhan to cities outside mainland China by using a SEIR model. In [10], Kuniya applied
the SEIR compartmental model for the prediction of the epidemic peak for COVID-19 in Japan, using real-time data from 15
January to 29 February, 2020. Fanelli and Piazza [11] analyzed and forecasted the COVID-19 spreading in China, Italy and
France, by using a simple Susceptible–Infected–Recovered–Deaths (SIRD) model. A more elaborate model, which includes
the transmissibility of super-spreader individuals, is proposed in Ndaïrou et al. [12]. The model we propose here is new and
has completely different compartments: in the paper [12], they model susceptible, exposed, symptomatic and infectious,
super-spreaders, infectious but asymptomatic, hospitalized, recovered and the fatality class, with the main contribution being
the inclusion of super-spreader individuals; in contrast, here we consider susceptible individuals, symptomatic infected
individuals, which have not yet been treated, the asymptomatic infected individuals who are infected but do not transmit
the disease, patients diagnosed and under quarantine and subdivided into three categories—benign, severe and critical
forms—recovered and dead individuals. Moreover, our model has delays, while the previous model [12] has no delays;
our model is stochastic, while the previous model [12] is deterministic. In fact, all mentioned models are deterministic and
neglect the effect of stochastic noises derived from environmental fluctuations. To the best of our knowledge, research works
that predict the COVID-19 outbreak taking into account a stochastic component, are a rarity [13–15]. The novelty of our work
is twofold: the extension of the models cited above to a more accurate model with time delay, suggested biologically in the
first place; secondly, to combine between the deterministic and the stochastic approaches in order to well-describe reality. To
do this, Section 2 deals with the formulation and the well-posedness of the models. Section 3 is devoted to the qualitative
analysis of the proposed models. Parameters estimation and forecast of COVID-19 spreading in Morocco is presented in
Sections 4 and 5, respectively. The paper ends with discussion and conclusions, in Section 6.
2. Models Formulation and Well-Posedness
Based on the epidemiological feature of COVID-19 and the several strategies imposed by the government, with different
degrees, to fight against this pandemic, we extend the classical SIR model to describe the transmission of COVID-19 in the
Kingdom of Morocco. In particular, we divide the population into eight classes, denoted by S, Is , Ia , Fb , Fg , Fc , R and M,
where S represents the susceptible individuals; Is the symptomatic infected individuals, which have not yet been treated; Ia
the asymptomatic infected individuals who are infected but do not transmit the disease; Fb , Fg and Fc denote the patients
diagnosed, supported by the Moroccan health system and under quarantine, and subdivided into three categories: benign,
severe and critical forms, respectively. Finally, R and M are the recovered and fatality classes. This model satisfies the
following assumptions:
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
(5)
(6)

all coefficients involved in the model are positive constants;
natural birth and death rate are not factors;
true asymptomatic patients will stay asymptomatic until recovery and do not spread the virus;
patients who are temporarily asymptomatic are included on symptomatic ones;
the second infection is not considered in the model;
the Moroccan health system is not overwhelmed.

According to the above assumptions and the actual strategies imposed by the Moroccan authorities, the spread of
COVID-19 in the population is modeled by the following system of delayed differential equations (DDEs):

where t ∈ R+ , N represents the total population size and u ∈ [0, 1] denotes the level of the preventive strategies on the
susceptible population. The parameter β indicates the transmission rate and e ∈ [0, 1] is the proportion for the symptomatic
individuals. The parameter α denotes the proportion of the diagnosed symptomatic infected population that moves to the
three forms: Fb , Fg and Fc , by the rates γb , γg and γc , respectively. The mean recovery period of these forms are denoted by
1/rb , 1/r g and 1/rc , respectively. The latter forms die also with the rates µb , µ g and µc , respectively. Asymptomatic infected
population, which are not diagnosed, recover with rate ηa and the symptomatic infected ones recover or die with rates ηs
and µs , respectively. The time delays τ1 , τ2 , τ3 and τ4 denote the incubation period, the period of time needed before the
charge by the health system, the time required before the death of individuals coming from the compartments Is , Fb , Fg , and
Fc , respectively. At each instant of time,

D(t) =: µs (1 − α) Is (t − τ3 ) + µb Fb (t − τ4 ) + µ g Fg (t − τ4 ) + µc Fc (t − τ4 ) =

dM(t)

gives the number of new death due to the disease (cf. [12]).
Remark 1. In system (1), delays occur at the entrances, when the actions of infection take charge or the actions by the health system
begin, and not at exits. Let us see an example. A susceptible individual, after contact with an infected person at instant t, becomes himself
infected at instant t + τ1 . Suddenly, the compartment of the infected is fed at the instant t by the susceptible infected at the instant t − τ1 .
The same operation occurs at the level of the other interactions between the compartments of the model.
Remark 2. We assume that the compartment of symptomatic infected Is does not completely empty at any time t. For this reason, one
has µs + ηs < 1. Note also that the diagnosed symptomatic infected population is completely distributed into one of three possible forms:
Fb , Fg and Fc , respectively by the rates γb , γg and γc . Then, γb + γg + γc = 1.
Remark 3. Biologically, τ3 = 21 days and τ4 = 13.5 days are the time periods needed before dying, deriving from Is and the three forms
Fb , Fg , Fc , respectively. That is why we inserted these delays in the last equation of system (1).
Remark 4. We consider only a short time period in comparison to the demographic time-frame. From a biological point of view, this
means that we can assume that there is neither entry (recruitment rate) nor exit (natural mortality rate), and vital parameters can be
neglected. Note also that in our model, the individuals that die due to the disease are included in the population. Therefore, the total

4 of 15

population is here assumed to be constant, that is, N (t) ≡ N during the period under study. This assumption is also reinforced by the
fact that the Moroccan authorities have closed geographic borders.
The initial conditions of system (1) are
S(θ )
Fb (θ )
R(θ )

= ϕ1 (θ ) ≥ 0,
= ϕ4 (θ ) ≥ 0,
= ϕ7 (θ ) ≥ 0,

Is (θ ) = ϕ2 (θ ) ≥ 0, Ia (θ ) = ϕ3 (θ ) ≥ 0,
Fg (θ ) = ϕ5 (θ ) ≥ 0, Fc (θ ) = ϕ6 (θ ) ≥ 0,
M(θ ) = ϕ8 (θ ) ≥ 0, θ ∈ [−τ, 0],

(3)

where τ = max{τ1 , τ2 , τ3 , τ4 }. Let C = C ([−τ, 0], R8 ) be the Banach space of continuous functions from the interval [−τ, 0]
into R8 equipped with the uniform topology. It follows from the theory of functional differential equations [16] that system
(1) with initial conditions
( ϕ1 , ϕ2 , ϕ3 , ϕ4 , ϕ5 , ϕ6 , ϕ7 , ϕ8 ) ∈ C
has a unique solution. On the other hand, due to continuous fluctuation in the environment, the parameters of the system
are actually not absolute constants and always fluctuate randomly around some average value. Hence, using delayed
stochastic differential equations (DSDEs) to model the epidemic provide some additional degree of realism compared to
their deterministic counterparts. The parameters β and α play an important role in controlling and preventing COVID-19
spreading and they are not completely known, but subject to some random environmental effects. We introduce randomness
into system (1) by applying the technique of parameter perturbation, which has been used by many researchers (see, e.g.,
[17–19]). In agreement, we replace the parameters β and α by β → β + σ1 Ḃ1 (t) and α → α + σ2 B˙2 (t), where B1 (t) and B2 (t)
are independent standard Brownian motions defined on a complete probability space (Ω, F , P) with a filtration {Ft }t≥0
satisfying the usual conditions (i.e., it is increasing and right continuous while F0 contains all P-null sets) and σi represents
the intensity of Bi for i = 1, 2. Therefore, we obtain the following model governed by delayed stochastic differential equations:

Let us denote R8+ = {( x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 , x5 , x6 , x7 , x8 ) | xi > 0, i = 1, 2, . . . , 8}. We have the following result.

Theorem 1. For any initial value satisfying condition (3), there is a unique solution
x (t) = (S(t), Is (t), Ia (t), Fb (t), Fg (t), Fc (t), R(t), M (t))
to the COVID-19 stochastic model (4) that remains in R8+ with a probability of one.
Proof. Since the coefficients of the stochastic differential equations with several delays (4) are locally Lipschitz continuous, it follows from [20] that for any square integrable initial value x (0) ∈ R8+ , which is independent of the considered
standard Brownian motion B, there exists a unique local solution x (t) on t ∈ [0, τe ), where τe is the explosion time. For
showing that this solution is global, knowing that the linear growth condition is not verified, we need to prove that

3. Qualitative Analysis of the Models
The basic reproduction number, as a measure for disease spread in a population, plays an important role in the course
and control of an ongoing outbreak [21]. This number is defined as the expected number of secondary cases produced, in
a completely susceptible population, by a typical infective individual. Note that the calculation of the basic reproduction
number R0 does not depend on the variables of the system but depends on its parameters. In addition, the R0 of our model
does not depend on the time delays. For this reason, we use the next-generation matrix approach outlined in [22] to compute
R0 . Precisely, the basic reproduction number R0 of system (1) is given by

R0 = ρ( FV −1 ) =

βe(1 − u)
,
(1 − α)(ηs + µs ) + α

where ρ is the spectral radius of the next-generation matrix FV −1 with

Noting that the classes that are directly involved in the spread of disease are only Is , Ia , Fb , Fg and Fc , we can reduce the

The characteristic equation of system (7) is given by
P(λ) = (λ − a1 (R0 e−λτ1 − 1))(λ + ηa )(λ + (µb + rb ))(λ + (µ g + r g ))(λ + (µc + rc )),

(10)

where
a1 =

α + (1 − α)(µs + ηs ).

Clearly, the characteristic Equation (10) has the roots λ1 = −ηa , λ2 = −(µb + rb ), λ3 = −(µ g + r g ), λ4 = −(µc + rc ) and the
root of the equation
λ − a1 (R0 e−λτ1 − 1) = 0.
(11)
We suppose Re(λ) ≥ 0. From (11), we get
Re(λ) = a1 (R0 e− Re(λ)τ1 cos( Imλ τ1 ) − 1) < 0,
if R0 < 1, which contradicts Re(λ) ≥ 0. On the other hand, we show that (11) has a real positive root when R0 > 1. Indeed,
we put
Φ(λ) = λ − a1 (R0 e−λτ1 − 1).
We have that Φ(0) = − a1 (R0 − 1) < 0, limλ→+∞ Φ(λ) = +∞ and function Φ is continuous on (0, +∞). Consequently,
Φ has a positive root and the following result holds.
Theorem 2. The disease free equilibrium of system (1), that is, ( N, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0), is locally asymptotically stable if R0 < 1 and
unstable if R0 > 1.
Knowing the value of the deterministic threshold R0 characterizes the dynamical behavior of system (1) and guarantees
persistence or extinction of the disease. Similarly, now we characterize the dynamical behavior of system (4) by a sufficient
condition for extinction of the disease.

4. Assessment of Parameters
Estimating the model parameters poses a big challenge because the COVID-19 situation changes rapidly and from one
country to another. The parameters are likely to vary over time as new policies are introduced on a day-to-day basis. For this
reason, in order to simulate the COVID-19 models (1) and (4), we consider some parameter values from the literature, while
the remaining ones are estimated or fitted.
As the transmission rate β is unknown, we carry out the least-square method [10] to estimate this parameter, based on
the actual official reported confirmed cases from 2 March to 20 March, 2020 [24]. Through this method, we estimated β as
0.4517 (95%CI, 0.4484–0.455). Since the life expectancy for symptomatic individuals is 21 days on average and the crude
mortality ratio is between 3% to 4% [25], we estimated µs = 0.01/21 per day and ηs = 0.8/21 per day. Furthermore, since the
hospitals are not yet saturated and the epidemic situation is under control, we assume that mortality comes mainly from
critical forms with a percentage of 40% for an average period of 13.5 days [25]. Then, we choose µc = 0.4/13.5 per day
and rc = 0.6/13.5 per day. According to [26], the proportion of asymptomatic individuals varies from 20.6% to 39.9% and
of symptomatic individuals from 60.1% and 79.4% of the infected population. The progression rates γb , γg and γc , from
symptomatic infected individuals to the three forms, are assumed to be 80% of diagnosed cases for benign form, 15% of
diagnosed cases for severe form, and 5% of diagnosed cases for critical form, respectively [25]. The incubation period is
estimated to be 5.5 days [27,28] while the time needed before hospitalization is to be 7.5 days [29–31]. Following a clinical
observation related to the situation of COVID-19 in Morocco, an evolution of symptomatic individuals is estimated towards
recovery or death after 21 days without any clinical intervention. In the case when clinical intervention is applied, we
estimate the evolution of the critical forms towards recovery or death after 13.3 days. The rest of the parameter values are
shown in Table 1.

Figure 1. Comparison of the deterministic and the stochastic dynamical behavior with the daily reported cases of COVID-19 in Morocco.

In addition, the last daily reported cases in Morocco [32], confirm the biological tendency of our model. Thus, our
models are efficient to describe the spread of COVID-19 in Morocco. However, we note that some clinical data are far from
the values of the models due to certain foci that appeared in some large areas or at the level of certain industrial areas. We
conclude also that the stochastic behavior of COVID-19 presents certain particularities contrary to the deterministic one,
namely the magnitude of its peak is higher and the convergence to eradication is faster. On the other hand, the conditions in

12 of 15

Theorems 2 and 3 are verified. More precisely, the basic reproduction number R0 = 0.5230 is less than one from 12 May 2020

and σ12 = 1.0609 > 1.0598 =
2(α + (1 − α)(µs + ηs ))
To prove the biological importance of delay parameters, we give the graphical results of Figure 2, which describe the
evolution of diagnosed positive cases with and without delays.

Figure 2. Effect of delays on the diagnosed confirmed cases.

We observe in Figure 2, a high impact of delays on the number of diagnosed positive cases, thereby the plot of model
(4) without delays (τi = 0, i = 1, 2, 3, 4) is very different to that of the clinical data. Thus, we conclude that delays play an
important role in the study of the dynamic behavior of COVID-19 worldwide, especially in Morocco, and allow us to better
understand the reality.
In Figure 3, we present the forecast of susceptible, severe forms of deaths and critical forms, from which we deduce that
COVID-19 will not attack the total population.

In addition, the number of hospitalization beds or artificial respiration apparatus required can be estimated by the
number of different clinical forms. Moreover, we see that the number of deaths given by the model is less than those declared

in other countries [33], which shows that Morocco has avoided a dramatic epidemic situation by imposing the described
strategies.
Finally, we present in Figure 4, the cumulative diagnosed cases, severe forms, deaths and critical forms 240 days from
the start of the pandemic in Morocco. We summarize some important numbers in Table 2, which gives us some information
about the future epidemic situation in Morocco.

6. Conclusions
In this study, we proposed a new deterministic model with delay and its corresponding stochastic model to describe
the dynamic behavior of COVID-19 in Morocco. These models provide us with the evolution and prediction of important
categories of individuals to be monitored, namely, the positive diagnosed cases, which can help to examine the efficiency of the
measures implemented in Morocco, and the different developed forms, which can quantify the capacity of the public health
system as well as the number of new deaths. Firstly, we have shown that our models are mathematically and biologically well
posed by proving global existence and uniqueness of positive solutions. Secondly, the extinction of the disease was established.
By analyzing the characteristic equation, we proved that if R0 < 1, then the disease free equilibrium of the deterministic
model is locally asymptotically stable (Theorem 2). Based on the Lyapunov analysis method, a sufficient condition for the
extinction was obtained in the stochastic case (Theorem 3). Thirdly, and since there is a substantial interest in estimating the
parameters, we applied the least square method to determine the confidence interval of the transmission rate β as 0.4517
(95%CI, 0.4484–0.455). In addition, the rest of the parameters were either assumed, based on some daily observations, or
taken from the available literature. Finally, some numerical simulations were performed to gather information in order to be
able to fight against the propagation of the new coronavirus. In 12 May 2020, the basic reproduction number was less than
one (R0 = 0.5230), which means that the epidemic was tending toward eradication, which is conditional on strict compliance
with the implemented measures. Currently, the consequences of the measures taken against COVID-19 in Morocco encourage
their maintenance to control the spread of the epidemic and quickly move towards extinction.
