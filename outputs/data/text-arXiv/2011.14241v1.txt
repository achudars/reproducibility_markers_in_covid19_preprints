Abstract
For fast development of COVID-19, it is only feasible to use drugs (off label use) or
approved natural products that are already registered or been assessed for safety in previous
human trials. These agents can be quickly assessed in COVID-19 patients, as their safety and
pharmacokinetics should already be well understood. Computational methods offer promise
for rapidly screening such products for potential SARS-CoV-2 activity by predicting and
ranking the affinities of these compounds for specific virus protein targets. The RNAdependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) is a promising target for SARS-CoV-2 drug
development given it has no human homologs making RdRP inhibitors potentially safer, with
fewer off-target effects that drugs targeting other viral proteins. We combined robust Vina
docking on RdRP with molecular dynamic (MD) simulation of the top 80 identified drug
candidates to yield a list of the most promising RdRP inhibitors. Literature reviews revealed
that many of the predicted inhibitors had been shown to have activity in in vitro assays or had
been predicted by other groups to have activity. The novel hits revealed by our screen can
now be conveniently tested for activity in RdRP inhibition assays and if conformed testing
for antiviral activity invitro before being tested in human trials.

Introduction
Since December 2019 and the outbreak of a pneumonic disease called COVID-19 caused by
a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in China, clinicians globally have faced unprecedented
challenges in managing the disease caused by this pandemic virus. There has been a massive
international research effort to discover effective drugs and vaccines for this and other
pathogenic coronaviruses such as SARS and MERS.1-17 Design of potent new coronavirus
drugs is very important for future disease preparedness. However, for COVID-19, it is only
feasible to use drugs that are already registered (off label use) or approved natural products
that been through at least phase 1 clinical trials for safety assessment. These agents can be
used in man quickly, as their safety and pharmacokinetics are well understood.
Computational methods offer considerable promise for rapidly screening such drugs for
SARS-Cov-2 activity by predicting their affinities for relevant virus protein targets. Recent
papers in prominent journals have reported, for example, the application of computational de
novo drug design based on the structures of the SARS-Cov-2 protease. 18-20
The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) is a promising target for SARS-CoV-2 drug
development. It has no host cell homologs so selective RdRP inhibitors should be potentially
safer, with lower risks of off-target effects. Zhu et al., recently reviewed the biochemical
properties of this critical enzyme and cell-based RdRPs assays suitable for high-throughput
screening to discover new and repurposed drugs against SARS-CoV-2.21 Viral RdRP plays a
crucial role in the SARS-Cov-2 replicative cycle. Its active site is highly conserved and
accessible, making it a promising drug target. Notably, all DNA and RNA viruses employ
RdRP proteins for replication and transcription of viral genes and other viral and host factors
(Figure 1), suggesting that computational techniques that prove useful for identifying
repurposed drugs against COVID-19 RdRP should be broadly applicable to other pathogenic
viruses.21

replication by an RdRP inhibitor. Created using BioRender template.

RdRPs share several sequence motifs and tertiary structures amongst all RNA virus types,
including positive-sense RNA, negative-sense RNA and dsRNA viruses. The core structure
of RdRP resembles a right-hand, with palm, thumb and finger domains. Five of the seven
classical catalytic RdRP motifs (A – E) are in the most preserved palm domain, while the
remaining two (F and G) are in the finger domains. Five of the seven classic catalytic RdRP
(A-E) motifs are in the most highly conserved palm domain, while the other two (F and G)
are in finger domain (Figure 2).

The structurally conserved RdRP core and related motifs are important for the catalytic role
of viral RdRP and thus represent potential drug targets. While the criteria for the substrates

differ, all known RdRPs share the same catalytic mechanism. On host cell infection, viral
RdRP participates in formation of the molecular machinery for genome replication by
complexing with other factors. It initiates and regulates the elongation of the RNA strand,
which involves the addition of hundreds to thousands of nucleotides. When incorporated into
the newly synthesised RNA chain, nucleotide analogues such as remdesivir block the RNA
elongation catalysed by RdRP (Figure 2).

In pandemics, computational methods can quickly identify candidate drugs for repurposing,
where speed is of utmost importance. Here we show how a well validated molecular docking

followed by a high throughput molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) drug screening
program can screen a large number of drugs and natural products to produce a short list of
RdRp-inhibiting drug candidates. MDS calculations were used to predict the optimal binding
poses and binding energies for 80 of the top hits from virtual screening on SARS-CoV-2
RdRP. Finally we ranked the top candidates for COVID-19 based on binding affinity and
novelty.

Results and discussion
There have been many computational studies aiming to predict which existing drugs and
natural products may be inhibit the main protease, Mpro, of SARS-Cov-2, but fewer studies
have studied drugs for targeting the viral RdRP. The computational workflow used to
estimate the relative binding affinities of drugs for the RdRP binding pocket are summarized
in Figure 3. The combination of robust Vina docking followed by MDS of the top 80
candidates yields improved performance relative to Vina docking alone.23 The binding free
energies calculated by both computational methods (see Methods) correlated very well
(r2=0.84) and the free energies calculated by the thermodynamic cycle correlate with the Vina
docking scores with r2 = 0.64. The size of the binding site (area 2920 Å2 and volume 5335
Å3) tends to select larger ligands, many of which are quite flexible. Binding energy penalties
due to ligand entropy are likely to be significant. Hence, substantial correlation between the
Vina scores and the binding energies from MMBBSA and thermodynamic cycle are
important because these algorithms treat ligand entropy approximately and in different
ways.24

Figure 3. Computational workflow for repurposing drugs against SARS-Cov-2 RdRP.

The binding energies of the 80 top ranked ligands from the docking calculations are listed in
Supplementary Table 1. The 20 drugs predicted to have the highest binding to RdRp are
summarized in Table 1, together with both their MMPBSA and thermodynamic cycle binding
energies. The high correlation between the two methods of calculating binding free energies
meant that the ranking of the top 20 compounds was very similar when ordered by either
binding free energy estimate. Antiviral drugs, Paritaprevir, Beclabuvir, Remdesivir,
Voxilaprevir, Setrobuvir, Galidesvir, Elbasvir, Ciluprevir, Faldaprevir, and Tegobuvir
account for half of the list. The remaining 10 hit compounds, which include several natural
products, are used to treat a diverse range of afflictions – cancers, infections, cardiac
insufficiency, liver damage, circulatory issues, and parasitic infections. Almost all of the
drugs in the top 20 have relatively large, complex structures and substantial ligand flexibility.
Some have had their in vitro activity against SARS-Cov-2 determined experimentally (Figure
4), further supporting our binding predictions.

Antiviral agents.
The calculated binding energy of several of the antiviral drugs, Paritaprevir and Beclabuvir,
are very similar, within the calculation uncertainties in energies. Several of the top antiviral
agents predicted by this study, have also been identified in other in silico docking studies of
small molecule drugs. This provides a degree of validation that our computational methods
are appropriate and are yielding similar results to the other published studies for some wellstudied antiviral drugs.
Beg and Athar used a homology modelled structure for SARS-Cov-2 RdRP and AutoDock
Vina to rank the binding of a range of antiviral drugs to the RdRP enzyme.25 Paritaprevir,
Beclabuvir, and Favipiravir had some of the highest docking scores. Cozac et al. reported a
combined docking and machine learning study of inhibitors of RdRP from HCV, poliovirus,
dengue virus, and influenza virus.26 They identified Faldaprevir, Vedroprevir, Beclabuvir and
Remdesivir as having good docking scores to SARS-Cov-2 RdRP and predicted viral RdRPs
IC50/EC50 values below 5µM by multiple machine learning classification models. A
homology model for SARS-Cov-2 RdRP and AutoDock was used by Dutta et al. to rank
antiviral drugs for potential use in treating COVID-19 patients.27 One of the most promising

drugs for repurposing was Beclabuvir with a predicted docking score of (-10 kcal/mol) and
IC50 of 50nM, although several other antiviral agents had similar docking scores, e.g.
tegobuvir (-9.7 kcal/mol), dasabuvir (-9.4 kcal/mol), lomibuvir (-11 kcal/mol), setrobuvir ( 10.5 kcal/mol) and dasabuvir (-10.4 kcal/mol). Remdesivir (-7.4 kcal/mol), radalbuvir (-7.4
kcal/mol) and dasabuvir (-6.7 kcal/mol) had significantly lower docking scores. None of
these studies used MDS refinement of docked compounds to improve the estimates of the
binding free energy of the drugs.
Remdesivir has been predicted to be active against SARS-Cov-2 RdRP in several studies.28-30
There is limited in vitro evidence for activity of remdesivir with an IC50 3.7 µM in Vero
cells,31, 32 and recent clinical studies suggest its efficacy in treating COVID-19 infection in
man is limted.33
Elfiki reported two studies aimed at repurposing existing drugs against RdRP.29, 30 In one
study, AutoDock Vina docking, and MDS (50 ns production runs) was used to model viral
RdRp and calculate the binding affinity of several drugs and drug candidates. Existing drugs,
Sofosbuvir, Ribavirin, Galidesivir, Remdesivir, Favipiravir, Cefuroxime, Tenofovir,
Setrobuvir, and Hydroxychloroquine, were all predicted to bind to RdRp. Setrobuvir, YAK,
and IDX-184 had even more favourable binding energies, and four novel derivatives of the
latter drug showed binding to SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. The second study used only docking to
predict the binding of the same drugs to RdRP from SARS-Cov-2, SARS, and HCV. HCV
RdRp had greater binding to the antiviral drugs than did SARS-Cov-2 RdRP, with SARS
RdRP having the lowest affinity as ranked by Vina docking scores.
Ahmed et al. used molecular docking and 100 ns MDS to estimate the relative binding
affinities, interactions, and structure-activity-relationships of 76 prescription antiviral drugs
for RdRp.34 MDS on the best docking candidates showed that remdesivir, raltegravir, and
simeprevir had the best binding free energies, ranging from –32 to –38 kcal.mole. Aouldate et

al. reported virtual screening of 50,000 chemical compounds from the CAS Antiviral
COVID19 database against RdRP.35 They used a combination of 3D-similarity searches,
docking, and 20 ns MDS to rank and select lead compounds and reported one compound
(833463-19-7) that bound well to RdRP.
Banerjee et al. used protein modelling and computational docking techniques to investigate
the effects of common mutations in RdRp, 3CLpro and PLpro sequences of Indian patients.36
Two RdRp mutations occurred in the Indian population with prevalence >5% and these were
analysed as possible targets for repurposed drugs. Docking using Autodock Vina predicted
Elbasvir as the best inhibitor of RdRp in the Indian population, followed by Remdesivir and
Methylprednisolone.

Natural products and analogues.
Given the large degree of interest in repurposing antiviral drugs for use in treating COVID19, natural product hits are of greater interest given their relative novelty. The drug with the
strongest binding affinity to RdRP in our study was the natural anti-helminthic product,
Ivermectin. Ivermectin and other avermectins and milbemycins are broad spectrum
antiparasitic macrocyclic lactones derived from the bacterium Streptomyces avermitilis.
Ivermectin’s mode of action is by enhancing inhibitory neurotransmission by binding to
glutamate-gated chloride channels. Ivermectin has been shown to be effective against several
positive-sense single-strand RNA viruses,37 including SARS-CoV-2,38, 39 and has been
suggested by others as a COVID-19 drug repurposing candidate.40 It has demonstrated broad
in vitro antiviral activity, including against positive-sense single-strand RNA viruses such as
SARS-CoV-2.37 It inhibited replication of SARS-CoV-2 in monkey kidney cell culture with
an IC50 of 2.2 - 2.8 µM.32, 37, 41 It has been predicted to inhibit SARS-Cov-2 RdRP in several
computational studies.42, 43 Parvez et al. used MDS techniques, augmented by very short

MDS to predict the binding affinities of Ivermectin and several other antiviral agents
included in Table 1 to RdRP.43 Janabi et al. also predicted favourable binding energies for
Ivermectin and several milbemycins to RdRp using AutoDock Vina, but without subsequent
simulation of the protein-ligand complexes.42 Figure 5 summarizes the main interactions
between Ivermectin and the binding site of RdRP and the docking pose from the MDS.

Figure 5. LigPlot (left) and hydrophobic protein surface representation (right) of the main
interactions between RdRP and ivermectin.

Kalhor et al predicted digoxin would inhibit the interaction of the RBD domain of the SARSCoV-2 with the ACE2 receptor by but no computation studies other than ours have reported
the possibility of RdRP inhibition by digoxin. However, very recently digoxin was shown to
have potent in vitro antiviral effects against SARS-Cov-2 in Vero cells (IC50 37 nM) and by
virus growth kinetics44 with an IC50 of 190nM in Vero cells.45 The activity of digoxin in

these assays was substantially better than that of chloroquine or remdesivir. Figure 6 shows
the main interactions of digoxin with the RdRP binding site and how the drug binds to the
catalytic cavity. The main interactions are also listed in Supplementary Table 2.

Figure 6. LigPlot (left) and hydrophobic protein surface representation (right) of the main
interactions between RdRP and digoxin.

Silibinin has been predicted to be a potential inhibitor of SARS-Cov-2 RdRP by two
computational docking studies.46, 47 Bosch-Barrera et al. speculated that Silibinin may have
synergistic benefits for treating COVID-19 patients as, apart from its potent antiviral
properties against HCV and HIV, it also combated the cytokine storm that causes major
problems in COVID-19 patients. Silibinin is the subject of clinical trials planned for the near
future. Figure 7 shows the main interactions of Silibinin with the binding site of RdRP and
how it binds to the RdRP catalytic cavity. The main interactions are also listed in
Supplementary Table 2 for reference.

Figure 7. LigPlot (left) and hydrophobic protein surface representation (right) of the main
interactions between RdRP and silibinin.

AutoDock Vina and MDS using the CHARMM forcefield were used by Pokhrel et al. to
predict repurposing of existing drugs and natural products.48 Sirolimus (Rapamycin) was on
the top few hits in their screening and simulation study, suggesting a role for this drug in
treating COVID-19 and it is now the subject of a trial of COVID-19 treatment
(https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04461340). Figure 8 shows the main interactions of
sirolimus and the RDRP binding site, and the binding pose from the MDS.

Figure 8. LigPlot (left) and hydrophobic protein surface representation (right) of the main
interactions between RdRP and Sirolimus (rapamycin).

Carbetocin is a synthetic analogue of the natural hormone, oxytoxin, in which a labile
disulfide bond in the macrocycle is replaced by a thioether. Carbetocin was predicted to be
one of the top 10 inhibitors of RdRp (single chain) by Ahmad et al.49 Their studies showed
stable binding with a docking score of -9.5 kcal/mol with 8 strong hydrogen bonding
interactions with the active site of the enzyme by the Glide docking-scoring function but no
MDS was applied to their hits.49
Eribulin is a fully synthetic macrocyclic ketone analogue of the marine natural product,
Halichondrin B, and is a potent anti-mitotic cancer agent. There are no reports of Eribulin
binding to SARS-Cov-2 RdRP but Machitani et al. suggested its COVID-19 use by virtue of
its known activity against other viral RdRPs.50

Novobiocin was also selected as one of the top five best RdRP binders by Choudhury et al.
using the MoleGro virtual docker software.51.
Ergotamine and related ergot alkaloids have been predicted to be high binders to SARS-Cov2 molecular targets, including the main protease, Mpro. 20 There are a few literature reports of
its binding to the SARS-Cov-2 RdRP enzyme.52 There is an in silico predicted SARS-Cov-2
IC50 of 190µM.53 Figure 9 shows the main interactions between the RdRP active site residues
and ergotamine, and also illustrates the binding pose from the MDS. The interactions are also
listed in Supplementary Table 2.

Figure 9. LigPlot (left) and hydrophobic protein surface representation (right) of the main
interactions between ergotamine and RdRP.

Computational studies on natural products have been reported recently. Singh et al. reported a
computational study of the affinity of plant-derived polyphenols as potential inhibitors of

SARS-CoV-2 RdRp.54 They used AutoDock Vina followed by MDS using Amber to predict
the binding poses and affinities of 100 polyphenols. The top four polyphenols had Vina
binding energies close to –10 kcal/mol, significantly stronger than the predicted binding of
remdesivir.
Wu et al. generated homology models of 18 SARS-Cov-2 viral proteins and two human
targets and used structure-based virtual ligand screening to identify potential inhibitors of
these targets.47 They identified a range of drugs and natural products that their computational
methods suggested may inhibit the RdRP, including beclabuvir.

Other drugs
Bemcentinib selectively inhibits AXL kinase activity, which blocks viral entry and enhances
the antiviral type I interferon response. It has been identified as a potential inhibitor of the
SARS-Cov-2 Mpro enzyme in many computational studies.20 We have not been able to locate
any other published computational publications that suggest that bemcentinib may inhibit the
SARS-Cov-2RdRP. Bemcentinib exhibits useful in vitro activity against SARS-Cov-2 with
Liu et al. reporting 10-40% protection at 50µM in Vero cells.55 It was also reported to exhibit
an IC50 of 100nM and CC50 of 4.7µM in human Huh7.5 cells and an IC50 of 470nM and CC50
of 1.6µM in Vero cells,56 considerably higher activity than that reported by Liu et al. As a result
Bemcentinib is an investigational treatment for COVID-19 (www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu).
Figure 10 shows a LigPlot representation of the interactions of key functional groups in
bemcentinib with RdRP active site residues, and the binding pose of the drug to the enzyme
active site. The interactions are also listed in Supplementary Table 2 for reference.

Figure 10. LigPlot (left) and hydrophobic protein surface representation (right) of the main
interactions between RdRP and bemcentinib.

Computational docking studies identified an unusual arsenic drug, Darinaparsin, as being an
active inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp.57 These researchers performed docking calculations
on 12 arsenical drugs using iGEMDOCK
(http://gemdock.life.nctu.edu.tw/dock/igemdock.php) and AutoDockVina. They screened the
arsenical drugs against several other SARS-Cov-2 drugs and additional several promising
leads. Neither of these computational studies used MDS to simulate the highest scoring
docked structures and calculate more accurate binding energies.

Other novel putative RdRP inhibitors from the short list of 80 drugs

Apart from the drugs discussed above, several other drugs in the Supplementary Table 1 are
of interest. The top 80 list is strongly populated by antiviral drugs such as ciluprevir,
glecaprevir, indinavir, simeprevir, elbasvir and ruzasvir. There are several kinase inhibitors
with good predicted binding affinities to RdRP including imatinib, ponatinib, rebastinib,
lonafarnib, tivantinib and entrectinib. Antibiotics also feature in the list of the 80 best binders
e.g. quinupristin, dalfopristin, rifapentin and erythromycin. Other drugs with binding
energies lower than –25 kcal/mol include hesperidin, eltrombopag (also active against Mpro),
dutasteride, etoposide, quarfloxin, epirubicin, telmisartan, brequinar, conivaptan, rifapentine,
sertindole, itraconazole, vapreotide, bafilomycin A1, bromocriptine, idarubicin, midostaurin
and rutin. As Supplementary Table 1 shows, a substantial percentage of the hits generated by
our docking and MDS protocols have already been shown to have in vitro activity against
SARS-Cov-2, or have been predicted to bind to the SARS-CoV-2 RdRP. Interesting some of
the compounds have also been predicted to bind several other SARS-Cov-2 protein targets
suggesting useful multimodal action that may predict a more potent anti-viral effect. Some
identified drugs have already been tested in patients or are undergoing clinical trials in
COVID-19. For example, ciluprevir inhibits SARS-Cov-2 Mpro with an IC50 of 21 µM,58
indinavir inhibits SARS-Cov-2 with an EC50 >10 µM and CC50 >50 µM (A549-hACE2 cells)
59

and an EC50 of 59 μM and CC50 >81 μM in Vero cells.60 Simeprevir inhibits SARS-Cov-2

in vitro with an EC50 of 4 µM and CC50 19 µM (Vero cells), and exhibits SARS-Cov-2 Mpro
inhibition with an IC50 = 10 µM. 61 Eltrombopag inhibits SARS-Cov-2 in vitro with an IC50
of 8 µM and CC50 >50 µM (Vero cells),62 and an IC50 of 8 µM in Vero and Calu-3 cells. 63
Elbasvir also inhibits SARS-Cov-2 in vitro with an EC50 of 23 µM in Huh7-hACE2 cells.64
Telmisartan is in clinical trials for COVID-19 treatment (NCT04356495).65 Similarly,
brequinar has an experimental SARS-Cov-2 EC50 of 0.3 µM and CC50 > 50 µM in Vero E6
cells,66 while imatinib produces an 80% reduction in Mpro activity at 10 µM, with an EC50 =

8 µM (A549 cells),67 and an experimental SARS-Cov-2 IC50 of 3-5µM, with a CC50 >30
µM,68 Conivaptan also exhibits an IC50 of 10 µM against SARS-COV-2 in Vero cells,69 4µM
in ACE2-A549 cells and a IC50 of ~ 10µM against SARS-Cov-2 Mpro in 293T cells.67
Ponatinib exhibits an experimental SARS-Cov-2 EC50 of 1 µM and a CC50 of 9 µM in HEK293T cells,64 and grazoprevir also shows experimental SARS-CoV-2 inhibition, with EC50 of
16 μM and CC50 of >100 μM in Vero E6 cells.64 Finally, itraconazole has an experimental
SARS-Cov-2 Mpro IC50 of 110 µM70 and SARS-Cov-2 EC50 = 2.3 μM in human Caco-2
cells,71 idarubicin shows weak in vitro Mpro activity with an IC50 of 250−600µM, 72 and
ciclesonide shows an in vitro EC90 for SARS-CoV-2 of 5µM in Vero cells, 0.55µM in
differentiated human bronchial tracheal epithelial cells, blocks viral RNA replication, and
supresses replication of 15 mutants by >90% 62, 73 It is used to treat COVID-19 patients.74
As was demonstrated when we applied the same protocol to repurposing of drugs and natural
products acting against the SARS-Cov-2 main protease, Mpro, our computational methods
generate short targeted lists of existing drugs that may be useful for treating COVID-19.20s As
well as direct antiviral activities, some of the drugs on the hit list may also have synergistic
effects on cytokine storm, clotting disorders, secondary bacterial infections, or pulmonary
function.
These drugs and natural products merit assessment in SAR-Cov-2 assays and RdRP inhibition
experiments.

Conclusions
Our virtual screening approach which applied Autodock Vina and MDS in tandem to calculate
binding energies for repurposed drugs against the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP)
identified 80 promising compounds for treating SARS-Cov2 infections. The top hits from our
study consisted of a mixture of antiviral agents, natural products and drugs with diverse modes

of action. The prognostic value of our computational approach was been demonstrated by our
earlier studies of drugs and natural products against the viral main protease, mPro. Here we
show that the same protocol generates useful predictions of agents against SARS-Cov-2
replication because a substantial number of the diverse range of drugs in the 80 compound
short list exhibit useful SARS-Cov-2 antiviral effects in vitro or have been identified in other
computational studies on RdRP. The antiviral drugs simeprevir, sofosbuvir, lopinavir, ritonavir
and remdesivir exhibit strong antiviral properties and several in in clinical trial or use against
SARS-Cov-2. These drugs have also been identified as binding to RdRP by other virtual
screening studies and by in vitro assays.
Again, this high validation success rate reinforced the view that our virtual screening
protocols were able to identify existing drugs and approved natural products, for rapid testing
in the clinic against COVID-19. The hits may also have activity against other coronaviruses.
The identified drugs may be useful for treating COVID-19 patients and provide a rational
computational basis for repurposing drugs for future pandemics and other diseases.

Materials and Methods
Protein structure preparation and grid preparation
The crystal structure of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp (Figure 11) was downloaded from RCSB
PDB (https://www.rcsb.org/structure/6M71) with a reported resolution of 2.90Å.

Figure 11. 3D structure of SARS-Cov-2 RdRP (PDB refcode 6M71) (left) and position and
shape of binding pocket (right).

Protein preparation, removal of non-essential and non-bridging water molecules,
addition of hydrogen atoms and missing residues and loops for docking studies were performed
using UCSF Chimera package (https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/). 75 AutoDock Tools (ADT)
software was used to prepare the required files for Autodock Vina by assigning hydrogen
polarities, calculating Gasteiger charges to protein structures and converting protein structures
from the .pdb file format to .pdbqt format.76.
Screening databases
Drugs were downloaded from the DrugBank database (Wishart et al., 2018) and CHEMBL
database (FDA approved) (Gaulton et al., 2017). A total of 8773 and 13,308 drugs were
retrieved from Drugbank and CHEMBL database, respectively. The drugs were dowloaded in
sdf format and converted to .pdbqt format using Raccoon (Forli et al., 2016).
Docking Methodology

Small molecule ligand structures were docked against protein structure using the AutoDock
Vina (version 1.1.3) package.76 AutoDock Vina employs gradient-based conformational search
approach and an energy-based empirical scoring function. AutoDock Vina is also flexible,
easily scripted, extensively validated in many published studies with a variety of proteins and
ligands and takes advantage of large multi-CPU or -GPU machines to run many calculations
in parallel. The code has also been employed very successfully to dock millions of small
molecule drug candidates into a series of protein targets to discover new potent drug leads. The
package includes useful scripts for generating modified .pdb files required for grid calculations
and for setting up the grid calculations around each protein automatically. The software
requires the removal of hydrogens, addition of polar hydrogens, setting of the correct atom
types, and calculation of atom charges compatible with the AutoGrid code. The algorithm
generates a grid around each protein and calculates the interaction energy of a probe noble gas
atom at each grid position outside and within internal cavities of the protein. The grid resolution
was set to 1 Å, the maximum number of binding modes to output was fixed at 10, and the
exhaustiveness level (controlling the number of independent runs performed) was set at 8. The
docking employed a genetic algorithm to optimize the binding conformations of the ligands
during docking to the protease site. Drugs were docked individually to the active site of RdRP
(refcode 6M71) with the grid coordinates (grid centre) and grid boxes of appropriate sizes
generated by the bash script vina_screen.sh (Supplementary Information). The top scored
compounds were identified with a python script script1.py (Supplementary Information) and
subjected to molecular dynamic simulation. The docked structures were analysed using UCSF
Chimera 75 and LigPlot+ software77 to illustrate hydrogen-bond and hydrophobic interactions.
A total of fifty top compounds selected from each of the Drugbank and CHEMBL compounds.
Fifteen compounds were common to both database top hits. Molecular dynamics studies were
conducted on the unique set of eighty-five compounds from both sets.

Molecular Dynamics Simulation
The top screened compound complexes with protease were minimized with CHARMm force
field.

The

topology

files

of

the

ligands

were

prepared

from

Swissparam

(http://www.swissparam.ch/) 78 and minimized in Gromacs2020 (http://www.gromacs.org/).79.
Docked complexes of ligands and COVID-19 Mpro protein were used as starting geometries for
MD simulations. Simulations were carried out using the GPU accelerated version of the
program with the CHARMm force field I periodic boundary conditions in ORACLE server.
Docked complexes were immersed in a truncated octahedron box of TIP3P water molecules.
The solvated box was further neutralized with Na+ or Cl− counter ions using the tleap program.
Particle Mesh Ewald (PME) was employed to calculate the long-range electrostatic
interactions. The cut-off distance for the long-range van der Waals (VDW) energy term was
12.0 Å. The whole system was minimized without any restraint. The above steps applied 2500
cycles of steepest descent minimization followed by 5000 cycles of conjugate gradient
minimization. After system optimization, the MD simulations was initiated by gradually
heating each system in the NVT ensemble from 0 to 300 K for 50 ps using a Langevin
thermostat with a coupling coefficient of 1.0/ps and with a force constant of 2.0 kcal/mol·Å2
on the complex. Finally, a production run of 20 ns of MD simulation was performed under a
constant temperature of 300 K in the NPT ensemble with periodic boundary conditions for each
system. During the MD procedure, the SHAKE algorithm was applied for the constraint of all
covalent bonds involving hydrogen atoms. The time step was set to 2 fs. The structural stability
of the complex was monitored by the RMSD and RMSF values of the backbone atoms of the
entire protein. Calculations were also performed for up to 100 ns on few compounds to ensure
that 20ns is sufficiently long for convergence. Duplicate production runs starting with different
random seeds were also run to allow estimates of binding energy uncertainties to be
determined.

The binding free energies of the protein‐protein complexes were evaluated in two ways.
The traditional method is to calculate the energies of solvated SARS-Cov-2 protease and small
molecule ligands and that of the bound complex and derive the binding energy by subtraction.
ΔG (binding, aq) = ΔG (complex, aq) – (ΔG (protein, aq) + ΔG (ligand, aq)

(1)

We also calculated binding energies using the molecular mechanics Poisson Boltzmann surface
area (MM/PBSA) tool in GROMACS that is derived from the nonbonded interaction energies
of the complex. The method is also widely used method for binding free energy calculations.
MMPBSA calculations were conducted by GMXPBSA 2.180 a suite based on Bash/Perl
scripts for streamlining MM/PBSA calculations on structural ensembles derived from
GROMACS trajectories and to automatically calculate binding free energies for protein–
protein or ligand–protein. GMXPBSA 2.1 calculates diverse MM/PBSA energy contributions
from molecular mechanics (MM) and electrostatic contribution to solvation (PB) and non-polar
contribution to solvation (SA). This tool combines the capability of MD simulations
(GROMACS) and the Poisson–Boltzmann equation (APBS) for calculating solvation energy
(Baker et., 2001). The g_mmpbsa tool in GROMACS was used after molecular dynamics
simulations, the output files obtained were used to post-process binding free energies by the
single-trajectory MMPBSA method. In the current study we considered 100 frames at equal
distance from 20ns trajectory files.
Specifically, for a non-covalent binding interaction in the aqueous phase the binding
free energy, ΔG (bind,aq), is: –
ΔG (bind,aqu) = ΔG (bind,vac) + ΔG (bind,solv)

(2)

where ΔG (bind,vac) is the binding free energy in vacuum, and ΔG(bind,solv) is the solvation
free energy change upon binding: –

ΔG (bind,solv) = ΔG (R:L, solv) - ΔG (R,solv) - ΔG (L,solv)

(3)

where ΔG (R:L,solv), ΔG (R,solv) and ΔG (L,solv) are solvation free energies of complex,
receptor and ligand, respectively.
Note added in proof
As we noted in a previous SARS-Cov-2 drug repurposing paper targeting the main protease,20
Guterres and Im showed how substantial improvement in protein-ligand docking results could
be achieved using high-throughput MD simulations.23 Over 56 protein targets (of 7 different
protein classes) and 560 ligands this showed a 22% improvement in the area under receiver
operating characteristics curve, from an initial value of 0.68 using AutoDock Vina alone to a
final value of 0.83 when the Vina results were refined by MD.
