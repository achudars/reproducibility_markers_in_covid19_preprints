We study the increases of infections and deaths in Sweden caused by COVID-19 with several
different models: Firstly an analytical susceptible-infected (SI) model and the standard susceptibleinfected-recovered (SIR) model. Then within the SIR framework we study the susceptible-infecteddeceased (SID) correlations. All models reproduce well the number of infected cases and give similar
predictions. What causes us deep concern is the large number of deaths projected by the SI and SID
models. Our analysis shows that, irrespective of the possible uncertainty of our model prediction,
the next few days can be critical for determining the future evolution of the death cases.

INTRODUCTION

II.

The fast spread of COVID-19 (nearly 1M infected cases till
April 2nd, 2020) has caused wide concern. Within the basic
research community, quite a few mathematical and physical
models have been proposed [1–4] to study the evolution of
the infected cases, aiming to make reliable predictions and to
help the governments to make proper strategic preparedness
and response plans. We deem it is of special importance to
study the COVID-19 spreading in Sweden where, unlike other
countries, the government is taking a rather relaxed strategy
with no massive testing on suspected individuals and no strict
lockdown in her most affected regions.
We start by introducing the SIR (susceptible-infectedrecovered) model which is widely used for virus spreading predictions [5, 6]. It consists of a system of three time-dependent
variables:
• Infected cases (number of total infected individuals at
given time), I(t).
• Susceptible cases (number of individuals susceptible of
contracting the infection), S(t).
• Recovered cases (cumulative number of recovered individuals), R(t).

One has in total N = S(t) + I(t) + R(t). Above quantities
satisfy the following non-linear differential equations
dS

dI
= λSI − βI

and the exposed cases (individuals who are already infected
but asymptomatic)
dE
= λSI − σE
dt

If the recovery rate is very low during the pandemic time
interval (as it is indeed the case for COVID-19 upto now), we
can well approximate the infected cases by
dI
≈ λ [(N − I(t)] I(t)
dt

(3)

(4)

with initial value I(0) = 1. For such SI model, the solution
can be derived analytically,
I(t) =

N
1 + (N − 1)e−λN t

(5)

This function is known as Woods-Saxon form in nuclear
physics and is widely used describing nuclear potential and
matter distribution. We can write it in a more general form
by introducing one more parameter as
For such SI model, the solution can be derived analytically,
I(t) =

N
1+

e(t0 −t)/d

(6)

where d describes the diffuseness.
We apply above formula to study the reported cases in Sweden as a function of time in Fig. II.
We firstly assume that the death cases follow the same
Woods-Saxon form
D(t) =

where λ is the transmission rate, β the recovery rate. They
can be parametrized using known infection data.
It should be straightforward to extend the models to include
deceased cases in the form
dD
= νI
dt

THE SI MODEL

D0
1 + e(t1 −t)/dd

(7)

where the three parameters can be fitted separately to reported
data by taking into account the time interval between infection
and death dates. The result is given in Fig. 2. We should
emphasize that the uncertainty in the model is very large due
to the limited data available. We were very optimistic when
we first derived the curve from data back by two days which
was very different with modest increases, as can be seen in Fig.
3.
The above Woods-Saxon function seems to agree rather well
with the data on reported COVID-19 death cases from China
where the pandemic period may be expected to be over. It
may, however, not expected to work well within the late stage
of the pandemic period when the total infected cases show a
saturation behavior. Therefore we insert Eq. (6) to Eq. (3)
to see if we can get a better estimation on D. The integral of
I(t) reads

Therefore, we can propose a second form for the evolution of

The result is given in Fig. 4 where a modest increase is predicted. However, again, the data from the last two days show
significant deviation from the predicted curve. New data from
the next few days can be critical in pining down the uncertainty in the predicted behavior.

THE SIR MODEL

We now include the recovery cases in above SI model. There
is no analytical solution but the evolution of the SIR quantities
can be done numerically. The result as of April 01 is given in
Fig. 5

IV.

THE SID MODEL

What we can see from above simulation is that the recovery
rate will remain very low during the expected pandemic time
interval. Instead we now include the reported death cases in
above SIR model by replacing the quantity R with D. The
result as of April 01 is given in Fig. 6. The projected death
cases are again very large and are more than 3000.

V.

REMARKS AS OF APRIL 02

Our simulations show that all SI, SIR, SID models describe
well the reported infected cases show rather modest increase
in the near future which is very promising. However, the projected deceased cases in both SI and SID models are extremely
high even though the uncertainty is astonishingly large. We
deem it urgent to explore the uncertainty of our model. The

new data from the future few days can be critical for confining
the predicted curve on decreased cases. If the model is correct, one should worry that the infected cases in Sweden may
be much much higher than it is reported today and a massive
testing on exposed and suspicious cases may be urgent.
