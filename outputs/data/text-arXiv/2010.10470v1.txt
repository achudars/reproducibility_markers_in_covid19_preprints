Behavioral gender differences are known to exist for a wide range of human activities including the
way people communicate, move, provision themselves, or organize leisure activities. Using mobile
phone data from 1.2 million devices in Austria (15% of the population) across the first phase of
the COVID-19 crisis, we quantify gender-specific patterns of communication intensity, mobility, and
circadian rhythms. We show the resilience of behavioral patterns with respect to the shock imposed
by a strict nation-wide lock-down that Austria experienced in the beginning of the crisis with severe
implications on public and private life. We find drastic differences in gender-specific responses
during the different phases of the pandemic. After the lock-down gender differences in mobility and
communication patterns increased massively, while sleeping patterns and circadian rhythms tend to
synchronize. In particular, women had fewer but longer phone calls than men during the lock-down.
Mobility declined massively for both genders, however, women tend to restrict their movement
stronger than men. Women showed a stronger tendency to avoid shopping centers and more men
frequented recreational areas. After the lock-down, males returned back to normal quicker than
women; young age-cohorts return much quicker. Differences are driven by the young and adolescent
population. An age stratification highlights the role of retirement on behavioral differences. We find
that the length of a day of men and women is reduced by one hour. We discuss the findings in the
light of gender-specific coping strategies in response to stress and crisis.

INTRODUCTION

Gender differences exist for a wide spectrum of human
behavior. Behavioral differences are manifest in communication behavior, visible for example in the different investment in biological offspring across women and
men’s lifetimes [1]. Gender differences in mobility patterns do rise from a mix of cultural, infrastructure, resource, safety and socio-economic factors [2]. Psychological and cognitive and other non-reproductive differences
have been studied for many decades maybe even centuries, see e.g. [3]. Also differences in stress perception
and respective coping mechanisms have been known to
exist for a long time [4, 5]. Non-reproductive biological differences include women having shorter circadian
rhythms [6] and showing different co-morbidity patterns
than men across their lifetimes [7]. Even in virtual societies of online game players strong behavioral gender
differences were found. In particular, male and female
players tend to behave differently in economic activities,
their dealing with aggression and hostilities, and generally how they structure their social networks [8].
In the last two decades it became possible to collect
data on human behavior on a population-wide scale, see
e.g. [9]. Some of that data has been used to investigate
human responses to crisis and emergency situations [10–
13]. Studying collective response to crisis is essential for

catastrophy planning and coordination [14, 15] and policy
makers in health and safety [16]. Response to crisis also
reveals human qualities that only surface when facing
different kinds of actual or perceived danger [4, 13, 17,
18].
Times of stress may change social norms and typical
behavior. It is a priori not clear if and how these changes
increase or decrease behavioral gender differences. One
the one hand one might speculate that stress leads to
a more universal behavior, where gender differences become less important and thus less pronounced [19]. On
the other hand one might also find signs of some types of
evolutionary benefit if gender differences are amplified to
cope better with crisis [4, 20, 21]. Population-wide stress
can be seen as a shock to the system and The COVID19 crisis serves as a natural experiment to investigate the
impact of population-wide stress and its consequences for
gender-specific changes in behavior.
The natural experiment can be used to measure the
resilience of behavioral changes, i.e. how long it takes
after the onset of a well-defined shock to get back to
pre-crisis patterns of behavior. This characteristic time
might also be important for a better objective understanding of temporal psychological effects of emergencies,
which are usually studied using self-reported data at few
or single points in time [4, 5, 17, 20].
At the end of 2019 the SARS-CoV2 virus emerged in
China, causing an ongoing, world-wide pandemic. In response to sharply rising numbers during the “first wave”,
on March 15th the Austrian government introduced a
severe nation-wide lock-down. The implemented non-

2
pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) included: school
closures, restaurant closures, mandatory use of masks,
incentives to use home-office, the complete prohibition of
gatherings of any size, closure of all non-essential shops,
and a general limitation of mobility. It was only possible to leave the house for one of four reasons: work
that cannot be postponed, shopping for groceries, helping people and short walks [22]. These measures led to
a massive reduction of mobility as measured for example with cell-phone data [23], or traffic counts [24]. The
lock-down had severe consequences on public life: 58%
of Austrians who were in employment or self-employed
reported that they were employed in a company which
introduced home-office to some extent[25], the number
of people registered unemployed increased by 76% [26],
more than 1,300,000 persons were temporarily laid off
[27], and public life, such as theaters, cinemas, restaurants, bars, shopping-malls and even large parks, was
shut down.
The uncertainty of the situation, especially the threat
of job-loss and additional childcare duties caused a lot of
stress and anxiety in the Austrian population [28]. Right
from the start this lead to the apprehension that women
could be affected more by the lock-down due to additional childcare duties [29–31], domestic violence [32],
employment in high exposure jobs and simultaneously
higher unemployment [31]. Austrian women were more
affected by unemployment and partial layoffs [26], surveys registered an increase of domestic violence [33] and
female scientists posted less pre-prints and started less
projects [30]. The fact that men and women react differently to stress and crises is not new. Women experience
more stress [4, 34] and employ more active and problemfocused coping strategies [4, 5], while men tend to emotional avoidance and emotional coping mechanisms[4].
In this paper we want to understand the effects of the
COVID-19 crisis on behavioral gender differences in five
directions: Changes in communication patterns, changes
in mobility, changes in food supply, changes in spending
leisure time and changes in circadian rhythms as seen in
digital traces. To this end we use longitudinal, nationwide telecommunication data of 1.2 million cell-phones,
covering about 15% of the entire Austrian population.
The anonymized data covers the time period across the
government interventions from February 1st to June 29th .
We split the observation time into 6 periods that characterize the different stages of the pandemic and the response to it. To relate behavioral changes to different
phases of life, we stratify our results with respect to age.
From this data we extract gender-specific features about
communication patterns, such as the average interaction
duration and the number of calls for all possible gender
combinations of calling and being called. The data further allows us to characterize mobility. From location
data we estimate the number of people shopping for food
and the usage of recreational areas. Finally, we estimate

FIG. 1: Population-wide response to the COVID-19 crisis.
The maps show the mobility (radius of gyration, RG ) for calendar week (A) 10 and (B) 12 for Austria. The timeseries
below outline the changes in (C) RG , (D) the call duration
per call t̄, and (E) the number of calls per device Nc . During
the lock-down mobility was drastically reduced throughout
Austria. The call duration per call t̄ increased dramatically
and the number of calls, after a brief increase around the beginning of the lock-down, dropped below the pre-lock-down
level.

circadian activity of telecommunication and internet usage, from which we estimate e.g. gender differences in
sleeping patterns.
Telecommunication data has been used before to study
the effect of crisis and emergencies [10, 15, 35]. They were
used to detect crisis [35], study communication patterns
subsequent to different emergencies [10], predict movement, e.g. subsequent to the Haiti earthquake 2010 [11],
and to help explain the spread of SARS-CoV-2 [15].
Gender differences in human mobility and communication have been reported in [1, 2]. In [1] changes in
communication behavior across age and gender were reported and how reproductive investments and preferred
relationships of both sexes shift over a lifespan. It is well
known that males tend to have a workplace further away
from home and thus generally move more, see e.g. [36].
Gender differences in mobility in Santiago de Chile are
reported in [2]. There, significantly different movement
behavior is found which is interpreted as an interplay
of socio-economic and urban factors. The gender specific behavioral response to seven terrorist attacks in six
cities is investigated in [21]. They compare mobile phone
communication patterns in response to the attacks and
report significant differences between the genders.

Figure 1 shows the effects of the lock-down. A reduction of mobility in the districts of Austria occurs from
before the lock-down (panel A) to right after it (panel
B). As a measure for mobility we use the median radius
of gyration, RG , see Methods in SI Text S3. RG captures
the time weighted, spatial extent of an individuals trajectory. We observe a decrease of RG between 59% and
14%. Panel C shows the time evolution of RG , averaged
over all districts. After a sharp decline of almost 50% in
phase III a rebound to almost pre-crisis levels is seen. In
panel D we observe a more than 60% increase of call duration per call, t̄. For a definition, see Methods, SI Text
S3. Panel E shows a brief increase of the number of calls
per person, Nc , in the days just before the lock-down
(phase II) followed by a 10% decrease. We now stratify
these changes with respect to gender and age.

As proxies for the strength of social interactions we
first analyze the call duration per pair of interaction partners, t̄gh (t), the number of calls, Ncg (t), and the number
of calling partners per user, k g (t), see Methods in SI Text
S3. The superscripts indicate gender, g represents the
gender of the caller h is the gender of the called.
Figure 2 depicts the situation over time. In panel A
we see a massive increase of calling times for the different
gender combinations in phase II and the beginning of III.
For the female-female calls we observe an increase of up
to 140%, female-male and male-female rise by up to 81%
and 97%, respectively, and male-male calls increase up to
66%. We find that calls involving women are generally
longer than those involving men. Moreover, the call time
increase is larger when women are involved.
Calling times decrease gradually and reach pre-crisis
levels in phase VI. This decay can be fitted with an exponential function. The exponents of the fits translate
into corresponding “half-life” times, which are t1/2,mm =
15.9d for male-male and t1/2,f f = 17.3d for female-female
interactions, the mixed interactions have half-life times of
t1/2,mf = 15.5d and t1/2,f m = 14.5d for male-female and
female-male interactions, respectively. For details, see

FIG. 3: Gender ratios of communication and mobility for different age cohorts. The gender ratio of (A) the median call
duration t̄ and (B) the radius of gyration, RG , is seen. In
III the RG gender ratio of young cohorts is shifted towards
women moving significantly (p ¡ 0.001) less, while for old cohorts it is shifted towards a more balanced value. In the same
period, for all cohorts except 75+, the gender bias for the call
duration increases towards women that have a higher call duration.

SI Text S4. Call times show a pronounced bias towards
female initiated calls being longer. In phase I, female
originated calls were 10% longer than male originated,
and up to 30% longer on weekdays in phase III. From
its maximum in phase III, the gender ratio continuously
declines to normal levels in phase V, see Supplementary
Fig. 15 A.
The age profile for the median call duration is relatively flat for the adult and senior age cohorts and has
very low values for the youngest cohort. The call duration increases slightly for the two youngest, but strongly
for the two oldest cohorts. For a visualization, see Supplementary Fig. 17. The gender ratio in call duration
is biased towards women for all ages during the crisis,
as seen in Fig. 3 A. Notably, the age cohort 15-29 is
the only cohort having a more balanced call duration on
weekends. For all other cohorts gender differences are
increased on weekends. Around the beginning of phase
III, the ratios for all except the 75+ cohort reach a maximum. The 75+ cohort reaches a maximum of the gender
imbalance in phase IV.
In Fig. 2 B we show the number of calls, Ncg , for male
and female generated calls. After a short increase in calls
in phase II (female: +13%, male +6%) we see a significant drop in calls in phase III (both -9%), which never
reaches pre-lock-down levels in the observation period. It
stabilizes at a level of -5% and -4% of the previous level
for women and men, respectively. There are only small
gender difference in the number of calls. For a discussion
see SI Text S5.
In Fig. 2 C we show the timeseries for the number of
different communication partners, k g , i.e. the degree of
men and women in their communication networks. After
a brief rise (up to 8% and 13% for men and women,
respectively) in phase II, k g falls below its pre-crisis level
(-3% and -2%). In phases IV and V k g rises to values
higher than the initial values in phase I. In phase VI kg
is about 4% higher for men and 2.5% higher for women.
During normal times (phase I) we find that men have
a slightly higher average degree (communication partners) on weekdays (f/m ratio 95%, men 1.6, women 1.55
unique contacts per day), while on weekends it is more
or less balanced (women and men 1.4). In phase II, kg is
increased for both genders to a maximum around 1.73,
with an increasingly smaller gender bias. In phase III
the degree drops below pre-crisis levels, but men reduce
k g stronger, resulting in a smaller gender divide in phase
III (96%). From phase IV onward, the degree slightly increases (even above pre-crisis levels: men 1.7 and women
1.6), even stronger for men, hence resulting in an increased gender divide (less than 94%). Supplementary
Fig. 16 C shows the age dependence of the gender ratio for the degree. Again, there is a weekend trend towards women. They have more communication partners
on weekends, except for the 15-29 age cohort. The gender
ratio increases in phase III for all age cohorts.

FIG. 4: Mobility quantified by RG . The upper panel shows
RG for men (blue) and women (pink). The lower panel depicts
the gender ratio, rRG , over time. We observe a large drop in
RG for both genders in phase III and a drop in gender ratio
in phases III (lock-down), IV, and V (lock-down eased).

Call duration increases much more than the number
of calls decreases, regardless of gender. This is visible
in Fig. 1 D and E. Just in phase II there is a drastic
rise in both, call time per call, and the number of calls.
The concentration of communication partners is higher
for females and increases during crisis. The bias is also
shifted towards men having more communication partners in phase VI. All proxies indicate a strengthening of
individual contacts and a focus on important contacts.
Gender ratios of different phases are compared with a
two-sided Mann-Whitney-U test and reject the null hypothesis that they are from the same distribution. The
results of the significance tests are presented in SI Text
S6 for all age groups, separated into weekdays and weekends.

Mobility

In Fig. 1 C we see the overall decline of mobility in
terms of the radius of gyration, RG . Austrians move
drastically less during the lock-down, start to move again
when the first easing occurs in mid April, and return back
to normal in phases V and VI. Figure 4 A shows RG for
f
m
the two genders, RG
(red) and RG
(blue). The genderf
m
ratio, defined as rRG = RG /RG is depicted in panel B.
The female population is moving less than males in precrisis times (phase I), as seen in the ratio rRG of 78% on
weekdays and 88% on weekends. After a brief transition
period II the Weekday ratio drops to around 73% during
the lock-down phase III, while on weekends the ratio remains at initial levels. In phase IV, once restrictions were
lifted, RG for males returns back to normal more quickly
than for females, hence decreasing the gender ratio further down to 67%. The ratio starts to recover towards
pre-crisis levels starting from phase V onward, once the
main restrictions were lifted. When fitting the RG curves
as they converge to pre-crisis levels after the lock-down,
we report a half-life time for men of tm
1/2 = 34.8d, and
tf1/2 = 36.0d for women. For details of the fitting, see SI
Text S2.
The changes in gender ratios of RG are significant be-

5
tween the phases. For the significance tests, see Supplementary Tab. V in SI Text S6. Especially the changes
from phase I to the subsequent phases and from III to
phase IV are indeed highly significantly. We find similar
results if we replace the radius of gyration by an alternative measure for mobility that is inspired by entropy,
f /m
Si . It is presented and discussed in SI Text S7.
In Fig. 3 B we show the age-stratification of the
gender-ratios. Before the crisis we observe very different gender ratios for different ages. Generally the ratio
decreases with increasing age. For the young cohort of
15-29 years, the weekday-ratio is above 90%. For the two
age cohorts above the average age of first childbirth1 , 3044 and 45-59, the ratio is reduced to about 83%. For the
age cohorts of retirement, 60-74 and 75+, gender disparity becomes even more biased towards men with a ratio
of about 70%. In phase III, the three younger cohorts
show an overall trend of increasing gender biases. For
the age cohort 45-59, this trend is much less pronounced.
Strikingly, the effect is reversed for the retirement cohorts where the gender ratio changes from around 70%
to more than 80%, which again decreases towards precrisis levels in phase IV. The ratio for the old cohorts
returns much more quickly to pre-crisis values than all
the younger ones, which do not return to the previous
values until the end of the observation period. We do
not observe large differences in half-life times across gender, but t1/2 is much smaller for older cohorts. For all
cohorts we find values between t1/2 = 38.8d for 15-29
year old women to t1/2 = 28.8d for 75+ year old men.
For more details, see SI Text S2. For the corresponding
statistical tests, see SI Text S6.
For the radius of gyration, we can compare it with data
of the previous year (2019) along the same time period.
We find that in 2020, during the lock-down phase, there
is less than 40% of the movement than in 2019, see SI
Text S8.

Basic provisioning

In SI Fig. 22 A we show the number of unique devices
as a proxy for the number of people at a shopping center
across the lock-down. We count the number of unique
subscribers in a specifically defined area, see SI Text S3
for the exact definition. In panel B the corresponding
gender ratio is shown. The shopping center is the largest
of its kind in Austria and one of the largest in Europe.
It is a cluster of 359 shops spread over an area of 670,000
m2 . Shops sell a wide range of products, including sports
equipment, garments, furniture and electronics. It is visited by more than 20 million visitors each year from Vi-

enna and its hinterland, especially in the south, as well
as from Hungary and Slovakia. There are also 14 shops,
including supermarkets, drug stores and pharmacies that
were not affected by the lock-down.
The visiting patterns of the shopping center in phase I
show a pronounced weekly periodicity with a maximum
on Saturdays and very few visitors on Sundays, when all
stores except cinemas and restaurants are closed. The
gender ratio in phase I is close to one, indicating gender balance. In phase III the shopping complex was shut
down to a large extent. No businesses other than stores
for basic provisioning were allowed to open. Nevertheless
we find a small number of visitors that we account mainly
to persons shopping for food and drugs. The gender ratio
in phases III and IV is clearly male-dominated (see Fig.
22 B and for p-values, see SI Tab. VII in SI Text S10).
In phase V, when shops were allowed to re-open, visitor
numbers rose to pre-crisis levels at the beginning of the
week, however without the strong peaks on Saturdays.
The gender ratio returns to a balanced situation; compare with SI Tab. VII. For a comparison with the same
period in 2019 we refer to SI Text S9.

Leisure activities

In SI Fig. 24 A we count the numbers in a popular recreational area nearby Vienna, the Kahlenberg, frequented mainly for walks, and easy hikes. The number of
visitors does not drop in phases II–V, but increases with
the usual seasonal trend from March to June. For a comparison with the situation in the year 2019, see SI Text
S11. We find more visitors on weekends and on days with
good weather, explaining the high variance in numbers.
The gender ratio is biased towards women during phase
I, which changes in phase III, where we find a more balanced gender ratio. Interestingly, the gender ratio does
not return to pre-crisis values after the lock-down, see SI
Fig. 24 B. The corresponding statistical tests are found
in SI Tab. VII in SI Text S10.

Circadian rhythms

We compare aggregated phone network traffic across
the 24 hours of a day for women and men, to estimate
gender differences in circadian rhythms. For definitions,
see SI Text S3. Figure 5 A and B show the call time
per hour for the last Wednesday in phase I and the first
Wednesday during the lock-down. The maximum activity shifts from the late afternoon to the morning hours.
The average full-width-quarter-maximum (FWQM) captures the length of the daily activity period. We find
that the FWQM is reduced by approximately 53 minutes
from 14h33min in phase I to 13h40min in phase III. The
results are displayed in panel C. We do not find a signif-

findings is again shown with a two-sided Mann-Whitney

confirms that ∆F M is indeed lower in phase III.
Qualitatively we find the same behavior for the sum of

The reductions in lengths of day range from 40 minutes
for the downloaded gigabytes to 60 minutes for the number of calls. For the corresponding analyses, see SI Text

activity period is approximately 45 minutes shorter during
the lock-down. A reduction in ∆F M means that circadian
rhythms of men and women become more synchronized.

icant change in the gender ratio of the activity FWQM
(Mann-Whitney U, p > 0.05).
To capture the shift of the activity of men and women
to different times of the day, we calculate the normalized
cumulative functions of the call duration, as shown in
Fig. 5 C and D, thereby correcting for different total
activity. Following [21] we compare gender differences by
calculating the area between the curves ∆F M , see Fig. 5
C by the gray shaded area, see Methods in SI Text S3. A
large (small) value indicates that the activity of men and
women takes place at different (the same) times of day.
We find that ∆F M reduces by 25% from phase I to phase
III. The values for FWQM and ∆F M across the crisis

The COVID-19 pandemic represents a unique natural experiment to understand individual and collective
coping mechanisms with respect to stress and crisis.
Telecommunication data reveals almost real-time insights
into many aspects of daily life without interfering with
the subjects’ actions and interactions. Using anonymized
mobile phone data of a large fraction of the Austrian
population, we find that gender differences that exist in
communication patterns, mobility and spending leisure
time are amplified during the crisis, imposed by a severe lock-down in the first phase of the COVID-19 crisis.
In the context of basic provisioning, we find that during
the crisis there is a bias toward men doing the shopping
for food that is absent in normal times. For circadian
rhythms we see that the daily activity is concentrated on
a shorter period of the day for men and women equally
and that the circadian rhythm of men and women becomes more synchronized during the lock-down.
For both genders we observe an increase in total call
duration, which is due to an increase of the call time per
call and interestingly a decrease in the number of calls.
This is a clear sign that conversation focuses on the core
communication partners. This result is in line with a
general decline of the number of communication partners
during the lock-down. The reduction in communication
partners could also result from the loss of conversation
partners from work, but we also observe a reduction on
the weekends, where we would not expect the effect of
work to dominate. The degree distribution before the
crisis is in line with earlier work on mobile phone data
[38]. While they find a mean degree 2.34 (averaged over
18 months), we get a smaller value of 1.53 because we
average over 24 hours. However, we find the same powerlaw exponent ∼ −8 for the degree distribution. In these
quantities we see a clear increase and amplification of the
gender-biases.
Women show a smaller decrease in the number of calls
and a stronger increase in call time per call. As a consequence, the gender ratios of both quantities shift towards females. Women have been reported to have more
tightly knit (online) networks than men [8, 39]. We inter-

7
pret our findings as a signal that this behavior intensifies
during crisis. Additionally, our findings agree with the
well known tend and befriend reaction, which says that
facing (real or perceived) danger, females are more likely
to defend offspring (tend) and turn to their social group
for protection (befriend) [18]. The tightening of the social network can also be attributed to social carework,
such as calling lonely elderly, which is performed more
often by women during the lock-down [40]. Women were
reported to employ more active, problem-oriented coping strategies such as emotional and social support, while
men show rational and detachment strategies [4, 5], again
supporting the expectation, that women seem to tighten
their social networks more than men.
We find that the recovery time to women’s total call
time initially is as fast as for men, but later on clearly
slows down. The higher, longer increase in demand for
communication can be interpreted in the context with
higher needs for communication as a coping strategy in
an ongoing crisis [4, 5]. It also aligns well with the fact
that women experience more stress than men [41], have
higher levels of post traumatic stress disorder [42] and
have a higher prevalence to depression, partly due to
‘stress responsiveness’ [43]. Our result could be confounded by gender differences introduced by work environments. However, increasing gender-ratios in the call
times per call and the number of calls on weekends are a
strong indicator that the confounder indeed weakens the
effect on weekdays.
The age profiles for call times and the number of calls
seemingly suggest that younger cohorts communicate less
than older ones. We attribute this to the increased use of
instant messaging services [44] and other modern channels of communication by the younger cohorts. Here
a channel selection bias towards younger cohorts using
web-based communication services more actively acts as
a severe confounding factor.
The female population is moving less over the entire
period, confirming earlier work in different countries and
situations [2, 36]. The decrease in mobility following
the lock-down is stronger for women. In addition, men
recover their mobility behavior much quicker after the
measures are lifted. This effect depends on age. For the
young and adolescent population the existing gender-bias
in mobility is enhanced, while for those above retirement
age the bias reduces. We relate this to childcare duties
during the reproductive age and gender specific differences in occupation. This confirms the apprehensions
that females would be required to restrict their mobility
stronger due to childcare duties and higher unemployment [29–31].
In addition to care-taking duties, we expect more effects. Women were shown to exhibit more ethical behavior, at least where it is socially desirable, while men
often behave less community-aware [45, 46]. For women,
it has been shown that they are 50% more likely to adopt

non-pharmaceutical interventions in response to a respiratiory epidemic [47]. In this context, the reduction of
mobility in women could be partly attributed to responsible behavior in staying at home to protect vulnerable
parts of the population. This argument is supported by a
qualitative panel survey, that reports women taking the
COVID-19 pandemic more seriously in Austria [48, 49].
Since it seems that men go out for work more and
are more often responsible for gathering basic provisions
during the lock-down, they are more exposed to the perceived danger of catching SARS-CoV-2. This could be
interpreted as increased risk-taking behavior in men, in
line with [8, 50, 51].
Generally, gender differences in mobility decrease on
week-ends. We confirmed that the radius of gyration is
larger for men because they commute more/farther [2].
This suggests that a main factor for our observed behavioral changes is indeed driven by work. Further evidence for this hypothesis is found in the fact that only for
the 60+ age cohort the gender-ratio does not change between weekends and weekdays. Nevertheless, the effects
discussed above persist on weekends and our conclusions
stay valid.
We proxy the activity of people by analyzing their Internet traffic loads across a day. On average, the daily
activity period, as observed by several quantities, is reduced by around 40 to 60 minutes by the lock-down. The
gender-ratio of the length of a day does not change significantly. However, mobile phone usage of men and women
takes place at different times of the day, with the maximum shifted from the late afternoon to the morning during the lock-down. Network traffic starts to increase later
in the day and ends earlier. This can be explained by
commutes becoming obsolete because of home office and
the rise in unemployment [29–31]. We believe that the
shift of the maximum activity from evening to morning
is on one hand caused by different activity patterns in
home office and by different spare time activities during
the lock-down.
The gender-difference in cumulative activity, correcting for different activity levels, drops by 25%, hence showing that the circadian rhythms of women and men become more synchronized during the lock-down. We interpret this as a consequence that people stay at home
much more than usual, where often an opposite-gender
partner is present [37]. It would be interesting to understand if the synchronization is stronger for couples
spending much time together. More detailed studies of
the effects of the pandemic on the circadian rhythm, with
respect to age and personal attributes, such as morningness or eveningness [52], could give more detailed insights
in e.g. disturbed sleep patterns.
We have shown that massive collective crisis results
in tighter social networks with a focus on a social core
environment. Women seem to focus more on this tightening, indicating stronger, more active coping strate-

8
gies, a different perception of the dangers of COVID-19
and stronger pro-social behavior. We see that mobility is reduced much more in females, and the time to
recovery is much slower for females. This is partly connected to work-related influences and maybe a stronger
community-aware behavior in response to public mobility
restrictions. We might see a slight indication of increased
risk taking in males when it comes to basic provisioning.
Finally, we report synchronization effects of (electronic)
activity behavior during the day between males and females during crisis.

Supplementary Information
SI Text S1: Partitioning of observation interval

The observation period ranges from Feb 1 to June 29 2020. Our analyses compare various periods of time before,
during and after the lock-down. Each period is based on the introduction or easing of one or more non pharmaceutical
interventions (NPIs) and identified by roman numerals. Period I refers to the phase before the Austrian population
was widely aware of the COVID-19 disease in Austria, and ends with the first press conference announcing public
restrictions such as school closings and a call for home office on March 12th .This was followed by a transition period II
until Sunday, March 15, 2020, when an extensive lock-down was announced Including all shops closing and restrictions
on public movement and gatherings, such as public transport only being allowed to be used for commuting, a ban
on meetings with non-household persons and leaving the home only permitted for work that cannot be postponed,
grocery-shopping, helping people and short walks. The following lock-down III lasted until Easter (April 13, 2020)
which marks the first easing of the measures with small shops and construction stores being allowed to re-open. Phase
IV continues until the beginning of phase V on May 1, where the lock-down was eased further and gatherings of up
to 10 people were allowed. May 15th marks the beginning of phase VI, with restaurants and bars re-opening. The
dates and description of the measures is based on [22].

SI Text S2: Data

We partnered with a large Austrian internet service provider (ISP) to get access to data from mobile phones. We
use a combination of classical Call Data Records for the voice domain as well as X Data Records for the data domain.
Thus we do not only register an event when a call is performed, but rather perceive additional events when data
packages are transferred. Various network interfaces are connected via probes so we get data points from a multitude
of network technologies for mobile data usage (2G, 3G, 4G), calls, text messages as well as Voice over LTE, from both
user- as well as control plane. On average we observe approximately 1 Billion events per day, 4.5 Million devices per
day and for 80% of the devices the next event is received in 1.7 minutes, on average 4 minutes. When evaluating
gender differences we need to filter the data to approx 1.2 Million devices per day where demographic details are
defined. Demographic information is not available for roamers or virtual mobile operators (MVNO) and thus they
are excluded from this analysis. Furthermore, only devices with a radius of gyration RG (see eq. (1) below) larger
than 0m and lower than 300km are considered to exclude resting internet of things-devices and devices above the
theoretical maximum of RG in Austria. Calls are filtered to a length of at least 25 seconds prior to aggregation to
exclude calls that were not picked up, which form a distinct peak just below 25 seconds, shown in Supplementary Fig.
6.
As the gender attribute in the data set is self-reported and we discuss psychological, social and biological reasons
for the observed behavioral changes, we will use the term ‘gender’, referring to the psycho-social construct.

FIG. 6: Histogram of the call duration. There is a local maximum around 25 seconds, corresponding to calls not answered,
which we get exclude by introducing a cutoff at 25s. Note the double logarithmic axes.

Table I outlines the distribution of the devices per cohort. As not all devices are active every day we give the mean
and standard deviation as an approximation for the overall counts. As we cannot analyze a device for more than 24
hours (see below), we need to calculate aggregate statistics over the analyzed time period.

11
Localization Our localization methodology is based on the topology of the network, namely the observed cell-id.
This means that the accuracy is limited, and much less accurate than GPS based localization or the result of custom
apps combining Bluetooth, WiFi and GPS. However, the data is available for a large quantity of devices. The ISP
provides us with the localization information for each cell-id, which is based on the centroid of the network coverage
simulation.
Privacy The data is anonymized, any identifiers are hashed every 24 hours with a changing key by the ISP prior
to making the data available for the researchers. Only cell-id based localization is used to enhance the privacy of
the subscribers and only aggregate and k-anonymized statistics are reported. With this procedure we adhere to the
recommendations of the GSMA [53] with regards to data privacy handling as well as the law of the local jurisdiction.

SI Text S3: Metrics

Communication By analyzing calls, social interactions can be modeled. This part of the data consists of a list
of outgoing (MO) and incoming (MT) calls, each associated with a source and destination. We filter to calls with a
duration of at least 25 seconds to adjust for a shift in the distribution corresponding to calls that were not answered
(see Fig 6).
For each device we find NcMO outgoing and NcMT incoming calls with k MO and k MT other individuals, respectively
(in- and out-degree). The call duration is denoted by t̄. Additionally, as described earlier for the mobility dimension,
for each device, age group and gender are specified.
For all of these device-level metrics we report the median of the whole population, or for cohorts specified by age
groups or gender. We will add superscripts g and h to indicate gender.
Mobility We obtain mobility data as a stream of spatially localized network signaling events. It is transformed into
a list of locations ~xiµ = (xiµ , yiµ ), with associated stay duration tiµ for every individual i = 1...Nindiv at location index
µ = 1...Nlocations , where x and y represent longitude and latitude, respectively. Due to the anonymization procedure
the location index µ is reset every day and the individual index i is reshuffled accordingly. For the individuals,
metadata is collected in a vector mi = (gi , ai ), containing gender gi ∈ f emale, male and age ai aggregated into
cohorts of 15 years.

It captures the amount of movement in a time weighted manner and has the dimension of a length in meters. The
distribution of RG,i is fat tailed, see Fig. 7. In the main paper we report the median because it robust to heavy tails.
For our second mobility measure entropy the locations ~xiµ are binned into a hexagonal raster using Uber’s H3 [54].
The chosen resolution level for the raster yields hexagons with an area of approximately 800m23 . For each hexagon

Points of interest (Shopping, Leisure) Specific points of interest reflecting shopping and leisure zones in Vienna
were analyzed in more detail. We first used H3 by Uber [54] to create a discrete raster for the whole country to speed
up the analysis of specific locations afterwards. Then we count the number of unique subscribers in a set of manually
defined hexagons. We limit our investigations to stays longer than 10 minutes and shorter than 4 hours. We assume
this eliminates devices passing the shopping complex on the nearby highway, as well as persons working there, because
these activities take much shorter or longer, respectively.
Circadian rhythm We investigate the circadian rhythm using network traffic measures A(t) aggregated by gender
and ranging from the sum of call duration per hour to downloaded gigabytes per hour. Irrespective of the quantity,
we observe a broadened, peak-like structure with a rise in the morning and a drop in the evening. We quantify the
duration by the full-width-quarter-maximum distance (FWQM). It denotes the time span between point where the
activity is larger than the quarter of the maximum activity in the morning and the point where the activity drops
below the same value in the evening. We choose the threshold relative to the maximum, so we are independent of the
total activity; its value is set to a quarter without loss of generality.
A(t) − max(A(t))/4 = 0 ∀t1 , t2

FWQM = t2 − t1

Male and female activity, corrected for the difference in total activity, is not distributed across the 24 hours of a
day in the same way. Inspired by [21] we apply the following procedure. We correct for the difference in total activity
by calculating and normalizing the cumulative activity

14.9d for female-male, 15.5d for male-female and 15.9d for male-male interactions. Detailed results of the fitted parameters are
in Tab.II.

Gender differences To investigate gender differences we calculate the gender ratio rx for the various aggregations
x presented in this work. The ratio rx is calculated as the quotient of the aggregate for the female cohort divided by
the aggregate for the male cohort rx = xfemale /xmale (x represents the aggregation, e.g. median RG or median call
duration t̄). A gender ratio rx close to 1 (or 100%) indicates that the quantity is of similar size for both genders, less
(more) than 100% indicates smaller (larger) values for females.
SI Text S4: Time-back-to-normal: Fitting Half-life times

For many of the investigated quantities, the COVID-19 lock-down represents a perturbation from an equilibrium
with a subsequent, smooth return to the previous value. We fit an exponential function
f (t; a0 , a1 , b) = a0 + a1 bt ,
where a0 is fixed to the mean value in phase I, a1 is the additional offset at the beginning of the decay and b < 1 is
the average daily reduction factor. From b we can calculate the half-life time
t1/2 =

ln(1/2)
ln(b)

in days, which quantifies the time it takes the fitted quantity to return halfway back to “normal”. The non-linear
least squares fit is performed to the 7-day moving average of the investigated quantity, starting from the beginning
of phase III to the end of the observation period. We report standard deviations σ calculated as the square root of
the diagonal elements of the covariance matrix.
Figure 8 shows the average interaction time t̄gh , its 7-day moving average and the fitted exponential. We find
half-life times between 14.9d and 17.3d for female-male and female-female interactions, respectively. The detailed
results are given in Tab. II. The female-female interaction t1/2 is more than one standard deviation larger than for
the interactions where males are involved.
We also fit for the number of calls Nc and the number of unique contacts k, see Figs. 9 and 10, and Tab. II for
details. Both times, the half-life times for females are more than one standard deviation larger. For Nc the half-life
times are large compared to the other quantities, and in fact it has not reached the pre-crisis levels by the end of the
study period.
We perform the same procedure for the mobility-related quantities radius of gyration RG and stay-time distribution
entropy Si and show the fits in Figs. 11 and 12. The results for the fits are reported in Tab. II. The half-life times of
females are slightly, but not significantly larger.
For RG we also stratify for age, see Tab. III.
Through visual inspection it is clear that the quality of the fits of the mobility quantities are not good because the
exponential function does not represent the functional form of the return to normal well. The derivative of RG and

Si is small during the lock-down in phase III and gets larger in subsequent phases when the restrictions are lifted.
We fit a logistic function of the form
f (t; α, t0 ) =

1
1 + e−α(t−t0 )

.

The turning point, with the largest derivative, is at t0 and α controls the time it takes the logistic function to transition
from one niveau to the other.
In Fig. 13 we show the results of the results of fitting the step function, the values for t0 and α are reported in
Tab. IV. The α parameter is not significantly different, but the turning point t0 is significantly larger for females.

The same holds for our second measure of mobility, the entropy Si . The fits shown in Fig. 14 and values reported
in Tab. IV have not significantly different values for α, but the turning point t0 for females is significantly later. The
extended flat period in the beginning of the logistic function accounts for the extended duration of the lock-down.

The absolute values of the interaction time t̄gh are given in the main text Fig. 2. Here we discuss the gender

the transition phase II the relative gender gap approximately doubles to +27% on weekdays and up to +35% on
weekends. Subsequently we observe a smooth return to pre-lock-down values.
We stratify for age in Fig. 17 A, where we show the average t̄g over calendar week 10 in phase I and over calendar
week 12 in phase III for all age cohorts. The phase I profile is flat with values slightly above 300s for women and
slightly below 300s for men. In the lock-down phase III the call time increases for both genders and all ages, but
stronger for women and stronger for older age cohorts. The 15-29 cohort increases their communication behavior the
least. The gender ratio for t̄g is shown in Fig. 17 B. It is shifted towards women for all age cohorts and the lowest for
ages 30-59. We see a strong increase in week 12 for all ages, except the 75+ cohort. In Fig. 16 A we show the time
series of the age ratios, already discussed in the main text.
Next, we discuss the the number of calls as shown in main text Fig. 2 B. As shown in Fig. 15 B, before the crisis
women tended to have slightly fewer calls than men on weekdays (3% less) and more on weekends (2% more). This
changes in phase III, where the bias shifts towards women having equally as many calls on weekdays as well as an
increased bias on weekends (4% more). The bias returns to normal levels in phase IV, however, the weekday ratio is
shifted to be more male-biased. We report significance tests in SI Text S6.
The gender ratio of Nc , shown in SI Fig. 16 B, deviates only weakly from equality before the lock-down. All

FIG. 16: Age dependence of communication strength gender ratios. (A) Gender ratio for call time t̄ , (B) gender ratio for

effect is the weakest for the oldest cohort. The youngest cohort 15-29 has a different weekday - weekend pattern than the rest
of the age cohorts.

cohorts, except 15-29, are biased towards females having longer calls on weekends, except for the 75+ which does not
exhibit a weekly rhythm. In phase III the gender ratio for all age cohorts shifts towards women having more calls.
The age profiles in Fig. 18 elucidate this a bit more, by showing that from week 10 to week 12 the number of calls
decreased for all age cohorts and especially for young cohorts, which have a higher initial level in week 10. The gender
ratio increases from week 10 to week 12 for all age cohorts, except for the cohort 15-29, which remains at the same
value.
Mean degree varies around 1.4 and 1.7, so the range is relatively small. The age stratification in Fig. 19 A shows
that degree is highest for the age cohort 30-44. We see that for the age cohorts younger than 45 there is a reduction in
degree, for men 45-59 there is a very small reduction and for women older than 45 and men 60+ there is an increase

SI Text S6: Statistical significance of gender-ratio-changes across phases

We perform significance tests to ensure that the changes gender ratio in the observed quantities are indeed significant.
Gender ratios of different samples of observables (e.g. phases) are compared with a two-sided Mann-Whitney-U test
to reject the null hypothesis that they are from the same distribution. The results are shown in Tab. V for the overall
quantities and in Tab. VI we report age stratified tests.
For RG we can show that the reduction from phase I to phases II, III, IV, V and VI is highly significant on weekdays,

SI Text S7: Alternative measure for mobility: entropy

We calculate an alternative measure for mobility, the entropy Si of the stay time distribution of device i, for a
definition see SI Text S3 Methods. A high (low) value of entropy denotes a spread out (concentrated) stay time
distribution, i.e. the device was moving a lot (little).
Figure 20 A shows Si for both genders across the six phases. We observe a very similar pattern as for the radius of
gyration. During the week Si is high and on weekends it is significantly less. In phase III Si reaches a minimum and
only slowly recovers over the subsequent phases.
The gender ratio of Si , shown in Fig. 20 B also corroborates the radius of gyration. In phase I the gender ratio
is shifted towards men moving more, an effect which is smaller on weekends. During the lock-down in phase III the
ratio is shifted strongly towards men and changed little to nothing on weekends. In phase V the ratio recovers to
pre-crisis values.
SI Text S8: Long term analysis

A comparison with the data from the same time period of the previous year is available in Fig. 21. The figure
shows the ratio of radius of gyration from 2020 and 2019. If RG was smaller (larger) in 2020 than in 2019, the ratio
is less (more) than 100%.

FIG. 20: Mobility in Austria, measured by entropy. The upper panel shows entropy Si for men and women, the lower the
gender ratio for entropy rSi . The drop at the beginning of phase III is very pronounced and so is the change in gender ratio.
The weekday gender ratio is shifted towards men moving more and slowly returns to pre-crisis levels.

The drastic reduction of movement to approximately 30% compared to the previous year shows the impact of the
measures. We also observe that women have a stronger reduction from week 16 to 20.
These results should be interpreted with care, as the accuracy of the localization in the GSM network was improved
from 2019 to 2020, potentially resulting in different absolute values of RG .

SI Text S9: Shopping centers

Here we present the visiting data for a large shopping center in the south of Vienna, as described in the main text.
Figure 22 depicts data from the lock-down and is discussed in the main text.
For comparison we analyze the same time from the previous year, 2019, see Fig. 23. In the visitor numbers we
find the same weekly pattern as in phase I and a declining trend towards the summer months, which is, nevertheless,
much weaker than the reduction in phases III and IV. The gender ratio is quite stable around (or slightly above) 1.

SI Text S10: Statistical significance of gender ratio shopping center and recreational area

We perform statistical tests to check if the observed changes in gender ratio from one phase to another are significant.
A two sided Mann-Whitney U test is performed to reject the hypothesis that the values in both phases are drawn
from the same distribution.
The changes in gender ratio from phase I to phases III, IV and V are are highly significant on weekdays and not
significant on weekends.

FIG. 23: Shopping center in 2019. The upper panel shows the visitor count for the same period as in Fig. 22 in 2019 for a
large shopping center in the south of Vienna. The lower panel displays the gender ratio for the visitor count in panel A. The
changes from 2020 are not visible in this figure, however a declining trend from February towards summer is present.

For the recreational area we find that changes from phase I to phases III, IV and V are highly significant on
weekdays and for phases III and IV significant on weekends with a p¡0.01 and p¡0.05 significance level. For the second
presented recreational area only the weekday change from phase I to III is significant.

SI Text S11: Recreational areas

Figure 24 shows the recreational area described in the main text. For comparison we also show the relevant
time period in the previous year, 2019, in Fig. 25. The limited comparability due to improvements in the network
localization can be seen in the lower number of visitors, compared to 2020. However, the increasing trend towards
summer is clearly present. The gender ratio is different to 2020, as it is more shifted towards men, however there is
no stark change around march 15th , supporting the claim that the change from phase I to III is unique to 2020.
To corroborate these findings we analyze a second recreational area on the other side of Vienna, presented in Fig.
26. There the gender ratio in phase I is typically shifted towards more men present. In the beginning of the lock-down,
the gender ratio shifts towards equality, while at the same time more devices are present. A comparison with the
previous year, 2019, in Fig. 27 shows that these changes are specific to 2020.

SI Text S12: Circadian rhythm as observed by other quantities

We investigate the number of calls, down- and uploaded gigabytes per hour as network traffic measures to corroborate
the results presented for the call duration in the main text. All investigated quantities show similar patterns, the
maximum of the daily activity shifts to the morning, the FWQM gets shorter and the days get more synchronized.
We present the results for the call count per hour in Fig. 28. Panel E epicts how the length of day as measured by

FIG. 27: Visitiors in the same leisure area as in Fig. 26, but for the same time period in 2019. The upper panel shows the
number of men and women present, the lower panel the gender ratio women over men r. We do not find an increase in the
middle of March, and also gender ratio stays the same throughout the study period.

FWQM reduces by one hour from 14h before to 13h during the lock-down. Again, the gender ratio of FWMQ does
not show any significant differences. The difference in daily circadian rhythm, ∆F M , reduces by about one quarter
from phase I to phase III and smoothly recovers until phase IV, see panel F.
Figure 29 shows our results on the downloaded gigabytes per hour. Panels A and B depict how the activity peak in
the evening disappears during the lock-down and is only weakly pronounced in the mornings for men. For women the
download traffic in panel B does not show a pronounced maximum during the lock-down. The downloaded gigabyte
per hour in 29 E show a reduction in FWQM by 40min from 14h 45min to 14h 5min. We only find a slight decrease
in ∆F M in the first week of phase III, otherwise the differences in the daily activity patterns of men and women stay
constant.
Finally we consider the uploaded gigabytes per hour in Fig. 30. The profile of the network traffic in panels A and
B shift from a clear maximum in the evening to a stronger increase in the morning which results in a relatively flat
profile during the day in panel B. As shown in panel E the FWQM drops by 45min from 14h 33min to 13h 48min.
Panel F shows that ∆F M drops from by approximately one third with the beginning of the lock-down and returns to
pre-crisis levels around the beginning of May.

FIG. 28: Changes in circadian rhythms during the lock-down measured by number of calls per hour. (A) Network traffic on the
last Thursday in phase I, March 4th . The horizontal arrow marks the full-width-quarter-maximum length (FWQM). (B) Calls
per hour on Thursday, March 18th , the first Thursday in phase III. (C) Normalized cumulative activity for the day shown in
panel A. The inset highlights the difference of the male and female curve. The grey shaded area marks the difference between
the circadian rhythm of men and women, denoted ∆F M . (D) Same as in C, but for the curve in panel B. (E) FWQM for
men and women over time. (F) The gender ratio rF W QM does not deviate strongly from equality, hence, we show ∆F M over
time. For both genders the activity maximum shifts from late afternoon to morning and the length of the activity period is
approximately 60 min shorter during the lock-down. The reduction in ∆F M indicates that the circadian rhythms of men and
women become more synchronized.
