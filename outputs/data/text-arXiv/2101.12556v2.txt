ABSTRACT
The complexities involved in modeling the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 has been a major roadblock in
achieving predictability in the spread and containment of the disease. In addition to understanding the modes
of transmission, the effectiveness of the mitigation methods also needs to be built into any effective model for
making such predictions. We show that such complexities can be circumvented by appealing to scaling principles
which lead to the emergence of universality in the transmission dynamics of the disease. The ensuing data
collapse renders the transmission dynamics largely independent of geopolitical variations, the effectiveness of
various mitigation strategies, population demographics, etc. We propose a simple two-parameter model—the
Blue Sky model—and show that one class of transmission dynamics can be explained by a solution that lives at
the edge of a blue sky bifurcation. In addition, the data collapse leads to an enhanced degree of predictability in
the disease spread for several geographical scales which can also be realized in a model-independent manner
as we show using a deep neural network. The methodology adopted in this work can potentially be applied to
the transmission of other infectious diseases and new universality classes may be found. The predictability in
transmission dynamics and the simplicity of our methodology can help in building policies for exit strategies and
mitigation methods during a pandemic.

Introduction
Despite several warnings of an imminent pandemic, COVID-19 dropped upon the world, quite unexpectedly, out of a blue sky.
The spread of SARS-CoV-2 has left significant instabilities in the socioeconomic fabric of the society essentially defenestrating
any notion of normality that existed. While the spreading dynamics of the disease is not novel [1], the instabilities it has caused
has made different parts of the society, and notably, different governance, respond to containing its spread in very different
manners [2–6]. The determination of the optimal strategy, while not dragging what people have known as normality to the
ground, has been quite a challenge and highly dependent on the socio-economic condition of the country or region [7–10]. On
the other hand, researchers have been struggling to bring some predictability in the spread of the pandemic since even a few
weeks of foresight can not only save an economy from being jettisoned but also save a considerable number of lives that needn’t
be lost. Moreover, given the predator-prey game that is being played out between the human population and the virus, once the
game starts showing positive outcomes for the human population, deciding on exit strategies become of prime importance as an
immediate resurgence of the pandemic is the least coveted outcome.
Epidemiologists and mathematicians have constructed and resurrected various kinds of models to describe the spread
of COVID-19 with varying degree of success. These include several variants of the venerable SIR (Susceptible, Infected ,
Recovered) model like SEIR [11–14]—E for exposed, SEIRD—D for deceased, and Stochastic SIR [14, 15]. There are more
realistic delay differential equation models [16–20], renormalization group equations [21] and the highly computation intensive
(and arguably the most detailed) agent-based network models [22–30]. There are even purely data-driven models [31–33]. In
all these approaches, sets of parameters have to be tuned precisely to analyse a particular country or region to obtain predictions,
since every region seems to have its own special time evolution for disease propagation, making this a Herculean task. Although
all models’ assumptions cannot strictly describe every detail of any real-world system, it is believed that such systems may
possess certain universal behaviours independent of these details [34].
We propose to establish that there is a method in the madness of the spreading of this disease which can be revealed by
subjecting the available data of all the countries or regions to a scaling analysis reminiscent of the data collapse in the study of
critical phenomena [35, 36] in the sixties and seventies of the previous century. Data collapse leading to universality has been

observed in a large variety of systems and we provide a short overview of the literature in the Appendix. We emphasize that the
procedure we follow is model-agnostic and does not require the assumption of a model for the transmission and mitigation
dynamics. In addition, this method lies open to model-based interpretations as we later point out. Almost miraculously, we
find a simple yet nontrivial mean-field model where the carrying capacity of infected population depends on the population
size. The model—that we call Blue Sky model (BSM)—undergoes a blue sky bifurcation [37] (also called the saddle-node
bifurcation or the fold bifurcation) which is a ubiquitous structurally stable bifurcation found in variety of systems, such as
power systems [38], viscous profiles [39], neural networks [40], excited molecules [41], plasmas [42], and the Ginzburg–Landau
systems [43]. At the edge of the blue sky bifurcation point, appears a universal data collapse. Furthermore, given that the
scaling and data collapse have stood well the test of time for a very diverse set of systems and is grounded in well understood
physical principles, we are proposing a robust method for making long-term predictions that will help in evaluating disease
mitigation efficacies and planning exit strategies for the future. We hope to convince the readers that we have established a
method which does not require parameter tuning or model selection to gain a handle over the prediction of disease spread.
The salient features of our work are:
• We show that there exists a universality in the spread of the disease once proper scaling is applied to the data.
• Two universality classes emerge that give us a window into understanding how well a country or region performed in
mitigating the disease. These universality classes are independent of geographical scales.
• We propose the BSM—an extension of the logistic growth model—which explains the existence of these two classes, the
first, through a solution that lives at the edge of blue sky bifurcation and a second that maps the BSM onto the logistic
growth model.
• We show how predictability can be realized from this analysis in a model-agnostic manner relying only on the inference
drawn from the first phase of the disease spread. For this we construct a deep neural network (DNN) based predictive
model. We also show that an equally good prediction can be made using the BSM. We give a few examples from the
ongoing phase of the pandemic in several countries and states.

Emergence of Universality in Transmission Dynamics
To bring about some semblance of order in what looks like a disparate set of data from several countries, we first focus entirely
on phase-1 of the pandemic. We denote the total number of cases (individuals who have tested positive for the COVID-19)
at time t as N(t) with t being measured in days. The derivative dN(t)/dt is the number of new cases detected on a given
day. Phase-1 refers to the situation, for a given country or region, where the dN(t)/dt increased from zero or a small value,
went through a maximum and then decayed to almost zero (Type I transmission) or to a small value (Type II transmission). It
stayed near zero or near the small value for a few weeks before starting to rise again at the onset of the next phase. We need to
differentiate quantitatively between the phrase “near zero for a few weeks” and “a small value for a few weeks”. We do this by
inspecting the rise in the total number of cases, N(t), over four weeks past phase-1. If the change is more than 4% of N(t), we
mark the transmission as being of Type II, otherwise it is Type I.
Taking a more careful look at Figure 1, we note that the total number of cases and the total duration of phase-1 are very
different for each country. This is to be expected as these countries have very different population densities and different
patterns of inhomogeneities in the density of population. Moreover, the policies of the government and the acceptance of these
by the governed affect the implementation of precautionary measures [8–10, 44]. The policies and exit strategies towards the
end of a phase in any country also determines whether the spread of the disease lingers on, albeit at a much reduced rate, or
is completely rooted. The latter essentially divides the world into two classes in our formalism. However, looking at bare
case numbers, one is bound to conclude that each country or region is a unique case study requiring a detailed modeling of
transmission dynamics and incorporating the effects of mitigation and containment measures, a task that seems formidable
right from the onset.
The top left and right panels of Figure 1 show some examples of countries that went through a phase-1 transmission of Type
I and Type II respectively. The disparity in the spreading patterns is apparent. In the lower panels of Figure 1 we focus on the
states of the USA and Germany. In the USA we see that the spreading pattern in the different states was somewhat decorrelated.
This is where our formalism is particularly useful. The physical principles that we advocate being independent of geographical
scales can be applied to countries, states or even counties and districts given they have seen a significant spread of the disease
within the region. On the other hand, the spread of COVID-19 in Germany in the various states has been quite correlated.
Now, let us see how universality can emerge from a scaling of the COVID-19 confirmed case rate data. We introduce a
number Nmax which is the total number of infected people at the end of phase-1. For Type I transmission the value of Nmax is
easy to infer. It is the the total number of cases at which the N(t) curve flattens out after the close of the phase. For Type II
transmission, where N(t) is never completely flat, we determine the close of phase-1 following the procedure described above.
A perfect example is the case of Germany. For the period May 31st , 2020 to July 17th , 2020, the value of dN(t)/dt hovered
around 400 which is more than an order of magnitude smaller than the peak value of 6000. In this case Nmax corresponds to
the number of cases at the end of this period of stagnancy in the growth rate, i.e., the number of cases on July 17th , 2020. Of
course, there are some degree of variability associated with the choice of the end-date for a phase. However, an estimation error
of a few days does not change the onset of universality. Therefore, we choose the end-date for phase-1 as the first day when the
N(t) curve flattens out for Type I transmission and the last day before the onset of the next phase for Type II transmission.
Our conjecture is that universality emerges from the scaling given by
t˜ =

t
t1/2

, and Ñ(t˜) =

N(t˜)
.
Nmax

(1)

The ratio Ñ(t˜) is relatively insensitive to the testing policies, the inhomogeneity in the population density, the size of the country
or region, the details of the mitigation methods advocated, etc. The rescaling of the time by an appropriate time scale for each
country or region, irons out the nuances brought about by the government policies like the duration of lockdown, exit strategies,
etc., at the lowest order of approximation. Therefore, for each country or region a natural time scale to choose is t1/2 which is
the time at which N(t) = Nmax /2.
The choice of the characteristic timescale is subjective. For instance, choosing t = t1/n corresponding to the time when
N(t) = Nmax /n, with n being a positive definite number would not affect the nature of this analysis. However, choosing n = 2
allows for an easy interpretation of the characteristic time scale and, as we see later, places the peak of d Ñ(t˜)/dt˜ at t = t1/2 for
a simple logistic growth. According to our conjecture, Ñ(t˜) plotted against t˜ should show a data collapse opening up avenues
for simple predictive modeling and generalization beyond socioeconomic and geopolitical variations.
Data-collapse in transmission dynamics of COVID-19
In the light of the preceding discussion we present the Ñ(t˜) vs. t˜ plots for several countries and states in left-most plots of
Figure 2. The data collapse is clearly evident. We see that independent of variabilities in transmission dynamics the universality
in the rescaled data dictates that there are two distinct classes. The plots in the middle of Figure 2 show the functional

number of confirmed cases, Ñ(t˜) = N(t)/Nmax , and the its derivative, d Ñ(t˜)/dt˜, with respect to the scaled time t˜ = t/t1/2 for
Type I transmission where the disease spread was almost completely routed after phase-1 and Type II transmission where the
disease spread was not completely routed after phase-1. The data collapse is evident and independent of the country or state
being considered showing the emergence of two universality classes in the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 independent of
social and geopolitical variations. Right panels: The fit to the rescaled data using the Blue Sky model (solid blue line) and
the model agnostic fit (dashed black line) with a deep neural network. Note that α̃ = 0.918 in the rightmost bottom panel is

dependence of d Ñ(t˜)/dt˜ on t˜. For the Type I transmission one clearly sees that tail of the distribution at higher t˜ dips to very low
values. This implies that after phase-1 ended, the daily case rate actually went down to a negligible number, which, originally,
was our basis for identifying Type I transmission. On the other hand, for the same curve in the lower middle plot of Figure 2,
the tail of the distribution at higher t˜ never really goes to as low values as that for Type I transmission. This is because in
a transmission of Type II the countries and regions never saw a complete rooting of the spread of the disease. To show the
independence of geographical scales of our formalism, we include New York, USA and Bayern, Germany as two states tracking
them over phase-1 of the spread of COVID-19. We see that both the states show transmission of Type II.
It is important to point out here that the data collapse that we see effectively filters out the variances in the dynamics of the
disease spread and the policies for disease mitigation. It also effectively filters out how quickly the response to the pandemic
was orchestrated (a matter of government policy), how drastic these measures were and all other geopolitical demographics that
make the disease propagation dynamics in each country or state look very different in Figure 1. The key difference between the
two classes reduces to the effectiveness of the countries in fully containing the disease itself, each using their own bouquet of
mitigation methods and exit strategies. Indeed, this data collapse removes all necessity of fine-tuning a plethora of parameters
to examine each country or state separately and shows that there is a common pattern in the spread of COVID-19.
Interpretation of t1/2
The parameter t1/2 gives us a distinct insight into how well the spread of the disease was mitigated in a particular phase. A
shorter t1/2 implies a more effective mitigation strategy. For example, from Figure 2 we see that the t1/2 for South Korea is 18
days, which means that the spread of the disease was stopped very rapidly as compared with UK for which t1/2 is 57 days.
However, despite being effective in slowing down the spread rapidly, South Korea falls into Type II since the spread was not
completely stopped but lingered on. On the other hand, Ireland, even being of type I, has a relatively longer t1/2 of 39 days
showing that while the spread of the disease was almost completely rooted it took a longer period of time to do so hinting as
possibilities of drafting better mitigation strategies.

Blue Sky model
Among the four broad classes of models (with possibility of overlap among them) of infectious disease spreading—viz,
data-driven phenomenological models [45, 46], compartmental or lumped parameter models [47], agent-based models [48], and
stochastic differential equation models [49]—while the former two are mathematically more accessible to policy makers, the
latter two are more detailed in their approach. The first two types of models are to the last two types, what thermodynamics is to
statistical mechanics. The most simple lumped parameter model is undoubtedly the well-known one dimensional autonomous
logistic growth model [50]:


dN(t)
N(t)
= β N(t) 1 −
,
(2)
dt
κ
on which we shall focus. Here, β > 0 is the Malthusian growth rate in the presence of unlimited resource, i.e., κ → ∞. Most
commonly, the resource is assumed to be unaffected by the population size, N(t), and hence the population grows to settle onto
the value N(∞) = κ, which is the carrying capacity. We discuss some variants of the the logistic growth model and their fit to
the data in the Appendix.
The system of our interest is a population where N(t) represents the number of COVID-19 infected individuals that infect
healthy individuals so that the infected population grows at a rate β . All the depletable conditions that are favourable for
the infected population to grow is quantified through the positive parameter, κ. One could argue that rather than relying
completely on the carrying capacity parameter, one could make this model more elaborate by making it higher dimensional
to mathematically incorporate the interaction among infected, susceptible, exposed, asymptomatic, quarantined, recovered,
immune, and deceased individuals. However, the fact remains that all such higher dimensional models, despite their share of
success, bring in more parameters and more speculations while the only available data is still mostly that of the infected and
deceased individuals. Thus, in this paper, we are motivated to take the route of simple two-parameter one dimensional model
complimented with the information extracted from the real data.
It is straightforward to realize that the carrying capacity can easily depend on N(t): e.g., government may be practically
incapable of quarantining infected individuals as their numbers grow, thereby effectively increasing the carrying capacity
because the infected individuals would interact with more and more healthy individuals leading to terms which are higher order
in N(t). Therefore, if we were to model the realistic scenarios, we should let κ depend on N(t) in nontrivial ways. In this
context, we find it useful to define an order parameter, ρ, as


1 dκ
.
(3)
ρ≡ 2
κ
dN
Note that lower the value of the order parameter, more is the control on the change of the carrying capacity. The case of
the order parameter being zero corresponds to the traditional logistic equation governed system where the carrying capacity
is independent of N(t). We would like to mention here that past considerations [16, 51–59] of the logistic growth related
compartmental models, as applied to the modeling of COVID-19, do not explicitly incorporate the natural notion of the
state-dependent carrying capacity.
In order to account for the aforementioned variation of the carrying capacity with the change in the infected population size,
we propose a simple, yet non-trivial, functional form for the carrying capacity:
κ = κbsm ≡

κlgm
,
1 − ακlgm N(t)

(4)

where κlgm is the constant carrying capacity corresponding to the traditional logistic growth model and α is a non-negative
parameter. In Equation 2 with κbsm as the carrying capacity, we define the Blue Sky model (BSM) that we use to explain our
findings in this paper. In the BSM, we note ρ = α which renders a solid physical meaning to the (otherwise ad hoc) parameter
˜ = N(t)/Nmax and t˜ = t/t , adopted in the previous discourse, we define β̃ ≡ t β ,
α. Following the transformations, N(t)

κ̃lgm ≡ κlgm /Nmax , and α̃ ≡ Nmax α. Henceforth, we shall consider only the rescaled BSM where these rescaled parameters are
used.

In the BSM, the blue sky bifurcation occurs at the nonzero fixed point at α̃ = α̃edge ≡ 1/4κ̃lgm

impossibility. This sets an important limit that α̃ should respect for the model to be physical: one must

Figure 3. A display of predictability from the emergence of universality classes. We show how predictions can be made
form scaling data and using knowledge gathered from phase-1 of the pandemic. Once the peak in the daily case rate is reached
(or has been assumed to have reached), prediction for several weeks or months can be made. The solid dark blue lines in the
insets show the data being used to find tpeak , and from it, t1/2 and Nmax . The dotted red lines in the insets are the test data
which lie in the future with respect to the data used to determine the peak. The light blue lines and bands are predictions
from the model-dependent fit using the Blue Sky model (BSM) to phase-1 data and the gray lines and bands are those from
the model-agnostic fit using a deep neural network (DNN). The dashed lines are prediction for transmission of Type I and the
dot-dashed lines are for transmission of Type II. All predictions are made till t˜ = 2.5 or t = 2.5t1/2 starting from the beginning
of the ongoing phase of disease spread. The top and middle rows show predictions for various countries while the bottom row
shows predictions for two states in the USA and one in Germany.

As seen in the rightmost column of Figure 2, the BSM remarkably segregates the COVID-19 transmission dynamics in
countries and states into two universality classes—Type I and Type II—characterized by two distinct and well separated values
of the (rescaled) order parameter, ρ—one close to the logistic growth value (α̃ ≈ 0) and the other close to the edge of blue sky
2 ) respectively. The data collapse onto the respective curves is strongly reminiscent of the similar phenomenon
(α̃ ≈ 1/4κ̃lgm
observed in the critical phenomena and their universality across a plethora of physical systems [35, 36]. Thus, we speculate
that it may be a potential hint of a hidden renormalization scheme present in the microscopic details of the corresponding
agent-based models.
Deep neural network
While the BSM provides a very good and intuitive explanation of the data, we feel that one should not be limited to exploring
the universality in the data through specific models only. Hence, we perform a model-agnostic fit using a universal function
6/17

DESY 20-234, HU-EP-20/42

generator in the form of a deep neural network (DNN). We use a three-layers deep, each layer 16 nodes wide DNN for this
purpose. The core of the architechture can be found in the Methods and Materials section and a detailed discussion can be
found in the Appendix. The fit to the data using the DNN can be seen in the rightmost panel of Figure 2. The back dashed line
corresponds to the DNN fit. We fit to the Ñ(t˜) distribution. We see that the fit of Type II transmission is almost identical to the
BSM fit showing that the data-driven and model-dependent methods reach the same conclusion. For transmission of Type I the
DNN fit is slightly different from the BSM fit and notably so at the center of the distribution where d Ñ(t˜) is shown to be higher
from the DNN fit than from the BSM fit.

Predicting of COVID-19 spread from universality
The data collapse that we show leads us to the ability of making predictions in both a model-dependent and a model-agnostic
way. While the BSM shows a clear explanation of the data, the advantage of a data collapse lies in the emergence of universality
which allows for model-agnostic predictions from the simple understanding that the transmission dynamics described by the
rescaled variables are the same in every phase of the the disease spread. Hence, we would like to emphasize both possibilities
although they lead to similar results in predictions.
It should be noted that the only parameter that needs to be estimated for predictions to be made is t1/2 for the ongoing phase
for a country or region. Once that is determined, the parameters extracted from the fit to the phase-1 data can be used to make
predictions for the ongoing phase. For both the approaches we use a common algorithm except for the functional form that we
use to fit to the data. For the model-dependent approach we use the BSM and extract its parameters from data, whereas in the
model-agnostic approach we use the trained DNN to predict the distribution of Ñ(t˜).
The algorithm used to make the predictions is delineated in Materials and Methods section. To show the extent to which
our prediction work, we assume that a country or state is just past the peak of dN(t)/dt. The data that we use for determining
tpeak is represented by the solid dark blue line in the insets of Figure 3. The data past the end of this line, marked with a dotted
red line is assumed to be in the future. We use the “past” data to predict for the “future” and then extend our prediction to
t˜ = 2.5. Since t1/2 is unique for each country or state, each approach and each transmission types, the length of time for which
predictions are made differ.
Model-dependent prediction
The fitting of the BSM to data from phase-1 paves the way for making model-dependent predictions for future phases of the
pandemic. This can be done by identifying t1/2 and, from it, Nmax . This is only possible if, in a current phase of the pandemic,
the daily case rate dN(t)/dt has already reached a peak. This peak lies at time t = t˜peakt1/2 where t˜peak can be derived from the
fit parameters and is given in Equation 7. By definition, t = t1/2 is the time at which the N = Nmax /2 with N(t) being counted
from the beginning of the phase. Once these two parameters have been extracted, one can make two separate predictions for
any geographical region: the first assuming a spread of Type I and the second assuming a spread of Type II. These predictions
for Type I (dashed blue line) and Type II (dot-dashed blue line) are shown in Figure 3 for several countries and states. The
bands in blue represent the error in the prediction propagated from the error in the estimation of t˜peak .
Model-agnostic prediction
We also show the predictions from the model-agnostic approach using a trained DNN in Figure 3. The logic that we follow to
identify the peak of the dN(t)/dt distribution is the same as for the model-dependent predictions. However, t1/2 now varies
between the two methods since t˜peak is different for the model-dependent and the model-agnostic fits. The dashed gray lines
represents transmission of Type I and the dot-dashed gray lines represents transmission of Type II. For Type I transmission, the
BSM gives predictions similar to the DNN. However, for Type II the BSM mostly predicts somewhat larger number of cases.
This is because t˜peak = 0.85 from the BSM fit of the phase-1 data is a bit lower than that from the DNN fit of t˜peak = 0.87. The
gray bands show the error in prediction propagated from the esrror in estimation of t˜peak .
In the model-agnostic approach the regression is completely data driven, and hence, does not represent any underlying
principle of the disease spread. This can be considered as a drawback of this approach. However, we show that the predictions
made through this approach is very similar to the one made with the BSM. In addition the fit to data is also quite robust as can
be seen from Figure 3.
Discussions on the predictions
There are several subtleties about the prediction that we should mention here. Firstly, the most important and sensitive part of
the prediction is locating the peak of dN(t)/dt during an ongoing phase. For some cases tpeak is easy to locate, for instance, for
Italy and Ireland in Figure 3. However, for some other countries like Germany, it is somewhat more involved. Secondly, just
past the peak it is difficult to gauge whether N(t) will be monotonically decreasing or not. Lastly, in cases like Germany and
UK we expect a significant margin of error in determining the peak itself since the dN(t)/dt is not strictly unimodal. This
7/17

DESY 20-234, HU-EP-20/42

uncertainty in the determination of the peak is what the error bars for the predictions quantify. The error in determining tpeak
propagates to an error in determining Nmax . Hence, the error bars are small for Ireland and Italy, while they are quite large for
Germany and California—the latter being just past the peak in the dataset we use. The spread of COVID-19 in Russia had just
reached the peak while we were doing this analysis and hence, we make pure predictions without any test data.
In all the plots in Figure 3, we see that Type II transmission lasts much longer than Type I transmission. For Ireland we see
that it was proceeding along the curve for Type I transmission until the next phase started when it diverged once more. Form
this plot we now get an idea of how the pandemic might have been rooted in Ireland had the next wave not started. UK on the
other hand seemed to be following the trajectory taken by Type II transmission until the number of new cases per day started
rising once more.

Summary
The surfacing of a worldwide phenomenon such as a pandemic is highly disruptive. The social, political, and economic
disruption that this pandemic has brought resulted in an essentially chaotic response to its mitigation. Everything from testing
strategies to containment procedures followed very different patterns in different nations and variation even at the regional levels
were very palpable. This has made the analysis of the data to model the underlying dynamics of disease spread a formidable
task that has not yielded to any generalization.
In this paper we show that the emergence of order from within this chaos is made possible by applying well tested procedures
drawn from the study of critical phenomenon leading to the formation of universality classes. Such ordering in the data leads to
the possibility of characterizing the transmission dynamics into two classes, distinguished by how well the disease has been
contained by each country or region. This clearly shows that the variation of the transmission dynamics, and the effect of
policies related to disease mitigation, testing guidelines and exit strategies can be scaled away to instigate a data collapse that
allows us to bring about remarkable predictability in the spread of the disease.
We reemphasize that without having to go into the rigours of extracting epidemiological parameters and having to formulate
specific models for the spread of the disease, the emergence of universality allows for the prediction of future disease spread.
The lack of clear understanding of what model to use and how to extract epidemiological parameters has been a major
hurdle to making mathematically sound predictions during the spread of COVID-19. In addition, such methods require that each
country and each region be treated separately, quickly leading to an explosion of parameters and systems of equations. While
being model-agnostic certainly has several drawbacks, the universality in the spread of the disease that we bring to surface
here circumvents many of these problems by exploring the emergence of one single functional form that can be used to make
prediction for the spread of the disease once a region has reached the peak of the spread. This clearly allows policy decisions to
be made around exit strategies and lets the responsible governance understand how long it might take for a spreading wave of
the disease to be contained given the current measures are kept in place.
We would like to point out that the advent of vaccination can be accommodated for in our analysis since it effectively
reduces the size of the total susceptible population which, in turn, does not affect the rescaled parameters since they are scaled
by Nmax . Therefore, the validity of our work is not short-lived and have general applicability, regardless of the mitigation
methods used.
Lastly, we bring to light the proposition of the BSM which explains the data remarkably well. We wish to highlight that it is
an intriguing coincidence that Type II dynamics should live at almost the edge of blue sky bifurcation in the BSM. Looking at
the finite nonzero value of the order parameter vis-à-vis the almost vanishing value of order parameter for Type I transmission,
one is readily reminded of the phase transition phenomenon in physical systems. It is tempting to interpret the two types of
transmission as two phases quantified by an order parameter. Furthermore, it remains to be seen if the newly introduced BSM
finds applications in other epidemiological systems.

Data sources and curation
In this work we used data from publicly available sources. The two primary sources that we used are:
• Data on COVID-19 confirmed case rate obtained from the Johns Hopkins University, Center for Systems Science and
Engineering database [60] through their GitHub repository. The time-series for all the countries in the world and for all
the counties in the USA are available from here. For the confirmed case rates in each state of the USA we merged the
data for the counties in each state.
• For Germany the data is available through the Robert Koch Institute from the RKI COVID19 database.
For all datasets we worked with the seven day averages to remove the fluctuations due to variations in reporting over the
period of a week. The last date on the time-series used in this work is 31st of December 2020.
Rescaling of the BSM Differential Equations
The rescaled BSM can be explicitly written as:


d Ñ(t˜)
Ñ(t˜)
= β̃ Ñ(t˜) 1 −
+ α̃ Ñ(t˜)2 .
dt˜
κ̃lgm

(5)

For the purpose of prediction, we need to estimate t˜ = t˜peak at the peak of the distribution of the first derivative, d Ñ/dt˜. For
Type I transmission, t˜peak = 1 to a very good approximation. Numerically, t˜peak = 0.98 from the fit shown in Figure 2 for Type I
transmission since the solution lies very close to the pure logistic growth model (α̃ = 0). However, for Type II transmission,
2 —integration of
t˜peak depends on the fit parameters. Since the transmission happens at the bifurcation point —α̃ = 1/4κ̃lgm
Equation 5 at the corresponding value of parameters is needed. Integration yields:

where Ñ0 = Ñ(t˜ = 0).
In general, the BSM has three extrema in d Ñ/dt˜ at Ñ(t˜) = 0, Ñ(t˜) = 2κ̃lgm /3, and Ñ(t˜) = 2κ̃lgm . For the solution at the
bifurcation point, there are only two extrema which are the first two, and the maximum is then at Ñ(t˜) = 2κ̃lgm /3. Putting all of
these together, one finds from Equation 6,

Numerical solution of BSM
The fit to the BSM was performed by numerical integration of the solution to the differential equation given by Equation 5. For
this we used the SciPy package [61].
Deep neural network architecture
To construct the DNN used in the model-agnostic fit we used TensorFlow [62]. The following are the details of the DNN
architecture:
• depth: 3 layers
• width: 16 nodes in each layer
• optimizer: Adam with a learning rate of 0.01
• loss function: mean square error
• regularization: early stopping
• validation split: 0.2
Since the data for Ñ(t˜) is already scaled between 0 and 1, no scaling of the data was necessary. The DNN took about
100-200 epochs to train with the regression taking only a few seconds to be completed. A more detailed discussion of the
architechture can be found in the following sections.

Algorithm for predictions
Once we have the fit to the BSM or have trained the DNN with phase-1 data we can make predictions for the subsequent phases.
The procedure we follow for this is given by:
1. Choose a starting date where the cases start to rise (the start-date) from the plot of dN(t)/dt for the second or any
subsequent phase.
2. Subtract the number of cases up until the start-date from the total number of cases to get the adjusted number of cases.
3. Locate the time t = tpeak at which the peak of dN(t)/dt occurs with t = 0 at the start-date.
4. The time tpeak is proportional to t1/2 with the constant of proportionality being approximately 1 for Type I transmission
and a constant (approximately 0.85) extracted from data for phase 1 of the spread for transmission of Type II.
5. Find the adjusted number of cases on the date corresponding to t1/2 . Twice that number is the adjusted Nmax .
6. Use the functions fit from data for phase 1 (the BSM for model-dependent predictions and DNN for model-agnostic
predictions) to estimate the future adjusted number of cases.
7. Now add back the number of cases up until the start-date to get the prediction of the disease spread.

Figure 4. The emergence of universality in fluid systems.The left panel is a reproduction of figure 2 of Ref. [63] which shows
data collapse in the coexistence of liquid and vapour states for several fluids. The right panel is a reproduction of figure 10 of
Ref. [64] and shows dynamical scaling for several fluids.
In this section we discuss some examples of data collapse seen in physical system. The emergence of universality
accompanied by a data collapse is quite common and has been observed for more than half a century. We begin our exposition
with data collapse in the study of critical phenomenon [35, 36, 65] in fluids. We intend to keep the discussion only at a
representative level to give some introduction to universality and data collapse and not make it an exhaustive survey which is
not within the scope of this paper.
It is well known that if a gas is subjected to isothermal compression, then at a certain pressure it undergoes a phase transition
to the liquid state while the pressure remains constant. Upon completion of the phase transition, the pressure increases very
sharply on further compression while the volume increases too. If the temperature is raised and the process repeated, the same
phenomenon occurs except that the parameter space over which the pressure and volume simultaneously rise grows smaller and
smaller as the temperature is raised. At a particular temperature, T = Tc , this parameter space reduces to a point and at higher
temperatures the liquefaction does not occur however high the pressure is. The temperature, Tc , is the critical temperature and
in its vicinity the fluid shows a large amount of fluctuation as it lies between a state of reasonable order, the liquid state, and a
state of disorder, which is the gaseous state.
The fluctuations in density very close to the critical point actually mean that some short-lived liquid state bubbles are
produced in the gas. As the critical point is reached these fluctuations become long lived and infinitely long ranged as one has a
liquid-vapour coexistence. The infinite lifetime of fluctuations and the infinite range of correlation mean that this phenomenon
10/17

DESY 20-234, HU-EP-20/42

cannot be sensitive to which gas is being considered. Whether it be Carbon Dioxide, Oxygen, Nitrogen, Xenon or Sulphur
Hexafluoride, they will all behave in the same way. This is known as universality and, hence, means that if we draw the equation
of state of any gas near the critical point with pressure scaled by the critical pressure and the volume scaled by the critical
volume, then we will get just one curve. The critical volumes, critical temperatures and critical pressures are all different for the
different materials but the scaled equation of state is the same as can be seen from Figure 4. If P, V and T are the pressure,
volume and temperature of a fluid with a and b being constants specific to the fluid, then



a 

p + 2 (V − b) = RT −→ π + 2 (3φ − 1) = 8τ,
(9)
V
φ
where π = P/Pc , φ = V /Vc and τ = T /Tc with Pc , Vc and Tc being the pressure volume and temperature at the critical point.
The equation of state thus collapses to a single equation independent of the nature of the fluid.
An identical situation holds for the dynamics which probes the lifetime of the fluctuations. The experimental technique
for probing fluctuations directly is frequency resolved light scattering. The intensity I as a function of frequency, ω, is what
is measured and at a given temperature and has a Lorentzian shape. As the temperature is lowered towards the critical point,
both the peak (at ω = 0) and the width at half-maximum increase with decreasing temperature, both headed for infinitely large
values at the critical point. Different materials show different Lorentz distributions at different temperatures. If we denote the
intensity at a particular frequency and a particular temperature, T , by I(ω, ∆T ), with ∆T = T − Tc , then for different materials
and different sets of ∆T one has different I(ω, ∆T ) vs ω distributions. However, if one plots I(ω, ∆T )/I(0, ∆T ) vs. ω/ω0
where ω0 is the characteristic frequency for a given material, then the data for hundreds of individual distributions collapse on a
single distribution. This phenomenon is called dynamic scaling [35, 36, 65] and is displayed in Figure 4.
This phenomenon of universal data collapse is ubiquitous: It appears in various forms in network dynamics [66], neuronal
network [67], brain [68, 69], supercritical fluids [70], amorphous solids [71], Bose–Einstein condensate [72], jamming
transition [73], granular media [74,75], financial markets [76], metallic liquids [77], etc. Thus, in some sense, it is not surprising
that this intriguing phenomenon be present in the transmission of infectious diseases as well.

Appendix: Comparisons between different models
In this section we compare some models that have been used commonly in epidemiology to quantify transmission dynamics of
diseases including COVID-19 [53]. All the models that we describe here are variants of the logistic growth model. The logistic
growth model (LGM) is defined as:


We define t˜ = t/t1/2 and Ñ(t) = N(t)/Nmax , and by setting β̃ = βt1/2 and κ̃ = κ/Nmax , we get the rescaled equation:

We see that β scales as the time dimension and κ scales as the number of cases. This makes the dimensional quantities, β̃ and

Figure 5. A comparison of the variants of the logistic model. The panels on the left show Ñ(t˜) vs. t˜ distribution for Type I
and Type II transmission dynamics; and the right panels shows the d Ñ(t˜)/dt˜ vs. t˜ plot for the same. We fit four models to the
data – the logistic growth model, the generalized logistic model, the generalized Richards model and the Blue Sky model. While
the fit to data for all the models are the same for Type I transmission where all the models go to the limit of being a logistic
growth model, for Type II transmission the Blue Sky model can explain the data better than the other models.

For π = 1, it reduces to the standard Richards model [78]. We see that the scaling is similar to the GLM with β̃ = βt1/2 Nmax
and κ̃ = κ/Nmax ; the rescaled GRM is:

In Figure 5 we show a comparison between all the models we list here and the Blue Sky model (BSM). The two upper
panels are for transmission of Type I. The LGM fits this data quite well and all the other models acquire the parameter values
that take them to the limit of being an LGM. The two lower panels are for transmission of Type II. Here we clearly see that the
BSM fits the data much better that the other models. Especially for the tail of distribution past the peak of the d Ñ(t˜)/dt˜ vs. t˜
plot where t˜ > t˜peak , the BSM model allows for larger d Ñ(t˜)/dt˜ compared to the other models hence being able to replicate
transmission of Type II where the spread of the disease lingers on.

Appendix: The deep neural network architechture
In our model-agnostic approach we used a deep neural network (DNN) [79, 80] to fit the data. A DNN is a universal function
generator. The reason we chose a DNN over other machine learning frameworks (i.e. decisions trees, random forests, SVM
etc.) is the ease with which it can be use for a regression to noisy data to extract the underlying function. We will describe in
brief the choice of the network architechture.
We started with a small DNN with 1 input node for t˜, 2 hidden layers, each with 4 nodes and 1 output layer for Ñ(t˜). All
layers were fully connected as shown in Figure 6. The activation function used was the sigmoid function. The solution to the
LM is a sigmoid function and hence the transmission of Type 1 can be fairly explained with a just one sigmoid function that
connects the input t˜ to the output Ñ(t˜). This is not possible though for transmission of Type II which shows clear deviation
from the LM. However, in the model agnostic approach we did not want to introduce any model biases through assumptions
of functional form. Hence we used a larger (and deeper) neural network with 33 parameters to begin with. We scaled up the

2 Hidden Layers -- 4 nodes each (33 parameters)

Figure 6. A representative architechture of the DNN used for the model-agnostic analysis to fit Ñ(t˜) as a function of t˜.
For the final analysis we used a similar architechture with 3 layers each with 16 nodes to keep the analysis as model-agnostic as
possible. To regulate the training of the DNN we used an early callback procedure which stops the training when the validation
loss stops decreasing thus avoiding training biases.

network to 3 hidden layers each with 16 nodes to check for the stability of our approach. The regression with the DNN with 2
hidden layers with 4 nodes each gave almost the same fit as the one with 3 hidden layers with 16 nodes each having a total of
593 parameters. To keep our method as general as possible and not introduce model biases from the activation function we
decided to use the larger DNN with 3 hidden layers each having 16 nodes.
In addition, we tested the DNN with other activation function like tanh and relu. For tanh a somewhat wider and deeper
network was needed to fit to the data. With the relu activation the network needed to be very large. Hence, we used the sigmoid
activation function for the final DNN architecture.
Even though the DNN we used was not so large we used an early callback algorithm to stop the training of the network
when the validation loss stopped decreasing to avoid overtraining and chose the epoch where the validation loss was the least.
The loss function that we used was a simple mean square error function which measures the L2 distance of the fit from the data.
The training time was a few seconds with the early stopping coming into effect at about 100-150 epochs. The trained DNN was
used for making prediction for the ongoing phases
