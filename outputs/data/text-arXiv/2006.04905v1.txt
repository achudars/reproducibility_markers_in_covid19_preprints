Abstract. Human to human transmissible infectious diseases spread in a population using
human interactions as its transmission vector. The early stages of such an outbreak can be
modeled by a graph whose edges encode these interactions between individuals, the vertices.
This article attempts to account for the case when each individual entails in different kinds
of interactions which have therefore different probabilities of transmitting the disease. The
majority of these results can be also stated in the language of percolation theory.
The main contributions of the article are: (1) Extend to this setting some results which
were previously known in the case when each individual has only one kind of interactions. (2)
Find an explicit formula for the basic reproduction number R0 which depends only on the
probabilities of transmitting the disease along the different edges and the first two moments
of the degree distributions of the associated graphs. (3) Motivated by the recent Covid-19
pandemic, we use the framework developed to compute the R0 of a model disease spreading
in populations whose trees and degree distributions are adjusted to several different countries.
In this setting, we shall also compute the probability that the outbreak will not lead to an
epidemic. In all cases we find such probability to be very low if no interventions are put in
place.

1. Introduction
The vector by which several infectious diseases propagate in a population is the human to
human interaction. It is therefore natural to model their spread using such interactions as

the “basic mechanism”. In general, it gives rise to a dynamic process which evolves in time
with its early stages being reasonably well approximated by considering the patient zero as
the root (apex) of a tree whose branches encode the interactions through which the disease
can propagate. In such epidemiological and percolation problems it is commonly assumed
that each individual has an equal probability to transmit the disease to any of its contacts.
However, this is an over-simplification of the actual situation as the same person can have
several classes of interactions. Namely, it is conceivable that it is more likely that an infected
individual will transmit the disease to someone with which it maintains a close familiar
relation than to someone which it sporadically meets. In this setting we shall encode these
different probabilities of transmitting the disease by distinct trees T1 , . . . , Tn all with the same
root which is the patient zero. To each tree Ti we associated a probability Ti of transmitting
the disease along an interaction modeled by the corresponding tree. In the case when the Ti
are all the same for each vertex (individual) it is known that the basic reproduction number
R0 controls the possibility of almost surely avoiding an epidemic, see [Br, Ha, Ja, KA, Sc] and
[Ca] which phrases these results in terms of the percolation interpretation. When there are
different Ti a similar framework can be used to prove the following result.
Theorem 1. Suppose the basic reproduction number R0 < 1, then the outbreak will almost
surely, i.e. with probability one, not lead to an epidemic. On the other hand, if R0 > 1 there
is still a nonzero probability P ∈ (0, 1) that the outbreak will be contained.
In section 2 we shall develop the framework of multivariate generating functions on which
this work will be based. Section 3 will show how to use this framework to effectively compute
R0 and finally we will prove the main abstract results in section 4. We will then exemplify the
theory with a few examples. These are instructive in order to unravel an explicit formula for
R0 which does not depend on any “abstract” generating function. Such a formula is deduced
in section 6 where we show the following result.
Theorem 2. For each j ∈ {1, . . . , n} let E(kj ) denote the average degree of the tree Tj and
σ(kj ) the standard deviation of the associated degree distribution. Suppose that a fraction Q
of all infected individuals is completely isolated and does not transmit the disease to anyone.
Then, if the probability of transmitting the disease along an arm of the tree Tj is Tj ∈ [0, 1],
the basic reproduction number is

A somewhat interesting feature of the previous formula is that it together with the
transmission probabilities {Ti }ni=1 , it depends solely on the first two moments of the degree
distribution of the trees encoding the interactions.
As a final application of the theory, and motivated by the recent outbreak of Covid-19,
we reserve the last section to do some specific country analysis. We have attempted to
make the parameters of the theory be somewhat adequate to model the initial spread of
Covid-19 but the results should be regarded as an “academic” toy example. A more robust
analysis using our framework is possible, but would require detailed knowledge on the habits,
family ties/interactions, attendace of public gatherings and other features of the analyzed
populations, which are not uniform in each country. That last section computes the relevant
values of R0 for the countries considered and the probabilities that the outbreak will be
contained. As we shall see, these are very small and in order to increase it we will investigate
the effect of quarantining part of the infected individuals.

2. Generating functions
2.1. From the generating vertex. Let T be a graph having a tree structure and whose
edges are divided into n groups. Each of groups gives rise to subgraphs Ti ⊂ T having the
same vertices and the edges of the corresponding group. We will also assume that Ti ⊂ T has
a tree structure. For each of these trees Ti , for i = 1, . . . , n, we shall denote by {Pi (k)}k∈N0
the corresponding degree distribution, i.e. for a randomly chosen vertex its degree is k with
probability Pi (k). Using these we can construct the corresponding generating functions
Gi (x) =

Remark 1. One can readily check that Gi (0) = 0, Gi (1) = 1 and Gi (x) converges for |x| ≤ 1.

Furthermore, we compute that G0i (x) = +∞
and thus the average degree E(ki )
k=1 kPi (k)x
of the tree Ti is
E(ki ) = G0i (1).

Similarly, we find that from G(x, . . . , x) the total average degree is

Each of these trees corresponds to different classes of contacts which have unequal probability
of transmitting the disease. For instance, people that live in the same house are more likely
to transmit the disease to each other than those which occasionally meet on public transport.
Thus, to each tree, i.e., to each class of interactions, we associate a probability of transmission
Ti and assume with no loss of generality that T1 > . . . > Tn . Fix m1 , . . . , mn , then the
probability that a randomly picked first infected individual transmits the disease to mi other
individuals along the tree Ti is

Further suppose there is a probability Q that an infected individual is detected and quarantined
in complete isolation. Then, if m1 + . . . + mn 6= 0, the probability above must be multiplied
by a factor of 1 − Q which accounts for the possibility that it is not quarantined. At this
point, it is convenient to define the generating function

2.2. By following a random infection. Suppose we place ourselves at a vertex which
is obtained from following a randomly chosen transmission. As an element of the tree Ti ,
the ramification of this vertex is the number of remaining edges emanating from it. The
probability that such a vertex has ramification k1 , . . . , kn is therefore proportional to

with each term accounting from the probability of arriving at the chosen vertex via a given
tree. Normalizing this we find that such probability P̃ (k1 , . . . , kn ) is obtained from the
previous formula by dividing by
E(k) = E(k1 ) + . . . + E(kn ) = G01 (1) + . . . + G0n (1),

3. The basic reproduction number
The basic reproduction number, usually denoted by R0 , is defined as the average number
of individuals which are infected by each previously infected one. In our setting this can be
immediately computed as follows. First, suppose we stand at a randomly chosen individual
which has ramification (k1 , . . . , kn ). The average number of individuals it infects is

Comparing this with the formula for Z̃(x) we conclude the following result.
Proposition 1. The basic reproduction number can be obtained from the generating function

4. Containing an outbreak
In this section we shall compute the probability that the infection as it propagates eventually
dies out. In the case of a unique tree, i.e. assuming all interactions have the same probability
of transmitting the disease, such a computation have been carried out in [Br]. See also
[Ha, Ja, KA, Sc] for related results and [Ca] for the same setup in the context of the theory of
percolation.
Consider an individual which has been infected by another one, i.e. a vertex of the tree T
which is not its root and consider the probability that the infections generated by that vertex
disappear within N generations. Denote such a probability by pN , then

with equation 4.1 yielding all the following iterations. From inspection we find that P1 :=
Z̃(P0 ) > P0 and as Z̃ is increasing we find assuming PN −1 > PN −2 that
PN − PN −1 = Z̃(PN −1 ) − G̃(PN −2 ) > 0,
which inductively proves that the sequence {PN }N ∈N0 is increasing. Hence, the number
P∞ = lim PN ∈ [0, 1],
N →+∞

is well defined and encodes the probability that the infection starting from any such individual
eventually dies out. We can then conclude the following.
Proposition 2. The probability P∞ that the chain of infections generated from a randomly
infected individual eventually disappears in a finite number of generations satisfies
P∞ = Z̃(P∞ ).
Furthermore, there ate most two fixed points of Z̃ in [0, 1].
Proof. The fact that P∞ satisfies P∞ = Z̃(P∞ ) follows immediately from the preceding
discussion. Hence, the only remaining item to be shown is that there are at most two fixed
points of Z̃ in the interval [0, 1]. The fact that there is at least one is obvious as Z̃(1) = 1.
We must now show that there is at most one other.
We argue by contradiction and assume there are at least two other different fixed points
P∗ < P∗∗ both in (0, 1).1 First, notice that both Z̃ 0 , Z̃ 00 are positive in (0, 1). Secondly,
consider the function f (x) = x − Z̃(x) whose zeros correspond to the fixed points of Z̃, we
have
f (0) > 0, f (P∗ ) = 0, f (P∗ ∗) = 0, f (1) = 0.
Hence, by the intermediate value theorem there must be two critical points c∗ ∈ (P∗ , P∗∗ )
and c∗∗ ∈ (P∗∗ , 1) of f . As in (0, 1) we have f 00 (x) = −Z̃ 00 (x) < 0 we have that each of these
must a maximum. Again, by the intermediate value theorem, between the two maxima must
be a minimum c∗∗∗ ∈ (c∗ , c∗∗ ) contradicting f 00 (c∗∗∗ ) < 0.

1We

assume with no loss of generality that P∗ , P∗∗ are positive as Z̃(0) = P0 6= 0 and so 0 can never be a
fixed point.

= Z(P∞ ),
where the last equality follows from comparison with the formula 2.1 for the generating
function for infections starting from the patient zero.
4.1. The case when R0 < 1. We shall now prove that when the basic reproduction number
is smaller than one, the chain of infections will almost surely extinguish.
Theorem 3. If R0 < 1, then both P and P∞ equal 1.
Proof. By proposition 2 we know that P∞ it must be a fixed point of Z̃. Furthermore, we
know that Z̃(1) = 1 and so the statement follows if we can show that there is no other fixed
point of Z̃ in the interval [0, 1]. In that direction we shall show that under the hypothesis
that R0 < 1 the map
Z̃ : [0, 1] → [0, 1]
is a contraction and so has a unique fixed point which must therefore the 1. This follows
immediately from realizing that Z̃ 00 is nonnegative and so Z̃ 0 (x) ≤ Z̃ 0 (1) = R0 by 1. Hence,
for x, y ∈ [0, 1] we have
!
|Z̃(x) − Z̃(y)| ≤

sup Z̃ 0 (t) |x − y| ≤ R0 |x − y|,
t∈[0,1]

which shows that Z̃ is a contraction if R0 < 1.
Finally, the fact that also P = 1 is then a consequence of P = Z(P∞ ) = Z(1) = 1.

Remark 3 (The minimum required quarantined). At the beginning of an outbreak the
question arises of what is the minimum number of infected individuals that must be detected
and subsequently quarantined in order to contain the possible epidemic outbreak.
If the disease is already well known, such as flu, measles or any other standard disease,
not Covid-19, then its “free” basic reproduction number R0f ree is known. Of course, this may
depend on local conditions of where the outbreak takes place. By “free” we intend to emphasize
that this is the basic reproduction number when the disease is free to propagate without taking
in account any non-pharmaceutical intervention directed to slow its spread.
Now, suppose an aggressive testing capacity can be put in place in order to detect those which

10

GONÇALO OLIVEIRA

have been infected. We would like to know the minimal fraction Q of infected individuals
which must be completely isolated so that the outbreak is almost surely controlled without
having to take any other measures. The answer, as we shall now see is that Q > 1 − Rf1ree .
0

The generating functions Z̃ f ree and Z̃ can both be written as in equation 2.4 with the exception
that Q = 0 for Z̃ f ree . Hence, Z̃ = Q + (1 − Q)Z̃ f ree and by Proposition 1 we find
R0 = Z̃ 0 (1) = (1 − Q)(Z̃ f ree )0 (1) = (1 − Q)R0f ree .
Then, the condition R0 < 1 required to apply Theorem 3 turns into
Q>1−

1
R0f ree

,

which corroborates the common intuition behind the basic reproduction number. For example,
suppose there is an outbreak of disease for which each infected individual is expected to infect
3 others if nothing is done to prevent it, i.e. R0f ree , then we expect that in order to cut the
chain of transmission less than a third of the infections can be allowed to transmit the disease.
Indeed, from the above computation, at least Q > 2/3 of the whole infected must be detected
and isolated.
4.2. The case when R0 > 1. Finally, in the case when R0 > 1 we shall now prove that
there is still a positive, but not certain, probability that the infection disappears.
Theorem 4. If R0 > 1, then P∞ ∈ (0, 1) and P = Z(P∞ ) ∈ (0, 1).
Proof. In this setup we consider the function f (x) = x − Z̃(x) used in the proof of Proposition
2. This satisfies f (0) = −Z̃(0) < 0, f (1) = 0 and by Proposition 1 f 0 (1) = 1 − R0 < 0 and so
f (1 − ε) > 0 for sufficiently small nonzero ε  1. Thus, again the intermediate value theorem
shows the existence of a zero of f which we shall denote by x∗ ∈ (0, 1 − ε). Recalling that
zeros of f correspond to fixed points of Z̃ which by Proposition 2 has only x∗ and 1 as fixed
points. Thus, in this case we can also have P∞ = x∗ .

Remark 4 (Lower bounds for P and P∞ ). From the fixed point equation P∞ = Z̃(P∞ ) and
writing the generating function Z̃ as in Remark 3, i.e. Z̃(x) = Q + (1 − Q)Z̃ f ree (x), we find
that
P∞ = Q + (1 − Q)Z̃ f ree (P∞ ),
and so P∞ − Q = (1 − Q)Z̃ f ree (P∞ ) > 0 and so
P∞ > Q.
Furthermore, we can equally write P = Z(P∞ ) = Q + (1 − Q)Z̃(P∞ ). Said in other words,
we find that the probability of the infection eventually dying out is at least the fraction of
infected individuals which are completely isolated.

4.3. The case when R0 = 1. We shall now consider the case when R0 = 1. We go back
to the setup in the proof of Proposition 2 and Theorem 3, namely we consider the function
f (x) = x − Z̃(x) whose zeros correspond to the fixed points of the map Z̃ : [0, 1] → [0, 1]. We
have seen that f 00 (x) < 0 in (0, 1) and f (1) = 0. Under the hypothesis that R0 = 1 we have
f 0 (1) = 1 − R0 = 0 and as f 00 (x) < 0 for x < 1 we find that f is negative immediately before
x = 1. Hence, if there was another zero x∗ ∈ (0, 1) of f , between (x∗ , 1) the function f would
have a minimum which contradicts f 00 < 0 in (0, 1). We then conclude that also in this case
P = P∞ = 1.
4.4. Lower bounds on P. In this section we shall elaborate on the question raised in
Remark 4, namely: Whether it is possible to find lower bounds on the probability that the
chain of infections eventually dies out not leading to an epidemic.
To answer the question raised we proceed by direct inspection of the fixed point equation
in Proposition 2. Start by noticing that all the terms in the Taylor series for Z̃ are positive
as one can check from its definition in equation 2.4. Thus, as P∞ = Z̃(P∞ ) we find that P∞
is larger than the zeroth order term of Z̃, i.e.
P∞ > Z̃(0),
and from the monotonicity of Z(x) we then have
P > Z(Z̃(0)),
which is itself grater than Z(0).
5. Examples
In the simplest nontrivial example we can consider a population in which individuals have
to kinds of interactions: a close and continuous interaction with their family and friends, and
a a more distant sporadic interaction with not so close friends and other people which cross
their path, by chance, in their daily lives as they commute to work and so on. Of course, we
expect the probability of transmitting the disease to be larger in the first case and so assign
to a it a larger transmissibility T1 than to the second interactions T2 , i.e. T1 > T2 .
5.1. Delta and Poisson. In this first example we assume for simplicity that all person have
the same number, N1 ≥ 1, of close contacts and their sporadic contacts follow a Poisson
distribution with intensity N2 . In formulas, we have
N2k2 −N2
P1 (k1 ) = δN1 k1 , and P2 (k2 ) =

Then, we find the generating function for the degree distribution

= Q + (1 − Q)(1 − T1 (1 − x))N1 e−N2 T2 (1−x) .
In order to compute Z̃(x) we may first find the generating function G̃(x1 , x2 ) for the ramification distribution. This can be done using equation 2.3 which yields
G̃(x1 , x2 ) =

G1 (x1 )G02 (x2 ) + G01 (x1 )G2 (x2 )

We can finally use this to compute the generating function Z̃ using the formula 2.4. This
gives
Z̃(x) = Q + (1 − Q)G̃(1 − T1 (1 − x), 1 − T2 (1 − x))
N1 + N2 (1 − T1 (1 − x))

Notice in particular that R0 scales homogeneously with degree 1 as a function of N1 , N2 , T1 , T2 .
Remark 5. Notice that in the case N1 = 0, i.e. if only the sporadic contacts occur, we have
R0 = (1 − Q)N2 T2 , while if N2 = 0 meaning that all sporadic contacts are cut out, then
R0 = (1 − Q)(N1 − 1)T1 .
Also, by evaluating the generating function at x = 0 we find

5.2. Polynomial and Poisson I. In this second model we will elaborate slightly on the
first example, in the sense that we still assume everyone to establishes sporadic contacts
following a Poisson distribution with intensity N2 . On the other hand, we shall encode the
distribution of close contacts by a polynomial of degree N ≥ 1. Furthermore, let N1 be the
average degree of the distribution of close contacts, i.e. N1 := G01 (1). In formulas, we have
P1 (k1 ) =

As in the previous case, we can now find the generating function for these degree distributions
−N2 (1−x2 )
1
G1 (x1 ) = p0 + p1 x + . . . + pN1 xN
,
1 , and G2 (x2 ) = e

and compute G(x1 , x2 ) = G1 (x1 )e−N2 (1−x2 ) . Then,
Z(x) = Q + (1 − Q)G1 (1 − T1 (1 − x))e−N2 T2 (1−x) ,
and to compute Z̃(x) we start by obtaining the generating function G̃(x1 , x2 ) for the ramification distribution.Equation 2.3 yields
G̃(x1 , x2 ) =

(log G1 (x1 ))0 + N2
G1 (x1 )e−N2 (1−x2 ) .
N1 + N2

Finally using equation 2.4 as before, we find
Z̃(x) = Q + (1 − Q)

G01 (1 − T1 (1 − x)) + N2 G1 (1 − T1 (1 − x)) −N2 T2 (1−x)
e
,
N1 + N2

from which we can compute R0 using Proposition 1, i.e. using the formula Z̃ 0 (1). This
requires computing the derivative of Z̃ which reads

Z̃ 0 (x) = (1 − Q)T1

and so
R0 = (1 − Q)T1

G001 (1) + N2 N1
+ (1 − Q)N2 T2 .
N1 + N2

Remark 6. In order to evaluate R0 more clearly, we must understand what is G001 (1). This can

be computed for any distribution {P (k)}k∈N0 with generating function G(x) = +∞
k=0 P (k)x .

Notice in particular that R0 scales homogeneously with degree 1 as a function of N1 , N2 , T1 , T2 .
We turn now to compute lower bounds on P and P∞ following the strategy of section 4.4,

5.3. Polynomial and Poisson II. We shall now continue with a population organized
as in the previous example but we assume that a fraction f of the population decides to
social isolate and cut its sporadic contacts. One can imagine this can be done by not going
into public transport, reducing contact with unknown people and working from home. To
implement this we modify the previous example by writing

5.4. Poisson and Poisson. In this final example we split the contacts again in two groups,
the familiar close interactions and distant sporadic ones. In contrast to the previous examples
we shall assume a Poisson distribution for both of these classes of contacts having intensity N1
and N2 respectively. As in example 5.3 we will be assuming that a fractions of the population
are isolating by cutting their contacts. To work with some generality we will assume that
fraction f1 of the population cuts its close contacts and another fraction f2 2 cuts its sporadic
contacts. Then, the degree distributions of the relevant trees T1 and T2 are
P1 (k1 ) = f1 δ0k1 + (1 − f1 )

and compute G(x1 , x2 ) = (f1 + (1 − f1 )e−N1 (1−x1 ) )(f2 + (1 − f2 )e−N2 (1−x2 ) ). Then,
Z(x) = Q + (1 − Q)(f1 + (1 − f1 )e−N1 T1 (1−x) )(f2 + (1 − f2 )e−N2 T2 (1−x) ),

is probably reasonable to assume that f2 ≥ f1 .

Theorem 5. For each j ∈ {1, . . . , n} let E(kj ) denote the mean degree of the tree Tj and
σ(kj ) its standard deviation. Suppose that a fraction Q of all infected individuals is completely
isolated and does not transmit the disease to anyone. Then, if the probability of transmitting
the disease along an arm of the tree Tj is Tj ∈ [0, 1], the basic reproduction number is

7. Applications
We shall now apply these results to a realistic scenario where a disease spreads through a
population. Our goal is to investigate the possibility of an effective combination of isolation
of infectious individuals, and practicing of social distancing, which together are capable
of bringing R0 below the threshold of 1. When that is not possible we will compute the
probability of an epidemic developing.
7.1. Random contacts occurring with two different constant rates. We shall use the
setup of example 5.4 where the contacts established by the population in two groups. These
are the close and distant contacts encoded in the trees T1 and T2 respectively. As in that
example we assume both degree distributions to be Poisson, having intensities N1 and N2 .

18

GONÇALO OLIVEIRA

The fractions of the population which are cutting their close contacts is f1 and that cutting
its sporadic contacts f2 . We will also be assuming that f2 ≥ f1 as it seems reasonable to
assume that everyone which cuts its close contacts also cuts its sporadic ones.
As computed in example 5.4, the basic reproduction number is


(1 − f1 )f1 N12 T1 + (1 − f2 )f2 N22 T2
.
R0 = (1 − Q) (1 − f1 )N1 T1 + (1 − f2 )N2 T2 +
(1 − f1 )N1 + (1 − f2 )N2
When no intervention is made all f1 , f2 and Q vanish the disease is free to propagate and the
corresponding basic reproduction number will be denoted by
R0f ree = N1 T1 + N2 T2 .
Example 1. Suppose for the sake of simplicity that f1 = f = f2 . Then, R0 can be reqritten
in terms of R0f ree as follows


N12 T1 + N22 T2
R0 = (1 − Q) (1 − f )(N1 T1 + N2 T2 ) + f
N1 + N2


N1 N2
= (1 − Q) R0f ree − f
(T1 + T2 ) .
N1 + N2
Then, the condition that R0 < 1 which is sufficient to contain the outbreak turns into


N1 + N2
1
1
f ree
R0 −
f>
.
N1 N2 T1 + T2
1−Q
For example, suppose that Q = 1/10, T1 = 1/2, T2 = 1/50 and N1 = 4, N2 = 50. Then,
R0f ree = 3 which is actually a reasonable assumption a disease such as Covid-19 and the
computation above yields f > 51/52 which seems extremely difficult to achieve. On the other
hand, if Q = 1/2 while all other parameters remain the same f > 27/52 ≈ 0.52 which seems
a much more achievable goal.
The previous example assumes that one can also cut the close contacts and that is not a
reasonable assumption in most situations. For instance, many people may leave in the same
house in which way it is not possible to cut such contacts. In the next example we address
this and suppose only the sporadic contacts are cut.
Example 2. Only cutting the sporadic contacts corresponds to having f1 = 0. Then, R0 can
be is


(1 − f2 )f2 N22 T2
R0 = (1 − Q) N1 T1 + (1 − f2 )N2 T2 +

R0f ree − 1−Q

N2 R0f ree − 1−Q
+ N1 T2

We shall now use the same numerical values as in the previous example, T1 = 1/2, T2 = 1/50
and N1 = 4, N2 = 50. Then, we find from the previous computation that f2 > 1 for any value
of Q ≤ 1/2. Hence, there is no way of surely containing the disease simply from cutting out
the sporadic contacts and not increasing Q above 1/2. Suppose then the borderline case when
Q = 1/2 and consider the setting where also f2 = 1/2 of the population is capable of cutting
their sporadic contacts. Then, we have

from which we find
P∞ ≈ 0.531, and P ≈ 0.594,
i.e. the probability of an epidemic forming, which is given by 1 − P, is approximately 0.406.

7.2. Some country based analysis. We shall now due some country based analysis using
the household composition from the United Nations database [UN]. This analysis is motivated
by the current pandemic of Coronavirus. However, given the existence of insufficient knowledge
to estimate the Ti and the rude data from the beginning of the outbreak, this section should
be regarded as within the realm of academic exercise. We shall use a simple model with two
trees T1 and T2 with the first modeling the close interactions and given by the household
composition of the respective country with the degree distribution being encoded in a
generating function G1 (x1 ) which is then a polynomial. The second tree is intended to
model the sporadic interactions in public gatherings. Assuming these to occur as a constant
rate, the most suitable degree distribution is the Poisson of some intensity, say N2 , so that
G2 (x2 ) = e−N2 (1−x2 ) . Having this in mind, we shall use the model of sections 5.2 and 5.3
above. In all cases we shall consider, we have from those examples
G1 (x1 ) = p0 + p1 x + . . . + p5 x51 , and G2 (x2 ) = f + (1 − f )e−N2 (1−x2 ) ,
so that writing N1 = G01 (1)

7.2.1. Germany. We start with the case of Germany, which according to the United Nations
database [UN] has a household distribution in which 40% of the population live alone, 47%
with one or two other individuals, 13% with three or four other and 1% with more than five
other. The reader may note that we have not stated what is the exact percentage that live
with only one or two other individuals. This is because such data is hard to locate for a large
number of countries and we believe it will make little different in the qualitative, but also
quantitative errors such as estimating the transmission probabilities T1 and T2 . Indeed, there
are more serious issues contributing to quantitative deviations. Thus, we will assume that
half of the corresponding 47% live with one other individual and the other half with two
other ones. Similar remarks hold for the 13% of the population that lives with three or four
other individuals.
Remark 7. Of course, if all households remain isolated there is no way for the disease to
spread from one household to another. However, we know this is not a realistic situation as in
general there are close family ties connecting individuals in living in different houses. Given
the difficulty in quantifying this we shall simply use the household composition to model the
degree distribution of the tree T1 .
Based on the data mentioned above we shall assume that
G1 (x1 ) = 0.4 + 0.235x1 + 0.235x21 + 0.065x31 + 0.065x41 + 0.01x51 .
As for the transmission rates, we will set T1 = 2/3, i.e. the probability of infecting a close
family member is 2/3. In a similar way, we shall assume that the probability of infecting
one of the sporadic contacts is T2 = 1/50 and the average number of sporadic contacts is
N2 = 100. This includes everyone that an infected person stays next to in public transport,
markets, restaurants, work and other common areas. Of course, these numbers are debatable
and we have chosen these simply to illustrate the theory. Using them, and assuming that
both Q = 0 and f = 0 we compute that N1 = 1.21 and
R0 ≈ 2.81.
Then, iterating Z̃(Pn ) six times the sequence appears to stabilize around P∞ ≈ 0.0852 which
gives
P ≈ Z(P∞ ) ≈ 0.0855.
See figure 1 where the intersection point P∞ can be visualized graphically. Hence, according
to the model there is a very slight chance, of approximately 8.6% that the outbreak will not
lead to an epidemic. Of course, this assumes that no non-pharmaceutical interventions have

been put in place to control the outbreak. Suppose for instance that strict social distancing
outside the household is imposed so that everyone adheres to it, which corresponds to f = 1.
Then, a computation shows that R0 ≈ 1.01 > 1 and so is not yet enough to almost surely
guarantee that the outbreak will not lead to an epidemic. Also, getting all the population
to cut its sporadic contacts seems very difficult to achieve in practice. A more efficient and
easier to achieve strategy seems to be that of identifying and isolating infected individuals
and we shall now analyze it. For example, motivated by the case of Covid-19 let us consider a
disease for which around 17% or 18% of individuals are asymptomatic. These estimates where
obtained for Covid-19 in airport screening and the data from the Diamond Princess cruise
ship, see [B], [S]. However, the validity of extrapolating thezse estimates to the remaining
population is debatable as other studies seem to have quite disparate estimates for the fraction
of asymptomatic carriers, see for instance [M]. Let us say then, that at least 0.18 of all infected
individuals will not be detected, i.e Q < 1 − 0.18. We choose, for simplicity Q = 0.7 and
f = 0 which yields R0 ≈ 0.84 and the outbreak will almost surely be contained. As another
example, suppose that Q = 0.6 which is easier to achieve practically, then even with f = 0.9
we have R0 ≈ 1.05 > 1 and so it would be needed f > 0.9 which, again, is very difficult to
achieve in practice. The conclusion is that, to contain the spread of the disease, it is much
easier and effective to quarantine a sufficient fraction of infected individuals effectively than
to simply cut the sporadic contacts of a large fraction of the entire population.

7.2.2. Italy. We shall now consider the Italian case, and based on [UN] we shall assume that
G1 (x1 ) = 0.31 + 0.235x1 + 0.235x21 + 0.105x31 + 0.105x41 + 0.1x51 .

Then, using the same parameters as in the previous example we compute R0 ≈ 3 and
P∞ ≈ 0.068 so that
P ≈ Z(P∞ ) ≈ 0.068,
i.e. there is chance of 6.8% that an outbreak can be avoided with taking any precautions.
Still, as a matter of comparison we find that if Q = 0.7 then R0 ≈ 0.9 which even though
below 1 is visibly higher than that of the previous example.
7.2.3. France. For modeling France, we set
G1 (x1 ) = 0.35 + 0.235x1 + 0.235x21 + 0.08x31 + 0.08x41 + 0.2x51 .
which with the same parameters of the previous two examples yields R0 ≈ 3.09 and P∞ ≈ 0.039
which gives
P ≈ Z(P∞ ) ≈ 0.066,
yielding a probability of 6.6% to avoid an outbreak. When Q = 0.7 we compute R0 ≈ 0.92
which being below 1 is larger than that of the previous two examples.
7.2.4. Portugal. For Portugal, the United Nations database [UN] suggests using
G1 (x1 ) = 0.19 + 0.28x1 + 0.28x21 + 0.115x31 + 0.115x41 + 0.2x51 .
Again, with the same parameters used in the previous examples we find R0 ≈ 3.4 and
P∞ ≈ 0.04. This gives
P ≈ Z(P∞ ) ≈ 0.04,
which yields a probability of 3.9% to avoid an outbreak. In this case, when Q = 0.7 we
find R0 ≈ 1.019 which in contrast with the previous examples is already above 1. Thus, by
Theorem 3 the probability P of avoiding an epidemic is below 1. Nevertheless, a computation
shows that P ≈ 0.984 which is still quite high.
7.2.5. Spain. In the case of Spain we assume, using the same reference, that
G1 (x1 ) = 0.19 + 0.265x1 + 0.265x21 + 0.13x31 + 0.13x41 + 0.3x51 .
Again, with the same parameters used in the previous examples we find R0 ≈ 3.44 and
P∞ ≈ 0.039. This gives
P ≈ Z(P∞ ) ≈ 0.039,
which yields a probability of 3.9% to avoid an outbreak. In this case, when Q = 0.7 we find
R0 ≈ 1.03 as in the previous example. Indeed, the whole situation is very much parallel as
that of the previous example.
7.2.6. Brazil. For Brazil we have
G1 (x1 ) = 0.12 + 0.235x1 + 0.235x21 + 0.16x31 + 0.16x41 + 0.9x51 ,

and with the same parameters of the previous examples we find R0 ≈ 3.82 which is the
highest so far. Using this distributions we compute P∞ ≈ 0.026 which has
P ≈ Z(P∞ ) ≈ 0.026,
which yields a very small probability of 2.6% to avoid an outbreak. In this case, even when
Q = 0.7 we find R0 ≈ 1.146 which is still high. Indeed, the associated probability of avoiding
an outbreak is P ≈ 0.92, i.e. there is a chance of 92% of containing the outbreak.
