ABSTRACT
Background: Imported COVID-19 cases, if unchecked, can jeopardize the effort of domestic
containment. We aim to find out what sustainable border control options for different entities
(e.g., countries, states) exist during the reopening phases, given their own choice of domestic
control measures and new technologies such as contact tracing.
Methods: We propose a SUIHR model, which represents an extension to the discrete time SIR
models. The model focuses on studying the spreading of virus predominantly by
asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic patients. Imported risk and (1-tier) contact tracing are
both built into the model. Under plausible parameter assumptions, we seek sustainable border
control policies, in combination with sufficient internal measures, which allow entities to
confine the virus without the need to revert back to more restrictive life styles or to rely on
herd immunity.
Results: When the basic reproduction number ùëπùëπùüéùüé of COVID-19 exceeds 2.5, even 100%
effective contact tracing alone is not enough to contain the spreading. For an entity that has
completely eliminated the virus domestically, and resumes ‚Äúnormal‚Äù, very strict predeparture screening and test and isolation upon arrival combined with effective contact
tracing can only delay another outbreak by 6 months. However, if the total net imported cases
are non-increasing, and the entity employs a confining domestic control policy, then the total
new cases can be contained even without border control.
Conclusion: Extremely strict boarder control measures in China, which has eliminated
domestic spreading, are justifiable. However such harsh mesasure are not necessary for other
places. Entities successfully confining the virus by internal measures can open up to similar
entities without additional border controls so long as the imported risk stays non-increasing.
Opening the borders to entities lacking sufficient internal control of the virus should be
exercised in combination with pre-departure screening and tests upon arrival.

and territories have started the phase of reopening to recover their economy. Thereby, when and
how to reopen the borders has become a heated topic. While there is little doubt that travel and
tourism contribute greatly to the economy, reopening the border in an unstructured manner is likely
to increase the risk of a spike of cases and new lockdown orders.
While stricter control measures are more effective in reducing the imported cases, they are also
more costly to administrate and less favorable for the general public. For example, China has
implemented an extremely strict border entrance policy. Travelers must first check-in 14 continuous
days on a mobile app to obtain a green health code, and provide a recent nucleic acid negative test
certificate and an IgM anti-body negative test certificate pre-departure to the Chinese embassy in
the origin country1,2. Upon arrival, travelers must undergo immediate tests, followed by a 14-day
institutional mandatory quarantine. At the end of the quarantine period, only those who provide
another negative test are released. On top of that, the number of international travelers into China is
also constrained3. While these harsh measures worked in China, they are not necessarily optimal for
other places (if even possible). Therefore, when assessing the risks associated with opening the
borders against other social and economic interest, it is crucial for governments to understand what
the least restrictive but sustainable options are, which are still consistent with their own domestic
policy targets.
This paper proposes a holistic approach to study border control policies against COVID-19
during reopening phases. Border control measures are studied in conjunction with domestic control
measures, with a special focus on contact tracing. Domestic control strategies against corona vary
strongly across countries. We classify government entities (e.g., states, or countries) in the world
into three major groups based on their internal strategies; G1 entities able to completely eliminate
domestic cases and then started to reopen, e.g., China and New Zealand. G2 entities aim to keep
COVID-19 under check until effective vaccines are widely deployed and have started to reopen
before the virus was completely eliminated. Many European Union countries belong to this group,
where the strictness of confinement measures varies according to the current infection dynamics.
G3 entities are those going towards herd immunity either strategically or involuntarily. Our results
show that the necessary strictness for border control policies to be sustainable varies strongly for the
three types of entity groups.
Optimal policies facing the trade-off between health and economic damage has always been a
heated topic4. It has been confirmed that social distancing and lockdowns were successful in
bringing down the number of new infections5-9, but also lead to labor market slump10. Similarly, a
combination of targeted policies with contact tracing is shown to be very effective in preventing a
high death toll4,11. Tracing together with local lockdowns is shown to be successful in China and
Vietnam12, but may be difficult to exercise elsewhere. A more acceptable trace and isolate method
has been developed with the help of high-tech mobile apps. Here, it is crucial that digital contact
tracing is fast enough to break infection chains13, and high proportions of contacts are successfully
traced14-17. The international spreading of the virus has been studied in the outbreak phase18. Travel
restrictions are shown to be necessary and effective in interrupting virus outbreak19,20. Border
control measures, such as syndromic cross-border screening, are found to modestly delay an
outbreak from imported cases21. Dickens et el. studied the effectiveness of test-isolate and
quarantine at the border, and showed that even the 14-day mandatory quarantine alone is not
enough to completely stop imported cases22.
The existing research has produced valuable insights on border control policies in terms of
reducing the imported cases. However, it remains to be investigated whether any border policy can
actually guarantee that the epidemic remains under control in the destination entities. Our paper
contributes to filling this gap. We discuss the necessary conditions on border controls to avoid
future lockdowns given the domestic control policies, and limits on incoming traffic from different
risk sources tailored to meet different government objectives. Using results from the literature to
calibrate our model, we provide governments guidance on sustainable border control policies.

Sustainable Border Control Policy in the COVID-19 Pandemic

METHODS
This paper proposes an extension to the Markov transition based SIR and SEIR models that have
long been used to model epidemic spreading23 and control measures such as lockdowns and
vaccines24. Our approach can be described as a S(usceptible) U(nidentified infectious) I(dentified
infectious) H(ospitalized) R(ecovered) model. In this study, we use the SUIHR model to evaluate
combinations of border and domestic control measures against COVID-19, during a reopening
phase and before a vaccine is widely deployed. The SUIHR model framework can include multiple
entities, reflecting different government bodies with different containment measures. The model
framework is tailored to study the sustainability of border control strategies combined with different
levels of internal controls and 1-tier contact tracing and isolation. A strategy is considered
sustainable when it allows an entity to control the virus over time without further tightening the
initial internal confinement measures. Additionally, levels of border openness toward different
incoming sources can be optimized conditionally on new-case targets and medical resource capacity
using our framework.

THE SUIHR MODEL
The SUIHR model has the following features. First, we explicitly model the importation of infected
individuals from one entity to another so that the effect of border control policies can be studied.
Second, the model focuses on the undetected spreading of virus from mainly pre-symptomatic or
asymptomatic people. We deliberately split the Infectious state in the SIR models into Unidentified
Infectious and Identified Infectious states, to account for the characteristics of a reopening phase
compared to the initial outbreak control phase. For example, the danger of COVID-19 is now well
known, and people have the awareness to avoid spreading once they are identified as infected.
Testing capacity increased, most people who show symptoms can get a diagnose quickly and will
be isolated. Latent/Exposed states that exist in most SEIR models are considered as part of our UI
state because pre-symptomatic spreading is known to occur with corona virus25. Third, contact
tracing is built into the model. During a reopening phase, "trace & isolate" should be preferred over
lockdowns as it is less disturbing to daily life and hence more sustainable. Fourth, constraints such
as new case targets and medical resources can be incorporated into the model framework as part of
the policy optimization process. Solutions to the model can be obtained via linear programming.
In general, unidentified and identified infectious, and recovered individuals can either be free or
isolated/quarantined. However, with our focus on reopening phases, we optimistically assume that
anyone who has been identified as infectious will be isolated immediately to avoid virus spreading.
Hospitalized people are also automatically isolated in the model. Therefore, only the Unidentified
Infectious cohort is divided into two mobility states: Free and Quarantined. In contrast to the initial
outbreak control phase, we do not consider block quarantine on susceptible people. Hence, the
marginal positive effect on reducing the virus spreading by isolating susceptible people is
negligible. Instead, the focus is on quarantining the unidentified infectious individuals.
The proposed SUIHR model is in discrete time, each time epoch is defined to be one week.
Weekly averages are commonly used to measure COVID-19 statistics and also avoid difficulties
connected to day-of-the-week effects. Government actions are taken quite quickly in times of
COVID, but a weekly frequency is sufficient in order to guide policies we are occupied with. From
a model perspective, the weekly framework allows the integration of constraints during
optimization which opens up numerous additional analytical possibilities. A different transitional
probability distributional assumption from the SIR/SEIR model is made to incorporate the states
with non-exponential stay time26. Hence, the Identified Infectious and Hospitalized states are further
divided into Stage 1 and Stage 2. For more details on the model states, see the Appendix.

CONTROL POLICY PARAMETERS
The expected number of people an infectious person can spread the virus to in a time epoch,
denoted by r, is used to measure the effectiveness of specific control policies. For example,
allowing gathering of large groups of people would increase r, while enforcing mask wear would

3

reduce it. Assuming only people in the state of unidentified infectious and free to move can travel,
only a small percentage of travelers are infectious upon arrival. This percentage, denoted by ùõºùõº, is
mainly determined by the COVID-19 severity at the origin and the pre-travel screening policies
(e.g., people must provide RNA/antibody test results prior to travel). Also, people could potentially
get infected during the trip, hence ùõºùõº upon arrival at the destination entity could be higher than at
departure. When a test upon arrival is administrated, ùúèùúè (percentage) of the infected travelers will be
identified and isolated. We use ùúèùúè = 0.91 with mandatory test for everyone upon arrival22. In the
absence of such test, ùúèùúè = 0. When there is a quarantine policy upon arrival, a certain percentage of
the unidentified infected travelers, denoted by ùõΩùõΩ, will go through a strict quarantine and won‚Äôt
spread the virus. The strictest 14-day mandatory institutional quarantine will have ùõΩùõΩ = 1, while
self-administrated home quarantine is assumed to be have ùõΩùõΩ = 0.6 as there is no guarantee
everyone will strictly abide by the rules. Contact tracing is also explicitly modeled. When someone
is identified as infected, contact tracing will reveal a percentage of the people (denoted by ùúÉùúÉ) the
newly identified person has directly contacted. Those contacts will then be quarantined
immediately. In the context of this paper, by contact tracing we will refer only to the 1-tier tracing
policy (i.e., only direct contacts of an identified case can be traced and isolated).
In order to contain the virus spreading, the effective reproduction rate must be less than 1. Herd
immunity is one way to achieve this. However, herd immunity is unlikely to be the solution for
ùêºùêº
COVID-1927. Let ‚ÑõÔøΩ = ùëÉùëÉùëàùëàùëàùëà + (1 ‚àí ùëÉùëÉùëàùëà1 ‚ãÖ ùúÉùúÉ) denote the hypothetical reproduction number of the
ùêºùêº
virus in an entity with contact tracing, assuming everyone is susceptible (ùëÉùëÉùëàùëàùëàùëà and ùëÉùëÉùëàùëà1 are
transitional probabilities, see Table 1 for their values). ‚ÑõÔøΩ is a measure of an entity‚Äôs internal
containment policy, and is to be distinguished from the observed reproduction number. For
example, if the whole population is immune, the observed reproduction number will be 0 regardless
of ‚ÑõÔøΩ. When ‚ÑõÔøΩ < 1, an entity has a confining policy for COVID-19, without the need to rely on
herd immunity or vaccine. G1 entities are opening-up internally and pushing domestic life back to
the pre-pandemic "normal". Hence, for G1 entities, ‚ÑõÔøΩ > 1 (even though the observed reproduction
number is 0). G2 entities aim to keep COVID-19 under check (i.e., ‚ÑõÔøΩ < 1) until effective vaccines
are deployed. G3 entities have ‚ÑõÔøΩ > 1 with growing new cases. We group entities based on ‚ÑõÔøΩ to
study the sustainability of policies. Nevertheless, the allowance of incoming traffic from different
entities are optimized taking their actual incidences into account via the parameter ùõºùõº.

DATA

The data used to estimate the transitional probability matrix for the SUIHR model came from
existing studies on COVID-1928-34. We acknowledge that the literature regarding COVID-19 is
constantly developing and hence the parameters used in this paper are subject to change as better
knowledge regarding the virus is available. However, the qualitative interpretation of the results in
this paper would be applicable even when the parameters would differ. Table 1 shows the
estimation of the transitional probability matrix, and the Appendix provides more details. Without
loss of generality, we choose the main and second entity of interest in simulation to have a
population of 80 and 50 million people, respectively. We assume 2% of the unidentified infectious
people would travel at each time epoch. To put this number into perspective, according to IATA
traffic data, in 2019, the number of average weekly international travelers was little less than 2% of
the total population in Germany. We assume unidentified infectious people have the same
probability of traveling as the general population. This would provide about 10 to 20 daily imported
cases to each entity initially.

RESULTS
Our study focuses on border control policies that can keep ‚ÑõÔøΩ < 1 while providing most flexibility
in life. We find that when the basic reproduction rate of an infection exceeds a certain threshold,
even perfect contact tracing (i.e., ùúÉùúÉ = 1) alone is not enough to contain the spreading (see
Appendix Lemma 1). For COVID-19, we estimate that when ùëÖùëÖ0 > 2.5 (i.e., ùëüùëü > 1.875), ‚ÑõÔøΩ > 1

4

Sustainable Border Control Policy in the COVID-19 Pandemic

even with perfect contact tracing. When the virus first broke out, the basic reproduction rate has an
average estimation of ùëÖùëÖ0 ‚âà 3.28 without any interventions35. The rationale behind this is that
COVID-19 is possible to spread without the carriers showing symptoms, hence (1-tier) contact
tracing is not 100% effective against spreading by asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic cases.
Although contract tracing alone cannot bring life back to normal, it is possible to alleviate other
measures. Assuming a base reproduction (ùëÖùëÖ0 ) rate of 2.8 in pre-pandemic normal life with no
interventions, the theoretically highest gain from contact tracing would be to achieve a realized
reproduction rate of 1.27. As shown in Appendix Figure A.6 and A.7, with good tracing (ùúÉùúÉ = 0.8),
we can allow life going back to ùëüùëü = 1.4 whereas without it, the situation will be out of control very
quickly when ùëüùëü > 0.8. Such gains might be very helpful in relaxing alternative containment
measures.
This means that G1 entities will not be able to confine the imported cases from spreading with
contact tracing alone. In our simulation study, we assume a good trace & isolation implementation
(ùúÉùúÉ = 0.8), together with a strict pre-departure screening with only 10 cases per week entering the
border. For border control measures, we consider the second-best option with mandatory test upon
arrival with isolation on positive test cases, and a 14-day home quarantine for everyone else (ùúèùúè = 0,
ùõΩùõΩ = 0.6). Under these measures, only less than 1 case per week can sneak into the entity
undetected. Such tightness of control would be ideal in reality. We assume another lockdown would
happen when identified new cases top 40 thousand a week (ca. 6000 per day). Figure 1 shows that
even these tight border controls are not enough to prevent another outbreak but only delay it for
about 26 weeks (23 weeks without the home quarantine), another lockdown would have to happen
if tighter measures are not introduced. This is consistent with the existing studies showing that
reducing traveling rates between interconnected cities can delay but not prevent the arrival of an
outbreak from an infected source21,36. The extreme tight quarantine policies China is implementing
for international travelers can be seen in the light of these results.

Lockdown Level

Figure 1: Impact of Mandatory Quarantine for G1 Entities
G2 countries, given a sufficient confining domestic control policy (i.e., ‚ÑõÔøΩ < 1 without the
imported cases), can keep the curve flattened, so long as the imported risk is not growing over time
(see Appendix Lemma 2). Assume that the infectious free people have the same probability of
traveling as the healthy people, it is possible for G2 entities to open borders towards G1 and other
G2 entities. In these two cases, screening and quarantine are not required to keep the virus
spreading in check. Nevertheless, those measures can significantly reduce the number of new cases.
We simulate the scenario that two G2 entities have complete open border towards each other and no
quarantine or screening policies are in place for travelers between them. Figure 2 shows that even
with open border, both entities are experiencing decreasing cases very similar to close border

5

Sustainable Border Control Policy in the COVID-19 Pandemic

policies between each other. We further simulate infections during the trip by doubling the number
of infected people upon arrival comparing to the numbers at departure. The simulation suggests that
even with a high infection rate on the road, both entities can withstand the imported risk and
maintain a decreasing trend for both the identified new cases and the number of hospitalized
patients over time.

Figure 2: Interaction between two G2 Entities
The same conclusion cannot be drawn for a G2 entity for opening its border to a G3 entity. G2
entities‚Äô effort to contain the virus outbreak can be jeopardized by the increasing imported cases
from G3 (Appendix Figure A.10). Additional border control policies must be applied toward
travelers from G3 entities. Indeed, the effectiveness of travel bans applied to countries with high
disease incidence has been demonstrated37. In case that G2 (and G1) entities decide to open up to
G3 entities, and mandatory quarantine with tests are not a viable or preferable option, our study
shows that combining pre-departure screening and test upon arrival may be the answer. In the
simulation study, we group all the high-risk entities with increasing cases into a single G3 entity
from the view of a G2 entity. We examine the effectiveness of the 72 hours pre-departure screening
containing either a single nucleic acid test or antigen test, which could have up to 20% false
negative according to the FDA requirements 38,39 (i.e., reduce imported cases by 80%). We use the
maximum false negative rate as a conservative assumption on the test sensitivity, to ensure the
results are not overstated. Test upon arrival with isolation (ùúèùúè = 0.9); and self-quarantine for 14-day
(ùõΩùõΩ = 0.6) are also studied along with the combination of the three control measures. Figure 3 shows
individual measures when implemented alone may not be able to avoid another lock down within
half a year when vaccines are still not widely deployed. However, the combination of pre-departure
screening with test-and-isolate and/or self-quarantine could manage the risk under the target.

Lockdown Level

Figure 3: Effectiveness of Different Control Policies toward G3 Travelers
When opening up to multiple entities consisting both G2 and G3, it is crucial to keep the total
number of imported cases under a constant level. Figure A.8 in Appendix shows that even without
any border control, at a constant 1000 imported case per week, a G2 entity can keep the infection
under control (albeit at a relatively high level of 14000 new cases per week or 2000 new cases per
day).

CONCLUSION
A new model is proposed in this paper to study the sustainability of border control policies together
with other domestic measures and contact tracing against COVID-19, during a reopening phase in
an on-going pandemic. Entities in the world are grouped into three groups based on their states of
the domestic epidemic control (G1: eliminating the virus, G2: controlling the virus, G3: witnessing
continued spread of the virus). Using our model, we can draw several policy-relevant conclusions
and recommendations. First, the effectiveness of border closures also depends on the domestic
containment measures in combination. Contact tracing with isolation is an effective method to
reduce the reproduction rate, but still some further domestic restrictions are needed. Second, G2
entities can open up to other G2 entities without additional border controls as long as the imported
risk stays non-increasing. The level of openness can be determined via linear programming using
our model, taking the entities‚Äô new case targets or medical resources as constraints; see Appendix
for technical details of the LP formulation and solutions. Once the initial level of openness is
implemented, we recommend that G2 entities closely monitor the imported cases. While that would
be possible by testing all travellers upon arrival, such restrictive and costly measures might be
undesired. An alternative would be to make use of random sampling or data from individual tests to
find out whether positive cases are travel related. When imported cases are approaching the
threshold, border controls should be tightened. Third, when opening the borders to G3 entities, predeparture screening in combination with test-and-isolate upon arrival can be used in place of the
more extreme quarantine interventions. Fourth, G1 entities should impose mandatory institutional
quarantine to travelers from any entity that has not eliminated domestic spreading of the virus. Predeparture screening is also needed when spaces for institutional quarantine are limited. The extreme
measures China is implementing is sensible against this background.
