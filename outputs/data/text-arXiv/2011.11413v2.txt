Abstract
The traditional long-term solutions for epidemic control involve eradication or herd immunity 1;2 . Neither of them will be attained within a few months for the COVID-19 pandemic.
Here, we analytically derive the existence of a third, viable solution: a stable equilibrium
at low case numbers, where test-trace-and-isolate policies partially compensate for local
spreading events, and only moderate contact restrictions remain necessary. Across wide
parameter ranges of our complementary compartmental model 3 , the equilibrium is reached
at or below 10 daily new cases per million people. Such low levels had been maintained over
months in most European countries. However, this equilibrium is endangered (i) if contact
restrictions are relaxed, or (ii) if case numbers grow too high. The latter destabilisation marks
a novel tipping point beyond which the spread self-accelerates because test-trace-and-isolate
capacities are overwhelmed. To reestablish control quickly, a lockdown is required. We show
that a lockdown is either effective within a few weeks, or tends to fail its aim. If effective,
recurring lockdowns are not necessary — contrary to the oscillating dynamics previously
presented in the context of circuit breakers 4;5;6 , and contrary to a regime with high case
numbers — if moderate contact reductions are maintained. Hence, at low case numbers,
the control is easier, and more freedom can be granted. We demonstrate that this strategy
reduces case numbers and fatalities by a factor of 5 compared to a strategy focused only
on avoiding major congestion of hospitals. Furthermore, our solution minimises lockdown
duration, and hence economic impact. In the long term, control will successively become
easier due to immunity through vaccination or large scale testing programmes. International
coordination would facilitate even more the implementation of this solution.
As SARS-CoV-2 is becoming endemic and knowledge about its spreading is accumulated, it becomes clear
that neither global eradication nor herd immunity will be achieved soon. Eradication is hindered by the
world-wide prevalence and by asymptomatic spreading. Reaching herd immunity without an effective vaccine
or medication would take several years and cost countless deaths, especially among the elderly 1;7 . Moreover,
evidence for long-term effects (“long COVID") is surfacing 8;9;10;11;12 . Hence, we need long-term, sustainable
strategies to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2. The common goal, especially in countries with an ageing
population, should be to minimise the number of infections and, thereby, allow reliable planning for individuals
and the economy – while not constraining individuals’ number of contacts too much. Intuitively, a regime
with low case numbers would benefit not only public health and psychological well-being but would also
profit the economy 13;14 .
However, control of SARS-CoV-2 is challenging. Many infections originate from asymptomatic or presymptomatic cases 15 or indirectly through surfaces and aerosols 16 , rendering mitigation measures difficult.
Within test-trace-and-isolate (TTI) strategies, the contribution of purely symptom-driven testing is limited,
but together with contact tracing, it can uncover asymptomatic chains of infections. Additional challenges are

the potential influx of SARS-CoV-2 infections (brought in by travellers or commuting workers from abroad),
imperfect quarantine, limited compliance, and delays in TTI and case-reporting. Lastly, any countries
capacity to perform TTI is limited, so that spreading dynamics change depending on the level of case numbers.
Understanding these dynamics is crucial for informed policy decisions.

Analytical framework: Overview
We analytically show the existence of a stable regime at low case numbers, where control of SARS-CoV-2 is
much easier to achieve and sustain. In addition, we investigate mitigation strategies and long term control
for COVID-19, where we build on our past work to understand the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical
interventions, particularly test-trace-and-isolate (TTI) strategies 3;17;18 . For quantitative assessments, we
adapt an SEIR-type compartmental model 19 to explicitly include a realistic TTI system that considers the
challenges above.
A central parameter for our analysis is the effective reduction of contagious contacts kt (relative to preCOVID-19). More precisely, kt does not simply refer to the reduction of contacts a person has, but rather to
the encounters that bear a potential for transmission. Apart from direct contact reduction, contributions to
kt also come from improved hygiene, mandatory face-mask policies, frequent ventilation of closed spaces, and
avoiding indoor gatherings, among other precautionary measures. As the latter measures are relatively fixed,
direct contact reduction remains the central free variable, which is also the one tuned during lockdowns. All
other parameters (and their references) are listed in Table S1.

Equilibrium at low case numbers

Figure 1: Spreading dynamics depend not only on the balance between destabilising and stabilising
contributions, but also on the level of case numbers itself. a: Among the factors that destabilise the spread,
we find the basic reproduction number R0 and the external influx of infections (and possibly seasonality). On the
other hand, various contributions can stabilise it, including increased hygiene, test-trace-isolate (TTI) strategies,
contact reduction, but also immunity. We specifically investigated how contact reduction kt and limited TTI capacity
determine the stabilisation of case numbers. b: Assuming only mild contact reduction (kt = 20 % compared to
pre-COVID-19 times), TTI is not sufficient to prevent increasing case numbers — even when TTI capacity is still
available; case numbers are increasing. c: At moderate contact reduction (kt = 40 %), a metastable equilibrium
emerges (grey dots) to which case numbers converge — if case numbers do not exceed the TTI capacity. However,
destabilizing events (as, e.g., a sudden influx of infections), can push a previously stable system above the TTI capacity
and lead to an uncontrolled spread (black line as an example). d: Assuming heavy contact reduction (kt = 60 %),
case numbers decrease even if the TTI capacity is exceeded.

Low case numbers enable long-term stable pandemic control without lockdowns

Between the scenarios of eradication of the disease or uncontrolled spreading, we find a regime where the
spread reaches an equilibrium at low daily case numbers. The main control parameter that determines
whether the system can reach an equilibrium is the contact reduction kt .
If the contact reduction kt is mild, case numbers grow exponentially, as measures could not counterbalance the
basic reproduction number (R0 ≈ 3.3 for SARS-CoV-2 20;21;22 ) (Fig. 1b). In contrast, if the contact reduction
is strong and (together with hygiene and TTI) outweighs the drive by the basic reproduction number, case
numbers decrease to a low equilibrium value (Fig. 1d).
Importantly, if the contact reduction is moderate (and just-about balances the drive by the basic reproduction
number), we find a metastable regime: The spread is stabilised if and only if the overall case numbers are
sufficiently low to enable fast and efficient TTI (Fig. 1c). However, this control is lost if the limited TTI
capacity is overwhelmed. Beyond that tipping point, the number of cases starts to grow exponentially as
increasingly more infectious individuals remain undetected 3 .
The capacity of TTI determines the minimal required contact reduction for controlling case numbers around
an equilibrium. If case numbers are sufficiently below the TTI capacity limit, the required contact reduction
to maintain the (meta-)stable regime is only ktcrit = 39 % (95% confidence interval (CI):[24, 53]). However, if
case numbers exceed the TTI capacity limit, a considerably stronger contact reduction of ktcrit = 58 % (95%
CI: [53, 62]) is required to reach the stable regime (Fig. 2 b, Fig. S4 and Table S3).

Equilibrium depends on influx and contact reduction

Figure 2: (a, b) In the stable and metastable regimes, daily new cases approach an equilibrium value

N̂∞ increases with weaker contact reduction kt or higher influx Φt . No equilibrium is reached, if either kt or Φt are
above the respective (critical) threshold values. b: The critical value ktcrit represents the minimal contact reduction
that is required to reach equilibrium and stabilise case numbers. If case numbers are below the TTI capacity limit,
lower values of ktcrit are required for stabilisation (blue) than if cases exceed TTI (grey). Confidence intervals originate
from error propagation of the uncertainty of the underlying model parameters. (c–f) In the unstable dynamic
regime (kt = 20%), a tipping point is visible when exceeding TTI capacity. We observe a self-accelerating
increase of case numbers after crossing the TTI limit (c) and a subsequent increase of the reproduction number (d).
Furthermore, the absolute number (e) and the proportion — “dark figure” (f ) — of cases that remain unnoticed
increase over time.

Robust control of the pandemic requires maintaining a sufficient safety-margin from the tipping point (and
the subsequent transition to instability) for two reasons. First, small fluctuations in kt , Φt (or other model
variables) could easily destabilise the system. Second, near the critical value ktcrit , reductions in kt are
especially effective: already small further reductions below ktcrit lead to significantly lower stable case numbers
(Fig. 2a). Already with moderate contact reduction (40 % < kt < 50 %), the spread can be stabilised to a
regime of case numbers clearly below 10 per million (Fig. S1 b, lower right region).

Limited TTI and self-acceleration
If mitigation measures are insufficient, case numbers rise and eventually surpass the TTI capacity limit.
Beyond it, health authorities are not able to efficiently trace contacts and uncover infection chains, thus the
control of the spread becomes more difficult. We start our scenario with a slight increase in case numbers
over a few months, as seen in many European countries throughout the summer 2020 (Fig. S5 and Fig. S6).
A tipping point is then visible in the following observables (Fig. 2 c–f):
First, when case numbers surpass the TTI capacity, the increase in daily new observed cases N̂ obs becomes
steeper, growing even faster than the previous exponential growth (Fig. 2 c, full versus faint line). The
spread self-accelerates because increasingly more contacts are missed, which, in turn, infect more people.
Importantly, in this scenario the accelerated spread arises solely because of exceeding the TTI limit — without
any underlying behaviour change among the population.
Second, after case numbers surpass the TTI limit, the observed reproduction number R̂tobs , which had been
only slightly above the critical value of unity, increases significantly by about 20 % (Fig. 2 d). This reflects a
gradual loss of control over the spread and explains the faster-than-exponential growth of case numbers. The
initial dip in R̂tobs is a side-effect of the limited testing: As increasingly many cases are missed, the observed
reproduction number reduces transiently.
Third, compared to the infectious individuals who are quarantined I Q , the number of infectious individuals
who are hidden I H (i.e. those who are not isolated or in quarantine) increases disproportionately (Fig. 2 e)
which is measured by the “dark figure” (I H /I Q ) (Fig. 2 f). The hidden infectious individuals are the silent
drivers of the spread as they, unaware of being infectious, inadvertently transmit the virus. This implies
a considerable risk, especially for vulnerable people. At low case numbers, the TTI system is capable to
compensate the hidden spread, because it uncovers hidden cases through contact tracing. However, at high
case numbers, the TTI becomes inefficient: If the TTI measures are “slower than the viral spread”, many
contacts cannot be quarantined before they become spreaders.

Re-establishing control with lockdowns
Once the number of new infections has overwhelmed the TTI system, re-establishing control can be challenging.
A recent suggestion is the application of a circuit breaker 4;5;6 , a short lockdown to significantly lower the
number of daily new infections. Already during the first wave, lockdowns have proven capable to lower case
numbers by a factor 2 or more every week (corresponding to an observed reproduction number of R̂tobs ≈ 0.7).
With the knowledge we now have acquired about the spreading of SARS-CoV-2, more targeted restrictions
may yield a similarly strong effect.
Inspired by the lockdowns installed in many countries 25 , we assume a default lockdown of four weeks, starting
four weeks after case numbers exceed the TTI capacity limit, and a strong reduction of contagious contacts
of kLD = 75 % (which corresponds to an R̂teff ≈ 0.85, see Table S4). We further assume that during lockdown
the external influx of infections Φt is reduced by a factor ten, and that after the lockdown, a moderate contact
reduction (knLD = 40 %) is maintained. By varying the parameters of this default lockdown, we show in the
following that the lockdown strength, duration, and starting time determine whether the lockdown succeeds
or fails to reach equilibrium.
In our scenario, a lockdown duration of four weeks is sufficient to reach the stable regime (Fig. 3 a). However,
if lifted too early (before completing four weeks), then case numbers will rise again shortly after. The shorter
an insufficient lockdown, the faster case numbers will rise again. Also, it is advantageous to remain in

Figure 3: The effectiveness of a lockdown depends on three main parameters: its duration, stringency
(strength), and starting time. (a–c) Observed daily new cases for a lockdown (abbreviated as LD) which is
enacted after the TTI capacity has been exceeded. Reference parameters are a lockdown duration of 4 weeks, contact
reduction during lockdown of kLD = 75 % and a start time at 4 weeks after exceeding TTI capacity. We vary lockdown
duration (a), lockdown strength (b) and lockdown starting time (c) to investigate whether stable case numbers
can be reached. (d–f ) Total cases after three months, if the lockdown is parameterised as described in panels a–c,
respectively. (g, h:) The minimal required duration of lockdown to reach equilibrium depends both on strength and

lower left, dark region). Whereas with mild contact reduction and very late start times, lockdowns become ineffective
even when they last indefinitely (Upper left, bright region). h: Horizontal slices through the colour-map (g). Here,
colours match panels (c,f ) and correspond to the lockdown start time.

lockdown for a short time even after case number have fallen below the TTI limit — in order to establish
a safety-margin, as shown above. Overall, the major challenge is not to ease the lockdown too early, as
otherwise the earlier success is soon squandered.
During lockdown, it is necessary to reduce contagious contacts kt severely in order to decrease case numbers
below the TTI capacity limit (Fig. 3 b). In our scenario, the contacts have to be reduced by at least
kLD = 75 % to bring the system back to equilibrium. A lockdown that is only slightly weaker cannot reverse
the spread to a decline of cases. Furthermore, increasing the lockdown strength decreases both the required
lockdown duration (Fig. 3 g,h) and the total number of cases accumulated over three months (Fig. 3 e). This
shows that stricter lockdowns imply shorter-lasting social and economical restrictions.
The earlier a lockdown begins after exceeding the TTI capacity limit, the faster control can be re-established
and constraints can be loosened again (Fig. 3 c). If started right after crossing the threshold, in principle,
only a few days of lockdown are necessary to bring back case numbers below TTI capacity limit. On the
other hand, if the lockdown is started weeks later, its duration needs to increase (Fig. 3 c,d) and the total
number of cases will be significantly larger (Fig. 3 f).
In conclusion, to re-establish control, a lockdown needs to be strong enough to reach equilibrium within a few
weeks, or it fails almost completely.
The parameter regime between these two options is quite narrow; it is not likely that equilibrium can
eventually be reached as a lockdown exceeds many weeks (cf. Fig. 3 h). For practical policies, this means
5

Low case numbers enable long-term stable pandemic control without lockdowns

that if a lockdown does not start to show clear effects after 2 or 3 weeks, then the strategy should be revised
(this assessment time is necessary due to the delay of 1-2 weeks between contagion and case-report).

Maintaining control without lockdowns
We show that repeated lockdowns are not required to maintain control over the COVID-19 spread if moderate
contact reduction is maintained once case numbers are below the TTI capacity limit (an initial lockdown
might still be necessary to establish control). A natural goal would be to keep case numbers below the
hospital capacity. However, our model suggests that lowering them below TTI capacity requires less contact
restrictions (in the long-term), involves a shorter total lockdown duration, and costs less lives. In the following
we compare the long-term perspective of these two goals and their dependence on the necessary contact
reduction.

Figure 4: On a long-term perspective, recurrent lockdowns are not required if the subsequent contact
reduction knLD is sufficient to reach equilibrium. A two-week lockdown of default strength (kLD = 75 %)
is either enacted when the test-trace-and-isolate (TTI, yellow lines) or the hospital (red lines) capacity limits are
crossed. a: Given only a mild contact reduction while not in lockdown knLD = 20 %, the imposed lockdowns need to
reoccur with a high frequency. Moreover, the frequency at which they reoccur is higher at high case numbers (aiming
at hospital capacity) than when aiming at the TTI capacity limit because of the self-accelerating effect described
previously. b: If the contact reduction remains moderate knLD = 40 %, lockdowns only need to reoccur if they fail
to bring case numbers below TTI capacity. c, d: The total cost (in terms of cumulative cases and total lockdown
duration) depends on the level of contact reduction and the lockdown policy: The cost is low if lockdowns are initiated
at the TTI capacity limit and if knLD is high. e, f: In the future, the minimal contact reduction required for stability
ktcrit may be lowered by the implementation of large-scale random testing (e) or by immunisation of the population
(f ).

In our scenario (Fig. 4), we start from the unstable regime, where the initial contact reduction kt = 20 % is not
sufficient to control the spread. We start a two-week lockdown when crossing either the TTI or the hospital
capacity. During the lockdown, contacts are reduced by kLD = 75 %. After the first and all subsequent
lockdowns, contacts knLD are reduced by 20 % or 40 % relative to pre-COVID-19 levels, representing mild
or moderate reduction. When assuming mild contact reduction after lockdowns, case numbers rise after
lifting the lockdown, independent of the chosen threshold (TTI or hospital capacity, Fig. 4 a). Thus, repeated
lockdowns are necessary.
However, maintaining a moderate contact reduction while not in lockdown (knLD = 40 %) is sufficient to
stay within the metastable regime — if lockdowns are enacted such that case numbers stay below the TTI
capacity (Fig. 4 b, yellow line). This is a promising perspective for a long-term control strategy that avoids
recurrent lockdowns. Otherwise, if case numbers are above TTI capacity limit but below hospital capacity, a
control of the pandemic requires repeated lockdowns (Fig. 4 b, red line) or stronger contact reductions.
The advantage of the strategy to stay below the TTI capacity limit becomes very clear when considering the
total cost of the required lockdowns: Independently of the level of contact reduction, (i) the total number
of cases (and consequently deaths and “long-COVID” risk) is lower (Fig. 4 c), (ii) the total duration spent
in lockdown is shorter (Fig. 4 d), and (iii) the frequency at which lockdowns have to reoccur – should the
6

Low case numbers enable long-term stable pandemic control without lockdowns

after-lockdown contact reduction not be enough to grant metastability – is lower (Fig. 4 a). As case numbers
and lockdown duration indicate economic costs, a strategy that respects the TTI limit offers a low economic
toll, enables mid-term planning and provides trust to people and society.
In the future, large-scale testing 26;27;28 and immunisation (either through vaccination or lasting post-infection
immunity) will play a role for long-term strategies. Both will reduce the necessary reduction of contacts to
maintain control (Fig. 4 e, f). Early effects of immunity can be seen in our scenario of the system that is
stabilised at hospital capacity: The need for lockdowns becomes less frequent over time (Fig. 4 a, b). However,
acquiring natural immunity comes at the cost of a prolonged high level of case numbers, subsequent “long
COVID” cases 9;10;11;12 and deceased people. Whereas, the duration of the immunity is not known yet 29 , this
phenomenon still shows that immunity effects play an increasing role as model predictions extend further
into the future.

Discussion
We demonstrated that between the two extremes of eradication and uncontrolled spread, a metastable regime
of SARS-CoV2 spreading exist. In such a regime, every person only has to reduce their contacts moderately,
while case numbers can still be maintained robustly at low levels, because the test-trace-and-isolate (TTI)
system can operate efficiently. If this regime is within reach, keeping case numbers below TTI capacity is a
suitable strategy for the control of COVID-19 that features low fatalities and a small societal burden.
Among countries around the world, the wide range and great variability in the levels of case numbers illustrate
that governmental policies and the chosen strategy to face COVID-19 have great impact (see Supplementary
Notes 2.1). Sustained high levels of more than 100 daily new cases per million have been observed in several
(but not exclusively) American countries (Supp. Fig. S3 a). This shows that high levels of daily new infections
can be maintained. However, the stringency of interventions is similar to other countries 30 , and the prospect
of reaching herd immunity is still far away. On the other hand, very low case numbers and even local
eradication have been achieved by several South- and East-Asian countries, Australia and New-Zealand.
At the time of writing, these countries profit from the absorbing state at zero SARS-CoV-2 infections, but
maintaining this state requires strong international travel restrictions (Supp. Fig. S3 c). An intermediate
level of case numbers could predominantly be observed over the summer 2020 in Europe. Case numbers for
many countries were typically around 10 daily new cases per million (Supp. Fig. S3 b), even though contacts
were only mildly restricted. These stable numbers demonstrate that also in practice a regime below TTI
capacity limits is maintainable. Nonetheless, in September the spread significantly accelerated in a number
of European countries, when case numbers began to exceed 20 to 50 daily new cases per million (Fig. S6).
Beyond these levels of case numbers, the TTI systems began to be overwhelmed, making a control difficult —
in line with the results of our model.
In order to focus our model on the general spreading dynamics, we made simplifying assumptions: We
assumed that spreading happens homogeneously in the population, with neither regional nor age-related
differences. In reality, heterogeneous spreading can lead to regionally differing case numbers, which illustrates
the need for regional monitoring of the remaining TTI capacity to allow for early and targeted control
measures. In our scenarios, we further assumed that the behaviour of the population and subsequent contact
reduction is constant over time (except during lockdown). Real situations are more dynamic, necessitating
frequent reevaluations of the current restrictions and mitigation measures. We also assumed a constant
effectiveness of TTI if below the capacity limit, but if case numbers are very low, all the available test- and
trace-efforts could be concentrated on the remaining infection chains. This would further facilitate a control
at low case numbers. Overall, our analytical results describe the general behaviour across countries well and
identify the relevant factors for the control of the pandemic.
Quantitatively, our assumptions regarding the efficiency of TTI are in agreement with those of other modelling
studies. Agent-based models with detailed contact structures 31;32 and mean-field models 33;34;35;36 both
agree that TTI measures are an important contribution for the control of the pandemic but typically do not
suffice alone. Their success strongly depends on their implementation: Fast testing, rigorous isolation, and a
large proportion of traced contacts are essential. Given our informed assumptions about these parameters,
our model shows that TTI can only compensate a basic reproduction number R0 of 3.3 — if contagious
contacts are also reduced by about 40 % (95% CI: [24,53]). This is in agreement with the results of other
studies 37;34;38;31;32 .
The capacity limit of TTI plays a central role to inform policymakers when to issue preventive measures. The
precise limit of TTI depends on a number of factors, including the number of available tests, personnel at
7

Low case numbers enable long-term stable pandemic control without lockdowns

the tracing units, potentially a tracing app 34 , and the number of relevant contacts a person has on average.
Already the latter can easily differ by a factor 10, depending on contact restrictions and cultural factors 39 .
For our scenarios, we assumed the capacity is reached at about 100 daily new cases per million, which is
comparably high. Independent of the exact value, when this limit is approached, the risk of tipping over to
uncontrolled spread strongly increases, and countermeasures should be taken without delay. Otherwise, the
spread might self-accelerate and get out of control.
Our results show that a stable equilibrium at low case numbers can be maintained with a moderate contact
reduction of about 40 % less contagious contacts compared to pre-COVID-19. This level of contact reduction
can be achieved with preventive mitigation measures, as shown by studies analysing the effectiveness of
non-pharmaceutical interventions during the first wave 40;41;18;25 . Restrictions on the maximum size of
gatherings already lead to an effective reduction in the range of 10–40 % 40;25;18 . Improved hygiene, frequent
ventilation of rooms, and the compulsory use of masks can further reduce the number of infectious contacts
(by a factor that is more difficult to estimate 42;43 ). In conclusion, until a vaccination or better treatment is
developed, the regime of low case numbers is very promising for a mid- and long-term management of the
pandemic, as it poses the least burden on economy and society.
On the other hand, stabilising the spread at higher levels of case numbers (e.g. at the hospital capacity limit)
requires more stringent and more frequent non-pharmaceutical interventions, because the TTI system cannot
operate efficiently. Examples of more stringent measures are the closure of schools and public businesses,
stay-at-home orders, and contact ban policies 40;41;18 .
Concluding, the recommendation from this paper is to reach and maintain low case numbers that allow an
efficient operation of TTI measures. To this end, it is mandatory to counteract local super-spreading events
(or an acute influx of infections) as early as possible and to sustain a sufficient level of mitigation measures.
If low case numbers are reached and maintained throughout Europe, or even internationally, then travel and
commute could take place almost unrestricted; every country would profit from the stability of its neighbours.

Methods

Model overview. We model the spreading dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 as the sum of contributions from two
pools of infectious individuals, i.e. quarantined-isolated I Q and hidden non-isolated I H individuals, while
also modelling the infectivity timeline through the incorporation of compartments for individuals exposed
to the virus (E Q , E H ), following an SEIR-like formalism. The quarantined infectious pool (I Q ) contains
cases revealed through testing or by contact tracing and subsequently sent to quarantine-isolation to avoid
further contacts as well as possible. In contrast, in the hidden infectious pool (I H ), infections spread silently
and only become detectable when individuals develop symptoms and get tested, via random testing in the
population or as part of the chain of contacts of recently identified individuals. This second pool (I H ) is
called the hidden pool; individuals in this pool are assumed to exhibit the general population’s behaviour,
thus of everyone who is not aware of being infected. Healthy individuals that can be infected belong to the
susceptible pool S, while we assume that, after they recover and for the relatively short time-frame here
studied, they remain immunised in the R compartment. For a graphical representation of the model, the
reader is referred to Supplementary Fig. S2. We model the mean-field interactions between compartments
by transition rates, determining the timescales involved. These transition rates can implicitly incorporate
both the time course of the disease and the delays inherent to the TTI process. Individuals exposed to the
virus become infectious after the latent period, modelled by the We distinguish between symptomatic and
asymptomatic carriers – this is central when exploring different testing strategies (as detailed below). We also
include the effects of non-compliance, modelled as a higher asymptomatic ratio, and imperfect contact tracing,
including an explicit delay between testing and tracing of contacts. In the different scenarios analysed, we
include a non-zero influx Φt of new cases that acquired the virus from outside. Even though this influx
makes a complete eradication of SARS-CoV-2 impossible, different outcomes in the spreading dynamics might
arise depending on both contact intensity and TTI. We then investigate the system’s stability and dynamics,
aiming to control the spread with a low total number of cases without necessitating a too large reduction of
infectious contacts.

S1.1

Spreading Dynamics

Concretely, we use a modified SEIR-type model, where infected individuals can be either symptomatic or
asymptomatic. They belong to hidden (E H , I H ) or a quarantined (E Q , I Q ) pools of infections, thus creating
in total one compartment of susceptible (S), two compartments of exposed individuals (E H , E Q ), four
compartments of infectious individuals (I H,s , I H,a , I Q,s , I Q,a ), and one compartment for recovered/removed
individuals (R).
New infections are asymptomatic with a ratio ξ, the others are symptomatic. In all compartments individuals
are removed with a rate γ because of recovery or death ( Supplementary Table S1 for all parameters).
In the hidden pools, the disease spreads according to the contact patterns of the population, which can be
expressed as a fraction kt of the intensity they had before COVID-19 related contact-restrictions. Defining R0
as the base reproduction number without contact restrictions, the reproduction number of the hidden pool
I H is given by (1 − kt ) R0 . This reproduction number reflects the disease spread in the general population,
without testing induced isolation of individuals. Additionally, the hidden pool receives a mobility-induced
influx Φt of new infections. Cases are removed from the hidden pool (i) when detected by TTI and put into
the quarantined pool I Q , or (ii) due to recovery or death.
The quarantined exposed and infectious pools (E Q , I Q ) contain those infected individuals who have been
tested positive as well as their positively tested contacts. Infectious individuals in I Q are (imperfectly) isolated,
we assume their contacts have been reduced to a fraction (ν + ) of the ones they had in pre-COVID-19
times, of which only ν are captured by the tracing efforts of the health authorities, and the subsequent
infections remain quarantined, thus entering the E Q pool and afterwards the I Q pool. The remaining fraction
of produced infections, , are missed and act as an influx to the hidden pools (E H ). Therefore, the overall
reproduction number in the I Q pool is (ν + ) R0 .
As our model is an expanded SEIR-model, it assumes post-infection immunity, which is a realistic assumption
given the limited time-frame considered in our analysis. Our model can also reflect innate immunity; one
then has to rescale the population or the reproduction number. The qualitative behaviour of the dynamics is
not expected to change.

S1.2

Parameter Choices and Scenarios

For any testing strategy, the fraction of infections that do not develop any symptoms across the whole
infection timeline is an important parameter, and this also holds for testing strategies applied to the case of
SARS-CoV-2. In our model this parameter is called ξ ap and includes beside true asymptomatic infections ξ
also the effect of individuals that avoid testing 45 . The exact value of the fraction of asymptomatic infections
ξ, however, is still fraught with uncertainty, and it also depends on age 46;47;48 . While early estimates were as
high as 50 % (for example ranging from 26 % to 63 % 49 ), these early estimates suffered from reporting bias,
small sample sizes and sometimes included pre-symptomatic cases as well 50;51 . Recent studies estimate the
asymptomatic transmission to be more minor 52 , estimates of the fraction of asymptomatic carriers range
between 12 % 50 and 33 % 53 .
Another crucial parameter for any TTI strategy is the reproduction number of the hidden infections. This
parameter is by definition impossible to measure, but it is typically the main driver of the spreading dynamics.
It depends mainly on the contact behaviour of the population, and ranges from R0 in the absence of contact
restrictions to values below 1 during strict lockdown 18 . Herein we decided to include instead the reduction
of contacts with respect to the pre-COVID-19 base-line kt to represent the reproduction number of hidden
infections (1 − kt ) R0 . For the default parameters of our model, we evaluated different levels of contact
reduction kt .
S1.3

Testing-and-Tracing strategies

We consider a testing-and-tracing strategy: symptom-driven testing and specific testing of traced contacts,
with a subsequent of the cases tested positive. Our model can also include random testing, but this case is
only explored in Figure 4 of this paper.
Symptom-driven testing is defined as applying tests to individuals presenting symptoms of COVID-19.
In this context, it is important to note that non-infected individuals can have symptoms similar to those of
COVID-19, as many symptoms are rather unspecific. Although symptom-driven testing suffers less from
imperfect specificity, it can only uncover symptomatic cases that are willing to be tested (see below). Here,
symptomatic, infectious individuals are transferred from the hidden to the traced pool at rate λs .
We define λs as the daily rate at which symptomatic individuals get tested, among the subset who are willing
to get tested, because of surveillance programs or self-report. As default value we use λs = 0.25, which means
that, on average, an individual willing to get tested that develops COVID-19-specific symptoms would get a
test within 4 days from the end of the latency period. Testing and isolation happens immediately in this
model, but their report into the observed new daily cases N̂ obs is delayed, and so is the tracing of their
contacts.
Tracing contacts of positively tested infectious individuals presents a very specific test strategy, and is
expected to be effective in breaking the infection chains, if contacts self-isolate sufficiently quickly 31;54;55 .
However as every implementation of a TTI strategy is bound to be imperfect, we assume that only a fraction
η < 1 of all contacts can be traced. These contacts, if tested positive, are then transferred from the hidden to
the quarantined infectious pools (I H → I Q ) with an average delay of τ = 2 days. The parameter η effectively
represents the fraction of secondary and tertiary infections that are found through contact-tracing. As this
fraction decreases when the delay between testing and contact-tracing increases we assumed a default value
of η = 0.66, i.e. on average only two thirds of subsequent offspring infections are prevented. Contact tracing
test
is mainly done by the health authorities in Germany, and this clearly limits the maximum number Nmax
of
new cases observed through testing N test , for which contact tracing is still functional.
Random testing is defined here as applying tests to individuals irrespective of their symptom status, or
whether they belonging to the contact-chain of other infected individuals. In our model, random testing
transfers infected individuals from the hidden to the quarantined infectious pools with fixed rate λr , irrespective
of them showing symptoms or not. In reality, random testing is often implemented as situation-based testing
for a sub-group of the population, e.g. at a hot-spot, for groups at risk, or for people returning from travel.
Such situation-based strategies would be more efficient than the random testing assumed in this model, which
may be unfeasible in a country level due to testing limitations 3 .
S1.4

Lockdown modelling

To assess the effectiveness of lockdowns in the broad spectrum of contact-ban governmental interventions, we
model how the reduction of contacts and the duration of such restrictive regimes help lower case numbers.
13

Low case numbers enable long-term stable pandemic control without lockdowns

We model contact reductions as reductions in the reproduction number of the hidden population, which for
these matters is presented as percentages of the basic reproduction number R0 , which sets the pre-COVID-19
base-line for the number of close contacts.
For the sake of simplicity, we assume the lockdown scenarios have three stages: i) an uncontrolled regime,
where the TTI capacity is overwhelmed because of high case numbers and unsustainable contact intensity,
reflected by a high value of kt = k0 and high influx of infections Φt . ii) Strong reduction of contacts k0 → kLD
and borders closing Φt → ΦLD . iii) Relaxation of measures to a new level, where the system should be
again stable, within the TTI-based stability kLD → knLD , and borders would be open ΦLD → ΦnLD . All the
changes between the different regimes i→ii→iii are modelled as linear ramps for both parameters, which
take Dramp = 7 days to reach their set-point. The duration of the lockdown DL , namely, the time-frame
between the start of the restrictive measures and the beginning of their relaxation, is measured in weeks, and
its default length – for analysis purposes – is four weeks.
S1.5

Model Equations

The contributions of the spreading dynamics and the TTI strategies are summarised in the equations below.
They govern the dynamics of case numbers between the different susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered
(SEIR) pools, both hidden (non-isolated) and quarantined. We assume a regime where most of the population
is susceptible, and the time-frame analysed is short enough to assume post-infection immunity. Thus, the
dynamics are completely determined by the spread (characterised by the reproduction numbers (1 − kt ) R0
and (ν + ) R0 ), transition from exposed to infectious (at rate ρ), recovery (characterised by the recovery
rate γ), external influx Φt and the impact of the TTI strategies:

We assume a population size of M = 106 individuals, so that i6=6 xi = M , and a prevalence of I0 = 200
infections per million, so that I Q (0) = I0 . Assuming that the hidden amount of infections is in the same order
of magnitude I0 , we would have I H (0) = I0 , I H,s (0) = (1 − ξ)I0 . We would expect the exposed individuals
to scale with (1 − kt ) R0 I0 , but we rather assume them to have the same size
P of the corresponding infectious
pool. To calculate the initially susceptible individuals, we use S(0) = 1 − i6={1,6} xi .
S1.7

Effect of delays and capacity limit on the effectiveness of TTI strategies

In this section we discuss further details on the derivation of the different parameters and variables involved
in equations (1)–(8). First, as we assume contact tracing to be effective after a delay of τ days, some of the
individuals who acquired the infection from those recently tested might have also become infectious by the
time of tracing. Moreover, a fraction of those who became infectious might also have been tested by the
tracing time, should they have developed symptoms.
Furthermore, we give explicit forms for N test and N traced the number of cases identified respectively by
testing and contact-tracing. When surpassing TTI capacity we assume that both testing and contact-tracing
change their dynamics simultaneously. This happens when the daily amount of cases identified by testing
test
N test overpasses the TTI threshold Nmax
. After being overwhelmed, the overhead testing would change
0
its rate λs → λs , as only patients with a more specific set of symptoms would be tested. Nonetheless, the
test
contact-tracing efforts can only follow the contacts of those Nmax
observed cases, identifying a fraction η of
the offspring infections they produced in their infectious period spent in unawareness of their state. The case
of random testing is analysed in the Supplementary Section 1.
S1.7.1

Limited testing capacity leading to lower testing rates

In the first stages of an outbreak, individuals with any symptoms from the broad spectrum of COVID-19related symptoms would be tested, disregarding how specific those symptoms are. At this stage, we assume
that the rate at which symptomatic individuals are tested is λs , such that the number of individuals identified
through testing (which, for simplicity is assumed to be solely symptom-driven) is given by
Nstest = λs I H,s .

(10)

test
When reaching the daily number Nmax
of positive tests the testing capacity is reached. We then assume that
further tests are only carried out for a more specific set of symptoms, leading to a smaller fraction of the
population being tested. We therefore implement the testing capacity as a soft threshold. Assuming that
test
after reaching Nmax
, the testing rate for further cases would decrease to λ0s , the testing term N test would be
given by

Modelling the number of traced individuals

To calculate the number of traced individuals, we assume that a fraction η of the newly tested individuals’
contacts, and therefore their offspring infections, will be traced and subsequently quarantined. However these
tested individuals stay on average a shorter amount of time in the infectious pool than the untested ones
because they are quarantined, thus removed earlier from the pool. The number of offspring infections has
therefore to be corrected by a factor, the average residence time in the infectious pool. For the case λr = 0,
1
the average residence time is γ+λ
, whereas the average residence time of untested individuals is γ1 . Dividing
s
these two times gives us the wanted correction factor. The number of traced persons N traced at time t is
therefore:

N traced (t) = ηRt−τ

(12)

Low case numbers enable long-term stable pandemic control without lockdowns

Otherwise, when the TTI capacity is overwhelmed, we assume that the number of traced individuals is
test
limited, that only the contacts of Nmax
individuals (already introduced in the previous section) can be traced:
H
N traced (t) = ηRt−τ

Individuals becoming infectious or being tested by the time of tracing

The traced individuals are removed from either the exposed hidden pool E H or from the infectious hidden
pool I H after a delay of τ days after testing. As we assume a tracing delay τ of only 2 days, a majority of
the traced individuals are still be in exposed compartment. However, some might already become infectious
by that time. To calculate the exact fraction of individuals remaining in the hidden exposed pool by the time
of tracing, we proceed as follows. Let s ∈ Iτ = [0, τ ] be the time elapsed from the moment of testing. The

individuals remaining in the E compartment at s = τ :
χτ = exp (−ρτ ) .

(15)

The remaining individuals are removed from the infectious compartment, which are then simply described by
the fraction
χr = 1 − χτ .
(16)
This however only holds for the asymptomatic hidden infectious pool. For the symptomatic hidden pool I H,s ,
we do not want to remove the individuals which have already been tested, as they would be removed twice.
For modelling the fraction of non-tested individuals remaining in the normalised symptomatic infectious
H,s ), we couple two first-order kinetics:

Central epidemiological parameters that can be observed

In the real world, the disease spread can only be observed through testing and tracing. While the true number
of daily infections N is a sum of all new infections in the hidden and traced pools, the observed number of
daily infections N̂ obs is the number of new infections discovered by testing, tracing, and surveillance of the
contacts of those individuals in the quarantined infectious pool I Q , delayed by a variable reporting time.

where ~ denotes a convolution and K an empirical probability mass function that models a variable reporting
delay, inferred from German data (as the RKI reports the date the test is performed, the delay until the
appearance in the database can be inferred): The total delay between testing and reporting a test corresponds
to one day more than the expected time the laboratory takes for obtaining results, which is defined as
follows: from testing, 50 % of the samples would be reported the next day, 30 % the second day, 10 % the
third day, and further delays complete the remaining 10 %, which for simplicity we will truncate at day
four. Considering the extra day needed for reporting, the probability mass function for days 0 to 5 would
be given by K = [0, 0, 0.5, 0.3, 0.1, 0.1]. The spreading dynamics are usually characterized by the observed
reproduction number R̂tobs , which is calculated from the observed number of new cases N̂ obs (t). We here
use the definition underlying the estimates that are published by Robert-Koch-Institute, the official body
responsible for epidemiological control in Germany 56 : the reproduction number is the relative change of daily
new cases N separated by 4 days (the assumed serial interval of COVID-19 57 ):
R̂tobs =

N̂ obs (t)
N̂ obs (t − 4)

(21)

In contrast to the original definition of R̂tobs 56 , we do not need to remove real-world noise effects by smoothing
this ratio.
S1.9

Numerical calculation of solutions and critical values.

The numerical solution of the delay differential equations governing our model were obtained using a versatile
solver that tracks discontinuities and integrates with the explicit Runge-Kutta (2,3) pair, @dde23 implemented
in MATLAB (version 2020a), with default settings. This algorithm allows the solution of non-stiff systems of
differential equations in the shape y 0 (t) = f (t, y(t), y(t − τ1 ), ..., y(t − τk ), for a set of discrete lags {τi }ki=1 .
Suitability and details on the algorithm are further discussed in 58 .
To derive the tipping point between controlled and uncontrolled outbreaks (e.g. critical, minimal required
contact reduction ktcrit for both stability and metastability), and to plot the stability diagrams, we used the
S
@fzero MATLAB function, and the linear approximation of the system of DDE (2)–(6) for the M
≈ 1 limit.
This function uses a combination of bisection, secant, and inverse quadratic interpolation methods to find the
roots of a function. For instance, following the discussion of Supplementary Section 1, The different critical
values for the contact reduction ktcrit were determined by systematically solving the nonlinear eigenvalues
problem for stability 59 , where the solution operation was approximated with a Chebyshev differentiation
matrix 60 .

Supplementary Notes
Strategies to face COVID-19 differ among countries.

Very low case numbers and even local eradication has been achieved by several South- and East-Asian
countries, as well as Australia and New-Zealand. By aiming for local eradication, these countries reached
very low values below one daily new case per million (median 0.5, Fig. S3 C). If local eradication is successful,
these countries can profit from the absorbing state of zero SARS-CoV-2 infections, i.e. after local eradication
new infection chains are only started if a virus is de novo carried into the country 65;66 . However, the local
eradication is constantly put at risk by undetected influx of new viruses from abroad, requiring very strict
quarantine for international travel, and – once the spread got out of control – decisive action to completely
stop all infection chains. However, the more countries adhere to this strategy successfully, the closer one may
get to global eradication.
In many European countries over the summer, case numbers were relatively low, typically around 10 daily
new cases per million (Fig. S3 B). During that time, contacts were in general only mildly or moderately
restricted, and containment was complemented by hygiene, masks, and other preventive measures. However,
in summer and autumn, most European countries developed a second wave Fig. ??. The causes are certainly
diverse, from increasing contact rates to seasonal effects and travel-related influx. Seasonal effects alone
cannot explain the second wave, as neighbouring countries like Portugal versus Spain, or Finland versus

value N̂∞
that depends on contact reduction kt and external influx of new cases Φt . a: The equilibrium
obs
value N̂∞ increases steeply with lower kt and then destabilises when surpassing a critical value ktcrit . Thus, contact
reduction has to be sufficiently strong to keep the case numbers within TTI capacity. A certain degree of external
influx Φt can be compensated, but in general, Φt can put stability at risk. Φt = 1 one daily new case per million
obs
is our default parameter for the influx. b: The N̂∞
is below 10 for a large fraction of parameter combinations, kt
and Φt , thus well below the capacity limit of TTI. c: The critical value ktcrit , which marks the transition between
stable and (meta)stable spread; thus ktcrit displays the minimal contact reduction that is required to control the
spread (and stabilise case numbers). If case numbers are below the TTI capacity limit, a contact reduction of at least
ktcrit = 39 % is required for stabilisation (blue). If case numbers, however, are above the TTI limit, stronger contact
reduction is necessary for stabilisation (ktcrit = 58 %, grey). Confidence intervals originate from error propagation of
the uncertainty of the underlying model parameters. All model parameters are listed in Supplementary Table S3 and
the full uncertainty analysis is in Fig. S4.

Sweden show greatly different dynamics (see 44 ). Hence, it seems to be possible to maintain an equilibrium at
fairly low case numbers, but that equilibrium is fragile at high case numbers and novel waves can emerge at
any time.
Sustained high levels of case numbers have been observed in several countries such that TTI probably couldn’t
be performed effectively. Around 130 daily new cases per million have been observed e.g. in many (but not
all) American countries (median 129.54, Fig. S3 A). It shows that high levels of daily new infections can
be maintained in principle. However the stringency of interventions is similar or higher compared to other
countries (see 30 ), and even with these high numbers it will probably take about 200.000/150 = 1333 to
700.000/150 = 4666 days, thus several years, until 20 to 70 % of the population is infected and herd immunity

reached – assuming the duration of individual immunity is long enough. That high level of new infections
leads to a considerable death toll, as currently about 1.5 % of the infected individuals would die (depending
on age structure 17;67 ). Moreover, containment measures like quarantine become unsustainable because, if
implemented, each one of the 200 daily new infected cases would require the quarantine of 5-50 people (their
high-risk contacts) for about 10 days, causing 1 - 10 % of the population being in quarantine at any given
day. Therefore the alleged economical and social benefits of such a strategy 68;69 may be questionable.

Supplementary Figure S3: Strategies of countries to fight SARS-CoV-2 differ widely and are reflected in
case numbers. (A) Strategies that involve little nonpharmaceutical interventions rely on the population to hinder
the spread in a self-regulated manner and are often accompanied by high case numbers. Examples can be dominantly
found in North- and South-America, the median of daily new cases for the shown examples and time range exceeds 100
per million inhabitants per day. (B) Strategies that aim to keep case numbers low through extensive TTI, combined
with temporary lockdowns can lead to medium case numbers. As the effectiveness of TTI measures depends on daily
infections, case numbers can seemingly explode when the (hard-to-estimate) TTI capacity limit is exceeded. Many
European countries managed to stabilise case numbers over the summer but are now seeing case numbers that rise
faster-than-exponential. The median of daily new cases for the shown examples and time range is 9.88 per million per
day. (C) When the external influx is low and/or employed strategies to reduce contacts are very effective, the stable
regime can be reached. In this case, average case numbers are very low and local outbreaks can be controlled well
through local interventions. Examples can be dominantly found in East-Asia and Oceania. The median of daily new
cases for the shown examples and time range is 0.55 per million per day. Raw data and preliminary visualizations
were obtained from 44 .

We determine the critical values for the contact reduction ktcrit , for which exponential solutions would be
asymptotically stable. Eigenvalues were determined by systematically solving the nonlinear eigenvalues
problem for stability 59 , where the solution operation was approximated with a Chebyshev differentiation
matrix 60 . Eigenvalues, in this sense, would be solutions of the scalar equation

det −sI + A + e−sτ B = 0

(26)

Noting that A and B explicitly depend on the model parameters, we numerically explore which combinations
of them would result in stable, metastable or unstable case numbers. Concretely, we studied the minimum
–critical– contact reduction required for stablilization ktcrit in two scenarios; i) low case numbers, and TTI

fully operative (both testing and contact tracing), and ii) high case numbers, above the TTI limit, where
testing would be inefficient and solely symptom driven (λs = λ0s , η = λr = λ0r = 0).
To explore the uni-variate impact different signature parameters have on ktcrit , we studied the zeros of (26) as
a function of kt using the @fzero MATLAB function (Fig. S4A). Using the same routines and a random
sampling procedure, we propagate uncertainties in the values of these parameters, uni-variate (Fig. S4B), and
multivariate (Fig. S4C).

On the contact reduction required for achieving early herd immunity.

In Supplementary Section S2.2, we derived a methodology for obtaining the minimal, critical contact reduction

The herd immunity threshold % represents the fraction of the population that needs to be immunised for
controlling the spread of an infectious disease. It can be expressed in terms of the effective reproduction

In the context of our model, Rt can be expressed in terms of the reduction of contagious contacts kt and the
basic reproduction number R0 ; Rt = (1 − kt ) R0 . Nonetheless, in further stages of an ongoing outbreak, the
S
fraction of people that is no longer susceptible would have an effect, thus we include also the scaling factor M

assuming a quasi-stationary dynamics for S, and defining f = 1 − M
. Suppose we study the case in which no
major behavioural changes take place, thus the herd immunity threshold % would remain the same. On the
other hand, because of the sole fact of having a progressively increasing immunisation among the population
(because of vaccination or post-infection immunity), the required reduction of contacts for stabilisation ktcrit
will decrease. Assuming critical conditions, we use kt = ktcrit in equation (29):

Inferring the reproduction number of COVID-19 from Jun to Oct. 2020

We use the framework of Bayesian inference on an SIR model presented in our previous work 18 to infer the
daily growth rate λ∗ (t). An SIR compartmental model with weekly change points is used whose central
epidemiological parameters are inferred using the PyMC3 package 70 . A weekly modulation was applied
to take weekly reporting structure and weekend delays into account. After inference a rolling average was
performed on the daily case numbers for comparability and clarity. The effective reproduction number R̂teff
can be expressed dependent on the effective daily growth rate:
R̂teff = (λ∗ (t) + 1)4

(33)

This short analysis was performed for Germany (Fig. S5) and other European countries (Fig. S6) which
showed the same metastable behaviour, while their case numbers were below a threshold around 50 cases per
day (per million). A transition into the unstable regime can be seen once case numbers surpass this threshold.

Supplementary Figure S5: A substantial increase in the effective growth rate in Germany occurred during
the month of October, suggesting that regional TTI capacity limits were exceeded. (A) Before October,
the reproduction number was slightly above one (corresponding to a daily growth rate λ∗ slightly above zero). (B)
Observed case numbers were stabilised below 20 daily new cases per million (but still, slowly growing), until a
transition into the unstable regime took place over ∼ 4 weeks in October. The time range is adjusted to focus on
this tipping point. The inset shows case numbers for the full available time range. (C) Main central epidemiological
parameters with prior and posterior distribution.

On the incorporation of random testing in the TTI scheme

Testing can also be done in a random manner or randomly combined with a tracing strategy. Even though
the amount of tests that would be required for such purposes would be enormous, the development of fast,
cheap, and reliable tests offers an interesting alternative to consider.
In this supplementary note we derive the equations presented in the methods but also including random
testing. As therein described, random testing is assumed to occur at a constant rate λr , which, for default
parameters, reflect the amount of tests per day per million people. In that way, it seems reasonable to
consider unfeasible testing rates surpassing λmax
= 0.1, as it would mean that a 10 % of the population is
r
tested everyday.

Supplementary Figure S6: Comparison of the reproduction number and reported cases as second wave
emerges in different European countries. For each country, parameters of an SIR model were fitted to the
reported data of the Our World in Data repository 44 , following the procedure presented in 18 . (Panels X1) The
time-dependent effective growth rate stays between −0.1 and 0.1 and rises before the tipping point. This corresponds
to an effective reproduction number between 0.7 and 1.3, which matches our preliminary assumptions. The time range
is adjusted to focus on the tipping point. (Panels X2) After a (meta-)stable regime in summer, all of the selected
countries show a rise in case numbers and a tipping point at around 50 new cases per day per million, where the
spread self-accelerates and the cases increase significantly. (Insets) Case numbers for the full available time range.

Random testing: Number of cases observable through contact-tracing N traced

Because of TTI, infectious individuals move (or are likely to move) from the hidden to the quarantined
infectious pool before recovering. Therefore, they spend a comparatively shorter amount of time there and,
on average, would not generate the expected amount of offspring infections as some would be prevented.
Assuming the average residence time of untested individuals is γ1 , we estimate the residence time of individuals
removed by symptom-driven testing and random testing. Noting that symptomatic individuals can be tested
and therefore removed by any of the testing criteria, their residence time would be approximately γ+λ1s +λr ,
1
whereas the average residence time of asymptomatic individuals would be γ+λ
. Therefore, the fractions of
