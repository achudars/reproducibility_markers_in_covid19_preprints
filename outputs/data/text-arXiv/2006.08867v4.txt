Abstract—On 19th March, the World Health Organisation declared a pandemic. Through this global spread, many nations have
witnessed exponential growth of confirmed cases brought under control by severe mass quarantine or lockdown measures. However,
some have, through a different timeline of actions, prevented this exponential growth. Currently as some continue to tackle growth,
others attempt to safely lift restrictions whilst avoiding a resurgence. This study seeks to quantify the impact of government actions in
mitigating viral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by a novel soft computing approach that makes concurrent use of a neural network model,
to predict the daily slope increase of cumulative infected, and an optimiser, with a parametrisation of the government restriction time
series, to understanding the best set of mitigating actions. Data for two territories, Italy and Taiwan, have been gathered to model
government restrictions in traveling, testing and enforcement of social distance measures as well as people connectivity and
adherence to government actions. It is found that a larger and earlier testing campaign with tighter entry restrictions benefit both
regions, resulting in significantly less confirmed cases. Interestingly, this scenario couples with an earlier but milder implementation of
nationwide restrictions for Italy, thus supporting Taiwan’s lack of nationwide lockdown. The results, found with a purely data-driven
approach, are in line with the main findings of mathematical epidemiological models, proving that the proposed approach has value
and that the data alone contains valuable knowledge to inform decision makers.

I NTRODUCTION

31st December 2019, China reported to the World Health
Organisation (WHO) the detection of pneumonia with an
unknown etiology in the city of Wuhan [1]. The viral agent was
identified as a novel coronavirus, subsequently named SARSCoV-2 due to genetic similarities to SARS-CoV, that is almost
identical (96% whole-genome level) to a known bat coronavirus
[2], [3], [4]. Recognising the growing epidemic, China banned
travel to and from Wuhan and activated a national emergency
response on 23rd January, invoking travel and social distancing
restrictions on a national scale [5], [6]. Despite these actions, the
virus successfully spread on a global level and by 11th March,
the WHO had declared a pandemic [7]. The ability of this virus
to spread despite acute public awareness and control actions is
currently attributed, in part, to viral shedding of presymptomatic
cases [8], [9]. With no currently approved vaccines or specific
treatments, non-pharmaceutical measures are the frontline of both

offense and defense in ‘flattening the curve’ and inhibiting the
infamous second wave respectively [10], [11].
Since the initial outbreak, researchers from the machine learning community have implemented Artificial Neural Networks
(ANNs) to address mainly two types of problems: (i) virus
detection through images and (ii) growth forecasting. For the
former, researchers aim to develop an automatic detection system
in which a neural network (typically a deep learning model) learns
the main characteristics of the resulting pneumonia from historical
images of infected patient [12], [13], [14]. In the latter, researchers
typically develop a machine learning system to predict the future
number of confirmed cases in a country from historical data [15],
[16], [17], [18]. The forecasting model typically relies on three
types of deep learning networks [19]: Fully-Connected Networks
(FCNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs).
•

Fully Connected Networks (FCNs): A FCN is a type of
ANN where the architecture is such that all the nodes in
one layer are connected to the neurons in the next layer
[20]. For example, the combination of FCN and interior
search algorithm was proposed in [21] for predicting the
future number of infected of COVID-19 people. From a
similar perspective, a FCN with three hidden layers was
also proposed to predict the number of cases in Mexico

JOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. X, NO. Y, XXX XXX

•

•

[22]. Finally, the FCNs was employed (hybridized in this
case with the well-known SIR model) to predict the peak
of COVID-19 in Spain [23]
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): RNNs are the most
widely used ANN architecture for addressing time series
forecasting in the deep learning community. In RNNs,
there is a bidirectional communication between the nodes
in the different layers. Thus, the nodes in a particular
layer are fed with both the outputs of previous and next
layers. The architecture associated to RNNs is particularly
interesting as it allows the model to memorize both short
and long terms relationships among the desired output and
the input variables [24]. Regarding the implementation
of RNNs for COVID-19 forecasting, in [16], the authors
trained an RNN model with data from the 2003 SARS
epidemic for predicting (in a SEIR model) new infections in China. In [25], the authors used a Long Short
Term Memory Neural Network (LSTMNN) to predict the
number of new cases of COVID-19 in Canada. Similarly,
LSTMs were also employed in [26] to forecast the number
of cases in India.
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): A CNN consist of one input and output layer and several hidden layers
[27]. The hidden layers of a CNNs are based on a set of
convolutional layers that convolve with multiplication or
other dot [28]. CNNs have been traditionally employed in
image classification, in particular 2-D CNNs. However,
they can also be used for times series forecasting, 1D
CNNs [29]. In the field of COVID-19 forecasting, CNNs
were proposed (as the main architecture [30] or in combination with LSTM models [31]) to analyze and predict the
number of confirmed cases in China [30], [31].

Unfortunately, current research on forecasting growth fails on
two issues: (i) they do not include a complete set of government
decision variables in the study (maybe due to their largely qualitative nature, making it difficult to encode and preprocess with
neural networks) and (ii) they do not provide guidelines on how
those variables could be combined to mitigate the effect of the
virus (at least partially). Motivated by this, we have proposed a soft
computing approach where ANNs and optimization techniques are
used concurrently to determine a different and optimal scenario
of mitigation measures. The novelty of the work is dual: (i)
this is the first study of this kind that, by merging data from
heterogeneous sources, has created a rich dataset that is able to
capture not only government actions but also the reactions and
adherence to the regulations of the population; (ii) the analysis of
mitigating measures was carried out through a novel optimization
approach where the time series of the independent variables have
been parameterised. These parameters are subsequently optimised
by means of an genetic algorithm for integer programming to
generate the new corresponding optimal time series. The neural
network model is used to predict the slope of infected people for
the new time series.
This paper is organised as follows: Sec. 2 summarises the
data gathered, sources used and quantifying techniques. Sec. 3
outlines the neural networks models tested, data preparation and
optimization method. Results are listed in Sec. 4 and discussed in
Sec. 5. This study is summarised in Sec. 6 with possible future
directions outlined.

2.1

DATA : T WO TERRITORIES , TWO TRAJECTORIES
Italy and Taiwan

By mid-February, China had successfully demonstrated that the
exponential growth of confirmed cases can be vastly mitigated
by mass quarantine or lockdown measures [32]. Unfortunately, by
then the virus was beginning to take hold in several nations. In
particular, Italy would become the next epicenter of the pandemic
[33], [34], with dire consequences on its healthcare system; before
the onset of the epidemics, Italy had approximately 5200 intensive
care beds available [35], and efforts had to be made to increase
this number during the emergency [36]: on April 3rd the number
of patients admitted to ICU reached an unprecedented figure
of 4068 [34], posing a serious threat on the solidity of the
entire system. In these extraordinary circumstances, the Italian
government instigated severe lockdown measures similar to those
implemented in China [37].
Meanwhile Taiwan, despite its close proximity and frequent
flights to China, continued to contain the growth of confirmed
cases through different yet efficient and effective government
measures [38]. These actions never escalated to a nationwide lockdown. Nevertheless they successfully prevented the exponential
growth predicted by unmitigated viral transmission [39], and did
not overwhelm their healthcare system.
With the ultimate goal of providing a foundation that could
serve policy-makers in the decision process, in regard to managing
current outbreaks or preventing a future second-wave, this study
aims to understand the impact and effectiveness of the possible
measures a nation can employ to inhibit and constrict growth.
Thus, we analyse these two different scenarios from two different
regions.
2.2

Data gathering

To capture and describe the evolution of the pandemics in the two
regions, several variables were employed describing the reaction
of the respective governments, its timeliness, the behavior of the
community, and the weather conditions. To gather the Italian
data, numerous sources were used, namely the Ministry of
Health [40], the Ministry of Interior [41] and the Department
of Civil Protection [34]. As for Taiwan, the Taiwan Centers for
Disease Control (TCDC) released timely reports to the public on
government mitigation actions [42]. This was previously reported
by [43] for data available until 24th February 2020. We extend
this data by two months until 24th April 2020. Each variable was
then coded to obtain a daily time series (Fig. 1). The dataset is
summarized below.
Border Control: Several measures have been taken to control
border admission. The different levels of action applied to
travellers entering the territory were equated to a numeric scale.
This ranges from 0 to 5 for national citizens and 0 to 7 for
non-nationals, where 0 represents zero constraints and 7 entry
banned (5 equates to 14 days quarantine). The impact of these
levels is weighted by the daily cases for each territory as recorded
by John Hopkins [33]. Details of the method used can be found
in Supplementary Material, depicted in Tables 5-7 and Fig. 5.
Italian Enforcement: In Italy, to supervise the compliance of the
population to the restrictions, the Ministry of Interior organized a
massive monitoring campaign on both individuals and businesses.
Failure to comply to the restrictions could result in fines and/or

Fig. 1: The top panel portrays the distributions of the growth curves in Italy (left) and Taiwan (right), along with the indication of
some key moments characterizing the chronological development of the epidemics. The areas shaded in grey represent the timeframe
employed by the neural networks to predict the growth, while the areas shaded in red indicate the timeframe (April 7th-24th) employed
to compute the optimization of the combination of control measures via genetic algorithm. The bottom panel illustrates, for each
territory, the set of variables collected and utilized to describe and predict the evolution of the epidemics.

criminal charges for individuals, and fines and/or suspension of
the activity for businesses. The daily report was gathered from
the website of the Ministry of Interior [41], and the daily number
of police checks on individuals and businesses was averaged to
obtain the time series Enforcement.
Taiwan Enforcement: To ensure compliance in Taiwan, Health
Declaration Forms [44] and mobile tracking were introduced with
violators earning fines and enforced group quarantine. Table 8 in
Supplementary Material lists and quantifies these consequences
as a step function.
Testing Volume: Starting from February 24th , the Italian
Department of Civil Protection released a daily public report of
the the number of tests administered, which was gathered from
its website [34] and employed as a variable Testing Volume.
In Taiwan, the TCDC initiated testing in early January, by 8th
March, 13,855 tests had been carried out, with approximately
1000 tests a day since. Testing numbers were released in the

TCDC public reports [42]. Days where exact numbers were not
released, the daily count has been interpolated by averaging the
increase of testing volume over the ‘missing’ days.
Testing Criteria: In Italy, at the beginning of the pandemic
diagnostic tests were only performed on symptomatic individuals
traveling back from China. Gradually, testing has been extended
to a larger part of the population. Each extension of the testing
inclusion criteria was modeled as a step in the corresponding
variable. The data was gathered from the website of the Ministry
of Health [45] and presented in Table 9 in Supplementary
Material. In Taiwan, surveillance information was publicly
made available by the TCDC [42] and previously noted in [43].
Initial suspect cases were screened for 26 viruses and targeted
travellers from Wuhan. As the virus spread, this was extended to
symptomatic individuals with close contact to infected individuals,
clusters of fever and pneumonia cases unresponsive to antibiotics.
Testing of symptomatic individuals was eventually extended to all
inbound travellers. The representative step function is described

JOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. X, NO. Y, XXX XXX

in Table 10 of Supplementary Material.
Government Mitigation: Over the course of the emergency,
the Italian Presidency of the Council of Ministers, the Ministry
of Health and the Department of Civil Protection issued several
decrees and ordinances of increasing severity, aimed at containing
the spread of the epidemic. The first measure was the creation of
several red zones in Northern Italy, while the last step was the
complete nationwide lockdown, along with the suspensions of all
productive businesses not directly involved in supplying essential
services. Based on the succession of these measures, we modeled
the Government Mitigation variable as a step function, with
each step corresponding to one of the legal acts. The end value
represents the complete national lockdown. In Taiwan, general
public communication including heightened hand and respiratory
hygiene recommendations started on 6th January through the
TCDC [42]. Through chance, school holidays commenced on
20th January, however they were extended for two weeks in
response to the increased spread of the virus. From there the
government mitigation actions involved heightened hygiene
practices with increased social distances guidance, e.g. large
gatherings, wearing masks in crowded public places, guidance for
educational institutions, etc. Yet, unlike Italy, they did not go into
national lockdown. Actions taken by Italy and Taiwan are listed
and quantified in Tables 11 and 12 of Supplementary Material
respectively.
Online Presence: A daily measure of home confinement is
equated to search query data via the publicly available service
Google Trends, using the search terms: Netflix, Amazon Prime
Video, Zoom Video Communications, Skype. Corresponding
search volume indices were combined into a single variable,
Online Presence. In Italy, as Fig. 1 illustrates, an initial peak
coincides with the national lockdown (March 8th, Level 5 in
Table 11), and remains at high levels until the end of our data
collection (24th April 2020). In Taiwan, despite no national
lockdown activated, an increased home presence can be seen in
mid-March in Fig. 1. This coincides with an increase growth
curve and hence could be interpreted as the public’s personal
response to the increasing number of cases in Taiwan.
National and International Flights: To quantify mobility within
and outwith both Italy and Taiwan, data from national and
international arriving and outgoing flights have been collected
from the online platform Flightradar24 [46].
Temperature and Humidity: A recent study suggests weather
parameters such as temperature and humidity can affect the
spreading of the virus [47]. Data collected from World Weather
Online [48] of 24-hours average temperature (C o ) and humidity
(%) values have been added to the data set. The online service
has been queried using Taiwan and Italy longitude and latitude
representative coordinates (23.7 and 121 for Taiwan, 43 and 12
for Italy). The value of humidity and temperature in a specific
location in each region has been taken as representative of that
territory in the period observed.
Population Awareness: To quantify people awareness of the phenomena, Google Trends can be used [49]. Data has been collected
here by querying people searches related to the list of keywords:
”coronavirus”, ”covid”, ”quarantena”, ”wuhan”, ”virus” (in Italy)

4

and ”coronavirus”, ”covid”, ”quarantine”, ”wuhan”, ”virus” (in
Taiwan). For each word the top 5 related queries are collected
and the results of all searches aggregated. In Italy, a peak can be
observed in the following days of the first case, coinciding with the
creation of red zones in Northern Italy (Fig. 1). This diminishes
only to return with the national lockdown (March 8th, Level 5
in Table 11). This online presence slowly decreases until the end
of our data collection (24th April 2020). In Taiwan, interest also
initially peaks with the first case, diminishing to peak again as
growth begins to surge along with government mitigation. The full
list of words used in the google trends analysis for both territories
is available in Table 13 of Supplementary Material.

Neural Network Models

The data collected are used as independent variables for
the multivariate time series analysis where the slope is the
dependent variable. Three neural network models are tested: 2D
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) [50], Extreme Learning
Machine (ELM) [51] and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory
Neural Network (BiLSTMNN) [52].
CNN: The deep CNN proposed in this study is composed of
four sliding convolutional filters with kernels equal to 8, 16, 32
and 32, each one connected in between by a batch normalisation
layer to speed up training and reduce the sensitivity, and a Relu
layer to set to zero any value less than zero. The output of the
convolutional layers feeds into a dropout layer for regularisation,
and a fully connected layer for the continuous prediction of the
output, the slope. The model depends on two network parameters:
the size of the CNN filter and the dropout layer probability; and
three training parameters: the mini-batch size, the learning rate
drop factor and drop period.
ELM: The ELM framework was originally presented as a single
hidden layer feedforward neural network, whose connections
between input and hidden layers are randomly assigned. The
only parameters needed to be tuned are the weights between the
hidden and the output layers, which are analytically estimated
by solving the standard least-squares minimization problem.
This methodology significantly improves the computational
burden of the algorithm and allows it to process heavy datasets
in a reasonable computational time [53]. ELM models have
reported competitive performances in both standard machine
learning datasets (regression and classification) [54] and other
more challenging problems such as image detection [55], time
series [56], topological information [57] or real-time river flow
prediction [58]. In this experimental study, the ELM neural
network version of the framework with sigmoidal and linear basis
functions in the hidden and output layers was considered. The
model critically depends on two hyper-parameters: the number of
hidden neurons, S , and the regularization penalty term, C .
LSTMNN: Unlike the two previously described models, the
LSTMNN method belongs to the family of Recurrent Neural
Networks (RNNs). In traditional Feedforward Neural Networks
(FFNNs), information moves only in a direct way from the input
layer to the output one. RNNs are based on an architecture in
which the data through the system moves constituting a direct

JOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. X, NO. Y, XXX XXX

5

cycle [59]. The main difference between standard RNNs and
LSTMNNs models is that the latter are capable of memorizing
a time series value for an arbitrary length of time. The model
used in this study is a Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) network.
This is usually a superior prediction approach in time series
forecasting than the simple LSTM model, as it learns from the
complete time series data (past and future states). The model
depends on three network hyper-parameters: the number of hidden
neurons in the bidirectional LSTM layer, the size of the first fully
connected layer, the dropout probability rate; and three training
hyper-parameters (initial learning rate, learning rate drop period
and factor).
The optimal set of hyperparameters for the neural networks
have been obtained by minimising the root mean square error
on the predictions by means of a Bayesian optimisation process.
Bayesian optimisation is an algorithm used in global optimisation
to minimise a certain objective function, treated as a black box,
by varying the value of its independent variables. The algorithm
itself relies on an internal Gaussian process that approximates the
objective function, and is trained by subsequent evaluations of the
true objective. The approximated model is used for optimisation
to reduce computational costs and for its robust nature with
stochastic noise in function evaluations.

The daily slope value is computed as the angular coefficient of the
linear regression of the values of daily cumulative infected of the
current day and two days ahead, as a smoother representation of
the daily number of infected. x is a set of optimisation variables
designed to model government restrictions previously discussed
(border control, enforcement, testing volume, testing criteria,
social distance, flight volume and people awareness), excluding
weather parameters as they are not controllable by government.
The complete set of optimisation variables for each territory is
described in Table 1. Ω is the feasible region defined by the lower
and upper bounds of the set of optimisation variables with some
constraints. Inequality constraints are introduced to enforce the
temporal order of the variables modelling quarantine incoming and
the step functions of social distance, quarantine control (only for
Taiwan) and testing criteria. To avoid the optimisation converging
towards a temporal delay of the first case, an equality constraint
is introduced to ensure the day of first confirmed case matches
reality. The optimisation problem aims to minimize the maximum
value of the slope - this can be interpreted as minimising the
number of daily infections so to not put the health care system
under extreme strain.
For Italy the problem can be formulated mathematically as

Data preparation

The collected data has been divided for training and testing,
and reshaped as feature input for the multivariate time series
analysis. Furthermore, in order to be able to use the neural
network models for the subsequent analysis, the optimisation of
government restrictions, the dependence of the historical values of
the dependent variables is omitted from the input features space.
Hence for the ELM and BiLSTMNN models the input features are
modelled as the vector

Xt = [X(t), ..., X(t + N )] ∈ R11N

where xi (t) is the i-th independent variable at time t. The hyperparameter N is optimised, by means of a Bayesian optimisation

global optimisation strategies that mimic the behaviour of natural
biological evolution of mutation and crossover. They are initialised
with a pool of potential solutions and by evolutionary operators
and applying the principle of survival of the fittest, increasingly
better offspring populations are generated, which terminate when
no further improvements can be made. Genetic algorithms have the
main advantage that they can solve problems with integer variables
and the objective function is treated as a black box.

Summary of the computational approach

We propose a soft computing algorithm which combines neural
networks and genetic algorithms, to determine (from a purely datadriven approach), the best set of mitigating actions. The algorithm
is based on two independent stages that are summarized below
and outlined in Algorithm. 1.
In the first stage, a set of neural networks models are trained to
estimate the daily slope increase of cumulative infected from variables such as government actions and the reactions and adherence
of the population to such regulations. The best performing model
is selected taking into account the reported root mean square
percentages of the neural networks implemented. The choice of
training a neural network model per territory is driven by the

Neural Network model

In this section, the performance of the different neural networks
models for Italy and Taiwan are statistically compared. For model
selection, following the recommendations reported in [60], the
time series were split in two parts: (i) the training set is roughly
the first 2 and a half months of data; and (ii) the generalization set
is the last section of each time series. The training set was used to
estimate the parameters of the models and the generalization set to
assess the performance of the different neural networks in unseen
data [60]. In the experiments, the generalization set included the
last five points of each time series, as suggested in [61]. Table
2 shows the Root Mean Square Error Percentage (RMSEP) in
the generalization set of the best run per model (out of 1000
runs), BestRM SEP , and the variation coefficient of the RMSEP
in the generalization set for the different models implemented,
CVRMSEP . Furthermore, taking into account the set of RMSEPs
of the different models over the different runs, the mean rankings
of RMSEP, RRMSEP , for the different neural networks models
are obtained (Table 2). From the analysis of the results, it can
be concluded, from a purely descriptive point of view, that the
BiLSTMNN method obtained the best results in the two problems
considered in mean rankings. Additionally, the best BiLSTMNN
achieved the best RMSEP in Taiwan and second best in Italy (more
consistent performance, more homogeneous results, better CV).

In this study, hypothesis testing was used to provide statistical
support for the discussion of the results. A performance analysis
through parametric tests could lead to mistaken conclusions in
this research study. A previous evaluation of the RMSEP values
provided by the implemented methods resulted in rejecting the
normality and equality of the variance hypothesis. For these
reasons, nonparametric tests were implemented to determine the
statistical significance of the results previously reported [62].
Specifically, two non-parametric Friedman tests were carried out
with the rankings of RMSEP of the models. For the two multivariate time series considered, the p-values associated to the Friedman
test were smaller than 0.05 (α = 0.05), and therefore, the null
hypotheses stating that all algorithms perform equally in mean
RMSEP rankings were rejected for both problems.
Based on this rejection, the nonparametric Bonferroni DunnSidak test was implemented to compare all neural network methods to the BiLSTMNN method (which was used as the control
method) [63]. Table 2 shows the p-value results of the Bonferroni
Dunn-Sidak test for the two problems considered. Thus, the
Bonferroni Dunn-Sidak’s tests indicate that the control method
(BiLSTMNN) statistically outperforms all the remaining models
in Italy and also outperforms, in statistical terms, the ELM model
for Taiwain. Furthermore, the BiLSTMNN method achieves the

best mean ranking in the two problems considered, which, in
our opinion, justifies our decision to use it as the base model
for the next stage (optimization study). An analogous study was
also performed to determine the model to be analyzed within all
the different BiLSTMNN configurations.
The best BiLSTMNN model for each region is obtained for the
optimal value of hyperparameters reported in Table 3, the network
visualisation model in Fig. 2 and the prediction model in Fig. 3.

in both cases, with a more accurate overall error in the case of Italy
(due to the less noisy nature of the Italian time series). It is important to clarify, as mentioned previously, that the lagged values of
the slope, cumulative cases or daily cases were not included in the
model to reduce dependence between input variables and assist the
interpretation of the optimum values. These variables are usually
the most discriminant in times series analysis, which highlights
even more the competitive results yielded. Thus, the BiLSTMNN
is the appealing approach for this problem.

Optimisation

A genetic algorithm has been used to solve the corresponding optimisation problem for each region and promising results have been
found that do not contradict previous findings of epidemiological
models (Figures 4 and 5). All variables are considered integer and
optimised within the bounds reported in Table 4, together with
their optimal value. The genetic algorithm, with population size
of 100 and the maximum number of generations set to 1000, has
been run with the stopping criteria set as the maximum number
of generations reached or the average relative change in the best
fitness function value over 100 generations being less than or equal
to a tolerance of 1e − 10.
The optimisation process for Italy terminates after almost 600
iterations when the change in the penalty fitness value is less
than the allowable tolerance. All constraints are satisfied and
the final objective function is 3755, with respect to the original
value of 6272. This is almost a 40% reduction with respect to the
original value and equates to a reduction of almost 21,700 infected
individuals at the end of the prediction horizon, corresponding to
16% of the actual total value.
The optimisation process for Taiwan terminates after almost
300 iterations again when the change in the penalty fitness value
is less than the allowable tolerance. All constraints are satisfied
and the final objective function is 7.6, with respect to the original
value of 23. This is almost a 63% reduction with respect to the
original vale and a reduction of 102 infected individuals at the end
of the prediction horizon, corresponding to 28% of the real value.

D ISCUSSION
Italy

As illustrated in Fig. 4, an earlier and more extensive testing
campaign (+56%) could have been combined with an earlier
creation of red zones in Northern Italy and, interestingly, with
a milder implementation of the government mitigation plan on
the rest of the country: the localized restrictions could have been
maintained as sufficient measures until 14th March. Furthermore,
in this scenario the country-wide suspension of manufacturing
businesses, a measure burdened with a substantial socio-economic
impact, is delayed and limited to a shorter period of time, while
the volume of police checks, aimed at monitoring the population
compliance, is larger and commences earlier. This is all combined
with an earlier and more pervasive consciousness of the public
about the risk posed by the epidemics and thus on the benefits of
a temporary reduction of social contacts.
The containment of the growth is also optimally managed
in Italy by earlier restrictive regulations on the intra- and extraSchengen air traffic, and by entry restrictions that span beyond the
mere suspension of direct flights to and from China. As for the
national air traffic, it could have been maintained unrestricted for
a longer timeframe: a finding to be read in the context of larger
and earlier testing, larger and earlier volume of police checks,
better awareness of the public, increased control on the infections
potentially coming from abroad.
5.2

Taiwan

Although government actions in Taiwan successfully prevented
exponential growth of confirmed cases, the optimised model
predicts earlier actions would have damped growth even further
as outlined in Fig. 5. By allowing movable dates on border control
decisions, Taiwan would have benefited from even earlier actions
against China (by a few days) and earlier self-health management
and home quarantine regulations against selected nations (those
shaded in Table 7 of Supplementary Material in February and
March, prior to 19th March by the maximum 10 days allowed).
This allows a later date for the travel restriction on all foreign
nationals that was implemented on 19th March, as well as a
slight delay in the decrease of international flight volume. The
optimizer increases testing volume 2 weeks earlier than reality
and suggests community surveillance and mandatory testing for
incoming travellers in the first week of the observatory period.
Actions regarding mitigating internal spread are also suggested
earlier - heightened hygiene practices, self-health management
of positive cases’ contact and social distance guidelines should
have occurred at least 3 weeks earlier (comparison of Fig. 5 and
Table 12 in Supplementary Material). In addition, national flight
volume should be kept low to inhibit internal spread. This allows
less people to stay at home as illustrated by the reduced online
presence. Finally we see people awareness and quarantine control
can both be delayed, the latter significantly. This suggests the
Taiwan public awareness is sufficient, and enforcement measures
like fines and mandatory quarantine may not be necessary.
5.3

Comparison

Care must be taken in comparing the growth and government
actions for two different territories. All data is not equal; different
testing methods, diagnostic criteria and methods of counting confirmed cases can affect comparisons. There may also be underlying

themes behind data / variables, e.g., the availability of personal
protection equipment like masks to enable adherence to control
measures and keep health workers safe (3 workers from healthcare
settings where reported positive by TCDC [42], while in Italy
more than 28,000 healthcare workers contracted the virus by the
end of April [64], [65]), the method and extent of a region’s
track and trace program in locating high risk individuals, cultural /
social response of a population to government actions, healthcare
capacity and quality in early isolation and treatment (0.86 vs 3.02
ICU beds per 10,000 population in Italy [35] and Taiwan [66]
respectively). To overcome such inequity of data in this study,
Italy and Taiwan were simulated independently. Variables were
chosen to be those for which there was data readily available
and have a) known or suspected effect on growth curves or b)
an ability to highlight any differences between the two territories.
Any overarching themes are then considered.
Testing: In volume of testing per number of confirmed cases,
Taiwan exceeded Italy [67]. In volume of testing per population,
the roles reverse while Taiwan began testing earlier. Regardless, in
modelling both regions, the same recommendation resulted from
optimization, higher testing volume (and earlier). This agrees with
results from a recent model that distinguishes between tested and
untested infections cases [68], benefits of systematic testing [69] as
well as statistical observations from South Korea [70]: extensive
testing with track and trace and social distance restrictions may
contain the growth to an extent where a national lockdown can be
avoided.
Border control: Either a reduction in international flights is
required or a strong border control measure. We see these two
measures ‘meet’ in Fig. 4 for Italy, where the optimizer only
allowed 10 day shifts. The border control in optimized Taiwan
doesn’t drop below 0.7591 (which is obtainable by 10 day shifts),
which is roughly satisfied by mandatory 14 day home quarantine
for incoming travellers from infected areas (pending on incoming
/ outgoing traveller ratios). This allows slightly more international
flights (Fig. 5). These translate to earlier action against other
nations than China for both Italy and Taiwan.
People awareness and compliance: In Taiwan, enforcement
of regulations appears not to be a driving factor while people
awareness is seemed to be almost ideal. Italy, on the other
hand, would have benefited from earlier awareness by the public
and earlier implementation of quarantine control. These results

seem to highlight the cultural and social differences of the two
territories and can be justified empirically using the well-known
Hofstede dimensions [71]. Specifically, with a score of 50 in
the Power Distance dimension, Northern Italy tends to prefer
equality and a decentralisation of power and decision-making.
Control and formal supervision is generally disliked among the
younger generation. Furthermore, the high score obtained in the
Individualism dimension (76 points) accentuates the aversion of
the Italian citizen to being supervised and limited in his/her autonomy. Conversely, Taiwan is a hierarchical society in which people
accept that hierarchical order and needs no further justifications
(the scores in the Individualism and Power Distance dimensions
are 17 and 58 points, respectively).

National lockdown: Taiwan never implemented a national lockdown and our results support this decision, even hinting that
the observed self-inflicted increase in home activities carried out
by the public was not necessary. However maintaining hygiene
and social distancing while in public was deemed important and
should have happened earlier. Italy, alternatively may have delayed
or reduced their nationwide lockdown as a result of increasing
testing, border control, quarantine enforcement, public awareness
and restrictions localized in the most affected areas.

Limitations: It must be noted that neural networks have limitations as they behave as stochastic processes. It should therefore
be highlighted that this study further complements existing results
by mathematical modelling and statistical analysis. That a dataonly driven model arrives at the same results, further fortifies
their conclusions. It should also be noted that hindsight is 20-20.
This study does not serve to criticise governments’ management
of the pandemic but to assist in preventing a second wave. In
particular at the time of most national lockdowns: China was the
only example of a nation that had recovered from exponential
growth (accomplished by a nationwide lockdown); a large part
of the research this study supports was not yet complete; the
power of testing and border control illustrated by South Korea and
Taiwan respectively had not been fully witnessed; and knowledge
of the virus and how it spread via pre-symptomatic individuals or
reservoirs was not yet known. However, this exemplifies that as
research continues and expands, so will our knowledge and with
that more and more tools to overcome this pandemic.

C ONCLUSION

This is the first purely data-driven study where quantitative and
qualitative data have been merged and used in a multivariate
time series model aimed at predicting the daily increase of the
cumulative infected people. We provide an updated and extensive
epidemiology overview of both Italy and Taiwan. The purely datadriven approach yielded results that are in line with the main
findings of the epidemiological models, proving that the approach
has value and that the data alone contains valuable knowledge to
inform decision makers.
An in depth discussion of the results obtained has been provided for each of the territories analysed: our main finding being

earlier and larger deployment of testing among the population and
national entry restrictions allow an easing of lockdown. These
are combined with socio-cultural identification of driving factors
in each individual territory; stricter enforcement of regulations
and information in Italy and relaxation of control measures and
self-imposed home confinement in Taiwan. These results give
scientific insight to the impact of government actions, fortifying those results previously shown with purely epidemiological
models. Hence, this strengthens the foundation for policy makers
in constraining growth in current outbreaks and future potential
second waves.
This first proof of principle can be built on in several dimensions. One can include more variables, into the time series, for

Fig. 5: Optimal solution for Taiwan. On the right axis, black solid line represents the original variable, red solid line is the optimised
solution. On the left axis the histograms of slope values for original solution (grey) and optimal one (red) are reported. Last plot
represents the cumulative value of infected people in the region for original solution.

example the availability of ICU beds or personal protection equipment (masks, facial shields). A similar study can be completed for
other countries that have experienced a different trend in infections
growth rate and that have implemented differently containment
measures, e.g., Sweden, United States, Australia, New Zealand,
etc. The different models can be analysed in comparison to further
increase our understanding of the relation between government
actions and social behaviour, and the growth of the epidemics.
This study, along with further developments, in turn can be
used to build on existing epidemiology models with the addition
of new variables and their fine-tuned effects.

HIS is the supplementary material supporting the paper,
Optimisation of non-pharmaceutical measures in COVID-19
via nerual networks. We give further details on the data gathering
in both description and methods of quantification, which are
summarised in the Tables and Figure provided below.
Sec. 8 summarises the measures taken by Italy and Taiwan in
restricting entry and quarantining incoming travellers. We describe
in detail the method used to quantify these restrictions as outlined
in the Tables 5, 6 and 7. Other variables that required more details
and an outline of actions are described in Sec. 9. These include
enforcement (Taiwan only), testing criteria, government mitigation and population awareness as recapped in Tables 8 (Taiwan
enforcement), 9 & 10 (testing criteria), 11 & 12 (government
mitigation), and 13 (population awareness).

8.1

Level descriptions

The different levels of action applied to travellers entering the
country were equated to a numeric scale. This ranges from 0 to
5 for national citizens and 0 to 7 for non-nationals as depicted in
Table 5, where 0 represents zero constraints and 7 entry banned.
Level 1 involves quarantine inspections that targets symptomatic travellers on direct flights from an infected area. Level 2,
whilst still targeting symptomatic passengers, opens to those with
a travel history to an infected area within 14 days. Level 3 requires
health declaration forms from an infected area by all travellers,
therefore expanding the target to asymptomatic travellers [44].
Level 4 indicates a 14-day self-health management; in Tawian
the TCDC describes this as: hand and respiratory health, record
temperature and activities twice daily, avoid public places (wearing a face mask if necessary), and contact local health bureaus if
fever or respiratory symptoms develop (inform physician of any
history of travel, occupation, contact, and cluster) [72].
Level 5 requires individuals to a 14-day home quarantine;
again for Taiwan the TCDC required travellers to follow several
measures [44]; mask on arrival, private transportation from airport/point of entry, hand and respiratory health, stay at home, keep
one meter away from those sharing the same household and avoid
contact with them. Quarantine/isolation hotels can be availed of
if one’s home/destination does not qualify for home quarantine.
Groceries or necessary products are to be obtained via help of
household or family members, alternatively one can contact the
care and support center for quarantined/isolated individuals. Nonurgent medical care should be postponed and if symptoms develop,
individuals are not to seek medical attention by themselves but
contact health authorities to arrange their medical care.
Level 6 has a restriction on entry visas for specified foreign
nationals while level 7 involves a ban on entry for non-residents.
8.2

Italy

On January 31st, the Italian Presidency of the Council of Ministers, the Ministry of Health issued the suspension of direct flights
between Italy and China. After this decision, other measures of
increasing severity have been taken to control the cross-border
traffic. Data regarding these legal acts was collected from the
archive of regulations issued by the Ministry of Health [40]. Dates
and detail are listed below in Table 6 along with the suitable
quarantine levels as described in Table 5.

8.3

Taiwan

Taiwan initiated on-board quarantine inspections on the same day
China reported cases of pneumonia of an unknown etiology in
the city of Wuhan to the World Health Organisation (WHO), 31st
December 2019. From there they adapted to the global spread
of the virus, with different requirements rolled out for different
regions of the world as outlined in Table 7. As the epidemic in
China worsened, Taiwan increased entry requirements for different
provinces of China. Initially they focused on symptomatic travellers from Wuhan, escalating to an entry ban for Wuhan residents
on 23th January, with severe restrictions on all Chinese citizens
following on 26th January. Early February saw an entry ban for
Chinese citizens and foreign nationals with a travel history in
China, Macau or Hong Kong, with home quarantine for Taiwan,
Macau and Hong Kong residents. By end of February, as the
virus spread globally, Taiwan initiated a variation of self-health
management and home quarantine for travellers from Thailand,
Italy, Iran, Singapore, Japan and South Korea. In March, as
the situation in Europe worsened, Taiwan further enhanced its
measures by mandatory quarantine for incoming travellers from
Schengen, U.K., Ireland, and Dubai. This was quickly followed by
several Asian countries, Moldova, U.S., New Zealand, Australia
and Canada. On 19th March, Taiwan announced banned entry for
all foreign national travellers without documents of granted entry.
In addition to these actions, in rare cases where it was acknowledged that mandatory quarantine orders had been issued later
than ideal, retrospective health monitoring was put in place for
recently arrived travellers from specified regions. Other scenarios
that required spacial attention to which the Central Epidemic
Command Center (CECC) reacted include: the docking of the
Princess Diamond where the use of smart technology assisted
in identifying and following up with 627,386 individuals [73];
special requirements in dealing with Taiwan residents on other
cruise ships; evacuating Taiwan residents from Wuhan [74]; and
an outbreak on a three-ship fleet, Dunmu (敦睦) Fleet.
This is summarized in Table 7, along with the allocated level
as described in Table 5. Some information was not included in the
analysis, yet still included in Table 7 for completeness.
8.4

Quantifying border control

To quantify these actions for both Taiwan and Italy, each territory
is allocated a quality of control between 0 and 1 each day, thus
creating a time series for both regions as illustrated in Figure. 6.
To compute this level of control on a given day for either territory,
the following procedure was followed using available data from
John Hopkins University [33].
The daily cases of every country reported globally have been
collected and smoothed by a rolling 3-day average (previous, current, day after). The percentage of daily cases associated with each
country is then computed, with respect to the global daily cases,
and excluding daily cases in Taiwan and Italy respectively (as it is
their protection from incoming cases being gauged). For Taiwan,
areas associated with China that were treated differently, i.e., different regulations on different dates, include Hubei, Guangdong,
Zhejiang, China (rest), Hong Kong and Macau. When actions were
directed by cities, provincial data was used. In addition, some
states of the United States (U.S.) were treated differently, namely
Washington, New York and California. As actions differed only
by a day, the date of regulations affecting these states have been
taken to represent all of the U.S.

TABLE 6: Border control measures initiated by Italy. Shaded regions are actions, the dates of which are varied in optimisation.

As different levels of quarantine are implemented for residents
and non-residents (see Table 7 and 6 for Taiwan and Italy respectively). Statistics from the Taiwan Tourism Bureau [75] for
2019 have been used to encapsulate the ratio of travellers that are
residents and visitors as outbound and inbound respectively. For
China, the national statistics were used for each province. Similar
information was obtained from the World Tourism Organisation
for Italy visitors [76] and returning residents [77] in 2018. This
data has been used to obtain a weighted-level time series by dot
product of the ratios (residents, non-residents) and the levels associated for that day for each country. For example, with travellers
from South Korea to Taiwan

W L(SK) (n)

=

2
X

L(SK) (n, i) ∗ RT (SK) (i),

i=1

⇒ W L(SK) (37)

= 0.4932 ∗ 1 + 0.5068 ∗ 0.7143
= 0.8552,

where L(SK) (n) is the level on day n from South Korea (on day
37 or 27th February we have L(SK) (37) = ( 55 , 57 ) from Table
7) and RT (SK) is the ratio of travellers (outbound, inbound) with
RT (SK) = (0.4932, 0.5068) from [75].
The time series quantifying the border control for say Taiwan
entry from each country is calculated by multiplying the percentage of daily cases for a given country on a given day by the
weighted-level calculated for that country on that day. Again, for
the above example of South Korea on day 37,

T S (SK) (n) =
⇒ T S (SK) (37) =

W L(SK) (n) ∗ D(SK) (n),
0.8552 ∗ 0.4092 = 0.3499,

where D(SK) (n) is the smoothed daily global percentage of
cases associated with South Korea on day n (with Taiwan cases
removed) obtained using John Hopkins data [33]. By summing
all the time series for each country, the daily total quarantine
incoming measure for Taiwan (or Italy) on each day is retrieved.
This summing of reactions is illustrated by a stacked bar graph in
Figures 6a and 6b for Italy and Taiwan respectively.

ERNMENT ACTIONS AND POPULATION RESPONSE

9.1

Taiwan enforcement

To encourage compliance with quarantine and isolation orders
in Taiwan, fines were introduced early of NT$150,000 and
NT$300,000 respectively (USD$5,000 and USD$10,000) and
raised to NT$1 million (USD$33,000) on 27th March and mandatory group quarantine at a designated centre. Health Declaration
Cards were required by travellers from high-risk areas from 24th
January with smart technologies announced on 28th ; this evolved
into the Entry Quarantine System announced on 14th February
- an online system where travellers could obtain a mobile health
declaration pass on their phones. This hastened the immigration
process, allowed the Taiwan healthcare system immediate access
to travel history of ‘perspective’ future patients and further enabled
mobile tracking of quarantined individuals. Inaccurate information
earned travellers a NT$150,000 fine (USD$5,000). By 3rd April,
the LINE Bot system was announced to track quarantined individuals, however the newer system also allowed voluntary health
reporting and updated information on prevention measures. These
were reported to the public [42] (ongoing) and previously noted in
[43] (until 24th February 2020). Table 8 lists and quantifies these
consequences as a step function.
9.2

Testing criteria

The progression of testing in who qualified for tests for both Italy
and Taiwan are summarised in Tables 9 and 10 respectively below.

Government mitigation

Actions taken by both governments to implement social distancing
and health promotion are listed and quantified for both Italy and
Taiwan in Tables 11 and 12 respectively.
