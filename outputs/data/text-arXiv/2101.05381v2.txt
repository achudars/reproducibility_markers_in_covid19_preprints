Abstract
Estimation of the prevalence of undocumented SARS-CoV-2 infections is critical for understanding
the overall impact of CoViD-19, and for implementing effective public policy intervention strategies. We
discuss a simple yet effective approach to estimate the true number of people infected by SARS-CoV-2,
using raw epidemiological data reported by official health institutions in the largest EU countries and
the USA.

Introduction

As the coronavirus disease 2019 (CoViD-19) epidemic reached every corner of the world, each country has
adopted different interventions to manage the early and long-term phases of the spread of the epidemic.
This epidemic has forced many countries to react by imposing policies aimed at reducing population
mobility together with internal and international border limitations. These policies have been informed
by various measures of epidemic risk that all trace back to the number of new cases that the country’s
healthcare system has found each day. Unrecorded and unnoticed cases make it difficult to estimate the
true number of infected persons present at a given time (prevalence).
Cases of infection are usually detected through testing, typically occurring when ill people (or their
recent contacts) seek healthcare. Official data are mainly collected with medical swabs. This favors the
examination of patients showing clear symptoms. However, key features of CoViD-19’s dynamics have to
do with asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic transmission [1, 2]. Transmission of severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can occur before symptom onset in the infector, which presents
a stumbling block to efforts to stop the spread of the disease. Infected persons often do not develop
noticeable symptoms until after the viral latent period, the time between being infected with the virus
and first becoming contagious. (This differs from the incubation period: the time between being infected
1

with the virus and first developing symptoms.) Recent studies [3, 4, 5] have found that SARS-CoV-2 has
the notable property that the latent period of SARS-CoV-2, is shorter than the incubation period of the
virus. Thus, individuals can become contagious even before they show symptoms. Early in the epidemic,
and in various situations afterward, diagnosis has been based on having a certain set of symptoms.
More commonly, an infection diagnosis comes from direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by nucleic acid
amplification tests, typically reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from the upper
respiratory tract. Furthermore, testing capacity depends on the demands a healthcare system is under.
So that the confirmed case numbers reported during an outbreak represent only a fraction of the true
levels of infection in a community.
Undocumented infections often are not detected due to mildness, limitedness, or absence of symptoms.
As they are not quarantined, they can expose far more of the population to the virus, thereby sustaining
the spread of the epidemic. Moreover, the fraction of undocumented (but still infectious) cases is a
critical epidemiological feature that modulates the pandemic potential of a virus. The ability to estimate
the scale of an epidemic is of paramount importance medically, socially, and economically, as it affects
viral hot-spot detection, resource allocation, and intervention planning. Restrictive measures have indeed
exempted firms producing essential goods and services. In addition, companies able to massively employ
remote work have succeeded in mitigating the negative effects. Better estimation of the true prevalence
of CoViD-19 cases is crucially important to set the strength and scale of non-medical interventions and
improve the evaluation of the economic and health impacts associated with lockdown and reopening
policies.
Many modeling methods use the mortality rate to estimate the scale of CoViD-19 [6, 7, 8, 9]. These
methods rely on fixed estimates of certain epidemiological properties (such as the onset-to-death interval
distribution and the generation-time distribution). Further, they assume that the fatality rate is the
same everywhere and that its true value is near the lowest observed value (' 0.5 − 1.0%). Finally, these
methods require a long time to produce results. We propose an independent way to estimate the true
incidence of SARS-CoV-2. The intuition behind this approach lies in the well-known effect that depletion
of the susceptible population reduces the reproduction number Rt . We make a quantitative analysis of
this saturation effect to estimate the true scale of the Covid-19 pandemic, i.e., the order of magnitude of
the actual number of people that have been infected.
In the Methods section, we explain the mathematical background for the estimation of the fraction of
un-diagnosed cases by using both the number of new positive tests and the instantaneous reproduction
number Rt . In the Data and Results section, we show the results for Italy, France, Spain, Germany, and
USA. In the Conclusions section, we summarized our research and conclude the paper.

Methods

At the very beginning of an epidemic, the fraction of the population that is susceptible to the disease is 1.
The basic reproduction number, R0 , is the average number of people that are infected by a single infected
person per day when everyone is susceptible. In general, R0 depends on the capacity of the virus to infect
2

people, as well as on aspects that vary from country to country such as social habits, movement patterns,
average health status, and sanitation. Moreover, the reproduction number may depend on time due to
seasonal conditions, air humidity, UV exposure, and social changes (e.g., an increase in mask wearing or
increased average interpersonal distance). When people become immune or die the susceptible fraction of
the population decreases. All else being equal, this leads to a decrease in the instantaneous (or apparent,
or actual) reproduction number, Rt . This phenomenon is described by the following relation:
Rt = R0 (t) (1 − C(t)) .

(1)

Here, C(t) is the true fraction of the population that has been infected at time t. Let us suppose that the
testing system of a region is not able to detect every positive case, we define
λ(t) ≡

c(t)
detected cases
=
,
actual cases
C(t)

(2)

where c(t) is the total number of detected cases (the cumulative number of cases) as a fraction of the
whole population.
The instantaneous reproduction number, Rt , is an important tool for detecting changes in disease transmission over time [10, 11]. Policy makers and public health officials use Rt to assess the effectiveness of
interventions and to inform policy. Specifically, the instantaneous reproduction number measures disease
transmission at a given point in time, t. One can interpret it as the average number of people that each
contagious individual at time t would infect per day, if conditions remained unchanged. We assume,
following [12, 13, 14], that Rt depends on the number of new cases per day, j(t), only through 1 − C(t)
(as in Eq.(1)) and that j(t) obeys the so-called renewal equation:
d
j(t) = C(t) =
dt

Z ∞

A(t, τ )j(t − τ )dτ + i(t),

(3)

0

where i(t) is the number of imported cases per day, and τ represents the infection age, the amount of
time since an individual became infected.
The function A(t, τ ) is a product of Rt and the generation-time distribution g(t, τ )[15]. The distribution
g(t, τ ) represents the probability density for a person infected at time t − τ to be infectious at time t
R
(as with any probability density 0∞ g(t, τ )dτ = 1). For simplicity, we assume that this distribution is
independent of t, i.e., g(t, τ ) = g(τ ), so that
Z ∞

j(t) = Rt

g(τ )j(t − τ )dτ.

(4)

0

Typically, the generation distribution is unknown, though it can be approximated by assuming it is the
same as the serial-interval distribution, which refers to the time between successive cases in a chain of
transmission. We follow [16] in using a gamma function given by
g(τ ) = β α τ α−1 exp(−βτ )

(5)

with α = 1.87 and β = 0.28. We estimate Rt by [10]
Rt = R∞

where j̃(t) ≡ dc
dt = dt C(t) + λ(t)j(t). We assume that λ(t) changes slowly enough that j̃(t) ≈ λ(t)j(t)
)
1
and λ(t−τ
λ(t) ≈ 1 (for 0 ≤ τ . β ), so that the approximation in Eq.(6) holds.

Starting from the saturation effect of Eq.(1), we wish to find two unknown variables namely, R0 and λ.
With ideal data, one could immediately apply linear fitting techniques. However, the data reported by
most countries are affected by a strong weekly fluctuation. To reduce this effect, we perform a moving
average of the Rt obtained over 7 or 14 days (the results are almost identical).
As Fig.2 shows, R0 (t) abruptly increased at the end of September, then decreased in the first days of
November. Since R0 (t) varied significantly, a simple linear fit with R0 as a parameter would yield poor
results. Instead we make an independent estimate of R0 (t) by doing a weighted average of the Rt ’s
obtained in all the regions in a country at a given calendar time t. This estimate reads as:
hR0 (t)i =

1

X

Nregions

k∈regions

(k)

Rt

1
,
1 − c(k) (t)

(7)

where c(k) (t) is the fraction of the population recorded as having been infected in region k up to time t,
(k)
while Rt is the value obtained using Eq.(6) at time t in region k 1 . We apply a linear fit to Rt /hR0 (t)i
as a function of c(t). Inserting Eq.(7) into Eq.(1), we obtain

c(t)
Rt
= (1 − C(t)) = 1 −

hR0 (t)i

(8)

So we interpret the intercept of the fit as an extrapolation of the initial susceptible population fraction
and the slope as λ1 .

Data and Results

In this section, we apply our method to data and obtain satisfactory results. Our data sources are listed in
Table 1 below. The analysis was performed at the regional level in all the countries, specifically: Regione
for Italy, Region for France, Länder for Germany, Comunidad autónoma for Spain, Federal States for the
USA, and Regions of England plus Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland for the UK. For each region,
the total population used to calculate c(t) was retrieved from the most recent census available online
(except for regions of France which report population size directly in the dataset). All the data files offer
extended epidemiological reports; however, we only used the number new CoViD-19 cases per day.
In some cases, official institutions supply data by date of onset of symptoms, as in the case of Italy, see
Fig.1. This type of data is especially nice for finding the instantaneous reproduction number Rt . Indeed,
Italian Istituto Superiore di Sanità currently uses these values because they are virtually unaffected by

One should use instead hR0 (t)i = Nregions
Rt 1−c(k)(t)
but the value of λ at this stage is unknown. We use
k∈regions
/λ
a recursive approach inserting the value obtained in the linear fit procedure explained below and then repeating the whole
procedure. In any case we see a negligible difference in the value of λ obtained by using the simplest factor 1 − c(k) (t) as in
Eq.(7), so we present the simplest approach.

fluctuations in testing capacity. Unfortunately, these data are only available for the whole country rather
than particular regions. So, we only used these data to compare our measure of Rt with the one based
on the raw data of new infections. We find that our measure is accurate up to reasonable statistical
fluctuations.

Now we turn to Fig.2 and Fig.3. For each country we plot the value of Rt for its regions versus time
and Rt /hR0 (t)i versus c(t) along with the best fit for λ. The fit was performed neglecting the first 100
days of the epidemic when testing was quite irregular and the number of PCR tests extremely low. The
error on λ was evaluated by changing this threshold from 50 to 150 days.

A straightforward application of the estimate of the true number of infections is to adjust the case fatality
rate (CFR) to better approximate the infectious fatality rate (IFR). The CFR is defined as the number
of reported deaths per number of reported cases. It approximates IFR, which is an estimate of the death
rate among all those infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes CoViD-19. In table 2 we estimate
the unrecorded fraction of the true number of infected individuals as well as the corrected value of the
case fatality rate (λ-CFR). This correction does not capture every reason the CFR can differ from the
IFR. Some additional differences are due to delayed effects, population age, typical medical conditions of
the population, and healthcare system efficiency.

As the vaccination campaign continues, we must consider the effects of immunization through vaccination on our analysis. The functional form will change to Rt /hR0 i ∼ (1 − c(t)/λ) (1 − ν(t)) '
(1 − c(t)/λ − ν(t)), where new term takes in account the vaccinated fraction of the population ν(t).
If data on the vaccination campaign are available at the regional level, and ν(t) reaches a substantial
value, one should perform a two-dimensional fit of Rt /hR0 i as a function of c(t) and v(t). The slope of
the iso-Rt /hR0 i lines, i.e., the lines in the c(t) − v(t) plane of constant Rt /hR0 i, will give another estimate
of λ. This will allow us to compare and contrast the effects of vaccination and new infectious cases on
Rt . If λ ' 1, their effects should be the same. If λ < 1, we expect that the effect of a given number of
infectious individuals on Rt to be larger than that of the same number of vaccinated.

Robustness check using seroprevalence data Our findings can be checked by comparing our results with
alternative methods used to evaluate the true number of people that have had SARS-CoV-2. One of the
most reliable methods is the analysis of seroprevalence of IgG antibodies in blood. We compare our λ
values with those obtained by two papers [26, 27] and a dashboard on an official website [28].
In particular, [26] reports the fraction of people showing IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 over the number
of officially reported cases as of the end of May 2020. This ratio should be compared with λ−1 . In Table
3 of [26] data for 10 sites are reported. They range from a minimum of 6.0 for Connecticut to a maximum
of 23.8 for Missouri. The worst hit state, New York, has a value of 11.9. In Fig.4 (left panel), we report
the value of λ using data covering the same period, namely ending May 23rd , 2020. We report our best fit
yielding λ = 0.06, together with the line corresponding to the λ obtained from serological data described
in [26]. The same approach was followed in Fig.4 (right panel), where we report the typical value retrieved
from [28] (between 6 and 7 times the official number of cases) with our fit at the date of the last update

color online) same approach as in the left panel with data ending July 30th , 2020 compared with the average value given by
[28] (λ = 1/6)

of the website (July 2020).
Passing from late spring to the end of summer, λ increased considerably. This effect is apparent in the
dashboard data [28] and the same pattern holds in all countries analyzed. We presume this increase is
due to increased testing ability and contact tracing efforts made in all countries. Nevertheless, as a final
remark, we stress that if our results are confirmed, in all countries the tracing capacity is not enough, by
itself, to mitigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Due to the large contribution of asymptomatic or mildsymptomatic cases, we think that reaching a value of λ ' 1 would be necessary. This would require a
massive use of tests as seen, for example, in China during its prevention of a second wave.
Finally, in comparing our approach to the seroprevalence data, we found that our method gives results
that are of the same order of magnitude. Our method tends to overestimate the serological results. This
could be mark against our approach, but one should note that seroprevalence-based infection estimates
are conservative [28]. Some studies have found that infected persons who are asymptomatic or have
mild symptoms do not have detectable antibodies. Other studies found that antibody levels decrease
and become undetectable in some patients over time (see, for example, [29, 30]). Another explanation
of this overestimation is that the number of susceptible individuals is not the entire population due to
cross-immunity with other common coronaviruses [31, 32, 33].

Conclusions

Knowledge of true prevalence of CoViD-19 is critical for informing policy decisions about how to distribute
resources and manage the impacts of CoViD-19 on public health, society and the economy[34, 35]. The
true scale of the epidemic can affect economic development since it reduces long-run economic growth by
limiting the size of social networks. On the contrary a low prevalence estimate could lead people to take

9

more epidemic-relevant risks, making disease eradication impossible using social distancing policies only.
We have proposed a method to estimate the true number of infected people, unveiling the true scale of
CoViD-19 by using PCR test data alone.We the used this method to estimate a more reliable case fatality
rate. Our approach is a phenomenological estimate of the true scale of the epidemic, since it is based
on an empirical relationship between phenomena, in a way which is consistent with fundamental theory,
but is not directly derived from that theory. Consequently, our method can be affected by errors which
we are not able to distinguish from the lack of theoretical understanding. Nevertheless, there are two
remarkable results. The few attempts to assesss the true impact of SARS-CoV-2 via serological tests
yield λ-values comparable in order of magnitude with our calculations [36]. Moreover, countries that
performed better tracing, like the USA, experienced a fatality rate lower than Italy, France, and Spain (in
the first wave). Improved contact tracing performance (higher λ) leads to a lower fatality rate because the
rate is calculated using the correct denominator. Good contact tracing can also help keep the epidemic
under control, preventing the virus from reaching fragile and elderly people. Thus leading to a bona fide
decrease in the fatality rate.
We have proposed that the study of the graph Rt vs c(t) and Rt /hR0 (t)i vs c(t) can provide useful insight
into epidemic dynamics. These methods should be useful in other epidemics with incomplete data due
to the presence of unrecorded contagious individuals, for example, the seasonal flu. Minor modifications
allow this approach to keep its effectiveness even in the presence of active vaccination campaigns. By
contributing to a better-informed response to epidemics, we believe this work serves to benefit society as
a whole.
