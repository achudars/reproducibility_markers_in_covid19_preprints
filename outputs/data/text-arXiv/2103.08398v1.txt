Abstract
This paper relies on a microsimulation framework to undertake an analysis of the distributional
implications of the COVID-19 crisis over three waves. Given the lack of real-time survey data
during the fast moving crisis, it applies a nowcasting methodology and real-time aggregate
administrative data to calibrate an income survey and to simulate changes in the tax benefit
system that attempted to mitigate the impacts of the crisis. Our analysis shows how crisisinduced income-support policy innovations combined with existing progressive elements of
the tax-benefit system were effective in avoiding an increase in income inequality at all stages
of waves 1-3 of the COVID-19 emergency in Ireland. There was, however, a decline in
generosity over time as benefits became more targeted. On a methodological level, our paper
makes a specific contribution in relation to the choice of welfare measure in assessing the
impact of the COVID-19 crisis on inequality.

1. Introduction
“COVID-19 does not discriminate” is a phrase that has been used extensively. A google search
reveals 80300 uses of the phrase. Users vary from the United Nations Human Rights, media
outlets, and academic papers. However Patel et al. (2020) argue convincingly that this “is a
dangerous myth, sidelining the increased vulnerability of those most socially and economically
deprived.” The COVID-19 crisis has brought a major impact on health, on economies and on
personal incomes in a highly asymmetric way, affecting different people in different ways.
Given the rapid spread of the COVID-19 virus, governments have had to respond rapidly and
quite severely to flatten the curve and slow the spread of the virus. This has had significant
implications on many aspects of life, acting differentially on different groups. In many cases,
interventions have been crude, by necessity, given the paucity of data and diagnostics necessary
for more targeted policy and given the need for speed to stop the transmission of the virus. The
impact of the COVID-19 virus on people is multi-faceted (O’Donoghue et al., 2020). In
addition to the medical and health impacts, there are direct and indirect economic and social
impacts, including market effects and policy mitigation.
Given the increase in home working, there are also important impacts on disposable income in
relation to work related costs. Indeed, households who have not lost their income will indirectly
have received a windfall gain in terms of an increase in purchasing power during the crisis as
a result of lower work-related costs or higher pandemic benefits than previous work incomes.
Lower opportunities to spend has meant an overall large increase in savings. Finally, there may
be differential price impacts.
One of the challenges in trying to understand the distributional impact of a fast moving crisis
is the time lag between the availability of micro data and the crisis. There is a growing literature
in utilising nowcasting, taken from the macro literature (Giannone et al., 2008) to adjust survey
data and make it consistent with current macro-economic trends.3 However, improving policy
design requires knowledge about policy incidence and change on the distribution that raises
the need in disaggregated nowcasting for microsimulation purposes, reviewed in O’Donoghue
and Loughrey (2014).
The majority of the microsimulation literature on nowcasting utilises the EUROMOD taxbenefit model. For example, Leventi et al. (2014) and Navicke et al. (2014) applied the
nowcasting method to update poverty indicators (calibrating within population sub-groups) by
linking income surveys such as the Survey of Income and Living Conditions to aggregated
labour market conditions from the European Labour Force Survey. The approach has been
applied during COVID-19 for a number of European Countries (Beirne et al. 2020; Brewer and
Gardiner, 2020; Brewer and Tasseva, 2020; Bronka et al., 2020; Figari and Fiorio, 2020).
There have been a number of alternative approaches. Addabbo et al. (2016) improved the
heterogeneity of transitions by estimating parametric equations to capture employment changes
using EUROMOD instead of cell based Monte-Carlo simulations. Instead of calibrating
income surveys to labour force surveys, Carta (2020) imputed labour income onto recent labour
force data, albeit only looked at the distribution of market income. O’Donoghue et al. (2020)
and Sologon et al. (2020) also utilised a parametric approach, but drawing upon the alignment
methodology of the dynamic microsimulation literature described in Li and O’Donoghue
(2014).
3

Another literature has produced nowcasted aggregate poverty rates (Álvarez et al., 2014).

2

Li et al. (2020) took a different approach along the lines of the static ageing literature
(Immervoll et al., 2005) – a semi-parametric perspective – drawing upon the methodology of
DiNardo, Fortin and Lemieux (1996). Although incorporating flexible distributional forms, the
semi- or non-parametric methods have a risk of relying on small cells sizes, particularly when
there are a lot of dimensions used in the reweighting (Klevmarken, 1997). Therefore, in this
paper, we utilise a parametric approach initially applied in O’Donoghue et al. (2020) in order
to study the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on the distribution of household income. We extend
this analysis from an initial impact assessment of the start of the crisis to an evaluation of
changes over the course of the crisis.
In this paper, we take Ireland as a case study. It is a country that was significantly affected by
the Great Recession (O’Donoghue et al. 2013, 2018). At the time of writing, Ireland has also
been through three phases of the COVID-19 crisis (Figure 1). In response to this crisis, the
State instituted three main support payments: the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP)
targeting those who were laid off work because the business had to close as a result of the
pandemics; the COVID Enhanced Illness Benefit (CEIB) for those who were out of work either
due to contracting the COVID-19 virus or because they had to self-isolate due to a close
contact; and various COVID Wage Subsidies (CWS) aimed at supporting employers to
maintain employment contract with employees despite the fall in revenues. Figure 2 highlights
the growth in demand for these payments over the crisis, peaking at nearly a million recipients
of all benefits for a work force of just over 2 million.4

Figure A.1 in Appendix A also outlines the phases of economic restrictions over the course of the two waves,
with the trend in expenditure per Revolut user over the period. It shows the decline and then recovery of
expenditure in the first wave and subsequent fall again in the second wave as restrictions, particularly in retail and
hospitality sectors, were applied.

Because of the multi-faceted nature of the shock, affecting market incomes but also demands
for childcare, commuting costs and mortgage costs, we utilise a non-standard definition of
disposable income, which relies on adjusting household disposable equivalized income for
work-related and housing expenditures, as well as for some capital losses. At the core of our
nowcasting approach lies a household income generation model (Sologon et al., 2021). The
model relies on data from the Survey of Income and Living Conditions (SILC) calibrated to
account for the labour market and policy impacts of COVID-19 using administrative data and
the Labour Force Survey (LFS). This allows generating counterfactual income distributions as
a function of more timely external data than the underlying income survey.
2. Methodology
We model the distributional impact of COVID-19 and its associated policy responses. From an
economic perspective, the COVID-19 virus affects people differentially across different
dimensions, including:

Those who get sick have a spectrum of consequences from self-isolation and time away
from work, study and family to hospitalization and mortality.

A far greater proportion of the population are affected by closing businesses and their
loss of income or the social implications of cocooning. Unlike a typical demand shock,
the biggest impacts are felt by those in so called non-essential businesses. The income
implications are varied from total loss of income to increased income in some retail
businesses.

This impact on the economy has seen a large fall in capital asset values.



Various policy responses such as the Pandemic Unemployment Payment or the
Temporary Wage Subsidy will have mitigated some of the impact of job loss or wage
reduction, but not fully.
Agreements with banks in relation to mortgages, a freeze on evictions and supports for
childcare providers will improve the cash flow of households.
However, some households who have not lost their income will indirectly have received
a windfall gain in terms of an increase in purchasing power during the crisis as a result
of lower work-related costs or higher benefits than work income.

Ideally, in undertaking an analysis of these effects, we would use household survey data to
assess distributional impacts. However, there is a time lag between collection and release for
research and analysis. For example, the main survey used that contains the income situation of
households is the Survey of Income and Living Conditions. The most recent analysis
undertaken is for 2018. In normal times, a lot happens in a two-year period, but in a crisis the
changes are so significant that such a lag can mean the data is relatively meaningless.
There are more recent datasets available that can assist such as the Labour Force Survey, which
is available on a quarterly basis at a six-week lag or the Live Register data and Price data that
is available on a monthly basis on a short lag. However, these datasets do not contain income
information. In order to improve the targeting of policies with minimal cost we need to
understand in real-time how the shock affects the incomes of different types of households.
Nowcasting
From a methodological point of view, the key challenge is the lack of up to date information.
We propose to overcome this data gap by using a “nowcasting” methodology (O’Donoghue
and Loughrey, 2014) with recent data on employment and prices to calibrate a microsimulation
model of household incomes, taxes and benefits to produce a real-time picture of the population
and who is affected differentially (O’Donoghue, 2014; Atkinson et al, 2002).
Our paper goes beyond existing methods that apply price inflation factors, change
proportionally the employment rate in specific industries and apply tax-benefit transformations
to explain the policy consequences (Navicke et al., 2014). In periods of significant volatility
with large and rapid changes in the structure of the economy, such as during the COVID-19
crisis, it is more appropriate to utilise a dynamic-type income generation model approach to
update the data and to capture the heterogeneity of changes in the population (see Li and
O’Donoghue, 2014; Bourguignon et al., 2001). We follow a similar approach as studies looking
at the first 2 waves of COVID-19 (e.g. O’Donoghue et al. (2020), Sologon et al. (2020)). At
the core of our nowcasting approach, lies an income generation model, which consists of a
system of equations that describe the household market income distribution as a function of
personal and household attributes (Sologon et al. 2021). The parameters of the income
generation model are used to simulate counterfactual distributions of market incomes under
alternative scenarios5. In order to convert market incomes into disposable incomes, we utilize
the NUI Galway tax-benefit simulator (O’Donoghue et al, 2013).
This methodology was already used to understand the drivers of cross-national difference in
inequality in disposable income (Sologon et al. 2021) and the drivers of changes in disposable
income inequality (Sologon et al., 2019). In this paper, we use the infrastructure to update the

latest available survey data by calibrating the simulations to external macro controls to reflect
more timely Live Register, Price and Labour Force Survey data to undertake the COVID
distributional impact assessment.
To accommodate the nature of the shock and the multi-faceted impact on household living
standards, our core welfare variable of interest is an augmented definition disposable income
which accounts for work-related and housing costs. Following the standard definition,
disposable income, 𝑌𝐷,𝑡 , at time 𝑡 depends upon market income 𝑌𝑀,𝑡 , benefits 𝐵(𝑌𝑀,𝑡 , 𝑍𝑡 , 𝜃𝑡𝐵 )
and taxation 𝑇(𝑌𝑀,𝑡 , 𝑍𝑡 , 𝜃𝑡𝑇 ), which are in turn dependent upon personal skills, family
characteristics, Z, and tax-benefit parameters 𝜃. Our analysis adjusts disposable income for:

work-related expenditures 𝐶𝑡 :

housing costs 𝐻𝑡 :

capital losses 𝑄𝑡
𝑌𝐷,𝑡 = 𝑌𝑀,𝑡 − 𝑇(𝑌𝑀,𝑡 , 𝑍𝑡 , 𝜃𝑡𝑇 ) + 𝐵(𝑌𝑀,𝑡 , 𝑍𝑡 , 𝜃𝑡𝐵 ) − 𝐻𝑡 − 𝑄𝑡 − 𝐶𝑡 .
To some extent this turns the clock back to microsimulation analyses from the 1980’s where
disposable income net of housing costs were used occasionally (Atkinson et al., 1993;
Atkinson, 1995).
The nowcasting processes involves a number of components:

Estimation and simulation of a system of hierarchically structured, multiple equations ,
known as an income generation model that describe the presence (𝐼𝑖,𝑡 ) and level
(𝑌𝑖,𝑡 )of market incomes (Sologon et al. 2021)

Income indexation – the change in the level of income resulting from changes to
average wages 𝑌𝑖,𝑡 ()

The mechanism has at its core a generic household income-generation model (IGM) similar to
Sologon et al. (2021). The labour market module estimates the statistical distribution of labour
market factors: the probability to be at work, to earn income from salaried employment or selfemployment, the occupational, sector and industry, choices, the probability of being
unemployed, retired (if not working), the prevalence of income sources (investment income,
property income, private pension, other income), the probability of paying for housing (home
owner, mortgage, rent), the probability of paying contributions (private pensions), the
probability of having child care.
The market composition module involves two estimation techniques: (i) binary models for
binary outcomes, and (ii) multinomial models for m outcomes, 𝑚 > 2. In order to use the
estimated probabilities from logistic models within a Monte Carlo simulation, we draw a set of
random numbers such that we predict the actual dependent variable in the base year (see
Sologon et al. 2021 for the method). The disturbance terms are normally distributed, recovered
directly from the data for those with observed incomes, or generated stochastically for those
without a specific income source in the data.

6

At each step, we retrieve the parameters estimates and the individual specific errors for each
estimated model, to be subsequently used in simulating counterfactuals. We use the IGM to
simulate the impact of changing economic conditions over time. Bourguignon et al. (2002) and
Sologon et al. (2019) used a similar methodology to disentangle the impact of macro-economic
changes on inequality by generating counterfactual distribution - transformations of the income
generation process by ’swapping coefficients’ between years for the various transformations.
In nowcasting, the simulations involve calibrating econometrically estimated equations in the
income generation model to external control totals made available in more timely data than the
estimation data, only available at a lag. The calibration mechanism or alignment is drawn from
the dynamic microsimulation literature (Li and O’Donoghue, 2014) and aims to calibrate the
microsimulation model in order to match the simulated output to exogenous totals, particularly
in relation to the structure of the labour market (Baekgaard, 2002). In our model we utilise
three types of alignment for binary discrete data, discrete data with more than two choices and
continuous data, as discussed at length in O’Donoghue et al. (2020) .
For those with capital income, we assign the probability of holding shares across the ageincome distribution on the basis of Monte Carlo estimates using Iterative Proportional Fitting
(IPF) and we simulate an average change in the capital value or capital loss at the median (see
Table C1 in Appendix C).
For work-related expenditures, we model and simulate commuting costs and childcare costs.
For commuting costs, we first estimate the probability of commuting by car or by public
transport as a function of occupation, industry; education, location, and age group (see Table
A1 in Appendix A). Second, estimating models for both public transport and motor fuels as a
function of household characteristics, disposable income, social group and number of workers,
we predicted the proportional increase in these costs as a result of the number of workers in a
household relative to not working. Without modelling the commuting distance as a function of
income, which may have either a positive or a negative relationship, we assume a flat
commuting cost across households, adjusted for the age.
The distribution of childcare costs per week by family type and disposable income decile is
approximated using IPF. These averages are, in turn, used to calibrate the simulations based on
the estimated models for having childcare and level of childcare expenditure (integrated in
IGM, see Table B1 in Appendix B).
This allows us to “update” the microdata to the current period. We then use the infrastructure
by introducing various shocks (e.g. factoring sector specific impacts, differentiated by age,
macro changes, fiscal responses) and create counterfactual distributions.
The simulations involve two steps.

First, we nowcast the lastest available survey data to December 2019 (assuming no
COVID-19 crisis): 𝐷(𝑊𝑡+1 ).

Second, we assess the impact of COVID on the base 2020 income distribution by
comparing the counterfactual distribution 𝐷∗ (𝑊𝑡+1 (𝐿∗ )) under alternative shock
scenarios (corresponding to different waves) to the “original” nowcasted distribution:
𝐷(𝑊𝑡+1 ) − 𝐷∗ (𝑊𝑡+1 (𝐿∗ )).

3. Data and simulation assumptions
Data
As the main micro data source we use the 2017 version of the Survey on Income and Living
Conditions (SILC). The SILC is a dataset that has been collected in Ireland since 2003 and
which is used to form the Irish component of the European Union Statistics on Income and
Living Conditions (EU-SILC). This representative survey contains information on socioeconomic characteristics and incomes of households and living in them individuals, which is
used for the construction of poverty and inequality indicators at the level of European Union.
The Irish component is based on the information coming from two sources: a survey and
register data. Overall, 80% of the respondents granted the permission to use their national social
security numbers in order to access information on the benefit entitlement from administrative
data (Callan et al., 2010).
In the context of this paper, the main advantage of the SILC data contains a rich set of variables
needed for tax-benefit modelling. On the negative side, the dataset has a number of limitations,
which might be challenging for microsimulation modelling. These include time mismatch in
the measurement of income and personal characteristics, lack of information on some income
components (e.g. wealth or property values) or tax-deductible expenditures (e.g. medical
insurance), difficulties with attribution of some income variables to the appropriate unit of
analysis (capital income, rental income, private transfers are recorded at the household level
although they are often received by individuals), and aggregation of benefits. All these
limitations are discussed in detail in O’Donoghue et al. (2013), whose strategy to address them
we also follow in this paper.
Given that the 2017 SILC data contains income information, which refers to 2016, it cannot be
used directly for the evaluation of the distributional impacts of the COVID-19 crisis. In order
to account for the changes that elapsed between 2016 and 2020, we adjust the SILC data using
a set of calibration control totals capturing the change in macroeconomic situation in Ireland
over this period. This information is drawn from the Live-Register data and official statistics
provided by the Irish Central Statistics Office. In what follows, we describe in more detail all
the adjustments made to SILC data in order to make it timely appropriate for the analysis of
the COVID-19 impacts as well as policy measures introduced to cushion individual incomes.
Employment rate and sectoral impact
Individuals who lose their job as a result of the COVID-19 crisis are eligible for a COVID-19
Pandemic Unemployment Payment. This instrument is available to workers who have lost their
job on (or after) March 13. The payment is a flat rate non-means tested benefit, without
additional payments for dependents paid to those aged 18-66.
The payment structure has changed a number of times over the crisis. In the first incarnation,
at the start of the crisis on March 13 2020, it was at €203. This was increased in response to
social partnership negotiations in relation to matters such as the levying of childcare fees to
€350 per week on March 24 2020.
From June 29th, payments were partially linked to previous earnings, with the introduction of
several rates of payment: €300 per week for those with previous earnings of €300 or more, and
€300, €250 and €203 for those with earning falling in the ranges €300-€400, €200-€300 and
less than €200 respectively.
8

From September 17, there were two rates of payment: €203 for those earning less than €200
and €350 for all others.
From October 16 2020, there were three rates of payment: €350 per week for those with
previous earnings of €400 or more, and €250 and €203 respectively for those earning in the
ranges €200-€300 and less than €200.
From February 2021, there will be a reversion to two rates: €250 if earnings are over €300 and
€203 otherwise.
The numbers and type of individuals eligible for payment and directly affected by the crisis are
simulated using the income generation model. The overall employment rate is first used to
calibrate the income generation model. This is characterised by the number of people in work
relative to the population of a particular age group. The Labour Force Survey (LFS) collects
data on this topic. However, as a quarterly survey, even with a relatively quick turn-around
time from collection to publication, there is typically a 2-3 month lag between data collection
and publication. In real time modelling within a period of economic volatility such as the
COVID-19 crisis data that is closer to the period of the crisis is required.
The impact of the crisis is not a general demand shock, but a highly asymmetric change in
employment, with “essential” industries remaining at work and some sectors such as the public
sector remaining on full pay, while other industries are experiencing almost a full shut down
over the period of the virus. There is relatively limited data in real time as to the sectoral impact
of the crisis. The most suitable data to perform such calculations is the Administrative Data
that is available on a monthly basis, typically 2-3 days after the end of the month, together with
weekly updates in relation to aggregates that have been made. As is well documented, LiveRegister data does not capture the level of unemployment equivalent to ILO measures. People
can be working part-time whilst in receipt of benefits and conversely, someone can be out of
work and seeking work, but not eligible for unemployment benefits. However, as an indicator
in the short term, of a change in economic circumstances, the changes observed in the live
register are an approximate indicator of changes in the numbers out of work (or nonemployment rate). In this paper, the LFS is used to nowcast to December 2019, with the
Administrative Data used to nowcast to May, June, August and November 2020.
Taking the change in the receipt of the pandemic unemployment benefit at the end of March
2020, we model the change in the employment rate at these 4 different points, reflecting both
changes in the design of the instrument and reflecting different stages of the crisis. Table 1
outlines the assumed change in employment by sector, consistent with the overall change in
live-register numbers as a result of COVID-19. We apply age specific changes identified in the
Live Register and expressed as a proportion of the population in the SILC.
COVID-19 Cases
Individuals who have to stop working due to the COVID-19 infection or due to having been in
a close contact with someone who contracted the disease are eligible for the COVID enhanced
Illness Benefit (CEIB). The benefit is paid at the same rate as the PUP.
Both workers and non-workers get sick as a result of COVID-19. Table 2 outlines our random
allocation of cases across in-work and out-of-work, within the national age distribution of the
COVID-19 cases. Dividing by the proportion of workers in each age group, we derive the
recipient rate of the COVID-19 related illness benefit.

Mortgage Interest
Individuals who have to endure mortgage repayments received a possibility to freeze up to 3
months of such repayments during the COVID-19 crisis. This resulted in 28000 applications
for mortgage deferrals in March 2020 with the numbers going steadily up in subsequent
months. As of July, 160000 deferrals had been made (see Table 3).

Work Related Expenditures
Due to intensified work from home and business closures, the size of work-related expenses,
such as commuting costs and childcare costs, decreased substantially for most workers. In order
to account for the reductions in these expenses we use the Household Budget Survey data from
2016 to simulate the amount of commuting costs typically incurred by an average worker
(Table 4). It should be noted that those who do not work also have transport costs for other
purposes. While the actual cost of commuting for work may be higher, it is assumed that there
would be some substitution if an individual was not working.

Following the outbreak of the pandemics, the State took a decision to support childcare
providers in order to maintain the sustainability of the childcare sector and relieve parents from
childcare payments while keeping childcare places. 6 Utilising IPF to data collected within the
Household Budget Survey, we derive the distribution of childcare costs per week by family
type and disposable income decile (Table 5). These averages are simulated across households
in the sample on the basis of the regressions outlined in Table C.1 in Appendix C.

It is assumed in the simulations that those who receive Pandemic Payments or those who are
non-essential workers working from home do not incur commuting costs or childcare expenses.
Pandemic Wage Subsidy
On March 24 2020 the State introduced a COVID-19 Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme to
ensure that employers would keep their employees even if the revenues go down. In order to
be eligible for the scheme businesses would need to have a minimum of 25% decline in
turnover. For the initial period between March 13 and March 24, the scheme was a flat rate
payment of €203. From March 26 to April 20, it was redesigned to cover up to 70% of an
employee’s net earnings. The payment was limited, however, depending on the employee's
average take home pay:

Average pay from €0 to €586 limits it to €410;

Average pay from €586 to €960 limits it to €350;

Average pay above €960 is not entitled to the subsidy.
On April 20th, the rates of temporary wage subsidy were changed as follows:

70% to 85% for employees with a previous average take home pay below €412 per
week

€350 per week for employees with a previous average take home pay between €412 and
€500 per week

The subsidy remained the same for employees with a previous average take home pay
of between €500 and €586 per week

A tiered system has been introduced for employees with a previous average take home
pay of over €586 per week

Employees who were taking home more than €960 per week would be able to avail of
the scheme, with tapers depending upon the proportion paid by the employer.
From the 1st of September 2021, the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme was replaced by the
Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme, where employers and new firms in sectors impacted by
COVID-19 whose turnover has fallen 30% get a flat-rate subsidy per week.

The Wage Subsidy itself has a limited distributional impact but it shifts the burden of payments
from the private sector to the public sector. This subsidy also does not take into account the
impact of wage reductions where employers did not have the cash flow to make these payments
as in the case of individuals whose take-home pay exceeds the wage subsidy limit. Prior to the
introduction of the subsidy scheme there had been pay reductions for staff in certain sectors
most affected by the crisis, where staff were not made redundant, such as the airline sector. For
example, the two main airlines (Ryanair and Aer Lingus) halved the pay of staff when flights
were grounded.7
Stock Market
The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemics lead to a fall in stock markets. Only between
January 1 and April 1 2020 the Irish index ISEQ fell by 32% which had a further impact on the
financial situation of households holding shares. Using data from the Household Finance and
Consumption Survey in 2018, Table 6 reports how the holding of shares is spread along the
distributions of household income and age. It shows that individuals located in the top quantile
of the household income distribution are 8 times more likely to have financial assets than those
located in the bottom quantile of the distribution, with the values of assets being 9 times higher.
The distribution of financial assets across the age distribution is not as extreme, with those aged
40-79 more likely than other age groups to hold shares.
The data equivalent to Table 7, with change in share values by age and income group, was not
available during the analysis of this paper. In order to utilise this information in a
microsimulation model, Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF) was used to create an
approximation of the share value holdings across the age- income distribution. The average
share holding and the median value of holdings were generated separately and then multiplied
to get the average value per person in the cell (see Appendix D). Applying the ISEQ index to
January 1 2020 and then to April 1, 2020, Table 7 models the net change in the value of shares

4. Results
Average and Distributional Analysis
Table 8 reports the trend in average equivalised incomes using three definitions:

Market Income

Disposable Income

Adjusted Disposable Income
Market income, unsurprisingly, fell over the course of the crisis. The decline was the most
drastic in the first wave (around 32 percent) with a slight recovery taking place in June and
August. However, the onset of the second wave in November saw a reduction in market
incomes again, albeit to a much lower degree than in May, reflecting the fact that the
restrictions were not as great. The end of the second wave at Christmas, saw a slight
improvement, albeit not to the same degree as in the summer, before worsening again after
Christmas in the 3rd wave. However, sectors affected in the second wave were more likely to
be concentrated at the bottom of the distribution than at the top in the second and third wave,
rather than the first wave.
The drop in market incomes was partially compensated by the increase in benefit payments,
which can be seen from the trends in disposable incomes. The average size of disposable
14

income decreased by almost 10 percent at the start of the crisis, before making a slight recovery
later on. Nevertheless, it remained 6-7% below the pre-crisis level during the second and third
waves of the pandemic.
As mentioned above, the onset of the COVID-19 crisis has pushed a substantial share of
employees to work from home or to take up temporary unemployment. This led to a decrease
in commuting costs and childcare expenses. In addition, some individuals applied for mortgage
deferrals, which further reduced their current expenditures. All these expenses are captured
with the adjusted disposable income, which remained largely unchanged over the course of the
crisis.

Hidden below these averages are quite a differential impact on different parts of the income
distribution. Figure 3 summarizes the distribution of market (Panel A), disposable (Panel B)
and adjusted disposable (Panel C) incomes before the crisis and at various points during the
crisis calculated per adult equivalent. Deciles are calculated based upon adjusted disposable
income decile, adjusted for work, housing expenses and capital losses.
In terms of market income, the decline was larger at the top than at the bottom of the
distribution, however proportionally the loss at the top was slightly less than the bottom.
Disposable incomes at the bottom of the distribution were largely maintained over the three
waves and even higher in some cases where benefits were higher than pre-crisis market income.
The gradual targeting of payments in later waves reduced the incidence of those at the bottom
of the income distribution with disposable incomes that were higher than at the pre-crisis level.
Disposable incomes at the top of the distribution fell by 10-20% at the start of the crisis, and
recovered to about 10% in later waves.
Panel C in Figure 3 suggests that adjusted household equivalized disposable incomes were
somewhat cushioned during the crisis, which held them from the same decline as we observe
in market incomes. Furthermore, there was even a rise in adjusted equivalised disposable
incomes amongst lower deciles in the first and second waves. This reflects both the generosity
of the instruments and the fact that the squeezed middle, who are at the bottom of the
distribution have normally both low incomes and high fixed costs of working and housing. This
progressivity was visible for all periods. However, we see that the differential proportional
change between the top and the bottom of the distribution has shrunk in the second and third
wave as a result of the increased targeting of benefits that occurred later on.

Inequality and Redistribution
Table 9 summarizes changes in inequality of different types of incomes during six time points
over the crisis as compared to the pre-crisis period. It shows that inequality in market income
increased by 0.12 points at the start of the crisis, declining gradually as the economy reopened
and then increased again as the country went into the second and third waves. In contrast,
inequality in gross income, disposable income, and especially adjusted disposable income
decreased throughout the crisis. The largest declines were observed at the pick of the first and
second waves following the strengthening of the lockdown measures, activation of COVID-19
related benefit payments, and decreases in work-related expenses.
Table 10 reports the redistributive impact of public policy. The contribution of benefits to
redistribution is derived as the difference in the Gini coefficients calculated for gross and
market incomes. The contribution of taxes to redistribution is derived as the difference in the
Gini coefficients calculated for disposable and gross incomes. The contribution of work-related
and housing costs to redistribution is derived as the difference in the Gini coefficients for
disposable income adjusted for work-related and housing expenditures and disposable income
without these adjustments. Out of three policy instruments, the redistributive role of benefits
increased the most over the course of the crisis. It was the highest at the pick of the first wave
and slightly declined afterwards remaining, nevertheless, much higher than in the pre-crisis
period. In contrast, the redistributive role of taxes and work-related expenses remained
relatively stable during the first three waves of the COVID-19 crisis. In general, taxes help to
decrease inequality in incomes whereas the opposite applies to work-related expenses.

5. Discussion and conclusions
This paper uses a microsimulation framework to undertake an analysis of the distributional
implications of the COVID crisis. Given the lack of real-time data during the fast moving crisis,
it applies a nowcasting methodology in combination with real-time aggregate administrative
data to calibrate an income survey and to simulate changes in the tax benefit system that
attempted to mitigate the impacts of the crisis. The paper builds upon earlier work that was
undertaken at an early phase of the crisis and assesses the impact over three waves of the
COVID-19 crisis. It also describes in detail the methodology used to derive an adjusted
disposable income measures, accounting for the impact of non-discretionary expenditures.
Our analysis shows that, despite the increase in market income inequality, inequality in
disposable incomes decreased, mainly due to the combination of crisis-induced discretionary
policy measures with existing system of taxes and benefits. The decrease in disposable income
inequality was the largest during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic but became
somewhat smaller afterwards following a reduction in the generosity of benefits as they became
more targeted.

18

The paper also demonstrates how an approach that combines microsimulation and nowcasting
can provide policy makers with real-time data needed for elaboration of timely policy
interventions as crisis unfolds in the situation when survey data comes with time lags. Needless
to say, the application of this methodology requires a number of assumptions. However, with
careful sensitivity analysis, the model provides a flexible tool to policy designers to explore
the implications of alternative assumptions in addition to alternative policies.
On a methodological level, our paper makes a specific contribution in relation to the choice of
welfare measure in assessing the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on inequality. As the impact
is multi-faceted involving market income, public policy and changes in fixed costs of work and
housing, we adopt a novel measure adjusting equivalised household disposable income to
account for changes in housing, child care and commuting costs and reflects impacts of changes
in capital values. The modelling approach illustrated in this paper can inform the trade-offs
between measures – e.g. attenuating the rise in inequality or poverty while limiting the fiscal
costs – that are inherent in the policy-design challenge.
