Abstract
The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has been accompanied by a bulk of scientific research and
related Twitter discussions. To unravel the public concerns about the COVID-19 crisis reflected in the
science-based Twitter conversations, this study tracked the Twitter attention around the COVID-19
research efforts during the first three months of 2020. On the basis of nearly 1.4 million Twitter mentions
of 6,162 COVID-19-related scientific publications, we investigated the temporal tweeting dynamic and
the Twitter users involved in the online discussions around COVID-19-related research. The results
show that the quantity of Twitter mentions of COVID-19-related publications was on rising. Scholarlyoriented Twitter users played an influential role in disseminating research outputs on COVID-19, with
their tweets being frequently retweeted. Over time, a change in the focus of the Twitter discussions can
be observed, from the initial attention to virological and clinical research to more practical topics, such
as the potential treatments, the countermeasures by the governments, the healthcare measures, and the
influences on the economy and society, in more recent times.

Introduction
The global spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, an infectious disease caused by the pathogen severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has already unleashed an unprecedented
impact on public health, economy, and human society worldwide (McKee & Stuckler, 2020). As of June
2, 2020, it is reported by the World Health Organization (WHO) that there have been over 6.1 million
confirmed cases of COVID-19 globally, carrying a mortality of approximately 6%.1 On January 30,
2020, the WHO officially declared that the COVID-19 outbreak constitutes a Public Health Emergency

of International Concern (PHEIC),2 making it become the sixth PHEIC in the 21st century after the 2009
H1N1 pandemic, the 2014 Polio declaration, the 2014 Ebola virus disease (West Africa), the 2016 Zika
virus epidemic, and the 2018 Ebola virus disease (Kivu) (Harmer et al., 2020).
In response to this ongoing public health emergency, scientists around the world have been contributing
their expertise to the understanding and potential treatments of the novel coronavirus disease, leading to
an explosion of research outputs covering a range of subject fields (Callaway et al., 2020). The strong
concerns about this public health crisis arose within not only the scientific community but also the social
media landscape. Millions of people are talking about the coronavirus on social media (Yammine, 2020),
particularly on Twitter, where there are massive conversations around a variety of topics related to
COVID-19 (Chen et al., 2020; Thelwall & Thelwall, 2020). Amongst these conversations, up-to-date
research progress made by scientists is one of the most important elements, reflecting the Twitter
attention paid toward scientific discoveries in fighting the pandemic. Against this background, through
the lens of scholarly Twitter metrics, which focus on the recorded events of acts on Twitter related to
scholarly documents or scholarly agents (Haustein, 2019), this study aims to disclose the focus and
dynamic of public concerns about relevant research efforts during the time of PHEIC, specifically, in
the case of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Twitter attention toward scientific research
As one of the most prevalent social media platforms, the role that Twitter plays in scholarly
communication has been widely investigated in previous studies (Sugimoto et al., 2017). On the whole,
Twitter mention data outperform most other altmetric indicators in terms of not only the data coverage
but also the accumulation speed after publication (Costas et al., 2015; Fang & Costas, 2020; Haustein
et al., 2015), making it possible to measure the Twitter reception of research outputs in a relatively short
period of time.
Considering the above advantages, the potential of Twitter metrics in research evaluation has already
been discussed from both conceptual and practical perspectives (Wouters et al., 2019). Moreover,
captured Twitter attention toward scientific publications has been analyzed for identifying the focus of
interest of Twitter users on some specific subject fields or research topics. For example, RobinsonGarcia et al. (2019) mapped Twitter attention distributing within the field of Microbiology and found
that topics about translational medicine, future prospects and challenges, and bacterial outbreaks are
prominent with regard to their Twitter mentions received. Haunschild et al. (2019) made comparisons
for a set of climate change publications among the networks created based on the author keywords and
the tweet hashtags, finding that most tweeted research topics are those about the consequences of climate
change for humans. Taking the area of Big Data as a case study, Lyu and Costas (2020) observed that
hashtags embedded in the Twitter mentions of big data research are mainly about technologies, showing
a similar technical orientation as author keywords in publications. These existing studies indicate that
detected Twitter attention toward scientific research opens a window for tracking broader public
concerns beyond academia about specific topics. The study of Twitter activities around scholarly outputs
can be used to analyze broader perspectives on science-society interactions in what has been labeled as
“heterogeneous couplings” (Costas et al., 2017), these being relevant to characterize and study how in
a pandemic scientific results are being received and communicated among very diverse audiences.
Scientometric perspectives on COVID-19-related research
The outbreak of COVID-19 is not merely an urgent threat to global health, but also a significant
challenge to the current scientific system. On the one hand, being confronted with such emergency,
deficiencies existing in the scholarly communication system have further been proven to be obstacles in
the way to a more open and efficient scholarly environment (Larivière et al., 2020). On the other hand,
the transformation from the traditional status of journals to faster online publishing channels has been

facilitating the explosion of COVID-19-related scientific literature, resulting in an over-abundance of
scientific information (Brainard, 2020; Torres-Salinas et al., 2020).
To delineate the massive research progress, there are a range of studies investigating COVID-19-related
literature from several scientometric perspectives, such as the coverage of publications in diverse
scholarly databases (Kousha & Thelwall, 2020), the identification of hot topics (Haghani et al., 2020),
the international collaboration patterns, and the funding sources (Fry et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020),
etc. Amongst these existing studies, some of them have a focus on the social media performance of
COVID-19-related publications. For instance, Colavizza et al. (2020) took relatively exhaustive
investigations to the CORD-19 database, namely, the COVID-19 Open Research Database which
captures global research on COVID-19 and coronavirus family of viruses (Wang et al., 2020), and
concluded that the CORD-19 database covers a wide range of research on viruses in general but not only
on COVID-19 and coronavirus. In particular, they found that CORD-19 publications published in 2020,
especially those on topics of pressing relevance, are disproportionately popular on social media. TorresSalinas et al. (2020) focused on the uptake of open access on COVID-19-related literature and found
that nearly 67.5% of publications in their dataset are openly accessible, moreover, they confirmed the
advantage of open access publications in obtaining social media attention over non open access
publications. Based on the relationships between early citations (in the database Dimensions.ai) and
social media mentions, Kousha and Thelwall (2020) observed a high degree of convergence between
COVID-19-related publications shared in the social web and citation counts, suggesting that altmetrics,
Twitter counts in particular, might be helpful for quickly filtering useful new documents from the daily
flood of COVID-19-related literature.
Objectives
Taken together, although the coverage and performance of COVID-19-related publications in social
media have been analyzed in many existing studies with diverse data sources. In contrast, there are less
explorations into what and how the public discuss about COVID-19-related research progress on social
media. In response, focusing on the Twitter attention toward COVID-19-related research during the time
of PHEIC, the main objectives of this study are two-fold: the first one is to unravel the tweeting patterns
around COVID-19-related research from the perspectives of the temporal accumulation and engaging
Twitter users; and the second one is to trace the evolution of the focus of the Twitter discussions around
COVID-19-related research over time. We addressed the following specific research questions:
RQ1. How are the COVID-19-related scientific publications mentioned on Twitter over time since the
outbreak?
RQ2. By drawing on the Twitter users’ profile descriptions, who are the actors tweeting COVID-19related research? What kinds of Twitter users are more influential in terms of being retweeted?
RQ3. Based on the titles, what are the main research topics of COVID-19-related publications? Which
research topics attract higher levels of Twitter attention?
RQ4. On the basis of the full tweet texts and hashtags, what are the topics raised by the Twitter users
when discussing the COVID-19-related publications? How does the focus of interest of their Twitter
discussions change over time?

Data and methods
Dataset of COVID-19-related publications
Ever since the outbreak of COVID-19, an increasing number of academic publishers and organizations
have been gathering and compiling global relevant research and making them open access for the sake
of public concerns. Our meta-dataset stemmed from two databases: one is the database of COVID-19-

related publications established and updated by the WHO,3 the other one is the file made available by
Dimensions.ai, which contains all COVID-19-related published articles, preprints, datasets and clinical
trials from Dimensions.ai. 4 On April 4, 2020, a total of 8,163 distinct scientific publications were
extracted from these two data sources, consisting of 3,478 publications tracked by the WHO and 6,338
publications provided by Dimensions.ai (1,653 publications are overlapped).
The bibliometric information of the above set of publications were retrieved through the Dimensions.ai
API on April 4, 2020 as well. On the whole, 6,582 of them (accounting for 80.6%) are indexed by
Dimensions.ai with the DOI or PubMed ID matched. Since we focus on the research efforts occurred in
the first three months of 2020 (from January 1, 2020 to March 31, 2020), publications published beyond
this time window were filtered out. In this study, DOI created date, namely, the date on which a DOI
was created, was collected through the Crossref API to serve as the more precise proxy of publication
date (Fang & Costas, 2018). While the DOI created date is unavailable, publication date recorded by
Dimensions.ai was used as the alternative.5 Based on the publication date, a total of 6,162 publications
were selected as the final dataset.
Twitter mention data of COVID-19-related publications
In order to track Twitter attention toward COVID-19-related publications, Twitter mention data of
selected publications recorded by Altmetric.com were queried through the API between April 4 and
April 7, 2020. Based on the list of tweet IDs responded by the Altmetric.com API, we further collected
detailed Twitter mention information with the Twitter API on April 7, 2020. Finally, after excluding
unavailable Twitter mentions caused by the deletion of tweets and the suspension or protection of
Twitter accounts (Fang et al., 2020), a total of 4,195 publications (accounting for 68.1%) were found to
have some Twitter mention data accrued in the same time window as the publication date of selected
publications, involving with 1,374,231 distinct tweets posted by 655,494 unique Twitter users.
On the basis of tweet objects information responded by the Twitter API, 6 specifically the retweeted,
replied, and quoted relationships of each tweet, Twitter mentions were classified into two main
categories: original tweet (including regular original tweet and reply tweet) and retweet (including
simple retweet and quote tweet). Table 1 lists the concepts of these types of tweets, together with their
presence in our dataset. Simple retweets contribute most of the Twitter mentions of COVID-19-related
publications, accounting for 76.1%. Note that in this study, “original tweet” and “retweet” refer to the
two main categories. Since except for simple retweet, the other three sub-categories contain original
contents from the Twitter users, “tweets with original contents” analyzed in the text analysis parts of
this study considered regular original tweets, reply tweets, and quote tweets.

Note: Table 1 only briefly introduces the methods of generating different types of tweets by manual operation on Twitter. It
should be noted that tweets can be created programmatically by APIs as well. See more introduction to the concepts and
methods of generating different categories of tweets at: https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter. (Accessed 2020-05-20).
Moreover, because one can reply to a tweet with quoting other tweets in the reply tweet, it is possible for a tweet to be classified
as a reply tweet and a quote tweet at the same time. Note that in this study, to avoid the overlap in the calculation of numbers
of this kind of tweets with dual sub-categories, they were only counted as reply tweets because the following quoting behavior
is resulted by the replying action happened at first.

In addition to the category assigned, detailed information responded by the Twitter API were also
appended to each tweet for further analysis, including the full tweet text, the post date (i.e., the date on
which the tweet was posted), the hashtags used, the number of retweets received, and the language of
tweet text, etc., as well as the information of Twitter users, such as the profile descriptions.
Analytical approaches
To show overall pictures of the COVID-19 dataset and the Twitter discussions around them, VOSviewer
(van Eck & Waltman, 2010) was utilized as the visualization tool for text mining and constructing cooccurrence networks of terms extracted from the titles of publications, the descriptions of Twitter users,
and the tweet texts, respectively, as well as for creating hashtag coupling7 networks. Besides, the socalled overlay visualization of VOSviewer was employed to exhibit additional information on top of the
generated base maps, such as the average number of Twitter mentions received by terms, the average
number of retweets received by Twitter users, and the post date of Twitter mentions and their appendant
hashtags.
For measuring how recently the terms and hashtags in Twitter mentions were posted by users, the post
month and post day of tweets were used to create the post date score, with post month serving as the
integer part and post day the decimal part (e.g., the post date score of a tweet posted on February 1 is
2.01). The higher the post date score, the more recently the tweet was posted. The post date score of
each tweet was also applied to its used terms and hashtags.
In order to examine the extent to which the tweet texts are different from the corresponding titles of
publications, we cleaned the full texts of tweets with original contents in English at first by removing
the embedded URLs, handle names of mentioned Twitter users and the @-sign, as well as the #-sign of
hashtags. The texts of hashtags were kept because they often contain specific meaning. In this study the
text similarity between titles of publications and related cleaned tweet texts was measured by cosine

coupling relationship between these two hashtags (Costas et al., 2017).

similarity score. Cosine similarity scores were calculated for each pair of texts by using the Python
scikit-learn package (Pedregosa et al., 2011). The higher the cosine similarity score, the more similar
the two pieces of texts.
It should be noted that in the analyses involved with full tweet texts, we only took into consideration the
209,003 tweets with original contents in English language, which account for the majority (about 63.7%)
in the sub-categories of all tweets with original contents (as depicted in Table 1). Tweet texts in other
languages were not included in the text analysis part in this study.

Results
Coinciding with the four proposed research questions, this section characterizes the Twitter attention
toward COVID-19-related research from four perspectives. The first one studies the temporal
accumulation patterns of tweets mentioning COVID-19-related research over time, with a focus on the
top-10 most tweeted publications. The second perspective shows the profile characteristics of Twitter
users who have participated in sharing COVID-19-related research to the Twitter landscape. The third
perspective presents an overall picture of research topics of COVID-19-related publications, and
identifies those with higher levels of Twitter attention received. The last perspective analyzes the
discussions around COVID-19-related research on Twitter based on both full tweet texts and hashtags
used, to disclose Twitter users’ focus of interest and its evolution over time.
Exploring the temporal distribution of Twitter mentions of COVID-19-related research
Since the reported outbreak of COVID-19, scientists from around the world have made remarkable
contributions to the understanding of this novel infectious disease, which is represented by the increasing
number of related publications. As shown in Figure 1(a), the quantity of COVID-19-related publications
presents a rising tendency in the first three months of 2020, particularly in late March. Around 68.1%
of COVID-19-related publications in our dataset have been mentioned by Twitter users at least once.
Figure 1(b) shows the temporal distribution of the Twitter mentions. It is obvious that intensive Twitter
attention toward COVID-19-related research started to rise on January 21, 2020, and reached the first
peak on January 25, following the Wuhan city’s lockdown on January 23. In February when the outbreak
was temporarily confined to China, Twitter attention toward COVID-19-related research maintained a
relatively stable state. However, along with the global outbreak in full swing and the mounting research
outputs in March, Twitter attention steeply increased, especially after March 15 when the global
confirmed cases outside of China exceeded those reported in China for the first time.

To provide a more detailed analysis about how COVID-19-related publications were shared and
discussed after they have been published, we selected the top-10 most tweeted publications from the
dataset as a case study. Table 2 lists the information of these ten publications ranked by their number of
Twitter mentions accrued. The publication entitled “The proximal origin of SARS-CoV-2”, whose main
conclusion is that SARS-COV-2 is not a purposefully manipulated virus from laboratories (Andersen et
al., 2020), attracted the most attention on Twitter in our observation time window, followed by research
related to clinical treatments, public health countermeasures, clinical characteristics, and transmissibility
of the virus, etc.

The Twitter mentions of the top-10 publications were depicted in Figure 2 based on their post date.
Twitter mentions of different publications are highlighted by different colors in each bar according to
their proportion in total Twitter mentions posted in that day. The publication date of each publication is
annotated on the top of the corresponding bar, to show how fast the Twitter attention was accumulated
after they were published. In general, Twitter attention toward a specific highly tweeted publication
concentrated within the first few days after its publication. For example, publication #4, as a preprint
ranking in the top ten which has been withdrawn by the authors, attracted a high level of Twitter attention
in the very early stage of the coronavirus crisis compared to other publications. Most of the Twitter
mentions of publication #4 occurred in the first two days after its publication. Similar patterns can be
observed for most other highly tweeted publications. Moreover, due to the existence of advanced online
version, some publications have already accumulated a certain amount of Twitter attention before their
publication date recorded (e.g., publication #9 and #10). In a word, in the case of the top-10 most tweeted
publications, Twitter users were following COVID-19-related research in next to no time since their
appearance, besides, the Twitter attention concentrated in the first few days and then gradually faded
away. This finding is in line with what has been observed in a previous study based on a more
generalized dataset (Shuai et al., 2012), in which Twitter mentions were also found to have relatively
short delays and narrow time spans.

Figure 2. Distribution of tweets of the top-10 most tweeted publications posted in different date.

Characterizing the Twitter users sharing COVID-19-related research
In our dataset, there are 161,390 unique users who have posted at least one tweet with original contents
about COVID-19-related publications, by whom the research outputs were initially brought into the
Twitter landscape. To reveal the characteristics of the users, by drawing on their profile descriptions
written in English, Figure 3(a) illustrates the co-occurrence network of terms that users used to describe
themselves. Size of nodes is proportional to their frequency of occurrence. For clear visualization, the
269 most relevant terms were kept, thereby algorithmically generating four clusters. Cluster #1 (red
cluster) mainly contains terms that belong to personal description about the private and personal life,
like “husband”, “father”, and “mom”, etc. Cluster #2 (blue cluster) is formed by terms implying users’
interest and faith, like “music”, “dog”, and “Christian”, etc. Cluster #3 (green cluster) is comprised by
terms referring to academic role in the scientific community, such as “professor”. “PhD student”, and
“university”, etc. At last, cluster #4 (yellow cluster) includes terms that express users’ attitude and
position on Twitter, like “endorsement”, “like”, and “retweet”, etc. In general, the clustering is consistent
to a large extent with the main textual patterns of Twitter users’ descriptions found in the study
conducted by Díaz-Faes et al. (2019), which is based on a more universal dataset consisting of a random
sample of 200,000 Twitter users who have ever tweeted at least one scholarly output. According to their
results, terms extracted from profile descriptions are clustered into four communities as well, including
personal description, academic role, business and practice role, and attitude and position. The difference
of involved Twitter users between the universal situation and the COVID-19 case is that users with
business and practical roles are less active, while those highlighting their interest and faith and academic
roles become more predominant in the case of COVID-19, indicating that research progress taken place
on COVID-19 might attracted a higher proportion of general users and scientific researchers.
After summing up the number of retweets received by all tweets with original contents, each Twitter
user considered in Figure 3(a) were assigned with their own total number of obtained retweets. As a
result, in Figure 3(b) terms were scored by the average number of retweets that Twitter users have
received. Terms related to academic roles have predominately higher retweet scores, suggesting that
Twitter users describing themselves with academic roles are more likely to get retweeted in the case of
COVID-19, especially for senior researchers and users from the biomedical and health sciences-related
fields such as epidemiology, immunology, and cardiology. Therefore, during the COVID-19 crisis,
scholarly-oriented Twitter users with expertise seem to be playing an influential role in updating and
disseminating science-based information on Twitter.

Identifying topics of COVID-19-related research mentioned on Twitter
In order to show an overview of the research topics that authors focused on, Figure 4(a) presents the cooccurrence network of terms used in the titles of 6,162 COVID-19-related publications. Size of nodes
is determined by their frequency of being used. For the sake of clear visualization, we exhibited the 145
most relevant terms, which are aggregated into three clusters. The three clusters generated correspond
to three main research directions on COVID-19: cluster #1 (blue cluster) includes terms related to
epidemiological research, with special attention to the coronavirus pandemic in different countries and
their countermeasures; cluster #2 (red cluster) mainly focuses on virological research, especially for the
protein structure of the virus and its proximal origin; and cluster #3 (green cluster) is comprised of terms
10

about clinical research, and in this direction, most terms are associate with clinical characteristics and
coronavirus infection.

Figure 4. (a) Co-occurrence network of terms used in the titles of COVID-19-related publications. (b)
Overlay visualization of terms scored by their average number of Twitter mentions received.

On the basis of the total number of Twitter mentions that each publication has accumulated, terms were
scored by the average number of Twitter mentions accrued, as shown in Figure 4(b). As to each research
direction, there exist some research topics with relatively intensive Twitter attention. For example, in
the field of epidemiology, the actions taken by the governments against the coronavirus pandemic, which
have made a significant impact on people’s daily lives, are of interest to Twitter users, like “quarantine”
and “lockdown”. In the field of virology, Twitter users paid quite a lot of attention to the exploration of
the animal source of the novel virus as scientists did (Mallapaty, 2020), making “origin” and related
genomic structure terms the most tweeted topics in this field. In addition, “chloroquine” and
“hydroxychloroquine”, the two widely-used anti-malarial drugs, attracted a great deal of attention as
well, because of their controversial reported efficacy and safety in inhibiting the novel coronavirus in
11

vitro and in different clinical trials (Gautret et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020; Molina et al., 2020; Wang et
al., 2020). However, on the whole, topics in clinical research got higher levels of Twitter attention. As
the topics directly related to the severity of the pandemic and the health of humans, “clinical
characteristics”, “mortality”, “ncov infection”, “risk factor”, and some other research topics have been
of great concern by the public.
While sharing COVID-19-related research on Twitter, users might express their own opinions on or
beyond the tweeted research. To quantitatively reflect the extent to which science-based Twitter
conversations are different from the titles of publications, Figure 5 shows the results of the calculation
of cosine similarity scores between publication titles and related full tweet texts. There are around 45.3%
of tweets with original contents added showing a big dissimilarity with the mentioned publications’
titles, with the cosine similarity scores falling between 0 and 0.1. Over 74% of Twitter mentions have
the values of similarity lower than 0.5, implying that most Twitter users conducted some commenting
rather than just repeating the titles of the publications. This finding is further confirmed by the gap
between the average length of full tweet texts and that of publication titles in each statistical bin of
similarity scores. Most Twitter mentions are formed by longer texts than titles, indicating the extension
of contents made by Twitter users while sharing scientific information. Different from the devoid of
original thought of tweet contents observed in previous studies based on the samples from the fields of
dentistry and big data (Lyu & Costas, 2020; Robinson-Garcia et al., 2017), during the COVID-19 crisis,
Twitter users were more inclined to set forth their original opinions and attitudes when tweeting about
recent scientific outcomes.

the titles of publications and tweet texts, as well as the average length of publication titles and tweet
texts in each statistical bin.

Tracking the Twitter discussions around COVID-19-related research over time
Given that Twitter users generally enlarged the contents of their tweets beyond the publication titles, in
this part we further explored what they talked about around COVID-19-related research and how the
focus of their discussions changed over time. Figure 6(a) shows the co-occurrence network of terms
used in the tweets with original contents in English. Size of nodes is proportional to the occurrence
12

frequency of each term. As the corpus of full tweet texts is much larger than that of publication titles,
we kept more terms in the map to present a relatively complete landscape of science-based Twitter
conversations. The 601 most relevant terms were retained for clear visualization, thus generating five
clusters of the main topics in the Twitter discussions related to COVID-19-related research.

Figure 6. (a) Co-occurrence network of terms used in the tweets with original contents in English; (b)
Overlay visualization of terms scored by the average post date of tweets in which they are mentioned.

Terms in cluster #1 (red cluster) reveal the public concerns about the clinical characteristics and
transmission risks of the infectious disease caused by the virus. Besides some specific symptoms (e.g.,
13

“fever” and “cough”) and the “mortality”, the risk of being infected was also seriously concerned for
different age groups, particularly for “child/kid”. These terms were frequently occurred with “Wuhan”,
the initial city struggled with the novel coronavirus. Terms in cluster #2 (yellow cluster) reflect the
discussions about clinical trials and potential treatments that have been conducted to treat or prevent
COVID-19, including some general terms like “treatment”, “trial”, and “drug”, etc., as well as more
specific therapies like “chloroquine” and “hydroxychloroquine”, the two controversial drugs as
aforementioned which have caused a wave of misinformation due to the unproven effectiveness in
treating COVID-19 (Erku et al., 2020). As the basis of knowing more details of the causative coronavirus,
terms about its genomic structure and probable origins were also frequently mentioned by Twitter users
in cluster #3 (blue cluster), including not only the jargons of genomics (e.g., “receptor” and “ACE2”)
but also the comparisons of similarity with other viruses like “HIV”, based on which Twitter users
discussed about several animal sources supposed to be the probable origins of the coronavirus in the
nature. Cluster #4 (purple cluster) includes a sequence of terms about the virus persistence under
different circumstances, especially on various surfaces (e.g., “cardboard”, “plastic”, and “copper”) and
in “high temperature” and “high humidity”. Last but not least, terms related to the governmental
measures and social responses constitute cluster #5 (green cluster), which contains a range of topics
reflecting the tremendous influences that COVID-19 have exerted on human society, such as the
countermeasures applied by the governments across countries and regions, and the related issues
emerged in education (e.g., “school”) and “economy”.
To track the evolution of the focus of Twitter discussions, as shown in Figure 6(b), we assigned each
term with the average post date score. In general, terms in cluster #1 and #3 that related to the clinical
characteristics and genomic structure are in lighter colors because they were mentioned by Twitter users
in the relatively earlier stage of the coronavirus outbreak. In contrast, terms in cluster #2, #4, and #5 are
in darker colors, suggesting that with the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, the focus of the Twitter
discussions transferred from clinical and virological research to topics on how to treat and prevent the
infectious disease, how do the governments face the public health emergency, and how does the
pandemic affects society.
Considering that hashtags are deemed as concept symbols indicating particular concepts in relation to
the mentioned publications (Haustein et al., 2016), just like author keywords to scientific publications
(Haunschild et al., 2019), hereby Figure 7(a) shows the hashtag coupling network of 219 English
hashtags that have been used at least 50 times in total.8 There are four clusters generated based on these
hashtags: hashtags in cluster #1 (green cluster) are mainly about the coronavirus outbreak in China and
virological research; cluster #2 (yellow cluster) includes hashtags of some medical technologies and
hashtags labelling the PubMed updates; hashtags in cluster #3 (red cluster) highlights some political and
misinformation debates, in which “chloroquine” and “hydroxychloroquine” are included; finally,
hashtags in cluster #4 (blue cluster) indicates the global spread of the outbreaks in many countries and
a series of healthcare measures that were called on to prevent the virus transmission.
Similarly, Figure 7(b) shows the overlay visualization of the hashtag coupling network scored by the
post date. It is obvious that hashtags located in the lower right part hold higher post date scores than
those in the upper left part, which means that in the early stage of the coronavirus outbreak, the pandemic
in China was frequently discussed by Twitter users, as well as the basic virological research on the novel
virus. However, along with the global spread, the focus of Twitter attention transferred to other countries
suffering from the crisis, by the meantime, Twitter users started to attach hashtags of healthcare
measures, such as “#flattenthecurve”, “#socialdistancing”, and “#stayhome”, to underline the
importance of taking actions to stop the virus.

8

For clear visualization, we excluded the dominant hashtags that only contain the names of the infectious
disease or the novel coronavirus or their variants from the network, such as “#COVID19”, “#COVID_19”, and
“#SARS_COV_2”.

Discussion
The tweeting patterns around COVID-19-related research
The global outbreak of COVID-19 has triggered an avalanche of scientific research and public
discussions, thereby generating a so-called infodemic referring to an over-abundance of information

15

related to the epidemic that increases the risk of misinformation,9 which is also concerned by Twitter
users in the light of their use of hashtags pointing controversial misinformation. As emphasized by Xie
et al. (2020), it is of great importance to study information behaviors during global health crises. Against
this background, we focused on the information behaviors of sharing and discussing COVID-19-related
research on Twitter. By employing nearly 1.4 million Twitter mentions as the traces of broader public
engagement with COVID-19-related publications, we tracked the changing public concerns about the
novel PHEIC during the first three months of 2020.
Since the initial outbreak of COVID-19 at the very end of 2019 in China, there have been a growing
torrent of new scientific publications on this infectious disease and the causative novel coronavirus
(Brainard, 2020). As one of the most significant windows for the public to get better understanding of
the unprecedented pandemic, continuous research progress has widely attracted Twitter attention from
the public, causing a wealth of Twitter mention data that connect the science landscape and the social
media landscape. For the 6,162 COVID-19-related publications in our dataset, 68.1% of them have been
mentioned on Twitter at least once. The value of Twitter coverage is much higher than those found in
previous surveys based on larger-scale multidisciplinary samples (13.3% by Costas et al. (2015), 21.5%
by Haustein et al. (2015)), implying that the Twitter attention to COVID-19-related research is much
larger than usual. Alongside the pandemic of COVID-19 entered a new stage with rapid spread in
countries outside of China in the middle of March, 2020 (Bedford et al., 2020), the Twitter attention
toward research progress increased drastically in late March accordingly.
Overall, the tweeting patterns around COVID-19-related research comply with the observed general
tweeting patterns from the perspectives of both temporal accumulation and involved Twitter users.
Through the lens of the top-10 most tweeted publications, we found that Twitter attention accumulated
soon after the publication and concentrated in the following first few days, which is in accordance with
the general temporal accumulation patterns of scholarly Twitter mentions (Fang & Costas, 2020; Shuai
et al., 2012). Based on the users’ profile descriptions, the composition of Twitter users with interest in
discussing COVID-19-related research was found to be similar with the general communities of Twitter
users who shared scholarly literature (Díaz-Faes et al., 2019). Twitter users primarily described
themselves from the angles of personal description, interest and faith, academic roles, and attitude and
position. In terms of being retweeted, Twitter mentions originated from users with academic roles got
substantially more retweets, especially for senior researchers and users describing themselves as being
related to the field of biomedical and health sciences. Therefore, in the case of COVID-19, sciencebased information posted by academically related users are more influential in the Twitter dissemination
network.
The evolution of the focus of Twitter discussions over time
Based on our dataset, topics extracted from the titles of COVID-19-related publications were clustered
into three main research directions, including epidemiological research, virological research, and
clinical research. In each direction, there are some research topics with higher levels of Twitter attention
received. Same as what has been observed by Colavizza et al. (2020), in general, research topics of
pressing relevance received more Twitter attention, especially for those in relation to clinical features,
infection, treatments, and countermeasures.
Different from the strong concordance between scholarly contents and related tweet contents found in
other fields (Lyu & Costas, 2020; Robinson-Garcia et al., 2017), the Twitter discussions around COVID19-related research show a higher degree of engagement according to the dissimilarity between
publication titles and related full tweet texts. Instead of simply repeating the titles, Twitter users
expanded the tweet contents with their own opinions in the science-based Twitter conversations. The
expanded Twitter discussions are mainly about five topics related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including
the clinical characteristics and transmission risks, the clinical trials and potential treatments, the genomic
The concept of the term “infodemic” was mentioned in the WHO Situation Report-13 at:

structure and probable origins, the virus persistence under different circumstances, and the governmental
measures and social responses. On the one hand, these topics frequently mentioned by Twitter users
have a strong connection to the scientific discoveries; on the other hand, Twitter users talked about
COVID-19-related research with particular focus on its impacts on the real world, covering a range of
concerns about children, education, economy, and society.
Besides, there is a change trend of the focus of the Twitter discussions across the above topics over time.
At the early stage when the COVID-19 pandemic was confined to China, most Twitter discussions were
associated with the research on the virological and clinical characteristics, however, over time the focus
of the Twitter discussions transferred to the pursuit of effective treatments, the countermeasures by the
governments, and the strong influences on social and economic activities. This finding was further
confirmed by the usage of hashtags, with the hashtags related to China and basic virological research
dominated at the beginning and those about global outbreaks, potential treatments, and healthcare
measures stood out latterly. In light of these results, during the age of worldwide pandemic, it appears
that understanding the origin and features from the virological and clinical aspects was the first priority
for the public concerns before a global outbreak, while along with the aggravation of situation and the
improvement of cognition, the public concerns transferred to a broader scope beyond academia,
particularly about the progress in treatment, the countermeasures by the governments, the healthcare
measures for self-protection, and the influences on society.
The long-term impacts made by COVID-19 are still continuing, in future research, we will continue to
study the evolution of the Twitter attention toward COVID-19-related research. To unveil the
differences of local public concerns, we plan to respectively explore the Twitter attention from different
geographic locations and in different language contexts.
Limitations
There are some limitations that should be acknowledged in this study. First, we relied on the bibliometric
information provided by Dimensions.ai for most analyses, so only COVID-19-related publications with
DOI or PubMed ID indexed by Dimensions.ai were taken into account, while those without available
identifiers or not indexed by Dimensions.ai were not included in our analyses. Second, due to the
limitation of bibliometric information that we retrieved from Dimensions, only the titles were analyzed
as the representatives of scholarly contents of COVID-19-related publications, while other bibliometric
information like abstract, keywords, and full texts were left out. Lastly, in the analyses of full tweet texts
and hashtags, we only considered the tweets written in English. Although English tweets account for the
majority of the Twitter discussions, they might only reflect the opinions owned by English-speaking
users.

Conclusions
This study tracked the Twitter attention surrounding the COVID-19-related research efforts during the
first three months of 2020, to disclose the public concerns about the COVID-19 pandemic embedded in
the science-based conversations on Twitter. Twitter mentions of COVID-19-related publications
presented a rising tendency in parallel with the increasing number of research outputs, especially in late
March, 2020. Amongst the Twitter users sharing COVID-19-related research, academically related users
with relevant expertise played an influential role in disseminating research outputs on Twitter according
to their higher levels of retweets received. In general, research topics with pressing relevance attracted
more Twitter attention, such as those about clinical characteristics, infection, treatments, and
countermeasures. With time elapsing, the focus of the Twitter discussions around COVID-19-related
research evolved from virological and clinical research findings to the potential treatments, the
countermeasures by the governments, the healthcare measures for self-protection, and some broader
discussions about the social influences, showing a dynamic of the public concerns during the age of
public health emergency. Overall, our results support the idea that the analysis of the Twitter
engagement around the COVID-19-related research efforts can provide evidence of other types of
societal perceptions around the pandemic. Therefore, the study of the social media response to the
17

scholarly response, can be a useful approach to inform the existence and development of broader
concerns around the pandemic.
