Abstract
Ever since the first case of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was confirmed in Wuhan, China,
social distancing has been promoted worldwide, including the United States. It is one of the major
community mitigation strategies, also known as non-pharmaceutical interventions. However, our
understanding is remaining limited in how people practice social distancing. In this study, we construct a
Social Distancing Index (SDI) to evaluate people’s mobility pattern changes along with the spread of
COVID-19. We utilize an integrated dataset of mobile device location data for the contiguous United
States plus Alaska and Hawaii over a 100-day period from January 1, 2020 to April 9, 2020. The major
findings are: 1) the declaration of the national emergency concerning the COVID-19 outbreak greatly
encouraged social distancing and the mandatory stay-at-home orders in most states further strengthened
the practice; 2) the states with more confirmed cases have taken more active and timely responses in
practicing social distancing; 3) people in the states with fewer confirmed cases did not pay much attention
to maintaining social distancing and some states, e.g., Wyoming, North Dakota, and Montana, already
began to practice less social distancing despite the high increasing speed of confirmed cases; 4) some
counties with the highest infection rates are not performing much social distancing, e.g., Randolph
County and Dougherty County in Georgia, and some counties began to practice less social distancing
right after the increasing speed of confirmed cases went down, e.g., in Blaine County, Idaho, which may
be dangerous as well.

Introduction
Since the World Health Organization (WHO) announced COVID-19 a pandemic, the infectious illness
without effective vaccinations has threatened many countries and regions. As one of the major nonpharmaceutical interventions, social distancing, or physical distancing, is considered as an effective way
to reduce COVID-19 infections. In the United States, government agencies have taken actions step by
step to promote social distancing and mitigate the spread of COVID-19, such as educating the public the
importance of social distancing, closing non-essential businesses, and issuing mandatory stay-at-home
orders. The questions immediately come up. How do people react to the government actions and perform
social distancing? How would these control measures influence the modeling of transmission dynamics?
When could we lift such restrictions? We therefore propose a Social Distancing Index (SDI) based on
mobile device location data to unveil people's mobility patterns in reaction to COVID-19 and social
distancing policies. The objective of this study is to provide more insights into people’s movements that
could help policymaking in public health and accommodate epidemic modeling improvements.
People’s actual behaviors in response to the interventions play an important role in modeling transmission
dynamics. The existing studies regarding impact assessment of control measures mainly estimated related
modeling parameters by Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)1, utilized the simulation models to
estimate contact network based on a synthetic population2, estimated the contact patterns using survey
data, modeling, and simulation3–4, and collected people’s behavior reactions through dedicated surveys5.
We found that there lack timely contributions from real-world observations. Meanwhile, studies that
evaluated the mobility changes during the pandemic from real-time and real-world observations mainly
focuses on a single indicator: the distances traveled. The topics include the development of a social
distancing scoreboard at the nation, state, and county level6, the direct impact of stay-at-home mandates7,
and the mobility patterns by income distribution8, etc9–11. A single metric, such as distances traveled, is
not sufficient to capture the mobility changes and to portray people’s performances in social distancing.
Considering the various measurements of people’s mobility patterns, such as number of trips made per
person, and origin and destination matrix that displays the trips made between regions, an inclusive index
is needed to simplify the information regarding different dimensions of human movements. An index also
makes it easier for the stakeholders to communicate with each other12, especially during this global
challenge in alleviating the COVID-19 pandemic.
In this study, we incorporate five basic metrics to comprehensively evaluate people’s behaviors in social
distancing, e.g., number of personal trips (work and non-work) made daily and percentage of out-ofcounty trips. These metrics are generated from mobile device location data by data fusion and analytics.
Mobile device location data is an emerging data source that provides insights into real-time human
mobility patterns with its large sample size and continuous observations. Researchers have utilized such
data to understand individual human mobility patterns13, to understand the spreading patterns of mobile
phone viruses14, to explore social ties and link prediction15, and to evaluate the impact of human mobility
on epidemics16–18. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have also discussed how mobile
device data could help policymakers control infection, optimize policymaking, and evaluate the
effectiveness of released policies19,20 without overlooking the privacy issues about digital data21. We
hereby introduce mobile device location data as an appropriate and functional data source for measuring
the great impact of COVID-19 and facilitating public health researches based on real-world observations.

Methods
Sources of data
For this study, the research team created a data panel by integrating multiple mobile device data sources
representing person and vehicle movements to improve the quality of the data. The data providers
2

collected the first-party data from anonymized users for privacy protection. Next, we went through the
data cleaning process, in which the consistency, accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of all
observations were checked, and all suspicious observations got removed. We then clustered the location
points into activity locations to identify home and work locations at the census block group (CBG) level
for privacy protection. After that, we applied previously developed algorithms22 to produce trip level
information from the cleaned data panel, including trip origin and destination, travel distance, departure
time, and arrival time. If anonymized individuals in the sample did not make any trip longer than 1·61 km
from home for a calendar day, we considered them as the stay-at-home population. A multi-level
weighting procedure including device-level and trip-level weights was employed to expand the sample to
the entire population and to ensure the representativeness of the population at the nation, state, and county
level. The results of the computational algorithms have been validated based on several independent
datasets, such as National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) and American Community Survey (ACS),
and peer reviewed by an external expert panel22. Finally, the derived mobility metrics were integrated
with COVID-19 case data23 and population data24, and published in the University of Maryland COVID19 Impact Analysis Platform25. The platform aggregates mobile device location data from more than 100
million devices across the nation at a monthly basis. Additional details can be found in another paper by
the authors22.
Generated from the mobile device location data from January 1 to April 9, 2020, the five basic mobility
metrics are defined and summarized in Table 1. The basic metrics are selected to cover the frequency,
spatial range, and semantics of people’s daily travel.

Social Distancing Index
In order to properly design the structure of the Social Distancing Index (SDI), we have reviewed the
existing indices from various fields. Based on our findings, there are mainly two types of indices:
category-based indices and score-based ones. The category-based indices explain the proposed objective
by categories. For instance, Pandemic Severity Index (PSI) classifies the case fatality ratio (CFR) of a
disease into five categories (from one to five)26, and Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale evaluates the
severity of an earthquake by categorizing it into twelve bins from I to XII27. On the other hand, scorebased indices usually define a score from zero to one hundred to differentiate objectives and rank them in
3

order. For example, US News State Ranking creates a score that covers eight topics on people’s needs in
each state and assigns different weights to those topics based on the survey data28. Bloomberg Global
Health Index is another score-based index that ranks countries in terms of healthiness by giving them a
rate between zero and one hundred29.
It can be summarized that the category-based indices are usually built upon a single variable, and the
score-based ones are more capable of integrating multiple metrics to be more informative. Therefore, we
design SDI as a score-based one, which gives a 0-100 score to each geographical area, e.g., a state or a
county, and measures to what extent the residents in the area and visitors to the area practice social
distancing. Zero indicates no social distancing and one hundred indicates perfect social distancing
compared with the benchmark days before the COVID-19 outbreak. The benchmark values for the basic
metrics are computed using data from the weekdays (Monday to Friday) during the first two weeks of
February. Thereafter, the changes in people’s mobility patterns are captured by percentage reduction of
the corresponding metrics in Table 1 (noted as 𝑋2 , … , 𝑋5 ) as input. And the absolute changes in the
percentage of residents staying home (noted as 𝑋1 ) also serve as input. The percentage reductions are
absolute values between 0–100%. Any increase will be standardized as 0% in the calculation.
By jointly considering the travel behaviors of the region residents and visitors, the equation for computing
SDI is given as follows.
𝑆𝐷𝐼 = [(𝛽1 𝑋1 + 0 · 01 × (100 − 𝑋1 ) × (𝛽2 𝑋2 + 𝛽3 𝑋3 + 𝛽4 𝑋4 )] × (1 − 𝛽5 ) + 𝛽5 𝑋5
Where 𝛽1 = 1 and 𝛽2 + 𝛽3 + 𝛽4 = 1.
The first part of the equation focuses on resident trips and the second part on out-of-county trips. 𝛽5 is
thus the weight assigned to behavior changes regarding out-of-county trips. For the resident trips, we use
percentage of residents staying home to account for residents that do not make trips longer than 1·61 km
from home, so the weight is simply one (𝛽1 = 1). For the people not staying home (travelers), percentage
of which is 100 − 𝑋1 , we use a weighted sum of percentage reductions in the number of work and nonwork trips made daily, and the average distances traveled per person. When they make more work and
non-work trips, and travel longer distances, they are considered to practice less social distancing. The
weights for each variable should sum up to one (𝛽2 + 𝛽3 + 𝛽4 = 1) so that the resident travelers are
comparable to residents staying at home.
To assign appropriate weights to each variable, we have consulted both actual observations and
conceptual guidelines. Firstly, we observe that the relative ratio between resident trips and out-of-county
trips nationwide is about four to one. Hence, we assign a weight of 0·2 to 𝛽5 . Secondly, it is widely
observed that people have significantly reduced travel distances so the index should avoid the large
percentage reduction in distances traveled to overwhelm the reductions in number of trips. Meanwhile,
the reductions in number of trips made are more informative regarding people’s reactions to the stay-athome mandates. We thus consider the reduction in number of trips twice as important as that in distances
traveled, and assign a weight of 0·3 to 𝛽4 . Moreover, as suggested by government agencies, people are
highly encouraged to reduce non-essential trips. The index should be designed to favor the reduction in
non-essential trips, which is estimated twice as important as the reduction in essential trips. The work
trips are intuitively considered as essential trips and the non-work trips could include both. Based on the
2017 NHTS Travel Profile30, the relative ratio between essential and non-essential non-work trips is
approximately 1:2. Therefore, the relative ratio between the percentage reduction of work and non-work
trips is 1:1·67. According to the constraint 𝛽2 + 𝛽3 + 𝛽4 = 1, we further assign 0·25 to 𝛽2 and 0·45 to 𝛽3 .
In this study, SDI is eventually computed as follows.
𝑆𝐷𝐼 = [(𝑋1 + 0 · 01 × (100 − 𝑋1 ) × (0 · 25𝑋2 + 0 · 45𝑋3 + 0 · 3𝑋4 )] × 0 · 8 + 0 · 2𝑋6

Results
The proposed SDI is sensitive to people’s behavior changes and is capable of reflecting the mobility
changes accordingly. We examine the effectiveness and reasonableness of the proposed SDI by reviewing
its temporal change for the entire nation (Figure 1). The SDI changes clearly indicate that people stay
home more and travel less on weekends, especially on Sundays. During the study period (100 days from
January 1 to April 9, 2020), people began to practice significantly more social distancing nationwide after
President Trump declared the national emergency concerning the COVID-19 outbreak. The national
emergency declaration immediately triggered people’s responses on the following weekdays starting from
March 16, and on the weekends of the following weeks, e.g., March 22, March 29, and April 5. In
addition, the range of index became wider after March 16, indicating that people from different states
were taking distinct responses to the national emergency announcement, which will be discussed in the
following sections. After the week of March 23, we observe a general plateau in terms of the mean value
and range of SDI. However, after April 6, there is a tendency that some states started to practice less
social distancing. The possible reasons are twofold. First, people become less attentive to the outbreak as
the outbreak persists. Moreover, the great economic impact is threatening the entire nation so that some
people cannot afford to maintain social distance.

Figure 1. Temporal changes of Social Distancing Index nationwide
The mandatory stay-at-home orders issued by most states also triggered a second wave of strengthening
social distancing, following the great impact of the declaration of the national emergency. However, in
the week of April 6, the SDI scores of some states kept decreasing, such as Idaho (-9), Wyoming (-9),
Montana (-8), and Alabama (-6). The SDI is computed for all states for seven consecutive weeks from
February 20, 2020 to April 9, 2020 in Figure 2. The states are sorted in descending order by their SDI
scores on the last day (April 9). The top five regions that are performing more social distancing are the
District of Columbia, New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, and Hawaii. Except for D.C., the other four
states also issued the mandatory stay-at-home orders early. Meanwhile, the states practicing less social
distancing are Wyoming, Arkansas, Idaho, Montana, Oklahoma, and South Dakota. Since most of them
have not issued the stay-at-home mandates, people's performances in social distancing are almost
consistent after the start of the national emergency. In the east and west coast, people intend to practice
more social distancing potentially because they were exposed to the infection risk for a longer period and
are aware of the higher infection risk with higher population density. Especially, the SDI scores kept
increasing for the states in the northeast region in the week of April 6: Vermont (+8), New Hampshire
(+6), Maine (+5), Rhode Island (+5), Massachusetts (+5), Connecticut (+4), New York (+3), Delaware
(+2), etc. On the other hand, we observe continuously and significantly descending SDI scores in the
same week for the following states: Idaho (-9), Wyoming (-9), Montana (-8), Alabama (-6), Alaska (-5),

5

Georgia (-5), Oregon (-5), North Carolina (-5), Tennessee (-5), Arkansas (-5), Washington (-4), and
Arizona (-4).

The marker “I” indicates the start date of the mandatory stay-at-home order and the states without such
orders are highlighted by red boxes. The dates shown are Sundays.
Figure 2. Social Distancing Index heatmap for all states.
The states with more confirmed cases have taken more active and timely responses in social distancing
and people are more responsive to the social distancing policies. However, the states with fewer
infections have slower responses and people’s behaviors did not change much in response to the
mandatory stay-at-home orders. We have zoomed in on the top five and bottom five states regarding the
cumulative number of confirmed cases on April 9 (Figure 3). After the stay-at-home orders were issued,
all the top five states experienced a spike in SDI, but such orders have not encouraged much changes in
the bottom five states, except Hawaii. It implies that the local severity of the COVID-19 outbreak plays a
significant role in people’s decision making. From the current observations, people in the top five states
started conforming social distancing about one week before the local outbreak of COVID-19. Considering
the time lag between infection and diagnosis, the benefits of social distancing may need more time to
reveal. For the two states without stay-at-home mandates, the SDI increase is mainly prompted by the
declaration of national emergency and the growth of confirmed cases. Although the bottom five states
have fewer confirmed cases by the end of the study period (April 9), the risks of infection for these states
are potentially higher than expected, especially in Wyoming, North Dakota, and Montana. People have

6

not practiced more social distancing even after the confirmed cases started increasing at a fast pace. After
April 6, people in these three states have practiced less social distancing, which is worth attention.

regarding the cumulative number of confirmed cases.

SDI is also informative at the county level. Figure 4 demonstrates the temporal changes of SDI for the top
ten counties regarding the cumulative number of confirmed cases per thousand people. The counties in
New York are performing strict social distancing but Randolph County and Dougherty County in Georgia
are not paying enough attention. Despite their high infection rates, their social distancing scores are
relatively low, even after the stay-at-home mandate. The same concern exists in Blaine County, Idaho.
People have practiced less social distancing right after the increasing speed of confirmed cases went
down, which may result in a subsequent increase in transmission.

Discussion
During the crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic, data-driven tools that can provide insights into human
behavior are of paramount importance. In this paper, we developed a Social Distancing Index (SDI) to
capture the people’s actual behaviors in social distancing by considering various aspects of human
mobility patterns extracted from various sources of mobile device location data. Leveraging the merits of
crowdsourcing, SDI is currently available at the nation, state, and county level25 to help researchers
quantify the influences of such community mitigation strategies. Monitoring the SDI patterns, both
spatially and temporally, also enables policymakers to evaluate the effectiveness of related policies and to
involve data-informed decision making for public health. In addition, SDI boosts the awareness of the
general public and communities regarding the ongoing situation for where they are living. People can use
insights from SDI to evaluate the potential risks in their neighborhoods.
Being exploratory research, this study could be further improved in several directions. Firstly, the basic
mobility metrics could be generated considering the regional differences. Specifically, the current
definition of staying at home population may introduce some bias due to different individual behaviors
between residents in rural and urban areas. For example, many people living in rural regions still need to
make long trips to shop for essential goods while people in urban areas have a higher chance to obtain
essential items in a close neighborhood (within 1·61 km from home) and thus have a higher chance to be
identified as staying at home. Secondly, adding more mobility metrics to the SDI could contribute to the
comprehensiveness of the index. For instance, the trip purposes could be inferred by integrating mobile
device location data and point of interest (POI) data. Identifying where people visit could allow us to
distinguish between essential and non-essential trips, in addition to distinguishing between work and nonwork trips. Thirdly, variables measuring the relationship between human movements and disease
transmission could be extremely valuable. Although it may be difficult to retrieve details like contact
tracing information from mobile device location data, the aggregate measurements can also be significant
indicators, such as trips from and to the heavily infected areas that yield potential exposure and disease
transmission in the study area, on top of out-of-county trips that are currently included. Moreover, an
expert survey on improving the weight assignments to different variables in SDI may also contribute to a
better construction of the index if time allows. Observing the mobility patterns and COVID-19 evolution
for a longer period may also shed light on the assignment of weights.
Another future research direction is to integrate SDI with existing epidemiological frameworks, such as
compartmental models. A variable of interest in these frameworks is to understand how the input
variables evolve during the course of the outbreak. Certain policies such as mobility restrictions can
significantly reduce input variables like reproduction factor of the disease. SDI can be employed in these
models to enhance the input prediction in compartmental models.
