Abstract
The latest threat to global health is the COVID-19 outbreak. Although there exist large datasets
of chest X-rays (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) scans, few COVID-19 image collections are
currently available due to patient privacy. At the same time, there is a rapid growth of COVID-19-relevant
articles in the biomedical literature, including those that report findings on radiographs. Here, we present
COVID-19-CT-CXR, a public database of COVID-19 CXR and CT images, which are automatically
extracted from COVID-19-relevant articles from the PubMed Central Open Access (PMC-OA) Subset.
We extracted figures, associated captions, and relevant figure descriptions in the article and separated
compound figures into subfigures. Because a large portion of figures in COVID-19 articles are not CXR
or CT, we designed a deep-learning model to distinguish them from other figure types and to classify
them accordingly. The final database includes 1,327 CT and 263 CXR images (as of May 9, 2020) with
their relevant text. To demonstrate the utility of COVID-19-CT-CXR, we conducted four case studies.
(1) We show that COVID-19-CT-CXR, when used as additional training data, is able to contribute to
improved deep-learning (DL) performance for the classification of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 CT.
(2) We collected CT images of influenza, another common infectious respiratory illness that may present
similarly to COVID-19, and fine-tuned a baseline deep neural network to distinguish a diagnosis of
COVID-19, influenza, or normal or other types of diseases on CT. (3) We fine-tuned an unsupervised oneclass classifier from non-COVID-19 CXR and performed anomaly detection to detect COVID-19 CXR.
(4) From text-mined captions and figure descriptions, we compared 15 clinical symptoms and 20 clinical
findings of COVID-19 vs. those of influenza to demonstrate the disease differences in the scientific
publications. Our database is unique, as the figures are retrieved along with relevant text with fine-grained
descriptions, and it can be extended easily in the future. We believe that our work is complementary to
existing resources and hope that it will contribute to medical image analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Introduction

The latest threat to global health is the ongoing outbreak of the COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 (Fauci
et al., 2020). So far, pneumonia appears to be the most frequent and serious manifestation, and major
1

complications, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), can present shortly after the onset of
symptoms, contributing to the high mortality rate of COVID-19 (Chen et al., 2020b; Guan et al., 2020; Wang
et al., 2020a). Chest X-rays (CXR) and chest computed tomography (CT) scans are playing a major part
in the detection and monitoring of these respiratory manifestations. In some cases, CT scans have shown
abnormal findings in patients prior to the development of symptoms and even before the detection of the
viral RNA (Shi et al., 2020b; Xie et al., 2020; Mei et al., 2020).
With the shortage of specialists who have been trained to accumulate experiences with COVID-19 diagnosis, there has been a concerted move toward the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly
deep-learning-based methods, in COVID-19 pandemic diagnosis and prognosis, in which well-annotated
data always play a critical role (Shi et al., 2020a). Although there exist large public datasets of CXR (Irvin
et al., 2019; Johnson et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2017) and CT (Yan et al., 2018), there are few collections of
COVID-19 images to effectively train a deep neural network (Cohen et al., 2020; He et al., 2020; Zhang et al.,
2020b). Nevertheless, we have seen a growing number of COVID-19 relevant articles in PubMed (Chen
et al., 2020c; Wang et al., 2020b). In addition, there is a recent COVID-19 initiative to expand access via
PubMed Central Open Access (PMC-OA) Subset to coronavirus-related publications and associated data
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/about/covid-19-faq/). As a result, more articles
(> 10, 000 as of May 9, 2020) relevant to the COVID-19 pandemic or prior coronavirus research were added
through PMC-OA with a free-reuse license for secondary analysis.
Non-textual components (e.g., figures and tables) provide key information in many scientific documents
and are considered in many tasks, including search engine and knowledge base construction (Choudhury
et al., 2013; Smith et al., 2018). As such, we have recently seen a growing interest in mining figures within
scientific documents (Ahmed et al., 2016; Li et al., 2019; Siegel et al., 2018). In the medical domain, figures
also are a topical interest because they often contain graphical images, such as CXR and CT (Lopez et al.,
2013; Tsutsui and Crandall, 2017). Extracting CXR and CT from biomedical publications, however, is
neither well studied nor well addressed.
For the above reasons, there is an unmet need to construct the COVID-19 image dataset from PMC-OA
to allow researchers to freely access the images along with a description of the text. In this paper, we thus
introduce an effective framework to construct a CXR and CT database from PMC-OA and propose a public
database, termed COVID-19-CT-CXR. In contrast to previous approaches that relied solely on the manual
submission of medical images to the repository, in this work, figures are automatically collected by using the
integration of medical imaging and natural-language processing with limited human annotation efforts. In
addition, figures in this database are partnered with text that describes these cases with details, a feature not
found in other such datasets.
The framework consists of three steps. First, we extracted figures, associated captions, and relevant
figure descriptions in the PMC-OA article. Such extraction is non-trivial due to the diverse layout and
large volume of articles in the PMC-OA subset. Second, we separated compound figures into subfigures, as
medical figures often comprise multiple image panels (Li et al., 2019; Tsutsui and Crandall, 2017). Third,
we classified subfigures into CXR, CT, or others because a large portion of figures in COVID-19 articles are
not CXR or CT. To this end, we designed a deep-learning model to distinguish them from other figure types
and to classify them accordingly.
We further demonstrate the utility of COVID-19-CT-CXR through a series of case studies. First, using
this database as additional training data, we show that existing deep neural networks can receive benefits
in the task of COVID-19/non-COVID-19 classification of CT images. Second, we demonstrate that the
database can be used to develop a baseline model to distinguish COVID-19, influenza, and other CT, a
less-studied topic. Third, we train an unsupervised one-class classifier from non-COVID-19 CXRs and

2

performed anomaly detection to detect COVID-19 CXRs. Fourth, we extract symptoms and clinical findings
from the text, using the natural language-processing methods. The symptoms and clinical findings not only
confirm the results that radiologists have found but also potentially identify other findings that may have
been overlooked.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the material and methods to build
the dataset. Section 3 contains the details of the statistics of the dataset, results of the image type classification, and the use cases. Finally, Sections 4 and 5 provide the discussion, conclusions, and recommendations
for future work.

Material and methods
COVID-19 relevant articles on PMC-OA

Articles in this study were collected from the PMC-OA Subset. PubMed Central® (PMC) is a free, full-text
archive of biomedical and life sciences journal literature (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/).
PMC-OA is a well-known portion of the PMC articles under a Creative Commons license
(or custom license of the Public Health Emergency COVID-19 Initiative in PMC due to the
COVID pandemic) that allows for text mining, secondary analysis, and other types of reuse
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/about/covid-19-faq/). In this study, we collected COVID-19 relevant articles using LitCovid (Chen et al., 2020c), a curated literature hub for
tracking up-to-date scientific information about the 2019 novel coronavirus. LitCovid screens the search
results of the PubMed query: "coronavirus"[All Fields] "ncov"[All Fields] OR
"cov"[All Fields] OR "2019-nCoV"[All Fields] OR "COVID-19"[All Fields]
OR "SARS-CoV-2"[All Fields]. Relevant articles are identified and curated with assistance from
an automated machine-learning and text-classification algorithm. As of May 9, 2020, there were 5,381
PMC-OA articles in the collection (Table 1). The topics of articles ranged from diagnosis to treatment to
case reports.

Overview of the COVID-19-CT-CXR construction

Figure 1 shows the overview pipeline of the development. For a given PMC-OA article, we first extract
figures, associated captions, and relevant figure descriptions in the PMC-OA article. Then, if figures are
compound, we separate them into subfigures. We further classify the individual figures into CT, CXR, or
other types of scientific images, using a deep-learning model. The final database includes figures with their
types and relevant descriptions in the manuscript.

2.3

Text extraction

In this step, we identify figure captions and relevant text with the referenced figures. To facilitate the automated processing of full-text articles in PMC-OA, Comeau et al. (2019) convert PMC articles to BioC
format, a data structure in XML for text sharing and processing. Each article in BioC format is encoded in
UTF-8, and Unicode characters are converted to strings of ASCII characters. The article also includes section
types, figures, tables, and references (Kafkas et al., 2015). In this study, we downloaded the PMC-OA articles through the RESTful web service (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/bionlp/
APIs/BioC-PubMed/). We parsed these articles to locate figures with their figure numbers and their captions. We then used the figure number and regular expressions to find where the figure is cross-referenced
in the document. Figure 2 shows an example of a typical biomedical image in the article, “A rapid advice
guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infected pneumonia (standard version)” (Jin, 2020). The examples contain CXR, CT, a figure caption, and text that describes the case
with rich information, such as fever, symptoms, and clinical findings.

2.4

Subfigure separation

Most of the figures in the PMC-OA articles are compound figures. A key challenge here is that one figure
may have individual subfigures of the same category (e.g., four CT images) or several categories (e.g., one
CXR and one CT image placed side by side). For example, Figure 2 contains a compound figure with three
subfigures (Jin, 2020). Figures 2a and Figure 2b are CT images, and Figure 2c is a CXR. Notably, it is a

requirement to decompose compound figures into subfigures before modality classification. In this study, we
used a convolutional neural network developed by Tsutsui and Crandall (2017) to separate compound figures.
The model was pretrained on the ImageCLEF Medical dataset with an accuracy of 85.9% (De Herrera et al.,
2016).
We applied the model on the figures obtained in previous steps and filtered the subfigures with a size
smaller than 224 x 224 pixels. We consider that subfigures with fewer pixels might be deformed, and
most state-of-the-art neural networks in image analysis, such as Inception-v3 (Szegedy et al., 2016) and
DenseNet (Iandola et al., 2014), require an input size of 224 or larger.

2.5

Image modality classification

A large portion of figures in the PMC-OA articles are not CXR or CT images. To distinguish them from other
types of scientific figures, we designed a scientific figure classifier that was fine-tuned on a newly created
dataset (https://github.com/ncbi-nlp/COVID-19-CT-CXR). Table 2 shows the breakdown of
the figures by their category in the training and test set. This dataset consists of 2,700 figures in three categories: CXR, CT, and Other scientific figure types. A total of 500 CXRs are randomly picked from the
NIH Chest X-ray (Wang et al., 2017), and 500 CT images are randomly picked from DeepLesion (Yan et al.,
2018). Other scientific figures are randomly picked from DocFigure (Jobin et al., 2019). The original DocFigure annotated figures of 28 categories, such as Heat map, Bar plots, and Histogram. Here, we combined
these categories into one for simplicity of training the classifier. In addition, we curated 1,200 figures from
PMC-OA, using the annotation tool developed by Tang et al. (2020).

Our framework uses DenseNet121 to classify image types (Huang et al., 2016). The weights (or parameters) were pretrained on ImageNet (Russakovsky et al., 2015). We replaced the last classification layer
with a fully connected layer with a softmax operation that outputs the approximate probability that an input image is a CXR, CT, or other scientific figure type. All images were resized to 224 x 224 pixels. The
hyperparameters include a learning rate of 0.0001, a batch size of 16, and 50 training epochs. All experiments were conducted on a server with an NVIDIA V100 128G GPU from the NIH HPC Biowulf cluster
(http://hpc.nih.gov). We implemented the framework using the Keras deep-learning library with
TensorFlow backend (https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras).

Qualification and statistical analysis

The performance metrics include the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity,
specificity (recall), precision (positive predictive value), and F1 score. For the classification problem, we
chose the label with the highest probability when required in computing the metrics. Each of the models
was fine-tuned and tested five times, using the same parameters, training, and testing images each time.
The validation set was randomly selected from 10% of the training set. Fisher’s exact test was used to
determine whether there are nonrandom associations between COVID-19 and influenza’s symptoms and
clinical findings (Fisher, 1922). We conduct above statistical analysis using numpy, scipy, matplotlib, and
scikit-learn built on Python.

Results
COVID-19-CT-CXR characteristics

Table 3 shows the breakdown of the figures by modality. We obtained 1,327 CT images and 263 CXR
text-mined labeled as positive for COVID-19 from 1,831 PMC-OA articles. These images have different
sizes. The minimum, maximum, and average heights are 224, 2,703, and 387.5 pixels, respectively. The
minimum, maximum, and average widths are 224, 1,961, and 472.4, respectively. For each article, we also
include major elements, such as DOI, title, journal, and publication date for reference. Figure 3A shows
the cumulative numbers of articles and figures on a weekly basis. We analyzed the proportional distribution
of categories in COVID-19 relevant PMC-OA articles, and articles with figures, CT, and CXR. Figure 3B
shows that the “Case Report” category contains higher proportional articles with CXR/CT.

CXR to perform anomaly detection, to detect COVID-19 CXR. (4) We extracted 15 clinical symptoms and
26 clinical findings from the captions and relevant descriptions. We then compared their frequencies to those
described in articles on influenza, another common infectious respiratory illness that may present similarly
to COVID-19.

3.3.1

Classification of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 on CT

In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is important to separate patients likely to be infected with
COVID-19 from other non-COVID-19 patients. As it is time-consuming for specialists to both accumulate
experiences and read a large volume of CT scans to diagnose COVID-19, many studies use machine learning
to separate COVID-19 patients from non-COVID-19 patients (Chen et al., 2020a; He et al., 2020; Jin et al.,
2020; Wang et al., 2020c; Zheng et al., 2020). In this work, we hypothesize that our creation of additional
training data from existing articles can improve the performance of the system and reduce the effort of manual
image annotation. To test this hypothesis, we compared the performance of deep neural networks fine-tuned
on the existing benchmark (Zhao et al., 2020) and COVID-19-CT-CXR (Table 5). For a fair comparison, we
added additional training examples only in the training set and used the same test set as described in He et al.
(2020).

In this experiment, DenseNet121 was pre-trained on ImageNet, fine-tuned, and evaluated on the training
and test sets. We then replaced the last classification layer with a single neuron with sigmoid that outputs the
approximate probability that an input image is COVID-19 or non-COVID-19. Other experimental settings
are the same as that of fine-tuning the image modality classifier. Figure 4 shows that the model significantly
outperforms the baseline when PMC-OA CT figures were added for fine-tuning. Specifically, we achieved
the highest performance of 0.891 ± 0.012 in AUC, 0.780 ± 0.074 in recall, 0.816 ± 0.053 in precision, and
0.792 ± 0.015 in F-score (Table 6).

Classification of COVID-19, influenza, and other types of disease on
CT

As the COVID-19 outbreak continues to evolve, there is an increasing number of studies that compare
COVID-19 with other viral pneumonias, such as influenza (Luo et al., 2020). Distinguishing patients infected
by COVID-19 and influenza is important for public health measures because the current treatment guidelines
are different (Kimberlin, 2018). This task is non-trivial because both viruses have a similar radiological presentation. To assist clinicians at triage, several studies have proposed to use deep learning to distinguish
COVID-19 from influenza and no-infection with 3D CT scans (Xu et al., 2020). In this paper, we aim to
establish a baseline model to distinguish COVID-19 from influenza on single CT figures. To collect CT figures with influenza, we searched the PMC using the query “(Influenza[Title] OR (flu[Title]
AND pneumonia[Title]) AND open access[Filter]” and extracted the most recent 10,000
PMC-OA articles. We used the same method to extract CT and its caption and relevant text from the articles
(called Influenza-CT). Taken together, we construct a dataset with 983 CT for training and 242 CT for testing
(Table 7).

To obtain the baseline model, we use the same model and experimental settings as described in the

0.889 ± 0.014 for influenza detection. Table 8 shows more detail for the results. We achieved the highest
precision (0.845 ± 0.026) for COVID-19 detection and high recall (0.711 ± 0.053) for influenza detection.

Anomaly detection of COVID-19 in CXR using one-class learning

As they lack annotated COVID-19 CXR for training powerful deep-learning classifiers, unsupervised and
semi-supervised approaches are highly desired for automated COVID-19 diagnosis. The presence of
COVID-19 can be considered a novel anomaly in CXR for the NIH Chest X-ray dataset, in which no COVID19 cases are available. In this experiment, we performed anomaly detection (Chandola et al., 2009; Zhang
et al., 2020a) to detect COVID-19 CXR. We trained a one-class classifier, using only non-COVID-19 CXR,
11

and used this classifier to distinguish COVID-19 CXR from non-COVID-19 CXR. The non-COVID-19
images were a subset extracted from the NIH Chest X-ray dataset by combining 14 abnormalities and a nofinding category. The detailed numbers of training and testing CXR are shown in Table 9. We adopted the
generative adversarial one-class learning approach from Tang et al. (2019). Figure 6 shows the performance
of the unsupervised one-class learning by its ROC curves. Table 10 shows more detail for the results. Our
model achieved 0.828 ± 0.019 in AUC, 0.767 ± 0.020 in precision, 0.772 ± 0.017 in recall, and 0.769 ± 0.018
in F-score for COVID-19 anomaly detection.

Extraction of clinical symptoms and findings using text-mining

In this case, we extracted clinical symptoms or signs from the figure captions and relevant text that describes
the case. A total of 15 symptoms or signs were collected from Guan et al. (2020) and the CDC website (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.
html), including chest pain, constipation, cough, diarrhea, dizziness, dyspnea, fatigue, fever, headache,
myalgia, proteinuria, runny nose, sputum production, throat pain, and vomiting.
Extracting these symptoms from text is a challenging task because their mentions in the text can be positive or negative. For example, “fever” is negative in the sentence, “She experienced headache and pharyn12

galgia but no fever on 29 January.” To discriminate between positive and negative mentions, we applied
our previously developed tool, NegBio, on the figure caption and referred text (Peng et al., 2018). In short,
NegBio utilizes patterns in universal dependencies to identify the scope of triggers that are indicative of
negation; thus, it is highly accurate for detecting negative symptom mentions. Figure 7A shows the proportion of symptoms for COVID-19 and influenza. The most common symptoms are fever, cough, dyspnea, and
myalgia.
We then extracted the radiographic findings from the figure caption and text. The findings (and their
synonyms) are based on 20 common thoracic disease types, which are expanded from NIH Chest X-ray 14
labels (Wang et al., 2017). Figure 7B shows the 20 findings in both COVID-19 and influenza datasets. Both
illnesses can result in lung opacity, pneumonia, and consolidation. COVID-19 more likely results in groundglass opacification (GGO), while influenza more likely results in infiltration than does COVID-19 (Fisher’s
exact test, p < 0.0001).

Discussion

In this abrupt outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, the demand for chest radiographs and CT scans is growing rapidly,
but there is a shortage of experienced specialists, radiologists, and researchers. Further, we are still new to
this virus and have yet to discover the full radiologic features and prognosis of this disease. The tremendous
increase in the number of patients has led to a substantial increase of COVID-19-related PMC-OA articles
over the past few months (Figur 3A), especially in the case report and diagnosis-relevant articles (Figure 3B).
These articles contain rich chest radiographs and CT images that are helpful for scientists and clinicians in
describing COVID-19 cases. Thus, it is important to analyze these images and text to construct a largescale database. By using the quickly increasing dataset, AI methods can help to find significant features
of COVID-19 and speed up the clinical workload. Among others, deep learning is undoubtedly a powerful
approach in dealing with a pandemic outbreak of COVID-19.
Although deep learning has shown promise in diagnosing/screening COVID-19, using CT, it remains
difficult to collect large-scale labeled imaging data, especially in the public domain. In this work, we present
a set of repeatable techniques to rapidly build a CT and CXR dataset of COVID-19 from PMC-OA COVID19-relevant articles. The strength of the study lies in its multidisciplinary integration of medical imagining
and natural-language processing. It provides a new way to annotate large-scale medical images required by
deep-learning models.
An additional strength includes a highly accurate model for image type classification. As a large portion
of figures in the PMC-OA articles are not CXR or CT images, we provided a model to classify these two
types from other scientific figure types. Our model achieved both high precision and high recall (Table 4).
To assess the hypothesis that deep neural network fine-tuning on this additional dataset enables us to

diagnose COVID-19 with almost no hand-labeled data, we conducted several experiments. First, we showed
that this additional data enable significant performance gains to classify COVID-19 versus non-COVID-19
lung infection on CT (Figure 4 and Table 6). For our own system, we show that our baseline performance
compares favorably to the results in (He et al., 2020). Then, we added more automatically labeled training
data and achieved the highest performance of 0.891 ± 0.012 in AUC. The comparison shows that, with additional data, both precision and recall substantially improve (7.4% and 6.6%, respectively). This observation
indicates that additional COVID-19 CT helps to not only find more but also to restrict the positive predictions
to those with the highest certainty in the model.
In a more challenging scenario, we built a baseline system to distinguish COVID-19, influenza, and noinfection CT, which is a more clinically interesting but also more challenging task. We observed that we
could achieve high AUCs for both COVID-19 and influenza detection. The recall of COVID-19 detection
and the precision of influenza, however, are low (0.597 ± 0.030 and 0.609 ± 0.033, respectively). Although
several studies have tackled this problem (Xu et al., 2020), to the best of our knowledge, there is no publicly
available benchmarking. The differentiation between COVID-19 and influenza on CXR/CT without associated context is challenging. In the experiment on classification of COVID-19, influenza, and other types
of disease on CT, we found that although many of the CT findings had overlapping findings, “mixed GGO
(Ground glass opacity)” were mostly found in the COVID-19 dataset and “pleural thickening” and “linear
opacities” were mostly found in the influenza dataset. It is also worthy to note that the images from PMC-OA
may not represent the typical pool of influenza pneumonia real-world images, since researchers may report
extreme cases instead of typical cases. While our work only scratches the surface of the classification of
COVID-19, influenza, and normal or other types of diseases, we hope that it sheds light on the development
of generalizable deep-learning models that can assist frontline radiologists.
In addition, we presented a one-class learning model for anomaly detection of COVID-19 in CXR by
learning only from non-COVID-19 radiographs. Compared to the CT-based method, the one-class model
achieves comparable performance, showing great potential in discriminating COVID-19 from CXR. The
performance of our model, however, is worse than that of Zhang et al. (2020a), suggesting that this weakly
labeled dataset should be used as additional training data obtained without additional annotation cost from
existing entries in curated databases.
The unique characteristic of our database is that figures are retrieved along with relevant text that describes these cases in detail. Thus, text mining can be applied to extract additional information that confirms
the existing results and potentially identifies other findings that may have been overlooked. As proof of this
concept, we extracted clinical symptoms and findings from the text. We found that the most common symptoms of COVID-19 were fever and cough (Figure 7A), which are consistent with the clinical characteristics
in Zhang et al. (2020b). Other common symptoms include dyspnea (shortness of breath), fatigue, and throat
pain. These symptoms are consistent with those reported by the CDC. When comparing the frequencies of
these 20 clinical findings to those described in articles on influenza, Figure 7 shows that both conditions
cause lung opacity, pneumonia, and consolidation. Further, GGO appears more frequently for COVID-19,
whereas “infiltration” appears more frequently for influenza. This is because radiologists use the term GGO
to describe most COVID-19 findings. In addition, the influenza articles are older than are the COVID articles,
and, according to Fleischner Society recommendations, the use of the term infiltrate remains controversial,
and it is recommended that it no longer be used in reports (Bueno et al., 2018).
In terms of limitations, first, the subfigure segmentation model needs to be improved. In this study, we
applied a deep-learning model that was pretrained on an ImageCLEF Medical dataset to this task (Tsutsui
and Crandall, 2017). Although this model is robust to variations in background color and spaces between
subfigures, it sometimes fails to recognize similar subfigures that are aligned very closely. Unfortunately,

15

these cases appear more frequently in our study than in others (e.g., several CT images are placed in a grid).
Other errors occur when the model incorrectly treated the spine as spaces in the anteroposterior (AP) chest
X-ray and split the large figure into two subfigures. In the future, the figure synthesis approach should be
applied to augment the training datasets. Another limitation is that this work extracted only the passage that
contains the referred figure. Sometimes, the case is not described in this passage. In the future, we plan to
text mine the associated case description in the full text. Finally, while a figure is typically copyrighted with
the original article and using previously published figures is not a common practice in scholarly publications,
it is possible that one image is reused in different papers or reused in one paper for different purposes. In the
future, we plan to develop a model to remove duplicated images in the collection.

Conclusions

We have developed a framework for rapidly constructing a CXR/CT database from PMC full-text articles.
Our database is unique, as figures are retrieved along with relevant text that describes these cases in detail, and
it can be extended easily in the future. Hence, the work is complementary to existing resources. Applications
of this database show that our creation of additional training data from existing articles improves the system performance on COVID-19 vs. non-COVID-19 classification in CT and CXR. We hope that the public
dataset can facilitate deep-learning model development, educate medical students and residents, help to evaluate findings reported by radiologists, and provide additional insights for COVID-19 diagnosis. With an ongoing commitment to data sharing, we anticipate increasingly adding CXR and CT images to be made available as well in the coming months. The code that extracts the text from PMC, segments subfigures, and classifies image modality is openly available at https://github.com/ncbi-nlp/COVID-19-CT-CXR.
