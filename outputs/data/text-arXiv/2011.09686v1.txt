Abstract
In this paper, we develop an extension of standard epidemiological models, suitable for
COVID-19. This extension incorporates the transmission due to pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic carriers of the virus. Furthermore, this model also captures the spread of the disease due
to the movement of people to/from different administrative boundaries within a country. The
model describes the probabilistic rise in the number of confirmed cases due to the concomitant
effects of (incipient) human transmission and multiple compartments. The associated parameters in the model can help architect the public health policy and operational management of the
pandemic. For instance, this model demonstrates that increasing the testing for symptomatic
patients does not have any major effect on the progression of the pandemic, but testing rate of
the asymptomatic population has an extremely crucial role to play. The model is executed using
the data obtained for the state of Chhattisgarh in the Republic of India. The model is shown
to have significantly better predictive capability than the other epidemiological models. This
model can be readily applied to any administrative boundary (state or country). Moreover, this
model can be applied for any other epidemic as well.

Introduction
The Global Scene

The Novel Coronavirus, or SARS-CoV-2, or as it is commonly called, COVID-19, is spreading
throughout the globe in a rapid pace, and it has already caused destruction of an unprecedented
scale, economically, physically, and socially. The reproducibility of the virus, the proportion of
asymptomatic carrier, the absence of antibodies of the virus in human bodies, and most importantly,
the lack of experience of the people in general in handling such a scenario has majorly contributed
to this catastrophe. At the time of writing this paper, around 29 millions of people are infected
throughout the world, and around 1 million people has already died of the virus. Although the
scale of mortality may not sound extremely catastrophic considering the world population of 7.8

billion, but when one considers this to happen in a time period of 8 months, without showing any
signs of slowing down in most of the world, it becomes a matter of extreme concern and emergency.
A prediction is always an extremely difficult problem in situations like these where enough
data points are not available and there is no history of an outbreak of contagious disease in this
scale. While, in general, standard methods of learning from earlier outbreaks or outbreaks in other
countries can give the researchers a decent head-start, due to various policies adopted by various
governments, tracking the spread of the virus in different countries as a learning mechanism does
not prove to be a fruitful task.

1.2

Background: The case of India

The first documented case of SARS-COV-2 in India was reported on 30 January 2020 in the state
of Kerala. As per the current count, India has the largest number of confirmed cases in Asia, and
has the second highest number of confirmed cases in the world after the United States [1]. The
total number of confirmed cases in India crossed the 100,000 mark on 19 May, 200,000 on 3 June,
and 1,000,000 confirmed cases on 17 July 2020 [2]. The documented mortality rate in India is
among the lowest in the world at around 1.8% as of 29 August 2020 and is showing a monotonically
decreasing trend [2].
India has gone through several restrictive phases in order to contain the spread of the virus.
The first nationwide lockdown was announced on 24 March 2020 for 21 days, and that stopped
all modes of transportation within and outside of the country. On 14 April, India extended the
lockdown till 3 May and that was further continued by two-week extensions starting 3 and 17
May. From 3 May 2020 onwards, the government of India has started to relax the restrictions of
lockdown and allowed migrant workers to return to their home state, officially, for the first time
since 24 March 2020. This is an important moment for this paper, and we have deliberated on this
event later. From 1 June, the government started “unlocking” the country (barring “containment
zones”) in three unlock phases.
The ability to predict the spread of virus beforehand can always be useful in order to be better
prepared, locating clusters of utmost importance, and making policy decisions to contain the virus
till the vaccines come out. A plethora of researchers worldwide are already trying to predict the
spread of the virus in various ways [3, 4, 5]. In this paper, we focus on analyzing the compartmental
epidemiological model with an emphasis on computing the basic reproductive number, commonly
known as R0 . We focus on the following two aspects: (i) Inter-state migration within the country,
(ii) The asymptomatic population. This is by no means meant to be an all-encompassing discussion
of infectious disease modeling but a resource to supplement other more comprehensive texts are,
[6], [7], [8] and [9]. The following section introduces the model that is developed in this paper.

1.3

Introduction to the Model

The SIR epidemic model is a widely used simplest compartmental model was introduced by Kermack and McKendrick (1927) [10]. A compartmental model denotes mathematical modeling of
infectious diseases where the population is separated in various compartments, S, I, or R, (Susceptible, Infectious, or Recovered). In this paper, we have developed an extension of SIR model, again
a compartment based epidemiological model named SINTRUE to track and predict the spread of
the virus and have demonstrated the model by applying it on the data available for the state of
Chhattisgarh in India ∗ . We have sourced our data from the official reports of The Government
of India which is unofficially collated in an open source project called COVID-19 India Project [2].

The model presented in this paper is developed as close to reality as possible, keeping in mind
the different contagion rates from the asymptomatic (interchangeable with pre-symptomatic in this
paper † ) and symptomatic patients, inflow to and outflow from the population due to migration,
possibility of reinfection, and the extent of testing. The model is novel in the aspect of granularity,
and specially in the aspect of considering a dynamic population that is often not considered in
compartment based epidemiological models. This model is shown to be able to provide us with an
estimate of the ‘unseen’ COVID-19 infected patients in the population, and most importantly, the
addition of a compartment of ‘unrecorded’ recovery is able to provide a hint towards the status of
herd immunity of the population. Also, this model, once applied on the data is able to show the
presence of second wave of infection as well. This model has been shown to perform better than
the other epidemiological models for COVID-19, and the results from this model has been able to
provide concrete policy suggestions for healthcare management in the time of the pandemic.
The SINTRUE model comprises of seven compartments in the progression of the disease, with
the addition of an inflow to and an outflow of people from the population. The seven compartments
considered in the model are Susceptible, Infected and pre-symptomatic, Infected and Symptomatic
but Not Tested, Tested Positive, Recorded Recovered, Unrecorded Recovered, and Expired.
The details of the model along with the description of the infection dynamics and the compartments are elaborated in Section 2. Section 3 details the estimation process of the parameters of
the model. Finally, Section 4 concludes with the results and discussions.

The Model

2.1

Developing the model

To incorporate a realistic viewpoint of the dynamics of COVID-19 spread across India, we propose
an extension of SIR type model, with 7 compartmental states. There was interstate movements of
migrant workers during the period of lockdown which was an undeniable part of the vital dynamics,
was considered in only a few previous works [11], but remained a concern for the media and the
governments [12, 13, 14]. In our proposed model, we incorporate this effect of interstate migrant
movement by keeping the total population dynamic, with an incoming population of migrants
divided into three types: Not Infected (Mn ), Pre-Symptomatic (Mp ), and Symptomatically Infected
(Mi ), as well as an outgoing population of migrants from the set of population who are not under
medical surveillance. The part of the incoming migrants who are not infected, pre-symptomatic
or symptomatically infected join the corresponding part of susceptible S, pre-symptomatic Ip and
symptomatic and tested people It compartments at destination. Starting from three compartments
of SIR model[10], we primarily extend it by three aspects:
1. Adding another compartment E concerning the recorded deaths of patients suffering from
COVID-19.
2. Splitting up the group of infectious persons into three compartments.
(a) Pre-symptomatic individuals Ip , who do not show at least one of the primary symptoms of the disease. While in the literature this compartments is popularly known as
†

We have interchangeably used asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic patients here, as our model allows us to put
them in the same compartment as long as they do not show symptoms, and then assign to different compartments
based on if they become symptomatic or remain asymptomatic. We understand that these two words are medically
different, but the construction of the model allows us to use them interchangeably from an epidemiological perspective.

asymptomatic patients [15], we prefer to call this pre-symptomatic going by the analysis of World Health Organization(WHO) [16], which clearly corroborates in favour of
pre-symptomatic transmission rather than truly asymptomatic transmission.
(b) Symptomatic but not tested individuals namely Isn . These are the people who despite
being symptomatic is not under any kind of medical surveillance.
(c) Tested Positive individuals, It . This is the part of the population who are tested positive
for COVID-19 and is under medical surveillance. Hence, the reported figures of COVID19 patients only related to this compartment.
3. Splitting up the group of recovered persons into two compartments.
(a) R, the recorded part of the population recovered from COVID-19.
(b) U , the unrecorded part of the population recovered from COVID-19. These people
have gained immunity from the disease by recovering from it naturally, however, their
situation is not reported to the hospitals, governments or any concerning agencies.
The model is visually explained in fig. 1 along with the corresponding notations. Starting with
the susceptible population, a person might get corona-virus from his/her interaction with a asymptomatic person, as well as a symptomatic person. While there is a natural predilection to avoid
symptomatic persons, such a tendency is not prevalent in interaction with asymptomatic persons
due to lack of evidence through external appearance. Also, there is evidence of difference in transmission for separate viral loads, complex incubation periods and rates of disease progression [17].
Furthermore, as awareness about the disease begin to spread, the general population tend to avoid

4

too many interactions, as well as reduce the exposure time periods. Thus, we take β1t and β2t as
the time varying transmission rates, possibly different, for the interaction between the susceptible
population with the pre-symptomatic Ip and symptomatic not tested Isn population. The implicit
assumption that the transmission rate between susceptible and symptomatic tested population is 0,
can be justified by the fact that the people under medical surveillance is being put under quarantine,
restricted to interact with susceptible population, and health workers interact with these patients
with proper Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) so that the rate of transmissions through these
interactions is negligible.
In addition to these disease transmissions, the transitions between different compartments of
infectious states in our model is based on a single principle. At any point of time, an infectious
person is either recovered naturally, or the disease aggravates to next stage, or the person comes
under medical surveillance, by means of contact tracing. While there is little evidence of evolution
of corona-virus during the time span of the pandemic [18], there were significant changes in testing
strategies [19, 20, 21, 22]. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that the rate concerning with exacerbation of the disease or natural cure of the disease are not time varying as they are related to inherent
biological variables immune to external circumstantial changes, in contrast, the rates concerning the
inclusion of population under medical surveillance should obviously remain a time varying quantity.
Under this logical flow, a pre-symptomatic person in Ip , naturally heals and moves to U following
a counting process with rate λ, or starts to show symptoms (next stage of the disease) following
another independent counting process with rate α, or comes under medical surveillance following
a time varying rate θt . Exactly similar to that, a symptomatic but not tested person Isn naturally
heals and moves to U with rate κ, or the disease proceeds to next stage resulting in death of the
person with rate ζ, or gets tested positive with rate δt .
Finally, similar to SIR model, the people under medical surveillance It , either recovers with rate
γ or becomes deceased with rate τ . We also allow for the possibility of re-infection, by assuming
that a proportion f of the people getting recovered each day, will actually join the susceptible
group instead, due to lack of sufficient antibodies. The complete dynamics of the model can be
mathematically expressed using a set of differential equations as shown in eq. (1)‡ .
‡

Note: This model does not have mass conservation property as we are considering a dynamic population whose
input and output rates are not equal.

Simplifying assumptions

While the general model described in eq. (1) is more close to the reality, it is also very complex
to analyze. In light of the available data, certain assumptions are needed in order to effectively
estimate all the parameters of the model.
The first implicit assumption in the model dynamics is that interactions between different states
of the model can be efficiently modelled by a counting process with the respective rate parameters.
In particular, if we have an arrow from state A to state B with rate θ in fig. 1, then it means the
number of people that moves from state A to state B at any given day is determined by a Poisson
process with parameter θ, in other words, an individual residing in state A moves to state B after
an exponentially distributed number of days, with mean parameter 1/θ.
One crucial assumption that we need to make is that f = 0. This is actually supported by
dearth of strong evidences of reinfection of any recovered patients, with very inconsistent and
sporadic incidents[23, 24, 25]. Next, we take ζ = 0, with the implicit assumption that any deaths
due to COVID-19 will be reported. Also, as we do not have any distinction in the deceased data
about the sources of the deceased (whether they were monitored under medical surveillance prior to
death), we are compelled to make this assumption in order to ensure estimability of the parameters
presented in our model.
In addition to this, we also assume that the transmission rates β1t and β2t differs only by the different exposure time with the susceptible population. Since the type of coronavirus associated with
COVID-19 is relatively new, no significant biological study has yet measured the contagiousness
6

of the virus transmitting from a pre-symptomatic individual apart from a symptomatic individual.
In this regard, a susceptible person in the population can differentiate between a pre-symptomatic
and a symptomatic stranger only on the basis of symptoms that are externally visible like cough,
but not on the basis of symptoms like fever, fatigue, increased blood pressure, low oxygen levels
etc. as they are improbable to perceive from external appearance without any assist of proper
medical instruments. Thus, we may assume β2t = P (Cough)β1t for any t. According to [4], the
rate of symptoms like cough shown along with positive COVID-19 cases is 61.7%, and thus we take
β2t = 0.617β1t as a restrictive assumption in our model.
In order to estimate the transmission rate β1t , we shall assume a specific two parameter family
of curves.
(
a + e−bs if s is before 1st May, 2020
β1t (s) =
(2)
a
otherwise
where a, b are parameters to be estimated. The threshold of 1st May, 2020 is carefully chosen
to distinguish the period that denotes the beginning of official migrant movement [26]. Before
this official migration started, various lockdown enforcement schemes were expected to reduce the
transmission rate continuously. However after 1st May of 2020, various psychological issues among
migrants [27], the difficulty of lockdown enforcements [28, 29], aggressive violence against health
care workers [30] suggests that transmission rate cannot be reduced indefinitely and should remain
constant in a state of partial lockdown.

Estimation of the Model Parameters

We start by delineating the estimation procedure for parameters associated with migrant movement,
i.e c1 , c2 and c3 . The total number of incoming and outgoing migrants can be estimated as in [11].
Note that c3 is essentially the proportion of incoming migrants who are symptomatic and
infected, i.e they have contracted the virus in the origin state and have developed the symptoms
by the time the reached the destination state. We use Destination State to denote the particular
administrative area serving as the destination of the in-migrants. Similarly, Origin State is used
to denote the administrative area from which an in-migrants starts his journey to the Destination
state. Let D denote a destination state and O1 , · · · , On denote n origin states.
Let
P (Oi is the Origin state | D is the destination state) = mi

,

i = 1(1)n

P (Active cases of Out-Migrants in state Oi ) = Ai

,

i = 1(1)n

Let mD = (mi )i=1(1)n and AD = (Ai )i=1(1)n . Then we estimate c3 by estimated proportion of
reported Covid-19-positive people among incoming migrants in each day. Thus,
cb3 =

n
X

mi Ai = mTD AD

i=1

We do not yet have a origin-state-specific segregation vector of Migrants entering a destination
state each day- normalizing which would have yielded mD . But we have a data§ , on what
proportion of Infected Incoming Migrants are from which Origin state. We use that vector as

D . This is because, considering the relatively large number of total migrant influx compared to
infected migrant influx (i.e belonging to state It ), and more or less large number of infections in all
the significant origin states, we can assume that the infection among in-migrants in independent of
the origin state. Mathematically this assumption can be written as
P ( Origin state = Oi | Infected in-migrant ) = P ( Origin state = Oi | In-migrant )
This assumption validates m
d
D as an estimate of mD .
We estimate AD by assuming that the Other States and/or Unassigned/Unknown column in the
data provided by Covid19India dashboard [2] corresponds to migrant people. We have an estimate
Mi , i = 1(1)n for the Total number of migrants likely to move, as in [11]. Let at time point t, the
total number of Unassigned cases in Origin
 state Oi be denoted as (Ai )t .
(A1 )t (A2 )t
(An )t
Let At =
,
,··· ,
. Then, c3 at time point t is estimated as:
M1
M2
Mn
T
cb3t = m
d
D At

To compute c2 we note that those incoming migrants who are undetected would have contracted the
disease during the journey with fellow migrants. Thus at time point t, a symptomatic migrant from
origin state Oi would infect on an average (Ri )t people, where Ri denote the day-wise reproduction
number of the i-th origin state. We use EpiEstim package[31] to obtain these reproduction numbers.
Let Rt = ((R1 )t , , · · · , (Rn )t )T . Then c2 at time point t is estimated as:
cb2t = (d
mD
where

At )T Rt

denote the Hadamard Product i.e element-wise multiplication. Finally, we obtain;
cb1 = 1 − cb2 − cb3

Now we move on to estimating other parameters. Once we assume that f = 0 and ζ = 0, the
differential equations described the changes of the states E and R simplifies to;
dR
= γIt

dE
= τ It

Since the periodically released data by Indian government [32], along with their historical records
by Covid19India group [2] contains records of recovered, deceased and current number of hospidR dE
talized covid patients, the quantities

From the testing strategy mentioned in [22], it is evident that pre-symptomatic people are
getting tested only if they are traced as high-risk contacts of a confirmed case. In other words,
a pre-symptomatic person would be tested if any person that he / she had contacted for last few
days has coronavirus and is tested positive. Now, turning our attention to a single asymptomatic
person, let N be a random variable denoting the number of contacts that the person had in past
few days. Assume a Poisson distribution for N with mean parameter Nc . Now note that,
Number of symptomatic contacts | N ∼ Bin (N, ps )
and similarly,
Number of asymptomatic contacts | N ∼ Bin (N, pa )
where ps and pa denotes these probabilities for an individuals to be symptomatic or presymptomatic given that he/she is not already tested. Note that both of these random variables are
independent of each other and also the unconditional distribution of number of symptomatic (or
asymptomatic) contacts is Poisson distributed with mean parameter given by product of Nc and
the corresponding binomial success probability. Thus,
e−θt d = P(The person gets tested in ≥ d days)
= P(all symptomatic and asymptomatic contacts gets tested in ≥ d days)

≈ exp [−(Nc pa θt + Nc ps δt )d] ,

assuming the respective quantities are small

which finally implies; θt ≈ Nc (pa θt + ps δt ). To obtain the probabilities pa and ps , it follows
from the model that a plug-in estimator would be Ip /(Nt − It − E − R) and Isn /(Nt − It − E − R),
which is basically the ratio of the corresponding pre-symptomatic (or symptomatic) individuals in
the population and the individuals not under any kind of medical surveillance (i.e. they are at risk
of getting tested). However, since (Ip θt + Isn δt ) is the total number of individuals getting tested
on day t (see eq. (1)), the estimating equation for θt simplifies to;
θt ≈

Nc
∆(It + E + R)
(Nt − It − E − R)

(5)

A quick interpretation of the above estimating equation is that, when ∆(It + E + R) new
individuals are tested positive on day t, by means of contact tracing, on average Nc × ∆(It + E + R)
many individuals will be tested for the disease next day. Thus, an pre-symptomatic individual, who
is very similar to a healthy individual in external factors would have the same rate of being selected
at the testing as the ratio of Nc × ∆(It + E + R) and remaining population (Nt − It − E − R). Since
Nc is an unknown parameter, we take it as the average number of high risk contacts traced (and
tested for covid) per covid patients who are tested positive.
Focusing on the testing rate δt for the symptomatic individuals, we again use the assumption
that the diffusion from Isn occurs according to independent Poisson processes with corresponding
rates, and thus at any point of time T , the probability that a symptomatic individual will get tested

9

before he/she recovers (or dies) is;

On the other hand, a simple application of Bayes Rule enables us to write the probability as;
P(Tested | Symptomatic and has covid)
P(Tested and Symptomatic and has covid)
=
P(Symptomatic and has covid)
P(Symptomatic | Tested and has covid)P(Tested and has covid)
=
P(Symptomatic and has covid)
P(Symptomatic | Tested and has covid)P(Tested and has covid)
=
P(Symptomatic | Covid)P(has covid)

(6)

From the patient database available from Chattishgarh government, it was possible to obtain the number of symptomatic people among those who are tested positive for COVID-19, thus
enabling us to obtain estimate of P(Symptomatic | Tested and has covid). Also, the quantity
P(Tested and has covid) can be estimated from the number of samples tested for COVID-19. Note
that, the estimates for the quantities in the denominator cannot be obtained in the context of the
particular country in study, since only the data pertaining to the tested individuals will be collected.
However, Siordia [4] reported the rate of different symptoms seen along with COVID-19 patients,
which can be used to estimate P(Symptomatic | Covid) based on the definition of symptomatic
person as an infected individual showing all of the primary 3 symptoms, namely fever, cough and
fatigue. This turns out to be, P(Symptomatic | Covid) = (0.822 × 0.617 × 0.44) = 0.22315656.
To estimate the true prevalence P(has covid), we consider to use the data of countries like South
Korea, United Arab Emirates as a reference frame, since these countries perform most of the tests
in relative to their population [33]. The estimates of test positivity rates for these countries ranges
between 2.5% to 5% on average. Some studies [34] shows that the prevalence of COVID-19 among
the health workers who are high-risk contacts stand somewhere close to 5%. Turning our attention
to the available data, the prevalence among the high risk contacts who are tested stand at 4.229%
for Chattishgarh and 8.642% for the whole India. Naturally, it is apparent that the true prevalence
would be lower than 4.229%, but it needs to be estimated in a proper way. Let us denote this true
prevalence as , which we shall also estimate in the light of available data.
Assuming the knowledge of  and κ, we can obtain a plug-in estimate for δt , as ζ = 0 by
assumption and

where the probability function can be evaluated using eq. (6) using the knowledge of the true
prevalence  at the discrete timepoints, and then a numerical differentiation can be performed to
obtain the time-varying rate δt .
Turning our attention to estimation of the transmission rate, due to eq. (2), it follows that the
knowledge of a, b will enable one to estimate β1t and thus in turn β2t as 0.617β1t . Thus with a specific
choice of α, λ, κ, , a, b, it is possible to obtain the time varying parameters β1t , β2t , δt . Combining
these with the already obtained estimates θt , τ, γ and time varying estimates regarding migrant
movements c1 , c2 , c3 , it is possible to simulate the whole system by solving the set of differential
10

equations eq. (1) numerically. Denoting φ = (α, λ, κ, , a, b), in order to obtain an estimate of the
parameter φ ∈ Φ ⊆ R6 where Φ denotes the underlying parameter space, we consider the following
criterion.

L(φ) = wI LI (φ) + wR LR (φ) + wE LE (φ) + wsymp Lsymp (φ) + wasymp Lasymp (φ) + winf Linf (φ) (8)
where w’s are some specifically chosen weights and;

The above loss functions measure difference in the the simulated counts and the real counts
from the available data. For instance, LI (φ), LR (φ), LE (φ) measures the discrepancy between the
available data of the number of infected, recovered, deceased individuals and the number of infected,
recovered, deceased individuals obtained from the numerical solution to eq. (1) with the choice of
the parameters φ. On the other hand, Lsymp (φ) and Lasymp (φ) measures the discrepancy between
the obtained data on the number of new symptomatic and pre-symptomatic patients tested positive
on each day, with that of the theoretical counterparts θt Ip and δt Isn respectively. Finally, at the
most recent timepoint T with available data, (1 − )Nt , which denotes the number of individuals
without COVID-19 virus (since  is the true prevalence of COVID-19), is matched against the
number of susceptible population S. The best fitting parameters φb is obtained by minimizing L(φ).
However, in order to circumvent numerical underflow or overflow and convergence related issues
due to the possibility of non-convex optimization with numerous local minima, we decided to use
grid search algorithm to find the best φ which minimizes log L(φ). The weights in eq. (8) are
chosen carefully by performing a cross validation to minimize prediction sum of squares, in order
to normalize each of the individual loss functions in the same range to make them comparable, so
that all the loss functions are minimized simultaneously when minimizing log L(φ).

Results & Discussion

All the subsequent results are based on the available data as of August 22, 2020 collected from
different official[32] and unofficial sources[2].

Based on the robust regression type approach to estimate fatality rate τ and recovery rate γ,
we use MASS package[35] in R programming language to obtain these estimates. From the historical
data on confirmed, active, recovered and deceased cases for each state, available at [2], we obtain
the estimates of τ and γ for some of the major states in India. The estimates are shown in table 1.
The fit of the robust regression type approach is shown in fig. 2.

Figure 2: Goodness of fit for regression based approach to estimation of fatality and recovery rate
for Maharashtra
It seems that fig. 2 shows a reasonably good linear relationship between the numerical derivative
of deceased and recovered cases, and the number of active cases, except a few outlying datapoints,
which also suggests one possible reason for using a robust version of linear regression.
Considering the migrant population, the total number of incoming and outgoing migrants can
be estimated as in [11]. In case of Chhattishgarh, it was found that about 49.36% of migrants come
from Maharashtra, while migrants from Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Telangana, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu,
Haryana, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh constitutes more than 90% of the incoming migrants. Thus
when performing the estimation of parameters related to migrant movement, the reproduction
number of these states, the number of special trains that connect Chhattisgarh to any of these
states, the worker’s population at the major cities of those states are taken into consideration.
Based on the detailed estimation process described before, the time varying proportion of new
incoming migrants based on different groups i.e. c1 , c2 , c3 are estimated. Corresponding results for
Chhattisgarh in shown in fig. 3. The results show an overall decreasing pattern in c1 , while similar
12

increasing pattern in c2 , c3 . Interestingly, a week before official migration started, the proportions
c1 , c2 becomes non-negative, which could be a possible indication of unofficial migrant movement.
A sharp increase in c2 and c3 is also noticeable from mid-June, which was possibly a lagged effect
of “Unlock-1.0” declared by Govt. of India[36].

Figure 3: Estimated parameters pertinent to migration movement in Chhattisgarh
Now turning our attention to the estimation of θt based on eq. (5), an important component
to estimation of θt is the choice of Nc , the average number of contacts per day. Previous studies
such as Mossong et al.[37] show that under natural circumstances, the average number of contacts
of a person per day is 13.4 with a varying distribution of mean number of contacts in different
countries and in different regions with different socio-economic strata. Because of the skewness in
the distribution of number of contacts, national lockdown restrictions and overall awareness about
the disease spread, it is natural to assume that the average number of contacts is smaller than
13.4. However, a more recent and relevant study by Leung et al.[38] shows that average number
of reported contacts in relevance to spread of a respiratory illness is much lower, ranges from 5.12
to 8.21 over different age groups and socio-economic stratum, with overall mean being 6.93. In
addition, from the official contact tracing data of Chhattisgarh, we have obtained that there were
23007 primary contacts who are traced from 3257 positive cases of covid patients, thereby suggesting
an estimate of Nc as 23007/3257 ≈ 7.0638. Since this matches nearly with the conclusions presented
in [38], we take Nc = 7.0638 in our model and estimate θt using eq. (5). Similarly, minimizing eq. (8)
13

enables us to find the optimized parameter κ, which in turn can be used to obtain the time varying
testing rate for symptomatic individuals using eq. (7). The obtained estimated are shown in fig. 4.
Although the estimated rates are highly correlated and shows similar patterns, the different in the
magnitude depicts the fact that ceteris paribus, tracing a symptomatic individual and probability
of him/her getting tested is about 7 − 8 times as high as the same for a pre-symptomatic individual.
However, while about 85 − 90% of the new patients who are tested positive in Chhattisgarh are
pre-symptomatic or mildly symptomatic, and as θt is estimated to be very small, it must be the
case that the pool of pre-symptomatic individuals Ip must be enormously high.

Figure 4: Time varying tested rate for pre-symptomatic and symptomatic individuals
Upon minimizing the error criterion eq. (8), the estimated parameters in case of Chhattisgarh
are obtained and presented in table 2. The fitted estimates for the time series variable of number
of hospitalized It and number of recoveries R are shown in fig. 5 to be compared against the actual
observed values. Here, we use only the available data upto August 1, 2020 and use the estimated
parameters to perform a short term prediction upto August 22, 2020 to check the validity of our
estimation process. From fig. 5, it is clear that the estimation for the number of hospitalized and
recovered patients seems sufficiently reasonable.
One of the most important quantity to consider in epidemiological studies is the reproduction
number R0 . It denotes the number of secondary infection spread by an infected person on average.
In our model, the population of infected individual is divided into three groups, Ip , Isn and It ,
all of whom has different transmission and recovery rates. In the model described in eq. (1), the
reproduction number R0 can be calculated as;
Ip (t)
R0 (t) =
Ip (t) + Isn (t) + It (t)



β1t (t)
θt (t) + α + λ



Isn (t)
+
Ip (t) + Isn (t) + It (t)



β2t (t)
δt (t) + κ + ζ


(9)

The expression in eq. (9) basically takes the reproduction number corresponding to each of the
group of infected individuals and then take a weighted average of them commensurate to the size of
the groups. It should be noted that the transmission rate is assumed to be equal to 0 (or negligible)
in case of hospitalized patients on the basis of complete effectiveness of quarantine protocols. In
order to validate our model estimation procedure, we use EpiEstim package [31] in R to estimate
time varying reproduction rate independently and compare the estimates against our estimates of
R0 for the state Chhattisgarh. Results are shown in fig. 6. Clearly, the prediction resembles closely
overall, except in the month of July, where our estimate of R0 is slightly higher than the estimates

In order to be able to perform long term prediction, we use ARIMA model with seasonality
to perform prediction of the time varying parameters like θt , δt . Akaike’s Information criterion
was chosen in order to obtain the best fitting ARIMA model. Also, in the current state of partial
lockdown, it is reasonable to assume that the β1t is not likely to vary considerably in near future, and
is, therefore, taken as the constant b = 0.102 throughout the period of prediction. Figure 7 shows
the long term prediction for next 8 months of the number of pre-symptomatic (Ip ), symptomatic
(Is n), hospitalized (It ) and recorded recovered (R) patients.
To compute a confidence interval for the predictions, we rely on the prediction confidence
intervals obtained from the ARIMA model prediction of time varying parameters. For each of the
time varying parameters, we consider the upper and lower bounds of the 95% confidence interval
for them. Then, for each combination of these boundary values, the model is simulated to the end
of the prediction regime. With 4 independent time varying parameters such as θt , δt , c2 , c3 , and one

Explanation
On average, about 1.13% of all symptomatic individuals recover from COVID-19 naturally every day. Compared to
that, 1.5% of all symptomatic individuals actually get tested
positive every day as seen in fig. 4.
Different studies and reports[16] shows that average incubation period is about 4−5 days. This means about 4.8% to 6%
of newly infected pre-symptomatic individuals are expected
to develop symptoms, before getting tested or naturally recovered.
About 7.9% of the newly infected pre-symptomatic (or
mildly symptomatic) individuals are expected to naturally
recover from the disease.
Tranmission rates decreased by a significant rate during the
lockdown enforcement and before official permit of migration
movements.
Current transmission rate shows only 10.2% of all interactions with pre-symptomatic individuals could expose the
susceptible individual to the virus.
On average, about 0.12% of the hospitalized cases turn to
fatality every day.
On average, about 7.29% of the hospitalized cases turn to
recoveries every day.
The true prevalence of COVID-19 is approximately 1.95%,
thus affecting more than 6 lakhs individuals among the 3.2
crore population of Chhattisgarh.

Table 2: Estimates of the parameters of our model for Chhattisgarh
dependent time varying parameter c1 = (1 − c2 − c3 ), we thus create 16 such prediction scenarios,
assuming other parameters to be fixed as their estimated values. Finally, the daywise minimum
and maximum of all such prediction scenarios were taken in order to obtain an approximate 95%
confidence interval of the predictions.
Interestingly, fig. 7 shows that an indication of a small primary wave in April 2020, which then
ends during middle of May, 2020. This could serve as an indication of the effectiveness of various
lockdown enforcement schemes imposed by Govt. of India. However, the second wave starting
from middle of May, 2020 could serve as an indication of increasing migrant movements in India,
thus, creating the opportunity of more detrimental and imminent second wave in the virus spread.
While it is clear that the number of pre-symptomatic infected individuals will rise considerably to
approximately 2 lakhs, the effect on the hospitalization rate will remain much lower, within a range
of 25-30 thousands.
We also perform a simple sensitivity analysis to find the importance of each of the parameters
in prediction. The estimates of fatality Rate τ̂ and recovery rate γ̂ turns out to be extremely
robust and subtle changes to the estimates given in table 2 affects only the number of individuals
in deceased state (E) and recovered state (R). The estimate of κ affects primarily the Ip and
Isn states, and to some extent the prediction of It as well. Increasing κ to 0.15 drops decreases
Ip and Isn both by 32%, while it slightly increases It , R and E states by 4%. The effect of α is

Figure 7: Long term prediction of pre-symptomatic, symptomatic, hospitalized, medically recovered
(recorded) patients for Chhattisgarh along with 95% confidence intervals
fairly robust as long as α lies between 0.006 and 0.018 which incorporates about 50% change over
current estimate of α. However, with α being relatively high like 0.05 or more, the estimates of
Isn and It increase rapidly. We found that the estimates of λ and a are pretty sensitive, and these
directly affect the shape of the incidence curve of Ip and Isn . We found that, about 7% change of
these estimates retains the similar shape with two phases of covid spread as shown in fig. 7. The
estimate of b, and the migrant related parameters like c1 , c2 , c3 , has subtle effects on the change of
Ip and It . An increase in b increases each of Ip , Isn and It slightly and add a lagged effect towards
increment of U, E and R; An increase in c1 , c2 increases Ip and c3 increases the incidence curve It .
The time varying parameters θt and δt (the testing rate for asymptomatic and symptomatic
patients, respectively) have a similar significant contribution to the prediction. A change in δt is
found to affect only the recorded hospitalized (It ) and symptomatic (Isn ) cases, while a change in θt
is found to correlate with hospitalized (It ) and pre-symptomatic (Ip ) cases. In case of Chattisgarh,
increasing θt by 10% reduces the peak of pre-symptomatic cases by about 7.2% while increasing
the peak of hospitalized cases by about 9.8%. However, as most of the detected covid cases are
asymptomatic (pre-symptomatic) or mildly symptomatic in nature, an increase in δt turns out to
be fairly robust, only decreasing Isn by 2.3%, and increasing It even lesser, 1.3%. Furthermore, we
have seen that a change in δt has minimal effect on the public health aspect of the disease, i.e. size
of the peak, proportion of population affected etc. On the other hand, the size of the peak and the
duration of the disease in the population is seen to be extremely sensitive to θt . We elaborate on
this more in the concluding section.

Comparison with existing models

We have performed two comparative studies to see the performance in prediction of our model in
comparison with the existing models in the literature like extended SIR model(eSIR) proposed by
Song et al. [3] and SIDARTHE model proposed by Giordano et al. [5].
To compare the SINTRUE model with the eSIR model as presented in Song et al. [3], both
models are fitted to the data from the state of Chhattisgarh upto August 15, 2020, and using the
estimated parameters, the number of Reported Active cases and Recorded Recovered cases upto
September 5, 2020 were predicted. As a measure of deviation from the truth, Root Mean Square
Error (RMSE) in prediction is used, and is found to be 4865.11 for the prediction of Reported Active

of Active and Recovered cases respectively. Figure 8 shows the comparative figures for predicted
and observed cases for Active and Recovered cases for both the models. From Figure 8, we see
that eSIR model consistently underestimates the number of recorded active cases and overestimates
the number of recorded recovered cases. In comparison, SINTRUE model depicts highly accurate
prediction for recorded recovered cases, and slightly better prediction for recorded active cases,
however, the problem of underestimation still persists.

Figure 9: Prediction of SIDARTHE(left) and SINTRUE(right) model from March 13, 2020 to
September 5, 2020 for Italy assuming no migration movement
In order to assess comparative performance of the SIDARTHE model with SINTRUE model,
we consider Italy’s similar to Giordano et al. [39]. However, there was very little trustworthy data
about migration situation in Italy [40], which compelled us to reformulate SINTRUE model into a

=

closed population model with c1 = c2 = c3 = 0, and in particular
dt
dt
upto March 12 from various sources [41, 42] SINTRUE model with closed population is trained and a
prediction is made from March 13, 2020 to September 5, 2020 for the active cases. In comparison,
among the different scenarios for prediction presented in Giordano et al. [39], we find that the
scenario with slightly stronger lockdown and social distancing effect is found to yield a better
alignment with the observed incidence curve, compared to the minimal social distancing scenario
suggested in the paper. So, the parameter values presented in Giordano et al. [39] with mildly
stronger social distancing is chosen. For the SIDARTHE model, the RMSE is found to be 27477.46
while the RMSE with SINTRUE model’s prediction is found to be slightly lesser 24768.48. Figure
9 reveal finer details. On the left panel, the SIDARTHE model starts by almost exact prediction,
but soon diverges out, giving especially bad prediction near the tail. It also underestimates the
peak of the pandemic, which might affect any policy decisions using this model. On the right
18

panel, SINTRUE model provides an excellent estimate both at the start, i.e on short term basis
and at the tail of the prediction curve, i.e on long term basis. Its nearly comparable MSE with the
SIDARTHE model is accounted by the overestimation at the peak, which can be thought of as an
upper bound to the peak number of affected cases, thereby helping policy formulations. Further,
the SINTRUE model manages to altogether replicate the shape of the actual curve based on data
only upto March 12, whereas the shape predicted by SIDARTHE model is not nearly correct. This
is expected, since unlike the SINTRUE model, SIDARTHE model doesn’t use any time-varying
parameters, rendering it unsuitable for long-term predictions where the parameter values are liable
to change.

Conclusion

The model presented in this paper comprises seven compartments in the progression of the disease,
with the addition of an inflow to and an outflow of people from the population. Further, we have
incorporated the pre-symptomatic /asymptomatic population in the model as well as the population
who get the virus but remain undetected throughout their journey from being infected to being
recovered. The seven compartments considered in the model are Susceptible, Infected and presymptomatic, Infected and Symptomatic but Not Tested, Tested Positive, Recorded Recovered,
Unrecorded Recovered, and Expired.
One extremely important observation that we make from the SINTRUE model and the subsequent simulation is, the testing rate of symptomatic patients actually does not affect the disease
dynamics in any major way. Rather, it is the testing rate of the asymptomatic patients that turn
out to be an extremely crucial parameter that can make or break the fight against the pandemic.
The dynamic is extremely sensitive against the testing rate of the asymptomatic patients and once
the rate goes up, the R0 comes down drastically. The current R0 indicates that around 23.664%
(of Chhattisgarh) of the population needs to be affected in order to reach herd immunity [43, 44].
Hence, as a result of our model, one definitive suggestion we can make is that in order to fight the
pandemic, one has to scale up their efforts on testing the asymptomatic patients. The increase in θt
can be achieved by either increasing the Nc in our model, which will mean an increase in the contact
tracing endeavour, or to start allowing on-demand testing. Both of these strategies will increase θt
and will bring down the peak considerably. As for the case of India, until September 4, India did
not have a provision for people for getting themselves tested without any valid reason (symptoms,
contacts etc.) and without being prescribed by a medical practitioner [22]. From September 4
onwards [45], India has changed the testing strategy to permit anyone to get tested without any
reason or prescription. We believe that this will have a direct positive impact on the asymptomatic
testing rate θt and this can heavily affect the progression of the disease in a positive manner.
The advantage of the SINTRUE model is that the estimation for the parameter associated with
extinct and recovery flow are pretty straightforward. Further, the estimation of the parameter
to understand population movement from “Asymptomatic” to “Tested Positive” is obtained even
without knowing the prevalence rate. This directly informs us that just looking at the rates of
’confirmed’ cases, we cannot readily make a judgment about the prevalence of the disease in the
population.
To understand the infection of susceptible populations from the asymptotic or symptomatic
population, we choose the values a and b. The choice of parameters λ (the rate of naturally healing
population without getting detected), a, and b control the shape of the incidence curve in a way that
can give a realization of the second wave of COVID-19 or third wave scenarios. So, one advantage
the model has is having a much broader range of incidence curves and from a realized incidence

19

curve, a direct idea on the transmission rate can be arrived upon. On the downside, the grid
search at the end requires heavy computation (although the codes may be optimized further). It
certainly requires a good amount of granular data (like the recorded ration of pre-symptomatic and
symptomatic patients, etc.). Based on the available data for one of India’s states, i.e. Chhattisgarh,
the results discussed in detail in § 4 suggest that the parameters estimated with the migration and
asymptomatic certainly can help in designing the COVID-19 control policy.
The predictability of the model suggested in this paper is also compared (in § 4.1) with the
the extended SIR model (eSIR) proposed by Song et al. [3] and SIDARTHE model proposed by
Giordano et al. [5]. The predictability of proposed model in this paper is significantly better
based on the performance measurement criteria of root mean squared error (RMSE) and the longterm predictability. The results obtained from the model represented in this paper have shown
significantly better predictive capability compared to other newly developed models of COVID-19
progression, when applied on the data of Chhattisgarh State (India) and Italy. Further, this model
could be thought out to extend as the aggregate model for the whole country, as the country when
virtually under lock-down from May 2020, we can consider that on a state-wise aggregated form;
dN
the model can exhibit mass conservation property as
will essentially be 0 for the country.
dt
We can show that given the initial states sum up to one, in the nationwide model’s equilibrium
state, the disease actually dies down. There will only be Susceptible, Recovered (documented or
undocumented), and extinct people in the system at the equilibrium, which will mean that the
epidemic (in the sense of the pandemic being treated only within the country) is over. This state
will be reached eventually, but in order to speed that up, the recommendation from the SINTRUE
model is that we have to change the testing policy to cover as much of the population as possible,
and then only the spread can be arrested.
