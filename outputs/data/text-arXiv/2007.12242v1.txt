Abstract
The recent global pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the new coronavirus
SARS-CoV-2 presents an urgent need for new therapeutic candidates. Many efforts have been devoted
to screening existing drug libraries with the hope to repurpose approved drugs as potential treatments
for COVID-19. However, the antiviral mechanisms of action for the drugs found active in these
phenotypic screens are largely unknown. To deconvolute the viral targets for more effective anti-COVID19 drug development, we mined our in-house database of approved drug screens against 994 assays
and compared their activity profiles with the drug activity profile in a cytopathic effect (CPE) assay of
SARS-CoV-2. We found that the autophagy and AP-1 signaling pathway activity profiles are significantly
correlated with the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity profile. In addition, a class of neurology/psychiatry drugs
was found significantly enriched with anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. Taken together, these results have
provided new insights into SARS-CoV-2 infection and potential targets for COVID-19 therapeutics.

Introduction
In late fall 2019, a new Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged from Wuhan, China. It is caused
by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). SARS-CoV-2 appears to be highly
contagious, and a lack of immunity in the human population has resulted in rapid spread across the
globe. As of June 28rd, 2020, it has infected over 10 million people, killed over 500,000 people, and
caused abrupt disruption of social and economic activity across the world (https://covid19.who.int/).

Currently, there is no effective treatment for COVID-19. Drug development typically takes 12-16 years
and costs US$1-2 billion to bring a new drug to market1. Preventative approaches such as vaccines and
antibodies could also take years to develop. Given that treatments for patients infected with SARS-CoV2 are needed immediately, repurposing existing drugs and clinical investigational drugs to treat COVID19 is an attractive strategy. This approach takes advantage of known human pharmacokinetic and safety
profiles of drugs, which allow rapid initiation of human clinical trials or direct use for treatments.
Remdesivir is a good example of such effort to treat COVID-19. Remdesivir was originally developed for
RNA viruses and was then tested in a clinical trial against Ebola virus infection during the 2016 outbreak
2,3

. After remdesivir was shown to be active against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro4, clinical trials have been rapidly

conducted. In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial carried out by the National Institutes
of Health (NIH), remdesivir was demonstrated effective in reducing the recovery time from 15 days to 11
days in hospitalized COVID-19 patients5. On May 1st, 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for the investigational antiviral drug remdesivir for the
treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. While many clinical trials are still ongoing and are showing
promising results (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=COVID-19), some repurposing efforts have
had disappointing or controversial outcomes, for example, those for lopinavir-ritonavir6,
hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), and chloroquine (CQ)7,8.

Other than an intuitive repurposing approach based on a known mechanism (such as the recent positive
reports of dexamethasone for modulating inflammatory response in COVID19)9, an unbiased and
systematic screening of approved drug or clinical investigational drugs might discover additional
therapeutic options. Multiple sites 10-14, including our center (The National Center for Advancing
Translational Sciences, NCATS), are screening approved drug and mechanistically annotated libraries to
identify new therapeutics. To rapidly share the screening results and accelerate the drug repurposing
process, NCATS has posted all screening data on an online database (Open Science Data Portal of COVID-

19) (https://opendata.ncats.nih.gov/covid19/index.html) that is freely available to the public15. In most
antiviral drug repurposing efforts, the most scalable assay used for screening in biological safety level-3
laboratories is a phenotypic assay, measuring the cytopathic effect (CPE) of SARS-CoV-2 virus on Vero E6
cells infected for 72 hours. If compounds have antiviral activity, Vero E6 cells are rescued from the CPE.
While there are many drugs with known targets/mechanisms of action for their approved indications,
the targets or mechanisms of their antiviral activity are largely unknown, be it against a host of viral
target 10-14. It is thus crucial to better understand their antiviral mechanisms to facilitate further drug
development.

The NCATS Pharmaceutical Collection (NPC) 16 is a library of ~3,000 drugs approved for marketing in the
US (FDA), Europe (EMA), Canada, Australia, and/or Japan (PMDA). The library was specifically created to
enable drug repurposing and has been screened at NCATS in nearly 1,000 assays in concentrationresponse (quantitative high throughput screening, qHTS), encompassing a wide range of disease targets
and pathways with main disease areas covered including rare and neglected diseases, infectious
diseases and cancer. Here, we leveraged this unique dataset to compare activity across SARS-CoV-2 CPE
screening data (both from NCATS and published elsewhere) 6,14,17-21 with historical in house NPC qHTS
data. Correlations were performed to identify assays with patterns of activity similar to that of the SARSCoV-2 CPE assay.

Results
Mining qHTS data reveals interesting anti-SARS-CoV-2 targets: Autophagy and AP-1 signaling
Screening compounds using phenotypic assays, such as the CPE assay, has identified compounds that
inhibited cell death caused by the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Comparing the NPC compound activity profile
in each of the ~1000 screens performed previously on various targets with the activity profile against
SARS-CoV-2 may help identify targets of the compounds with anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity, and provide
important clues to the underlying targets and mechanisms of the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. Assays
with activity profiles which resemble that of SARS-CoV-2 could serve as targets for the development of
new COVID-19 therapies. Toward this goal, we collected compounds reported as active from recent antiCOVID-19 repurposing screens using the SARS-CoV-2 CPE assay14,17,18 and drugs proposed by the
scientific community as potential COVID-19 therapies.10,19-21 Activities of these compounds were used as
a “probe signature” to compare with the activity profiles of all other assays (Figure 1(a)). Compound

activity was represented by “curve rank”,22,23 a numeric measure between -9 and 9 based on potency,
efficacy, and the quality of the concentration response curve, such that a large positive number
indicates a strong activator, a large negative number indicates a strong inhibitor, and 0 means inactive.
Activity profile similarity was measured by the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (r) with a p-value
calculated for the significance of correlation (Figure 2).
The activity profiles from an autophagy assay (r = 0.47, p<1×10-20)24 and an AP-1 signaling pathway assay
(r = 0.37, p<1×10-20)25 exhibited the most significant correlations with that of the SARS-CoV-2 screen
(Figure 1(b)). Interestingly, two other antiviral assays, an Ebola virus-like particle entry assay (EBOV) (r =
0.39, p<1×10-20)26 and a MERS pseudo particle entry assay (r = 0.28, p<1×10-20),27 were also among the
most significantly correlated assays with activity profiles that highly resemble that of the SARS-CoV-2
CPE assay (Figure 1(b)). As MERS belongs to the same family of beta-coronaviruses as SARS-CoV-2, this
finding can serve as a validation of our approach.28-30 Moreover, remdesivir, an antiviral drug active
against Ebola was recently found effective against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro assays and approved for treating
hospitalized COVID-19 patients.5,31 This is consistent with our finding that a significant number (118) of
drugs including remdesivir that showed anti-Ebola activity also showed activity in the SARS-CoV-2 CPE
assay, suggesting some shared drug targets (either viral target or cellular targets) between EBOV and
SARS-CoV-2autophagy and AP-1 assays were combined, i.e., a compound was counted as active if it was
active in either one of these assays and inactive otherwise, the sensitivity in picking up SARS-CoV-2
actives increased to 0.85 with an improved BA of 0.81. This suggests that the targets in these two assays
are different and either autophagy or AP-1 could only account for one mechanism in targeting SARSCoV-2, thus combining the two pathways might increase the likelihood of identifying drugs that could
target SARS-CoV-2 through different mechanisms.
A list of the most potent compounds (<20 µM) in the AP-1 assay and their corresponding activities in the
autophagy and SARS-CoV-2 CPE assays are provided in Table 2. These drugs could be considered for
further anti-COVID-19 development. Concentration-response curves of exemplar compounds that were
active in all three assays are shown in Figure 3.
Enrichment of neuroactive drugs in anti-SARS-CoV-2 and AP-1 active compounds
Another interesting phenomenon we observed is that a large number of compounds active in the SARSCoV-2 CPE assay are psychoactive drugs. We next investigated the statistical significance of this finding.
There were 359 drugs annotated as neurology/psychiatry drugs tested in the SARS-CoV-2 CPE assay. We

found that 74 of them are active (21%) (Supplementary Table 1), whereas only 8% of the drugs not in
this category were active in the SARS-CoV-2 CPE assay, corresponding to a 2.6-fold enrichment of actives
in the neuroactive drugs. This enrichment is statistically significant (Fisher’s exact test: p= 2.41×10-11). To
check whether this phenomenon only occurs in this class of drugs, we also examined five other common
drugs classes, including infectious disease, cardiology, endocrinology, gastroenterology, and oncology.
We found that none of these classes were significantly enriched with the anti-SARS-CoV-2 active
compounds (Figure 4). The results suggest possible connections between the psychoactive drugs and
the targets/pathways related to SARS-CoV-2 infection or replication in host cells.

Discussion
To deconvolute the viral targets for more effective anti-COVID-19 drug development, we compared the
compound activity profiles from our historical qHTS data with recent SARS-CoV-2 CPE assay data. We
found that activities against autophagy and AP-1 significantly correlated with anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity.
We also found strong correlations between SARS-CoV-2 and other antiviral assays such as MERS-CoV
pseudo particle entry. It is intuitive given that both are zoonotic beta-coronaviruses with similar
genomes and a common cellular entry mechanism. Since the identification of SARS-CoV-2, multiple
agents shown to be active against MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV over the past 15 years have been tested and
demonstrated to retain activity against SARS-CoV-2. The analysis here of independent assays performed
years apart reinforces this observation.
Autophagy and endocytosis are interconnected cellular pathways for the degradation and recycling of
intracellular and extracellular components, respectively. The two pathways interact and interdepend on
each other, sharing some molecular machinery32. The autophagy/endocytosis pathway has been
implicated in the entry of coronavirus into host cells, including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV212,33. In our recent study, a small number of autophagy modulators were tested to clarify whether the
activity of CQ/HCQ was related to its autophagy modulatory properties, and a number of active
compounds were confirmed in the CPE assay12. Here, our unbiased comparison of the SARS-CoV-2 CPE
assay with approximately 1,000 NCATS qHTS assays targeting various drugs targets and diseases found a
significant correlation with an autophagy assay screened against the NPC library several years earlier,
further validating our data mining approach. Targeting the autophagy pathway has been tested in
clinical trials for curbing COVID-19. For example, CQ and HCQ are antimalaria drugs and known
autophagy inhibitors. HCQ/CQ have shown promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity in vitro12,34,35; however,

their therapeutic effect in COVID-19 patients are still controversial7,8. Our analysis here reinforces that
more selective and potent modulators of autophagy pathways should be further evaluated in pre-clinical
models for antiviral activity. Another factor that needs to be taken into consideration is that the
coronavirus can take two distinct pathways for cell entry, either endosomal or non-endosomal. Blocking
autophagy, which is the endocytosis pathway, might not be sufficient to block the viral entry, and
combination approaches, e.g., combination treatments with autophagy inhibitors and TMPRSS2
inhibitors36, warrant consideration.
Activator protein 1 (AP-1) is a dimeric transcription factor composed of proteins belonging to the Jun,
Fos, ATF and JDP families and regulates a range of cellular processes. The AP-1 transcription factor
family could be activated by different stimuli, such as cytokines, stress, bacterial and viral infections37.
The AP-1 signaling pathway has been shown to be activated by the SARS-CoV viral particle38, the spike
protein39, the nucleocapsid protein40 and the accessory protein 3b41. In a recent study, Jun, one of the
AP-1 proteins, has been identified as one of the top hub host proteins, which is directly targeted by CoV
proteins or indirectly involved in the CoV infection 42. The activation of AP-1 signaling might serve as an
immune response for the host to fight viral infections. One hypothesis that can be drawn from this
observation is that the AP-1 pathway may be hijacked by the coronavirus and mediate the process of the
CPE, and disruption of the AP-1 pathway could offset this process. While this hypothesis has not been
directly tested, the correlation we found between AP-1 and SARS-CoV-2 points to this as a druggable
host pathway for SARS-CoV-2 and future emergent coronaviruses.
Psychoactive drugs have been reported to be active against SARS-CoV-210,14,17,18. Here we found that the
neurology/psychiatry class of drugs, in contrast to other classes of drugs, was significantly enriched in
anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. Most of the active compounds in the neurology/psychiatry class of drugs are
psychoactive drugs, which target G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), particularly monoamine
receptors (86% of the psychoactive drugs that showed anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity belong to this category)
(Supplementary Table 1). We hypothesize that those compounds might bind to membrane receptors
and activate intracellular pathways to fight coronaviruses. It is interesting that among the compounds
that were active in both the AP-1 and SARS-CoV-2 CPE assays, we found a more pronounced enrichment
of neurology/psychiatry drugs (3.76-fold; p = 3.89×10-11), suggesting that these drugs may also act
through the AP-1 pathway to inhibit SARS-CoV-2. Another hypothesis is that SARS-CoV-2 might infect
cells through other unknown membrane proteins in addition to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)
and those compounds might interfere with the viral binding to its receptors. GPCRs have been shown to

be hijacked by viruses as co-receptors for entry into host cells43-45. A French study reported that lower
incidences of the symptomatic forms of COVID-19 were found among psychiatric patients (~4%) than
clinical staff (~14%)46. An anti-psychiatric drug, chlorpromazine (Figure 3), has been repurposed for
COVID-19 treatment, and is currently in phase III clinical trial
(https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04366739). In another phase II clinical trial, fluvoxamine, a
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), was found to prevent more serious complications of
COVID-19 infection (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04342663). Pre-clinical data and clinical
observations of those psychoactive drugs are promising; however, further clinical evidence and data are
required to confirm the anti-SARS-CoV-2 effect of those psychoactive drugs.

In summary, we discovered that the autophagy and AP-1 signaling pathways might be potential targets
for COVID-19 therapeutics through systematic mining of a large qHTS database. In addition, the class of
neurology/psychiatry drugs was found significantly enriched with anti-SARS-CoV-2 active compounds,
indicating that this class of drugs also has the potential to be repurposed as treatments for COVID-19
that warrant further investigation.

Materials and Methods

SARS-CoV-2 cytopathic effect (CPE) assay

Vero-E6 cells previously selected for high ACE2

expression 47 (grown in EMEM, 10% FBS, and 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin) were cultured in T175
flasks and passaged at 95% confluency. Cells were washed once with PBS and dissociated from
the flask using TrypLE. Cells were counted prior to seeding. A CPE assay previously used to
measure antiviral effects against SARS-CoV 48 was adapted for performance in 384 well plates
to measure CPE of SARS CoV-2 with the following modifications. Cells, harvested and
suspended at 160,000 cells/ml in MEM/1% PSG/1% HEPES supplemented 2% HI FBS, were
batch inoculated with SARS CoV-2 (USA_WA1/2020) at M.O.I. of approximately 0.002 which
resulted in approximately 5% cell viability 72 h post infection. Compound solutions in DMSO
were acoustically dispensed into assay ready plates (ARPs) at 3 point 1:5 titrations. ARPs were
stored at -20°C and shipped to BSL3 facility (Southern Research Institute, Birmingham, AL) for
CPE assay. ARPs were brought to room temperature and 5µl of assay media was dispensed to

all wells. The plates were transported into the BSL-3 facility were a 25 μL aliquot of virus
inoculated cells (4000 Vero E6 cells/well) was added to each well in columns 3-24. The wells in
columns 23-24 contained virus infected cells only (no compound treatment). A 25 μL aliquot of
uninfected cells was added to columns 1-2 of each plate for the cell only (no virus) controls.
After incubating plates at 37°C with 5% CO2 and 90% humidity for 72 h, 30 μL of Cell Titer-Glo
(Promega, Madison, WI) was added to each well. Following incubation at room temperature for
10 minutes the plates were sealed with a clear cover, surface decontaminated, and
luminescence was read using a Perkin Elmer Envision (Waltham, MA) plate reader to measure
cell viability.
AP-1-bla ME-180 Assay

CellSensor® AP-1-bla ME-180 cell line and the culture medium

components were purchased from ThermoFisher Scientific (Waltham, MA). These cells contain
a beta-lactamase reporter gene under the control of AP-1 response element that has been
stably integrated into ME-180 cells. Cells were cultured in DMEM medium supplemented with
10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (FBS), 0.1 mM non-essential amino acids (NEAA), 1 mM
sodium pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 5 μg/ml of
blastcidin at 37°C under a humidified atmosphere and 5% CO2. AP-1-bla ME-180 cells were
used to screen the NPC compound collection. The positive controls, human epidermal growth
factor (EGF) for AP-1-bla and tetraoctyl ammonium bromide for cytotoxicity assays, were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO).
CellSensor® AP-1-bla ME-180 cells were suspended in 6 μL of assay medium (Opti-MEM with
0.5% dialyzed FBS, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml
streptomycin), and were dispensed at 2,500 cells per well in 1,536-well tissue culture treated
black/clear bottom plates (Greiner Bio-One North America, NC) using a Multidrop Combi
(Thermo Fisher Scientific). After incubation at 37°C for an overnight to facilitate cell adhesion,
23 nL of compounds and positive controls were transferred into the assay plates by a Pintool
station (Wako Automation, San Diego, CA). The assay plates were incubated for 5 hr at 37°C.
One μl of LiveBLAzer™ FRET B/G (CCF4-AM) substrate mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added
using an FRD and incubated at room temperature for 2 hr. The fluorescence signal was
measured using an Envision plate reader (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA) at excitation 405 nm,

and dual emissions at 460 and 530 nm. Data were expressed as relative fluorescence units
(ratio of 460nm/530nm emissions). The cytotoxicity of each compound was tested in parallel in
the same well by adding 4 µl/well of CellTiter-Glo reagent (Promega, Madison, WI) after betalactamase read into the assay plates using an FRD. After 30 min incubation at room
temperature, the luminescence signal was measured using a ViewLux plate reader (Perkin
Elmer). Cytotoxicity data were expressed as relative luminescence units.
