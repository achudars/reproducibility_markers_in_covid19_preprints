It is well recognized that population heterogeneity plays an important role in the spread of epidemics. While individual variations in social activity are often assumed to be persistent, i.e. constant
in time, here we discuss the consequences of dynamic heterogeneity. By integrating the stochastic
dynamics of social activity into traditional epidemiological models we demonstrate the emergence
of a new long timescale governing the epidemic in broad agreement with empirical data. Our model
captures multiple features of real-life epidemics such as COVID-19, including prolonged plateaus and
multiple waves, which are transiently suppressed due to the dynamic nature of social activity. The
existence of the long timescale due to the interplay between epidemic and social dynamics provides
a unifying picture of how a fast-paced epidemic typically will transition to the endemic state.

The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the prominent role played by population heterogeneity in epidemics. On one hand, the observed transmission of infection is characterized by the phenomenon of superspreading, in which a small fraction of individuals are
responsible for a disproportionally large number of secondary infections [1–4]. On the other hand, according
to multiple models, population heterogeneity is expected
to suppress the herd immunity threshold (HIT) and reduce the final size of an epidemic [5–10]. In the context of COVID-19, this observation led to a controversial
suggestion that a strategy relying exclusively on quickly
reaching herd immunity might be a viable alternative to
government-imposed mitigation [11]. However, the experience of locations that had embraced that strategy has
exposed its flaws. While the first wave of infections in
those locations never reached the scale of an unmitigated
epidemic predicted by classical homogeneous models, it
also failed to provide long-lasting protection against new
waves [12].
Another puzzling aspect of the COVID-19 pandemic
is plateau-like dynamics, where the incidence rate stays
at an approximately constant level for a prolonged time
[13–15]. These dramatic departures from predictions of
both classical epidemiological models and their heterogeneous extensions have led to a greater appreciation of
the role played by human behavior in epidemic dynamics. In particular, one plausible mechanism that might be
responsible for both suppression of the early waves and
plateau-like dynamics is that individuals modify their behavior based on information about the current epidemiological situation [15–17]. Another possibility is that long
plateaus might arise because of the underlying structure
of social networks [14].
Here we study epidemic dynamics accounting for random changes in levels of individual social activity. We
demonstrate that this type of dynamic heterogeneity,

even without knowledge-based adaptation of human behavior (e.g. in response to epidemic-related news) [15–
17], leads to a substantial revision of the epidemic
progression, consistent with the empirical data for the
COVID-19 pandemic. In a recent study [8] we have
pointed out that population heterogeneity is a dynamic
property that roams across multiple timescales. A strong
short-term overdispersion of the individual infectivity
manifests itself in the statistics of super-spreading events.
At the other end of the spectrum is a much weaker persistent heterogeneity operating on very long timescales.
In particular, it is this long-term heterogeneity that
leads to a reduction of the HIT compared to that predicted by classical homogeneous models [7–10, 18]. However, the epidemic dynamics is also sensitive to transient
timescales over which the bursty short-term social activity of each individual crosses over to its long-term average. By including the effects of dynamic heterogeneity,
we demonstrate that a suppression of the early waves of
the COVID-19 epidemic, even without active mitigation,
does not signal achievement of long-term herd immunity.
Instead, it is associated with Transient Collective Immunity, a fragile state which degrades over time as individuals change their social activity patterns [8]. As we
demonstrate below, the first wave is generally followed
either by secondary waves or by long plateaus characterized by a nearly constant incidence rate. In the context of
COVID-19, both long plateaus and multi-wave epidemic
dynamics have been commonly observed [13]. According to our analysis, the number of daily infections during
the plateau regime, as well as the individual wave trajectories, are robust properties of the epidemic and depend
on the current level of mitigation, degree of heterogeneity
and temporal correlations of individual social activity.
Our work implies that, once the plateau-like dynamics
is established, the epidemic gradually evolves towards the
long-term HIT determined by persistent population het-

2
erogeneity. However, reaching that state may stretch over
a surprisingly long time, from months to years. On these
long timescales, both waning of individual biological immunity and mutations of the pathogen become valid concerns, and would ultimately result in a permanent endemic state of the infection. Such endemic behavior is
a well-known property of most classical epidemiological
models [19]. However, the emergence of the endemic state
for a newly introduced pathogen is far from being completely understood [20–22]. Indeed, most epidemiological
models would typically predict complete extinction of a
pathogen following the first wave of the epidemic, well before the pool of susceptible population would be replenished. A commonly accepted, though mostly qualitative,
explanation for the onset of endemic behavior of such diseases as measles, seasonal cold, etc., involves geographic
heterogeneity: the pathogen may survive in other geographic locations until returning to a hard hit area with a
depleted susceptible pool [20, 21]. In contrast, our theory
provides a simple and general mechanism that prevents
an overshoot of the epidemic dynamics and thus naturally and generically leads to the endemic fixed point.
The importance of temporal effects has been long recognized in the context of network-based epidemiological
models [23–26]. On one hand, available high-resolution
data on real-world temporal contact networks allows direct modeling of epidemic spread on those networks.
On the other hand, building upon successes of epidemic
models on static unweighted networks [5, 27–29], a variety of their temporal generalizations have been proposed. Those typically involve particular rules for discrete or continuous network rewiring [24–26] such as e.g.
in activity-based network models [17, 30, 31]. While important theoretical results have been obtained for some of
these problems, especially regarding the epidemic threshold, many open questions and challenges remain in the
field. In this paper, we start with a more traditional heterogeneous well-mixed model, which is essentially equivalent to the mean-field description of an epidemic on a
network [6, 29, 32], and include effects of time-variable
social activity that modulates levels of individual susceptibilities and infectivities.
The basic idea behind our model is represented in Fig.
1. Each individual i is characterized by time-dependent
social activity ai (t) proportional to his/her current frequency and intensity of close social contacts. This quantity determines both individual susceptibility to infection
as well as ability to infect others. The time evolution of
contact frequency, and hence ai (t), is in principle measurable by means of proximity devices, such as RFID,
Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, etc. [5, 23, 33, 34]. In our model we
combine a simple mathematical description of social dynamics with the standard Susceptible-Infected-Removed
(SIR) epidemiological model. Qualitatively it leads to
long-term epidemic dynamics fuelled by replenishment
of susceptible population due to changes in the level of
individual social activity from low to high. Fig. 1(a)
illustrates this process by showing people with low so-

a) People with low social activity (depicted as socially isolated
figures at home) occasionally increase their level of activity
(depicted as a party). The average activity in the population
remains the same, but individuals constantly change their activity levels from low to high (arrows pointing up) and back
(arrows pointing down). Individuals are colored according to
their state in the SIR epidemiological model: susceptible green, infected - red, and removed - blue. The epidemic is fuelled by constant replenishment of susceptible population with
high activity due to transitions from the low activity state.

cial activity (depicted as socially isolated at home) occasionally increasing their level of activity (depicted as a
party). Fig. 1(b) represents the same dynamics in terms
of individual functions ai (t). Note that each person is
characterized by his/her own long-term average activity
level αi (dot-dashed lines), but the transmission occurs
predominantly between individuals with high levels of
current social activity. This is because ai (t) determines
both current susceptibility and individual infectivity of a
person. However, the secondary transmission is delayed
with respect to the moment of infection, by a time of the
order of a single generation interval τg (around 5 days
for COVID-19). Studies of real-world contact and interpersonal communication networks have shown that individual social activity is bursty and varies across multiple

3
timescales—from seconds to years [35–38].
For any individual i the value of ai (t) has a tendency
to gradually drift towards its persistent average level αi ,
which itself varies within the population. In our model,
we assign a single timescale τs to this mean reversion
process. This is of course a simplification of the multiscale relaxation observed in real social dynamics. While
τs can be treated as a fitting parameter of our model,
here we simply set it to be τs = 30 days, several fold
longer than the mean generation interval of COVID-19,
τg = 5 days. Note that from the point of view of the
epidemic dynamics, variations in activity on timescales
shorter than the mean generation interval may be safely
ignored. For example, attending a single party would
increase an individual’s risk of infection but would not
change his/her likelihood of transmission to others 5 days
later.
The individual social activity ai (t) is governed by the
following stochastic equation:
a˙i (t) =

αi − ai (t)
+ ηi (t)
τs

(1)

Here η(t) is a short-time noise that gives rise to timedependent variations in ai (t). We set hηi (t)ηi (t0 )i =
2ai (t)
0
τs k0 δ(t − t ), which results in a diffusion in the space
of individual social activity with diffusion coefficient proportional to ai . This stochastic process is well known in
mathematical finance as the Cox–Ingersoll–Ross (CIR)
model [39] and has been studied in probability theory
since 1950s [40]. The major properties of this model are
(i) reversion to the mean and (ii) non-negativity of ai at
all times, both of which are natural for social activity.
Furthermore, the steady state solution of this model is
characterized by the Gamma-distributed ai . This is consistent with the empirical statistics of short-term overdispersion of disease transmission manifesting itself in superspreading events [1, 3, 4]. More specifically, for a
given level of persistent activity α, this model generates
the steady-state distribution of “instantaneous” values of
social activity a following gamma distribution with mean
α and variance α/k0 : fα (a) ∼ ak0 α−1 e−k0 a .
The statistics of super-spreader events is usually represented as a negative binomial distribution, derived from
a gamma-distributed individual reproduction number [1].
The observed overdispersion parameter k ≈ 0.1−0.3 [3, 4]
can be used for partial calibration of our model. This
short-term overdispersion has both stochastic and persistent contributions. In our model, the former is characterized by dispersion k0 . In addition, we assume persistent
levels of social activity αi to also follow a Gamma distribution with another dispersion parameter, κ. In several recent studies of epidemic dynamics in populations
with persistent heterogeneity [8, 9, 41] it has been demonstrated that κ determines the herd immunity threshold.
Multiple studies of real-world contact networks (summarized, e.g. in [6]) report an approximately exponential
distribution of α, which corresponds to κ ' 1. Throughout this paper, we assume a more conservative value,

κ = 2, i.e. coefficient of variation 1/κ = 0.5, half way
between the fully homogeneous case and that with exponentially distributed α. For consistency with the reported value of the short-term overdispersion parameter
[4], 1/k ≈ 1/κ + 1/k0 ≈ 3, we set k0 = 0.4.
According to Eq. (1), individuals, each characterized
by his/her own persistent level of social activity α, effectively diffuse in the space of their current social activity
a. This leads to major modifications of the epidemic
dynamics. For instance, the equation for the susceptible fraction in classical epidemic models [19] acquires the
following form:

a ∂2
α−a ∂
Ṡα (a, t) = −aJ(t) +
+
Sα (a, t)
k0 τs ∂a2
τs ∂a
(2)
Here Sα (a, t) is the fraction of susceptible individuals
within a subpopulation with a given value of persistent
social activity α and with current social activity a, at
the moment of infection, and J(t) is the current strength
of infection. Its time evolution can be described by any
traditional epidemiological model, such as e.g. age-ofinfection, SIR/SEIR, etc [19].

FIG. 2. Schematic representation of the mechanisms that lead
to self-limited epidemic dynamics. In traditional epidemic
models, the major factor is the depletion of susceptible population. Government-imposed mitigation and/or behavioral
adaptation to the perceived risk create another feedback loop
(purple). Yet another mechanism, is due to the dynamic heterogeneity of the attack rate parameterized by h(t) (black).
On the one hand, the attack rate heterogeneity is being generated by the current infection. On the other hand, it suppresses
itself on the timescale of τs due the reversion of individual social activity towards the mean (black feedback loop).

Eq.
(2), is dramatically simplified by writing
Sα (a, t) ≡ e−Z(t)α−k0 h(t)a , implicitly defining Z(t) as a
measure of persistent heterogeneity of the attack rate
and the transient heterogeneity parameter h(t). As Z increases, so does the difference in depletion of susceptibles
among subpopulations with different α’s, i.e. various levels of persistent social activity. On the other hand, h(t)
parametrizes the transient heterogeneity within each of
these subpopulations. Both Z(t) and h(t) indicate the
current level of heterogeneity of the attack rate i.e. sus-

As in the case of persistent heterogeneity without temporal variations [8], the long-term herd immunity threshold,
1 − (R0 M )−1/λ , is determined by the immunity factor λ.
The latter depends both on the short-term and persistent
dispersion parameters:

Here kg = k0 (1 + τg /τs ) is the dispersion parameter for
activity a(t) averaged over a timescale of a single generation interval. For parameters k0 = 0.4 and κ = 2, τs = 30
days used throughout our study, kg = 0.47, λ = 1.7, consistent with our earlier estimate of λ∞ ≈ 2 [8].
In Figure 2 we schematically represent three feedback
mechanisms that lead to self-limited epidemic dynamics. The most conventional of them relies on depletion of
susceptible population (red). Another mechanism is due
to government mitigation as well as personal behavioral
response to perceived epidemic risk (purple). Finally, according to our theory there is yet another generic mechanism related to accumulated heterogeneity of the attack

ceptible population structure. In the long run, transient
heterogeneity disappears due to the diffusion in the aspace, thus h(t) asymptotically approaches 0 as t → ∞.
We combine this ansatz with a general methodology [8]
that provides a quasi-homogeneous description for a wide
variety of heterogeneous epidemiological models. For a
specific case of SIR dynamics, we assign each person a
state variable Ii set to 1 when the individual is infectious
and 0 otherwise. Now, the activity-weighted fraction of
the infected population is defined as I(t) = hIi ai (t)i/ha2i i,
and the current infection strength is proportional to it:
J(t) = R0 M (t)I(t)/τg . Here M (t) is a time-dependent
mitigation factor, which combines the effects of government interventions, societal response to the epidemic, as
well other sources of time modulation, such as e.g. seasonal forcing.
Using this ansatz, the epidemic in a population with
both persistent and dynamic heterogeneity of individual
social activity can be compactly described as a dynamical
system with only three variables: the susceptible population fraction S(t), the infected population fraction I(t)
(activity-weighted) which is proportional to strength of
infection J(t), and the transient heterogeneity parameter
h(t). In the (S, I, h)-space, the dynamics is given by the

FIG. 3. (a)-(c) Comparison of the epidemic dynamics with
homogeneous population (black curves), persistent population heterogeneity (brown curves), and with dynamic heterogeneity (green curves): mitigation profile (a), daily incidence (b), and cumulative attack rate (c). While parameters
in cases (b) and (c) correspond to the same herd immunity
threshold (HIT), the behavior is drastically different. In the
persistent model, the epidemic quickly overshoots above HIT
level. In the case of dynamic heterogeneity, the initial wave
is followed by a plateau-like behavior with slow relaxation
towards the HIT. Note an excellent agreement between the
quasi-homogeneous theory described by Eqs. (3- 5) (solid

stochastic activity is given by Eq. (1) (shaded area = the
range of 3 independent simulations).

relaxation of h(t) this feedback loop limits the scale of
a single epidemic wave, but does not provide long-term
protection against new ones.
As demonstrated below, the theory described by Eqs.
(3)-(5) is in excellent agreement with simulations of the
Agent-Based Model (ABM) in which social activities of 1
million agents undergo stochastic evolution described by
Eq. (1) (compare solid lines with shaded areas in Figs.

Figure 3 illustrates a dramatic effect time-dependent
heterogeneity has on the epidemic dynamics. It compares three cases: the classical homogeneous SIR model

FIG. 4. The time course of an epidemic with enhanced mitigation during the first wave. (a) shows the M (t)R0 progression
for two different strategies. In both cases, the enhanced mitigation leads to a 50% reduction of M (t)R0 from 2 to 1. In
the first scenario (early mitigation, blue curves), the reduction lasted for only 15 days starting from day 27. In the second scenario (delayed mitigation, red curves), the mitigation
was applied on day 37 and lasted for 45 days. (b)-(c) show
daily incidence and cumulative attack rates for both strategies. As predicted, differences in the initial mitigation had
no significant effect on the epidemic in the long run: the two
trajectories eventually converge towards the universal attractor. However, the early mitigation allows to suppress the peak
of the infection, potentially reducing the stress on healthcare
system. A delayed mitigation gives rose to a sizable second
wave.

in this study (green). The latter two models share the
same HIT (green dashed line) which is reduced compared
to the homogeneous case (black dashed line). In the absence of dynamic heterogeneity (black and brown) the
initial exponential growth halts once the respective HIT
is reached, but the overall attack rate “overshoots” beyond that point, eventually reaching a significantly larger
level, known as the final size of the epidemic (FSE). Importantly, in both these cases the epidemic has only a
single wave of duration set by the mean generation interval τg multiplied by a certain R0 -dependent factor. In
the case of dynamic heterogeneity (green), described by
Eqs. (3)-(5), the epidemic is transiently suppressed at
the level which is below even the heterogeneous HIT. As

we argued in Ref. [8] this temporary suppression is due to
the population reaching the Transient Collective Immunity (TCI). That state originates due to the short-term
population heterogeneity being enhanced compared to its
persistent level. Stochastic contributions to social activity responsible for this enhancement eventually average
out, leading to a slow degradation of the TCI state. Fig.
3b illustrates that as the TCI state degrades, the daily
incidence rate develops an extended plateau on the green
curve. The cumulative attack rate shown in Fig. 3c relaxes towards the HIT. This relaxation is characterized
by an emergent long time constant τ̃ ' τs /k0 > τs .
According to Eqs. (3-5) for a fixed mitigation level
M (t), any epidemic trajectory would eventually converge
to the same curve, i.e. the universal attractor. The existence of the universal attractor is apparent in Fig 4,
where we compare two scenarios with different mitigation strategies applied at early stages of the epidemic. In
both cases, an enhanced mitigation was imposed leading
to a reduction of M (t)R0 by 50% from 2 to 1. In the
first scenario (blue curves), the enhanced mitigation was
imposed on day 27 and lasted for 15 days. In the second
scenario (red curves), the mitigation was applied on day
37 and lasted for 45 days. As predicted, this difference
in mitigation has not had any significant effect on the
epidemic in the long run: these two trajectories eventually converged towards the universal attractor. However, short- and medium- term effects were substantial.
The early mitigation scenario (blue curve) resulted in a
substantial suppression of the maximum incidence during the first wave. Immediately following the release of
the mitigation the second wave started and reached approximately the same peak value as the first one. If the
objective of the intervention is to avoid the overflow of
the healthcare system, this strategy would indeed help to
achieve it. In contrast, the delayed mitigation scenario
(red curve) turned out to be largely counterproductive.
It did not suppress the peak of the first wave, but brought
the infection to a very low level after it. Eventually, that
suppression backfired as the TCI state deteriorated and
the epidemic resumed as a second wave, which is not as
strong as the first one.
Since the late-stage evolution in our model is characterized by a long relaxation time τ̃ , the possibility of
waning of individual biological immunity or escape mutations of the pathogen accumulated over certain (presumably, also long) time τb , becomes a relevant effect.
It can be incorporated as an additional relaxation term
(1 − S)/τb in Eq. (4). The analysis of our equations,
modified in this way, shows that the universal attractor
leads to a fixed point corresponding to the endemic state.
That point is located somewhat below the HIT and characterized by the finite residual incidence rate (1−S∞ )/τb
and, respectively, by finite values of I and h. Here S∞
is a susceptible population fraction in the endemic state,
which is close to, but somewhat higher than that at the
onset of the herd immunity. A similar endemic steady
state exists in most classical epidemic models (See [19]

6
and references therein). However, in those cases, the epidemic dynamics would not normally lead to that point
due to the overshoot phenomenon. Instead, those models typically predict a complete extinction of the disease
when the prevalence drops below one infected individual.
This may happen before herd immunity is lost due to
waning biological immunity and/or replenishment of the
susceptible population (e.g. due to births of immunologically naive individuals). That is not the case when the
time-dependent heterogeneity is included.
Note that for most pathogens the endemic point is not
fixed but instead is subjected to periodic seasonal forcing in M (t). This leads to annual peaks and troughs in
the incidence rate. Our model is able to describe this
seasonal dynamics as well as transition towards it for a
new pathogen (see Fig. 5). It captures the important
qualitative features of seasonal waves of real pathogens,
e.g. three endemic coronavirus families studied in Ref.
[42]. They are (i) sharp peaks followed by a prolonged
relaxation towards the annual minimum; (ii) a possibility
of multi-annual cycles due to parametric resonance.

FIG. 5. Multi-year dynamics of a new pathogen. Effects of
waning biological immunity with characteristic time τb = 5
yrs, and seasonal forcing are included (see SI for details). In
the case of persistent heterogeneity without temporal variations of social activity (brown solid line) the infection gets
extinct following the initial wave of the epidemic. In contrast, dynamic heterogeneity leads to an endemic state with
strong seasonal oscillations (green line). Insert: The epidemic
dynamics in the (J, h) phase space. The black dotted line corresponds to the universal attractor trajectory manifested e.g.
as a plateau in green line in Fig. 3b. The attractor leads to
the endemic state (red point).

To understand the nature of the overall epidemic dynamics, we focus on the behavior of variables J(t) and
h(t). Their evolution is described by Eqs.(3) and (5),
with R∗ = R0 M (t)S(t)λ playing the role of a driving
force. As a result of depletion of susceptible population,
the driving force is gradually reduced, and the dynamic
converges towards a slow evolution along the universal

attractor shown as a black dotted trajectory in (h, J) coordinates at the insert to Fig. 5. For initial conditions
away from that trajectory (say, J ≈ 0, h = 0), the linear
stability analysis indicates that the epidemic dynamics
has a damped oscillatory behavior manifesting itself as
a spiral-like relaxation towards the universal attractor.
A combination of this spiral dynamics with a slow drift
towards the endemic state gives rise to the overall trajectory shown as the solid green line at the insert to Fig.
5. The periodic seasonal forcing generates a limit cycle
about the endemic point (small green ellipse around the
red point).
More generally, any abrupt increase of the effective reproduction number e.g. due to a relaxed mitigation, seasonal changes, etc. would shift the endemic fixed point
up along the universal attractor. According to Eqs. (3-5)
this will once again trigger a spiral-like relaxation. It will
manifest itself as a new wave of the epidemic, such as the
secondary waves in Fig. 4b).
A systematic calibration of our model and application to real-world epidemiological data is beyond the
scope of this study. However, below we present a proofof-principle demonstration that the progression in the
COVID-19 epidemic in the summer and fall of 2020 in
four regions of the continental US: South, Northeast,
Midwest and West can be well described by our theory.
The time dependence of daily deaths per capita (a reliable, albeit delayed measure proportional to the true
attack rate) is shown in Fig. 6bc for each of the regions
and fitted by our model with k0 = 0.4, τs = 30 days,
κ = 2, together with IFR assumed to be 0.4%. This
IFR value was estimated by comparing reported COVIDrelated deaths in USA [13] to two independent seroprevalence surveys [43, 44]. Unlike during the first wave, statemandated mitigation measures have been relaxed in the
early summer and kept largely constant during this time.
Thus it is reasonable to assume that M (t) follows regular seasonal dynamics during that time period. This is
reflected in a simple mitigation profile R0 M (t) shown in
Fig. 6a featuring a sharp relaxation of mitigation in early
summer 2020 and gradual seasonal increase of the reproduction number during the fall. Release of mitigation
triggered an immediate second wave in the South and
West (Fig. 6c) that had relatively low exposure during
the first wave of the epidemic. In our model the wave
is transiently suppressed when these regions reach the
TCI state. Differences between the data and our model
observed in the early fall may be tentatively attributed
to government-imposed mitigation measures and/or to
knowledge-based adaptation of the human behavior [15–
17]. The late fall wave in all regions was triggered by seasonal changes in transmission. According to our model
this wave was stabilized in mid-winter due to the population once again reaching the TCI state. Note a good
agreement between peak levels of this wave with our predictions.
Midwest and Northeast (Fig. 6b) exhibited similar behavior except having a plateau instead of the summer

FIG. 6. Fitting of the empirical data on COVID-19 epidemic in Northeast (green), Midwest (blue), West (purple)

R0 M (t), under the assumption that they are shaped by the
end of lockdowns in the early summer of 2020, followed by
gradual seasonal changes in the fall. Time dependence of
daily deaths per capita for the Northeast and Midwest as
well as for South and and West US are shown in panels (b)
and (c), respectively. Data points represent reported daily
deaths per 100,000 of population for each of the regions [13].
Solid lines are the theoretical fits with our model. The following parameters of M (t)R0 curves were subject to variation:
the mitigation level M (t) before and after the termination of
the lockdown, the amplitude of the seasonal forcing, and the
summer-winter crossover time. Other parameters have been
fixed: k0 = 0.4, κ = 2, τs = 30 days, IF R = 0.4%, and τb = 5
years.

wave due to their higher levels of exposure during the
first wave of the epidemic in spring 2020. Importantly,
the transmission monotonically increases throughout the

entire time window, yet our model captures the observed
secondary waves and plateaus. That behavior would be
impossible to explain using traditional epidemiological
models well below the herd immunity.
In conclusion, we have proposed a new theory integrating the stochastic dynamics of individual social activity
into traditional epidemiological models. Our model describes the so-called “zero intelligence” limit in which
there is no feedback from the epidemic dynamics to social activity e.g. mediated by the news. Hence our approach is complementary to knowledge-based models of
Refs. [15–17]. The stochastic social activity in our approach is described by the CIR model [39] which captures the following important properties: (i) the activity cannot be negative; (ii) for any given individual it
reverses towards its long-term average value; (iii) it exhibits gamma-distributed short-term overdispersion (aka
superspreading) [1, 3, 4]. We mapped the overall epidemic dynamics featuring heterogeneous time-varying social activity onto a system of three differential equations,
two of which generalize the traditional SIR model. The
third equation describes the dynamics of the heterogeneity parameter h(t), driven up by the current strength of
infection J(t) and relaxing back to zero due to variable
social activity.
The emergent property of our theory is the new long
timescale τs /k0 governing the relaxation towards either
the herd immunity or the endemic state of the pathogen.
This behavior is in striking contrast to traditional epidemiological models generally characterized by a large
overshoot beyond the herd immunity threshold leading
to a likely extinction of new pathogens. Our theory is in
a good agreement with the empirical observation of long
plateaus observed for many real-life epidemics including
COVID-19 [13]. Dynamic heterogeneity also leads to a
transient suppression of individual waves of the epidemic
without reaching the long-term herd immunity [8]. Finally, we demonstrated that our theory is in quantitative
agreement with the data describing secondary waves of
COVID-19 epidemic in different regions of the USA.

Epidemic dynamics with dynamic heterogeneity

Let ai (t) be a measure of individual’s social activity proportional to frequency and intensity of close contacts with
other people around time t. We refer to it as (social) susceptibility to infection, but it also determines one’s potential
to infect others. In particular, infectivity of a person i infected at time t∗i is given by
βi (t∗i + τ ) = Ci (τ )ai (t∗ + τ )

(S1)

Here Ci (τ ) is person’s contagiousness level, at time τ after infection.
Let j(t) be the fraction of infected individual, weighted proportionally to their current infectivity level, and M (t)
be mitigation factor that reflects government and social response to epidemics, seasonal effects etc. Their product,
J(t) = M (t)j(t) is force of infection, i.e. a hypothetical incidence rate in fully susceptible homogeneous population
with α = 1. Within the heterogeneous (but well-mixed) age-of-infection model, current value of j(t) is given by
Z ∞
hCi (τ )ai (t)ai (t − τ )Si (t − τ )ii J(t − τ )dτ
(S2)
j(t) = hβi (t − t∗i )ii =
0

Here Si (t − τ ) is the state of an individual i (1 if susceptible, 0 otherwise). Since J(t) is by definition proportional to
j(t), we obtain the quasi-homogeneous renewal equation:

j(t) =
K(t, τ )Re (t − τ )j(t − τ )dτ

Stochastic model for social activity

It is well known that social interactions are “bursty”. That is to say, individual social activity has both (nearly)
permanent and significant time-dependent contributions:
ai (t) = αi + δai (t)

(S6)

Without loss of generality we set the population-averaged permanent and instantaneous susceptibility to 1: hai (t)ii =
hαi ii = 1. Beyond its average value, the overall statistics of instantaneous α(t) is properly defined only if that quantity
is average over specified time window δt. Naturally, its variation will gradually decrease as the time widow increases.
Individual reproductive number, Ri , for COVID-19 epidemic is (in)famously over-dispersed. This is a result of superspreading, when a majority of secondary infections are caused by a small fraction of index cases. The overdispersion
reflects (i) variation of peak contagiousness level among individuals and (ii) dispersion of ai (t) which is effectively
averaged over a timescale of the peak infection period (approximately 2 days).
Importantly, according to Eq.(S4), the reproductive number depends on correlations of ai across a time scale of a
single generation interval (on average, 4 to 5 days for COVID 19). Thus, any variations in ai (t) that do not persist
over that timescale would be averaged out. Here we introduce a simple model to account for temporal variation of
social activity. In this model, ai may vary on short time scale, relax to the persistent value for a given individual over
certain relaxation time, τs :
a˙i =

αi − ai
+ ηi (t)
τs

(S7)

i (t)
0
Here η(t) is short-time noise that gives rise to time dependent fluctuations. We set hηi (t)ηi (t0 )i = 2a
τs k0 δ(t − t ), which
gives rise to individual diffusion in ai space with diffusion coefficient proportional to ai . The evolution of population
with a given value of persistent activity α in that space is given by the following Fokker-Plank Equation:

Ψ̇α (a, t) =

1 ∂ 2 (aΨ(a, t))
1 ∂ ((a − α)Ψα (a, t))
+
2
k0 τs
∂a
τs
∂a

(S8)

2
The steady state solution to this equation gives a probability density function (pdf) for a, which turns out to be a
commonly used gamma distribution:
Ψα (a, t) = fα (a) =

aαk0 −1 e−k0 a
ααk0 Γ(αk0 )

(S9)

Note that the statistics of superspreading events is commonly modeled assuming the very same distribution for
individual reproduction number, Ri . This gives a strong empirical support to the chosen model, in particular to the
choice of diffusion coefficient to be proportional to α. It also allows us to partially calibrate the model. Reported
dispersion parameter associated with superspreading events for COVID 19 is in the range of 0.1 to 0.3 [3, 4]. Note
however that our parameter k0 is expected to be larger than k, i.e. has a smaller dispersion. This is because variations
of a(t) over the timescale shorter than a single generation interval would be averaged out according to Eq. (S10),
while the superspreading statistics effectively probes it over a shorter time interval of the infectivity peak in a single
individual. The latter could be further enhanced by a variation of individual contagiousness e.g. due to biological
factors.
It is well known that the mean reproduction number R0 in a heterogeneous population depends on the second
moment of distribution of α (in network epidemic models it is related to individual degree). However, there is an
important modification to that result for time-dependent a(t):

Here R = h Ci (τ )dτ ii is the net infection transmission probability of an average person. This gives:
R0 = hαi2 i + µk0−1
Here factor µ is related to the Laplace transform of average contagiousness profile, K0 (τ ) = hCi (τ )ii /R.

K(τ ) =

e−τ /τs − µ

K0 (τ )
k0 hαi2 i + µ

(S13)

Specifically, for the case of SIR model, i.e. K0 (τ ) ∼ e−τ /τ0 , one obtains: µ = 1/(1 + τ0 /τs ) ≈ 1/(1 + τg /τs ). Here
mean generation interval τg is given by

(S14)

In this SIR case, one can assign each person a state variable Ii set to 1 when the individual is infectious and 0
otherwise. This allows to describe the epidemic dynamics in terms of activity-weighted fraction of the infected
population, I(t) = hIi ai (t)i/ha2i i. Note that variable j(t) and hence the strength of infection are proportional to it:
J(t) = M (t)j(t) =

Mapping on quasi-homogeneous dynamic system

Let Sα (a, t) be the fraction of susceptibles among the sub-population with persistent activity level α and given
value of a, at time t. Change of function Sα (a, t) is driven by two effects: (i) depletion of susceptible population due
to infection and (ii) diffusion of individual in α space. By substituting Φα (a, t) = fα (a)Sα (t) into Fokker-Plank Eq.
(S8), and adding the infection term with rate −a(t), we obtain an evolution equation for Sα ;

This equation can be solved by using the following ansatz:
Sα (a, t) = exp [−Z(t)α − k0 h(t)a]

(S17)

Here Z(t) is a measure of persistent heterogeneity: the larger it is, the more is the difference in depletion of susceptible
among subpopulations with different α’s, i.e. various average levels of social activity. On the other hand, h(t) parameterizes the transient heterogeneity within each of these subpopulations. In the long run, this type of heterogeneity
disappears due to evolution in a-space, thus h(t) asymptotically approaches 0 as t → ∞. Substituting Eq. (S17) into
Eq. (S16) results in simple equations for both Z(t) and h(t):

The renewal equation Eq. (S3) for j(t) completes our quasi-homogeneous description of the epidemic dynamics.
However, to fully close this system of equations, one needs to express the effective reproduction number, Re , in terms
of the functions M (t), Z(t) and h(t). This is done by substituting the ansatz, Eq. (S17), into Eq. (S4). We perform
this calculation in two steps, by first finding the effective number Rα for a sub-population with average level of activity
α, followed by averaging over persistent heterogeneity. This gives

Note that for most practical purposes, one can set qχ (S, h) = 1. The parameter λ is the “immunity factor” that
emerged in the context of our earlier study of persistent heterogeneity [8]. In that case, λ = 1 + 2/κ appears as
a scaling exponent in relationship between effective reproduction number Re (t) and the fraction of the susceptible
population S(t): Re = R0 M S λ . Eq. (S26) generalizes that result.
Eqs.(S3), (S18), S26, (S22) give the full description of the epidemic dynamics in heterogeneous system. For a
particular case of SIR model (K(τ ) ∼ e−τ /τg ), we obtain a 3D dynamical system, in terms of variables I(t), S(t) and

Waves and plateaus

According to Eq. (S29), the combined driving force of the epidemic is R∗ = R0 M (t)S λ (t). It includes both the
effects of mitigation M (t) and suppression associated with the build up of the long-term herd immunity. First, we
assume R∗ to be fixed or change very slowly (adiabatically), i.e. on the timescales longer than τs . In that case, J(t)
and h(t) trail the driving force R∗ (t), staying close to the corresponding adiabatic fixed point (J ∗ , h∗ ) in their 2D
phase space:

The stability of this adiabatic fixed point, and the more rapid epidemic dynamics can be described by linearizing Eqs.
(S29, S31) and (S18) around (J ∗ , h∗ ), i.e. by assuming h(t) = h∗ + δh(t) and J(t) = J ∗ + δJ(t):

The amplitude of the oscillations decays with the time constant 2τs /(1+2h∗ ). This oscillatory behavior would manifest
itself as multiple epidemic waves. In reality, the dynamics is more complicated since rapid changes of M (t), e.g. due
to seasonal effects, government and societal response to the epidemic, would additionally modulate it.
The assumption of R∗ = R0 M (t)S λ (t) being fixed is not, of course, realistic. In particular, the mitigation factor
M (t) may have both slow and fast variations. On top of that, the dependence of R∗ on S(t) creates a negative

(HIT) for a given mitigation level M . There is one particular solution (J(t),
variables slowly evolving in such a way that Re stays close to 1 at all times, eventually reaching the HIT point,
(0, S0 ). As follows from the above stability analysis, this solution acts as an attractor, with any trajectory in (J, S, h)
space converging towards it, unless perturbed by variations in mitigation M (t). To construct that solution, we set
the growth rate for I(t) in Eq.(S29) to 0, and use Eqs (S30)-(S31) to calculate the corresponding evolution of h(t):

Seasonal forcing

Seasonal effects are commonly described as simple sin-shaped modulation of reproductive number [42]. In this work,
we used a combination of sigmoidal functions to model transition between “winter” and “summer” values of M (t):

Here T = 1yr, time parameters tspring < tfall and ∆ determine the timing of and sharpness of winter-summer-winter
transitions. σ determines the amplitude of seasonal changes. In particular, σ = 0.25 in Fig.2, and ranges between
0.25 and 0.35 in our fits of epidemic dynamics for different US regions, Fig. 6.

Implementation of the agent-based model

All simulations for the agent-based model use 1 million agents and 3 simulation replicates. For each agent in the
simulation, at each time step, the social activity follows the stochastic dynamics described in Eq. 1. After that, the
overall force of infection is computed using
J(t) =

R0 M (t) 1 X
ai Ii
τg ha(t)2 ii N i

,

(S48)

where Ii is binary and used to denote whether or not the agent is infectious, N is the number of agents in the simulation.
For a susceptible agent i, the chance of being infected in one simulation step is ai (t)J(t)dt which is proportional to the
force of infection, his/her activity ai (t), and dt - the length of the time step used in our simulations. For an infectious
agent, the probability of recovering from the infectious state in one simulation step is γdt. When the waning of
biological immunity is ignored, recovered agents will always stay in the recovered state and cannot be infected again.
