Abstract
The UK has had a volatile political environment for some years now, with
Brexit and leadership crises marking the past five years. With this work, we
wanted to understand more about how the global health emergency, COVID-19,
influences the amount, type or topics of abuse that UK politicians receive when
engaging with the public. This work covers the period of June - December 2020
and analyses Twitter abuse in replies to UK MPs. This work is a follow-up from
our analysis of online abuse during the first four months of the COVID-19
pandemic in the UK. The paper examines overall abuse levels during this new
seven month period, analyses reactions to members of different political parties
and the UK government, and the relationship between online abuse and topics
such as Brexit, government’s COVID-19 response and policies, and social issues.
In addition, we have also examined the presence of conspiracy theories posted in
abusive replies to MPs during the period. We have found that abuse levels toward
UK MPs were at an all-time high in December 2020 (5.4% of all reply tweets
sent to MPs). This is almost 1% higher that the two months preceding the
General Election. In a departure from the trend seen in the first four months of
the pandemic, MPs from the Tory party received the highest percentage of
abusive replies from July 2020 onward, which stays above 5% starting from
September 2020 onward, as the COVID-19 crisis deepened and the Brexit
negotiations with the EU started nearing completion.

1 Introduction
Our previous work studying online abuse in the context of British politics has shown
that it can be specific to context, specific to individuals (their characteristics and
behaviour) and specific to events unfolding around us [1]. Already in the midst
of serious upheavals to “business as usual” with Brexit and leadership crises, we
wanted to understand more about how the global health emergency, COVID-19,
influences the amount, type or topics of abuse that UK politicians receive when
engaging with the public.
This white paper charts Twitter abuse in replies to UK MPs between June and
December 2020, which is a follow-up from our analysis of online abuse during the
first four months of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK [2]. The paper examines overall abuse levels during this new seven month period, analyses reactions to
members of different political parties and the UK government, and the relationship
between online abuse and topics such as Brexit, government’s COVID-19 response
and policies, and social issues. In addition, we have also examined the presence of
conspiracy theories posted in abusive replies to MPs during the period.

This paper makes a contribution to the longitudinal comparison of abuse trends
toward UK politicians. Since the same data collection and abuse detection method
was used to analyse previous levels of abuse towards MPs in the run-up to the 2017
and 2019 UK General Elections [1] and during the first four months of the COVID19 pandemic in the UK [2], this research not only presents new findings, but is also
able to corroborate findings of our own previous studies an other related studies.
Our key new findings are as follows:
• Abuse levels towards UK MPs in the run up to Brexit in December 2020
reached 5.4% of all reply tweets sent to MPs. This is the highest level seen
across all time periods that we have studied - the 2017 and 2019 General
Elections and the first 4 months of the pandemic (Feb - May 2020).
• The 5.4% average abuse in Dec 2020 is almost 1% higher than the 4.5% average
abuse levels reached in the two months preceding the 2019 General Election.
• Another flashpoint was in October 2020, when abuse levels spiked to almost
5.1%. Our analysis links this to a specific conflict regarding two MPs and their
supporters, however this period also included new tier restrictions, circuit
breakers and lockdown protests.
• In a departure from the trend seen in the first four months of the pandemic,
MPs from the Tory party received the highest percentage of abusive replies
from July 2020 onwards, which stays above 5% starting from September 2020
onwards, as the COVID-19 crisis deepened and the Brexit negotiations with
the EU started nearing completion.

2 Related Work
In this paper, we examine the impact of COVID-19 on abuse levels toward UK MPs.
We were expecting impact to be significant, given the amount of misinformation,
partisanship and frustration around COVID-19, as well as the existing political affairs of the UK regarding Brexit and party leadership. In a special issue related to
online harm during COVID-19, editors Ferrara, Cresci and Luceri [3] comment that
COVID-19 has been an “unprecedented setting for the spread of online misinformation, manipulation, and abuse, with the potential to cause dramatic real-world
consequences”.
Our previous work, however, was inconclusive about the overall impact of COVID19 on abuse levels towards UK MPs, due to the novelty of the situation and compassion during Boris Johnson’s illness [2]. Abuse toward politicians was at an all-time
low during Johnson’s illness, as he usually features quite prominently in the data
because of his role [1]. It is therefore necessary to compare these findings with those
of the current period, as the pandemic has matured and Brexit was clearly on the
horizon, to see how abuse has levelled-out during this first year of COVID-19.
Previous work on abuse directed at UK MPs indicated that hostility toward MPs
was rising [4, 5, 6, 7], particularly in relation to contentious issues, like the European referendum, the Brexit crisis and inequality [2]. Ward and McLoughlin [8]
found previously that language that could be classified as hate-speech was rather
low, however, in comparison to more generally uncivil language. Still, women from
minority backgrounds were more likely to be the recipients of that type of abuse.
The authors also found that men received more online abuse that was uncivil than

Farrell et al.

Page 3 of 20

women. Similarly to our previous work [1], the authors demonstrated that increased
name recognition and popularity had a positive relationship with levels of abuse,
which may be one reason for the differences in gender. As there are more male
politicians in senior roles than women, they feature more prominently and may
therefore receive more abusive replies.
Southern and Harmer [9] conducted a deeper content analysis on tweets received
by MPs during a period and found that while men received more incivility in terms
of numbers of replies, women were more likely to receive an uncivil reply. Women
were more likely to be stereotyped by identity (men by party) and to be questioned
in their position as an MP. Gorrell et al [5] noted in addition that the impacts or
consequences of abusive language are not manifesting in the same ways for male
and female MPs, or MPs with intersectional identities of race and gender. Where
some abuse is distressing, other abuse is personal, threatening and limits women’s
participation in the public office [5, 10, 11].
Abuse toward specific parties has been difficult to distinguish, due to impacts of
prominence, personal characteristics and specific events [1]. However, when controlling for this, Ward and McLoughlin [8] found that less visible MPs had a very small
percentage of hate and abuse. In our work, we explore some of these findings in
comparison with what we can observe happening during the COVID-19 period.

3 Data Collection and Analysis Methodology
This study spans 1 June to 31 December 2020 inclusive, and discusses Twitter
engagement with currently serving MPs that have active Twitter accounts (568
MPs in total), as well as abuse-containing replies sent to them. In total, across the
seven month period, we collected and analysed 8.9 million reply tweets to the MPs,
which were sent in response to the overall 545,071 tweets authored by MPs (which
consist of original, retweets, and replies by MPs).
The dataset was created by collecting tweets in real-time using Twitter’s streaming
API. We used the API to follow the accounts of MPs - this means we collected all
the tweets sent by each MP, any replies to those tweets, and any retweets either
made by the MP or of the MP’s own tweets. Note that this approach does not collect
all tweets which an individual would see in their timeline, as it does not include
those in which they are just mentioned. However, “direct replies”are included. We
took this approach as the analysis results are more reliable due to the fact that
replies are directed at the politician who authored the tweet, and thus, any abusive
language is more likely to be directed at them. No data was lost, as volumes did
not exceed Twitter rate limits at any point.
Tweets from earlier in the study have had more time to gather replies. Most replies
occur in the day or two following the tweet being made, but some tweets continue
to receive attention over time, and events may lead to a resurgence of focus on an
earlier tweet. Reply numbers are a snapshot at the time of the study.
We analysed the dataset with the automatic abuse-based detection method developed by [1]. The abuse detection method underestimates by possibly as much as a
factor of two, finding more obvious verbal abuse, but missing linguistically subtler
examples. This is useful for comparative findings, tracking abuse trends, and for
approximation of actual abuse levels.

Macro and micro averaging
In several places throughout the report, we present both a macro-average and a
micro-average of abuse levels received by politicians. The micro-average is calculated on totals across all individuals. So if Corbyn receives 10 abusive tweets
out of 100 and Johnson receives 15 abusive tweets out of 200, then the microaverage would be (10+15)/(100+200). The result is dominated by Johnson’s
counts, as he received more. In the micro-average, a small number of individuals receiving a great many tweets may disproportionately affect
the result. In the macro-average, proportion of abuse is first calculated, and
then these are averaged. So in the above example, the macro-average would be
(0.1 + 0.075)/2 (because 10/100 is 0.1 and 15/200 is 0.075). Macro-average
tends to better express the experience of the average MP.

4 Overall Abuse Levels and Main Target MPs
Summary
• Prominent politicians continue to attract the most abuse (e.g. Boris Johnson, Matt Hancock, Priti Patel, Keir Starmer), with specific events and
personal characteristics or online engagement also influencing levels of
abuse, as we previously reported [1]
• The individuals receiving the most sustained abuse are Boris Johnson and
Matt Hancock. In fact, Boris Johnson only fell below average abuse levels
toward the end of August. Matt Hancock never falls below that average
throughout the entire period studied
• Both Boris Johnson and Matt Hancock received their highest levels of
abuse in December 2020, with the combination of Brexit negotiations and
continued COVID-19 challenges intersecting.
This section examines the overall abuse levels during the seven month period of
this study and analyses reactions to members of different political parties and the
UK government, as well as presents a brief gender-based comparison.
In Tables 1, 2, and 3, we present an overview of our data. The columns show, for
each time period, the number of original tweets authored by MPs, the number of
retweets authored by them, the number of replies written by them, the number of
replies received by them, number of abusive replies received by them, and abusive
replies received as a percentage of all replies received by the MPs. Table 1 shows the
current period covered by this paper, from June - December 2020. Table 2 shows a
comparison with the previous COVID-19 periods we studied from February - May
2020 [2], Table 3 shows a comparative table for periods studied before and during
the 2017 and 2019 General Elections. We can see that the stress from COVID-19
and the Brexit negotiations correspond with higher levels of abuse toward British
MPs during the current period studied, particularly in October and December. We
can also see politicians communicating more during this period, and receiving a
consistently high level of response from the public, which makes sense given the
current crisis.
The top 10 MPs who got the highest number of abusive replies is shown in the following bubble chart (Figure 1). The x-axis is the date from June to December 2020,
aggregated on two-week intervals, and the y-axis corresponds to the percentage of

Table 3 Abuse level statistics from the 2017 and 2019 General Elections [1].

abusive replies received, where the size of the bubble shows the absolute number
of abusive replies received. We can see that, as in our previous work, those with
considerable roles in the government or in the opposition parties receive many more
replies, and more abusive replies than MPs with less visibility. Of the governmental
figures, we see that Matt Hancock and Boris Johnson receive the most negative
attention throughout, followed by Labour leader, Keir Starmer. This is to be expected as Johnson and Hancock are most visible regarding COVID-19 preparations
and management, and Keir Starmer has been critical of the government response.
Starmer has also received abuse from more progressive members of Labour who
view Starmer as too centrist. We can expect a certain amount of party politics to
play out among the Twitter users who follow any of those individuals. The last
three individuals may have more specific issues impacting the levels of abuse they
receive. John Redwood, an outspoken Brexiteer, came under fire for two separate
issues this fall (in addition to pushback against Brexit). First, he received rebukes
for suggesting that investors take their money outside of the UK [1] . Then, after a
report was released detailing the ways in which several conservative MPs (including
Redwood) have profited from privatization in the NHS and from the COVID-19
crisis [2] , Redwood received considerable criticism. Jacob Rees-Mogg, another figure who is polarising in the British public, was also implicated in COVID-related
profiteering. However, these peaks may be explained by Rees-Mogg’s campaign and
subsequent speech in parliament last June on returning MPs to the chamber[3] .

Figure 1 Top 10 most-abused MPs, from June - December 2020.

What became known as the “Mogg-Conga”[4] (also in some of our hashtag analysis), refers to the way that members were required to file into the building to vote,
following social distancing guidelines. Rees-Mogg was also involved in a public critique of Unicef, which has offered to provide free meals to school children, when it
appeared the British parliament would not provide them. Mogg accused Unicef of
“playing politics”[5] . Priti Patel has typically attracted abuse for strong language
around migration policies. In the previous COVID-19 periods, Patel was accused
of bullying, a charge which has followed her into the current period, after Boris
Johnson chose to keep her in her role[6] .
The timeline in Figure 2 shows abuse levels overall, toward all MPs. It reflects a
per-week basis since the beginning of June. From the beginning of June it shows a
slight decrease through the rest of June, with a smaller peak at the beginning of
July, possibly as UK businesses cut more than 11,000 jobs in 48 hours. However,
by ”Super Saturday” on July 4th, when pubs and restaurants are able to reopen,
abuse levels dip back under 4%. This effect is short-lived, as abuse levels rise again
through the second half of July. Compulsory mask wearing was slowly introduced
during this time. However, this took place at different paces across the four nations,
which may have led to some confusion. There are likely to be regional differences as
well, as several lockdowns were introduced in the northern part of England. Easing
of restrictions was also postponed in some areas.
Abuse levels remain more or less steady through the rest of the summer and fall
with a sharp rise from the 18th - 25th of October. During this time, PM Boris Johnson was in a public dispute with Manchester mayor Andy Burnham over financial
support during the lockdown. London, as well, was put under increased restriction.
Across the four nations the difference in response was quite stark. Scotland introduced a 5 tier system. Wales had the firebreak lockdown. Anger over lockdown boiled

over into protests on the 24th in London with tens of thousands of participants.
In addition, rows over the government’s decision not to extend free school meals
to children in England continued over the month. However, upon further analysis
of the tweets, as our analysis above can confirm, we linked the peak of abuse in
October to another incident in which Angela Rayner referred to Chris Clarkson as
‘scum’, while he was speaking in parliament on the 21st of October. A few hours
later, Amanda Milling tweeted that this was unacceptable behaviour[7] . This tweet
got a number of abusive replies. Then, on the 23rd, Ms. Milling tweeted a request
for the Labour party to “take action against Labour MPs and party members who
perpetrate abuse”, which resulted in even more abuse. Chris Clarkson tweeted his
appreciation for her support[8] , which also received a number of abusive replies. Interestingly, when Angela Rayner tweeted on 21 Oct at 18:45, the amount of abuse
she received was relatively low (219 of 1550) in comparison to Amanda Milling’s
tweet, given that Rayner had already abused Chris Clarkson by that point.
Abuse then remains elevated at between 4% and 5% across November with another
sharp rise across December, which peaks around the 20th and is maintained across
the holiday period. With the Brexit deadline coming quickly into focus, by midmonth, 68% of the country was on the toughest restrictions and yet the government
was still promising an easing of restrictions over the holidays. Then, the new strain
in the UK was discovered mid-month, and the introduction of Tier 4 restrictions
on the 19th, ‘canceled’ holiday plans for many in England. The three other nations
made similar changes to their holiday restrictions. While abuse levels appeared to
be falling by the very end of the month, potentially as Brexit negotiations were
clarified, the effects of January’s lockdown (which effectively has kept many in the
UK on a persistent lockdown since late October) will be interesting to observe in
future work.

Figure 3 Timeline of abuse received by MPs from 2015 until end of 2020.

5 Long-term Context
To understand the level of abuse received by MPs during the COVID-19 crisis,
it is helpful to make a comparison across all of the time periods we have studied,
from General Elections in 2015, 2017 and 2019, all the way through the COVID-19
periods of our previous and current work. From the timeline shown in Figure 3, we
see that aside from a blip around the 2015 general election, abuse toward MPs on
Twitter has been tending to rise from a minimum of 2% of replies in 2015, peaking
mid-2019 at over 5% with a smaller peak of around 4.5% around the 2019 general
election. We can see that toward the end of 2020, abuse levels had reached their
highest point yet, at 5.4%.

6 Top Recipients of Abuse per Party and Gender
In Table 4, we see the top 10 MPs receiving abusive replies each month of the
studied period from June - December 2020. The numbers in brackets are showing
first the number of abusive replies against the number of all replies received. So,
for example, Boris Johnson received 12,768 abusive replies in June, out of 252,271
replies in total.
As we can see from the table, the Conservatives received the most significant
numbers of abusive replies in this period, with the top two spots occupied by Boris
Johnson and Matt Hancock. We can see the impact of the leadership contest in the
Liberal Democrats, as well as a few outspoken members of the SNP, but otherwise,
the smaller parties did not feature on this list. This doesn’t mean that they do
not receive abusive replies. In contrast with the bigger parties, however, it is less
noticeable in the larger trends and patterns we can observe. In the next two sections,
we discuss the influence of gender and party affiliation on receiving abusive replies
during COVID-19.
6.1 Difference in responses to different parties
We can see from tables 5 - 7 that the Tory party received the highest percentage
of abusive replies from July 2020 onwards, which stays above 5% starting from

Table 4 Top 10 MPs receiving the most abusive replies from June - December 2020

September 2020 onwards, as the COVID-19 crisis deepened and the Brexit negotiations with the EU started nearing completion. In contrast, the percentage of
abuse received by Labour MPs remained below 4% July 2020 onwards, continuing the trend observed from April 2020. As we argued in our previous work [2],
the attention on the Tory party most likely has to do with a combination of the
conservatives being in power during a significant crisis and the general uncertainty
in current events, with which the public is largely uncomfortable. However, in this
period, we also have the first reports of the consequences of the pandemic on the job
market [12], the economy [13], household income [14], and mental health [15, 16],
for example, which may be influencing public perception of how the Tories have
managed the crisis. The Liberal Democrats have a spike in abuse in July, most
likely reflecting confusion around the leadership contest, which was first postponed
to May 2021[9] . After a number of complaints from party members, this decision was
reversed and the election proceeded through July and August 2020 [10] . Though the
smaller parties do not receive a large portion of abusive replies, in August, we saw
a surge of abuse toward the Democratic Unionist Party, potentially toward Sammy
Wilson, who was in conflict with the government over Brexit in August 2020. As
the Brexit crisis comes to an end, abuse levels appear to level out alongside the
SNP.
6.2 Differences in abuse based on gender
Violence against women in politics is an established issue. A 2016 study indicated
that a quarter of women politicians had received some type of physical violence,

and a fifth some time of sexual violence, globally [17]. Studying instances of online
violence against women are intended to investigate this specific issue we see playing
out in the physical world, to see if we can identify additional features of suppression
or exclusion of women from politics in the online space. However, large-scale analysis of online hate and abusive language in the UK have not returned significant

Farrell et al.

differences for men and women [18]. Indeed, at first glance, our analysis of abusive
terms directed at male (Figure 4) and female MPs (Figure 5) appear to confirm
this. The reasons for this could be diverse. Lexical approaches may not capture
subtler forms of discrimination [1]. Other features may play an important role from
an intersectional perspective. For example, our work indicated that prominence and
personal characteristics are important features in online abuse. Studies from similar
contexts have suggested that gender may play a more prominent role when a woman
is a very visible government figure [19].
We know the gender identity of MPs in the UK through self-report or use of
pronouns in the media. All MPs fall into binary gender classification at the moment.
We can see from our Table 8 in the analysis that, when we looked for sexist language
that focuses on the gender of any MP, only four men feature on our top list despite
having a much higher representation in the UK political context. The women on
the list come from all major parties and the SNP. Some are quite visible on Twitter,
as seen in the number of tweets they sent during the time, for which they received
abusive replies. Some are less visible, given that the period does cover a seven-month
period.

Table 8 MPs receiving the most gendered abuse during the period studied from June - December
2020
MP Name

Figures 4 and 5 show word clouds for abuse directed at male and female MPs
(respectively).
Figure 6 shows the percentage of daily abusive replies per gender. Usually male
MPs have a higher abusive tweet ratio (not accounting for the type of abusive
language), but not always. For example, around 25 Oct, the micro-avg for female
MPs is higher than for the male ones, despite the male macro-avg is still higher.
Our analysis indicates that this was due to the conflict previously described between
Chris Clarkson and Andrea Rayner. Also after the first week of Nov (around 8th),
women MPs micro and macro average abuse exceeded those of men MPs.

which will track online abuse towards MPs during one year of COVID-19 pandemic
in the UK.

7 Topical Hashtag Analysis
In order to analyse the relationship between online abuse and topics such as Brexit,
the governments’ COVID-19 response and policies, and social issues, we conducted
two types of analysis on hashtags: quantitative and qualitative. The first type of
analysis is a frequency count of all hashtags observed in all replies during the period,
and then by abusive replies only. We generated two word clouds (seen in Figures
7 and 8) that represent hashtags used in all replies, and then in abusive replies,
respectively. In Table 9, we show the top 15 hashtags, and hashtags in the abusive
tweets directed to MPs, from June to December 2020.
As can be seen from these two tables of hashtags (Tables 9 and 10), replies to
MPs focused on a number of predominant themes, which can be categorised as:
• Dissatisfaction with government policies, e.g. tweets campaigning for the millions of people in the UK excluded from COVID-19 financial support (#ExcludedUK; #WeAreNotGoingAway); appeals to the government to change its
policies (#MakeTheUTurn) on issues such as Brexit, free school meals, and
COVID-19 financial support; the #ForgottenLtd small businesses who aren’t

Table 11 Codebook for hashtag qualitative analysis on

In June, we see several social justice issues take the forefront, possibly as a result
of global racial justice protests. Hashtags about food security, workers rights, racial
justice and global conflicts dominate this period (which we see as the olive green
line peaks in June). Counter hashtags, such as alllivesmatter, appear toward the

Farrell et al.

Page 16 of 20

end of the list and a number of the hashtags associated with abusive language refer
to social justice issues, indicating a small backlash to attention on social justice
issues. What is conspicuously missing during this time, is prominence of the Brexit
theme, despite just being 6 months away from the December 31st deadline. Some
negative attention on the conservatives begins to bubble up, after a brief period of
low (compared to the average) abuse levels at the beginning of 2020.
In July, we see the primary focus of attention shift to workers rights, and in
particular those workers whose income has been disrupted by the pandemic, but
for whom no provisions had (as of yet) been made. The exception to this shift away
from more diverse social issues is the continued support for protests in Hong Kong.
Brexit returns to the top of the hashtag themes. In terms of hashtags gathering
abusive replies, negative attention on the conservatives grows in July.
In August, a number of issues remain on the table from the previous months, including those forgotten by existing economic packages, Brexit, and negative attention on the conservatives. Concern about student A-levels arose during this period,
after it was revealed that the algorithmic approach to deciding student grades (after
cancelling 2020 exams) had resulted in marks below their teachers’ predictions for
more than a third of students[13] . Another big issue during this time concerns a report leaked in April of 2020, which detailed anti-semitism and other types of racist
and sexist abuse in the Labour party. Senior labour officials pushed back with claims
that parts of the report had been falsified or taken out of context in early August.
A push to encourage senior Labour officials to publish full reports, to clarify their
comments, emerged in response. During that same week, Dawn Butler posted on
Twitter that she had been racially profiled and stopped by the police on the road.
Rumours that she had edited this video, or misrepresented what happened lead
to attention and abuse. In September, anger and frustration with the conservative
party is prominent as financial insecurity becomes the top concern that is visible
in our analysis. While the crisis in Hong Kong is still receiving attention, concerns
closer to home take priority.
Attention to food security rises again in October, as the half-term time returns,
the question of free school meals to the docket. Again, negative attention on the
conservatives is still high. The protests in Nigeria to end the Special Anti-Robbery
Squad (SARS), a police unit accused of multiple abuses, appear in our top ten list,
in particular after the The Lekki Toll Gate Massacre on October 20th, 2020 (only
recently re-opened in February 2021).
In November, just 2 months before the Brexit deadline, attention on the topic
rises again. Negative attention on the conservatives for multiple issues during this
time, including continued dissatisfaction with job retention and financial schemes,
the cladding scandal and pressures on the NHS, continue to occupy a top position.
Nearly all of the hashtags associated with abusive content are about the conservatives, with the exception of a small amount of attention on Keir Starmer, potentially for criticising Boris Johnson heavily during this time. During Prime Minister’s
Questions, Starmer called Johnson the “single biggest threat to the future of the
UK”[14] .

Farrell et al.

Page 17 of 20

By December, concern about Brexit is really beginning to take shape. Nine of the
top hashtags are related to Brexit, four of which relate to abusive replies. Negative
and abusive attention on the conservatives occupy the other significant portion of
public attention during this time. Despite the continued lockdowns and the confusing government guidelines around Christmas holidays.

8 Conspiracy theories
Conspiracy thinking has been implicated in “prejudice, witch hunts, revolutions, and
genocide” as well as terror attacks and rejection of scientific consensus. They are also
a regular part of sense-making, in which people want to explain significant events
that do not, as of yet, have a satisfactory explanation [20]. Conspiracy thinking
has been shown to “reduce normative political engagement”, while increasing “nonnormative political engagement” [21]. This is viewed as evidence of the connection
between political extremism and violence. So, potentially lashing out at MPs with
abusive language or threats could potentially be viewed as a non-normative political
action.
In our last paper, we found more examples of conspiracy-related hashtags that
involved the origins of the virus or it’s connections to Chinese labs [2]. This is
potentially due to the lack of clear information at the beginning of the pandemic.
In our current period, top hashtags found in abusive replies to MPs (Table 12) show
that conspiracies related to covid being a scam or part of a larger plan to disrupt
the freedoms of the people are at the top. This could potentially have to do with
continued lockdowns and fears from various industries that have been unable to
trade for a considerable time period.
Some conspiracies existed before the COVID-19 crisis (kbf is actually Keep Britain
Free, which is conspiracy adjacent), whereas others are more specific to COVID-19.
We see in the narrative of tweets including these hashtags that older conspiracy
theories remerge in the context of COVID-19, such as the great reset and conspiracies about Bill Gates. These topics return again and again and represent fears that
the wealthy and powerful will seek to use their influence to control citizens. What’s
important to remember is that conspiracies often have a kernel of truth. There are
many ways that those with money and influence can shape our experiences, which
can be evidenced. However, there is no evidence of a large-scale, coordinated effort
to control world population, engage in a cultural genocide or to implant micro-chips
in our brains.
In the second part of our analysis, we performed a small manual coding exercise on conspiracy hashtags to understand what those hashtags represent. The code
“pumping up the base” had to do with any hashtag that is about communicating the
presence of a movement of those interested in that hashtag, for example, the popular
qanon slogan “Where We Go One, We Go All” (wwg1wga), or 3pointfivepercent,
which refers to the so-called critical mass required make social change[15] . Other
conspiracies implicate the government or other authorities in wanting to control
the people (such as Agenda21, or the GreatReset). This category seems to be the
most highly represented. In the second largest categories are hashtags that communicate that the pandemic is not real (such as scamdemic, covidhoax). We have

https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190513-it-only-takes-35-of-people-to-change-the-world

Farrell et al.

Page 18 of 20

also coded a smaller category of hashtags that communicate that the pandemic is
over-exaggerated (rather than completely fake, though individuals using this hashtag may believe that to be true). This includes hashtags like casedemic, which refer
to potential anomalies in reporting on COVID-19 data.

9 Conclusion
In this paper, we have presented a follow-up work to our investigation of the first
months of the pandemic, to provide an overview of trends in abuse toward UK MPs
during the COVID-19 pandemic. We have presented quantitative analysis on the
volume and frequency of abusive replies to UK MPs, as well as the various topical
hashtags that are linked to those responses. We analysed the extent to which abuse
levels appeared to be impacted by the features of party and gender, two unclear
variables from previous research. We also included a deeper qualitative examination
of the data, including a descriptive timeline of events that explain some of the levels
of abuse we see at different times, directed toward different individuals. We also
manually annotated and analysed how different clusters of hashtags appeared in
the data, and looked more closely at the representation of conspiracies in those
hashtags.
Our analyses indicate that COVID-19 has added up to 1% more abusive replies to
levels that had remained around 4% over the previous four years. We found a clear

Farrell et al.

Page 19 of 20

party difference in this period, with the Conservatives receiving the lion’s share of
abusive replies. Our hashtag analysis also confirms these findings.
While we were not able to detect considerable differences in the type of abusive
speech that women and men MPs received, women were more likely to make our
top list of MPs who receive gendered abuse.
As with our previous work, we were able to confirm that prominence, personal
characteristics and events do appear to make a difference in the amount of abusive
replies a UK politicians will receive.
