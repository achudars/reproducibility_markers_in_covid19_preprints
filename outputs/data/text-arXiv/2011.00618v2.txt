Abstract:
The current COVID-19 pandemic has motivated the researchers to use artificial intelligence techniques for
a potential alternative to reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) due to the limited scale
of testing. The chest X-ray (CXR) is one of the alternatives to achieve fast diagnosis but the unavailability
of large-scale annotated data makes the clinical implementation of machine learning-based COVID
detection difficult. Another issue is the usage of ImageNet pre-trained networks which does not extract
reliable feature representations from medical images. In this paper, we propose the use of hierarchical
convolutional network (HCN) architecture to naturally augment the data along with diversified features.
The HCN uses the first convolution layer from COVIDNet followed by the convolutional layers from wellknown pre-trained networks to extract the features. The use of the convolution layer from COVIDNet
ensures the extraction of representations relevant to the CXR modality. We also propose the use of ECOC
for encoding multiclass problems to binary classification for improving the recognition performance.
Experimental results show that HCN architecture is capable of achieving better results in comparison to the
existing studies. The proposed method can accurately triage potential COVID-19 patients through CXR
images for sharing the testing load and increasing the testing capacity.

1. Introduction:
CORONAVIRUS is a family of enveloped, positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses that are important
viral pathogens and classiﬁed within the Nidovirals order. Considering the history of coronavirus, it has
been described for over seven decades, with murine coronavirus JHM being the ﬁrst to be reported in 1949.
In 2003, the variation of the same virus reported 770 deaths from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)
[1]. Later in 2004 and 2005, severe bronchiolitis and upper respiratory tract infections were reported to be
caused by the family of the same virus. The zoonotic virus MERS, transmitted from animals to humans,
another in the list from the same family caused over 850 deaths [2]. Finally, in December 2019, pneumonialike cases were reported in the Wuhan and later identiﬁed as COVID-19. The disease has been declared a
pandemic by WHO [3] and is marked as the most severe as any other coronavirus because of its high
transmissibility and no preexisting immunity about the virus. The world is undergoing an intimidating
situation because of the pandemic novel coronavirus. Currently, over 61.8 million confirmed cases and 1.45
million deaths have been reported as of 28th November 2020, worldwide. The illness comes in the episodes
of acute severe respiratory discomfort initiating from throat pain, dry cough followed with a high fever,
fatigue, loss of smell or taste, and shortness of breath. The continued progression can lead to the risk of
serious medical disorders, such as hypoxia, dyspnea, multiorgan failure, shock, a respiratory failure which

requires manual ventilation, and the worst case (death) [4, 5]. As per the center for disease control and
prevention (CDC) report, there are many similarities between COVID-19 and flu (influenza), however, they
differ in terms of incubation period, symptom onset, shortness of breath, and loss of taste of smell.
Furthermore, the severity of the COVID-19 is much higher than the influenza whereas the COVID-19 is
more deadly than the later one [6]. The similarity between common flu (influenza) and COVID-19 is
another reason to make the testing process faster for its early detection.
The rapid increase in COVID-19 infections is creating a strain on the healthcare facilities around the globe
[7, 8]. There are multiple ways for COVID-19 diagnosis but the reverse transcription-polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR) remains the gold standard that detects the viral nucleic acid from the throat and
nasopharyngeal swabs. However, the diagnosis using RT-PCR takes more than 4 – 6 hours and has a low
viral load [9] which refers to the amount of virus found in the sputum. Moreover, due to the limited number
of test kits, machines, and human experts, the scale of testing is marginally low for developing countries.
South Korea is the first one to opt for massive testing but a lot of developed as well as developing countries
cannot follow the same strategy due to the above limitations [10–13]. Therefore, a fast way for COVID-19
diagnosis is in need for the timely trace, test, and treat (3T) strategy. Antigen testing is considered to be a
fast way of COVID-19 diagnosis but yields poor sensitivity, therefore is not recommended [14].
An alternative to conventional testing is the analysis of chest computed tomography (CT) scans for COVID19 diagnosis as it belongs to the family of pneumonia. As per the 10th revision of the International Statistical
Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) COVID-19, SARS, and MERS fall under
the category of viral pneumonia whereas the Streptococcus, ARDS, and Pneumocystis belong to the
bacterial and fungal pneumonia, respectively [15]. The radiological examination through CT scans has
shown better sensitivity in comparison to RT-PCR [9, 16], and can detect COVID-19 from weakly-positive
or negative cases declared by RT-PCR. However, despite the better diagnostics, CT-scan has some of the
problems similar to that of RT-PCR testing as they are limited in numbers and are too expensive for general
masses. Moreover, the CT suites can get contaminated with the regular visits from COVID-19 patients and
unlike nasal swabs used in RT-PCR the CT-suites are not disposable, thus, they require extensive cleansing,
which put the radiologists and the patients at greater risk [14]. As an alternate modality to CT-scans the
chest X-rays (CXRs) have been given a lot of attention for a fast COVID-19 diagnosis. It should be noted
that the RT-PCR takes about 4 – 6 hours on average whereas the CXR takes less than half an hour.
Furthermore, in case of contaminated input sample, the time gets accumulated which makes the RT-PCR
testing highly time consuming.
The ground glass opacities, peripheral, and bilateral consolidation, described by CT-scans can also be
reflected by CXR findings [16, 17]. Wong et al. [18] showed that the COVID-19 can be diagnosed using
CXRs but yield low sensitivity in comparison to RT-PCR testing. However, there have been some cases
(i.e. 9%) where CXRs were able to detect the abnormalities while the RT-PCR tests for those patients were
declared negative. It has been established that the CXRs cannot replace the RT-PCR diagnosis at this
instance but both of the diagnosing mechanisms can be used to reduce the strain on healthcare systems
worldwide. CXR can potentially be used for patient triage as the indication of pneumonia can be detected
with higher accuracy. Furthermore, the triage can be extended by distinguishing between bacterial and viral
pneumonia so that the RT-PCR resources can be spared, substantially.
The use of bio-inspired artificial intelligence algorithms and deep learning approaches have shown
promising results in many fields [19–22] and have been used extensively for the applications such as

automatic skin temperature detection, mask detection, social distancing measures, RNA strain analysis, and
so forth, during this pandemic. Researchers are actively working on improving the CXR diagnostics for
COVID-19 classification. Wang et al. [23] recently proposed COVIDNet from CXR images and have been
shown to achieve 91% sensitivity. However, there are a few problems associated with the existing methods.
First, the volume of the dataset which is quite limited due to the current public health emergency. Second,
the features are either extracted from hand-crafted methods or a single end-to-end deep learning architecture
pre-trained on ImageNet which limits the actual representation. Third, due to the high data imbalance,
achieving good sensitivity, precision, and accuracy for COVID-19 diagnosis using multiclass classification
is quite hard. Fourth, the system is limited in a sense such that it only deals with a few labels, however, the
current recognition systems are unable to elevate COVID-19 patients from the patients having flu only. The
methods are not capable of determining the severity of the case. Therefore, considering a standalone
solution for COVID-19 detection is not possible at this instance.
To overcome the above-limitations we proposed a hierarchical convolutional network (HCN). We solve the
data distribution problem by extracting feature maps from multiple pre-trained networks which is a natural
way of augmenting images images suggesting that the volume of the data increases in accordance with the
number of pre-trained networks used while keeping the number of input images same. We explore both the
feature-level and decision-level fusion strategies for the augmentation tasks. The feature representation
problem is addressed by using the first convolutional layer of COVIDNet-CXR3C [23] cascading with the
initial layers of some of the well-known pre-trained networks to extract the features. We propose the use of
ECOC conjunct with HCN to transforms the multiclass into a binary classification problem for improving
the classification accuracy and sensitivity. The advantage of using HCN is that it works well with a
relatively small dataset and the data augmentation compels the network to avoid overfitting. We present a
way to triage potential COVID-19 patients through CXR images with other ways of testing to speed- and
scale- up the testing process. We further extend our analysis to compare the performance of HCN variants
with the existing works. The class activation maps are also used to show the interpretation of the
classification results. The contributions of this study are stated as follows:
1. We propose HCN to classify COVID-19 from CXR images.
2. We propose the use of a unique method, i.e. using the first layer of COVID-19 cascaded with the
initial layers of pre-trained networks, to augment the data.
3. We propose the ECOC encoding scheme to transform the multiclass into the binary classification
problem.
4. We present a potential triage strategy for speeding and scaling up the testing process.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides a literature review of existing works.
Section 3 describes the proposed methodology. Section 4 presents the experimental results and comparison
with the existing works. This section also proposes a strategy to triage COVID-19 patients. Section 5
concludes the paper.
2. Related Work
There are a lot of research involved for practicing computer assisted systems in the domain of healthcare.
Those researches include almost all the areas of medicine and obtain efficacious results especially when
dealing with the images that are produced in the domain of medicine. For this purpose, a number of deep
learning architectures were analyzed before employing certain known neural nets. Many studies have

explored CXRimages as a surveillance tool for diagnosing and screening COVID-19 using deep learning
techniques. With relevance to the proposed work, we divide the related works section into three divisions.
The first subsection will highlight the studies using deep learning techniques specifically on the CXR
modality. The second subsection consolidate the works using CXR images for COVID-19 diagnosis, and
the third present the works focusing on feature and decision-level fusion strategies for COVID-19 diagnosis
using CXR images. CXRImages using Deep Learning: Rajpurkar et al. [24] developed an algorithm for
multiclass classification on CT scan (CXRdataset) i.e. ChestX-ray14 dataset. They built a 121 layers CNN
architecture to classify the features of the given input x-ray images to one of the 14 different classes. The
algorithm was named as CheXNet reporting an accuracy ranging from 0.73 to 0.93 for all 14 classes. The
DeepRadiology Team [25] described an approach to pneumonia detection in chest radiographs. Their
method used an open-source deep-learning object detection based on CoupleNet (a fully connected CNN)
The local and global features were extracted with the intent to classify pneumonia. The model’s accuracy
was improved further using ensemble algorithm. Jakhar et al. [26] focused on diagnosing the presence of
Pneumothorax using the frontal view of CXRimages. The segmentation techniques have been used to
extract the features and predict an output mask correspondingly. U-Net and Pretrained ResNet weights were
used to achieve detection at a very fast and accurate way with promising results. Ranjan el at. [27] used
interpolation techniques by down-sampling the high dimensional medical images and further feeding them
into the deep learning architecture. An autoencoder is created which includes an encoder, decoder and a
CNN classifier to reconstruct the input images. A combination of MSE and BCE loss were used at last to
predict the thoracic disease in the compressed domain obtained after autoencoders. Wang et al. [28] studied
ChestX-ray8 dataset with 8 different classes of disease as atelectasis, cardiomegaly, effusion, infiltration,
mass, nodule, pneumonia, and pneumothorax using deep CNN based on unified weakly-supervised multilabel image classification and disease localization formulation. This dataset was trained and tested on
different pre-trained networks like AlexNet, VGG16, GoogleNet, and ResNet-50. COVID-19 Diagnosis
with CXR images: Basu and Mitra [29] demonstrated a novel technique using transfer learning for
diagnosing COVID cases with chest X-rays. Their algorithm was named as Domain Extension Transfer
Learning (DETL) that used the Gradient Class Activation Map for finding the characteristic features from
the large dataset from different sources of radiology. The model with visual pattern was efficient for
distinguishing between classes of COVID. Ozturk et al. [30] discussed the method using DarkNet model
and used YOLO object detection system. The codes were created for assisting the radiologist for initial
testing and screening for COVID cases. A deep model using CXR images was proposed with accuracy
reported for two findings as (binary) 98.08% and for multiclass cases as 87.02%. Farooq and Hafeez [31]
studied the differentiation of the COVID-19 cases from that of the pneumonia cases using the CXRimages.
A pre-trained ResNet-50 architecture was evaluated on the two publicly available datasets by using a three
step technique. Their work includes the preprocessing steps on images as progressive resizing, cyclical
learning rate findings and descriptive learning rate findings. Kumar et al. [32] presented the use of
ResNet152 and machine learning classifiers distinguishing between cases of COVID-19 and non COVID19 on CXRimages. Different classifiers were used for evaluating the performance with an accuracy of 0.973
with Random Forest and 0.977 with XGBoost is reported in the paper. Zhang et al. [33] developed a deeplearning model which was composed of a backbone network, a classification head, and an anomaly
detection head. High-level features were generated from images using the backbone network and further
these features were passed onto the heads to extract the classification score and anomaly score. Binary
cross-entropy loss was used for classification score and deviation loss for anomaly score. Abbas et al. [34]
proposed a DeTraC CNN architecture for the classification of the CXRimages as COVID-19. DeTraC is an

acronym for Decompose, Transfer and Compose which deals with any irregularities with the help of class
boundary obtained by class decomposition method. The extra decomposition layer for adding more
flexibility to their decision boundaries was added with the motive to decompose each class into subclasses
and assigning labels to the new set of class for getting final results. The shallow tuning mode for feature
extraction was employed. The model gave high accuracy of 95.12% with comprehensive dataset of images.
Misra et al. [35] presented a multi-channel transfer learning model based on ResNet architecture on different
sets of dataset composition. 3 classes as normal, pneumonia and COVID were used as the target values. So,
they used 3 subnetwork model of binary classification for them similar as one vs all classification. Further,
a fine-tuning with another model to do to achieve the classification output. Wang et al. [23] investigated
COVIDNet to makes predictions using an explain ability method based on Deep Neural Networkbased
architecture for detection of the COVID disease. The customized lightweight design pattern was an added
advantage with reduced computational complexity. Adam optimizer was used using a learning rate policy
on different set of datasets, namely publicly available dataset and COVIDx dataset. This dataset was
generated which contains 358 COVID-19 affected X-ray images, 8066 normal x-rays and 5538 pneumonia
affected x-rays. Both quantitative and qualitative analysis was conducted on the above dataset with good
score of about 93.3% test accuracy.
Rodolfo et al. [36] discussed features and decision level fusion method by proposing resampling algorithms
for detecting COVID on CXR images. Texture descriptions were used for extracting multiple features with
CNN and several fusion techniques were used for strengthening the texture descriptions for final
classification. The results of the research tested in RYDLS-20 gave an average results of 0.65 with macro
average F-score metric using a multi-class labelled data samples and 0.89, as F-1 score for classifying
COVID-19 in the hierarchical classification case. Dhurgam et al. [37] proposed and demonstrated novel
approach of extracting features from the LBP-transformed CXR images of different types of Chest
infections, with the aim of developing an automatic CAD system to be used for distinguishing between
COVID-19 and Non COVID-19. The findings resulted an accuracy of 94.43%. Rahimzadeh and Attar [38]
proposed the concatenated neural network by capturing the features extracted from Xception and
ResNet50V2 and then fusing it to a convolutional layer that is connected to the classifier. The dataset
included 180 CXRof COVID patients, 6054 pneumonia affected X-rays and 8851 normal xray images. The
fine-tuned ResNet50V2 and Xception network predicts the result with the average accuracy as 99.56%. The
uniqueness of the proposed work can be highlighted from both fronts, i.e. learning representations and
network design. We propose a way to naturally augment the data by using first convolutional layer from
COVID-19 followed by the well-known pre-trained networks. We show that the resultant representations
are more diverse than the ones used in existing studies. Moreover, the proposed way of extracting features
uses the ImageNet pre-trained networks effectively in compliance with the transfer learning dynamics. We
also propose the use of ECOC for label encoding in order to transform the multiclass into binary
classification problem which to the best of our knowledge has not been explored yet. Furthermore, this
study explores various fusion strategies using the proposed learning representations and the network
architecture so that the strategy attaining best results can be selected for comparative analysis.
3. Proposed Method
The proposed architecture for HCN is shown in Fig 1. The hierarchical networks are opted due to their
topological flexibility for handling iterative algorithms and cascaded networks. As mentioned earlier, we
use the first convolutional layer of pre-trained COVIDNet followed by the initial layers of well-known pretrained networks to extract the feature maps. The COVIDNet is an open source deep neural network design

for detecting COVID-19 from CXR images. The pooling layers are designed such that they down-sample
and up-sample the feature maps depending on the stage they are employed and selects a single response by
performing convolution-sum fusion. The maps are then encoded for their labels using the ECOC technique.
The ECOC techniques are categorized as meta-learning method which transforms the feature space in hot
encoded values and solves the multi-class classification problem through employing multiple binary
classifiers. The feature maps along with their encoded labels are then trained using DarkNet19 network
architecture. The DarkNet19 architecture serves as a backbone convolutional neural network for YOLOv2,
a famous object detection framework. The details for each of the blocks in Fig 1 are provided in the
subsequent sections.
3.1 Datasets
We employ the COVIDx dataset proposed in [23] to evaluate the COVID detection performance using
HCN. The dataset comprises of 13,975 CXR images obtained from 13,870 patients. The reason for the
discrepancy in the number of patients and CXR images is due to the fact that at times multiple images are
obtained from the same patient. The COVIDx dataset is the combination of five publicly available dataset
repositories such as COVID-19 radiography database [39], RSNA Pneumonia detection challenge dataset
[40], ActualMed COVID-19 CXR dataset initiative [41], COVID-19 CXR dataset initiative [42], and
COVID-19 image data collection [43]. All the above-mentioned datasets are open to the public and are
continuously updated constantly. One of the motivations of this work was to deal with the low volume of
CXR images representing COVID patients. The COVIDx dataset has around 5,5328 and 8,066 CXR images
for Normal and Bacterial Pneumonia, respectively, whereas only 358 CXR images are available for
COVID-19 patients (Viral Pneumonia). The high data imbalance justifies our motivation for using
activation maps from multiple pre-trained networks to increase the volume of COVID positive CXR
images. We adopt the dataset generation method from [23]. We used the same number of training,
validation, and testing images as of COVID-19 so that a fair comparative analysis could be carried out. We
follow all the ethical policies and guidelines suggested by the authors of different datasets, accordingly.
3.2 Convolutional Layer from COVIDNet
We made our basis earlier that using the networks pre-trained on ImageNet might not provide us better
feature representations that are supported by the research community. Veronika cheplygina [44] conducted
a study to provide a stance on whether the use of ImageNet pre-training is useful in medical imaging studies
or not. The conclusion of the said study was: “it depends” suggesting that if the volume of the data is small
then it’s better to use a pre-trained network rather than initializing the weights randomly, however, if the
volume of data is enough then the network should be trained on medical images from scratch. Raghu et al.
[45] also conducted a similar study and suggested that although the ImageNet pre-training is not beneficial
in terms of accuracy and precision it does provide faster convergence. In compliance with the existing
studies, we use the first convolutional layer from COVIDNet [23] to process the feature maps. The first
layer has a convolutional filter size of 7x7 with a stride of 1x1. The feature dimensions are set to be 48 but
the subsequent pooling layer will select a single response (as discussed in the next subsection).

Figure 1 The proposed HCN-FM architecture

As the COVIDNet model was designed by GenSynth, the authors do not provide the architecture code
directly. Therefore, we used the checkpoint utilities from tensorflow python training package, along with
the index and the pre-trained model (.data) file provided by the authors of COVIDNet [23] to obtain the
weights of the first convolutional layer (conv1_conv/kernel). Intuitively, we assume that using the first
convolutional layer from COVIDNet provides a better justification of transfer learning than by using
standalone network architectures pre-trained on ImageNet (natural and colorful images). As the COVIDNet
leverages the principles of residual network architecture, we compare the feature maps extracted from the
first convolutional layer of well-known networks designed with residual connections such as ResNet50,

DenseNet201, GoogleNet, and SqueezeNet pre-trained on ImageNet and the one extracted from the first
convolutional layer of COVIDNet as shown in Fig 2. To get a single response we use the max pooling layer
for the aforementioned convolutional layers, accordingly. The visual difference in the feature maps is quite
apparent. The feature map from the pre-trained networks extract some low-level information based on
intensity levels which is beneficial for natural and colorful images but does not contribute much to the
medical images, whereas the feature map from the COVIDNet’s convolution layer focuses on the lung areas
which is the cornerstone to detect COVID-19.

Figure 2 Feature maps extracted from the first convolutional layer of COVIDNet and well known pre-trained networks such as
ResNet50, GoogleNet, DenseNet201, SqueezeNet, pre-trained on ImageNet.

3.3 Pooling Layer
In the proposed HCN-FM architecture the first pooling layer is responsible for two operations. The first is
the max pooling from the convolutional layer of COVIDNet and the second is the reversible downsampling
𝐻

of the feature maps into three sub-images. Subsequently, the tensor ℓ of size 𝑊 × 3 × 𝐶 is formed and
provided as an input to the initial layers of well-known convolutional networks pre-trained on ImageNet
where ℓ refers to the feature map, and W, H, and C represent the width, height, and channel, respectively.
Zero-padding is performed to keep the size of the feature map compliant with the input size of pre-trained

convolutional networks. Similarly, the second pooling layer also comprises of two operations. The first is
the fusion of feature maps to provide a single feature response. Studies working on image analysis have
extensively applied multiple fusion strategies to improve the recognition performance [46, 47] which
include sum, convolution, convolution-sum, and so forth. As suggested in [46, 47] the convolution-sum
strategy performs better than both the sum and convolution fusion strategies, therefore, in this study we use
the convolution-sum strategy in our second pooling layer. Let ℓ𝑑 ∈ ℝ𝐻×𝑊×𝐷 represent the 𝑑𝑡ℎ feature map
where 𝑑 = 1, … , 𝐷. The convolution-sum fusion function 𝒻 performs four steps: (1) concatenation, (2)
convolution, (3) dimension reduction, and (4) summation. The feature maps ℓ𝑑 and ℓ𝑑−1 will be
concatenated at spatial locations. The convolutional operation is performed through the filter banks which
are defined in equation (1).
ℓ𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑣−𝑠𝑢𝑚 = 𝒻 𝑠𝑢𝑚 (𝒻 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑣 (ℓ𝑑 , ℓ𝑑−1 ), ℓ𝑑 )
where 𝒻 𝑠𝑢𝑚 = ℓ𝑑 + ℓ𝑑−1 and 𝒻 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑣 = (ℓ𝑑 ⧺ ℓ𝑑−1 ) ∗ 𝑓𝑖𝑙𝑡 + 𝑏𝑖𝑎𝑠

(1)

The summation function is just the summation of feature maps with respect to their spatial locations as is
denoted by “+". The concatenation operation is represented by “⧺” which concatenates the features maps
horizontally. The convolution operation represented as “∗” is applied through the filter banks and biases
such that 𝑓𝑖𝑙𝑡 ∈ ℝ1×1×2𝑤×ℎ and 𝑏𝑖𝑎𝑠 ∈ ℝℎ , respectively. A weighted combination of feature maps is
generated through the convolution operation at spatial location 𝑤 × ℎ followed by the reduction in
dimension therefore the resultant feature representation will retain the actual size of the map. The second
operation executed at this pooling layer is upscaling of feature map performed by the reverse operator from
the first pooling layer to produce the map with the same W, H, and C, as the input.
3.4 Initial Convolutional Layers from pre-trained networks
We use initial convolution layers from multiple network architectures pre-trained on ImageNet. Naturally,
the question arises as to why we do not use COVIDNet layers as feature extraction? This work aims to
extract diverse features to augment the data and in turn increasing the data volume. The problem with using
COVIDNet layers as feature extraction is that we lose the diversification of feature maps. Furthermore, the
characteristics of COVIDNet in the feature maps are retained from each pre-trained network architecture
as the forward pass of the CXR image is propagated through the first convolution layer of the said network.
The size of the extracted feature map from each pre-trained network is kept constant by branching off the
networks at a specific layer. For instance, ResNet50, DenseNet201, GoogleNet, and SqueezeNet [48–51]
are branched off at 38th, 54th, 28th, and 29th layer, respectively, to get a 28x28x128 feature responses with
added zero-padding to maintain the consistency in image size. The diversified feature maps from the first
convolutional layer of the aforementioned pre-trained networks preceding the first convolution layer of
COVIDNet is shown in Fig 3.

Figure 3 Feature maps from the first convolutional network of the pre-trained networks preceded by the COVIDNet
convolutional layer

3.5 Label Encoder
The extracted feature maps will be assigned an encoded label using error-correcting output code (ECOC)
in the form of {-1, 0, +1} where 0 represents the non-participating class, -1 and +1 refers to the negative
and positive class, respectively. An example of encoded labels for CXR images is shown in Fig 4. The
encoded labels will be assigned to each image for each hierarchy. For instance, a feature map will first be
assigned either -1 or +1 for the first hierarchy and the darknet19 architecture will be trained on the encoded
labels, accordingly. Similarly, the same feature map will undergo the second hierarchy and assigned a label
amongst 0, -1, or +1 followed by the darknet19 training. This is how the multi-class problem is transformed
into a binary class. Let 𝒸 define the number of classes and 𝓀 be the length of the coding matrix, then the
encoding matrix 𝓏 for the ECOC will be of the size {−1, 0, +1}𝒸×𝓀 . The underlying assumption for using
the coding matrix is that each column of 𝓏 will have 𝓀 classifiers (binary) which implies that the feature
maps 𝓏𝒸𝓀 comprising of +1 or -1, i.e. positive or negative label, trains 𝓀 classifiers based on 𝒸 − 𝑡ℎ label
and the 𝓏𝒸𝓀 having 0 encoded value will not participate in the training of 𝓀 − 𝑡ℎ classifier. We are only
interested in the encoded labels assigned to the feature maps by the 𝓀 − 𝑡ℎ classifier instead of directly
classifying them, the idea is to optimize the separation of feature maps based on their class labels through
encodings to represent a binary classification problem. The hierarchical assignment of encoded values will
be continued until a leaf node occurs. The weights and biases are characterized as 𝒲 and ℬ, respectively.
We adopt the joint binary classifier learning (JCL) framework and the optimization method from the studies
[52, 53]. The principle optimization problem is shown in equation (2)

The variable 𝛿 refers to the mismatch loss between the actual encoded label and the predicted encoding.
The notation 𝑛 refers to the number of training samples, specifically the number of feature maps used for
training. The first constraint in equation 2 refers to the coding variable 𝜗 which can take the values
{−1,0, +1} representing the label 𝒸. The variables 𝒲, ℬ, {α} are the optimizable parameters that define the
decision boundary as presented in the second constraint. The third constraint represents the hinge loss. The
term 𝜏 in the fourth constraint refers to the tolerance level which is introduced to maintain the balance. The
last constraint ensures that there is at least one positive and one negative class available. Equation 2 is
optimized for the label encodings such that the labels are separable through a decision hyperplane. In the
training phase, the label encodings are provided based on the categorization in Fig 3, but the equation 2 is
optimized for the testing phase so that the images are assigned the label encodings so that the specific
trained model could be activated for classification. For more details regarding the optimization problem,
refer to the study [53].

problem where +1 and -1 represent the positive and negative class, and the 0 refers to the confusing class
ought to be ignored in the training and at the inferential stage.
3.6 DarkNet19 architecture
The reason for choosing DarkNet19 architecture is that it is as accurate as ResNet architectures but takes
4x less time to train [54, 55]. It is apparent from the recent studies on COVID-19 diagnosis that the volume
of viral pneumonia CXR images are less in number. Therefore, to balance the distribution of data we use
the bootstrapping method with sample replacement at the batch level. We fine-tune the DarkNet19 network
pre-trained on ImageNet with ADAM optimizer [56] having an initial learning rate of 0.003, batch size of

32, and an exponential decay rate of 0.00005 after every 3 epochs. We train the network for 40 epochs. We
used the rotation, translation, flipping, and zoom augmenting strategies for fine-tuning the network.
3.7 Fusion Strategies
The image analysis studies use fusion strategies extensively to improve recognition performance. We
evaluate four different kinds of strategies that vary based on computational complexity and the number of
parameters. We evaluate decision-level fusion strategy with meta-learning, decision-level fusion strategy
with weighted averaging, feature-level fusion, and without fusion. The strategies are listed in their
descending order suggesting that the decision-level fusion strategy with meta-learning comprises a large
number of parameters and high computational complexity whereas the training without fusion has the
lowest number of parameters and lower computational complexity amongst all the strategies. The decisionlevel fusion needs separate streams to be trained for encoded labels in a hierarchical fashion suggesting that
a separate DarkNet19 network will be trained on features extracted from ResNet50 and so forth. The
probabilities from each of the streams will be combined either using a meta-learning strategy [53] or
weighted averaging [47]. The feature-level fusion combines the feature maps using gradient-sum pooling
[47] and trains a single DarkNet19 architecture for the encoded labels in the proposed hierarchy. We refer
to the decision-level fusion with meta-learning as HCN-DML, decision-level fusion with weighted
averaging as HCN-DWA, feature-level fusion as HCN-FLF, and without fusion as HCN-FM. The use of
the aforementioned fusion strategies with reference to the proposed architecture is shown in Fig 5. The
HCN-FM represents a cross-modal training architecture [47] where the diverse features are trained using a
single-stream. On the other hand, HCN-DML, and HCN-DWA takes an opposite approach by training an
individual stream for a single modality. We adopt the implementation of HCN-DML from [53], HCNDWA, and HCN-FLF from [47], respectively.

Figure 5 Application of fusion strategies with reference to the proposed architecture. HCN-FM  HCN without fusion, HCN-FLF
 HCN with feature-level fusion, the feature maps are fused using gradient-sum pooling [47], HCN-DML  HCN with metalearning based decision-level fusion, the probabilities of the classified labels are trained using a shallow-learning classifier [53],
and HCN-DWA  HCN with weighted averaging based decision-level fusion, the probabilities of the classified labels are combined
through weighted averaging and the class with maximum probability is selected.

4. Experimental Results
This section first provides the details for the dataset employed in this study followed by the quantitative
and qualitative analysis for evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed HCN-FM. We also perform
ablation studies to select the best fusion strategy, accordingly. Furthermore, this section presents an
implication of the proposed work in the form of a strategy for the triage of COVID-19 patients to support
other testing approaches.
4.1 Ablation Study
As the proposed hierarchical classification network employs various fusion strategies, it is essential to
evaluate each of the strategies quantitatively. This will allow us to investigate not only the test accuracy but
also the trade-off between the accuracy and computational complexity. We evaluate HCN-DML, HCNDWA, HCN-FLF, and HCN-FM using sensitivity, specificity, precision, and accuracy metric on test set
images from the COVIDx dataset. The results are shown in Table 1. The results show that the HCN-DML
achieves the best result in terms of sensitivity, specificity, precision, and accuracy, accordingly. It makes
sense as the HCN-DML has the highest computational complexity in comparison to the other strategies. An
interesting finding here is that the HCN-FM performs better than the HCN-DWA that performs a weighted
averaging on the probabilities obtained using four different network streams. Additionally, the HCN-DWA
has the second-highest computational complexity whereas the HCN-FM has the lowest one and the least
number of parameters.

We assume that the resultant classification probabilities are quite close to each other for individual streams
which makes it difficult for a weighted averaging scheme to differentiate them. On the other hand, the
HCN-FM represents a cross-modal learning strategy but in this case, the cross-modality is represented at
the input level, i.e. the feature maps. It has been shown in the literature that cross-modal learning in some
cases benefits from the diverse representations and might achieve better results than the multi-stream
networks [47]. The lowest recognition rate is obtained using HCN-FLF which is apparent as it uses a single
response for training the network stream. The HCN-FLF does not leverage the natural way of data
augmentation as proposed in this study. However, the results obtained using HCN-FLF are on par with the
COVIDNet, respectively. It should also be noted that the HCN networks also use a bootstrapping technique
to balance the distribution of the samples as well as the ECOC technique to transform the multiclass to the
binary class classification problem.

We evaluate the two best networks, i.e. HCN-DML and HCN-FM with and without bootstrapping and
ECOC technique to get a deeper understanding. The results are reported in table 2. The results show that
the transformation to binary class problem plays a vital role in improving the COVID recognition
performance from CXR images. The bootstrapping does help in enhancing the sensitivity and precision but
the improvement is not significant. The important aspect of this ablation study is that it shows even without
using ECOC and bootstrapping the HCN-DML achieves considerably better sensitivity which highlights
the intrinsic properties of the proposed HCN and the usefulness of deriving diversified representation.
However, the HCN network has been designed to tackle the challenge of detecting COVID-19 from CXR
images when using fine-grained labels, such as Streptococcus, Legionella, Pneumocystis, Klebsiella under
the category of bacterial pneumonia, and SARS, MERS, ARDS, COVID-19 within the viral pneumonia

category. The ECOC has proved to be beneficial in improving the performance with a large number of
labels [53], although, the increase in performance is not significant using 3 labels with respect to the HCNDML but still the encodings improve the performance rather than degrading it. It is also to be noted that the
use of ECOC and bootstrapping is supported by the results from HCN-FM where the absence of these
techniques results in reduced sensitivity, i.e. 83.00% for viral pneumonia. The results highlight that the
ECOC and bootstrapping technique compliment each other for improving the recognition performance. It
should also be noted that the sensitivity for almost all the HCN variants is above 90% which is quite
acceptable considering that the clinical experts achieved 69% for the same when diagnosing COVID-19
from CXR images. Moreover, the sensitivity of RT-PCR which is currently the gold standard has been
recorded to be 91% [18].
4.2 Qualitative Analysis
We illustrate the visualization of saliency maps using the Grad-CAM method [57] in Fig 6 and 7,
respectively. The figures 6 and 7 shows the broad main lesion learned by the network to classify COVID19 patients, correctly. It was noticed that the particular map is only activated in COVID-19 CXR images
whereas no saliency map was observed with Bacterial or Normal CXR images as shown in Fig 8. The
images support our previous analysis where HCN achieves better sensitivity analysis than the gold standard.
Moreover, the Grad-CAM maps can also be used for the interpretability of the CXR images while providing
insights to the radiologists through main lesions which might be helpful for clinical diagnosis.

4.3 Comparison with the existing works
All of the experiments reported in this study have been conducted on a GPU NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080Ti
with 32GB RAM and Intel Core i7 clocked at 3.4 GHz. The COVID pandemic is recent therefore, the
studies centered towards diagnosing COVID-19 from a limited amount of annotated images are quite less.
We compare the proposed HCN architecture with three of the studies that are considered to be state-of-theart approaches. The first one is the COVIDNet whereas the second and third are proposed in [14] and [58].
The comparison between the HCN architecture and the state-of-the-art approaches is shown in table 3. It
should be noted that we used the same dataset along with the same training and testing protocols to perform
a fair comparison. The overall accuracy achieved by HCN-FM and HCN-DLM is 96.67% and 95.33%

which outperforms the results reported in [14], [58] and COVIDNet, i.e. 91.9%, 94.72%, and 93.33%,
respectively. Furthermore, the proposed method shows significant improvement in terms of both, the
sensitivity and the precision, accordingly. The training time for HCN-FM and HCN-DLM was noted to be
1055, and 2926 seconds, whereas the testing time for both the networks, was noted to be 3, and 8 seconds,
respectively. We do agree that the proposed HCN architecture is more computationally complex than that
of [14], [58], and COVIDNet but considering the inference time, reliability of clinical diagnosis, and the
ongoing pandemic situation, we believe that the accuracy weighs more than the computational complexity.
Some studies proposed the COVID-19 detection from CXR images using the COVIDx dataset but their
evaluation is either based on the same protocol as of [23] or they perform the binary classification, i.e.
COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients. We compare the performance of HCN with the other recent
studies in terms of accuracy in table 4. It is evident that the proposed HCN architecture outperforms the
recent studies for detecting COVID-19 from CXR images.

4.4 Triage of HCN for COVID-19
As discussed earlier in this study, the limitation of the gold standard testing, i.e. RT-PCR is due to the
shortage of testing kits and expert resources, especially in the developing countries. Keeping in view the
current spread of the COVID pandemic, the developed countries also face the shortage of testing kits and
medical capacity. It is therefore a need to explore all possible resources and distribute them based on
‘triage’. The patients with cough or mild fever rush to the testing facility to get themselves diagnosed. It
has been explored by existing studies that people with such symptoms mostly suffer from bacterial
pneumonia [62]. The study [62] also suggests that viral pneumonia stands at the third common cause of
pneumonia preceded by the S. pneumonia and H. influenza, respectively. For some geological regions,
tuberculosis is also considered to be a common cause of pneumonia [62]. The takeaway from the study [62]
is that the major portion of patients suffering from the flu, cough, or mild fever might have bacterial
pneumonia or tuberculosis rather than COVID-19. Conducting their tests through the gold standard RTPCR will be a waste of time as well as resources that can be effectively managed through the CXR image
diagnosis.
Based on the HCN architecture we present a triage workflow that could help distribute and manage the
limited resources during this pandemic in Fig 9. The diagnosis through CXR images is much faster than
that of RT-PCR which could be leveraged using HCN architecture. Specifically, the proposed method can
distinguish between patients having normal, bacterial, and viral pneumonia. The ones diagnosed with viral
pneumonia can be considered for further testing through RT-PCR or CT scans to double-check or validate
the diagnosis. This will not only save the medical resources but will also help in speeding up the diagnosis
and early isolation of the suspected cases, hence slowing down the spread of COVID-19.

Figure 9 Triage workflow using HCN architecture

5. Discussion and Conclusion
With the current spread of COVID-19 pandemic, the efficient utilization of medical resources is an
important issue. The gold standard RT-PCR testing at a large scale is not possible for developing or
developed countries. The patient management based on triage is the only option to test the patients and
early isolation of the suspects. The CXR and CT scans are potential alternatives to RT-PCR testing.
Unfortunately, CT scans suffer from the same problem as of RT-PCR which leaves us with CXR images.
To make the diagnosis faster, the use of artificial intelligence can be leveraged by analyzing the CXR
images in an automated way. However, the use of artificial intelligence requires a high volume of annotated
data which is currently the main problem related to CXR image diagnosis.
In this regard, we proposed the HCN architecture which uses the first convolution layer from COVIDNet
followed by the well-known pre-trained architectures to extract the feature representations. This is a natural
way to augment the annotated data. Furthermore, we proposed the use of ECOC to transform the multiclass
into a binary classification problem for improving the recognition performance. We also performed an indepth analysis based on the fusion strategies to select the HCN variant with the best recognition
performance. The results from the proposed HCN architecture were also verified through qualitative
analysis (Grad-CAM) which showed that the activations in the saliency maps are triggered only in the
COVID-19 patients’ CXR. It should be noted that the proposed work is not designed to elevate COVID-19
from flu, rather the HCN differentiates between viral pneumonia, bacterial pneumonia, and normal CXR
images. As per CDC guidelines [6], only 15% of the patients with COVID-19 develop severe symptoms
which leads to pneumonia but the same body characterizes COVID-19 in the family of viral pneumonia.
However, it can observed from the HCN’s Grad-CAM that it only triggers the activation in the saliency
map when the COVID (viral pneumonia) is detected rather than the bacterial or fungal infection. The
categorization of the bacterial and viral pneumonia in our study is in line with ICD10, thus, we consider the
categorization justified. Furthermore, we compared the proposed work with existing state-of-the-art works
and showed that the HCN yields better recognition performance. Finally, a triage workflow has also been
laid out for showing the real-world applicability of the proposed work.
Even though we report the state-of-the-art results, the proposed work has some limitations for its
applicability to the real-world setting. The first limitation is regarding the availability of the limited labeled
dataset. Although, this work proposes a natural way of augmenting the data still the dataset is too small to
be applied to real-world settings. The second limitation is the label constraints with respect to the dataset.
The images are labeled as normal, bacterial, and viral pneumonia, however, there are many classifications
within these three labels. For instance, bacterial pneumonia includes Streptococcus, Legionella,
Pneumocystis, Klebsiella, and more whereas viral pneumonia includes SARS, MERS, COVID-19, and
ARDS. The current system is not designed either to elevate COVID-19 patients from the ones having flu
or to classify the severity of the cases. It is in line with the previous limitation, i.e. limited labeled data,
accordingly.
One of the benefits of using HCN is the ability to deal with multiple labels by leveraging the concepts of
ECOC. As per the medical community, the diseases such as Pleural effusion, Pulmonary edema, Pulmonary
fibrosis, and Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) yield the same characteristics of lung
shrinking in terms of CXR visualization, which can be added to the bacterial variant of pneumonia.
However, the point is, there is a need for large-scale annotation with extended labels. As the proposed HCN
uses ECOC, it can be helpful to build a recognition system with a large set of labels for differentiating

amongst several diseases. As our future work, we want to coordinate with experts to build a database of
such diseases to not only detect the disease but also to rate the severity of each disease through CXR images.
