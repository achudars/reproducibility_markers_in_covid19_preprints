basis of their coherence and centrality in order to identify a cluster of sentences which would be regarded as key disinformation.
In addition to a binary sentence-level judgement on whether sentences contain key disinformation as described above, we target to

RELEVANT WORK

As outlined earlier, there has been an abundance of work on automated approaches for fake news detection. In this section, we focus on techniques that attempt to analyze sub-article level information for combating fake news, aligning well with our goal of identifying key disinformation sentences within articles. The research
in the space of sub-article level disinformation spans across multiple fields including ML and NLP, and most of them target one
of the following objectives: claim identification, claim verification
and verdict justification/explanation. Broadly speaking, the main dimensions on which the existing approaches differ include: (i) claim
representation and identification method; (ii) evidence used in the
process; (iii) method used for automated fact checking, and (iv) final verdict representation. For (i), claims are often represented as
subject-predicate-object triple (e.g. mobile-cause-cancer) or textual
fragments. In both cases, the main challenge is the non-trivial level
of processing required to extract the claim from a text. The most
common approaches rely on a combination of NLP and ML [10].
Within (ii), existing fact checking systems include those that restrict attention to just the information within the claim, and those
that seek additional evidence beyond the claim. The former estimate the veracity of a claim using surface-level linguistic features
[19] and additional metadata like author’s history of previous false
claims [27]. The fact checking task itself (i.e., (iii)) is often defined
as a supervised learning problem. It involves construction of a text
classification model using labelled data, such as existing claims previously annotated as fake or non-fake. The classifier is further applied to assign fake/non-fake label to a new claim [19, 27] or to
detect fact-check worthy claims [11]. Text classification only considers features extracted from the claim itself or the author’s profile
and does not rely on any other sources of evidence. Evidence based
methods commonly consider fact checking as a knowledge graph
analysis problem in order to predict whether an unobserved triple is
likely to appear in the graph [4, 23, 25]. Another common approach
casts fact checking as a textual entailment task, modelled to predict
whether a document or its part is for, against or observing a given
claim [7, 20], or in order to retrieve sentence-level evidence for
the claim [12]. Methods that rely on repositories of previously fact

checked claims are mainly based on sentence-level textual similarity [10, 25]. Task (iv), in the simplest scenario, is just about providing a true/false output directly from a binary classification engine
[18]. Alternatively, multi-class labels over a multi-point scale [19],
or a numerical range indicating how likely a claim is to be true [2]
are used.
Against the backdrop of claim-based and NLP-oriented data science solutions, we propose a significantly different task formulation, that of scoring sentences based on their contribution to the
overall article disinformation. While we haven’t come across work
addressing this particular task, we will evaluate our method against
state-of-the-art claim detection and summarization methods. Our
task is designed to be invoked on only those news articles that are
known to contain disinformation; thus, identifying disinformationladen articles is a task that is upstream to ours. In addition to a variety of supervised learning methodologies that seek to accurately
identify articles as containing fake news or not, there has been recent interest in unsupervised fake news detection as well. Such unsupervised methods widely varying in character, with techniques
capitalizing on synchronous user behavior [8] and emotions [13].
Other more subtle features such as lexical [22] and thematic [21]
have also been found to be useful to differentiate fake news from
real news without the aid of supervision.

3 TASK DEFINITION
Consider a document 𝐷 which is known to contain some disinformation. Let the document comprise 𝑛 sentences; 𝐷 = [𝑠 1, 𝑠 2, . . . , 𝑠𝑛 ].
Our task targets unsupervised scoring of sentences at a per-document
level, in a way that the scoring correlates with the contribution of
the sentence to the overall disinformation within the document.

learning

(1)

We would like to consider two scenarios, with each 𝑟 𝑖 to be either a binary or numeric value indicating whether/how much 𝑠𝑖 contributes to the disinformation within document 𝐷. We call the setting of binary 𝑟 𝑖 as the identification task, and the numeric 𝑟 𝑖 setting
as the scoring task. Unlike the formulation of similar tasks such as
claims detection which are typically formulated within supervised
settings, we address the unsupervised identification/scoring problem.

3.1 Motivation and Positioning the Task
As outlined earlier, we start with the assumption that the article in
question, 𝐷, contains disinformation. This task is thus designed to
be downstream to the disinformation identification task that determines whether or not a news article contains disinformation. Once
an article has been identified to contain disinformation, the simplest
strategy to present it to the user would be using a warning pop-up,
or in cases where the disinformation identification is implemented
in a browser plugin, to issue a warning before displaying the article
webpage. This is analogous to the usage of warnings in Twitter1 ,
where a tweet of suspected credibility is hid behind a warning. As
may be obvious, articles identified not to contain disinformation

ReSCo-CC: Unsupervised Identification of Key Disinformation Sentences

will not be intercepted in any way. However, as noted in the EU report [5], such a paradigm of presenting disinformation risks undermining freedom of expression as well as the diversity of the news
media ecosystem, and democratic liberal values in general. The task
of key disinformation identification offers a pathway towards addressing this issue, that of enabling selective highlighting of key
disinformation sentences in an article. Such selective highlighting,
with appropriate indicators, as well as perhaps shortcut links to authoritative information on the topic of the sentence, would align the
presentation paradigm with a much more democratic model focusing on user empowerment and positive engagement (as alluded to
earlier). Thus, the key disinformation identification task enriches
the fake news detection pipeline with presentation opportunities in
line with cherished democratic values. Any improvements achieved
in the upstream task of disinformation identification will evidently
be compelementary to this task, and would enrich the upstream part
of the pipeline.

RESCO-CC: OUR METHOD

Our method, codenamed ReSCo-CC, targets to address both the
identification and scoring tasks outlined in Section 3. Our approach
consists of three distinct phases; (i) representing sentences in a bespoke feature space, (ii) clustering the sentence representations, and
(iii) choosing sentences based on clustering output. We describe
these in separate subsections herein.

4.1

Bespoke Feature Space for Sentences

We undertook a qualitative study of various fake news articles as
well as literature on fake news from journalism with a view of understanding the aspects that could contribute to sentences within it
being regarded as core disinformation. Our focus was on identifying sentence characteristics indicative of core disinformation content that may be considered as sufficiently generic - so it would not
need additional fine-tuning to work for niche sub-domains - with
an additional preference towards characteristics that are amenable
to computational modelling. Our analyses indicated that there are
at least three kinds of sentences within a disinformation-laden document; sentences that contain key disinformation, sentences that
cushion the key disinformation through providing (tangential) truthful information, and sentences that are oriented towards smoothening the overall flow. Based on this observation, we distilled three
key sentence characteristics from our study, viz., relevance, smoothness and coherence, abbreviated together as ReSCo, which forms
the basis of our bespoke feature space for key disinformation identification. These three features bear significant complementarities,
relevance being a document-level feature, smoothness being a more
fine-grained feature estimated at a sub-article level, whereas coherence is a sentence-level feature assessed in reference to a knowledge base. We describe them herein.
4.1.1 Relevance. Consider each sentence 𝑠𝑖 as being represented
using a vector 𝑣𝑖 . While any sentence embedding could be used for
𝑣𝑖 , we model 𝑣𝑖 as the average of the pre-trained Google word2vec
word-level embeddings2 . Now, the relevence of each sentence wrt
𝐷, denoted as 𝑟𝑒𝑙 (𝑠𝑖 ) is calculated as:
2 https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/

iiWAS ’20, November 30-December 2, 2020, Chiang Mai, Thailand

𝑟𝑒𝑙 (𝑠𝑖 ) =

1
×
𝑛−1

Õ

𝑐𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑒 (𝑣𝑖 , 𝑣 𝑗 )

(2)

𝑗 ∈{1...𝑛 },𝑗≠𝑖

Thus, the relevance is quantified as the average of sentence level
similarities between 𝑠𝑖 and each other sentence in 𝐷, estimated using the chosen vector representation. Under this formulation, which
has a flavor of document-level summarization, sentences that bear
higher similarities with a larger number of 𝐷’s sentences will be
scored higher. In other words, sentences that are semantically central to the document are likely to achieve higher 𝑟𝑒𝑙 (𝑠𝑖 ) scores.
4.1.2 Smoothness. Smoothness measures how well each sentence gels with sentences on either side of itself. We quantify it
using the same vector representation 𝑣𝑖 (as introduced above) as:


𝑐𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑒 (𝑣𝑖 , 𝑣𝑖+1 )




𝑠𝑚𝑜 (𝑠𝑖 ) = 21 × 𝑐𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑒 (𝑣𝑖−1, 𝑣𝑖 ) + 𝑐𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑒 (𝑣𝑖 , 𝑣𝑖+1 )


𝑐𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑒 (𝑣𝑖−1, 𝑣𝑖 )


𝑖=1
1<𝑖 <𝑛
𝑖 =𝑛
(3)
Thus, this is a local feature, quantified using the similarity between each sentence 𝑠𝑖 and it’s adjacent ones. Intuitively, it measures how well 𝑠𝑖 maintains the local ’flow’ of information in the
document, with those that offer a smooth flow being accorded higher
𝑠𝑚𝑜 (.) scores.
4.1.3 Coherence. Unlike the above two measures, coherence measures the coherence of a sentence in reference to an external knowledge base. First, we identify mentions of Wikipedia entities within
each sentence using entity linking methods [9]. We denote the set
of entities identified within a sentence as 𝐸 (𝑠𝑖 ). We then use the
Wikipedia2Vec method [30] in order to map each entity 𝑒 ∈ 𝐸 (𝑠𝑖 )
to a vector, denoted as 𝑣𝑒 . We regard coherent sentences as those
that refer to a number of related entities, yielding the following formulation for coherence:
𝑐𝑜ℎ(𝑠𝑖 ) =

Í

𝑒,𝑒 ′ ∈𝐸 (𝑠𝑖 ),𝑒≠𝑒 ′ 𝑐𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑒 (𝑣𝑒 , 𝑣𝑒 ′ )

Í

𝑒,𝑒 ′ ∈𝐸 (𝑠𝑖 ),𝑒≠𝑒 ′

1

(4)

Thus, 𝑐𝑜ℎ(𝑠𝑖 ) measures the average of pairwise similarities between entities mentioned within 𝑠𝑖 . As a feature of 𝑠𝑖 independent
of all other sentences in 𝐷, this stands very complementary to the
relevance and smoothness features.
4.1.4 Illustration. We now illustrate the qualitative difference between the above three features using extracts from a fake news article in the dataset we use in our experiments, in Table 1. As maybe
noted therein, the top-scoring sentence on each for the features are
quite different qualitatively. The top-Rel sentence is seen to be quite
central to the article, whereas the top-Smo sentence identifies a region of very smooth flow of text, whereas the top-Coh sentence is
seen to talk about very related entities (e.g., antibiotics and bacteria).
We do not imply that the top-scored sentences are likely to be key
disinformation, but simply that these are useful and complementary
indicative features to capture; more details on using ReSCo for key
disinformation identification and the motivation on using the three
features will follow.

Eczema is the most common skin disease worldwide.
A new clinical trial is testing a natural treatment that researchers hope will provide a
long-term solution for those dealing with the dry, itchy and painful skin that comes with
chronic eczema.
The trial uses a cream containing beneficial bacteria to fight harmful bacteria on the skin.
While it may seem counterintuitive to treat bacteria with more bacteria, experts say this
approach seeks to restore the natural microbial balance of healthy skin.
"There are over 1,000 species of bacteria that all live in balance on healthy skin, some
that even produce natural antibiotics."

Powerful antibiotics are commonly prescribed for eczema, but they kill good bacteria on
patients’ skin along with the bad.

Rel

Experts say there is more research to be done, but that the goal of the trial is to discover
the best combination of bacteria to clear eczema from the skin and then make it available
to patients as a prescription cream.

...

4.2

Clustering

Having represented the sentences within 𝐷 in the R3 ReSCo space
as above, we now cluster 𝐷 to form groups of sentences that are
coherent in the R3 ReSCo space. This may be accomplished by any
clustering algorithm; we use the popular centroid-based partitional
clustering algorithm, 𝐾-Means [17]. 𝐾-Means requires a parameter,
the number of clusters in the output. Given that individual articles
may vary much in the number of sentences they contain, we use the
elbow method [14] to choose the value of 𝐾. The elbow method is
a popular method of choosing the number of clusters in the data in
a mathematically principled manner [24] that involves choosing a
trade-off between competing criteria of fewer clusters and more coherent ones; in particular, it chooses the point beyond which returns
of choosing larger numbers of output clusters saturate.

4.3

Identification and Scoring of Sentences

It would rightly appear that each of the ReSCo features are correlated with what may be regarded as readability and quality, and one
may be left wondering how such a set of features would lend to disinformation identification. This brings us to the key intuition and
heusitic within our method. While relevance, smoothness and coherence are all individually good characteristics, the combination
poses trade-offs due to some conflicting elements across them. A
good quality article, i.e., one that is crafted to deceive the reader into
believing the disinformation, would comprise sentences, each of
which would excel in any one, or perhaps two, of those features. For
example, a sentence that delves into some minor important points
in the overall narrative would suffer on relevance, and sentences
that connect different sub-narratives would suffer on smoothness
and coherence. In other words, good quality articles encompass a
bouqet of sub-narratives held closely together, making individual
sentences unable to optimize on all ReSCo features. On the other
hand, two key observations from our qualitative analysis guide the
formulation of our identification/scoring method. First, we observe

that fake news authors ensure that key disinformation sentences are
not particularly disadvantaged on any of the ReSCo features; this
is implicitly due to the urge to optimize on readability and quality. Given that optimizing for all are quite challenging, this leads
to key disinformation sentences being positioned close to the centroid of 𝐷’s ReSCo space. Secondly, the positioning in the ReSCo
space is strongly influenced by the style of the author and the topic
in question, making it likely that the key disinformation sentences
are all very close to each other in the ReSCo space. These lead to
our two key heuristics, Centrality and Cohesion, for identification
and scoring of key disinformation sentences. With cohesion being
enforced by the clustering step, the key disinformation sentences
are those belonging to the cluster whose centroid is closest to 𝐷’s
ReSCo space centroid; this cluster is denoted as 𝐶 ∗ :
𝐶 ∗ = arg min 𝑒𝑢𝑐𝑙 (𝑎𝑣𝑔{𝑅𝑒𝑆𝐶𝑜 (𝑠)|𝑠 ∈ 𝐶 }, 𝑎𝑣𝑔{𝑅𝑒𝑆𝐶𝑜 (𝑠)|𝑠 ∈ 𝐷})
𝐶 ∈C

(5)
where C is the set of all clusters output from the clustering step,
𝑅𝑒𝑆𝐶𝑜 (𝑠) being the 3-d ReSCo space representation of sentence 𝑠,
and 𝑒𝑢𝑐𝑙 (.) denoting the euclidean distance. The binary output for
the identification task is computed as:
(
1 𝑠𝑖 ∈ 𝐶 ∗
(6)
𝑟𝑖 =
0 𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑤𝑖𝑠𝑒
In other words, the identification task is accomplished by choosing all sentences in the cluster whose ReSCo-space centroid is closest to that of all sentences within 𝐷. The 𝑟 𝑖 output for the scoring
task computes a score for all sentences in 𝐶 ∗ based on its proximity
to 𝐶 ∗ ’s centroid. Sentences belonging to the other clusters are left
at 0.0; this is shown as below:
(
𝑐𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑒 (𝑅𝑒𝑆𝐶𝑜 (𝑠𝑖 ), 𝑎𝑣𝑔{𝑅𝑒𝑆𝐶𝑜 (𝑠)|𝑠 ∈ 𝐶 ∗ })

The scoring provides a way to discriminate among sentences in
𝐶 ∗ ; especially, if 𝐶 ∗ contains many sentences and a top-𝑘 needs to
be chosen, the selection may be done using the scoring in Eq. 7.
This completes the description of our method, codenamed ReSCoCC, that uses ReSCo features and the Centrality and Cohesion heuristics to perform key disinformation identification.

4.4

ReSCo-CC: The Overall Method

The overall method is outlined in Algorithm 1. The first two steps
correspond to the design of the ReSCo space, with the clustering
in Step 3 followed by the identification or scoring process in Steps
4-5. Once the ReSCo embedding is achieved, all further steps are
linear. The computation of 𝑟𝑒𝑙 (.) in achieving the ReSCo embedding, however, is quadratic in the number of sentences in the document. Given that typical documents contain only 15-30 sentences,
the quadratic complexity does not pose much concern. ReSCo-CC
was found to offer turn around times of milliseconds even in quite
long documents.

EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION

We describe the experimental setup followed by results and analysis.

5.1

Experimental Setup

5.1.1 Creation of gold standard dataset. Evaluation of the key
disinformation sentence identification task would ideally require
sentence level manual labellings. Being a novel task, we have not
come across such sentence annotated datasets. Further, we found
that health domain fake news often requires signifciant domain expertise to annotate, something that we did not have access to. Thus,
we develop an innovative approach for generating labelled data for
evaluating our approach. We identified a website, healthnewsreview.org,
which targets, among other initiatives, to debunk fake health news
(hoaxes, as they call it). They produce, for each fake health news
piece, a textual refutation of the same detailing why the information in the newspiece is false. We selected 80 articles which were
debunked within healthnewsreview, to form our empirical testbed.
It may be noticed that ours is an article-level task, thus each article
is treated separately, making the small size of the dataset not an
overwhelming concern, not as much for scenarios that do corpus
level learning. We use simple statistical methods over the dataset
comprising (ℎ𝑜𝑎𝑥, 𝑟𝑒 𝑓 𝑢𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛) pairs, to arrive at a disinformation
scoring for each sentence in the hoax article. For each sentence 𝑠
in the hoax (the hoax file is also the same that will be input to the
method as 𝐷), the score is as follows:

iiWAS ’20, November 30-December 2, 2020, Chiang Mai, Thailand

𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒 (𝑠) = 𝑎𝑣𝑔{𝑐𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑒 (𝑤𝑜𝑟𝑑2𝑣𝑒𝑐 (𝑠), 𝑤𝑜𝑟𝑑2𝑣𝑒𝑐 (𝑟 ))|𝑟 ∈ 𝑟𝑒 𝑓 𝑢𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛}
This estimates 𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒 (𝑠) as the average similarity that sentences in
the refutation have, with 𝑠. The refutation narratives in healthnewsreview were found to focus on the key disinformation sentences
in the hoax. Given that, we expect that 𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒 (𝑠) estimated as average similarities to the refutation sentences to approximate the
disinformation-ness of each sentence; we verified this assumption
through manual perusal of a significant fraction of the dataset. Thus,
high 𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒 (.) would be associated with sentences that hold key disinformation. We call this {. . . , 𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒 (𝑠𝑖 ), . . .} vector as the refsim
vector, short for refutation similarity. This vector holding similarities to the refutation forms our gold standard labelling for experiments; as may be obvious, the refutations and thus the refsim vector
are not available to the methods, and are used only in evaluation.
We are making this dataset - comprising both the (hoax, refutation) pairs and the refsim vectors - available in the public domain,
at http:// member.acm.org/ ~deepaksp > Publications > Entry for
ReSCo-CC paper.
5.1.2 Evaluation metrics. We measure the effectiveness of the
binary and scored versions of the 𝑟 𝑖 estimates from ReSCo-CC against
the 𝑟𝑒 𝑓 𝑠𝑖𝑚 vector using two evaluation models. Firstly, for the identification setting, our task is to compare the 𝑟 𝑖 s which are in {0, 1}
with the numeric 𝑟𝑒 𝑓 𝑠𝑖𝑚 vector. As a natural method for comparing
two vectors, we use the Pearson product moment correlation coefficient. Pearson correlation co-efficient has been popular in evaluating NLP methods, and has been extensively used in evaluating
methods in shared tasks such as SemEval [3] and others3 . Second,
for the scoring task, our intent is on understanding whether the high
𝑟 𝑖 values indeed correlate with the highest scored sentences from
𝑟𝑒 𝑓 𝑠𝑖𝑚. Towards bringing this into a standard information retrieval
evaluation model, we discretize/truncate the gold-standard 𝑟𝑒 𝑓 𝑠𝑖𝑚
vector by retaining the top-𝜌 sentences according to 𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒 (.) as key
disinformation and others as not, forming a binary labelling. Now,
the ranking offered by 𝑟 𝑖 s is evaluated using NDCG [28] to measure whether they rank the key disinformation (i.e., top-𝜌) sentences
highly enough. NDCG is the de facto measure for evaluating ranking quality in information retrieval (an analysis of its theoretical underpinnings appears at [28]); the construction of NDCG accounts
for not just whether the expected results appear in the top-𝑘, but
also quantifies how close to the top the correct results appear. We
also vary the 𝑟𝑒 𝑓 𝑠𝑖𝑚 discretization/truncation parameter 𝜌 to study
the effectiveness trends. For both these metrics, higher values are
desirable and correlate with better effectiveness. Each of these are
computed at the document level; we report the average of these measures over the 80 documents in our dataset.
5.1.3 Baselines and Setup. Given that our task is novel, there
exist no methods in literature addressing the precise task. Thus, we
adapt methods for related tasks to serve as baselines in our empirical evaluation. Our task of key disinformation sentence identification/scoring has a similar structure in construction to claim detection (typically supervised) and document summarization (typically
unsupervised, like our task). Algorithms for both tasks are capable

5.3 Qualitative Analysis
of operating in the binary output model (as in our identification task)
and the scored model (as in our scoring task). Thus, we use state-ofthe-art techniques from these tasks as baseline methods; these are (i)
a fact-checking oriented supervised claim detection method [1] (we
abbreviate it to CD) trained over IBM Debator dataset, and (ii) the
deep learning-based document summarization method from a very
recent paper [6] that has been shown to produce good document
summaries. In addition to these, we also evaluate against variants
of our method formed by dropping each of the centrality and cohesion assumptions, to arrive at an ablation study. First, we omit centrality and focus on cohesion by choosing the most coherent cluster,
the one that has the highest average pairwise similarity between its
members; we call this ReSCo-Coh. Similarly, we relax the cohesion
criterion and rank sentences based on their similarity to the dataset
centroid along the ReSCo features; this is called ReSCo-Cen. In order to achieve robust results (given the randomness in the clustering
initialization step), we report results averaged over 100 iterations.

5.2

Results and Analysis

Tables 2 and 3 list the results of the comparative evaluation of our
method against the four baseline techniques based on the evaluation measures of correlation co-efficient and NDCG respectively. It
may be noted from Table 2 that ReSCo-CC achieves significantly
higher performance than the baselines, with the second best one,
CD (which is notably a supervised technique, being trained over
the IBM Debator dataset), being left far behind. These trends continue over into Table 3 as well, across varying values of 𝜌. Across
both these settings, we carried out the two-tailed t-test4 , wherein it
was observed that ReSCo-CC gains over each of the baselines were
staistically significant with a p-value < 0.01. While all techniques
show an increase with increasing 𝜌, it may be noted that NDCG is
more meaningful for low values of 𝜌. For example, at the extreme
case, setting 𝜌 = 𝑛 is equivalent to considering all sentences in the
document as key disinformation sentences, making it meaningless
since all techniques would score 𝑁 𝐷𝐶𝐺 = 1.0 by design. Given this
construction of the evaluation, we find it very promising to note that
ReSCo-CC scores 0.856 even at a relatively low value of 𝜌 = 3. In
addition to the improvements over CD and Summ, it is seen that
ReSCo-CC outperforms both ReSCo-Coh and ReSCo-Cen by very
large margins, indicating that the combination of clustering and cohesion is very pertinent to core disinformation detection within our
method, and relaxing either one would lead to significant drops in
accuracy.

Table 4 illustrates the ReSCo-CC outputs on a part of a sample document; we have chosen eight sentences from a part of the document
with key disinformation for illustration. The first column indicates
the binary identification output from ReSCo-CC for the sentence in
the second column, with the last (third) column populated with the
refsim score associated with the sentence. The article excerpt starts
with largely true sentences introducing bipolar disorder (sentence
#1) and standard treatments for it (#2), followed by introducing the
main point, that of a dubious probiotics based treatment (#3) backed
up by a spurious study (#4). Then, as is typical of good hoaxes, it
moves to some truthful details about probiotic bacteria (#5 and #6)
before once again moving back to references to disinformation (#7
and #8). It may be noticed from the ReSCo-CC outputs that disinformation sentences are being identified correctly, and that the refsim
scores (the external scores computed using the refutation document
which are unavailable to ReSCo-CC, and used only in evaluation)
also are correlated well with the disinformation in the document.
Towards analyzing ReSCo-CC on the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we tested on a number of COVID-19 fake news and obtained promising results. For example, in a popular debunked post5 ,
ReSCo-CC correctly identified the key disinformation, that lemon
would ’alkalize’ the immune system among the top disinformation
sentences. Within our COVID-19 analysis, ReSCo-CC was found to
identify the core disinformation in each case. We hope to do a rigorous COVID-19 analysis as data accumulates within healthnewsreview.org, our data source for hoax-refutation pairs.

6 CONCLUSIONS
We considered a novel task, that of identifying/scoring key disinformation sentences within long textual articles that are known to
be disinformation-laden, motivated by applications to health fake
news, and proposed an unsupervised method for the same. Our
method makes use of three features, viz., relevance, smoothness and
coherence, as well as two cross-sentence assumptions, cohesion and
centrality, within a clustering-based construction over sentences in
a document. Based on an empirical evaluation over a wide variety
of baselines over a task-specific dataset that we curated (to be made
public), we illustrate that our method is very effective in identifying
core disinformation sentences within disinformation laden health
related articles.

6.1 Future Work
In the light of recent and hitherto unseen interest in health disinformation owing to the COVID-19 situation, we are considering

𝑟𝑒 𝑓 𝑠𝑖𝑚

About 3 million people in the US are diagnosed every year with bipolar disorder,
a psychiatric condition characterized by dramatic shifts inood from depression
to mania.
Currently, the standard treatment includes a combination of psychotherapy and
prescription medications such as mood stabilizers and antipsychotics.
However, an emerging field of research is exploring the use of probiotics–often
thought of as "good bacteria"–as a potential new avenue for treatment of bipolar
and other psychiatric mood disorders.
And a new study from Baltimore’s Sheppard Pratt Health System, conducted by
a research team led by Faith Dickerson, finds that a probiotic supplement may
reduce inflammation of the gut, which is known to exacerbate bipolar disorder.
Probiotic organisms are non-pathogenic bacteria that, when present in the gut
flora, are known to improve the overall health of the host.
Studies have shown that the intimate association between the gut microbiome
and GI tissue has a significant effect on the GBA.
There is also mounting evidence linking imbalances in the microbial species that
make up the gut microbiome to a number of health problems including allergies,
autoimmune disorders, and psychiatric mood disorders.
In the case of bipolar disorder and the GBA, previous studies have shown that
inflammation, or overstimulation of the body’s immune system, is a contributing
factor in the disease.

further technological avenues of deepening democratic practices
in combating disinformation. In particular, we are developing an
evidence-based medicine approach towards annotating key disinformation sentences with information obtained through queries over
trusted medical databases such as TRIP6 , towards allowing users to
verify and ascertain the disinformation themselves. We are also considering usage of captions of images that appear embedded within
text articles to further improve key disinformation identification; the
images and thus captions obviously relate to key elements in the
article providing complementary input to improve disinformation
assesment.
