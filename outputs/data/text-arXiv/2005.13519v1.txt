ESTIMATES OF THE PROPORTION OF SARS-COV-2
INFECTED INDIVIDUALS IN SWEDEN
HENRIK HULT AND MARTINA FAVERO

Abstract. In this paper a Bayesian SEIR model is studied to estimate the
proportion of the population infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19. To capture heterogeneity in the population and the effect
of interventions to reduce the rate of epidemic spread, the model uses a timevarying contact rate, whose logarithm has a Gaussian process prior. A Poisson
point process is used to model the occurrence of deaths due to COVID-19 and
the model is calibrated using data of daily death counts in combination with
a snapshot of the the proportion of individuals with an active infection, performed in Stockholm in late March. The methodology is applied to regions in
Sweden. The results show that the estimated proportion of the population who
has been infected is around 13.5% in Stockholm, by 2020-05-15, and ranges between 2.5% − 15.6% in the other investigated regions. In Stockholm where the
peak of daily death counts is likely behind us, parameter uncertainty does not
heavily influence the expected daily number of deaths, nor the expected cumulative number of deaths. It does, however, impact the estimated cumulative
number of infected individuals. In the other regions, where random sampling
of the number of active infections is not available, parameter sharing is used
to improve estimates, but the parameter uncertainty remains substantial.

1. Introduction
To understand the spread of the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, at an aggregate
level it is possible to model the dynamic evolution of the epidemic using standard
epidemic models. Such models include the (stochastic) Reed-Frost model and more
general Markov chain models, or the corresponding (deterministic) law of large
numbers limits such as the general epidemic model, see [3]. There is an extensive
literature on extensions of the standard epidemic models incorporating various degrees of heterogeneity in the population, e.g. age groups, demographic information,
spatial dependence, etc. These additional characteristics make the models more
realistic. For instance, it is possible to evaluate the effect of various intervention
strategies. More complex models also involve additional parameters that need to
be estimated, contributing to a higher degree of parameter uncertainty.
A problem when calibrating, even the standard epidemic models, to COVID-19
data is that there are few reliable sources on the number of infected individuals.
Publicly available sources provide data on the number of positive tests, the number
of hospitalizations, the number of ICU admission and the number of deaths due
to COVID-19. In some cases, small random samples of an active infection may be
available. For example, the Swedish Folkhälsomyndigheten performed such a test

in Stockholm with about 700 subjects in early April 2020. Moreover, there is still
no consensus in the literature on the value of important parameters such as the
basic reproduction number R0 and the infection fatality rate.
A useful approach to incorporate the parameter uncertainty in the models is to
consider a Bayesian framework. In the Bayesian approach parameter uncertainty
is quantified by prior distributions over the unknown parameters. The impact of
observed data, in the form of a likelihood, yields, via Bayes’ theorem, the posterior
distribution, which quantifies the effects of parameter uncertainty. The posterior
can be used to construct estimates on the number of infected individuals, predictions
on the future occurrence of infections and deaths, as well as uncertainties in such
estimates.
In this paper an SEIR epidemic model with time-varying contact rate will be
used to model the evolution of the number of susceptible (S), exposed (E), infected
(I), and recovered (R) individuals. A time varying contact rate is used to capture
heterogeneity in the population, which causes the rate of the spread of the epidemic
to vary as the virus spreads through the population. Moreover, the time varying
contact rate allows modeling the effect of interventions aimed at reducing the rate
of epidemic spread. A Poisson point process is introduced to model the occurrence
and time of deaths. Random samples of tests for active infections are treated as
binomial trials where the success probability is the proportion of the population in
the infectious state.
The methods are illustrated on regional data of daily COVID-19 deaths in Sweden. It is demonstrated that, by combining the information in the observed number
of deaths and random samples of active infections, fairly precise estimates on the
number of infected individuals can be given. By assuming that some parameters
are identical in several regions, estimates for regions outside Stockholm can also be
provided, albeit with greater uncertainty.
Our approach is inspired by [4] where the authors considers a Bayesian approach
to model an influenza outbreak. The main extensions include the introduction
of the Poisson point process to model the occurrence of deaths, the addition of
random sampling to test for infection, and an extension to multiple regions. To
evaluate the posterior distribution we employ Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
sampling. Samples from the posterior are obtained using the Hamiltonian Monte
Carlo algorithm, NUTS, by [9], implemented in the software Stan, which is an open
source software for MCMC.

2. Background
To model the spread of the epidemic we consider the deterministic SEIR model
[1, 5], which is a simple deterministic model describing the evolution of the number
of susceptible, exposed, infected, and recovered individuals in a large homogeneous
population with N individuals. The epidemic is modeled by {(St , Et , It ), t ≥ 0},
where St , Et and It represent the number of susceptible, exposed and infected individuals at time t, respectively. The total number of recovered and deceased
individuals at time t ≥ 0 is always given by N − St − Et − It . The epidemic starts

from a state S0 , E0 , I0 with S0 + E0 + I0 = N , and proceeds by updating,
St It
,
N

− νEt ,
N
= It + νEt − γIt .

St+1 = St − β

It+1

The parameters are the contact rate β > 0, the rate ν of transition from the
exposed to the infected state and the recovery rate γ > 0. Note that It represents
the number of individuals with an active infection at time t, whereas N − St is the
cumulative number of individuals who have been exposed, and possibly infected,
recovered or deceased, up until time t.
In the context of the COVID-19 epidemic the contact rate cannot be assumed to
be constant, primarily due to interventions implemented in the early stage of the
epidemic. Moreover, as the SEIR model describes the evolution at an aggregate
level, a time varying contact rate may be used to capture inhomogeneities in the
population. If, for example, the epidemic is initiated in a rural area the contact
rate may be rather low, but as the epidemic reaches major cities the contact rate
will be higher. The resulting SEIR model with time varying contact rate is given
by

t It
,
 St+1 = St − βt SN

(1)
Et+1 = Et + βt N − νEt , ,

It+1 = It + νEt − γIt .
Clearly, one needs to put some restriction on the amount of variation of the contact
rate. In this paper a Gaussian process prior will be used on the log contact rate,
which restricts the amount of variation in time, but is sufficiently flexible to capture
the reduction in contact rate after the interventions.
When observations on the number of infected and recovered individuals are available, the model (1) can be fitted to these observations. In the context of COVID-19,
observations on the number of infected and recovered individuals are unavailable.
There are many symptomatic individuals who are not tested and potentially a
large pool of asymptomatic individuals. In this paper we will rely on the number
of registered deaths due to COVID-19 to calibrate the model. In addition we will
incorporate the test results from a random sample that provides a snapshot on the
number of individuals with an active infection.
3. A Poisson point process for the occurrence of deaths
To model the occurrence of deaths due to COVID-19 we consider the following
Poisson point process representation. We refer to [10] for details on Poisson point
processes. Let f denote the infection fatality rate, that is, the probability that
an infected individual eventually dies from the infection. Consider the number of
individuals that enters the infected state on day t, that is, νEt . Each such infected
individual has probability f to eventually die from the infection. Conditional on
death due to the infection, the time from infection until death is assumed independent of everything else and follows a probability distribution with probability
mass function psD . Each individual that dies may be represented as a point (t, τ )
in E := {(t, τ ) ∈ N2 : τ ≥ t}, where t denotes the time of entry to the infected

4

ESTIMATES OF COVID-19 INFECTED INDIVIDUALS

state and τ the time of death of the individual. The number of deaths at time τ
can then be computed by counting the number of points on the line ∪τt=0 (t, τ ).
The number of deaths, and the corresponding time of infection and time of death
is conveniently modelled by a Poisson point process on E. Let ξ be a Poisson point
process on E with intensity
(2)

ν(t, τ ) = f νEt psD (τ − t).

We may interpret a point at (t, τ ) of the Poisson point process as the time of
infection, t, and the time of death, τ , of an individual who dies from the infection.
The number of deaths Dτ that occurs at time τ is then given by summing up all
the points of the point process on the row corresponding to τ , ξ(∪τt=0 (t, τ )). Since
the rows are disjoint this implies that D0 , D1 , . . . are independent with each Dτ
having a Poisson distribution with parameter

Throughout this paper psD is the probability mass function of a negative binomial distribution with mean sD . More precisely, a parametrization of the negative
binomial distribution with parameters r, sD will be used, where

The value r = 3 will be used throughout as this fits well with the distribution of
observed duration from symptoms to death in the study by [15].
4. Prior distributions and derivation of the likelihood
In this section we provide the assumptions on the prior distributions and derive
the expression of the likelihood of the model. Note that λτ is a function of all
the parameters of the model, θ = ({βt }, ν, γ, s0 , f, sD ). The parameters, their
interpretation and prior distribution are summarized in Table 1. Actually, since
the contact rate is positive, a Gaussian process (GP) prior will be used for the
natural logarithm of the contact rate, denoted log-GP in the sequel. The Gaussian
process has a constant mean µ and a squared-exponential covariance kernel k with
parameters α, ρ, δ such that

will be used, in combination with a random sample of n0 tests for active infection,
performed at a time t0 , when such test result is available. The number of individuals
Z with positive test result has a Bin(n0 , It0 /N ) distribution. The full likelihood is
given by:

The joint prior is the product of the marginal priors and leads, by Bayes’s theorem,
to the posterior,
pΘ|D,Z (θ | d1 , . . . , dT , z) ∝ pD,Z|Θ (d1 , . . . , dT , z | θ)pΘ (θ).
The expected number of daily deaths λτ , the cumulative number of deaths and
the cumulative number of infected individuals N −St are all functions of θ and their
distribution can therefore be inferred from the posterior pΘ|D,Z . By sampling from
pΘ|D and iterating the dynamics (1) estimates of these quantities may be obtained
along with the effects of parameter uncertainty. Moreover, predictions on the future
development of the above mentioned quantities can be obtained by extrapolating
the contact rate into the future.
As the posterior distribution is unavailable in explicit form it is necessary to
employ Monte Carlo methods. In the next section Markov chain Monte Carlo
methods are briefly described to sample from the posterior.
4.1. Multiple regions. The SEIR model (1) and the derivation of the likelihood
(3) considers a single region. In the context of multiple regions it may be reasonable
to assume that some parameters are identical. For example, when considering
multiple regions of Sweden below it will be assumed that the rate, ν, from exposed
to infected, the recovery rate, γ, the infection fatality rate, f , and the duration, sD
are identical in all regions. It is tempting to include interaction terms between the
regions as infected individuals from one region may travel to another region and
cause new infections. In this paper, it will be assumed that each region has its own
time varying contact rate that incorporates fluctuations in new infections due to
import cases from other regions.
The likelihood from multiple regions is simply the product of the marginal likelihood for the individual regions and the prior is the product of the marginal priors
for each parameter. Thus, for two regions the prior will be the product of two
Gaussian process priors for the respective log contact rates for the two regions and
the product of the marginal priors for the remaining parameters.
5. Markov chain Monte Carlo
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods in Bayesian analysis aims at sampling from the posterior distribution. This is non-trivial because the marginal
distribution of the data, which acts as normalizing constant of the posterior is practically impossible to compute. In MCMC algorithms the posterior is represented as
a target distribution. The algorithms rely on the construction of a Markov chain
whose invariant distribution is the target distribution. Standard MCMC methods are based on acceptance-rejection steps, where random proposals are accepted

6

ESTIMATES OF COVID-19 INFECTED INDIVIDUALS

or rejected with a probability that does not require knowledge of the normalizing
constant, e.g., Metropolis-Hasting and Gibbs sampling [13, 8, 6]. When the target distribution is complex and multi-modal, standard methods may lead to poor
mixing of the Markov chain and slow convergence to the target distribution.
To overcome slow mixing of the Markov chain gradient-based sampling can be
applied, which adapt the proposal distribution based on gradients of the target,
see e.g. [2]. In this paper we will employ a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampler, the
No-U-turn sampler (NUTS) by [9] in combination with automatic differentiation to
numerically approximate the gradients [7], which is implemented in the open source
software Stan.
6. Estimates and predictions for regions of Sweden
In this section the estimates of the number of infected individuals and predictions
on the evolution of the number of deaths and number of infected individuals are
provided for ten regions of Sweden. The epidemic is considered to start on 2020-0301 and interventions in Sweden began on 2020-03-16. The joint prior distribution is
the product of the marginal priors, and the hyper-parameters are specified in Table
2. The choices of hyper-parameter values are made in line with existing literature
on the COVID-19 epidemic. As a general principle we have used informative priors
on the parameters ν, γ, and sD , whereas the priors on the time-varying contact
rate {βt } and the fatality rate f are uninformative. Folkhälsomyndigheten reports
that the incubation period is usually around 5 days, which corresponds to 1/ν ≈ 5.
Similarly the expected time to recovery is around 14 days, 1/γ ≈ 14. The overall
infection fatality rate f is estimated to be in the range 0.003 − 0.013, see [14, 15].
However, since the infection fatality rate is a very important parameter we have used
an uninformative prior and simply use a uniform prior, Beta(1, 1). The expected
duration from symptoms to death is around 16 days, see [15].
Samples from the posterior are obtained using the NUTS-sampler with a burn-in
period of 500 samples and 5 000 samples after burn-in.

authority, Folkhälsomyndigheten, published the results of a random sample of 707

ESTIMATES OF COVID-19 INFECTED INDIVIDUALS

individuals performed between 2020-03-27 and 2020-04-031. It showed that 18 individuals carried the SARS-CoV-2 virus. These results are included in the analysis
as a binomial sample of size n0 = 707 and success probability It0 /N where the test
date, t0 , is assumed to be 2020-03-30.
A summary of the marginal posterior distributions is provided in Table 3. The
posterior distribution of the time varying contact rate is illustrated in Figure 1.
Note that although there is great uncertainty about the initial contact rate, the
model clearly picks up the reduction in contact rate after the interventions began on
2020-03-16. The contact rate is gradually reduced around the time of intervention
and then remains at a low level. This slow reduction of the contact is, however, not
due to stiffness of the Gaussian process kernel. We have experimented with a sharp
break-point in the contact rate at the time of intervention, but it did not provide
more accurate results. On the contrary, the data suggests that the reduction of
the contact rate is slow. The contact rate is estimated until 2020-05-01. After this
date the posterior is unreliable. This is because many of the deaths of individuals
who are infected after 2020-05-01 have not yet been observed. For this reason, the
contact rate is only estimated until 2020-05-01.
To perform estimates and predictions on the future number of daily and cumulative infections and deaths, the contact rate has been extrapolated from its value on
2020-05-01. The posterior distribution suggests that the contact rate is constant, at
a low rate, since roughly 2020-04-07, which motivates extrapolation into the future,
assuming that the interventions remains at the present level.

2020-05-01 based on data from 2020-03-01 – 2020-05-15. The graph
shows the posterior median and point-wise 95% credibility interval.
After 2020-05-01 the contact rate is extrapolated, by assuming it
will remain constant.

Figure 2 (top left) shows the observed daily number of deaths (black dots) along
with the posterior median (dark red) and 95% credibility interval (red) for the expected number of daily deaths. Figure 2 (top right) shows the observed cumulative
number of deaths (black dots) along with the posterior median (dark red) and 95%
credibility interval (red) for the expected cumulative number of deaths.
We observe that the parameter uncertainty does not substantially impact the
expected number of daily deaths and the peak of the daily number of deaths appears
to have occurred by mid April. Similarly, the expected cumulative number of deaths
in Stockholm is likely to terminate slightly above 2000.
We emphasize that this is the expected number of deaths, λτ . Since we are
considering a Poisson distribution for the
√ number of daily deaths an approximate
95%-prediction interval would be λτ ± 2 λτ , where λτ is the Poisson parameter on
day τ .
Note from the observed number of daily deaths that the empirical distribution
of daily deaths appear to be overdispersed, the variance is substantially larger
than the mean. This is likely due to reporting of the data. The data presented
at https://c19.se/ does not correct the reporting of death dates in hindsight.
A comparison at the national level with data provided by Folkhälsomyndigheten
shows that the official records of the daily number of deaths for Sweden does not
appear to be overdispersed. Nevertheless, even after smoothing the data from
https://c19.se/ by a moving average over a few days, the results of the simulations remain essentially the same.
Figure 2 (bottom left/right) shows the posterior median (dark red) and 95%
credibility interval (red) for the daily/cumulative number of infected individuals.
Although the parameter uncertainty has significant impact on the cumulative number of infected individuals, some conclusions are still possible. As of mid May, the
cumulative number of infected individuals has almost reached its terminal value
and the spread of the epidemic has slowed down significantly. The estimated cumulative number of infected individuals is 13.5% of the population in Stockholm.
The estimated number of infected individuals by 2020-04-11 is 10.7%, showing that
these results are well in line with the reports of the anti-body test performed at
KTH2, which indicated that 10% of the population in Stockholm had developed
anti-bodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus by the first weeks of April.
We emphasize that the estimate of the cumulative number of infected individuals
in Stockholm relies heavily on the inclusion of results from the random sampling
performed by Folkhälsomyndigheten in late March, early April. Without this crucial piece of information similar models to the one analyzed here may provide a
significantly higher estimate on the cumulative number of infected.

The daily death counts for the regions of Sweden until 2020-05-15 are obtained
from the webpage: https://c19.se/. There is no random testing providing information on the proportion of infected individuals outside Region Stockholm. To
estimate the contact rate and the cumulative number of infected individuals in regions outside Stockholm, we have implemented the multi-region model pairwise,
with two regions in each MCMC simulation, where one region is Stockholm and
the other region is from the list above. It is assumed that the parameters ν, γ, f,
and sD are identical in both regions, but the time varying contact rate and the
initial proportion of susceptible individuals are different between the regions. The
posterior of the contact rates for the different regions are provided in Figure 3
and the corresponding estimates and predictions for the daily number of deaths,
the cumulative number of deaths, the daily number of infected individuals and the
cumulative number of infected individuals are provided in Figures 4 - 12. The
parameter uncertainty is generally high and in several regions the number of new
infections and daily deaths may still increase. Estimates on the proportion of infected individuals on 2020-05-15 in the different regions are provided in Table 4
along with 95% credibility intervals. Overall the proportions are low, far from herd
immunity.
