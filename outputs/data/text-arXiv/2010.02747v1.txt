Abstract: Revealing spatiotemporal evolution regularity in the spatial diffusion of epidemics is
helpful for preventing and controlling the spread of epidemics. Based on the real-time COVID-19
datasets by prefecture-level cities and date, this paper is aimed at exploring the multifractal scaling
in spatial diffusion pattern of COVID-19 pandemic and its evolution characteristics in Chinese
mainland. The ArcGIS technology and box-counting method are employed to extract spatial data
and the least square calculation is used to calculate fractal parameters. The results show multifractal
distribution of COVID-19 pandemic in China. The generalized correlation dimension spectrums are
inverse S-shaped curves, but the fractal dimension values significantly exceeds the Euclidean
dimension of embedding space when moment order q<<0. The local singularity spectrums are
asymmetric unimodal curves, which slant to right. The fractal dimension growth curves are shown
as quasi S-shaped curves. From these spectrums and growth curves, the main conclusions can be
drawn as follows. First, self-similar patterns developed in the process of Covid-19 pandemic, which
seem be dominated by multi-scaling law. Second, the spatial pattern of COVID-19 across China can
be characterized by global clustering with local disordered diffusion. Third, the spatial diffusion
process of COVID-19 in China experienced four stages, i.e., initial stage, the rapid diffusion stage,
the hierarchical diffusion stage, and finally the contraction stage. This study suggests that
multifractal theory can be utilized to characterize spatio-temporal diffusion of COVID-19 pandemic,
and the case analyses may be instructive for further exploring natural laws of spatial diffusion.

1. Introduction
Human beings have long been suffered from various rapidly spread epidemics. It is significant to
research the spatial diffusion regularity of infectious diseases. The most recent case of epidemic
outbreak is the well-known coronavirus (COVID-19) in December 2019 (Huang et al., 2020; Mehta
et al., 2020). Studies on the spatial diffusion pattern of COVID-19 are not only helpful for
understanding its transmission dynamics, but also for the future prevention and control of epidemics.
In literature, many studies have analyzed and modeled the spatio-temporal pattern of epidemics by
various mathematical methods (Meng et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2008; Fang et al., 2009; Kang et al.,
2020; Wu et al., 2020; YeŞİLkanat, 2020; Zhao and Chen, 2020). Conventional mathematical
methods are based on the mathematical concept of characteristic scale. If a spatial distribution bear
no characteristic length, conventional mathematical modelling will be ineffective. In this case, the
modeling idea from characteristic scale should be replaced by that from scaling. Fractal geometry
provides a powerful tool for scaling analysis (Mandelbrot, 1982), and has been widely used to
characterize complex systems (Batty and Longley, 1994; Frankhauser, 1998; Chen, 2014a; Chen
and Huang, 2019). In this study, we propose a multifractal scaling model to capture the complex
pattern and process of spatial epidemic dynamics.
Multifractal scaling analysis bears analogy with telescopes and microscopes in spatial analysis.
It provides two sets of parameter spectrums adequately quantifying the spatial patterns and the
statistical distribution of measurements across spatial scales (Stanley and Meakin, 1988; PavonDominguez et al., 2017). In recent years, growing studies have employed multifractal scaling
modeling to geospatial pattern analysis (Chen and Wang, 2013; Murcio et al., 2015; Salat et al.,
2018; Frankhauser et al., 2018; Man et al., 2019). Multifractal measures reflect a distribution of
physical or other quantities on a geometric support (Feder, 1988). The spatial diffusion pattern of
the epidemic is also the reflection of spatial organization patterns and cascade system of human
social and economic activities (Wang et al., 2020). Previous studies have found that the spatial
distribution of population exhibits multifractal structure (Semecurbe et al., 2016; Appleby, 1996;
Chen and Shan, 1999; Liu and Liu, 1993). And the epidemic infections spread among the population.
Population may be the geometric support of multifractal distribution of Covid-19 pandemic. In this
study, we are trying to figure out whether the spatial diffusion pattern of COVID-19 shows
2

multifractal characteristics as well, and what can be learned from the spatio-temporal analysis of
multifractal scaling model.
To address the above problems, we perform the multifractal scaling analyses to quantify the
spatial diffusion pattern of COVID-19 pandemic and its evolution characteristics in Chinese
mainland. First of all, we establish a spatial database of COVID-19 infections by prefecture-level
cities and date. Then, the functional box-counting method and the ordinary least square regression
method are employed to calculate the global and local multifractal parameters. The remainder of
this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the multifractal scaling model and dataset used in
this study are introduced. Section 3 details the main results of multifractal analyses. The multifractal
characteristics of the spatial pattern of COVID-19 are examined, and then two sets of multifractal
spectrums are employed to reveal detailed characteristics of the spatial diffusion pattern. Finally,
the spatial diffusion process and its stage features are illustrated by the fractal dimension growth
curves. In Section 4, the key points of the analyzed results are outlined, and related questions are
discussed. Finally, Section 5 summarizes the main inferences of the spatial diffusion pattern of
COVID-19 pandemic.

2. Methodology and materials
2.1 Multifractal model
A multifractal system is a self-similar hierarchy with cascade structure, which is based on two or
more scaling processes (Chen, 2019) (Figure 1(a)). Multifractals are also known as multi-scaling
fractals. Therefore, different subareas have different scaling behaviors and growth probabilities, i.e.,
the denser and sparser zones may display different spatial characteristics, leading to a heterogeneous
distribution. Therefore, a single fractal dimension is difficult to fully explain the patterns and
processes of complex systems in the real world (Chen, 2014; Murcio et al., 2015). The multifractal
analyses provide a series of parameters to capture detailed information about the rich structure at
fine scales, which finally appear synthesized in a multifractal spectrum of parameters (Caniego et
al., 2005) (Figure 1(b)). Generally, two sets of parameters are employed in multifractal analyses,
including global and local parameters. The global parameters include generalized correlation
dimension, D(q), and mass exponent, τ(q), and the local parameters comprise singularity exponent,
3

α(q), and local fractal dimension of the fractal subsets, f(q).

the multifractal spectrums. (a) Different hierarchical structures of regular multifractals. (b) The
multifractal spectrums composed of a series of multifractal parameters

Global parameters describe the research object from the macro level. The generalized correlation
dimension D(q) is based on Renyi’s information entropy, expressed as (Hentschel and Procaccia,
1983; Feder, 1988; Vicsek, 1989):
N ( )

(1)

where q refers to the moment order (-∞<q<∞), Iq(ε) to the Renyi’s entropy with a linear scale ε. N(ε)
refers to the number of nonempty boxes, and Pi(ε) represents the growth probability, indicating the
ratio of measurement results of fractal subset appearing in the ith box Li(ε) to that of whole fractal
copies L(ε); that is, Pi(ε) =Li(ε) /L(ε). At a specific scale ε, the larger Pi(ε) with higher growth
probability corresponds to central regions. Therefore, by changing the value of q, attention can be
focused on regions with high growth probability (q→∞), or, conversely, on regions with low growth
probability (q→-∞) (Figure 1). Another global parameter, mass exponent τ(q) can be estimated by
4

D(q) (Halsey et al., 1986; Feder, 1988):

 (q)  (q  1) D  q  .

(2)

It reflects the properties from the viewpoint of mass. The global analysis is focused on the
generalized correlation dimension D(q).
Local parameters focus on the micro-level in a multifractal system. Given to its heterogeneity,
the multifractal system has many fractal subsets, and each part corresponds to a power law:

Pi      i  q  ,

(3)

where εi refers to the corresponding linear scale of the ith box. And α(q) refers to the strength of
local singularity, also known as Lipschitz-Hölder singularity exponent, suggesting the degree of
singular interval measures (Feder, 1988). Different values of α correspond to different subsets of
multifractals. Accordingly, the number of fractal subsets with the same α value under the linear εi is
given by

N ( ,  i )   i  f ( ) ,

(4)

where f(α) refers to the local fractal dimension. Therefore, the different subset will also have a
corresponding fractal dimension, composing a singularity spectrum f(α) that changes along with α(q)
to describe the corresponding changes in the subsystem (Song and Yu, 2019).
The multifractal dimension is defined based on entropy and correlation function. With the help
of entropy, the spatial difference and space-filling pattern of COVID-19 can be characterized. With
the help of correlation function, the diffusion mechanism and controlled degree of COVID-19 can
be revealed. In this study, the main measure indexes are as follows: the generalized correlation
dimension spectrum D(q), the local singularity spectrum f(α) and three representative fractal
dimensions: the capacity dimension D0, the information dimension (Shannon entropy) D1, and the
correlation dimension D2 (Grassberger, 1983).

2.2 Data sources
The COVID-19 dataset by prefecture-level cities and date is obtained from the real-time
authorized reports from the National Health Commission and the provincial health commissions.
We collect the cumulative number of confirmed cases in Chinese mainland from Jan 11 to Feb 29,
2020, which was during the pandemic period of COVID-19 in China. Then, the COVID-19 dataset
5

is matched with the latest administrative units of prefecture-level cities in ArcGIS 10.2. The spatial
analysis database of COVID-19 is established.
The multifractal parameters of the spatial pattern of COVID-19 can be calculated by functional
box-counting method. First of all, determine a study area for fractal measurement. We make a box
nearly covering the whole range of Chinese mainland as our study area (Figure 2). Second,
transform each prefecture-level administrative unit into a point according to its geographic center.
Third, iteratively divide the box into four equal boxes, and make intersections with the point dataset.
Then, count the number of points in each box and the cumulative number of confirmed cases. Finally,
estimate the multifractal parameters by the ordinary least squares regression method based on Eq(1)(4) (Chen and Wang, 2013).

mainland (up to Feb 29, 2020)

3. Results
3.1 Multifractal characteristics of the spatial pattern of COVID-19
The log-log plots reflect the fractal features of the spatial pattern of COVID-19, and then its
multifractal characteristics are revealed by the global and local fractal dimension spectrums. First
of all, the spatial pattern of COVID-19 displays fractal features, but its fractal structure is not well6

developed. As seen in Table 1, the model has significant double logarithmic linear relation,
indicating there is an obvious fractal nature of the spatial pattern of COVID-19. And D0>D1>D2
significantly. However, the log-log plots show that the fitness is not so satisfying when q≠0 (Figure
3), implying a poor-developed fractal structure. Then, the global and local multifractal parameters
are calculated to obtain the corresponding generalized correlation dimension spectrum D(q), and the
local singularity spectrum f(α) (Figure 4). The D(q) spectrums are inverse S-shaped curves, rather
than horizontal lines. And the f(α) spectrums are winding unimodal curves, instead of a single point.
Both of them display typical signs of multifractal features. These calculations provide further
evidence that the spatial pattern of COVID-19 presents significant multifractal characteristics.

3.2 Multifractal spectrum analysis
The combination of global and local multifractal spectrums reflects the spatial diffusion
characteristics of COVID-19. Firstly, we focus on the global multifractal spectrums, namely D(q)
spectrum. Considering the spatial diffusion network of COVID-19 infections as a hierarchy, when
q→+∞, the central regions with more infections would be brought into focus, especially in Wuhan
and its surrounding areas, as well as some sub-central areas. Conversely, when q→-∞, the sparse
regions with few infections will be highlighted, mainly in the edge areas or remote areas affected
by COVID-19. In the D(q) spectrum (Figure 4(a)), the convergence value of D(q) decreased slowly
when q>0. This suggests that the spatial diffusion of COVID-19 in central regions was strictly
confined by the lockdown measures. However, when q<0, the convergence value of D(q) increased
significantly with time. This implies that the spatial diffusion in edge areas was becoming more
random and unpredictable, which was hard to control in a short term.

Figure 4. The multifractal spectrums of the spatial diffusion pattern of COVID-19 in Chinese
mainland

The local multifractal spectrums reflect the micro mechanism of the spatial epidemic diffusion.
The local singularity spectrum f(α) shows two main features: one is the right-leaning unimodal curve,
and the other is the local disorder (Figure 4(b)).
Firstly, the f(α) spectrum displays a strongly marked right-leaning unimodal curve, indicating the
spatial pattern of COVID-19 takes on global clustering characteristics. There are two basic growth
9

models of a multifractal system: if the f(α) spectrum is a right-leaning unimodal curve, it represents
the growth pattern of spatial concentration; while if the f(α) spectrum takes on a left-leaning
unimodal curve, it represents the growth pattern of spatial deconcentration (Chen, 2014a). In Figure
4(b), the f(α) spectrums reveal the spatial concentration pattern of COVID-19, indicating most of
the epidemic infections are confined in a few regions, especially around Wuhan as well as cities
closely connected with Wuhan. Thus, the timely control measures taken by Chinese government
have made positive effects. Otherwise, if the f(α) spectrum is shown as a left-leaning unimodal curve,
it implies that the spatial diffusion of COVID-19 would be too rapid to be effectively controlled.
Fortunately, that is not the case.
Secondly, the f(α) spectrum shows local disorder, implying the poor-developed fractal structure
of COVID-19. In Figure 4(b), there is a twist near the apex of f(α) curve on Jan 25. Besides, the
fitting coefficients R2 of D1 and D2 decreased over time (Table 1). These suggest that the quick
responses of Chinese government and effective control measures have blocked the spatial diffusion
of COVID-19, and further stopped the fractal development of the spatial epidemic diffusion. This
is good for the control of COVID-19.
The fractal dimension growth reflects the evolution characteristics of spatial diffusion pattern of
COVID-19 (Figure 5). The growth and diffusion are two sides of the same coin. The growth of
spatial diffusion with time usually presents as sigmoid curves (Banks, 1988). Let’s examine three
representative fractal dimensions: D0, D1 and D2 (Figure 6(a) and Table 2). Firstly, the capacity
dimension D0 roughly reflects the spatial diffusion pattern of COVID-19. The space-filling degree
of infected cities in Chinese mainland increased quickly, and then the diffusion rate slowed down.
Finally, it formed a constant spatial distribution, no longer spreading to new cities (Figure 5(e)).
Secondly, the information dimension D1 reveals the spatial difference pattern. The spatial uniformity
of COVID-19 infections firstly increased, and then the spatial difference increased gradually after
Jan 26 (Figure 5(c)). Finally, the spatial distribution of epidemic infections remained stable. The
significant decrease on Feb 12 is due to the statistical caliber adjustment of confirmed cases in
Wuhan (Figure 6(a)), but it has little effect on the overall trend. Thirdly, the correlation dimension
D2 reveals the spatial correlation of epidemic infections among regions. The spatial correlation
degree of the epidemic diffusion reached the strongest very quickly (Figure 5(b)), then became
weaker, and finally it was blocked effectively. Thus, the fractal dimension growth of spatial
10

epidemic diffusion is different from that of cities. Urban growth is a natural process of self-organized
evolution. So urban fractal dimension growth is continuous, which can be described by some logistic
functions (Chen, 2012; Chen, 2018). Nevertheless, COVID-19 is harmful to human beings, and its
growth is affected by the prevention and control measures from human beings in turn. As a result,
after a certain level of growth, its fractal dimension would be reduced (Figure 6(a)).

3.3 Stage characteristics of the spatial diffusion of COVID-19
The changing curves of fractal dimensions reflect the stage characteristics of spatial diffusion of
COVID-19 (Figure 6(a)). And the stage characteristics reveal the practical effects of prevention and
control measures taken by Chinese government. The spatial distribution maps of COVID-19
infections only roughly display the spatial diffusion pattern (Figure 5), which is inconspicuous. In
this regard, the changes of fractal dimensions play an irreplaceable role in the spatial analysis of
epidemic diffusion. According to the trend of D0, D1, D2 and their corresponding spatial meanings,
the spatial diffusion pattern of COVID-19 can be divided into 4 stages. The four stages bear analogy
with the urbanization curve which can be modeled by logistic function (Chen, 2014b).
1 The initial stage. Before Jan 19, the epidemic spread inside Wuhan, showing a single point of
○

11

burst. So the fractal dimensions are equal to 0.
2 The rapid diffusion stage. From Jan 19 to 26, the space-filling degree (D0), spatial uniformity
○

(D1) of the epidemic increased rapidly, and its spatial correlation degree (D2) reached the highest.
These suggest that the infected cities occupied Chinese mainland quickly in large-scale space. In
this stage, the long-distance diffusion was the strongest. According to the first law of geography,
geographical proximity affects the spatial correlation of regions. So it may be the basis of the spatial
epidemic diffusion (Wang et al., 2020). However, in addition to surrounding cities, the epidemic
tended to spread to remote cities from Wuhan, such as megacities (i.e., Shenzhen, Beijing, Shanghai),
provincial capital cities and some southeastern coastal cities (i.e., Wenzhou, Taizhou) (Figure 5(b)).
These cities boast a developed economy and are the main destinations of urban economic
connections. It can be inferred that the remote spatial diffusion of COVID-19 may be dominated by
economic connections with high liquidity, i.e., tourism and business travel (Shi and Liu, 2020).

Figure 5. The spatial distribution of COVID-19 infections in Chinese mainland

3 The deceleration diffusion stage. From Jan 27 to Feb 9, the diffusion rate of infections
○

decreased gradually, and the spatial difference increased. This implies that though more cities were
infected, their infections grew slower. While in central regions, their infections grew faster
significantly. Besides, the spatial correlation became weaker, implying the epidemic mainly spread
to contiguous cities from regional central cities. So it can also be described as the hierarchical
diffusion stage, dominated by contagious diffusion. As a whole, the spatial diffusion of COVID-19
infections is seemly bounded by China’s population distribution boundary (Hu Huanyong Line)
(Figure 2). This line delineates the striking difference in the distribution of China's population: about
96% of the population were settled densely in the eastern half of China, with only 36% of the total
area; while a mere 4% of the population were sparsely scattered in the spacious western part (64%)
(Hu, 1935). As seen in Figure 2 and Figure 5, the epidemic infections in Chinese mainland are
mainly located in the east of ‘Hu Huanyong Line’, which shares high similarity with the spatial
13

pattern of population distribution in China.
4 The contraction stage. After Feb 10, the spatial diffusion pattern of COVID-19 reached a
○

relatively stable state. The value of D0, D1 and D2 gradually converged, reflecting the spatial
contraction of epidemic diffusion. About two weeks after the Wuhan lockdown (Jan 23), the spatial
diffusion trend of COVID-19 has been successfully controlled in Chinese mainland. Thanks to the
implementation of Wuhan lockdown, the remote diffusion was blocked. Besides, the cooperation
mechanism on joint prevention and control among regions further blocked the contagious diffusion.
This suggests the isolation over regions and reducing inter-regional movement have essentially
blocked the spatial diffusion of COVID-19.
Corresponding to the spatial diffusion process of COVID-19, the scale growth of the cumulative
number of confirmed cases also presents stage characteristics. Studies have found that the growth
of cumulative confirmed cases takes on an S-shaped curve, which can be fitted by logistic model
(Martelloni and Martelloni, 2020; Pelinovsky et al., 2020; Consolini and Materassi, 2020; Wang et
al., 2020). In this study, two logistic functions are employed to model the scale growth of COVID19 infections from Jan 11 to Feb 29, due to the statistical caliber adjustment of diagnostic criteria
(Figure 6(b)). According to their growth rate and acceleration, the scale growth of COVID-19 can
also be divided into 4 stages: the initial stage (before Jan 19), the acceleration stage (Jan 19-Feb 5),
the deceleration stage (Feb 6-14) and the late stage (after Feb 14). It can be found that the increase
of new confirmed cases reached a peak point on Feb 5. After that, the growth rate slowed down and
remained stable in late February. While the spatial diffusion of COVID-19 has reached its peak stage
and stable stage earlier. Thus it can be seen that the development of the spatial diffusion process is
faster than the scale growth process of COVID-19 (Table 3).

4. Discussion
The above calculations show that the spatial network of COVID-19 infections in Chinese
mainland takes on multifractal characteristics. And its distribution pattern and diffusion process can
be characterized by multifractal spectrums. The key points of the analyzed results are as follows
(Table 4).
Firstly, the spatial pattern of COVID-19 is mainly characterized by global clustering and local
diffusion. Though the epidemic infections spread nationwide, few cities were hit severely. In the
15

global multifractal dimension spectrum, the convergence value of D(q) increased significantly over
time when q<0, suggesting the local diffusion of COVID-19 infections (Figure 4(a)). However, the
local singularity spectrum f(α) always takes on a right-leaning unimodal curve, implying a global
clustering pattern (Figure 4(b)). The epidemic infections in central regions were severe significantly
than in marginal regions.

Then, the spatial diffusion pattern of COVID-19 in Chinese mainland show stage characteristics,
suggesting the positive effects of prevention and control measures taken by the government.
According to the fractal dimension growth curves (Figure 6(a)), it can be divided into 4 stages: the
initial stage, the rapid diffusion stage, the hierarchical diffusion stage and the contraction stage, from
the single point of burst, multi-points spread to the overall outbreak, and finally full containment.
And the spatial correlation degree decreased with time. In general, the spatial diffusion of COVID19 has been contained in a short term. The rapid diffusion stage is the transition period of epidemic
diffusion. A series of spatial isolation measures implemented in China has played an important role
in the control of COVID-19. As a result, the highly connected population flow was isolated, and the
growth rate of infections was effectively reduced. Otherwise, the scale growth of COVID-19
infections in Chinese mainland would not display an S-shaped curve (Figure 6(b)), but rather
follows the exponential growth or power-law growth (Brugnago et al., 2020; Omer et al., 2020).

There have been lots of previous studies concentrating on spatial epidemic dynamics. Most of
them have described the spatial-temporal pattern of the epidemics by spatial autocorrelation analysis
and kernel density estimating (Meng et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2008; Fang et al., 2009; Kang et al.,
2020). Nevertheless, a critical problem with these methods is their sensitivity to the spatial scale
(Negreiros et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2019). The novelty of this paper lies in the multifractal scaling
model of spatial epidemic diffusion. The spatial diffusion of COVID-19 is a complex process,
showing irregular and scale-free features. Given this, fractal analysis is a powerful tool for spatiotemporal modeling of spatial epidemic diffusion from the perspective of scale-free analysis.
Multifractal scaling analyses provide two sets of parameters and spectrums, forming a complete
understanding of the spatial diffusion pattern of COVID-19 from general to detail. The shortcomings
of this study are as below: first, our analysis is based on the COVID-19 dataset from real-time
authorized reports, so that the incubation period is not considered. But it has little impact on the
overall trend of epidemic evolution. Second, the log-log plots display a poor-developed fractal
structure of COVID-19, which may be caused by the data quality. This study takes the prefecturelevel cities as basic spatial units, but the spatial epidemic diffusion is not bounded by the
administrative boundary. If there is more accurate location dataset of the confirmed cases, further
detailed spatial analysis can be performed in the future.

5. Conclusion
China has effectively contained the COVID-19 pandemic in a short term and has significant
performance in this epidemic prevention and control. Modeling the spatial diffusion process and
pattern of COVID-19 in Chinese mainland can provide valuable experience for future theoretical
and positive studies, and for further improvement of future public health system emergencies. In
this work, multifractal scaling model is employed to characterize the spatial diffusion pattern of
COVID-19 pandemic, based on the cumulative number of confirmed cases from the authority
reports. The main conclusions can be drawn as follows. First, the spatial pattern of COVID-19 in
Chinese mainland bears multifractal characteristics. Human population pattern may be the
geometric support of the multifractal distribution of Covid-19. The inverse S-shaped curves of
generalized correlation dimension indicate multifractal property of Covid-19 pandemic. Most of the

17

population is located in the southeastern part of China. Accordingly, most of the Covid-19 pandemic
are located in the southeast China. This implies that the spatial diffusion pattern of COVID-19 has
well coincidence relations with the spatial pattern of population in China, both in the geographical
distribution and structural hierarchy. Second, the spatial pattern of COVID-19 in Chinese
mainland is characterized by global clustering with local diffusion. The unimodal curve of the
f(α) curve also suggests the multifractal property of Covid-19 pandemic. The unimodal curve tilts
to the right, this suggests that the Covid-19 takes on aggregation pattern in China. That is to say,
large-scale infections were confined in central regions, i.e., Wuhan city and its surrounding region.
The epidemic situation in other regions was in a controllable state. This suggests the isolation over
regions have quickly contained the spatial diffusion of COVID-19. However, the generalized
correlation dimension exceeds the Euclidean dimension of embedding space. This implies
disordered diffusion of Covid-19 pandemic in some local regions. Third, the spatial diffusion
process of COVID-19 in Chinese mainland fell into 4 stages. The fractal dimension growth
curves are similar to sigmoid curves. The capacity dimension growth curve reflect the change of
space filling process of Covid-19, the information dimension growth curve reflect the change of
spatial difference of Covid-19, and the correlation dimension growth curve reflect the change of
spatial dependence of Covid-19. The space filling curve increased first and became stable rapidly.
The spatial difference and dependence curves increased first and then decreased and finally become
stable. By the three curves, the spatial diffusion process of Covid-19 can be divided into four stages:
initial stage, rapid diffusion stage, hierarchical diffusion stage, and the contraction stage.
