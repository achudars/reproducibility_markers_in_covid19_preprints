To describe the dynamics of social distancing during pandemics, we follow previous efforts to
combine basic epidemiology models (e.g. SIR - Susceptible, Infected, and Recovered) with game
and economy theory tools. We present an extension of the SIR model that predicts a series of
discontinuous transitions in social distancing. Each transition resembles a phase transition of the
second-order (Ginzburg-Landau instability) and, therefore, potentially a general phenomenon. The
first wave of COVID-19 led to social distancing around the globe: severe lockdowns to stop the
pandemic were followed by a series of lockdown lifts. Data analysis of the first wave in Austria,
Israel, and Germany corroborates the soundness of the model. Furthermore, this work presents
analytical tools to analyze pandemic waves, which may be extended to calculate derivatives of giant
components in network percolation transitions and may also be of interest in the context of crisis
formation theories.
I.

INTRODUCTION

Pandemics are complex medical and socioeconomic
phenomena[1]: frequent social interactions benefit both
the spread of disease and significant parts of modern
economies[2, 3].
Rational human behavior during
pandemics suggests a balance between individual efforts
to avoid getting infected and the economic costs of
protective measures[4, 5]. This balance changes with
time and disease prevalence[6]. This work argues that
this balance, together with the corresponding human
behavior, may possess discontinuous transitions similar
to the free energy of a system during the GinzburgLandau phase transition and may have some level of
universality[7–11].
Social distancing is an effective tool to mitigate
epidemies[2, 3]. It consists of self or government-imposed
constraints on interpersonal contacts. Social distancing,
however, comes at a significant economic cost in terms of
reduced productivity[4, 12].
Social distancing depends on epidemy dynamics and
vice versa[1, 6, 13, 14]. Epidemy dynamics are known
through daily-reported amounts of infected and deceased
persons (see Figure 1 for mortality due to Spanish flu in
England and Wales)[15, 16]. A graph like that shown in
Figure 1 should reflect changes of social distancing over
time.
Reports of confirmed cases or mortalities possess
discontinuities in time derivatives. For instance, see
the red point in Figure 1 (we will also see similar
phenomena with COVID-19 data). Such transitions
may indicate noise in reported data, changes in testing
policy, responses to some extraneous phenomena, or a
combination of two temporarily and spatially separated
epidemy waves. On the other hand, one can put
forward a hypothesis that such transitions indicate
abrupt changes in social distancing practice as a response
to reduced levels of epidemy.

For example, consider a hypothesis that discontinuity
in time derivative of reported mortalities (as shown by
the red dot in Figure 1) is a consequence of an abrupt
change in social distancing. The population accepted
significant social distancing at the beginning of the wave
but increasingly rejected it after the pandemic passed its
peak. To estimate the time and strength of transition,
one needs an epidemiological model that includes human
behavior.
The SIR model[17] separates the population into three
compartments: susceptible, infected, and recovered. The
flux between these compartments goes in the order
susceptible → infected → recovered, since susceptible
people may become infected during encounters with
infected individuals.
Newly-infected people stay
contagious for some time, after which they stop spreading
the disease and become immune (recover) or die. The
population is well mixed and sustains the gas-like
interaction of its members.
This work follows many previous efforts to investigate
the role of human behavior during an epidemy[6, 13, 18–
22]. Parameters of SIR[17] can depend on disease
prevalence[6], be time dependent[23], include spatial
effects [24, 25], be more elaborated by the separation of
the susceptible and infected into sub-compartments[26],
include adaptive mobility[27], or include informationrelated contact patterns[28–30]. Specifically, we have
made modifications to the SIR model with economic
tools[3–5, 31–36] and game theory methods[37–39].
Policy[40] and pandemic management is out of the scope
of this work.
To proceed, one should associate social distancing with
a parameter of an epidemiological model. Following
many previous studies, we will choose basic reproduction
number R0 as a measure of both social distancing and its
economic cost[20, 39, 41–44].
Basic reproduction number R0 is the expected number
of infected directly generated by one infected person
in a population where all individuals are susceptible to
infection[45]. R0 is a measure of social distancing because
it is proportional to the frequency of interpersonal
interactions. The economic cost of social distancing,

F ES(sth , t) − F ES(sth , t) = EC(sth , t) − EC(sth , t).
(1)
Both F ES and EC are defined at time t when individuals
(or the government) make their decision. This time,
however, is a function of the subsequent sequence of
trajectories of individual decisions.
A major assumption of this work is that decisions
(0)
(1)
regarding transition sth → sth consider only two
(0)
(1)
possible future trajectories: either sth or sth and these
remain constant until the end of the epidemy. Otherwise,
F ES can not be considered entirely as a function of the
single value of sth .
The extension of (1) in the Taylor series of ∆sth results
in a non-linear expression similar to the free energy of a
system with Ginzburg-Landau instability.
This work proceeds with the presentation of the
SIR model with induced transitions (SIRIT), an almost
analytical treatment of this model, the calibration of the
epidemic and economy parameters of the model (using a
time series of confirmed cases and causalities during the
first wave of COVID-19 in Austria, Israel, and Germany),
followed by a discussion of the obtained results and their
implications.

DISCONTINUOUS TRANSITIONS IN THE
SIR MODEL WITH UTILITY FUNCTION

Here are SIR equations that describe the spread of an
epidemy in a population:
∂s
= −βis,
∂t
∂i
= βis − γi,
∂t

(2)

∂r
= γi
∂t
where s(t), i(t), and r(t) are the fractions of the
population in the susceptible, infected, and recovered
states respectively. The third equation is redundant since
s + i + r = 1. Rate β includes both the rate of interaction
between population members and the probability of

25

Deaths per 1000 persons

therefore, can be considered as a function of R0 [44].
Further ,in this work, for the sake of convenience, we
will use the inverse of the basic reproduction number
sth = 1/R0 as the main parameter: epidemy breaks out
only if R0 > 0, thus sth is bounded 0 < sth < 1.
(0)
In this work, changes in the value of sth = 1/R0 , sth →
(1)
sth correspond to the balance between changes in the
final epidemy size F ES (the number of new infections
from the current moment till the end of epidemy)[46, 47]
and changes in economic cost EC[44]:

FIG. 1. Mortality in England and Wales during the second
wave of Spanish flu. The red dot indicates a transition in time
derivative soon after the epidemy peak. This work presents
a theory that describes this type of transition as a rational
decision regarding the optimal value of social distancing in
a population. The theory predicts discontinuous, phase
transition-like, changes in social distancing. We do not claim
that this work provides the only possible explanation of the
discontinuous time derivatives of an epidemy’s dynamics.

disease transmission during these interactions.
An
infected person is contagious during γ −1 on average.
Both β and γ may represent changes in human
behavior that affect the spread of disease. The frequency
of social interactions and the level of self-protection define
β. During severe pandemics like COVID-19, human or
government decisions also affect γ by contact tracing
and self or government-imposed quarantine of individuals
who are known or suspected to be infected.
If rates β and γ are constant in time, eqs. (2) reduce

(3)

where t∗ = βt is dimensionless time and R0 = β/γ is
basic reproduction number, i.e. the expected number
of infections directly generated by one infected person
in a population where all individuals are susceptible to
infection[45]. In addition, R0 defines the threshold ratio
of susceptible sth that defines the course of the epidemy:
the number of infected increase if s > sth and decrease
if s < sth . We will use sth , rather than R0 , as the main
parameter in this work.
Equation (3) possesses a solution in (s, i) space, see
Figure 2 and Appendix A. The form of the trajectory

(st , it ) depends only on initial values sth and (s0 , i0 ).
The trajectory starts at (s0 , i0 ) and advances to (smin , 0).
The amount of infected people reaches its maximum

The trajectory with transition (dashed red) converges to smin
which is lower than smin of the original trajectory.

following (1), we introduce the utility function:

where the final epidemy size F ES is:

and economic cost is some unknown function EC(sth , t).
The utility function and its components F ES and EC
can be considered as functions of s rather than time t in
(s, i) space.
In this work, we consider only the relaxation of social
(0)
distancing. At each moment t the value of sth changes

if there exists sth < sth such that:
(1)

(0)

U (sth , t) − U (sth , t) > 0.

(2)

EC(sth + ∆sth , t) = EC(sth , t) − E (1) ∆sth + E (2) ∆sth .
(8)
The choice of the signs in ( (8)) assures that E (1) and
E (2) are positive for ∆sth < 0. We also assume that
parameters (E (1) and E (2) ):

Both F ES and EC are defined at the time t of transition.

To calculate sth let us expand U into a Taylor series.
Specifically, let us expand EC to the second order and
F ES to the third order of sth , because F ES prevents
large changes in sth (a return to the pre-pandemic level
of social distancing).
Economic cost is a general unknown function
EC(sth , t). We assume that at each time t it possesses a
Taylor expansion:

This results in a series of discontinuous transitions (red bars)

The time that it takes to pass all these infinite number of

F (1) , F (2) and F (3) depend on position along the

Coefficients F (1) , F (2) and F (3) can be derived as

analytical functions of st and sth . Following (3) and
(6), F ES at any time t is:
F ES = log smin − log st ,

(12)

Thus F (i) are derivatives of smin due to sth . smin can be
expressed using the Lambert W function[48–51]:

Derivatives of the Lambert W function can be calculated

thus at any time before transition one can change

First, no
transition occurs if ∆U < 0 for all ∆sth < 0. Second,

(1)
discontinuous change in sth → sth takes place if there
is single value ∆U (sth ) = 0 for all ∆sth < 0. Third,
sth changes continuously when derivatives of (14) vanish
near ∆sth = 0. To prevent transitions with ∆sth > 0
we assume that the economic cost of additional social
distancing is high and overrides the potential reduction
of F ES.
Discontinuous transition occurs when there exists a
single ∆sth < 0 root for ∆U = 0 (14). This condition
requires the determinant of quadratic function U/∆sth
(14) to vanish:
4F (3) (F (1) + E (1) ) = (F (2) − E (2) )2 .

(15)

This is the fourth-order polynomial of log st because F (1) ,
F (2) , and F (3) are polynomials of log st of the first,
second, and third degrees correspondingly, see Appendix
C.
Following (14), transition strength ∆sth is:
∆sth =

Then:

To calculate when transition takes place on a trajectory
(0)
(sth , s0 , i0 ) one should solve the 4th order polynomial
(15) for str and take the closest to 0 negative root. One
(1)
can use (16) to calculate new value sth and continue the
(1)
trajectory (sth , str , i(str )).
Previous results can be presented as two functions:

str = T1 (s0 , i0 , sth , E (1) , E (2) ),
sth = T2 (s0 , i0 , sth , E (1) , E (2) ).

T1 defines where transition takes place s=str while T2
(0)
(1)
defines the transition strength sth → sth .
Consider the single transition in Figure 2. This
trajectory consists of the points (st , it ), starts at (s0 , i0 )
and proceeds to lower values of s. At some moment
condition (15) alarms and a new value of sth appears.
For a single transition, one can consider an inverse
problem - to calculate E (1) and E (2) if the transition
position str and its strength ∆sth are known.

FIG. 4. Utility as a function of sth before, during, and
after transition takes place. A measure of social distancing
is 0 < sth < 1. Transition occurs between current value

(1)
(0)
(0)
(0)
U (sth ) > U (sth ) (U (sth ) = 0). Before transition U (sth )
is the highest value of the utility function (dashed-dotted
blue). Then there are two possibilities: discontinuous change
(1)
(0)
(1)
sth 6= sth (solid green line) or continuous change sth ≈
(0)
sth (dashed red line). Two cases (dotted lines) that make
possible the change of sth to many values do not exist because
either continuous or discontinuous transition occurred before.
This work considers only a reduction in the level of social
distancing, which corresponds to a reduction of sth . Utility
function is approximately a cubic function of ∆sth (solid
green). The transition predicted by the exact calculation
(solid blue) for this work predict insignificant changes in the
time and strength of the transition.

The trajectory (st , it ) may include multiple transitions.
Condition (15) may occur after the first transition
and so on. To calculate these transition one should
(k)
repeatedly apply (18) with change (sth , sk , ik ) →
(k+1)
(sth , sk+1 , ik+1 ).
Many transitions (18) result in a Zeno-like
phenomenon - the system makes an infinite number
of transitions in a finite amount of time, see Figure
5. Repeated application of T1 and T2 (18) results in
convergence of sth and str to some limit values (slim
th and
slim respectively). The time to reach slim
is
finite,
as
th
any time between the two values of s > smin , see (A3).
For s < slim
tr , the utility function preserves the
continuous transition state. At slim
th (18) predicts ∆sth =
0, see Figure 4. At the region of continuous transitions,
at each moment equation:
F (1) = −E (1)

(19)

defines sth , and (3) is solved numerically. Otherwise,
if sth remains constant the utility function would make
possible many values of sth with U (sth ) > 0, see Figure
4.
The single transition requires an assumption that the
economic cost is a function of the basic reproduction
number. For multiple transitions, we assume that
economic cost is the same for all transitions. To check

5
the validity of these and other assumption of the model
we proceed to fit the first wave of COVID-19.

FIT

The main purpose of this section is to show that the
model of discontinuous transitions of social distancing
(see section I) may fit the first COVID-19 wave data. Full
optimization of the COVID-19 data fit and its validation
is out of the scope of this work. To proceed we want to
make our model compatible with the COVID-19 data.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, there are daily
worldwide reports[52] of confirmed cases and deaths.
Confirmed cases are detected infections, which are a
fraction of the total number of infected people. The
ratio between confirmed and total coronavirus cases is
unknown and may vary from country to country or
even change in time due to changes in test policies.
Nevertheless, some countries may be similar to each
other[53].
For the sake of the fit, first, we should introduce new
parameters that represent unknowns of the data. Second,
we should consider dynamics in time-space rather than
(s, i) space.
Let us rewrite (2) as:

= −βAsI,

FIG. 5. Epidemy wave dynamics with social distancing
transitions. SIR predicts wave-like behavior of infected
individuals (dash-dotted blue) accompanied by a reduction
in the number of susceptible people (dotted blue). A utility
function causes changes in social distancing parameter sth
(solid green). Transition (red bars) occurs when there exists
(1)
(1)
a new value of sth such that the utility function U (sth ) > 0.
The forms of the utility function before and during transition
are shown in the subplots. A region of continuous transitions
follows a series of discontinuous ones. Changes in sth cause
time derivative discontinuities in the dynamics of the infected
and susceptible numbers. These are especially prominent in
the first transition (outermost left red bar) soon after the
epidemy’s peak. In time space population trajectory depends
on whether the change of sth = γ/β occured by the change of
γ (dashed-dotted blue) or β (dotted magenta). The difference
is insignificant for the purpose of this work.

(20)

∂D
= βsth N AIM
∂t
where s remains to be fraction of susceptible, I reported
confirmed cases and D is reported deaths due to the
epidemy. A0 is a ratio between actual and reported
confirmed cases and N is the population size. Thus D =
M N r, where M is infected fatality rate (IFR). When
population size N and A0 remain constant it is convenient
0
to unite them into a single parameter A = AN . Eqs.
(20) converge to (2) if A0 = 1, with the only difference
being that the third equation addresses deceased instead
of recovered. Parameter β and sth are the same as in (2).
To proceed with a fit we assume that only those
parameters that are related to human behavior can
change with time. Thus β and sth change with time,
while A0 , N and M remain constant (these parameters
relate to testing policies and disease clinics.). This
choice fits our purpose to show that COVID-19 data
can be explained by changes in social distancing. In
reality, however, all parameters of the SIR model may be
continuous functions of time or the state of the epidemy.
The implications of this assumption are addressed in the
discussion section IV.
See Figure 5 for trajectory in time, corresponding to
trajectory in (s, i) space in Figure 3. The trajectory in

time space depends on β and sth , rather than only sth .
(k)
(k+1)
Thus transition sth → sth
may be interpreted as a
change in β, in γ or in both β and γ. Choosing every
transition as a change in γ (dash-dotted blue) or change
in β (dotted magenta) results in similar trajectories,
with differences that are below resolution of this work.
It is true that if the first transition occurs soon after
the maximum number of infected is reached - other
conditions may cause greater differences between β and
γ fits.
The fit proceeds in the following steps: first, a small
region around the greatest number of infected, see Figure
6, is used to calibrate s0 , I0 , β, A. The initial value
(0)
sth = γ/β. During the first fit, γ = 0.26 is constant.
This choice can be quite arbitrary in the boundaries of
reported COVID-19 1/7 < γ [day −1 ] < 1 values[54]. We
remind you that it also can be affected by contact tracing
and isolation policies.
Second, one detects a discontinuous change in the time
derivative of reported confirmed cases, see the outermost
left red bar in Figure 6. It defines t and str of the
first transition. New values of β and γ were fitted for
a confirmed case during the period of about 20 days
after the transition. In all cases, the fit predicted β
to remained unchanged while γ becomes a new value.
(0)
(1)
Thus sth becomes sth . Third, eq. (18) is solved for

FIG. 6. Fit of Austria COVID-19 first wave with multiple social distancing transitions. The purpose of the fit is to show that
there is a possibility to fit the real data using many transitions. A) Confirmed cases - reported (dashed green) and calculated
with many transitions (solid blue). Before transitions (red bars) classical SIR fits well with the reported confirmed cases. There
is a significant deviation of SIR from reported cases after the first transition (dashed blue). The SIRIT model with many
transitions fits well with the entire range of the first wave, though the fit was obtained using a small range around the peak of
confirmed cases and characteristics of the first transition (horizontal error bars). B) Susceptible and social distance parameter
sth . At each transition sth changes its value. A series of discontinuous transitions is followed by a continuous change region.
C) Coronavirus deaths. There exists a time delay between reported and calculated deaths. This delay can be explained by the
long course of COVID-19.

using (19).
To fit casualties, an effective population size N is
chosen to fit reported coronavirus deaths on the 100th
day of the first wave. It predicted a quite small N less
than 1/10 of the Austrian population. IFR is an average
probability of an infected person to die (for instance,
reported COVID-19 IFR in Germany M ≈ 0.37%[55]).
This result will be addressed during the discussion below.
Besides, there exists some time shift between calculated
and reported coronavirus deaths.

Two alternative fits of Austrian COVID-19 data are
shown in Figure 7. The first demonstrates the sensitivity
of the fit to the choice of the first transition. The second
demonstrates that for any first transition the entire curve
can be fitted if E (1) , E (2) are fitted separately.
The results for Germany and Israel are summarized in
Figures 8 and 9 together with Table I, which summarizes
the results for all three countries.
All countries
demonstrated a low size of the effective population. One
of the assumptions was that s0 ≈ 1. In the case of Israel,
it was required to be constrained during the fit. Neither
of the deviations from the fit refutes the main results of
this work.

Analysis of the first wave predicts a small, less than
1/10, effective population size in all three countries
studied, see Table I. An estimate of effective population
size depends on the choice of M - infected fatality rate
(IFR). Increase/reduction in M causes a proportional
reduction/increase in effective population size N and
predicted ration A0 between reported and real numbers
of infected. These values in Table I correspond to M =
0.1%. The reported value of M for Germany is 0.37%[55].
Thus N and A0 maybe about ×4 lower than in Table I.
Nevertheless M as low as 0.17% were reported[56]. All
other predictions or results of this work, including the
graphs, are independent of M . Mortality rate M > 0.3%
causes non-physical A0 < 1 in the case of Israel.

E (1) , E (2) were fitted by the first transition.
In
the second, economic weights were fitted for every
candidate transition (deviation from SIR model). Both
these scenarios include discontinuous changes in social
distancing and possess the same first transition.

The first waves of COVID-19 in Austria, Germany,
and Israel were fitted using SIRIT in two different
ways. The first was a series of discontinuous transitions

DISCUSSION

This work describes Ginzburg-Landau-like instability
in the SIR epidemiological model extended with timedependent human behavior. The utility function models
rational decision making regarding the optimal level of
social distancing. First, we describe the discontinuous
dynamics of this model. Second, we try to show
that reported infections or deaths during the COVID-

7
19 pandemic may include the evidence of a predicted
discontinuous transition. The first task allows rigorous
treatment. The second task requires many assumptions
that we will discuss shortly.
Let us start with a discussion of the choice of the utility
function and the corresponding decision-making process.
The utility function consists of two parts - the cost of the
epidemy and the economic cost of social distancing.
Following several previous works, we take final epidemy
size F ES as the main cost of the epidemy. F ES
according to the SIR model in (s, i) space, in addition
to the current state of the epidemy (st , it ), depend on
the single parameter - basic reproduction number R0 .
The price of pandemics, however, can go beyond the
final epidemy size F ES. For instance, one may include
time derivatives of the number of infected people as
a psychological factor that affects individual decision
making. There is a lot of room to make the utility
function more complicated, but this work demonstrates
that discontinuous dynamics may be achieved even with
a basic model.
The economic cost is assumed to be a function of sth =
1/R0 . Basic reproduction number 1/sth = R0 also serve
as a social distancing parameter. This choice does not
change the major predictions or analytical developments
of this work. In our opinion, the parameter 0 < sth < 1
that can be compared with the fraction of susceptible
people in a population serves better the purpose of this
work.
The main purpose of a utility function is to represent
decision making. This work assumes that decision
(k)
(k+1)
making considers every transition sth → sth
as a
(k+1)
single one, suggesting that the new value sth
preserves
till the end of epidemy. This is a major assumption of this
work because elaborate decision making should consider
(k+1)
future possible changes in sth .
The specific choice of the utility function makes the
possible rigorous treatment of a single transition of
social distancing. Multiple transitions require additional
assumptions around economic costs which change from
A small effective population size during the first wave
is another surprising result of the fit. An explanation of
low N may be that the initial lockdown separated the
population in disconnected domains[58, 59] and the wave
of the epidemy occurred in a limited number of domains.
The other possible explanation is that a significant part
of the population is immune to COVID-19[60]. Finally,
the SIR approach may be an oversimplified presentation
of reality.
The small effective population size during the first
wave may indicate a danger of an abrupt transition to
a bigger population size when sth reduces below some
critical value. It may result in a significant second wave
of the epidemy. It depends on the network structure of
the population.
SIR dynamics can be mapped on percolation in an

transition to transition. Economic cost is assumed to be
constant with time during the fit of COVID-19 data.
The ratio between total and confirmed infected A0 ,
population size N , and infected fatality rate (IFR) M
is assumed to be constant during the first wave of
COVID-19. It is a very strong assumption, especially
regarding ratio A0 , which depends on the amount of the
tests. Nevertheless, one can hope that A0 preserves for
some time while test policies are the same. Especially
important for this work is the time from the maximum
number of infected till the first predicted transition, see
Figure 6.
All these assumptions provided a successful fit of
COVID-19 data in Austria, Germany, and Israel. Austria
and Israel are countries with similar population sizes
and with similar policies during the initial stages of the
first wave. Germany is a country with a population
about ×10 the size of the other two countries, which still
demonstrated SIR-like behavior during the first wave.
All three countries studied entered a transition soon
after the epidemy started to decline. During the fit,
this work can not distinguish between the transition of
social distancing sth and changes in parameters that
were assumed to be constant, for instance, A0 . Thus
,transition in social distancing remains a hypothesis.
An interesting conclusion of the fit is that the first
(0)
transition of social distancing sth → s1th corresponds
to the change of γ rather than β. β remains constant
during the first transition of sth = γ/β. Generally,
human behavior is associated with changes in β that are
directly connected to the frequency of interactions and
behavior during such interactions. Nevertheless, during
extreme events such as COVID-19, the contagious period
γ −1 can be shortened due to contact tracing and the
isolation of the confirmed or possibly infected. Some
studies highlight the importance of γ changes[57]. It
is important to state that the general theory of social
distancing transitions in section II is not affected by this
finding.
Erdos-Renyi network[61]. F ES corresponds to a giant
component in percolation models. The critical value
of the basic reproduction number for a percolation
transition was reported for some interaction networks[59,
62–64], though scale-free networks lack it[58]. Future
work may extend these tools to calculate the derivatives
of F ES (11) to the general derivatives of giant
components in percolation models.
Network theory may help to set the validity boundaries
of this work. For instance, the predictions of this work
may become invalid if the parameter of social distancing
is a function f (R0 ) such that F ES as a function of f
ceases to be non-linear. An example of such a function
is the transmission T = 1 − exp(−1/sth ) in a scale-free
network[64].
There are alternative explanations to discontinuities

FIG. 7. Alternative fits of Austria COVID-19 first wave A) fit with a different date for the first transition. There is a significant
deviation between reported and calculated confirmed cases. This demonstrates that the fit techniques are sensitive to the
choice of the first transition. This sensitivity provides a hope that the fit may reveal something about the real parameters of
the population or economy of the state. B) fit with two different distance transitions. By adjusting utility function weights
E (1) , E (2) separately for every transition a better fit can be achieved. In the case of Austria, only two transitions are required.
This method is less sensitive to the choice of the first transition.

discontinuous transitions of social distancing and
provides tools for quantitative analysis of pandemic
waves.
The dynamics include the Zeno-like effect
of infinite transitions during a finite time. Multiple
transitions may be interesting for theories of crisis
formation - the probability that something goes wrong
increases with the number of decision points. The
developed tools contributing to social epidemiology,
like the SIR model, may be mapped to network
percolation theory and to the spread of non-contagious
but going-viral phenomena[67, 68].

in observed COVID-19 data, for instance, government
regulations[65] or continuous exogenous phenomena[66].
Relative weights of government regulations and
individual decision making regarding social distancing
can not be addressed in the framework of this work.
Nevertheless, testing the basic decision-making model
against real data is important. The evolution of decision
making could converge to some basic model which is
different from complex modern reality.

TABLE I. Parameters of SIRIT model that fit the first COVID-19 wave of Austria, Germany, and Israel. The parameters
may be used to reproduce the figures of the article. For definition of parameters see eqs. (2), (3) and (20). Besides, D1 and
D2 are the days of the first and the second (if required) transitions. E (1) , E (2) are the weights of the utility function which
were fitted for the first transition. An interesting result is a small effective population size N , less than 1/10 of the state
population. Greater values of mortality rate M (factor k) predict even lower values of population size N (increase in M
causes a proportional reduction in effective population size N and A0 ratio between the real and reported number of infected).
Mortality rate M > 0.3% (k > 3) causes non-physical A0 < 1 in the case of Israel. The second transition in the case of Germany
and Israel brings a change in β. The results of all three countries are quite similar except A0 - ratio between the real and
reported number of infected people.
