Abstract
In the absence of neither an effective treatment or vaccine and with an incomplete understanding of the epidemiological cycle, Govt. has implemented a nationwide lockdown
to reduce COVID-19 transmission in India. To study the effect of social distancing measure, we considered a new mathematical model on COVID-19 that incorporates lockdown
effect. By validating our model to the data on notified cases from five different states
and overall India, we estimated several epidemiologically important parameters as well
as the basic reproduction number (R0 ). Combining the mechanistic mathematical model
with different statistical forecast models, we projected notified cases in the six locations
for the period May 17, 2020, till May 31, 2020. A global sensitivity analysis is carried
out to determine the correlation of two epidemiologically measurable parameters on the
lockdown effect and also on R0 . Our result suggests that lockdown will be effective in
those locations where a higher percentage of symptomatic infection exists in the population. Furthermore, a large scale COVID-19 mass testing is required to reduce community
infection. Ensemble model forecast suggested a high rise in the COVID-19 notified cases
in most of the locations in the coming days. Furthermore, the trend of the effective reproduction number (Rt ) during the projection period indicates if the lockdown measures
are completely removed after May 17, 2020, a high spike in notified cases may be seen in
those locations. Finally, combining our results, we provided an effective lockdown policy
to reduce future COVID-19 transmission in India.

1. Introduction
As of May 15, 2020, 4593395 cases and 306376 deaths from 2019 novel coronavirus
disease (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2), were recorded worldwide [1]. Coronaviruses are enveloped non-segmented positivesense RNA viruses that belongto the Coronaviridae family and the order Nidovirales, and
are widely distributed among humans and other mammals [2]. The novel coronavirus,
COVID-19 started in mainland China, with a geographical emphasis at Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei province [3] and has widely spread all over the world. Many of the initial
cases were usually introduced to the wholesale Huanan seafood market, which also traded
live animals. Clinical trials of hospitalized patients found that patients exhibit symptoms
consistent with viral pneumonia at the onset of COVID-19, most commonly fever, cough,
sore throat and fatigue [4]. Some patients reported changes in their ground-glass lungs;
normal or lower than average white lymphocyte blood cell counts and platelet counts;
hypoxemia; and deranged liver and kidney function. Most were said to be geographically
related to the wholesale market of Huanan seafood [5]. Severe outbreaks occur in USA
(1457593 cases), Spain (272646 cases), Russia (262843 cases), UK (236711 cases), Italy
(223885) and so many countries and the disease continues to spread globally. This has
been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. It is the third zoonotic
human coronavirus that has arisen in the present century, after the 2002 severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which spread to 37 countries and the
2012 Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which spread to 27
countries.
The 2019 pandemic novel coronavirus was first confirmed in India on January 30, 2020,
in the state of Kerala. A total of 82087 confirmed cases and 2648 deaths in the country
have been reported as of May 15, 2020 [6]. The Indian government has introduced social
distance as a precaution to avoid the possibility of a large-scale population movement
that can accelerate the spread of the disease. India government implemented a 14-hour
voluntary public curfew on 22 March 2020. Furthermore, the Prime Minister of India
also ordered a nationwide lockdown at midnight on March 24, 2020 to slow the spread
of COVID-19. Despite no vaccine, social distancing has identified as the most commonly
used prevention and control strategy [7]. The purpose of these initiatives is the restriction
of social interaction in workplaces, schools, and other public spheres, except for essential
public services such as fire, police, hospitals. No doubt the spread of this virus outbreak
has seriously disrupted the life, economy and health of citizens. This is a great concern
for everyone how long this scenario will last and when the disease will be controlled.
Mathematical modeling based on system of differential equations may provide a comprehensive mechanism for the dynamics of a disease transmission [8]. Several modeling
studies have already been performed for the COVID-19 outbreak [9; 10; 11; 12; 13]. Based
2

on data collected from December 31, 2019 till January 28, 2020, Wu et al [13] developed
a susceptible exposed infectious recovered model (SEIR) to clarify the transmission dynamics and projected national and global spread of disease. They also calculated around
2.68 is the basic reproductive number for COVID-19. Tang et al [12] proposed a compartmental deterministic model that would combine the clinical development of the disease,
the epidemiological status of the patient and the measures for intervention. Researchers
found that the amount of control reproduction number may be as high as 6.47, and
that methods of intervention including intensive touch tracing followed by quarantine
and isolation would effectively minimize COVID cases [12]. For the basic reproductive
number, Read et al. reported a value of 3.1 based on the data fitting of an SEIR model,
using an assumption of Poisson-distributed daily time increments [14]. A report by Cambridge University has indicated that India’s countrywide three-week lockdown would not
be adequate to prevent a resurgence of the new coronavirus epidemic that could bounce
back in months and cause thousands of infections [15]. They suggested that two or three
lockdowns can extend the slowdown longer with five-day breaks in between or a single
49-day lockdown. Data-driven mathematical modeling plays a key role in disease prevention, planning for future outbreaks and determining the effectiveness of control. Several
data-driven modeling experiments have been performed in various regions [12; 16]. Currently, there are very limited works that studied the impact of lockdown on COVID-19
transmission dynamics in India.
In the present manuscript, we proposed a new mathematical model for COVID-19
that incorporates the lockdown effect. We also considered variability in transmission
between symptomatic and asymptomatic populations with former being a fast spreader
of the disease. Analyzing COVID-19 daily notified cases from five affected states (Maharashtra, Delhi, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat and Punjab) and from overall India, we studied the
effect of social distancing measures implemented by the Govt. on notified cases reduction
in those regions. We also estimates the basic reproduction numbers (R0 ) for these six
locations. Using a post-processing BMA technique, we ensemble our COVID-19 mathematical model with different statistical forecast model to obtain a projection of notified
cases in those six locations for the period May 17, 2020 till May 31, 2020. A global
sensitivity analysis is carried out to determine the correlation of two epidemiologically
measurable parameters on lockdown effect and also on R0 . Finally to determine the
COVID-19 transmission trend during the projection period (May 17, 2020 till May 31,
2020), we estimate the effective reproduction number (Rt ) for the mentioned six locations.
2. Method
Based on the development and epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19, a SEIR
type model is more appropriate to study the dynamics of this current pandemic [17;
3

18; 8]. The model we developed in this paper is based on the interaction of seven
mutually exclusive sub-classes namely, Susceptible (S), Lockdown (L), Exposed (E),
Asymptomatic (A), Symptomatic (I), Hospitalized (C), and Recovered (R).
Susceptible population (S) increased due to constant recruitment rate ΠH and those
1
individuals coming back from lockdown compartment after the lockdown period . Popuω
lation in the susceptible class decreased due to new infection in contact with symptomatic
and asymptomatic infected population, natural death and also a fraction of the susceptible individuals become home-quarantine due to lockdown at a rate l. We also assumed
variability in disease transmission in asymptomatic and symptomatic population with
later being a fast spreader of infection with a variability factor (0 ≤ ρ ≤ 1) [19; 20].
Lockdown population (L) increased by those susceptible who are home-quarantined
1
during the lockdown period , at a rate l. Population under lockdown is decreased due
ω
to natural death and those individuals who become susceptible again after the lockdown
1
period . For simplicity, we assume ideal lockdown scenario i.e. all population under
ω
lockdown maintained proper social distancing and do not contribute to new infection.
Population in the exposed compartment (E) increased by new infection coming from
susceptible compartment. A fraction κ of the exposed individuals become symptomatic
infected and remaining fraction (1 − κ) become asymptomatic infected after the disease
incubation period σ1 . Exposed population also decreased due to natural death at a rate
µ.
Asymptomatic infected compartment (A) increased due to a fraction (1 − κ) of infection coming from exposed compartment. Since, asymptomatic COVID-19 cases are hard
to detect therefore, we assume that asymptomatic infection are not notified. Population
in this compartment is decreased due to natural recovery and deaths at a rate γ1 and µ,
respectively.
Population in the symptomatic infected compartment (I) increased due to a fraction
κ of infection coming from exposed compartment after the incubation period σ1 . This
compartment decreased due to natural recovery at a rate γ2 , natural death at a rate µ
and those infected population who are notified & hospitalized at a rate τ .
Notified & hospitalized infected population (C) increased due to influx of infection
coming from symptomatic infected class at a rate τ . This population decreased due to
natural death at a rate µ, disease related deaths at a rate δ, and recovery from COVID-19
at a rate γ3 . We assume that population of this compartment do not mix with the general
population in the community i.e. this compartment do not contribute in the COVID-19
transmission.
Finally, recovered population (R) increased due to influx of individuals coming from
asymptomatic (A), symptomatic (I), and notified & hospitalized individuals (C) at a

4

rate γ1 , γ2 , and γ3 , respectively. As we are analyzing this study in a shorter time frame
therefore, we assume definitive immunity i.e. recovered population do not contribute to
new COVID-19 infection. Thus recovered population decreased due to natural death at
a rate µ.

transmission with and without lockdown are provided below:

Mathematical properties of the model
We studied the positivity and boundedness of solution of the model (2.1) (see supplementary appendix). The system (2.1) demonstrates two equilibria, that is, the diseasefree equlibrium and an unique endemic equilibrium (see supplementary appendix). The
disease-free state is locally asymptotically stable whenever the corresponding basic reproduction number (R0 ) is less than unity (see supplementary appendix). By using a
nonlinear Lyapunov function, it is also seen that the disease-free equilibrium is globally
asymptotically stable whenever R0 < 1 (see supplementary appendix). In addition, the
model (2.1) has an unique endemic equilibrium if R0 exceeds unity. Furthermore, using
the central manifold theory, the local stability of the endemic equilibrium is established
whenever R0 > 1 (see supplementary appendix).
Data
Daily COVID-19 reported cases from Maharashtra (MH), Delhi (DL), Tamil Nadu
(TN), Gujarat (GJ), Punjab (PJ) and whole India (IND) for the time period March 14,
2020 till May 3, 2020 are considered for our study. These five states are deeply affected by
current COVID-19 outbreak in India [6]. Daily COVID-19 notified cases were collected
from [6]. Demographic data of the different locations are taken from [21; 22].
Estimation procedure
Several important epidemiological parameters (see Table 1) of our mathematical
model (2.2) are estimated using COVID-19 daily reported cases from the mentioned
six locations. Total time duration of lockdown implemented by Govt. is 54 days starting from March 25, 2020 till May 17, 2020. Time-series data of daily COVID-19 cases
in our study for the locations MH, DL, TN, GJ, PJ, and IND, respectively contains
both with and without lockdown effect. Therefore, a combination of our mathematical
models (2.1)& (2.2) (with and without lockdown) are used for calibration. From our models (2.1)& (2.2), new COVID-19 notified cases during the ith time interval [ti , ti + ∆ti ]
is

Hi (θ̂) = τ

I(ξ, θ̂) dξ,

(2.3)

where, ∆ti is the time step length and θ̂ is the set of unknown parameters of the models (2.1)& (2.2) that are estimated. Then K observation from the data and from the
models (2.1)& (2.2) are {D1 , D2 , ..., DK } and {H1 (θ̂), H2 (θ̂), ...., HK (θ̂)}, respectively.
Therefore, we constructed the sum of squares function [23] as:

SS(θ̂) =
Di − Hi (θ̂) ,

(2.4)

MATLAB based nonlinear least square solver f mincon is used to fit simulated and
observed daily COVID-19 notified cases for the mentioned states and the whole country.
Delayed Rejection Adaptive Metropolis [24] (DRAM) algorithm is used to sample the
95% confidence region. An elaboration of this model fitting technique is provided in [25].
Statistical forecast models and the ensemble model
COVID-19 mathematical model we developed in this study may be efficient in capturing the transmission dynamics. However, as solution of the mathematical model is always
smooth therefore, our model may not be able to replicate the fluctuations occurring in
daily time-series data. Moreover, forecast of future COVID-19 cases based on a single
mathematical model may not be very reliable approach. For this purpose, we used two
statistical forecast models namely, Auto-regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA);
and ARMA errors, Trend and Seasonal components (TBATS) respectively. A Hybrid statistical model (HYBRID) based on the combination of ARIMA and TBATS is also used
during forecast. Calibration of three statistical forecast models (ARIMA, TBATS and
HYBRID) using COVID-19 daily notified cases from MH, DL, TN, GJ, PJ, and IND,
respectively during March 14, 2020 till May 3, 2020, are done using the R package ’forecastHybrid’ [26]. Each individuals models (ARIMA and TBATS) are first fitted to the
aforesaid time-series data and then we combined each models with weightage based on in
sample error to obtain the HYBRID model [26]. Prediction skill of the each three statistical forecast model (ARIMA, TBATS and HYBRID) are tested on the daily COVID-19
notified cases during May 4, 2020 till May 8, 2020 for each of the six locations (see supplementary Table S2). Based on the prediction skill (see supplementary Table S2), the
best statistical forecast model is ensemble with our COVID-19 mathematical models (2.1)
and (2.2). A post-processing BMA technique based on ’DRAM’ algorithm [24] is used to
determine the weightage (see supplementary Table S3 and Fig S6 to Fig S11) to combine
the best statistical model with the COVID-19 mathematical models (2.1) and (2.2).
Disease forecasting under different lockdown scenario
Govt. have implemented lockdown all over India on March 25, 2020 and it will
continue till May 17, 2020. The short and medium scale industries are largely affected
by the lockdown [27; 28]. To partially recover the economy, Govt. of India continuously
relaxing the lockdown rules from April 20, 2020 [29; 30; 31]. To forecast COVID-19 cases
for the period May 17, 2020 till May 31, 2020, for the six locations (MH, DL, TN, GJ,
PJ and IND) based on the Govt. strategy, we considered following scenarios:
Forecast based on current lockdown rate: We have estimated the average lockdown
rate for our COVID-19 mathematical model (see Table 1 and Table 2). Using this
lockdown rate and using other parameters (estimated and known) of our mathematical
models (2.1) & (2.2), we forecast COVID-19 notified cases during May 17, 2020 till May
7

31, 2020 for the locations MH, DL, TN, GJ, PJ, and IND, respectively. Finally, forecast
based on our mathematical model is ensemble with the result based on the best statistical
forecast model for a location mentioned earlier.
Forecast based on 15% reduction in current lockdown rate: We followed same procedure as the previous scenario with 15% decrement in the estimate of lockdown rate (see
Table 1 and Table 2) to obtained the forecast during the mentioned time period.
Forecast based on 20% reduction in current lockdown rate: we followed the same
procedure as previous two scenarios with 20% decrement in the estimate of lockdown rate
(see Table 1 and Table 2) to obtained the forecast during the mentioned time period.
Forecast based on 30% reduction in current lockdown rate: we followed the same
procedure as previous three scenarios with 30% decrement in the estimate of lockdown
rate (see Table 1 and Table 2) to obtain the forecast during the mentioned time period.
Forecast based on no lockdown: Continue as earlier and assuming lockdown is lifted
after May 17, 2020, we forecast COVID-19 notified cases during May 17, 2020 till May
31, 2020, for the six mentioned locations.
Estimation of the basic and the effective reproduction number
Since we assumed that population under the lockdown do not contact with the infection from the community therefore the basic reproduction number (R0 ) [32] for our
mathematical model with and without lockdown (see Fig 1 and supplementary method)
are same and its expression is provided below:

R0 =

β1 κσ
ρβ1 (1 − κ)σ
+
.
(µ + σ)(γ2 + τ + µ) (µ + σ)(γ1 + µ)

The effective reproductive number (Rt ) is defined as the expected number of secondary
infection per infectious in a population made up of both susceptible and non-susceptible
hosts [33]. If Rt > 1, the number of new cases will increase, for Rt = 1, the disease
become endemic, and when Rt < 1 there will be a decline in new cases.
Following [33], the expression of Rt is given as follows:
Rt = R0 × ŝ,
where, ŝ is the fraction of the host population that is susceptible.
R0 can easily be estimated by plugin the sample values of the unknown parameters
(see Table 2) of the model without lockdown (2.1) in the expressions of R0 .
Following procedure is adapted to estimate Rt during May 17, 2020 till May 31, 2020
under two lockdown scenarios:
8

• Using current estimate of the lockdown rate and different parameters of our mathematical model (see Table 1 and Table 2), we estimate ŝ and Rt during May 17, 2020
till May 31, 2020, for the locations MH, DL, TN, GJ, PJ and IND, respectively.
• Using different parameters (see Table 1 and Table 2) of our mathematical model without lockdown (2.1), we estimated ŝ and Rt during May 17, 2020 till May 31, 2020
for the mentioned six locations.
Sensitivity analysis and effective lockdown strategy
To determine an effective lockdown policy in those six locations (MH, DL, TN, GJ, PJ
and IND) will require some correlation between lockdown effect with some epidemiologically measurable parameters of our mathematical model (see Fig 1). There are several
important parameters of our mathematical model (see Table 1) and among them there
are two parameters that are measurable namely, κ: fraction of new infected that become
symptomatic (COVID-19 testing will provide an accurate estimate) and τ : Average notification & hospitalization rate of symptomatic COVID-19 infection (this parameter is
proportional to the number of COVID-19 testing). Lockdown effect is measured as the
difference between the total number of cases projected by our ensemble model with and
without lockdown. A global sensitivity analysis [34] is performed to determine the effect
of the mentioned two parameters on the lockdown effect and on the basic reproduction
number (R0 ). Using Latin Hyper cube sampling (LHS), we draw 1000 samples for κ and
τ , respectively from their respective ranges (see Table 1). Partial rank correlation and
its corresponding p-value are examined to determine the relation between two mentioned
parameters with the lockdown effect and R0 , respectively.
3. Results and discussion
Three models (mathematical, statistical forecast and ensemble) fitting to daily COVID19 notified cases during March 14, 2020 till May 3, 2020, for Maharashtra (MH), Delhi
(DL), Tamil Nadu (TN), Gujarat (GJ), Punjab (PJ), and India (IND) is depicted in
Fig 2. Among the three statistical forecast models (ARIMA, TBATS and HYBRID), the
ARIMA model performed better on the test prediction data (May 4, 2020 till May 8,
2020) of DL and GJ (see supplementary Table S2). Whereas, the TBATS model provide
better result in compare to other two models for the test prediction data (May 4, 2020
till May 8, 2020) of PJ (see supplementary Table S2). For the remaining three locations
(MH, TN and IND), the HYBRID model provide the best result (see supplementary Table S2) on the test prediction data (May 4, 2020 till May 8, 2020). The ensemble model,
which is a combination of our COVID-19 mathematical models (2.1) & (2.2) and the best
statistical forecast model (region specific), is performed well in capturing COVID-19 daily
time-series data trend in all the six locations. Posterior distribution of the weights at
9

which we combine our COVID-19 mathematical model with the best statistical forecast
model in the six different locations are provided in supplementary method (see Fig S6 to
Fig S11 and Table S3).
In MH, DL, and GJ, the estimate of the symptomatic influx fraction (κ) suggest
that low percentage (about 11% to 20%) of symptomatic infected in the population (see
Table 2). However, in TN and PJ, relatively higher percentage (about 82% to 88%) of
symptomatic infection is found (see Table 2). In overall India, our estimate shows that
currently about 62% of new infection are symptomatic (see Table 2). Except for GJ, in
other five locations, estimate of the transmission rate (β1 ) are found to be in same scale
(see Table 2). Relatively higher value of β1 is found in Gujrat (see Table 2). Low value
of the transmission variability factor (ρ) indicates most of the community infection in
GJ are due to contact with the symptomatic infected population. As in GJ, the value of
κ is found to be small (about 11%) therefore, relatively smaller symptomatic population
producing most of the infection in GJ. This indicate that there may be a possibility of
existence of super-spreaders among the symptomatic infected in GJ. This observation
is agree with a recent survey result in GJ [35]. Except for PJ, in other five locations,
the estimates of ρ (below 50%) are found to be low (see Table 2). This indicates small
contribution of the asymptomatic infected population towards the new infection produced
in MH, DL, TN, GJ and IND, respectively. Estimate of the lockdown rate in the five
states (MH, DL, TN, GJ and PJ) suggest that around 50% to 88% of the total susceptible
population are successfully home quarantined during the lockdown period (see Table 2).
Thus, lockdown is overall successful in those five states. However, this is not the case for
overall India, our estimate suggest that about 11% of the total susceptible population in
India maintained proper social distancing during the lockdown period (see Table 2).
Our estimate of the basic reproduction number (R0 ) (see Table 3), in the six locations
found to be in good agreement of the world-wide estimate provided by WHO [36]. We
performed a global sensitivity analysis of two epidemiologically measurable parameters
of our mathematical model (see Fig 1) namely κ: fraction of new infected that become
symptomatic and τ : Average notification & hospitalization rate of symptomatic COVID19 infection, on R0 . Partial rank correlation and its corresponding p-value (see Fig 3)
suggest that τ has a negative correlation on R0 . Thus, more testing will isolate more
infection from the community and therefore may reduce the COVID-19 community transmission. Furthermore, high positive correlation of κ with R0 (see Fig 3) indicates the
possibility of high COVID-19 transmission in those areas where population have higher
percentage of symptomatic infection.
Ensemble model forecast of notified COVID-19 cases between May 17, 2020 till May
31, 2020 (see Table 4, Fig. 4, and Fig S1 to Fig S10 in supplementary appendix) indicate
that in the coming few days, a high increment in the COVID-19 notified cases may be

10

observed in MH, DL, TN, GJ, PJ, and IND. Furthermore, our ensemble model prediction
during the mentioned period suggest that around 117645 to 128379 cases may occurred
in overall India (see Table 4). These numbers are much higher than the total cumulative
cases between March 2, 2020 till May 15, 2020, in whole India.
A global sensitivity analysis of κ and τ on the lockdown effect suggest that both of
these parameters have high positive correlation with the lockdown effect in all the six
locations (see Fig. 5). Therefore, lockdown will be effective in those region where higher
percentage of symptomatic infection is found in the population and also larger COVID-19
mass testing will be required to isolate the cases.
To measure the COVID-19 transmission trend during May 17, 2020 till May 31, 2020,
we estimated the effective reproduction number (Rt ) during the mentioned period for
MH, DL, TN, GJ, PJ and IND, respectively (see Fig. 6). Our result suggest that, a
decreasing trend in new notified COVID-19 cases (Rt < 1) may be seen after May 31,
2020 if current lockdown measures (see Table 2) are maintained in DL, TN and PJ,
respectively. Furthermore, if social distancing measures are removed after May 17, 2020,
we may see a rise in the daily COVID-19 cases in all of the six locations (see Fig. 6).
4. Conclusion
Up to May 15, 2020, total number of reported COVID-19 cases and deaths in India
are 81794 and 2649, respectively [6]. This tally rises with few thousand new notified
cases every day reported from different locations in India [6]. Currently, there is no
treatment or vaccine available for COVID-19. Therefore, only measure to control the
outbreak may be home quarantined (lockdown) a larger percentage of susceptible population. However, this disease control strategy may have some negative impact on the
economy. Therefore, it is utmost important to determine an effective lockdown policy
that may reduce COVID-19 transmission in the community as well as save the Indian
economy from drowning. This policy may be found by studying the dynamics and prediction of a mechanistic mathematical model for COVID-19 transmission and testing the
results in real life situation.
In this present study, we consider a new mathematical model on COVID-19 transmission that incorporates the lockdown effect (see Fig 1). In our models (2.1) & (2.2), we
also considered transmission variability between symptomatic and asymptomatic population with former being a fast spreader of the disease. Using daily time-series data of
notified COVID-19 cases from five states (Maharashtra, Delhi, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat and
Punjab) and overall India, we studied the effect of lockdown measures on the reduction
of notified cases in those regions. Our result suggest that lockdown will be effective in
those locations where higher percentage of symptomatic infection exist in the population. Furthermore, a large scale COVID-19 mass testing is required to reduce community
11

infection in those locations. Using a post-processing BMA technique, we ensemble the
prediction of our mathematical model with the results obtained from different statistical
forecast model. Our ensemble model forecast of COVID-19 daily notified cases during
May 17, 2020 till May 31, 2020, suggested a very high rise in the COVID-19 notified
cases in the mentioned time duration in most of the locations. Furthermore, estimation
of the effective reproduction number (Rt ) during the mentioned time duration indicates
if the lockdown measures are completely removed after May 17, 2020, in those locations,
a high spike in COVID-19 notified cases may be seen during the mentioned forecasting
period. We provide a suggestion for the Indian Govt. and policy makers to acquire the
following steps for effective containment of COVID-19 transmission:
1. Perform a survey to find the percentage of symptomatic infection in different states
and regions.
2. Focus implementing extensive lockdown in those locations only where the percentage of symptomatic infection is high.
3. Provide relaxation in lockdown in other locations for some time. This process will
increase the percentage of symptomatic infection.
4. Repeat step-2, when a region has a sufficient percentage of symptomatic infection.
There are some drawback in our study and may be modified in future. We assume
that lockdown population (L) and notified & hospitalized infection (C) do not mix with
the general population in the community. However, there are numerous evidences where
disease transmitted from the hospital and from home confined individuals [37]. We shall
leave these challenges for our future objectives.

5. Supplementary Appendix
Positivity and boundedness of the solution for the Model (2.2)
This subsection is provided to prove the positivity and boundedness of solutions of
the system (2.2) with initial conditions (S(0), L(0), E(0), A(0), I(0), C(0), R(0))T ∈ R7+0 .
We first state the following lemma.
Lemma 5.1. Suppose Ω ⊂ R×Cn is open, fi ∈ C(Ω, R), i = 1, 2, 3, ..., n. If fi |xi (t)=0,Xt ∈Cn+0 ≥
0, Xt = (x1t , x2t , ....., x1n )T , i = 1, 2, 3, ...., n, then Cn+0 {φ = (φ1 , ....., φn ) : φ ∈ C([−τ, 0], Rn+0 )}
is the invariant domain of the following equations

where Rn+0

dxi (t)
= fi (t, Xt ), t ≥ σ, i = 1, 2, 3, ..., n.
dt
= {(x1 , ....xn ) : xi ≥ 0, i = 1, ...., n} [39].

Proposition 5.1. The system (2.2) is invariant in R7+0 .
Proof. By re-writing the system (2.2) we have:
dX
= B(X(t)), X(0) = X0 ≥ 0
(S-1)
dt
B(X(t)) = (B1 (X), B1 (X), ..., B7 (X))T
We note that
dL
dE
β1 S(I + ρA)
dS
|S=0 = ΠH + ωL > 0,
|L=0 = lS ≥ 0,
|E=0 =
≥ 0,

|C=0 = τ I ≥ 0,

dR
|R=0 = γ1 A + γ2 I + γ3 C ≥ 0.
dt
Then it follows from the Lemma 5.1 that R7+0 is an invariant set for the COVID-19
system (2.2) with lockdown.
Corollary 5.1. The system (2.1) is invariant in R6+0 .
Proof. Proceeding as proposition 5.1, we can easily show that R6+0 is an invariant set for
the COVID-19 system (2.1) without lockdown.
Lemma 5.2. The system (2.2) is bounded in the region
Ω = {(S, L, E, A, I, C, R) ∈ R7+0 |S + L + E + A + I + C + R ≤
Proof. We have from the system (2.2):
dN
= ΠH − µN − δC ≤ ΠH − µN
dt
ΠH
=⇒ lim supN (t) ≤
t→∞
µ
Hence the system (2.2) is bounded.

Corollary 5.2. The system (2.1) is bounded in the region
Ω = {(S, E, A, I, C, R) ∈ R6+0 |S + E + A + I + C + R ≤ ΠµH }
∗

Proof. proceeding same as lemma 5.2, we can easily show that the system (2.1) is bounded
in Ω∗ .
Local stability of disease-free equilibrium (DFE)
The DFE of the model (2.2) is provided as follows:
ε0 = (S 0 , L0 , E 0 , A0 , I 0 , C 0 , R0 )
 Π (µ + ω)

ΠH l
H
=
,
, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
µ (µ + ω + l) µ (µ + ω + l)
The local stability of ε0 can be established for the COVID-19 system (2.2) by using the
next generation operator method. Using the notation in [32], the matrices F for the new
infection and V for the transition terms are given, respectively, by


0 ρβ1 β1 0

It follows that the basic reproduction number [40], denoted by R0 = Φ(F V −1 ), where Φ
is the spectral radius, is given by
R0 =

β1 κσ
ρβ1 (1 − κ)σ
+
(µ + σ)(γ2 + τ + µ) (µ + σ)(γ1 + µ)

Using Theorem 2 in [32], the following result is established.
Lemma 5.3. The DFE, ε0 , of the model (2.2) is locally-asymptotically stable (LAS) if
R0 < 1, and unstable if R0 > 1.
The threshold quantity, R0 is the basic reproduction number of the disease [40; 41; 42].
This represent the average number of secondary cases generated by a infected person in
a fully susceptible population. The epidemiological significance of 5.3 is that when R0
is less than unity, a low influx of infected individuals into the population will not cause
major outbreaks, and the disease would die out in time.

L̇ =

Since all the variables and parameters of the model (2.2) are non-negative, it follows that
L̇ ≤ 0 for R0 ≤ 1 with L̇ = 0 at diseases free equilibrium. Hence, L is a Lyapunov
function on Ω. Therefore, followed by LaSalles Invariance Principle [43], that
(E(t), A(t), I(t)) → (0, 0, 0) as t → ∞

(S-2)

Since lim supI(t) = 0 (from S-2), it follows that, for sufficiently small  > 0, there exist
t→∞

constants B1 > 0 such that lim supI(t) ≤  for all t > B1 .
t→∞

Hence, it follows from the sixth equation of the model (2.2) that, for t > B1 ,
dC
≤ τ  − k4 C
dt
Therefore using comparison theorem [44]
C ∞ = lim supC(t) ≤
t→∞

31

τ
k4

So as  → 0, C ∞ = lim supC(t) ≤ 0
t→∞

Similarly by using lim inf I(t) = 0, it can be shown that
t→∞

C∞ = lim inf C(t) ≥ 0
t→∞

Thus, it follows from above two relations
C∞ ≥ 0 ≥ C ∞
Hence lim C(t) = 0
t→∞
Similarly, it can be shown that
lim R(t) = 0, lim S(t) =

t→∞

t→∞

ΠH (µ + ω)
ΠH l
, and lim L(t) =

t→∞
µ (µ + ω + l)

Therefore by combining all above equations, it follows that each solution of the model
equations (2.2), with initial conditions ∈ Ω , approaches ε0 as t → ∞ for R0 ≤ 1.
Existence and stability of endemic equilibria
In this section, the existence of the endemic equilibrium of the model (2.2) is established. Let us denote

M1 =

Let ε∗ = (S ∗ , E ∗ , A∗ , I ∗ , C ∗ , R∗ ) represents any arbitrary endemic equilibrium point
(EEP) of the model (2.2). Further, define
λ∗ =

β1 (I ∗ + ρA∗ )
N ∗ − L∗ − C ∗

(S-3)

It follows, by solving the equations in (2.2) at steady-state, that

(S-4)

Substituting the expression in (S-4) into (S-3) shows that the non-zero equilibrium of the
model (2.1) satisfy the following linear equation, in terms of λ∗ :
Aλ∗ = B

(S-5)

where
A = µM1 + M2 (µ + γ1 ) + M3 (µ + γ2 ) + γ3 M4
B = µ (µ + ω) (R0 − 1)
Since, M1 > 0, M2 > 0, M3 > 0, and M4 > 0 =⇒ A > 0, it is clear that the
model (2.2) has an unique endemic equilibrium point (EEP) whenever R0 > 1 and no
positive endemic equilibrium point whenever R0 < 1. This rules out the possibility of
the existence of equilibrium other than DFE whenever R0 < 1. Therefore, we have the
following result:
Theorem 5.2. The model (2.2) has a unique endemic (positive) equilibrium, given by
ε∗ , whenever R0 > 1 and has no endemic equilibrium for R0 ≤ 1.
Now we will prove the local stability of endemic equilibrium.
Theorem 5.3. The endemic equilibrium ε∗ of the COVID-19 system (2.2) with lockdown
is locally asymptotically stable if R0 > 1.
Proof. The Jacobian matrix of the system (2.2) Jε0 at DFE is given by

Here, by taking β1 as a bifurcation parameter, we use the central manifold theory
method to determine the local stability of the endemic equilibrium [45]. Taking β1 as the
bifurcation parameter and gives critical value of β1 at R0 = 1 is given as
β1∗ =

(µ + σ)(γ1 + µ)(γ2 + τ + µ)
[κσ(γ1 + µ) + (1 − κ)ρσ(γ2 + τ + µ)]

33

The Jacobian of (2.2) at β = β1∗ , denoted by Jε0 |β=β1∗ has a right eigenvector (corresponding to the zero eigenvalue) given by w = (w1 , w2 , w3 , w4 , w5 , w6 , w7 )T , where

Since a < 0 and b > 0 at β = β1∗ , therefore using the Remark 1 of the Theorem 4.1 stated
in [45], a transcritical bifurcation occurs at R0 = 1 and the unique endemic equilibrium of
the COVID-19 system (2.2) with lockdown is locally asymptotically stable for R0 > 1.
