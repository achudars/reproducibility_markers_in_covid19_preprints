Abstract. On the base of logic discrete equations system mathematical
modeling of COVID-19 epidemic spread was carried out in the whole world and in
the countries with the largest number of infected people such as the USA, Brasil,
Russia and India in the first half of 2020. It was shown that for the countries with
strong restrictive measures the spread of COVID-19 fit on a single wave with small
capacity as for a number of countries with violation of restrictive measures the
spread of the epidemic fit on a waves superposition. For countries with large
population mixing (Brazil, India), the spread of the coronavirus epidemic today
also fits into a single wave, but with a huge capacity value (for Brazil - 80 million
people, for India - 40 million people). We estimated that the epidemic spread in the
world today fits into 5 waves. The first two waves are caused by the epidemic
spread in China (the first - in Wuhan), the third - by the epidemic spread in
European countries, the fourth mainly by the epidemic spread in Russia and the
USA, the fifth wave is mainly caused by the epidemic spread in Latin America and
South Asia. It was the fifth wave that led to the spread of the coronavirus epidemic
COVID-19 entering a new phase, with an increase in the number of infected more
than 100 thousand inhabitants. For all the studied countries and the world, for each
of the superposition waves, the wave capacities and growth indicators were
calculated. The local peaks of the waves and their ending times are determined. It
was the fifth wave that led to the fact that COVID-19 spread is entering a new
phase, with the increase in the number of infected people being more than 100

thousand inhabitants. For all the countries being examined and for the whole
world, for each of the superposition waves we calculated the waves capacities and
index of infected people growth. The local peaks of the waves and their ending
times are determined.

1. Introduction
The major part of the papers devoted to modeling the COVID-19 epidemic
spread is based on the mathematical model named SIR-model. SIR − model
(Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered model) is considered to be more realistic.
According to SIR − model the total population is divided into three parts: the
proportion of the people susceptible to the disease - y (Susceptible), infected - x
(Infectious) and recovered - z (Recovered). The presence of recovering people in
the model reduces the number of infected people who are able to infect others.
The equations of the SIR model have the form:
=−
=

,
− ,

(1)

= ,
where y – the part of people susceptible to the disease, x – the number of infected
inhabitants, z – the number of recovered people, λ – the index of infected growth, µ
– the index of recovered growth.
This SIR-model was used earlier in the papers [1, 2] for modeling infection
spread among people and animals. In this model epidemic spread is determined by
the ratio of the parameters λ/µ. If this ratio is less than 1, the epidemic is fading; if

2

it is more than 1, the epidemic is spreading. For modeling of COVID-19 epidemic
spread SIR- model was used in the [3-5].
There the SIR model development - the SEiR model. In this model, the
group of infected people is divided into two subgroups. Group 1 is at the stage of
the incubation period and is not contagious; Group 2 is made up of people who are
contagious. Thus, the transition S → E → I → R occurs. SEiR-model as a software
package is presented on an electronic resource [6]. Many authors on mathematical
modeling of COVID-19 epidemic spread used the extended SEiR-model
(with a number of additional states of infected and recovered groups), implemented
by researcher R. Neira team and presented in the public domain on an electronic
resource [7].
The SEiR-model requires the determination of many parameters. The task of
model parameters searching with the use of actual data is the inverse problem and
incorrect, i.e. having several solutions. And if the task is to determine only the
number of infected people and the increase in the number of infected, it is better to
use the discrete logistic equation (for the application of which it is necessary to
determine only two parameters - the index of growth in the number of infected
people and the capacity of the system).
The papers [8, 9] present the results of discrete logistic equation use to simulate
the epidemic spread in Moscow (at the initial stages of the epidemic), in a number
of European, Asian countries, and Israel. Modeling the epidemic spread not only at
the initial stage, we noticed that the use of the only one discrete logistic equation is
well applicable before the peak and on the peak of epidemic spread.
And in those countries where, after the peak of the increase in the number of
infected people, the so-called “plateau” occurs and there is no drop in the increase
in the number of infected people (as new sites of infection appear), we have to
increase the capacity of the system all the time. So the model lost its predictive
power, and mismatching between the calculated and actual data increased
significantly. The parameters were adjusted to the right side (after the peak) of the
curve of the increase of the infected people and we obtained the mismatching from
3

the left side of the curve involved. And only the use of not a single but a system of
discrete logistic equations led to the fact that the presence of waves superposition
of reduced significantly the mismatching between the calculated and actual data
both for the curve of infected people number and for the curve of the increase in
the number of infected people.
Using the waves superposition approach we have achieved the smallest
mismatching between actual and calculated data on the examples of modeling the
epidemic spread in such countries as Spain and Italy (which are already almost
completing the epidemic), in this work we consider the epidemic spread in the
countries with the highest increase in the number of infected: the USA, Brazil,
Russia, India as well as the epidemic spread all over the world.
2. Mathematical model
For modeling with the use of superposition we have the system of
discrete logistic equations:
()
()

=

() ()

(1 −

/

)

(2)

– the number of inhabitants in the n-th moment of time who has infected

during the i-th wave of the epidemic spread,

()

is the system capacity that

characterizes the maximum value for the number of people who can potentially be
infected under the i-th wave of the epidemic spread. This parameter N depends on
the whole number of factors such as the country openness to the virus infection
(the influx of people from the epidemic centers), crowding, population density, the
presence of megacities, population mobility and mixing, the presence of transport
hubs, the discipline of the population, disease resistance, etc.
The model describes the growth in accordance with the logistic function: the
number of patients

()

until it is rather small (

in the i-th wave of epidemic spread grows dramatically
()

<<

()

), after that the growth rate is slower and slower

and the number of patients asymptotically tends to a stationary value

()

. Let’s

make a change in variables and bring the system (2) to the form

and parameters

are dimensionless. When values 0 <

()

, the number of infected people during the
()

i-th wave will tend to zero. When the values 1 <

≤ 3 regardless of the initial

state, dimensionless number of the population infected during the i-th wave of
epidemic spread will tend to the stationary steady state.
()

̅( ) =

()

Therefore during the time the number of people infected in the i-th wave of
epidemic spread (at the time of its completion) will be equal
()

(5)

Relations (4) and (5) are true while maintaining a constant index for the growth of
the population

()

during all the time of the i-th epidemic wave spread. For small

numbers of infected people (at the initial stages of the i-th wave), we have the
equality
()
()

(6)

(7)

or

From the relations (6) and (7) we can see that the capacity of the wave

at the

initial period of wave spread does not affect on the calculation of the number of
infected people.
We will write the relation for determining the number of infected people at the
local peak for the increase in infected people in the i-th wave of the epidemic
spread

We can see from the expression (9) that the system capacity

can be defined in

the vicinity of a local peak of the i-th wave of epidemic spread.
The system capacity will be equal

We have developed the algorithm for searching the parameters (

on the base of actual data on the number of infected people as well as on the daily
increase in the number of infected that provides the minimum mismatching
between calculated and actual data on the number of infected and on the increase
of the number of infected.

4. Discussion of the results
Figure 1 shows the calculation results on the daily increase of COVID-19
infected people, which we presented in the paper [9]. The system capacity was ~
750,000 people. The number of COVID-19 infected people by the end of the
epidemic (March) was ~ 82,000 inhabitants. In the work [9] the indices values for
the number of infected population growth are presented, which decreased in
12

accordance with the restrictive measures adopted in China. The entire population
of China strictly complied with the restrictive measures prescribed by the Chinese
government. For countries such as China in which restrictive measures for the
epidemic spread were strictly observed, epidemic spread fits in one wave, which
follows from Fig. 1 that corresponds to the daily increase in the number of infected
with COVID-19 people.
Figure 2 shows the calculation results for the daily increase in number of
COVID-19 infected people in Moscow, which we presented in the paper [8].
When we were modeling the epidemic spread it was at the initial stage. And having
found the indices of the number of infected people growth, we did not know the
value of the system capacity and considered 4 scenarios for epidemic development
in Moscow. We considered the capacities: 300,000, 500,000, 700,000, and
1,000,000 Moscow residents. The capacity was to be determined in the vicinity of
the peak. The scenario with the capacity of 1,000,000 people we then called New
York’s and by the end of the epidemic (June) it gave 75,000 infected Moscow
residents. At that moment this figure for one city seemed to be awesome.
Figure 3 presents data on the daily increase in the number of people infected
with COVID-19 in Moscow from the epidemic beginning to the end of June. From
fig. 3 we can see that the first wave is that wave which is shown in Fig. 2 and
corresponds to the scenario with a capacity of 1,000,000 people (called New
York’s by us). It was that wave that was the longest one, the end of this wave - the
end of June and it gave us the number of infected ~ 75,000 inhabitants. The second
and third waves of the epidemic spread in Moscow arose because of noncompliance with restrictive measures in the twentieth of April and led to the fact
that the peak of the epidemic was shifted to May 7 and gave us another 102
thousand infected residents. The 4th wave appeared from 11.05 to 16.05 and gave
us the number of infected ~ 30 thousand people. It arose due to violation of
restrictions on the May holidays. The fifth wave appeared on May 26, bringing the
number of coronavirus infected ~ 15 thousand people and shifting the end of the
epidemic in Moscow to mid-July. The fifth wave is likely to occur when the
13

restrictions were lifted at the beginning of industrial enterprises work in May. Thus
the number of people infected in Moscow while maintaining the restrictions should
have been equal to 222 thousand inhabitants at the end of the epidemic.
But since a number of restrictions were lifted in early June we examined three
scenarios for the COVID-19 epidemic development when the restrictions were
removed on June 9. It launched the 6th wave with the same index of the number of
infected growth as for the 5th wave.
We examined 3 scenarios with different capacities: 150,000 inhabitants (as for
the 5th wave), 300,000 inhabitants and 500,000 inhabitants. The peak of the 6th
wave was in the vicinity of July 9, and the ending is expected in mid-August. The
sixth wave will add to the number of infected people according to the scenarios,
respectively: 15,000, 30,000, 50,000 inhabitants, and will bring the total number of
infected to the values, respectively: 237,000, 252,000, 272,000 Moscow residents.
Which of scenarios to be implemented in Moscow will be clear in mid-July.
It should be noted that the indices of the number of infected people growth and
waves capacity were determined from actual data [12], the largest error in the
number of infected people did not exceed 10% (relative error) and in most cases it
was less then l%.
Figure 4 shows the epidemic spread in Russia (calculations dated June 25),
which fits on the day of calculation for 6 waves. Data on the indices of the number
of infected people growth and waves capacities of the epidemic in Russia are
presented in table 2.
The local peaks of these six waves were, respectively, the dates: 29.04 (first
wave), 07.05 (second wave), 20.05 (third wave), 29.05 (fourth wave), 08.06 (fifth
wave), 22.06 (sixth wave). Table 7 shows the number of COVID-19 infected
people that have brought these 6 waves.

The first three waves in Russia were determined by the trend of Moscow and
the Moscow region, the next three waves of COVID-19 spread in Russia are
associated with the epidemic spread in the European part of Russia, the regions of
the Urals, the regions of the Urals, Siberia, the Far East, and the North. Thus on
June 25 the forecast according to the model of 6 waves superposition will give the
number of coronavirus infected in Russia ~ 662 thousand inhabitants.
Recalculation according to the mathematical model should be carried out after 1015 days. The following waves might appear that will increase the number of
infected people. It should be noted that if strict restrictive measures were observed
in Russia then the country would have passed through an epidemic limited to a
single wave and would have the number of infected ~ 200 thousand inhabitants as
it was predicted in our work [9]. It should be mentioned that in the calculations
according to the number of infected in Russia the error did not exceed 5%, in most
cases it was less than 0.5 %.
Figure 5 presents a curve for the daily increase in the number of infected
population in India and Table 3 shows the values of indices for the number of
infected people growth and the system capacity. We can see that with the
introduction of restrictions in the country, the index of infected people growth was
consistently decreasing. But such a huge capacity indicates about very strong
mixing in India, apparently such high capacity value is likely to be associated with
large population crowding.
The system capacity is not directly related to the country population. So, the
wave capacity for China is only 750 thousand people, for Russia ~ 6.3 million
people (which is also not rather small). The wave peak of the epidemic spread in
15

India is expected on June 30 with the increase of infected people not less than 15
thousand inhabitants.
The epidemic beginning in India was on February 14, the end of the epidemic
will be in late November - early December. The size of a single wave will give
1,103,000 infected India residents. But we believe that in the future there may be
other waves that can increase the number of infected people. The error in
calculating the number of infected in India did not exceed 25% in some cases.
Figure 6 presents data on the daily increase in the number of infected
COVID-19 in Brazil (calculated on June 22) Table 4 shows the data on indices of
the number of infected people growth in Brazil and the system capacity. Capacity
for Brazil is about 80 million inhabitants. At the moment it is the largest capacity
for a single wave. Such a high capacity provides the single wave length from
February 28 to the beginning of December. The peak of the wave is June 24, with
the number of infected people being more than 35 thousand inhabitants. The first
wave gives the number of infected people by the epidemic end about 2,307,000
Brazilians. We believe that there will be the next waves which can significantly
increase the number of infected in Brazil. Although from the table 4 swe can see
that the index of the number of infected people decreased during the course of the
epidemic, but the measures taken in the country are apparently insufficient to curb
the epidemic in the country. Capacity of 80 million people indicates about a very
strong mixing in the country. The error in calculating the number of infected in
some cases does not exceed 25%.
Figure 7 and Table 5 shows the calculated curves for the COVID-19
epidemic spread in the USA as well as the indices for the number of infected
people growth and the waves capacity for the epidemic spread in the USA. The
COVID-19 epidemic development in the United States fits into the superposition
of 7 waves with total capacity of 24.4 million inhabitants. This is the third largest
system capacity after the capacity of Brazil and India. This also indicates high
mixing in the country and non-compliance with restrictive measures.

7-th wave

The first two waves arose one after another and appeared in early March in
Washington and New York (they have different capacities) and brought a total of ~
720 thousand infected people and then the epidemic spread was passing across
states and cities (both in breadth and inland). The 6th wave seems to be related to
the beginning of restrictions relaxation and brought 422,220 infected residents. But
the seventh wave has formed recently - 09.06 and is connected in our opinion with
the protest actions. The peak of the seventh wave is in the vicinity of June 27.
Therefore we proposed 2 scenarios with different capacities for the epidemic
development: 1,500,000 (scenario 1), 2,000,000 (scenario 2). Both scenarios fit
well with the actual data on the number of infected with an error in some cases of
less than 10%.
A global peak from the superposition of 5, 6, and 7 waves will give the
increase of infected people of 43,335 inhabitants according to scenario 1 and
17

52,441 people in scenario 2. At the end of June and early July, it will become clear
according to which scenario events are developing in the USA. According to
scenario 1, the protests will give the number of infected about 289,346 people and
383,158 infected according to scenario 2. Thus on June 25 the model gives a
forecast for the epidemic end to the late August with the number of 2,747,737
infected people (according to scenario 1) and with a number of 2,841,576 infected
(according to scenario 2). If the following waves arise because of the restrictions
lifting and high mixing then the number of infected people will increase and the
epidemic duration will shift
Figure 8 and Table 6 show the calculations results (dated June 22) for
modeling of the epidemic spread all over the world. The COVID-19 epidemic
spread in the whole world fits into 5 waves, the characteristics of which being
presented in Table 9.

The first two waves of the COVID-19 epidemic spread in the world
correspond to the epidemic spread in China with the number of infected being
82,347 residents and the end on 18.03. All these data are consistent with the actual
epidemic spread in China. The system capacity while calculating separately the
epidemic spread in China [9] was 760 thousand inhabitants and the capacity of the
18

first two waves in the world was 750 thousand inhabitants (see Table 9). The error
in the calculations for the number of infected people in comparison with the actual
data (for the first 2 waves) does not exceed 2%, and when calculating the
remaining waves it does not exceed 6%.
The third wave occurred on 10.02 and ended in late May and brought the world
a little less than a million infected people (948,586 see table 9). We believe that the
third wave covers the epidemic spread in Europe. The fourth wave of the epidemic
spread was determined on March 14 and gave a local peak on April 27. The end of
the fourth wave is mid-September (see Table 9) and it will bring 3,875,593
infected people. The 4th wave is likely to capture the epidemic spread in the
countries such as Russia, some states in the USA, etc.
The fifth wave was confirmed on April 21, its local peak occurred on June 16
with an increase of infected being 146,170 people (see Table 9), the end date is
November. The fifth wave is most likely to cover the epidemic spread in Latin
America (Brazil, Peru, Chile, etc.), in the countries of South Asia (India, Pakistan,
Bangladesh, etc.), in some states of the USA.
The fifth wave is slightly less than 7 million infected residents, see table 9
(6,802,485 inhabitants). With the advent of the fifth wave the epidemic spread in
the world has passed into a “new phase”, the daily increase in the number of
infected people in the world has exceeded 100,000 people daily. Thus, the
mathematical model for COVID-19 epidemic in the world predicts (calculated on
June 22) that the superposition of five waves will give the world 11,709,311
infected people.
We believe that the world expects the following waves which have not been
observed in actual data yet, the next waves will increase the number of infected
people in the world.
Conclusions
On the base of a system of discrete logistic equations we developed an
approach by superposition of waves for modeling of the COVID-19 epidemic both
in the whole world and in particular countries. In countries that strictly enforce
19

restrictive measures and have small “capacities”, the epidemic spread fits on one
single wave (case study is the epidemic spread in China).
The COVID-19 epidemic spread in the whole world fits into the
superposition of 5 waves (calculated on June 22). In further calculations to correct
the model only the fifth wave will be corrected (the remaining waves will remain
unchanged) and the subsequent waves will take their place corresponding to the
epidemic spread in the world.
The first 2 waves characterize the epidemic spread in China; the third wave
reflects the impact of the epidemic spread in European countries; the fourth wave
mainly reflects the epidemic spread in the United States and Russia; the fifth wave
is most likely to characterize the epidemic spread in Latin America and South
Asia.
At the moment the mathematical model predicts the end date for the
COVID-19 epidemic in the world not earlier than December with infected
population being of over 12 million people. Subsequent waves will shift the
deadline for pandemic ending in the world and increase the number of infected
people.
The developed approach made it possible to determine that the COVID-19
epidemic spread in the United States fits on 7 waves. The seventh wave of the
epidemic arose most likely because of the restrictions lifting and protests in the
United States. The forecast according to the mathematical model is the deadline for
epidemic ending in the United States will be not earlier than August with the
number of infected people exceeding 2,800,000 inhabitants. Subsequent waves in
the United States may lead to an increase in the number of infected people and can
shift the epidemic end.
Mathematical modeling shows that at the moment the epidemic spread in
Brazil and India fits into a single wave of large capacity. The epidemic end dates in
Brazil and India are not earlier than November with the numbers of infected: more
than 2,300,000 inhabitants in Brazil and more than 1 million inhabitants in India.
20

Subsequent waves that can increase the number of infected at times are not
excluded.
It was shown that the epidemic spread in Russia fits into the superposition of
6 waves. Whereas the spread of the epidemic in Moscow and the Moscow Region
influenced the epidemic spread in whole Russia in the first three waves, the
subsequent waves are associated with the epidemic spread beyond the Urals, to
Siberian regions, regions of the Far East and North in Russia. The end date of the
epidemic in Russia is not earlier than August with infected population exceeding
660 thousand inhabitants.
Subsequent waves might lead to increase in the number of infected and to a
shift in epidemic end in Russia. The parameters for mathematical models of the
epidemic spread in the world and in the countries that give the largest increase in
the number of infected people were obtained.
