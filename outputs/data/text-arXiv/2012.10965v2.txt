Keywords: Infections disease modeling; Dynamical growth patterns; Physics and society; Scaling of epidemics growth
Widespread growth signatures in COVID-19 confirmed case counts are reported, with sharp transitions between three distinct dynamical regimes (exponential, superlinear and sublinear). Through analytical and numerical analysis, a novel framework is developed
that exploits information in these signatures. An approach well known to physics is applied, where one looks for common dynamical
features, independently from differences in other factors. These features and associated scaling laws are used as a powerful tool to
pinpoint regions where analytical derivations are effective, get an insight into qualitative changes of the disease progression, and infer
the key infection parameters. The developed framework for joint analytical and numerical analysis of empirically observed COVID19 growth patterns can lead to a fundamental understanding of infection progression under strong control measures, applicable to
outbursts of both COVID-19 and other infectious diseases.

Introduction: COVID-19 pandemic introduced unprecedented worldwide social distancing measures[1] .
While interventions such as quarantine or vaccination have been extensively studied in quantitative epidemiology, effects of social distancing are not well understood[2]-[4] , and when addressed, they have been
studied only numerically. Unique opportunity to understand these effects has been provided by COVID19 tracing through confirmed case counts, active cases and fatalities, in a variety of countries with different demographic and environmental conditions[5, 6] . We here show that focusing on analytical and numerical derivations in distinct epidemics growth regimes, is a novel and effective approach in revealing
infection progression mechanisms that may be a valuable alternative to detailed numerical simulations.
Outline: Our COVID-19 dynamics model is introduced in the Model section. In Numerical Framework/Results and Discussion sections, we will extract COVID-19 count data [7] and select those countries that systematically trace not only confirmed cases and fatalities, but also active cases (Andorra,
Austria, Czechia, Croatia, Cuba, Germany, Israel, New Zealand, Switzerland and Turkey), which allows
tight constraint of numerical analysis. We will observe three characteristic growth regimes in confirmed
case counts, show that our model is well constrained by these regimes for a wide range of countries, and
provide an intuitive explanation behind the emergence of such regimes. In Analytical Framework/Results
and Discussion sections, analysis of the characteristic (inflection and maximum) points of the infective
curve will allow to i) explain the nearly constant value of the scaling exponent in the superlinear regime
of confirmed counts; ii) understand the relation between the duration of this regime and strength of social distancing; iii) pinpoint changes in the reproduction number from outburst to extinguishing the infection, and iv) constrain the main parameter quantifying the effect of social distancing by analysing
scaling of the infection growth with time in the sublinear regime. The obtained constraints provide a
basis for successful analysis of countries that did not continuously track the active cases (here demonstrated for France, Italy, Spain, United Kingdom and Serbia). We will finally present the key infection
parameters inferred through combined analytical and numerical analysis.
Model: We develop a mechanistic model (nonlinear and nonhomogeneous), which takes into account
gradual introduction of social distancing (as relevant for most countries’ response), in addition to other
1

important infection progression mechanisms. We start from standard compartments for epidemiological models, i.e., susceptible (S), exposed (E), infective (I) and recovered (R)[2]-[4] . To account for social
distancing and observable quantities, we introduce additional compartments: protected (P ) - where individuals effectively move from susceptible category due to social distancing; total number of diagnosed
(confirmed and consequently quarantined) cases (D), active cases (A), and fatalities (F ). D, A and F
correspond to directly observable (measured) quantities, but are indirect observables of I, as only part of
infective individuals gets diagnosed, due to a large number of mild/asymptomatic cases[8] .
We implement the model deterministically, as COVID-19 count numbers are very high wherever reasonable testing capacities are employed. This makes model analytically tractable, and allows robust parameter inference through combination of analytically derived expressions and tightly constrained numerical
analysis, as we show below. Our analysis is applied separately to each country, as the effect of social distancing, initial numbers of infected and exposed cases, diagnosis/detection efficiency and transmission
rates may be different. However, within a given country, we do not take into account different heterogeneities − demographic, spatial, population activity, or seasonality effects[2, 9, 10] . Alternatively, global
dynamical properties of the outbreak can be analyzed in a probabilistic framework employing partial differential equations in an age-structured model[11, 12] . These can readily be included in our model, but
would lead to model structure which is not analytically tractable, so these extensions are left for future
work.
Given this, the model equations are:
dS/dt = −βIS/N − dP/dt; dP/dt = α/(1 + (t0 /t)n )S
dE/dt = βIS/N − σE; dI/dt = σE − γI − δI; dR/dt = γI
dD/dt = δI; dA/dt = δI − hA − mA; dF/dt = mA

(1)
(2)
(3)

where N is the total population number; β - the transmission rate; σ - inverse of the latency period; γ
- inverse of the infectious period; δ - inverse of the detection/diagnosis period;  - detection efficiency; h
- the recovery rate; m - the mortality rate. Social distancing is included through Eq. (1) (second equation), which represents the rate at which the population moves (on average) from susceptible to protected category. The term 1+(tα0 /t)n corresponds to a sigmoidal dependence (similar to Fermi-Dirac function, in quantitative biology known as the Hill function[13] ). Time t0 determines the half-saturation, so
that well before t0 the social distancing is negligible, while well after t0 the rate of transition to the protected category approaches α. Parameter n (the Hill constant) determines how rapidly the social distancing is introduced, i.e., large n leads to rapid transition from OFF to ON state, and vice versa[13] .
Eq. (3) considers that only a fraction of the infected is diagnosed, so that δI takes into account the diagnosis and the subsequent quarantine process.
Analytical Framework: To make the problem analytically tractable, we approximate the Hill function in the first relation of Eq. (1) by unit step function, so that after t0 the 2nd term in Eq. (1) becomes
−αS and dominates over the 1st term, i.e., S(t) ∼ e−αt . We checked that this approximation agrees well
with full-fledged numerical simulations (Figure 1D and Supplement). In all comparisons with analytical
results, numerical analysis is done with the full model, allowing an independent check of both analytical
derivations and employed approximations. Under this assumption, Eqs. (1-2) reduce to:

We next introduce two time regions: I) t ≤ t0 and II) t > t0 and solve Eq. (4) separately within these
regions, where corresponding solutions are denoted as II (t) and III (t). As in the above expressions γ + δ
always appear together, we further denote γ + δ → γ.
For II (t), we take I(t = 0) ≡ I0 , and restrict to dominant (positive) Jacobian eigenvalue, leading to the

Eqs. (14, 15) have to be solved numerically, but, as γ and σ are constants, we, interestingly, obtain that
solutions will depend only on α. Since, for the analysis of superlinear and sublinear regimes, only the left
inflection point and the maximum are important, we will further omit the second solution of Eq. (15)
(Eq. (14) has one solution), and denote yi = fi1 (α) ≡ fi (α), ym = fm (α) (these two solutions are presented as upper and lower curves on Figure 2C, respectively), so that the effective reproduction numbers
at inflection and maximum points (Re,i and Re,m ) are:
Re,i ≡ R0,free e−αti = fi (α),
Re,m ≡ R0,free e−αtm = fm (α).
From this follows the length of superlinear regime (between inflection and maximum points):

which allows to directly constrain α.
Numerical Framework: We first numerically analyze outburst dynamics in the countries that continuously updated[18] three observable categories (D, A and F ). For a large majority of countries active
cases were either not tracked or were not continuously updated, so the analysis is done for 10 countries
listed in the Outline section.
In the exponential regime, the analytical closed-form solution is given by Eq. (5). From this, and the
initial slope of ln (D) curve (once the number of counts are out of the stochastic regime), β can be directly determined, while the corresponding eigenvector sets the ratio of I0 to E0 . The intercept of the
initial exponential growth of D at t = 0 sets the product of I0 and δ. h and m can also be readily constrained, as from Eqs. (3), they depend only on integrals of the corresponding counts; here note that
d(D − A − F )/dt = hA. Also[17],[19],[20] , σ = 1/3 day−1 and γ = 1/4 day−1 , characterize fundamental
infectious process, which we assume not to change between different countries.
Only parameters related with the intervention measures (α, t0 , n, δ) are left to be inferred numerically,
leading to tightly constrained numerical results. For this, we individually performed joint fit to all three
observable quantities (A, D, F ) for each country. The errors are estimated through Monte-Carlo[21, 22]
simulations, assuming that count numbers follow Poisson distribution.
Results and Discussion: Representative numerical results are shown in Figure 1 for Germany, while
other countries are shown in the Supplement. In Figure 1A-C (and Supplement) we see a good agreement of our numerical analysis with all three classes of the case counts. In Figure 1D, we see sharp transitions between the three growth patterns indicated in the figure: i) exponential growth, observed as a
straight line in log-linear plot in Figure 1E; ii) superlinear growth, a straight line in log-log plot in Figure 1F; iii) sublinear growth, a straight line in linear-log plot in Figure 1G.
Transition between the growth patterns can be qualitatively understood from Eq. (3), and I(t) curve
in Figure 1D. The exponential growth has to break after the inflection point of I(t), i.e., once the maximum of its first derivative (I 0 (t) in Figure 1D) is reached. In the superlinear regime, confirmed counts
case (D(t)) curve is convex (D00 (t) > 0), so this regime breaks once I 0 (t) (dashed blue curve) becomes
negative. Equivalently, D(t) curve becomes concave (enters sublinear regime) once the maximum of the
I(t) is reached. Note that the growth of D(t) can reemerge if the social distancing measures are alleviated. Our model can account for this by allowing transition from protected back to susceptible category,
which is out of the scope of this study, but may improve the agreement with the data at later times (see
Figs. 1A-C). In addition to this numerical/intuitive understanding, we also showed that we analytically
reproduce the emergence of these growth regimes (Eqs. (6), (14), (15)). Can we also analytically derive
the parameters that characterize these regimes?

transition from exponential to sublinear growth. D) Comparison of α constrained from analytical derivations (the grey
bands) and numerical analysis, with countries indicated on the horizontal axis by their abbreviations. Results obtained by
independent numerical analysis are presented by red dots with corresponding errorbars.

The exponential regime is straightforward to explain, as described in the previous section. The superlinear regime is in between the left inflection point and the maximum of I(t), so that infective numbers
grow, but with a decreasing rate. While the derivations are straightforward in the exponential regime,
they are highly non-trivial during the subsequent subexponential (superlinear and sublinear) growth. As
the superlinear regime spans the region between the left inflection point (ti , I 00 (ti ) = 0) and the maximum (tm , I 0 (tm ) = 0), its duration is ∆t = tm − ti given by Eq. (17), with ∼ 1/α dependence, so that
weak measures lead to protracted superlinear growth (see Figure 2A). This tendency is also confirmed
by independent numerical analysis in Figure 2A, where for each individual country we numerically infer
α and extract the length of the superlinear regime. Therefore, the duration of the superlinear regime indicates the effectiveness of introduced social distancing.
The scaling exponent υ of the superlinear regime is given by Eq. (19), and shown in Figure 2B, where
we predict that all countries are roughly in the same range of 1.2 < υ < 1.5 (surprisingly, weakly dependent on α), despite significant differences in the applied measures, demographic and environmental
factors. This result is (independently from our model) confirmed from case count numbers (the slope in
Figure 1F, and equivalently for other countries, see Figure 2B).
How the effective reproduction number Re changes during this regime, i.e., between the left inflection
point and the maximum of I(t)? Re quantifies the average number of secondary cases per infectious case,
so that Re > 1 signifies disease outburst, while for Re < 1 the disease starts to be eliminated from the
population[17] . The Eq. (16) provides expressions for Re,i (at the inflection point) and Re,m (at the maximum). Interestingly, from Figure 2C, we observe that Re,i and Re,m do not depend on R0,free and are, respectively, significantly larger and smaller than 1, which shows that transition from infection outburst to

extinguishing happens during the superlinear growth. Consequently, the steepness of Re change over the
superlinear regime significantly increases (larger change over smaller time interval, see Figure 2C) with
the measure strength.
Finally, in the sublinear regime, in a wide vicinity of I(t) maximum (which marks the beginning of the
sublinear growth) leading non-linear term of D(t) is cubic (∼ t3 , with negative prefactor). This is consistent with the expansion of I(t) around tm , which has leading negative quadratic (t2 ) dependence (see
Eqs. (3) and (20)). The ratio between the prefactors in D(t) expansion is given by Eq. (21), from which
we see that α can be directly constrained, as shown in Figure 2D. For the 10 countries with consistent
tracking of D, A and F , we independently numerically determined α and compared it with analytical results coming from Eq. (21), obtaining an excellent agreement between our derivations and numerical results. The obtained α values should be understood as an effective epidemic containment measure - i.e.,
estimating the true result of the introduced measures, which can be used to evaluate the practical effectiveness of the official policies.
To demonstrate how constraining α can aid numerical analysis in the cases when A is not continuously
tracked, we next analyze five additional countries listed in the Outline section, so that altogether our
study covers majority of COVID-19 hotspots, which (at the time of this analysis) are close to saturation
in confirmed counts. Furthermore, in the specific cases of UK and Italy, where we analytically obtained
both very low and very constrained α (0.01 < α < 0.04), we chose five times larger parameter span in α
in the numerical analysis, to confirm that these low values are indeed preferred by the exhaustive numerical search. For example, the finally obtained α for Italy (0.033 ± 0.005) and UK (0.025 ± 0.005), together
with previously obtained agreements shown in Figures 2A-C, strongly confirm that the observed growth
patterns provide invaluable information for successful analysis of the infection progression data.
To further illustrate this, the synergy of analytical derivations and numerical analysis presented above
enables us to, directly from the publicly available data, infer key infection parameters necessary to assess
epidemics risks (provided in the Supplement (Table S1)). We estimate these parameters by the same
model/analysis, for a number of diverse countries, allowing their direct comparison. In Figure 3, we show
together Case Fatality Rate (CFR), Infected Fatality Rate (IFR) and infection Attack Rate (AR)[17, 24] .
CFR is the number of fatalities per confirmed cases. CFR can, in principle, be inferred directly from the
data, but since different countries are in different phases of infection, we project forward the number of
confirmed cases until a saturation is reached for each country, from which we calculate CFR. IFR (crucial parameter for assessing the risks for infection progression under different scenarios) is the number
of fatalities per total number of infected cases, which is a genuine model estimate, due to the unknown
total number of infected cases. AR (necessary for understanding the virus recurrence risk) is also determined from our model and provides an estimate of the fraction of the total population that got infected
and possibly resistant.
From Figure 3, we see that CFR takes very different values for different countries, from below 2% (New
Zealand) to above 20% (France). On the other hand, IFR is consistent with a constant value (the dashed
red line in the figure) of ∼ 0.3 − 0.4%. In distinction to IFR, AR also takes diverse values for different countries, ranging from ∼ 1% to as high as ∼ 15% (though with large errorbars). Although diverse,
these AR values are well bellow the classical herd immunity threshold of 60 − 70%[2, 25] , raising a major
risk of infection recurrence with lifting social distancing measures. This conclusion is also consistent with
independent experimental measurements, through serology tests, where low AR values are consistently
obtained[26] ; e.g. preliminary results of a large scale study in Serbia obtained AR of 6% well consistent
with our reported value (5 ± 4%). The fact that estimated AR and CFR take diverse values, while IFR
is nearly constant, implies that the obtained IFR value may present an inherent COVID-19 property.
Conclusion: We here developed a novel quantitative framework through which we showed that: i)
The emergence of three distinct growth regimes in COVID-19 case counts can be reproduced both analytically and numerically. ii) Typically, a brief superlinear regime is characterized by a sharp transition
from outburst to extinguishing the infection, where effective reproduction number changes from much
larger to much smaller than one; more effective measures lead to shorter superlinear growth, and to a
steeper change of the effective reproduction number. iii) Scaling exponent of the superlinear regime is

surprisingly uniform for countries with diverse environmental and demographic factors and epidemics
containment policies; this highly non-trivial empirical result is well reproduced by our model. iv) Scaling prefactors in the sublinear regime contain crucial information for analytically constraining infection
progression parameters, so that they can be straightforwardly extracted through numerical analysis. Interestingly, we found that the number of COVID-19 fatalities per total number of infected is highly uniform across diverse analyzed countries, in distinction to other (highly variable) infection parameters, and
about twice higher than commonly quoted for influenza (0.3-0.4% compared to 0.1-0.2%), which may be
valuable for direct assessment of the epidemics risks.
While state-of-the-art approach in epidemiological modeling uses computationally highly demanding numerical simulations, the results above demonstrate a shift of paradigm towards simpler, but analytically
tractable models, that can both explain common dynamical features of the system and be used for straightforward and highly constrained parameter inference. This shift is based on a novel framework that relates universal growth patterns with characteristic points of the infective curve, followed by analytical
derivations in the vicinity of these points, in an approach akin to those in a number of physics problems.
The framework presented here can be, in principle, further extended towards e.g. including stochastic
effects or different heterogeneities such as age-structure. However, these are non-trivial tasks, and it remains to be seen to what extent the analytical results can be obtained in those more complex models.
Overall, as our approach does not depend on any COVID-19 specifics, the developed framework can also
be readily applied to potential outbursts of future infections.
