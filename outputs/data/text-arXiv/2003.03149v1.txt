We analyse the data for the global corona virus (COVID-19) outbreak using the results of a
previously studied Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model of epidemic spreading on Euclidean
networks. We also directly study the correlation of the distance from the epicenter and the number
of cases. An inverse square law is seen to exist approximately. The studies are made for China and
the rest of the world separately.

The novel corona virus (COVID-19), which causes an
acute respiratory disease in humans, has emerged as the
latest worldwide epidemic, having already claimed a considerable number of lives, especially in China, from where
it started in late 2019 [1, 2]. The epicenter has been identified as the city of Wuhan in mainland China. Due to
drastic precautionary steps taken in China, the disease
has been contained to some extent of late, however, it
has rapidly spread over to the rest of the world (ROW
henceforth), causing serious concern. It is expected that
because of the current awareness, efficient treatment and
preventive measures in operation, the number of deaths
may be controlled soon, but long term effects on academic activities, commerce, social life, sports, tourism
etc. are anticipated.
A considerable number of analysis of the available data
of the number of cases and deaths have already been
made, and a few data driven models have also been proposed [3–16]. However, these works are mostly based on
the data from a single country/region. In this work, the
ongoing outbreak is studied using the data in [17] where
the number of total cases, number of new cases and some
other relevant information are available for China and
other parts of the world. The data are available in the
form of daily reports (starting from January 21, 2020;
the onset of the disease happened much earlier in China)
of new cases and total cases for different countries. Fig.
1 shows the number of countries affected as a function of
time (starting date January 13, 2020 for this data), the
total number at present is close to 90. We analyse some
of the data using a previously studied model for epidemic
spreading on complex networks [18].
The affliction caused by corona virus belongs to
the class of Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) disease,
where an infected person either dies or recovers, and the
disease can be contracted only once. For the newly detected cases, SIR typically shows a peak. However, real
data may show multiple peaks due to delayed spreads
and other, possibly demographic and geographic reasons.
Here also, the total number of new cases (daily) shows
a secondary growth beyond an initial peak value (see
Fig. 2 upper panel). That this is due to the later global
spread beyond China is clearly indicated when the data
for China and ROW are plotted separately in the lower
panel of Fig. 2. The number of newly infected cases
for China shows the feature of a SIR type of disease as

it shows a peak value followed by a decay, although not
very smooth.
The above observation shows that it is better to study
the data for China and the rest of the world separately,
if one uses a SIR type of model. Since the newly infected
number shows lots of fluctuations usually, it is more convenient to consider the cumulative data.
In the SIR model studied on a Euclidean network [18],
it was assumed that the disease can be transmitted to a
nearest neighbour and to some random other agent who is
connected with a probability decaying algebraically with
the Euclidean distance separating them. We attempt to
fit the cumulative data using the results obtained in [18]
which gave very nice agreement with the Ebola outbreak
in West Africa [19]. The transmission of corona virus
however, is much more probable than in Ebola in the
latter one requires more intimate body contact to get
infected.
The cumulative data R (total number of cases) for
China indeed show a saturation and are fitted to the
form obtained in [18]:
RCh = ACh exp(t/TCh )/[1 + BCh exp(t/TCh )]

(1)

such that at t → ∞, a saturation value is obtained. The
value of the fitting parameters are ACh ≈ 2000; TCh =
5.3 ± 0.27 and BCh = 0.02. It can be seen that on day
26, there is a jump in the number (probably due to nonavailability of quality data) and therefore the errors involved in fitting are not very small for ACh and BCh , but

definitely less than ∼ 20%.
The data for the rest of the world (ROW) do not show
a peak value yet for the newly infected cases indicating
that it is still in the growing stage (see Fig. 2 lower
panel). It is not unusual to find a exponential growth
initially in epidemic spreading which would also give a
exponential rise for the cumulative data. An initial exponential variation is expected from eq 1 provided the
parameter B ≪ A which was noted for Ebola [19]. However, we find that the present data are better fitted with
an exponential fit beyond t = 25, in case one attempts to
fit the entire data, the following form gives a fairly good
fit:
RROW = AROW exp(t/TROW ) + R0

(2)

with AROW ≈ 2; TROW = 4.93 ± 0.06 and R0 ≈ 122. The
data and the fittings for both China and ROW are shown
in Fig. 3.
We next study the spatial dependence of the infection
spread. The Haversine distances d (in Km) between the
places of occurrence of the disease and Wuhan are calculated and the number of cases reported at a distance
d is plotted in Fig. 4. For countries other than China,
we take the distance from their capital cities to Wuhan.
The data of China alone can be approximately fitted as

RCh (d) ∝ d−2 . However, the fit may not be appropriate
when all the data are included as the epicenters might
have shifted elsewhere. Indeed we find the data at larger
d to be more scattered. The correlation coefficient between d and the affected number is also calculated; for
China it is -0.267 while for the rest of the world is is
-0.197, agreeing with the above.
For infection to other countries, there can be two
modes of transmission: local or imported. We plot in
Fig. 5 the distances from Wuhan against the date of
the first reported cases in the countries in the rest of the
world (note that for this data, the origin of time is January 13, 2020 [17]). We note that there can be places
at nearly the same distance which got the first infection
on dates widely separated. However, in general, one can
note that the data points fall around two clusters quite
well separated in time; one dominated by infections due
to local transmission and the other consisting of imported
infections mainly, the latter occurring at later dates.
To summarise, the space time dependence of the
corona virus data show several interesting features as
of now. The cumulative data for China show reasonably good agreement with the empirical form obtained in

3
[18]. Also, the numerical values of the timescales TCh and
TROW , associated with the cumulative number of affected
persons, are found to be quite close, consistent with the
fact that the data are for the same virus. The epidemic
is still in the rising stage outside China. The most in-

triguing result is the inverse square law dependence of
the number of cases against distance from the epicenter.
This could have some connection with the gravity law in
social dynamics.
