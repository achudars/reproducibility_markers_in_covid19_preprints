Abstract
This paper presents a multivariate functional data statistical approach, for spatiotemporal prediction of COVID–19 mortality counts.
Specifically, spatial heterogeneous nonlinear parametric functional regression trend model fitting is first implemented. Classical and Bayesian
infinite–dimensional log–Gaussian linear residual correlation analysis
is then applied. The nonlinear regression predictor of the mortality
risk is combined with the plug–in predictor of the multiplicative error
term. An empirical model ranking, based on random K–fold validation, is established for COVID–19 mortality risk forecasting and assessment, involving Machine Learning (ML) models, and the adopted
Classical and Bayesian semilinear estimation approach. This empirical analysis also determines the ML models favored by the spatial
multivariate Functional Data Analysis (FDA) framework. The results
could be extrapolated to other countries.

Introduction

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID–19) rapidly spreads around many other
countries, since December 2019 when arises in China (see [44]; [51]). It has
supposed a substantial damage in terms of both human lives and economic
cost. There is no vaccine specifically designed for this virus. Thus, the absence of reliable data regarding this infectious disease transmission makes
necessary cautious responses. A crucial problem is geo-localization of outbreaks, since it allows a more effective allocation of medical resources (see,
e.g., [11]; [25]; [34]; [36], just to mention a few). Some mathematical models

1

have been introduced in the literature, trying to describe the spatiotemporal dynamics of COVID-19. To generate and assess short-term forecasts
of the cumulative number of reported cases, three models are presented in
[37], which were validated with outbreaks of other diseases different from
COVID–19. Alternative SEIR type models with little variations are formulated, involving, for instance, stochastic components (see [26]). In [19], a
θ–SEIHRD model is introduced, well adapted to COVID–19, based on the
Be-CoDiS model (see [20]). This model is able to estimate the number of
cases, deaths, and needs of beds in hospitals. The most remarkable feature
of the presented approach in [19] is the balance between complexity and
indentifiability of model parameters.
Mathematics contributes in an essential way to the derivation of epidemiological models, and the subsequent analysis of the causes, dynamics,
and spread of an epidemic/pandemic (see, e.g, [17] and [23] for an overview
on mathematical models in Epidemiology). Particularly, ordinary differential equations have been extensively applied in the characterization of the
time evolution of an infectious disease over uniform population distributions
within a habitat. Most of those models are compartment epidemic models,
such as the SIR (susceptible-infectious-recovered) model. The SIR model
was first proposed in [24] to explain plague and cholera epidemics. It was
later extended to the SIR-susceptible (SIRS) model to allow imperfect immunity (see, e.g., [12]). Indeed, there exists an extensive literature on SIR
models, based on ordinary differential equations (see, e.g. [13]; [21]; [27];
[35]; [41]; [45]; [49]). Delay differential equations have also been applied in
the SIR modeling context (see [5]; [31]; [40], among others). These models
are limited, since any structure due to the spatial position is not reflected.
Reaction-diffusion models provide a framework for their spatial extension,
reflecting the infectious disease spread over a spatial region. Thus, they provide a simplest modeling alternative in Ecology and Epidemiology involving
space and time. A diffusive predator-prey model is analyzed in [15]. A one
dimensional SIR model, including constant diffusive movement of all individuals is derived in [47] with no-flux boundary conditions. SIR modeling based
on hyperbolic partial differential equations is studied in [32], and, based on
parabolic partial differential equation systems with no-flux boundary conditions in [28]. See also [39] and [38] on SEIRD (susceptible, exposed, infected,
recovered, deceased) model, that incorporates the spatial spread of the disease with inhomogeneous diffusion terms.
The stochastic version of SIR–type models intends to cover several limitations detected regarding uncertainly, in the observations, and the hidden
dynamical epidemic process. Specifically, the counts compartments are observed with error, and several factors introduce uncertainly in the hidden
2

epidemic process, such as the presence of heterogeneous populations. The
transmission, recovery and loss of immunity rate parameters, for example, are
uncertain themselves. In a first stage, a probabilistic mechanism is adopted
involving a Markov chain of SIR states (see [4]; [48]). Some more recent
stochastic models involve complex networks (see [50]; [43]) or drug–resistant
influenza (see [10]). As pointed out in [52] (see references therein), these
models do not take into account the observation error in the counts, and
obtain mass balance equation from the observed counts. The uncertainty in
the parameter space is neither accounted for. The approach presented in [52]
covers these gaps, adopting a Bayesian hierarchical statistical SIRS model
framework. Specifically, the stochastic SIR–like model fitting is performed,
assuming that the counts are observed with error and the dynamical evolution of the SIR process is stochastic. Parameter uncertainty is also modelled
under this Bayesian statistical framework (see also [2]).
Many alternative models have been proposed to address the problem of
uncertainly in the counts and the parameters, in the spatiotemporal statistical and Cox process context (see, e.g., [1]; [4]; [14], among others). Some
of them go beyond the SIR modeling framework (see, e.g., [7] or [22], where
the problem of correlation of rates of change between neighbouring sites or
individuals is addressed). Survival Dynamical System are proposed in [46],
paying attention to survival functions instead of population counts. We particularly refer to the approach presented in [33], where a spatially descriptive,
temporally dynamic hierarchical model is formulated, to handle inference
from small–area counts on the number of infected during successive, regular
time intervals. The realizations of an underlying multivariate autoregressive
process are involved in the infection relative risk modeling, incorporating the
space-time dynamics, and providing an epidemic–field–based view. Markov
chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) in a Bayesian statistical framework is applied
to compute the posterior estimates of all parameters of interest.
Our paper extends some of the tools applied in [33] to the nonlinear trend
model fitting, and infinite–dimensional statistical frameworks. The prediction approach presented involves nonlinear parametric functional regression,
and spatial multivariate functional linear residual correlation analysis. It is
well–known that Functional Data Analysis (FDA) techniques allow to make
inference on the small-scale and large–scale sample properties, in our case, of
the hidden stochastic mortality risk process generating the spatiotemporal
counts (see, e.g., [42]). Note that the classical stochastic diffusion models
offer a particle view rather than a field view (see, e.g., [30]). Thus, we incorporate large– and small–scale sample information in our statistical analysis
framework. The first stage involves nonlinear parametric curve regression,
from the observed realizations of the COVID–19 mortality log–risk process,
3

at each one of the Spanish Communities. The second step performs a spatial multivariate functional linear residual correlation analysis. Thus, the
resulting semi–linear additive plug–in predictor approximates the behavior
of the COVID–19 mortality log–risk process in space and time. Bayesian and
Classical approaches are adopted in the implementation of the second step.
Hence, our approach includes uncertainly in the observed counts, parameters
and hidden COVID–19 mortality log–risk process. The presented estimation
methodology is validated from the observed number of deaths registered at
the Spanish Communities, during the period analyzed, since March, 8, 2020
until May, 13, 2020. Our results show a remarkable qualitative agreement
with the reported epidemiological data.
Nowadays Machine learning models have established themselves as serious
contenders to classical statistical models in the area of forecasting. Research
started in the eighties with the development of the neural network model.
Subsequently, research extended the concept to alternative models, such as
support vector machines, decision trees, and others, that are collectively
called machine learning models ([3]; [16]). This paper also aims to establish
an empirical comparative study of these models and our approach. Applying
random K–fold validation, the forecasting ability of ML models are tested
into two categories, respectively corresponding to the original and projected
functional data. A model ranking is established in both cases. In the second category, they are compared with our multivariate infinite–dimensional
Bayesian and Classical semilinear approaches. From the COVID–19 mortality data set analyzed, the outperformance of Radial Basis Function Neural
Network (RBF), and Gaussian Processes (GP) against the remaining forecasting models tested: Support Vector Regression (SVR), Bayesian Neural
Networks (BNN), Classical and Bayesian multivariate infinite–dimensional
semilinear estimation, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Generalized Regression
Neural Network (GRNN) is observed. Note that, the best K–fold running for
these superior RBF and GP methods is obtained under an FDA preprocessing of the data. Our approach presents a more stable and robust behavior
against the possible random splitting of the functional sample into training,
and validation or testing samples.
The outline of the paper is the following. The adopted modeling approach is introduced in Section 2. Section 3 derives the estimation methodology. This methodology is applied to the spatiotemporal statistical analysis
of COVID–19 mortality in Spain in Section 4. The empirical comparative
study with ML models is addressed in Section 5. An empirical model ranking
is provided in Section 6 leading to some concluding remarks. In the Appendix
additional outputs, obtained in our spatiotemporal estimation of COVID–19
mortality and risk assessment in Spain, are displayed. Finally, this Appendix
4

also provides a brief introduction to our implementation of ML models in an
FDA framework.

The Model

Let (Ω, A, P) be the basic probability space. Consider H to be a real separable Hilbert space, with H ? denoting its dual. Let Λ = {Λt,z , z ∈ D ⊂
Rd , t ∈ R+ , } be a spatiotemporal risk process on (Ω, A, P) such that

Process Λ is assumed to satisfy E [k ln (Λt (·)) k2H ] < ∞, with Λt (z) = Λt,z ,
for every z ∈ D and t ∈ R+ . Here,

defines a temporal realization of the generalized risk process evaluated at the
test function h ∈ H. Note that, the weighted integration of the realizations
of the log–risk process, in terms of test function h ∈ H, keeps the spatial
information on this process. For certain families of compactly supported test
functions, the local mean defined by this integral allows the localization of
the values of the spatiotemporal risk process over a specific spatial region.
For any bounded Borel set T , let N (T ) : (Ω, A, P) −→ N be a measurable mapping, with values in the natural numbers N. Given the observation
of IT (h), the conditional probability distribution of the number of random
events N (T ), that occur in the bounded interval T ∈ B, is a Poisson probability distribution with functional mean IT (h), h ∈ H. Thus, its conditional
characteristic function is given by
fN (T )/IT (h) (ξ) = E [exp (iξN (T )) /IT (h)]
= exp (IT (h) (exp(iξ) − 1)) ,

Data Model

Let us consider the following observation model for the generalized log–risk
process: For t = 1, . . . , T,
ln (Λt ) (ψp,$p ) = gt (ψp,$p , θ(p)) + εt (ψp,$p )
= gt (·, θ(p)), ψp,$p (·) H + εt (·), ψp,$p (·)

where {ψp,$p , p = 1, . . . , P } ⊂ H denotes a function family in H, whose
elements have compact support defining the small–areas, where the counts
are aggregated. Here, $p , p = 1, . . . , P, are the localization hyperparameters
(in the next section, the center and bandwidth parameters), associated with
those small–areas. For each p ∈ {1, . . . , P }, θ(p) = (θ1 (p), . . . , θq (p)) ∈ Θ
denotes the unknown parameter vector to be estimated at the pth region, and
Θ is the open set defining the parameter space, whose closure Θc is compact
in Rq . The parametric regression function gt is continuous over θ(·) ∈ Θ, and
t ∈ R+ , with respect to H–norm. Furthermore, we assume that gt is of the
form
gt (θ(·)) =

In equation (3), for any T ≥ 2, εt is assumed to be a temporal dynamical
zero–mean process that satisfies the state equation
εt = ρ(εt−1 ) + νt ,

t = 1, . . . , T,

where {νt , t = 1, . . . , T } are independent H–valued zero–mean Gaussian
random variables, with E [kνt k2H ] = E [kν0 k2H ] < ∞, and P [νt ∈ H] = 1,
t = 1, . . . , T. The autocorrelation operator ρ is bounded linear operator.
Thus, the observation noise εt obeys an Autoregressive Hilbertian equation
of order one (ARH(1) equation), which admits an unique stationary solution

under the condition kρkkL(H)
< 1, for certain k0 ∈ N (see, e.g., [8]). Here,
k · kL(H) denotes the bounded linear operator norm in H.

Trend Model Fitting and Residual Correlation Analysis

Let L1 , . . . , LP be the small-areas, where the counts are aggregated. Consider
{ψp,ρp , p = 1, . . . , P } ⊂ H to be a family of compactly supported radial
functions in H, whose centers cp , p = 1, . . . , P, are allocated at the regions

Statistical Analysis of COVID–19 Mortality in Spain

The COVID–19 mortality analysis performed here is based on the daily
records reported by the Spanish Statistical National Institute, since March, 8
to May, 13, 2020, at the 17 Spanish Communities. Interpolation at 265 temporal nodes, and cubic B-spline smoothing is applied to obtain our functional
data set, in the implementation of the spatial heterogeneous nonlinear parametric curve regression model (3)–(4) (see Figures 9 and 10 in Appendix).
The spatiotemporal correlation structure of COVID–19 mortality residual
log–risk process is estimated from equations (11) and (15). Thus, from (17),

following Spanish Community codes have been considered: C1 for Andalucı́a;

Galicia; C13 for Comunidad de Madrid; C14 for Murcia; C15 for Navarra;
C16 for Pas Vasco, and C17 for La Rioja.
In equation (14), for the computation of the Bayesian estimator (15) of
the autocorrelation operator ρ, the prior γk (ρ) ∼ β(4, 5) has been tested,
for every k ≥ 1. Note that, although, K(T ) = [ln(T )]− = [ln(265)]− =
[5.57973]− = 5 is usually considered, we have also tested the truncation
parameter values N = 8 and N = 9. Table 1 displays the discrete approximation of k · kL2 ([0,66]) –norm, multiplied by the scale factor S = 102 , of
the empirical functional quadratic errors associated with these three truncation parameter values. We find that the sample size T = 265 leads to the
threshold dimension K(265) = 9, providing the allowed model complexity, in
our finite–dimensional implementation of the COVID–19 mortality log–risk
predictor, under both, Bayesian and Classical approaches.
Figures 1 and 2 respectively show the maps reflecting the original and estimated spatiotemporal evolution of COVID–19 mortality risk, and accumulated mortality counts, under the presented Bayesian and Classical semilinear
estimation approaches, over the 17 Spanish Communities analyzed.

implemented from the records reported by the Spanish Statistical National
Institute, since March, 8 to May, 13, 2020. The empirical ranking is referred
to two categories, where we respectively perform forecasts from the observed
pointwise, and from the generalized (projected) COVID–19 mortality log–
risk process realizations. In the first category the ML models: Multilayer
Perceptron (MLP), Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBF), Bayesian
Neural Network (BNN), Generalized Regression Neural Network (GRNN),
Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Gaussian Processes (GP) are compared. In the second category, the performance of the presented approach is
compared with these ML methodologies.
A brief introduction to the ML methodologies, here implemented in a
classical and FDA frameworks, is provided in Appendix.

Results from the Empirical Comparative Study

We start from the functional data set obtained after the FDA preprocessing
procedure has been applied, as described in the previous section. Specifically, data have been interpolated and cubic B-spline smoothed. The logarithmic transform and linear scaling are also applied. We held out the first
ten points and the last three, for each log–risk curve, as an out of sample
set. In the first category, ML models are implemented from this data set,
establishing a first model ranking based on the obtained validation results.
In the second category, COVID–19 mortality log–risk curves are projected
onto the empirical eigenvectors of the autocovariance operator, considering
the truncation parameter value K(T ) = 8. Our choice of the truncation parameter K(T ) = K(265) = 8 fits the threshold providing a balance between
K(T ) = [ln(T )]− = [ln(265)]− = 5, signing an agreement with the separation and velocity decay of the empirical eigenvalues of the autocovariance
operator, and the parameter value K(T ) = K(265) = 9, controlling model
complexity according to the sample size T = 265. Based on the validation
results obtained in this category, a second model ranking is established involving the ML models tested and the approach presented. The derived

(first line) and classical (second line) COVID–19 mortality count predictors,

empirical model ranking is not affected by these two categories. However, it
can be observed how each ML model performance is favored by one of the
two categories (see Section 6). For instance, linear SVR is the best option for
the first category, while better forecasting results are obtained when nonlinear SVR is implemented from the projected data. As we will see in Section
6, the particular features of the data at each one of the 17 Spanish Communities analyzed also affect the performance of the implemented prediction
methodologies.
One-step-ahead forecasting is selected in the implementation of the ML
methodologies, and the proposed Classical and Bayesian semilinear approaches.

The most widely used methodology for model selection in ML is K–fold
validation approach. In our case, we have applied random K–fold validation.
We have computed the mean of the SMAPEs obtained at each one of the
13

K iterations of the random K–fold cross validation procedure implemented.
This validation technique consists of random splitting the functional sample
into a training and validation sample at each one of the K iterations. Model
fitting is performed from the training sample, and the target outputs are
defined from the validation or testing sample. In particular, we have selected
K = 5, 10, in the K–fold validation implemented. By running each model
ten times and averaging SMAPEs, we remove the fluctuations due to the
random initial weights (for MLP and BNN models), and the differences in
the parameter estimation in all methods, due to the random specification of
the sample splitting in the implementation of the random K–fold validation
procedure.
The ten–running based random K–fold validation SMAPEs are displayed
in Tables 2 (K = 5) and Table 3 (K = 10), for the six ML techniques tested,
GRNN, MLP, SVR, BNN, RBF, and GP, from data in the first category. The
ML model estimation results, based on the complete functional sample, are
also displayed in Table 11 in Appendix (see also Figures 3 and 4). In Table 12
in Appendix, one can also find the corresponding estimation results from the
projected data. (Note that, the same Spanish Community codes, as before,
are used in all the tables referred in this section, that is, C1 for Andalucı́a;
C2 for Aragón; C3 for Asturias; C4 for Islas Baleares; C5 for Canarias; C6
for Cantabria; C7 for Castilla La Mancha; C8 for Castilla y León; C9 for
Cataluña; C10 for Comunidad Valenciana; C11 for Extremadura; C12 for
Galicia; C13 for Comunidad de Madrid; C14 for Murcia; C15 for Navarra;
C16 for Pas Vasco, and C17 for La Rioja).
Tables 4 (K = 5) and Table 5 (K = 10) provide the ten–running based
random K–fold validation results, from the projected data category. The random K–fold validation results obtained after implementation of the Bayesian
and Classical semilinear approaches, as well as the estimation results based
on the global sample are displayed in Table 6. See also Figures 5 and 6,
where original and estimated COVID–19 mortality log–risk and cumulative
cases curves are respectively shown.
In the previous selection of ML model hyperparameters, we have also applied random K–fold validation (K = 5, 10). Our selection has been made
from a suitable set of candidates. Specifically, the optimal numbers of hidden (NH) nodes in the implementation of MLP and BNN have been selected
from the candidate sets = [0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9] and [1, 3, 5, 7, 9], respectively. The
cross–validation results in both cases, K = 5, 10, lead to the same choice
of the NH optimal value. Namely, NH= 1 for MLP, and NH= 5 for BNN.
The last one displays slight differences with respect to the values NH= 3, 7,
in the 10–fold cross–validation implementation. In the same way, we have
selected the spread and bandwidth parameters in the RBF and GRNN pro14

cedures. Thus, after applying random K–fold validation, with K = 5, 10,
the optimal values β = 2.5, and h = 0.05 are obtained, from the candidate sets [2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, 12.5, 15, 17.5, 20] and [0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7],
respectively. As commented, in the first category, the best SVR performance
corresponds to the linear case, finding the hyperparameters that minimize
the five–fold cross–validation loss (by using automatic hyperparameter optimization from fitrsvm MatLab function). While, from the projected data
category, the best option corresponds to the Gaussian kernel based nonlinear
SVR model fitting (applying the same option of automatic hyperparameter
optimization, in the argument of fitrsvm MatLab function). In the implementation of GP we follow the same tuning procedure for model selection. In this
case, for both categories, we have opted by Bayesian cross-validation optimization (in the hyperparameter optimization argument of the fitrgp MatLab
function).
In all the results displayed, the SMAPE–MEAN (M.) and SMAPE–
TOTAL (T.) have been computed as rank-based performance measures, for
comparing the ML models tested, and the presented Classical and Bayesian
semilinear estimation approaches.

Concluding Remarks

Model empirical selection results hold in a broad–based sense, as displayed
in Section 5.1. Specifically, these results have been tested for K = 5 and
K = 10 in the random K–fold validation, leading to almost the same model
ranking in the two categories. See Table 7 and Figure 7 for the first category, and Table 8 and Figure 8 for the second category. (In Table 8 and
Figure 8, C–ARH(1) and B–ARH(1) respectively denote the Classical and
Bayesian semilinear estimation). The random K–fold validation results displayed for the presented Classical and Bayesian semilinear approaches locate
these methodologies after SVR model. Thus, the fifth and sixth positions
are respectively occupied in that empirical ranking. In the first category,
RBF and GP are almost equal, while in the second category slightly larger
differences can be observed. On the other hand, the projected data category
favors the GRNN, RBF and GP performance, while better results are ob16

tained from the original data in the implementation of MLP, SVR and BNN.
Note that, the best models in the above rankings, RBF and GP, display a
better performance in the second category. Thus, we can conclude that the
FDA preprocessing produces a remarkable improvement, even in the communities, like, Navarra and Galicia, where the worst results are obtained with all
the ML models tested. Particularly, this improvement is more significative
at Murcia Community. In that sense, one can also observe that the spatial
component of the data also affects the performance of the ML models tested
through the two categories distinguished (e.g., the best performance overall
ML models tested is obtained at Islas Baleares, Castilla–León and La Rioja,
and the worst at Navarra and Galicia). Remark also the outperformance of
the Classical and Bayesian semilinear approaches at the Islas Baleares and
Murcia Communities.
Note also that, the rank-based performance measure applied only refers to
estimation accuracy, and other features of the probability distribution of the

estimators have not been investigated yet. Indeed, the presented approach
offers more stable, and robust estimations against the random selection of the
training and validation samples. Thus, an improved model ranking position
could be occupied by our approach if variability in that sense is penalized.
Another subject to be addressed in a near future is the optimal selection of
the test functions {ψp,ρp , p = 1, . . . , P } involved in the formulation of the
generalized least-squares loss function (7), and in the COVID–19 mortality
risk assessment from equation (17). Our final goal would be to obtain an
optimal design, from a set of candidates, of the test function family, providing the spatial sample information required, for spatiotemporal ML, and
Classical and Bayesian semilinear forecasting, in a multivariate functional
data framework (see, e.g., [6] regarding optimal selection of time intervals,
or, instants, in the implementation of SVR from a multivariate functional
data set).

For the loss function defined in terms of the squared error, the Bayes

PT of 2λ

In practice, in the computation of equations (22) and (24), when the
eigenvectors {φk,ν , k ≥ 1} are unknown, one can consider their consistent
approximation in terms of the empirical eigenvectors {φk,T,ν , k ≥ 1}, under the conditions assumed in Corollary 4.1, Lemma 4.3, and Theorem 4.8
in [8]. Indeed, under the conditions in Theorem 1 of [18], and the referred setting of conditions in [8], for each k ≥ 1, Yt (φk,ν ) − ρb(Yt−1 )(φk,ν )
and Yt (φk,T,ν ) − ρb(Yt−1 )(φk,T,ν ), consistently approximate xtk = νt (φk,ν ), for
t = 1, . . . , T, in the computation of equations (21) and (23), for the cases
where the eigenvectors {φk,ν , k ≥ 1} are known and unknown, respectively.
25

Note also that, under the conditions assumed in [9], in particular, when,
k
≤ λk (R0ν ), we obtain the following equivalent
for every k ≥ 1, 2(gk β−1)+1

τk ∼ Γ (gk , βk ) with gk = 6, and βk = (2gk − 1)λK(T ),T R0,T /10 for each

Figure 10: Observed COVID–19 mortality risk curves at the 17 Spanish
Autonomous Communities, since March, 8 to May, 13, 2020

The least–squares parameter estimates computed in the spatial heterogeneous nonlinear parametric trend model fitting are shown in Tables 9–10.
Finally, the COVID–19 mortality log–risk estimations, based on spatial
heterogeneous linear and nonlinear trend model fitting, are compared in Figure 11, under a Classical (C) and Bayesina (B) approximation of the functional residuals, considering the truncation parameter value K(265) = 9.

practice, the theoretical eigenvectors are usually replaced by the empirical
eigenvectors. Parameter p + 1 provides the number of temporal lags incorporated in the prediction. In our case, since we have considered one-step-ahead
forecasting, p = 1, the response

Figure 11: Observed and estimated COVID–19 mortality log–risk curves, at
the 17 Spanish Communities, since March, 8 to May, 13, 2020, under a spatial
heterogeneous linear and nonlinear trend model fitting, applying a classical
(C) and Bayesian (B) componentwise estimation of the residual correlation,
under the truncation parameter value K(T ) = 9
Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBF)
RBF works with node functions, depending on a center and scale parameters,
fitting the local smoothness of the response. Specifically, from an initial
blank network, the nodes are sequentially added, around the training pattern,
until an acceptable error is reached. All the output layer weights are then
recomputed using the least squares formula. Gaussian functions have been
widely selected as node functions. Equation (27) defines the input vector in
our implementation of RFB in an infinite–dimensional setting given by the
formula


NH
X
kx − cj k2H
,
(29)
y=
ηj exp
ρ2
j=1
where, as usual, the weight parameters ηj , j = 1, . . . , N H, define the linear
combination of radial basis functions. Here, the scale parameter ρ, and the
functional location parameters cj ∈ H, j = 1, . . . , N H, respectively provide
the width, and the functional center of the node functions. In practice,
a K(T )–dimensional implementation is considered based on the truncation
parameter K(T ), as given in (27).
30

Support Vector Regression (SVR)
SVR implementation involves a loss function leading to a balance between
model complexity and precision (accurate prediction). A bias parameter b is
also considered in its formulation as reflected in the following equation:
y = f (x) = β T x + b,

(30)

M
X
1
2
L = kβk + C
|ym − f (xm )| ,
2
m=1

(31)

where the loss function

is considered. Here, xm and ym respectively denote the mth training input
vector and the target output, for m = 1, . . . , M, and
|ym − f (xm )| = max {0, |ym − f (xm )| − } .
Thus, the errors below  are not penalized. The solution to the optimization
problem associated with the loss function (31) is given by
?
f (x) = (αm
− αm )xT x + b,

(32)

?
where αm
and αm are Lagrange multipliers. The support vectors are the
training vectors giving nonzero Lagrange multipliers. A nonlinear version is
obtained when the inner product xT x in (32) is replaced by K(xT x), with K
being a kernel. A usual kernel choice is the Gaussian kernel.
In our implementation of this methodology in an FDA framework from
equations (26)–(27), we will consider

f (x) = hβ, xiH + b,
T

β, b, x ∈ H,
K(T )

XX

|ln (λt+1 ) (φl ) − f (ln (λt ) (φl ))|l ,
L = kβk2H + C
2
t=1 l=1

(33)

where T denotes, as before, the number of temporal nodes, and for l ≥ 1,
|ln (λt+1 ) (φl ) − f (ln (λt ) (φl ))|l
= max {0, |ln (λt+1 ) (φl ) − f (ln (λt ) (φl ))| − l } .

(34)

Bayesian Neural Network (BNN)
The design of BNN involves Bayesian estimation, and the concept of regularization. The network parameters or weights are considered random variables,
31

following a prior probability distribution. Smooth fits are usually favored in
the selection of the prior probability of the weights to reduce model complexity. The posterior probability distribution of the weights is obtained after
data are observed. The network prediction is then computed. Specifically,
the optimal prediction is obtained by minimizing the following expression:
J = νEO + (1 − ν)EW ,

(35)

where EO is the sum of the square errors in the network output, based
on the posterior distribution of the parameters, EW represents the sum of
the squares of the weights or the network parameters, and ν ∈ (0, 1) denotes the regularization parameter. Let L be the number of parameters. An
L–dimensional Gaussian prior probability distribution is usually assumed
for the network parameters with zero–mean and variance–covariance matrix
1
I
, with IL×L denoting the L × L identity matrix. Thus,
2(1−ν) L×L


1−ν
p(w) =
π

L/2
exp (−(1 − ν)EW (w)) .

(36)

This prior puts more weight onto small network parameter values close to
zero. The posterior probability density, given the observed data O = o, and
the value ν of the regularization parameter, is defined as
p(w/o, ν) =

p(o/w, ν)p(w/ν)
.
p(o/ν)

(37)

Considering that the errors are also Gaussian distributed the conditional
probability of the data O given the parameters ν and w, is obtained as
 ν M/2
p(o/w, ν) =
exp (−νEO (o)) ,
(38)
π
where M denotes the number of training data points. From equations (36)–
(38),
p(w/o, ν) = c exp (−J(w, o, ν)) ,
(39)
where c denotes the normalizing constant. The conditional probability of
the parameter ν given de observed data O = o is also computed under a
Bayesian framework as
p(ν/o) =

P (o/ν)p(ν)
.
p(o)

(40)

Equations (39) and (40) are maximized to obtain the optimal weights and
the regularization parameter ν, respectively.
32

In our FDA implementation from (26)–(27), the corresponding optimization problem is formulated by conditioning to the projected data. Note that,
in the selected Gaussian prior probability framework, the error projections
are also Gaussian, and our choice of the function basis, diagonalizing the
empirical autocovariance operator of the errors, leads to a projected error
vector with independent Gaussian components, which is also normalized, in
terms of the empirical eigenvalues as described in the preprocessing procedure in Section 5.1. Hence, optimization from equations (39) and (40) can
be implemented in a similar way.
Generalized Regression Neural Network (GRNN)
GRNN is based on kernel regression. The kernel estimator is computed from
the weighted sum of the observed responses, or target outputs associated
with the training data points in a neighborhood of the objective data point x,
where prediction must be computed. The training data points are selected in
the vicinity of the given objective point x. Specifically, the following formula
is applied in the approximation of the response value at the point x :


kx−xj k
M
K
X
h

 yj ,
(41)
yb(x) =
PM
kx−xj k
K
j=1
l=1
h
where yj is the target output for training data point xj , for j = 1, . . . , M, and
K is the kernel function. Usually an isotropic rapidly decreasing kernel
func√
2
tion is considered, e.g., the Gaussian kernel K(u) = exp (−u /2) / 2π constitutes a common choice. The bandwidth parameter h defines the smoothness
of the fit. Thus, h controls the size of the smoothing region. Hence, large values of h correspond to a stronger smoothing than the smallest values allowing
a larger degree of local variation. Our FDA formulation, from (26)–(27), follows straightforward by considering the H–norm k · kH in (41), instead of the
Euclidean norm k · k.
Gaussian Processes (GP)
A good performance is usually observed in the implementation of GP regression, based on the multivariate normal probability distribution assumption,
characterizing the observed responses at the different training data points.
Specifically, we consider the observation model
Y = Z + ,

33

(42)

where the additive noise vector  has independent components. A multivariate normal distribution of the random vector Z ∼ N (0, Σ), with covariance
matrix ΣZ is assumed. This matrix provides the variances and covariances
between the output vector components in the training set. Applying Bayes
rule we obtain the solution to the inverse problem (42). Thus, the estimation
of Z, for a given input vector x? , is obtained as


b x? = E [Z/Y = x? ] = ΣY,Z ΣZ + σ 2 I −1 Y.
Z
(43)

Here, we consider an alternative multivariate FDA interpretation, in
terms of a training test function set (instead of a training data point set,
based on temporal nodes). Hence, ΣZ is replaced by the matrix autocovariance operator RZ of the output, and ΣY,Z is replaced by the matrix
cross-covariance operator RY,Z , both evaluated at the training test function
set. In this case, σ2 denotes the functional variance or trace of the autocovariance operator, characterizing the Gaussian infinite–dimensional distribution
of the H–valued independent components of the zero–mean observation noise
vector . Hence, the identity matrix I is replaced by the identity operator
IHP on HP , with P denoting the number of training test functions. That is,
h
i


b? = E Z
b ? /Y = x? = RY,Z RZ + σ 2 IHP −1 Y.
