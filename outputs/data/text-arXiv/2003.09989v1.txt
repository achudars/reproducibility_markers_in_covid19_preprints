ABSTRACT
We investigate the overlap of topics of online news articles
from a variety of sources. To do this, we provide a platform
for studying the news by measuring this overlap and scoring
news stories according to the degree of attention in near-real
time. This can enable multiple studies, including identifying
topics that receive the most attention from news organizations and identifying slow news days versus major news
days. Our application, StoryGraph, periodically (10-minute
intervals) extracts the first five news articles from the RSS
feeds of 17 US news media organizations across the partisanship spectrum (left, center, and right). From these articles,
StoryGraph extracts named entities (PEOPLE, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, etc.) and then represents each news article
with its set of extracted named entities. Finally, StoryGraph
generates a news similarity graph where the nodes represent
news articles, and an edge between a pair of nodes represents
a high degree of similarity between the nodes (similar news
stories). Each news story within the news similarity graph
is assigned an attention score which quantifies the amount
of attention the topics in the news story receive collectively
from the news media organizations. The StoryGraph service
has been running since August 2017, and using this method,
we determined that the top news story of 2018 was the Kavanaugh hearings with attention score of 25.85 on September
27, 2018. Similarly, the top news story for 2019 so far (201912-12) is AG William Barr’s release of his principal conclusions
of the Mueller Report, with an attention score of 22.93 on
March 24, 2019.

INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND

It is natural to ask “what were the top news stories of 2019?”
A partisanship study might ask, “how often do news stories from different partisan media organizations overlap?” A
retrospective study might ask, “when did Hurricane Harvey
begin to receive serious coverage?”, or “how did the attention
given to Hurricane Harvey by the media differ from hurricanes that occurred in similar timeframes (but different locations) such as Irma or Maria?” Addressing these questions

requires the fundamental operation of measuring overlap, or
similarity, of news topics across different news sources.
We developed a method of measuring the similarity among
news articles in near-real time and quantifying the level of
attention the topics in the news stories receive. Specifically,
we created a service called StoryGraph1 that creates a news
similarity graph from 17 left, center, and right news media
organizations. StoryGraph quantifies the level of attention
the topics in the news stories receive by assigning each an attention score. Major breaking news stories are often reported
by multiple different news organization within the same time
period. Similarly, a major news story is characterized by a
high degree of similarity between different pairs of news
stories from different news organizations. For example, below is a list of headlines showing a high degree of similarity
among news reports collected on October 24, 2018, at 5:34
PM EST from four news organizations, following the incident in which mail bombs were sent to multiple Democratic
public figures.
• Vox: Explosive devices sent to Clintons, Obamas, CNN:
what we know [12]
• FoxNews: FBI IDs 7 ‘suspicious packages’ sent to Dem
figures containing ‘potentially destructive devices’ [10]
• CNN: Bombs and packages will be sent to FBI lab for
analysis [11]
• Breitbart: Live Updates: Democratic Leaders Receive
Mail Bombs [9]
The prerequisite for deriving the attention score is calculating the similarity between documents (e.g., news articles).
This problem has been studied extensively. Methods that represent documents as vectors [7, 8, 15] often use the Cosine
Similarity vector-based metric to quantify similarity between
pairs of documents. Methods that represent documents as
sets [23, 24] often use set-based metrics such as the Jaccard
similarity or the Overlap coefficient metric to quantify the
similarity between a pair of documents. In this work, we
represent each news article as a set of named entities, and
utilize a set similarity measure (Section 2, Step 4) to quantify
the degree of similarity between a pair of news documents.

Our investigation into measuring near-real time news
similarity and quantifying the attention of news sources has
resulted in the following contributions. First, we proposed
the attention score, a transparent method for quantifying
attention given to a news story by different news sources.
The attention score facilitates finding the top news stories
for a given day, month, or year. This enabled us to show the
top stories of 2018 and 2019 (Table 3). Second, we introduced
the StoryGraph service, which has been running for over
two years (since August 8, 2017), generating news similarity
graphs every 10 minutes from 17 news organizations across
the left, center, and right partisanship spectrum. Third, we
showed that the StoryGraph service and dataset provides a
platform for multiple longitudinal studies (Section 3). The
code for StoryGraph is publicly available [3, 4], and the entire
StoryGraph dataset are available upon request.

METHODOLOGY

The StoryGraph process has four steps (Fig. 1) outlined below.
First, StoryGraph collects the first five news articles from
the RSS feeds of 17 news media organizations (Table 1). Second, StoryGraph dereferences the URLs of the news articles
and extracts plaintext after removing the HTML boilerplate
[1]. Third, StoryGraph utilizes the Stanford CoreNLP Named
Entity Recognizer [5, 14] to extract seven entity classes –
PERSONS, LOCATIONS, ORGANIZATIONS, DATES, TIME, MONEY,

and PERCENT from the news documents. In addition to these
entity classes, we created and extracted text that belong to
two additional classes: TITLE and TOP-K-TERM. The TITLE
class represents title terms from the news articles, while the
TOP-K-TERM class represents the top k (we set k = 10) most
frequent terms. All text that does not belong to one of the
entity classes is discarded. Subsequently, each news article
is represented as a set of entities extracted from the article.
Fourth, StoryGraph creates a graph where the nodes (set of
entities) represent news articles, and an edge between a pair
of nodes represents a similarity score beyond some threshold
between the nodes (similar news stories). Finally, the attention scores of the connected components of the recently
generated graph is calculated. Formally, consider a news similarity graph G in which the nodes represent news articles,
and an edge between a pair of nodes represents a high degree
of similarity (Section 2, Step 4) between the nodes (similar
news stories). Consider the set of G’s connected components
C, such that ∀c i ∈ C, the nodes (news articles) in c i originate
from multiple news sources. The attention score (Eqn. 1)
of a news story represented by a connected component Ci
with |E| edges is simply the average degree of the connected
component.

Step 1: News article extraction
StoryGraph extracts the URLs of the first five news articles
from each of the 17 RSS feeds (Table 1). Next it dereferences
each URL yielding 85 HTML documents.
Step 2: Plaintext extraction
The HTML boilerplates from the 85 documents from Step 1
are removed [1], yielding 85 plaintext documents.
Step 3: Named entities extraction
The 85 plaintext documents from Step 2 are passed into the
Stanford CoreNLP Named Entity Recognizer [5, 14], yielding
85 different sets of named entities.
Step 4: News similarity graph generation
Given a pair of news articles represented by their respective set of named entities A and B, the weighted JaccardOverlap similarity sim(A, B) is given by Eqn. 2, where β is
the coefficient of similarity, defining the threshold two documents must reach to be considered similar (sim(A, B) = 1).
This threshold was empirically derived from a gold-standard
dataset and set to β = 0.27 and α = 0.30. An edge is formed
between nodes for which sim(A, B) = 1. Table 2 illustrates a

StoryGraph has been running since August 8, 2017, generating a news similarity graph once every 10 minutes. Since
then, the application has generated 120,663+ graphs. For a
given day, the connected component with the highest average degree (attention score) from 144 candidate graphs
maps to the top news story of the day. Similarly, for a given
month, the connected component with the highest attention

score maps to the top news story for the month. And for
a given year, the top k news stories is derived by finding
k connected components with the highest attention scores.
Specifically, the top k (e.g., k = 10) news stories is the first k
connected components from the sorted (in descending order
by attention score) list of all news similarity graphs.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

We can now quantify “slow news days” vs. major news, as
well as show that the Mueller report was 2019’s top story.
Slow news day vs. Major news
Fig. 2 illustrates how the attention score (average degree) of
the connected components in a news similarity graph helps
characterize different news cycle scenarios. All news graphs
in this section refer to Fig. 2. Most of the nodes (news articles)

Figure 2: Three News Similarity (NS) graphs illustrating the dynamics of the news cycle. In these graphs, a single node represents a news article, a connected component (multiple connected nodes) represents a single news story reported by the
connected nodes. The first (NS Graph 1 [18]) shows what is often referred to as a slow news day; low overlap across different
news media organizations resulting in a low attention score (1.0) for news stories (connected components A and B). The second
graph (NS Graph 2 [17]) shows a scenario where the attention of the media is split across four different news stories (connected
components A – D). The third graph (NS Graph 3 [16]) for the AG William Barr’s release of his principal conclusions of the
Mueller Report story shows a major news event; high degree of overlap/connectivity across different news media organizations,
resulting in a high attention score of 22.93

Figure 5: StoryGraph: Top three news stories of 2019

in NS Graph 1 are isolated with few connected components;
the news sources mostly report on divergent topics. Consequently, no single news story (e.g., connected component A
or B) receives attention from more than two different news
sources.
The second news similarity graph (NS Graph 2), unlike
the first, shows attention split among four primary news
stories. The attention score of each news story represented
by the connected component indicates the magnitude of
attention given to the news story. For example, connected
component A (attention score = 6.13) represents the story
Poll: Pete Buttigieg becomes the presidential frontrunner in
Iowa - Vox and B (1.0) - Colin Kaepernick Skips NFL Organized
Workout, Wears Shirt Likening Himself to a Slave - Breitbart.

The third news similarity graph (NS Graph 3) indicates a
major news event, characterized by a giant connected component (news story) with a high attention score (22.93) indicating a high degree of overlap among news sources. This
indicates a scenario when most news sources report on the
same story (AG William Barr’s release of his principal conclusions of the Mueller Report).
The top news stories of 2019
Stories surrounding the release of the Mueller Report (red
dots in Fig. 3, Table 3 Section 2, No. 1) received the most
attention in 2019. On March 22, 2019, Robert Mueller submitted his report to AG William Barr (attention score = 18.72).
Two days later, AG William Barr released his summary (principal conclusions) of the report. This story received the most

FUTURE WORK AND CONCLUSION

StoryGraph has been generating one news similarity graph
every 10 minutes since August 2017. A single graph file
includes the URL of the news articles, plaintext, entities, publication dates, etc. In this paper, we only reported the result
of two studies. The first studies the dynamics of the news
cycle (slow news cycle vs. major news event). The second
utilized attention scores to facilitate finding top stories.

StoryGraph provides the opportunity for further study
beyond the two presented here. For example, a study focused
on the coverage of mass shootings can utilize StoryGraph to
approximate how much attention the 2018 Parkland, Florida
shooting received compared to the 2019 Dayton, Ohio and El
Paso, Texas mass shootings. A different study could narrowly
apply news similarity to focus on a single news organization,
e.g., FoxNews, in order to identify the news stories where
they focus the most attention, or compare the attention span
of different events. Therefore, we believe the StoryGraph
process of quantifying news similarity and the attention of
news sources provides a valuable means for studying news.
