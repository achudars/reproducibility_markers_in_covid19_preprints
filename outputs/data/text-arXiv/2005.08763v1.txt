Abstract
This paper uses Bureau of Labor Statistics employment and wage data to study the distributional impact of the COVID-19 crisis on wages in the United States by mid-April. It answers
whether wages of lower-wage workers decreased more than others’, and to what extent. We find
that the COVID-19 outbreak exacerbates existing inequalities. Workers at the bottom quintile
in mid-March were three times more likely to be laid off by mid-April compared to higher-wage
workers. Weekly wages of workers at the bottom quintile decreased by 6% on average between
mid-February and mid-March and by 26% between mid-March and mid-April. The average
decrease for higher quintiles was less than 1% between mid-February and mid-March and about
10% between mid-March and mid-April. We also find that workers aged 16–24 were hit much
harder than older workers. Hispanic workers were also hurt more than other racial groups. Their
wages decreased by 2–3 percentage points more than other workers’ between mid-March and
mid-April.

Introduction

The COVID-19 outbreak led to an unprecedented abrupt shock to many countries, with the United
States becoming the epicenter of the pandemic in late March 2020. With more than a million
COVID-19 cases, and hundreds of millions of people in lockdown, the economic impact of the
pandemic is massive and may become even greater in the near future.
Among the early outcomes of the “Great Lockdown” that followed the outbreak of the pandemic were the shutdown of many businesses and large-scale layoffs of workers. Millions of US
workers have filed initial unemployment claims, bringing the unemployment rate in the US to
15.7% (Department of Labor, 2020). The labor market impact of the lockdown is expected to be
worst for jobs that cannot be performed remotely and are not considered essential. Such jobs are
also generally lower-paid (Adams-Prassl et al., 2020). Early evidence of the impact on unemployment suggests that it rises faster for women, Black men and Hispanics (Adams-Prassl et al., 2020;
Kalev, 2020). Mongey, Pilossoph and Weinberg (2020) find “that workers in low-work-from-home
or high-physical proximity jobs are more economically vulnerable.”
This paper studies the short-run distributional impact of the COVID-19 crisis on wages. In particular, it answers whether, indeed, wages of lower-wage workers decreased more than others’ and to
what extent. It also clarifies the magnitude of the effect – what share of the labor force was substantially impacted? The paper also addresses age-, gender-, and race-specific impact. It answers
whether wages of young workers decreased more than of older workers, whether wages of female
workers were hurt more than of male workers, and how the impact on wages depended on race.
To answer these questions one would have to compare wages of employees just before the coronavirus
pandemic outbreak in the US, to their wages at a later time. Yet, reliable large-scale real-time
tracking of individual wages is challenging. Most administrative data cannot be used in real-time.
Most large-scale surveys report earnings on a quarterly or annual basis. Several ad-hoc surveys
have been conducted in the US and elsewhere (Bartik et al., 2020a; Adams-Prassl et al., 2020), yet
their scale is limited and it is difficult to verify how representative their samples are for the labor
market. Moreover, most of these data sources are not longitudinal, making it difficult to follow
individuals over time. This paper uses wage and employment data from the monthly establishment
survey of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS, see Bureau of Labor Statistics (2020a)). These data
represent 110–130 million private sector workers, divided into industry sectors.
Combining employment and wage data we create synthetic panels for private sector workers, from
which we estimate non-anonymous growth incidence curves (NAGICs, see Bourguignon (2011)).
NAGICs quantify the average wage growth rates of individuals occupying a specific wage rank at
the beginning of a given period. Thus, constructing a NAGIC for US workers for a period that
spans from just before the outbreak of the pandemic in the US and a later point in time would
quantify its impact on wages at different points along the wage distribution.
The NAGICs show that the weekly wages of workers at the bottom quintile decreased by 6% on

1

average between mid-February and mid-March and by 26% between mid-March and mid-April.
The rest, i.e. top 80%, lost less than 1% on average by mid-March and about 10% by mid-April.
For comparison, between January and February, all quintiles, including the bottom, gained about
0.6% of their wages on average.
We find no evidence for a significant change on hourly wages for workers that remained employed.
Thus, the major reduction of weekly wages among workers at the bottom quintile is due to lay offs
and reductions in working hours. It is not, at least by mid-April, due to changes in hourly wages.
Combining the panels with data from the Current Population Survey (CPS) on the composition of
industry sectors by age, gender and race, we study the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the
wages of different subgroups. We find that the reduction in weekly wages following the COVID-19
outbreak was slightly more pronounced among women than among men. Wages of female workers
decreased by 0.2–0.3 percentage points more than of male workers. The decrease in wages was
particularly large for younger workers, aged 16–24, in comparison to older workers.
The decrease in weekly wages was also large among Hispanic or Latino workers. The average
reduction in weekly wages between mid-February 2020 and mid-March 2020 was greater by 0.4
percentage points among Hispanic workers than among all workers, and by 0.5 percentage points
within the bottom quintile. Between mid-March and mid-April the reduction in wages among
Hispanic workers was greater by about 2 percentage points than among all workers, and by 3
percentage points within the bottom quintile. All subgroups considered (young, female, male,
White, Black, Asian, and Hispanic workers) suffered from an average reduction of 4.8%–6% in
weekly wages between mid-February and mid-March, and an average reduction of 25%–30% in
weekly wages between mid-March and mid-April within the bottom quintile.
The primary contribution of this paper is empirical. It provides new information on job losses and
hourly and weekly wage losses among workers along the wage distribution following the COVID-19
outbreak. It also enables identifying the differential impact on wages by age, gender, and race.
It joins the growing literature on labor market impact of the COVID-19 outbreak (Alon et al.,
2020; Adams-Prassl et al., 2020; Bartik et al., 2020a,b; Brunori et al., 2020; Cajner et al., 2020;
Chetty et al., 2020; Mongey, Pilossoph and Weinberg, 2020), focusing mainly on employment and
the reaction of firms to the pandemic so far. It also joins the growing literature on how inequalities
contribute to unequal health outcomes during the outbreak (Ahmed et al., 2020; Glover et al., 2020;
van Dorn, Cooney and Sabin, 2020).
From a methodological perspective the paper contributes to the labor and inequality literatures on
short-run distributional changes, especially such that take into account panel data (Kopczuk, Saez and Song,
2010; Bourguignon, 2011; Piketty, Saez and Zucman, 2018; Berman, 2019). Usually such research
relies on large scale surveys, tax data or social security data, which cannot be used in real-time.
This paper presents a way to use a reliable existing data source that is published on a monthly
basis, the BLS establishment survey, to study short-run distributional changes. This would allow
to easily expand the analysis done here in the future. We also hope that this work will stimulate
2

similar work in other countries with similar data sources.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 lays out necessary background on growth incidence
curves, which serve as the primary tool for our analysis. Section 3 describes the data we use. Section 4 presents the results on the distributional impact on wages, and Section 5 presents the impact
on wages by age, gender, and race. We conclude in Section 6.

Growth incidence curves

The main tool we will use to quantify and characterize the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak
on wages is non-anonymous growth incidence curves (NAGICs). The concept of growth incidence
curves (GICs) is central in studies of poverty and inequality. It is a useful tool for illustrating how
income (or wealth, consumption, etc.) grows (or degrows) over a time period along the income
(wealth, consumption, etc.) distribution. GICs quantify the average growth at each rank in the
distribution. Yet, it matters how the ranks are defined and how incomes are compared, and there
are two main types of GICs – anonymous and non-anonymous.
Anonymous GICs (Ravallion and Chen, 2003) quantify the growth of the average income in the
same income fractile over a time period. They ignore the identity of individuals within fractiles. In
general, GICs are upward sloping, i.e. lower for the bottom of the distribution and higher at the
top, when inequality is increasing and vice versa. They are insensitive to mobility between income
ranks.
Non-anonymous GICs (Grimm, 2007; van Kerm, 2009; Bourguignon, 2011) quantify the average
income growth of individuals occupying a specific income rank at the beginning of a given period,
but not necessarily the same income rank by the end of the period. They can be downward (upward)
sloping depending on whether poorer individuals experience higher (lower) average growth rates
than richer individuals. The NAGIC and the GIC thus differ through the former incorporating
personal income mobility. They coincide when no reranking occurs between the initial and terminal
dates.
While NAGICs are seemingly more informative of the individual experience of income changes, they
require panel data, which are more difficult to collect, and are more sensitive to measurement error
than anonymous GICs (Berman and Bourguignon, 2020). It is possible to overcome data limitations
and create approximate NAGICs using quasi-NAGICs. In quasi-NAGICs individual incomes are
not followed over time. Instead, the population is divided into groups and the average income
within each group is followed over time. Mobility within each group is ignored, but not between
groups. For example, Lakner and Milanovic (2016) apply this to the global income distribution in
which the identity of a particular country-decile is preserved, ignoring changes in the identity of
individuals within each country-decile.
We use a similar approach by dividing workers into industry sectors. This is done as follows: For

3

two points in time, A and B (say two surveys, like February and March, or March and April), each
sector s = 1, 2, . . . , S is characterized by the respective numbers of employed workers in the sector

and B. The wages of each worker are set to either wsX (X being the point in time and s being the
X
industry sector of that worker) or 0, if the wages of nX
s workers were already set to ws . This allows
A
taking into account layoffs. If nB
s < ns , as expected in most sectors during a major crisis, then

there will be workers whose wages at time A were set to wsA , but at time B to 0, which represent
laid-off workers. This approximate panel now allows estimating NAGICs.

Data

Ideally, to quantify and characterize the distributional impact of the coronavirus pandemic on
wages, one would have to compare wages of employees just before its outbreak, to their wages at
a later time. Yet, large-scale real-time tracking of individual wages is practically impossible. Most
administrative data sources cannot be used in real-time. Most large-scale surveys report earnings
on a quarterly or annual basis. Several ad-hoc surveys exist, in the US (Adams-Prassl et al., 2020;
Bartik et al., 2020a) and elsewhere (Adams-Prassl et al., 2020), but their scale is limited, and their
focus is on employment rather than on wages.
We use wage and employment data from the establishment survey published monthly by the
BLS (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2020a). Each month the BLS surveys US businesses on employment, hours, and earnings of employees. The data represent about 110–130 million workers,
excluding about 30 million government workers, agricultural workers, self-employed workers whose
businesses are unincorporated, unpaid family workers, and private household workers. The wage
data do not include sources of income other than salaried work such as capital income or transfer
payments, and they are also pre-tax.
The BLS data are not individual data, and are given by industry sector. Specifically, the available real-time (i.e. monthly) data represent 14 broad sectors:1 Mining and logging, Construction,
Durable goods, Nondurable goods, Wholesale trade, Retail trade, Transportation and warehousing, Utilities, Information, Financial activities, Professional and business services, Education and
health services, Leisure and hospitality, and Other services. We use the number of employees
in each sector, and the average hourly and weekly wages in each sector. In addition, we use
the CPS data for 2019 to account for the share of employees in each sector by age, gender, and
race (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2020b). These shares are assumed to have remained stable by
April 2020.
For clarity and simplicity, we refer by the name of the month (e.g. March 2020) to the data

In some cases it is possible to create a finer picture based on more sectors, as discussed in Appendix A, without
a substantial effect on the results.

released for the specific month, although these data represent the pay period that includes the 12th
of each month (usually the week that includes that day every month, see Bureau of Labor Statistics
(2020a) Employment Situation Technical Note for more details). Thus, it is more accurate to treat
the monthly data as representing the mid-point of each month. The February survey represents
the situation just before the COVID-19 outbreak in the US. The March survey represents the
initial impact of the evolving crisis. The April survey represents the major impact of the lockdown,
imposed by most states in the US during the second half of March.

Impact on wages along the wage distribution

Figure 1 presents the evolution of the total number of workers employed in the private sector, and
their average weekly wages between January 2020 to April 2020. It shows only small differences
between January, February and March. April, however, is substantially different. Almost 20 million
jobs were lost between mid-March and mid-April. At the same time, the average wages of those
still employed in April substantially increased – from about $980 per week to about $1030 per week,
an increase of 5%. The black line in Fig. 1 suggests that indeed, workers that were laid off in April
were more likely to be low-paid, so that the average wages among workers still employed in April
mechanically increased (see also Appendix B). If, instead, those who lost their job between March
and April were included in the April workers population as earning zero wages, the average weekly
wages in mid-April would be $865 per week, a decrease of 11% from mid-March.

We aim to study a more refined distributional impact on wages using non-anonymous growth incidence curves. These will present the average change in wages along the distribution: for each quintile we estimate the average relative change in wages for the periods January–February, February–
March, and March–April.2
Specifically, since following individual wages is not possible, we construct quasi-NAGICs (see Section 2). We use the number of employees and the weekly and hourly wages of employees in 14
different industry sectors.3 By following the number of employees in each sector over time, layoffs
are taken into account, as explained in Section 2. We assume the same wage for all workers within
each sector,4 and that workers do not move between sectors during the time period in question.
Specifically, we assume that laid-off employees were not rehired in another sector. These are assumptions imposed by the limitations of the available data. Yet, in practice, they only have a small
impact on the estimated NAGICs (see Appendix).
The procedure described results in a synthetic panel of all nonfarm private sector employees, each of
which is characterized by her wages at two different points in time. The NAGICs are easily produced
from these panels (Bourguignon, 2011). Fig. 2 presents the main results – NAGICs for January–
February, February–March, March–April. It shows that weekly wages of lower-wage workers were
hurt more than of higher-wage workers between February and March, and most significantly between
March and April. Lower-paid workers were more likely to see their wages and working hours decrease
and to be laid off.
All wage ranks were negatively impacted between February and March, and between March and
April. Between February and March the NAGIC was quite flat above the bottom quintile, and the
decrease in wages was small for the top 80%. Taking the January–February NAGIC as a reference,
the COVID-19 impact is even more pronounced – the typical monthly change in weekly wages tends
to be small, and rather flat along the distribution. Not only that during the crisis the change is
lower than this reference, it is significantly below 0, and especially low for workers at the bottom
quintile.
The right panel in Fig. 2 shows how changes in employment depended on the initial wage quintile
for the three periods considered. There was no substantial change in employment in any quintile
between January and February. Between February and March there is already a noticeable decrease,
concentrated at the bottom quintile (inline with the findings of Bartik et al. (2020a)). The NAGICs
in the left panel are clearly dominated by the changes in employment. Yet, weekly wages may also
2

All the changes in wages we refer to are “democratic”, i.e. we consider the average relative change in wages
within each wage rank, rather than the change in average wage within each wage rank (Chenery et al., 1974;
Adamou and Peters, 2016; Saez and Zucman, 2019). The difference between the two can be substantial, in general. In this case, the difference between the two types of growth rate is small (see Appendix C).
3
For non-seasonally adjusted data it is possible to use a finer division to 32 sectors, and to 185 sectors until March.
Yet, the differences between the resulting NAGICs with 14, 32, or 185 sectors are small (see Appendix A), and we
would like to focus on the seasonally adjusted data.
4
This assumption matters greatly to the wage distribution, of course, but not to the NAGICs. NAGICs only
quantify the average growth of wages, and are therefore less sensitive to the shape of the distribution within each
sub-group of the population. See Appendix D for more details.

change for some due to increased or decreased number of working hours following the crisis, or the
increase in demand for workers in specific sectors which may affect hourly wages.
The January–February and February–March NAGICs are almost insignificant compared to March–
April. The average decrease in weekly wages in quintiles 2–5 was about 10% by mid-April, and
about 26% in the bottom quintile. The total number of employees decreased between mid-March
and mid-April by about 15%. Yet, the reduction in employment was even more substantial for
the bottom quintile. 30% of the workers at the bottom quintile in mid-March were laid off by
mid-April. Thus, workers at the bottom quintile were about three times more likely to be laid off
compared to higher-wage workers.

Impact on wages by age, gender, and race

When producing the NAGICs, we created synthetic panels of employees. Employees were characterized by their wages (determined by their industry sector) at two different points in time, such as
mid-February and mid-March. This panel can be augmented by combining it with data on the share
of workers of different genders, age groups, and races in each sector (Bureau of Labor Statistics,
2020b). This allows addressing questions of gender-, age-, and race-specific impact, e.g. whether
wages of female workers decreased more than males’, or whether employees of a certain race were
impacted more than of other races.
To explain how the panel is augmented, let us consider the case of female workers as an example.
7

Suppose there are nA
s employees in sector s, at time A, of which a share ρs are female employees,
we randomly choose ρs · nA
s employees, which are then flagged as corresponding to female employees
in this sector. Repeating this for all sectors, we create a division of the population of employees to
female and male, enabling the calculation of the average change in wages among female employees
only and among male employees only. The random assignment means that each assignment will
result in a slightly different average rate of change in wages. In each case we produced 1000 random
assignments and consider the distribution of results to account for statistical significance. The
uncertainty in these results is only due to the random assignment. It would not take into account
potential biases which the data cannot account for, such as a preference to lay off women compared
to men in some sectors, or vice versa. We also note that this method ignores the observation that
within sectors there is a wage gap between men and women, White and non-White workers, etc..
Yet, the test presented in Appendix D demonstrates that taking into account a distribution of
wages rather than average wages does not have a large impact on the results.
This procedure was separately performed in each case, considering female and male workers, young
workers (i.e. workers aged 16–24) and then four different racial groups: White, Black or African
American, Asian, and Hispanic or Latino. The results are presented in Fig. 3. It shows that
between January 2020 and February 2020 all groups enjoyed an average increase in wages of about
0.6%.
Between February 2020 and March 2020 the picture is strikingly different. First, all groups suffered
from an average decrease in wages of about 1.4%. However, women, Black, and particularly young
workers and Hispanic workers suffered from significantly higher decreases. The decrease was slightly
lower for White, although only mildly.
Focusing on workers at the bottom quintile in February, which, as Fig. 2 shows, were hurt much more
than others, the picture remains largely unchanged. All subgroups suffered from large decreases to
their weekly wages. Again, Hispanic workers seem to have been hit more than other groups, with
an average reduction of 5.5% in their weekly wages. Weekly wages of young workers at the bottom
quintile decreased by almost 6%. Unlike the picture for the entire population of workers, Asian
workers in the bottom quintile experienced relatively large decrease in wages. Hourly wages show
very similar patterns (see Appendix E).
The reduction in wages between mid-March and mid-April was clearly larger. All groups suffered
an average reduction of 14%–20% in their weekly wages. As in the previous period, young workers
and Hispanic workers are the subgroups that saw the biggest reductions in wages. Within the
bottom quintile, all groups suffered an average reduction of 25%–31% in their wages. Asian and
Hispanic workers, and particularly young workers suffered the largest declines.
The differences between racial groups reflect the composition of different industry sectors. For
example, the leisure and hospitality sector, one of the sectors that suffered the biggest declines in
employment between January and April, has a large share of Hispanic workers (24%), but only a
small share of Asian workers (6.9%).

Conclusion

The outbreak of COVID-19 in the United States had an unparalleled short-term impact on workers.
Our results illustrate a major negative impact on wages by mid-April that was concentrated at, but
not restricted to, the bottom quintile of workers. This impact is a combination of massive layoffs
and a reduction in working hours, affecting mostly lower-paid workers.
Our analysis shows that the reduction in weekly wages following the COVID-19 outbreak was
slightly more pronounced among women than among men. In particular, the decrease in weekly
wages was pronounced among young workers (aged 16–24), relative to older workers, and to Hispanic
workers, compared to other racial groups. These results highlight that while mortality rates from
9

COVID-19 are very low among young adults, young workers have been economically hit harder than
older workers due to the lockdown so far. This imposes additional political and social challenges
to governments trying to manage the ongoing crisis.
The results call for continuous monitoring of the impact on employment and wages, which can
inform policy trying to mitigate the negative impact of the lockdown on those hurt the most.
Clearly, the US economy will gradually reopen during the next few months and many people will
be rehired or employed in other businesses and sectors. Wages may start increasing. Yet, it is still
unclear when this will happen, and how quick, if at all, the recovery will be, especially for those
hit hardest during the past few months.

Sensitivity to resolution of industry sectors

The NAGICs presented above rely on a division of workers into sectors. At this early stage the BLS
seasonally adjusted establishment data for April are only available at a rather coarse resolution, and
are based on 14 industry sectors: Mining and logging, Construction, Durable goods, Nondurable
goods, Wholesale trade, Retail trade, Transportation and warehousing, Utilities, Information, Financial activities, Professional and business services, Education and health services, Leisure and
hospitality, and Other services. The non-seasonally adjusted data are available at a slightly finer
resolution, with some of the 14 sectors broken down into sub-sectors. The finer resolution allows
dividing all workers into 32 sectors. For the periods January– February and February–March it is
possible to use an even finer resolution of 185 sectors.
Clearly, the finer the division into sectors, the more accurate the resulting NAGICs are, since we
rely on the sector-average wage as being representative of the wages of workers in each sector.
Since the seasonally adjusted data provide more relevant information for the interpretation of the
NAGICs, we use the division to 14 sectors as the baseline NAGICs (see above). To demonstrate
that this rather coarse division does not create a large impact on the resulting NAGICs, we compare
the non-seasonally adjusted NAGICs based on a division to 14 sectors to a similar analysis in which
workers are divided into 32 sectors and into 185 sectors. These results are presented in Fig. 4 and
in Fig. 5. Indeed the differences between the NAGICs for the three resolutions (14, 32, and 185
sectors) are small and do not change qualitatively any of the main results discussed above.

Changes in hourly wages by quintile

Using the Current Population Survey (CPS) (Flood et al., 2020) it is possible to find additional
indications for the differential changes in hourly wages by quintile. The CPS does not follow
individuals over time, and cannot be exactly matched with the information on layoffs at different
sectors like the BLS data. Yet, it can be used to produce anonymous GICs for the periods January
2020 – February 2020, February 2020 – March 2020, and March 2020 – April 2020 for hourly wages,
while excluding workers that were laid off.
The results are presented in Fig. 6. In January 2020 – February 2020 and February 2020 – March
2020 the GICs are nearly flat, indicating that the changes in hourly wages were rather homogeneous
across the wage distribution. The March 2020 – April 2020 the picture is different. First, average
hourly wages increased substantially for all quintiles, apart from the top quintile. Second, the
increase in hourly wages generally decreases with the wage rank. Similar to Fig. 1, this reaffirms
that lower-paid workers were more likely to be laid off, which mechanically leads to an increase in
hourly wages, even if workers’ wages have not changed.

Average change in wages and change of average wages

The change in wages among different groups can be quantified in various ways. The most common
way is by the relative change in average wages. This is similar to how income growth is typically
measured. A major advantage of using this measure is that it does not require information on how
wages are distributed within a certain group. Only averages are needed. Another common way to
quantify the change in wages is by averaging over individual relative changes in wages. For each
individual in a certain group a growth rate is estimated, and then the change in wages of that
group is defined as the average across all individual growth rates. The advantage of this approach
is that it gives the same weight to each individual in the group, rather than to each dollar earned
by a member of the group, like the previous approach.
The differences between the two approaches have been thoroughly discussed in the literature (Chenery et al.,
1974; Atkinson, 1975; Adamou and Peters, 2016; Saez and Zucman, 2019). In the context of domestic product growth, the former approach is the standard way in which GDP growth is quantified.
The latter is sometimes referred to as “democratic”, or as “People’s growth” (Saez and Zucman,
2019). Since we aim to quantify as best as possible the experience of individual change in wages, the
results in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 are quantified using the average growth rate. The differences between
the two approaches in the context of this analysis are very small. This is illustrated in Fig. 7. It
shows the NAGICs as in Fig. 2, also using the growth of average wages in each quintile rather than
only the average growth rate.

The impact of using sector-average wages

The main limitation of the quasi-NAGIC approach is that the wage of each worker in the synthetic
panel is taken to be the average wage in the sector to which she belongs. This is a limitation
since wages differ dramatically within sectors. High-rank employees in some companies, whose
wages are among the highest in the entire labor force, might be grouped together with employees
that are earning the minimum wage. Nevertheless, since we are interested in average changes in
wages, and not in the shape of the wage distribution, this limitation may not have a big impact on
the estimated NAGICs, and the sector-average wages may still be indicative of the wages of most
workers in the sector.
To test this we simulate a distribution of wages within each sector. Within each sector we assume the wage distribution is lognormal, a rather standard modeling assumption,5 and assume
the same degree of inequality within each sector. We simulate the distribution within each sector
independently in each month, so we can no longer consider the synthetic panel – the correlation
between wages at the two months will no longer represent the realistic correlation, which is close to
1 (Kopczuk, Saez and Song, 2010). Thus, we use anonymous GICs, in which the panel component
does not play a role. We compare the GICs produced using sector-average wages and the GICs
produced when simulating a realistic wage distribution. Since each randomly-generated simulation
yields a slightly different GIC, we consider the average of 1000 simulations, noting that in all cases
described below the variation between GICs in different realizations was small.
Figure 8 presents the comparison considering weekly wages using the same data used for Fig. 2. It
shows that for the period January–February the sector-average and the simulated anonymous GICs
are indistinguishable. The differences for the period February–March are noticeable, but very small.
For March–April the changes are slightly larger, but still smaller than 5 percentage points for all
quintiles. The differences do not suggest any of the conclusions discussed above is invalid. We also
note that the sensitivity of these results to the degree of inequality assumed in the simulated GICs
is small within the realistic domain of Gini coefficients, between 0.3 and 0.5. While the simulated
GICs may be more realistic than the sector-average based GICs, we remind the reader that our goal
is to provide NAGICs, which are more informative on the individual experience of wage changes
than anonymous GICs.

See Pinkovskiy and Sala-i-Martin (2009). Also Bénabou (2000) argued that “the lognormal is a good approximation of empirical income distributions, leads to tractable results, and allows for an unambiguous definition of
inequality.”

Impact on hourly wages by age, gender, and race

Figure 9 shows the impact on hourly wages by age, gender, and race, similarly to the results shown
in Fig. 3 for weekly wages. It shows a similar pattern. Between January 2020 and February 2020
all groups enjoyed a small average increase in wages. Between February 2020 and March 2020 all
groups suffered from an average decrease in wages of about 0.5%. The reduction in wages among
women, Black, and particularly young workers and Hispanic workers was significantly higher than
for other groups. The decrease was slightly lower for White workers. Focusing on workers at the
bottom quintile in February, all subgroups suffered from large decreases to their hourly wages.
Hispanic and Asian workers seem to have been hit more than other groups, with an average decline
of 1.8% in their hourly wages.
Between March 2020 and April 2020 all groups suffered a large decrease in wages, ranging from 12%
to 19%. The reduction in wages was particularly significant among young workers and Hispanic
workers. Within the bottom quintile all groups suffered reductions of 25%–31%. Young workers,
as well as Asian and Hispanic workers were the groups hit hardest.
