Abstract: New coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has constituted a global pandemic and
has spread to most countries and regions in the world. Through understanding the
development trend of confirmed cases in a region, the government can control the
pandemic by using the corresponding policies. However, the common traditional
mathematical differential equations and population prediction models have limitations for
time series population prediction, and even have large estimation errors. To address this
issue, we propose an improved method for predicting confirmed cases based on LSTM
(Long-Short Term Memory) neural network. This work compares the deviation between
the experimental results of the improved LSTM prediction model and the digital
prediction models (such as Logistic and Hill equations) with the real data as reference.
Furthermore, this work uses the goodness of fitting to evaluate the fitting effect of the
improvement. Experiments show that the proposed approach has a smaller prediction
deviation and a better fitting effect. Compared with the previous forecasting methods, the
contributions of our proposed improvement methods are mainly in the following aspects:
1) we have fully considered the spatiotemporal characteristics of the data, rather than
single standardized data; 2) the improved parameter settings and evaluation indicators are
more accurate for fitting and forecasting. 3) we consider the impact of the epidemic stage
and conduct reasonable data processing for different stage.

1 Introduction
At the beginning of 2020, COVID-19 was spread worldwide [World Health Organization
(2020)]. The analysis and prediction of COVID-19 is a vital prerequisite for formulating
infectious disease prevention and control strategies. The prediction of infectious diseases
is an important task in health work, which will detect the development trend of the

disease early and increase the predictability of the epidemic prevention work [Wang
Xinzhi; Liu Yi; Zhang Hui; Ma Qiuju; Cao Zhidong. (2018)]. It plays an essential rule in
disease prevention, treatment and health decision-making.
The confirmed cases prediction model for COVID-19 is still in the research and
exploration stage. Among them, how to use machine learning to predict the effect still
needs more experiments to verify.
The number of infections and deaths of infectious diseases is a set of time series. There
are many methods for time series prediction [Cheng, J.; Xu, R. M.; Tang, X. Y.; Sheng,
V. S.; Cai, C. T. (2018)], [Oh Byoung Doo; Song Hye Jeong; Kim Jong Dae; Park Chan
Young; Kim Yu Seop. (2019)]. As a special RNN model, LSTM has always been
effective in time-series data prediction.
RNN can capture the dynamics of the sequence through loops in the network of nodes.
The recursive network retains a state that can represent information from any long
context window. In the past, it is challenging to train RNN because the training of RNN
model usually contains millions of parameters. However, in recent years, with the
development of network architecture, optimization technology and parallel computing, it
is possible to train RNN models on a large scale. Among them, the models based on the
long-term short-term memory system (LSTM) and Bidirectional RNN (BRNN) have a
great breakthrough in performance and can complete a variety of tasks.
The feedback connection of LSTM makes the neural network have internal or short-term
memory. Such features are suitable for processing sequence-related problems: such as
speech classification, prediction and generation, image subtitles, language translation,
and handwriting recognition.
In view of the current COVID-19 infection status, this paper proposes a LSTM-based
COVID-19 confirmed cases prediction model. The core model of this paper is based on
the LSTM model. The outstanding advantage of the LSTM model is that it can
effectively capture long-term time dependencies. The input of the model is mainly the
number of diagnoses, the number of deaths, whether the city is closed, and the features
included are the number of newly diagnosed, the number of deaths, the growth rate of the
number of diagnoses, the growth rate of deaths, etc. The final output is the predicted
number of people who get infected.
In this paper, we propose an improved method. This method has a better fitting effect for
regions with a large population base, and the prediction effect is more accurate than the
traditional Logistic and Hill Equation population prediction algorithms.
2 Related Work
This paper is based on the background data of the number of confirmed diagnoses and
deaths of new coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreaks in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.
We reviewed the traditional population growth prediction model, infectious disease
model, the number prediction of machine learning applied in practice, and the recent
research and development prediction model of COVID-19. Then, an improved prediction
approach based on LSTM is proposed in the work.

2.1 Population growth prediction model
Since the Malthus population model was proposed, it has been widely used in various
fields. Later, related scholars added the population coefficient to the Malthus model to
realize the improvement of the model, and proposed the Logistic model. This model
makes the related population prediction more accurate and effective. For the prediction of
regional population size and age structure, Shorokhov, S. I. used the matrix form to
realize population prediction through the comparison of immigration inflow [Shorokhov,
S. I. (2014)]. Similarly, the use of different mathematical models can also predict the
number of world population. Yuri S. Popkov and others used the entropy estimation
algorithm to construct a random prediction model [Popkov Y S, Dubnov Y A, and
Popkov A Y. (2016)]. The problem with the traditional Logistic regression model is that
when there are many feature quantities, the accuracy of its prediction will decrease.
Therefore, there are not suitable for scenarios containing a large number of multi-type
features or variables. However, we propose a prediction method using the LSTM network
model in machine learning which has a good advantage in this filed.
2.2 Infectious Disease Model
According to the population growth prediction model, Kermack proposed the SIR
epidemic model. After that, the SIR epidemic model has been well applied. Ning, Z et al.
predicted the case of infectious diseases through grey and differential equation models
[Ning, Z. and Lin, L. (2014)]. This model is mainly used in epidemiology. A common
situation is to explore the risk factors of a disease or predict the probability of a disease
based on risk factors and so on. Paul D. Haemig used decades of database to build
mathematical models and realized the prediction of the number of patients with
encephalitis next year [Haemig P D, Sjöstedt de Luna S, Grafström A et al. (2011)]. In
terms of infectious diseases related to this article, there are also many mathematical
models used to predict. A. Gray used stochastic differential equations to improve the SIS
epidemic model [Gray A, Greenhalgh D, Hu L et al. (2011)] and established a new SIR
model to predict the development trend of avian influenza and human influenza [Iwami S,
Takeuchi Y, and Liu X. (2007)]. In recent years, infectious disease models have been
continuously improved and developed. Infectious disease models are applied to the
prediction and prevention of medical places and have played a huge role in promoting it.
There is a combination of approximate Bayesian algorithm and infectious disease model
to calculate risk probability [Minter A and Retkute R. (2019)]. Li Q combined with
evolutionary game theory to realize the infectious disease prediction model with
vaccination strategy, and achieved good results in practical application
[Li Q, Li M C, Lv L et al. (2017)].In response to the development of national conditions,
relevant scholars have also proposed the practical comparison of real-time prediction of
endemic infectious diseases based on LASSO models in different countries
[Chen Y, Chu C W, Chen M I C et al. (2018)]; In addition, there are many practical
models. On the one hand, the comparison of basic models enables the selection, trade-off
and comparison of infectious disease models [Funk S and King A A. (2020)]. On the
other hand, the researchers combined the local ILI incidence and used a dynamically
calibrated compartment model for real-time analysis and real-time prediction of influenza

??

outbreaks in Belgium [Miranda G H B, Baetens J M, Bossuyt N et al. (2019)]. Although
the SIR epidemic model predicts good results, there has a big problem. This model is
based on differential equations, so the process of solving equations is very complicated.
Another drawback is the prediction results are very sensitive to the initial value
conditions, leading that the robustness of the model is week. In this respect, we use the
LSTM model's own reverse error propagation characteristics to train the data.
2.3 Quantity prediction of machine learning applied to practice
The traditional prediction methods are based on the mathematical model. Nowadays,
Machine Learning prediction has more and more widely used. The combination of
Machine Learning and traditional forecasting models for quantitative forecasting has
mushroomed. At present, there are data processing methods using hierarchical learning
methods to predict the citation times of future papers [Chakraborty T, Kumar S, Goyal P
et al. (2014)]. Some people have also used machine learning to realize the measurement
of content and literature, and predict the citation time of biomedical literature [Fu L and
Aliferis C. (2010)]. In addition, artificial neural networks have also been used to predict
populations [Folorunso O, Akinwale A T, Asiribo O E et al. (2010)]. At the same time,
because of the powerful generalization ability of ML, the traffic flow prediction model
based on Machine Learning has been widely used recently. The existing method
introduces the maximum entropy Kalman filter to achieve traffic flow prediction [Cai L,
Zhang Z and Yang J et al. (2019)]. These studies use deep learning neural networks to
achieve traffic flow prediction. For example, they are the methods to realize multiintersection traffic flow prediction learning [Shen Z, Wang W, Shen Q et al. (2019)] and
hybrid traffic flow prediction method based on multi-mode deep learning [Du S, Li T,
Gong X et al. (2018)]. In addition, Machine Learning has also been commonly used in
infectious disease model prediction. Hani M. Aburas used a neural network model to
predict the proportion of patients diagnosed with dengue fever [Aburas H M, Cetiner B G
and Sari M. (2010)]. At present, machine learning prediction models are often used to
predict traffic flow and other situations. However, there is relatively little research on the
prediction number of people. Our research applies the LSTM model to the number
prediction and finds that the results are relatively good.
2.4 Prediction models for recent studies on COVID-19
For the recent research and development of COVID-19 and its impact, many researchers
have made relevant prediction models based on the data. Zifeng Yang et al. analyzed the
epidemic prevention measures of the Chinese government, and predicted the epidemic
situation of COVID-19 [Yang Z, Zeng Z, Wang K et al. (2020)]. They used the improved
SEIS model and the AI network trained by the SARS data in 2003, and predicted the next
epidemic situation in China. The facts proved that their prediction results were relatively
good. By using the real-time data on the website, Dong E et al. built a web-based
interactive dashboard that can track COVID-19 in real time using the characteristics of
Internet data [Dong E, Du H and Gardner L. (2020)]. In addition, there is a dynamic
stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model that uses data randomization to assess the
impact of coronavirus on the tourism industry and achieves trend prediction

Manuscript Format Template for Publishing in Tech Science Press

??

[Yang Y, Zhang H and Chen X. (2020)]. Although there have been many studies on the
prediction model of COVID-19 recently, we first used the LSTM model to consider the
end of the epidemic. The LSTM model performs forward time memory processing on the
collected large amount of data. And it considers actual factors and characteristic
conditions, and outputs data associated with the factors.
3 Methodology
In this session, we will specifically introduce our data processing method, the
construction of the LSTM model, and the improved method.
3.1 Data selection and processing
Novel coronavirus pneumonia COVID-19 is a highly contagious virus. We hope to use
the data on the number of confirmed cases of the previous days to predict the growth
trend of the number of confirmed cases in the following days. At the same time, whether
the national government takes favorable measures to cut off the spread of the virus is also
an important factor, which will affect the time when the inflection point appears and the
time when the virus continues to spread. Therefore, we use the data onto the number of
daily diagnosing as different countries and the time when the country takes similar "the
curfew" measures as the input of the model data.
To increase the learning efficiency and the features extracting efficiency, it is necessary
to preprocess the data and display more features to facilitate model learning. We take the
cumulative number of diagnosed, the number of newly diagnosed, the cumulative growth
rate of daily diagnoses, and whether the government has closed the city as the input of
model learning. Simultaneously, the number of newly confirmed cases of the next day is
used as an output rather than the cumulative diagnosis of the next day. Because the
numerical range of the number of newly confirmed cases will be relatively small, which
is convenient for the evaluation and comparison of the loss function. For the first two
items, you should not simply use MinMaxScaler for standardization, because the value of
Max will be broken. So we need to manually set the Max value so that the input data is
between [0,1], which can predict the next few days of data perform better, you can
directly use 0 and 1 to express the two options of whether to close the city.
3.2 Long Short Term Memory networks (LSTM)
Long Short Term Memory networks are a special kind of Recurrent Neural Networks. It
has a better effect on time series prediction. There is an incubation period for the new
coronavirus. Using LSTM for time series prediction may find the influencing factors of
potential cases.
Entering LSTM will first pass a forgetting gate, and pass a sigmoid layer which is also
called forgetting gate layer. Take the current state ht −1 and the new input xt as the input
of this layer, and the output is a value of [0,1] . Indicating whether a kind of forget to
store in the previous cell The decision on Ct −1 , 0 means completely forgotten, 1 means
completely reserved, which is

Manuscript Format Template for Publishing in Tech Science Press

f t =  (w f  [ht −1 , xt ] + b f )

??
(1)

Next, you will enter the LSTM input gate. In this step, we determine the vector to be
updated and create a vector update candidate value of a tanh activation function. It can be
expressed by the following formula:

it =  ( wi  [ht −1 , xt ] + bi )
~
Ct = tanh( wC  [ht −1 , xt ] + bC )

(2)
(3)

Then you can get the status in the storage cell as

~
Ct = f t  Ct −1 + it  Ct

(4)

Finally, the last decision output gate will be used to decide what to output and update the
status in a similar way as the previous two gates.

ot =  (wo  [ht −1 , xt ] + bo )

(5)

ht = ot  tanh Ct

(6)

In this way, we get a prediction of future output.

3.3 Proposed Improved Method
We found that the results of the data fitting phase are ideal for regions with few cases, but
for regions with a large number of cases, such as Hubei, China, the results of the fitting
experiment are biased. In this respect, we propose the following methods to improve the
results of the fitting phase which can also make the prediction results better.
This type of problem mainly occurs in regions where the epidemic is serious. Because the
base of the number of people infected with the virus is large, a relatively large number of
new people will be obtained when there should be a small number of new people in the
later stage of the epidemic. In response to this problem, we propose the following
methods to improve the prediction results of the ordinary LSTM model.
First of all, in the later stage of the epidemic, the prevention and control of the epidemic
is relatively strong, and the data fluctuation is small. Simultaneously, the number of

Manuscript Format Template for Publishing in Tech Science Press

??

infected people and the number of diagnosing can be considered to be roughly equal,
because the diagnosed patients will be isolated and can be considered no longer
contagious. Therefore, this stage should be carried out under the conditions of a small
population base.
So we use the standard deviation of last n days as the judgment condition to adjust the
parameters for the number of confirmed cases. First, the data to be input is normalized by
MinMaxScaler based on itself, to unify the standard deviation judgment standard, and
2
2
then calculate the variance  . If the variance  is greater than the critical value  ,
2
that is    , then the data is reduced based on the population base method, divided by
the logarithm based on  , and  can be calculated by simple adjustment. The specific
improved algorithm is as follows:

3.4 Model
Because of the existence of an incubation period and asymptomatic carriers, the Novel
coronavirus pneumonia has many potential factors. However, discovering these potential
effects requires many characteristics. The results obtained only by fitting the LSTM to
the trend may not be ideal. So we go through a fully connected neural network to further
extract the features of the data as the input of the LSTM layer at first. The LSTM layers
output predictions for different conditions of various characteristics according to various
characteristics, and then integrates predictions of various characteristics through the fully
connected layer to obtain the desired result.
At the same time, the incubation period of the Novel coronavirus pneumonia can be as
long as 14 days, so the time series sequences we entered should theoretically be greater
than 14 days.
4 Experiment
In this section, we will introduce our experiments using model fitting prediction, and
explain our evaluation indicators and parameter settings.

Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Cases. It is a dataset for the number of COVID-19
confirmed cases, deaths and recovered operated by the Johns Hopkins Center for Systems
Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE) with the support of the ESRI Living Atlas team

4.2 Evaluation Metric
4.2.1 Goodness of fit
The goodness of fit of a statistical model describes how well it fits a set of observations.
The scale of goodness of fit usually summarizes the difference between the observed
values and the expected values under the model.
Calculation method. Note the mean value of the values to be fitted is y , the expected
value is ŷi , and the fitting result is yi .
Total sum of squares SST is:

4.3 Parameters
4.3.1 Time series length
We set a training window of the training data and get a time series of data. Our model set
a time-series sequence of up to 21 days for training, with the aim of discovering more
carriers' influence on virus transmission during the incubation period.

??

4.3.2 Learning Rate
After normalization, the absolute values of all input and output data values are small, so a
small learning rate is required for the learning progress. As the number of training epochs
increases, the learning rate should also decrease, so that the data can be better fitted.
4.3.3 Forecast days
In order to show the results of data fitting and prediction, we use the trained model to
predict the number of confirmed cases in the next 7 days.
4.3.4 Model
Our model is built according to the following steps. First, the input data extraction
features were put into the LSTM to obtain several time series outputs. After getting the
output of the LSTM network, integrate and merge features in the last part. The model
structure is shown in Fig 2.

Figure 2: The model used in the experiment
4.4 Experiment Result
This part shows the results of our experiments. We will compare our improved LSTM
prediction results with the results of the number prediction model such as Logistic and
Hill Equations. At the same time, the fitting results of our improved fitting algorithm and
the unimproved LSTM algorithm will also be compared.

During the training process, learning rate decreases with the increase of epoch, and the
loss convergence during the training process is shown in Fig 3.

We perform statistical analysis on the prediction results and calculate the deviation value.
It can be seen that the improved LSTM model prediction results are better than the
traditional Logistic and Hill Equation prediction models in most cases. The average error

can be controlled within 2%, which is better than the Logistic and Hill Equation
performance.

Since most of the improved algorithms are suitable for data fitting at the end of epidemic
prevention and control, and now foreign epidemic situations other than China are still in
the outbreak period, they are not applicable. Therefore, we selected three provinces in
China, Hubei Province, Henan Province, and Zhejiang Province, where the epidemic
situations are more serious, and the base of infection cases is larger. The figures show the
experimental results we obtained. It can be seen that the adjusted fitting results are closer
to the real data. Although there may be a large error during the outbreak of the epidemic,
the prediction result has a small error at the end of the outbreak.

We calculated the goodness of fit for the fitting results of the two models before and after
improvement, as shown in Tab 3. The prediction result of the improved model will be
closer to the true value, effectively reducing the late prediction error due to the large case
base.

5 Conclusion
To address the problem of deviation and accuracy in predicting the number of confirmed
cases in traditional methods, we propose an improved method based on LSTM neural
network. The prediction of the diagnosis number of new coronavirus can be regarded as
time series prediction, and the LSTM model has a good effect on time series prediction.
Because of the incubation period of new coronaviruses, time series prediction using
LSTM may also find the influencing factors of potential cases.
First of all, we use the 21-day case data of various countries and regions provided on the
website, and use the cumulative number of diagnoses, the number of new diagnoses, the
cumulative growth rate of daily diagnoses, and whether the government closes the city as
the model input and set parameters MinMaxScaler standardized processing. Through a
fully connected neural network, the features of the data are further extracted as input to
the LSTM layer. Build an LSTM neural network, and set the length of the time series, the
learning rate, and the number of days to predict. In view of the huge data in the training
set, to reduce the fitting deviation, we improved the LSTM model, used the unified
standard deviation as the judgment standard, reduced the data using the method based on
the overall cardinality, and adjusted the data. This method creates a tanh activation
function update vector, obtains the status in the storage unit, and determines the output
and update status content through the decision output gate, which can output the
predicted number of newly diagnosed cases in the next day. Besides, according to the
actual situation of the actual epidemic situation, we selected data from several countries
and regions, and compared the deviation between the experimental results of the
improved LSTM prediction model and the digital prediction model (such as Logistic and

Hill equation) and the actual results. And introduce the fitting result of the LSTM
algorithm before and after the improvement. Experiments show that the improved LSTM
model has a smaller prediction deviation and better fitting effect.
