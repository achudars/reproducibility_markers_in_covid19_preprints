Abstract: Entering the Pandemic Recession, we study the high-frequency real-activity
signals provided by a leading nowcast, the ADS Index of Business Conditions produced and
released in real time by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. We track the evolution
of real-time vintage beliefs and compare them to a later-vintage chronology. Real-time
ADS plunges and then swings as its underlying economic indicators swing, but the ADS
paths quickly converge to indicate a return to brisk positive growth by mid-May. We show,
moreover, that the daily real activity path was extremely highly correlated with the daily
COVID-19 path. Finally, we provide a comparative assessment of the real-time ADS signals
provided when exiting the Great Recession.

Introduction

Accurate assessment of of current real economic activity (“business conditions”) is key for
successful decision making in business, finance, and policy. It is difficult, however, to track
business conditions in real time, both because no single observed economic indicator is
“business conditions”, and because different indicators are available at different observational frequencies, and with different release delays. Nevertheless there exists the tantalizing
possibility of accurate real-time business conditions assessment (“nowcasting”), and recent
decades have witnessed great interest in nowcasting methods and applications (e.g., Banbura
et al. (2011)).
The workhorse nowcasting approaches involve dynamic factor models, which relate a
set of observed real activity indicators to a single underlying latent real activity factor.
Both “small data” approaches (e.g., based on 5 indicators) and “Big Data” approaches
(e.g., based on 500 indicators) are available. Small data approaches were developed first,
and they typically involve maximum likelihood estimation (e.g., Stock and Watson (1989)).
Subsequent Big Data approaches, in contrast, typically involve two-step estimation based on
a first-step extraction of principal components (e.g., Stock and Watson (2002), McCracken
and Ng (2016)).
Both introspection and experience reveal that Big Data nowcasting approaches are not
necessarily better. First, they are more tedious to manage, and less transparent. Second,
they may not deliver much improvement in factor extraction accuracy, which increases and
stabilizes quickly as the number of indicators increases (Doz et al., 2012). Third, casual
inclusion of many indicators can be problematic because a poorly-balanced set of indicators
can create distortions in the extracted factor (Boivin and Ng, 2006), whereas small data
approaches promote and facilitate hard thinking about a well-balanced set of indicators (Bai
and Ng (2008)).
Against this background, in this paper we assess the performance of a leading small-data
nowcast, the Aruoba-Diebold-Scotti (ADS) Index of Business Conditions (Aruoba et al.,
2009). ADS is designed to track real business conditions at high frequency, and it has been
maintained and released in real time by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia continuously since 2008.1 Its modeling style and underlying economic indicators build on classic
1

The production version used by FRB Philadelphia differs in some ways (e.g., included indicators and
treatment of trend) from the prototypes provided by Aruoba et al. (2009) and Aruoba and Diebold (2010),
which themselves differ slightly. All discussion in this paper refers to the FRB Philadelphia version. All
materials, including the full set of vintage nowcasts, are available at https://www.philadelphiafed.org/
research-and-data/real-time-center/business-conditions-index.

early work in the tradition of Burns and Mitchell (1946), Sargent and Sims (1977), and Stock
and Watson (1989). The underlying indicators span high- and low-frequency information on
real economic flows: weekly initial jobless claims; monthly payroll employment growth, industrial production growth, personal income less transfer payments growth, manufacturing
and trade sales growth; and quarterly real GDP growth.
Crucially, we assess ADS using only information actually available in real time. This
is required for truly credible real-time evaluation, and it can only be achieved by using
nowcasts produced and permanently recorded in real time, which is very different from simply
removing final-revised data and inserting vintage data into an otherwise ex post analysis.
Unfortunately, such evaluations are rare, because there simply are not many instances of long
series of nowcasts produced and recorded in real time. ADS, however, has been produced
and recorded in real time roughly twice weekly since late 2008, so we can provide realtime performance assessments both exiting the Great Recession and entering the Pandemic
Recession.
We proceed as follows. In section 2 we provide background on aspects of ADS construction, updating, ex post characteristics, and performance evaluation. In section 3 we examine
ADS entering the Pandemic Recession, and we relate the real-time ADS path to the realtime COVID-19 path. In section 4 we provide a comparative examination of ADS exiting
the Great Recession. We conclude in section 5.

Nowcast Construction, Characteristics, and Assessment

Here we provide background on the ADS index construction (section 2.1), ex post historical
characteristics (section 2.2), and general issues of relevance to assessing ex ante nowcasting
performance (section 2.3).

2.1

Construction and Updating

ADS is a dynamic factor model with multiple mixed-frequency real activity indicators driven
by a single latent real activity factor. The ADS index is an estimate of that latent real activity
factor. Importantly, the model is specified such that the real activity factor tracks the demeaned growth rate of real activity. Progressively more negative or positive values indicate
progressively worse- or better-than-average real growth, respectively. Because ADS tracks
2

real activity growth, not level, a positive value does not necessarily mean “good times”;
rather, it means “good growth”, which may be from a level well below trend, as for example
in the early stages of a recovery.
ADS is specified at daily frequency, allowing as necessary for missing data for the lessfrequently observed variables.2 Importantly, despite complications from missing data, timevarying system matrices, aggregation across frequencies, etc., the Kalman filter and associated Gaussian pseudo likelihood evaluation via prediction-error decomposition remain valid,
subject to some well-known modifications.3 Model estimation is therefore straightforward,
after which the Kalman smoother produces an optimal extraction of the underlying real
activity factor. That is, the Kalman smoother produces the ADS index: The extracted
sequence at any time t∗ is the vintage-t∗ ADS sequence, {ADS1 , ADS2 , ...ADSt∗ }.
The first ADS vintage was released 12/5/2008, covering 3/1/1960 through 11/30/2008.
Since then, ADS has been continuously updated whenever new data are released. The
Kalman smoother is re-run, generally within two hours of the release, and the newlyextracted index from 3/1/1960 to “the present” is re-written to the web. ADS has been
updated approximately eight times per month on average since inception.

2.2

Ex Post Characteristics

In Figure 1 we show the ADS index from 03/01/1960 through 12/31/2013, as assessed in the
6/26/2020 vintage. The sample range is well before the vintage pull date, so the chronology
displayed is (intentionally) ex post. We do this because it is instructive to examine the ex
post chronology before passing to real time assessment, which can only be done after ADS
went live in late 2008.4
Several features are noteworthy. For example, the ADS chronology coheres strongly with
the NBER chronology, plunging during NBER recessions. In addition, several often-discussed
features of the business-cycle are evident in ADS, such as the pronounced moderation in
volatility during the Greenspan era.
The ADS value added relative to the NBER chronology stems from the facts that (1) it is
a cardinal measure, allowing one to assess not only recession durations, but also depths and
2

The model must be specified at daily frequency, despite the fact that the highest-frequency indicator
is is weekly initial jobless claims, to account for the varying number of days/weeks per month, which also
produces time-varying system parameter matrices.

See, for example, Durbin and Koopman (2001) on missing data, and Harvey (1991) on aggregation of
flow variables.

The sample period intentionally excludes the Pandemic Recession, which we will subsequently examine
in detail.

patterns (see Table 1), and (2) its updates arrive in timely fashion, whereas the starting and
ending dates NBER recessions are typically not announced until well after the fact (again
see Table 1). Of course, if ADS is to be a useful guide for business and policy decisions, its
frequently-arriving updates must provide reliable signals in real time, not just ex post as in
Figure 1. We now turn to that issue.

2.3

Performance Assessment

Truly credible nowcasting performance assessment requires using vintage information, which
emerges as the limit of a sequence of progressively more realistic and credible nowcast/forecast
evaluation approaches:5
(1) Use full-sample estimation, and use final revised data
(2) Use expanding-sample estimation, and use final revised data
(3) Use expanding-sample estimation, and use vintage data (“Pseudo Real Time”)
(4) Use expanding-sample estimation, and use vintage information (“Real Time”).
5

Note that nowcasts are effectively just h-step-ahead forecasts with horizon h=0.

Notes: Recession dates and durations in months are from the NBER chronology; see https://www.nber.
org/cycles.html. When available, the announcement dates appear in parentheses. The NBER trough
month for the Pandemic Recession has not yet been announced. Recession depth is the minimum absolute
daily ADS value during the recession; more precisely, the depth D of recession R is D = |mini (ADSi )|,
i ∈ R, where i denotes days. Recession severity S is the product of depth and duration. Both D and S use
a late-vintage ADS chronology and the NBER recession chronology.

Approaches (1) and (2) are clearly unsatisfactory: Approach (1) uses time periods and
data values not available in real time, and approach (2) is an improvement but still uses
data values not available in real time. Approach (3), involving vintage data, is typically
viewed as the gold standard. It is implemented comparatively infrequently, however, due to
the tedium involved and the fact that vintage data are often unavailable.6 Approach (4),
involving vintage information, limits the information set to that available and actually used
in real time, which is more restrictive than merely limiting the data to that available in real
time. It is, however, almost never implemented.
To appreciate why fully-credible assessment requires vintage information rather than just
vintage data, consider the following:
(1) Econometric/statistical theory and experience evolve, prompting changes to the estimation procedure; the frequency and timing of re-estimation and its interaction with
benchmark revisions; the estimation sample period; allowance for parameter variation
6

The two key sources of U.S. vintage data are the Real-Time Dataset for Macroeconomists at
the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia (https://www.philadelphiafed.org/research-and-data/
real-time-center/real-time-data/), and ALFRED at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis (https:
//alfred.stlouisfed.org/).

and breaks; the treatment of outliers; the strength of regularization employed; the
predictive loss function employed; etc.
(2) Economic theory and empirical economic experience evolve. Over time this may
prompt, for example, the removal or re-weighting of some component nowcast indicators and/or addition of others (e.g., Diebold and Rudebusch (1991)), as well as
deeper changes in the nowcasting model.
(3) Exact times and reliability of nowcast/forecast calculation and release may differ due
to technological problems; outright mistakes in nowcast/forecast construction; evolving
or changing software algorithms and associated bugs; parallel problems at the agencies
responsible for the underlying data and decisions regarding how to deal with them in
forecast/nowcast construction; etc.
For these and other reasons, just as truly credible evaluation requires refraining from endowing agents with better data than were actually available in real time, so too does it
require refraining from endowing them with better economic or statistical models and related tools than were actually available in real time, better judgment and decision-making
abilities/choices than were actually manifest in real time, etc.
The upshot is clear: Truly credible real-time evaluation – that is, evaluation using vintage
information rather than just vintage data – can only be obtained by using nowcasts produced
and permanently recorded in real time. ADS has been produced and recorded in real time
since late 2008, so we can credibly study the key episode of current interest, entry into the
Pandemic Recession. We now proceed to do so.

The Pandemic Recession Entry

We focus in this section on the Pandemic Recession that started in March 2020. It is
instructive to begin by comparing it to the Great Recession of 2007-2009. To that end we
show the ADS path in Figure 2, from late 2007 through June 2020.7 The so-called “Great
Recession” appears minor by comparison.
7

We refer to an ADS extraction as a path.

Figure 2: ADS Index: Ex Post Path 12/1/2007 - 6/26/2020 (Vintage 6/26/2020)

3.1

A Detailed Look at the Later-Vintage Path

Figure 2 reveals the jaw-dropping ADS drop in the Pandemic Recession, more than five times
that of any other recession since 1960. The ADS drop is entirely appropriate, due to similarly
jaw-dropping and historically unprecedented movements in its underlying indicators.
As of this writing, the official trough month for the Pandemic Recession has not been
announced. It could be as early as May 2020, in which case the Pandemic Recession would
be the shortest in history. Indeed a May trough turns out to be likely. In Figure 3 we
show the later-vintage Pandemic Recession path. The overall extracted path is smooth and
convex, with a minimum in early April, and a return to positive growth by mid-May. We
emphasize again, however, that ADS measures real activity growth, not level. Hence positive
ADS does not necessarily mean “good times”; rather, it means “good growth”, which may
be from a very bad initial condition. That was the situation in late May, as the battered
U.S. economy evidently resumed growth.

Real-Time Vintages
Five Snapshots

In Figure 4 we show several end-of-month paths in black, starting with February 2020. For
comparison, in each panel we also show the later-vintage path in red. Moving through the
five panels of Figure 4:

7

Figure 3: ADS Index: Ex Post Path 1/1/2020 - 6/26/2020 (Vintage 6/26/2020)

(1) In the top panel we show the 2/28/2020 path. ADS has not moved.
(2) In the second panel we show the 3/27/2020 path, which looks very different. ADS has
become acutely aware of the disastrous situation; indeed most of the 3/27 path is well
below the previous all-time (post-1960) ADS low during the 1970s oil-shock recession.8
(3) In the third panel we show the 4/30/2020 path. The April initial claims news is bad,
but less bad than March, which is good, and ADS shows a minimum in late March
followed by a rise toward normalcy by the end of April.
(4) In the fourth panel we show the 5/29/2020 path. The May news is very bad, dominated
by the shockingly bad May 8 payroll employment number (for April), and the late-May
path is massively down-shifted relative to the late-April path. The new minimum is
in mid-April rather than late March, and the 5/29 ADS value is thoroughly dismal,
nowhere near normalcy.
(5) In the fifth panel we show the 6/26/2020 path. Thanks to the strong May payroll
employment number (released June 5), ADS moved into normal territory, and stayed
there. There is clear (albeit highly-tentative evidence for a Pandemic Recession trough
in mid-May, when ADS hits 0.)
8

It is also apparent that the Kalman smoother may be smoothing “too much”, producing low ADS values
well before mid-March, going back into February and even January. Its smoothing is optimal relative to the
patterns in historical data, but the March initial jobless claims movements were unprecedentedly sharp.

Figure 4: Entering the Pandemic Recession: Monthly Real-Time ADS Paths

Notes: We show five monthly real-time ADS paths in black. From top to bottom they are
2/28/2020, 3/27/2020, 4/30/2020, 5/29/2020, and 6/26/2020. For comparison we show the
6/26/2020 path in red in all panels. (In the bottom panel, we show only black, since black
and red are identical.)

3.2.2

The Full Path Plot and Dot Plot

In Figure 5 we show the complete path plot during the Pandemic Recession through 6/26/2020,
with the later-vintage path in red for comparison. The path plot is the set of all real-time
paths; by following rightward through the sequence of paths, moving through time, we track
the evolution of ADS beliefs about the chronology of business conditions.
There are wide real-time divergences between individual early paths and the later vintage
red path. There are interesting patterns, however, with several real-time “meta paths”
evident:
(1) The first extends through the 3/19/2020 ADS announcement. ADS does not move.
Initial claims rise from 0.2m to 0.3m, a large move by historical standards, confirming what everyone already knew: the pandemic would have important real economic
consequences, but the Kalman smoother optimally but erroneously ascribes it to measurement error.
(2) The second meta-path begins with the 3/26/2020 and 4/2/2020 initial claims explosions. ADS plunges, but then recovers steadily despite a steady stream of bad news
10

Notes: We show the last values of all real-time ADS paths in black. For comparison we show
the complete later-vintage path (6/26/2020) in red.
(it is bad, but getting less bad), almost back to 0 by the 5/7/2020 initial claims announcement.
(3) The third meta-path begins with the horrific 5/8/2020 April payroll employment release, with ADS again plunging. It then again begins mean reverting, and does so
completely when the strong May payroll employment number is released on 6/5/2020.
In Figure 6 we show the corresponding “dot plot”, with the 6/26/2020 path again superimposed. Each dot is the last observation of its corresponding path in Figure 5. The dots are
real-time filtered values, because smoothed and filtered values coincide for the last observation in a sample. The dot plot is highly volatile and emphasizes the various meta-paths.

3.3

Real Economic Activity and COVID-19

Because the March-April 2020 collapse in economic activity was obviously caused by COVID19, it is of interest to directly examine the correlation between the two. We can do so at high
frequency (daily), because we have both daily ADS and COVID new cases / deaths data. We
want to correlate COVID new cases with ADS, but the direct new cases data are less reliable
11

Figure 7: Daily ADS and Smoothed Daily COVID-19 Deaths

Notes: We show ADS (6/26/2020 vintage) vs HP-filtered daily COVID-19 deaths led by 20
days. See text for details.
than deaths during the period of interest, because new cases were likely heavily influenced
by changes in the amount of testing undertaken. Instead, a more reliable indicator of new
cases is deaths, adjusted for the approximate 20-day period between infection and death.
Hence we use deaths led by 20 days.9 In Figure 7 we show ADS vs COVID deaths+20.10
The strength of the negative correlation is striking. Of course economic activity plunged in
March when COVID exploded, but there’s much more than that – ADS and COVID continue
to move in lockstep (inversely) through the April COVID peak, its April-May decline, and
its June rebound.

The Great Recession Exit

It is informative to compare the evolution and congealing of views during the Pandemic
Recession entry to those during an earlier, more “standard”, recession, like the Great Re9

We use the Johns Hopkins daily deaths data; see https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/.
We also smooth COVID deaths+20 using a Hodrick-Prescott filter to remove the strong calendar effects
in recorded deaths.

13
Notes: We show five quarterly real-time ADS paths in black. From top to bottom they
are 12/5/2008, 3/6/2009, 6/5/2009, 9/3/2009, 12/4/2009. For comparison we show a latervintage ADS path (December 2010) in red.

cession of 2007-2009. We can’t examine real-time ADS when entering the Great Recession,
because ADS did not start until December 2008, well after the great recession began. But
we can examine it when exiting the great recession. In Figure 8 we show five paths in black,
from ADS inception through the end of the Great Recession, at quarterly intervals. For
comparison we also show a later-vintage path in red.
In the top panel of Figure 8 we show the first ADS path, 12/5/2008. ADS shows a very
deep recession, almost the deepest on record since 1960, bottoming out in 2008Q3, with
movement toward recovery in late Q3 and early Q4, even if it had stalled a bit by early
December. As it turned out, however, the Great Recession subsequently featured a growth
rate “double dip”. The 12/5/2008 ADS path ends just after the first dip, which involved a
sharp drop in September 2008 and an equally sharp rebound.11 At the time it was easy to
read the cards as saying that the recession was ending, and ADS was a bit too optimistic,
moving upward toward recovery.
Now consider the remaining panels of Figure 8. In the second panel we show the next,
and contrasting, 3/6/2009 ADS path. In the interim ADS has quickly learned the situation,
the double dip in particular, and is very much on track, capturing the second dip in January
2009. ADS continues to climb steadily through the third and fourth panels (6/5/2009 and
9/3/3009, respectively), and by the time of the bottom panel (12/4/2009) it is clear that the
Great Recession ended in June or July, with ADS basically fluctuating around 0 after that.
(Recall that ADS=0 means average growth, not zero growth.)
All told, the five quarterly real-time ADS paths generally match the ex post path closely,
and they correctly identify the recession’s end, well before the end of 2009 and indeed roughly
1.5 years before the official NBER announcement in September 2010.
To emphasize ADS timeliness, we plot the later-vintage ADS in Figure 8 all the way
through 2010, which allows inclusion of the NBER’s end-of-recession announcement on
9/20/2010, long after the fact and not helpful for real-time decision making.12 ADS fills
the gap left by the late-arriving NBER chronology, and it also provides a numerical measure
that allows one to track the recession’s pattern, depth, overall severity, etc., in addition to
11

In particular, according to the Federal Reserve’s G.17 Industrial Production (IP) release of October
16, 2008, September IP was severely affected by a highly-unusual and largely exogenous “triple shock”
(Hurricanes Gustav and Ike, and a strike at a major aircraft manufacturer), which caused an annualized
September IP drop of nearly fifty percent. A similar pattern exists for Manufacturing and Trade Sales
(MTS). IP and MTS also rebounded unusually sharply in October – indeed IP appears to “overshoot” –
presumably in an attempt by manufacturers to make up for September’s loss.
12
Of course the NBER is not seeking to be helpful for real-time decision making; rather, they seek to
meticulously construct the U.S. business cycle chronology of record, quite reasonably using all relevant
information – even very late-arriving information.

duration. For example and as recorded in Table 1, ADS identifies the Great Recession as
the worst since 1960 and through 2010, with longest duration and second-greatest depth,
resulting in the greatest overall severity (duration times depth).
In Figure 9 we show the complete path plot. Of course there are errors positive and
negative as the recession evolves, but overall ADS performs well, sending a reliable and
valuable signal for navigating the path out of recession. We show the corresponding dot plot
in Figure 10.

Conclusion

We explored how views formed using a leading nowcast (ADS) evolved when entering the
U.S. Pandemic Recession, which arrived abruptly and was caused by non-economic factors,
tracking the evolution of real-time vintage beliefs and comparing them to a later-vintage
chronology. ADS real activity growth plunged wildly in March 2020 and swung in real
time as its underlying components swung, but it clearly returned to brisk growth by mid
May, making the Pandemic Recession surely the deepest and likely the shortest on record.13
We also documented a strong negative relationship between the real-time ADS Pandemic
Recession entry path and the concurrent real-time COVID-19 entry path, and we compared
the ADS Pandemic Recession entry path to the earlier Great Recession exit path.

The NBER has not yet announced the ending date of the Pandemic Recession.
