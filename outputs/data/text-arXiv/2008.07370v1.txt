INTRODUCTION: CORONA-WARN-APP

The Corona-Warn-App [4] (CWA) is Germany’s official contract tracing smartphone app released on June 16, 2020. It aims to trace
infection chains by informing users that were exposed to a person later tested positive. Centralized contact tracking by apps that
report contacts to a central infrastructure raise privacy concerns,
which is why a decentralized and privacy-preserving contract tracing approach (DP-3T) has been proposed [17]. This concept evolved
to the Exposure Notification APIs by Apple [1] and Google [2], of
which security and privacy properties were assessed [10]. The CWA
uses the decentralized Exposure Notification approach to detect
the proximity of other CWA users by collecting pseudonymous identifiers sent via Bluetooth Low Energy, only stored on the phone. Its

ABSTRACT
On June 16, 2020, Germany launched an open-source smartphone
contact tracing app (“Corona-Warn-App”) to help tracing SARSCoV-2 (coronavirus) infection chains. It uses a decentralized, privacypreserving design based on the Exposure Notification APIs in which
a centralized server is only used to distribute a list of keys of SARSCoV-2 infected users that is fetched by the app once per day. Its
success, however, depends on its adoption. In this poster, we characterize the early adoption of the app using Netflow traces captured
directly at its hosting infrastructure. We show that the app generated traffic from allover Germany—already on the first day. We
further observe that local COVID-19 outbreaks do not result in
noticeable traffic increases.

Vantage Point
CDN

Figure 1: CWA architecture and vantage point
source code—including the Android and iOS smartphone apps, the
backend server, and documentation—is released via Github [6].
We show the overall architecture including our vantage point in
Figure 1. Phones locally store these received identifiers for 14 days.
To protect the user’s privacy, all identifiers are volatile by generating
new temporary exposure keys every 24 hours. If diagnosed with
COVID-19, a user can decide to inform others by uploading (parts
of her) temporary keys (diagnosis keys) used within 14 days to a
central server, verified by health authorities. By monitoring the API,
we observe the first diagnosis keys to be available on June 23 [3].
The CWA regularly downloads shared diagnosis keys from the central
server, matches them against the local Bluetooth encounter history,
and informs the user of having been exposed to an infected person
within the past 14 days if keys match. Shared keys are non-personal
identifiable and all contact tracing data never leaves the phone.
Goal. Since widespread adoption is key to the app’s success [14],
we take the rare opportunity to monitor its nation-wide adoption
starting at day 1. We measure interest in the CWA by monitoring CWA
app and website traffic at its hosting infrastructure, enabling us to
provide first insights into the adoption across Germany. We further
study whether local COVID-19 outbreaks manifest in higher use.

DATA SET

We obtained sampled Netflow traces from routers connecting the
data center hosting the CWA backend (see CDN in Figure 1). These
flows contain web site visits and diagnosis key downloads by the
app. All client IP addresses are prefix-preserving anonymized. We
filter server traffic using 2 IPv4 prefixes mentioned in the CWA backend documentation [7] and omit IPv6. We verified their usage by
resolving the API and web site DNS names (obtained from the app
source code) against 10k open DNS resolvers from public-dns.info.
As both, app and website, use HTTPS only, we restrict the data
to encrypted HTTPS (tcp/443) IPv4 flows from the CDN to the
user—resulting in ≈ 3.3M matching flows within June 15–25, 2020.
Limitations. Website visits and CWA app API calls are served by
the same servers via HTTPS and cannot be differentiated. The
routers Netflow cache eviction settings and sampling result in only

observing few packets for most flows, making a flow-size based
differentiation infeasible. While CWA should periodically download
diagnosis keys, energy saving settings prohibit background downloads on some Android and iOS phones, reported on July 24 [5, 8]
and to be fixed after our study. Periodic request pattern by CWA
might thus be used in future work for app identification. Yet, the
CWA API DNS name appeared in the Umbrella Top 1M domains [16]
on June 24, 27, July 8, 10–11, while the website never appeared—
implying CWA API calls to be more popular than website visits in
OpenDNS and thus might dominate the #flows. Flows reveal trends
in the interest in CWA and geolocation of destination routers/prefixes
enables to study geographic adoption—the scope of this work.
Ethics. The Netflow data provides only flow summaries based on
the packet header and does not reveal any payload information. All
IP addresses are anonymized; it enables us analyzing aggregates of
traffic flows between routers (to identify city-level location information of users) but not individual users. The flow-level statistics
do not enable detecting infected users nor deriving any user-related
information. Our analyses provide aggregated perspectives on the
general interest in the app without compromising users’ privacy.

CWA APP: EARLY ADOPTION RESULTS

Temporal adoption. We show all HTTPS traffic from the CWA CDN
to its clients in Figure 2 (flows and bytes normed to the minimum). It
also cumulative shows officially reported downloads from the Apple
and Google playstores [9], starting on June 17; 36 hours after its
release, the CWA was downloaded 6.4M times (16.2M total downloads
by July 24). With the official release of the CWA on June 16, the traffic
immediately increases (7.5x increase of flows on June 16). Interest
starts to follow the normal diurnal traffic pattern. After an initial
steep traffic increase, it is reduced after a few days, just to re-surge
when news in Germany started reporting higher infection rates
again and subsequent lockdowns in two districts on June 23 [13]
(Gütersloh and Warendorf) followed—widely covered in media.
By knowing that customers of certain ISPs keep the same IP
address over time, we studied how regular routing prefixes communicate with the CWA backend (fraction of individual first to last
day observed). We observe sustained interest as 50% (75%) of the
prefixes occur in 67% (80%) of possible days.
Quick nation-wide spread. The success of the CWA app to trace
infection chains by contact tracing depends on its adoption and
geographic spread. We thus geolocate the request traffic (again both
website requests and app API calls—both reflecting interest) within
Germany shown in Figure 3 by ZIP code areas summed over 10

Figure 3: CWA traffic by district: usage across Germany aggregated over 10 days normalized by maximum
days. We derive 18% of geolocations from local routers within an
ISP that connect customers (ground truth since the router locations
are known), while the rest is located by applying the Maxmind
geolocation database on routing prefixes. Note that client geolocation can be subject to errors; the router city-location can be off the
clients location (e.g., in rural areas) and Maxmind’s geolocation can
also be subject to inaccuracies at city-level [15]. We observe that
almost all districts (shown in the heatmap by ZIP code areas) emit
requests to the CWA backend. Notably, evaluating the geographic
spread on the first day of the app leads to almost the same observation (not shown). In conclusion, the CWA triggered interest across a
almost all German districts.
No effect of local COVID-19 outbreaks. Our measurement period contains two local COVID-19 outbreaks: i) in Berlin on June
18 [11], and ii) in Gütersloh and Warendorf on June 23[13]. The
latter (June 23) led to few domestic travel restrictions for visitors
from these districts [12]. While we observe an increase in usage
starting on June 23 (see Figure 2), this traffic increase also occurs
on federal state level simultaneously—not only in the federal state
(NRW) being home to the affected districts. In Gütersloh, the traffic increased only very slightly and hardly noticeable (insufficient
data for Warendorf). The outbreak in Berlin on June 18 is only
visible for users of a single ISP and not in the overall traffic from
Berlin-based users. For now, we thus conclude that local COVID-19
outbreaks do not appear to generally increase traffic in only the
affected regions. Instead, nation-wide news reports on outbreaks
might contribute to growing app interest across Germany—an effect
we aim to investigate in future work.
Conclusion. Already on its first day, the CWA app generated substantial interest—manifested in traffic from almost all German districts. Local COVID-19 outbreaks do not appear to increase traffic
in the affected regions but can correlate to nation-wide increases.
On this basis, we will investigate patterns driving local adoption
in future work; e.g., if and how does news media fire CWA interest;
and what will be the long-term app interest.
