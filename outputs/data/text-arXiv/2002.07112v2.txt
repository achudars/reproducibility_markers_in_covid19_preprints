Abstract
BACKGROUND
An alternative to epidemiological models for transmission dynamics of Covid-19 in China, we
propose the artificial intelligence (AI)-inspired methods for real-time forecasting of Covid-19 to
estimate the size, lengths and ending time of Covid-19 across China.
METHODS
We developed a modified stacked auto-encoder for modeling the transmission dynamics of the
epidemics. We applied this model to real-time forecasting the confirmed cases of Covid-19
across China. The data were collected from January 11 to February 27, 2020 by WHO. We used
the latent variables in the auto-encoder and clustering algorithms to group the provinces/cities for
investigating the transmission structure.
RESULTS
We forecasted curves of cumulative confirmed cases of Covid-19 across China from Jan 20,
2020 to April 20, 2020. Using the multiple-step forecasting, the estimated average errors of 6step, 7-step, 8-step, 9-step and 10-step forecasting were 1.64%, 2.27%, 2.14%, 2.08%, 0.73%,
respectively. We predicted that the time points of the provinces/cities entering the plateau of the
forecasted transmission dynamic curves varied, ranging from Jan 21 to April 19, 2020. The 34
provinces/cities were grouped into 9 clusters.
CONCLUSIONS
The accuracy of the AI-based methods for forecasting the trajectory of Covid-19 was high. We
predicted that the epidemics of Covid-19 will be over by the middle of April. If the data are reliable
2

and there are no second transmissions, we can accurately forecast the transmission dynamics of
the Covid-19 across the provinces/cities in China. The AI-inspired methods are a powerful tool for
helping public health planning and policymaking.

Introduction
In the beginning of December, 2019, Covid-19 virus that slipped from animals to humans in
Wuhan city, China caused an outbreak of respiratory illness. A number of the statistical, dynamic
and mathematical models of the Covid-19 outbreak including the SEIR model have been
developed to analyze its transmission dynamics1,2,3,4,5. Although these epidemiological models
are useful for estimating the dynamics of transmission, targeting resources and evaluating the
impact of intervention strategies, the models require parameters and depend on many
assumptions. Unlike system identification in engineering where the parameters in the models are
estimated using real data, at the outbreak, estimated parameters using real time data are not
readily available6,7 Most analyses used hypothesized parameters and hence do not fit the data
very well. The accuracy of forecasting the future cases of Covid-19 using these models may not
be very high. Timely interventions are needed to control the serious impacts of Covid-19 on
health.
To overcome limitations of the epidemiological model approach, and assist public health
planning and policy making, we develop an AI based method for real time forecasting of the new
and cumulative confirmed cases of Covid-19 in total and provinces/ cities across China. We
also forecast the possible trend and plateau of Covid-19 transmission in China and group the
provinces/cities into clusters according to the dynamic patterns of Covid-19 transmission. The
analysis is based on the surveillance data of the confirmed Covid-19 cases in China up to
February 18, 2020.

Data Sources
Data on the confirmed cases of Covid-19 from January 11, 2020 to January 20, 2020, and from
January 21, 2020 to February 27, 2020, were from Surging News Network
(https://www.thepaper.cn/) and WHO (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novelcoronavirus-2019/situation-reports), respectively. WHO took the lab confirmed case as the
confirmed cases from January 21, 2020 to February 13, 2020 and took the sum of the number of
the clinical confirmed and lab conformed cases as the number of the confirmed cases after
February 14, 2020. The numbers of the clinical confirmed and the lab confirmed cases in Hubei
Province, China on February 14, was 15,384 and 36,602, respectively. Therefore, the number of
the confirmed cases in Hubei Province before February 14, 2020 was adjusted by the formula:
the number of the confirmed cases = the number of the lab confirmed cases ×

("#$%&'$(()*)
$((()*

.

Data included the total numbers of the accumulated and new confirmed cases in all of China and
the numbers of the accumulated and new confirmed cases across 31 Provinces/Cities in mainland
China and three other regions (Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan) in China. The data were
organized in a matrix with the rows representing the whole China and province/city and columns
representing the number of the new confirmed cases of each day.
The confirmed cases of each province/city were a time series. Let 𝑡,- be the number of the
confirmed cases of the 𝑗./ day within the 𝑖 ./ province/city. Let 𝑍 be a 34 × 𝑚 dimensional
matrix. The element 𝑍,- is the number of the confirmed new cases of Covid-19 on the 𝑗./ day,
starting with January 11, 2020 in the 𝑖 ./ city.
Modified Auto-encoder for Modeling Time Series

5

Modified auto-encoders (MAE)8,9 were used to forecast the number of the accumulative and
new confirmed cases of Covid-19. Unlike the classical auto-encoder where the number of nodes
in the layers usually decreases from the input layer to the latent layers, the numbers of the nodes
in the input, the first latent layer, the second latent layer and output layers in the MAE were 8,
32, 4 and 1, respectively (Figure 1). We view a segment of time series with 8 days as a sample of
data and take 128 segments of time series as the training samples. One element from the dada
matrix 𝑍 is randomly selected as a start day of the segment and select its 7 successive days as the
other days to form a segment of time series. Let 𝑖 be the index of the segment and 𝑗, be the
column index of the matrix 𝑍 that was selected as the starting day. The 𝑖 ./ segment time series
can be represented as {𝑍-! , , 𝑍-! '" , … , 𝑍-! '1 } . Data were normalized to 𝑋-! '2 =

be the normalized number of cases to forecast.

If 𝑆 = 0, then set 𝑌, = 0. The loss function was defined as
: *
𝐿 = ∑"*%
,5" 𝑊, (𝑌, − 𝑌, ) ,
where 𝑌, was the observed number of the cases in the forecasting day of the 𝑖 ./ segment time
series and 𝑌:, was its forecasted number of cases by the MAE, and 𝑊, were weights. If 𝑗, was in
the interval [1, 12], then 𝑊, = 1. If 𝑗, was in the interval [13, 24], then 𝑊, = 2, etc. The back
propagation algorithm was used to estimate the weights and bias in the MAE. Repeat training
processes 5 times. The average forecasting 𝑌:, , 𝑖 = 1, … , 34 will be taken as a final forecasted
number of the accumulated confirmed cases for each province/city.
Forecasting Procedures

6

The trained MAE was used for forecasting the future number of the confirmed cases of Covid-19
for each province/city. Consider the 𝑖 ./ province/city. Assume that the number of new
confirmed cases of Covid-19 on the 𝑗./ day that needs to be forecasted is 𝑥,- . Let 𝐻 be a 34 × 8
"

dimensional matrix and ℎ,6 = 𝑥,-78'6 , 𝑖 = 1, … , 34, and 𝑙 = 1, … ,8 . Let 𝑔, = % ∑%65" ℎ,6 , 𝑖 =
1, … , 34 be the average of the 𝑖 ./ row of the matrix 𝐻. Let 𝑈 be the normalized matrix of 𝐻
where 𝑢,6 =

/!&
9!

, 𝑖 = 1, … , 34, and 𝑙 = 1, … ,8. The output of the MAE is the forecasted number

of the new confirmed cases and is denoted as 𝑣J, = 𝑓L𝑢," , … . , 𝑢,%, 𝜃O, 𝑖 = 1, … ,34 , where 𝜃
represented the estimated parameters in the trained MAE. The one-step forecasting of the
number of the new confirmed cases of Covid-19 for each city is given by 𝑌:, = 𝑣J, 𝑔, , 𝑖 = 1, … , 34.
The recursive multiple-step forecasting involved using a one-step model multiple times where
the prediction for the preceding time step was used as an input for making a prediction on the
following time step. For example, for forecasting the number of the new confirmed cases for the
one more next day, the predicted number of new cases in one-step forecasting would be used as
an observational input in order to predict day 2. Repeat the above process to obtain the two-step
forecasting. The summation of the final forecasted number of the new confirmed cases for each
province/city was taken as the prediction of the total number of the new confirmed cases of
Covid-19 in China.
Clustering
The values of the latent variables in the second latent layer of the MAE for each province/city
were extracted. For each province/city, a 34 × 4 dimensional latent matrix 𝐴 were formed. The
largest single value 𝜆 of the latent matrix 𝐴 was obtained via single value decomposition. We
performed five-time trainings and obtained five largest single values. For each province/city, we
7

formed a feature vector that consisted of the five largest single values 𝜆𝑠, the starting day and the
forecasted end day of the Covid-19 outbreak, the day, the number of new confirmed cases
reaching the maximum, the largest number of the forecasted new confirmed cases and the
number of the forecasted accumulated confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the respective
province/city. The k-means algorithms were performed on the 34 feature vectors to group
provinces/cities into clusters.
Results
Figure 2 plotted the total number curves of the reported and forecasted cumulative and new
confirmed cases of Covid-19 in China as a function of days. The reported cases were from
January 11, 2020 to February 27, 2020. A total number of 47 days’ data were available. We
began to forecast on February 20, 2020. Figure 2 showed that the forecasting curve was close to
the reported curve. From Figure 2 it can be observed that the curve of the new confirmed cases
reached the 5,236 peak on February 5, 2020 and decreased to zero on April 20 (forecasting).
The potential cumulative confirmed cases of Covid-19 in China was observed to reach the
plateau (83,401) on April 20, 2020. Figure S1 plotted the national reported and fitted curves of
the cumulative confirmed cases in China from January 20, 2020 to February 27, 2020. To
further examine the accuracy of forecasting, Table 1 where the data from January 20, 2020 to
February 27, 2020 were used to fit the MAE model. In the table, we listed 1 day-step to 10 daystep forecasting errors, respectively, i.e., the errors of using the current reported cases to forecast
future s day cases. Table 1 showed that the average errors of the forecasting did not strictly
increase as the number-steps for forecasting increased due to fluctuations of the data. Forecasting
accuracy was very high.

Figure 3 presented the forecasted curves of cumulative confirmed cases of Covid-19 across 31
province/cities in mainland China and three other regions (Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan) in
China as a function of days from January 11, 2020 to April 20, 2020. We observed from Figure 3
that the times of different provinces/cities entering the plateau will be different, ranging from Jan
21, 2020 to April 20, 2020. Xizang first entered the plateau at Jan 21 followed by Macao on Jan
26 and Qinghai on Jan 28. Hubei province will be one of the last to enter the plateau (70,019)
around April 20, 2020, most provinces/cities will enter the plateau around middle of March. We
can also observe the different shapes of the curves among the provinces/cities, which imply
different dynamic patterns of the transmission of Covid-19 across the provinces/cities.
Many factors such as size of outflow population from Wuhan to each affected provinces/cities,
interventions, geographic locations, economic and social activities, environmental heterogeneity
and healthcare facility affect disease transmission dynamics across the country. Clustering its
temporal dynamics will provide numerous insights on patterns of propagation of Covid-19. To
further capture the dynamic pattern of Covid-19 spread across the provinces/cities, we presented
Figure 4 where 34 provinces/cities formed nine clusters. Since the spread of Covid-19 was
influenced by the pattern of contacts between individuals, clusters partially showed geographic
structure.
For example, Hubei province, a major source of Covid-19, formed a cluster. Followed by the
Anhui, Guangdong, Henan, Hunan, Jiangsu, Jiangxi and Zhejiang, which are in areas
surrounding pathogen sources (Hubei province). The Inner Mongolia, Xizang and Qinghai
cluster had the lowest number of cases and are in areas far away from the sources of Covid-19.
In addition to the geographic locations that affected the transmission of Covid-19, the healthcare
resources and economic and social activities may also affect the transmission dynamics of
9

Covid-19 as the cluster of Shanghai, Hongkong, Beijing, Shandong and Sichuan. And Fujian
Guangxi, Hebei, Jilin and Tianjin formed a cluster, but these five provinces/cities are not located
in the same geographic area. They may have similar economic relationships with Wuhan,
healthcare resources and take similar interventions to control of the spread of Covid-19.
Discussion
As an alternative to epidemiologic transmission model, we used MAE to forecast the real-time
trajectory of the transmission dynamics and generate the real-time forecasts of Covid-19 across
the provinces/cities in China. The results showed that the accuracies of prediction and
subsequently multiple-step forecasting were high. Our experience revealed that forecasting
improves when the training time was longer. We estimated the potential time points of
decreasing growth of new confirmed case curves across 34 provinces/cities, the lengths of the
Cov-19 epidemics across China, and the times when the number of accumulated confirmed
cases of Covid-19 would reach the plateau of their accumulate case curves. If the data are
reliable and there will be no second transmission, the MAE models predicted that the Covid-19
outbreak in China might be over in the middle of April. In this study, we used cluster analysis
to group 34 provinces/cities into 9 clusters and explore their geographic and healthcare resource
structures.
The MAE models allow inputting the interventions information and investigating the impact of
interventions on the size of the virus outbreak and end time of the virus outbreak. However, we
have not explored such functions of the MAE due to lack of data. Similar to epidemiologic
transmission dynamic models, the MAE can also be used for simulations. The trained MAE can
well approximate many dynamic processes. Using the hypothesized initial sizes of the epidemic
outbreak, we can use the MAE with known parameters and architecture to estimate the sizes of
10

outbreak in the future and simulate the impact of the interventions on the sizes and severity of
the epidemics. Complimentary to a model approach to transmission dynamics of virus outbreaks,
the data driven AI-based methods provide real time forecasting tools for tracking, estimating the
trajectory of epidemics, assessing their severity, predicting the lengths of epidemics and assisting
government and health workers to make plan and good decisions.
