Abstract
’Lockdown’ periods in response to COVID-19 have provided a unique opportunity to study the impacts of economic activity on environmental pollution
(e.g. NO2 , aerosols, noise, light). The effects on NO2 and aerosols have been
very noticeable and readily demonstrated, but that on light pollution has proven
challenging to determine. The main reason for this difficulty is that the primary
source of nighttime satellite imagery of the earth is the SNPP-VIIRS/DNB instrument, which acquires data late at night after most human nocturnal activity
has already occurred and much associated lighting has been turned off. Here,
to analyze the effect of lockdown on urban light emissions, we use ground and
satellite data for Granada, Spain, during the COVID-19 induced confinement
of the city’s population from March 14 until May 31, 2020. We find a clear
decrease in light pollution due both to a decrease in light emissions from the
city and to a decrease in anthropogenic aerosol content in the atmosphere which
resulted in less light being scattered. A clear correlation between the abundance
of PM10 particles and sky brightness is observed, such that the more polluted

determined that relates PM10 particle abundance and sky brightness at three
different wavelength bands.

1. Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused dramatic changes in human habits
and activities across much of the world. This has been especially true during
so-called ’lockdown’ periods, when the local, regional or national activities and
movements of people have been markedly curtailed to reduce rates and levels of viral transmission. The details of these restrictions, and the extent and
vigour with which they have been enforced, have varied greatly between different
countries. Nonetheless, these unusual situations have acted as valuable ’natural experiments’, allowing novel analyses to be conducted of the relationships
between levels of human activity and levels of damage to the environment, by
comparing important potential impacts prior to and during lockdown periods.
For example, this has been done for NO2 concentrations in urban areas and
globally for aerosol content (NASA, 2020a,b), noise (Bui and Badger, 2020),
and seismic tremors (Xiao et al., 2020). Also, the impact of lockdown on night
sky brightness in Berlin has been studied (Jechow and Hölker, 2020).
Many of the environmental impacts of human activity, and hence the effects
of the lockdown periods, can be monitored remotely through satellites. However, perhaps surprisingly, this has proven challenging to do at large regional
or global scales for nighttime light emissions, which have been recognised as
both a valuable indicator of human population density, urbanisation and economic activity (Small and Elvidge, 2013; Levin and Zhang, 2017), and also
as themselves having important impacts on human health and the natural environment (Rich and Longcore, 2013; Gaston et al., 2013; Koo et al., 2016;
Falchi et al., 2011). The primary source of remote sensing data on nighttime

2

light emissions is the Suomi-North Polar Partnership/Visible Infrared Imaging
Radiometer Suite-DayNightBand (SNPP/VIIRS-DNB). This provides data of
intermediate spatial resolution using a panchromatic sensor, but its observation
time is after 01:30 local time limiting its usefulness for determining changes
in nighttime lighting at times when people are predominantly active. Sensors
are also carried on other satellite platforms, but variously have limited spatial
coverage, require substantial data calibration, and/or are private and with data
costs that are prohibitive for monitoring for research purposes (Levin et al.,
2020). Images of the earth taken by astronauts aboard the International Space
Station (ISS) using DSLR cameras are also available, have high resolution and
are multi-spectral, but are not systematically acquired in space or time, also
greatly limiting their suitability.
Accepting these limitations on a broad scale places disproportionate significance on ground-based measurements of changes in artificial nighttime lighting
as a means of determining the effects of COVID-19 lockdown periods. Unfortunately, the availability of such data is quite limited, although there are ongoing
attempts both to build and maintain networks of monitoring sensors (Cheung
et al., 2015; Zamorano et al., 2016) and to provide platforms to encourage and
collate regular spot measurements by citizen scientists (Walker et al., 2008).
Here we determine the impacts of a COVID-19 lockdown on artificial nighttime light emissions for an exemplar, the city of Granada, Spain, using both
satellite and ground-based measurements. In Spain the general lockdown, which
started on March 14th 2020, was particularly severe to counteract a steep rate
of spread of the infection.

2. Methods
2.1. Satellite data
For satellite images of Granada we used the SNPP-VIIRS/DNB VNP46A1
product (Román et al., 2018). Details on the image processing undertaken
are provided in Román et al. (2018), but briefly, images were corrected for

3

atmospheric, topographic and cloud effects. Radiometric calibration was carried
out but seasonal and moon effects were not taken into account. Therefore, for
this paper, images with no moon illumination were selected, considering only
those taken two days prior or two days after the new moon, and only images
obtained in January to May were used. Only 27 images in total fulfilled these
selection criteria: 5 images for 2018, 7 images for 2019 and 14 images for 2020.
Of this last group, 6 images were obtained before the lockdown and 8 during the
lockdown. In some months, such as April, only two images were available, due
to cloud cover (AEMET, 2020). The images were manually inspected to detect
any kind of cloud or fog features (blurriness) or anomalous dimming that could
be explained by image acquisition at very shallow angles. The photometry was
performed using ”FunTools” (Mandel et al., 2011) and the visualization was
done with SAO-DS9 (Joye and Mandel, 2003).
2.2. Ground-based sky brightness measurements
In order to measure sky brightness from the ground we used a set of Sky
Quality Meters (SQMs; Unihedron). SQMs (Cinzano (2005); Hänel et al. (2018))
measure night sky brightness and have been used in a large number of studies
directly or indirectly concerned with light pollution (Falchi et al. (2016); Kyba
et al. (2015); Sánchez de Miguel et al. (2017)). They have a spectral response
from 320–700 nm, approximately overlapping the Johnson B and V bands used
in astronomical photometry. We used the SQM-LE model, a lensed version
with Ethernet connection whose lens reduces the angular sensitivity to ∼20º
(full width at half maximum, FWHM) around the zenith. The SQM photometers directly provide data in mag/arcsec2 with a systematic error of 10 per cent
(0.1 mag/arcsec2 ) according to the manufacturer. All these sensors were cross
calibrated with the All-Sky Transmission MONitor (ASTMON) for their respective bands. As Cinzano (2005) have showed, the SQM with B Johnson and V
Johnson filters are very good match to the pure B Johnson and V Johnson filters astronomical filters. So, this calibration error is mainly for the non filtered
SQM and not for the cross calibrated ones, that probably can achieve better
4

performance. Note that the mag/arcsec2 scale used in astronomy is somewhat
counter-intuitive for people outside the field because it is logarithmic, and because the brighter the sky the smaller the value.
The set of SQMs consisted of three devices situated on the roof of the Instituto de Astrofı́sica de Andalucı́a-CSIC (IAA-CSIC) (lat = N 37.1616º, long
= W 3.59036º, h = 685 meters above mean sea level) located inside the city
of Granada. Two were equipped with specific B and V Johnson band filters,
whereas the other one was used without any filter. All devices were weatherproof to protect them from outdoor conditions. Each SQM sent data through
the internet to a Raspberry Pi unit for storage and time-tagging and made
about 1000 recordings of sky brightness over a night. We used the open-source
software PySQM (Nievas Rosillo and Zamorano, 2014) for these operations.
In addition, the Sierra Nevada Observatory, located more than 2000 meters
above and more than 20 km away from the city of Granada (lat = N 37.0642º,
long = W 3.38472º, h = 2900 mamsl), is equipped with an ASTMON (All-Sky
Transmission MONitor), an imaging device that measures sky brightness in the
UBVRI Johnson bands at all-sky locations (Aceituno et al., 2011), not just at
the zenith. The instrument is fully robotic, i.e., it performs all astronomical data
reduction and calibration tasks automatically, obtaining maps of sky brightness
through the night. For this study, we selected the values of sky brightness at
an azimuth and altitude where the glow of Granada’s city is clearly observed
(∼25º above the horizon) as shown in figure 1. Locations are shown in figure 2.
We analyzed data from January, February and until March 14 2020 to represent the conditions prior to the lockdown, and data from March 14 until May
23 to represent the lockdown conditions. Sky brightness data are extremely
sensitive to cloud cover and lunar phase. In astronomy, sky brightness measurements are reported only for moonless nights and for completely cloudless
nights. For this study, we did the same. Cloudless nights were selected following
the criterion that there was no flickering in the measurements with a standard
deviation of 0.10 mag. Sky brightness is usually measured at the zenith. Unfortunately, not all of the measurements reported in the literature specify whether

two domes.

these are of the sky background (removing the stellar contribution) or of the
night sky containing stars. SQMs do not correct for starlight contribution. The
stellar contribution might seem negligible but it is not, at least for regions with
little light pollution, and this is especially relevant when the Milky Way or
other dense stellar regions fall within the viewing cone of SQMs. To estimate
this ”seasonal” effect from our measurements, we analyzed SQM data from our
remote observatory at La Sagra (lat = N 37.98º , long = W 2.56º, h = 1530
mamsl) which has minimal light pollution in order to determine the amount
of change from the period of January-February to the lockdown period. We
used data for 3 years to have a robust estimation that would not be affected by
weather conditions. See Appendix A.

Station on February 6th 2012 and geo-referenced, with the gray lines delimiting different
administrative regions. The red stars indicate the positions of the sensors used in this paper.

2.3. Pollution data
Atmospheric pollution data were obtained from the measuring station of the
Granada Congress Palace, published by the Junta de Andalucı́a and available
on the Granada City Council website (Ayto.Granada, 2020). These data were
used as the station is the closest to the IAA headquarters (coord. UTM: X
= 446721, Y = 4113421). We focused on the concentration of PM10 particles
(particles with diameter < 10µm) and nitrogen dioxide, two pollutants directly
related to vehicle emissions and therefore to urban activity. The concentration
values (µg/m3 ) were obtained every hour, so in order to study possible correlations with the brightness of the sky we selected the measurements of the SQM
devices installed in the IAA-CSIC and the ASTMON of the OSN (at a point approximately 25º above the city of Granada) with different filters, at valid nights
and coinciding in time with the measurements of the concentration of particles
7

and nitrogen dioxide. Thus we gathered a sample of 137 measurements in the
night hours distributed from January to May 2020.

3. Results
3.1. Satellite data
Figure 3 shows a comparison of satellite imagery of Granada on clear and
moonless nights prior to lockdown and during lockdown. Quantitative analysis
indicates that the average intensity of emissions decreased by around 10% ± 5%
during the lockdown. Comparison of 2018 and 2019 data indicate similar emissions values, although Granada has an ongoing municipal program of transition
from High Pressure Sodium (HPS) to LED lighting, so this can only be considered as a lower threshold of change. The dispersion of the day to day intensity
observations is of 14%, although it is worth mentioning that the lowest values of
the series occurred during the lockdown. The brightest individual light source
in Granada (indicated as ”Nevada” in the figure), which was lit up constantly
during the lockdown is not visible on many of the images because of the angle of
observation. This illustrates the important role of the angle of observations in
these measurements. Some other research has not consider this potential issue
(Liu et al., 2020; Elvidge et al., 2020; Ghosh et al., 2020).
3.2. Ground-based data
3.2.1. Measurements comparing two time intervals on different nights
As a first approach to analysing the SQM data, values were compared for two
time intervals, one before midnight (from 21:00 to 22:00 UT) and another one
after midnight (from 2:00 to 3:00 UT). This has been done to see if the changes
in lighting and those associated with the decrease in activity are reflected in any
way in the values of sky brightness in different filters, taking into account that
part of the ornamental lighting is turned off in the second half of the night and
that the intensity of the general lighting decreases after legal midnight. Figure
4 shows the average values of sky brightness from the IAA headquarters in the

two time intervals mentioned and at the valid nights, and the average of the
B-V colour index which results from subtracting the measurements obtained
with the two filters in these time intervals.
We have defined two groups of data based on the pandemic’s policies in
Spain: from the months of January (26th) and last week of February (19th to
26th); and from the months of April (15th, 22nd, 23rd, 28th, 29th and 30th) and
May (17th to 22nd). The first group corresponds to pre-lockdown sky brightness
and the second to sky brightness obtained at the time of lockdown. The first
thing to note is that both in the brightness measurement and in the B-V index
there is a clear difference between the first hours of the night and the last hours,
especially before lockdown: from 21:00 to 22:00 UT the night sky of Granada is
on average 0.57 mag/arcsec2 brighter than from 2:00 to 3:00 UT. Similarly, the
average value of B-V is higher from 2:00 to 3:00 UT (B-V 1.30 before midnight
and 1.10 after midnight before the lockdown, so a 0.2 mag difference).
The variation in the colour index suggests that this is a consequence of the
turning off of ornamental lighting (examples are the Alhambra Palace illumina-

brightness.

tion and facade illuminations of several monuments) and private lighting (aka.
cars, private outdoor lighting, commercial lighting and indoor lighting), as most
of the lamps used for ornamental lighting and private outdoor lighting are metal
halide lamps, or have been replaced by LED that produce white or blue-white
light with a significant emission in blue, so that once they are switched off the
records of the photometer with B filter are significantly higher (due to the lower
brightness in this band). This effect has been documented before in many other
cities, like Berlin or Madrid (Kyba et al. (2012); Sánchez de Miguel (2015); Bará
et al. (2019)).
This difference between night hours also occurred during the lockdown, although to a lesser extent. During lockdown, the Granada sky between 21:00
and 22:00 UT was on average 0.31 mag/arcsec2 brighter than 2:00 to 3:00 UT,
while in the B-V index there was a difference of 0.14.
If we compare the days before and during the lockdown, the Granada sky
10

between 21:00 and 22:00 UT was 0.33 mag/arcsec2 darker after its declaration;
the difference was 0.08 mag/arcsec2 from 3:00 to 4:00. For the B-V index the
differences were greater in the first half of the night (0.14) than in the early
morning hours (0.08).
3.2.2. Evolution of measurements during the night. Average nights before and
during lockdown
Instead of analysing the average values in time periods before and after
midnight, the average variation between 23:00 and 4:00 (legal time: UTC+1)
of the brightness of the Granada sky and its colour index can be compared
between February and April and May (legal time UTC+2). The average curve
for the last week of February represents a more or less progressive darkening
over the course of the night from 18.2 mag/arcsec2 to over 18.6 at 4:00, with a
steeper slope until midnight and then smoothing out (see figure 5). There are
three steps or “jumps” in the curve: the first (and greatest) occurs at about
23:00; the second occurs at 00:00 (midnight legal time) and is less noticeable
than the other two; and the third one occurs at 2:00. If we look at the B-V
curve, the 2:00 step appears while the others are not so clear. It also appears on
the curve for the days following the lockdown (summer time: UTC+2). We can
infer that at that time some important lighting with a considerable emission in
the blue band is switched off . The other steps may be related to a decrease in
the intensity of public lighting, although in B-V a slight darkening can also be
seen at midnight.
The curves for the days following the lockdown show a greater divergence
from the previous period in the early hours of the night, with higher values
both in darkness (between 18.4 and 18.6 mag/arcsec2 ) and in B-V (close to
1.3). In this case the legal midnight step is much more pronounced. If this is
due to a decrease in the intensity of street lighting, it is interesting that before
the lockdown this was not so clearly seen. The behaviour of the B-V graph can
give some clues: before the lockdown it starts from values between 1.1 and 1.2
without exceeding 1.2 until after midnight, while in April it stays close to 1.3

11

until it reaches 1.4 in the second half of the night. In the first case, there is
a greater brightness in filter B, which also decreases progressively as the night
progresses, producing only a jump of some importance at 2:00.

function of time. Right: night-averaged B-V index. Photometers located at IAA-CSIC headquarters in Granada.

3.2.3. Evolution of air pollution and sky brightness
Both particulate PM10 and nitrogen dioxide concentrations were highest in
the hours before midnight of the days prior to lockdown, while the lowest values
occurred in the early morning and during lockdown (Figure 6 and table 1).
Similarly, the Granada sky was darker at zenith during the early morning hours
on days of lockdown and, conversely, brighter during the first nighttime hours
prior to lockdown. The differences are less if we compare the hours after 00:00.
In the case of measurements obtained with the ASTMON device the differences
are less significant. Only in the B band a darkening of 0.12 mag/arcsec2 is
observed comparing the first hours of the night before and after the declaration
of the lockdown.
The strongest correlations occur between the concentration of PM10 particles and the brightness of the sky SQM without filter and SQM with filter V

and lockdown state. Right: sky brightness (in mag/arcsec2 ) depending on time and lockdown

(ρ = −0.84), where ρ is the Spearman correlation index (see tables B.2 and B.3
in Appendix B). Also noteworthy is the correlation between nitrogen dioxide
concentration and sky brightness in the B-band (SQMB ) (ρ = −0.81), and with
the B-V colour index (ρ = −0.77). The variables most related to the hour of the
night (aka. proxy of human activity) of measurement are those corresponding to
the sky brightness in all filters. This effect would dominate (higher correlation)
versus air pollution (particle concentration).
In the case of ASTMON device measurements, there are also correlations
between sky brightness and air pollution variables, although they are weaker
than those described above. The best correlations occur between the measurements obtained in the B band and the concentrations of NO2 (ρ = −0.66) and
PM10 (ρ = −0.64). Although these results are significant, we have focused
on the measures obtained within the city of Granada, as they present stronger
correlations, especially for PM10 particle concentration.

the sky brightness value (SQM without filter). The upper left hand area of

the graph (darker sky and lower particle concentration) is mostly occupied by
measurements taken after 00:00 (legal time) during lockdown, to which the lower
NO2 concentration values correspond. In contrast, the lower right zone (higher
particle concentration and brighter sky) corresponds to hours before midnight
on days prior to the declaration of the alarm state, and which are associated
with higher NO2 concentration values.
The linear fitting equations for measurements of sky brightness within Granada
on different filters and the PM10 particle concentration values are:
SQM (no filter)

f (x) = 18.91(2) − 0.0179(8)x

SQM (filter V)

f (x) = 18.62(2) − 0.0176(8)x

SQM (filter B)

f (x) = 20.02(4) − 0.0227(1)x

(f(x): sky brightness in mag/arcsec2 ; x: PM10 particle concentration in µg/m3 )

See tables C.4, C.5 y C.6 (Appendix C) for errors, residuals and F-statistic.

(blue symbols) depending on time slot (triangles for the first half of the nights, dots for the
second half of the nights). The PM10 concentration and SQM values are coinciding in time
(every hour).

The correlation between sky brightness and particulate air pollution is also
evident by performing a multivariate analysis, including time as a third dimension. Variations in urban lighting depend mainly on the time of night, and
therefore can be expected to influence the sky brightness values. On the other
hand, pollution levels depend on human activity, which varies throughout the
night. Thus, we have calculated a model that estimates a value of sky brightness
as a function of time (as a fraction of a Julian day) and particle concentration.

before and during lockdown. Figure 8 shows the model fitting for the unfiltered
SQM photometer.

are:

4. Discussion
4.1. Correlation of sky brightness and PM10 particle abundance
In figure 7 we show the sky brightness as a function of PM10 particle abundance measured in Granada from a station located around 1 km away from the
site where the sky brightness measurements are taken. The altitude above sea
level of the site is almost identical to that of the light pollution station.
Note that in that plot, the sky brightness measurements have not been corrected by the “seasonal” effects of the milky way entering the field of view of
the SQMs, but as pointed out in Appendix A this can reach a 6% contribution
at most.
The correlation is obvious in the plot. Although the sky brightness can
depend on many factors, it is clear that one of the main factors is the aerosol
content. This is something that was expected from a physical point of view.
Garstang (1991) explicitly mentioned that the sky brightness seen close to
the center of a city increases with the atmospheric aerosol content, according
to Garstang (1986) simple radiative transfer models. Indeed, this is what we
observe in figure 8. The correlation of the sky brightness in magnitudes is
linear with the PM10 concentration, which also makes sense given that the
single scattering flux is proportional to eτ , where τ is optical thickness and τ is
proportional to the particle concentration.
4.2. Disentangling the effect of the net reduction in light emission from the effect
of the decreased aerosol content
We have seen that sky brightness depends both on aerosol content and on the
time since the beginning of the night (the higher the aerosol particle concentration the higher the brightness and the earlier at night the higher the brightness).
In this section we analyze the two correlations in terms of linear correlation in
two variables and we have done that with data prior to lockdown and during
lockdown.
From those fits, we can determine the night sky brightness for a reference
particle concentration of 30 µgm−3 and at 19.2 UT (t = 0.3 as a fraction of
17

a julian day), prior to lockdown and during lockdown. The values are 18.04
mag/arcsec2 and 18.29 mag/arcsec2 before and during the confinement respectively. This means that at the same aerosol content and same time at night
conditions, the confinement period was darker by 0.25 mag /arcsec2 due to
a decrease of the light output from the city. If we take into account that the
brightness of the sky is around 5% higher in the period of time prior to lockdown
due to higher star density getting in the detector, an approximate estimation of
the decrease in the light output of the city is around 20 per cent. This percentage is probably related to the reduction in light from vehicles and from private
lighting.
In the B band, the differences are more remarkable: Prior to lockdown:
18.77 mag/arcsec2 . During lockdown 19.28 mag/arcsec2 . This means that approximately a 45% reduction in the light output of the city is derived from our
data.
Note that private lighting is a significant contributor to light pollution (Kyba
et al., 2020), and is usually bluer than municipal lighting, at least in some cities
where cold led lighting is not extended yet. This indicates that the blue band
night sky brightness appears to be a better human activity indicator than the
sky brightness in the visible channel. Even though the outdoor human activities
dropped by more than 90%, the light output of the city did not decrease by that
amount, clearly pointing out that most of the city lighting does not adapt to
the real use of its citizens. This shows why measurements from VIIRS are not
optimal to trace the pandemic effects on the economy because of the flyby time
of the satellite. An instrument with an earlier flyby time is urgently needed to
track changes in urban light emissions.

5. Conclusions
We found a clear decrease in light pollution (as measured in terms of sky
brightness) within the city of Granada during the lockdown. Also, the sky glow
from Granada as seen at a particular angle of 25 degrees outside the city, from

18

Sierra Nevada observatory, decreased. The observations are consistent with the
idea that the decrease arose for two reasons. First, this was because of a decrease
in scattered light due to the presence of fewer anthropogenic aerosols during the
lockdown. In this regard, a clear correlation is found between sky brightness at
several wavelength bands and PM10 particle concentration measured within the
city. Outside the city at 25 degrees, the correlation coefficient with the PM10
particle concentration in Granada is lower, which makes sense given that the
aerosols that contribute are not constrained to the downtown area. The other
main reason for the reduction in the light pollution comes from a decrease in
the net amount of light emitted by the city at the level of 20% in the visible and
45% in the B band, probably due to a decrease in private lighting of buildings,
vehicle lights and lighting of private areas, mainly observable at the start of the
night. Very late at night, the flux from the city during lockdown and prior to
it was almost unchanged. Satellite imagery does not show marked differences
during the lockdown in terms of total light output (at the 10% precision level)
because these images were obtained late at night, consistent with the ground
based data, which show little change in the second half of the night. Given that
outdoor activities decreased by up to 90% during lockdown, our results indicate
that the light output of the city seems to be dominated by permanent lighting
that does not adapt to the real use of the outdoor areas by the citizens (at least
in the case of Granada), pointing out a clear waste of energy and resources.

Appendices
Appendix A. Measurements of the observatory of La Sagra
The observatory of La Sagra is located in one of the darkest areas of Spain,
so the low impact of light pollution allows the use of measurements taken from
its location as a reference to identify the natural variations in sky brightness
at the zenith between different time intervals and months. For this purpose,
we have studied the data collected since 2018 by a SQM device (without added
filter), selecting the valid nights of the months of February, April and May in
the same time bands as for the measurements in Granada.
Figure A.9 shows the average brightness of the sky from 21:00 to 22:00 and
from 2:00 to 3:00 UT for a total of 30 nights (14 distributed in February and
16 in April and May). During February, in the time band before midnight the
sky at the zenith is 0.28 mag/arcsec2 brighter than in the early morning hours.
In spring the situation is the opposite (although the difference is very small):
from 2:00 to 3:00 is 0.05 mag/arcsec2 brighter than from 21:00 to 22:00 UT. If
we compare the same time range, we see that from 21:00 to 22:00 UT the sky
is 0.27 mag/arcsec2 darker in the spring months while from 3:00 to 4:00 UT it
is 0.06 mag/arcsec2 brighter than in February.
It is clear that there is a natural variation of sky brightness at the zenith
due to the transit of different regions with different densities of stars. But to
what extent are these variations perceptible in a urban environment? In order
to understand this, it is necessary to put these differences into context, since
in La Sagra they occur with values between 21.70 and 22 mag/arcsec2 , in a
sky of exceptional darkness, while in the city of Granada there is an artificial
brightness which means that even in the best conditions the 19 mag/arcsec2 are
not reached. In terms of light intensity per unit area (mcd/m2 ), a difference of
0.30 mag/arcsec2 in La Sagra is approximately 0.061 mcd/m2 , while a difference
of 0.30 mag/arcsec2 in the city of Granada is 1 mcd/m2 . In other words, in
terms of luminance, the hourly or seasonal variation of the natural brightness

of the sky cannot account for more than 6.1% of the differences observed in the
city of Granada (Falchi et al., 2016) taken from LightPollutionMap (2020) web.
Similarly, the hourly evolution of the average of the records of sky brightness
at La Sagra for February and the months of April and May (2018-2019) can be
taken as a reference of the natural variation due to the transit of different star
fields through the zenith. But this is not significant in the case of the urban
measurements obtained from IAA-CSIC, as the higher luminance of artificial
origin masks the natural variations by almost 95%.
