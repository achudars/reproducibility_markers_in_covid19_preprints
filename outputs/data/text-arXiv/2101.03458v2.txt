Abstract
The objective of this study was to investigate the importance of multiple county-level
features in the trajectory of COVID-19. We examined feature importance across 2,787 counties in
the United States using data-driven machine learning models. Existing mathematical models of
disease spread usually focus on case prediction with different infection rates without incorporating
multiple heterogeneous features that could impact the spatial and temporal trajectory of COVID19 in different stages. Recognizing this, we trained random forest models using 23 features
representing six key influencing factors affecting pandemic spread: social demographics of
counties, population activities, mobility within the counties, movement across counties, disease
attributes, and social network structure. Also, we categorized counties into multiple groups
according to their population densities, and we divided the trajectory of COVID-19 into three
stages: the outbreak stage, the social distancing stage, and the reopening stage. The study aims to
answer two research questions: (1) The extent to which the importance of heterogeneous features
evolves in different stages; (2) The extent to which the importance of heterogeneous features varies
across counties with different characteristics. We fitted a set of random forest models to determine
weekly feature importance. The results showed that: (1) Social demographic features, such as gross
domestic product, population density, and minority status maintained high-importance features
throughout stages of COVID-19 across the 2787 studied counties; (2) Within-county mobility
features had the highest importance in county clusters with higher population densities; (3) The
feature reflecting the social network structure (Facebook, social connectedness index), had higher
importance in the models for counties with higher population densities. The results show that the
data-driven machine learning models could provide important insights to inform policymakers
1

regarding feature importance for counties with various population densities and in different stages
of a pandemic life cycle.
Introduction
COVID-19 has inflicted great loss in both economic and social dimensions. To inform
pandemic situations, several studies developed mathematic models to predict the outbreak and
trajectory of pandemics to provide important insights for use by policymakers for developing
pandemic control measures. For example, Tizzoni et al. 1 predicted the epidemic spread among
three European countries using a susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) model that accounted for
human mobility. Balcan et al. 2 used the mathematical model to study global pandemic dynamics
considering long-range and short-range mobility patterns. Ferguson et al. 3 developed the
transmission model to test the effects of epidemic control measures (e.g., social distancing) with
different virus reproduction rates. Wang et al. 4 developed a deep learning model to predict
epidemic transmission using within-season and between-season observations as features. For the
COVID-19 pandemic, many studies developed mathematical models to evaluate containment
measures and to predict the potential outbreak and trajectory of COVID-19. Anastassopoulou et
al. predicted the evolution of the spread of COVID-19 based on a Susceptible-InfectiousRecovered-Deceased (SIRD) model and the estimation of the reproduction number (R0) 5. Block
et al. 6 simulated community spread scenarios of COVID-19 based on social network structures.
Chang et al. 7 integrated the standard Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model
with the origin-destination mobility networks to fit the trajectory of COVID-19 and predicted
infections in the reopening stage. Gatto et al. 8 also used the standard SEIR model to evaluate the
effectiveness of COVID-19 containment measures (such as mobility reduction and social
distancing). Cintia et al. 9 used a regression model to investigate the relationship between human
mobility and the transmission of COVID-19 in Italy. Perc et al. 10 used a simple iteration that relied
only on confirmed cases to forecast the spread of COVID-19 in the United States, Slovenia, Iran,
and Germany. Petropoulos and Makridakis 11 implemented a simple time-series forecasting to
predict the spread of COVID-19 based on the data of confirmed cases, deaths and recoveries.
Tomar and Gupta 12 used the LSTM model to predict the spread of COVID-19 in India and
discussed the effectiveness of pandemic control measures, such as social distancing and lockdown.
Chimmula and Zhang 13 also developed Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) deep learning model
to predict the transmission of COVID-19 in Canada. The existing mathematical models seek to
predict the trajectory of epidemics/pandemics based on a limited number of features, such as
mobility patterns, reproduction rates of virus, observations within and between seasons, number
of confirmed cases, deaths and recoveries. Most of the existing mathematical models, however,
could account for only a limited number of features and could not simultaneously examine the
importance of heterogeneous features, such as social demographics, population activities, mobility
patterns, disease-related attributes, and social network structure-based various datasets.
Various studies related to COVID-19 have highlighted multiple influencing factors that
would affect the pandemic spread. Dowd et al. 14 highlighted the importance of social and
demographics attributes (mainly focusing on age structures of populations) affecting infection
rates in populations. Nepomuceno et al. 15 found that other demographic factors could affect the
spread of COVID-19. Multiple studies have reported the effects of population density 16,17,
household size and composition, hygienic and sanitary conditions, access to healthcare services,
case notification systems, and economic disparities 18 on the trajectory of the COVID-19 infections.
Yancy 19, Dyer 20, Laurencin 21, and Millett et al. 22 pointed out the racial and ethnic disparities of
2

COVID-19 that hit minorities harder. In addition to the social and demographic factors, additional
studies have reported the role of population activities, such as visits to points of interests (e.g.,
hospitals, restaurants and recreation centers) 23–25 and staying at home 26–28 as they affect
transmission risks of COVID-19. Kraemer et al. 29, Badr et al. 30, Jia et al. 31, Linka et al. 32 and
Askitas et al. 33 investigated the extent to which mobility patterns would affect the spread of
COVID-19. Liu et al. 34, Zhang et al. 35, You et al. 36, and Shim et al. 37 examined the effects of
disease attributes, such as the reproduction number, R0, on the trajectory of COVID-19.
Furthermore, Bucur 38, Block et al. 6, and Kuchler et al. 39 discussed how the social network
structures would affect the spread of COVID-19 in communities. A recent deep learning model
proposed by Ramchandani et al. 40 accounted for several heterogeneous features (e.g., social
demographics, population activities, and mobility pattern). While the existing studies inform about
various heterogenous features affecting the trajectory of COVID-19 spread, limited knowledge
exists about the importance of these features across different cities and communities and at
different stages of the pandemic spread. For example, mobility restriction orders may have greater
effect on counties with higher population densities 41, and long-distance mobility restriction orders
are more effective in the outbreak stage of the epidemic, while local control measures, such as
shelter-in-place and social distancing orders, would be more effective after the outbreak stage 29.
Unraveling the importance of various features in the trajectory of pandemics is a critical element
for predictive surveillance and data-driven policy formulation. Hence, to address this important
knowledge gap, we aim to answer two research questions in this paper: (1) The extent to which
the importance of heterogeneous features evolved in different stages (e.g., outbreak stage, social
distancing stage, and reopening stage); (2) The extent to which the importance of heterogeneous
features varied across counties with different characteristics.
To answer these two research questions, we examined 23 features related to social
demographics, population activities, mobility, social network structure, and disease-related
attributes. We collected features of 2787 counties from March 24 to June 23, 2020, during the
outbreak stage, the social distancing stage, and the reopening stage of COVID-19 pandemic.
Table 1 provides a summary of the examined features and their underlying data. (Refer to the
supplemental materials for the elaboration of each feature and of data sources.) Based on these
features, we built a set of data-driven random forest models to study the dynamics of importance
of each feature during different stages of COVID-19, and we evaluated the importance across
counties with different population densities. We would like to note that the purpose of this paper
is not to build a state-of-the-art prediction model of COVID-19, although the data-driven model
could be a complementary tool to prediction models.

Methodology
For each week from March 24, 2020, to June 23, 2020, we created five random forest
classifier models with ten-fold cross validation using 23 county-level features. Each model was
trained and tested for each week in the studied period to investigate the evolution of feature
importance during the COVID-19 pandemic. Different random forest models tend to divide
counties into clusters based on population densities. Population density is shown to be a dominant
feature affecting the number of infected cases. To examine the effects of features other than
population density, we created models for clusters of counties with varying population densities.
Fig. 1 illustrates included features and counties in five sets of random forest models. Fig. 2
illustrates clusters of counties with varying population densities in models. We explain each
random forest model in the following sub-sections.

Fig. 2 County population densities
Two base models
We built two base random forest models. Model 1 includes all 23 features as independent
variables; model 2 excludes population density, to enable assessment of the effect of other features
in the absence of population density. The base models include 2787 counties in the United States.
The dependent variable in each base model is composed of five classifications of the weekly new
confirmed cases per 100,000 population (CPP) for each county provided by Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention and Johns Hopkins University. For each week, we put counties with zero
CPP in one classification. Then, we evenly divided the rest of counties into four classifications
based on quantiles of CPP. Figure S1 in the supplemental materials illustrates histograms of the
five classifications in each week. We used these two models as the baseline to compare feature
importance in other models.
Models of counties with different population densities
This set of random forest models include models 3, 4 and 5. Each model comprises 279
counties with top 10 (model 3), top 10 to top 20 (model 4), and top 20 to top 30 (model 5) percent
of population densities among the 2787 counties. The dependent variable in these models is the
same as that in the base models (i.e., five classifications based on the CPP in each week). The
independent variables in this set of models include 22 features, excluding population density of
each county. We used this set of models to examine feature importance of counties across different
population density clusters.
We examined the results of feature importance of each weekly model. Random forest
modeling uses aggregated decreases in Gini importance of features to determine feature
importance based on Equations 1through 5 42,43. A greater aggregated decrease in a feature implies
that the feature is more important.

Note that previous studies showed that feature importance based on the reduction of Gini
importance would perform worse for categorical features, and some studies proposed new
algorithms to correct the bias 44–46. In this paper, we still used the reduction of Gini importance
due to the features in our models are all numerical features.
Results
We found disparate patterns of feature importance at different stages of the COVID-19
pandemic and across counties with different population densities. Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 illustrate the
ranks of feature importance in model 1 and model 2, which include all 2,787 counties (Refer to
the supplemental materials for information about the accuracy of the random forest models.) Note
that some models have relatively low accuracy on the test dataset, especially models with 279
counties (models 3, 4, and 5) with different population densities. The selected Gini feature
importance, however, is calculated based on the training dataset, which had high accuracies 42.
Therefore, the examined feature importance in this study could still provide insights regarding to
what extent the features are important to classify and separate the counties based on CPP.

Feature importance in models 3 and 4:

7

We can observe from Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 that ranks of feature importance of models 1 and 2
are quite close. Some features retained high importance while some features showed varied
importance in different stages of the COVID-19 pandemic.
A. Features keeping high importance across stages:
We can find that gross domestic product (GDP), population density, and social
connectedness index (SCI) maintained high feature importance across all stages of COVID-19 in
models 1 and 2, both of which include all 2787 counties. Population density stayed within the top
two most important features, while GDP and SCI stayed in the top 5 most important features.
Although we removed the influence of population size in the weekly confirmed cases—we
considered confirmed cases per 100,000 population—the results of feature importance still
indicate that population density has a significant impact on CPP. This is consistent with the results
of existing studies that examined the effects of population density on the spread of COVID-19 16,17.
GDP is another important social demographic variable. GDP would highly affect other social
demographic variables, such as household size and composition, hygienic and sanitary conditions,
access to healthcare services, case notification systems, and economic disparities. Existing
research has highlighted the importance of these social demographic variables in the spread of the
COVID-19 pandemic 15. Furthermore, SCI captures the effects of social networks; the result
indicates that social networks greatly affect the risks of virus spread during all stages of the
pandemic. This result is consistent with existing studies that more connected social network
structures are at a greater risk of virus spread during the pandemic 6,38,39.
B. Features showing increasing importance across stages:
We can observe that the importance of reproduction number (R0), minority status,
socioeconomic status, and COVID-19 community vulnerability index (CCVI), all of which
showed increasing importance across stages.
R0 was of low importance in the outbreak stage and spiked to the highest importance during
the social distancing stage and remained in the top four most important features in the reopening
stage. This result implies that R0 is an important feature in determining the extent of disease spread
when community spread begins. The importance of minority status showed a similar pattern: it
was of relatively low importance in the outbreak stage, then rose to the top four in the social
distancing stage and became the highest-importance feature in the reopening stage. This result
supports the findings of other studies by Yancy 19, Dyer 20, Laurencin 21, and Millett et al. 22 that
reported a greater exposure to the virus in racial minority populations. Another two social
demographic features, socioeconomic status and CCVI, also showed relatively low importance in
the outbreak stage, increasing importance in the social distancing stage, and relatively high
importance in the reopening stage. The results not only highlight the importance of social
demographic features in the spread of virus, but also shed light on the criticality of incorporating
a functional timeline that takes into account relevant features when developing pandemic control
policies. For example, reopening planning should account for populations with different
socioeconomic status and CCVI because these two features demonstrate high importance in the
reopening stage.
C. Features showing decreasing importance across stages:
We found that the importance of two within-county mobility features, Cuebiq county
mobility index (CMI) and Cuebiq shelter-in-place index (SIP) showed an overall decreasing trend
across stages in two base models. The importance of both was high in the outbreak stage. This
result implies the importance of mobility reduction measures in the initial outbreak to slow down
8

community spread 29. The importance of CMI was also high in the social distancing stage and
showed a decreasing trend in the reopening stage, while the importance of SIP showed a decreasing
trend in the social distancing stage and became increasingly high in the reopening stage. These
results could imply that counties which maintained their social distancing practices even after
reopening were more likely to maintain or to decrease their number of infection cases.
D. Other highlighted features:
For features related to population activities, point-of-interest (POI) visits had high feature
importance at the beginning of the outbreak stage, but its importance started waned in the following
weeks, reaching lowest importance at the end of the outbreak stage. In the social distancing stage,
the importance of POI visits fluctuated: it increased during the first two weeks then decreased in
the following two weeks. In the reopening stage, the importance of POI visits showed an increasing
trend. The result could imply the importance of maintaining the reduction in POIs visits in the
social distancing and reopening stage for the containment of the virus spread. The social distancing
index (SDI), although showing a fluctuating pattern, had a relatively high feature importance
across all three stages. Similarly, this result supports the importance of voluntary and mandatory
social distancing measures for virus spread reduction across all stages.
The importance of cross-county mobility features and county out-degree and in-degree
centrality revealed important insights regarding travel reduction. County in-degree centrality, like
POI visits, had relatively high importance at the beginning of the outbreak stage but showed a
decreasing trend until the end of outbreak stage. In the social distancing stage, the importance of
county in-degree centrality showed an increasing trend, reached its highest importance rank at the
end of social distancing stage and kept relatively high feature importance in the reopening stage.
The importance of county out-degree centrality, on the other hand, kept low across three stages of
COVID-19. The results highlight the importance of travel reduction and limited cross-county
movements in all stages of the pandemic, especially for the movements into counties. Counties
should limit and monitor the number of travelers from other counties to effectively contain the
spread of the virus from their counties.
Feature Importance across Population Density Clusters
In the next step, we investigated feature importance for counties with different population
densities. Figures 5 through 7 illustrate models 3, 4 and 5, which encompass data from 279 counties
with the top 10%, the top 10%-–20%, and top 20%–30% densities among the 2787 counties.

Fig. 5 Rank of feature importance of model 3

Fig. 6 Rank of feature importance of model 4

10

Fig. 7 Rank of feature importance of model 5
We can observe from Figures 5 through 7 that feature importance shows different patterns
across population density clusters. Some features showed high importance only in the clusters with
high population density, and some features showed lower importance in population density clusters
compared with importance of the two base models.
A. Features having high importance in the high-population density cluster:
We can observe that two within-county mobility features, Cuebiq CMI and SIP, showed
high importance only in the top 10% population density cluster (model 3). For counties with lower
population densities in models 4 and 5, the importance of these two within-county mobility
features decreased, with the lowest importance in model 5. In model 3, these two features showed
high importance in the outbreak and social distancing stages. In the reopening stage, the
importance of SIP showed a decreasing trend, while CMI decreased in the first three weeks then
showed an increasing trend again. The results are consistent with existing studies that indicate that
mobility restriction orders could be more effective in counties with higher population densities 41.
Also, mobility restriction orders are more effective in early stage (i.e.. outbreak stage) of the
epidemic, and local control measures, such as shelter-in-place and social distancing orders, would
be more effective after the outbreak stage 29.
Also, another dominant feature in the base models, social connectedness index (SCI), had
a pattern similar to that of Cuebiq CMI. In model 3, SCI showed high importance in the outbreak
stage, and the importance started to decrease in the social distancing stage. In the reopening stage,
the importance of SCI showed an increasing trend. The results imply that SCI is more important
in the county clusters with higher population densities, and SCI had higher and increased
importance when there were more and increased human interactions. Hence, policy makers should
account for social connectedness in the area with higher population densities.
B. Features showing high importance in low population density clusters:
11

We found that social distance index had higher importance in low population density
clusters. SDI represents the portion of the number of digital devices at home divided by the total
number of digital devices in the area. In models 4 and 5 SDI, showed higher importance in the
social distancing stage. In model 3, although SDI had lower importance compared with models 4
and 5, it still showed an increasing importance in the social distance stage. The results could imply
that SDI is an important feature for effective pandemic control in the social distancing stage. Also,
social distancing may more effectively help pandemic control in counties with low population
densities in the social distancing stage. The results show that it is important to develop and monitor
social distancing measures, especially for the counties with low population densities.
C. Features shoingd lower importance and features keeping high importance in population density
clusters:
We found that in models 3 through5, GDP and R0 did not show the same importance
compared with the base models inclusive of all counties. This result may imply the correlation
between GDP, R0, and population density. The minority status feature, however, still showed high
importance in models of population density clusters, especially in the social distancing and
reopening stages. The results indicate that for the county clusters with close population densities,
GDP and R0 are not important features in examining the spread of virus. Policy makers should to
racial minority groups, especially in the social distancing and reopening stage. Formulating
policies that could help racial minority groups may effectively help with the overall pandemic
controls.
Discussion
The majority of the existing literature on epidemic spread modeling and COVID-19
pandemic primarily focuses on standard epidemiological models for examining the effects of
population features on disease spread. However, the ability of these models to examine the
relative importance of various features across different stages of the disease spread based on
various datasets is rather limited. To address this gap, in this paper, we investigated the
importance of collected 23 heterogeneous features in the trajectory of COVID-19 using a datadriven machine-learning model comprising 2,787 counties in the United States. The results
demonstrate the dynamics of feature importance among counties in United States and across three
stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the models including all 2,787 counties, (1) social
demographic features, such as GDP and population density, and the feature reflecting social
interaction strength, social connectedness index, kept high importance through stages of the
COVID-19 pandemics; (2) a virus attribute feature, reproduction number (R0), and some social
demographic features, including minority status, socioeconomic status, and COVID-19
community vulnerability index (CCVI) showed increased importance in the trajectory of the
COVID-19 pandemic; (3) within-county mobility features, Cuebiq county mobility index (CMI)
and shelter-in-place (SIP), showed decreased importance across different stages; while in the
models with different population densities, the level of importance varied; (4) within-county
mobility features showed higher importance in county clusters with higher population densities;
(5) GDP and R0 did not show the same importance within the models encompassing 2,787
counties, while the minority status feature still showed an initial low level and increasing
importance across stages; and (6) social distance index (SDI) showed higher importance in county
clusters with lower population densities and higher importance in the social distancing and
reopening stages.
12

The results showed consistency with findings of other studies. For example, Nepomuceno
et al. highlighted that social demographic factors would greatly affect the spread of COVID19. Also, Yancy 19, Dyer 20, Laurencin 21, and Millett et al. 22 argued that minority groups are
disproportionately affected by COVID-19. Kuchler et al. 39 showed social network structure
would affect the spread of COVID-19 among counties. Furthermore, the results showed that
within-county mobility features had higher importance in the model of counties with higher
population densities, which is consistent with the argument that mobility restriction orders may
have greater effect on counties with higher population densities 41. Our study, however, examined
the importance of multiple heterogeneous features related to population activities,
sociodemographic attributes, virus features, and mobility simultaneously. For example, our study
revealed that the importance of social network structure decreased in the model of counties with
lower population densities. Social distancing index had higher importance in the model of
counties with lower population densities. Minority status kept high importance in different
population density clusters.
The results could help policymakers develop pandemic control measures and strategies at
different levels and at different timepoints. For example, when policymakers develop pandemic
control measures at the country level, GDP, population densities, and SCI could be effective
indictors to separate counties for customized pandemic control measures. When considering a
specific county, such as New York County (also known as Manhattan) that has the highest
population density, pandemic control measures could focus on within-county mobility and social
network structure in the outbreak and social distancing stages, while minority status,
socioeconomic status, and overall COVID-19 community vulnerability index could be employed
in the social distancing and reopening stages. In smaller counties (such as Brazos County, Texas),
pandemic control measures may need to focus on social distancing in the outbreak and social
distancing stages, while in the reopening stage, social demographic factors, such as minority
status and CCVI should be accounted for. The feature analysis importance could also suggest
what feature indicators should be monitored by public officials in different counties and across
different stages of a pandemic.
We would like to note some limitations in this study. We considered only first-order feature
importance in this paper. Features may have interactions that deviate from an additive linear
explanation at different timepoints and for models of counties with different characteristics. The
dynamics of feature interaction in the trajectory of pandemics could be explored in future studies.
The results of feature interaction could inform which feature will strengthen or weaken another
feature. In this paper, we collected only 23 county level features. Future studies could explore and
use more county-level features to complement these results.

SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS
1. Collected features for the data-driven random forest model
Features related to social demographics:
Population density
We calculated population density of each county (population/square miles), as previous works
showed that population density is an important factor influencing the spread of an epidemic
(Ahmadi et al. 2020; Rocklöv and Sjödin 2020). Population density data was calculated based on
the county-level Social Vulnerability Index 2018 of United States published by Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) (2020).
Gross domestic product (GDP)
We included GDP of each county in 2018 as a feature for the model, as previous works showed
that GDP could be a vulnerability index for COVID-19. Counties with higher GDP usually have a
more robust economy and better health systems compared with counties with lower GDP
(Nepomuceno et al. 2020; Sarmadi et al. 2020). We used the 2018 county-level GDP published by
United States Department of Commerce (2020).
COVID-19 Community Vulnerability Index
This study incorporates the county-level COVID-19 Community Vulnerability Index developed
by Surgo Foundation based on the CDC data (Surgo Foundation 2020) which comprises seven
social and demographic features determined by previous studies to affect the spread of COVID-19.
(Nepomuceno et al. 2020; Wright et al. 2020).
1. Socioeconomic status: A measure accounting for population education, income, and
occupation. Surgo Foundation developed this feature based on CDC’s Social Vulnerability
Index, which accounts for population below poverty, unemployed, and without a high
school diploma.
2. Household composition and disability: Developed based on CDC’s SVI, this feature
accounts for populations aged 65 or older, populations aged 17 or younger, populations
older than 5 years of age with a disability, and single-parent households.
3. Minority status and language: Also based on CDC’s SVI, this feature accounts for minority
and populations who speak English “less than well.”
4. Housing type and transportation: Based on CDC’s SVI, this feature accounts for the
population’s housing types, such as multi-unit structures, mobile homes, and crowded
housing. It also accounts for populations without vehicles and those who live in group
quarters.
5. Epidemiologic factors: Developed by Surgo Foundation in response to COVID-19, this
feature accounts for populations with underlying conditions (e.g., cardiovascular,
respiratory, immunocompromised, obesity, and diabetes) that are vulnerable to COVID-19.
6. Healthcare system factors: Developed by Surgo Foundation for COVID-19, this factor
accounts for poor health system capacity, strength, and preparedness.
7. Overall COVID-19 community vulnerability index (CCVI): This feature combines the
above six features with equal weights. CCVID is a composite score that reflects the extent
1

of a county’s vulnerability to COVID-19.
Features related to population activities
Points-of-interest visits
We used SafeGraph data, Weekly Pattern Version 2 (SafeGraph 2020a), to calculate the number
of visits to points of interest (POIs) in each county, such as restaurants, museums, hospitals, and
colleges. Furthermore, to remove the influence of disparate numbers of POIs in each county, we
used the percentage change based on baseline POI visits of the first week, the week of March 3,
2020.
Social distancing index
We used Social Distancing Metrics developed by SafeGraph (SafeGraph 2020b), to calculate the
social distancing index (SDI) of each county. The SDI was calculated dividing the number of cell
phones at home by the total number of devices within a county. Also, we used the percentage
change based on SDI of the first week to remove the potential influence of disparate amounts of
devices in each county.
Urban activity index
We used Mapbox data to calculate the urban activity index. Mapbox data provides contact activity
metrics in pre-defined tiles (measuring about 100 by 100 meters square) in 4-hour temporal
resolution. We classified tiles into four categories and calculated an aggregated contact activity
metric in classified tiles using Equation 1 to assess four kinds of urban activities on a larger scale.
Therefore, urban activity index includes four sub-features: social activity index, traffic activity
index, work activity index, and home activity index.
1. Social tiles: We classified tiles as social tiles in areas where at least one POI in SafeGraph
is located.
2. Traffic tiles: Traffic tiles includes tiles incorporating roads.
3. Home tiles: Home tiles include tiles that cover residual buildings or have device
information from 7 p.m. to 3 a.m.
4. Work tiles: all other tiles.

where 𝑐% represents contact activity metric in the tile of index 𝑖.
Venables distance
We also used Mapbox data to calculate the daily Venables distance of each county (Louail et al.
2015) according to Equation 2, reflecting the concentration of population activities.

𝐷& (𝑡) =

∑%(' 𝑠% (𝑡)𝑠' (𝑡)
where 𝑠% (𝑡) and 𝑠' (𝑡) are the daily average activity intensities in cells 𝑖 and 𝑗, respectively, and
𝑑%' is the distance between two cells. The resolution of cell is 4 square meters. We also calculated
percentage change based on the values of the first week to remove the influence of disparate tiles
and cells in each county.

Features related to mobility within counties
Cuebiq county mobility index (CMI)
We used a county mobility index provided by Cuebiq as a feature of population mobility within
counties (Cuebiq 2020). The Cuebiq mobility index of each county is the median of aggregated
movements of each user in a day in the county (Equations 3 and 4). For example, a CMI of 5 for
a county represents that the median user in that county travels 500 meters.
𝐷𝑒𝑣𝑖𝑐𝑒 𝑀𝑜𝑏𝑖𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑦 (𝐷𝑀) = 𝑙𝑜𝑔") (𝐷 + 1)
𝐶𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡𝑦 𝑀𝑜𝑏𝑖𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑦 𝐼𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑥 (𝐶𝑀𝐼) = 𝑀𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑎𝑛(𝐷𝑀)
where 𝐷 is the aggregated distance of one user in a day in the county.

(4)

Cuebiq shelter-in-place index (SIP)
We used shelter-in-place index (SIP) provided by Cuebiq as another feature of population mobility
within counties (Cuebiq 2020). Cuebiq calculated the percentage of users in each county who
traveled less than 330 feet as the SIP.
Features related to mobility across counties
County in-degree and out-degree centrality
We mapped networks of movement across counties based on SafeGraph data (Weekly Pattern
Version 2 (SafeGraph 2020a)). We used the data of visits from census block groups (CBGs) to
POIs to map network movements across counties. The nodes in the network are counties; weights
of edges are visits from CBGs in one county to POIs in another county. Therefore, the mapped
network accounts only for the movements due to POI visits. We calculated the in-degree and outdegree centrality of each county in the mapped network and used the percentage change with
respect to the first week to remove the influence of larger counties tending to have higher in-degree
and out-degree centrality.
Colocation degree centrality
We used Facebook county-level colocation maps to calculate the colocation degree centrality of
each county. Colocation maps could represent a network in which nodes are counties and edges
represent the probability of population contacts between two counties. The network is undirected,
and we calculated weighted colocation degree centrality as the feature reflecting mobility across
counties. Also, we calculated the percentage change of the colocation degree centrality with
respect to the first week.
Features related to disease attributes
Reproduction number (R0)
The reproduction number (R0) is an attribute of infectious diseases which estimates the number of
secondary cases infected by the first case (Dietz 1993). We calculated the reproduction number of
COVID-19 according to Equation 5 based on a simple epidemic transmission model (Fan et al.
2020; Ramchandani et al. 2020). The model assumes that one case would infect 𝑅) cases after a
3

time interval 𝜏. Then 𝑖(0) infected cases at the time step 0 will lead to 𝑖(𝑡) = 𝑖(0)𝑅*/, number of
infected cases at time step t.
𝑅) = 𝑒 -,

(5)

where 𝐾 = (ln 𝑖(𝑡) − ln 𝑖(0))/𝑡, and we used 𝑖 = 5.1 days for COVID-19 (Zhang et al. 2020).
Furthermore, we used the percentage changes of 𝑅) with respect to the first week as the feature
inputs in the model.
Features related to social network structure
Social connectedness index (SCI)
We used the social connectedness index to account for social network structures affecting epidemic
transmissions (Kuchler et al. 2020). The county-level social connectedness index provided by
Facebook and SCI for two counties is calculated according to Equation 6 (Facebook 2020).
𝑆𝐶𝐼%,' =

𝐹𝐵_𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠%,'
𝐹𝐵_𝑈𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑠% × 𝐹𝐵_𝑈𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑠'

(6)

We can find from Equation 6 that SCI of counties i and j is determined based on the number of
Facebook connections (i.e., friends in Facebook) between two counties divided by the number of
Facebook users in two counties. SCI, therefore, reflects the strength of social connection between
two counties.
We mapped a fully connected network based on the SCI. The nodes in the network are counties;
edge weights are SCIs between counties. Then we calculated weighted degree centrality of each
county and the feature inputted in the model.
2. Model related supplemental information
We fitted five random forest classifier models each week. The dependent variable for the five
models were the five classifications of the weekly new confirmed CPP (cases per 100,000
population) of each county. For each week, we put counties with zero CPP in classification 0. Then,
according Equation 1, the remaining counties were evenly divided into four classifications (i.e.,
classifications 1 through 4), with each classification having one of total four quantiles of CPP.
Figure S1 illustrates the histograms of five classifications for five random-forest models in each
week.

Figure S1. Histogram of five classifications for each week
Figures S2 illustrates the test accuracy of each model for each week. Note that random forests use
the training set to determine feature importance based on reduction of Gini importance. This means
5

that Gini importance-based features showed the extent to which the feature could well split the
training set. The accuracy of the training set reached 0.99 for each model. We used ten crossvalidations; the importance of each feature is the mean of ten rounds. The output accuracy is also
the mean of ten rounds.
