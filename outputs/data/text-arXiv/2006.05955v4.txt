Abstract
A compartmental epidemic model is proposed to predict the Covid-19 virus
spread. It considers: both detected and undetected infected populations, medical
quarantine and social sequestration, release from sequestration, plus possible reinfection. The coefficients in the model are evaluated by fitting to empirical data for
eight US states: Arizona, California, Florida, Illinois, Louisiana, New Jersey, New
York State, and Texas. Together these states make up 43% of the US population;
some of these states appear to have handled their initial outbreaks well, while others
appear to be emerging hotspots. The evolution of Covid-19 is fairly similar among
the states: variations in contact and recovery rates remain below 5%; however,
not surprisingly, variations are larger in death rate, reinfection rate, stay-at-home
effect, and release rate from sequestration. The results reveal that outbreaks may
have been well underway in several states before first detected and that California
might have seen more than one influx of the pandemic. Our projections based on
the current situation indicate that Covid-19 will become endemic, spreading for
more than two years. Should states fully relax stay-at-home orders, most states
may experience a secondary peak in 2021. If lockdowns had been kept in place, the
number of Covid-19 deaths so far could have been significantly lower in most states
that opened up. Additionally, our model predicts that decreasing contact rate by
10%, or increasing testing by approximately 15%, or doubling lockdown compliance
(from the current ∼ 15% to ∼ 30%) will eradicate infections in the state of Texas
within a year. Extending our fits for all of the US states, we predict about 11 million total infections (including undetected), 8 million cumulative confirmed cases,
and 630,000 cumulative deaths by November 1, 2020.

Introduction
A cluster of pneumonia cases resulting from an unknown pathogen was identified in December 2019 by Chinese Health authorities in the city of Wuhan (Hubei), China [1].
The pathogen has been identified as a novel strain of coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 [1], now
named Covid-19 [2]. The exponential growth of the disease prompted Chinese authorities
to introduce their strictest level of measures to contain its outbreak, including Wuhan
city lockdown, banning public gatherings, shutting down public transport, and prohibiting travel between cities [3]. Despite these measures, a global pandemic ensued, with
3,855,809 total worldwide cases and 265,861 deaths as of May 9, 2020 as declared by the
World Health Organization (WHO) [4].
The first cases of community transmission in the United States were reported in
California, Oregon, Washington state and New York state in late February, 2020 [5]. A
Santa Clara, California death on Feb. 6 was deemed the country’s first Covid-19 fatality
after an autopsy was conducted in April [5]. A national emergency was declared by US
President Donald Trump on March 13, 2020, and testing several days later revealed that
Covid-19 had spread to all 50 states [5]. On March 20, New York City was declared the
US outbreak epicenter [5]. A study, released on April 2020 as a preprint, found via genetic
analysis of Covid-19 cases in New York City that the majority of the viruses originated in
Europe – revealing that transmissions had begun as early as January from countries with
no travel monitoring [6]. As of June 29, 2020, the US had 2,496,628 confirmed Covid-19
cases, and 125,318 Covid-19 deaths [7].
Covid-19 challenges faced by the US include fair allocation of adequate medical resources [8], minimizing mortality, avoiding overwhelming the health-care system, and
keeping the effects of lockdown and social distancing policies on the economy within
manageable levels [9]. Epidemiological analysis of the virus proliferation is needed to
assess the impacts of mitigation strategies including social distancing, sheltering-in-place
(voluntary), and quarantines (enforced by authorities) [9], as well as personal habits
including frequent hand washing and wearing masks. We have developed a new compartmental model, extending the long-standing SIR (Susceptible, Infected, Removed) model
[10, 11, 12], to evaluate and compare several states’ responses to Covid-19; with this
model we can make estimates, using curve fitting of reported empirical data, of the impact of contact suppression measures and the lifting of such measures. We find that, for
the current situation where several states have relaxed stay-at-home measures, Covid-19
will become an endemic virus for at least two years; so it is not surprising that some states
are reinstating the stay-at-home measures [13]. We simulated the effect of fully lifting
stay-at-home orders and find that the number of infections increases by approximately
an order of magnitude with a secondary peak in several states.

A new model
Our new SQUIDER model incorporates additional processes into the classic SIR (Susceptible, Infected, Recovered) model: i) making a distinction between known cases (which are
publicly reported) and asymptomatic or mild cases which are not monitored or detected;
ii) including the effects of responses, varying by region, to the pandemic, whether direct,
through quarantine or medical isolation of diagnosed cases, or less direct such as social distancing efforts; and iii) possible loss of immunity of recovered individuals, allowing some
of them to be reintroduced into the Susceptible population. The model thus requires sev2

eral new compartments, which we will denote as U (Undetected infected), E (Excluded,
meaning undetected recovered and possible deaths), and Q (pseudo-Quarantine, a bin to
hold a segment of the susceptible and undetected infected populations, that allows us to
model lower contact rates due to social distancing). Furthermore, for modeling/fitting
purposes we add a separate compartment D for known infecteds who die; deaths from
the virus is a statistic that is generally available [14].
The rate equations are as follows:

Each compartment is normalized by the total population N (includes deaths from Covid19 but not births and deaths from other causes - see below); hence
S + Q + U + I + D + E + R = 1.

(8)

Note that the coefficients α, β, δ, , γ, and ρ are constants (to be evaluated from fits to
data).
Before we go through the individual equations we should discuss some of the recurring
terms and factors. First, the incidence rate βSU a , the average normalized new infections
in time, is nonlinear when a > 0. Here β is the contact rate, which is the average number
3

of contacts a person has per day, multiplied by the probability of transmitting the disease
when contact between a susceptible and an Undetected infected occurs. Detected Infecteds (I) are not involved since we assume that, post-diagnosis, the I group are generally
in medical isolation or some other form of quarantine [15]. If a = 1, this term describes
homogenous mixing of the Susceptible and Undetected infected populations [16], which
may not be accurate for states with isolated populations, low population densities, or
many densely populated areas; the relationship may be sublinear or superlinear depending on the population being sparse or dense. Power law incidence rates (such as βSU a )
have been shown to improve the accuracy of SIR models [17, 18].
Second, the factor q(t) models the unavoidable time-dependent social distancing and
contact suppression, as well as the releasing of lockdowns, which can be reasonably represented by Gaussian functions. Social distancing is modeled by sequestering a proportion
of the Susceptible and Undetetected infected populations at a time t1 . This does not
imply that some large number of undiagnosed people are put into any actual physical
quarantine, only that the available sub-groups for infecting (U ) and for becoming infected (S) are reduced; alternatively, this could be modeled by altering β or the power
law dependency a in a time-dependent way. Since the model works by transferring populations from one compartment to another over time at different rates, the function q(t)
is implemented as a Gaussian pulse centered at a time t1 , where t1 is a fit parameter.
The standard deviation and height of the pulse are chosen so that a proportion (q1 ) of
the population is sequestered – this proportion is another fit parameter. This pulse form
was chosen, as opposed to a constant value used by some authors [19, 20, 21], because
many states went into lockdown on a particular day with numerous people self-isolating
[22, 23]. In particular, selecting the day t1 where such a measure is initiated is important
as it reflects the compliance of the state’s population. q(t) also has a second, negative,
pulse strength modeling the effect of the sequestered population re-entering into the susceptible population. The proportion, q2 , of the sequestered people re-entering and the
day when this occurs, t2 , are also fit parameters.
Equation 1 for the Susceptible population is reduced nonlinearly by new infections
βSU a due to interactions, and explicitly reduced in a time dependent way by sequestration
q(t)S (not by any significant amount until we get close to the activation time t1 ), as well as
increased again by re-entrance at a rate ρ by members of the Excluded (E) and Recovered
(R) groups. This term was added due to the WHO revelation that recovered Covid-19
patients may have little or waning immunity after exposure [24], later confirmed by an
antibody study conducted on individuals who had recovered from Covid-19 infections
[25].
Equation 2, for Undetected infecteds, includes the increase due to contact with S
members, and removal by various causes. The rate  closely resembles the recovery rate
in the basic SIR model, which (since the model is static, implying that births and deaths
due to other causes are not considered) implicitly includes deaths due to a potentially
fatal disease. Note that, at least in the early days of the pandemic, increased overall
deaths in comparison with the prior three years were not examined for signs that the
virus was active among undiagnosed populations [26]. The detection rate δ specifies the
proportion of Undetected infected individuals who are diagnosed with the virus (and are
hence no longer undetected); it is added to the I compartment. Finally, this population
is also effectively reduced due to social distancing q(t), e.g. residents of many states
were encouraged to shelter at home and not seek testing/diagnosis unless they became
symptomatic, in order to ease pressure on medical resources [27].
4

Equation 3 for the detected Infected population, describes increases due to testing at
rate δ and decreases due to death with rate γ, and recovery with rate α. Since these
individuals are isolated in designated hospital wards or under quarantine at home [15],
hence unlikely to be a source of infection to the community at large, we felt there was
no need for sequestration (i.e. q(t)) when social distancing went into effect. This is in
agreement with the WHO guidance on quarantines segregating suspected exposed people
[24].
Equation 4 describes the growth of detected Recovered, balanced by outflux of the Recovered population into the susceptible compartment at rate ρ due to little or waning immunity, expected for human coronaviruses [28]. Equation 5 describes the increase in Deceased detected individuals. Equation 6 describes the increase in the pseudo-Quarantine
compartment due to official contact suppression measures q(t), which as stated above is
only significant around the activation time t1 . Of course, one expects that the coefficients
for U and S could be different, but are kept the same (q(t)) for simplicity, discussed later.
Equation 7 describes increases in the undetected recovered population at rate , and decreases in this population due to loss of immunity of E at rate ρ. Equation 8 is the trivial
statement that the sum of all of these compartments (S, Q, U , I, D, E, R) add up to
the total population N .

Assumptions
Several simplifying assumptions or idealizations have been made. To begin with, in
our model the detected Infecteds (I) do not transmit the disease to the Susceptible (S)
population. It is generally the case that in all such disease outbreaks (e.g. the 2014–
2016 Ebola outbreak), even when strict quarantine measures are in place, medical service
providers and other people rendering direct aid to victims are themselves vulnerable
to infection; when the outbreak (in the non-healthcare worker population) is contained
they may even make up the substantial proportion of cases [29]. However, in the current
situation where the disease circulates through the general population, and safety protocols
(such as restricting visitation by friends and relatives) are rigorously enforced by health
providers, the number of such cases is statistically negligible.
Other simplifying assumptions: as mentioned above, we have opted to keep our contact rate β constant and instead vary the S and U compartment population levels to
mimic social distancing effects (for example staying at home). In future versions of our
model we may incorporate time dependent β or a in order to disentangle population wide
transmission suppression (e.g. face masks and other protective gear for the public) from
social contact suppression (cancellation of concerts and other public gatherings), but for
the sake of simplicity in both coding and analysis we have opted for now to use only
one time dependent rate. In the same vein, the q(t) function removes Susceptibles and
Undetetected infecteds at the same rate (we have no reason at this time to differentiate
the rates of change of these populations). Similarly, people from the Excluded E and
Recovered R compartments lose immunity at the same rate ρ. Indeed, it is possible that
people who experienced milder forms of the disease (E) lose immunity faster than those
who experienced more severe symptoms and sought out treatment (R) [25]; however, we
use a single rate ρ for simplicity. Finally, we do not consider the effects of births, vertical
transmissions, immigrants, emigrants, or deaths due to other diseases or trauma. The
inclusion of deaths due to diagnosed virus cases makes the model not entirely static, but

5

the disease’s total deaths as a proportion of the total population is low enough that births
and other such aspects can be safely omitted.

Methods
All numerical simulation for equations 1-8, fits, and data management were done in
Matlab. Data for cumulative confirmed cases and deaths were obtained from the Johns
Hopkins University (JHU) Center for Systems Science and Engineering, which has been
making highly credible US and global Covid-19 time-series statistics available to the
public on the GitHub [30] website. Raw data in the original CSV files were converted
to Matlab table data structures for ease of access; since the US data were broken out
by municipality/county, it was necessary to aggregate this to create each state wide time
series. 2019 estimates of state populations used for normalization were acquired from the
US Census Bureau [31].
Least squares fits of numerically generated curves to the data were obtained with
Matlab’s lsqcurvefit using a trust-region-reflective algorithm [32]. One of the benefits
of this fitting routine is that fit parameters can be given bounds or fixed values (the latter
being especially useful during model development and testing). Fit parameters were: all
model rate parameters (β, , δ, α, γ, and ρ), power law exponent a, initial condition
for unknown infecteds U (0), plus two pairs of parameters governing sequestration of
populations due to social distancing – peak qi values and dates of application ti where
i = 1, 2. Fits were done in two stages. When work was begun on this project, we had
data from Jan 22 to May 9, which allowed us to make initial fits for all rate parameters,
infectious power, initial conditions, and lockdown effects. In the course of writing the
results up, we realized we would need to incorporate the effect of breaking developments
(cessation of state stay-at-home orders and new spikes in cases), so a second fit was done
to determine the time and magnitude of the release of lockdown (q2 , t2 ) keeping all of the
previous parameter values unchanged.
Since all the rates are bound between 0 and 1, the ti parameters were rescaled by
the total time of the simulation to fall within the same range (this helps the fitting
routine when determining step sizes while revising the current solution). Fits were made
comparing certain selected and/or aggregated simulation results against normalized JHU
data for cumulative confirmed cases and deaths, simultaneously. lsqcurvefit default
values were used for tolerances, iterations, and step size, but because the proportions of
state populations were so small simulation results and normalized data were rescaled to
increase the magnitude of the error, preventing the fit routine from prematurely settling
for a solution (the scaling formula was chosen so that the norm of the rescaled test data
was equal to the number of elements in the test data matrix).
Simulation results were generated using Matlab’s ode45 function, which uses an explicit Runge-Kutta (4, 5) formula. Default settings were used for the solver, except that
the maximum step-size was constrained to be ≤ 0.5 days (this prevents the solver, which
uses an adaptive step-size, from accidentally stepping over the sequestration date t1 ).
The implementation of the model itself, coded in a function that is given as an argument
to ode45, is for the most part straightforward; the only aspect that requires any further
comment is the handling of the sequestration function q(t).
As mentioned above, the first sequestration is modeled as a smoothly shaped pulse
centered at time t1 . Since the system of ODEs works by transferring populations at

6

various rates between compartments, in practice we set a temporary rate which changes
every time the solver calls the model subroutine. For this we use the value of a Gaussian
curve at x = t with mean value t1 , height normalized, and width set so as to achieve
the sequestration we desire (easily calculated using Matlab’s normpdf function). Since
ode45’s adaptive step-size decreases when it detects unexpected movement in the q rate,
a well resolved sampling of different values near the peak t1 is obtained. To make analysis
more straightforward, we decided that the peak rate given to the solver would be equal
to the total sequestration effect (e.g., if we set the peak rate to 0.15, then roughly 15%
of the S and U compartments would ultimately be moved into the Q compartment). To
achieve this, for peak rates ≤ 0.625 we normalized the height to the peak rate, and set the
standard deviation to a value between 0.4 and 0.625 determined by trial and error and
fit to a cubic polynomial. For peak rates above 0.625, a much more complicated formula
was needed to achieve the desired effect; since such high sequestration never appeared
in any of the fits we will omit any further discussion of this, except to say that to get
effective clearance (99.84%) of the entire relevant compartments we use a Gaussian with
both height and width set to ≈ 1.6.
Lastly, for the purpose of doing projections the model implementation subroutine
accepts an arbitrary number of peak rate/activation date pairs tacked onto the end of
the parameter vector it takes as one of its arguments. This allows us to test the effect
of doing several interventions of possibly different magnitudes. Also, a negative peak
rate is implemented as returning the specified proportion of the sequestered population
in Q back to S (since ode45 has no facility for keeping track of the ratio of S and U
populations that were originally sequestered, it was felt that returning everyone to S was
the most sensible approach). To make this feasible codewise, at any particular time t
only the qi with peak time t∗i closest to t is executed. In practice, if peaks are set too
close to each other (e.g. within half a week or so) they may interfere with each other’s
ability to achieve full sequestration or release; but since this is essentially the case in real
life as well we thought it not to be a priority to address this issue.

Results
Coefficient evaluation
Figure 2 shows fits of the model to data (cumulative confirmed case counts and deaths
due to Covid-19) for Arizona, California, Florida, Illinois, Louisiana, New Jersey, New
York State, and Texas. The fits to cumulative case counts are all excellent – even for
states such as Illinois, New Jersey, and New York that have a distinct inflection in case
counts. It is also apparent that some states, such as Arizona, Florida, Louisiana, and
Texas, have had rapidly rising case counts in June – likely due to easing of restrictions.
This feature is captured by our q(t) – where application of a second, possibly negative
pulse moves people from the Q to the S compartments as described above. Note that
model fits to cumulative death counts deviate from the data in some states in June (such
as Louisiana, New York, and Texas). This may be due to the postulated lack of reliability
in confirmation of US Covid-19 deaths, which may be significantly undercounted [33]. Fit
parameters are listed in Table 1. The contact, detected recovery and exclusion rates vary
by less than 5%; however, reintroduction rate varies by 320%, re-release rate by 268%,
stay-at-home effect by 103%, and death rate by 59%. These variations, though large, are
not surprising due to different states having been in different stages of the outbreak.

We compare our fit parameters with the classical SIR model which, to remind the
reader, involves only Susceptible, Infected, and Recovered compartments. The β and 
parameters correspond to the contact and recovery rates of the SIR model; the fit values
imply that for unconstrained epidemic situations (with q(t) = δ = 0) the disease has a
reproduction number R0 = β/ of around 5 and a duration of about a week, consistent
with prior investigations [21, 34].
It is surprising that the detection rate δ is so high for all of the states (≈ 0.5); however, a recent nationwide coronavirus antibody study by the Spanish Health Ministry
[35] suggests that the number of unknown infected and unknown recovered in large and
heterogeneous jurisdictions, while significant, is not orders of magnitude larger than the
number of confirmed cases. This goes against some prior speculation that the asymptomatic and undiagnosed cases might be as much as 10 times the official count [36], which
would suggest a detection rate 5 times smaller than our δ values.
Returning back to figure 2 and table 1, the death rate from diagnosed cases γ falls
between around 2% and 3 12 %, which is well within the quite wide range of case-fatality
rates reported for earlier phases of the pandemic [37]. The recovery rate α for diagnosed
cases, seems somewhat high (in the 0.45 – 0.5 range for New York and New Jersey, and
around 0.7 – 0.8 for the other states); this could reflect the fact that detection of any
disease would normally occur after that disease has already partly run its course, but it
should be kept in mind as well that this compartment has a minimal effect on the size
of the fitted compartments I and D, so the fitting routine may not be as constrained in
selecting the α value as the other fit parameters. The re-entry (due to loss of immunity)
rate ρ is fairly low for most of the states, which indicates that this is not a significant
factor for the initiation of the outbreak. Such low ρ values are not unreasonable since
loss of immunity to corona viruses that cause common colds is typically slow, even taking
months [28]. Indeed, one recent report found that antibodies in a high proportion of
individuals who recovered from Covid-19 started to decrease within 2–3 months after
infection, consistent with our findings [25]. As we see below, this slow reintroduction of
people to the Susceptible compartment obviously results in an endemic infection in the
predictions.
Our fitted peak initial sequestration values range over 0.1 – 0.2 for all states except
Illinois (whose value is close to 0.04); it should be kept in mind this is not the actual
quarantining of approximately 15% of the population of most states, but rather the effect
of overall reduction in social contacts between susceptible and infectious populations,
which in the US was never pursued as systematically or consistently as in some other
jurisdictions. The parameter t1 enables prediction of what day self-isolation policies
started having significant effects on case counts – see Table 1. To compare t1 to states’
directives, stay-at-home orders were issued in Arizona on March 31, California on March
19, Florida on April 1, Illinois on March 21, Louisiana on March 23, New Jersey on March
21, New York on March 22, but was suggested in Texas on April 2 [38]. The one week or
so time lag between action and its effect should be expected to be related to the infection
lasting about a week as mentioned above. It is possible that Texas, Arizona, and Florida
residents were following local orders which prescribed sheltering in place sooner than the
state orders: as examples Dallas had a state of emergency declared on March 19, and
Houston residents were urged to stay at home on March 24 [39].
Many states partially re-opened in May. Our fit parameter q2 for the various states
corresponds to the percentage of people moving between the Susceptible and Quarantine
compartments – where a negative number indicates the percentage decreasing, moving

from the Quarantine to the Susceptible compartment. Specifically, Arizona, Florida, and
Texas had significant numbers (>30%) exiting from stay-at-home conditions, whereas
California and Louisiana had smaller numbers (<11%), Illinois had 4 12 % additional people
enter the Q compartment, and New Jersey had a small Q entry (< 21 %). The date at
which this occurred, t2 , can also be compared with the dates stay-at-home orders were

stay-at-home expired in Florida on May 4, in Louisiana on May 15, in New York on May
28, and in Texas on April 30. The time lag between t2 and official dates may correspond
to the end of the school year and people’s perception of safety.
The initial values of the undetected infecteds U (0) are all less than one individual
(some significantly), implying that none of the states we look at had any actual cases
on January 22 (the first day for which we have data). While the ODE results can be
scanned to find an estimate for the arrival of the first case (or first two, or five cases) in a
jurisdiction, some caution should be exercised in applying this number, since magnitudes
at this point are still too small to make statistically valid comparisons. Given that the
model estimates there to have been at least 10 cases in the states studied (except Arizona,
Florida, and Illinois) by the 3rd or 4th week of February (the 1st week of February for
New York) we think it is probable that Covid-19 was spreading considerably sooner in
New York, New Jersey, Texas, and Louisiana than previously assumed. This implies
that stronger measures – such as travel bans, cluster identification, contact tracing, and
quarantine measures – were needed to fully contain the outbreak [40, 41]. California had
reported cases already in late January, yet both the reported data and our ODE model
show the main outbreak occurred well after New York or New Jersey. This is likely if the
western states were dealing successfully with cases coming directly from Asia, but lost
control of the outbreak when infected individuals started arriving from the eastern US or
possibly Europe; possible differences between the Asian and European Covid-19 strains
are are not addressed here.
Figure 3 shows the behaviors of the U , E, and R, as well as I and D (fitted compartments) over the fit period (January 22 to June 29, 2020). Note that the most striking
difference in the shapes of the curves among the states is that between Arizona and New
Jersey – the other states lie in the range between them. It appears that sequestering S

and U populations had a much stronger effect in New Jersey than in Arizona on Recovered and Excluded populations – with plateaus in these populations becoming apparent
in May 2020. Notably, the state of New Jersey has not yet announced plans to reopen.
Similarly, the Unknown infected and confirmed Infected cases rise much less quickly in
and beyond April, while the confirmed Deaths continue to rise due to active infections.
In contrast, in Arizona, the values for all of the compartments are approximately 50%
smaller, though all of them increase with a steady apparent slope in June, suggesting
that the outbreak is at an earlier stage and is likely fueled by increasing contacts due to
easing stay-at-home measures [13]. The effect of applying contact suppression measures
(pseudo-quarantine) becomes apparent on day t1 in U and I curves in most of the states
11

as it forms a small hump in the curves (see figures 3C-G). Notably, the states whose undetected infected population U decreases after quarantine and its release are Illinois, New
Jersey and New York – these states put in strict shelter at home measures [42], whereas,
as an example, the Texas governor has not yet made staying at home mandatory [43] and
permitted its residents to attend in-person church services [44]. The rapid rise in U and
I in June in Arizona, Florida, Louisiana, and Texas is likely due to early opening up the
states’ economies, such as allowing in-person dining and retail shopping as examples [13]
– reflected in their higher magnitude q2 values.
Model Predictions
We have generated future predictions using the current fits, out to two years beyond the
first date of recorded US cases. Figures 4A-H show that the total number of infections
increases substantially in most states from July 2020 to January 2021, except for Illinois,
which apparently experienced its peak case count in May. It is predicted, however, that
all states will have continued Covid-19 infections for the next two years, some with small
secondary peaks occurring in the spring of 2021. California, Illinois, Louisiana, and New
Jersey do not have secondary peaks – this is likely due to these states having negative q2
values (meaning more people enter Q) close to the reintroduction rates ρ, or very small ρ
values. For oscillations to be present in compartment models, cycling of populations has to
occur at an intermediate rate – having a high re-entry rate leads to steady infections; and
having no re-entry results in eradication of the virus. Our projected daily deaths (figure
4I) show that Arizona, Florida, New York, and Texas have secondary peaks in deaths
after the first main peak. New Jersey and Illinois avoid a secondary peak, presumably
because these states haven’t yet reopened. We have performed fits to all of the states in
the US, and predict 11,326,089 cumulative cases, 8,346,433 cumulative confirmed cases,
and 633,562 cumulative deaths by November 1, 2020 (for all fits R2 ≥ 0.96).
We have also generated counterfactual estimates of case counts (figures 4A-H) for
the hypothetical situation where stay-at-home orders were not lifted. The daily peak
total cases is ≈ 10 times lower for Arizona, Florida, Louisiana, New York, and Texas, in
comparison with trends predicted from current data. Keeping the stay-at-home orders
had weaker effects in Louisiana and California than the other states – due to only releasing
small numbers of their Q population back to S (≈ 10% for Lousiana, <1% for California).
Our counterfactual daily deaths (figure 4J) show that maintaining staying-at-home results
in significantly reduced deaths in Arizona, Florida, Louisiana, New York, and Texas.
California was not strongly affected because its residents did not fully re-open, and Illinois
and New Jersey’s counterfactual and factual projections do not differ since these states
did not reopen.
Effects of full re-opening
We further considered the effect of fully re-opening the states selected by transferring
all of the Q compartment populations into the S compartment on two future dates –
September 1, 2020 and January 1, 2021 – see figure 5. These dates were arbitrarily selected, but demonstrate an apparently universal behavior. We observe that, immediately
after the releases, the number of total daily infections rapidly rise to a peak, and secondary peaks afterwards are also observed. Surprisingly, some states such as Arizona and
Illinois experience a larger peak with reopening later – we have no explanation for this
surprising behavior. For most states, including California, Florida, Louisiana, New York,

Sensitivity to intervention level
Given our grim predictions (in figures 4-5), it is natural to ask if there is some nonpharmaceutical intervention (i.e. vaccines) that could improve the situation. We show
the effects of increased social distancing and mask-wearing by reducing the contact rate
β in figure 6A for the state of Texas. Decreasing β by 10% results in virtual eradication of Covid-19 in Texas within one year. Increasing detection rate (i.e. testing) by
approximately 15% will also eradicate the virus within a year, shown in figure 6B, as

Discussion and Conclusions
Several studies in the peer-reviewed literature and various pre-print servers have modeled
the growth of Covid-19 infections and deaths in the US or its various states. One of these
uses a SEIR model (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, Removed) implemented on a network
to simulate inter-state travel [45]. They predict that, in the absence of countermeasures,
the outbreak peaks on day 54 in their simulation (May 10, 2020). They also predict that
on day 50, the number of cases has decreased in New York, New Jersey, Washington,
and Louisiana whereas Texas and California have many increasing cases. Other SEIR15

type models with additional compartments [19, 20] including quarantine, also predict
that the US outbreak peaks near May 10, 2020 [19], or peaks in the general population
15 weeks into the outbreak (approximately by the last week of April) if only 5% of
the population practices self-isolation within a day of symptom onset; if 10% of the
population self isolates this pushes the peak by an additional 3 weeks, demonstrating
that small variations can have significant effects [20].
A Covid-19 SEIRS model (where recovered become susceptible again) including coinfection with additional human coronavirus strains and a periodic basic reproduction
number R0 corresponding to seasonal forcing, combined with US data, predicts that
wintertime outbreaks will occur for several years if immunity wanes – as also occurs with
other coronaviruses [46]. This study also predicts that the number of confirmed Covid-19
cases in the first wave strongly depends on the peak value of R0 . Furthermore, social
distancing was tested by reducing R0 ; applied once this may push the epidemic peak to
the autumn, whereas intermittent application can reduce the total number of cases [46].
As expected for nonlinear systems, some predictions, even if accurate for a short
time, can deviate significantly with increased time. A logistic model of Covid-19 growth
in the US predicts that the cumulative number of cases plateaus by May 14, 2020 [47].
Alternatively, a neural network parametric model was developed, which predicted that
the US would reach the peak number of cases by April 8, 2020 [48]. Additionally, a
sigmoidal Hill-type model predicts that the US will have 735,920 cases within 76 days
of the outbreak, with 41,285 deaths [49]. In contrast, our model predicts significantly
more Covid-19 cases and deaths, with an extended duration past 2 years for the majority
of states examined. Note: all disease models come with drawbacks. Our model is not
mechanistic; it says nothing about Covid-19 specifically. While the quality of our fits to
current data is very good, the accuracy of the projections depends on the reliability of
the data used to generate the fit parameters.
Delays in transfers between compartments (such as our pseudo-quarantine), and in
transferring between several compartments (effectively causing a delay) prior to re-entry
in the susceptible population are known to cause oscillations in SIR type models [50]
– reintroducing individuals into the susceptible compartment de-stabilizes the steady
rate of infections. Temporary immunity, modeled by our reintroduction of recovered and
excluded populations into the susceptible compartment, as well as relaxation of shelter-inplace orders, can produce yearly oscillations such as found in influenza and other human
corona viruses (i.e. “common colds”) [51, 28]. It is quite likely that Covid-19 will become
endemic in the United States with yearly spikes in cases.
We have chosen to not include vaccination in our model, even though the race for
development is currently underway [52]; rather we have focussed on non-medical interventions. Including such an effect is feasible in our model, where vaccinations would
reduce the susceptible population. This could be at a constant rate, such as for newborn
infants receiving the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine [53], or it could be a time dependent term reflecting people’s confidence in vaccinations [54]. We look forward to seeing
the effect of vaccination on our model predictions once Covid-19 vaccination has been
demonstrated to be safe and effective in both animals and humans – estimated to be
possible by autumn 2021 [55].
In conclusion, we have developed a compartment model taking into account social
distancing, undetected infecteds, and possible loss of immunity – all issues which are
relevant for Covid-19. The model describes current data very well for the states selected
for study; this more realistic picture of the disease growth is likely due to both using
16

a larger number of compartments than traditional SIR-type models, and to considering
additional nonlinearity in the infectious power of the disease. While projections based
on the model are not wholly optimistic, they do point to the fact that it is quite possible
to avoid more severe outcomes with stronger measures – increased social distancing,
detection, and stay-at-home adherence – than have been pursued so far.
