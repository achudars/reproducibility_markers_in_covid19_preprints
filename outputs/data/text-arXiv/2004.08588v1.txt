Abstract
We have proposed a SEIR compartmental mathematical model. The prime
objective of this study is to analyse and forecast the pandemic in Italy for
the upcoming months. The basic reproduction number has been calculated.
Based on the current situation in Italy, in this paper, we will estimate the
possible time for the end of the pandemic in the country. The impact of lock
down and rapid isolation on the spread of the pandemic are also discussed.
Further, we have studied four of the most pandemic affected regions in Italy.
Using the proposed model, a prediction has been made about the duration of
pandemic in these regions. The variation in the basic reproduction number
corresponding to the sensitive parameters of the model is also examined.

1. Introduction
Since its first appearance in Wuhan (China), the severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus-2 disease (COVID 19) is spreading rapidly across the
globe [1, 2]. The number of patients are increasing exponentially and in some
of the countries, thousands of people are losing their lives, almost every day,
due to COVID 19. The seriousness of the situation can be understood by the
fact that the number of infected cases have crossed the 1.2 million mark and
more than 75 thousand confirmed deaths, across the globe, due to the disease
as on 7th April [3]. Moreover, the outbreak has spread in more than 200 countries [3]. Owing to the grievous condition, the World Health Organization
first declared the COVID 19 as a Public Health Emergency of International
Concern on 30 January 2020 and later a pandemic on 11 March 2020 [4]. In
fact, at this point of time, the COVID 19 seems to be unstoppable. Different countries and health agencies are working together to find some robust
method to prevent the ongoing wave, which now becomes a pandemic, of the
disease. Moreover, the ongoing outbreak forced various countries to implement the countrywide lock down to break the chain of transmission of the
corona virus. This results in a huge loss in terms of economy and resources
and at the same time created a chaotic situation worldwide. Efforts have
been made from different corners of the research community to understand
the structure of the virus and the transmission mechanism of the disease. Different studies analyze the role of social distancing (which is the only effective
method available till date) in the prevention of COVID 19.
At the initial stage, it is believed that transmission of the disease took
place through animal to human mode. But later it has been established
that the direct transmission of the disease is also possible and is the primary
reason for the acute transmission to various countries [5, 6, 7]. The possibility
of hospital related transmission was also explored and it was suspected to be
the possible cause in 41 % of patients [6]. Along with its high transmission
efficiency, the high level of global travel contributed heavily to the spread of
SARS-CoV-2 across the globe [8].
The ongoing pandemic of COVID-19 challenged many developed nations
including Germany, Spain, USA, Italy, France and several others and has
caused catastrophic impacts on the lifestyle of the people of these countries.
This is almost opposite to the pattern of infectious diseases observed to
date. In the past, such an outbreak of pandemic generally took place in
underdeveloped and developing countries. The African region which is the
2

host of many infectious diseases has the lowest reported cases of COVID-19
till date.
Italy recorded its first case of COVID19 on February 20, 2020, at Lodi
(Lombardy) [9]. In the next 24 hours, the infected cases increased to 36
[9]. Moreover, at the initial stage of the outbreak, Italian data followed
closely the exponential growth trend observed in Hubei Province, China.
Till date, Italy is one of the countries that have faced grievous consequences
of COVID 19. Till 7th April 2020, Italy has 1,32,547 recorded cases and
16,523 deaths due to COVID 19. In terms of reported cases, it is the third
highest while it is on the top when it comes to the number of deaths across
the globe. Of the patients who died, 42.2 % were aged 80-89 years, 32.4 %
were aged 70-79 years, 8.4 % were aged 60-69 years, and 2.8 % were aged
50-59 years. The male to female ratio is 80 % to 20 % with older median
age for women (83.4 years for women vs 79.9 years for men) [10]. Moreover,
the estimated mean age of those who lost their lives in Italy was 81 years
[10]. The COVID19 outbreak completely disturbed the economic condition
of Italy. Several family owned small sectors are suffering [11]. The condition
of Italy surprised the research fraternity because Italy stands in the top five
countries in terms of medical facilities. The ongoing dismal scenario in Italy
has forced the government to admit that they do not have any control over
the spread of the disease as well as do not know when the ongoing web of
COVID 19 will stop.
Due to the catastrophic impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak, efforts have
been made to analyze the trend of the disease and predict the future of the
epidemics [10, 12]. The work carried out in [10] predicts that in the absence
of timely implementation of available medical resources, the authorities will
not be able to control the outbreak of the disease. The study further concludes that together with the medical facilities peoples movement and social
activities should be restricted immediately in order to curtail the burden
of the COVID-19. The work carried out in [12], collected the day to day
data and measured the possible similarity between Italy and Hubei Province
(China). Further, the study also shows that the number of deaths increased
almost five times as the available treatment facilities reached the limit. The
limited availability of medical staff and facilities also delays the possible end
of the COVID-19 crisis from 15 April 2020 to 8 May 2020.
However, to the best of our knowledge so far no compartmental deterministic mathematical model has been developed and studied for COVID-19
spread in Italy. In the current work, we propose a compartmental mathe3

matical model to study the case of Italy. The proposed model incorporates
four different compartments namely - Susceptible, Exposed, Infected and
Recovered population. The present COVID-19 has an incubation period
ranges up to 14 days. Therefore, to make our model realistic, we include
the exposed population along with the infected population, which certainly
results in improved prediction. We collected the data of Italy for COVID
19 available on the Worldometers[13] website. Further we trained the proposed mathematical model using the data avilable till 6th April 2020. Using
this improved mathematical model we study the impact of lockdown on the
spread of COVID 19 in Italy. Also, we predict the possible end of the current outbreak of COVID 19 in Italy. Moreover, to make our predictions more
realistic, we have trained and validated our model with COVID-19 data of
some the highly affected regions of Italy.
2. The Mathematical Model
The proposed model describes the transmission mechanism of COVID-19.
In the modelling process, we have divided the human population into four
mutually exclusive compartments, namely, susceptible (S), exposed (E), infected (I) and recovered (R). The exposed class is the collection of those
individuals which have just got infected and are not showing any symptoms
of the disease, while the infected class individuals have clear symptoms of
COVID-19. We further assume that a recovered individual will become immune to the infection. The flow chart of the model is presented in figure 1.
Based on the above assumptions, the model is governed by the following
system of equations:dS

= A − βS NI − β0 S N

= βS NI + β0 S N
− αE − α1 E − µE

dI

= αE − θI − α2 I − µI

dR

= α1 E + α2 I − µR

(1)

In the above model, N represents the total population. We assume that
all the new recruiters joined the susceptible class at a constant rate A. β
is the disease transmission rate from the infected individuals to susceptible

individuals. We further assume that susceptible individuals once come into
the contact of infected individual will not directly join the infected class.
They first join the exposed class (E) and after certain period of time shows
visible symptoms of the disease and enters into the infected class (I). Exposed class individuals are assumed to be less infectious as compared to the
infected class individuals. Therefore, β0 represents the disease transmission
rate for exposed individuals. Clearly, β0 ≤ β. Here, α is the rate at which
exposed individuals join the infected class. α1 is the recovery rate of exposed
individuals and α2 is the recovery rate of infected individuals. θ is the disease
induced death rate. µ is the natural death rate.
3. Basic Properties
In this section, we check the mathematical feasibility of the proposed
model. For this purpose, we check whether all the solutions of the proposed
model will remain positive and bounded or not.
Our proposed model system involves human population. Hence for the
initial state, all the compartmental values are assumed to be non-negative.
We consider the following initial condition for analysis:
S(0) ≥ 0, E(0) ≥ 0, I(0) ≥ 0, R(0) ≥ 0

(2)

3.1. Positivity of the Solution
To show the epidemiological feasibility of the proposed model system 1, it
is required that all the solutions remain non-negative. Hence, in the following
5

theorem we verify that all the solutions with non-negative initial condition
will remain non-negative. The following theorem establishes the positivity
of the solutions.
Theorem 1: The solution (S(t), E(t), I(t), R(t)) of the proposed model system is non-negative for all t ≥ 0 with non-negative initial condition.
Proof : From the first equation of system (1), we have

This gives
S(t1 ) ≥ 0
where t1 ≥ 0 is arbitrary. Similarly we can show the non-negativity for compartments E, I and R.
Hence, the solution (S(t), E(t), I(t), R(t)) will remain positive for non-negative
initial condition.

3.2. Boundedness of the Solution
In order to accurately predict the epidemic, the solutions of the mathematical model should be bounded. The following theorem guarantees the
boundedness of the solutionsof the COVID-19 model designed for Italy.
Theorem 2: All solutions of the proposed model are bounded.
Proof : We need to show that (S(t), E(t), I(t), R(t)) is bounded for each
value of t ≥ 0. From our model system 1 we obtain:
(S + E + I + R)′ = A − µ (S + E + I + R) − θI ≤ A − µ (S + E + I + R)
which gives us
lim Sup (S + E + I + R) ≤

t→∞

A
µ

Also, from the first equation of model system 1, we have
dS
≤ A − µS

From here, we can conclude that
S(t) ≤

Similarly, we can show the boundedness of every compartment of the model.
Therefore feasible region for our model system will be

4. COVID-19 in Italy
As of now, Italy is one of those countries which are highly effected by
COVID-19. According to the data collected from [13], the total number of
COVID-19 cases has crossed 139422 as on 9th April 2020. There has been
more then 17669 deaths in the country due to this epidemic. Our proposed
model aims to predict the future scenario of the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy
by analyzing its present state in the country. In this section, we perform
rigorous numerical simulations to get an insight of the epidemic in Italy.
The parameter values used for the simulation are provided in Table 1. We

have used all the real time parameter values avalible on the WHO website
[3] and [13]. However those parameter whose values are not available in the
real time, has been assumed for the study. All the simulations are performed
in MATLAB 2013a.
We have considered the following initial condition to perform our analysis.
This is taken on the basis of the officially reported data by [13] as on 1st March
2020.
(S(0), E(0), I(0), R(0)) = (50000000, 18000, 1577, 83)
According to the situation report-11 available on the official website of WHO[15],
the first two COVID-19 positive cases in Italy were reported on 31st January
2020. Both the infected individuals had travel history to the city of Wuhan,
china. This was the initial phase of the epidemic in the country. Due to
the lack of government concern on this matter, the epidemic started to grow
slowly but significantly. By the end of February the number of cases reached
to 1000 [13]. We trained our model defined for Italy for the month of March
to check its accuracy with the official data available [13]. It was observed
that our model predicted the epidemic closely. Figure 4 shows the measured
data by [13] and the model simulation for the possible number of COVID-19
cases in Italy.
The goal of this study is to estimate the scenario of the epidemic for the
upcoming days in Italy. For this purpose, we perform numerical simulation
and fit the proposed model to the real data available till 31st March 2020.

It can be seen from the simulated results (see fig.3) that, the active cases will
still increase till the end of April. The pandemic cases may start to decrease
by the first week of May. The epidemic may hit its peak in Italy between
28th April to 3rd May as shown in figure 3. Also, according to our proposed
model and if the conditions remains the same, the epidemic in the country
may not last till the end of July 2020.

5. Game Changers
In this section, we will discuss the factors which can significantly control
the spread of pandemic. The two major factors discussed here are (a) Early
Lock down and (b) Rapid Isolation.
5.0.1. Impact of Early Lock down
On 9th March 2020, the government of Italy imposed a nationwide quarantine restricting the movement of the population except for necessity, work,
and health circumstances, in response to the growing pandemic of COVID19 in the country. In this section, we will investigate the effect of early lock
down on the spread of pandemic in Italy.

point for simulations has been assumed as March 1st , 2020.

It is clear from Figure 4 that the epidemic could have been controlled at a
10

very early stage if the government had imposed the lock down early in Italy.
Figure 4 shows three different scenarios of the epidemic in Italy with different
initial values of susceptible class.
Figure (4a) shows the current scenario of Italy. However, if lock down would
have been imposed prior to 9th March 2020, the number of susceptible would
have been significantly low. In figure (4b), we assume the susceptible population to be 3.5 crores due to the lock down in the country. It can be seen
from the plot that, it has not only significantly reduce the number of infections, but also caused the overall death of pandemic by 20th April, 2020.
Also, figure (4c) indicate that the epidemic could have been eliminated by
31st March, 2020 if the susceptible population have been reduced to 10 lakhs.

11

5.0.2. Impact of rapid isolation of infected individuals
COVID-19 is a global pandemic which is spreading all across the globe.
Early research shows that the disease transmission rate from an infected
individual to a susceptible is very high [16]. The transmission rate can be
reduced by isolating the infected individuals as quickly as possible. In this
subsection, with the help of numerical simulations we will show the variations
in infected population for different values of β, disease transmission rate from
infected individual to susceptible individuals.
Figure 5 shows various scenarios of the epidemic in Italy in case disease
transmission rate would have been timely controlled. A rapid isolation of
infected population will lead to reduce the disease transmission rate, β. From
figure 5, we see that as disease transmission rate, β is reduced from 0.7 to
0.4, it not only decrease the active number of infections from 45000 to 9000,
but also the overall lifespan of pandemic reduced from July 31 to April 20,
2020.

6. Pandemic in different Regions of Italy
In this section, we will study and analyze the spread of the pandemic in
different regions of Italy. There are few regions which have become hotspots
for the pandemic in the country. These regions include Lombardia, Emilia
Romagna, Piemonte and Veneto. In order to study the pandemic more precisely, we have assumed that the transmission rate in these regions varies from
the generalized transmission rate of Italy. This can be explained, as there is
a visible population gap in these regions. Also, we have assumed that by first
week of March, whole population of these regions is susceptible. Hence, we
have assumed that there are no new individuals available for recruitments,
hence A equals zero. For this purpose we have used the parameters values
available in Table 2. The disease transmission rate from exposed individuals
is also reduced to 0.4. All the remaining parameter values are considered to
be same as given in Table 1.

sub-figure 6b, we used our proposed model to predict the future of pandemic
in Lambardia. We see from the study that by mid July, the pandemic will
die out in this region. Figure 7 shows the case study of Emilia Romagna region of Italy. In figure (7a), we can see the accuracy of our proposed model.
Figure (7b) consist of the upcoming predicted scenario of the epidemic in
this region. According to our proposed model the pandemic will last till mid
July, 2020 in this particular region.
Figures 8 and 9 illustrate the behaviour of the pandemic in Piemonte and
Veneto regions respectively. Sub-figures (9a) and (10a) exhibit the authenticity of our proposed model with the officially reported COVID-19 cases in
these regions. The possible extinction of pandemic in these regions is shown
in sub-figures (8a) and (9a). According to our proposed model, the pandemic
in both of these regions will last till the last week of July, 2020. Also, it can
be observed from sub-figure (8b) that the active infected cases in Piemonte
will not surpass 18000. Whereas, the active infected cases in Veneto may hit
the 21000 mark ( see sub-fig 9b).

Figures 6, 7, 8 and 9 shows the accuracy of our model with the officially
reported data of these regions. Also, from our simulations, one can conclude
that the epidemic is yet to reach its peak.

7. Basic Reproduction Number
The basic reproduction number is one of the key parameter to examine
the long term behaviour of an epidemic. It can be defined as the number
of secondary cases produced by a single infected individual in its entire life
span as infectious agent. We have used next-generation matrix technique
explained in [18], to derive the expression of basic reproduction number R0 .
The R0 takes the following expression
β0 (α2 + θ + µ) + βα
(α + α1 + µ) (α2 + θ + µ)

R0 =

We will analyse the variation in R0 for different values of the parameters
involved in the model system. Figure 10 illustrates the simultaneous variation in the basic reproduction number for different values of corresponding
parameters. The parameter values used are given in Table 1.

8. Conclusion
A SEIR type compartmental model is proposed to study the current scenario of COVID-19 in Italy. Our proposed model accurately fits the officially
available data of the pandemic in Italy. Also, it is concluded from the study
that the pandemic may still grow in Italy till 30th April, 2020. The pandemic
may hit the 2.5 lacks active cases mark (see fig. 3) in Italy. Also, we have
discussed how the lock down that was imposed on 9th March, 2020 was a good
but a delayed decision of the government of Italy. Through simulations, we
have shown that a rapid isolation of the infective individuals and early lock
down in the country are two of the most efficient procedures to terminate
the spread of COVID-19. As of now, the vaccination of COVID-19 have not
been discovered. Hence, this research can also be beneficial for the countries
which are in the initial stage of the pandemic, as our research describes two
of the most effective procedures to counter the spread of the pandemic and
its long term impact on the spread of disease.
The expression of the basic reproduction number R0 is also derived. As our
proposed model involves various parameters, we have shown the sensitivity of
these parameters via numerical simulations. It is clear from the simulations
(see Fig. 10d) that the transmission rates, β and β0 are the most sensitive
parameters. The reproduction number can be minimized if we can reduce
these two parameters.
This research can be extended in various ways. One can refine the model by
introducing new compartments in order to examine the epidemic more precisely. There are certain assumptions which we have made while constructing
this model because of the limited data and short onset time. As more data
will be available in the future, this model can be trained with more real data
to increase its efficiency.
