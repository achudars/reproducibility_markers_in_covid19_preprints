Abstract
Inspired by recent work on anti-covid-19 drugs [2] here we study the Quantitativestructure property relationships(QSPR) of phytochemicals screened against SARSCoV-2 3CLpro with the help of topological indices like the first Zagreb index M1 ,
second Zagreb index M2 , Randić index R, Balban index J and sum-connectivity
index SCI(G). Our study has raveled that the sum-connectivity index (SCI) and
the first Zagreb index (M1 ) are two important parameters to predict the molecular
weight and the topological polar surface area of phytochemicals respectively.
Keywords: QSPR; Molecular descriptor; Zagreb indices.

Various clinicians and researchers are engaged in investigating and developing antivirals using different strategies combining experimental and in-silico approaches see
[1, 3, 5, 7–14, 14, 16, 17, 21–23]. The replication cycle of SARS-CoV-2 can be broadly divided into three processes viral entry, viral RNA replication and lastly, viral assembly
and exit from the host cell which is depicted in Figure 1.

Recent studies revealed that the genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is very similar to that

of SARS-CoV. Recently, Qamar et.al [14] reported the following phytochemicals screened
against SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro which are depicted in Figure 2.

Since physical properties or bioactivities are expressed in numbers whereas chemical structures are discrete graphs, in order to associate graphs with numbers one has to rely on
graph-theoretical invariants such as local vertex invariants, e.g. vertex degree, distance
sum, etc. Hundreds of topological indices have been introduced so far.
The main aim of this study is to develop a quantitative structure property relationship
between two-dimensional(2D) topological indices, calculated physicochemical parameters
of phytochemicals screened against SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro . Experimental data used in this
study were taken from [14]. In this paper we have considered five topological indices
viz., the first Zagreb index M1 (G) [6], the second Zagreb index M2 (G) [6], Randić index
R(G) [15], Balban index J(G) [2, 3] and the sum-connectivity index SCI(G) [25]. The
formulae for these topological indices are give below:

M1 (G) =

deg(u) · deg(v)

u∈V (G)

M2 (G) =

where w(u) (resp. w(v)) denotes the sum of distances from u (resp. v) to all the other
vertices of G.

The productivity of the above mentioned topological indices were tested using a data
set of phytochemical, found at [2] and https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/. The data
set consists of the following data: docking score, binding affinity, molecular weight and
topological polar surface, which is given in Table 1.

Regression Models

The following regression models have been used for the study:
• Linear Model: P = a(T I) + b
• Quadratic Model : P = a(T I)2 + b(T I) + c
• Logarithmic Model: P = a + b ln(T I)
• Multiple Linear Model: P = a(T I1 ) + b(T I2 ) + c(T I3 ) + d(T I4 ) + e(T I5 ) + f
where P is a physical property, T I is the topological index, a, b and c are constants.

the above mentioned topological indices.

By looking at the above table we can see that the predicting power of above mentioned
topological indices are good with respect to molecular weight of phytochemicals. The
correlation coefficient of the first Zagreb index (M1 ) lies between 0.718 to 0.777, whereas,
the range for the Zagreb index(M2 ) is lies between 0.672 to 0.742. For Randić(R) index
the r values is lies between 0.761 to 0.781 and for the Balban index J the r value ranging
from 0.159 to 0.472. Finally for sum-connectivity index, the r value lies between 0.761 to
0.791. Except, the Balban index, all T I 0 s are shows good correlation coefficient. Among
all T I 0 s, the sum-connectivity index SCI is a good candidate for predicting molecular
weight of phytochemicals.
Next we present the regression models for topological polar surface (TPA) of phytochemical with the above mentioned topological indices.

By looking at the above table we can see that the predicting power of above mentioned
topological indices are better with respect to topological polar surface area of phyto16

chemicals. The correlation coefficient of the first Zagreb index (M1 ) lies between 0.753
to 0.815, whereas, the range for the Zagreb index(M2 ) is lies between 0.726 to 0.811. For
Randić(R) index the r values is lies between 0.761 to 0.781 and for the Balban index
J the r value ranging from 0.749 to 0.774. Finally for sum-connectivity index, the r
value lies between 0.748 to 0.782. Among all T I 0 s, the first Zagreb index M1 has better
predicting power than other topological indices with respect to topological polar surface
area of phytochemicals.
Conclusion: The QSPR study has revealed that the molecular descriptors are best
candidates to predict the physicochemical properties of phyctochemicals. In particular,
the sum-connectivity index (SCI) and the first Zagreb index (M1 ) are two important
parameters to predict the molecular weight and the topological polar surface area of
phytochemicals respectively. Our study may help the researchers in the field of lifescience in finding the anti-covid-19 drugs.
