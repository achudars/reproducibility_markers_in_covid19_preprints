Abstract
The development of therapeutic targets for COVID-19 treatment is based on the understanding of the molecular
mechanism of pathogenesis. The identification of genes and proteins involved in the infection mechanism is
the key to shed out light into the complex molecular mechanisms. The combined effort of many laboratories
distributed throughout the world has produced the accumulation of both protein and genetic interactions. In this
work we integrate these available results and we obtain an host protein-protein interaction network composed
by 1432 human proteins. We calculate network centrality measures to identify key proteins. Then we perform
functional enrichment of central proteins. We observed that the identified proteins are mostly associated with
several crucial pathways, including cellular process, signalling transduction, neurodegenerative disease. Finally,
we focused on proteins involved in causing disease in the human respiratory tract. We conclude that COVID19 is a complex disease, and we highlighted many potential therapeutic targets including RBX1, HSPA5, ITCH,
RAB7A, RAB5A, RAB8A, PSMC5, CAPZB, CANX, IGF2R, HSPA1A, which are central and also associated
with multiple diseases.

1. Introduction
The world is experiencing an unprecedented pandemic due to a massive outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 ) infected viral disease, COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 , is a large
enveloped coronavirus (family-Coronaviridae, subfamily-Coronavirinae) with non-segmented, single-stranded,
and positive-sense RNA genomes [1], transmits rapidly through human to human contacts. Although SARS-CoV2 is similar to other known coronaviruses, i.e. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [2, 3], it has demonstrated high rates
of infection [4, 5]. Therefore there is the need to understand the disease pathogenesis of SAR-CoV-2 to develop
effective therapies and vaccines.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus is responsible COVID-19 disease that causes damages in multiple organs as the disease
progresses from an asymptomatic phase to a life-threatening disease [6]. Therefore, accurate molecular diagnosis
of COVID-19 disease is essential by collecting the proper respiratory tract specimen [7]. In this context, the integrated analysis [8] of various data-sets, including clinical and imaging data, may explain, and hopefully predict,
the longitudinal effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection [9, 10]. In particular, many independent projects throughout
the world have focused on genomics and proteomics level [10], and then they integrated these data with clinical ones. These works have produced data about the infection’s effect at a molecular scale, evidencing genes
and proteins’ role, such as the interactions among viral and human proteins. Interactions between a host and
its pathogen, are primarily driven by interactions among the host proteins and pathogen proteins; also referred
to as host-pathogen protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. The SARS-CoV-2 virus-host interactome have
been studied focusing various virulence factors influencing SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and interacting mechanism [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. Further, many recent works also used host-viral protein-protein interaction network
as an input to elucidate potential drug targets or repurposed drug molecules [17, 18, 19]. Host-pathogen protein
interactions provide important insights into the molecular mechanisms of pathogenecity [20] and for understanding virulence factors influencing SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis [21, 22]. SARS-CoV-2 is a newly found virus whose
interacting human host proteins play a major disease progression role that needs to be investigated.

Protein-Protein Interactions (PPI) are usually modelled and analysed with graph theory [23]. In this formalism,
the interactions are modelled as a graph whose nodes are proteins (or genes), and the edges are the interaction
among them. Several studies have found that specific candidate proteins might play a crucial role [24, 25, 26, 27].
Protein-protein interaction networks are an essential ingredient for any systems-level understanding of cellular
processes and modelling, and even drug discovery [28, 29, 30, 31, 32]. The key genes/proteins involved in the
different biological pathways can give valuable insight for in-depth characterisation of disease progression [33,
34, 35]. It is well accepted that all the viruses have evolved to target proteins that are central and have strong
control over the human interactome [36, 37, 38, 39, 40]. Exploring the predicted interaction networks can suggest
new directions for future experimental research and provide cross-species predictions for efficient interaction
mapping [41, 34]. The complete workflow of the current study can be seen from Figure 1.

Figure 1: The complete work-flow of the current study.

This study aims to identify essential human host proteins based on topology analysis of the protein-protein
interaction network of SARS-CoV-2 interacting human host proteins. We performed functional enrichment of the
identified proteins to shed out light on cellular, signalling, and disease pathways.
2. Materials and Method
2.1. Dataset: Curated SARS-CoV-2 interacting human host proteins
We use recently reported host proteins that are physically verified using Affinity purification mass spectrometry
for their interactions with SARS-CoV-2 [17, 21, 42]. The used host-viral protein interactions are also available in
BioGRID [43]. A total of 2489 host-viral interactions (consisting of 1432 unique host proteins interacting with 37
SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins) are obtained. In Figure 2, we provided the number of interacting host protein count.
It is noted that the majority of the host proteins are targeted to the specific viral protein.
2.2. Construction of Host PPI network
Starting with the human proteins that are interacting with the virus, we build a host PPI by querying the Search
Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING, Version 10.0; http://string-db.org/) [44].
The topology analysis of the PPI network is performed by using Cytoscape (http://apps.cytoscape.org),
a general platform for complex network analysis and visualization [45].
2.3. Centrality analysis of host PPI network
In network analysis, indicators of centrality identify the most critical nodes in the network [46]. The centrality measure uses to characterise each node and edge in the PPI network. The degree measure is the most
intuitive for topology analysis of the PPI network. Several other crucial factors that can influence network links
are betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, clustering coefficient, topological coefficient, and neighbourhood
connectivity.

interaction network pattern is also shown.

(i) Degree centrality: The degree centrality (simply degree) of a node n in a network is defined as (Dn ),
which indicates number of directly connected nodes to n. The densely connected nodes in PPI network is
considered hub nodes [47].
(ii) Betweenness centrality: Betweenness centrality quantifies the number of times a node acts as a bridge
along the shortest path between two other nodes [48]. The betweenness centrality of a node n is represented
as:
Cb (n) = ∑ (σst(n) /σst )
(1)
s6=n6=t

where σst is the total number of shortest paths from node s to node t and σst (n) is the number of those paths
that pass through n.
(iii) Closeness centrality: Closeness centrality is a way of detecting nodes that are able to spread information
very efficiently through the network [49]. It can be calculated as :
Cc (n) = 1/avg(L(m, n))

(2)

where L(m, n) is the length of shortest path between node n and m, and m denotes any other nodes that are
reachable to node n.
(iv) Average shortest-path length: Shortest-path length between two nodes (say n and m) in network topology
is defined as the number of minimum steps that required to traverse between node n and m![50]. The average
shortest path length (S p ) of node n is the average value of all pair of nodes shortest path from the node n.
(v) Clustering coefficient: Clustering coefficient is a measure of the degree to which nodes in a graph tend to
cluster together [51]. In undirected networks, the clustering coefficient Cn of a node n is defined as:
Cn = 2en /(kn (kn − 1))

(3)

where kn is the number of neighbors of n and en is the number of connected pairs between all neighbors of
n.
(vi) Topological coefficient: Topological coefficient is a relative measure for the extent to which a node shares
neighbors with other nodes [52]. The topological coefficient Tn of a node n with kn neighbors is computed
as follows:
Tn = avg(J(n, m))/kn
(4)
Where J(n, m) is defined for all nodes m that share at least one neighbour with n, and the value J(n, m) is
the number of neighbours shared between the nodes n and m, plus one if there is a direct link between n and
m.

3

(vii) Neighborhood connectivity: Neighborhood connectivity (Nc ) of a node n is defined as the average connectivity of all neighbors of n [53]. The neighborhood connectivity distribution gives the average of the
neighborhood connectivities of all nodes n with k neighbors for k = 0, 1, · · ·.
We used NetworkAnalyzer [45] to calculate above centrality score. In NetworkAnalyzer, Cc (Closeness centrality) is calculated as the reciprocal of the average shortest path length. So, high Cc means highly central, and
thus low S p .
2.4. Gene ontology and pathway enrichment analysis
We performed enrichment analysis to find out set of significantly enriched genes/proteins in different functional and biological pathways. We used KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) [54] for elucidating pathway enrichment of a host protein and Gene Ontology (GO) for the assessment of protein functions [55].
KEGG is a database resource for understanding high-level functions and utilities of the biological system [56].
2.5. Gene-disease association network
Complex diseases are caused by a group of genes known as disease genes. More often, a gene can participate in
various disease conditions [57, 58]. It helps unravel the disease pathogenesis, which in turn help disease diagnosis,
treatment, and disease prevention. We obtained gene-disease association network from DisGeNET (v7.0) database
(https://www.disgenet.org/), which contains 1,134,942 gene-disease associations (GDAs), between 21,671
genes and 30,170 disease [59]. From this database, we considered curated gene-disease associations only.
3. Results and Discussion
Here, we report the outcomes of intermediate steps to reach to our objective of isolating key host proteins
followed by their significance analysis.
3.1. Deriving PPI network for candidate host proteins
Our candidate host proteins list, collected from the reported host-viral networks (Section 2), consists of total of
1432 distinct proteins that are targeted by SARS-CoV-2 during COVID-19 . We rebuilt the PPI network centered
around our candidate proteins using STRING DB. There are 7076 edges in the derived PPI network. We curated
derived PPI by keeping only the interactions whose confidence scores are at least 0.7 (high confidence). The
derived PPI network is then analysed using Cytoscape. We identified the big connected component (also called
gain/main component) of the PPI network. After discarding all disconnected components in the PPI network, we
considered gain component of PPI network with 1111 nodes (Approx. 78%) and 7043 edges (Figure 3).
3.2. Network topology analysis of gain component
We performed topological analysis of the gain component using NetworkAnalyzer [45]. The degree distribution of all the candidate proteins in the gain component showed that the majority of the proteins in the gain
component exhibit a higher degree of connectivity (Figure 4). Few proteins with degree (shown within parentheses) more than 50 are CDK1(73), PPP2R1A(65), NOP56(60), POLR2B(60), RAB1A(59), RBX1(58), SKIV2L2(57),
NAPA(57), RPS14(56), STX5(54), TGOLN2(54), TCEB1(53), DCTN2(53), TCEB2(52), HSPA9(51), GNB2L1(50).
The histogram analysis of all the centrality measures (discussed in section 2.3) showing non-random distribution (Figure S1). We performed correlation (Pearson) analysis among all centrality scores (Table 1). The
correlation score between degree centrality (Dc ) scores and closeness centrality (Cc ) scores observed to be the
highest (r = 0.759) in comparison to other measures. Although, we observed correlation between DC and neighbourhood centrality (Nc ) is the third-highest (r = 0.557), but Nc and Bc showed less correlative (r = 0.1101).
Overall, we observed correlation score of three centrality measures (DC , Bc ,Cc ) are quite closer. Therefore, we
selected them in subsequent analysis. We identified 373 proteins in these criteria, which are considered highly
central proteins (above the median score for all three selected parameters). When we considered all measures, we
find only six common proteins (GEMIN4, DDX20, GOLGA3, FKBP15, PMPCA, AK4) above the median score in
each category of centrality measurement, and that is the reason why we selected three centrality measures for our
downstream analysis.

value..

3.3. Pathway enrichment analysis of highly central proteins
We performed KEGG pathway analysis of selected 373 highly central proteins. We obtained a total of 84
enriched KEGG pathways within the significant level (ad j − p < .05). The enriched pathways were involved in
Cellular Processes (9), Environmental Information Processing (9), Genetic Information Processing (13), Human
Disease (31), Organismal Systems (15), Metabolism (7). The top seven pathways in each category are shown in
Figure 5.
Our current study mainly focused on the proteins that are involved in cellular process, signalling transduction,
and human disease (viral and neurodegenerative) pathways, the most affected pathways in the context of COVID19 disease [60, 61, 62, 63]. There are nine enriched pathways in cellular process (Endocytosis, Phagosome, Adherens junction, Tight junction, Cell cycle, Cellular senescence, Focal adhesion, Regulation of actin cytoskeleton,
Lysosome), nine pathways in Environmental Information Processing-signalling transduction (Ras signalling
pathway, HIF-1 signalling pathway, Hippo signalling pathway, Apelin signalling pathway, MAPK signalling pathway, TGF-beta signalling pathway, AMPK signalling pathway, NF-kappa B signalling pathway), nine pathways
from human disease viral sub-category (Human immunodeficiency virus 1 infection, Human papillomavirus infection, Human cytomegalovirus infection, Hepatitis B, Human T-cell leukaemia virus 1 infection, Influenza A,
Hepatitis C, Measles) and four pathways from neurodegenerative disease with sub-category (Huntington disease, Parkinson disease, Alzheimer disease, Prion diseases). A total of 141 distinct proteins (out of 373) were
obtained from these pathways, which are then ranked based on presence in selected enriched pathways, and we
found that 79 proteins are associated in our candidate pathways. All these proteins were then further studied for

disease-gene association in the next.
We also performed gene set enrichment analysis (Gene ontology). It is observed that out of selected genes
mostly involved in Biological process (Supplementary-B). The top ten terms in each category of gene ontology
(BP, MF, CC) are shown in Figure 6 that includes neutrophil mediated immunity (GO:0002446), neutrophil activation involved in immune response (GO:0002283) and viral process (GO:0016032) from BP category; dolichyldiphosphooligosaccharide-protein glycotransferase activity (GO:0004579), GDP binding (GO:0019003), cadherin
binding (GO:0045296) and ATPase activity (GO:0016887) from MF category; and focal adhesion (GO:0005925)
from CC category.

3.4. Analysis of Disease-gene associations
The identified 141 genes involved in four significant pathways (cellular process, signalling transduction, viral
and neurodegenerative) are further screened by looking into their association with COVID-19 related disease. We
particularly focused on three highly influential diseases during COVID-19 , namely cardiovascular, respiratory
tract [64, 65, 66, 67] and immune system disease [68, 69]. To obtain disease-gene association, we used DisGeNET database [59] and selected CURET ED source only. We found a total of 64 proteins (out of 141) playing
roles in various diseases such as Asthma, Pneumonitis, Pneumonia, Influenza, Lung diseases, Cardiomyopathies,
Coronary, Arteriosclerosis, Coronary Artery Disease, Heart failure, HIV Infections etc.(Supplementary-C). We
compared proteins involved in all three disease categories and individual disease in each category (Figure 7). A
total of 119, 37, and 48 unique diseases, and 44, 17, and 24 distinct proteins are associated with the Cardiovascular, Respiratory, and Immune system disease category, respectively. Interestingly, we found a few proteins that are
associated with all three disease categories ( AREG, CAV1, IFIH1, PARP1, PLAU, TGFB1, ATM, B2M, DDX58,
ENO1, HSPA5, PRKDC, STAT6, TGFBR1, TGFBR2). The top few proteins with ten or more disease associations are PLAU(59), TGFB1(29), CAV1(17), PARP1(17), TGFBR2(13), ATP2A2(11), AREG(10), FASN(10),
IFIH1(10), ITGB1(10). The list of all 64 proteins and their associated quantitative parameters (degree, disease
count (out of 204), disease type count (out of 3), and pathway count(out of 31) are presented in Table 2.
3.5. Viral proteins targeting key proteins
We then looked into source network (Figure 2) to identify the viral proteins that are targeting our selected 65
disease associated proteins. We found 25 SARS-CoV-2 proteins that are interacting with 65 proteins. Among 25
SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins, eight are accessory proteins (Orf3a, Orf7b, Orf6, Orf7a, Orf7b, Orf8, Orf9b, Orf10),
four structural proteins (E,M,N,S) and thirteen non-structural poly-proteins (nsp1, nsp10, nsp12, nsp13, nsp14,
nsp2, nsp3, nsp4, nsp5, nsp6, nsp7, nsp8, nsp9). It is observed that several host proteins are interacting with single
viral protein. Very few host proteins are interacting with more than one viral proteins. The viral protein Orf7b
exhibits the maximum number of target host proteins followed by Orf3a and M protein. Further, five host proteins
are found to be common both in Orf3a and Orf7b.
We look further for any other viruses that are targeting our 65 host proteins. We mine VirusMINT [70], a
virus-host association database, to find the other related viral diseases. We found that the majority of the highlighted host proteins are also targeted by Hepatitis C virus genotype 1b, Poliovirus Type 1, Human herpesvirus
1, Human papillomavirus type 16 & 31, Simian virus 40, Sendai virus, Human adenovirus 5 & 12, Epstein-Barr
virus, Human SARS coronavirus Bovine papillomavirus type 1, and Epstein-Barr virus (Table 2). These proteins
might be highly essential and need to put uttermost importance on developing host-directed antiviral therapies
for COVID-19 .
4. Conclusion
In this study, we have analysed human host protein-protein interaction network during the SARS-CoV-2 infection. We identified a set of proteins, including RBX1, HSPA5, ITCH, RAB7A, RAB5A, RAB8A, PSMC5,
CAPZB, CANX, IGF2R, HSPA1A, which might influence the whole PPI network. These proteins were enriched
for the following processes: cellular process, signalling, and neurodegenerative disease pathways as these pathways are known to be highly infectious for disease pathogenesis during COVID-19 . Finally, we have found 64
potential/key SARS-CoV-2 interacting human host proteins connected with respiratory, cardiovascular, and immune system disease. Many of them are known to target different other viruses and may be highly important for
therapeutics treatment of COVID-19 viral disease. We strongly believe that the highlighted key proteins are an
extremely promising target, which might play a crucial role during COVID-19 disease progression.
