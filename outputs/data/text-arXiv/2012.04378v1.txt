Abstract
Forecasting the number of Olympic medals for each nation is highly relevant for different
stakeholders: Ex ante, sports betting companies can determine the odds while sponsors and
media companies can allocate their resources to promising teams. Ex post, sports politicians
and managers can benchmark the performance of their teams and evaluate the drivers of
success. To significantly increase the Olympic medal forecasting accuracy, we apply machine
learning, more specifically a two-staged Random Forest, thus outperforming more traditional
naïve forecast for three previous Olympics held between 2008 and 2016 for the first time.
Regarding the Tokyo 2020 Games in 2021, our model suggests that the United States will lead
the Olympic medal table, winning 120 medals, followed by China (87) and Great Britain (74).
Intriguingly, we predict that the current COVID-19 pandemic will not significantly alter the
medal count as all countries suffer from the pandemic to some extent (data inherent) and limited
historical data points on comparable diseases (model inherent).

Introduction
Predicting Olympic medal success has a long tradition in forecasting research, since the 1970s
[1]. In the early 2000s, the first use of a Tobit model [2] marked a milestone in this discipline
as it reflected the large number of nations without any medal success. Since then, the predictive
power of Tobit models gradually increased as authors operating in the field explored diverse,
increasingly extensive data sets [3–5]. While the Tobit model remains one of the most powerful
tools in Olympic forecasting until today, [6] could further increase the forecasting accuracy
using a more nuanced Hurdle model.
Forecasting the number of Olympic medals for each nation is highly relevant for different
stakeholders: Ex ante, sports betting companies can determine the odds while sponsors and
media companies can allocate their resources to promising teams. Ex post, sports politicians
and managers can benchmark the performance of their teams and evaluate the drivers of
success. Subsequently, they distribute monetary funds to prepare for the following sportive
event. The motivation behind is faceted ranging from economic and political consideration to
sheer national prestige [7].
Given the high relevance of Olympic forecasting, it is surprising that the potential of machine
learning has, to the best of our knowledge, never been exhausted in this context. However, this
methodology has recently received an increasing level of popularity in a sports context, e.g. in
football [8]. Particularly the Random Forest approach often delivers excellent results, be it in
forecasting football scores [9] or horseracing outcomes [10]. As acknowledged by [11],
statistical knowledge can be applied in the world of machine learning as well.
This paper translates the proven concept of the Tobit model to machine learning by using a twostaged Random Forest model. That way, we identified the, to the best of our knowledge, first
model to consistently outperform the naïve forecasting model, i.e. to assume the medal count
of the previous Olympics, in three consecutive Summer Games (2008, 2012, and 2016) by 3-4
2

percentage points. On a side note, we thus also improve the forecasting accuracy presented in
more recent work [6] by 20 percentage points.
We can explain the significant increase in predictive accuracy based on two effects: First, [6]
build on a generalized linear model in form of a Hurdle, respectively Tobit, model. We, in
contrast, apply a two-staged Random Forest algorithm taking into account more complex, nonlinear interactions. Second, it is often argued that the time to prepare an Olympic team is four
years [e.g. 4,6]. This would imply that, ideally, only socio-economic data until 2016 should be
used to predict the Tokyo 2020 results. However, [12] evaluate different sports forecasting
methodologies and find that more recent data generate better results. Thus, we include data until
2020 in our model to overcome this issue, which is even amplified by the WHO’s decision to
declare COVID-19 a pandemic [13] and the subsequent postponement of the Games to 2021
[14].
Our forecasts for Tokyo 2020, suggest that the United States will lead the medal count scoring
120 medals (-1 compared to 2016), followed by China (86 medals, +17 compared to 2016),
Great Britain (74, +7), Russia (64, +7), and Japan (50, +10). Intriguingly, COVID-19 will only
slightly affect the leading board: We predict that the United States do not exhibit a change in
the number of medals as compared to a non-pandemic scenario, and also the rank of the top-10
nations remains the same. Most top-20 nations are characterized by small improvements as they
profit from the pandemic hitting the remaining nations even harder. Notable exceptions are
Spain (-2 medals compared to a hypothetic no COVID-19 scenario) and Brazil (-2), which
suffer particularly hard under COVID-19.
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: After an introduction to our model, we
evaluate the quality of the forecast, present a forecast for Tokyo 2020 and discuss the
implications of COVID-19. Finally, we conclude with a summary and an outlook for further
research.

Material and Methods
We forecast the number of medals in the Tokyo Olympic Games for each participating nation
based on a two-staged Random Forest. As one part of this exercise, we quantify the impact of
COVID-19 on the expected Olympic medal count based on the features national GDP, incidents
of and deaths from lower respiratory diseases.
We consider distinct supervised learning models, such as classical regression learners, boosting
algorithms, ensemble learning and neural networks. We avoid overfitting by a strict timeconsistent data-split in trainings-, test- and validation-data. Based on a direct benchmarking by
forecasting the Olympic Games 2008, we determine our model of choice. Subsequently, we
forecast the Olympic Games 2012 and 2016 to confirm the robustness of the selected model.
As the Random Forest outperforms all other models, we eventually select this algorithm to
forecast the Tokyo 2020 Games.

Data input
Most scholars use the number of medals as dependent variable [e.g. 3, 6]. Taking the logarithm
allows us to reduce the (right-) skewness from 3.2 to 0.4 (among non-zero medals due to the
definition of logarithm).
In Table 1, we summarize all features (independent variables), their respective sources, last
updated on 04.08.2020, and basic statistics. [12] find that more recent data generate better
results in sports forecasting. Thus, we leverage data from one year prior to the Olympics to
make a forecast.

We display all values from 1991 to 2016 as 2020 medals are not known yet. The feature "Previous Medals" is based on "Number of medals", i.e.
non-logarithmic. The above-mentioned GDP is already normalised as described in the text.
6

Like the dependent variable, some features need to be further transformed. To account for the
character of the Olympic Games as a competition, we normalize and use the share of a nation
in the global GDP. As the number of world-class athletes in a country is exhausted at some
point and population alone does not lead to more medals anymore (example India), we take the
logarithm of the population which grows slower than a linear function. [6] suggest the use of
categorical variables in some cases, e.g. for the number of participating athletes. The rationale
here is that the final number of competitors is generally not known at the time of forecasting.
Furthermore, the categories suggested in the paper have rarely changed in the past. As an
example, Afghanistan has always sent between zero and nine athletes since 1992. Before
forming these groups, we count athletes that started in multiple disciplines multiple times as
their chances to win a medal multiply.
While existing research confirms an impact of specific socio-economic variables, such as GDP
or political system, on the number of medals in the Tokyo Olympic Games [6], the connection
of sportive performance and public health crises was not to be presumed before the COVID-19
crisis. This pandemic affected not only health-related figures, such as the rate of incidents of
and deaths from lower respiratory infections but also economic figures, such as the GDP. As
COVID-19 incidents and deaths were reported in detail and GDP figures were updated
according to account for the impact of the pandemic, we can define two scenarios: with and
without COVID-19. We categorise incidents of and deaths from lower respiratory diseases in
quintiles to limit the effect of potential outliers. Being able to retrieve data points of 206
countries between 1991 and 2020, we can feed our models with 1,379 country-year
observations.

Data enhancement
As Olympic teams do not necessarily match the country list in other data sources, we need to
aggregate socio-economic data to adequately represent Olympic teams, e.g. by adding the
population of Anguilla to Great Britain. In 2016, we attribute nine International Olympic
7

Athletes (IOA) winning two medals to Kuwait and the Unified Team (EUN) to Russia as this
best reflects socio-economic data. Russian athletes might again participate as a neutral team in
2020. In this case our prediction applies to Russian athletes. We split the athletes (269) and
medals (7) of Czechoslovakia into Czech Republic (178 / 5) and Slovakia (91 / 2) based on
their respective population. The Refugee Olympic Team (12 athletes in 2016) has not won a
medal yet. Hence, we assume a constant forecast meaning that there will be no medals in 2020
either.
We obtain missing data points in a specific year by inter- / extrapolation. While linear
interpolation is straightforward, we extrapolate constantly based on the first (respectively last)
available value. This way we do not mis-interpret local events. Exceptions are GDP and
population which typically inhibit a consistent growth. Where not more than five consecutive
points are missing and there are more data points available than missing, we extrapolate linearly
to take this trend into account by using a constrained least-squares approach: With n<6 missing
values, we use the n+1 nearest available values to estimate the slope of the line. The intercept
is given by the nearest available value.
If there are no data points for one country available at all, we leverage the average of the
respective region as benchmark. The rationale here is that countries within one region also share
socio-economic characteristics, such as economic strength.
As the totals of socio-economic variables do not change at the same rate as the totals of Olympic
medals, we cannot expect an exact match between forecast and available medals. Thus, we need
to rescale the results to the expected number of medals (i.e. to three times the number of
scheduled events assuming no double bronze). Rounding is necessary to get natural numbers.

Model selection
We implement all our models in Python 3.8.5 [25] using the packages pandas 1.1.2 [26], scikitlearn 0.23.2 [27], XGboost 1.2.0 [28], and NumPy 1.18.5 [29].

Applying both, statistical models and machine learning, always risks spurious predictions due
to overfitting the available data [30,31]. This is particularly relevant when only limited data is
available. For this reason, we apply a rigorous time-consistent data separation to avoid cases of
overfitting and obtain impartial and robust results. We use data collected from the years 1991
to 2004 as the training set, to fit models during the model selection. Furthermore, we use data
from the 2008 Olympic Games as the test set, to evaluate and compare the performance of the
models during the model selection. Only when we have selected the final model, we evaluate it
on the validation set, which includes data of the 2012 and 2016 Olympic Games. Thus,
overfitting is impossible in forecasts beyond 2008.
We consider the share of nations with a correct forecast of the number of medals in the 2008
Olympic Games as indicator to determine the best model.
The Tobit model marked a milestone in Olympic medal forecasting accounting for the large
number of nations without any medals [2]. We adopt this philosophy in a machine learning
context leading to a hybrid model with two stages. As a first step, we train a binary classifier to
identify nations winning at least one medal. As a second step, we train a regression model to
predict the number of medals for these countries.
As classifier, we consider a support vector machine and a Random Forest with ten trees (ten
trees deliver superior results compared to one, a hundred, and a thousand in this specific setup).
As regression model, we consider a range of classical regressions (linear regression, support
vector machine and decision tree), a Random Forest (with 1,000 trees allowing us to determine
confidence intervals based on ensembles of ten trees) as an ensemble learner, boosting methods
(AdaBoost and XGboost), and neural networks. The Random Forest shows the best
performance, both, as the classifier and the regression model, leading to a two-staged Random
Forest as model of choice. We confirm the robustness in forecasts of the 2012 and 2016 results.
The holistic forecasting process is illustrated in Fig 1.

Results
While [6] improved the prior forecast quality, the presented models still fail to outperform a
naïve forecast, i.e. assuming that each country wins exactly the same number of medals as in
the previous Olympics. The approach presented in this paper is, to the best of our knowledge,
the first to consistently beat the naïve forecast for the 2008, 2012, and 2016 Games (Table 2).
Besides the naïve forecast, we include five other models from three different papers in the
benchmark. We evaluate the forecast accuracy, i.e. the share of correctly predicted medals, in
total and for all nations winning zero, respectively more than zero medals. Furthermore, we
check whether the forecast lies in a 95% confidence interval augmented by two medals. Finally,
we sum the absolute deviation of forecast and actual medals of the top-17 nations as suggested
by [6]. Note that our sample includes 203 (in 2008), 205 (in 2012), respectively 206 (in 2016)
participating nations, while [4] models 127, [3] models 20, and [6] models 192 nations.

Applying the algorithm in the context of Tokyo 2020, we find that there will be no movement
on the top of the medal count (Table 3). While the United States are predicted to defend their
top position, the distance to the pursuers China (+17 medals compared to 2016), Great Britain
(+7), and Russia (+7) should melt.

Discussion
To understand the main drivers behind the forecasts, we use the explanatory SHAP value [32].
The most important features are the number of medals won at the previous Olympic Games,
the categorical variable representing the team size (more than 150 athletes), and the normalized
GDP (Fig 2). All of them, generally, have a positive impact on the number of medals won.

14

Fig 2. Feature importance of the Two-Staged Random Forest.

Only the 20 most relevant features are depicted. One dot represents one observation in the
training data, i.e. one Olympia-nation-combination. Variables are ranked in descending order
according to their feature importance. The horizontal location shows whether the effect of the
value is associated with a higher or lower prediction. Color shows whether that variable is
high (in red) or low (in blue) for each observation. A high “Number of Medals at previous
Olympics” has a high and positive impact on the number of medals at the current Olympics.
The “high” comes from the red color, and the “positive” impact is shown on the X-axis.
Similarly, the “Diseases Deaths” is negatively correlated with the dependent variable.
Three of the features are directly impacted by COVID-19: GDP, incidents of and deaths from
lower respiratory diseases. GDP forecasts had been adjusted by the International Monetary
Fund at the peak of the pandemic while the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation
diligently tracks COVID-19 incidents and deaths. All these features significantly impact the
number of medals. This allows us to create a theoretical scenario without the presence of the
15

pandemic, such that we can clearly quantify the impact of the pandemic (Table 4). We find that
there is little movement caused by COVID-19 amongst the top-20 nations. However, the severe
impact of the pandemic on the American economy and health system might cause a further
reduction of the advance of the United States although absolute medal figures remain largely
constant.

We expect the highest gains in China (+2). Although the pandemic originated in China, the
country was hit less severe in global comparison. We illustrate the main drivers of this
development (Fig 3). Compared to the no COVID-19 scenario, China could slightly increase
its share in the world’s GDP versus weaker economies around the globe. On a practical level,
16

this means that training measures and competitions as preparation for Tokyo 2020, do not have
to be cancelled unexpectedly to cover funds in other areas. Both incidents of and deaths from
lower respiratory diseases remained on a low level. Altogether, we experience no change in the
medal forecast for the Chinese team. However, as the total number of medals forecast by the
model declines, scaling moves China up in the medal count.

Conclusions
Applying a two-staged Random Forest, we significantly improved the forecasting accuracy
regarding Olympic medals outperforming a naïve model and currently existing statistical
approaches applied in the academic literature. A forecast of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games
hosted in 2021 suggests that the United States lead the medal count followed by China and
Great Britain. Particularly China, that has largely invested in sports development, is likely to
exhibit a rise in medals. As a result, sponsors of Tokyo 2020 and media companies could
allocate their resources to promising Chinese athletes. Sports betting companies might even
align their odds.
COVID-19 hardly impacts the number of medals among the top-20 nations. However, decision
trees generally (and hence the two-staged Random Forest) exhibit weaknesses regarding
extrapolation, in this case caused by the surge in incidents of and deaths from COVID-19 [e.g.
33]. Training our model with the upcoming Olympic Games is likely to quantify the impact of
a pandemic like COVID-19 more reliably.
Two further ways to improve the performance of the model are the inclusion of additional
features and a novel approach for missing data points:
First, socio-economic, e.g. investments in sports infrastructure, athlete-specific, e.g. age or
disciplines of athletes, and COVID-specific, e.g. number of cancelled national sports events,
deliver additional insights and, thus, might improve the forecasting accuracy. [34] use social
media data to forecast football matches, which is an approach that could be applied to Olympic
Games as well. However, as machine learning methodologies are prone to overfitting, adding
new feature is only possible to some extent.
Second, while we use inter- and extrapolation to handle missing data points, [35] generate the
missing values using their probability distribution function. This approach outperforms the

19

conventional mean-substitution approach, however, superiority to inter- and extrapolation, as
applied in this paper, still needs to be proven.
As the Olympic Games are not the only important global sports event, both, the comprehensive
data set and concept of the two-staged Random Forest, presented in this paper serves as a
fundament for future research in sports forecasting and can be leveraged in the context of other

Confidence intervals are computed by grouping the 1,000 decision trees of the Random Forest
in 100 groups of 10 decision trees. Within these groups serving as smaller Random Forests
mean values are computed. The 100 obtained data points are reduced by eliminating the five
data points with the greatest deviation from the mean. The remaining 95 values determine the
95% confidence interval. Confidence intervals are only computed for nations with predicted
medal success.
