Abstract
The paper explores and analyses the trend of world literature on “Coronavirus Disease” in terms
of the output of research publications as indexed in the Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-E)
of Web of Science during the period from 2011 to 2020. The study found that 6071 research
records have been published on Coronavirus Disease till March 20, 2020. The various
scientometric components of the research records published in the study period were studied.
The study reveals the various aspects of Coronavirus Disease literature such as year wise
distribution, relative growth rate, doubling time of literature, geographical wise, organization
wise, language wise, form wise , most prolific authors, and source wise. The highest number of
articles was published in the year 2019, while lowest numbers of research article were reported
in the year 2020. Further, the relative growth rate is gradually increases and on the other hand
doubling time decreases. Most of the research publications are published in English language and
most of the publications published in the form of research articles. USA is the highest contributor
to the field of Coronavirus Disease literature.
Keywords: COVID-19, Coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, Wuhan Epidemic, VOSviewer, Histcite,

Introduction
Since a cluster of unidentified pneumonia patients was found in December 2019 in Wuhan,
China, a new Coronavirus (CoV), which was momentarily named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019nCoV) by the World Health Organization (WHO) on January 7, 2020, unexpectedly came into
our prospect (Huang et al., 2020). The virus was consequently renamed Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the disease it causes was named
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). As of March 27, 2020, there have been more than
566,269 patients confirmed positive by nucleic acid testing in China and 200 other countries,
areas or territories and it has caused 25,423 deaths due to acute respiratory failure or other

related complications. In addition, more than 391,904 currently infected patients were isolated
and are being treated of them 371935 (95%) are in mild condition and 19,969 (5%) patients are
in serious or critical condition. On January 31, WHO announced the explosion of COVID-19 in
China as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. In 2002-2003, more than 8000
patients suffered from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) due to a coronavirus, with
774 virus associated deaths reported to WHO. Since September 2012, there were 2494
laboratory-confirmed cases of contagion with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus
(MERS-CoV),with 858 virus-related deaths reported to WHO (World Health Organization,
2004, 2013). All 3 of these rising infectious diseases leading to a global spread are caused by βcoronaviruses.
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a recently discovered
Coronavirus. Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will familiarity mild to moderate
respiratory illness and get well without requiring extraordinary treatment. Older people and
those with fundamental health problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory
disease, and cancer are more likely to widen severe illness. At this time, there are no explicit
vaccines or treatments for COVID-19. However, there are many constant clinical trials
evaluating impending treatments (World Health Organization, 2020).
SARS-CoV-2 is intimately associated to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome-like
coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21. It is spread by human-to-human
diffusion via droplets or direct contact, and infection has been projected to have incubation
period of 2-14 days, however, a case with and incubation period of 27 days has been reported by
Hubei Province local government on 22 February 2020. Mean incubation period observed in
travellers from Wuhan 6.4 days (range from 2.1 to 11.1 days).
The COVID-19 virus affects different people in different ways. COVID-19 is a respiratory
disease and most contaminated people will develop placid to moderate symptoms and pick up
without requiring extraordinary treatment. People who have primary remedial circumstances and
those over 60 years old have a higher risk of mounting severe disease and death. Common
symptoms comprise: fever, tiredness, dry cough. Other symptoms include: shortness of breath,
aches and pains, sore throat, and very few people will report diarrhea, nausea or a runny nose.
In China, prior outbreaks of emerging infections have had an inauspicious impact on the blood
supply (Shan & Zhang, 2004). However, reflection must also be given to the safety of the

transfusion receiver even if the emerging infection is a respiratory disease. Previous studies
indicated that viral RNA could be detected from plasma or serum of patients infected with
SARS-CoV (Drosten et al., 2003; Grant et al., 2003; Ng et al., 2003), MERS-CoV (Corman et
al., 2015), or SARS-CoV-2 (Huang et al., 2020) during different periods after the inception of
symptoms. However, the finding of viral RNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is not
comparable to the detection of intact infectious virus. Although WHO noted in 2003 that no
cases of SARS-CoV have been reported due to transfusion of blood products, there was still a
speculative risk of transmission of SARS-CoV through transfusion. With more and more
asymptomatic infections being originate among COVID-19 cases, blood safety is commendable
of contemplation. 3.4% mortality rate has been predictable by the WHO as of March 3, 2020. In
his opening remarks at the March 3 media briefing on Covid-19, WHO Director-General Dr
Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus stated: “Globally, about 3.4% of reported cases have died. By
comparison, seasonal flu generally kills far less than 1% of those infected” (World Health
Organization, 2020).
Wuhan (the city where the virus originated) is the largest city in Central China, with a population
of over 11 million people. The city, on January 23, shut down transport links. Following Wuhan
lock down, the city of Huanggang was also positioned in quarantine, and the city of Ezhou
closed its train stations. This means than 18 million people have been placed in isolation. The
World Health Organization (WHO) said cutting off a city as large as Wuhan is "unprecedented in
public health history" (Reuters, 2020) and praised China for its incredible dedication to
segregate the virus and diminish the spread to other countries.
The novel coronavirus' case fatality rate has been expected at around 2%, in the WHO press
conference held on January 29, 2020 (WorldoMeter, 2020). However, it noted that, without
knowing how many were infected, it was too early to be able to put a percentage on the mortality
rate figure. A prior approximation (Wang, Horby, Hayden, & Gao, 2020) had put that number at
3%. Fatality rate can change as a virus can transform, according to epidemiologists. For
comparison, the case fatality rate for SARS was 10%, and for MERS 34%.
Review of Literature
The review, in general, provides an overview of the theory and the research literature, with a
special emphasis on the literature specific to the topic of investigation. It provides support to the
proposition of one’s research, with ample evidences drawn from subject experts and authorities

in the concerned field. The sources consulted for the review of literature here includes
Scientometric studies related materials drawn from Primary periodicals.
(Batcha & Ahmad, 2017) obtained the analysis of two journals Indian Journal of Information
Sources and Services (IJSS) which is of Indian origin and Pakistan Journal of Library and
Information Science (PJLIS) from Pakistan origin and studied them comparatively with
scientometric indicators like year wise distribution of articles, pattern of authorship and
productivity, degree of collaboration, pattern of co-authorship, average length of papers, average
keywords, etc and found 138 (94.52%) of contributions from IJISS were made by Indian authors
and similarly 94 (77.05) of contributions from PJLIS were done by Pakistani authors. The
collaboration with foreign authors of both the countries is negligible (1.37% of articles) from
India and (4.10% of articles) from Pakistan.
(Ahmad, Batcha, Wani, Khan, & Jahina, 2018) studied Webology journal one of the reputed
journals from Iran through scientometric analysis. The study aims to provide a comprehensive
analysis regarding the journal like year wise growth of research articles, authorship pattern,
author productivity, and subjects taken by the authors over the period of 5 years from 2013 to
2017. The findings indicate that 62 papers were published in the journal during the study period.
The articles having collaborative nature were high in number. Regarding the subject
concentration of papers of the journal, Social Networking, Web 2.0, Library 2.0 and
Scientometrics or Bibliometrics were highly noted. The results were formulated through standard
formulas and statistical tools.
(Batcha, Jahina, & Ahmad, 2018) has examined the DESIDOC Journal by means of various
scientometric indicators like year wise growth of research papers , authorship pattern, subjects
and themes of the articles over the period of five years from 2013 to 2017. The study reveals that
227 articles were published over the five years from 2013 to 2017. The authorship pattern was
highly collaborative in nature. The maximum numbers of articles (65 %) have ranged their
thought contents between 6 and 10 pages.
(Ahmad & Batcha, 2019) analyzed research productivity in Journal of Documentation (JDoc) for
a period of 30 years between 1989 and 2018. Web of Science a service from Clarivate Analytics
has been consulted to obtain bibliographical data and it has been analysed through Bibexcel and
Histcite tools to present the datasets. Analysis part deals with local and global citation level
impact, highly prolific authors and their research output, ranking of prominent institution and

countries. In addition to this scientographical mapping of bibliographical data is obtainable
through VOSviewer, which is open source mapping software.
(Ahmad & Batcha, 2019) studied the scholarly communication of Bharathiar University which is
one of the vibrant universities in Tamil Nadu. The study find out the impact of research
produced, year-wise research output, citation impact at local and global level, prominent authors
and their total output, top journals of publications, top collaborating countries which collaborate
with the university authors, highly industrious departments and trends in publication of the
university during 2009 through 2018. During the 10 years of study under consideration it
indicates that a total of 3440 research articles have been published receiving 38104 citations
having h-index as 68. In addition the study used scientographical mapping of data and presented
it through graphs using VOSviewer software mapping technique.
(Ahmad, Batcha, & Jahina, 2019) quantitatively measured the research productivity in the area of
artificial intelligence at global level over the study period of ten years (2008-2017). The study
acknowledged the trends and features of growth and collaboration pattern of artificial
intelligence research output. Average growth rate of artificial intelligence per year increases at
the rate of 0.862. The multi-authorship pattern in the study is found high and the average number
of authors per paper is 3.31. Collaborative Index is noted to be the highest range in the year 2014
with 3.50. Mean CI during the period of study is 3.24. This is also supported by the mean degree
of collaboration at the percentage of 0.83 .The mean CC observed is 0.4635. Regarding the
application of Lotka’s Law of authorship productivity in the artificial intelligence literature it
proved to be fit for the study. The distribution frequency of the authorship follows the exact
Lotka’s Inverse Law with the exponent á = 2. The modified form of the inverse square law, i.e.,
Inverse Power Law with á and C parameters as 2.84 and 0.8083 for artificial intelligence
literature is applicable and appears to provide a good fit. Relative Growth Rate [Rt(P)] of an
article gradually increases from -0.0002 to 1.5405, correspondingly the value of doubling time of
the articles Dt(P) decreases from 1.0998 to 0.4499 (2008-2017). At the outset the study reveals
the fact that the artificial intelligence literature research study is one of the emerging and
blooming fields in the domain of information sciences.
(Batcha, Dar, & Ahmad, 2019) presented a scientometric analysis of the journal titled
“Cognition” for a period of 20 years from 1999 to 2018. The study was conducted with an aim to
provide a summary of research activity in the journal and characterize its most aspects. The

research coverage includes the year wise distribution of articles, authors, institutions, countries
and citation analysis of the journal. The analysis showed that 2870 papers were published in
journal of Cognition from 1999 to 2018. The study identified top 20 prolific authors, institutions
and countries of the journal.

Researchers from USA have made the most percentage of

contributions.
Objectives
The present manuscript aims to study the various dimensions of coronavirus research output in
terms of various scientometric indicators, based on publication and citation data, derived from
Web of Science database during 2011-2020. In particular, the study analyzed overall annual and
cumulative growth of global publications with relative growth rate and doubling time, its share
among top 20 most productive countries, publication output distribution by document type and
language used for scholarly communication, productivity and citation impact of most productive
institutions and authors, and leading media of communication.
Methodology
For the present study, the publication data was retrieved and downloaded from Web of Science
database on Coronavirus research during 2011-2020. A main search strategy for global output
was formulated, where the keyword such as “Coronavirus Disease, OR Coronavirus OR COVID19” were searched within “Topic” category and further limited the search output to period 20112020 within “Timespan”. This search strategy generated 6071 publications on Coronavirus from
Web of Science database. The year of publication, citations, source wise distribution, form wise,
language used for the medium of scholarly communication, institutions and authors were
analyzed and displayed in tables and scientographs by using Histcite and VOSviewer
respectively. The global citation scores and local citation scores were examined to identify the
pattern of research contribution on Coronavirus.
Discussion and Result
Evaluate the Annual Output of Publications
The global research output in coronavirus disease research cumulated to 6071 publications in 10
years during 2011-2020 and they increased from 383 in the year 2020 to 747 publications in the
year 2016. The data from Table 1 reveals that the numbers of research documents published from
2011 to 2020 shows fluctuation in publication trend. According to the publication output from

the Table 1 the year wise distribution of research documents, 2016 has the highest number of
research documents 747 (12.30%) with 4362 (11.62%) of total local citation score and 9729
(10.09%) of total global citation score values and being prominent among the 10 years output
and it stood in first rank position. The year 2014 has 715 (11.78%) research documents and it
stood in second position with 8468 (22.56%) of total local citation score and 18824 (20.02%) of
total global citation score were scaled. It is followed by the year 2019 with 714 (11.76 %) of
records and it stood in third rank position along with 306 (0.97%) of total local citation score and
1039 (1.08%) of total global citation score measured. The year 2015 has 692 (11.40%) research
documents and it stood in fourth position with 5118 (13.64%) of total local citation score and
13056 (13.53%) of total global citation score were scaled. It has been observed that increase in
publications in the research hasn’t direct impact on citation score. The table presents the year
wise publications and depicts the citation score. It clearly indicates on the fact that increase in
publication rate is not directly linked to increase in citation Score.

Relative Growth Rate and Doubling Time
It is very clear that the relative growth rate of total literature outputs published has been
progressively improved. The growth rate is 0.64 in 2012, which is increased up to 2.76 in 2020.
The mean relative growth rate is 1.44 during the period 2011-2020. Generally, the relative
growth rate of publications of all sources in this data has shown an increasing trend. The mean
doubling time is 0.47 during the period 2011-2020. In general, the doubling time of scholarly
publications of all sources in this research output has also shown a decreasing trend.

Distribution of Language of Publications
Table 4 reveals the language of publications. The research literature output in Coronavirus
Disease during the period of coverage was found to be in 15 languages among which English
was predominant with 98.53%. Non-English contributions belonging to other 14 languages
shared 1.47% of the total output forming a meagre number. English proved to be the lingua
franca to the scientific community engaged in coronavirus or Covid-19 research across the
world. Out of the 1.47% of non-English literature, a majority was in European languages that
included French, Spanish, German, Hungarian, Polish, Italian, Dutch, Portuguese and clusters
around Russia. Turkish, Chinese, Czech, Greek and Slovene also figured in. There was a single
article in Czech, Greek and Slovene Languages while there was not even a single one in Hindi.

Analysis of the Publication Output of Top 20 Authors
The ranking of authors of various research articles is displayed in Table 7 and figure 2. In the
rank analysis, the authors who have published less than 43 articles were not considered into
account to avoid a long list. It is observed that there are a total of 21066 authors for 6071 records
and it shows the top 20 most productive authors during 2011-2020. Drosten C published 114
(1.90%) articles with 6104 TGCS articles, followed by Memish ZA 112 (1.80%) with 5445
TGCS articles, Yuen KY 104 (1.70%) with 4362 TGCS articles, Baric RS 93 (1.50%) with 3123
TGCS articles, Perlman S 85 (1.40%) with 2452 TGCS article, Woo PCY 78 (1.30%) with 2750
TGCS articles, Al-Tawfiq JA 73 (1.20%) with 3046 TGCS, Lau SKP 72 (1.20%) with 2204
TGCS and other authors have contributed less than 1.20% during the period of study. The data
set clearly depicts that the number of publication by an author doesn’t necessarily determine the
quality of publications alone as shown in the form of total global citation score. It could be

identified from author wise analysis the following authors: Drosten C, Memish ZA, Yuen KY,
Baric RS, Perlman S, Woo PCY, Al-Tawfiq JA, Lau SKP, Jiang SB, and Haagmans BL are the
most productive authors based on the number of research papers published in the Coronavirus
research. The data set puts forth that the authors Drosten C with 6104 citations, Memish ZA with
5445 citations, Yuen KY with 4362 citations and Muller MA with 3822 citations.
