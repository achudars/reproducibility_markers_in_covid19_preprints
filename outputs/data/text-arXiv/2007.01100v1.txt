Abstract:
The outbreak of COVID-19 is a public health pandemic that raises wide concerns worldwide,
leading to serious health, economic, and social challenges. The rapid spread of the virus at a
global scale highlights the need for a more harmonized, less privacy-concerning, easily accessible
approach to monitoring the human mobility that has been proved to be associated with the viral
transmission. In this study, we analyzed 587 million tweets worldwide to see how global
collaborative efforts in reducing human mobility are reflected from the user-generated
information at the global, country, and the U.S. state scale. Considering the multifaceted nature
of mobility, we propose two types of distance: the single-day distance and the cross-day distance.
To quantify the responsiveness in certain geographic regions, we further propose a mobilitybased responsive index (MRI) that captures the overall degree of mobility changes within a time
window. The results suggest that mobility patterns obtained from Twitter data are amendable to
quantitatively reflect the mobility dynamics. Globally, the proposed two distances had greatly
deviated from their baselines after March 11, 2020 when WHO declared COVID-19 as a
pandemic. The considerably less periodicity after the declaration suggests that the protection
measures have obviously affected people’s travel routines. The country scale comparisons reveal
the discrepancies in responsiveness, evidenced by the contrasting mobility patterns in different
epidemic phases. We find that the triggers of mobility changes correspond well with the national
announcements of mitigation measures, proving that Twitter-based mobility implies the
effectiveness of those measures. In the U.S., the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on
mobility is distinct. However, the impacts varied substantially among states. The strong mobility
recovering momentum is further fueled by the Black Lives Matter protests, potentially fostering
the second wave of infections in the U.S.

1. Introduction
The outbreak of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus is a public
health emergency that raises wide concerns worldwide, leading to serious health, economic,
and social challenges. As of June 23, 2020, there had been a total of 8,993,659 infections and
469,587 deaths globally [1], and these figures are progressively increasing every day. On
March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) reassessed the situation and officially
declared COVID-19 as a pandemic, urging countries and regions worldwide to join forces [2].
Since then, major behavioral, clinical, and intervention policies (both strict and loose) have
been undertaken to reduce the spread and prevent the persistence of the virus in human
populations.
Initially discovered in Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019 [2], an outbreak of COVID19 was first declared in mainland China in January 2020, before it spread out to European
countries, most notably Italy, France, and the U.K, where a significant increase of cases and
deaths was noticed after the outbreak in China. In the United States, the first confirmed case
occurred on January 19, 2020, in Snohomish County, Washington. Shortly after, the United
States has become the new epicenter of the disease as it surpassed Italy in terms of confirmed
cases on March 26, 2020 [3]. As of May 31, 2020, there had been a total of 2,302,288 confirmed
cases (25.6% of global cases) and 120,333 deaths (25.6% of global deaths) in the U.S. alone,
according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). To contain the
COVID-19 pandemic, one of the non-pharmacological epidemic control measures is to reduce
the transmission rate of SARS-COV-2 in the population via social distancing or other similar
(self) quarantine measures [4], with the ultimate goal to reduce person-to-person interactions.
Studies have found notable declines in transmission rates after the implementation of mobilityreducing policies in China, Korea, and many European countries [5-8]. Despite the success of
these efforts, not all countries/regions chose to handle the pandemic in a similar manner [9,
10]. The discrepancies in policies and measures at different geographical levels urge an
approach to monitoring the mobility dynamics in response to the pandemic, as mobility patterns
largely indicate how people respond to the pandemic and whether policies are implemented
effectively [11-13].
Since the initial outbreak of COVID-19, numerous efforts have been made, by
incorporating the emerging concept of “Web 2.0” [14], “Big Data” [15], and “Citizen as
Sensors” [16], to obtain timely information regarding whether people are actively reducing
their exposure to COVID-19 by reducing distances traveled, and by how much. Companies
like Google and Apple have released their aggregated and anonymized community mobility
reports based on data collected from their mapping services (i.e., Google Maps and Apple
Maps). Those reports are updated on a daily basis and can be easily downloaded. In addition,
authorities started to collaborate with mobile network operators to estimate and visualize the
effectiveness of control measures [11, 17], in light of the previous success of mobile phone
data in assisting the modeling of the spread of other epidemics [18-20]. Shortly after the
outbreak in China, mobility data from Baidu, a famous Chinese online platform, have been put
into use to evaluate the effectiveness of the lockdown measure in Wuhan [5]. Leading

telecommunication firms also contribute by collaborating with local authorities to estimate the
efficiency of travel restrictions as well as to identify the impact of other mobility-reducing
related measures [21, 22]. In the U.S., Descarte Lab (www.descarteslabs.com/mobility) has
released mobility statistics derived from mobile devices, aiming to facilitate the acquisition of
rapid situational awareness at the State- and County-level. City-level studies have also been
conducted. For example, locational data from Cuebiq (https://www.cuebiq.com/), gathered via
over 180 mobile applications, were used to monitor how social distancing guidelines are
implemented on a daily basis in the city of Boston [11]. However, privacy advocates have
voiced concerns on whether sharing customer data is appropriate, even in a time of crisis [23,
24]. The rapid spread of the COVID-19 at the global level highlights the need for a more
harmonized, less privacy-concerning, easily accessible approach to monitoring human
mobility.
The rise of social media platforms such as Twitter (twitter.com), Flickr
(www.flickr.com), and Instagram (www.instagram.com), offers another possible solution to
closely monitoring human mobility changes, thanks to the timely geospatial information from
the enormous sensing network constituted by millions of users. The huge volume of usergenerated content from social media platforms greatly facilitates the real-time or near real-time
monitoring of human mobility, providing timely data of how people respond to the COVID-19
pandemic geographically, especially within different epidemic phases. The advantages of
social media with respect to the aforementioned sources of digital information are that they are
extensive (covering large spatial areas), easily accessible, with less privacy concern, and at
very low cost [25-28]. Extracting useful information from social media is not new, as the
valuable geospatial insights from social media have been explored in a wide range of fields,
including hazard mitigation [29-31], evacuation monitoring [27, 32, 33], urban analytics [3437], and public health [38, 39], to list a few. Despite the existing applications, few attempts
have been made to explore the great potential of the human mobility statistics derived from
social media during serious epidemic events, like the COVID-19 pandemic. Questions like
whether the mobility data from social media can quantitatively reflect the collaborative effort
in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, how sensitive the mobility is during different epidemic
phases, and how it corresponds to the everchanging policies in different geographical regions,
deserve answers.
To answer the above questions, we focus on Twitter, a popular social media platform,
and analyze more than 587 million tweets from all over the world, to see how the worldwide
collaborative efforts in reducing the mobility are reflected from this user-generated information
in three different scales: global scale, country scale, and U.S. state scale. We propose two types
of distance, respectively termed as single-day distance and cross-day distance, to quantify
different aspects of public mobility observed from Twitter. We further normalize these
distances by setting up their corresponding baselines. To quantify the responsiveness in certain
geographic regions within different epidemic phases, we propose a mobility-based responsive
index (MRI) to capture the overall degree of mobility changes in response to the COVID-19
pandemic within a specific time window. Finally, we contextualize the mobility dynamics
derived from Twitter with detailed measures from local authorities to shed light on their

effectiveness. The theoretical, methodological, and contextual knowledge in this study is
expected to inspire future applications of these easily accessible, less privacy-concerning,
highly spatiotemporal data.

2. Datasets and computing environment
More than 587 million geotagged tweets posted by over 10 million twitter users are collected
using the official Twitter Streaming Application Programming Interface (API), comprising a
five-month period from January 1, 2020 to May 31, 2020. These tweets are stored and queried
in a tweet repository managed in an in-door Hadoop cluster with 13 servers using Apache Hive
and Impala. A geotagged tweet is a Twitter post with embedded geolocation in the format of
exact coordinates (latitude and longitude) from the device’s GPS or place names (e.g., state,
county, city). While the locational accuracy of a geotagged tweet varies, depending on the
settings of the account and how a user chooses to share his/her location, we exclude the tweets
that are geotagged with spatial resolution lower than the city level to increase the accuracy and
credibility of the mobility pattern. Following Martin et al. [40], we filter out the non-human
tweets by looking at the tweet source from which application a tweet is posted. The
computation of travel distance requires locational information from at least two positions.
Thus, only users who post tweets on two consecutive days are included in the calculation of
cross-day distance, a measure that quantifies displacement between two consecutive days
(details in Section 3.1). For single-day distance, a measure that highlights the daily travel
pattern, only users who post at least twice a day are included in the calculation (details in
Section 3.1). Note that all distances computed in this study are Great Circle distances.

3. Methods
3.1 Single-day distance and cross-day distance
To quantify daily human mobility from collected Twitter data, we propose two different types
of distance, respectively referred to as single-day distance (𝐷𝑠𝑑 ) and cross-day distance (𝐷𝑐𝑑 ).
The concepts of the two distances are presented in Fig 1. In general, 𝐷𝑠𝑑 represents the users’
daily maximum travel distance of all locations relative to the initial location. Its calculation is
confined within a single day so that users’ daily travel patterns can be revealed. Different from
𝐷𝑠𝑑 , 𝐷𝑐𝑑 measures the mean center shift between two consecutive days.

For a selected Twitter user 𝑖, let 𝑃𝑖,𝑗

i.e., A = {(𝑃𝑖,𝑗

compute the distance of each location pair within collection A. For a given location pair

(𝑃𝑖,𝑗

as 𝐷𝑠𝑑𝑖,𝑗 , is computed by selecting the maximum value of 𝐺𝐶𝐷𝑖,𝑗

where ̅̅̅̅
𝑃𝑖,𝑗 denotes the mean center for user 𝑖 in day 𝑗 and 𝜇 denotes the mean center operator.
𝐷𝑐𝑑 for user 𝑖 in day 𝑗, referred to as 𝐷𝑐𝑑𝑖,𝑗 , is further computed by applying the Great Circle
distance operator:
̅̅̅̅
̅̅̅̅̅̅̅
𝐷𝑐𝑑𝑖,𝑗 = 𝑑 < (𝑃
𝑖,𝑗 , 𝑃𝑖,𝑗+1 ) >

(3)

Intuitively, 𝐷𝑠𝑑 and 𝐷𝑐𝑑 represent different aspects of mobility with 𝐷𝑠𝑑 measuring
maximum single-day travel distance and 𝐷𝑐𝑑 measuring cross-day displacement. The
dynamics of 𝐷𝑠𝑑 and 𝐷𝑐𝑑 are expected to reflect on how the COVID-19 pandemic affects

people’s mobility patterns geographically, presumably indicating the regional degree of
responsiveness.
3.2 Normalized mobility index
Inspired by the methodological design in mobility reports from Google
(www.google.com/covid19/mobility) and Apple (www.apple.com/covid19/mobility), we set
up baselines for 𝐷𝑠𝑑 and 𝐷𝑐𝑑 respectively. Unlike studies that utilize a single baseline value
summarized from a fixed period of time, our mobility baselines are set for each corresponding
day of a week, as a week has been widely recognized as an independent cycle in mobility [25,
41]. That is to say, we calculate a total of fourteen baseline values, seven for 𝐷𝑠𝑑 and seven for
𝐷𝑐𝑑 , corresponding to each day of a week. For a geographical region ℝ (globe, a country, or a
ℝ
ℝ
state), let 𝐷𝑠𝑑
and 𝐷𝑐𝑑
represent the 𝐷𝑠𝑑 and 𝐷𝑐𝑑 of ℝ in day 𝑗, respectively. We define that

are respectively defined as the ratios of 𝐷𝑠𝑑
and 𝐷𝑐𝑑
to their baseline values of a

corresponding day in a week. Given their calculations, 𝑁𝑀𝐼𝑠𝑑
and 𝑁𝑀𝐼𝑐𝑑
both have a range

of [0, +∞), with 1 being the critical value. When the 𝑁𝑀𝐼𝑠𝑑
(or 𝑁𝑀𝐼𝑐𝑑
) is less than 1, it

suggests that within region ℝ in day 𝑗 , reduced mobility is observed compared with the
baseline mobility when measuring single-day distance (or cross-day distance).
3.3 Mobility-based responsive index
After the normalization in the previous section, a baseline of 𝑁𝑀𝐼 (i.e., 𝑁𝑀𝐼 = 1 ) that
separates patterns of increased mobility and reduced mobility is formed. Intuitively, for a time
series of 𝑁𝑀𝐼 values, the size of the area under the NMI baseline (𝑆𝐴𝑈𝐵 ) represents the degree
of positive responses (i.e., reduce in mobility) for a given period of time, while the size of the
area above the NMI baseline ( 𝑆𝐴𝐴𝐵 ) indicates otherwise (Fig 2). Hypothetically, 𝑆𝐴𝑃𝐶
represents a perfect scenario where mobility instantly reduced to 0 from the beginning and
remains 0 until the time series ends. Conceptually, the mobility-based responsive index we
propose is the ratio between the net positive response to the perfect scenario, i.e.,

∑ 𝑆𝐴𝑈𝐵 −∑ 𝑆𝐴𝐴𝐵
𝑆𝐴𝑃𝐶

,

where ∑ 𝑆𝐴𝑈𝐵 and ∑ 𝑆𝐴𝐴𝐵 respectively denote the summation of areas under the curve and the
summation of areas above the curve, given a specific time period.

Fig 2. Mobility-based responsive index
To remove noises, we smooth the time series using a one-dimensional Gaussian filter
(𝜎 = 2) so that the general trend can be revealed. Further calculations regarding the size of the
areas are all based on the smoothed time series. Given the different nature of the two proposed
distances, we calculate their 𝑀𝑅𝐼 separately:
𝑀𝑅𝐼𝑠𝑑 =
𝑀𝑅𝐼𝑐𝑑 =

∑ 𝑆𝐴𝑈𝐵

−∑ 𝑆𝐴𝐴𝐵𝑠𝑑

𝑆𝐴𝑃𝐶
∑ 𝑆𝐴𝑈𝐵

𝑐𝑑

−∑ 𝑆𝐴𝐴𝐵𝑐𝑑

𝑆𝐴𝑃𝐶

(4)
(5)

where 𝑀𝑅𝐼𝑠𝑑 and 𝑀𝑅𝐼𝑐𝑑 denote the 𝑀𝑅𝐼 with 𝐷𝑠𝑑 and 𝐷𝑐𝑑 being measured, respectively. We
further compute an integrated 𝑀𝑅𝐼 by weighting 𝑀𝑅𝐼𝑠𝑑 and 𝑀𝑅𝐼𝑐𝑑 using their total sample
sizes:
𝑀𝑅𝐼 =

𝑀𝑅𝐼𝑠𝑑 ×𝑢𝑠𝑑 + 𝑀𝑅𝐼𝑐𝑑 ×𝑢𝑐𝑑
𝑢𝑠𝑑 + 𝑢𝑐𝑑

(6)

where 𝑢𝑠𝑑 and 𝑢𝑐𝑑 denote the total sample sizes used to calculate 𝑀𝑅𝐼𝑠𝑑 and 𝑀𝑅𝐼𝑐𝑑 ,
respectively. The rationale of deriving an integrated 𝑀𝑅𝐼 by fusing 𝑀𝑅𝐼𝑠𝑑 and 𝑀𝑅𝐼𝑐𝑑 is that,
despite their different calculations, they reflect human mobility from diverse perspectives, and
therefore their integration serves as an overall index that better summarizes the general degree
of mobility-based responsiveness geographically. The derived 𝑀𝑅𝐼 has a range of (−∞, 1]. In
general, the higher the value, the better responsiveness a region has, with𝑀𝑅𝐼 = 1 suggests a
hypothetically perfect responsiveness. A positive 𝑀𝑅𝐼 ( 𝑀𝑅𝐼 > 0 ) suggests positive
responsiveness (reduce in mobility) for a region, while a negative one suggests otherwise.

4. Results
4.1 Global scale
As most countries in the world started to aggressively respond to the COVID-19 pandemic
after March 2020, we set our baselines in a temporal period from January 13 (to exclude
abnormal mobility patterns due to the New Year holiday season) to February 29. Since the
outbreak in China and the dramatic increase in cases in Europe, many countries have imposed
and continue to impose travel bans and lockdowns [42]. As a result, both 𝐷𝑠𝑑 and 𝐷𝑐𝑑 have
greatly deviated from their corresponding baselines, especially after March 11, when WHO
declared COVID-19 as a pandemic (Fig 3a). Because both our baselines are set for the
individual day in a week, their projections exhibit a clear weekly pattern. In comparison, the
time series of 𝐷𝑠𝑑 and 𝐷𝑐𝑑 , especially after the declaration of COVID-19 as a pandemic, show
considerably less periodicity (Fig 3a), suggesting that the protection measures (e.g., travel
restrictions, social distancing policies, stay-at-home orders) have obviously affected people’s
weekly routines. The visual comparison of global cross-day trajectory in February (Fig 3b) and
May (Fig 3c) has also demonstrated the collaborative effort in reducing mobility to fight the
pandemic, evidenced by the remarkably lower density of global trajectory in May. The gap
between baselines proves the different nature of 𝐷𝑠𝑑 and 𝐷𝑐𝑑 , well explaining our rationale of
normalizing 𝐷𝑠𝑑 and 𝐷𝑐𝑑 separately, according to their corresponding baselines. We further
observe that, throughout the entire time series, the daily value of 𝐷𝑐𝑑 is considerably lower
than the daily value of 𝐷𝑠𝑑 . This phenomenon can be explained by the existence of a large
amount of Twitter users who, despite their large single-day travel distance (high 𝐷𝑠𝑑 value),
keep a similar daily posting routine, which leads to the no significant shift of mean centers
between two consecutive days (low 𝐷𝑐𝑑 value).

March, April, and May). (a) 𝑫𝒔𝒅, 𝑫𝒄𝒅 and their baselines from February to May; (b)
cross-day trajectories in February; (c) cross-day trajectories in May

We observe similar mobility dynamics when 𝐷𝑠𝑑 and 𝐷𝑐𝑑 are respectively normalized
to 𝑁𝑀𝐼𝑠𝑑 and 𝑁𝑀𝐼𝑠𝑑 according to their baselines (Fig 4). Both 𝑁𝑀𝐼𝑠𝑑 and 𝑁𝑀𝐼𝑠𝑑 started to
deviate from the baseline (𝑁𝑀𝐼 = 1) around ten days before the pandemic declaration from
the WHO, suggesting that strong mobility-reducing measures had been taken before the
declaration on March 11. This mobility pattern coincides with strong early travel restrictions
implemented in Europe and Asia at the beginning of March [6, 43]. At the end of March, both
𝑁𝑀𝐼𝑠𝑑 and 𝑁𝑀𝐼𝑐𝑑 reached the bottom with the lowest 𝑁𝑀𝐼𝑠𝑑 = 0.70 and the lowest 𝑁𝑀𝐼𝑐𝑑 =
0.45, indicating that single-day distance and cross-day distance respectively reduced to 70%
and 45% of the ones in the normal situation. Starting from the end of April, however, both
𝑁𝑀𝐼𝑠𝑑 and 𝑁𝑀𝐼𝑐𝑑 started to bounce back, and the increasing trend continued to the end of
May, presumably resulting from the gradually lifted quarantine measures [44]. Compared with
the hypothetically perfect scenario (𝑀𝑅𝐼 = 1) where mobility instantly halts and remains 0
throughout the time series, the overall 𝑀𝑅𝐼 for the three-month combined is 0.31, and the
𝑀𝑅𝐼𝑠 for the March, April, and May respectively are 0.24, 0.38, and 0.32, revealing the less
responsiveness in May compared with April.

period, and the monthly 𝐌𝐑𝐈 for March, April, and May.

4.2 Country scale
For country scale study, we set the mobility baseline in a period from January 13 to February
15, as some countries (e.g., Italy and South Korea) already imposed strict or voluntary
mobility-reducing policies as early as in late-February. To ensure that Twitter records are
sufficient enough to generate a reasonable and stable time series, we mainly target the top 20
countries with most Twitter users, according to the Digital 2020 April Global Statshot Report
[45]. The selection of those countries mostly agrees with the Twitter data we collected
In general, the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on mobility derived from Twitter is
obvious, as the mobility of the selected 20 countries, measured by single-day distance and
cross-day distance, is mostly below the mobility baseline in March, April, and May (Fig 5),
suggesting that mobility-reducing measures have been suggested and adopted in those
countries. However, the country-level discrepancies in the time series of 𝑁𝑀𝐼𝑠𝑑 and 𝑁𝑀𝐼𝑐𝑑
can be clearly observed. The mobility in Japan started to drop in late-February (Fig 5),
presumably in response to the announcement by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on February 27 to
close all Japanese elementary, junior high, and high school [46]. The further decline of mobility
from early-April to late-April can be explained by the proclamation of the State of Emergency
for Tokyo (April 7) and for the rest of the country (April 16) [47]. The mobility of Japan is
expected to bounce back, as Japan ended the state of emergency in all of Japan On May 25
[48]. Given the limited temporal coverage of our data, however, its impact on mobility remains
unknown. The mobility of the United States started to drop in mid-March when a series of
statements were announced, including the declaration of COVID-19 as a pandemic by the
WHO (March 11) and the declaration of National Emergency by the White House (March 13).
The mobility remained consistently low in April, then gained an upward momentum in May,
largely due to the gradually loosened measures [49]. A similar mobility pattern can also be
observed in India, where mobility reduced following the WHO’s declaration in mid-March and
gradually rose in May. Mobility in Malaysia was slightly below the baseline in late-February
and early-March. The sudden mobility drop appeared on March 18, which coincides with the
date when the Movement Control Order (MCO) from the federal government took effect [50].
The rapid mobility reduction in Malaysia demonstrates that the MCO was effectively and
efficiently executed. In Saudi Arabia, mobility started to reduce as early as March 2, when the
first case was confirmed [51]. However, 𝑁𝑀𝐼𝑠𝑑 and 𝑁𝑀𝐼𝑐𝑑 gradually diverged as 𝑁𝑀𝐼𝑐𝑑
remained stably low in April and May, while 𝑁𝑀𝐼𝑠𝑑 became unstable and eventually recovered
and even surpassed baseline mobility in mid-May. The divergence in trends of the two types
of distances can be partially explained by the suspension of flights and mass land transport
(trains, buses, and taxis) that took effect on March 21 [52]. The lack of public transit is
responsible for the consistently low cross-day distance.

Fig 5. Temporal distribution of 𝑵𝑴𝑰𝒔𝒅 and 𝑵𝑴𝑰𝒄𝒅 for the top 20 countries with most
Twitter users in February, March, April, and May.
Compared with the hypothetically perfect scenario, i.e., 𝑀𝑅𝐼 = 1, Turkey has the
highest three-month 𝑀𝑅𝐼 (0.50), followed by Malaysia (0.43), Spain (0.43), Japan (0.42), and
the U.K. (0.41) (Table 1). Russia owns the lowest three-month 𝑀𝑅𝐼 (0.15), followed by
Australia (0.21), Canada (0.26), Indonesia (0.27), and the U.S. (0.29) (Table 1). The high 𝑀𝑅𝐼
(0.42) of March in South Korea, a country that suffered from the initial spread of the epidemic
in its early stage besides China, indicates that the early and strong mitigation measures were
announced and implemented effectively. In light of the gradually easing situation [53], the
social distancing measures in South Korea started to be lifted, evidenced by the fact that its
𝑀𝑅𝐼 decreased respectively by 0.10 and 0.12 in April and May. In the U.S., the mobility-based
responsiveness in March (0.19) is among the weakest in the 20 selected countries (Table 1). In
April, the 𝑀𝑅𝐼 of the U.S. reached 0.39, a net gain of 0.20 compared to the 𝑀𝑅𝐼 in March. The
strong responsiveness of mobility in April is largely due to the gradually issued state-level stayat-home orders since late-March that eventually affected at least 316 million people in at least
42 states [54]. With the lifting of orders in late-April and May, however, the U.S. showed
reduced responsiveness, evidenced by its 0.1 loss in 𝑀𝑅𝐼 of May compared to April. As the
U.S. has become the new COVID-19 epicenter, the reduced mobility responsiveness, along
with the rocketing number of confirmed cases, deserves more attention.

Besides the countries presented in Fig 5, the temporal distribution of 𝑁𝑀𝐼𝑠𝑑 and 𝑁𝑀𝐼𝑐𝑑
for the other 16 countries with relatively fewer Twitter samples can be found in the Fig in S1

4.2 States in the CONUS
Given that the first State of Emergency related to COVID-19 in the U.S. was declared by
Washington State (WA) on February 29, while the majority of the states started to react
aggressively after mid-March, we set the U.S. mobility baseline in a period from January 13 to
February 29. In general, the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on mobility is distinct, as
the drop of mobility in most of the states happened in mid-March (Fig 6), potentially triggered
by the events that include the pandemic declaration (March 11) and the National Emergency
declaration (March 13). Although social distancing guidelines that aim to curb the spread have
been suggested in the entire nation, the impacts varied substantially among states (Fig 6).
Heavily hit states, e.g., NY, NJ, IL, CA, MA, and PA, generally experienced sharp mobility
reduction, and their mobility remained stably low since mid-March. States with low numbers

of cases, e.g., DE, MT, ME, WV, SD, and WY, despite the fluctuations in their time series,
exhibited relatively marginal mobility reduction compared with heavily hit states. As the first
state to announce the State of Emergency at the end of February, the mobility in WA remained
close to the baseline in early March. It was not until mid-March that the mobility of WA started
to noticeably decrease, which potentially indicates that the early mitigation policies in WA
were not implemented effectively. The time series of mobility in states that include KS, MN,
MS, AL, WV, SC, and WY, presents a bowl-shaped pattern, suggesting the strong recovery of
mobility with some even bouncing beyond the baseline, due to the gradually loosened
measures. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, eight states, including AR, IA, ND, NE,
SD, UT, OK, and WY, decline to impose state-wide stay-at-home orders by favoring other
restrictions [54]. Without the orders, however, the aforementioned states still present
considerable mobility reduction amid the pandemic, indicating the effectiveness of the federal
guidelines and other mitigation approaches from the local government. Given the insufficient
samples in the calculation of the baseline mobility, the mobility pattern in VT is not presented
in Fig 6. The state names associated with their abbreviations and the user counts for distance
calculation in each state are presented in the Table in S2 Table.

In late-May, the risk of transmission in the U.S. was further complicated by the protests
that demand justice after Mr. George Floyd died following an altercation with police. A
noticeable mobility increase following the incident can be found in MN, where the incident

happened (Fig 7). Carried by the existed mobility recovering momentum in mid-May, MN saw
a significant increasing trend in both 𝑁𝑀𝐼𝑠𝑑 and 𝑁𝑀𝐼𝑐𝑑 at the end of the time series. A distinct
spike can be found on May 29, 2020, when the raw 𝑁𝑀𝐼𝑠𝑑 and raw 𝑁𝑀𝐼𝑐𝑑 all went beyond the
baseline, with the 𝑁𝑀𝐼𝑠𝑑 (representing single-day maximum travel distance) reaching about
2.5 times than usual as a consequence of the increased activity during the protests. The
divergent functionality of the smoothed 𝑁𝑀𝐼 and the raw 𝑁𝑀𝐼 is well illustrated as the former
highlights the general trend while the latter is able to capture the spikes caused by disruptive
events. At the time of writing, the protests have gradually spread across the U.S. and even
overseas. The increase in mobility resulting from the protests deserves close monitoring, as
standing in a crowd for long periods undoubtedly raises the risk of increased transmission and
further worsens the situation.

The monthly 𝑀𝑅𝐼 at the state level further highlights the responsiveness of each state
in the three-month period. As expected, states with early spikes of cases and early strong
mitigation policies tend to have a higher 𝑀𝑅𝐼 in March (Fig 8). RI (0.49) leads the 𝑀𝑅𝐼 in
March, followed by WA (0.48), MA (0.45), NY (0.45), and DC (0.42) (Table 2). The high
responsiveness at the early stage suggests that the mobility-reducing guidelines were
implemented timely and efficiently in those states. In April, the responsiveness in almost all
the states continued to strengthen (Fig 8), given the rising of cases and gradually tightened
measures, except ID and MT where 𝑀𝑅𝐼 remained low and rather consistent compared to
March (Table 2). From March to April, MD, AZ, and FL are the top three states with the most
increase of 𝑀𝑅𝐼, respectively by 0.18, 0.17, and 0.16 (Table 2). The significant boost of
mobility-based responsiveness reflects not only the severity of the situation but also the strong
implementation of the mitigation measures. However, with the lifting of orders, 45 states

(except MT, NH, and WA) have shown reduced responsiveness in May compared to April (Fig
8). In light of the increasing number of cases in the U.S with no sign of slowing down (at the
time of writing), the reduced mobility responsiveness can potentially foster a second wave of
infections. Because of the insufficient samples in the baseline calculation, the 𝑀𝑅𝐼 for VT is
not presented in Fig 8 and Table 2.

5. Discussion
5.1 Merits of social media data in gauging human mobility dynamics
The rise of social media platforms in recent years offers a potential solution to closely
monitoring human mobility dynamics, given their real-time high-volume user-generated

content. Public health crises like the COVID-19 pandemic uniquely highlight several merits of
social media data. First, social media data are a more harmonized source compared to cellphone
records from certain providers that differ geographically. Twitter, for example, has 330 million
monthly active users and 500 million daily posts worldwide [55]. Its popularity allows it to
serve as a valuable venue where derived mobility dynamics can be cross-compared in different
regions, especially for a global epidemic event like the COVID-19. Second, social media data
offer both immediacy and spatially explicit geo-information that traditional approaches like
surveys and censuses are often not capable of. The rapid spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and
the everchanging mitigation policies greatly magnify the merit of timeliness in real-time
crowdsourcing platforms, including social media. Third, social media data are relatively less
privacy-concerning compared to passive data-collecting approaches that include phone calls,
cellular records, and smart cards. The privacy issues in the above passive methods preclude the
analysis in a more spatial explicit manner, as data collected via those methods are usually deidentified and aggregated before application. Finally, social media data are easily accessible
and cost-efficient. Despite the required computational resources and storage that are essential
to handle the large volume and velocity of Twitter data, its data acquisition (via Twitter API)
is totally free of charge. In these respects, geo-located tweets can and should be considered as
a valuable proxy for human mobility, especially during times of crisis (like the COVID-19
pandemic we are facing) that usually cause dramatic mobility changes.
5.2 Limitations
The results of this study should be interpreted in light of several important limitations. First,
the representativeness of Twitter data may not reflect the characteristics of the population as a
whole in terms of socioeconomic status, age, gender, or race. Furthermore, the
representativeness may vary geographically. Despite the attempts to improve the understanding
of the demographics of Twitter users via profile scrutiny and tweets mining [27, 56], the
intrinsic biases in Twitter samples should be considered when the results of this study are
interpreted. The problem of representativeness, however, exists in all digital services. Mobility
patterns derived from phone calls and cell phone applications (e.g., Google Maps and Apple
Maps) also have to face the criticisms that people left behind by the “Digital Divide” [57] are
significantly underrepresented.
Second, the Twitter API allows unrestricted access to only about 1% of the total records
[58]. From the tweets that streamed down via the Twitter API, we only use tweets that are
geotagged with spatial resolution lower than the city level. Despite the “Big Data” nature of
Twitter as a data source, the available records that can be used to derive human mobility
patterns are still insufficient in some regions at a temporal resolution of daily. Mobility time
series computed from insufficient samples tend to have more fluctuations, making the general
pattern less recognizable and less reliable. In this respect, the mobility dynamics identified in
the study only account for the reaction of Twitter in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and
should not be generalized to infer the mobility of the total population without caution.

Third, the less privacy-concerning nature of social media data also creates many
challenges. Unlikely the passively collected data from mobile telephone records, smart cards,
and wireless networks, social media data own intrinsic active nature, as users must grant
permission to share their data and determine the locational accuracy of their posts, all
depending on their personal settings. Thus, the two types of distances proposed in this study,
single-day distance and cross-day distance, only reflect the travel behaviors that users are
willing to share. This active nature protects privacy to some degree, at the same time however,
dilutes the total amount of available trajectory data both spatially and temporally, potentially
causing skewness in the extracted origin-destination information.
Finally, our mobility baseline, where mobility patterns from other periods are compared
against, is derived from a one-month period that starts from mid-January. We further compute
baselines for each corresponding day of a week by recognizing a week as an independent
mobility cycle, however, without considering the monthly discrepancies that mobility patterns
may present. Studies have shown that mobility may vary regularly on a monthly basis [59, 60],
and the variations differ geographically due to the different cultural and societal settings. The
uncertainty, resulting from the short baseline period that specifically covers late-January and
February, needs to be acknowledged.
5.3 Future directions
Despite these limitations, we believe the strengths and valuable findings in this study outweigh
the shortcomings. However, several lines of future studies are still in need. First, future work
should investigate the representativeness of Twitter data by delving into the demographics of
Twitter users. The mobility patterns documented in this study only reflect Twitter users’
collective activities responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, the representativeness of
the findings largely depends on the demographics of the local users in relation to the
demographics of the local population. Another research direction is to examine the similarity
and dissimilarity in mobility patterns derived from various sources (social media, phone calls,
cellular records, smart cards, etc.). Although the choice of data source for studying human
mobility is event dependent, a comparison study focusing on events with dramatic mobility
changes leads to an overall picture and the strengths and pitfalls of each data source. The third
line of research is to explore the potential in the integration of mobility indices from
heterogeneous data sources. An integrated mobility index from multiple sources is expected to
better reflect the multifaceted nature of human mobility, thus greatly facilitating a
comprehensive mobility monitoring. Fourth, research on more extensive Twitter datasets is
needed to investigate the possible improvement in mobility that can be captured. Although the
hundreds of millions spatially explicit Twitter posts collected in this study are sufficient to
quantitatively reflect the human mobility dynamics during the pandemic, an increasing amount
of tweets are expected to generate more stable and reliable trends with fewer random
fluctuations. Despite the fact that the licenses for other sample sizes, such as Gecahose
(returning 10% of the public data) and Firehose (returning 100% of the public data), are costly,
difficult to obtain, and requiring a demanding computational environment [61], their potential

in obtaining reliable mobility dynamics at much finer spatiotemporal resolutions deserves
attention. Finally, as human population movement is among the critical dimension that drives
the spatial spread of COVID-19, how to leverage such twitter derived mobility information
for better predicting future infectious risk of a state, county, or community warrants
investigation.

6. Conclusion
As the whole world is now fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, the effectiveness of mobilityreducing measures (e.g., social/physical distancing) at varying scales needs rapid investigation.
This article examines the reaction in social media, specifically Twitter, spatially and temporally
in response to the COVID-19 pandemic as a more harmonized, less privacy-concerning, and
cost-efficient approach to assessing human mobility dynamics promptly. Through analyzing
around 587 million tweets worldwide, we present how our collaborative efforts in mobility
reduction are reflected from this user-generated information in three different geographic
scales: global scale, country scale, and U.S. state scale. To quantify various aspects of mobility
from Twitter, we propose two types of distance, i.e., the single-day distance that highlights
daily travel behavior and the cross-day distance that highlights the displacement between two
consecutive days. To facilitate the comparison with normal situations, we further normalize
these distances by separately setting up their baselines for each corresponding day of a week.
We also propose a mobility-based responsive index (𝑀𝑅𝐼) to capture the overall degree of
mobility-related responsiveness of particular geographic regions in response to the COVID-19
pandemic.
The results suggest that mobility patterns obtained from Twitter data are amendable to
quantitatively reflect the mobility dynamics in COVID-19 pandemic at various geographic
scales. Globally, the proposed two distances measured from Twitter had greatly deviated from
their baselines after March 11, 2020, when WHO declared COVID-19 as a pandemic. The
considerably less periodicity after the declaration suggests that the protection measures have
obviously affected people’s weekly routines. The global 𝑀𝑅𝐼 reveals less responsiveness in
May compared with April. At the country scale, the country-level discrepancies in
responsiveness are obvious, evidenced by the contrasting mobility patterns in different
epidemic phases. We further find that the triggers of mobility changes correspond well with
the announcements of mitigation measures, which in return proves that Twitter-based mobility,
to some degree, implies the effectiveness of those measures. At the U.S. state scale, the
influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on mobility is distinct, as the drop of mobility in most
of the states happened in mid-March following the National Emergency declaration on March
13. However, the impacts varied substantially among states. Heavily hit states generally
experienced sharp mobility reduction while states with low numbers of cases exhibited
relatively marginal mobility reduction. With orders gradually being lifted since late-April, 45
states (except MT, NH, and WA) have shown reduced responsiveness in May compared to
April. The existing mobility recovering momentum is further fueled by the Black Lives Matter
protests, potentially fostering the second wave of infections in the U.S. The methodological

knowledge and contextual findings in this study seed future applications of the easily accessible,
less privacy-concerning, highly spatiotemporal Twitter data in monitoring multi-scale mobility
dynamics during disaster events.
