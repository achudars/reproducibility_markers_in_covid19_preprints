University of Southern California, Information Sciences Institute

Abstract
Background:
At the time of this writing, the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic outbreak
has already put tremendous strain on many countries' citizens, resources and
economies around the world. Social distancing measures, travel bans, selfquarantines, and business closures are changing the very fabric of societies
worldwide. With people forced out of public spaces, much conversation about these
phenomena now occurs online, e.g., on social media platforms like Twitter.
Objective:
In this paper, we describe a multilingual coronavirus (COVID-19) Twitter dataset
that we are making available to the research community via our COVID-19TweetIDs Github repository.
Methods:
We started this ongoing data collection on January 28, 2020, leveraging Twitter’s
Streaming API and Tweepy to follow certain keywords and accounts that were
trending at the time the collection began, and used Twitter’s Search API to query for
past tweets, resulting in the earliest tweets in our collection dating back to January
21, 2020.
Results:
Since the inception of our collection, we have actively maintained and updated our
Github repository on a weekly basis. We have published over 123 million tweets,
with over 60% of the tweets in English. This manuscript also presents basic analysis
that shows that Twitter activity responds and reacts to coronavirus-related events.
Conclusions:
It is our hope that our contribution will enable the study of online conversation
dynamics in the context of a planetary-scale epidemic outbreak of unprecedented
proportions and implications. This dataset could also help track scientific
coronavirus misinformation and unverified rumors or enable the understanding of
fear and panic – and undoubtedly more.

Introduction
The first cases of a novel coronavirus disease (officially named COVID-19 by the
World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020) were reported in Wuhan,
China in late December 2019; the first fatalities were reported in early 2020. The
fast-rising infections and death toll led the Chinese government to quarantine the
city of Wuhan on January 23, 2020 [1]. During this period, other countries began
reporting their first confirmed cases of the disease, and on January 30, 2020 WHO
announced a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. With more
countries reporting cases of the disease, and infections rapidly escalating in some
regions of the world, including South Korea, Iran and Italy, the WHO has upgraded
COVID-19 to a pandemic [2].
As of the time of this writing, COVID-19 has been reported in 185 countries, leaving
governments all over the world scrambling for ways to contain the disease and
lessen its adverse consequences to their people's health and economy [3].
Preventative measures implemented by national, state and local governments now
affect the daily routines of millions of people worldwide [4]. “Social distancing,” the
most widely used of such measures, aims to curtail new infections by reducing
physical contact between people [5]. Social distancing measures have led to the
cancellation of sporting events and conferences [6], closures of schools and colleges
[7], and has forced many businesses to require their employees to work from home
[8]. As more and more social interactions move online, the conversation around
COVID-19 has continued to expand, with growing numbers turning to social media
for both information and company [9, 10]. Platforms such as Twitter have become
central to the technological and social infrastructure that allows us to stay
connected even during crises.
We describe a Twitter dataset about COVID-19-related online conversations that we
are sharing with the research community. People all over the world take to Twitter
to express opinions and engage in dialogue in a public forum, and, with Twitter’s
open API, has proved to be an invaluable resource in studying a wide range of
topics. Twitter has long been used by the research community as a means to
understand dynamics observable in online social networks: from information
dissemination [11, 12], to the prevalence and influence of bots and misinformation
[13,14]. More importantly during the current coronavirus pandemic, Twitter
provides researchers the ability to study the role social media plays in the global
health crisis [15-19]. We hope that this data will spur new research about the social
dimensions of the pandemic.
We began collecting data in real-time from Twitter, with the earliest tweets from
January 21, 2020, tracking COVID-19 related keywords and accounts. Here we
describe the data collection methods, document initial data statistics, and provide
information about how to obtain and use the data.

Methods
We began actively collecting tweets from January 28, 2020, leveraging Twitter's
streaming API [20] and Tweepy [21] to follow specific keywords and accounts that
were trending at the time. When we started collecting tweets, we also used Twitter's
search API [22] on the same keywords to gather related historical tweets. Thus, the
earliest tweets in our collection date back to January 21, 2020. Since then, we have
incrementally added keywords and accounts to follow based on the conversations
occurring on Twitter at any time. We have collected over 72 million tweets from the
inception until March 21, 2020, constituting roughly 600 GB of raw data, and are
still collecting data to this day.
Our collection relies upon publicly available data and is hence registered as IRB
exempt by USC IRB (approved protocol UP-17-00610). We release the dataset with
the stipulation that those who use it must comply with Twitter’s Terms and
Conditions [23].
Tracked Keywords and Accounts
By continuously monitoring Twitter's trending topics, keywords and sources
associated with COVID-19, we did our best to capture conversations related to the
coronavirus outbreak.
Twitter's streaming API returns any tweet containing the keyword(s) in the text of
the tweet, as well as in its metadata; therefore, it is not always necessary to have
each permutation of a specific keyword in the tracking list. For example, the
keyword “Covid” will return tweets that contain both “Covid19” and “Covid-19”. We
list a subset of the keywords and accounts that we are following in Table 1 and
Table 2 respectively, along with the date we began tracking them. There are some
keywords that overlap due an included keyword being a sub-string of another, but
we included both for good measure. The keyword choices in the current dataset are
all in English, so there is a heavy bias towards English tweets and events related to
English speaking countries. Due to the evolving nature of the pandemic and online
conversations, these tables will expand as we continue to monitor Twitter for
additional keywords and accounts to add to our tracking list.

Results
Releases
Our data collection will continue uninterruptedly for the foreseeable future. As the
pandemic continues to run its course, we anticipate that the amount of data will
grow significantly. The dataset is available on Github [24] and is released in
compliance with the Twitter's Terms and Conditions, under which we are unable to
publicly release the text of the collected tweets. We are, therefore, releasing the
Tweet IDs, which are unique identifiers tied to specific tweets. The Tweet IDs can be
used by researchers to query Twitter’s API and obtain the complete Tweet object,
including tweet content (text, URLs, hashtags, etc.) and authors’ metadata. This
process to retrieve the full Tweet object from Twitter starting from a Tweet ID is
referred to as hydration. There are several easy to use tools that have been
developed for such purposes, including the Hydrator [25] and Twarc [26], but one
could also directly use Twitter’s API to retrieve the desired data. This dataset can
also be found on Harvard Dataverse [27]. Please see a list of basic statistics,
including collection period and number of Tweets in that respective release, for all
current (as of May 15, 2020) releases in Table 4.
There are a few known gaps in the data, which are listed in Table 5. Due to Twitter
API restrictions on free data access, we were unable to recover the data from the
listed times, as Twitter only provides free access to Tweets returned from their
streaming API from the past week. To request access, interested researchers will
need to agree upon the terms of usage dictated by the chosen license.
All of the Tweet ID files are stored in folders that indicate the year and month the
Tweet was posted (YEAR-MONTH). The individual Tweet ID files each contain a
collection of Tweet IDs, with the file names all beginning with the prefix
“coronavirus-tweet-id-” followed by the year, month, date and hour the Tweet was
posted (YEAR-MONTH-DATE-HOUR).
We note that if a Tweet has been removed from the platform, unfortunately
researchers will not be able to obtain the original Tweet.
Most Recent Release (Release v1.8 – May 11, 2020)
Our 9th release spans January 21, 2020 through May 8, 2020. The total dataset
available now contains tweets from 22:00 UTC January 21, 2020 through 21:00 UTC
May 8, 2020, with 123,113,914 tweets. The language breakdown of the tweets can be
found in Table 4. A subset of the keywords and accounts that were followed during
this time-frame can be identified by referencing Tables 1 and 2. For a full and up-todate list of the keywords we are tracking, please see the “keywords.txt” file in the
Github repository (a list of the accounts we are tracking can be found in the
“accounts.txt” file). Some of the keywords may appear earlier than the initial listed
track date in Table 1, as we systematically ran the same keywords through Twitter's
search API to collect past instances of the keywords shortly after adding the
keywords to be tracked in real-time.

General Release Notes
In order to use any Twitter facing libraries, including hydration software, users
must first apply for a Twitter developer account and obtain the necessary
authentication tokens [28].
The Github community has also generously contributed scripts to enable
researchers to hydrate the Tweet IDs using Twarc [26].

Discussion
We show initial analysis on our collected dataset that verifies that Twitter discourse
statistics reflect major events at the time, and leverage Business Insider [29], NBC
[30] and CNN [31] released timelines to identify these events of interest during the
development of the coronavirus pandemic. In some of these analyses, there is a dip
on 3/2/2020 – this was due to internet connectivity failures throughout that
specific day. Our discussion is based on analysis done on tweets from release v1.2
(January 21,2020 – March 31, 2020), while the most recent release is v1.8.
Limitations
We first address several limitations of our dataset. We collect our dataset leveraging
Twitter’s free stream API which only returns 1% of the total Twitter volume, and
the volume of Tweets we collected continues to be dependent on our filter endpoint
and network connection [32].
While our dataset is a multi-lingual dataset, containing Tweets from over 67
languages, the keywords and accounts we have and continue to be tracking have
been mostly English keywords and accounts. Thus, there is a significant bias in favor
of English Tweets in our dataset over Tweets of other languages.
Despite these limitations, our data collection gathers over 1 million Tweets a day
from the 1% of Tweets available to us through Twitter’s API, and our dataset
contains on average 35% non-English Tweets. Our collection begins in late January,
capturing Tweets during many major developments – and we plan on continuing
collecting Tweets for the foreseeable future.
Hashtags
We track the frequency of coronavirus-related hashtags, specifically those that
contain the substrings “wuhan”, “coronavirus” and “covid” throughout our collection
period in Figure 1. We can see that while hashtags with the substring coronavirus
consistently remains a significantly more heavily used hashtag in our dataset, the
hashtag usage spikes when the WHO declared COVID-19 a global public health

emergency and on the day that the United States announced the first coronavirus
related death [2]. We also do not see hashtags referencing “covid” being used until
2/11/2020, when WHO announced “COVID-19” as the official name for the novel
coronavirus. The keyword “wuhan” in hashtags sees steady usage until late
February and steadily declines, which reflects the decline in cases in China and the
global spread of the virus.

Figure 1: Hashtags containing the substrings “wuhan”, “covid” and “coronavirus” usage over time.

Languages
We then examine the percentage of total tweets posted in different languages.
Although English is the most prominent language in our dataset, we exclude English
from this analysis as to better visualize the activity in Tweets from countries that
experienced coronavirus outbreaks earlier in the timeline. In particular, we see that
Japanese tweet activity increases steadily after the Diamond Princess is quarantined
off the coast of Yokohama, Japan, with a peak around the time when passengers
began to disembark the Diamond Princess [33].
There is also a significant spike in Italian tweets when the first case related to
COVID-19 is reported in Lodi, Italy, and first death in Veneto [34]. We can also
observe a peak in the percentage of Spanish tweets after the first COVID-19 case in
Spain is announced on 2/01/2020 [35] and a steady increase in percentage of
Spanish tweets after reports of the first COVID-19 related death began to emerge
(the death itself occurred on 2/13 but the cause was diagnosed post-mortem) [36].

Figure 2: Tweets in Spanish, Italian and Japanese over time. Our multi-lingual database begins after 1/28/2020.

Verified Users
Verified users on Twitter have been identified by Twitter as accounts of public
interest and are verified to be authentic accounts [37]. We observe that the verified
accounts, which include news sources and political figures, are the most active when
major events occur, as can be seen in Figure 3. This is as expected, as influential
figures and news sources often weigh in and report on breaking news in real-time,
using Twitter as a platform to amplify their messaging. As the United States also
drives much of the discourse on Twitter, it is therefore unsurprising that there is a
major spike in activity from verified users when the US began to see the first COVID19-related deaths occur.
