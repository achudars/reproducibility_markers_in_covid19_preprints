Abstract
In this paper, we propose a Susceptible-Infected-Removal (SIR) model with time
fused coefficients. In particular, our proposed model discovers the underlying time homogeneity pattern for the SIR model’s transmission rate and removal rate via Bayesian
shrinkage priors. MCMC sampling for the proposed method is facilitated by the nimble package in R. Extensive simulation studies are carried out to examine the empirical
performance of the proposed methods. We further apply the proposed methodology to
analyze different levels of COVID-19 data in the United States.

Introduction

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first identified
in December 2019, and then rapidly spread across the world, causing the current global
pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). As of July 23, the novel coronavirus
has spread to 216 countries and territories, with a total of more than 14 million confirmed

1

infections and 600,000 fatal cases worldwide (World Health Organization, 2020). Eight
months after the initial outbreak, large numbers of new cases are still reported from many
major countries, resulting in not only public health crises, but also severe economic and
political ramifications. As the pandemic rages on with no end in sight, it is of urgent
necessity for epidemiologists to quantify and interpret the trajectories of the COVID-19
pandemic, so as to help formulate more effective public policies.
The Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR; Kermack and McKendrick, 1927) model and
its variants, such as Susceptible-Infected-Removed-Susceptible (SIRS; Kermack and McKendrick, 1932, 1933) and Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removal (SEIR; Hethcote, 2000) models are commonly used to describe the dynamics of an infectious disease in a certain region.
In the basic SIR model, a population is segregated into three time-dependent compartments
including Susceptible (S(t)), Infectious (I(t)), and Recovered/removed (R(t)). One who
does not have the disease at time t, but may be infected due to contact with an infected
person belongs to the susceptible compartment. The infected compartment is made up of
those who have a disease at time t, and can potentially get a susceptible individual infected
by contact. The recovered compartment include those who are either recovered or dead from
the disease, and are no longer contagious, i.e., removed from the infectious compartment,
at time t. Removal can be due to several possible reasons, including death, recovery with
immunity against reinfection, and quarantine and isolation from the rest of the population.
A recovered/removed individual will not be back into the susceptible compartment anymore.
Such model assumption match well with the COVID-19 outbreak, and therefore we adopt
the SIR model as our basic model in this paper.
From the statistical perspective, the key study objective is the inference of transmission
and recovery rates from the model. Regarding time-invariant SIR and SEIR models, there
have been timely applications to early epidemic data right after the breakout of COVID-19
(Read et al., 2020; Tang et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020). In order to differentiate evolutional
patterns of COVID-19 among different regions, Hu and Geng Hu and Geng (2020) developed

2

a Bayesian heterogeneity learning methodology for SIRS. As the epidemic continued to spread
rampantly, statisticians proposed time-dependent models based on SIR to elucidate the
temporal dynamics of this disease (Chen et al., 2020; Jo et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2020).
Estimated by various assumptions on temporal smoothness, the transmission and recovery
rates of these models constantly alter over time, which limits their ability to effectively
detect abrupt changes. In contrast, we consider the scenario in which the transmission and
recovery rates are constant within locally stationary periods segmented by a collection of
change points, which is aligned with the fact that different stages of epidemic progression
are naturally partitioned. This motivates us to estimate a piecewise constant model.
The fused lasso Tibshirani et al. (2005), with L1 sparsity-inducing penalty imposed on
all successive differences, is one of the most popular methods for time fusion and change
point detection. Motivated by the frequentist L1 fusion penalty, Kyung et al. Kyung et al.
(2010) proposed its Bayesian counterpart, namely Bayesian fused lasso, which imposed independent Laplace priors (Park and Casella, 2008) on the differences. To solve the posterior
inconsistency problem of Bayesian fused lasso, Song and Cheng Song and Cheng (2019) used
heavier tailed student-t priors for Bayesian fusion estimation. In addition to the Laplace and
student-t priors, other Bayesian shrinkage priors with different statistical properties, such as
spike-and-slab (George and McCulloch, 1993) and horseshoe priors (Carvalho et al., 2010),
can also be adopted to induce time fusion.
The contributions of this paper are in three-fold. First, we apply three different types of
shrinkage priors to capture the time homogeneity patterns of infectious and removal rates
under the SIR framework. Second, it is noticed that our proposed method can be easily
implemented by the nimble package de Valpine et al. (2017) in R. A straightforward tutorial
on using nimble to obtain shrinkage priors under the SIR framework is provided in the
supplemental material. Finally, several interesting findings are discovered through analysis
of COVID-19 data, including including national level, state level, and county level.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the COVID-19 data of

3

selected state and county are introduced. We briefly review the SIR model, and then present
our model framework in Section 3. Simulation studies are conducted in Section 4. Applications of the proposed methods to COVID-19 data are presented in Section 5. Section 6
concludes the paper with a discussion.

Motivating Data

The COVID-19 data is obtained from the R package COVID19 (Guidotti and Ardia, 2020).
We consider the observations recorded from 2020-05-14 to 2020-07-23, a 71-day long period.
US nationwide aggregated data, as well as data for five states: New York (NY), California
(CA), Florida (FL), South Dakota (SD), and Wyoming (WY) are our focus in this study.
We also consider the county-level data including: Los Angeles, Miami-Dade and New York
City. The data is reported daily, with variables including the population size, the number
of confirmed cases, the number of recoveries, and the number of deaths, etc.
Note that the removal group for county-level data only contain deaths and there is no
information available for recoveries. Similar to in Sun et al. Sun et al. (2020), a threepoint moving average filter is applied to the infectious group I(t) and removal group R(t) to
reduce noise. Due to the large size of the susceptible group, the group sizes are visualized on
a natural log scale in Figure 1 and Figure 2. The infectious and removal numbers are much
smaller in SD and WY when compared to other states. As during the studied period, NY is
still under lock-down, both the infectious and removal groups experienced slow increases. For
CA and FL, however, potentially due to re-open in early May, their infectious and removal
groups saw rapid increases. The three counties selected are the metropolitan areas in CA,
FL and NY, and the trends observed are similar to those in their respective states.

3.1

The SIR and vSIR Models

In the SIR model, we consider a fixed total population of size N . By “fixed”, we assume
that the population size does not vary over time. The effect of natural death or birth are
not considered here, as the outstanding period of an infectious disease is much shorter than
human average lifetime. Denote, at time t (t ≥ 1), the counts of susceptible, infectious, and
recovered/removed persons within a given region as S(t), I(t) and R(t), respectively, and
the relationship N = S(t) + I(t) + R(t) always holds.
Two parameters in the SIR model are time-invariant: the transmission rate β, and the
recovering rate γ. The transmission rate β controls how much the disease can be transmitted
through exposure. It is jointly determined by the chance of contact and the probability of
disease transmission. The recovering rate γ stands for the rate at which infected individuals
recover or die. Time-varying property of these two parameters is ignored in traditional SIR
modeling, which is a rather strong simplifying assumption that hurdles the model’s prediction
power for disease trend. Therefore, we adopt the time-varying SIR (vSIR; Sun et al., 2020)
framework, where both β and γ are functions of time t.
The vSIR model can be viewed as both a deterministic model and a stochastic model. The
deterministic vSIR model allows us to describe the number of people in each compartment
with the ordinary differential equations (ODEs). A generalized version of the deterministic
vSIR model with infectious rate β(t) and removal rate γ(t) respect to time can be described
as follows:
−β(t)I(t)S(t)
dS(t)
=
,

β(t)I(t)S(t)
=
− γ(t)I(t),

N
dR(t)
= γ(t)I(t).

While the deterministic vSIR model seems appealing due to its simplicity, the spread of
a disease, however, is naturally stochastic. Disease transmission between two individuals
is random rather than deterministic. The stochastic formulation of the vSIR model is,
therefore, preferred for epidemic modeling purposes, as it allows for randomness in the disease
spreading process.

3.2

Time Fusion SIR Model

Consider the the vSIR-Poisson process framework of Sun et al. (2020) with two time-varying
parameters, β(t) and γ(t). Let N = S(t) + I(t) + R(t) be the total population, M (t) =
I(t) + R(t) denote the cumulative number of diagnosed cases and ∆M (t) = M (t) − M (t − 1),
∆R(t) = R(t) − R(t − 1) represent the daily changes of M (t) and R(t). The initial values
∆M (1) and ∆R(1) are defaulted, respectively, to M (1) and R(1). Let t = 1, . . . , T denote
the time domain. Hence we have

∆M (t) ∼ Poisson

β(t)S(t)I(t)
N


,

∆R(t) ∼ Poisson (γ(t)I(t)) , t = 1, . . . , T.

(2)

For most infectious diseases, the infectious and removal rates β(t) and γ(t) do not always
change smoothly over time, as they can be influenced by certain government policies in a
notable manner. In other words, β(t) and γ(t) can fluctuate around a fixed value within a
specific time period, and then with the inception of a policy, fluctuate around another value in
a period that follows. Identifying the subpopulation structure of these two parameters with
time fusion patterns in the SIR model will enhance our understanding of infectious diseases
such as COVID-19. In this paper, we assume that successive differences of the infectious
rate ∆β(t) = β(t) − β(t − 1) and removal rate ∆γ(t) = γ(t) − γ(t − 1) both have an unknown
clustered pattern with respect to time. Both ∆β(1) and ∆γ(1) are defaulted to 0. For
example, with a cluster of 0’s in the successive differences, β(t) would remain constant over
7

the corresponding time period. Towards this end, we use three different shrinkage priors
on both ∆β(t) and ∆γ(t) to detect such clusters, including the student-t prior, horseshoe
prior and spike-and-slab prior (see, Piironen et al., 2017; Song and Cheng, 2019, for more
discussion). As our proposed model focuses on time fusion, we name it hierarchical time
fusion SIR (tf-SIR).
The first prior we consider is student-t prior. Despite the popularity of the Laplace prior,
it has a light tail, suffers from posterior inconsistency issues (Song and Liang, 2017; Song
and Cheng, 2019), and often leads to smoothly varying estimation results, i.e., it cannot
identify the clustered structure. The student-t prior, with its heavier tail, induces stronger
shrinkage effect, and enjoys a nice posterior consistency property. The student-t shrinkage
prior on the successive differences can be written as:

∆β(t) | σβ2 ∼ tdfβ (lβ σβ ), σβ2 ∼ IG(aσβ , bσβ ), β(1) | σβ2 ∼ N(0, σβ2 λ1 ),
∆γ(t) | σγ2 ∼ tdfγ (lγ σγ ), σγ2 ∼ IG(aσγ , bσγ ), γ(1) | σγ2 ∼ N(0, σγ2 η1 ), t = 2, . . . , T,

where T denotes the termination time of observation, tω1 (ω2 ) denotes the student-t distribution with degree of freedom ω1 and scale parameter ω2 , N() stands for the normal distribution,
and IG() stands for the inverse gamma distribution. Note that the above student-t distribution can be rewritten as an inverse gamma scaled Gaussian mixture, and hence the tf-SIR
model with student-t prior can be alternatively formulated as:

∆M (t) ∼ Poisson

β(t)S(t)I(t)
N


,

∆R(t) ∼ Poisson (γ(t)I(t)) ,
∆β(t) | σβ2 , λt ∼ N(0, λt σβ2 ),

λt ∼ IG (at , bt ) ,

Similarly, ct , dt satisfy conditions

The second prior is the horseshoe prior (Carvalho et al., 2009, 2010), which is a continuous
shrinkage prior, and is one of the so called global-local shrinkage prior. It has exhibited ideal
theoretical characteristics, and demonstrated good empirical performance (Datta et al., 2013;
Van Der Pas et al., 2014). Our tf-SIR model with the horseshoe prior can be expressed as:

∆M (t) ∼ Poisson

β(t)S(t)I(t)
N



∆R(t) ∼ Poisson (γ(t)I(t))
β(t) − β(t − 1) | σβ2 , λt ∼ N(0, λ2t σβ2 ),

λt ∼ C+ (0, 1)

γ(t) − γ(t − 1) | σγ2 , ηt ∼ N(0, ηt2 σγ2 ), ηt ∼ C+ (0, 1)


σβ2 ∼ IG aσβ , bσβ , σγ2 ∼ IG aσγ , bσγ , t = 2, . . . , T,

(4)

where σβ2 and σγ2 are both fixed, global parameters shrink all ∆βt and ∆γt towards 0, and λt
and ηt are both local parameters following the half-Cauchy distribution C+ (0, 1) that allows,
respectively, some ∆β(t) and ∆γ(t) to escape from the shrinkage. Note that different levels
of sparsity can be achieved by varying the values of σβ2 and σγ2 , with smaller values inducing
stronger shrinkage towards 0.
Finally, our third prior of choice is the spike-and-slab prior (Mitchell and Beauchamp,
1988; George and McCulloch, 1993). It is a two component discrete mixture prior. In this
paper, we write it as a two-component mixture of Gaussian distributions, and the model is

expressed as:

∆M (t) ∼ Poisson

∆R(t) ∼ Poisson (γ(t)I(t)) ,

γ(t) − γ(t − 1) | σγ2 , ηt ∼ ηt N(0, σγ2 ) + (1 − ηt )N(0, 2 ),


σβ2 ∼ IG aσβ , bσβ , σγ2 ∼ IG aσγ , bσγ , t = 2, . . . , T,

λt ∼ Ber (p) ,
ηt ∼ Ber (π) ,
(5)

where   σβ2 and   σγ2 , λt and ηt are indicators that take values in {0, 1}, and Ber()
denotes the Bernoulli distribution. In this paper, we fix the inclusion probabilities p and π.
For both σβ2 and σγ2 , we assume inverse gamma priors to impart heavy tails, and keep the
probability distribution further from 0 than the Gamma distribution. In some cases,  is set
to 0 so that the spike is taken to a point mass at the origin δ0 . This distribution can be
sensitive to prior choices of the slab width or prior inclusion probability, and therefore we
choose the normal distribution with a small variance centered at 0 as the spike.

Simulation Designs

We use the R package SimInf (Widgren et al., 2019) to generate data. Four designs over
a time span of 80 days are considered. The time domain is divided into four equally sized
pieces each spanning for 20 days, where both the infectious rate β(t) and the removal rate γ(t)
are piecewise constant within each of them. The four designs have different β(t), γ(t), and
population size N , and the numerical values are listed in Table 1. Four example datasets, one
for each design, are visualized in Figure 3. Design 1 corresponds to a fairly high infectious
disease with high removal/recovery rate and design 2 corresponds to a mildly infectious

a disease with smaller numerical values for β(t) can infect a large portion of the population,
such as demonstrated for Design 3. Design 4, with small β(t) and γ(t), exhibits slow overall
development. A total of 100 replicates are performed for each design. In each replicate, the
length of the MCMC chain is set to 50,000 with thinning interval 10, leaving us with 5,000
samples, the first 3,000 of which are discarded as burn-in.

Performance Measures

The parameter estimates for β(t) and γ(t) for the 100 replicates are visualized respectively
in Figures 4 and 5 as grey lines, and the true underlying values are also plotted in (blue)
dashed lines. The true underlying values are also plotted in (blue) dashed lines in Figures 4
and 5. The first observation is that, under all four designs, all three models yield quite
accurate parameter estimation performance, as the grey band formed by 100 parameters lie
close to or around the (blue) dashed line in both plots. Secondly, as the population size in
Design 3 and Design 4 is 10 times that in Design 1 and 2, their corresponding grey bands are,
overall, tighter. Thirdly, in both figures, the grey bands corresponding to the t-shrinkage
prior is narrower than those for horseshoe and spike-and-slab, indicating overall relatively
stable estimation performance.
The estimation performance, in addition to visually, is also measured numerically. For β(t),

as the disease continues to develop. For relatively larger values of the true parameter, the
MAB and MSE are larger than for small values of true parameters. As can be observed from
the third column in both Figures 6 and 7, the horseshoe and spike-and-slab priors perform
similarly in terms of MAB, MSE and SD. When the sample size is 106 , the t-shrinkage prior
yields parameter estimates that are overall more stable and have smaller SD than the other
two, which is consistent with the third observation for the grey bands. This difference,
however, decreases with increase in sample size.

FL witnesses a pump peak after mid June, which results from the aggressive reopen in
FL. The clustered pattern in other states, however, is not as clear as that in NY, which is
partially due to the fact that testing and reporting are conducted timely in NY as it is one
of the initial hotspots in March and April that experienced high growth of COVID-19 cases,
while in the other states that we considered, there is more delay in testing and reporting.
As the number of cumulative cases and daily new cases are large in CA, FL and NY, the

respectively, 100 and 50, the estimated HPD band is much wider. As for the removal rate,
NY, FL and CA have similar result. Despite the differences in numerical values, the trends
of γ
b(t) for NY and FL are similar, and display a weekly seasonality, with the estimated
removal rates being smaller than average on weekends. This is due to the fact that reporting
is less active during weekends than during the week. Note that for SD, the estimated removal
rate clearly shows a relatively stable pattern between June 20th and July 1st, indicating the
existence of a potential cluster.

The nation-wide removal rate estimate is constant across

to the release of 633 death cases, which was due to data anomaly.

Conclusion

In this paper, we proposed the tf-SIR model to capture group structure for infectious rate
and removal rate of different time period by using Bayesian shrinkage priors. To our best
knowledge, this is the first attempt in literature to use Bayesian shrinkage to recover unknown

grouping structure for SIR model. Our simulation results indicate that the proposed method
has reasonable performance and ability to capture the group pattern of infectious rate and
removal rate. The analysis of COVID-19 data also brings in new understanding of the
infectious disease such as COVID-19. Also, our tf-SIR model can not only be used to model
and assess COVID-19 pandemic but also other epidemic.
One interesting consideration, as suggested by one anonymous reviewer, is to use a supermartingale structure, i.e., non-increasing function with respective to time, to model the
infectious rate β(t) because of the implementation of policy intervention. While such assumption might not be met by the development of COVID-19 in the United States, it is
a quite reasonable assumption when studying the course of development for COVID-19 in
countries where quarantine and stay-at-home policies are strictly enforced such as China,
Singapore, and Vietnam.
In addition, three topics beyond the scope of this paper are worth further investigation.
First, in our real data application, a moving average approach is applied to deal with measurement errors for observed data. Proposing a measurement error model with SIR is an
interesting future work. Furthermore, different states may have similar infection and removal
pattern. Subgroup detection for different states will help the government design its polices.
Finally, discovering theoretical guarantees such as posterior concentration rates of proposed
methods is also devoted to future research.
