Mohammad Arif Ul Alam

Abstract‚Äî Cognitive fatigue has been a common problem
among workers which has become an increasing global problem
since the emergence of COVID-19 as a global pandemic.
While existing multi-modal wearable sensors-aided automatic
cognitive fatigue monitoring tools have focused on physical
and physiological sensors (ECG, PPG, Actigraphy) analytic
on specific group of people (say gamers, athletes, construction
workers), activity-awareness is utmost importance due to its
different responses on physiology in different person. In this
paper, we propose a novel framework, Activity-Aware Recurrent Neural Network (AcRoNN), that can generalize individual
activity recognition and improve cognitive fatigue estimation
significantly. We evaluate and compare our proposed method
with state-of-art methods using one real-time collected dataset
from 5 individuals and another publicly available dataset from
27 individuals achieving max. 19% improvement.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Cognitive fatigue is a syndrome conceptualized as resulting from chronic workplace stress that has not been
successfully managed [1]. Although, cognitive fatigue is not
a clinical condition which can occur in any workplace or
home environment where there is stress, it is recognized
by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a syndrome
[1]. In short term, cognitive fatigue may cause sleeping
disturbances, anxiety, irritability and hormonal disturbances
and in long run, this may result more severe impacts on
health safety such as cardiovascular, gastrointestinal and
neuropsychological disorders [2].
Current frameworks for cognitive fatigue estimation are
mostly self-reported questionnaire based [29], [30], which is
impossible to generate continuous fatigue report by avoiding
recall bias [29]. Recent advancement of wearable physical
and physiological sensor technologies enable accurate estimation of cognitive fatigue related partial outcomes such as
stress, anxiety, sleep quality, mobility etc, which provides
ultimate opportunity to researchers to estimate cognitive
fatigue continuously [16], [18]‚Äì[20], [22]‚Äì[24] that includes
actigraphy [25], [26], heart rate (HR) [17], [25], Electrocardiography (ECG) [21], Electroencephalography (EEG)
[27] and Electromyography (EMG) [28] sensors along with
traditional and deep machine learning techniques. Combining
accelerometer with ECG has been a successful attempt
as well before [3] which proposed to use deep learning
frameworks (LSTM with Consistency Self-Attention, LSTMCSA) but suffers with the lack of adaptability across diverse
population.
Due to the dissimilarities among different individual
group‚Äôs responses on cognitive fatigue in terms of physiDepartment of Computer Science, University of Massachusetts Lowell

cal and physiological contexts, current wearable cognitive
fatigue estimation research is constrained in group specific
cognitive fatigue estimation [cite]. For example, fatigue
detection of video game players [31], athletes [31], basketball players or heavy exercise performers [32]. As per
many clinical psychologists and mental health researchers,
cognitive fatigue estimation should be more personalized,
rather than generalized on specific group of people to keep
mental healthcare systems sustainable for future generations
[33].
While, the emergence needs of building personalized
cognitive fatigue estimation tool, we have the following
key question: can we develop personalized cognitive fatigue
assessment tool considering activity as their activity as domain invariant feature and fatigue as personalized response
on each activity? As we know, autonomic nervous system
(ANS) restrains the body‚Äôs major physiological activities
including the heart rate (HR) and gland secretion or electrodermal activity (EDA) [34]. However, these responses
are contaminated with physical activity artifacts significantly
[35]. The central hypothesis of the this paper is: each
performed activity context generates similar artifacts on
same activity over diverse population, thus, we can align
similar activities (activity-awareness) as person invariant
feature and its physiological responses as personalized fatigue feature. For example, in Fig. 1, we illustrate the EDA
responses on two different activities: (i) steady hand (ii)
waving hand over two different physiological states: (i) stress
and (ii) no stress. The Fig. 1 clearly shows that same activity
(waving hands) has similar EDA response patterns (but
different amplitude) due to similar artifacts which signifies
our hypothesis.
In this paper, we develop a novel Activity-Aware Recurrent
Neural Network (AcRoNN) model and utilize it to design
a personalized cognitive fatigue assessment framework, that
provides the following key contributions
‚Ä¢

‚Ä¢

We develop a novel Activity-Aware Recurrent Neural
Network (AcRoNN) framework that is able to exploit
contextual cues present in any event from actigraphy
sensor and then assess cognitive fatigue from physiological (EDA and HR) sensor signal using a deep recurrent
neural network.
Apply AcRoNN on two publicly available data and evaluate the capability of AcRoNN framework to improve
cognitive fatigue assessment.

II. ACTIVITY-AWARE R ECURRENT N EURAL N ETWORK
(AcRoNN)
Fig. 3 shows the overall schematic diagram of our contextaware cognitive fatigue assessment framework. In this framework, recognized activity information is intertwined with the
cognitive fatigue assessment architecture. In this regard, we
take (stage 1) cognitive fatigue assessment scoring in terms
of gestural activity, and then postural activity information,
and finally we (stage 2) re-evaluate the cognitive fatigue
assessment scoring based on activity relationships it has
learned from stage 1.
A. Stage One: Cognitive Fatigue Detection and Contextual
Feature Map Generation
This stage involves feature extraction, activity recognition
and activity-based score mapping for cognitive fatigue detection.
1) Wearable Sensor Signal Processing: Wearable sensors
can be two types: physical and physiological. Physical sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope etc.) signal values change
over the movements of the sensor devices. Physiological
sensors change over physiological condition of body such
as EDA changes over stress and PPG changes over heart
rate. However, physical movements also impose noises on
physiological sensor signals which is called motion artifacts.
Physiological Signal Processing: A continuous and descrete decomposition of EDA, and time and frequency
domain analytics of EDA signal have been investigated

before to extract relevant physiological features which were
contaminated with noises and motion artifacts [38]. [39]
denoised and classified EDA from cognitive load and stress
with accuracy higher than 80%. Though motion artifacts
removal techniques such as exponential smoothing and lowpass filters provide significant improvement in filtering EDA
signals, wavelet transforms offer more sophisticated refinement for any kind of physiological sensors such as electroencephalogram, electrocardiogram [37], and PPG [40]. [41]
proposed a stationary wavelet transform (SWT) based motion
artifacts removal technique. ‚ÄòcvxEDA‚Äô proposed a convex optimization technique considering EDA as a mixture of white
gaussian noise, tonic and phasic components where white
gaussian noise includes motion artifacts and external noises
[37]. We combine SWT and ‚ÄòcvxEDA‚Äô together to remove
noises and motion artifacts from EDA signal. Researchers
proposed different methods such as frequency analytics [42],
statistical analytics [43] and digital filter [44] to reduce
noises and motion artifacts from PPG. We used Periodic
Moving Average Filter (PMAF) in this regard [45]. After the
noise reduction, we generated 33 heart rate variability (HRV)
features from PPG (as per [3]) and 12 statistical features from
EDA (as per [34]) signals with a 10-seconds window.
Accelerometer Signal Processing: We used Bai et. al.
proposed accelerometer signal processing method [3]. We
used ActiLife tool [46], and calculated the Actigraphy counts
(from accelerometer) every 5 seconds, and detect the nonwear time (for invalid data removal). Within every 10seconds window, based on Actigraphy counts we further
extracted 8 statistical features, i.e.,mean, median, standard
deviation, variance, minimum value, maximum value, skewness and kurtosis for further processing.
Multimodal Feature Sequence Construction: After
preprocessing and feature engineering, the original segment can be transformed into a D-dimensional sequence
X = {xt ‚àà RD }Tt=1 where T is the sequence
length (i.e., the number of windows/epochs within a segment), and xt = f eatacc ‚à™ f eateda ‚à™ f eathrv where
f eatacc , f eateda , f eathr represent accelerometer, EDA and

HR features extracted above. Since, each of the extracted
features were in 10-seconds window, the concatenated input
feature xt has a dimension of 53 (33+12+8) per 10-seconds
in the time-series window.
2) Activity Recognition Module: We develop a two step
multi-label activity recognition framework which consists of
two LSTM with Consistency Self-Attention (LSTM-CSA)
[36] models, (1) gestural activity recognition and (2) postural
activity recognition. Both of the LSTM-CSA models are
independent from each other, trained and tested separately
using hand gesture and postural activity labels respectively
using the input accelerometer features (f eatacc ) and their
corresponding labels. For all LSTM-CSA models, we used
the following regularisation term
X
Œì(Œ±) = T
|Œ±t ‚àí Œ±t‚àí1 |
(1)
t

where T , Œì(Œ±) tends to penalize heavily with a larger
contextual scores (which will be fined later) to maintain its
global consistency.
3) Class Contextual Feature Maps: We develop a contextual feature mapping for each cognitive fatigue label which
can be represented as follows
X
cf mc (x, y) =
hmb (x, y)
cls(b)=c

CF Mc =

cf mc
max(cf mc

(2)

The output of the contextual feature map layer is a (Hc √ó
Wc √ó C) tensor, where Hc and Wc are the segment dimensions, and C is the number of classes. We consider (after
trial and error), we have set Hc = 23 while we have already
defined Wc = 53.
4) Contextual Scoring: We designed a scoring function
to measure the contextual relevance of cognitive fatigue
detection in relation to multiple-label‚Äôs presence in a window
[47]. Scores are computed using the contextual feature maps
generated in each stage of our pipeline, and are used as
the ranking score in AP calculations to measure whether
contextual learner confirms or refutes detections passed to it,
based on learned semantic relationships. The scoring process
is designed as a new network layer, and appended to the end
of each stage in our pipeline. We defined two contextualscoring method as per [47].
‚Ä¢ Individual Contextual Scoring: Gestural and posturalbased cognitive fatigue scoring has been estimated using
the following equation
P
F Mb (x, y)
Score1 (b) =
(3)
2 √ó 2œÉ 2
2œÉbx
by
where F Mb represents the activity bounding box (start
and end of an activity) related relevance score and b
represents each activity type i.e. gestural or postural
activity as per [47]. We have two types of individual
contextual scoring in our framework, gestural-based
cognitive fatigue scoring and postural-based cognitive
fatigue scoring (Fig. 3).

‚Ä¢

Cumulative Contextual Scoring: In this scoring
method, we add both gestural and postural activity based
cognitive fatigue scoring together for producing final
Activity-based cognitive fatigue re-scoring which can
be defined as follows
P
CF Mb (x, y)
(4)
Score2 (b) =
2 √ó 2œÉ 2
2œÉbx
by
where CF Mb represents the cumulative activity bounding box (start and end of an activity) related relevance
score and c represents cumulative activity type i.e., either gestural or postural activity-based cognitive fatigue
scoring or re-scoring [47].

B. Stage Two: Activity-Aware Cognitive Fatigue Learner
The second stage is an LSTM with Consistency SelfAttention (LSTM-CSA) model that is trained to learn semantic relationships using the cumulative contextual score
mapping generated by the primary cognitive fatigue detector
using the Equation 1.
III. E XPERIMENTAL E VALUATION
In this section, we aim to evaluate our proposed ActivityAware Recurrent (AcRoNN) performance towards developing
a personalized cognitive fatigue assessment system using
wearables without any target labels.
A. Datasets
We use two datasets to evaluate AcRoNN model performance which are described as follows:
‚Ä¢ A1: Activity Recognition Dataset: Previously, we
collected hand gestural (8-hand gestures) and postural
(4 postural) activity dataset to serve the purpose of our
previous papers [35], [48] using Empatica E4 watch. We
utilized the same dataset and developed hand gesture
and postural activity recognition framework as per our
proposed framework in this paper.
‚Ä¢ D1: Gamer‚Äôs Fatigue Dataset: We recruited 5 student
video games players (age ranges from 19-25) for 7 days
who stayed up during a 22 hour shift every alternative day (4 days each) to simulate cognitive fatigue
while wearing Empatica E4 watch [4]. Empatica E4
watch consists of accelerometer (ACC), electrodermal
activity (EDA), photoplethysmography (PPG) and skin
temperature (TEMP) sensors. During the data collection
(including non-gaming days), participates were asked
to measure their sleepiness based on the ‚ÄòStanford
Sleepiness Scale‚Äô (SSS) [5], [8] (ranges 1-7 representing
active to extremely sleepy) and the ‚ÄòSleep-2-peak‚Äô score
[6] (ranges 1-7 representing active to extremely sleepy)
using Sleep2Peak Android App [7], [9].
‚Ä¢ D2: Healthy Adults Fatigue Dataset: We have used
publicly available health adults fatigue dataset [10],
[11]. Data from 28 healthy individuals (26‚Äì55 years
of age, average age 42 years, 41/51% female/male),
of which 17 enrolled up to 2 days after returning
from long-haul flights with 3‚Äì7 time zone differences

and hence were recovering from jet lag, from 1 to
219 consecutive days (mean 35, median 9, total 973
days) were collected. Objective data were collected
using a multisensor wearable device, Everion (Biovotion
AG, Switzerland [12]), in conjunction with a mobile
app, SymTrack (Gastric GmbH, Switzerland), to deliver
a daily fatigue questionnaire. Volunteers were asked
to continuously wear the Everion device around their
non-dominant arm over a 1-week period. The device
combines a 3-axis accelerometer, barometer, galvanic
skin response electrode, and temperature and photo
sensors. Dataset tracked a total of 12 parameters at 1-Hz
temporal resolution on physical activity and physiology.
Volunteers were instructed to complete a 4-item daily
questionnaire in the evening to capture their subjective
assessment of fatigue, adapted from the Fatigue Assessment Scale [13] and Visual Analogue Scale to evaluate
fatigue severity [14]: (10 Physical fatigue score (PhF),
(2) Mental fatigue score (MF), (3) Visual analogue scale
score (VAS), and, (4) Indicator of relative perception
(RelP) (see [10], [11] for more details).
B. Pre-Processing
For each subject and parameter, we excluded days where
more than 80% of the samples were missing to ensure an
acceptable performance of downstream analysis. Missing
samples were due to subjects not wearing the device (e.g.,
during charging) or low-quality segments (e.g., loss of skin
contact). This filtering step led to a total of 5 subjects and
821 hours of data annotated (Stanford Sleepiness Scale and
Sleep-2-peak) labels with continuous Empatica E4 sensor
data (excluding 1 hour recharging sessions). Finally, we
imputed missing data gaps using the state-of-the-art unidirectional uncorrelated recurrent imputation model from Cao
et al [15].
C. Baseline Algorithm development
We re-implemented latest cognitive fatigue estimation
framework [3]. In Bai et. al. [3], authors generated highest
accuracy of cognitive fatigue assessment using LSTM-CSA
model. Although, Bai et. al. provided cognitive fatigue detection method based on PPG (ECG) and Accelerometer sensor
signal processing, we implemented the following baselines
from Bai et. al. method as follows.
‚Ä¢ B1: In this framework, we considered original Bai et. al.
approach i.e. using only ECG and Actigraphy features
(total number of features 41 = 33+8) and followed Bai
et. al. to re-implement original baseline paper‚Äôs result
without any alteration.
‚Ä¢ B2: In this framework, we considered our 53 features
that include Actigraphy, PPG and EDA features and
applied Bai et. al. proposed LSTM-CSA model for
cognitive fatigue assessment.
‚Ä¢ B3: In this framework, we combined our activity recognizer produced hand gesture and posture detections, and
applied Bai et. al. considered 41 features (Actigraphy
and ECG) and used our proposed AcRoNN framework.

‚Ä¢

AcRoNN: We combine everything together as proposed
in this paper.

D. Results and Comparisons
Table I shows details of our experimental results and
comparisons with our different baseline models. We can
easily identify that our model AcRoNN outperforms all of the
baseline models significantly in both of our collected datasets
and already available datasets. Also, we can firmly say
that, our AcRoNN model outperforms baseline significantly
even though we chose to use baseline proposed sensors
(Actigraphy and ECG) related features only.

IV. L IMITATIONS AND F UTURE W ORKS
We have collected data from only 5 student volunteers
in a limited setting due to the on-going pandemic related
lockdown that blocked us from reaching mass population
in the campus and dormitory of University of Massachusetts
Lowell. However, our unique Activity-Aware attention model
has been evaluated on a publicly available data that provides
us ample confidence of the efficacy of our developed framework. We also could not validate the activity recognition
accuracy in the collected data due to the unavailability
of camera data as per the IRB exemption. However, our
collected activity data (A1) has been well-validated by our
previous researches which were published in top venues [34],
[35], that provides us validity of the activity recognition
dataset as well as the related outputs that have been used in
our AcRoNN framework‚Äôs stage-1. In future, while the lockdown will be ended, we plan to collect more data engaging
more students in the campus and out of campus, more likely
in real cognitively stressed and fatigue community such as
healthcare workers, construction workers and scuba divers.
V. C ONCLUSION
To develop an automated cognitive fatigue assessment system, we introduced a new pipeline from data collection, data
preprocessing, feature engineering, attention based LSTM
and a novel context-aware LSTM model flow. To our best
knowledge, AcRoNN is the best cognitive fatigue detection
model in the existing literature which can be extended to
any other physiological health assessment with proper study
design and data collection. Our efficient two-step feature

map scoring method provides a new concept in contextaware activity and health monitoring research area that can be
utilized to provide appropriate care to patients with dementia,
asthma, post-traumatic stress disorder and so on.
