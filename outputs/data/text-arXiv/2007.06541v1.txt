Abstract
In this short technical report we model, within the Bayesian framework, the rate of
positive tests reported by the the State of Indiana, accounting also for the substantial variability (and overdispeartion) in the daily count of the tests performed. The approach we
take, results with a simple procedure for prediction, a posteriori, of this rate of ’positivity’ and allows for an easy and a straightforward adaptation by any agency tracking daily
results of COVID-19 tests. The numerical results provided herein were obtained via an
updatable R Markdown document.
Keywords: posterior prediction interval; Beta-Negative Binomial distribution

1 Introduction
The Indiana State Department of Health, (ISDH), as any other similar entity across the nation
and world-wide, is closely monitoring nowadays a pandemic of the 2019 novel Coronavirus,
AKA: COVID-19. According to the World Health Organizing, (WHO), this highly contagious
respiratory virus was first identified and reported in the city of Wuhan in China in early January
2020. Since then, this virus continues to spread and infect people around the world, including
the United States. On March 11, 2020, the WHO published an assessment that COVID-19
can be characterized as a Pandemic. As of the date of this report (July 7, 2020), the John
Hopkins University’s Coronavirus Resource Center, reported over 11,500,000 infected people
and 538,000 deaths due to the Coronavirus, globally, of which over 2,938,000 infections and
130,000 deaths are in the USA alone.
The state of Indiana was not spared of the contagious impact of the virus. On March 6,
ISDH confirmed the first case of COVID-19 in a Hoosier with recent travel. On March 16,
the ISDH reported the first death in Indiana due to COVID-19. It subsequently worked with
federal and local partners, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, (CDC),

to respond to this pandemic and the grave public health situation. Among other responses, the
ISDH created a dashboard and a data depository for tracking and reporting the daily number
of COVID-19 deaths in the State as well as the daily number of tests performed and the daily
number of positive cases. While there is substantial (and urgent) effort being made, worldwide, for modeling of the the death rate (or the infection fatality rate, IFR) of COVID-19, (see
for example Basu (2020)), there has been very little attention given to modeling the rate of
reported positive tests (often referred to rate of ’positivity’).
In this report we model, within the Bayesian framework, the rate of positive tests reported
by the the State of Indiana, accounting also for the substantial variability of the daily number
test performed. The Bayesian approach has been used successfully in other COVID-19 related
studies, e.g.: Dana, at. el. (2020), or Bayes, at. el. (2020). However, to the best of our
knowledge, none of the available studies (to date) have direct relevancy to the modeling of the
rate of positivity. The approach we take, provides a method for a valid prediction of this rate
and allows for an easy and a straightforward adaptation by any agency tracking daily results of
COVID-19 tests.

2 The available ISDH data
The Indiana COVID-19 data are available for retrieval through the ISDH Data Hub [10] as are
reported for the state in the file covid report date.xlsx. It includes the daily records of
the number of COVID-19 deaths cases, the total (daily) number of testings performed and the
count of the positive cases, (see Appendix B for additional information).
For the purpose of this report, we focus attention only on two of the quantities reported;
the daily reported number of test performed, COVID TEST and the daily reported number of
positive tests, COVID COUNT as were reported for the (successive) 127 daily records to date.
Their ratio, the daily Percentage of Positive Tests (PPT), is used for tracking and monitoring
the pandemic’s progression by the state and localities. The PPT is also an important indicator
of the scope and extent of the state’s testing enterprise; its high value suggests that testing
is conducted primarily of the sickest patients and less so of the mild or the asymptomatic
cases. A lower PPT may suggest that testing has been extended to cover patients with milder
or no symptoms at all. According to the CDC Guidelines [7], among other stipulations, a
PPT ≤ 15% serves as a threshold for entering Phase II of the reopening plans for the State,
whereas achieving a PPT ≤ 10% serves a threshold of entering Phase III of the reopening
plans. At present, the 7-day average of this rate (of positive tests) for Indiana is 7.61% and
cumulatively, the Indiana PPT stands at 9.18% (i.e. the total number of positive tests relative
to the total number of tests performed to date, see also the ISDH Dashboard, which enabled
the state to enter Phase III of the reopening plans. Thus, the importance of the appropriate
modeling and tracking this percentage of reported positive tests cannot be overstated, as it has
tremendous economic implications for the State and its people. In particular, constructing a
valid predictive model, which predicts reasonably well the ’next-day’ PPT, would provide the
State with an early sign of a looming surge in positive cases, and would allow it to implement
corrective measures and policies.

still updating, we included records up to the last 3 days in the series. Thus, the data series
includes m = 109 data points out of the available 127 records. Also marked in the figure are
two horizontal lines indicating the 10% and 5% thresholds. In Appendix A below, we provide

In Figure 2 above, we present the cumulative PPT rate for Indiana over these days. We also
super-imposed on the daily chart the 0.95 (or 95%) posterior predictive interval of [0.07981, 0.1001]
for the current Indiana (cumulative) PPT rate, as resulted from the Bayesian predictive modeling we developed and present in this report (see Illustrations 1 and 2 below). As can be seen,
the calculated posterior prediction interval contains the CDC’s 10% threshold, which could
serve as an early warning flag to the State and may prompt it to initiate some mitigating measures (such as mandating masks in public) in an effort to maintain the rate of positivity below
it.

3 Bayesian modeling of Indiana’s testing data
Having retrieved the data as described above, we labeled them as yi ≡COVID COUNT and
ki ≡COVID TESTS for i = 1, . . . , m where m = 109 is the total number of observations
included in the analysis. Thus, we denote the given data as Dm = {(yi , ki ), i = 1, . . . , m }.
Ordinarily, when modeling the count of positive test results yi recorded out of the ki tests
performed (assuming independence, risk homogeneity of the tested population and no lagging
information), the binomial model would be appropriate. So that conditional on the number of
tests performed, and a given p ∈ (0, 1)
yi |ki , p ∼ Binom(ki , p), i = 1, . . . , m.

(1)

Accordingly, given k1 , k2 , . . . , km , the daily counts of the positive tests, y1 , y2 , . . . , ym are conditionally independent binomial random variables with p = Pr(T est = +). In a similar fashion,
we model the reported number of tests performed k1 , k2 , . . . , km as (independent) Negative Binomial random variables. That is, for given (fixed) integer r > 0, and θ ∈ (0, 1),
ki |θ ∼ NegBinom(r, θ), i = 1, . . . , m.

(2)

As we can see from Appendix A, the observed marginal distribution of the reported daily
number of test performed is exhibiting over-dispersion features that are characteristic to mixedPoisson or to Negative Binomial counts. Thus, combining (1)-(2), we obtain that given (p, θ),
the joint probability (mass) function of the m pairs, (yi , ki ), i = 1, . . . , m, (i.e. the likelihood
function), is

where, ∝ indicates proportionality of terms, up to a constant, and where Nm = j=1 k j and Xm =

j=1 y j are the cumulative reported number of tests performed and the cumulative reported
positive tests. We note in passing that the cumulative PPT rate mentioned in the Introduction
is merely the ratio, p̂m := Xm /Nm .

3.1 The conjugate Bayesian model
The standard Bayesian predictive model in the case of Binomial-Negative Binomial counts
(as in (1)-(2)), is that with the conjugate Beta-Beta joint prior distribution on (p, θ) (see for
4

example Gelman et. al. (2014)). That is, in the case of the likelihood function f (Dm |p, θ)
given in (3) above, we consider the Bayesian model that assumes that for given p, and Nm ,
Xm |Nm , p ∼ Binom(Nm , p),

with

p ∼ Beta(a, b),

(4)

with

θ ∼ Beta(c, d),

(5)

for some a > 0 and b > 0 and where, given θ > 0,
Nm |θ ∼ NegBinom(mr, θ),

for some fixed integer r > 0, and some c > 0, and d > 0. Thus, the joint prior pd f of (p, θ) is,
π(p, θ) ∝ pa−1 (1 − p)b−1 × θc−1 (1 − θ)d−1

(6)

Accordingly, and since the joint posterior pd f for (p, θ) **given** the data Dm , is
π(p, θ| Dm ) ∝ f (Dm |p, λ) × π(p, θ)
∝ π(p |Xm , Nm ) × π(θ |Nm ),
we immediately obtain from (3)-(6) (due to the conjugacy) that **given** the data, Xm and Nm ,
the (marginal) posterior distribution of p, denoted as π(p |Xm , Nm ), is also a Beta distribution
and the (marginal) posterior distribution of θ, denoted as π(θ |Nm ), is also a Beta distribution.
Specifically, it follows that given Xm and Nm ,
p|Xm ,Nm ∼ Beta(am , bm )

and

θ|Nm ∼ Beta(cm , dm ),

where these four updated parameters are given by:
a m = a + Xm ,

bm = b + Nm − Xm ,

cm = c + Nm ,

and

dm = d + mr.

(7)

Hence, the Bayes estimates of θ and p given the data (Xm , Nm ), are the respective posterior
means:
am
a + Xm
p̂B = E( p |Xm , Nm ) =
≡
.
am + bm a + b + Nm
and
cm
c + Xm
θ̂B = E( θ |Xm , Nm ) =
≡
.
cm + dm c + d + Nm + mr
Remark: The choice in (2) for using the Negative Binomial distribution to model the
reported daily number of tests ki , could be seen as specific to the Indiana COVID-19 testing
data, which might reflect testing capacity limitation and daily variability unique to that state.
Other models that account for the observed overdispersion characteristics of the data (See
Appendix A) could be used instead. For instance, one may alternatively consider the related
mixed-Poisson distribution in (2).
Illustration 1: For the Bayesian modeling of Indiana COVID-19 Testing Data, we take
a = b = 1 so that the prior mean of p (the PPT) is E(p) = 0.5 and we take c = d = 1 so the
prior mean of θ is E(θ) = 0.5 too. For the given data we used r = 3 and have, m = 109, Nm =
5.22946 × 105 and Xm = 4.6907 × 104 , to calculate p̂B = 0.0897 and θ̂B = 0.9993732 as the
posterior mean of p and θ, respectively, given the data Xm and Nm . Clearly, the choices of values
for the prior parameters a, b, c and d, could be guided empirically (i.e. using an empirical Bayes
approach), however, in light of the magnitude of the given data counts, Xm and Nm , this model
exhibits very little sensitivity to the choices of these prior parameters.

4 The posterior predictive model
Having observed (Xm , Nm ), the posterior predictive distribution , under the Bayesian model
(3)-(6) and given (Xm , Nm ), of a ‘new’ (or ‘future’) observation on the number of positive
cases, Y ∗ , out of a given K ∗ = k∗ new tests is the the beta-binomial distribution,

(7)

for y∗ = 0, 1, . . . , k∗. We denote this (predictive) distribution for Y ∗ , given K ∗ = k∗ , as
Y ∗ ∼ BetaBinom(k∗, am , bm ),
with am and bm as in (7). The corresponding posterior predictive mean and variance of Y ∗ are
given by
am
≡ k∗ × p̂B ,
E(Y ∗ |K ∗ = k∗ , Xm , Nm ) = k∗ ×

and
am + bm + k ∗
Var(Y ∗ |K ∗ = k∗ , Xm , Nm ) = k∗ × p̂B (1 − p̂B ) ×
,
am + bm + 1
respectively.
In a similar manner we obtain the posterior predictive distribution under this Bayesian
model and given (Xm , Nm ), of a ‘new’ (or ‘future’) number of tests K ∗ is the Beta-Negative
Binomial distribution. In fact, with K ∗ |θ ∼ NegBinom(r, θ), we have

for k∗ = 0, 1, 2, . . . . We denote this (posterior predictive) distribution for K ∗ as
K ∗ ∼ BetaNegBinom(r, cm, dm ),
with cm and dm as in (7). The corresponding posterior predictive mean and variance of K ∗ are
given by

It is straightforward to see that the joint posterior predictive probability (mass) function of
(Y , K ∗ ), can easily be obtained from expressions (7) and (8) is
∗

Pr(Y ∗ =y∗ , K ∗ = k∗ |Xm , Nm ) =

Clearly, along with the value of Y ∗ as the number of positive tests predicted out of the
predicted number of tests, K ∗ , one may obtain their ratio, p∗ := Y ∗ /K ∗ , as the rate of positive
tests predicted next, given the data. While an explicit expression for the posterior predictive
distribution of p∗ is not readily available, it may be estimated, quite accurately, through MonteCarlo simulations. Towards that end, we denote by Q∗m (·) the posterior predictive cd f of p∗ ,
given the data Dm . That is, for any t ∈ R,
Q∗m (t) := Pr( p∗ ≤ t |Xm , Nm ),
and recall that the αth percentile (α ∈ (0, 1)), of this distribution, is defined as
tα∗ := inf{ t, s.t. Q∗m (t) ≥ α }.

(10)

∗
Thus, when available, the interval, [t1−α
, tα∗ ] serves as a 1 − 2α posterior prediction interval for
p∗ given the data Dm , so that
∗
Pr(t1−α
≤ p∗ ≤ tα∗ | Xm , Nm ) = 1 − 2α.

4.1 Estimating the predictive distribution of the PPT
As was mentioned in the previous section, while explicit expression for Q∗m (·), the posterior
predictive cd f of p∗ , given the data Dm , is not available, it may be estimated via MonteCarlo simulations which exploit the explicit expression, in (9), for the joint posterior predictive
distribution of (Y ∗ , K ∗ ). Given the data, Dm and with parameters am , bm , cm and dm and with r
as above, generate a random sample of a large size B (B = 5, 000, say) from Q∗m (·) as follows:
1) Given Nm , draw K ∗ ∼ BetaNegBinom(r, cm , dm );
2) Given Xm , Nm and K ∗ = k∗ , draw Y ∗ ∼ BetaBinom(k∗, am , bm ) to obtain the pair (y∗ , k∗ );
3) Calculate the simulated predicted PPT as p∗ = y∗ /k∗ .
4) Repeat steps (1)-(3) B times so as to form p∗1 , p∗2 , . . . , p∗B as a random sample from Q∗m (·).
Having obtained the random sample p∗1 , p∗2 , . . . , p∗B , we estimate Q∗m (·) by its empirical version
B
1X ∗
∗
I[pi ≤ t],
∀t ∈ R.
Q̂B,m (t) =
B i=1
7

Accordingly, and in similarity to (10), we estimate the αst percentile of Q∗m (·) by
tˆα∗ := inf{ t, s.t. Q̂∗B,m (t) ≥ α }.
A simple R script (see Appendix C) which utilizes the built-in functions rbnbinom() (for
the BetaNegBinom(·) distribution) and rbbinom() (for the BetaBinom(·) distribution), of the
extraDistr package produces the simulated sample from the (respective) posterior predictive
distribution of (Y ∗ , K ∗ ) and the corresponding predicted PPT, p∗ = Y ∗ /K ∗ .
Illustration 2: We continue with the same prior parameterization used in Illustration 1, of
a = b = 1, c = d = 1 and r = 3. Recall that the given data Dm , yields, m = 109, Nm =
5.22946 × 105 and Xm = 4.6907 × 104 . We first simulated B = 5000 sample values for the
respective predictive distributions of (Y ∗ , K ∗ ) and of p∗ and used these simulated values to
estimate the posterior predictive distribution of p∗ , which in turn, was used it to obtain the
95% posterior prediction interval, [0.07981, 0.1001] for the ‘next-day’ Indiana’s PPT as was
displayed in Figure 2. The means and standard deviations of the (estimated) posterior predictive distributions of Y ∗ , K ∗ and p∗ , along with the corresponding 95% prediction interval are
presented in Table 1 below.

We conclude this illustration with Figure 6, where we display the posterior prediction intervals for the PPT as were calculated for each report day in the series. That is, based on the

given data on the nth day, Dn , we calculated the 95% posterior predicted interval for the PPT
on the (n + 1)th , day (the ”next” day), for each n = 2, 3, . . . , m of the m = 109 days available in
the data set. As can be seen, each of the daily calculated PPT (as in Figure 2), fell well within
the corresponding prediction interval (marked in red in Figure 6) as was calculated based on
the previous’ days data, thus providing also a partial validation for the applicability of this
Bayesian approach (with its underlying assumptions) to these COVID-19 count data.
