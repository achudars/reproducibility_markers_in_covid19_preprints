A BSTRACT
The infectious coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has
become a serious global pandemic. Different studies have
shown that increasing temperature can play a crucial role in
the spread of the virus. Most of these studies were limited to
winter or moderate temperature levels and were conducted using conventional models. However, traditional models are too
simplistic to investigate complex, non-linear relationships and
suffer from some restrictions. Therefore, we employed copula
models to examine the impact of high temperatures on virus
transmission. The findings from the copula models showed
that there was a weak to moderate effect of temperature on
the number of infections and the effect almost vanished under
a lockdown policy. Therefore, this study provides new insight
into the relationship between COVID-19 and temperature, both
with and without social isolation practices. Such results can
lead to improvements in our understanding of this new virus.
In particular, the results derived from the copula models examined here, unlike existing traditional models, provide evidence
that there is no substantial influence of high temperatures
on the active COVID-19 outbreak situation. In addition, the
results indicate that the transmission of COVID-19 is strongly
influenced by social isolation practices. To the best of the
authors’ knowledge, this is the first copula model investigation
applied to the COVID-19 pandemic.
I NTRODUCTION
In December 2019, a novel infectious disease termed
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was discovered in
Wuhan city, Hubei province, China. Subsequently, and
through human-to human transmission, this virus has caused
a global pandemic. COVID-19 is characterized by clinical
features similar to those caused by severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle Eastern
respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infections,
such as a fever and dry cough [1].
Previous studies have shown that meteorological variables
can affect the transmission and survival of coronaviruses [2],

[3]. Earlier research [3] found that MERS-CoV is most active
at high temperatures and low humidity.
Notably, recent studies have shown that warm weather
and high humidity may be important factors for reducing the
spread of COVID-19 (e.g., see [4]). Conversely, some existing
studies have found that increasing temperatures will not affect
the transmission of COVID-19 (e.g., see [5]). However, most
of these studies were limited to winter or low-temperature
weather with a small number of observations. Hence, there is
still no definitive evidence as to whether there is a negative
association between environmental variables and the spread
of COVID-19 in extremely hot or cold locations [4]. Besides,
most previous studies were performed using traditional
models, which are too simplistic and may be unable to
deal with complex, non-linear dependency patterns. Thus,
further research to understand the activity of COVID-19
under high-temperature conditions is warranted. In addition,
such an association should be investigated not only in regard
to weather variables, but also by taking into account the
lockdown situation at these locations. Presently, copula
models have become a favored statistical tool to describe
the association between variables. These models have been
applied in different areas, including the study of infectious
diseases (e.g., see [6]) and environmental science (e.g., see
[7]). One important benefit of using a copula model is that
one can model the marginal distribution independently from
the dependency structures, which are completely captured via
the copula function. Another benefit of using a copula model
is that the margins do not need to follow the same parametric
family. Furthermore, many copula families exist, each with its
own capability to describe the unique dependency structure.
Hence, various types of associations can be discovered via
copula models.
Hence, this study aimed to perform flexible statistical
modeling with a copula model to improve our knowledge
about the spread of the virus in hot locations with different
curfew levels. Specifically, we investigated the impact of high

Both the COVID-19 confirmed cases and the average temperature data demonstrated a non-normal distribution for all
cities. Fig 1 shows the confirmed cases during the study
period, where the new confirmed cases of COVID-19 in
Riyadh exceeded 1500 from 08 to 15 June 2020. However, the
highest records for Mecca and Jeddah were generally similar
and lower than those of Riyadh.
Copula
Copula is a Latin word that means joins or links. A
copula function refers to a multivariate function that joins the
multivariate distribution functions to their univariate standard
uniform margins [14]. Formally, a copula can be defined as
follows: copulas [15] are multivariate cumulative distribution
functions with uniform marginal distributions on (0,1) such
that:
C : [0, 1]n → [0, 1],
n ≥ 2.

For this study, the cities of Riyadh, Mecca, and Jeddah
were selected for the analysis. Riyadh is the capital city
of Saudi Arabia and the city most affected by COVID-19
in this country. Riyadh had 37, 244 confirmed cases for the
observed period from 13 March 2020 to 15 June 2020. The
population of Riyadh estimated for the middle of 2018 based
on demographic survey data collected in 2016 was 8, 446, 866
[10]. Jedda and Mecca are the second most affected cities
in Saudi Arabia, with 21, 152 and 20, 248 confirmed cases,
respectively.
Daily counts of confirmed cases for the study period were
collected from official reports [11] based on information
[12] for Saudi Arabia. The daily average temperature data
for the same period time were obtained from the Weather
Underground Company [13].

temperatures on the number of confirmed cases in the cities
of Riyadh, Jeddah, and Mecca in Saudi Arabia, and these
cities were selected for several reasons. First, Saudi Arabia
has been strongly affected by MERS-CoV [8], [9], which
produces a similar severe respiratory illness as COVID-19.
Second, the highest numbers of confirmed cases in Saudi
Arabia have been recorded in Riyadh, Jeddah, and Mecca,
which are three of the hottest areas in Saudi Arabia. Third,
because of the transmission of COVID-19, Mecca and Jeddah
have been placed under a series of lockdowns for a long
time. Riyadh, however, was only placed under a curfew
for a short period. Hence, these cities represent strong to
moderate lockdown situations, which could be a factor critical
to understanding the effects of high temperatures on the
spread of COVID-19. By using the data from these cities and
capitalizing on the flexibility of copula models, we aimed
to provide clear evidence on the association between high
temperatures and confirmed cases of COVID-19.

Sklar’s theorem [16] is the key rule of the copula function,
and it can be introduced as follows:
Theorem 0.1 (Sklar’s theorem): If F is an n-variate distribution function with univariate margins F1 , F2 , ....., Fn , then
there exists an n-variate copula function, C, such that ∀
0
x = (x1 , .., xn ) ∈ Rn :
F (x1 , x2 , ...., xn ) = C(F1 (x1 ), F2 (x2 ), ...., Fn (xn )).

(2)

If the margins are continuous, then the copula

and its density function is:

C(u1 , u2 , ...., un ) = F (F1−1 (u1 ), F2−1 (u2 ), ..., Fn−1 (un ))
(3)
is unique, where F −1 is the inverse function of the margins
and u ∈ [0, 1]n . Conversely, if F1 , ..., Fn are the marginal
distribution functions and C is a copula function, then the
function F (defined by equation (2)) is a joint distribution
function with margins F1 , ..., Fn .
In accordance with Sklar’s theorem (2), a copula models
the marginal distributions separately from the dependency
pattern, with no restriction on the type of margins.

c(u1 , u2 ) = [(1 − u1 )θ + (1 − u2 )θ − (1 − u1 )θ (1 − u2 )θ ] θ −2

In this study, we consider an arbitrary number of copula types
including the Joe, Gumbel, and Clayton copulas, as well
as their rotation types. In addition, we consider the Frank,
Gaussian, t-students, and other two-parametric copulas, such
as the Joe-Frank (BB8) copula. The following text provides
details on some commonly used copula families.

ϕ(t) = − ln[ ee−θ −1
Frank copula can control both the negative and positive
dependency pattern, where the strongest dependency
occurs at the center of the distribution. However, in the
Frank copula, the extremes are independent.
The distribution function of the Frank copula can
be given by:

and its density function is:

e−θ − 1 + (e−θu1 − 1)(e−θu2 − 1)

Clayton copula is a one-parametric (θ > 0) nonsymmetric Archimedean copula. It is a lower positive tail
dependence copula with generator ϕ(t) = θ1 (t−θ − 1). Its
distribution is given by:

Joe copula, in contrast to the Clayton copula, this is
a one-parametric upper tail Archimedean copula with
generator ϕ(t) = ln[1 − (1 − t)θ ]. Its distribution function
is:

×(1 − u1 )θ−1 (1 − u2 )θ−1 [θ − 1 + (1 − u1 )θ
+(1 − u2 )θ − (1 − u1 )θ (1 − u2 )θ ].
(9)
Rotated copula refers to a rotation version of asymmetric
copulas. This rotation includes 90, 180, and 270 rotation
degrees, with arguments (1 − u1 , u2 ), (u1 , 1 − u2 ), and
(1−u1 , 1−u2 ), respectively. The 180 rotation degree produces a corresponding survival copula family. However,
rotations by 90 and 270 degrees provide corresponding
copulas to deal with negative dependencies. For more
details on rotated copulas, see for example, [17], [18],
[19], and [20].
Pseudo maximum-likelihood method: In this study, we applied the so-called pseudo maximum-likelihood method (PML)
to estimate the parameters for the selected copula function. PML is introduced by [21] as a two-step estimation
method. With this method, the margins are estimated nonparametrically via their empirical cumulative distribution function at first, and then, the copula parameter (θc ) is estimated
at the second step. By using PML, the copula parameter is
estimated by maximizing the copula density, i.e.,
•

LMPL (θc ) =

n
X

log[c(u1i , u2i ; θc )],

(10)

i=1

where u1 = F̂1 (x1 ; α1 ) and u2 = F̂2 (x2 ; α2 ) are the empirical
probability integral transform of variable X1 and X2 , respectively. A simulation study of [22] showed that the performance
of PML is better than that of the full maximum likelihood
estimation method and Inference Function of Margins of [23]
if the margins are unknown, which is the case in almost all
real life applications.
A. Goodness-of-fit test
As there is a wide range of copula functions, it is necessary
to test the copula shape with the best fit. Therefore, we will
use the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) of [24] and the
Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) of [25] to select the
right copula. AIC and BIC can be given by:
AIC = −2 ln L(θ̂) + 2P,

(11)

BIC = −2 ln L(θ̂) + P (ln (N)),

(12)

where θ̂ is the estimated value of the parameters, and P is
the number of the model parameters.

The summary of the full inference steps of copula models
used in this study is as follows:
• Transform the continuous variable of the observed data
to copula data.
1
C(u1 , u2 ) = 1−[(1−u1 )θ +(1−u2 )θ −(1−u1 )θ (1−u2 )θ ] θ ,
• Calculate the cumulative density function for the discrete

variable of the observed data.

This study used a copula model to investigate the
relationship between high temperatures and confirmed cases
of COVID-19 for three cities in Saudi Arabia. The existing
number of copulas is large, and to select the most appropriate
fitted model for each city, bicop() function of R ( [26])
package [27] was used. As bicop() allows one to consider
different selection criteria at each run, it was applied to each
data set twice, one with BIC and the other one with AIC.
The results of these models are provided in Tables (II, III).

variables became independent at extreme values. Therefore,
the results provide clear evidence that SARS-CoV-2 can
still remain an active virus in hot places. In the case of
Mecca, the survival Joe copula with a low dependency level
(θ = 1.92, τ = 0.34) was selected as the most appropriate
copula function. With these data, there was only a very weak
dependency pattern between high temperatures and confirmed
cases at the low values. This relationship reflects the period

The question that now remains is, do high temperatures affect
the transmission of COVID-19? To answer this question,
we need to mention some of the main similarities and
differences among these cities regarding the (1) temperature,
(2) confirmed cases of COVID-19, (3) copula model results,
and (4) lockdown situations. First, the temperatures in Riyadh
and Jeddah were almost the same and slightly higher than
those in Mecca. However, the number of confirmed cases in
Riyadh was higher than that in Jeddah and Mecca. In addition,
Mecca and Jeddah had almost the same number of confirmed
cases. Hence, the same temperature levels were associated
with different numbers of new confirmed cases within the
three cities. Thus, COVID-19 can spread differently at the
same temperature level. Second, the fitted copula models
show that the dependency between the temperature and
number of COVID-19 cases was very similar for Riyadh and
Jeddah, while it was very low for Mecca. Given the first and
second points mentioned above, there was another important
factor driving the active situation of this new virus, namely,
the lockdown situation. During the study period, the cities
of Jeddah and Mecca were placed under a lockdown on 29
March 2020 and 30 March 2020, respectively. Then, Mecca
was subjected to a 24 hour curfew on 02 April 2020. Later,
on 04 April 2020, various areas in Jeddah were placed under
a 24 hour curfew. After about one day, Riyadh too was
placed under a 24 hour curfew for approximately 18 days.
Then, on 25 April 2020, Jeddah and Riyadh were placed
under partial curfews, while Mecca still remained under a
24 lockdown. Hence, Mecca experienced a long lockdown
period, while duration of curfew in Riyadh was the shortest.
These factors may explain the similarity in copula results for
Riyadh and Jeddah and the low dependency pattern in the
case of Mecca. In consideration of these last findings, we can
conclude that high temperatures had only a weak to moderate
effect on the transmission of COVID-19 if there was a partial
curfew policy in place. However, this effect vanished under
the condition of strong social isolation. Hence, even in hot
places, COVID-19 can still spread readily when no social
distancing is implemented.
C ONCLUSION
This study examined the effect of high temperatures on the
spread of COVID-19 in hot climates under different curfew
situations using copula models. We applied the models to
the cities of Riyadh, Jeddah, and Mecca in Saudi Arabia.
For Riyadh and Jeddah, which had almost the same average
temperature level, the association between temperature and
confirmed cases of COVID-19 reflected a moderate positive
Frank copula. However, the number of COVID-19 cases in
Riyadh was higher than the number in Jeddah. Hence, the
transmission of this virus in these two cities may have been
affected by the curfew level and not by the high temperature.

In the case of Mecca, which had a temperature level (slightly)
less than that of Riyadh and Jeddah, there was a very weak
dependency between temperature and the number of COVID19 cases. However, the number of confirmed cases of COVID19 in Mecca was very close to the number in Jeddah. In
addition, Mecca was under a strong 24 hour lockdown for
more than half of the observed data set. Therefore, there is
clear evidence that high temperatures are not able to stop the
spread of this virus if there is no social isolation. Clearly,
lockdowns represent the most effective strategy to prevent the
spread of this virus. To the best of our knowledge, this study
describes the first copula model fitted to COVID-19 data. The
results of this study, derived using copula models, are unlike
those derived using existing traditional methods and indicate
that the association between COVID-19 and temperature is
weak and no substantial decreases in the number of COVID19 cases can be expected in response to high temperatures.
