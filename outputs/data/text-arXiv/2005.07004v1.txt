On COVID-19 Modelling

May 10, 2020
This contribution analyzes the COVID-19 outbreak by comparably simple mathematical and numerical methods. The final goal is to predict the peak of the epidemic outbreak per country with a reliable technique. This is done by an algorithm
motivated by standard SIR models and aligned with the standard data provided by
the Johns Hopkins University. To reconstruct data for the unregistered Infected,
the algorithm uses current values of the infection fatality rate and a data-driven
estimation of a specific form of the recovery rate. All other ingredients are datadriven as well. Various examples of predictions are provided for illustration.

1 Introduction and Overview
This contribution starts in section 2 with a rather elementary reconciliation of
the standard SIR model for epidemics, featuring the central notions like Basic
Reproduction Number, Herd Immunity Threshold, and Doubling Time, together
with some critical remarks on their abuse in the media. Experts can skip over
this completely. Readers interested in the predictions should jump right away to
section 5.
Section 3 describes the Johns Hopkins data source with its limitations and flaws,
and then presents a variation of a SIR model that can be applied directly to the
data. It allows to estimate basic parameters, including the Basic Reproduction
Number, but does not work for predictions of peaks of epidemics.
To achieve the latter goal, section 4 combines the data-compatible model of section 3 with a SIR model dealing with the unknown Susceptibles and the unregistered Infectious. This needs two extra parameters that should be extracted from
the literature. The first is the infection fatality rate, as provided e.g. by [11, 10],
combined with the case fatality rate that can be deduced from the Johns Hopkins

data. This parameter is treated in section 4.3, and like [2] it gives a detection rate
for the confirmed cases.
Section 4.4 introduces a version of a recovery rate that can be directly used in
the model and estimated from the infection fatality rate and the observable case
fatality and case death rates. However, this parameter is not needed for prediction,
just for determination of the unknown variables from the known data as long as
the latter are available.
Then section 5 combines all of this into an algorithm that makes predictions under
the assumption that there are no further changes to the parameters induced by
political action. It estimates the parameters of a full SIR model from the available
Johns-Hopkins data by the techniques of section 4, using two additional technical
parameters: the number of days used backwards for estimation of constants, and
the number of days in which recovery or death must be expected, for estimation
of case fatality and recovery rates. After the data-driven estimation of these parameters, the prediction uses only the case fatality rate. All other ingredients are
derived from the Johns Hopkins data.
Results are presented in section 5. Given the large uncertainties in the JohnsHopkins data, the predictions are rather plausible. However, reality will have the
final word on this prediction model.
The paper closes with a summary and a list of open problems.

2 Classical SIR Modeling
This contains some basic notions that are useful for modelling epidemics, and that
were in use in the media during the COVID-19 outbreak. Among other things,
there will be a rigid mathematical underpinning of what is precisely meant by
• flattening the epidemic outbreak,
• basic reproduction number,
• Herd Immunity Threshold, and
• doubling time,

pointing out certain abuses of these notions. This will not work without calculus,
but things were kept as simple as possible. Readers should take the opportunity to
brush up their calculus knowledge. Experts should go over to section 3.

2.1 The Model
The simplest standard “SIR” model of epidemics (e.g. [4] and easily retrievable
in the wikipedia [12]) deals with three variables
1. Susceptible (S),
2. Infectious (I), and
3. Removed (R).
The Removed cannot infect anybody anymore, being either dead or immune. This
is the viewpoint of bacteria of viruses. The difference between death and immunity of subjects is totally irrelevant for them: they cannot proliferate anymore in
both cases. The SIR model cannot say anything about death rates of persons.
The Susceptible are not yet infected and not immune, while the Infectious can
infect Susceptibles. The three classes S, I, and R are disjoint and add up to a
fixed total population count N = S + I + R. All of these are ideally assumed to be
smooth functions of time t, and satisfy the differential equations
S
I,
N
S
I˙ = +β I − γ I,
N
Ṙ = γ I.
Ṡ = −β

(1)

where the dot stands for the time derivative, and where β and γ are positive parameters. The product NS I models the probability that an Infectious meets a Susceptible. Note that the Removed of the SIR model are not the Recovered of the
Johns Hopkins data that we treat later, and the SIR model does not account for the
Confirmed counted there.
Since Ṅ = Ṡ + I˙ + Ṙ = 0, the equation N = S + I + R is kept valid at all times.
The term β NS I moves Susceptibles to Infectious, while γ I moves Infectious to
Removed. Thus β represents an infection rate while the removal rate γ accounts

2 CLASSICAL SIR MODELING

for either healing or fatality after infection, i.e. immunity. Political decisions
about reducing contact probabilities will affect β , while γ resembles the balance
between the medical aggressivity of the infection and the quality of the health care
system.
As long as the Infectious I are positive, the Susceptibles S are decreasing, while
the Removed R are increasing. Excluding the trivial case of zero Infectious from
now on, the Removed and the Susceptible will be strictly monotonic.
Qualitatively, the system is not really dependent on N, because one can multiply
N, R, I, and S by arbitrary factors without changing the system. As an aside, one
can also go over to relative quantities with the two differential equations

2.2 Conditions for Outbreaks
We start by looking at the initial conditions. Since everything is invariant under
an additive time shift, we can start at time 0 and consider
˙ = +β S(0) I(0) − γ I(0)

(3)

There is no outbreak in this case, because there are not enough Susceptibles at
start time. The case S(0) = N means that there is no infection at all, and we ignore
it, though it is a solution to the system, with I = R = 0, S = N throughout.

2.3 The Peak
If there is a time instance tI (maybe tI = 0 above) where the Infectious are positive
and do not change, we have
˙ I ) = β S(tI ) I(ti) − γ I(tI ),
0 = I(t
N
S(tI )
γ = β
≤ β.
N

(4)

If β < γ holds, this situation cannot occur, and I must be decreasing all the time,
i.e. the infection dies out. This is what everybody wants. There is no outbreak.
In case of γ = β we go back to the initial situation of the previous section and see
that there is no outbreak due to S(0)/N < 1 if there is an infection at all.
The interesting case is β > γ . Then the first part of (3) shows that as soon as t is
larger than the peak time tI , the Infectious will decrease due to (4). Therefore the
zero of I˙ must be a maximum, i.e. a peak, and it is unique. The Infectious go to
zero even in the peak situation.

2 CLASSICAL SIR MODELING

6

It is one of the most important practical problems in the beginning of an epidemic
to predict
• whether there will be a peak at all,
• when the possible peak will come, and
• how many Infectious will be at the peak.
This can be answered if one has good estimates for β and γ , and we shall deal
with this problem in the major part of this paper,
In real life it is highly important to avoid the peak situation, and this can only be
done by administrative measures that change β and γ to the situation β < γ . This
is what management of epidemics is all about, provided that an epidemic follows
the SIR model. We shall see how countries perform.

2.4 Basic Reproduction Number
The quotient
R0 :=

β
γ

is called the basic reproduction number. If it is not larger than one, there is no
outbreak, whatever the initial conditions are. If it is larger than one, there is an
outbreak provided that
S(0)
γ
1
1>
(5)
> =
N
β
R0
holds. In that case, there is a time tI where I reaches a maximum, and (4) holds
there. When we discuss an outbreak in what follows, we always assume R0 > 1
and (5). If we later let R0 tend to 1 from above, we also require that S(0) tends to
N from below, in order to stay in the outbreak situation.
Both β and γ change under a change of time scale, but the basic reproduction
number is invariant. Physically, β and γ have the dimension time−1, but R0 = β /γ
is dimensionless.

Figure 2: Some other typical SIR system solutions

2.5 Examples
Figure 1 shows a series of test runs with S(0) = N · 0.999 and R(0) = 0 with fixed
γ = 0.1 and β varying from 0.02 to 0.3, such that R0 varies from 1/5 to 3. Due to
the realistically small I(0) being 0.001% of the population, one cannot see the decaying cases near startup, but the tails of the blue I curves are decaying examples
S(t)
by starting value, due to N < βγ = 1/R0 when started at time t. Decreasing R0
flattens the blue curves for I. One can observe that I always dies out, while S and
R tend to fixed positive levels. We shall prove this below. From the system,
one
..
˙
can also infer that R has an inflection point where I has its maximum, since R= γ I.
If only R would be observable, one could locate the peak of I via the inflection
point of R.
Figure 2 shows an artifical case with a large starting value I(0) = N/2, fixed
γ = 0.1 and β varying from 0.005 to 0.3, letting R0 vary from 0.05 to 3. In contrast
to Figure 1, this example shows cases with small R0 properly. The essence is that
the Infectious go down, whether they have a peak or not, and there will always be
a portion of Susceptibles. Again, we shall prove this below.

2 CLASSICAL SIR MODELING

2.6 Herd Immunity Threshold
This is a number related to the Basic Reproduction Number R0 by
HIT = 1 −

1
R0

following a special scenario. If a population is threatened by an infection with
Basic Reproduction Number R0 , what is the number of immune persons needed
to prevent an outbreak right from the start? We can read this off equation (2) in
the ideal situation that I(0) = 0 and S(0) + R(0) = N, namely
S(0)
R(0) γ
1
= 1−
= =

N

implying
R(0)

N
R0
as the threshold between outbreak and decay. This does not refer to a whole
epidemic scenario, nor to an epidemic outbreak. It is a condition to be checked
before anything happens, and useless within a developing epidemic, whatever the
media say.
In the peak situation of (4), the fraction
1
R(tI ) + I(tI ) N − S(tI )
=
= 1−
N
N
R0
of the Non-Susceptible at the peak tI of I is exactly the Herd Immunity Threshold.
Thus it is correct to say that if the Immune of a population are below the Herd Immunity Threshold at startup, and if the Basic Reproduction Number is larger than
one, the sum of the Immune and the Infectious will rise up to the Herd Immunity
Threshold and then the Infectious will decay. This is often stated imprecisely in
the media.
Furthermore, the Herd Immunity Threshold has nothing to do with the important
long-term ratio of Susceptibles to Removed. We shall address this ratio in section
2.11.

2 CLASSICAL SIR MODELING

2.7 Locating the Peak
The most interesting questions during an outbreak with R0 > 1 are
• At which time tI will we reach the maximum of the Infectious, and
• what is I(tI ), i.e. how many people will maximally be infectious at that
time?
It will turn out that there are no easy direct answers. From (4) we see that at the
maximum of I the Susceptibles S have the value

γ
1
S(tI )
= ,
=
β
N
R0
i.e. the portion 1/R0 of the population is susceptible. From that time on, the
Infectious decrease. In terms of R and I, the value
R(tI ) + I(tI )
1
= 1−
N
R0
of the Non-Susceptibles marks the peak of the Infectious at the Herd Immunity
Threshold. “Flattening the curve”, as often mentioned in the media, is intended
to mean making the maximum of I smaller, but this is not exactly what happens,
since the maximum is described by the penultimate equation concerning the Susceptibles, while for I(tI ) we only know
I(tI ) R(tI ) + I(tI )
1
≤
= 1−
N
N
R0

(6)

yielding that the left-hand side gets smaller if R0 gets closer to one. Politically,
this requires either making β smaller via reducing contact probabilities or making
γ larger by improving the health system, or both. Anyway, “flattening the curve”
works by letting R0 tend to 1 from above, but the basic reproduction number does
not directly determine the time tI of the maximum or the value there. We shall
improve the above analysis in section 2.13.

2.8 Analyzing the Outbreak
In the beginning of the outbreak, S/N is near to one, and therefore
I˙ ≈ +β I − γ I

2 CLASSICAL SIR MODELING

10

models an exponential outbreak with exponent β − γ > 0, with a solution
I(t) ≈ I(t0) exp((β − γ )t).
If this is done in discrete time steps ∆t, one has
I(t + ∆t)
≈ exp((β − γ )∆t).
I(t)
The severity of the outbreak is not controlled by R0 = β /γ , but rather via β − γ .
Publishing single values I(t) does not give any information about β − γ . Better is
the ratio of two subsequent values
I(t2)
≈ exp((β − γ )(t2 − t1 )),
I(t1)
and if this gets smaller over time, the outbreak gets less dramatic because β − γ
gets smaller. Really useful information about an outbreak does not consist of
values and not of increments, but of increments of increments, i.e. some second
derivative information. This is what the media rarely provided during the outbreak.

2.9 Doubling Time
Another information used by media during the outbreak is the doubling time, i.e.
how many days it takes until daily values double. This is the number n in
2=

I(t + n∆t)
≈ exp((β − γ )n∆t) = (exp((β − γ )∆t)n
I(t)

or
n=

log 2
,
(β − γ )∆t

i.e. it is inversely proportional to β − γ . If political action doubles the “doubling
time”, if halves β − γ . If politicians do this repeatedly, they never reach β < γ ,
and they never escape an exponential outbreak if they do this any finite number of
times. Extending the doubling time will never prevent a peak, it only postpones
it and hopefully flattens it. When presenting a “doubling time”, media should
always point out that this makes only sense during an exponential outbreak. And
it is not related to the basic reproduction number R0 = β /γ , but rather to the
difference β − γ .

2 CLASSICAL SIR MODELING

11

2.10 Spread of Infections
Media often say that the basic reproduction number R0 gives the number of persons an average Infectious infects while being infectious. This is a rather mystical
statement that needs underpinning. The quantity
I
1
=
γ Ṙ
is a value that has the physical dimension of time. It describes the ratio between
current Infectious and current newly Removed, and thus can be seen as the average
time needed for an Infectious to get Removed, i.e. it is the average time that an
Infectious can infect others. Correspondingly,
S
I˙ + γ I = I˙ + Ṙ = β I
N
are the newly Infected, and therefore
I
1N
=
β S
I˙ + Ṙ
can be seen as the time it needs for an average Infectious to generate a new Infectious. The ratio βγ NS then gives how many new Infectious can be generated by
an Infectious while being infected, but this is only close to R0 if S ≈ N, i.e. at
the start of an outbreak. A correct statement is that R0 is the average number of
infections an Infectious generates while being infectious, but within an unlimited
supply of Susceptibles.

2.11 Long-term Behavior
Besides the peak in case R0 > 1, it is interesting to know the portions of the population that get either removed (by death or immunity) or get never in contact to the
infection. This concerns the long-term behavior of the Removed and the Susceptibles. Figures 1 and 2 demonstrate how R and S level out under all circumstances
shown, but is this always true, and what is the final ratio?
If we are at a time tD behind the possible peak at tI , or in a decay situation enforced
by starting value, like in (2), we know that I must decrease exponentially to zero.
This follows from
S(t)
S(tD )
I˙

(log I). = = β

2 CLASSICAL SIR MODELING

showing that log I must decrease linearly, or I must decrease exponentially. Thus
we get rid of the Infectious in the long run, keeping only Susceptibles and Removed. Surprisingly, this happens independent of how large R0 is.

when assuming R(0) = 0 at startup. Since ρ is increasing, it has a limit 0 < ρ∞ ≤ 1

holds, together with the condition ρ∞ + σ (ρ∞ ) = 1, because there are no more

σ (0) exp − ρ∞ = 1 − ρ∞
γ
has a unique solution in (0, 1) dependent on σ (0) < 1 and R0 = β /γ . See Figure
3 for illustration. The right-hand side 1 − ρ∞ of the equation is the fixed blue
line, while the green curves are the left-hand side for varying values of R0 = β /γ .
The intersection points are the values ρ∞ of ρ that solve the equation. Looking at
both sides of the equation as functions of ρ∞ , an increase of R0 = β /γ for fixed
S(0) < 1 lets the intersection point move towards 1 on the ρ axis.
Qualitatively, we can use (8) or (9) in the form
R0 =

to see that the ratio of Removed to Susceptibles increases with R0 , but there is a
logarithm involved.
All of this has some serious implications, if the model is correct for an epidemic
situation. First, the Infectious always go to zero, but Susceptibles always remain.
This means that a new infection can always arise whenever some infected person
enters the sanitized population. The outbreak risk is dependent on the portion
σ∞ = 1 − ρ∞ of the Susceptibles. This illustrates the importance of vaccination,
e.g. against measles or influenza.
The above analysis shows that large values of R0 lead to large relative values of
Removed to Susceptible in the limit. The consequence is that systems with large
R0 have a dramatic outbreak and lead to a large portion of Removed. This is good
news in case that the rate of fatalities within the Removed is low, but very bad
news otherwise.
When politicians try to “flatten the curve” by bringing R0 below 1 from some
time on, this will automatically decrease the asymptotic rate of Removed and
increase the asymptotic rate of Susceptibles in the population. This is particularly
important if the rate of fatalities within the Removed is high, but by the previous
argument the risk of re-infection rises due to the larger portion of Susceptibles.
The decay situation (7) implies that

σ∞ =

1
S(∞) γ
≤ =

and consequently

R0
Therefore the final rate of the Removed is not smaller than the Herd Immunity
Threshold. This is good news for possible re-infections, but only if the death rate
among the Removed is small enough.

ρ∞ = 1 − σ∞ ≥ 1 −

2.12 Asymptotic Exponential Decay
In a decay situation like in (7), we get
I(tD) exp(−(γ − β σ∞ )(t − tD )) ≤ I(t) ≤ I(tD) exp(−(γ − β σ (tD ))(t − tD ))

counteracts. The bell shapes of the peaked I curves are not symmetric with respect
to the peak.

Figure 4 shows the behaviour of the function, and this is what “flattening the
curve” is all about. A value of R0 = 4 gets a maximum of more than 40% of the
population infectious at a single time. If 5% need hospital care, this implies that a
country needs hospital beds for 2% of the population. The dotted line leaves the
log term out, i.e. is marks the rate of the Susceptibles at the peak, and by (6) the
difference is the rate R(tI )/N of the Recovered at the peak.

ds =
ds = ρ (∞)
N
γ 0 N
γ

assuming R(0) = 0, and set it equal to an integral over the constant value at the
maximum, i.e. we squeeze the area under the curve into a rectangle of length b −a
under the maximal value, i.e.
I(tI )

This implies

and if we “flatten the curve” by letting R0 tend to 1 from above, we see that the
length b − a of the above rectangle goes to infinity like R0 /(1 − R0 ), because ρ∞
tends to 1.
If there is no peak, e.g. if R0 = β /γ is below 1 either at the beginning or after
some political intervention, one can repeat the above argument starting with the
Infectious at some time t looking at the area under I from t to infinity:

written as

dI

and in a new time variable τ with d τ = NI dt, one gets the system

for σ = S/N and ρ = R/N as functions of the new infection timescale τ that one
can fix as
Z t
I(s)
ds
τ (t) =
0 N
to make sure that τ (0) = 0. This implies

σ (τ ) = σ (0) exp(−β τ ),
ρ (τ ) = ρ (0) + γτ .
The beauty of this is that the roles of β and γ are perfectly split, like the roles of σ
and ρ . In the new timescale, ρ increases linearly and σ decreases exponentially.
The Basic Reproduction Number then describes the fixed ratio

and we shall use this in section 3.3. The validity of a SIR model can be tested by
checking whether the right-hand sides for β , γ and R0 are roughly constant. If data
are sampled locally, e.g. before or after a peak, the above technique should determine the parameters for the global epidemic, i.e. be useful for either prediction or
backward testing.
However, in pandemics like COVID-19, the parameters β and γ change over time
by administrative action. This means that they should be considered as functions in the above equations, and then their changes may be used for conclusions
about the influence of such actions. This is intended when media say that “R0 has
changed”. From this viewpoint, one can go back to the SIR model and consider β
and γ as “control functions” that just describe the relation between the variables.
But the main argument against using (11) is that the data are hardly available. This
is the concern of the next section.

3 USING AVAILABLE DATA

3 Using Available Data
Now we want to confront the modelling of the previous section with available
data. This is crucial for maneuvering countries through the epidemics [13]2 .

3.1 Johns Hopkins Data
In this text, we work with the COVID-19 data from the CSSEGISandData repository of the Johns Hopkins University [7]. They are the only source that provides
comparable data on a worldwide scale.
The numbers there are
1. Confirmed (C) or cumulative infected
2. Dead (D), and
3. Recovered (R)
as cumulative integer valued time series in days from Jan. 22nd, 2020. All these
values are absolute numbers, not relative to a total population. Note that the unconfirmed cases are not accessible at all, while the Confirmed contain the Dead
and the Recovered of earlier days.
At this point, we do not question the integrity of the data, but there are many wellknown flaws. In particular, the values for specific days are partly belonging to
previous days, due to delays in the chains of data transmission in different countries. This is why, at some points, we shall apply some conservative smoothing
of the data. Finally, there are inconsistencies that possibly need data changes.
For an example, consider that usually COVID-19 cases lead to recovery or death
within a rather fixed period, e.g. k ≈ 15 − 21 days. But some Johns Hopkins data
have less new Infectioned at day n than the sum of Recovered and Dead at day
n + k. And, there are countries like Germany who deliver data of Recovered in a
very questionable way. The law in Germany did not enforce authorities to collect
data of Recovered, and the United Kingdom did not report numbers of Dead and
Recovered from places outside the National Health System, e.g. from Senior’s
retirement homes. Both strategies have changed somewhat in the meantime, as of
early May, but the data still keep these flaws.

3 USING AVAILABLE DATA

20

We might assume that the Dead plus the Recovered of the Johns Hopkins data are
the Removed of the SIR model, and that the Infectious I = C − R − D of the Johns
Hopkins data are the Infectious of the SIR model. But this is not strictly valid,
because registration or confirmation come in the way.
On the other hand, one can take the radical viewpoint that facts are not interesting
if they do not show up in the Johns Hopkins data. Except for the United Kingdom,
the important figures concern COVID-19 casualties that are actually registered as
such, others do not count, and serious cases needing hospitalization or leading to
death should not go unregistered. If they do in certain countries, using such data
will not be of any help, unless other data sources are available. If SIR modelling
does not work for the Johns Hopkins data, it is time to modify the SIR technique
appropriately, and this will be tried in this section.
An important point for what follows is that the data come as daily values. To
make this compatible with differential equations, we shall replace derivatives by
differences.

3.2 Examples
To get a first impression about the Johns Hopkins data, Figure 5 shows raw data up
to day 109 (May 10th , as of this writing). The presentation is logarithmic, because
then linearly increasing or decreasing parts correspond to exponentially increasing
or decreasing numbers in the real data. Many presentations in the media are nonlogarithmic, and then all exponential outbreaks look similar. The real interesting
data are the Infectious I = C − R − D in black that show a peak or not. The other
curves are cumulative. The data for other countries tell similar stories and are
suppressed.
The media, in particular German TV, present COVID-19 data in a rather debatable
way. When mentioning Johns Hopkins data, they provide C, D, and R separately
without stating the most important figures, namely I = C − D − R, their change,
and the change of their change. When mentioning data of the Infectious from
the Robert Koch institute alongside, they do not say precisely that these are noncumulative and should be compared to the I = C −R−D data of the Johns Hopkins
University. And, in most cases during the outbreak, they did not mention the
change of the change. Quite like all other media.

3 USING AVAILABLE DATA

21

One can see in Figure 5 that Germany and South Korea have passed the peak of
the Infectious, while France is roughly at the peak and the United States are still
in an exponential outbreak. The early figures, below day 40, are rather useless,
but then an exponential outbreak is visible in all cases. This outbreak changes its
slope due to political actions, and we shall analyze this later. See [3] for a detailed
early analysis of slope changes.
There are strange anomalies in the Recovered (green). France seems not to have
delivered any data between days 40 and 58, Germany changed the data delivery
policy between days 62 and 63, and the UK data for the Recovered are a mess.
It should be noted that the available medical results on the COVID-19 disease
often state that Confirmed will die or survive after a more or less fixed number of
days, roughly 14 to 21. This would imply that the red curves for the Dead and
the green curves for the Recovered should roughly follow the blue curves for the
Confirmed with a fixed but measurable delay. This is partially observable, but
much less accurately for the Recovered.

3.3 The Johns Hopkins Data Model
The idea is to define a model that works exclusively with the Johns Hopkins data,
but comes close to a SIR model, without being able to use S. Since the SIR model
does not distinguish between recoveries and deaths, we set
RSIR ⇔ DJH + RJH
and let the Infectious be comparable, i.e.
ISIR ⇔ IJH := CJH − DJH − RJH
which implies
(I + R)SIR ⇔ CJH ,
and we completely omit the Susceptibles. From now on, we shall omit the subscript JH when we use the Johns Hopkins data, but we shall use SIR when we go
back to the SIR model.

defining time series γn and bn that model γ and b = β · SSIR/N without knowing

In+1 − In = bn In − γn In ,
(R + D)n+1 − (R + D)n − = γn In
that maintains C = I + R + D, and we may call it a Johns Hopkins Data Model. It
is very close to a SIR model if the time series bn is not considered to be constant,
but just an approximation of β · SSIR/N.

Then there is a rather simple observation:
If rn is smaller than one, the Infectious decrease.
It follows from
Cn+1 −Cn = rn (Rn+1 + Dn+1 − Rn − Dn )
In+1 − In + Rn+1 − Rn + Dn+1 − Dn = rn (Rn+1 + Dn+1 − Rn − Dn )
In+1 − In = −(1 − rn )(Rn+1 − Rn + Dn+1 − Dn ),

3 USING AVAILABLE DATA

24

but this is visible in the data anyway and not of much help.
SIR
Since rn models R0 SN
, it always underestimates R0 . This underestimation gets
dramatic when it must be assumed that SSIR gets seriously smaller than N.

At this point, it is not intended to forecast the epidemics. The focus is on extracting
parameters from the Johns Hopkins data that relate to a background SIR-type
model.
3.3.2 Example
Figure 6 shows R0 SSIR
N estimates via rn for the last four weeks before day 109,
th
i.e. March 10 . Except for the United States, all countries were more or less
successful in pressing R0 below one. In all cases, SSIR /N is too close to one to
have any influence. The variation in rn is not due to the decrease in SSIR /N, but
should rather be attributed to political action. As mentioned above, the estimates
for R0 by rn are always too optimistic.
For the figure, the raw Johns Hopkins data were smoothed by a double action of
a 1/4, 1/2, 1/4 filter on the logarithms of the data. This smoother keeps constants
and linear sections of the logarithm invariant, i.e. it does not change local exponential behavior. This smoothing was not applied to Figure 5. It was by far not
strong enough to eliminate the apparent 7-day oscillations that are frequently in
the Johns Hopkins data, see the figure. Data from the Robert Koch Institute in
Germany have even stronger 7-day variations.
3.3.3 Properties of the Model
As long as rn is roughly constant, the above approach will always model an exponential outbreak or decay, but never a peak, because the difference equations are
linear. It can only help the user to tell if there is a peak ahead or behind, depending
on rn ≈ R0 being larger or smaller than 1. If rn is kept below one, the Confirmed
Infectious will not increase, causing no new threats to the health system. Then the
S/N factor will not decrease substantially, and a full SIR model is not necessary.
On the other hand, if a country manages to keep rn smaller than some r =
it is clear that it takes

steps to bring the Confirmed Infectious down to 1, if we assume b and γ to be
constant. Making R0 ≈ bγ < 1 small is not the best strategy. Instead, one should
maximize γ − b.
As long as countries keep the rn clearly below one, e.g. below 1/2, this would
N
stays below one if SSIR ≥ N/2, i.e. as long as the majority
mean that R0 ≈ rn SSIR
of the population has not been in contact with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This is good
news. But observing a small rn can conceal a situation with a large R0 if SSIR /N
is small. This is one reason why countries need to get a grip on the Susceptibles
nationwide.
It is tempting to use the above technique for prediction in such a way that the
bn and the γn are fitted to a constant or a linear function, and using the values
of the fit for running the system into the future. This is very close to extending
the logarithmic plots of Figure 5 by lines, using pencil and ruler, and thus hardly
interesting.
So far, the above argument cannot replace a SIR model. It only interprets the
available data. However, monitoring the Johns Hopkins data in the above way
will be very useful when it comes to evaluate the effectivity of certain measures
taken by politicians. It will be highly interesting to see how the data of Figure 6
continue, in particular when countries relax their contact restrictions.

3.4 Extension Towards a SIR Model
For cases where one still has to expect R0 > 1, e.g. UK, US and Sweden around
day 90 (see Figure 6), the challenge remains to predict a possible peak. Using the
estimates from the previous section is questionable, because they concern the subpopulation of Confirmed and are systematically underestimating R0 . The “real”
SIR model will have different parameters, and it needs the Susceptibles to model
a peak or to make the rn estimates realistic. So far, the Johns Hopkins data work
in a range where S/N is still close to one, and the Susceptibles are considered to
be abundant. But the bad news for countries with rn > 1 is that rn underestimates
R0 .
Anyway, if one trusts the above time series as approximations to β and γ , one
can run a SIR model, provided one is in the case R0 > 1 and has reasonable starting values. But these are a problem, because the unconfirmed Infectious and the

4 EXTENDED SIR MODEL

27

unconfirmed Recovered are not known, even if, for simplicity, one assumes that
there are no unconfirmed COVID-19 deaths.
For an unrealistic scenario, consider Total Registration, i.e. all Infected are automatically confirmed. Then the Susceptibles in the Johns Hopkins model would be
Sn = N −Cn = N − In − Rn − Dn . Now the estimate for R0 must be corrected to

but this change will not be serious during the outbreak.

If the time series βn = bn SNn = bn N−C

tors for β and γ in a SIR model, and if the model is started using Sn = N −Cn =

one gets a crude prediction of the peak in case R0 = β /γ > 1.
Figure 7 shows results for two cases. The top shows the case for the United States
using data from day 109 (May 10th ) and estimating β and γ from the data one
week before. The peak is predicted at day 472 with a total rate of 33% Infectious.
To see how crude the technique is, the second plot shows the case of Germany
using data up to day 75, i.e. before the peak, and the peak is predicted at day 230
with about 16% Infected. At day 75, R0 was estimated at 2.01, but a few days
later the estimate went below 1 (Figure 6) by political intervention changing bn
considerably. See Figure 12 for a much better prediction using data only up to day
67.

4 Extended SIR Model
To get closer to what actually happens, one should combine the data-oriented
Johns Hopkins Data Model with a SIR model that accounts for what happens
outside of the Confirmed. We introduce the time series

29

S for the Susceptibles like in the SIR model,
M for the Infectious, not yet confirmed, (M standing for mysterious),
H for the unconfirmed Recovered (H standing for healed).
This implies that all deaths occur within the Confirmed, though this is a highly
debatable issue. It assumes that persons with serious symptoms get confirmed,
and nobody dies of COVID-19 without prior confirmation.

4.1 The Hidden Model
The Removed from the viewpoint of a global SIR model including H and M are
H +C, and thus the SIR model is
Sn
Sn+1 − Sn = −β Mn ,
N
Sn
Mn+1 − Mn = β Mn − γ Mn ,
N
(H +C)n+1 − (H +C)n = γ Mn .

(13)

To run this hidden model with constant N = S + M + H + C, one needs initial
values and good estimates for β and γ , which are not the ones of the Johns Hopkins
Data Model of section 3.3.

4.2 The Observable Model
The Johns Hopkins variables D and R are linked to the hidden model via C =
I − R − D. They follow an observable model
In = Cn − Rn − Dn ,
Dn+1 − Dn = γiCD In ,
Rn+1 − Rn = γiCR In

(14)

with instantaneous case death and recovery rates γiCD and γiCR for the Confirmed
Infectious. These rates can be estimated separately from the available Johns Hopkins data, and we shall do this below. We call thes rates instantaneous, because
they artificially attribute the new deaths or recoveries at day n + 1 to the previous day, not to earlier days. In this sense, they are rather artificial, and we shall
address this question. They are case rates, because they concern the Confirmed.

4 EXTENDED SIR MODEL

30

The observable model is coupled to the hidden model only by Cn . Any datadriven Cn from the observable model can be used to enter the H + C variable of
the hidden model, but in an unknown ratio. Conversely, any version of the hidden
model produces H + C values that do not determine the C part. Summarizing,
there is no way to fit the hidden model to the data without additional assumptions.
Various possibilites were tried to connect the Hidden to the Observable. Two will
be presented now.

4.3 Infection Fatality Rates and the k-Day Rule
Recall that the parameter γiCD in the observable model (14) relates case fatalities
to the confirmed Infectious of the previous day. In contrast to this, the infection
fatality rate in the standard literature, denoted by γIF here, is relating to the infection directly, independent of the confirmation, and gives the probability to die
of COVID-19 after infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. It is γIF = 0.56% by
[1] and 0.66% by [11], but specialized for China. Recent data from the Heinsberg
study by Streeck et. al. [10] gives a value of 0.37% for the Heinsberg population
in Germany. The idea to use the infection fatality rate for information about the
hidden system comes from [2]. The way to use it will depend on how to handle
delays, and it turned out to be difficult to use these rates in a stable way.
Let us focus on probabilities to die either after an infection or after confirmation
of an infection. The first is the infection fatality rate given in the literature, but
what is the comparable case fatality rate γCF when using the Johns Hopkins data?
It is clearly not the γiCD in (14), giving the ratio of new deaths at day n + 1 as a
fraction of the confirmed Infectious at day n. It makes much more sense to use the
fact that COVID-19 diseases end after k days from confirmation with either death
or recovery. Let us call this the k-day rule. Suggested values for k range between
14 and 21.
4.3.1 Estimation of Case Fatality Rates
Following [9], one can estimate the probability pi to die on day i after confirmation, and this works in a stable way per country, based only on C and D, not on
the unstable R data. In [9] this approach was used to produce R values that comply with the k-day rule, but here we use it for estimating the case fatality. The

4 EXTENDED SIR MODEL

31

technique of [9] performs a fit
k

Dn − Dn−1 ≈

∑

qi (Cn−i −Cn−i−1 ),
i=1
i−1

(15)

qi = pi ∏ (1 − p j ), 1 ≤ i ≤ k + 1
j=0

i.e. it assigns all new deaths at day n to previous new infections on previous days
in a hopefully consistent way, minimizing the error in the above formula under
variation of the probabilities pi . If the pi are known for days 1 to k, the case
fatality rate is
k

γCF = ∑ qi = 1 − qk+1 .
i=1

This argument can also be seen the other way round: the new Confirmed Cn −Cn−1
at day 1 enter into Dn+1 − Dn with probability q1 = p1 , into Dn+2 − Dn+1 with
probability q2 = p2 (1 − p1 ) and so on. The rest enters into the new Recovered at
day n + k with probability qk+1 if we set pk+1 = 0. Thus the case fatality rate can
be expressed as 1 − qk+1 like above.
At this point, there is a hidden assumption. Persons that are new to the Confirmed
at day n are not dead and not recovered. The change Cn+1 −Cn to the Confirmed
is therefore understood as the number of new registered infections. Otherwise,
one might replace Cn−i −Cn−i−1 by In−i − In−i−1 in (15), but this would connect
a cumulative function to a non-cumulative function. Furthermore, this would use
the unsafe data of the Recovered.
In fact, equation (15) is unexpectedly reliable, provided one looks at the sum of the
probabilities pi . This follows from series of experiments that we do not document
fully here, In [9], data for 2k days backwards were used for the estimation, and
results did not change much when more or less data were used or when k was
modified. Here, the range 7 ≤ k ≤ 21 was tested, and backlogs of up to 50 days
from day 109 (as of this writing). See Figure 8 below for an example. Larger
k lead to somewhat larger fatality rates, because the method has more leeway to
assign deaths to confirmations, but the increase is rather small when k is increased
beyond 14. It is remarkable that k = 7 suffices for a rather good fit for US, UK,
Sweden, and Italy. In contrast to other countries, this means that 7 days after
confirmation are enough to assign deaths consistently to previous confirmations,
indicating that a large portion of confirmations concern rather serious cases.

and the data backlog

In general, the fit gets better when the backlog is not too large, avoiding use of
outdated data, and the resulting rate does not change much when backlogs are
shortened. Roughly, the rule of a backlog of 2k days works well, together with k =
21 to allow enough leeway to ensure a small fitting error. Note that all variations
of k and the backlog data have a rather small effect on the sum of the pi , while the
pi will vary strongly.
See the first column of Table 1 for estimates of case fatality rates for different
countries, calculated on day 109 (May 10th ). These depend strongly on the strategy for confirmation. In particular, they are high when only serious cases are
confirmed, e.g. cases that need hospital care. If many more people are tested,
confirmations will contain plenty of much less serious cases, and then the case
fatality rates are low. The values were entered manually after inspection of a plot
of the rates as functions of k and the backlog. See Figure 8 for how the value
0.143 for Italy was determined.

that is entering confirmation. See the second column of Table 1. Note that all
of this is dependent on good estimates of the infection fatality rate, and the new
value by [10] will roughly double the detection rate for Germany.

All of this is comparable to the findings of [2] and uses the basic idea from there,
but is executed with a somewhat different technique.
IF
A simple way to understand the quotient γγCF
as a detection rate is to ask for the
probability p(C) for Confirmation. If the probability to die after Confirmation is
γCF , and if there are no deaths outside confirmation, then

p(D) = p(C) · p(D|C),
and
p(C) =

γIF
p(D)
.
=
p(D|C) γCF

It is tempting to replace S by M in (17), but this would make M cumulative.
4.3.4 Local Estimation of Fatality Rates
Under political changes of the parameters β and γ , the estimation of the Case
Fatality Rate should be made locally, not globally. Using the experience of [9]
and section 4.3.1, we shall do this using a fixed k = 21 for the k-day rule and data
for a fixed backlog of 2k days.

4.4 Recovery Rates
We need another parameter to make the model work. There are many choices, and
after some failures we selected the constant γiIR in a model equation
Hn+1 − Hn = γiIR Mn .
Following what was mentioned about instantaneous rates in section 4.2, this is an
instantaneous Infection Recovery Rate, relating the new unregistered Recovered
to the unregistered Infections the day before.

4.4.1 Estimation of Recovery Rates
A good value of γiIR can come out of an experiment that produces a time series
for M and H, i.e. for unregistered Infectious and unregistered Recovered. Then
the instantaneous Infection Recovery rate γiIR can be obtained directly by
Hn+1 − Hn
≈ γiIR .
Mn
The Infection Recovery rate γIR = 1 − γIF does not help much, because we need
an instantaneous rate that has no interpretation as a probability.
Without additional input, we can look at the instantaneous Case Recovery rate
Rn+1 − Rn
≈ γiCR
In

(18)

that is available from the Johns Hopkins data, and comes out experimentally to
be rather stable. The rate γiIR must be larger, because we now are not in the
subpopulation of the Confirmed, and nobody can die without going first into the
population of the Confirmed. As long as no better data are available, we use the
formula
1 − γIF
γIR
γiCR
γiIR =
γiCR =
γiCR =
γIR
(19)
1 − γCF
γCR
γCR
that accounts for two things:
1. the value γiCR is increased by the ratio of Recovered probabilities for the
Infected and the Confirmed,
2. the value γIR is multiplied by a factor for transition to immediate rates, and
this factor is the transition factor for the Confirmed Recovered.
The above strategy is debatable and may be the weakest point of this approach.
However, others turned out to be worse, mainly due to instability of results. Furthermore, the final prediction does not need it. It enters only in the intermediate
step when S, M, and H are calculated in the time range of the available Johns Hopkins data, see section 4.5. And, finally, there is hope that there will be medical
experiments that yield reliable values directly.

4 EXTENDED SIR MODEL

4.4.2 Practical Approximation of Recovery Rates
In (19) the rate γIR is fixed, and the rate γCR is determined locally via section 4.3.4.
The rate γiCR follows from the time series
Rn+1 − Rn
≈ γiCR
In
as in (14). This works for countries that provide useful data for the Recovered. In
that case, and in others to follow below, we can take the time series itself as long
as we have data. For prediction, we estimate the constant from the time series
using a fixed backlog of m days from the current day. Since many data have a
weekly oscillation, due to data being not properly delivered during weekends, the
backlog should not be less than 7.
But for certain countries, like the United Kingdom, the data for the Recovered are
useless. In such cases, we employ the technique of [9] to estimate the Recovered
using the k-day rule and a backlog of 2k days, like in section 4.3.4 for the case
fatality rates.

4.5 Model Completion
We now have everything to run the hidden model, but we do it first for days that
have available Johns Hopkins data. This leads to estimations of S, M, and H from
the observed data of the Johns Hopkins source. With the parameters from above,
we use the new relations

γIF
(Sn − Sn+1 ),
γCF
= γiIR Mn .

Cn+1 −Cn =
Hn+1 − Hn

(20)

The first equation is a priori and determines S. One could run it over the whole
range of available data, if the parameter γCF were fixed, like γCI . But since we
estimate it via section 4.3 that resulted in Table 1, we should use section 4.3.4 to
calculate γCF locally.
The second is a posteriori and lets H follow from M, but we postpone it. The third
model equation in (13) will be handled defining γn by brute force via

γn Mn = Cn+1 −Cn + Hn+1 − Hn .

(21)

4 EXTENDED SIR MODEL

37

We then set up the second model equation for M as
Mn+1 − Mn = Sn − Sn+1 − γn Mn
γCF
=
(Cn+1 −Cn ) − γn Mn
γIF
γCF
(Cn+1 −Cn ) − (Cn+1 −Cn + Hn+1 − Hn )
=
γIF


γCF
=
− 1 (Cn+1 −Cn ) − γiIR Mn
γIF

(22)

that can be solved if an initial value is prescribed. The first model equation in (13)
is used to define βn by
Sn − Sn+1 = βn

Sn
Mn .
N

(23)

The model is run by executing (22) for a starting value M̃0 , yielding the Mn . Then
(20) is run to produce the Sn and Hn , with starting values. If βn and γn are calculated by (23) and (21), respectively, the balance equation N = S + M + H + C
follows from (22).
4.5.1 Influence of Starting Values
Since the populations are large, the starting values for S are not important. The
starting value for H is irrelevant for H itself, because only differences enter, but
it determines the starting value for M due to the balance equation. Anyway, it
turns out experimentally that the starting values do not matter, if the model is
started early. The hidden model (13) depends much more strongly on C than on
the starting values. See Figure 12 for an example.
4.5.2 Parameter Estimation
Along with the calculation of S, M, and H, we run the calculation of the time
series βn and γn using (23) and (21). These yield estimates for the parameters
of the full SIR model that replace the earlier time series from the Johns Hopkins
Data Model in section 3.3.
4.5.3 Examples
The figures to follow in section 5.2 show the original Johns Hopkins data together
with the hidden variables S, M, and H that are calculated by the above technique.

5 PREDICTIONS USING THE FULL MODEL

38

Note that the only ingredients beside the Johns Hopkins data are the number k for
the k-day rule, the Infection Fatality Rate γIF from the literature, and the backlog
m for estimation of constants from time series.

5 Predictions using the Full Model
To let the combined model predict the future, or to check what it would have
predicted if used at an earlier day, we take the completed model of the previous
sections up to a day n and use the values Sn , Mn , Hn, Cn , In , Rn and Dn for starting
the prediction. With the variable HC := H +C, we use the recursion
Si
Mi ,
N
Si
Mi + β Mi − γ Mi ,
N
HCi + γ Mi ,
Ci + γIF (Si − Si+1 )/γCF ,
Ri + γiCR Ii ,
Di + γiCD Ii ,
Ci+1 − Ri+1 − Di+1 ,
HCi+1 −Ci+1 .

Si+1 = Si − β
Mi+1 =
HCi+1
Ci+1
Ri+1
Di+1
Ii+1
Hi+1

=
=
=
=
=
=

(24)

This needs fixed values of β and γ that we estimate from the time series for βn
and γn by using a backlog of m days, following Section 4.5.2. The instantaneous
rates γiCR and γiCD can be calculated via their time series, as in (18) and (16),
using the same backlog. We do this at the starting point of the prediction, and
then the model runs in what can be called a no political change mode. Examples
will follow in section 5.2.

5.1 Properties of the Full Model
The first part of the full model (24) runs as a standard SIR model for the variables
S, M and H +C, and inherits the properties of these as described in section 2. It
does not use the γiIR parameter of the second equation in (20), and it uses the first
the other way round, now determining C from S, not S from C.
The balances N = S + M + H +C and C = I + D + R are maintained automatically,
and the time series for S, C, R, and D stay monotonic as long as M and I are

which is enough for practical purposes.

5.2 Examples of Predictions
Figure 9 shows predictions on day 109, May 10th, for Germany, Sweden, US and
UK, from the top. The plots for countries behind their peak are rather similar to
the one for Germany. The other three countries are selected because they still have
to face their peak, if no action is taken to change the parameters. The estimated R0
values are 0.59, 1.37, 3.34, and 1.20, respectively. Note that these are not directly
comparable to Figure 6, because they are the fitted constant to the backlog of a
week, and using (21) and (23) instead of (12). The black and magenta curves are
the estimated M and H values, while the S values are hardly visible on the top.
The hidden M and H in black and magenta follow roughly the observable I and
C in blue and cyan, but with a factor due to the detection rate that is different
between countries, see Table 1.
To evaluate the predictions, one should go back and start the predictions for earlier days, to compare with what happened later. Figure 11 shows overplots of
predictions for days 81, 95, and 109, each a fortnight apart. The starting points of
the predictions are marked by asterisks again. Now each prediction has slightly
different estimates for S, M, and H due to different available data. Recall that the
determination of these variables is done while there are Johns Hopkins data available, following section 4.5, and will be dependent on the data-driven estimations
described there. In particular, the case fatality rates and detection rates of Table 1
change with the starting point of the prediction, and they determine S, M, and H
backwards, see the figure for Sweden.

6 CONCLUSION AND OPEN PROBLEMS

43

All test runs were made for the infection fatality rate γIF = 0.005, the delay k = 21
for estimating case fatalities, and a backlog of 7 days when estimating constants
out of recent values of time series. The choice γIF = 0.005 is somewhat between
0.56% from [1], 0.66% from [11], and 0.37% from [10]. New information on
infection fatality rates should be included as soon as they are available.
The Johns Hopkins data were smoothed by a double application of the 1/4, 1/2,
1/4 filter on the logarithms, like for Figure 6. For UK and Sweden, the data for the
confirmed Recovered R were replaced by the 21-day rule estimation via [9] and a
backlog of 42 days. The original data were too messy to be useful, unfortunately.
For an early case in Germany, Figure 12 shows the prediction based on data of day
67, March 27 th . On the side, the figure contains a wide variation of the starting
value H = N − S − C at the starting point, by multipliers between 1/32 and 32.
This has hardly any effect on the results. The peak of about 20 million Infected
is predicted on day 111, May 12th , with roughly a million Confirmed and about
20000 casualties at the peak and about 100.000 finally. Note that the real death
count is about 7500 on May 11th , and the prediction of the day, in Figure 9, targets
a final count of below 10000. The parameter changes by political measures turned
out to be rather effective, like in many countries that applied similar strategies.
But since parts of the population want to go back to their previous lifestyle, all of
this is endangered, and the figures should be monitored carefully.
Of course, all of this makes sense only under the assumption that reality follows
the model, in spite of all attempts to design a model that follows reality.

6 Conclusion and Open Problems
So far, the model presented here seems to be useful, combining theory and practically available data. It is data-driven to a very large extent, using only the infection
fatality rate from outside for prediction, and the approximation (19) for calibration.
On the downside, there is quite a number of shortcomings:
• Like the data themselves, the model needs regular updating. As far as the
Johns Hopkins data are concerned, the model updates itself by using the

latest data, but it needs changes as soon as new information on the hidden
infections come in.
• There may be better ways of estimating the hidden part of the epidemics.
However, it will be easy to adapt the model to other parameter choices. If
time series for the unknown variables get available, the model can easily be
adapted to being data-driven by the new data.
• The treatment of delays is unsatisfactory. In particular, infected persons get
infected immediately, and the k-day rule is not followed at all places in the
model. But the rule is violated as well in the data [9].
• There is no stochastics involved, except for simple things like estimating
constants by least squares, or for certain probabilistic arguments on the side,
e.g. in section 4.3.1. But it is not at all clear whether there are enough data
to do a proper probabilistic analysis.
• As long as there is no probabilistic analysis, there should be more simulations under perturbations of the data and the parameters. A few were
included, e.g. for section 4.3.1 and Figures 8 and 12, but a large number
was performed in the background when preparing the paper, making sure
that results are stable, but there are never too many test simulations.
• Other models were not considered, e.g. the classical ones with delays [5, 6].
