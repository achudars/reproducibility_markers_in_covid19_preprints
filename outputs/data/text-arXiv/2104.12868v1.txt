Abstract
The pandemic COVID-19 disease has had a dramatic impact on almost all countries around the world
so that many hospitals have been overwhelmed with Covid-19 cases. As medical resources are limited,
deciding on the proper allocation of these resources is a very crucial issue. Besides, uncertainty is a
major factor that can affect decisions, especially in medical fields. To cope with this issue, we use fuzzy
logic (FL) as one of the most suitable methods in modeling systems with high uncertainty and
complexity. We intend to make use of the advantages of FL in decisions on cases that need to treat in
ICU. In this study, an interval type-2 fuzzy expert system is proposed for prediction of ICU admission
in COVID-19 patients. For this prediction task, we also developed an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference
system (ANFIS). Finally, the results of these fuzzy systems are compared to some well-known
classification methods such as Naive Bayes (NB), Case-Based Reasoning (CBR), Decision Tree (DT),
and K Nearest Neighbor (KNN). The results show that the type-2 fuzzy expert system and ANFIS
models perform competitively in terms of accuracy and F-measure compared to the other system
modeling techniques.

1. Introduction
COVID-19 or Coronavirus has affected the public health and economics of many countries in the
world due to its contagious nature and lack of effective medicine or vaccine [1]. It has spread to over
50 million people worldwide by the end of September 2020. According to medical reports, the mortality
rate associated with this virus is low. However, the long duration of the disease and the disability of
patients for a long time cause further spread of the disease and thus increase the mortality associated
with this disease. It has killed over 1200000 people by the end of September 2020 [2].
It is noteworth†y that many COVID-19 patients will develop mild to moderate illness and recover
without hospitalization. Fever, dry cough, and tiredness are the most common symptoms of COVID19. These patients are advised to manage their symptoms at home. On the other hand, serious symptoms
such as difficulty breathing and chest pain have appeared in some patients during the disease [3]. This
condition can quickly get worse so that an emergency situation occurs. These critical situations can
increase human decision-making errors leading to more financial and non-financial losses.
Besides, predicting the situation of patients is useful for hospitals and health centers due to the
spread of this virus. It can help to design targeted tests of people, predict the number of required
resources in hospitals and health centers, and inform medical plans for prioritizing the level of care,
design-related policy about vaccination, and so on. [4, 5]. In this way, health centers and hospitals can

appropriately allocate their limited resources including treatment in intensive care units (ICUs), tests,
and ventilators to the patients.
Therefore, to prevent human decision-making errors and to properly allocate the limited resources,
it is a rational idea to design an expert system for the prediction of resource utilization in patients with
COVID-19. In this study, the COVID-19 patient pre-condition dataset provided by the Mexican
government is used [6]. To the best of our knowledge, for the first time, a fuzzy expert system is
designed for the prediction of a problem related to the COVID-19 patients. In addition to developing a
type-2 fuzzy expert system, an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system and some classification methods
such as NB, CBR, DT, and KNN are implemented. Finally, we compare the results of these techniques
in terms of accuracy and F-measure.
The structure of this paper is as follows: a literature review of different expert systems for medical
diagnosis is presented in section 2. The steps of designing the type-2 fuzzy expert system are presented
in section 3. In section 4, the interval type-2 fuzzy expert system for ICU admission is presented.
Classification methods and the developed fuzzy expert systems are evaluated in section 5. Finally,
conclusions and some directions for future studies are considered in section 6.

2. Literature review
In this section, published research of Web of Science between the years 1980 and 2020 about the
“COVID-19” or “Coronavirus” and “fuzzy expert systems” are analyzed using VOSviewer 1.6.10
software, and the corresponding results are presented in Figure 1. Different circles show a different
number of articles and the larger circles are associated with more articles. The lines between circles
show the relationships among their articles in terms of their references. Besides, VOSviewer 1.6.10
software clusters different circles into six colored clusters according to their relationships. Figure 2
shows the results according to the year of the published articles.
According to the published research of Web of Science, a search with “COVID-19” or
“Coronavirus” or other equivalent terms found more than 65000 results. Besides, “expert systems” is
appeared in more than 23000 papers. However, no paper presents a fuzzy expert system for COVID-19
or Coronavirus. It demonstrates a serious gap due to the importance of the COVID-19 epidemic and the
application of expert systems for diagnosis. Therefore, in this paper, we are going to fill this gap by
designing fuzzy expert systems for the prediction of ICU admission in COVID-19 patients.

Figure 1. Different applications of COVID-19 and expert systems

Thanks to the importance of expert systems, many researchers have used them in medical fields
for the diagnosis of various diseases. For example, Hamedan et al. proposed a fuzzy expert system to
predict chronic kidney disease. In their work, first, they identified the diagnostic parameters and risk
factors through a literature review and a survey of some nephrologists, then a set of fuzzy rules for the
2

prediction of chronic kidney disease was determined [26]. In another study, Hussain et al. presented a
multi-layered fuzzy Mamdani inference system to analyze the prevailing thyroid disease. In their study,
the proposed expert system is based on two layers. In layer 1, the presence or absence of thyroid disease
is diagnosed. If layer 1 indicates the presence of thyroid disease, then layer 2 is activated by which the
type of thyroid disease is determined [27].
Khalil et al. developed a new fuzzy soft expert system to predict lung cancer disease by using
weight loss, shortness of breath, chest pain, persistent cough, blood in sputum, and age of patients. In
their work, a prediction of the fuzzy soft expert system is composed of four main steps: 1) Transforming
real-valued inputs into fuzzy numbers. 2) Converting fuzzy numbers into fuzzy soft sets. 3) Reducing
the family of fuzzy soft sets obtained to a new family of fuzzy soft sets. 4) Using the proposed method
to get the output data [28]. Mahanta and Panda developed a fuzzy expert system for the prediction of
prostate cancer. In their study, age, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), prostate volume (PV), and Free
PSA (FPSA) are fed as inputs into the system, and prostate cancer risk (PCR) is obtained as the output
[29].
Mirmozaffari et al. presented an expert system for diagnosing the type of gastrointestinal disease
and determining the type of tests needed to diagnose the disease [30]. Mojrian et al. presented a method
based on a multilayer fuzzy expert system for the detection of breast cancer using an extreme learning
machine (ELM) classification model integrated with radial basis function (RBF) kernel called ELMRBF. In this study, they showed that their proposed method outperforms the linear-SVM model [31].

In another study, Naseer et al. proposed a fuzzy expert system for the diagnosis of heart disease.
In their proposed system, the input variables comprised of age, chest pain, electrocardiography, blood
pressure systolic, diabetes, and cholesterol are transmitted with the help of fuzzy rules which are framed
in the light of low, normal, high, and very high intensity and the output is obtained using the Mamdani
Inference method diagnosing the heart disease [32]. Siddiqui et al. developed an adaptive hierarchical
Mamdani fuzzy expert system for the detection of arthritis. In their research, the expert system is
comprised of two layers. In the first layer, the input variables are rest pain, morning stiffness, body pain,
joint infection, swelling, redness, past injury and age that detects output condition of arthritis to be
normal, infection and/or other problem, and in the second layer, the type of arthritis is diagnosed [33].
Table 1 summarizes the fuzzy expert systems proposed for the diagnosis of various types of diseases.

3. Designing the type-2 fuzzy expert system
As mentioned earlier, the main objective of this paper is to design an expert system to predict ICU
needs for COVID-19 patients based on type-2 FL. To this end, there are two common approaches for
the selection of the parameters of a type-2 FL system. The first one is the partially dependent approach.
In this approach, first, the best possible type-1 FL system is designed. Then, it is used to initialize the
parameters of a type-2 FL system. The second one is the totally independent approach where all of the
parameters of the type-2 FL system are tuned without using an existing type-1 design [36]. In this paper,
we use the partially dependent approach because of its advantages compared with the totally dependent
approach. After designing type 1 fuzzy system, a type-2 rule based fuzzy system with uncertain standard
deviation and interval-valued membership function is implemented. The same rules of the type-1 fuzzy
system are used by this system and the only difference is that if-part and then-part are type-2. The
designed system is comprised of the following steps:

Data preprocessing and determining the inputs and output of the system;
Clustering the output space and determination of the number of rules;
Projection of membership functions of the output onto the inputs to obtain the
membership values of the inputs;
Tuning the parameters of type-1 membership functions of inputs and output variables;
Transforming type-1 to interval type-2 membership functions;
Tuning the parameters of type-2 membership functions.

3.1. Data Preprocessing
We use a publicly available dataset, containing information of about 566602 patients. The data
contains some information about pregnancy, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),
asthma, cardiovascular, obesity, tobacco, etc. and determines whether a patient needs an ICU or not [6].
In this dataset, there are 444814 missing data for ICU. Therefore, the final number of patients used in
fuzzy expert systems and other classification techniques is 121788. Besides, a few outliers (e.g., male
patient's pregnancy) were detected and removed from the dataset.
Most precondition features of this dataset are categorical, each of which takes the value yes, no,
and unspecified. These categorical features were converted to numerical by ‘one-hot’ encoding. By
creating auxiliary variables that help differentiate between various categories of a feature, one-hot
encoding transforms the categorical feature to multiple binary variables. Finally, highly correlated
variables were eliminated as they provide similar information. Specifically, we calculated pairwise
correlations among the variables and one among any two highly correlated variables with an absolute
correlation coefficient higher than 0.85 was removed. After the preparation of the dataset, we reached
27 features, with one output determines whether a patient need to the ICU or not.

3.2. Clustering the output space and determination of the number of rules
To determine the number of rules, we use Fukuyama cluster validity index which can be defined
as follows [37]: (1)
min

2≤c≤C𝑚𝑎𝑥

2

m
c
N
m
VFS (U, V, X) = ∑ci=1 ∑N
̅ ‖2 ,
j=1 uij ‖xj − vi ‖ − ∑i=1 ∑j=1 uij ‖vi − v

(1)

where 𝑋 = {x1 , x2 , … , xN } ⊆ ℝ𝑑 is the dataset in d-dimensional vector space, uij is the degree of
belonging of the jth data to the ith cluster, 𝑉 = {v1 , v2 , … , vc } is the prototypes of clusters, c is the
number of clusters, v̅ =

∑ vi
c

, m is the degree of fuzziness, U is fuzzy partition matrix, and N is the

number of samples. By solving min

2≤c≤C𝑚𝑎𝑥

VFS, the optimal cluster number is obtained. In this study, this

cluster validity index was implemented and the optimal value for the number of clusters is obtained five
clusters. Therefore, we have five rules in our system. In the proposed system, Mamdani inference
system is used where the antecedents and consequents of the rule-based system are fuzzy sets. We
clustered the output data and then obtained the output clusters' primary membership grades using
Sugeno and Yasukawa method [38]. First, we partition the output space, and then, get the input space
clusters by projecting the output space partition to each input variable space.

3.3. Projection of membership functions of the output onto the inputs
For the input variables, the appropriate membership grades should be calculated after clustering
the output space. One way is to set each input's membership grade equal to its corresponding output
membership grade obtained by the procedure of output data clustering. In this way, for each output data,
5

all the related input variables would then have a similar membership grade. The issue with this approach
is that the membership functions are not convex and a further approximation is required to form the
convex membership functions. Furthermore the output membership grade is not always the same as the
input membership grades at each sample point [39]. For these reasons, in this paper, Zarandi’s approach
is used. According to this approach, first, the ranges in which the membership functions of the input
variable adopt value 1 are determined. The data points are then classified using GK method, by given
m and c determined in the preceding step (obtained from output variable clustering stage) and analyzing
the objective function of classification algorithm (for more details please refer to [39]).
3.4. Tuning the parameters of type-1 membership functions
There are several parameters in type-1 FL systems that can either be pre-specified or can be tuned
during a training phase. An impeccable FL system should have 𝑓(𝑥) = 𝑑, where d is the desired output.
However, there are typically errors between the desired and actual output. Therefore, in order to produce
better results, tuning the parameters of the fuzzy model is important. In this paper, the suggested tuning
algorithm by Liang and Mendel is used. Based on this approach, all of the parameters related to a
Gaussian type-1 are tuned using the steepest-descent method. Given an input-output training pair
(𝑥 (𝑖) , 𝑦 (𝑖) ), 𝑥 (𝑖) ∈ 𝑅 𝐺 and 𝑦 (𝑖) 𝜖𝑅, a type-1 fuzzy is designed by minimizing the following error function
[40]:
1
𝑒(𝑡) = [𝑓(𝑥 (𝑖) ) − 𝑦 (𝑖) ]2 ,
2

𝑖 = 1, … , 𝑁.

(2)

3.5. Transforming type-1 to interval type-2 membership functions
To transform type-1 to an interval type-2 fuzzy set with uncertain standard deviation, the case of a
Gaussian primary membership function with a fixed mean 𝑚𝑓𝑆 and uncertain standard deviation that
takes on values in [𝜎𝑓𝑆1 , 𝜎𝑓𝑆2 ] is considered [40]:
𝑢𝑓𝑆 (𝑥𝑓 )

1 𝑥𝑓 − 𝑚𝑓𝑆
= 𝑒𝑥𝑝 [− (
)],
2
𝜎𝑓𝑆

𝜎𝑓𝑆 ∈ [𝜎𝑓𝑆1 , 𝜎𝑓𝑆2 ],

(3)

where 𝑓 = 1, … , 𝐺 ; 𝐺 is number of antecedent; 𝑆 = 1, … , 𝐷 ; and 𝐷 is number of rules. We can
obtain the upper and lower membership functions by replacing 𝜎𝑓𝑆2 and 𝜎𝑓𝑆1 with 𝜎𝑓𝑆 in the above
expression.
3.6. Tuning the parameters of type-2 membership functions
For tuning the parameters of the interval type-2 FL system, we use the proposed tuning algorithm
by Liang and Mendel. In interval type-2 system, 𝑓(𝑥) is determined by upper and lower membership
functions and centroids of interval type-2 fuzzy sets, and therefore, we want to tune these parameters.
Since an interval type-2 FL system can be identified by two fuzzy basis function expansions, we can
focus on tuning the parameters of just these two type-1 FL systems [41].
4. Proposed interval type-2 fuzzy expert system
In this paper, we use Mamdani inference system in which the antecedents and consequent are type2 fuzzy sets which have a fixed mean and an uncertain standard deviation that takes values in an interval.

6

The interval type-2 FL system is created from the type-1 FL system. The proposed system uses
singleton fuzzification, product t-norm, product inference, and center-of-sets type-reduction, with the
same number of fuzzy sets and rules as the type-1 FL system. Several defuzzification methods have
been used, such as centroid, bisector, and Yager. The best results of this system is obtained by Yager
defuzzification method. Figure 3 demonstrates the rule based and inference mechanism for the proposed
interval type-2 fuzzy system.

5. Performance Evaluation and Analysis
In this paper, in addition to developing a type-2 fuzzy expert system for prediction of ICU
admission, we develop the ANFIS model for this prediction task using MATLAB toolbox. Then, we
compare the performance of the developed fuzzy expert systems to several well-known classification
methods such as NB, CBR, DT, and KNN in terms of accuracy and F-measure. To evaluate the
performance of each system, the dataset is divided into training and test sets. In this way, for each
system modeling technique, 70% of the dataset has been used for training. Table 2 shows the accuracy
and F-measure of different system modeling techniques implemented in this study.
Classification accuracy is the total number of accurate predictions divided by the total number of
predictions made for a dataset. As a performance measure, accuracy is not sufficient for imbalanced
classification problems. The key explanation is that the vast number of examples from the dominant
class or classes would overwhelm the number of minority class examples. Using precision and recall
metrics is an alternative to using classification accuracy. F-Measure integrates both precision and recall
into a single measure and captures both properties [42]. As can be seen in Table 2, the developed fuzzy
expert systems could achieve an accuracy of 91.6% and an F-measure of 95.6%. Comparing to the CBR
and KNN methods, the fuzzy expert systems can improve the accuracy and F-measure by about 1.5%
to 5% and 1% to 3%, respectively. Furthermore, the developed fuzzy models performed competitively
compared to the other classification methods. Overall, the results show that both type-2 fuzzy system
and ANFIS model could outperform the well-known classification methods.
Type-2 FL systems usually give better results than their type-1 counterparts as the type-2 fuzzy
sets and systems generalize type-1 fuzzy sets and systems so that more uncertainty can be handled.
However, in our case, as can be seen, the results of the type-2 fuzzy expert system are very close to the
ANFIS model. In the dataset, as most input variables are categorical, the type-2 fuzzy sets lost its
efficiency. Therefore, in this specific problem, type-2 FL has lost its superiority over the developed
ANFIS model.

6. Conclusion
In this study, a type-2 fuzzy expert system and an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system are
developed for the prediction of ICU admission. Furthermore, to evaluate the performance of
these fuzzy systems, several classification methods such as NB, CBR, DT, and KNN are also
implemented. All these methods are tested on a publicly available dataset. The results demonstrate
the efficacy of the proposed fuzzy expert systems, with an accuracy of 91.6% and an F-measure of
95.6%, which outperform the other conventional classification techniques. When comparing the two
developed fuzzy expert systems, we can notice that the results of the type-2 fuzzy expert system are
very close to the ANFIS model since, in our problem, most input variables are categorical.
Over time, more datasets will be published related to the COVID-19 disease because more and
more tests are performed every day for this disease. Therefore, for future studies, the proposed fuzzy
expert systems can be evaluated over some other datasets. As mentioned earlier, in this study, the type2 FL has lost its superiority over the type-1 fuzzy model as most of the input variables are categorical.
If the number of continuous input variables in new datasets is higher, the type-2 fuzzy expert system
may provide better results due to its higher generalizability.
