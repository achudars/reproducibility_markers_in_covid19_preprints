ABSTRACT
Since December 2019, A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has been
breaking out in China, which can cause respiratory diseases and
severe pneumonia. Mathematical and empirical models relying on
the epidemic situation scale for forecasting disease outbreaks have
received increasing attention. Given its successful application in the
evaluation of infectious diseases scale, we propose a SusceptibleUndiagnosed-Infected-Removed (SUIR) model to offer the effective
prediction, prevention, and control of infectious diseases. Our model
is a modified susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model that injects
undiagnosed state and offers pre-training effective reproduction
number. Our SUIR model is more precise than the traditional SIR
model. Moreover, we combine domain knowledge of the epidemic
to estimate effective reproduction number, which addresses the
initial susceptible population of the infectious disease model approach to the ground truth. These findings have implications for
the forecasting of epidemic trends in COVID-19 as these could help
the growth of estimating epidemic situation.

the central cities of China, was epidemiologically related to the
group of patients with unexplained pneumonia, and the global attention shifted to China [27]. Local health authorities identified a
novel coronavirus, tentatively named 2019-nCoV, which is the third
human cross-infection of coronavirus in 30 years, causing global
health concerns [28]. Chinese government took extraordinary measures, first in Wuhan and then in 12 other Chinese cities, to control
the epidemic by closing markets and imposing blockades [11]. The
disease has now spread globally, including cases confirmed in 216
Countries [26]. Depending on the World Health Organization statistics, as of 24 July, 2020, the Global region was 15,296,926 confirmed
cases, and 628,903 cases died [25], surpassing the epidemic of the
severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 [24]. Global countries are issue policies to control the 2019-nCoV spread and provide
financial support and health rescue. Therefore, predicting the future
growth trend of the epidemic situation performs a vital function in
measuring the large scale epidemic situation [30].
Mathematical and Empirical models have been widely adopt in
the field of the epidemic, which adequately illustrates the transmission speed, spatial range, transmission path, and dynamic mechanism of infectious diseases [3]. Depending on the categories of
infectious diseases, conventional infectious disease models divide
into SIR, time delay SIR, and SEIR model [5, 10, 15]. Subsequently,
there are many applications based on the epidemic model. Huo and
Zhao considered birth and death rates on heterogeneous complex
networks, which proposed a fractional SIR model and obtain results
that when the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically
stable, the disease can disappear [13]. A detailed study of the TSIR (Time-series Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) model by Ottar
et al. [6] exposed the epidemic cycle and the outbreak of measles.
A significant SIR model on the subject was presented by Jiang and
Wei [14], which established the existence of Hopf bifurcations at
the endemic equilibrium. Analysis of the SIR model involved with
nonlinear incidence rate and time delay was proved that the underlying reproductive number R 0 > 1, the system is permanent [29].
McCluskey further developed a SIR model of disease transmission
with delay and nonlinear incidence on [29], which used a Lyapunov
functional shown the global dynamics are entirely determined [17].
A qualitative study by Li et al. [16] identified A threshold 𝜎 to determine the outcome of the disease on the SEIR model of infectious
disease transmission. Smith et al. applied a latent period, excess
death of the infected, and a standard incidence on the SEIR epidemic
model to identify the reproduction number R 0 [20].
However, these technologies have consistently shown a lack
of investigation on disease characteristics, such as undiagnosed

infectiousness. Therefore, it is critical to assess the effects of undiagnosed states on the epidemic progression for the benefit of global
expectation. We are curious about the development of the epidemic
and hope to contribute to its control. We investigated the global
epidemic situation of COVID-19 infection and predicted future
growth trends. Consequently, we proposed a mathematical model
to analyze and forecast the number of individuals infected and
recovered (including deaths) of COVID-19 in epidemic countries.
This paper proposed a Susceptible-Undiagnosed-Infected-Removed
(SUIR) Model and applies the simplex algorithm on the historical
incidence data to fit 𝛽 and 𝛾 of parameters, and predict the number
of infected and removed (including cured and dead) in the next
𝑡 (per day). The contributions of this work are presented as follows: Previous studies of R (𝑡) have not dealt with preprocessing
of epidemic model. Most of these studies have suffered from the
results of experiments in which the initial number of susceptible
population is too large. To address this initialization challenge, the
experimental work presented here provides the first pre-training
approach (R (𝑡)) into how combined with the domain knowledge of
epidemics, which enable applying pre-training R (𝑡) to estimate the
initial number of susceptible population. What’s more, This is the
first study to undertake an analysis of infectivity of undiagnosed
individuals, which provided an important opportunity to advance
the accuracy model’s understanding.
This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the SUIR epidemic model is formulated. In Section 3, the properties of database
are studied, the basic Hyperparameters are given, the reliability of
the solution and prediction error are illustrated. Section 4 highlights
simulation results which conduct key control policies on the SUIR
model. In Section 5, some statistical inferences and model results
are discussed. Some conclusions are summarized in Section 6.

2 METHODOLOGY
2.1 Dynamics model of infectious diseases
There are a large number of published studies that describe the
link between mathematical dynamic model and infectious diseases.
Kermack-McKendrick [15] proposed the system dynamic (SusceptibleInfective-Removal, SIR) model, which describes the transmission
process of infectious diseases through a quantitative relationship
to the transmission mechanism of general infectious diseases, analyzed the change rule of the number of infected cases and reveals
the growth trend of infectious diseases. SIR model divided into
three categories population, which include Susceptible (𝑆), Infectious (𝐼 ), and Removed (𝑅). Based on the research of Kermack and
McKendrick [15], Beretta and Takeuchi [5] further developed their
theories and proposed a time delay SIR model. Cooke and Driessche
[10] investigated the incubation period in the spread of infectious
diseases, introduced "Exposed, 𝐸," and proposed a time delay model.
Depending on the above infectious disease models, which were
similar to the 2019-nCoV epidemic. This paper focuses on applying
the SIR model as a fundamental hypothesis.
The traditional SIR model is based on the SI model [4] to consider
the recovery process of patients further and incorporates two critical parameters, including the infection rate (𝛽) and the proportion
coefficient (𝛾). Due to the characteristics of the 2019-nCoV, one of
the main obstacles of the traditional SIR model, which not consider

(4)

𝑀 represents the total population. Kermack-McKendrick [15] assumed that patients obtain permanent immunity from recovery.
Therefore, recovery patients can be removed from the system. In
fatal infectious diseases, death cases were incorporated into the 𝑅
category.

2.3

Structure and Hypothesis for SUIR model

The SUIR model divides the population into four states: 𝑆, 𝑈 , 𝐼 and
𝑅. Conceptually, the chain of the state transition is shown as Figure
1:
(1) 𝑆, susceptible;
(2) 𝑈 , undiagnosed, refers to the patients who have been infected with diseases but have not been confirmed;
(3) 𝐼 , (the confirmed cases not quarantined, infectious) and 𝐼𝑆
(confirmed and quarantined, noninfectious), refers to the infected individual and was regarded as the confirmed patient;
(4) 𝑅, removed, refers to the patient who recovers with immunity
or dies.
The first step in this process was to apply the historical data of
𝑆, 𝐼 , and 𝑅 states to fit the transfer proportion parameters among

population estimates. The second step used fitted parameters to predict the future disease state. The above model is similar to SIR, but
the state of 𝐼 was divided into two sections in practical application,
including the state of 𝐼 (Confirmed but not quarantined, infectious)
and the state of 𝐼𝑆 (Confirmed and quarantined, noninfectious).
Here, we assume that:
(1) The study area’s total population never changes by time;
both natural birth rates and mortality rates are not considered.
(2) The number of susceptible individuals affected by infectious
diseases changes in direct proportion to the number of susceptible and infectious individuals.
(3) The growth rate of the number of quarantined and removal
individuals is proportional to the number of infected individuals.
(4) Both the diagnosed (without quarantined) and the undiagnosed can infect individuals.
(5) The quarantined confirmed case can not infect individuals.
(6) Track close contact with confirmed cases and quarantine
some undiagnosed individuals and assume that the average
number of quarantined undiagnosed individuals caused by
one confirmed case is 𝜌.

2.4

Define SUIR Model HyperParameters and
Differential Equations

In the modeling phase of the study, the initial susceptible population (𝑆 0 ) was suggested to estimate. In this regard, we assumed
that 𝑆 0 is the population base of the country or city to be estimated.
However, there is a certain drawback associated with the use of
the country or city’s population base, which the entire population
would consider as susceptible individuals. To address the challenge
of 𝑆 0 initialization, Cintron et al. [9] offered the R (𝑡) HyperParameter, which represents the average number of secondary cases
of disease caused by a single infected individual over his or her
infectious period, and note that R 0 = R (0) for the initial day. For
the estimation of 𝑆 0 , a pretraining R (𝑡) approach was conducted
on the SIR model, in which the number of peak infections (the
total number of peak 𝐼 and 𝑅) obtained from the experiment was
regarded as initial 𝑆 0 .
Here, we utilized two approaches to locate the pretraining R (𝑡)
sequence. We adopt China’s data to explore the variation of R (𝑡)
with temperature and humidity and applied it to other countries’
R (𝑡) sequence estimation. Criteria for selecting the subjects were as
follows: 100 Chinese cities with more than 40 confirmed cases were
decided, and the R (𝑡) series of these cities were estimated based
on the historical incidence data using the [22], and the interval
range was January 21 to January 23. Chinese government published
that strict control measures would be implemented on January 23
[21]; therefore, the R (𝑡) sequence before January 23 reflects some
extent of the epidemic situation (without intervention). To identify
temperature and humidity patterns, the database applied the China
Meteorological Data Service Center and chose the daily average
temperature and relative humidity of the above 100 cities from
January 21 to January 23. The fixed-effects (FE) panel regression
[7] was adopt according to the above procedure:
𝑦𝑖𝑡 = 𝑐𝑜𝑒 𝑓𝑖 + x𝑖𝑡 𝛽 + 𝑣𝑖𝑡 ,

(5)

where 𝑦𝑖𝑡 represents the effective reproduce number R of city 𝑖 in
day 𝑡, x𝑖𝑡 is the (1 × 2) vector, including temperature and relative
humidity of city 𝑖 in day 𝑡. 𝛽 represents a (2×1) vector of parameters,
𝑐𝑜𝑒 𝑓𝑖 represents the intercept of city 𝑖. 𝑣𝑖𝑡 is the error of city 𝑖 in
day 𝑡.
To address the equation between R (𝑡) and temperature and
humidity, the following steps were taken: ordinary least squares
regression has been used to investigate Eq. (5), average of all 𝑐𝑜𝑒 𝑓𝑖
is taken as the final 𝑐𝑜𝑒 𝑓 . The result is addressed as
R (𝑡) = 𝑐𝑜𝑒 𝑓 + 𝛽 1 ·𝑇 𝑒𝑚𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒 (𝑡) + 𝛽 2 ·𝑅𝑒𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒𝐻𝑢𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑦 (𝑡). (6)
we defined the (𝑐𝑜𝑒 𝑓 , 𝛽 1, 𝛽 2 ), which estimated from Chinese data.
On completion of parameters, we adopt temperature and relative
humidity data of countries to be estimated, in which the process of
R (𝑡) estimation was carried out Eq. (6).
The second method assumes that other countries adopt the same
control measures as Wuhan, which used the historical incidence
rate of Wuhan to estimate R (𝑡) [22].
Due to the Eq. (1), the relationship among the R 0 , 𝛽 and 𝛾 is
R0 =

𝛽 ·𝑀
,
𝛾

(7)

𝑆 (𝑡 )

based on R (𝑡) = 𝑀 R 0 and an assumption that 𝑆 (𝑡) ≈ 𝑀 in a
short period. Consequently, the experiment was conducted under
conditions in which R (𝑡) and 𝛾 were specified and lasted for 𝑇 days.
Finally, 𝑆 0 was a total of 𝐼 (𝑇 ) and 𝑅(𝑇 ).
𝐼 (𝑇 ) + 𝑅 (𝑇 ) = 𝑆 0 .

(8)

SUIR model includes six parameters:
• 𝛽: The infection rate of contact between diagnosed and susceptible population.
• 𝜎: The infection rate of undiagnosed cases in contact with
the susceptible population.
• 𝜌: The average quarantine number of undiagnosed close
contacts with confirmed cases.
• 𝜀: The probability of undiagnosed infection by confirmed.
• 𝜆: The probability of quarantine of confirmed cases.
• 𝛾: The probability of removal of confirmed cases. (cure and

In this study, an investigation unit represents one day. The transition relationship between susceptible (𝑆) and undiagnosed (𝑈 )
for one day includes two categories. One is obtaining the infection from the infected individuals (𝐼 ), which represents the 𝛽𝑆𝐼 in
Eq. (9), similar to the traditional SIR model, the other is to obtain
the infection from contact with undiagnosed individuals (𝑈 ), with
a rate of 𝜎. It should be noted that we assumed that the quarantine

𝜌 (undiagnosed individuals) could be quarantined by tracking close
contact with the confirmed cases; therefore, the number of undiagnosed infections is 𝜎 · 𝑆 ·𝑚𝑎𝑥 ((𝑈 − 𝜌 · 𝐼𝑆)), 0). In each investigation
unit, 𝜀 · 𝑈 (undiagnosed individuals) were diagnosed with a quarantine rate of 𝜆. Therefore, the total newly diagnosed individuals
((1 − 𝜆) · 𝜀 · 𝑈 ) was converted into Infected (𝐼 ) individuals, and
𝜆 · 𝜀 · 𝑈 was converted into Infected & quarantined (𝐼𝑆) individuals,
as Eq. (11) and (12). The final stage of the study comprised a similar
structure with the SIR model that the transition probability between
confirmed and removal cases (cured or death) is 𝛾, as Eq. (13).
We defined 𝑆 (𝑡), 𝑈 (𝑡), 𝐼 (𝑡), 𝐼𝑆 (𝑡), 𝑅(𝑡) as the number of susceptible, undiagnosed, infected, infected-isolated and removal individuals at time t, △𝑡 represent the unit time, the differential equations
are summarized:
𝑆 (𝑡 + △𝑡) = 𝑆 (𝑡) − 𝛽𝑆 (𝑡)𝐼 (𝑡)
− 𝜎𝑆 (𝑡) max((𝑈 (𝑡) − 𝜌𝐼𝑆 (𝑡), 0)

(14)

𝑈 (𝑡 + △𝑡) = 𝑈 (𝑡) + 𝛽𝑆 (𝑡)𝐼 (𝑡)
+ 𝜎𝑆 (𝑡) max((𝑈 (𝑡) − 𝜌𝐼𝑆 (𝑡), 0) − 𝜀𝑈 (𝑡)
𝐼 (𝑡 + △𝑡) = 𝐼 (𝑡) + (1 − 𝜆)𝜀𝑈 (𝑡) − 𝛾𝐼 (𝑡)

3 RESULTS
3.1 Database description
Data were gathered from multiple sources at various time points
during the epidemic outbreak. To investigate the prediction of
China, we adopted the National Health Commission (NHC) of China
daily epidemic statistics report [2], which composed of the cumulative number of infectious, recovered, and death cases in China
and summarized in Table 1 (e. g. Wuhan). To address the global outbreak, the JHU CSSE Database [1] are summarized in Table 2 (e. g.
USA). Since January 22, 2020, the JHU CSSE Database was updated
per day and composed of three sections, including the cumulative
number of infectious, recovered, and death cases. Furthermore, we
select 15-days data at least before the forecast date for training the
model, e.g., to obtain trend of the USA on April 1, we collects the
data of USA from March 17 to March 31.

This deterministic epidemic model is based on the hypothesis of

diseases. But in 2019-nCoV with a high probability of the correct
hypothesis.

Hyperparameter simulations for the SUIR
model

The hyperparameter experiment’s purpose was to adopted two
sections of R (𝑡) based on the SIR model, aiming to obtain the upper bound 𝑆 0 . Simple statistical analysis was used to investigate
Eq. (6), which demonstrated the relationship between R (𝑡) and
temperature and humidity. Following statistical analysis, 𝑐𝑜𝑒 𝑓 , 𝛽 1 ,
and 𝛽 2 were obtained, which their values are 3.968, -0.0383 and
-0.0224. Figure. 2 presents the range of temperature and humidity
for R (𝑡). Figure. 3 shows an overview of R (𝑡) of Wuhan calculated
by [22]. Since January 28th, the R (𝑡) estimated by the incidence
rate of Wuhan has a significant decreasing trend and is lower than
1, which could be the consequence of Wuhan’s control measures.
Figure. 4 provides the range of R (𝑡) sequences for some outbreak
countries. A clear trend of R (𝑡) sequences under without intervention has widely fluctuated in this analysis. Table 3 provides the
estimation results of 𝑆 0 obtained from two groups of R (𝑡) functioning in different countries. The estimation experiments start on
February 21st and last for 100 days.

Solution of the SUIR model

To obtain fitted parameters, we collected the Historical data as of
July 24, and Hyperparameter 𝑆 0 was estimated from local R (𝑡)

number of confirmed cases and removed cases. Figure. 5 and Figure.
6 illustrate the summary statistics for Italy and Germany. As can be
seen from Figure 5, we can see that the number of confirmed cases
in Italy showed an increasing trend before September, and then
tended to be flat. The number of active cases first increased and
then decreased with time, approaching a peak in mid-April, with
approximately 100,000 cases. As shown in Figure 6, further analysis
showed that the number of confirmed cases in Germany revealed
a growing trend before the middle of September, and active cases
peaked were reported in April, including approximately 60,000
cases.

SIMULATION

Multiple parameters of models reveal that the spreading status of
epidemics. In an attempt to make adjustment on some parameters,
which enables simulation implementing on the different intensities of control policies. This section presents two prototypes of
simulations based on Wuhan’s policies.

Effect of close contact isolation

For the purpose of controlling the epidemic situation, Wuhan has
taken strict quarantine measures for close contacts, tracking the
close contacts of confirmed cases, and conducted medical isolation
observation, which process describes the change of the parameter 𝜌.
For the simulation of the tracking process, the intensity of isolation
measures can be adjusted to simulate the spread of the epidemic
scale. The first step in this process was to adapt Wuhan data to fit
the model, where the specific model parameters were obtained. The
second step was to retain other parameters fixed and adjusted the
isolation ratio of close contacts as 0.8𝜌, 0.6𝜌, 0.55𝜌, which enabled
the estimation of the spread of the epidemic situation.
Looking at Figure 7, it is apparent that when the isolation ratio
decreases, the patients’ peak number and time in treatment will
change. The most interesting aspect of this graph is that when the
isolation ratio decreased to 0.55𝜌, the peak number of patients in
treatment reached more than twice the real value (Green curve).
A clear benefit of tracking and isolating close contacts of the confirmed cases in the prevention of the epidemic’s growth could be
identified in this analysis.

Effect of diagnosis rate

On February 5, 2020, the government of Hubei Province issued policies to accelerate the diagnosis and measure the number of infected
patients [18]. Delayed diagnose can cause infection patients to enable not be quarantined in time and generate more infected cases. In
the SUIR model, parameter 𝜀 represents the rate of diagnosis of the

Figure 8: Under different diagnostic rates, the number of patients in treatment changes with time

undiagnosed infected. The experiments were simulated using the
Wuhan data to fit and obtained model parameters. After training,
the parameters were remained unchanged except the diagnosis rate,
which decreased to 0.8𝜀, 0.6𝜀, and 0.55𝜀, and applied the estimation
of epidemic spread scale.

From the data in Figure 8, it is apparent that the rate of diagnosis decreased, which causes the curve’s peak quantity and peak
arrival time were variable. The delayed diagnosis rate will cause
more infections, performing more significant pressure on medical
resources.

DISCUSSION

Our results suggest that the SUIR model’s prediction accuracy is precise than the traditional SIR model in 2019-nCoV. On the question of
initial dimension 𝑆 0 (susceptible individual) settings, this study discovered that applied R (𝑡) sequence (includes domain knowledge)
on the SIR model to pretraining, which contributes a reference for
establishing 𝑆 0 . These results in Table 3 highlight 𝑆 0 estimation
results obtained by performing two sections of R (𝑡) to different
countries. It can be seen from the results in Table 3 that the 𝑆 0
from Wuhan R (𝑡) sequence is smaller than that from the local
R (𝑡) sequence. A possible explanation for these results may be the
lack of the same control measures as Wuhan, China. Consequently,
national control measures will affect the infected individual trend.
The actual epidemic trend since our analyses has present the
Hyperparameters has a significant weight on predict. More recent
examples of narrative studies within the influence of air temperature and humidity on hyperparameter R (𝑡) (COVID-19) can be
found in the work of [19] and [23]. It is encouraging to compare
Figure 2 with that found by [19] who found that low temperature
and low humidity will make the R (𝑡) of COVID-19 more significant,
reflecting the virus’s more solid transmission ability. A detailed
study by Kermack-McKendrick [15] indicates that the relationship
among 𝛽, 𝛾 and 𝜎 is 𝜎 = 𝛽 / 𝛾. In this regard, 𝜎 determines the
spread of infectious diseases, which R 0 < 1 / 𝜎 represents the transmission is limited [12]. Our study generally supports [15] and [12]
speculations; we believe the fluctuation of 𝛽 indicates the epidemic
infectivity. Our results in Table 4 compares an overview of fitted
parameters in seven countries, Iran, France and Germany have
higher 𝛽 than other countries, indicating that 2019-nCoV more infectious in these countries. Furthermore, the most obvious finding
to emerge from the analysis is that 𝛾 of the United States located at

a lower level than other countries, indicating that confirmed cases
in the United States have a postponed treatment period than in
other countries. Another important finding was that Italy and Iran
have a low level of 𝜀, which suggests there is a higher risk of undiagnosed infections at the early stage. As a result, hyperparameters
determine the fitting quality and prediction precision.
Error statistics of the model validates the accuracy of the SUIR
model. In this study, SIR model and SUIR model were used to 7-day
prediction in multiple outbreaks countries (Table 5); the most obvious finding to emerge from the analysis is that the SUIR model
can adapt to the characteristic of COVID-19 and minimize the estimation errors. These results reflect those of Cao et al. [8] who also
found that undiagnosed cases took transmission ability. Further
analysis showed that the SUIR model and SIR model errors were
increasing with the increment of prediction. The weak performance
of the SUIR model is interesting, but not surprising. These possible sources of error could come from hyperparameter drive and a
prolonged latent period.
Some limitations of our model are the initialization of the parameters, such as 𝛽 and 𝛾. Under the improper setting, the model
will not be able to fit the historical data well and cause a high prediction error. Another limitation of our study is that we did not
account for the impact of imported cases. However, these problems
could be solved if we apply empirical models to trial and error and
often to update the data source. A further study with more focus on
parameter optimization and data extraction is therefore suggested.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK

In this paper, we propose a SUIR model and combine the characteristics of the 2019-nCoV epidemic to simulate and predict the future
trend of the epidemic. The findings of this study suggest that our
prediction model could precisely predict the number of infected
individuals in 2019-nCoV under the database of [1] and [2] with a
low error rate. The evidence from this study suggests that utilizing
R (𝑡) (domain knowledge) to predict the future trend of susceptible
individuals has a significant effect observed from the model. The
second major finding was that introducing the infectious state of
undiagnosed cases into the model resulted in much higher prediction accuracy than the traditional SIR model. By adjusting some
parameters of SUIR model, we are able to simulate the transmission
of COVID-19 under different intensities of control policies, and
evaluate the effects of them. These findings of this research provide insights for control epidemic situations. The most important
limitation lies in the fact that until we complete this study, the
2019-nCoV epidemic in some continents, such as the Africa, has
not recorded the outbreak stage. A further study could assess the
long-term effects of recovery cases on infectiousness.
