Information Behavior During the Covid-19 Crisis in German-Speaking
Countries
This paper explores the impact of the Covid-19 crisis at the level of individual
information behavior, based on an online survey among 308 participants from the
German-speaking countries Austria, Germany and Switzerland in April and May
2020. The results show first that the Covid-19 crisis has led to an increased
demand for reliable information. This goes alongside a significant increased use
of public broadcasting, newspapers and information provided by public
organizations. Second, the majority (84%) of the participants reported being
satisfied with the information supply during the Covid-19 crisis. Participants who
were less satisfied with the information supply during the Covid-19 crisis used
reliable sources significantly less frequently, specifically public television,
national newspapers and information provided by public organizations. Third, the
amount of Covid-19-related information during the peak of the crisis led some
participants to a feeling of information overload, which resulted in a reduction of
information seeking and media use.

Introduction
The disease Covid-19, caused by the beta coronavirus type SARS-CoV-2, was first
described at the end of 2019 in Wuhan, in the People’s Republic of China (PRC), and
by January 2020 had developed into an epidemic throughout the country . The first
confirmed Covid-19 case in the German-speaking countries was registered by January
27, 2020 in Germany, and then on February 25, 2020 in both Austria and Switzerland.
On March 11, 2020, Covid-19 was declared a global pandemic by the World Health
Organization (WHO). To slow the spread of the virus, far-reaching movement
restrictions for all citizens were announced by the federal governments in Austria,
Switzerland and Germany on March, 13,16 and 22, 2020, respectively. Where possible,
employees were recommended to work from home. Special precaution was

recommended for people over 65 years and people with specific existing health
conditions, who were considered as high-risk groups for Covid-19 (Robert Koch
Institute, 2020). The Covid-19 crisis has led to a great demand for information. To date,
large-scale patterns have been observed, which show that global Internet traffic has
increased as well as the number of visits to news sites, in particular (Siddique L. et al.,
2020). The New York Times reported that in the USA, established national and regional
newspapers received more than twice as many visits in March than in February. In the
same period, partisan and polarizing sites received fewer visits (Koeze & Popper, 2020).
For the situation in the German-speaking countries, an increase in Alexa
rankings of several sites was observed. Regional public news channels greatly gained in
popularity between January and March as well as the website of the national public
radio (DLF). On the other hand, the Alexa popularity rankings dropped in the same time
period for sites with less recent information (e.g. Wikipedia) and even for general
search sites (e.g. Google). Those users searching on Google posed more queries on sites
with reliable information (e.g. main evening news programs, the Robert Koch Institute,
RKI), as a look at Google Trends shows. The WHO has warned that much health
misinformation is being distributed concerning Covid-19, and has referred to the
pandemic as also being an infodemic (Richtel, 2020).
In this study, we investigate individual information behavior during the crisis.
There have been studies on information behavior and information dissemination for
other crises. However, the information ecology is constantly changing, and it seems
necessary to analyze the effect of the pandemic on the current information environment.
The dissemination of information in social media, and in particular on Twitter, has
already been researched in the first months of the crisis. However, the focus of such
studies is mainly on big data and does not reflect the diversity of resources used by

individuals. Therefore, a study on the changes of behavior patterns of individuals seems
relevant. We intend to show how citizens perceive their information needs, how they
change their mix of resources and how they judge information resources. This leads us
to the following research questions: (1) Have citizens in the German-speaking countries
changed their mix and usage intensity of information sources in the Covid-19 crisis? (2)
According to which criteria are they choosing their information sources during the
Covid-19 crisis?

Literature Review
Information behavior refers to ‘those activities a person may engage in when identifying
his or her own needs for information, searching for such information in any way, and
using or transferring that information’ (Wilson, 1999, p. 249). Information behavior is
related to media research, which focuses on ‘any form of communication transmitted
through a medium (channel) that simultaneously reaches a large number of people’
(Wimmer & Dominick, 2013, p. 2). There is a vast amount of research in this area,
including from the private sector, such as in-house research conducted by media
companies (Wimmer & Dominick, 2013). This review focuses on studies from the
German-speaking countries. An extensive longitudinal study is the ARD/ZDF study on
mass communication, conducted by the German public broadcasters ARD and ZDF
since 1964. The most recent study, conducted in 2019, found that TV and radio stations
are facing increasing competition from video streaming services. Germans between 14
and 29 years old are already predominantly using streaming services, while for the
overall German population regular TV and radio still dominate. On average, Germans
spend seven hours a day consuming various media, while the group below 30 years only
consumes six hours a day (Frees et al., 2019). The study further found that Germans
especially value public broadcasters for their journalistic quality, regional news

coverage and their support for political opinion-building, with those under 30 years of
age in particular valuing the services of public broadcasters positively. In contrast,
privately owned TV and radio stations are mainly consumed for the purpose of
entertainment (Breunig & Hottmannspötter, 2019). A study by PricewaterhouseCoopers
(PwC, 2018) among Germans (N=1,000) showed that only 18% trust information
published on Facebook and 85% would wish for more staff and resources to allow
media a more high-quality journalistic coverage.
Health information-seeking behavior (HISB) can be defined as ‘a knowledgegathering process, resulting from a health query or need’ (Mukherjee & Bawden, 2012,
p. 242) and therefore a special form of information seeking. Zimmerman and Shaw
(2020) conducted a literature review of 85 journal articles to analyze the change of
health information-seeking behavior as a result of the development of information
communication technologies. They found that the analyzed works focused on
individuals and their information source preferences and that HISB can be summarized
as ‘active or purposeful behavior undertaken by an individual with the objective of
finding information about health’ (Zimmerman & Shaw, 2020, p. 4). Low health
literacy is negatively related to the ability to evaluate online health information and
trust in online health information (Diviani et al., 2015). There also exist cultural
differences in information processing preferences for online health information. In
particular, Koreans and Hongkongers showed more trust in experience-based health
information sources and also reported using blogs and social networking sites more
frequently than Americans, who showed a stronger preference for using expertise-based
information sources (Song et al., 2016). Basch et al. (2018) found that females are more
likely to use the Internet for health information searches, but visit a doctor as well to be
sure about the diagnoses.

Credibility is a perceived quality that ‘doesn’t reside in an object, a person, or a
piece of information’ (Tseng & Fogg, 1999, p. 40). ‘In evaluating credibility, a person
assesses both trustworthiness and expertise to arrive at an overall credibility assessment’
(Tseng & Fogg, 1999, p. 40), while the trustworthiness dimension ‘captures the
perceived goodness or morality of the source’, and the expertise dimension ‘captures the
perceived knowledge and skill of the source’ (Tseng & Fogg, 1999, p. 40). For the
purpose of this study, we define credible or reliable information sources as
communication organs of scientific institutions and government agencies, scientific data
collections, and articles in scientific and media outlets that use an editorial system and
draw on such primary sources. This includes public state broadcasters (e.g. the ARD in
Germany or the ORF in Austria) and renowned international, national and local
newspapers (e.g. The New York Times or the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung),
including their social media channels. Accordingly, examples of not essentially reliable
sources would be privately owned broadcasting networks and privately run social
network sites. The categorization of government-related sources and public
broadcasting as reliable and privately owned broadcasting as not reliable is suited for
the situation in the German-speaking countries but cannot essentially be transferred to
every country in the world. In the German-speaking countries, the legally required
objective of public broadcasting is to make high-quality programs, supply good
information and involve people in a democratic culture, while privately owned
broadcasters focus on commercially attractive audience groups (Meijer, 2005).
Beck et al. (2014) found that 48.5% of the Web users aged 15–30 years used the
Internet for health purposes, and that approximately 80% of these young online healthseekers considered the information they found online reliable. Aoun et al. (2020) found
that, among Lebanese adults, 64.3% reported checking the Internet for health

information when they had acute symptoms. Jang and Baek (2019) studied how the
credibility of information from public health officials is associated with people’s
reliance on a particular communication channel in the context of the 2015 Middle East
Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak in South Korea. They found that less credible
information from public health officials led to more frequent use of online news,
interpersonal networks and social media for acquiring MERS-related information.
However, they found no relation between the credibility of information from public
health authorities and the use of television news or print newspapers.
The information needs of humans change during existential crises (Butenait et
al., 2016). Basic needs like safety and assurance of survival become relevant and will
change the content the humans seek. When basic needs are fulfilled, citizens want to
achieve other goals in their lives, but in a dangerous situation with many deaths, the
information needs focus on own safety, support for others and often the expression of
emotions. The changing information ecology requires that this emergency behavior is
studied in the context of recent crises. Studies have been conducted, for example, for the
Zika outbreak (Southwell et al., 2016) and the Tibet earthquake (Barnwal et al., 2019).
Research shows how people react when they need more information and how they try to
accommodate their needs for immediate action, but also for a better understanding of
the situation.
Liu et al. (2016) predicted social media use during disasters, based on a field
experiment simulating a hypothetical disaster. They found that upon initial exposure to
information about the disaster, the participants reported intentions to communicate
about it predominantly via interpersonal forms, such as telephone calls, face-to-face
conversations, texting and emailing, rather than through social media. They also found
that participants were significantly more likely to seek further disaster information via

TV after the information initially came from a national government web post. van der
Meer and Jin (2020) conducted an online experiment to seek a formula for
misinformation treatment in a public health crisis. They found that the presence of
corrective information leads to the debunking of incorrect beliefs based on
misinformation, and that government agency and news media sources are more
successful in improving belief accuracy compared to social peers. Sommerfeldt (2015)
examined how Haitians used information source repertoires to meet information
insufficiencies following the 2010 earthquake based on surveys. He found two different
repertoires of media: on the one hand a traditional repertoire of radio, TV, church and
word of mouth; and on the other, an elite repertoire of newspapers, the Internet, short
message service (SMS), billboards and the national police. People with higher education
were more likely to use the elite repertoires. Gender differences were also observed,
with men being more active in seeking.
For the current Covid-19 crisis, there have already been several data collections
curated (e.g. Chen et al., 2020; GESIS, 2020; Lamsal, 2020) and some first results of
data-oriented studies have been published (for a first overview see Siddique L. et al.,
2020). Information propagation on social media has revealed several interesting
preliminary results. A substantial amount of potentially incorrect information is being
disseminated during the Covid-19 crisis (Yang et al., 2020). Also, artificially created
information by bots is having an impact on the spread of misinformation (Ferrara,
2020). The amount of ethnic hate and aggressiveness has also increased, according to an
analysis by Stechemesser et al. (2020). However, studies do not look in detail into the
perceptions of individuals. There is a need to analyze the perspective of individuals to
see how they use different media and how they perceive their needs and behavioral
changes.

Methodology
Data on opinions and perspectives of individuals regarding their information behavior
during the Covid-19 crisis were gathered through an online questionnaire (Raab-Steiner
& Benesch, 2018). An online questionnaire was used due to the ease of distribution and
the possibility of reaching out to all German-speaking countries. It was expected that
during the lockdown people would be more open towards filling out surveys. The
questionnaire was implemented in the German language in LimeSurvey, hosted by the
University of Hildesheim.
The questionnaire consisted of several parts: At the beginning, the participants
were introduced to the aims of the study and asked to agree to the data privacy
statement. The data privacy statement informed participants that anonymity is assured,
how the collected data is being stored, who has access to the data, precautions for data
protection and the participants’ rights regarding the gathered data in accordance to the
European Data Protection Regulation. This was followed by questions on demographic
data, such as age and gender, whether the participants currently worked from home and
whether they thought they were part of a high-risk group for Covid-19. After that, they
were first asked whether they personally felt they were consuming more news during
the Covid-19 crisis. Second, they were asked how intensively they used various sources
of information (as listed in Table 2 within the results-section) at the time of
participation (during the Covid-19 crisis), how much they used the same sources before
the crisis and whether they were using any specific source that they had not consulted
before the crisis. Third, they were questioned on the basis of which specifically listed
criteria they were choosing their sources of information in the Covid-19 crisis. Fourth,
they were asked how satisfied they were with the supply of information about the crisis
and what were the main reasons for looking for information during the crisis. Fifth,

there was the opportunity to leave a general comment if they had noticed any other
changes in their media use and information and communication behavior since the
beginning of the crisis and there was the opportunity to add any further comments or
suggestions they might have regarding the study. Only the questions of the information
behavior section of the questionnaire were mandatory. According to German law this
non-interventional survey design did not require prior approval by the university ethics
committee. The regulations of the University of Hildesheim required the study to be
approved by the data protection officer. This approval was given.
The items were designed based on an extensive literature review. The aim was
to use existing items that have been already proven in terms of reliability. The items on
media use were adapted from Liu et al. (2016) and PwC (2018), and the criteria for
media usage adapted from Breunig and Hottmannspötter (2019).
Most questions allowed answers on a 7-point Likert scale, asking either for the
frequency (1: Daily; 2: Two or more times per week; 3: Once per week; 4: Two or more
times per month; 5: Once per month; 6: Less than once per month; 7: Never) or the
agreement (1: Applies to a great extent; 2; 3; 4: Neutral; 5; 6; 7: Does not apply at all).
There were also some open questions, allowing the participants to justify their answer
or to provide additional remarks.
Pretests were conducted to ensure a proper understandability, usability and
length of the online questionnaire. Three people were asked to complete the draft of the
questionnaire. Afterwards they were interviewed by phone. The participants were
chosen to represent different levels of age and education: a 26-year-old
female(university student); a 29-year-old male (university graduate working in the IT
sector); and a 54-year-old female (with no college education, working in consulting).

The findings from the pretest led to the reformulation of some items to enhance
understandability, e.g. the addition of examples for some information sources.
The questionnaire was initially promoted and distributed through mailing lists
within the German-speaking information science community and on social media
(Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn), where the authors initially shared the survey with their
personal profiles, and then it was later forwarded and retweeted by other users.
Additional support in the promotion was given by the media office of the University of
Hildesheim, which resulted in reports on the project and invitations to participate being
posted on the university website and in local and national media. The survey was
conducted from April 12, 2020 until May 17, 2020.
The acquired data were afterwards analyzed through Microsoft Excel and IBM
SPSS Statistics. As suggested by Sullivan and Artino (2013), means were computed for
the Likert-type scales. A Wilcoxon signed rank test was used for testing central
tendencies. Effect sizes (Cohen, 1988) were considered to support the interpretation.

Results
In total, 308 people participated in the online survey. Table 1 gives an overview of the
demographic data of the participants. Comparing the composition of the sample of
participants reporting working from home and viewing themselves as part of a high-risk
group for Covid-19 to the full sample shows only some noteworthy differences.
Participants reporting working from home were older, with more participants from the
group between 50 and 59 years of age (31%) and over 60 years of age (33%). They also
worked less from home during the crisis (36% vs. 22%), which might be due to the
higher age and thus a higher number of retirees in the sample.
[Table 1 near here]

Media Usage Behavior Regularly & During the Crisis
Of the total number of participants, 75% felt that overall they had consumed
more news and information since the beginning of the Covid-19 crisis. Table 2 provides
an overview of how the participants felt that their media use changed on a more detailed
basis. As can be seen, the most used channels during the crisis were online
communication with acquaintances and friends (M = 2.16, SD = 1.45), followed by
public television (M = 2.24, SD = 1.79), national newspapers (offline & online) (M =
2.51, SD = 1.90) and local newspapers (offline & online) (M = 3.06, SD = 2.14). In
contrast, the least used channels during the crisis were private television (M = 5.13, SD
= 2.23) and the social media channels Instagram (M = 5.08, SD = 2.57), Twitter (M =
4.93, SD = 2.66) and Facebook (M = 4.85, SD = 2.52).
A Wilcoxon signed rank test shows that the only channels that decreased highly
significantly were physical meetings and discussions (z = -11.47, p < .001). The effect
size (Cohen, 1988) was r = .65, which is a strong effect. No change is visible for the
social media channels YouTube, Facebook and Instagram. All other channels show at
least a significant increase. The highest increase (MDiff = 2.54), which is highly
significant (z = -11.47, p < .001), is visible for public organizations (like the Robert
Koch Institute and the Federal Office of Public Health). The effect size was r = .77,
which is a strong effect. A highly significant increase with a medium effect is also
shown for public television (z = -6.51, p < .001, r = .37), international sources (radio,
broadcast, newspaper) (z= -6.16, p < .001, r = .35), national newspapers (offline &
online) (z = -5.95, p < .001, r = .34), online communication with acquaintances and
friends (z = -5.62, p < .001, r = .32) and local newspapers (offline & online) (z = -4.38,
p < .001, r = .25). A significant increase with a small effect is shown for private
television (z = -2.99, p = .003, r = .17), Twitter (z = -2.89, p = .004, r = .16) and music

streaming and podcasts (z = -2.41, p = .016, r = .14). Thus, Twitter is the only social
media channel that saw a significant increase in use among the sample.
[Table 2 near here]
Figure 1 shows the distribution in percent for each of the items of the Likert
scale for the media channels with considerable changes during the Covid-19 crisis. As
can be seen, changes happened mainly between irregular users, who changed to daily
users, while non-users continued to stay away. The only deviation from this behavior
pattern is seen for public organizations, where the participants declaring to never use
them decreased from 44% to 8%, with almost 20% claiming to visit them daily during
the crisis.
[Figure 1 near here]
This part of the questionnaire closed with an optional open question: ‘What
specific source are you using now that you did not consult before the crisis?’ An answer
was provided by 255 participants. These answers are in accordance with the previously
reported development in media use: The most mentioned source was the German Robert
Koch Institute (92 mentions). The second most mentioned source was podcasts (51
mentions), especially those provided by the German public broadcasters NDR and RBB,
and also featuring the German virologist Christian Drosten. He was the third most
mentioned source (44 mentions). Fourteen participants reported using YouTube,
especially to watch the YouTube channel of the German public television ARD and
interviews with experts. Ten persons mentioned Twitter as an additional source, which
was described as being used to follow accounts of potential information sources, such as
virologists, medical journalists, local newspapers, the Robert Koch Institute, the Federal
Statistical Office or the Federal Office of Public Health.

Criteria for Choosing Information Sources
The participants were overall satisfied with the information supply during the crisis.
Eighty-four percent reported that they were satisfied, 4% were neutral and 12% were
unsatisfied. Figure 2 shows the reported criteria that were personally important when
choosing sources of information during the Covid-19 crisis. The most important factor
was credible information (M = 1.16, SD = .596), followed by journalistic quality (M =
1.39, SD = .84), interesting facts from research, history (M = 1.81, SD = 1.02),
information from official sources (M = 1.9, SD = 1.29), background information on
many topics (M = 2.28, SD = 1.2) and availability of topics from one’s own region (M =
2.44, SD = 1.39). The least important factor was knowing the author personally (M =
5.45, SD = 1.68), followed by good entertainment (M = 4.58, SD = 1.66), personal
recommendation (M = 4.31, SD = 1.77) and interesting for the whole family (M = 4.26,
SD = 1.87).
[Figure 2 near here]

Reasons for Information Seeking During the Covid-19 Crisis
Figure 3 gives an overview of the reasons for information seeking, as reported by the
participants. The most common motivation was to monitor the general situation, which
was stated by 96% of the participants. This was followed by gathering information on
economic and social aspects of the crisis (80%), obtaining information on movement
and travel restrictions (70%) and avoiding infection (59%). Only 4% of the participants
reported having actively avoided information and reports on Covid-19. Twenty-four
participants also stated other reasons through a text field. These answers included
following world affairs, gathering knowledge to support their own opinion-building,
concern for family, behavior suggestions and impact of the crisis on the personal level

as well as for society.
It also shows that, for participants counting themselves as being in a high-risk
group, personal health concerns (77%) and avoiding infection (79%) were considerably
more important, while information on economic and societal aspects of the crisis was of
less importance (72%). None of the participants counting themselves as being in a highrisk group reported having actively avoided information and reports on Covid-19.
[Figure 3 near here]

Further Changes in Media Use and Information and Communication Behavior
The questionnaire finished with an open question, providing the participants the
opportunity to describe any further changes in media use and their information and
communication behavior they might have noticed during the crisis. This opportunity
was used by 63% (n = 193) of the participants. Several participants reported a higher
frequency in media usage and information seeking. Most commonly described were
different variations of information overload. Participants reported that they were
overwhelmed with the amount of information, which led to a reduction in information
seeking after a phase of intense media use. Participants also described a feeling of
frustration through information overload. Some of them also reported avoiding specific
information sources, such as extended special editions of the evening news or live news
tickers with the newest developments, or a limited media use at specific time slots.
Other participants described information overload through a rise in social media use by
their friends, including the forwarding of videos and social media challenges, which
resulted in participants ignoring their messages. Some participants reported that they
consumed other media channels like newspapers solely by following their social media
appearance.

Participants also commonly reported that they reflect on information more
critically since the beginning of the Covid-19 crisis. Participants stated that they
actively compare information from different sources, prefer reliable information sources
and are aware of the circulation of Covid-19-related misinformation. Some participants
also described actively using foreign media to gain a broader view or actively reducing
social media channels where they perceive the information to be less reliable.
Participants also reported different changes in the intensity of their
communication – while some reported being much more in touch with their family and
friends due to increased spare time and video conferencing, others described having far
fewer social interactions.

Correlations of Reported Media Use and Age, Education and Usage Criteria
Table 3 gives an overview of correlations between the reported media use during the
Covid-19 crisis and criteria for choosing information sources with the age, education
and satisfaction with the information supply during the Covid-19 crisis. The results
show that the older the participants, the significantly more frequently they use local
newspapers (r = -.187, p = .001), public television (r = -.170, p = .003) and national
newspapers (r = -.112, p = .05) during the Covid-19 crisis. On the other hand, Instagram
(r = .324, p < .001), music streaming and podcasts (r = .247, p < .001) were used highly
significantly less frequently the older the participants, and YouTube (r = .197, p = .001)
and Facebook (r = .160, p = .005) significantly less frequently during the Covid-19
crisis. Between education and media use there is only a significant correlation for online
communication with acquaintances and friends (r = .113, p = .048). The higher the level
of completed education, the less frequently they used online communication with
acquaintances and friends. Highly significant correlations appear regarding the
satisfaction with the information supply during the Covid-19 crisis. Participants who

were less satisfied with the information supply during the Covid-19 crisis used public
television (r = .228, p < .001) and national newspapers (r = .208, p < .001) highly
significantly less frequently, and significantly less frequently information provided by
public organizations (r = .169, p = .003) and Twitter (r = .157, p = .006).
The results show further that the older the participants, the significantly more
important they consider knowing the author personally (r = -.156, p = .006), that the
information source is independent from state, politics and economy (r = -.144, p = .012)
and background information on many topics (r = -.123, p = .031). On the other hand,
the older the participants, the significantly less important they consider current live
information (r = .197, p = .001) and information from official sources (r = .161, p =
.005). The more highly educated the participants, the more highly significantly less
important they consider it to be that the content is interesting for the whole family (r =
.234, p < .001) and significantly less important that the information source is
independent from state, politics and economy (r = .173, p = .002), knowing the author
personally (r = .158, p = .005), personal recommendation of information sources (r =
.128, p = .025) and a low degree of advertisement (r = .121, p = .043).
Participants who were less satisfied with the information supply during the
Covid-19 crisis considered it highly significantly more important that all opinions can
be expressed (r = -.263, p < .001), that the information source is independent from state,
politics and economy (r = -.223, p < .001) and significantly more important to know the
author personally (r = -.160, p = .005), that the content is interesting for the whole
family (r = -.121, p = .033) and to have covered topics from the own region of residence
(r = -.120, p = .036). On the other hand, participants who were less satisfied with the
information supply during the Covid-19 crisis considered it significantly less important
that information is provided from official sources (r = .178, p = .002).

Discussion
The results confirm the initially described observation from global Internet traffic, that
the Covid-19 crisis has led to an increased demand for information. Seventy-five
percent of the participants in the survey described that, overall, they are consuming
more news and information since the beginning of the Covid-19 crisis.
As initially observed through the Alexa rankings for the German-speaking
countries and Google Trends, the demand increased for sources with reliable
information. Participants reported having used public organizations (like the Robert
Koch Institute and the Federal Office of Public Health), public television, international
sources (radio, broadcasting, newspapers), national newspapers and local newspapers
highly significantly more than before the crisis. This change happened – except for
public organizations – mainly among irregular users, who changed to daily users, while
non-users continued to stay away. The increasing demand for reliable information was
also shown by the criteria the participants reported as being personally important when
choosing sources of information during the Covid-19 crisis. The most important criteria
when choosing sources of information during this period were credible information,
followed by journalistic quality, interesting facts from research, and information from
official sources. Previous research has shown that Germans especially value public
broadcasters for their journalistic quality (Breunig & Hottmannspötter, 2019). As in the
longitudinal study on mass communication conducted by the German public
broadcasters ARD and ZDF (Frees et al., 2019), the data in this study also showed that
older participants used newspaper and television more frequently, but streaming
services and social media less so.

The results show that the most common motivation for information seeking was
to monitor the general situation, followed by gathering information on economic and
social aspects of the crisis, obtaining information on movement and travel restrictions
and how to avoid infection. Only 4% of the participants reported having actively
avoided information and reports on Covid-19. For participants counting themselves as
being in a high-risk group for Covid-19, personal health concerns and avoiding
infection were considerably more important, while information on economic and
societal aspects of the crisis were less so. Some participants reported a feeling of
information overload, which resulted in a reduction of information seeking and media
use or limiting the use to specific times of the day only. Such information avoidance as
a result of information overload was previously described by Lee et al. (2017).
Comparing the results of this study to previous findings from research on
disasters and public health emergencies, it shows that similarly to the Zika virus
outbreak in 2016 (Southwell et al., 2016), information seeking grew when the Covid-19
pandemic began reaching the German-speaking countries and was thus increasingly
covered by news outlets. However, in contrast to the field experiment by Liu et al.
(2016) simulating a hypothetical disaster, participants did not react by predominantly
communicating via interpersonal forms, but instead turned primarily to traditional,
reliable public broadcasters and information sources. This differs from the health
information seeking behavior in everyday situations, where the Internet plays an
important role and online sources are trusted as being reliable (Aoun et al., 2020; Beck
et al., 2014). However, the Covid-19 pandemic cannot be completely compared to an
unexpected disaster where interpersonal communication and social media might be the
only available information sources in the immediate time after the event. In contrast to
Jang and Baek (2019), who found that people in South Korea used online news,

interpersonal networks and social media after receiving less credible information from
public health authorities during the MERS outbreak, such an effect could not be seen
within this sample. Social networks were reported to be among the least important
information sources during the Covid-19 crisis.
However, the vast majority (84%) of the participants reported being satisfied
with the information supply during the Covid-19 crisis. Participants who were less
satisfied with the information supply during the Covid-19 crisis used reliable sources
significantly less frequently, specifically public television, national newspapers and
information provided by public organizations. This group considered it significantly less
important that information is provided from official sources, but instead considered it
significantly more important that all opinions can be expressed, that the information
source is independent from state, politics and economy and to know the author of the
information personally.
As information ecology is constantly changing, the Covid-19 pandemic is the
first global pandemic to take place in the current information environment, with all the
new possibilities of the Internet, such as easier access to global information and usercreated content in social media. The results confirm that traditional media channels
continue to play an important role in the situation of a crisis, where the increased
demand for reliable information in the German-speaking countries runs alongside
increased use of reliable information sources like public broadcasters. This underpins
the importance of these institutions, particularly in the situation of a crisis.
This work comes with several limitations, which in turn provide avenues for
future research: First, the sample size of the study of only 308 participants from the
German-speaking countries is not representative for the whole population in these
countries. The sample includes an especially high number of participants with a

university degree. However, as the results resemble usage patterns from previous
studies based on representative samples (Breunig & Hottmannspötter, 2019; Frees et al.,
2019), specifically the more frequent use of newspapers and television and less frequent
use of streaming services and social media by older users, it can be assumed that the
results bear some generalizability. Second, the applied survey could only find the
subjective perception of the participants, which might not fully reflect their actual
behavior. Third, as the questionnaire was online for several weeks, there might also
have been changes during the duration of the survey due to the high dynamic of the
crisis, for example the main topics of interest for seeking Covid-19-related information
might have shifted during the survey period. Fourth, as the answers to the open
questions have shown, some participants consume media outlets such as newspapers or
television solely by following their social media channels. While the questionnaire used
in this study did distinguish between the most common social media services in the
German-speaking countries, it did not ask in detail which content is consumed through
social media. This shows the need to use more differentiated questions regarding social
media use in future studies.
Due to the global scale of the Covid-19 pandemic, future research might be
extended to further countries and languages. As the Covid-19 crisis continues, it will
also be of interest to see how the crisis impacts information behavior in the long term.
