Abstract— coronavirus becomes officially a global pandemic due to the speed spreading
off in various countries. An increasing number of infected with this disease causes the
Inability problem to fully care in hospitals and afflict many doctors and nurses inside the
hospitals. This paper proposes a smart health system that monitors the patients holding the
Coronavirus remotely. Due to protect the lives of the health services members (like
physicians and nurses) from infection. This smart system observes the people with this
disease based on putting many sensors to record many features of their patients in every
second. These parameters include measuring the patient's temperature, respiratory rate,
pulse rate, blood pressure, and time. The proposed system saves lives and improves
making decisions in dangerous cases. It proposes using artificial intelligence and Internetof-things to make remotely quarantine and develop decisions in various situations. It
provides monitoring patients remotely and guarantees giving patients medicines and
getting complete health care without anyone getting sick with this disease. It targets two
people's slides the most serious medical conditions and infection and the lowest serious
medical conditions in their houses. Observing in hospitals for the most serious medical
cases that cause infection in thousands of healthcare members so there is a big need to
uses it. Other less serious patients slide, this system enables physicians to monitor
patients and get the healthcare from patient's houses to save places for the critical cases in
hospitals.

I. INTRODUCTION
Recently, coronavirus (COVID 19) becomes a pandemic virus that patients reach
more than 1.856.798 around the world [1]. In April 2020, the death numbers from
this virus reach 114.312 around the world [1, 2]. The percentage of deaths

achieves more than 18% daily. The spreading of infected people and deaths
numbers are increasing daily. Most people are affected by patients are healthcare
members whether doctors or nurses. The recent statistics of the infected
healthcare members in doctors and nurses reach more than 65.000 [3]. Thousands
of them die from the infection of patients holding coronavirus in serving
healthcare in hospitals.
So, there is a big need to go forward the remote healthcare especially in the
highly infected viruses such as COVID 19 to save lives. Remotely healthcare
monitoring requires multiple sensors to record the parameter of each case in realtime to improve the healthcare services in speed time and decision making
remotely [4]. The smart healthcare system relies on the integration between
artificial intelligence and internet-of-things technologies.
Previous research target are monitoring the patient in various diseases such as
debates, diets, and after surgical operations. They enable physicians to observe
multiple patients at the same time. That eases the system to be highly flexible,
and accurate. The used sensors are variant types whether wearable or built-in
sensors or mobile sensors [5]. These systems require interpreting the extracted
data from these sensors to reach the main objective.
This paper presents the EQuarantine system that is a proposed smart Health
System for monitoring coronavirus patients for remote quarantine. It becomes
important to save thousands of lives from infection or death. It is based on fused
multiple data from various sensors to detect the degree of development of the
disease and the seriousness of the health condition. It is based on monitoring the
readings' heart pulse, respiratory rate, blood pressure, Blood PH level in realtime. It proposes to be a time-series data that includes sequenced data points in a
time domain. The data extracted from multiple sensors are gathered sequentially
based on multi-variable measurements. It proposes a classification of patient's
cases. It also targets observing multiple users concurrently. The proposed
technique will be constructed based on the combination of fusion types, feature
level, and decision level. It will rely on the long-short term memory (LSTM)
technique that is considered a deep neural network (DNN) technique for
sequenced data. It uses the power of feature learning ability and improves the
classification of serious health condition levels. Then using the Dempster-Shafer
fusion technique for fusion decision.
The proposed system enables monitoring patients from their homes that save
governmental cost and time through measuring the changes in patient's medical
readings. It will serve humanity in the reduction of Coronavirus infection and
save healthcare members around the world. It also saves hospital places for
emergency cases.

The rest of the paper is organized as the following: Section II, related works,
section III, the dangers of Coronavirus, section IV, the proposed smart health
system, section V, experiments and results. Finally, section VI targets the
conclusion outlines and future works.

RELATED WORKS AND BACKGROUND

Several motivations research and investment in the smart health systems or
telehealth systems that are simulated real system for observing or following
diseases remotely whether in hospitals or patient's homes [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11].
These motivations target saving lives, time and cost. The main objective of smart
health is remotely controlling for many patients and monitoring their diseases
follow in real-time.
The essential challenge in smart health is interpreting, fusing and visualizing
big data extracted from multiple smart devices or sensors. It improves the making
of decision quality for medical systems. The data are collected from sensors to
observe patients remotely at their houses. These data are applied by the
aggregation and statistical ways for the decisions of the medical system.
a. Smart health
Smart health is a hot area of research and industry which includes a
connection between sensors deals with the patients. It can provide monitoring of
the remote patient through several ways as video, audio or text. The main
problem of this area how to manage the data, analytics them and visualize the
reports of the data. This section presents a comparative study of several previous
researches on smart health. It includes a combination of artificial intelligence and
machine learning algorithms that will support high results of prediction and
evaluation of the patient's problems.
Previous researches present several smart health motivations for constructing a
suitable system for observing patients based on each medical case as shown in
Table (1). Researchers in [6], build graphical smart health system for visualizing
patient's data for remotely physicians. Noisy data and redundant features become
the main limitations are faced with this system. Researchers in [7], present a new
smart health system with high accuracy for observing patients after surgeries.
This system requires medical experts and huge analysis from doctors to support
the full vision for each case. Researchers in [8], improves the monitoring patients
remotely with accuracy 9%. They face several limitations in reliability and
integrity. Researchers in [9, 10, 11], build smart medical system for hospitals to
be powerful in monitoring patient's cases. However, it still requires motivation for
enhancing accuracy.

From previous motivations, finding to construct any smart health system requires
to know all conditions, and some expert knowledge to make observing
automatically and detect the important readings or anomalies for each patient.
That requires supervised training to support any new cases and detect problems.
Data visualization for the extracted patient's data is very important to save time
and lives simultaneously. Data visualization refers to one of the main fields of
Big Data analytics that enables end-users to analyze, understand, and extract
insights.

b. Deep learning technology
The essential idea of deep learning depends on the artificial neural networks
(ANNs) study [12]. ANNs are a new trend for the active research fields due to
building a standard neural network (NN). It uses neurons for producing realvalued activations and, by adjusting the weights, the NNs behave as expected.
The approaches of deep learning have been utilized powerfully in big data
analysis for various applications and targets [13]. They use for analyzing the
computer vision, pattern recognition, speech recognition, natural language
processing, and recommendation systems. There is a trade-off between the
accuracy measurements and the complexity when applying the deep learning
algorithms. These approaches include several types as a convolutional neural
network (CNN), recurrent neural network (RNN), and [14]. Long Short-Term
Memory Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM-RNN) is one of the most powerful
dynamic classifiers publicly known.
c. Data fusion process
It is considered a framework where data from multiple sources are gathered,
mixed aggregated to make them more powerful and more adapted to a given
application. Data fusion means the process to reach higher efficiency results to
deal with multiple and heterogeneous data sources. There are different types of
patient-doctor communication video, audio or text message through remote IoT
devices or mobile sensors for computing bio-physical characteristics. In smart
health systems, a system is responsible for measuring the effective requirement of
therapy or other health-related issues only considering interviews and data
gathered at the patient home.

THE DANGEROUS OF CORONAVIRUS

COVID-19 is inherited from previous viruses (as SARS) but the evolution
of this virus becomes more dangerous and higher spreading. Although COVID-19
is less dangerous than SARS on most people, it is a higher infection between
people. Compared with other viruses in 2003 and 2012 [23, 24], they are limited

to some areas and took limited time. The research motivations predict each new
COVID-19 case infects 2.5 other people on average when no effort is made to
keep people apart [25]. Coronaviruses are jumping increasingly from animals to
humans, creating new threats.

The new coronavirus has killed nearly 3 times as many people in 8 weeks as
SARS did in 8 months [26]. Table (3) disuses the comparative study between
COVID-19 and Sars in several dimensions. The main reason for the dangers of
this virus is a bad impact on respiratory disease. That is caused by increasing
high-risk cases by 20 percent of patients and killing more than 3 percent of
confirmed cases. Sars is caused by killing 10 percent of infected patients. Older
people, whose immune defenses have declined with age, as well as those with
underlying health conditions, are much more vulnerable than the young [27].
However, death rates are hard to estimate in the early stages of an epidemic and
rely on the medical care given to patients. Lack of healthcare equipment cause

killing people due to this virus has a bad effect on breath and respiratory rate. For
instance, ventilators protect lives by causing pneumonia to breathe.
IV.

THE PROPOSED SMART HEALTH SYSTEM FOR CORONAVIRUS

The proposed smart Health System aims at monitoring coronavirus patients for
remotely quarantine. It targets saving thousands of lives from infection or death.
It depends on the integration between artificial intelligence and internet-of-things
for fusing multiple sensory data from various medical sensors to detect the degree
of development of the disease and the seriousness of the health condition. The
proposed system improves decision making quickly and simultaneously. Figure
(1) shows the big image of the proposed smart health system for monitoring
infected coronavirus remotely based on Internet-of-Things devices

Figure.1 The proposed smart health system for monitoring infected coronavirus
remotely based on Internet-of-Things devices

It is based on monitoring the reading's heart pulse, respiratory rate, and blood
pressure, Blood PH level in real-time. Figure (1) presents the proposed smart
health system based on the communication between IoT devices in a network.
This consists of three tiers: tier1 deals with the different sensors connected by the
patient such as in mobile, wearable, IoT devices, or accumulators' sensors for
measuring the patient evolution case (as blood pressure). Tier 2 the fusion
between the data in multi-sources mostly in different multimedia. The tier3 the
visualization and deciding for emergency cases, making profiling for each case,
and how to predict the next problem for each patient.

It proposes to be a time-series data that includes sequenced data points in a
time domain. The data extracted from multiple sensors are gathered sequentially
based on multi-variable measurements. It proposes a classification of patient's
cases. It also targets observing multiple users concurrently. The proposed
technique will be constructed based on the combination between the fusion
feature level and fusion decision level. It will rely on the long-short term memory
(LSTM) technique that is considered a deep neural network (DNN) technique for
sequenced data [28]. It uses the power of feature learning ability and improves
classification serious health condition level. Then using the Dempster-Shafer
fusion technique for fusion decision [29].
a. Architecture life cycle
The proposed system enables monitoring patients from their homes that save
governmental cost and time through measuring the changs in the patient's medical
readings. It will serve humanity in the reduction of Coronavirus infection and
save healthcare members around the world. It also saves hospital places for
emergency cases. The life cycle of smart health technique includes six main
layers, cleaning data layer, anomaly detection layer, extracting features based on
deep learning, LSTM deep learning layer, and fusion layer as shown in the
lifecycle in Figure (2).

Figure 2: The lifecycle architecture of the proposed system

The architecture of the smart health technique consists of the main six layers,
cleaning data, feature extraction layer, deep learning techniques, fusion layer a
shown in Figure (2).
The first layer, cleaning the data layer uses for pre-processing time-series
data. the second layer includes anomaly detection controlling for observing and
recording any changes in the data such as outliers or errors. The importance of
this layer appears in neglecting the context or domain and focusing on the main
three dimensions data types, major features, and anomalies to unify the technique
in any domain. Third layer, the feature extraction layer refers to the automated
extracting features from any context. However, not all features are important and
require fusing for the target. so, that requires feature reduction or ignorance of
some features before the fusion process. The fourth layer, Deep learning
algorithm that is based on the input data type. The deep neural model is
constructed based on target and features. The fifth layer, the Fusion layer refers to
fuse multiple data from multiple sensors. This layer manages the fusion process
based on three dimensions the input data types, features, and anomalies in input
data.
b. The hybrid health system Algorithm
The proposed algorithm is a hybrid fusion technique between feature fusion
level and decision fusion level concerning determining anomalies to improve
decision making quickly and simultaneously. The hybrid technique is illustrated
in making a decision based on extracting new features from the data and fusing
the decisions from tracing in each sensor. The proposed system enables to
classify patients in the risk level and make decisions concurrently. It also predicts
each patient's evolution case based on a remote monitoring process.
The algorithm includes the main six layers.
(1) Cleaning data layer: The nature of time-series data usually includes
several noisy data or missing data. So, this layer targets ensuring the
quality of the input data that ignoring missing data, determining error
readings, filtering anomalies or fixing structural errors. It also
determines the duplicate observations and ignores irrelevant
notifications. This layer is very important to make the system highly
reliable. The steps of this layer are:
-

Check on empty records, or terms in each cell.
Check on duplicate records
Check on noisy data
Check on unstructured data to convert the suitable structure for the dataset.

(2) Anomaly detection layer: The previous layer can filter anomalies or
readings errors [30]. These anomalies mean identification rare events
that are happening and affected on other observations. They usually
require making decisions quickly and concurrently. This layer classifies
anomalies to improve the prediction analysis of patient's cases.
Algorithm (1) describes the main steps of anomaly detection.

(3) Features level: The feature extraction layer or feature engineering layer
refers to the interaction between extraction features [31]. It deletes
redundant and unused features. The extracted features are medical and
require expert knowledge. The combination of the two features can
interpret a new feature for improving results and decision making.
Heart rate and respiratory rate are the significant keys to estimate the
physiological state of people in several clinical properties [32, 33]. They are
utilized as the main assessment in acutely sick children, as well as in those
undergoing more intensive monitoring in high dependency. The heart rate and
respiratory rate are important values utilized to detect responses to lifesaving
interventions. Heart rate and respiratory rate keep an integral part of the standard
clinical estimation of people or children presenting. The emergency cases will be
classified based on the outranges of these parameters. The previously computed
median of the representative centiles (1st, 10th, 25th, 75th, 90th, 99th) for the
data from each included study. Finding each age has a different normal range of

(4) Predication Layer for each patient's case evolution: Artificial
intelligent technique is used for monitoring patients and their case
evolution. Long-short term memory (LSTM) is a deep learning
technique for sequenced data [32]. This layer is based on LSTM
to predict the future case for each patient based on previous
disease readings.
(5) Fusion layer: There are several fusion techniques but this research
applies the Dempster-Shafer fusion [33]. Fusion process contains the
following steps:
Algorithm (3): Dempster-Shafer Fusion Technique

This combining rule can be generalized by iteration: if we treat mj not as sensor Sj’s
notification, but rather as the already fused by Dempster-Shafer theory notification of
sensor Sk and sensor S.

(6) Visualization layer: The Fusion output constructs a full vision for patient
cases based on extracted sensory data for each patient. The physicians
may be finding a hardness in readings hundreds of patients concurrently.
So, visualizing data is a very important layer to classify the serious
condition level for patients (high risk, medium, low) that may use colors
(for example, red color for high-risk cases, yellow for medium risk
cases, green for the normal rate or low-risk cases) to getting attention
from doctors quickly to improving decision making simultaneously and
quickly in Figure (3).

(7) Output: That includes colorized and classified data for all patients for
each observer doctor. It also includes a detailed sheet for the evolution
of each patient and the prediction risk of their patients.

EXPERIMENT & RESULTS

The recent governmental motivations go forward to reach high benefits
from smart health. It also starts collecting real data concurrently for saving health
members' lives and saving patients.
a. Dataset
The proposed system targets multiple sensors or IoT devices to record patients
in quarantine in Figure (4). It improves healthcare working due to the lack of
healthcare equipment and reduces infection between healthcare members. The
proposed fusion technique for the real dataset that covers the real datasets, the
input dataset of Coronavirus quarantine is a modified dataset from the input data
as shown in Table (4).

Figure.4: The proposed Smart Health System

The training dataset is based on the collected several real datasets for normal and
patients. The fusion process is very critical between multiple sensory data to
reach the full vision of the corona disease level. The fusion technique depends on
fusing many features of coronavirus that includes heart pulse, respiratory rate,
body temperature, blood pressure, and Blood PH level in real-time. They are the
main features in fusion process in Figure (5). The fusion technique targets

improving the prediction of the disease features and protecting patients' and
healthcare members' lives.

of sensory data for patients (refer to Table (4)) in terms of the real normal ranges
for normal people as shown in Table (5). These modifications include two steps,
data augmentation and generated time. The data will be enlarged to 700.000
records by observing each patient into the previous 10 hours to support predicting
the next case rate and save lives before sudden actions in the "cardiovascular
dataset". These data set is fused with the real ranges of Blood PH level and body

b. Experiments
The processing technique includes six layers, that are applied as the
following.
The proposed E-Quarantine system uses A long short-term memory network
(LSTM) twice times, first using for detecting anomalies and for predicting the
evolution case of each patient based on previous disease profile. LSTM is
considered an evolution from recurrent neural network technique. The LSTM
technique is very powerful for classifying sequential data. The most common way
to making training on RNN is based on a backpropagation with time. However,
the main challenge of the vanishing gradients is usually a reason for the

parameters to take short-term dependencies while the information from earlier
time-steps decays. The reverse issue, exploding gradients may be a reason for
occurring the error to develop drastically with each time step.
LSTM is applied to the real dataset in a deep learning layer. An LSTM layer
learns long-term dependencies between time steps in time-series and sequence
data. The layer performs additive interactions, which can support improving
gradient flow over long sequences during training.
To forecast the values of future time steps of a sequence, the training of the
sequenced data regression based on the LSTM network. For each time step of the
input sequence, the LSTM network learns to forecast the estimation value of the
next time step.
c. Results
The flowchart in Figure (4) is applied in this experiment for predicting
the emergency cases of patients. Figure (6) presents a sample of predictive
analysis for future data and time about 700.000 records concerning historical

Figure 6: LSTM neural network training with 100 hidden layers with 150 epochs

data. It applies the LSTM. The predictive analytics output includes continuous
variables that are entitled a regression in Figure (7). An LSTM regression
network was trained with 150 epochs; the LSTM layer contained 100 hidden
units.

This technique avoids the gradient explosion problem that is happening in
artificial neural networks training data and backpropagation. The gradient
condition was set to 1. The initial learning rate was set to 0.005 and then
minimized after 150 epochs by multiplying by 0.2. LSTM network was trained
with the specified training choices. Then the real measurements of the time
proceedings between predictions are recognized, then the network state is updated
with the observed values in the state the predicted values.
Resetting the network state prohibits prior predictions from affecting
predictions on the new data. Thus, the network state is reset and then initialized
by forecasting the training data. Predictions are made for each time step. For each
forecast, the following time step values are predicted based on the observed
values at the prior time step.

Figure.7: The predictive analysis of the data into a row vector

The 'Execution-Environment' option was set to 'predict-And-UpdateState' using the 'CPU'. Non-standardized predictions were made utilizing the
parameters evaluated earlier; then, the root-mean-square error (RMSE) was
computed (as shown in equation 1).
The results of prediction achieve greater accuracy when the network
state is edited with the notified values rather than the predicted values. Update
Network State with Observed Values: When the existing values of the time steps
between predictions are available, then the network state can be updated with the
observed values instead of the predicted estimations. Then, the predicted values
are compared with the test data. Figure (8) illustrates a comparison between the

forecasted values and the test data. Figure (9) examines the forecasting with
updates with RMSE =1.3.

Figure.8: A Comparison between the forecasted values and the test data.

The x-axis that has been processed what the target shows that refers to
the input data, so the constructed neural network has only one step of input data
and it has seen 100 times and it has seen 500 steps of input data.

The summarized dataset interprets the results of number rates into ranges
rates to make tracing easier. These results include risk levels (high, medium,
low). These level drives doctors to make a suitable decision quickly and
simultaneously (as shown in Table (6) and (7)). For examples, the patients reach
to the high-risk level must go to the hospital if it is due the respiratory rate is high
that must put them on a ventilator and requires making lung CT, if it is due the
blood PH level that requires to take medicine and follow the Blood acidity if it is
due the heart rate or body temperature, or blood pressure, taking medicine with
Antiviral or Anti-malaria with Antipyretic.

The proposed system targets two essential objectives, monitoring infected
patients remotely that are not high risk to avoid reaching high risk and predicting
the next level of risk of each patient to protect their levels and taking decisions

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK

This paper presents the E-Quarantine system for monitoring infected patients with
coronavirus remotely that uses for reducing infection and save hospital's places
and equipment for high-risk patients only. The essential objectives of the EQuarantine system that simulates the Quarantine for patients in their houses to
monitor patients and classify the patients based on observing disease risks. The
proposed system E-Quarantine monitors the patient's case flow and predicts the
emergency cases around 24 hours by 98.7% based on the supervised previous
data. It is based on five parameters, blood PH level, heart rate, blood pressure,
body temperature, and respiratory rate. The proposed hybrid fusion is based on a
hybrid of feature fusion level and decision fusion level that improves the accuracy
results that reach 98.7%. Finding a Dempster-Shafer technique is more powerful
in sequenced data than images or videos. The fusion technique is applied to
sequenced data for patients and their respiratory sounds. For future work, the
proposed system requires higher flexibility to be adaptive with multiple data
types to improve the results of each patient.
