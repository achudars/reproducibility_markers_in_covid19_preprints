Abstract
We report the results of our study of approved drugs as potential treatments for COVID-19, based
on the application of various bioinformatics predictive methods. The drugs studied include
chloroquine, ivermectin, remdesivir, sofosbuvir, boceprevir, and α-difluoromethylornithine
(DMFO). Our results indicate that these small molecules selectively bind to stable, kinetically
active residues and residues adjoining them on the surface of proteins and inside protein pockets
and that some prefer hydrophobic over other active sites. Our approach is not restricted to viruses
and can facilitate rational drug design, as well as improve our understanding of molecular
interactions, in general.

Introduction
The Coronaviridae positive stranded RNA virus family includes a substantial number of members,
many of whom are known to cause a broad range of illnesses from common cold to sever
diseases like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome
(MERS), etc. [1, 2]. The latest worldwide rapidly spreading disease, COVID-19, is caused by a
new member of this virus family, SARS-COV-2. The disease originally emerged in China in
December 2019 with most common symptoms being fever and cough, as well as shortness of
breath, sore throat, headache, muscles ache, nausea, and diarrhea [1]. In some cases symptoms
also involve a still unexplained loss of smell and taste [3]. It is assumed that the SARS-COV-2
virus spreads through respiratory droplets, directly via physical contact, or through contact with
contaminated objects, and can severely affect patients with immune systems weakened by preexisting conditions, such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus or cardiovascular diseases [4]. The
virus spreads more easily than SARS and MERS due to high binding affinity between the virus
spike glycoprotein (S) and the host receptor [5-8], making it more deadly. By forcing countries to
restrict access to work and thus slowing down supply lines the virus directly affects the global
economy, which experiences a significant decline in gross national products worldwide not
encountered since the Great depression.
There are a number of efforts and clinical trials underway to develop a vaccine and evaluate
potential drugs for COVID-19, but such investigations usually take many months or even years to
yield a successful treatment. Drug repurposing, on the other hand, may offer an immediate
solution, because it considers already approved compounds as potential treatments for
COVID-19. There are two paths toward a viral treatment. One path directly attacks the virus and
1

interrupts its replication machinery or its ability to attack host cells [9]. This path is often hard to
implement due to rapid emergence of new viral strains with acquired resistance to implemented
drugs. The second path should therefore aim to block the host-viral interactions on the host side
due to difficulties viral single point mutations should have in recovering the loss of host factors
[10]. A recent study of human-virus protein-protein interactions (PPIs) detected 332 highconfidence SARS-CoV-2-human PPIs [11]. The study showed that 40% of SARS-CoV-2 proteins
interact with endomembrane compartments or vesicle trafficking pathways, and that viral proteins
also interact with multiple innate immune pathways, the host translation machinery, bromodomain
proteins, enzymes involved in ubiquitination regulation, and Cullin ubiquitin ligase complex.
Importantly, it showed that the SARS-COV-2 human PPI map is very similar to the interaction
maps of West Nile Virus (WNV) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Among the human
proteins involved in interactions with viral proteins, the study detected 66 druggable human (host)
proteins targeted by 69 compounds (29 FDA-approved drugs, 12 drugs in clinical trials, and 28
preclinical compounds). It identified two groups of compounds with noticeable antiviral activity:
inhibitors of mRNA translation/protein biogenesis (zotatifin, ternatin-4, PS3061, and plitidepsin),
and predicted regulators of the Sigma1 and Sigma2 receptors (Haloperidol, PB28, PD-144418,
Hydroxychloroquine, Clemastine, Cloperastine, Progesterone, and the clinical molecule
Siramesine). The first group of compounds directly affects the viral cap-dependent mRNA
translation because coronaviruses use the host translation machinery for their own mRNA
translation. The compounds affecting the second group of proteins are approved and long
established human therapeutics [11]. As much as they are informative, such screening
associative studies rarely offer detailed insights into mechanisms of molecular interactions,
whereas structural studies [5-8, 12] give snapshots into residue and atom level physical
interactions between molecules, but cannot offer general principles of molecular interactions.
In-silico studies are widely used to screen potential drug candidates against Covid-19. Recently,
Calligari et al. reported a molecular docking study binding affinities between different viral proteins
and several inhibitors, originally developed for other viral infections (HCV, HIV) [13]. The
examined drugs include Simeprevir, Saquinavir, Indinavir, Tipranavir, Faldaprevir, Ritonavir,
Lopinavir, Asunaprevir, Atazanavir, Nelfinavir, Amprenavir, Darunavir and Fosamprenavir. They
docked them with the 3C-like protease from SARS–CoV-2, the spike S SARS-Cov-2 protein,
SARS-Cov-2 RdRp, and nucleocapsid protein from SARS-Cov-2, and reported the
crorresponding binding free energies. The authors were able to select 5 of the 13 as potential
inhibitors of SARS-Cov-2 protease. The three drugs tested with the Spike S protein showed
promise and one presumably binds between the two monomers and interrupts transition between
opened and closed states. A.A. Elfiky used molecular modeling, docking, and dynamics
simulations to build a model for the viral RdRp proteins and test its binding affinity to some
clinically approved drugs and drug candidates [14]. The author concludes that sofosbuvir,
ribavirin, galidesivir, remdesivir, favipiravir, cefuroxime, tenofovir, and hydroxychloroquine can
tightly bind to the RdRp active site and can be good candidates for clinical trials. The author also
noticed that the compounds setrobuvir, YAK, and IDX-184 can tightly wrap to the SARS-CoV-2
RdRp, and thus interrupt its function. That study also showed the IDX-184 derived compounds
(3,5-dihydroxyphenyl)oxidanyl and (3-hydroxyphenyl)oxidanyl can be effectively used to target
SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. Yu et al. used AutoDock Vina software to screen potential drugs by
molecular docking with the structural protein and non-structural protein sites of Covid-19 virus
[15]. They tested ribavirin, remdesivir, chloroquine, and luteolin, a compounds present in
Honeysuckle. In traditional Chinese medicine honeysuckle is generally believed to have antiviral
effects. In this study, luteolin (the main flavonoid in honeysuckle) was found to bind with a high
affinity to the same sites of the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 as the control molecule. De Oliveira
et al. tested 9091 drug candidates by molecular docking against equilibrated SARS-Cov-2 Spike
S protein [16]. 24 best-scored ligands, ivermectin among them, 14 of them are traditional herbal
2

isolates and 10 are approved drugs, exhibited binding energies below -8.1 kcal/mol, and were
thus suggested as potential candidates. O. Santos-Filho used molecular docking to test HIV
protease inhibitors against Covid-19 main protease [17]. The author’s study showed that two nonnatural compounds, danoprevir and lopinavir, and one herbal compound, corilagin, produced
strong interactions with the inhibitor binding site of SARS-CoV-2 main protease. A modeling study
by Pachetti et al. recognized a number of Covid-19 RdRp mutations that can affect drug
treatments against Covid-19 RdRp [18]. B. R Beck et al. used pre-trained deep neural network to
identify commercially available drugs that could be used as treatments against SARS-CoV-2 [19].
They showed that atazanavir, an antiretroviral medication used to treat and prevent the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), is the best compound against the SARS-CoV-2 3C-like proteinase,
followed by remdesivir, efavirenz, ritonavir, dolutegravir, lopinavir and darunavir.
To facilitate the drug screening we undertook a comparative in-silico study of binding modes of
six antiviral candidate drugs. We analyzed compounds that bind to parasitic and to human
proteins. We use those results to anticipate their binging affinities. The drugs we have studied so
far include (hydroxyl)chloroquine, ivermectin, remdesivir, sofosbuvir, boceprevir, and αdifluoromethylornithine (DMFO) (see Table 1).
Chloroquine [20] and its less toxic derivative hydroxychloroquine [21] are drugs used to
prevent and treat acute attacks of malaria. They are also used to treat discoid or systemic lupus
erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis in patients whose symptoms have not improved with other
treatments. These drugs are subject of a number of clinical trials worldwide as potential treatment
for Covid-19 [22, 23]. Interestingly, the above mentioned study [11] shows that PB28 is ~20 times
more potent viral inhibitor than hydroxychloroquine.
Ivermectin is a medication used to treat many various types of parasite infestations [24]. They
include, but are not limited to, head lice, scabies, river blindness (onchocerciasis),
strongyloidiasis, trichuriasis, ascariasis, and lymphatic filariasis. Depending on the kind of
treatment, the drug is taken by mouth or applied to the skin for external infestations. Ivermectin
molecular structure is rather complex and made of a set of macrocyclic lactone isomers.
Ivermectin binds to glutamate-gated chloride channels and increases the permeability of chloride
ions. The drug was shown to inhibit the replication of SARS-COV-2 in vitro [25] and is currently
the subject of clinical trials as a potential COVID-19 treatment [26].
Remdesivir is a nucleoside analog RNA-dependent RNA Polymerase (RdRp) inhibitor initially
developed to treat Ebola and Marburg virus diseases [9, 27]. The drug decreases the viral RNA
production by affecting the function of RdRp and proofreading by viral exoribonuclease (ExoN).
Remdesivir is a subject of clinical trials as a potential COVID-19 treatment [28], as it was shown
to reduce the lung viral load and improve pulmonary function with SARS infection [9].
Sofosbuvir is a medication used to treat HCV mono-infection and HCV/HIV-1 coinfection as
component of a combination antiviral regimen [29]. Sofosbuvir is nucleotide prodrug that
metabolically gets modified to the active uridine analog triphosphate, an inhibitor of HCV NS5B
RNA-dependent polymerase. The inhibition of HCV NS5B RNA-dependent polymerase in turn
suppresses viral replication. A. Sadeghi presented a tentative results on the effectiveness of
sofosbuvir and daclatasvir agains Covid-19 [30].
Boceprevir is a medication used to treat chronic hepatitis C in untreated people or who do not
react to ribavirin and peginterferon alfa alone [31]. It is used in combination with ribavirin

3

(Copegus, Rebetol) and peginterferon alfa (Pegasys). It was shown to inhibit the Covid-19 (SARSCov-2) replication by inhibiting the virus main protease [32].
α-difluoromethylornithine (DMFO) (Eflornithine), is a medication primary used to treat African
trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness) and excessive facial hair in women [33]. Specifically, it is
used for the second stage of sleeping sickness caused by T. b. gambiense and may be used with
nifurtimox [34]. It is used by injection or applied to the skin. The drug prevents binding of the
natural product ornithine to the active site of ornithine decarboxylase. We did not find any record
of this drug ever being tried, so far, for COVID-19. However, since it is a halogenated organic
molecule with somehow similar active sites as Chloroquine we decided to study it towards
treatment of COVID-19.
Here we report our research findings based on the method which we have implemented to
recognize protein-protein binding patterns, the Self-Adjustable Gaussian Network Model
(SAGNM) [35], and on the existing bioinformatics predictive methods and tools, Chimera and
VMD [36, 37]. Our SAGNM method predicts binding areas without any information on the binding
partner’s properties, position or orientation.
The analysis of drug binding spots on the surfaces of protein targets is based on the Gaussian
Network Model formalism [38-43]. The GNM produces a set of vibrational modes via the
eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the protein Kirchhoff contact matrix . The fastest modes (with
largest eigenvalues λ) are more localized and have steeper energy walls with a larger decrease
in entropy and they are, therefore, referred to as kinetically hot residues. For more details on
Phantom network and GNM, see the Supplementary Materials in [35].
The connection between kinetically hot residues and interfacial residues involved in proteinprotein interactions has already been established [44]. The methodology introduced in [35], and
used here is based on a self-adjusting approach. It is able to accurately and effectively determine
binding pockets for peptides and small, drug-like molecules.
The term “kinetically hot residues” is linguistically close, but does not carry the same meaning as
the term “hot spots” that is often used in protein science. Hot spots are residues that often appear
in structurally preserved interfaces (in more than 50% of cases). They are important, because
they are general contributors to the binding free energy. They are defined as spots where alanine
mutation increases the binding free energy at least 2.0 kcal/mol [45-51].

Methods and Materials
Our aim was to analyze presently available structures existing drugs bound to parasitic and
human proteins and predict their binding patterns, as well as the binding patterns of SARS and
SARS-COV-2 binding patterns to the human ACE2 receptor. To predict binding residues in protein
we applied our Self Adjustable interpretationof Gaussian Network Model (SAGNM) [35]. The
structure alignment, hydrophobicity calculation, and visualization and analyses were performed
with the programs Chimera [36] and VMD [37].
The software for the Self Adjustable Gaussian Network Model code is composed of several
different programs. The first program calculates contact maps and the corresponding
eigenvectors and eigenvalues [52] for both protein chains forming a protein dimer (given as a
PDB file). To accomplish that the program first calculates the Kirchhoff contact matrix  for each
protein. The matrix  calculation is based on the distances between C atoms only, and those
4

distances have to be lesser or equal to 7 Å to consider two residues in a contact [38-40]. The
code then calculates and sorts  matrix eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The eigenvectors are
sorted according to their corresponding eigenvalues. Those eigenvalues and eigenvectors are
used in the second part that (iteratively) calculates the weighted sum of modes [41] as

R i 2

where λk are eigenvalues and uk are eigenvectors. See the Supplementary material in [35] for
details on phantom network and GNM.
This equation, normalized by dividing the sum by 3k BT /   produces mean square fluctuations
of each residue by a given set of modes (k1 to k2). The equation produces an estimate of a kinetic
contribution of each residue for that set of modes. The above equation is very similar to the
singular value decomposition method [53] used in the linear least squares optimization method.
An additional code extracts contact and first layer residues. Finally, the third set of routines
extracts neighboring residues and their distances for each residue per protein chain. That
information is later used in the spatial spreading of the influence of kinetically hot residues.
The first step in the SAGNM procedure is the calculation of the weighted sum (Eq. 1). The
procedure starts with a number of modes that corresponds to the top 10% of eigenvalues range
of the analyzed protein. With normalized sum only residues with a normalized amplitude higher
than 0.05 are perceived as hot residues. The number of hot residues is usually smaller than the
number of potential contact or first layer residues (not contact residues with a spatial atom-atom
distance of less than 4.5 Å from contact residues). To account for that the influence of hot residues
is spread to their sequential neighbors using the sequence information obtained from protein
structure PDB files (to account for possible missing residues). The influence of hot residues is
first spread linearly, to sequential neighbors only, because proteins are polymer chains with
physically connected residues. That implies that sequentially neighboring residues should exhibit
correlated behavior. For chains longer than 100 amino acids (aa), hot residues and 8 their
sequential neighbors upstream and downstream are labeled as predictions (four upstream, four
downstream). For shorter chains the influence is spread to 6 neighboring residues.
The prediction is then expanded to spatial neighbors. This approach is much closer to the true
nature of the GNM algorithm that uses only spatial distances between C atoms and disregards
any sequential/connectivity information. To apply this approach, the maximum cutoff C-C
distance from the center of a hot residue was introduced to which its influence can be spread.
The cutoff distance of 6 Å was applied with for shorter protein chains (for sequence lengths
shorter than 250 aa) and the cutoff of 8 Å for longer protein chains. All residues with

C atoms

within the sphere centered at the C atom of the hot residue, and within the assigned cutoff
distance, are considered to be predictions. The two cutoff values were estimated empirically [35].
To extract spatial neighbors, distances between residues ( C-C distances) were calculated for
each particular protein and sorted in ascending order.
The Self Adjustment GNM scheme is performed as follows:
Step 1: Calculate the number of fast modes that correspond to the top 10% of eigenvalues range.
Step 2: Calculate the weighted sum (Eq. 1) and spread the influence of hot residues to sequential
and spatial neighbors.

5

Step 3a: If the overall percent of predictions is larger than expected (for example, if the percent
of predictions is larger than the previously set value of the 30% of the total number of residues),
the SAGNM procedure reduces the number of fast modes by one and goes to the Step 2.
Step 3b: If the percent of predictions is too small (e.g. less than the predetermined value of 15%
of all residues), the SAGNM procedure increases the number of fast modes by one and goes to
the Step 2.
The Self Adjustable procedure repeats the Steps 2 and 3 until the percent of predictions fits
between the maximum and minimum expected percentages for a given chain.
To avoid infinite loops, only one increase followed by a decrease is allowed, and vice versa.
Multiple consecutive increases or decreases are allowed. This approach ensures that longer
proteins have enough predictions, and that shorter ones are not saturated with too many false
positives.
We focused our study on pdb structures with the listed drugs present as ligands. For chloroquine
we analyzed 2 structures (pdb ids 1cet [54] and 4v2o [55]). For Ivermectin we analyzed the binding
pattern of the drug to the human glycine receptor alpha-3 (pdb id 5vdh [56]). For Remdesivir we
analyzed its binding patterns in the recently released structure (pdb id 7bv2 [12]). We also
performed the analysis of binding pattern of drug Sofosbuvir to the hepatitis C virus (HCV) RdRp
(pdb id 4wtg [57]) and compared them to the Covid-19 RdRp predictions (pdb id 6m71 [58]).
Sofosbuvir was already analyzed in light of similarities between HCV and SARS-COV-2 RdRp
and similarities between Remdesivir’s and Sofosbuvir’s [59]. For boceprevir we analyzed the
structure SARS-Cov-2 main protease bound to the drug (pdb id 6wnp). For αDifluoromethylornithine we analyzed a structure of Trypanosoma brucei ornithine decarboxylase
(ODC) with D-ornithine bound to it (pdb id 1njj [60]). α-Difluoromethylornithine binds to the active
site of ODC and inhibits ornithine binding to it. We performed the comparative analysis of the
binding patterns between the ACE2 human receptor and the spike glycoproteins from SARS (pdb
id 6cs2 [61]) and SARS-COV-2 (pdb id 6m0j [7]). We also analyzed the binding patterns between
the SARS RBD with S230 human neutralizing antibody, and between SARS RBD and glycan
shield (pdb id 6nb6 [62]).

Results
Chloroquine
The analysis of chloroquine binding patterns to Plasmodium Falciparum Lactate Dehydrogenase
(pdb id 1cet [54]) and human Lysosomal protein Saposin B (pdb id 4v2o [55]) reveals that
chloroquine binds to kinetically active sites recognized by the SAGNM algorithm which are mostly
hydrophobic (Figure 1).
With Lactate Dehydrogenase chloroquine binds selectively and competitively to the Nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide (NADH) binding pocket of the enzyme, and occupies a position similar to
that of the adenyl ring of the cofactor. It is thus a competitive inhibitor for this critical glycolytic
enzyme of malaria [54]. The SAGNM algorithm recognizes residues Val-24, Leu-25, Val-48, Leu51, Ala-63 and Val-94 as hot. Their influence is spread to the residues Lys-20, Ala-21, Lys-22,
Ile-23, Val-24, Leu-25, Val-26, Gly-27, Ser-28, Gly-29, Gly-32, Ala-37, Ile-40, Asn-44, Leu-45,
Gly-46, Asp-47, Val-48, Val-49, Leu-51, Phe-52, Asp-53, Ile-54, Val-55, Pro-59, His-60, Gly-61,
Lys-62, Ala-63, Leu-64, Asp-65, Thr-66, Ser-67, Cys-76, Lys-77, Val-78, Ser-79, Gly-80, Ser-81,
Asp-87, Leu-88, Gly-90, Ser-91, Asp-92, Val-93, Val-94, Ile-95, Val-96, Thr-97, Ala-98, Ala-133,
6

Phe-134, Ile-135, Ile-136. See Figure 1a-d and Figure S1a in the Supplementary material. The
drug interacts with residues Val-26, Gly-27, Phe-52, Asp-53, Ile-54, Tyr-85, Ala-98, Phe-100, Ile119 and Glu-122 and the SAGNM algorithm correctly recognized residues 26, 27, 52, 53, 54 and
98. Other sites although exposed to solvent are not binding targets. The Chloroquine molecule
binds preferentially to hydrophobic sites (see Figs 1c-d) and avoids neutral and hydrophilic areas.
The lysosomal protein Saposin B is a trimer formed by chains A, B and C. It selectively degrades
lipids and is one of the most studied members of the saposin protein family [55]. Its deficiency or
malfunctioning leads to the accumulation of lipids in the lysosome and results in the lysosomal
storage disease metachromatic leukodystrophy ([55] and references therein). The SAGNM
algorithm recognizes the residues Ile-8 and Cys-71 in chain A, Ile-8 and Cys-71 in chain B and
Cys-71 in chain C as hot. Their influence is spread to the residues Gln-5, Asp-6, Cys-7, Ile-8, Gln9, Met-10, Val-11, Pro-67, Lys-68, Glu-69, Ile-70, Cys-71, Ala-72, Leu-73, Val-74, Phe-76 and
Cys-77 in chain A; to the residues Gln-5, Asp-6, Cys-7, Ile-8, Gln-9, Met-10, Val-11, Pro-67, Lys68, Glu-69, Ile-70, Cys-71, Ala-72, Leu-73, Val-74, Phe-76 and Cys-77 in chain B, and to the
residues Lys-68, Glu-69, Ile-70, Cys-71, Ala-72, Leu-73, Val-74, Phe-76 and Cys-77 in chain C.
See Figure 1e-h and Figure S1b in the Supplementary material. The SAGNM recognizes that the
chloroquine molecules interact with residues Glu-69 and Leu-73 from chain B, out of residues
Ala-58, Met-61, Met-65, Glu-69 and Leu-73. With chain C, it recognizes residues Glu-69 and Leu73, out of residues Met-61, His-64, Met-65, Glu-69 and Leu-73. With chain A it does not
emphasize the residue Arg-38, but it recognizes the binding patch with the chain C (see Figure
1e).
With both chloroquine examples the expected number of predictions for the SAGNM algorithm
was set to be between 10% and 15%, and that corresponds to the fastest normal mode. Our
results suggest that chloroquine’s binding to Covid-19 proteins should follow the same patterns
as with Lactate Dehydrogenase and Saposin B. Namely it should attach to residues which are
both hydrophobic and kinetically active (or very close to kinetically active sites).
The analysis of chloroquine’s nondiscriminatory binding to human and parasitic proteins may offer
an explanation of its efficiency against parasitic infections as well offer a glimpse into its toxicity.

Ivermectin
The drug ivermectin binds glutamate-gated chloride channels and thus increases their
permeability to chloride ions. We analyzed the ivermectin’s binding to the human glycine receptor
alpha-3 (pdb id 5vdh [56]). This structure, besides ivermectin, also has glycine and the potentiator
AM-3607 (7c6) bound to the glycine receptor. The comparison of the crystal structure used in this
research to previously determined structures revealed that the ivermectin binding expands the
ion channel pore [56].
The receptor is a pentamer, so we only analyzed the binding to its chain A (Figure 2). The SAGNM
algorithm recognized the residues Glu-157, Ser-158, Phe-168, Phe-207, Thr-208, Cys-209, Ile210, Glu-211, Ser-238, Gly-256, Thr-259, Val-260, Val-294 and Leu-298 as kinetically hot. For
the list of residues their influence is spread to see the list below Figure S2 in the Supplementary
material. The expected number of predictions for the SAGNM algorithm was set to be between
25% and 30%, and that corresponds to 3 fastest modes. The three compounds bind to the
residues Arg-27, Ile-28, Arg-29, Phe-32, Phe-159, Gly-160, Tyr-161, Asp-165, Tyr-202, Thr-204,
Phe-207, Ser-267, Ser-268, Ser-278, Val-280, Asp-284, Ala-288, Leu-291, Leu-292 and Phe-295.
The SAGNM algorithm recognized residues Phe-159, Gly-160, Tyr-161, Asp-165, Tyr-204, Phe207, Leu-291, Leu-292 and Phe-295. The analysis (Figure 2) reveals that all three compounds
(ivermectin, glycine and AM-3607 (7c6)) bind to kinetically active and adjoining residues [35],
some of which are highly hydrophobic, with ivermectin binding almost exclusively hydrophobic
residues. That means that this drug well seek similar sites on the surface of the Covid-19 proteins.

Remdesivir
We used the recently cryo-EM determined structure of SARS-COV-2 RdRp with double-stranded
template-primer RNA and remdesivir (pdb id 7bv2 [12]) to analyze the RNA and drug binding to
residues in RdRp. The structure reveals that the double stranded RNA is inserted into RdRp’s
central channel and that the active triphosphate form of remdesivir is covalently bound to the
primer strand at the first replicated base, which effectively terminated the chain elongation. It
should be noted that the prodrug form of remdesivir does not have any inhibitory effect on the
polymerization activity of the purified enzyme [12]. The SAGNM algorithm recognized the residues
Gly-503, Thr-538, Ile-539, Thr-540, Gln-541, Ala-558, Val-560, Ser-561, Val-609, His-613, Glu665, Met-666, Val-667, Met-668, Ala-702, Ala-706, Phe-753, Cys-765 and Asn-767 in chain A as
hot, the residues Asp-161 and Ile-185 in chain B as hot, and the residues Lys-7, Ser-10, His-36,
Ile-39, Ala-48 and Lys-51 in chain C as hot. For the predictions see the list below Figure S3 in the
Supplementary materials.
Our analysis reveals that the residues recognized via the fastest two normal modes
(corresponding to kinetically active residues [35]) delineate the central channel (Figure 3a-b). The
enzymatically important residues Lys-500, Ser-501, Lys-545 and Arg-555 are all recognized by
the SAGNM algorithm using just the fastest normal mode, while the residue Asp-761 of the
catalytic center (out of residues Ser-759, Asp-760 and Asp-761 that form the catalytic center) is
also emphasized with the two fastest modes. Residues Lys545 and Arg-555 are important
because they stabilize the incoming nucleotide in the correct position for catalysis. The crystal
structure shows that the catalytic center of RdRp, NSP12 protein (Non Structural Protein 12),
does not have any contacts with base pairs of RNA emphasizing RdRp’s sequence-agnostic
polymerization ability [12]. This is in concordance with our coarse grained analysis, based on the
positions of C-α atoms only, that shows that stable, kinetically active residues outline the
enzyme’s central channel.

Sofosbuvir
We performed a comparative analysis of the Hepatitis C virus (HCV) RdRp (chain A in pdb id
4wtg [57]; the structure is given with the drug sofosbuvir bound to it) and the Covid-19 RdRp
(chain A in pdb id 6m71 [58]). We followed the steps of Y. Gao and collaborators [59] and
attempted to compare predictions of the binding residues in HCV RdRp to sofosbuvir, to binding
residues predictions in Covid-19 RdRp. The binding residues in HCV are buried deep inside the
polymerase catalytic core. Our analysis shows that they are generally delineated by the kinetically
active residues and are thus stable and characterized by the two fastest normal modes (Figure
4a), but they are not explicitly hydrophobic (Fig. 4b-c). The SAGNM algorithm recognized the
residues Met-139, Ala-157, Met-266, Asn-268, Cys-279, Lys-298, Phe-339 and Met-343 of the
HCV RdRp (pdb id 4wtg) as hot. The algorithm recognized the residues Met-139, Ala-157, Met266, Asn-268, Cys-279, Lys-298, Phe-339 and Met-343 of the main enzymatic unit of Covid-19
RdRp (pdb id 6m71) as hot. For the full list of hot residues and predictions for HCV RdRp see
Figure S4 and the list below it, and for Covid-19 RdRp see Figure S5 and the list below it in the
Supplementary material.
The structural alignment of HCV and Covid-19 RdRp (Figure 4e) using the Chimera program [36]
shows that they share the structure of the binding pocket, and also reveals that the catalytic cores
in both proteins is bounded by kinetically active residues, but the overall distribution of residues
is only partially similar between the two proteins (Figure 4f). In both cases the expected number
of targets is between 15 and 20%. With HCV RdRp that corresponds to the two fastest modes,

and with Covid-19 RdRp and the main catalytic unit NSP12, that corresponds to 7 fastest modes.
The similarities suggest that the interior of the RdRp in coronaviruses are attractive binding spot
for small compounds in general.
The main enzymatic unit of Covid-19 RdRp, NSP12, mostly keeps its conformation between RNA
free and RNA bound structures [12]. Figure 5 shows that cofactors NSP7 and NSP8 seek patches
with kinetically active residues on the surface of NSP12. However, they are also in contact with
kinetically less active areas. This should be analyzed in the light of fact that SARS-COV-2 RdRp
(NSP12) cannot perform its function without NSP7 and NSP8 [12]. The distribution of kinetically
very active and kinetically dormant residues may be important for the overall stability of NSP12,
and also act as stochastic oscillator/transformer that translates random fluctuations of solvent and
proteins into a regular vibrations that produce a regular rhythm of translation (i.e. act as a regular
clock/oscillator).

Spike glycoproteins and their interactions
ACE2 binding patterns to SARS and Covid-19 Spike glycoproteins
The analysis of the contact patterns between the ACE2 receptor and the spike glycoprotein
receptor binding domains (RBD) in SARS (pdb id 6cs2 [61]) and SARS-COV-2 (pdb id 6m0j [7])
reveals a difference in the distribution of kinetically active residues important for binding between
RBD and ACE2 (Figure 6). The conformationally stable SARS-RBD has a smaller number of
kinetically active and adjoining residues in direct contact with ACE2 (Figure 6a-c), while kinetically
active residues in Covid-19 RBD are directly oriented and are in contact with the active residues
in ACE2 (Figure 6d-f). In SARS active residues are mostly perpendicular to the interfacial plane
(compare the distributions of C-alpha atoms in Figs. 6a and 6d). That should make the binding
affinity between the Covid-19-RBD and ACE2 receptor stronger than between the SARS-RBD
and ACE2 receptor. In both cases the predicted residues are recognized via the fastest vibrational
mode (see [35]). For the list of hot residues and predictions see Figure S6 in the Supplementary
material and the list below it. For 6cs2 the expected number of targets was between 22 and 25%,
and that corresponds to the first, fastest mode for SARS Spike glycoprotein (chain B), and the
fastest six modes for ACE2 (chain D). For 6m0j the expected number of targets was between 20
and 22%, and that corresponds to the first, fastest mode for Covid-19 Spike glycoprotein receptor
binding domain (chain E), and fastest six modes for ACE2 (chain A).

SARS-Cov spike glycoprotein and glycans
The analysis of kinetically active and adjoining residues in the SARS-Cov spike glycoprotein
monomer (pdb id 6nb6) reveals that they are attractive binding spots for glycans (Figure 7).
Glycans form the glycan shield, which was already suggested to assist in immune evasion
similarly to the HIV-1 envelope trimer [63]. The kinetically active residues recognized by the
SAGNM algorithm [35] can be used as target areas for drugs aimed at removing/disrupting the
viral glycan shield. Those residues are not particularly hydrophobic and should be targeted by
drugs that bind to hydrophilic patches, and electrostatically complementary.

SARS Spike Glycoprotein RBD and human antibody fragment
We also analyzed the kinetically active residues in the structure formed by the SARS Spike
Glycoprotein RBD and human neutralizing S230 antibody FAB fragment (pdb id 6nb6). The
analysis reveals that S230 antibody binds to kinetically active residues in SRAS RBD, while heavy
and light chains in S230 communicate via kinetically active residues (see Figure 8). The binding
9

residues are mostly neutral to hydrophilic, thus any potential drug should be able to bind to similar
surfaces (neutral/hydrophilic and stable).

Boceprevir
With the expected number of targets between 15 and 20% of the total number of residues, which
corresponds to the fastest normal mode, the SAGNM algorithm recognized the residues Val-20,
Asn-28 and Cys-38 as kinetically hot in the SARS-Cov-2 main protease (pdb id 6wnp). That
corresponds to the predictions Cys-16, Met-17, Val-18, Gln-19, Val-20, Thr-21, Cys-22, Gly-23,
Thr-24, Thr-25, Thr-26, Leu-27, Asn-28, Gly-29, Leu-30, Trp-31, Leu-32, Asp-34, Val-35, Val-36,
Tyr-37, Cys-38, Pro-39, Arg-40, His-41, Val-42, Phe-66, Leu-67, Val-68, Gln-69, Val-86, Leu-87,
Lys-88, Cys-117, Tyr-118, Asn-119, Gly-120, Gly-143, Ser-144, Cys-145, Gly-146, Ser-147 and
Met-162. Of all the residues in contact with boceprevir, the SAGNM algorithm recognized the
residues Thr-25, Thr-26, Leu-27, His-41, Gly-143, Ser-144 and Cys-145, see Figure 9. See also
Figure S8 in the Supplementary material for the distribution of hot and predicted residues.

Eflornithine
The drug α-difluoromethylornithine (DMFO, Eflornithine) prohibits binding of the natural noncoded amino acid ornithine to the active site on the surface of Trypanosoma brucei Ornithine
Decarboxylase (ODC, pdb id 1njj [60]). The binding of this drug should follow the binding patterns
of ornithine. Figure 9 shows that SAGNM algorithm accurately detects binding sites for both
ornithine and G418 (Geneticin), an aminoglycoside antibiotic. In contrast to chloroquine, both
compounds bind preferably to the hydrophilic sites on the surface of ODC (Figure 10b-d). If
applied to treat Covid-19, the drug eflornithine should bind to similar sites on the surface of Covid19 proteins (hydrophobic and kinetically active, i.e. stable).
With the expected number of targets between 10 and 15% of the total number of residues, which
corresponds to the fastest normal mode, the SAGNM algorithm recognized the residues Asp-44,
Ala-281 and Phe-284 of the chain A of 1njj as kinetically hot. The corresponding predictions are
Thr-21, Phe-40, Phe-41, Val-42, Ala-43, Asp-44, Leu-45, Gly-46, Asp-47, Ile-48, Gly-240, Thr241, Arg-277, Tyr-278, Tyr-279, Val-280, Ala-281, Ser-282, Ala-283, Phe-284, Thr-285, Leu-286,
Ala-287, Val-288, Glu-384, Asp-385, Met-386, Gly-387, Ala-388, Tyr-407, Val-408, Val-409 and
Ser-410. See Figure S9 in the Supplementary material for their distribution.

Discussion and conclusions
Covid-19 is the first modern, severe global pandemic caused by a coronavirus, and there are no
guarantees that it will be the last. Our society therefore needs not only to develop an effective and
efficient treatment for the current disease, but also has to have a set of protocols to promptly
address all future, similar pandemics. In this manuscript we presented our strategy to recognize
potential drug binding residues in human and viral proteins. We analyzed four currently approved
drugs (chloroquine, ivermectin, remdesivir, sososbuvir, boceprevir and eflornithine). Our results
indicate that small, drug like compounds preferentially bind to kinetically active and adjoining
residues, thus seeking stable residues characterized by fast normal modes with small amplitude
of fluctuations [35]. Some drugs preferentially seek active patches that are hydrophobic
(chloroquine, ivermectin), while others prefer hydrophilic surfaces (remdesivir, sofosbuvir,
eflornithine). We can postulate that in water environment drugs binding to hydrophilic patches will
be more stable, as their removal will lead toward the reduction in structural entropy, but a full
account of this proposition will require calculations of binding free energy differences based on
10

full atom molecular dynamics, using, for instance, steered molecular dynamics simulations (SMD)
[64-66]. We can also propose that the drugs/small molecules that bind to deep pockets will be
more stable, and thus more effective. Our algorithm accurately recognizes such pockets as
binding spots for drugs (Figures 1a, 3 and 10), and small peptides (see, in particular, Figure 6a in
[35]).
Multidrug cocktails are frequently used to treat viral diseases [67]. Our analysis shows that in
designing antiviral drug cocktails, binding affinity between drugs and kinetically active (stable)
sites should be combined with the information on their hydrophobic and hydrophilic properties in
attempt to avoid binding competition, increase drug cocktail efficiency, and reduce toxicity and
other unwanted side effects.
In our analysis we used both viral-parasitic, as well as human proteins. The analysis shows that
kinetically active residues exist in both human and non-human proteins/enzymes and that drugs
bind indiscriminately to them regardless of their origin. The compounds that bind to human
proteins potentially offer longer lasting treatments as host cells and tissues have less chance of
developing drug resistance through single point mutations.
The procedure we described here is fast and effective, and can analyze a protein structure much
faster than computationally demanding molecular dynamics simulations. Its advantage is not in
its efficiency, but also in its ability to suggest general binding patterns between proteins and drugs
or small peptides. It can be used to filter binding areas on protein surfaces and thus facilitate
preclinical stages in drug design. Binding spots in various proteins can be very effectively
predicted with our SAGNM approach and accessed with other bioinformatics tools for charge and
shape complementarity, binding affinity, atomic mass and other properties as well. However, the
SAGNM algorithm cannot determine binding free energies, or binding orientations of small
molecules. For that aim other docking tools or molecular dynamics should be applied as we
explained above. Our results are concordant with full atom docking and simulations studies [1319] that emphasized sofosbuvir, remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin, compounds that
we also analyzed. This indicates that protein-ligand docking is a multistep process, guided both
by coarse grained properties of a bigger binding partner, and detailed, atomic scale properties of
binding pocket and a small ligand.
Recent advances in machine learning helped advance our ability to predict and design protein
structures [68], but the full theoretical foundations for protein folding and binding is still lacking.
The quality of the machine learning protocol directly depends on the quality and size of training
data sets and thus in many ways follows classical methods based on statistical potentials and
homology modeling [69]. Our results can also help in that respect as they offer interpretation on
how residue packing inside protein segments guides their assemblage.
Our results depicted here show that in proteins that interact with small, drug-like molecules
contacting scaffolds are surrounded by kinetically hot residues. Similar conclusion related to
protein-protein interactions was given in [35], but, as we showed above, the full binding behavior
is not accessible only through the analysis of kinetically active residues and their neighbors. The
full atom analysis is still required for the detailed assessment of protein-drug binding. The coarse
grained analysis (SAGNM algorithm) thus, perceives only the outline of the binding funnel, while
the full atom analysis (binding free energy) sees finer patterns inside that outline. Their
combination may offer an overall improvement in binding prediction. This approach should be in
principle be similar to the current improvement in Deep Neural Networks (DNN) architectures
aimed at image recognition and classification by Brendel and Bethge [70]. The improvement is
based on the splitting images into small local image features (e.g. outlines) without taking into
11

account their spatial ordering, a strategy closely related to the pre deep-learning bag-of-feature
(BoF) models. This image classification improvement is based on the observation, that standard
DNN architectures perceive images primarily through textures, as opposed to human perception,
which is primarily based on the outlines and shapes of objects [71]. In our case, the outline is
determined primarily by the protein, and fine binding features (“binding textures”) stem from the
joint properties of the smaller binding partner and the binding outline determined by the protein.
In that sense the SAGNM approach is similar to human vision, and molecular docking and
dynamics studies to the machine, DNN based, vision. This observation opens a space for further
work, where molecular binding will be treated as a two-step process where the coarse-grained
shape of binding funnel will be determined by the larger partner in the first step, and final binding
position and orientation by the multiple and detailed features of the binding funnel and a smaller
partner inside that funnel.
