1. Introduction
The lack of recommended efficacious drugs or vaccines for the COVID-19 disease
caused the ongoing pandemic, which affected 188 countries and territories with 5.20 million
confirmed cases and death of 337,000 people by 22nd May 2020 [1]. The COVID-19 disease
caused by the virus strain of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
identified first in December 2019 at Wuhan, China. SARS-CoV-2, the single-stranded
positive-sense RNA virus has beta-coronavirus genus with closely related genomic
organization to SARS-CoV identified in 2003 [2]. The envelope of the spherical-shaped
SARS-CoV-2 consists of structural proteins like membrane (M), envelope (E) and spike (S)
proteins, where the club-shaped spike glycoprotein (SGp) interacts with the angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) of human cells and allows the SARS-CoV-2 virus to enter into
the cells [3]. After entering cells, the viral replication and transcription is mediated with
functional proteins like main protease (Mpro or 3CLpro), papain-like protease (PLpro),
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and helicase [4]. After the publication of the
genomic sequence and crystal structures of various proteins of SARS-CoV-2 like Mpro,
PLpro, SGp, RdRp etc. [5-8], research on structure-based molecular docking, dynamic
simulations and quantum mechanical optimizations are performed to discover appropriate
inhibitors for SARS-CoV-2 from the available databases/library containing approved drugs
and phytochemicals with medicinal importance [9-10]. The computer based simulations and
docking approaches are adopted to expedite the search to get target drugs/molecules from the
library/databases that contained in lakhs, and also to minimize the experimental cost and time
in developing appropriate drug/vaccine for COVID-19 [11].
The computational docking and simulations help in repurpose drugs like
remdesivir, favipiravir and arbidol to fight against COVID-19 [12-14]. These repurpose drugs
showed some promising results, but required further clinical evidences to examine their
safety and efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19 [15-17]. Therefore, the computational
2

docking and simulations research are ongoing globally to formulate new and effective
therapeutic approaches for COVID-19. As a part of our ongoing research to search potential
structures from phytochemicals that can effectively bind at the active site of various
therapeutic target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 [18], we selected 186 phenylpropanoids and
polyketides based phytochemicals for screening against the proteins 3CLpro, PLpro, SGp,
RdRp and ACE2. The phenylpropanoids and polyketides are well known for diverse
biological activities and pharmacological properties. Based on the in silico ADMET, druglikeness and dock score, the compounds petunidin, baicalein, cyanidin, hydroxy-3',4'methylenedioxyflavan, quercetin and ellagic acid among the 186 biologically important
phenylpropanoids and polyketides were proposed as potential lead compounds, and their
interactions with the target proteins were discussed.
2. Computational methods
The SDF files of the 186 biologically important phenylpropanoids and polyketides
were

retrieved

from

EMBL-EBI

(www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/advancedSearchFT.do)

and

PUBCHEM (https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). The structures were re-optimized by semiempirical PM6 method by using the computational code Gaussian 09W and converted to
PDB file format [19]. The crystallography protein structure of Mpro (PDB ID: 6LU7), PLpro
(PDB ID: 4MM3), RdRp (PDB ID: 6M71), SGp-RDB (PDB ID: 2GHV) and ACE2 (PDB
ID: 6M17) were downloaded from the PDB database (www.rcsb.org). The fine structure of
the proteins were refined using Swiss model online tools followed by analysed using the
Ramachandran plot. The ligand and protein structures were prepared for docking by using
the MGL tool. The molecular docking studies were carried out by using the Autodock
Vina1.1.2 [20]. The docked structures were analysed using the visualization tool BIOVIA
Discovery studio. The important pharmacokinetic properties and ADMET (absorption,
distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity) properties of the compounds were screened

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Screening of phytochemicals
Total 186 phenylpropanoids and polyketides found in the Indian medicinal plants
and/or diets possesses diverse biological activities and pharmacological properties were
collected from different databases, and screened against the five important therapeutic target
proteins of SARS-CoV-2, i.e., Mpro, PLpro, RdRp, SGp and ACE2 by molecular docking
analysis by using Autodock Vina. The dock score of 186 compounds with the five target
proteins are summarized in Table S1. All the screened compounds showed good dock score,
and we found that total 49, 24, 32, 63 and 77 compounds showed more than -8.0 kcal/mol
dock score with each of the proteins Mpro, PLpro, SGp, RdRp and ACE2, respectively. To
search the potential compounds, we performed protein-ligand interaction study that showed
maximum binding affinity and dock score above -8.0 kcal/mol, and filtered the compounds
that bound to the active site of any of the therapeutic target proteins of SARS-CoV-2. The
protein-ligand interaction study revealed that only 40 compounds are binding at the active
site of the therapeutic target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 (Table S2). These 40 compounds are
considered for further screening by in silico ADMET study and drug-likeness prediction.
The ADMET/drug-likeness screening of 40 compounds resulted only 9 compounds
(arjunolone,

cyanidin,

7-hydroxy-3',4'-methylenedioxyflavan,

isorhamnetin,

7,4'-

dihydroxyflavone, quercetin, baicalein, petunidin and ellagic Acid) which obeying all the
limitations of ADMET and drug-likeness properties (Table S2). The predicted drug-likeness
properties along with the ADME parameters and pharmacokinetic properties from the
SWISSADME and pKcsm online server are summarized in Table S3. The structure of these
lead compounds can be studied for lead optimization to discover novel drugs for COVID-19.
Also, these compounds can be used as an oral and intravenous admissible for further clinical
4

trials. Therefore, a deeper study on the protein-ligand interaction study was performed to
examine the modes of interaction of the lead compounds at the active site of the target
proteins of SARS-CoV-2.
3.2. Protein-ligand interaction study
Based on the dock score and reported medicinal importance of the 9 potential
compounds (Table S3), 6 lead compounds were proposed and their mode of interactions with
the residues of target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 at the active site are presented in Table 1.
Compared to our recent proposed triterpenoids based lead compounds i.e., 7-deacetyl-7benzoylgedunin (-9.1 kcal/mol), epoxyazadiradione (-8.4 kcal/mol), limonin (-9.2 kcal/mol),
maslinic acid (-9.3 kcal/mol) and glycyrrhizic acid (-10.3 kcal/mol) respectively for the target
protein Mpro, PLpro, RdRp, SGp and ACE2, the phenylpropanoids and polyketides based
lead compounds showed slightly lower dock score, except for PLpro [18]. However, their
distinct structure from the triterpenoids with the different mode of interactions at the active
site of SARS-CoV-2 makes them attractive inhibitors. Also, these lead compounds are mainly
available in dietary sources and possesses diverse pharmacological properties makes them
ideal choice for formulating new therapeutic approach for COVID-19.

3.2.1. Mpro or 3CLpro (Chymotrypsin like protease)
The main protease cleaves about 11 polyproteins including its N and C terminal auto
processing sites for the generation of the individual protein units that includes RdRp,
helicase,

ssRNA-binding

protein,

endonuclease,

exoribonuclease

and

2-O-ribise

methyltransferacse etc. The target protein Mpro play important role in replication and
transcription of SARS-CoV-2 virus. Mpro contains two domains, i.e., domain I
(chymotrypsin) and domain II (picornavirus 3 C protease-like). Each domain contains sixstranded antiparallel β-barrel structure and the catalytic site is present at the residues Cys145
and His41 [21-23]. Among the screened 9 compounds, the petunidin and baicalein binding at
the active site of Mpro with the dock score -8.2 and -8.1 kcal/mol, respectively (Table 1).
Petunidin (anthocyanidin cation) is a phenolic compound and a plant metabolite
which is found in grapes and red berries constituting 5-hydroxyl substituent’s and 7-methoxy
substituent’s. It is identified as a potential inhibitor of Mpro. The posing ligand exclusively
binding to the active site of the target Chain A. Some of the pocket residues interactions
showing hydrogen Bonds to SerA144, Gly143, His163, which indicates the strong binding
affinity. Petunidin rings effectively maintaining carbon bond to Cys145 and π-alkyl bond to
6

Met165. The target protein catalytic dyed residues posing π-π bond to His41 and π-donor
bond to Phe140 interactions. The closest VDW non-covalent interaction to Asn142, Leu141,
His172, Glu166, Leu167, Pro168, Gln189, Arg188, His164, Met49 and Asp187 residues
allows to fit ligand in the active pocket (Fig. 1). The other compound baicalein also showed
nearly same binding affinity to Chain A residues by forming hydrogen bonds to Thr6, Thr24,
π-cation complex to His41 and unfavourable donor to Cys145 catalytic dyed residues (Fig.
S1). Other residues of target protein participate in forming non-covalent interactions are
summarized in Table 1. The petunidin and other anthocyanins synergistically shows
carcinogenic effect. In compared to petunidin, the medicinal importance of baicalein is well
known [24]. Baicalein shows anti-inflammatory and antitumor effects. It is used in Chinese
traditional medicine for treating liver disorders. Also, baicalein acts as an anti-furin activity
in CT-26 cells proliferation and migration resulting anti-cancerous properties [25], which
makes baicalein an important inhibitor as the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein contains a
furin cleavage site [26].

3.2.2. PLpro (papain like protease)
PLpro, a cysteine protease that mediates SARS-CoV-2 RNA replication [27]. It
functionally serves as a cleaving machine spanning nsp1 through nsp4. It is also involving the
deubiquitinating enzyme in aggressive proliferation of disease. PLpro consists of
hydrophobic cavities and is highly conserved to substrate binding profiles especially S2/S4
domains. PLpro efficiently cleaves the replicase substrate with the function of catalytic triad
(Cys112-His273-Asp287) and zinc-binding site. This pocket plays a key role to find the
potent inhibitor for PLpro, and identified the potent lead compound that could stop the RNA
replication of SARS-CoV-2.
Among the screened compounds having drug-likeness properties, the phenolic
compounds like arjunolone, cyanidin, 7-Hydroxy-3',4'-methylenedioxyflavan, Isorhamnetin,
and 7,4'-Dihydroxyflavone bind at the active sites of PLpro with dock score -8.3, -8.5, -8.3, 8.3 and -8.4 kcal/mol, respectively. These compounds are medicinally reported for their
antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties. Most of them are found in edible
fruits that collectively known for nutraceutical compounds. The modes of interactions of the
cyanidin showing higher dock score with the PLpro are summarized in Table 1.
Cyanidin is a pigment found in berries enhancing red, orange and blue colours.
Cyanidin is a polyketide and anthocyanidin pigment found in grapes and red berries.
Cyanidin and its glycoside analogue pose medicinal values such as anti-inflammatory, antidiabetes, anti-obesity and vasoprotective [28]. Anthocyanins structurally similar to cyanidin
show anti-cancerous properties and lower the risk of cancer and heart diseases. Cyanidin
actively binding to the pocket of catalytic triad residues of PLpro. It is showing binding
affinity to PLpro and can be served as an inhibitor. Cyanidin binding to active site of PLpro
by forming a complex with Chain B residues showing hydrogen bonds to Gly267, Tyr274
and Asp165 residues. The active site is a hydrophobic cavity showing the ligand forming π- π
interactions to Asn268, Tyr265 residues and carbon bond to Pro249 (Fig. 2).

3.2.3. SGp-RBD (Spike glycoprotein-receptor binding domain)
SGp plays a vital role in SARS-CoV-2 disease establishment by attaching the cell
membrane of the human receptor ACE2 and TMPRSS2 [29,30]. This also internalizes the
virus into the endosomes where the conformational changes take place in the S glycoprotein.
This protein promotes the fusion between the viral protein and the cell membrane constituting
3 states namely pre-fusion native, pre-hairpin intermediate state and post-fusion state. It acts
as a viral fusion peptide that covers up S2 cleavage that occurs during virus endocytosis.
These spike proteins determine the virion-host tropism that includes the entry of the virions
into host cells and their interactions with human ACE2. The exposed portion of SGp consists
of RBD, where substrate domain binding takes place. The fusion peptide is a targetable
domain to develop the therapeutic compounds. We had screened phytochemicals through
molecular docking to identify potent inhibitors for SGp that could practically obstruct the
SGp-ACE2 and SGp-TMPRSS2 complex formation and activation. The SGp-RBD consists

9

hydrophobic sites and substrate binding cavities between 333-527 amino acid residues of
chain C and chain E.
The compounds 7-hydroxy-3',4'-methylenedioxyflavan binding to the active sites of
side chains C and E of SGp-RBD, and forming inhibitory complex with dock score -8.2
kcal/mol (Fig. 3). It is forming a complex through hydrogen bonds with Arg444, His445
residues, π-π interaction with Phe460 and have non-covalent VDW forces with Asp454,
Leu443, Pro477, Arg441, Val456 and Pro459 residues (Table 1). Also, 7-hydroxy-3',4'methylenedioxyflavan binding to Chain E amino acid residues forming hydrogen bonds with
Pro459, Cys467, π-cation interaction with His445, and π-alkyl bond with Pro466, Val458
(Fig. S2). The nearest non-covalent VDW interactions with Phe460, Pro477, Leu443,
Arg441, Arg444, Ser456, Asp454. Medicinally, 7-hydroxy-3',4'-methylenedioxyflavan is an
antiviral drug that is reported for activity against the production of HIV1 antigen in MT4
cells and regression of cell proliferation of MCF7 of BUS cells [31].

potions of interactions.

3.2.4. RdRp (RNA-Dependent RNA polymerase)
RNA-Dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is well known as nsp12, which plays
major role in the transcription and replication process of SARS-CoV-2 [32]. Recently
identified structural changes in RdRp and functional residues are involved in replication.
Nsp12 consists of beta haipin like domain in N terminus. It is structurally similar to SARSCoV RdRp, having nsp12-nsp7-nsp8 complex proteins and functional domains in replication.
In nsp12 residues from 4-118 constitutes an antiparallel β-strands and two helices. Residues
from 215-218 form a β-strand of nsp12 domain. The NiRAN domain and the palm
subdomain in the RdRp domain forms a set of close contacts to stabilize the overall structure.
The polymerase domain a fingers subdomain residues are 366 to 581 and 621 to 679, a palm
subdomain 582 to 620 and 680 to 815, and a thumb subdomain residues 816 to 920. The
active site of the SARS-CoV-2 residues from 753 to 767 that contains the catalytic residues
from 759 to 761, in which the serine and glycine amino acids shows most catalytic functions
during polymerization and transcription. The active site poses a hydrophobic cavity between
nsp12 and nsp7 residues.
Among the 9 lead compounds, computational study revealed quercetin as potent
inhibitor of RdRp and binding to polymerase site chain A posing hydrogen bonds to Arg349,
Val315, Asn628 and showing π-alkyl, π-cation and π-sigma interactions to Pro677, Arg349,
Val315, Pro461, Val675 residues (Fig. 4). Quercetin forming a strong non-covalent VDW
interactions with Phe396, Cys395, Arg457, Thr319, Ser318 (Table 1). In the site2 quercetin
binding to the Gln573 and Ser682 residues forming hydrogen bond. The binding of these
residues including glycine and serine amino acids of active site cavity with quercetin could
hinder the function of RdRp in polymerization. The β strand of nsp12 domain is also
encapsulated with quercetin at the active sites 1 and 2.
Quercetin, a flavonoid found in onions, berries and apples etc that is biologically active
antioxidant and inflammatory compound. It is an orally admissible drug under investigation that
11

prevents haemolytic, cardiovascular diseases and some of the chronic disorders like diabetes,
arthritis, cancer etc. [33].

and RdRp, (b) 3D view showing the position of quercetin within the cavity of RdRp, and (c)
sequence indicating potions of interactions.
3.2.5. ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2)
ACE2 is a zinc associated metalloenzyme and carboxypeptidase which is located on
the endothelial cells of different organs especially arteries, lungs, kidneys etc. [34]. It is a
type 1 membrane protein where its enzymatically active domain is manifested on the surface
of the cells of lungs and other tissues. The interactions of the spike glycoprotein of the
coronavirus with this protein results in the endocytosis and translocation of enzyme and the
virus, which in turn act as entry point for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The extra structural
domains of the ACE2 are classified into two sub domains that are being connected at the base
and the hinge bending movement that opens up the active site. The site directed mutagenesis
is used to study the role of different active site residues. Arg273 plays a key role in the
process of substrate binding where as its replacement results in the abolishment of the
enzymatic activity. However, the His505 and His345 are entailed in the process of catalysis,
12

His345 acts as a hydrogen bond acceptor or receptor resulting in the formation of the
tetrahedral peptide intermediate. ACE2 recognizes RBD with the protease domain of ACE2
mainly engages the α1-helix partially from the α2-helix and the linker of the β3 and β4 sheets.
Among the 9 lead compounds, the compounds ellagic acid (Fig. 5) and 7-hydroxy3',4'-methylenedioxyflavan (Fig. S3) binds at the active site of ACE2 with the same dock
score of -8.4kcal/mol. The types of interactions between the ellagic acid and ACE2 are
summarized in Table 1. The ligand ellagic acid binding at chain B residues forming hydrogen
bonds to Gln98, Asn210, Trp566, Asp206, π–alkyl:, VDW: Val212, Leu91, Pro565, Glu208,
Ala396, Asn397, Lys562. It is also showing π-alkyl interactions Leu95 and Val209 residues
respectively. Ellagic acid is partially binding to the substrate binding pocket, the active site
residues lies between 21-95, 335-400 and 501-527 amino acid residues. Ellagic acid is richly
found in raspberries, blackberries, strawberries and other fruits and nuts. It is widely used as
potent drug to treat cancers, bacterial and viral diseases [35].
Isorhamnetin is a polyphenolic compound found in fruits, vegetables and medicinal
plants. It is showing binding affinity to active site of ACE2 substrate binding domain with
partial contact. The ligand isorhamnetin posing comparably lower binding energy 7.6kcal/mol with chain B residues by forming hydrogen bonds to Gln98, π–alkyl to Leu95,
Val209 and non-covalent VDW to Val212, Pro565, Glu208, Ala396, Gly205, Lys562,
Tyr196, Gln102, Ala99, Trp566, Asn210 (Fig. S4). Another compound hesperidin also a
phenolic compounds showing similar binding characteristics to ellagic acid, and binds to
Leu95, Gln98, Gln102, Asn194, Asn210, Arg219, Ala396 and Lys562 residues with binding
energy -9.2kcal/mol, but this compound violating Lipinski rule for drug-likeness properties.
Therefore, the compounds ellagic acid and 7-hydroxy-3',4'-methylenedioxyflavan were
proposed as potent compounds that can inhibit the activity of ACE2.

4. Conclusions
In summary, from the in silico computational screening of 186 phenylpropanoids and
polyketides based phytochemicals found mainly in Indian medicinal plants and dietary
sources,

6

lead

compounds

(petunidin,

baicalein,

cyanidin,

7-hydroxy-3',4'-

methylenedioxyflavan, quercetin and ellagic acid) were proposed as potential against the
therapeutic target proteins of SARS-CoV-2. Among the 6 lead compounds, the petunidin and
baicalein was proposed to inhibit the function of Mpro. The compounds cyanidin, 7-hydroxy3',4'-methylenedioxyflavan, quercetin and ellagic acid were proposed for the target proteins
PLpro, SGp-RBD, RdRp and ACE2, respectively. These lead compounds are dietary and
known for diverse medicinal properties. Therefore, formulation of therapeutic approach for
COVID-19 will be easier provided they found experimentally effective in inhibiting the
SARS-CoV-2. In addition, it is important to mention here that whenever the phytochemicals
are examined, the novel drug delivery systems should be adopted for effective release of the
14

phytochemicals at the target sites. Finally, the structure of the lead compounds can be studied
further for lead optimization to discovery novel drug for COVID-19.
