critical parameters
of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic:
an operational design

Abstract: Given the urgent informational needs connected with the diffusion of
infection with regard to the COVID-19 pandemic, in this paper, we propose a
sampling design for building a continuous-time surveillance system. Compared
with other observational strategies, the proposed method has three important
elements of strength and originality: (i) it aims to provide a snapshot of the
phenomenon at a single moment in time, and it is designed to be a continuous
survey that is repeated in several waves over time, taking different target variables
during different stages of the development of the epidemic into account; (ii) the
statistical optimality properties of the proposed estimators are formally derived
and tested with a Monte Carlo experiment; and (iii) it is rapidly operational as this
property is required by the emergency connected with the diffusion of the virus.
The sampling design is thought to be designed with the diffusion of SAR-CoV-2 in
Italy during the spring of 2020 in mind. However, it is very general, and we are
confident that it can be easily extended to other geographical areas and to possible
future epidemic outbreaks. Formal proofs and a Monte Carlo exercise highlight
that the estimators are unbiased and have higher efficiency than the simple
random sampling scheme.
Some keywords: COVID-19 diffusion; relative efficiency; epidemic monitoring;
health surveillance system; sampling design; unbiasedness.

1. Background and purpose

The urgent, worldwide need for a method of controlling the spread of SARS-CoV-2
requires an accurate evaluation of the sources of data on which the estimation of the
epidemic’s main parameters can be based. Only in this way will we be able to monitor the
evolution of the epidemic over time while simultaneously supporting decision makers in

evaluating the effects of the restrictive measures gradually introduced to try and stop the
spread and the time required for the reduction and removal of these measures. In general,
this approach enables the production of future forecasts of the evolution of the disease,
and these forecasts are the essential basis for achieving an effective healthcare response.
Indeed, while some degree of uncertainty is inherent in any statistical model, the level of
inaccuracy in terms of monitoring the development of the situation can and must be kept
under control.
The objective of the proposed method is the definition of an observational protocol for
observing the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic over time and providing statistically unbiased and
efficient estimates of the sizes of the different attributes of any population identified as a
concern with regard to the epidemic. Moreover, we aim to propose a dynamic monitoring
tool that can be suitably calibrated both in the growth phase of the infection rate and in
the decline phase, with estimates extended to the parameters of the progressive
immunization model for the population. All estimates can be produced with associated
reliability measures.
However, apart from a few remarkable exceptions, until now, the data that have been
collected favour the examination of cases in which the patients display symptoms. This
situation is described in statistics as “convenience sampling”, and no sound probabilistic
inference is possible under such a sampling approach (Hansen et al., 1953). More
precisely, in a formal sample design, the choices of observations are suggested by a
precise mechanism based on the definition of the inclusion probabilities of each unit (and,
hence, by a sound probabilistic inference method); in contrast, with a convenience
sampling, no probabilities of inclusion can be calculated, thus giving rise to over- or
underrepresentation of the sample units.
In particular, several studies on COVID-19 diffusion have clearly shown (e.g., Aguilar et
al., 2020; Chugthai et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020; Mizumoto et al., 2020a, 2020b and Yelin et
al., 2020) that the available data strongly underestimate the number of infected people
that they are unable to capture, e.g., asymptomatic cases with an obvious overestimation
of the lethality rate6. On the other hand, a broad data collection method using medical
swabs that is carried out on a voluntary basis does not constitute a probabilistic sample
either7. For instance, the practice of systematically collecting observations from people in
the vicinity of supermarkets leads to an overinclusion of healthy people in the sample and
to a systematic exclusion of those who (either because they are manifesting symptoms or
because they feel weak) have chosen to stay confined at home.
However, it is of crucial importance for government and health officials and for the
general population to have a clear understanding of the dynamics of an epidemic while it
is in progress so that the government can take appropriate measures and guide individual
behaviours. In such a situation, it is essential to set up a data collection system that can
provide unbiased estimates and statistically valid comparisons over time and across
different geographic areas.
For sampling during an epidemic to be empirically relevant, any data collection design must
be technically specified, the properties of the associated estimators have to be proved
formally, and the design has also to satisfy the following two conditions:

6

The lethality rate is given by the number of deaths out of the total number of infected people.

•

It has to be implemented as a surveillance system (or strictly related to an existing
one) and repeated in several waves rather than as a one-time survey.

•

It has to be immediately operational considering the practical implications of the
collected data.

The latter point is particularly relevant to the idea that the task may prove challenging,
especially in a situation where all health operators are employed full time in emergency
operations related to the care of the most severely infected people.
Rather surprisingly, the literature on this subject is still extremely poor. Few
contributions have suggested the use of crowdsourced data rather than a sampling design
along with officially collected data (Leung and Leung, 2020; Sun et al., 2020); the risk of
erroneous inferences based on these data has been pointed out by Arbia (2020), Di
Gennaro et al. (2020) and Ioannidis (2020). Our aim is to suggest a sampling design whose
statistical optimality properties are formally proven, where the design is also operational
and can be immediately put into action upon taking the many practical obstacles that may
arise in an emergency into account. Although we have the Italian COVID-19 situation in
mind, we are rather confident that the suggested protocol could be easily extended to
other countries.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present a review of the
strategies and experiences in progress with regard to data collection until early April
2020. In Section 3, we present the basic sampling framework of our suggested design by
distinguishing two subsets of the population to be surveyed, namely, those in which a
state of infection has already been verified and those who were in contact with them
(group A) and healthy persons (group B). The different roles of the two groups in
monitoring infections during different stages of the epidemic are also discussed. In
Section 4, we focus on the parameters of interest that we aim at measuring with the
suggested sampling design based on the two groups, and we discuss how to disentangle
possible overlaps between them whose presence may undermine the statistical
properties of the estimations. In Section 5, we provide a general description of the
sampling schemes for the two groups and the various operations to be realized. In Section
6, we prove the unbiasedness of the estimates and derive the expressions of the sampling
variances. Section 7 is devoted to envisaging an extension of the proposed methodology
to subsequent waves of data collection for the purpose of monitoring phenomena at
different moments of time and during different stages of the epidemic. Section 8 contains
a discussion on the efficiency of the estimators. Section 9 illustrates the empirical results
of a simulation study. Finally, in Section 10, we suggest some practical implications of the
study and future research priorities. All formal proofs can be found in the Appendix.
2. Data collection during an epidemic: a review of strategies and experiences
currently in progress
In the emergency phase connected with the quick and uncontrolled diffusion of COVID19, governments and institutions in charge are fully aware that knowledge and
understanding of the dynamics at work represent the central element for establishing
how to intervene and in which geographical areas intervention is most urgent.

In reviewing the approaches followed by various countries until early April 2020, we can
identify four strategies and experiences in progress with regard to the estimation of the
disease phenomena in the entire population.
a) The first consists of massive test campaigns (regardless of the presence of symptoms)
carried out without following a formal sampling design; these are essentially aimed at
intervening during outbreaks of the epidemic to identify subjects who are infected but
with no symptoms or only slight symptoms. This was the strategy of South Korea and
Hong Kong, as well as of the United Arab Emirates, Australia, Iceland, and the Veneto
Region in Italy8. The big limit of this approach is the impossibility of making statistical
inferences for the whole population based on the results.
b) The second possible strategy consists of diagnostic tests through a probabilistic sample
according to a planned design for the estimation of the phenomena of interest with
predetermined precision levels. This approach is aimed at estimating the effective amount
of infections, including those in the asymptomatic population. This approach was used in
the project performed by the Helmholtz Center for Research on Infections in Germany;
this project was based on testing patients’ blood for antibodies to the Covid-19 pathogen
and involved over 100,000 individuals (Hackenbroch, 2020). Similarly, in Romania, a
random sample of 10,500 people living in Bucharest has been planned to detect infected
persons by following the directions of the Matei Bals Institute of Infectious Diseases in
Bucharest (Romania-insider.com, 2020). Finally, a random selection of people who do not
meet the testing criteria will be observed at two Canberra locations by the Australian
Capital Territory (Abc, 2020). All these sample surveys are cross-sectional and useful for
measuring the infection rate at a precise instant. However, they have distinct
characteristics from those of continuous panel-type surveys with rotated samples for
monitoring the evolution of the pandemic over time. This latter type of survey constitutes
the proposal of this paper.9
c) The third strategy consists of a specific massive web survey collected from individuals
and households that decide to participate on a voluntary basis. Some 60,000 Israelis
completed the online daily survey developed by the Weizmann Institute. The participants
disclosed personal details, such as their age, gender, address, general state of health,
isolation status and any symptoms they may have been experiencing (Rossman et al.,
2020). We observed examples of the same strategy in Iceland, Estonia and other
countries. The results allow us to compare contagion and testing experiences for people
and households with different socioeconomic characteristics. For strategy a), the selfselection mechanism in the sampling process makes it impossible to extend the results to
the whole population.
d) Another possible strategy is to use pre-existing sample surveys and partially modify
them to collect information about the epidemic. Creating an EU ‘Corona Panel’, which is a
standardized European sample test to uncover the true spread of the coronavirus, is
indeed the proposal of the Centre for European Policy Studies, as presented by Daniel
Gros (2020). The proposal refers, in particular, to the use of the EU-wide sample of the
France and Spain are still testing only for case with specific symptoms and for close contacts of infected
people.
8

UK and Italy recently conducted sample surveys at a national level to estimate the real prevalence rate of
the infection (ONS, 2020; Istat, 2020). A critical review of the available data on Covid-19 and on the Italian
sample survey project is contained in Alleva and Zuliani 2020 and Alleva, 2020.

panel of households that participate in regular surveys on economic and social conditions,
called the ‘EU statistics on income and living conditions' (EU-SILC). More specifically,
Dewatripont et al. (2020) suggested implementing two tests using the EU-SILC panel: the
first aimed at assessing whether the subject is currently infected, and the second aimed
at testing whether the person has become immune due to previous exposure.
Timeliness is crucial. In this respect, the latter strategy seems to guarantee good results
for the European Statistical System (ESS). A quick reflection could be made on the
feasibility of inserting additional modules in the questionnaire of the quarterly Labour
Force Survey (LFS), obviously in accordance with the data protection authorities.
The International Labour Organization (ILO) has reached out to the National Statistical
Offices (NSOs) to understand the impacts of COVID-19 on their statistical operations,
particularly in the domain of labour statistics (ILO, 2020). The ILO recommended that all
countries consider what additional information could be useful for capturing the relevant
aspects of the epidemic. NSOs should consider whether some existing topics are of low
priority; if so, they can thus be temporarily removed from the surveys to create space for
new questions.
Many countries are employing combinations of the previously described approaches for
collecting data on the epidemic as well integrating them with administrative data or other
official statistical sources. While sample surveys represent a bedrock for making
inferences about the whole population, planning and building integrated informative
systems for the epidemic is certainly the right way to attain a deeper comprehension of
the phenomenon. Finally, we observe that in this framework, new data sources (such as
mobile phones, web-scraped data, and Internet-of-Things data10 used to trace the
movements of people) should provide useful contributions.

3. The basic sampling framework
In what follows, we aim to propose an observational protocol for the estimation of the
number of people infected by SARS-CoV-2 (Alleva et al., 2020). Starting from a population
where it has been ascertained that individuals are infected (the population contains
verified cases), the goal is to estimate the portion of the population that is infected but
shows no symptoms (the asymptomatic cases). For the purpose of the proposed
procedure, the individuals are preliminarily classified into two subgroups of interest,
which we refer to as Group A and Group B.
Group A is the subgroup consisting of individuals for which a state of infection has been
verified (they could be either hospitalized or in compulsory quarantine) and of all the
people who had contact with them in the previous days. Below, we propose to observe
the contacts made up to 14 days before the infection has been diagnosed, with this length
being the internationally accepted maximum incubation time. However, the unbiasedness
of the sampling strategy we propose is still valid (even if less efficient) if the contacts are
reconstructed for a shorter time period (e.g., 7 days). Therefore, this group contains all
individuals who are foreseen to be infected and not just those for whom their infection
status has already been ascertained. Therefore, this group represents both the apparent
and latent dimensions of the epidemic.
10

For example, data collected through images are useful for tracking the movements of people or vehicles or
for detecting gatherings in specific places.

5

Group B contains both healthy people for whom the infection is considered latent and
those whose infections are still in a phase of incubation, where symptoms can manifest at
a future moment in time (up to 14 days later).
The rationale for this breakdown of the population is related to the feasibility of the
observational scheme that we propose. Indeed, the proportion of infected people in Group
A is much larger than that observed in Group B. Moreover, the number of verified infected
people is known through the data collected by health public authorities. Thus, focusing
resource investments on observing the contacts of this group maximizes the number of
infected people observed in the sample. Nevertheless, it is necessary to observe Group B
to produce reliable estimates for the whole population, and this is mandatory for correctly
estimating the rate of infected people and the rate of lethality.
Estimates relative to the two subgroups may be obtained on the basis of continuous
observations over time and by following two distinct methodologies, both of which based
on what is known as indirect sampling (Lavalle, 2007; Kiesl, 2016). Indirect sampling is
the same technique that is commonly used for the estimation of rare and elusive
populations (Sudman, 1988; Thompson and Seber, 1996).
It is important to emphasize that the distinctive element of our proposal lies in the
estimate of the infected population obtained by combining the results obtained through
two samples drawn from populations A and B. This estimate can establish different roles
in relation to the various developmental phases of the epidemic (in terms of the sample
size and/or type of diagnostic assessment to be carried out).
At the beginning of the epidemic, the infection has the characteristics of rapidity,
unpredictability in terms of the level of spread, and apparent concentration in certain
geographical areas and categories of subjects. The response of the health system and the
containment measures to be used are not yet codified, nor is the behaviour of the
population that should be considered “responsible”. In this phase, an investigation
strategy based on indirect sampling appears to be coherent, with the strategy starting
from the immediate surroundings of subjects who have confirmed infections. This is the
sampling strategy proposed for Group A that, in addition to the estimation of a rare
phenomenon in the population, also provides an immediate (and continuous over time)
response to the epidemic where it explicitly manifests itself.
On the other hand, to measure the intensity and the evolution of the phenomenon for large
territorial domains and in general with regard to relevant characteristics of people
(gender, age, educational qualification, professional status and more), a traditional
population panel survey with sample rotation can be carried out for Group B. The survey
is associated with an indirect sampling mechanism so that it can trace and sample the
individuals who came into contact with the infected people found in this second sample.
This panel survey becomes fundamental during phases that follow the peaks of the
epidemic to measure not only the reduction in the number of infections (and therefore to
test the positive effects of the containment measures) but also the proportion of the
population that had contacts with the virus in the past. During the decline phase of the
epidemic (which naturally does not preclude the arrival of new infections in specific
territories and environments), the role of the sample from population Group B is
fundamental and representative of the entire population followed over time. On the other
hand, a diagnostic test must also be identified that takes the relative importance of the
infected population and the population susceptible to infection during the various phases
of the epidemic into account. From an operational point of view, it seems convenient to
rely on nasopharyngeal swabs for sampling the contacts in Group A, regardless of the
6

phase of the epidemic. For the panel survey, a serological examination may be more
convenient, particularly during the declining phase in combination with a part of the
sample yet to be evaluated (the swab is also administered to this portion11).
The combination of the two sampling strategies (with different weights for the ascending
and descending phases of the epidemic) represents the competitive advantage of our
proposal: it is a dynamic monitoring tool designed to be suitably calibrated both during
the growth phase of the infection, providing estimates according to different categories of
severity, and during the decline phase, with estimates extended to the parameters of the
progressive immunization model for the population.
The advantage of our proposal over a strategy based exclusively on indirect sampling or
only on the panel sample can be measured in terms of greater efficiency (and therefore
more accurate estimates) and lower investigation costs required to achieve the
predetermined levels of precision.
4. Specification of the total number of infected people and its breakdown
In what follows, let U be the population of interest of size N, and let k (𝑘 = 1, … , 𝑁) denote
a person belonging to it. Let 𝑣𝑘 be a dichotomous variable that assumes a value of 1 if the
state of infection is verified and a value of 0 otherwise. Let 𝑈𝑣 = {𝑘 ∈ 𝑈: 𝑣𝑘 = 1} be the
subpopulation of U for whom the infection is verified and let 𝑈𝐶 = 𝑈\𝑈𝑣 be the
complementary subset.
Let 𝑦𝑘 be the value of variable 𝓎, for person k, where 𝓎 is equal to 1 if the person is
infected and 0 otherwise. If 𝑣𝑘 = 1, then obviously 𝑦𝑘 = 1; however, if 𝑣𝑘 = 0, then it is
possible that either 𝑦𝑘 = 1 (an infected person for whom the infection has not yet been
verified) or 𝑦𝑘 = 0 (a healthy person).
The target parameter of our survey, Y, is the total number of infected people (verified or
not), that is:

(1) 𝑌 = ∑
𝑘∈𝑈

𝑦𝑘 .

Let 𝑙𝑘,𝑗 be a generic entry of a link matrix (k=1,2,…,N; j=1, 2,…N) that is equal to 1 if
individual 𝑘 had contacts with individual j in the past 14 days and 0 otherwise, with 𝑙𝑘,𝑘 =
1 by definition. Starting from 𝑈𝑣 , it is possible to determine the total number of infections
𝓎 related to Group A:

11

It is important to emphasize that while the swab allows for an estimation of the infected population at a given
moment in time, the serological test allows for the estimation of the portion of the population that had contact
with the virus without a time reference. On the other hand, both diagnostic tools provide estimates that are
affected by errors, and consequently, the estimates must be considered in probabilistic terms. In particular, to
ensure the reliability of the results, while the health protocols for the swab require that the test be repeated
over time to ascertain the healing of those who contracted the virus, for the serological examination, diagnostic
kits that ensure predetermined levels of specificity and sensitivity can be considered. For a discussion on the
impact of these errors in epidemic stages characterized by a different base rates of infection, see Fuggetta (2020).

7

𝑈𝐴 = {𝑗 ∈ 𝑈: ∑

𝑘∈𝑈𝑣

𝑙𝑘,𝑗 ≥ 1}

where 𝑈𝐴 includes the subset 𝑈𝑣 and all the contacts of the members of that subset. We
express this formally as:

(2) 𝑌𝐴 = ∑

∑
𝑘∈𝑈𝑣

1
𝑙𝑘,𝑗 𝑦𝑗 ,
𝑗∈𝑈 𝐿𝑣𝑗

where

(3) 𝐿𝑣𝑗 = ∑

𝑘∈𝑈𝑣

𝑙𝑘,𝑗

is a quantity introduced to control for the multiplicity of the measurement of 𝑦𝑗 among
the different k units of 𝑈𝑣 in Equation (2).
On the other hand, starting from 𝑈𝐶 , it is possible to determine the total number of
infections 𝓎 related to Group B:
𝑈𝐵 = {𝑗 ∈ 𝑈: ∑

𝑘∈𝑈𝐶

𝑙𝑘,𝑗 ≥ 1}

where 𝑈𝐵 includes 𝑈𝐶 and all the contacts of the infected people in 𝑈𝐶 :

(4) 𝑌𝐵 = ∑

𝑘∈𝑈𝐶

𝑦𝑘 ∑

1
𝑙𝑘,𝑗 𝑦𝑗 ,
𝑗∈𝑈 𝐿𝐶𝑗

where, analogously to Equation (3), the quantity

(5) 𝐿𝐶𝑗 = ∑

𝑘∈𝑈𝐶

𝑦𝑘 𝑙𝑘,𝑗

is introduced to control for the multiplicity of the measurement of 𝑦𝑗 in (4) among the
different k units in 𝑈𝐶 .
The sets 𝑈𝐴 and 𝑈𝐵 can obviously overlap. Let us define their intersection as the set
𝑈𝐴𝐵 = 𝑈𝐴 ∩ 𝑈𝐵 = {𝑗 ∈ 𝑈: 𝐿𝑣𝑗 𝐿𝐶𝑗 ≥ 1 }.
The total number of infected people 𝓎 in 𝑈𝐴 ∩ 𝑈𝐵 is given by:
(6) 𝑌𝐴𝐵 = ∑

𝑗∈𝑈:𝐿𝑣𝑗 𝐿𝐶𝑗 ≥1

𝑦𝑗 .

8

We may obtain alternative expressions of 𝑌𝐴𝐵 starting from the sampling frames of 𝑈𝑣
and 𝑈𝐶 :
(7𝑎) 𝑌𝐴𝐵 = ∑
(7𝑏) 𝑌𝐴𝐵 = ∑

∑
𝑘∈𝑈𝑣

𝑘∈𝑈𝐶

1
𝑙𝑘,𝑗 𝑦𝑗 𝕀(𝐿𝐶𝑗 ≥ 1),
𝑗∈𝑈 𝐿𝑣𝑗

𝑦𝑘 ∑

1
𝑙𝑘,𝑗 𝑦𝑗 𝕀(𝐿𝑣𝑗 ≥ 1)
𝑗∈𝑈 𝐿𝐶𝑗

where 𝕀(𝐴) equals 1 if A is true and 0 otherwise. The expressions (7 a) and (7.b) are
useful during the estimation phase, as illustrated in Section 6.3.
Finally, we have
(8) 𝑌 = 𝑌𝐴 + 𝑌𝐵 − 𝑌𝐴𝐵 .
The above setup is illustrated in Figure 1 below.

5. The sampling design
5.1. General description of the sampling schemas
Two independent samples, namely, 𝑆𝑣 and 𝑆𝐶 , are selected from the two population
subsets 𝑈𝑣 and 𝑈𝐶 , which represent the sampling frames. The contacts of all infected
people in each sample are tracked. The first sample 𝑆𝑣 is used to produce an unbiased

9

estimate of 𝑌𝐴 , while 𝑆𝐶 is used to estimate the total 𝑌𝐵 . The total 𝑌𝐴𝐵 is estimated from
both samples.
5.2. Sampling from 𝑈𝑣
The subset of the people with verified infections increases over time. It is therefore
necessary to set up a sampling mechanism that is realized continuously over time. To
simplify the sampling description, let us suppose that 𝑈𝑣 represents the set of people with
verified infections in a given time period. The sampling of 𝑈𝑣 is carried out in the following
phases:
a) A sample 𝑆𝑣 is selected without replacement from 𝑈𝑣 , where the inclusion
probabilities are 𝜋𝑣𝑘 (𝑘 = 1,2 … , #𝑈𝑣 ).
b) All the contacts 𝑈𝑘 = {𝑗 ∈ 𝑈: 𝑙𝑘,𝑗 = 1} of individual k (selected from 𝑆𝑣 ) are tracked
going back 14 days.
c) A sample 𝑆𝑣𝑘 is selected from 𝑈𝑘 without replacement and with equal probabilities
of inclusion 𝜋2𝑣|𝑘 . We use the “2” in 𝜋2𝑣|𝑘 to indicate that this is the inclusion
probability of the second stage of the sampling process given the selection of
person k in the first stage.
#𝑆

𝑣
At the end of the above process, the sample 𝑆𝐴 = 𝑆𝑣 ⋃𝑘=1
𝑆𝑣𝑘 is formed with an indirect
sampling mechanism that includes people from both 𝑆𝑣 (verified infected people) and
#𝑆𝑣
𝑆𝑣𝑘 (tracked contacts going back 14 days).
⋃𝑘=1

#𝑆

𝑣
The test for verifying an infection is carried out on all the tracked contacts ⋃𝑘=1
𝑆𝑣𝑘 . Thus,
the value of 𝓎 is known for all the people in 𝑆𝐴 .

Remark 1. The process of tracking all the contacts of a person could be complex and
cumbersome. Different solutions are possible. One possibility is to leverage digital apps,
allowing for epidemic control with digital contact tracing, as suggested by Ferretti et al.
(2020). Similarly, Ascani (2020) suggested a method based on personal interviews. In this
case, the interviewees must be guided in remembering their contacts by means of a
specific structure based on the reconstruction of the "social networks" contacted in the
days preceding the infection (Scott, 2000 and Yang et al ., 2016).
Remark 2. It is clear that for health and wellbeing reasons and to prevent the spread of
the infection, it would be best to examine all infected people. However, from a statistical
point of view, obtaining high-quality estimates regarding the number of infected persons
is not strictly necessary. From this point of view, it is more important to concentrate effort
on repeating the examination regularly over time. The effort required to perform a
complete study on the whole population would be unsustainable.

5.2.1. Definition of the sampling design
The sampling mechanism for selecting 𝑆𝑣 depends on how the data frames for 𝑈𝑣 are
organized. There are two main possibilities:
Option 1. The data of 𝑈𝑣 are available in a centralized data set that can be used for
selecting the sample.
Option 2. The data of 𝑈𝑣 are available only at a decentralized level so that each healthcare
institution has its own list.
10

The two available options are discussed in turn in the next two subsections.

5.2.1.1 Sampling mechanism for Option 1
If the sampling frame of the infected people is centralized in a unified dataset, one could
define a one-stage design by directly selecting the sample units from the dataset. The
selection of the sample can be carried out with the cube algorithm (Deville and Tillé, 2004,
2005), thus ensuring that the Narain Hortvitz-Tompson estimates (Narain, 1951; Horvitz
and Thompson, 1952) of the selected sample reproduce the known totals of some
auxiliary variables (e.g., distribution by sex and age, employment status, geographical
distribution, etc.).This can be expressed as follows:

∑

𝐱𝑘
=∑
𝐱𝑘 ,
𝑘∈𝑆𝑣 𝜋𝑣𝑘
𝑘∈𝑈𝑣

where 𝐱 𝑘 is a vector of P auxiliary variables available for unit k.
The definition of the optimal inclusion probabilities 𝜋𝑣𝑘 for indirect sampling that
minimize the cost and ensure a predefined level of accuracy for the sampling estimates
(or, inversely, minimize the sampling variances for a given budget) can be determined as
illustrated by Falorsi and Righi (2019). Tillé and Wilhelm (2017) suggested selecting a
sample satisfying Equation (9) through a balanced spatial sampling algorithm that is
somehow optimal in maximizing the entropy and minimizing the spatial correlations
between neighbouring units (Arbia, 1994; Arbia and Lafratta, 1997, 2002).
Falorsi and Righi (2015) demonstrated that balancing Equation (9) is quite general and
allows for the definition of a wide class of sampling designs, including simple random
sampling without replacement (SRSWOR), stratified random sampling without
replacement (STSRSWOR), stratified random sampling with probability proportional to
size (PPS), sampling designs with incomplete stratification (SDIS) and many others.
Assuming that an SRS design is used, to obtain the statistical estimates of the number of
infected persons in a given spatial (the whole national territory or specific geographic
area, such as, for example, a region) and temporal domain (week/day), it would be
sufficient to select approximately 1,000 individuals among the contacts of the infected set
of persons for testing. This sample size would ensure a reliable estimate with a sampling
error of approximately 5% under the assumption that the proportion of infected people
in the target population is approximately 25%.

5.2.1.2. Sampling mechanism for Option 2
If the sampling frames for 𝑈𝑣 are available only at the healthcare institution level, the
selection of units in 𝑆𝑣 can be carried out with a two-stage mechanism:
1.
First stage. A sample 𝑆1𝑣 of health care institutions is selected from the population
of health care institutions (call it 𝑈1𝑣 ). The first-stage sample is selected without
replacement and with PPS, where healthcare institution i is selected with an inclusion
probability given by:
(9) 𝜋1𝑖 = 𝑚

𝑀𝑖
,
𝑀

11

in which m is the selected number of healthcare institutions to be included in the firststage sample, 𝑀𝑖 is a measure of the size of unit i and M is the overall measure of size. We
may define the measure of size according to different criteria. A good option would be the
number of beds available for SARS-CoV-2 patients. The sampling of the health care
institutions can be carried out with the already-quoted “cube algorithm”, thus ensuring
that the Narain Hortvitz-Tompson estimates of the selected first-stage sample reproduce
the known characteristics of some auxiliary variables available for the population 𝑈1𝑣
(e.g., geographical distribution, number of beds available for SARS-CoV-2 patients, etc.).
This can be expressed as:

(10) ∑

𝐱1𝑣
=∑
𝐱𝑘 ,
𝑖∈𝑆1𝑣 𝜋1𝑣
𝑘∈𝑈1𝑣

where 𝐱1𝑣 is a vector of auxiliary variables for unit k. As suggested for Option 1, the sample
could be selected (satisfying Equation (10)) with a balanced spatial sampling algorithm
that is optimal, maximizes the entropy and minimizes the spatial correlations of the
neighbouring units. Even in this case, the balancing of Equation (10) allows us to define
the general class of sampling designs described by Falorsi and Righi (2015).
2.
Second stage. A fixed number, e.g., 𝑛̅, of infected people is selected from the sampled
institution by drawing the units without replacement via a simple random sampling
procedure.
In such a way, the sampling process is self-weighting (Murthy and Sethy, 1965) in the
sense that all the units in 𝑈𝑣 have an equal probability of being selected. Indeed, the final
inclusion probability of person k being selected from healthcare institution i is given by
the following expression:

The self-weighting property defines a sampling design that is somehow optimal (Kish,
1966) in the sense that it avoids the negative impact of the variability of the sampling
weights on the sampling variances.
The sampling selection criterion could be based on a time mechanism, as this is feasible
and easily implementable at a decentralized level. For instance, a sample of infected
people could be selected by considering those who had access to the healthcare institution
within a two-hour time period.
5.3. Sampling from 𝑈𝐶
In this section, we illustrate the sampling design for the first selection process, where we
sample a panel of individuals independently from 𝑆𝑣 for estimating the total 𝑌𝐵 .
Afterwards, we monitor these people repeatedly over time.
The operational aspects to be carried out in this first sampling process are as follows:
12

a) First, a sample 𝑆𝐶 is selected without replacement from 𝑈𝐶 , where the inclusion
probabilities are 𝜋𝐶𝑘 (𝑘 = 1,2 … , #𝑈𝐶 ).
b) The people in the panel take a diagnostic test on a regular basis (for example, once a
month). If member k of the panel receives a positive test result (i.e., 𝑦𝑘 = 1), all their
contacts 𝑈𝑘 are tracked up to 14 days back in time.
c) If 𝑦𝑘 = 1, a sample 𝑆𝐶𝑘 is selected from 𝑈𝑘 without replacement and with equal
inclusion probability 𝜋2𝐶|𝑘 . We adopt 𝜋2𝐶|𝑘 for the second stage inclusion probability,
where the same notation as that of 𝜋2𝑣|𝑘 is used. At the end of the whole process, the
#𝑆

𝐶
sample 𝑆𝐵 = 𝑆𝐶 ⋃𝑘=1:𝑦
𝑆 is formed with an indirect sampling mechanism,
𝑘 =1 𝐶𝑘
including people from both 𝑆𝐶 (people for whom their infection statuses are not
#𝑆𝐶
known) and ⋃𝑘=1:𝑦
𝑆 (tracked contacts of the infected people in 𝑆𝐶 , going back
𝑘 =1 𝐶𝑘
14 days).

Remark 3. The populations 𝑈𝑣 and 𝑈𝐶 change as a function of time. The panel can be
representative of the shifting population. We discuss this topic later on in Section 7. Here,
we note that in the subsequent surveys, the verified infected people in the panel are
automatically captured by the sampling mechanism defined for the population 𝑈𝑣 .
However, sample 𝑆𝐶 is smaller in size than the total population, observing only the nonverified infected people. This reduction in the sampling size makes it necessary to
regularly refresh the panel over time.

5.3.1. A note on some practicalities of the sampling design
The sampling design of the panel can be carried out according to different schemas,
depending on the availability of the frame and on other organizational aspects. One
possibility is to form a subsample from a regular survey of households carried out by
official statistics. Here, we assume that the frame of U is represented by a register that is
available at a central level and that for each sample unit, we form a set of auxiliary
variables. Furthermore, we assume that in this register, the subset 𝑈𝐶 can also be
identified.
In this informative context, a one-stage sampling design can be carried out with optimal
inclusion probabilities 𝜋𝐶𝑘 , as determined following the steps of Falorsi and Righi (2015,
2019). The sampling can then be carried out with a balanced spatial sampling algorithm
(Tillé and Wilhelm, 2017), thereby ensuring that the following balancing equations are
satisfied:

(12) ∑

𝐱𝑘
=∑
𝐱𝑘 .
𝑘∈𝑆𝐶 𝜋𝐶𝑘
𝑘∈𝑈𝐶

Remark 4. The panel can be constructed using a two-phase design so that the selection
process can be executed by pre-screening two sub-groups, namely:
•
•

A number of individuals who continue to travel (and are therefore more subject to
being infected than individuals who are not traveling).
A number of individuals with few contacts who fully observe the prescribed
quarantine recommendations.

13

Remark 5. The two-phase mechanism could be useful if the identification of 𝑈𝐶 cannot not
be carried out. This can be realized in the two-step pre-screening phase.
The number of persons involved in the panel may be approximately 1,000 (to obtain
approximately 1,200 tested individuals) for a given territorial and temporal sampling
domain, thus guaranteeing a reliable estimation with a sampling error of approximately
10% (assuming that the proportion of infected people in this target population is
approximately 10%).
5.4. Final comments on the sampling design
We first note that in our proposal, we subsample from the determined list of contacts. We
adopt this choice for controlling the costs associated with the survey. However, we could
extend the sample to all sets of contacts. Furthermore, if we continue tracking the contacts
until all the people being tracked are not infected, the adopted sampling design becomes
a classic adaptive schema (Thompson and Seeber, 1996), which can thus be seen as a
particular application of our proposal.
Given the complexity of the epidemiology of COVID-19, it may be useful to consider
subgroups in Group B. This may become useful based on the need to consider
heterogeneous models (i.e., considering heterogeneous populations), as this type of
model seems to be required for the infectious agent. In particular, it may be important to
consider breaking down certain epidemiological parameters into different subgroups
(e.g., transmission coefficient, time to become infectious, proportion of detected cases,
time from infection to detection, time to recover). Therefore, we suggest defining 4
subgroups considering two binary factors: low-risk/high-risk and low-mobility/highmobility. These subgroups are described as follows:
•
•
•

•

A number of individuals not belonging to high-risk groups who continue to travel/work
(and are therefore more subject to being infected and infectious than non-travellers).
A number of people not belonging to high-risk groups with few contacts who fully
observe the prescribed quarantine recommendations.
A number of individuals belonging to high-risk groups who continue to travel/work (and
are therefore more subject to being infected and infectious than non-travellers), such as
health-care workers.
A number of people belonging to high-risk groups with few contacts who fully observe
the prescribed quarantine recommendations.

For Group A, there might be some advantage in considering the same 4 subgroups, since
the transmission coefficient of each of these subgroups can be significantly different from
the others.
Considering 4 subgroups in both Groups A and B may impact the sample size required to
obtain a given sampling error at the subgroup level. Group B has the potential for enabling
the study of some crucial "invisible" parameters of the epidemiology of COVID-19 (e.g.,
the proportion of asymptomatic cases, the time for symptomatic and asymptomatic
people to become infectious, and even the proportion of undetected symptomatic cases)
in detail. This is also true for each of the 4 subgroups independently. The sample size for
Group B should be defined with this in mind. Population density is also an important
factor to control when designing the sampling process.

6. Sample estimation of the total number of infected people
We can compute a direct estimation of the total number of infected people Y for each time
and each territorial unit as:
(13) 𝑌̂ = 𝑌̂𝐴 + 𝑌̂𝐵 − 𝑌̂𝐴𝐵 ,
with
𝐴
𝐵
(14) 𝑌̂𝐴𝐵 = 𝛼𝑌̂𝐴𝐵
+ (1 − 𝛼)𝑌̂𝐴𝐵
,
𝐴
where 𝑌̂𝐴 and 𝑌̂𝐴𝐵
are the generalized weight share method (GWSM, Lavallé, 2007)
𝐵
estimates of the totals 𝑌𝐴 and 𝑌𝐴𝐵 derived from the sample 𝑆𝐴 ; 𝑌̂𝐵 and 𝑌̂𝐴𝐵
are the GWSM
estimates of the totals 𝑌𝐵 and 𝑌𝐴𝐵 calculated from the sample 𝑆𝐵 ; and 𝑌̂𝐴𝐵 is a convex
𝐴
𝐵
combination of the GWSM estimates 𝑌̂𝐴𝐵
and 𝑌̂𝐴𝐵
, with 0 ≤ 𝛼 ≤ 1. The parameter 𝛼 can
either be fixed in advance or calculated from the survey data. Further discussion on the
choice of 𝛼 is provided in Section 6.3.

6.1. Estimation of the component 𝑌̂𝐴
The GWSM estimator of the total number of infected people in group A, as expressed in
Equation (2), is given by:

(15) 𝑌̂𝐴 = ∑

1
1 1
∑
𝑙𝑘,𝑗 𝑦𝑗

𝑗∈𝑆𝑣𝑘 𝜋2𝑣|𝑘 𝐿𝑣𝑗

where

(16) ̂𝑍𝑣𝑘 = ∑

𝑙𝑘,𝑗 𝑦𝑗
𝑗∈𝑆𝑣𝑘 𝜋2𝑣|𝑘 𝐿𝑣𝑗

represents the second-stage estimate of

(17) 𝑍𝑣𝑘 = ∑

1
𝑙𝑘,𝑗 𝑦𝑗 .
𝑗∈𝑈𝑘 𝐿𝑣𝑗

Remark 6. The term 𝐿𝑣𝑗 in the previous equation corresponds to the total number of
contacts of unit j with people who have verified infections. It can be collected either with
digital contact tracing (Ferretti, 2020) or by interviews.

Proof of the unbiasedness of ̂𝑌𝐴
15

This proof can be found in Section 5.1 of Lavallée (2007). Denoting the sampling
expectation operator as 𝐸(∙), we have

(18) 𝐸(𝑌̂𝐴 ) = 𝐸 [∑

∑
𝑘∈𝑈𝑣

𝛿2𝑣𝑗|𝑘
𝛿𝑣𝑘
𝑙𝑘,𝑗 𝑦𝑗 ],
𝑗∈𝑈 𝜋𝑣𝑘 𝜋2𝑣|𝑘 𝐿𝑣𝑗

where 𝛿𝑣𝑘 is a dichotomous variable with 𝛿𝑣𝑘 = 1 if 𝑘 ∈ 𝑆𝑣 and 𝛿𝑣𝑘 = otherwise. 𝛿2𝑣𝑗|𝑘 is
a second dichotomous variable with 𝛿2𝑣𝑗|𝑘 = 1 if 𝑗 ∈ 𝑆𝑣𝑘 and 0 otherwise.
From Equation (18), we obtain:

(19) 𝐸(𝑌̂𝐴 ) = ∑

∑
𝑘∈𝑈𝑣

𝐸(𝛿𝑣𝑘 𝛿2𝑣𝑗|𝑘 ) 1
𝑙𝑘,𝑗 𝑦𝑗 .
𝑗∈𝑈 𝜋𝑣𝑘 𝜋2𝑣|𝑘 𝐿𝑣𝑗

However, since:
(20) 𝐸(𝛿𝑣𝑘 𝛿2𝑣𝑗|𝑘 ) = 𝐸[𝛿𝑣𝑘 𝐸(𝛿2𝑣𝑗|𝑘 |𝛿𝑣𝑘 = 1)] = 𝐸[𝛿𝑣𝑘 𝜋2𝑣|𝑘 ] = 𝜋𝑣𝑘 𝜋2𝑣|𝑘 ,
plugging Equation (20) into Equation (19), we finally obtain:

𝐸(𝑌̂𝐴 ) = ∑

∑
𝑘∈𝑈𝑣

Q. E. D.

Variance of ̂𝑌𝐴
The main results on this topic can also be found in Section 5.1 of Lavallée (2007). On the
basis of the theorem on two-stage sampling (Cochran, 1977), the variance of 𝑌̂𝐴 can be
expressed as follows:
1

𝑍𝑣𝑘 ) + ∑
𝑉2 (∑
𝑙𝑘,𝑗 𝑦𝑗 ,).
𝑘∈𝑆𝑣 𝜋𝑣𝑘
𝑘∈𝑈𝑣 𝜋𝑣𝑘
𝑗∈𝑆𝑣𝑘 𝜋2𝑣|𝑘 𝐿𝑣𝑗
In the previous expression, the variance is decomposed into the sum of the firststage variance (𝑉1 ) and the first-stage expectation of the second-stage variance (𝑉2). All
the elements of the previous expression can be estimated with standard statistical
inferential techniques (see Horvitz and Thompson, 1952 and Kish, 1965).
(21) 𝑉(𝑌̂𝐴 ) = 𝑉1 (∑

6.2. Estimation of the component 𝑌̂𝐵
The GWSM estimator of the component 𝑌̂𝐵 is given by:

16

(22) 𝑌̂𝐵 = ∑

𝑦𝑘 ∑
𝑙𝑘,𝑗 𝑦𝑗
𝑘∈𝑆𝐶 𝜋𝐶𝑘
𝑗∈𝑆𝐶𝑘 𝜋2𝐶|𝑘 𝐿𝐶𝑗

where the term

(23) 𝑍̂𝐶𝑘 = 𝑦𝑘 ∑

1

1
𝑙𝑘,𝑗 𝑦𝑗
𝑗∈𝑆𝐶𝑘 𝜋2𝐶|𝑘 𝐿𝐶𝑗

represents the estimate of

(24) 𝑍𝐶𝑘 = 𝑦𝑘 ∑

1
𝑙𝑘,𝑗 𝑦𝑗 .
𝑗∈𝑈𝑘 𝐿𝐶𝑗

Proof of the unbiasedness of 𝑌̂𝐵
To prove the unbiasedness of 𝑌̂𝐵 , we start with:

(25) 𝐸(𝑌̂𝐵 ) = ∑

𝑘∈𝑈𝐶

𝑦𝑘 ∑

𝐸(𝛿𝐶𝑘 𝛿2𝐶𝑗|𝑘 ) 1
𝑙𝑘,𝑗 𝑦𝑗 ,
𝑗∈𝑈𝑘 𝜋𝐶𝑘 𝜋2𝐶|𝑘 𝐿𝐶𝑗

where 𝛿𝐶𝑘 is a dichotomous variable with 𝛿𝐶𝑘 = 1 if 𝑘 ∈ 𝑆𝐶 and 𝛿𝐶𝑘 =0 otherwise. 𝛿2𝐶𝑗|𝑘
is a dichotomous variable with 𝛿2𝐶𝑗|𝑘 = 1 if 𝑦𝑘 = 1 ∩ 𝑗 ∈ 𝑆𝐶𝑘 and 0 otherwise.
However, we have:
(26) 𝐸(𝛿𝐶𝑘 𝛿2𝐶𝑗|𝑘 ) = 𝐸[𝛿𝐶𝑘 𝐸(𝛿2𝐶𝑗|𝑘 |𝛿𝐶𝑘 = 1)] = 𝐸[𝛿𝐶𝑘 𝜋2𝐶|𝑘 ] = 𝜋𝐶𝑘 𝜋2𝐶|𝑘 .
From Equations (25) and (26) it follows that:

𝐸(𝑌̂𝐵 ) = ∑

𝑘∈𝑈𝐶

𝑦𝑘 ∑

1
𝑙𝑘,𝑗 𝑦𝑗 .
𝑗∈𝑈 𝐿𝐶𝑗

Q. E. D.

The term 𝐿𝐶𝑗 corresponds to the total number of contacts of unit j with people who have
unverified infections. Similar to the estimation process of 𝑌̂𝐵 , this information can be
collected either with digital contact tracing or by interviews. Alternatively, we can
determine 𝐿𝐶𝑗 by following a back-tracing process: if unit j is infected, we should test the
all their contacts for COVID-19.
17

Variance of 𝑌̂𝐵
The variance may be obtained by simply adapting expression (21):
(27) 𝑉(𝑌̂𝐵 ) = 𝑉1 (∑

1
1
1 1
𝑍𝐶𝑘 ) + ∑
𝑉2 (𝑦𝑘 ∑
𝑙𝑘,𝑗 𝑦𝑗 ).
𝑘∈𝑆𝐶 𝜋𝐶𝑘
𝑘∈𝑈𝐶 𝜋𝐶𝑘
𝑗∈𝑆𝐶𝑘 𝜋2𝐶|𝑘 𝐿𝐶𝑗

6.3. Estimation of the component 𝑌̂𝐴𝐵
Starting from expression (7 a), by using the data from sample 𝑆𝐴 , we obtain the GWSM
unbiased estimator of 𝑌𝐴𝐵 as:
𝐴
(28) 𝑌̂𝐴𝐵
=∑

1
1 1
∑
𝑙𝑘,𝑗 𝑦𝑗 𝕀(𝐿𝐶𝑗 ≥ 1).
𝑘∈𝑆𝑣 𝜋𝑣𝑘
𝑗 ∈𝑆𝑣𝑘 𝜋2𝑣|𝑘 𝐿𝑣𝑗

Starting from expression (7b), by using the data from sample 𝑆𝐵 , we derive the GWSM
unbiased estimator of 𝑌𝐴𝐵 as:
𝐵
(29) 𝑌̂𝐴𝐵
=∑

1
1 1
∑
𝑙𝑘,𝑗 𝑦𝑗 𝕀(𝐿𝑣𝑗 ≥ 1).
𝑘∈𝑆𝐶 𝜋𝐶𝑘
𝑗∈𝑆𝐶 𝜋2𝐶|𝑘 𝐿𝐶𝑗

The information about the intersection of the samples with the subpopulation 𝑈𝐴𝐵 may
be collected either during the interviews or with digital contact tracing.
Singh and Mecatti (2011) provided an in-depth illustration of the different approaches in
the literature that are used find the optimal value of 𝛼 in the context of multiple frame
surveys. Hartley (1962, 1974) proposed choosing 𝛼 in (14) to minimize the variance of 𝑌̂.
Because the frames are sampled independently, the variance of 𝑌̂ is:
𝐴
𝐵
(31) 𝑉(𝑌̂) = 𝑉(𝑌̂𝐴 ) + 𝑉(𝑌̂𝐵 ) + 𝛼 2 𝑉(𝑌̂𝐴𝐵
) + (1 − 𝛼)2 𝑉(𝑌̂𝐴𝐵
)+
𝐴 ̂
𝐵 ̂
−2𝛼𝐶𝑜𝑣 (𝑌̂𝐴𝐵
, 𝑌𝐴 ) − 2(1 − 𝛼) 𝐶𝑜𝑣 (𝑌̂𝐴𝐵
, 𝑌𝐵 ).

Thus, for general survey designs, the variance-minimizing value of 𝛼 is:

(32) 𝛼𝑜𝑝𝑡 =

𝐵 ̂
𝐴 ̂
𝑉(𝑌̂𝐵 ) + 𝐶𝑜𝑣 (𝑌̂𝐴𝐵
, 𝑌𝐵 ) − 𝐶𝑜𝑣 (𝑌̂𝐴𝐵
, 𝑌𝐴 )
.
𝑉(𝑌̂𝐴 ) + 𝑉(𝑌̂𝐵 )

Unfortunately, the above quantity depends on the variable y.
Note that if one of the covariances in (32) is large, it is possible for 𝛼 𝑜𝑝𝑡 to be smaller than
0 or greater than 1. Hartley (1974) suggested opting for this alternative expression:

(33) 𝛼∗ =

𝑉(𝑌̂𝐵 )
𝑉(𝑌̂𝐴 ) + 𝑉(𝑌̂𝐵 )

.

18

Unbiasedness and variance. The proof of unbiasedness and the calculation of the variance
of the estimator 𝑌̂𝐴𝐵 are straightforward extensions of what has been illustrated in
Sections 6.1 and 6.2.
Remark 7. Lavallé and Rivest (2012) proposed estimating the total Y with the generalized
capture-recapture estimator (GCRE), which makes joint use of the capture-recapture
Petersen estimator and GWSM estimators. In our context, the GCRE estimator may be
expressed as:

(34) 𝑌̂𝐺𝐶𝑅𝐸 =

𝑌̂𝐴 𝑌̂𝐵
𝑌̂𝐴𝐵(𝑆𝐴∩𝑆𝐵)

,

where 𝑌̂𝐴𝐵(𝑆𝐴∩𝑆𝐵 ) is the estimate of 𝑌𝐴𝐵 that is computed on the basis of the units observed
in the intersection 𝑆𝐴 ∩ 𝑆𝐵 . The sampling weights for producing the estimates from 𝑆𝐴 ∩
𝑆𝐵 are given in formula (11) in the abovementioned paper. With respect to expression
(28), the GCRE estimator allows for estimating the hidden population that would not be
visible with either the public health structure or with the panel survey (e.g., the people
who died at home), and this group is very difficult to capture with the usual survey
techniques. The main problem for adopting the GCRE estimator is that it would require
an overlap of the samples of Groups A and B.
Remark 8. In Section 8 and in the Appendix, we see that the maximum efficiency is
achieved by sampling from 𝑈𝑣 . At the same time, collecting the value of the variable 𝐿𝐶𝑗
could be complex due to the need to set up a back-tracing process. Thus, a feasible
alternative strategy for the estimation of Y could be represented by:
𝐴
𝑌̂𝑎𝑙𝑡 = 𝑌̂𝐴 + 𝑌̂𝐶 − 𝑌̂𝐴𝐶
,
𝐴
where 𝑌̂𝑐 is the standard Narain-HT estimate of the total 𝓎 in 𝑈𝐶 and 𝑌̂𝐴𝐶
is the GWSM estimate
of the total 𝓎 in the intersection of 𝑈𝐴 with 𝑈𝐶 obtained by the sample 𝑆𝐴 . These terms are as
follows:

𝑌̂𝑐 = ∑

where 𝐿𝑗 is the total number of contacts of unit j.

7. Sampling design for follow-ups of the survey in subsequent waves
The observational scheme proposed in the above sections is set up as a cross-sectional
survey. However, it can be adapted for monitoring the evolution of the number of infected
people over time; this is done according to a mechanism that is updated like a chain
mechanism time after time. While an in-depth study of this aspect deserves a separate
study, we limit ourselves here to introducing the topic and to providing some initial
indications.
Let us consider two consecutive points in time, e.g., 𝑡 = 0 and 𝑡 = 1.
19

Assume person k is verified as infected at time 0 and is hence denoted as 𝑣0,𝑘 = 1. This
person may still be infected (𝑣1,𝑘 = 𝑦1,𝑘 = 1), or she/he may no longer be infected (𝑦1,𝑘 =
0) because of death (denoted by the dichotomous variable 𝑑1,𝑘 = 1) or healing (denoted
by the dichotomous variable ℎ1,𝑘 = 1).
The total of the 𝓎 variable at time 1 may then be defined as:
(35) 𝑌1 = 𝑌0 + ∆𝐷0→1 + ∆𝐻0→1 + ∆𝑌1 ,
where 𝑌0 is the total number of infections at time 0 and:
(36) ∆𝐷0→1 = ∑

𝑘∈𝑈

𝑦0,𝑘 𝑑1,𝑘 ,

∆𝐻0→1 = ∑

𝑘∈𝑈

𝑦0,𝑘 ℎ1,𝑘 , ∆𝑌1 = ∑

𝑘∈𝑈

(1 − 𝑦0,𝑘 ) 𝑦1,𝑘 .

In Equation (36), the quantity (𝑌0 + ∆𝐷0→1 + ∆𝐻0→1 ) indicates the total number of
verified infected people at time 0 who are still infected at time 1, while the quantity ∆𝑌1
denotes the total number of new infections.
The updating of the sampling structures illustrated in the previous sections allows us to
obtain a direct estimate of each of the components of (35), as illustrated in Figure 2.
The total ∆𝑌1can be estimated, as described in Section 5, using two sources of data,
namely:
•

The sample 𝑆1,𝑣 , which automatically captures the new entrants into the verified
infected population at time 1. These new entrants are denoted by ∆𝑈1,𝑣 , since the
sampling selection is carried out on this population continuously over time. Then, a
sample of their contacts can obtained as described in Section 4.2, resulting in the
sample 𝑆1,𝐴 .

•

The panel 𝑆0,𝐶 , which is selected at time 𝑡 = 0 and is updated over time, since the
tests carried out at time 𝑡 = 1 on the individuals of 𝑆0,𝐶 distinguish the newly
infected people of the panel. Then, tracking the contacts of the infected people allows
us to obtain the sample 𝑆1,𝐵 .

The estimation of the totals (𝑌0 + ∆𝐷0→1 + ∆𝐻0→1 ) can be obtained by following up on the
health statuses of the infected people captured by the samples 𝑆0,𝐴 and 𝑆0,𝐵 at time 0. The
estimates are then obtained with the sampling weights computed at time 0.
Therefore, we have:
̂ 0→1 + ∆𝐻
̂ 0→1 + ∆𝑌
̂1 ,
(37) 𝑌̂1 = 𝑌̂0 + ∆𝐷
̂ 0→1 , ∆𝐻
̂ 0→1 , ∆𝑌
̂1 are the direct estimates of the quantities
where 𝑌̂0 , ∆𝐷
𝑌0 , ∆𝐷0→1 , ∆𝐻0→1 , ∆𝑌1, respectively. The above mechanism can be updated in a chain
mechanism, and thus the estimate for any time 𝑡 > 1 is obtained as:
̂ 𝑡−1→𝑡 + ∆𝐻
̂ 𝑡−1→𝑡 + ∆𝑌
̂𝑡 .
(38) 𝑌̂𝑡 = 𝑌̂𝑡−1 + ∆𝐷
20

8. A note on the efficiency of the proposed strategy
To derive the efficiency of the estimators, we need to specify different cases that may
occur, where these cases related to the intersection between the samples from population
groups A and B. Here, we consider only two rather realistic cases, which are illustrated in
Figure 3.
•

Case 1. The samples from Groups A and B have the same size, and there is a strong
intersection between the two groups. This case could characterize the situation in
which there is no control of the infection. In this case, the proportions 𝛾𝐴 = 𝑌𝐴𝐵 ⁄𝑌𝐴
and 𝛾𝐵 = 𝑌𝐴𝐵 ⁄𝑌𝐵 are slightly smaller than 1. Thus, it is possible to consider 𝛾𝐴 ≅ 1 and
𝛾𝐵 ≅ 1.

•

Case 2. The sample from Group A is much smaller than the sample from Group B, and
there is a strong intersection between the sample from Group A and the intersection
between the two samples. In this case, we can consider 𝛾𝐴 ≅ 1 and 𝛾𝐵 ≪ 1. This case
could be that in which the infection is controlled by locking down the people.

21

Figure. 3. Two realistic cases of intersections between the samples from Groups A and B

Below, we summarize a result from simple random sampling that may be useful to better
understand the efficiency of the strategy proposed here. We give all the details in the
Appendix.
Let us suppose that a sample S of size n is selected from U with a SRSWOR design. Let

For a large N and small 𝑓, the anticipated variance (AV) of 𝑌̂𝐻𝑇,𝑆𝑅𝑆 can be approximated by

Let 𝑈𝑦𝑙 = {𝑘, 𝑗: 𝑦𝑘 = 1, 𝑦𝑘 𝑙𝑘,𝑗 = 1; 𝑘, 𝑗 = 1, … , 𝑁 } denote the sub-population of infected
people and those who have had contact with them. Let 𝜗 = 𝑌/#𝑈𝑦𝑙 be the proportion of
infected people in 𝑈𝑦𝑙 , with 𝜇 ≪ 𝜗. Let us suppose that the sample S is allocated
proportionally between the two frames 𝑈𝑣 and 𝑈𝐶 and that a SRSWOR is performed in
each frame. Thus, the sample sizes of 𝑈𝑣 and 𝑈𝐶 are 𝑃𝑣 𝑛 and (1 − 𝑃𝑣 )𝑛, respectively.

9. Empirical evaluations of the proposed method: a Monte Carlo study
9.1 Artificial data generation
Since it is not possible at this stage to include a numerical illustration using real-life
sample data, in this section, we report the results of a series of Monte Carlo experiments
that numerically justify our proposed ideas and show their statistical performances in an
artificial, although as realistic as possible, context.
Before showing our simulation results, we need to clarify the criteria we used in the data
generation process and those employed in the generation of the geographical map on
which the data are observed. This second element is essential given the peculiar nature of
the transmission mechanism, which requires physical proximity between infected people.
First, to simulate an artificial population describing the time evolution of an epidemic, we
considered a popular model constituted by a system of six differential equations that, at
each moment in time, describe six categories of individuals, namely, susceptible people
(S), those exposed to the virus (E), those infected with symptoms (I), those without
symptoms (A) and those that are removed from the population either because they healed
(R) or are dead (D). This modelling framework is a result of the seminal contribution of
Hamer (1906), Kermack and McKendrick (1927) and Soper (1929), and it is often
referred to as the “SIR model” due to the initials of the categories considered in the first
simplified formulation: Susceptibles, Infected and Removed. A comprehensive overview
of this model is contained in Cliff et al. (1981). See also Vynnycky and White (2010).
Figure 4 diagrammatically describes the transitions between the 6 categories. For the
random data generation process, we assumed that if infected, a susceptible person in the
population (S) would remain in the exposed state (E) for 5 days. After that period, the
subject could either become infected with symptoms (I) with probability 0.25 or without
symptoms (asymptomatic; symbol A) with probability 0.75. An asymptomatic person
remains infected (and so is still able to transmit the virus) for 14 days. After this period,
all asymptomatic patients are considered healed and pass to the “removed” category (R).
In contrast, the infected people showing symptoms heal with a probability of 0.85 or die
(D) with a probability of 0.15 (death rate case).
Figure 4. The six basic categories of our simulation model and their transition patterns.

For the map generation process, we considered a population distributed across 25 spatial
units laid on a regular 5-by-5 square lattice grid. Each square of the grid contains a
number of individuals randomly drawn from a uniform distribution ranging between 800
24

and 1,000. After performing a simulation exercise with these parameter values, we
obtained an artificial population with a total of 22,217 individuals.
This geographical representation is very general in that the map generated in this way
can represent, e.g., a city divided into blocks, a region divided into smaller spatial unions,
or any other meaningful geographical partition.
The contagion mechanism is favoured for studying human mobility. In our exercise, we
assumed that at any moment in time, a certain percentage m of the population could move
between the squares. We distinguished two epidemic phases. In Phase 1, people are free
to move, and this percentage is m=0.03, while Phase 2 describes a period of lockdown
when mobility is discouraged and m=0.01. In particular, we considered Phase 1 as a
period of 4 weeks and Phase 2 as the period containing the 8 subsequent weeks.
Communication during the lockdown period is limited not only by the number of people
who move but also by the extent of their movements. This is a further simulation
parameter that is generated by a uniform distribution ranging from -4 to 4 during Phase
1 (thus allowing movements in and out of the cells) and between -1 and 1 during Phase 2.
Given the mobility pattern described above, contagion is determined by social
interactions and contact opportunities. The number of contacts in each square of the grid
is assumed to be determined by a random number drawn from a Poisson distribution with
a parameter, i.e., cn, while the number of people involved in the movements is also a
Poisson number characterised by a different parameter cp. Given these assumptions,
contagion occurs in the following way. If in a meeting at least one asymptomatic or
exposed person is present, im susceptible people are infected and are moved into the
“exposed” category. In our runs of the simulation, we considered Phase 1 to be
characterised by the following parameters: cn = 20; cp = 5; im = 3. In contrast, during
Phase 2, the three parameters became cn = 3, cp = 3, and im = 2, reflecting the decreased
chances of contact between people. Figure 2 describes the time evolutions of the six
categories of people in our simulated epidemics. As already stated, we considered Phase
1 to include 4 weeks (day 1 to day 28) and Phase 2 to include 8 weeks (day 29 to day 84).
Figure 5 shows that despite the many assumptions that we were forced to include in the
simulation, the contagion curves are very similar to those observed worldwide in the
recent 2020 SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

1 refers to days 1- 28. Phase 2 refers to days 29-84.

9.2 Simulation results
We present the main results obtained in the simulation exercise. Using the artificial
population generated as described in the previous section, we considered the situation of
a repeated sampling survey realized at three moments in time, namely, at day 15 (during
the beginning of Phase 1), at day 25 (still in Phase 1, but in a situation closer to a plateau)
and at day 35, during the period of lockdown. The infection situations at the three
timepoints are reported in Table 1, where the results of the samples in Groups A and B
and their intersection (see Figure 3) are separated.

their intersection observed on different days.

For group A, we fixed the parameter g = 0.9, while for group B, the parameters f and 𝜈
were fixed as follows: 𝑓 = 0; 𝜈 = 12.
The sample sizes obtained with such parameter definitions (both excluding and including
the contacts) are reported in Table 2 by distinguishing between 4 sample situations,
26

namely, (i) A1B2: when both the individuals belonging to Group A and all their contacts
are sampled while in Group B, both the noninfected and all contacts are sampled; (ii)
A1B3: when both the individuals belonging to Group A and their contacts are sampled,
while in Group B, the noninfected are sampled with all contacts (with a maximum of 𝜈 =
12); (iii) A2B2: when all individuals belonging to Group A but only a subset of their
contacts are included in the sample, and in Group B, the noninfected are sampled with all
their contacts; and, finally, (iv) A2B3: when all individuals belonging to Group A but only
a subset of their contacts are included in the sample, while in Group B, the noninfected
are sampled with all their contacts but only up to a maximum of 𝜈 = 12 individuals. Note
that on day 35, we have fewer contacts in the sample than on day 25 due to the lockdown
measures considered.

Sampling scheme description: A1 = All individuals in Group A and their contacts are totally sampled; A2 = All individuals in Group A
and a subset of their contacts are sampled; B2 = A subset of Group B and all their contacts are sampled; B3 = A subset of Group B
and all their contacts are sampled, but only up to a maximum of 𝜈 = 12 individuals.

The main results of the simulation are reported in Table 3, and they show that in all
sampling settings, the relative bias of our scheme is very small, and our estimators
dramatically outperform simple random sampling in terms of efficiency (the ratio of the
standard error of the proposed estimator computed by the simulation to that of the HT
estimator for simple random sampling without replacement). In particular, the relative
bias is on the order of 0.01% during Phase 1, while during Phase 2, it depends on the
adoption of a sampling scheme with high precision when both the individuals belonging
to Group A and their contacts are included in the sampling process. In contrast, the
relative bias obviously increases when only a subset of the contacts is observed.
Furthermore, our method outperforms the simple random sample in terms of efficiency.
Similar to the case of bias, the relative advantage of our scheme over the simple random
sample with respect to efficiency is greatest in the case of the A1 sample scheme when all
selected individuals and their contacts are included in the sample, while it is lowest in the
case of A2 when only a subset of them is observed. Moreover, Table 3 also displays a
decrease in the relative advantage of our method for the day 35 wave, where due to the
lockdown restrictions, the number of contacts is very limited.

27

The results presented here depend greatly on the particular settings of the (many)
parameters involved in the simulation that describe different epidemic evolutions. To
mitigate such subjectivity, we also run many other Monte Carlo experiments using
different parameter values. Although they are available upon request, these results are
not reported here for the sake of succinctness. However, they all confirm the same
features: our method has a very low relative absolute bias and it is superior to the simple
random sampling scheme in terms of efficiency.

10. Conclusions and future challenges
The aim of this paper is to draw the attention of researchers and decision makers to the
need to observe the characteristics of the COVID-19 pandemic through a formal sampling
design, thus overcoming the limitations of data collected on a convenience basis. Only in
this way will we be able to produce both reliable estimates of the current situation and
forecasts of the future evolution processes of epidemics so that we can make empirically
grounded decisions about public health monitoring and surveillance, especially in the
transition phase between the decline from the epidemic peak and the relaxation of
quarantine measures.
In such a situation, it is essential to set up a system of data collection that allows for
statistically valid comparisons over time and across different geographic areas by taking
different economic, demographic, social, environmental and cultural contexts into
account.

28

We believe that clear knowledge of the phenomenon is also necessary for the population
to become aware of it and to adopt responsible behaviours. Trust and sharing must be
grounded on a solid information base.
In comparison with other possible observational strategies, the proposal in this paper has
three elements of strength:
•

•

•

Relevance. The proposed sampling scheme, designed to capture most of the
infected people through an indirect sampling mechanism, not only aims at
providing a snapshot of the phenomenon at a single moment in time but is
designed as a continuous survey that repeated in several waves over time. It also
takes the different target variables in different stages of epidemic development
into account and contributes to the implementation of a statistical surveillance
system for the epidemic that could be integrated with existing systems managed
by the health authorities.
Accuracy (Eurostat, 2017). In this paper, the properties of the estimators have
been formally proven and confirmed by analysing the results of a set of Monte
Carlo experiments. The results guarantee the reliability of the estimators in terms
of unbiasedness, and their efficiency is higher than that of a simple random sample.
Timeliness. The sampling design is operable immediately, as this is required by the
emergency we are experiencing. Indeed, this paper represents the statistical
formalization of a recent proposal (Alleva et al., 2020) and has been accompanied
by a technical note that describes the different phases into which it is divided, the
subjects involved and the crucial aspects required for its success (Ascani, 2020).

Although our effort with regard to the pandemic has progressed during this phase of the
emergency, there is room for much methodological and statistical research in terms of
setting up statistical instruments for producing reliable and timely estimates of the
phenomenon. Indeed, from a methodological point of view, while in this paper we have
fully derived the properties of the estimators in the cross-sectional case, the properties in
subsequent waves still need to be proven formally. Among other aspects to be developed,
we mention those related to time and spatial correlations, which are useful both for
modelling the phenomenon and for designing an efficient spatial sampling technique to
achieve the same level of precision as that of the current method but with fewer sample
units (Arbia and Lafratta, 2002). A specific extension of the spatial sampling techniques
to be further developed is the use of capture/recapture techniques (Borchers, 2009;
Lavallée and Rivest, 2012), which would require an overlap of the samples in Groups A
and B. A further improvement to be explored could be derived from applying the
Dorfmann procedure (Dorfmann, 1943) to reduce the number of tests and the cost of our
method.
In addition to the methodological advances, other general aspects to be developed in concert
with different specialists are the integration of the statistical system proposed here with
the health authority's surveillance system for infected people and the use of their contacttracking devices for statistical purposes. These devices could be useful both for the
identification of contacts and for measuring the propensity of people to travel and the
connected risks of doing so. To this end, it could be interesting to study the possibility of
considering, within our framework, the proposal developed by Saunders-Hastings et al.
29

(2017), who addressed the problem of monitoring during a pandemic via a model
approach. The need to monitor pandemics over time should represent the motivation for
building an integrated surveillance system. This system should merge three different
pieces of information within a unified database: (i) the information collected by the
administrative institutions when receiving and treating individuals who have turned to
the healthcare system; (ii) the statistical information collected on purpose with the aim of
accurately measuring the diffusion of an infection; and finally, (iii) the data obtained
through new sources for tracking the movements of people and their contacts.
A third extension of our proposal concerns the operational point of view. Indeed, the
sampling design described in detail in Section 5 should be accompanied by the definitions
of some key points:
•

•

•
•

•
•

A control room that ensures the necessary inter-institutional collaboration for
guiding field operations (Health Authorities at the national and regional levels,
Statistical Offices, others).
An effective information campaign to promote participation among the
population; the required legal framework to assure the collection and analysis of
personal data.
A medical testing procedure to consider for the selected population (swabs, blood
testing and DNA mapping).
The geographical-temporal estimation domains of interest and the sample
dimensions on the basis of the information needs and the available financial and
organizational resources.
The frequency of sampling for Groups A and B, as well as the length of stay in the
panel of group B.
The sociodemographic characteristics, living conditions and mobility behaviours
to be collected at the individual and family levels to shed light on relative risks and
to evaluate the effects of the policies adopted for modifying the evolution of the
epidemic.

This can only be achieved if epidemiologists, virologists, and administrators of healthcare
institutions work in conjunction with experts in mathematical and statistical modelling
and forecasting and experts in the evaluation of public policies.
We designed the sampling mechanism considering the Italian situation, and we proved its
feasibility by defining the previous key points to estimate the times and costs of our
method (Alleva et al., 2020)12. In adopting the suggested strategy, different countries may
require adjustments to take the peculiarities of their specific health system and
institutional framework into account. For this research direction, the contributions of the
National Statistical Offices, as well as common actions and the sharing of experiences at
the European and worldwide levels, will be essential.
The sample size required to assure a certain level of accuracy for the estimates depends on the base rate
of infection. The unit cost of administering the swab and serological tests relies on the level of
involvement in the survey by the public health authorities. The total cost depends on the length and the
periodicity of the panel survey. For Italy, we estimated the cost of data collection at the national and
regional levels (21 regions), for a case with 3 months of monitoring, a panel survey every 15 days and a
base rate of infection of 0.04. With regard to Groups A and B, the sample sizes are 1,000 and 1,200 units,
and this implies requirements of 6,000 and 7,200 swabs and total costs of 210,000 and 252,000 euros,
respectively.

APPENDIX
For the estimator in Equation (39), the following model can be assumed:
(𝐴1) 𝐸𝑀 (𝑦𝑘 ) = 𝜇, 𝑉𝑀 (𝑦𝑘 ) = 𝜇(1 − 𝜇) for 𝑘 = 1, … , 𝑁,
where 𝐸𝑀 and 𝑉𝑀 denote the expectation and variance of the model, respectively.
According to the above model, the anticipated variance of the estimate 𝑌̂𝐻𝑇,𝑆𝑅𝑆 may be
defined as (Falorsi and Righi, 1915, Appendix 4):
(𝐴2) 𝐴𝑉(𝑌̂𝐻𝑇,𝑆𝑅𝑆 ) =

The approximation in (A3) holds for large N and small 𝑓 values.
For the estimators in Equation (41), we can introduce the following model:
(𝐴4) 𝐸𝑀 (𝑦𝑘 ) = 𝜗, 𝑉𝑀 (𝑦𝑘 ) = 𝜗(1 − 𝜗) for 𝑘 ∈ 𝑈𝑦𝑙 .
Furthermore, for the variables 𝑦𝑗 (𝐿𝐶𝑗 ≥ 1) and 𝑦𝑗 (𝐿𝑣𝑗 ≥ 1), we can adopt the
hypothesis that the probabilities

(𝐴5) 𝑃(𝐿𝐶𝑗 ≥ 1|𝑘 ∈ 𝑈𝑣 ∩ 𝑙𝑘,𝑗 = 1 ) ≅ 𝛾𝐴
𝑃(𝐿𝑣𝑗 ≥ 1|𝑘 ∈ 𝑈𝐶 ∩ 𝑦𝑘,𝑗 𝑙𝑘,𝑗 = 1 ) ≅ 𝛾𝐵
are roughly constant. Then, we may derive the following models:
(𝐴6) 𝐸𝑀 [𝑦𝑗 (𝐿𝐶𝑗 ≥ 1)] = 𝜗𝛾𝐴 , 𝑉𝑀 [𝑦𝑗 (𝐿𝐶𝑗 ≥ 1)] = 𝜗𝛾𝐴 (1 − 𝜗𝛾𝐴 ) for𝑘 ∈ 𝑈𝑣 ∩ 𝑙𝑘,𝑗 = 1,
𝐸𝑀 [𝑦𝑗 (𝐿𝑣𝑗 ≥ 1)] = 𝜗𝛾𝐵 , 𝑉𝑀 [𝑦𝑗 (𝐿𝑣𝑗 ≥ 1)] = 𝜗𝛾𝐵 (1 − 𝜗𝛾𝐵 ) for 𝑘 ∈ 𝑈𝐶 ∩ 𝑦𝑘,𝑗 𝑙𝑘,𝑗
= 1.
Let us assume that the number of contacts L is roughly constant in 𝑈. Then, the total
number of contacts derived from the two frames (𝑈𝑣 and 𝑈𝐶 ) are:
𝑇𝐿𝑣 = ∑

𝑙𝑘,𝑗 ≅ 𝜇(1 − 𝑃𝑣 )𝑁𝐿.

By considering the reasonable assumptions of a uniform distribution for the contacts of
all the units, we have:

𝑃𝑣 𝑁𝐿
𝜇(1 − 𝑃𝑣 )𝑁𝐿
= 𝐿 and 𝐿𝐶𝑗 ≅

𝑃𝑣 𝑁
(1 − 𝑃𝑣 )𝑁𝐿

Adopting the model in (𝐴1) for the case where we do not know if the unit 𝑘 ∈ 𝑈𝑦𝑙 or the
models in (A4) for 𝑘, 𝑗 ∈ 𝑈𝑦𝑙 , the estimates 𝑌̂𝐴,𝑆𝑅𝑆 and 𝑌̂𝐵,𝑆𝑅𝑆 can be approximated by:

To evaluate the anticipated variances and covariances for the estimates derived from 𝑆𝐵 ,
we have to preliminarily consider these results:
(𝐴10) 𝐸𝑀 (𝑦𝑘 𝑦𝑗 ) = Pr(𝑦𝑘 = 1) 𝐸𝑀 (𝑦𝑗 |𝑦𝑘 = 1) + [1 − Pr(𝑦𝑘 = 0)]0 = 𝜇𝜗 for 𝑘 ∈ 𝑈𝐶 ∩ 𝑗
