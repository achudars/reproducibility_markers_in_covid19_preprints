Abstract
Antibody therapeutics and vaccines are among our last resort to end the raging COVID-19 pandemic.
They, however, are prone to over 5,000 mutations on the spike (S) protein uncovered by a Mutation
Tracker based on over 200,000 genome isolates. It is imperative to understand how mutations would
impact vaccines and antibodies in the development. In this work, we first study the mechanism, frequency,
and ratio of mutations on the S protein that is the common target of most COVID-19 vaccines and
antibody therapies. Additionally, we build a library of 56 antibody structures and analyze their 2D and
3D characteristics. Moreover, we predict the mutation-induced binding free energy (BFE) changes for
the complexes of S protein and antibodies or ACE2. By integrating genetics, biophysics, deep learning,
and algebraic topology, we reveal that most of 462 mutations on the receptor-binding domain (RBD)
will weaken the binding of S protein and antibodies and disrupt the efficacy and reliability of antibody
therapies and vaccines. A list of 31 vaccine escape mutants is identified, while many other disruptive
mutations are detailed as well. We also unveil that about 65% existing RBD mutations, including those
variants recently found in the United Kingdom (UK) and South Africa, will strengthen the binding
between the S protein and human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), resulting in more infectious
COVID-19 variants. We discover the disparity between the extreme values of RBD mutation-induced
BFE strengthening and weakening of the bindings with antibodies and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2
(ACE2), suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 is at an advanced stage of evolution for human infection, while the
human immune system is able to produce optimized antibodies. This discovery, unfortunately, implies the
vulnerability of current vaccines and antibody drugs to new mutations. Our predictions were validated
by comparison with more than 1,400 deep mutations on the S protein RBD. Our results show the urgent
need to develop new mutation-resistant vaccines and antibodies and to prepare for seasonal vaccinations.

Key words: vaccine, antibody, mutation, protein-protein interaction, binding free energy change, algebraic
topology, deep learning.

Introduction

The expeditious spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to 95,932,739 confirmed cases and 2,054,853 fatalities as
of January 20, 2021. In the 21st century, three major outbreaks of deadly pneumonia are caused by βcoronaviruses: SARS-CoV (2002), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (2012), and
SARS-CoV-2 (2019) [1]. Similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 causes respiratory infections,
and the transmission of viruses occurs among family members or in healthcare settings at the early stages of
the outbreak. However, SARS-CoV-2 has an unprecedented scale of infection. Considering the high infection
rate, high prevalence rate, long incubation period [2], asymptomatic transmission [3,4], and potential seasonal
pattern [5] of COVID-19, the development of specific antiviral drugs, antibody therapies, and effective
vaccines is of paramount importance. Traditional drug discovery takes more than ten years, on average,
to bring a new drug to the market [6]. However, developing potent SARS-CoV-2 specified antibodies and
vaccines is a relatively more efficient and less time-consuming strategy to combat COVID-19 for the ongoing
pandemic [7]. Antibody therapies and vaccines depend on the host immune system. Recently studies have
been working on the host-pathogen interaction, host immune responses, and the pathogen immune evasion
strategies [8–13], which provide insight into understanding the mechanism of antibody therapies and vaccine
development.
The immune system is a host defense system that protects the host from pathogenic microbes, eliminates
toxic or allergenic substances, and responds to an invading pathogen [14]. It has innate immune system
and adaptive immune system as two major subsystems. The innate system provides an immediate but
non-specific response, whereas the adaptive immune system provides a highly specific and effective immune
response. Once the pathogen breaches the first physical barriers, such as epithelial cell layers, secreted mucus
layer, mucous membranes, the innate system will be triggered to identify pathogens by pattern recognition
receptors (PRRs), which is expressed on dendritic cells, macrophages, or neutrophils [15]. Specifically, PPRs
identify pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) located on pathogens and then activate complex
signaling pathways that introduce inflammatory responses mediated by various cytokines and chemokines,
which promote the eradication of the pathogen [16, 17]. Notably, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 even
occurs in asymptomatic infected individuals, which may delay the early response of the innate immune
response [8]. Another important line of host defense is the adaptive immune system. B lymphocytes (B
cells) and T lymphocytes (T cells) are special types of leukocytes that are the acknowledged cellular pillars
of the adaptive immune system [18]. Two major subtypes of T cells are involved in the cell-mediated
immune response: killer T cells (CD8+ T cells) and helper T cells (CD4+ cells). The killer T cells eradicate
cells invaded by pathogens with the help of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I. MHC class
I molecules are expressed on the surface of all nucleated cells [19]. The nucleated cells will firstly degrade
foreign proteins via antigen processing when viruses infect them. Then, the peptide fragments will be
presented by MHC Class I, which will activate killer T cells to eliminate these infected cells by releasing
cytotoxins [20]. Similarly, helper T cells cooperate with MHC Class II, a type of MHC molecules that are
constitutively expressed on antigen-presenting cells, such as macrophages, dendritic cells, monocytes, and
B cells [21]. Helper T cells express T cell receptors (TCR) to recognize antigen bound to MHC class II
molecules. However, helper T cells do not have cytotoxic activity. Therefore, they can not kill infected cells
directly. Instead, the activated helper T cells will release cytokines to enhance the microbicidal function
of macrophages and the activity of killer T cells [22]. Notably, an unbalanced response can result in a
“cytokine storm,” which is the main cause of the fatality of COVID-19 patients [23]. Correspondingly, a
B cell involves in humoral immune response and identifies pathogens by binding to foreign antigens with
its B cell receptors (BCRs) located on its surface. The antigens that are recognized by antibodies will be
degraded to peptides in B cells and displayed by MHC class II molecules. As mentioned above, helper
T cells can recognize the signal provided by MHC class II and upregulate the expression of CD40 ligand,
which provides extra stimulation signals to activate antibody-producing B cells [24], rendering millions of

1

copies of antibodies (Ab) that recognize the specific antigen. Additionally, when the antigen first enters the
body, the T cells and B cells will be activated, and some of them will be differentiated to long-lived memory
cells, such as memory T cells and memory B cells. These long-lived memory cells will play a role in quickly
and specifically recognizing and eliminating a specific antigen that encountered the host and initiated a
corresponding immune response in the future [25]. The vaccination mechanism is to stimulate the primary
immune response of the human body, which will activate T cells and B cells to generate the antibodies and
long-lived memory cells that prevent infectious diseases, which is one of the most effective and economical
means for combating with COVID-19 at this stage.
As mentioned above, secreted by B cells of the adaptive immune system, antibodies can recognize and
bind to specific antigens. Conventional antibodies (immunoglobulins) are Y-shaped molecules that have two
light chains and two heavy chains [26]. Each light chain is connected to the heavy chain via a disulfide bond,
and heavy chains are connected through two disulfide bonds in the mid-region known as the hinge region.
Each light and heavy chain contain two distinct regions: constant regions (stem of the Y) and variable regions
(“arms” of the Y) [27]. An antibody binds the antigenic determinant (also called epitope) through the variable
regions in the tips of heavy and light chains. There is an enormous amount of diversity in the variable regions.
Therefore, different antibodies can recognize many different types of antigenic epitopes. To be specific, there
are three complementarity determining regions (CDRs) that are arranged non-consecutively in the tips of each
variable region. CDRs generate most of the diversities between antibodies, which determine the specificity
of individuals of antibodies. In addition to conventional antibodies, camelids also produce heavy-chain-only
antibodies (HCAbs). HCAbs, also referred to as nanobodies, or VHHs, contain a single variable domain
(VHH) that makes up the equivalent antigen-binding fragment (Fab) of conventional immunoglobulin G
(IgG) antibodies [28]. This single variable domain typically can acquire affinity and specificity for antigens
comparable to conventional antibodies. Nanobodies can easily be constructed into multivalent formats
and have higher thermal stability and chemostability than most antibodies do [29]. Another advantage of
nanobodies is that they are less susceptible to steric hindrances than large conventional antibodies [30].
Considering the broad specificity of antibodies, seeking potential antibody therapies has become one
of the most feasible strategies to fight against SARS-CoV-2. In general, antibody therapy is a form of
immunotherapy that uses monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to target pathogenic proteins. The binding of
antibody and pathogenic antigen can facilitate immune response, direct neutralization, radioactive treatment,
the release of toxic agents, and cytokine storm inhibition (aka immune checkpoint therapy). The SARSCoV-2 entry of a human cell facilitated by the process of a series of interactions between its spike (S)
protein and the host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), primed by host transmembrane
protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) [31]. As such, most COVID-19 antibody therapeutic developments focus on
the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antibodies that were initially generated from patient immune response and
T-cell pathway inhibitors that block T-cell responses. A large number of antibody therapeutic drugs are
in clinical trials. Fifty-five S protein antibody structures are available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB),
offering a great resource for mechanistic analysis and biophysical studies.

Figure 1: Illustration of four types of COVID-19 vaccines that are currently in the development.

Currently, most antibody therapy developments focus on the use of antibodies isolated from patient convalescent plasma to directly neutralize SARS-CoV-2 [32–34], although there are efforts to alleviate cytokine
storm. A more effective and economical means to fight against SARS-CoV-2 is the vaccine [35], which is the
most anticipated approach for preventing the COVID-19 pandemic. A vaccine is designed to stimulate effective host immune responses and provide active acquired immunity by exploiting the body’s immune system,
including the production of antibodies, which is made of an antigenic agent that resembles a disease-causing
microorganism, or surface protein, or genetic material that is needed to generate the surface protein. For
SARS-CoV-2, the first choice of surface proteins is the spike protein. There are four types of COVID-19
vaccines, as shown in Figure 1. 1) Virus vaccines use the virus itself in a weakened or inactivated form. 2)
Viral-vector vaccines are designed to genetically engineer a weakened virus, such as measles or adenovirus,
to produce coronavirus S proteins in the body. Both replicating and non-replicating viral-vector vaccines
are being studied now. 3) Nucleic-acid vaccines use DNA or mRNA to produce SASR-CoV-2 S proteins
inside host cells to stimulate the immune response. 4) Protein-based vaccines are designed to directly inject
coronavirus proteins, such as S protein or membrane (M) protein, or their fragments, into the body. Both

3

protein subunits and viral-like particles (VLPs) are under development for COVID-19 [36]. Among these
technologies, nucleic-acid vaccines are safe and relatively easy to develop [36]. However, they have not been
approved for any human usage before.
However, the general population’s safety concerns are the major factors that hinder the rapid approval
of vaccines and antibody therapies. A major potential challenge is an antibody-dependent enhancement, in
which the binding of a virus to suboptimal antibodies enhances its entry into host cells. All vaccine and
antibody therapeutic developments are currently based on the reference viral genome reported on January
5, 2020 [37]. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the coronaviridae family and the Nidovirales order, which has been
shown to have a genetic proofreading mechanism regulated by non-structure protein 14 (NSP14) in synergy
with NSP12, i.e., RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) [38, 39]. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 has a higher
fidelity in its transcription and replication process than other single-stranded RNA viruses, such as the
flu virus and HIV. Even though the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 has been undergoing many mutations, as
reported in [40, 41]. As of January 20, 2021, a total of 5,003 unique mutations on the S protein has
been detected on 203,346 complete SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences. Among them, 462 mutations were on
the receptor-binding domain (RBD), the most popular targets for antibodies and vaccines. Therefore, it
is of paramount importance to establish a reliable paradigm to predict and mitigate the impact of SARSCoV-2 mutations on vaccines and antibody therapies. Moreover, the efficacy of a given COVID-19 vaccine
depends on many factors, including SARS-CoV-2 biological properties associated with the vaccine, mutation
impacts, vaccination schedule (dose and frequency), idiosyncratic response, assorted factors such as ethnicity,
age, gender, or genetic predisposition. The effect of COVID-19 vaccination also depends on the fraction of
the population who accept vaccines. It is essentially unknown at this moment how these factors will unfold
for COVID-19 vaccines.
It is no doubt that any preparation that leads to an improvement in the COVID-19 vaccination effect will
be of tremendous significance to human health and the world economy. Therefore, in this work, we integrate
genetic analysis and computational biophysics, including artificial intelligence (AI), as well as additional
enhancement from advanced mathematics to predict and mitigate mutation threats to COVID-19 vaccines
and antibody therapies. We perform single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calling [41] to identify SARSCoV-2 mutations. For mutations on the S protein, we analyze their mechanism [42], frequency, ratio, and
secondary structural traits. We construct a library of 56 existing antibody structures by January 1, 2021 from
the PDB and analyze their two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) characteristics. We further
predict the mutation-induced binding free energy (BFE) changes of antibody and S protein complexes using
a topology-based network tree (TopNetTree) [43], which is a state-of-the-art model that integrates deep
learning and algebraic topology [44–46]. In this work, TopNetTree is trained with newly available deep
mutation datasets on the S protein, ACE2, and some antibodies and its predictions are validated with
thousands of experimental data points. Our studies indicate that most mutations will significantly disrupt
the binding of essentially all known antibodies to the S protein. Therefore, vaccines and antibody drugs
that were developed based on the early SARS-CoV-2 genome will be seriously compromised by mutations.
Additionally, we show that most known mutations will strengthen the binding between the S protein and
ACE2, which gives rise to more infectious variants. Our studies also reveal that SARS-CoV-2 is at an
advanced stage of evolution with respect to its ability to infect human. Although the human immune system
is able to produce antibodies that are optimized respect to a pathogen, the antibodies, once produced, are
very vulnerable to the attack of mutants.

Mutations on the spike protein

As a fundamental biological process, mutagenesis changes the organism’s genetic information and servers as a
primary source for many kinds of cancer and heritable diseases, which is a driving force for evolution [47,48].
Generally speaking, virus mutations are introduced by natural selection, replication mechanism, cellular en4

vironment, polymerase fidelity, gene editing, random genetic drift, gene editing, recent epidemiology features,
host immune responses, etc [49, 50]. Notably, understanding how mutations have changed the SARS-CoV-2
structure, function, infectivity, activity, and virulence is of great importance for coming up with life-saving
strategies in virus control, containment, prevention, and medication, especially in the antibodies and vaccines
development. Genome sequencing, SNP calling, and phenotyping provide an efficient means to parse mutations from a large number of viral samples [40](see the Supporting material (S1)). In this work, we retrieved
more than 200,000 complete SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from the GISAID database [51] and created a
real-time interactive SARS-CoV-2 Mutation Tracker to report more than 26,000 unique single mutations
along with its mutation frequency on SARS-CoV-2 as of January 20, 2021. Figure 2 is a screenshot of
our online Mutation Tracker. It describes the distribution of mutations on the complete coding region of
SARS-CoV-2. The y-axis shows the natural log frequency for each mutation at a specific position. A reader
can download the detailed mutation SNP information from our Mutation Tracker website.

Figure 2: The distribution of genome-wide SARS-CoV-2 mutations on 26 proteins. The y-axis represents the natural log
frequency for each mutation on a specific position of the complete SARS-CoV-2 genome. While only a few landmark positions
are labeled with gene (protein) names, the relative positions of other genes(proteins) can be found in our Mutation Tracker
MutationTracker( https://users.math.msu.edu/users/weig/SARS-CoV-2 Mutation Tracker.html)

As mentioned before, the S protein has become the first choice for antibody and vaccine development.
Among 203,346 complete genome sequences, 5,003 unique single mutations are detected on the S protein.
The number of unique mutations (NU ) is determined by counting the same type of mutations in different
genome isolates only once, whereas the number of non-unique mutations (NNU , i.e., frequency) is calculated
by counting the same type of mutations in different genome isolates repeatedly. Table 1 lists the distribution
of 12 SNP types among unique and non-unique mutations on the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide. It
can be seen that C>T and A>G are the two dominated SNP types, which may be due to the innate host
immune response via APOBEC and ADAR gene editing [42].
Moreover, 144 non-degenerated mutations occurred on the S protein RBD, which are relevant to the
binding of SARS-CoV-2 S protein and most antibodies as well as ACE2. Additionally, 218 mutations that
occurred on the S protein NTD (residue id: 14 to 226) are relevant to the binding of another two antibodies
(4A8, FC05) and SARS-CoV-2 S protein.
Furthermore, since antibody CDRs are random coils, the complementary antigen-binding domains must
involve random coils as well. Table 2 lists the statistics of non-degenerate mutations on the secondary
structures of SARS-CoV-2 S protein. Here, the secondary structures are mostly extracted from the crystal
structure of 7C2L [52], and the missing residues are predicted by RaptorX-Property [53]. We can see that
for both unique and non-unique cases, the average mutation rates on the random coils of the S protein have

frequency of 192284. If we do not consider the 23403A>G-(D614G) mutations, then the unique and nonunique average rates on the random coils of S protein still have the highest values (2.81 and 212.01),
indicating that mutations are more likely to occur on the random coils. Consequently, the natural selection
of mutations may tend to disrupt antibodies.

SARS-CoV-2 antibodies

In this work, we consider 56 3D structures available from the PDB ( https://www.rcsb.org) before January
1, 2021. These 56 structures include 51 structures of antibodies binding to S protein RBD, 4 structures of
antibodies having binding domains outside the S protein RBD, and an ACE2-S protein complex. Among
four structures having binding domains outside the RBD, there are three distinct antibodies not binding to
the RBD, namely 4A8 [52], FC05 [54], and 2G12 [55]. This is because that FC05 has two sets of structures
(PBD IDs 7CWU and 7CWS) that differ from each other by their components on the RBD (i.e., H014 and
P17). Some antibodies are given as combinations of other unique ones. Among 51 antibodies on the RBD,
there are only 42 unique ones, including MR17-K99Y as a mutant of MR17 [56].

3D antibody structure alignment on the S protein

We present the 3D alignment of 45 structures of SARS-CoV-2 S protein with ACE2 and antibodies (excluding
the mutant MR17-K99Y of MR17) in Figure 3. ACE2 in Figure 3 (a) is a reference. Figures 3 (a)-(j) list 42
single antibodies binding to the RBD, and Figure 3 (k) includes the other 3 alignments of 4A8, FC05, and
2G12 whose binding domains are outside the RBD. Figure 3 (m) presents a 3D structure of a single chain
of S protein. The PDB IDs of these complexes can be found in Figure 4.
Figure 3 reveals, except for Fab 52 [62], S309 [57], CR3022 [63], EY6A [67], 4A8 [52], FC05 [54], and
2G12 [55], all the other 38 antibodies have their binding sites spatially clashing with that of ACE2. Notably,
the paratope of H014 [69] and S304 [60] do not overlap with that of ACE2 directly, but in terms of 3D

structures, their binding sites still overlap. This suggests that the bindings of 39 antibodies are in direct
competition with that of ACE2. Theoretically, this direct competition reduces the viral infection rate. For
such an antibody with strong binding ability, it will directly neutralize SARS-CoV-2 without the need for
antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC), antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP), or other
immune mechanisms.
The paratopes of S309, Fab 52, CR3022, and EY6A on the RBD are away from that of ACE2, leading
to the absence of binding competition [66, 67, 80]. One study shows that the ADCC and ADCP mechanisms
contribute to the viral control conducted by S309 in infected individuals [66]. For Fab 52, it was suggested
that its mechanism could involve S protein destabilization [62]. For CR3022, one research indicates that it
neutralizes the virus in a synergistic fashion [81]. For EY6A, the hypothesis is that glycosylation of ACE2
accounts for at least part of the observed crosstalk between ACE2 and EY6A. [67]. More radical examples
are 4A8, FC05, and 2G12. 4A8 binds to NTD of the S protein (Figure 3(h)), which is quite far from the
RBD. It is speculated that 4A8 may neutralize SARS-CoV-2 by restraining the conformational changes of
the S protein, which is very important for the SARS-CoV-2 cell entry [52]. FC05 is combined with P17
or H014 to form a cocktail [54]. 2G12 binds to the S protein S2 domain [55]. Any antibody or drug that
can inhibit serine protease TMPRSS2 priming of the S protein priming can effectively stop the viral cell
entry [31].

2D residue contacts between antibodies and the S protein RBD

Figure 3 provides a visual illustration of antibody and ACE2 competitions. It remains to know in the
residue detail what has happened to these competitions. To better understand the antibody and S protein
interactions, we study the residue contacts between antibodies and the S protein. We include the ACE2 as a
reference but excluding antibodies MR17-K99Y as well as 4A8, FC05, and 2G12 that bind to other domains.
In Figure 4, the paratopes of 42 individual antibodies (excluding MR17-K99Y) and ACE2 were aligned
on the S protein RBD 2D sequence, and their contact regions are highlighted. From the figure, one can
see that, except for Fab 52, S309, CR3022, EY6A, H014, and S304, all the other 36 antibodies have
their antigenic epitopes overlapping with the ACE2, especially on the residues from 486 to 505 of the RBD.
Although, the paratope of H014 and S304 do not overlap with that of ACE2 directly, their binding sites still
overlap in 3D structures. Therefore, these 38 antibodies competitively bind against ACE2 as revealed in
Figure 3.

3.3

Antibody sequence alignment and similarity analysis

The next question is whether there is any connection or similarity between the antibody paratopes in our
library, particularly for those antibodies that share the same binding sites. To better understand this
perspective, we carry out multiple sequence alignment (MSA) to further study the similarity and difference
among existing antibodies. Many antibodies are very similar to each other and can be classified into several
clusters by CD-HIT suite [82]. The first and largest cluster includes COVA2-04, CC12.1, BD-236, BD-604,
B38, EY6A, S304, P2C-1A3, A fab, C1A, STE90-C11, and CB6. Their identity scores to CB6 are 90.48 %,
94.74 %, 93.59 %, 93.35 %, 94.77 %, 92.52 %, 90.62 %, 90.51 %, 91.18 %, 94.08 %, and 93.00 %, respectively.
The second cluster contains BD-629, CC12.3, P2C-1F11, and CV30. Their identity scores to CV30 are 95.41
%, 96.32 %, and 97.68 %, respectively. The third cluster has CV07-270 and COVA2-39, the pairwise identity
score is 90.18 %. The fourth cluster is composed of H11-H4, H11-D4, and Nb, and their identity scores
to Nb are 99.25 % and 95.52 %, respectively. They are all nanobodies. The fifth cluster has Fab 298 and
COVA1-16, the pairwise identity score is 90.80 %. Their alignment plots are in the Supporting material
(Figures S1-S5).
The above similarity indicates that the adaptive immune systems of individuals have a common way to

sequences. The corresponding PDB IDs are given in parentheses.

generate antibodies. On the other hand, the existence of five distinct clusters, as well as antibodies 4A8,
FC05, and 2G12 suggests the diversity in the immune response. Note that we have also included ACE2 in
our MSA as a reference, but none of the existing antibodies is similar to ACE2 because they were created
from entirely different mechanisms.

Mutation impacts on SARS-CoV-2 antibodies

To investigate the influences of existing S protein mutations on the binding free energy (BFE) of S protein
and antibodies, we consider 462 mutations that occurred on the S protein RBD, which are relevant to the
binding of SARS-CoV-2 S protein and antibodies as well as ACE2. Additionally, 540 mutations occurred on
9

the NTD of the S protein (residue id: 14 to 226) which are relevant to the binding of SARS-COV-2 S protein
and antibody 4A8 (PDB: 7C2L). We predict the free energy changes following existing mutations using our
TopNetTree model [43]. The mutations on the RBD are considered for the predictions of BFE changes. Our
predictions are built from the X-ray crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 S protein and ACE2 (PDB 6M0J) [57],
and various antibodies (PDBs 6WPS [66], 6XC2 [58], 6XC3 [58], 6XC4 [58], 6XC7 [58], 6XE1 [64], 6XEY [83],
6XKP [72], 6XKQ [72], 6YLA [63], 6YZ5, 6Z2M, 6ZBP, 6ZCZ [67], 6ZER [67], 7A29 [78], 7B3O, 7BWJ [71],
7BYR [65], 7BZ5 [59], 7C01 [61], 7C2L [52], 7C8V [56], 7C8W [56], 7CAH [69], 7CAH [69], 7CAN [56], 7CDI,

7K43 [73], 7K45 [73], 7K9Z [62], 7KFV [76], 7KFW [76], 7KFX [76], and 7KFY [76]). The BFE change
following mutation (∆∆G) is defined as the subtraction of the BFE of the mutant type from the BFE of the
wild type, ∆∆G = ∆GW − ∆GM where ∆GW is the BFE of the wild type and ∆GM is the BFE of mutant.
Therefore, a negative BFE change means that the mutation decreases affinities, making the protein-protein
interaction less stable.
Four antibody-S protein complexes are examined in in this section. Next, we present a library of mutationinduced BFE changes for all mutations and 51 antibodies, as well as ACE2. The statistical analysis of
mutation impacts on antibodies is discussed.

Figure 5: Illustration of SARS-CoV-2 mutation-induced binding free energy changes for the complexes of S protein and 4A8
(PDB: 7C2L). The blue color in the structure plot indicates a positive BFE change while the red color indicate a negative
BFE change, and toning indicate the strength. Here, mutations R102I, W152C, W152L, S247N, and Y248H could potentially
disrupt the binding of antibody 4A8 and S protein.

For four antibody-S protein complexes, since there are too many mutations, we only consider those
mutations whose frequencies are greater than 10. We first present the BFE changes (∆∆G) of SARS-CoV-2
S protein binding domain with antibody 4A8 in Figure 5, which is one of the three complexes that are not on
the RBD in our collections of S protein and antibody complexes. A total 141 of 540 mutations on residues
ID from 14 to 226 have frequencies larger than 10. Most mutations have small BFE changes (from −0.5
kcal/mol to 0.5 kcal/mol) in their binding free energies, while 28 mutations have negative BFE changes less
than −0.5 kcal/mol. Notably, 53 out of 141 mutations on the binding domain have positive BFE changes,
which means that the mutations increase affinities and would make the S protein-4A8 interactions more
stable. However, the majority (63%) of mutations have negative BFE changes, including high-frequency
mutations, R102I, and W152C with frequencies of 89 and 356, respectively. Since the largest positive and
negative BFE changes are 0.37 and -2.06 (-3.1 if low frequency mutations are counted) kcal/mol, respectively,
the prediction indicates that antibody 4A8 isolated from 10 convalescent patients at the early stage of the
pandemic [52] is an optimized product of the human immune system with respect to the original S protein.
It is also noted that many mutations on the binding domain, such as W152L, S247N, and Y248H, have
significant negative free energy changes. The mutations on the binding domain with large negative BFE
changes reveal that the binding of antibody 4A8 and S protein will be potentially disrupted.

Figure 6: Illustration of SARS-CoV-2 mutation-induced binding free energy changes for the complexes of S protein and Fab
2-4 (PDB: 6XEY). The blue color in the structure plot indicates a positive BFE change while the red color indicate a negative
BFE change, and toning indicate the strength. Here, mutations E484K, E484Q, F486L, and F490S could potentially disrupt
the binding of antibody Fab 2-4 and the S protein.

Next, we study the BFE changes (∆∆G) induced by 80 mutations on the SARS-CoV-2 S protein RBD
for the antibody Fab 2-4 (PDB: 6XEY) in Figure 6. Antibody Fab 2-4 shares a similar binding domain
with ACE2 and thus is a potential candidate for the direct neutralization of SARS-CoV-2. Most mutations
induce small changes in the binding free energies, while mutations, E484K, E484Q, F486L, and F490S, have
large negative BFE changes. Overall, 38 out of 80 mutations on the RBD lead to negative BFE changes,
which means 48% of mutations will potentially weaken the binding between antibody Fab 2-4 and S protein.
For positive BFE changes, the largest value is only 0.55 kcal/mol and the average of positive BFE changes
is 0.16 kcal/mol.
However, many mutations with negative BFE changes have a very large magnitude,
indicating that antibody Fab 2-4 was an immune product optimized with respect to the original un-mutated
S protein. In general, the mutations on S protein weaken the Fab 2-4 binding with S protein and make it
less competitive with ACE2 as most mutations strengthen the S protein and ACE2 binding. It is interesting
to note that mutation E484K is the so-called South Africa variant. It indeed has a strong vaccine-escape
effect.

Figure 7: Illustration of SARS-CoV-2 mutation-induced binding free energy changes for the complexes of S protein and MR17
(PDB: 7C8W). Blue in the structure plot indicates a positive BFE change while red indicate a negative BFE change, and
toning indicate the strength. Here, mutations L452R, E484K, F486L, F490S, and S494L could potentially disrupt the binding
of antibody MR17 and the S protein.

In Figure 7, we illustrate the mutation-induced BFE changes for antibody MR17 (PDB: 7C8W), which
shares the binding domain with ACE2 as well. One can notice that four mutations, L452R, E484K, F486L,
F490S, and S494L, have BFE changes less than −1 kcal/mol as well as high frequencies. The rest mutations
have a small magnitude of changes. Twenty seven out of 80 mutations have positive BFE changes with
the largest value less than 0.25 kcal/mol. Our results indicate that antibody MR37 is likely to be isolated
from patients at the early stage and thus, it was optimized based on an early version of SARS-CoV-2 virus.
Mutations L452R, E484K, F486L, F490S, and S494L will reduce its competitiveness with ACE2.
Finally, we consider the BFE change predictions for antibody S309 and S protein complex, whose receptor

Figure 8: Illustration of SARS-CoV-2 mutation-induced binding free energy changes for the complexes of S protein and S309
(PDB: 6WPS). The blue color in the structure plot indicates a positive BFE change while the red color indicate a negative BFE
change, and toning indicate the strength. Here, mutations E340A, N354D, and K356R could potentially weaken the binding of
antibody S309 and the S protein.

binding motif (RBM) does not overlap with the RBM of ACE2 (see Fig. 3(e)). The BFE changes induced by
80 mutations are predicted. Among them, 38 changes are positive. Similar to the aforementioned antibodies,
most of the mutations lead to small changes in their binding affinity magnitude but three mutations, E340A,
N354D, and K356R, induce moderate negative changes. Interestingly, all the 80 RBD mutations do not
have a major impact on S309. Although mutation R403K might disrupt S309, it does weaken many other
antibody bindings with the S protein. While antibodies play a variety of functions in the human immune
system, such as neutralization of infection, phagocytosis, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, etc., their
binding with antigens is crucial for these functions. Our analysis of BFE changes following mutations on the
S protein suggests that some antibodies will be less affected by mutations, which is important for developing
vaccine and antibody therapies.

4.2

Mutation impact library

In this section, we build a library of mutation-induced BFE changes for all mutations and all antibodies as
well as ACE2. In principle, we could create a library of all possible mutations for all antibodies, as we did
for ACE2 [84]. Here, we limit our effort to all existing mutations. Antibody 4A8 on the NTD has been
discussed above. We consider antibodies on the RBD.
Based on our earlier analysis, three types of SARS-CoV-2 S protein secondary structural residues have
different mutation rates. Among them, the random coils are major components of the RDB and the NTD,
as shown in Fig. 3. Most RBD mutations (287 of 462) occur on the residues whose secondary structures are
coil, while 93 out of 462 mutations are on the helix, and 82 out of 462 mutations are on the sheet. Therefore,
mutations on the RBD are split into three categories based on their locations in secondary structures helix,
sheet, and coil. In Figure 9, we present the BFE changes for the complexes of the S protein and antibodies
or ACE2 induced by mutations on the helix residues of the S protein RBD. The frequency for each mutation
is also presented. Most mutations on helix residues lead to negative BFE changes (pink squares), which
weaken the bindings, whereas some mutations induce positive BFE changes (green squares). It is noted that
most mutations lead to the strengthening of the S protein and ACE2 binding, which is consistent with the
natural selection rule. Mutations N406G, I418N, N422K, D442H, Y505S, and Y505C give rise to a strong
weakening effect on most antibodies. The N439K mutation having the highest frequency, shows a positive
BFE change on ACE2 but negative changes on most antibodies. Mutation D405Y appears to strengthen
most antibodies.
In Figure 10, we present the BFE changes for the S protein and antibody (ACE2) complexes following
sheet residue mutations of the S protein RBD. Like the last case, most mutations lead to positive BFE changes
for ACE2, indicating infectivity strengthening. There are many disruptive mutations, such as R355W, F401I,
F401C, I402F, C432G, I434K, A435P, O493P, V510E, V512G, and L513P, that will weaken most antibodies

and S protein complexes. On the other hand, most mutations strengthen certain antibodies but weaken other
ones, which allows the effectiveness of antibody cocktails for a better protection. The binding of antibody
H014 and the S protein is strengthened by many mutations, particularly S375F, K378O, R403K, and Y453F.
Among them, Y453F is an infectivity-strengthening mutation with a relatively high frequency.
Figures 11, 12, and 13 present the BFE changes for the S protein and antibody (ACE2) complexes
following coil residue mutations of the S protein RBD. Overall, most mutations on coil residues lead to mild
negative BFE changes. However, mutations V350F, W353R, I401N, G416V, G431V, Y449D, Y449S, C480R,
P491R, P491L, Y495C, and O506P will weaken most antibody bindings to the S protein. Some residues, like
A348, N460, and P521, can produce many binding-strengthening mutations for most antibodies and ACE2.
For the high-frequency mutation S447N in Figure 13, the BFE changes are mild on ACE2 and antibodies.
Additionally, the N501Y mutation, one of the typical mutations in the UK B.1.1.7 variants, strengthens the
infectivity but induces a mixed reactions to antibodies as shown in Figure 13 .

Statistical analysis of mutation impacts on COVID-19 antibodies

First, we perform a statistical analysis of all mutation-induced BFE changes studied in the last section.
Most mutations induce binding-weakening BFE changes. The total rate of negative BFE changes is 71%
(i.e., 16661 out of 23512), for coil residues, 67% BFE changes are negative, while for helix or sheet residues,
72% and 80% BFE changes are negative, respective. However, for ACE2, 300 out of 462 mutations (i.e.,
65%) on the REB produce positive or binding-strengthening BFE changes, showing the effect of the natural
selection of mutations. In contrast, at most 200 of 462 mutations on the RBD give rise to negative BFE
changes for antibodies. More specifically, 11 antibodies have less than 100 positive BFE changes while 41
antibodies have less than 200 positive BFE changes. Interestingly, in our prediction, 4 out of the 43 single
antibodies have less than 100 positive BFE changes, while 7 out of the 9 antibody cocktails have less than
100 positive BFE changes. Although antibody cocktails have mild negative BFE changes, it turns out that

they have high affinities to S protein and the BFE changes are mild for positive ones as well.
Figure 14 indicates the BFE changes extreme values (maximal in cyan and minimal in pink) and average
values (positive in blue and negative in red) of the complexes of S protein ACE2 or antibodies following
mutations.
The maximal BFE changes of the helix, sheet, and coil residues are 1.44 kcal/mol, 1.94
kcal/mol, and 1.00 kcal/mol, respectively, while the minimal BFE changes are -3.87 kcal/mol, -3.9 kcal/mol,
and -4.38 kcal/mol, respectively. The disparity in their maximal and minimal values indicates that relatively
optimal nature of the S protein and antibody binding complexes. It means that the human immune system
has the ability to produce optimized antibodies for a given antigen. However, antibodies, once generated,
are prone to the infection of new mutants. The disparity shown in Figure 14 also means that the SARSCoV-2 was at an advanced stage of evolution with respect to human infection. There is not much room for
SARS-CoV-2 to improve its infectivity by single-site mutations.
Many antibody cocktails, such as CR3022/H11-D4, CC12.1/CR3022, BD-236/BD368-2, BD604/BD3682, S309/S2H14/S304, and Fabs 298/52, are relatively less sensitive to the current S protein mutations.
However, some other antibodies, such as H11-D4, CV30, CC12.3, and S2H13, can be dramatically affected
by SARS-CoV-2 mutations. Importantly, ACE2 is also impacted by mutations and has the largest positive
BFE change on average.

Mutation impacts on COVID-19 vaccines

The increasing number of infection cases and deaths, the global spread situation, and the lack of prophylactics
and therapeutics give rise to the urgent demand for the prevention of COVID-19. Vaccination is the most
effective and economical means to control pandemics [35]. Currently, 248 vaccines are in various clinical

trial stages, as reported in an online COVID-19 Treatment And Vaccine Tracker ( https://covid-19track
er.milkeninstitute.org/#vaccines intro). Broadly speaking, there are four types of coronavirus vaccines in
progress: virus vaccines, viral-vector vaccines, nucleic-acid vaccines, and protein-based vaccines, as shown
in Figure 1. The first type of vaccine is the virus vaccine, which injects weakened or inactivate viruses into
the human body. A virus is conventionally weakened by altering its genetic code to reduce its virulence
and elicit a stronger immune response. A biotechnology company Codagenix is currently working on a
“codon optimization” technology to weaken viruses, and it has weakened virus vaccine is in progress [85].
Unlike a weakened virus, the inactivated virus cannot replicate in the host cell. A virus is inactivated
by heating or using chemicals, which induces neutralizing antibody titers and has been proven to have its
safety [86]. At this stage, both Sinopharm, which works with the Beijing Institute of Biological Products and
Wuhan Institute of Biological Products, and Sinovac, which works with Institute Butantan and Bio Farma
is developing inactive SARS-CoV-2 vaccines that are in Phase III clinical trials.
The second type of vaccine is the viral-vector vaccine, which is genetically engineered so that it can
produce coronavirus surface proteins in the human body without causing diseases. There are two subtypes
of viral-vector vaccines: the non-replicating viral vector and the replicating viral vector.
On February
25, 2021, the World Health Organization (WHO) granted an emergency use listing (EUL) for the vaccine
developed by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford, which is a non-replicating viral vector vaccine.
Moreover, there are 3 non-replicating viral vector vaccines in Phase III trials as well. It works by taking a
chimpanzee virus and coating it with the S proteins of SARS-CoV-2. The chimp virus causes a harmless
infection in humans, but the spike proteins will activate the immune system to recognize signs of a future
SARS-CoV-2 invasion. Notably, booster shots can be needed to keep long-lasting immunity. Furthermore,
at this stage, only one replicating viral-vector vaccine is in Phase II. The University of Hong Kong, in
cooperating with the Xiamen University and Wantai Biological Pharmacy, is developing such a replicating
viral vaccine, which tends to be safe and provoke a strong immune response.
The third type of vaccines is nucleic acid vaccines, including two subtypes: DNA-based vaccines and

RNA-based vaccines. At least 40 teams are currently working on nucleic-acid vaccines since they are safe
and easy to develop. The DNA-based vaccine works by inserting genetically engineered blueprints of the
viral gene into small DNA molecules such as plasmids for injection. Moreover, the electroporation technique
is employed to create pores in membranes to increase DNA uptake into cells. The injected DNA will produce
mRNA by transcription with the help of the nucleus in human cells. Such an mRNA will translate viral
proteins (mostly spike proteins), which are dutifully produced by cells in response to the genes, alarm
the immune system, and should produce immunity. Currently, there is one DNA-based vaccine in Phase
III. Similar to DNA-based vaccine, the RNA-based vaccine provides immunity through the introduction of
RNA, which is encased in a lipid coat to ensure its entering into cells. Two RNA-based vaccines are granted
authorization for emergency use in many countries. One is designed by Biontec, which cooperates with
Pfizer, and the other one is from the Moderna.
The fourth type of vaccine is the protein-based vaccine, which aims to inject viral proteins directly to
human bodies into trigger immune readiness. Protein subunits vaccine is one of the subtypes of the proteinbased vaccine. More than 80 teams are working on vaccines with viral protein subunits, such as spike
proteins and membrane (M) proteins. Another subtype of the protein-based vaccine is the virus-like particle
(VLP) vaccine. The VLP vaccines closely resemble viruses. However, they are not infectious since they do
not contain viral genetic material. The non-replicating propriety provides a safer alternative to weakened
virus vaccines, the HPV vaccine or newer flu vaccines are VLP vaccines. Currently, 22 teams are working
on the VLP vaccines for the future prevention of COVID-19.

Since the structural basis of antibody CDRs, or paratope, is random coils, we hypothesize that CDRs favor
antigenic random coils as complementary epitopes, i.e., antigenic determinants [87, 88]. Figure 15 depicts
the 3D structure of S protein, where the random coils are drawn with green strings, and the other secondary
structure is described with the purple surface. It shows that the RBD and the NTD mostly consist of
random coils. The RBD is the antigenic determinant of 43 structurally-known SARS-CoV-2 antibodies;
meanwhile, the NTD is the binding domain of antibodies 4A8 and FC05 and antibody 2G12 also binds
to the S2 domain with random coils, which confirms our hypothesis. More detailed analysis considered the
random coil percentages of antibodies’ paratope and are summarized in Table S1 of the Supporting material.
It reveals antibodies predominantly contact residues in random coils of S protein. In the most case, the
percentages are over 90 %.

Figure 16 marks the secondary structure of the S protein. The red, blue, and green colors represent helix,
sheet, and random coils of S protein. It can be seen that the S protein mostly consists of random coils, which
means there are many other potential antigenic epitopes on the S protein for antibody CDRs. We believe
that the emphasis on direct binding competition with ACE2 in the past [66, 67, 80] has led to the neglecting
of many important antibodies that do not bind to the RBD. Therefore, we suggest that researchers pay more
attention to antibodies that do not bind to the RBD.

Statistical estimation of mutation impacts on COVID-19 vaccines

Vaccine efficacy is an essential issue for the control of the COVID-19 pandemic. The S protein is one of the
most popular surface proteins for vaccine development. However, mutations accumulated on the S protein of
SARS-CoV-2, which may reduce the vaccine efficacy. As we found in section 2, mutations are more likely to
happen on the random coils of S protein, which may have a devastating effect on vaccines in the development.
As shown in Figure 14, mutations could considerably weaken the binding between the S protein and
antibodies and thus pose a direct threat to reduce the efficacy of vaccines. However, there are a few
obstacles in determining the exact impacts of mutations on COVID-19 vaccines. Firstly, the four types
of vaccine platforms can produce very different virus peptides, resulting in different immune responses, as
well as antibodies. Secondly, even for a given vaccine platform, the different peptides may be produced due
to different immune responses caused by gender difference, age difference, race difference, etc. Therefore,
in this work, we proposed to understand the impact of SARS-CoV-2 mutations on COVID-19 vaccines by
the statistical analysis. By evaluating the binding affinity changes induced by 51 existing SARS-CoV-2
antibodies, as shown in Figure 9 to Figure 13, we can identify vaccine escape mutants. Table 3 list a
collection of the most disruptive mutations. However, this list is not complete. There are many other
vaccine escape mutations as shown in Figure 9 to Figure 13. For example, the infectivity-strengthening
South Africa mutant E484K can cause dramatically disruptive effects on many antibodies such as H11-D4,
Fab 2-4, H11-H4, COVA2-39, BD368-2, etc. but it also enhances the binding of other antibodies, such as
B38, CV30, CC21.1, Sb23, Fabs 298 52, etc. The infectivity-strengthening mutation N501Y in UK B.1.1.7
variants has a disruptive effect only on a few known antibodies, including B38, CC12.3, S2M11, NAB, S309
S2H12 S304, C1A-B12, STE90-C11, etc.

P491L, Y495C, Q506P

In a nutshell, by setting up a SARS-CoV-2 antibody library with the statistical analysis based on the
mutation-induced binding free energies changes, we can estimate the impacts of SARS-CoV-2 mutations on
COVID-19 vaccines, which will provide a way to infer how a specific mutation will pose a threat to vaccines.
This approach works better when more antibody structures become available.
Another important factor in prioritization is mutation frequency. Figures 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13 have
provided frequency information from our SNP calling. Once a mutation is identified as a potential threat, it
can be incorporated into the next generation of vaccines in a cocktail approach. In principle, all four types
of vaccine platforms allow the accommodation of new viral strains.

Although the details of the methods used in this work are presented in the Supporting material, we provide
a validation of our deep learning prediction model, TopNetTree [43], which is crucial to the credibility of
this work. Specifically, we demonstrate the prediction performance of S protein mutation induced BEF
changes on CTC-445.2 compared to the experimental deep mutations enrichment data [89]. More detailed
descriptions of methods and datasets are illustrated in the Supporting material.

Figure 17: A comparison between experimental deep mutation enrichment data and TopNetTree predictions for SARS-CoV-2
S protein RBD and CTC-445.2 complex (7KL9 [89]). Top left: deep mutational scanning heatmap showing the average effect
on the enrichment for single site mutants of the RBD when assayed by yeast display for binding to CTC-445.2 [89]. Top right:
the RBD colored by average enrichment at each residue position bound to CTC-445.2. Bottom: machine learning predicted
BFE changes for CTC-445.2 and S protein complex induced by single site mutations on the RBD.

Figure 17 presents a comparison between experimental deep mutation enrichment data on the RBD and
machine learning predicted RBD-mutation-induced BFE changes for the SARS-CoV-2 S protein and CTC445.2 complex. In the heatmaps of Figure 17, one can see that the predicted BFE changes have a very high
correlation to the experimental enrichment ratio data. Both enrichment ratios and BFE changes describe
the affinity strength of the protein-protein interaction induced by mutations. The high similarity between
these heatmaps demonstrates the reliability of our machine learning predictions of BFE changes following
mutations on the S protein RBD.

Conclusion

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has gone out of control globally. There is no specific
medicine and effective treatment for this viral infection at this point. Vaccination is widely anticipated to be
the endgame for taming the viral rampant. Another promising treatment that is relatively easy to develop is
antibody therapies. However, both vaccines and antibody therapies are prone to more than 26,000 unique
mutations recorded in the Mutation Tracker.
We present the most comprehensive analysis and prediction of mutation threats to vaccines and antibody therapies. First, we identify existing mutations on the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike (S) protein, which is the main target for both vaccines and antibody therapies. We
analyze the mechanism, frequency, and ratio of mutations along with the secondary structures of the S
protein. Additionally, we build a library of 55 antibodies with structures available from the Protein Data
20

Bank (PDB) and analyze their two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) characteristics by employing computational biophysics. We further predict the mutation-induced binding free energy (BFE) changes
of S protein and antibody complexes by a model called TopNetTree based on deep learning and algebraic
topology. The performance of our model has been extensively validated by its prediction of experimental
deep mutation data. Our significant findings are the following. First, we reveal that none of the known
mutations is safe to all antibodies. On average, most mutations (i.e., 71%) will weaken the binding between
the S protein and antibodies, which implies that vaccines will also be compromised by existing mutations.
Additionally, we identify 31 vaccine escape mutants that dramatically weaken the binding between the S
protein and most known antibodies. Moreover, we find that most RBD mutations (i.e., 64.9%) will enhance
the binding strength between the S protein and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which implies
most existing mutations will strengthen the SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. This result is consistent with the natural selection of mutations and our earlier finding. [84] Finally, we discover that the maximal BFE change
magnitudes of binding-strengthening mutations are much smaller than those of binding-weakening mutations for all antibodies, which shows current human antibodies were optimized with respect to the original S
protein and are prone to the S protein mutations. Our findings indicate the pressing need to keep developing
mutation-resistant vaccines and antibody drugs and to be ready for seasonal vaccinations.
