Abstract. Due to the outbreak of COVID-19, users are increasingly
turning to online services. An increase in social media usage has also
been observed, leading to the suspicion that this has also raised cyberbullying. In this initial work, we explore the possibility of an increase in
cyberbullying incidents due to the pandemic and high social media usage.
To evaluate this trend, we collected 454, 046 cyberbullying-related public tweets posted between January 1st , 2020 – June 7th , 2020. We summarize the tweets containing multiple keywords into their daily counts.
Our analysis showed the existence of at most one statistically significant
changepoint for most of these keywords, which were primarily located
around the end of March. Almost all these changepoint time-locations
can be attributed to COVID-19, which substantiates our initial hypothesis of an increase in cyberbullying through analysis of discussions over
Twitter.

Introduction

Cyberbullying has become more prevalent, as targeted victimization has moved
from in-person to digital platforms, reaching users regardless of geographic constraints [52,44]. Victims of cyberbullying can be targeted through various sources,
including mobile phones, video cameras, emails, and web pages [53]. Targets of
cyberbullying– particularly adolescents– are more likely to show signs of depression, anxiety, and, in some cases, suicidal behavior [28,42,51]. Online harassment
can carry into adulthood, with bullied victims being more likely to show mental health problems later on [3,9]. Such online harassment can negatively impact
mental health, with 32% of victims reporting symptoms of stress and 38% of victims experiencing emotional distress, even after the online abuse stopped [1,54].
Thus, it is critical to detail cyberbullying and understands the victims’ perspectives.
Social media privacy and security have been a concern for many researchers
and industry practitioners [15,17,11]. Researchers have often noted that users
experience several privacy-focused issues in these social media platforms, which
can also lead them to leave such platforms [35]. Privacy policy and recommended
changes to the same addressed some of the users’ concerns [12,16], but prior

2

Das et al.

studies have shown that social media usage has increased the extent of cyberbullying [54]. On social networking sites and applications, cyberbullying is particularly common, with 66% of all incidents on these platforms [6]. Platforms
such as Twitter allow people to sometimes interact with strangers (including
celebrities) [13]; however, this also leads others to imitate and forge identities
online and trick users [47].
Furthermore, with the current COVID-19 pandemic, people have increased
their social media usage to seek information and stay connected with others
while social distancing [49]. Social media can be used to support others during crises [38]. However, there have also been reports of incivility through such
platforms [27]. A sudden rise in social media usage– combined with children
and adolescents regularly using such platforms– could create a spike in cyberbullying [41]. Thus, we specifically wanted to see whether that is the case and
answer the following research question: How do crises, such as a global pandemic
(COVID-19), impact cyberbullying trends over social media?
To understand users’ perspectives and the impact of COVID-19 on cyberbullying, we collected 454, 046 of publicly available tweets about cyberbullying
to understand user experiences online. As hypothesized, we noticed an increase
in cyberbullying incidents and discussions about it during the pandemic. After
discussing the impact of cyberbullying and some related works in section 2, we
provide a detailed methodology, analysis, and findings in section 3. We briefly
discuss the data collection, pre-processing the data in meaningful categories, and
give an overview of the change-point analysis.

Related Work

Cyberbullying is a major concern for digital communication that can lead to
critical consequences. Cyberbullying has increased, given the advent of social
media and billions of users being online everyday [44]. Additionally, because
times of crisis can increase users’ online presence and, as a result, cyberbullying,
it is important to consider human factors to protect users during such situations–
especially with the current pandemic situation [14].
2.1

Cyberbullying

Mason defined cyberbullying as “. An individual or a group willfully using information and communication involving electronic technologies to facilitate deliberate and repeated harassment or threat to another individual or group by
sending or posting cruel text and/or graphics using technological means” [30].
The source of the attack can vary from mobile phones to personal computers to
other digital mediums. While studying the various sources of cyberbullying, it
is critical to study the behavior and reaction of the attackers and their victims.
Nocentini et al. studied the behavior of attackers for different types of cyberbullying, including an imbalance of power, intention, repetition, anonymity, and
publicity [34].

Impacts of Cyberbullying

Previous works have explored the effects of cyberbullying on targets, especially
teenagers; sometimes, such abuse can impact both the cyberaggressors and cybervictims. Bonanno and Hymel found that both victims and perpetrators of
cyberbullying were more likely to develop depression and suicidal thoughts than
those involved in other types of bullying [5]. Dredge et al. noted the detrimental
effects of cyberbullying on targets’ social and emotional lives, with the severity of the impact of the harassment depending on different factors, including
the anonymity of the perpetrators and bystanders’ presence [18]. Similarly, Wisniewski et al. noted that lower online risk could help in the teens’ developmental stages while developing and enhancing crucial interpersonal skills, such
as boundary setting, conflict resolution, and empathy [50]. In addition to the
mental impact, Šléglová and Cerna found that cyberbullying led to behavioral
changes, with victims displaying more cautious browsing habits and avoidance
strategies [43]. McHugh et al. noted the negative emotions victims of cyberbullying experience, though they also found that the impact may be more short-term
than previously thought, emphasizing the importance of resilience [31].
2.3

Social Media Bullying

Cyberbullying can occur across a range of different online platforms, including
social networks, chat rooms, and mobile messaging applications, regardless of
geographic proximity; such bullying can last as little as a week or go on for
much longer [45]. Because social networking platforms are often used as a means
of self-comparison, they are a prime source of self-esteem issues [48]. Several
high-profile incidents of cyberbullying have taken place over major social media
platforms. In May 2020, a Japanese reality TV star took her own life after being
subject to abuse on social media [4]. Similar incidents across the world have led
lawmakers to pass legislation that would make cyberbullying criminal [20].
As a mitigating measure, some prior work has focused on improving social
media policies to prevent perpetrators from abusing their victims. Milosevic
examined the responsibilities of social media companies’ in addressing cyberbullying among children [33]. They mention concerns on the transparency and
accountability of these platforms in addressing and mitigating such issues.
2.4

Cyberbullying Trend Analysis

Studies that analyze trends in cyberbullying help understand how events can
impact digital users. Schneider et al. conducted four surveys across 17 high
schools and found that the overall rate of cyberbullying increased from 2006
to 2012 [26]. Through survey-based analysis, Snell and Englander found that
females are more likely to be involved in cyberbullying as both victims and as
perpetrators, indicating the importance of gender as a factor in mitigating online
bullying [46]. Mangaonkar et al. used a distributed design for analyzing tweets
and detecting cyberbullying in real-time [29].

4

Das et al.

Twitter allows users to express themselves in 280 character ‘tweets;’ prior
studies have analyzed these messages for cyberbullying [2,36]. Cortis and Handschuh analyzed bullying tweets in the context of two trending events (the Ebola
outbreak and the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri). They identified commonly used hashtags and named entities in bullying tweets [10]. Whether
or not such crises increased, bullying tweets were not studied. Due to an increase
in individuals’ online digital presence, assumptions have been made that the pandemic situation from COVID-19 can increase cyberbullying incidents. Thus, our
goal is to understand the trend and find evidence to support or contradict this
hypothesis.

Methodology and Findings

Twitter is a social networking site where users can post real-time messages.
With over 300 million active daily users, it is an ideal data source [8]. To assess
the impact of COVID-19 on cyberbullying, we collected 454, 046 public tweets
on Twitter, all of which mentioned cyberbullying. We outline our process for
collecting and analyzing the relevant tweets below.
3.1

Data Collection

We scraped Twitter for user-posted, publicly available tweets related to the topics of cyberbullying, social media bullying, online harassment, etc. More specifically, we used the following key terms when conducting our search: Internet
bullying, Internet bully, Internet bullies, online abuse, online harassment, online
shaming, online stalking, cyberbullying, social media bullying, stop cyberbullying,
cyber bully, cyber bullies, FB bullying, FB cyberbullying, FB harassment, FB
victim, Facebook bullying, Facebook cyberbullying, Facebook victim, Facebook harassment, Twitter bullying, Twitter cyberbullying, Twitter harassment, Twitter
victim, Insta bullying, Insta cyberbullying, Insta harassment, Insta victim.
The data was collected using the Get Old Tweets API [19], which allowed
us to access tweets older than one week. This API was used in the web crawler,
written in Python, and the data was stored with MongoDB. The data collection
spanned from January 1st , 2020–June 7th , 2020. This timeline was mainly selected to note the impact of COVID-19 on online users and determine whether
the crisis led to an increase in online abuse. We specifically only collected direct
tweets and removed any retweets or duplicate tweets.
3.2

Analysis

After completing the data collection, we performed a trend analysis to evaluate
the impact of the crisis. Using the timestamp of the post, we obtained the daily
count of the tweets, which including at least one of these keywords. Figure 1
shows the daily count for the 159 days from 01st January, 2020 to 07th June,
2020.

Fig. 1. Daily count of total tweets related to cyberbullying

There were 28 different keywords (mentioned above). Some of the keywords
had fewer tweets with a negligible impact on the analysis. Thus, we broadly
divide them into three sub-classes: keywords containing ”cyber” (CY) for the
keywords – cyberbullying, cyber bully, cyber bullies, stop cyberbullying, FB cyberbullying, Facebook cyberbullying, and Insta cyberbullying; ”online/internet”
(ON) for the keywords – internet bullying, Internet bully, Internet bullies, online
abuse, online harassment, online shaming, online stalking, and ”twitter” (TW)
for keywords – Twitter bullying, Twitter cyberbullying, Twitter harassment,
and Twitter victim. The total daily counts for these sub-classes are shown in
Figure 2. We also tabulate them later in the changepoint analysis in Section 3.3
(Table 1).
One can see a pattern prevalent to all the counts and the sub-classes that
we present here. Overall, except for the sub-class ‘ON’ , there does not seem
to be a considerable change in mean except it went slightly upwards since midMarch and in all categories, including the total. We notice a more considerable
spike in the cyberbullying related tweets in the second half of May. The sudden
rise in the frequency of tweets in the second half of May can be due to the
suicide of the Japanese TV star [32]. Moreover, for the class ‘ON’ , one can see
a spike in the second half of February, and the overall mean also had an upward
trend. This may or may not be due to the pandemic. Since these are cumulative
graphs of the prevalence of such words, we wanted to introspect in each of the
18 keywords in the subclasses (CY=seven, ON=seven, TW=four keywords).
Out of them, we observed three keywords: “cyberbullying, cyber bully, cyber

6

Fig. 2. Daily count of total tweets for the three sub-classes (CY, ON, and TW)

bullies” having a significant impact which we summarize in Figure 3. We provide
some mathematical details in the next subsection about how to formally test
changepoint.
3.3

Changepoint Analysis

Assume we observe X1 , . . . , XT over T time-points, and we are suspecting at
most ONE changepoint (AMOC) location τ in mean i.e.
E(Xi ) = µ if i ≤ τ, and E(Xi ) = µ + δ if i > τ where δ 6= 0.
In layman’s term this mean that the realized counts as random variables have a
different mean before and after the change-point location τ . Statistically speaking this difference needs to be significant to be able to be detected from the
observed data. We adopt a CUSUM technique for estimating the changepoint
location. We define it as:

s(n − s)
τ̂ = argmax
n
1≤s≤T

s
T
X
1X
1
Xi −
Xi
s i=1
n − s i=s+1

Intuitively, the above equation is the location that maximizes the difference
of normalized cumulative sum before and after this point. There have been previous literature on offline change-point detection [37,21,39]. Here, for simplicity,

Title Suppressed Due to Excessive Length

Fig. 3. Impact of the Cyberbullying Incidents dependent on Three Major Keywords
(cyberbullying, cyber bully, and cyberbullies)

we assume independence over time-horizon. In statistics literature, consistency
results typically assume the observations to be Gaussian; however, since this is
a count data, it can be questionable. In light of the weak law of large numbers, however, one can assume normality as the counts are large. To detect the
changepoints, we employ the changepoint package in R and observe the following changepoints in the three sub-classes and the three significant individual
keywords. These are tabulated in Tables 1 and 2. All these changepoints were
significant at the type-1 error level α = 0.05.

Table 1. Changepoint analysis of 3 sub-classes

We note that, for all the series and sub-classes we observe a changepoint. Except for the subclass ‘ON,’ all of the changepoints can be possibly be attributed
to COVID. However, the total count did not show any changepoint, and we
think this can be due to multiple reasons. First, we are adding a lot of keywords.

2nd May
”cyber bully” 27,806 31st March
”cyberbullies” 24,287 31st March
Table 2. Changepoint analysis of 3 specific keywords

Thus, the effects might get confounded. A more important reason could be the
simplicity of the assumption of independence. We show in Figure 4 that the
total count of the individual keywords and all three sub-classes show significant
correlation over time. Once the dependence is taken care of, it is possible that
even the total count data will show changepoints somewhere around the end of
March. We wish to explore this as a future work.

Conclusion and Future Works

In this work in progress, we wish to explore a comprehensive time-trend analysis
of the impact of COVID-19 on cyberbullying as suspected by many experts.
We found that certain class of keywords show a change in cyberbullying related
tweets from the end of February or March when the pandemic fear primarily

started. As a future extension of this work, we would like to comprehensively
address this using a change-point analysis for a time-series of count data. One can
also implement possible changes in variance since we observed some fluctuations
in the tweet counts. An interesting finding from this initial analysis is that the
change points for different sub-class and tweets are not necessarily close. This can
lead us to employ methods from prior work Karmakar et al. [23] to statistically
validate the hypothesis of synchronization of changepoints, as the authors therein
allowed for non-linear non-Gaussian time-series.
We are also working on an alternative formulation of the same problem using
a Bayesian time-varying paradigm [24]. We assume the parameters of the models
do not change abruptly if there is a change-point but instead shows a more
gradual change. We wish to explore time-varying models in a frequentist sense
as done in [25,22] or Bayesian methods from a relatively recent work by Roy and
Karmakar [40] in the regime of count autoregressive series. This would allow us
to incorporate dependence in the analysis and give a clearer picture of how the
mean or the dependence coefficient changed over time (and thus if COVID-19
had a telling effect on the increase). A time-series formulation often asks for
prediction of the future, and such a work has not yet been done in the field of
cyberbullying trend analysis. Instead of a single k-step ahead forecast, we would
like to predict the trend for an entire month or two. We wish to explore statistical
methods developed by Zhouwu et al. and Chudy et al. [55,7] to this non-Gaussian
count time series and build statistically valid prediction intervals. This can help
create a mitigating strategy in case we can predict a rise of cyberbullying for
the next one or two months.
