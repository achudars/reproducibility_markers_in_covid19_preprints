Abstract – Some basic facts that enable or constrain efforts to “flatten the curve” by nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPI) are summarized and placed in the current context of the
COVID-19 epidemic. Analytical formulas are presented for a simple two-tier NPI strategy
that places different social distancing targets for high- and low-risk groups. The results aim
to facilitate rapid what-if analysis rather than replace detailed simulation, which remains
indispensable for informed decision making. The appearance of the oft neglected Lambert
function in the resulting formulas is noted.
Keywords – COVID-19, Coronavirus, Flattening the Curve, Social Distancing, Population Dynamics, Control

1. Introduction

In the absence of effective vaccines or antiviral drugs against
COVID-19, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) –
measures aiming at reducing virus transmission in the
population through reduction of human contacts – remain the
only viable response to the epidemic.3 The inexorable realities
faced by NPI are best accentuated by the simple plot in Figure
1 resulting from analysis of the standard SIR epidemiology
model: With the basic reproductive ratio, 𝑅𝑅0 , for COVID-19
being between 2 and 3,2 the total fraction of a population
infected by the end of the epidemic – whenever that might
come – would be around 90% (for 𝑅𝑅0 ≈ 2.5 in Figure 1) in the
absence of NPI. At a fraction of 1% mortality for infected
individuals, fatalities for a population the size of the US would
be in the millions. This bleak estimate is in agreement with
results from more elaborate calculations earlier presented by
the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).4
NPI measures should bring 𝑅𝑅0 down from 2.5 to about 1.0
for the infection rate to eventually reverse sign to negative,
thus eventually resulting in low single digits for total
percentage of infected individuals in a population (Figure 1);
or to below 1, for the epidemic to immediately start
contracting. For example, it is reported that travel restrictions
in Wuhan, China quickly brought 𝑅𝑅0 down from 2.35 to 1.05.2
Similarly, recent projections by the US federal government for
200,000 fatalities correspond to 𝑅𝑅0 ≈ 1.03.5 As a practical

Figure 1. Total fraction of a population infected and removed
by the end of an epidemic as a function of the basic
reproductive ratio 𝑅𝑅0 – the average number of secondary
infections arising from an average primary infection in an
entirely susceptible population, eqn. (2) – according to eqn. (7).
For 𝑅𝑅0 < 1 the virus does not spread and the epidemic is
contained. Reports on data from Wuhan, China, estimate 𝑅𝑅0
dropping from 3 to 1 to 0.3 with each successive round of NPI
measures implemented,1 or from 2.35 to 1.05.2 The sensitivity
of the total infected fraction (and resulting critical care needs
and fatalities) to small uncertainty in 𝑅𝑅0 makes accurate
predictions difficult when 𝑅𝑅0 ≈ 1.

matter, current data on exponential growth of infections in
various countries (widely available on the internet6) indicate
that extraordinary measures are needed for 𝑅𝑅0 to be drastically
reduced. With a sizable asymptomatic period for infected
individuals, universal restrictions on social contacts quickly
emerged as a preferred NPI measure.1

many cases of this kind of enhanced social distancing for the
elderly,9 the contribution of this paper is a simple way to
quickly assess the effects of design parameters, such as cut-off
age or distancing targets for high- and low-risk groups. The
standard SIR model with two-subpopulations is used. Exact or
approximate analytical solutions are obtained that can easily
asses the effects of decision variables on outcomes such as
hospitalization and critical care needs or fatalities. It is
emphasized that the intent of the paper is not to advocate any
particular policy. Rather, it purports to provide shortcut tools
that both scientists and public officials can easily use in rapid
what-if analysis of related ideas.

In addition to the role of 𝑅𝑅0 already discussed, it turns out
that reducing 𝑅𝑅0 helps mitigate the overwhelming of
hospitalization facilities by infected individuals in need of
treatment, and thus prevent fatalities from inadequately
treated infections. This is because the fraction of infectious
individuals reaches its peak value of 1 − 1/𝑅𝑅0 − ln(𝑅𝑅0 )/𝑅𝑅0
at a time approximately proportional to 1/(𝑅𝑅0 − 1) (Appendix
B). In this context, lowering that peak by reducing 𝑅𝑅0
achieves “Flattening the Curve,”6-8 as discussed in more detail
in section 3.
These realizations have culminated into the policy “Stay
Home”, as a practical if universal NPI measure to effect the
necessary reduction in human contacts and thus lower 𝑅𝑅0 .
However, in addition to flattening the curve, this reduction
also has adverse effects felt by many, not least in terms of
drastically reduced economic activity. Facing the inexorable
conflict summarized as “saving lives vs. saving the economy”
appears inevitable. The purpose of this publication is to help
understand that conflict and contribute towards its mitigation
by exploiting a simple and widely observed fact: That
hospitalization and fatality rates are higher by at least an order
of magnitude among the elderly and the vulnerable who are
roughly 1/5 to 1/6 of the population (Figure 2).9,10

for the fractions, 𝑠𝑠(𝑡𝑡) and 𝑖𝑖(𝑡𝑡), referring to susceptible to a
spreading infection and infectious, respectively, in a
population of constant size. The third fraction,
(3)

𝑟𝑟(𝑡𝑡) = 1 − 𝑠𝑠(𝑡𝑡) − 𝑖𝑖(𝑡𝑡)

refers to individuals removed from the infectious group, by
either recovery or death. Clearly, then,
𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑
𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑

(4)

= 𝛾𝛾𝛾𝛾

where 𝑟𝑟(0) = 0, 𝑖𝑖(0) = 𝜖𝜖, 𝑠𝑠(0) = 1 − 𝜖𝜖; 𝛽𝛽 is the infection
spread rate; 𝛾𝛾 is the removal rate from the infectious group;
and 𝑅𝑅0 ≝ 𝛽𝛽/𝛾𝛾 is the basic reproductive ratio. NPI aims at
designing interventions, such as closing schools, churches,
and social venues, workplace distancing, or quarantine, in
order that the resulting universal 𝑅𝑅0 – as uncertain as 𝑅𝑅0 may
be – best achieve desired outcomes.1,16
Despite its utter simplicity, the SIR model provides
valuable insights for the course of an epidemic,15 which are
relevant to the two-tier strategy to be presented in the next
section. In summary, eqn. (2) implies that an epidemic does
not occur iff
(5)

𝑅𝑅0 < 1

For 𝑅𝑅0 > 1, eqns. (1)-(4) imply that (a) the infection spreads
and an epidemic occurs (b) the infectious fraction, 𝑖𝑖, initially
rises exponentially at rate 𝛽𝛽 − 𝛾𝛾 > 0, (c) peaks at time 𝑡𝑡 ∗ with

critical care and resulting in fatalities over US age groups.3,11

𝑠𝑠(𝑡𝑡 ∗ ) =

Therefore, by shielding human contact for this high-risk
group more than the low-risk group, the effective combined
𝑅𝑅0 could be improved, with commensurate reduction in
hospitalization and fatality rates, without increasing adverse
effects on the economy, as the most economically active group
would face no additional restrictions on distancing. While
numerical simulations on sophisticated models have included

a fixed value of 𝑅𝑅0 as illustrated in Figure 4. This has obvious
implications for designing strategies to flatten the curve.

(Figure 1) where 𝑊𝑊(𝑧𝑧) is the Lambert function.17,18* It is eqn.
(7) that underlies the stark predictions for anticipated fatalities
from COVID-19 and the challenges faced by NPI in the
absence of a vaccine, as already discussed in the Introduction.
Responses to the epidemic clearly can involve
sophisticated policies that adjust 𝑅𝑅0 over time, over
geographical areas, or over different population groups. What
follows is not an attempt to replace these indispensable tools.
Rather, it is an attempt to present shortcut methods for rapid
what-if analysis.
* Interestingly, the analytical solution of the algebraic equation 1 −
𝑟𝑟(∞) = 𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒(−𝑟𝑟(∞)𝑅𝑅0 ) for the SIR model in terms of the Lambert
function 𝑊𝑊(𝑧𝑧), eqn. (4), pointed out as early as 1996,17 if not
earlier, may have escaped the attention of most literature in this
field.15

In a population consisting of high-risk and low-risk groups a
number of possibilities exist for adjusting binary contacts
between groups. Assuming different rates of infection in
contacts between the groups, the SRI model becomes

3. Flattening the curve: Benefits and compromises

As already discussed, “Flattening the Curve” by effecting a
low 𝑅𝑅0 (well below 2.5, near or below 1) is a universal
approach to mitigating the total number of fatalities
throughout the epidemic (Figure 1) as well as the number of
infected patients in need of hospitalization or critical care at
any time. It can be shown (Appendix B) that the appropriate
𝑅𝑅0 , given a maximum infectious fraction, 𝑖𝑖 ∗ , is given
analytically by

𝑖𝑖𝐻𝐻 (0) = 𝜖𝜖𝐻𝐻 , 𝑖𝑖𝐿𝐿 (0) = 𝜖𝜖𝐿𝐿 . The positive parameters 𝜙𝜙 ≤ 1 and
𝜓𝜓 ≤ 1 capture the additional measures taken by the high-risk
group, to avoid contacts.
Eqns. (12) and (13) imply that 𝑖𝑖(𝑡𝑡) declines after 𝑡𝑡 ∗ if

(Appendix A). If 𝜙𝜙 = 𝜓𝜓 = 1, the

herd immunity inequality, eqn. (6), is recovered.
In the rest of the paper we assume 𝜙𝜙 = 𝜓𝜓 and 𝛾𝛾𝐻𝐻 = 𝛾𝛾𝐿𝐿 .

Reducing the universal 𝑅𝑅0 value, however, inevitably
prolongs the time, 𝑡𝑡 ∗ , to the lowered peak of the infectious
fraction, 𝑟𝑟(𝑡𝑡 ∗ ), hence the duration of the epidemic as well.
This can be roughly captured by the time, 𝑡𝑡̃, needed for 𝑖𝑖 to
reach an inflection, according to the equation

For 𝜙𝜙 = 1 eqn. (17) simply confirms that both groups are
infected at the same rate. In the extreme, if unrealistic case of
𝜙𝜙 = 0 (quarantine of the high-risk group) it would follow
from eqn. (17) that 𝑠𝑠𝐻𝐻 (𝑡𝑡) = 𝑠𝑠𝐻𝐻 (0), suggesting that only the
low-risk group would be infected, with much lower needs for
hospitalization and fatality rates.

(Appendix B).
Eqn. (8) also suggests that while the time to peak decreases
as 𝑖𝑖(0) = 𝜖𝜖 increases, the peak value of 𝑖𝑖(𝑡𝑡 ∗ ) remains
approximately constant over a wide range of values of 𝜖𝜖, given

For practically more interesting intermediate values of 𝜙𝜙,
realistically closer to 1, it turns out (as explained next) that
both fatalities and critical care needs are reduced, as shown in
Figure 5.

6. Total fatalities for the two-tier strategy

Similar to eqn. (7), the total fraction of infected through the
epidemic for each of the high- and low-risk groups can be
shown (Appendix D) to be

(bottom) by placing additional restrictions, 𝜙𝜙, on the high-risk
group of a population (eqn. (19)). Age is used as a simple, if
rough proxy to separate between high- and low-risk groups
(Figure 2).

To generate the results in Figure 5, it is first assumed that
the population fraction of low-risk infected by the end of the
epidemic,
𝑟𝑟𝐿𝐿 (∞) = 𝑠𝑠𝐿𝐿 (0) − 𝑠𝑠𝐿𝐿 (∞) ≤ 𝑠𝑠𝐿𝐿 (0),
is set at an upper bound, to cap fatalities, given a level of
restrictions 𝑅𝑅0 on that group; whereas the high-risk group can
manage additional restrictions 𝜙𝜙𝑅𝑅0 , to experience a
corresponding population fraction of infected
𝑟𝑟𝐻𝐻 (∞) = 𝑠𝑠𝐻𝐻 (0) − 𝑠𝑠𝐻𝐻 (∞) ≤ 𝑠𝑠𝐻𝐻 (0).
Then, the fatality fraction, 𝑓𝑓, for the entire population by
the end of the epidemic will be
𝑓𝑓 = 𝑟𝑟𝐻𝐻 (∞)𝑓𝑓𝐻𝐻 + 𝑟𝑟𝐿𝐿 (∞)𝑓𝑓𝐿𝐿

Figure 6. Infected fractions of the population for high- and lowrisk groups (cut-off age at 70) by the end of the epidemic.

Finally, combined with eqn. (18), eqns. (21) and (22) yield
the number of fatalities for the US shown in Figure 7.

(18)

It can be shown (Appendix C) that the ratio of the total
fatality fraction 𝑓𝑓 for 𝜙𝜙 < 1 and for 𝜙𝜙 = 1 is approximately
independent of the selected value of 𝑟𝑟𝐿𝐿 (∞) for reasonably
small values of 𝑟𝑟𝐿𝐿 (∞), e.g. below 0.1 − 0.2, as

A similar expression can be derived in the same way for
hospitalization and critical care needs. In both cases,
derivation relies in the simple approximation of eqn. (17)

Note that the results in this section have been derived with

7. Discussion

Simple analytical formulas for a two-tier NPI strategy to
“flatten the curve” were collected. The formulas are based on
a simple two-tier model of the SIR variety, involving highand low-risk groups, and are meant to be used for rapid
answers to what-if questions, rather than to provide accurate
numbers. For the latter, numerical simulation remains the tool
of choice. Taming the COVID-19 epidemic is a multifaceted
problem that will require diverse resources and approaches. It
is hoped that this text will contribute to that effort.
