Abstract
40 days after the start of the international monitoring of COVID-19, we search for the effect of
official announcements regarding new cases of infection and death ratio on the financial
markets volatility index (VIX). Whereas the new cases reported in China and outside China
have a mixed effect on financial volatility, the death ratio positively influences VIX, that outside
China triggering a more important impact. In addition, the higher the number of affected
countries, the higher the financial volatility is.

1. Introduction

The coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreaks in December 2019 in China, in the city of Wuhan
(Hubei region). On March 3, 2020, the virus has already affected more than 90,000 people in
more than 60 countries, having killed thousands. Starting with January 20, 2020, the World
Health Organization (WHO) monitored the situation and released daily reports about new cases
of infections and death number in the Chinese regions and outside China. Following the general
fear in China, the Shanghai stock market plunged 8% on February 3, 2020, and the shock rapidly
spread over international financial markets. The United States (US) stock prices recorded their
lower level in the last six months. However, a second, and more important shock hit the US
market on February 28, when the S&P 500 plummeted 4.4%. Initially ignored, the COVID-19
effect raised serious concerns since the infection rapidly propagated outside China. The WHO
report of February 28, 2020 underlined over one thousand new cases outside China and five
new countries affected. The US financial markets reacted to this news, although Mr. Trump
announced that a solution to this problem will be found “soon”, by the scientists.
The coronavirus panic affects the world economy, with a negative impact on trade and
tourism, generating local food shortages.1 In addition, in the presence of stock markets price
bubbles (S&P 500 recorded a maximum of 3,380 points on February 14, 2020, meaning an
increase of 65%, as compared to February 14, 2015), COVID-19’s impact on the financial
system cannot be ignored. Therefore, several questions emerge. How does this virus affect
financial markets volatility? Will COVID-19 be the source of a new financial crisis? Without
tempting to provide a straight answer to the second question, the purpose of this paper is to
show how the coronavirus figures reported by WHO impact the financial markets volatility
index (VIX). We consider a period of 40 days, starting with January 20, 2020, up to February
28, 2020. We look at three categories of data, namely new case announcements and death ratio
(in China and outside China), as well at the number of daily affected countries.
The financial volatility has different sources, related to economic conditions, institutional
issues or market uncertainty (Hartwell, 2018). Macroeconomic announcements also affect the
financial volatility. In this line, Onan et al. (2014) find that good and bad announcements
asymmetrically impact VIX, whereas most of recent studies focus on the role of Economic
Policy Uncertainty (EPU) in influencing the financial volatility (Antonakakis et al., 2013; Chen
and Chiang, 2020; Kalyvas et al., 2019; Mei et al., 2018; Tiwari et al., 2019; Zhenghui and

In Northern Italy, several supermarkets were emptied, situation also recorded in other European countries, as
Germany and the United Kingdom. Consequently, the “fasting” period installed quite earlier this year.

Junhao, 2019). For example, Karnizova and (Chris) Li (2014) predict the US recession using
the interaction between EPU and stock market volatility, whereas Zhu et al. (2019) investigate
how a fear index influences the US stock market volatility.
Looking to the coronavirus-generated fear, this is the first paper addressing the impact of
COVID-19 announcements on financial market volatility. We discover that the figures related
to the propagation of the coronavirus outside China generate a higher volatility on financial
markets, as compared to those reported for China. Further, the financial volatility increases with
the number of affected countries.

2. Coronavirus: stylized facts

COVID-19 started to be considered more aggressive as compared to the Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) recorded in 2003. The number of deaths already overlaps those
generated by SARS, spreading in more than 60 countries at the beginning of March 2020.
According to WHO data, the virus regresses in China, but rapidly spreads in countries like
South Korea, Italy or Iran. Figure 1 presents the dynamics of the total number of infected
persons, new cases, death ratio and affected countries since January 20, 2020.

According to Figure 1(a) the pick of new cases announced in China was reached in
February. In fact, on February 16 (the associated statistics are intentionally excluded from the
3

graphic), China announced a record of 19,461 new cases. Figure 1(b) shows that most of
infected people originate in China. The death ratio computed as the ratio between reported
deaths and infected persons (Figure 1(c)) is much lower outside China, as compared to China.
However, the overall death ratio is close to 3.5%. Finally, since February 23, we have witnessed
a rapid spread of coronavirus at global level (Figure 1(d)).

3. Empirical specification and results

We test a simple regression on the coronavirus effect on financial volatility and we use a
stepwise procedure. In the first step (Eq. (1)) we implement a naïve estimation whereas in the
second step (Eq. (2)) we consider the US EPU as control variable. Daily data comes from WHO
and FRED database, respectively.
𝑉𝐼𝑋𝑡 = 𝑐 + 𝛼𝑡 𝐶𝑂𝑉𝐼𝐷 − 19𝑡 + 𝜀𝑡

𝑉𝐼𝑋𝑡 = 𝑐 + 𝛼𝑡 𝐶𝑂𝑉𝐼𝐷 − 19𝑡 + 𝛽𝑡 𝐸𝑃𝑈𝑡 + 𝜀𝑡

We estimate three models, with a focus on China’s reported data (Model 1), on countries
outside China (Model 2) and on the overall situation (Model 3). Three types of analyzes are
performed. In Table 1 we present the impact of announcements related to new infection cases.2
In Table 2 we show the estimates of death ratio influence on financial volatility. Finally, in
Table 3 we show the results of the impact of coronavirus worldwide spread.
Table 1 highlights that COVID-19 new reported cases have a marginal negative effect on
financial volatility (Model 1). This effect remains unchanged if EPU is used as control variable
and can be explained by a decrease of the number of new infections in China in the second part
of February, while the volatility slightly increased. Nevertheless, if we look to the new cases
reported outside China (Model 2), we clearly see that COVID-19 contributes to an increase of
financial volatility. Likewise, the markets are more sensitive to the coronavirus spillover in
Europe and US. Model 3 reveals inconclusive results about the COVID-19 total new reported
cases on VIX.

For this set of analyses and Model 1 (where we investigate the impact of new cases reported in China on VIX),
we also apply an ordinary least square regression with a structural break, to account for the potential effect of new
cases reported by China on February 16, 2020. The results are not significantly different from those shown in
Table 1 and can be provided under request.

In a subsequent analysis we investigate the impact of COVID-19 death ratio on VIX
(Table 2). The death ratio has a positive and very significant impact on financial volatility and
this result is very robust. Moreover, as expected, we notice that the death ratio associated with
the virus propagation outside China determines a higher financial volatility, as compared to the
ratio reported for China. In terms of elasticities, the naïve specification (Model 2) evidences
that an increase of 1% in the death ratio generates an increase of 11% in the financial volatility
index. Compared to the previous set of estimations, where no significant effect is reported, the
total death ratio (China and other affected countries) positively impacts the volatility.

The last analysis tests the effect of the number of countries affected by the virus during
the analyzed period, on the financial volatility. Table 3 shows a positive impact on VIX,
confirming thus the previous results. The findings are robust to the use of US EPU as a control
variable and show that the spread of coronavirus in general, and the increasing death ratio in
particular, bust the financial volatility.

4. Conclusions

We have tested the impact of COVID-19 official announcements and related figures on
the financial volatility, comparing the effect of data reported in China, with that of COVID-19
numbers reported outside China. Our results show that: (i) only the new cases reported outside
China have a positive impact on VIX, (ii) the death ratio has a significant and positive impact
on VIX for all tested models, and the effect is stronger for the death ratio outside China, (iii)
the spread of coronavirus increases the financial volatility. The persistence of COVID-19 might
generate a new episode of international financial stress.
