Abstract
The spread of the coronavirus (COVID–19), starting in late 2019, has determined in Italy several
interventions aimed to prevent saturation of the health system. We have examined the effects of
such measures by proposing a mean–field model describing the spread of the infection based on a
simple diffusion process where all the observable variables (number of people still positive to the
infection, hospitalized and fatalities cases, healed people, and total number of people that has
contracted the infection) depend on average parameters, namely diffusion coefficient, infection
cross–section, and population density. Although this model is less sophisticated than other models
in the literature, it allows us to directly relate the trend of the epidemic statistical information
(hospitalized cases, number of fatalities, number of infected people, etc.) to a well defined
observable physical quantity: the average number of people that any individual meets per day. The
model fits very well the epidemic data, and allows us to strictly relate the time evolution of the
number of hospitalized case and fatalities of the outbreak to the change of people mobility,
consequent to the implementation of progressive restrictions in Italy, running until the present days
(November the 15th, 2020).

Introduction
The new coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS–CoV–2),
initially started in the city of Wuhan, China,1–4 has transformed into a pandemic that has affected a
large number of countries around the world.5–7 In Italy, as of November the 15th, 2020, a total of
1,178,529 cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID–19) and 45,229 deaths have been confirmed.8
Models are extremely useful to identify physical key parameters influencing the spread of infection
and thus taking appropriate measures to limit serious consequences of the influenza/SARS
pandemics.3,4,7,9–14 In this work we propose a model based on the assumption that spreading of viral
infection can be described by a simple diffusion process, by assuming that all the state variables of
the analyzed system change in a continuous way.

Fig. 1 Experimental data of hospitalized people (red circles), fatalities (grey circles), people tested as active positive
to the viral infection (blue circles), people tested as healed (green circles), total number of cases (black circles) since the
beginning of the Covid–19 outbreak in Italy (February the 24th, 2020).

Compare to other descriptions, our approach allows us to get a fast feedback of the restriction
measures adopted to reduce people mobility and a prediction of the evolution scenarios on the basis
of a fit to the experimental available data shown in a semi–logarithmic plot as a function of time in
Fig. 1. The data refer to the numbers of the Covid–19 outbreak in Italy: people tested as active
positive (blue circles), people tested as healed (green circles), hospitalized people (red circles),
fatalities (grey circles), and total number of those who has been infected (black circles), since
February 2020, the 24th (the day the first case of Covid–19 infection was detected in an Italian
citizen). After the initial sudden increase of the number of cases, Italy implemented measures aimed
to limit people mobility from March 2020 the 9th to June 2020 the 14th (day range from the 15th to

2

the 112th in Fig. 1). The consequence of such measures was a significant slowdown of the outbreak
diffusion, following by a decrease in the number of positive and hospitalized cases until day 150th.
In the absence of measures strongly limiting people mobility, outbreak started to propagate again, at
increasing rate, until today.

Theoretical description
The model we propose for describing time evolution of the total number of infected people,
positive cases, healed people, deaths, and hospitalized people, during the Covid–19 outbreak is
based on an mean–field approximation consisting in the assumption that the probability for an
individual to contract the infection is uniformly proportional to the concentration 𝑝 of positive
circulating cases, to a diffusion coefficient 𝐷, equal to the surface area covered on average by the
individual in their movements in a day, and to a cross–section 𝜎 2 measuring the probability of a
single infection event (𝜎 2 = 𝜋𝑅 2 , 𝑅 being the average distance within which a positive individual
may infect a healthy one). Under this hypothesis, at any instant 𝑡, the increase 𝑑𝑝 of people positive
for viral infection in the time interval 𝑑𝑡 can be expressed as:
𝑑𝑝
𝑑𝑔 𝑑𝑚
= 𝜌𝐷𝜎 2 (𝜌 − 𝑐)𝑝 −
−
𝑑𝑡
𝑑𝑡
𝑑𝑡

(1)

where 𝜌 is the density of inhabitants ( 𝜌 = 200 km−2 for Italy), 𝑔 is the healed people
concentration, 𝑚 is the concentration of fatalities, and 𝑐 is the total concentration of those who have
contracted the virus at the time 𝑡. Here, we are also assuming that healed individuals reach virus
immunity lasting a characteristic time much longer than the other considered time scales.
A fraction 𝑓 of the new positive cases requires hospital care and, consequently, the
concentration 𝑟 of hospitalized people will change, in the time interval 𝑑𝑡, by a quantity 𝑑𝑟 given
by:
𝑑𝑟
𝑞 1−𝑞
)𝑟
= 𝑓𝜌𝐷𝜎 2 (𝜌 − 𝑐)𝑝 − ( +
𝑑𝑡
𝜏1
𝜏2

(2)

where we further consider that 𝑟 diminishes, in the same time interval 𝑑𝑡, because a fraction 𝑞 of
hospitalized people die in a characteristic time 𝜏1 , whilst the complementary fraction (1 − 𝑞) heal
in a characteristic time 𝜏2 . As a consequence, the concentration 𝑚 of fatalities varies with time
according to the following equation:
𝑑𝑚 𝑞
= 𝑟
𝑑𝑡
𝜏1

(3)

While the fraction 𝑓 of positive people is hospitalized, the fraction (1 − 𝑓) does not exhibit
serious symptoms until complete healing. Their concentration 𝑠 will vary on time according to the
following relationship:

3

𝑑𝑠
𝑠
= (1 − 𝑓)𝜌𝐷𝜎 2 (𝜌 − 𝑐)𝑝 −
𝑑𝑡
𝜏3

(4)

𝜏3 being the characteristic time toward the healing for these individuals. As reported in Ref. 15, this
characteristic time is typically larger than 𝜏2 , i.e. the one used for describing time dependent healing
of the most severe hospitalized cases (Eq. 2). As a consequence, the time dependence of the
concentration 𝑔 of healed people changes in time according to:
𝑑𝑔
𝑠 (1 − 𝑞)𝑟
= +
𝑑𝑡 𝜏3
𝜏2

(5)

Finally, the total concentration 𝑐 of those who have contracted the infection will vary on time
according to the following relationship:
𝑑𝑐
= 𝜌𝐷𝜎 2 (𝜌 − 𝑐)𝑝
𝑑𝑡

(6)

Our description is based on the assumption that the dynamics of all the observable variables,
𝑝, 𝑟, 𝑚, 𝑔, 𝑐, can be described in terms of the time dependence of the diffusion coefficient 𝐷 =
𝐷(𝑡).
It should be noticed that the data of people tested as positive or healed (blue and green circles
in Fig. 1) represent only a small fraction of the real corresponding concentration values, since they
refer to the cases actually detected through the adopted testing procedure (swabs), restricted to a
defined relatively small sample of the entire population. We believe that these sources of
uncertainty could be partly mitigated by estimating the model parameters from a fit focused only to
the data representing the time evolution of hospitalized and fatality cases (red and grey circles in
Fig. 1), reported by “Dipartimento della Protezione Civile”.8
In order to reduce the number of free parameters, we decided to fix the healing characteristic
times, 𝜏2 and 𝜏3 , to the values experimentally determined in Ref. [15] (𝜏2 = 20 days and 𝜏3 = 14
days, respectively). It should be also considered that the contribution of 𝜎 2 (the cross–section for
the infection event) is not separated from the one of the diffusion coefficient 𝐷, since Eqs. 1, 2, 4, 6
contains only the product 𝜎 2 𝐷. In particular, we have set 𝜎 2 = 3.14 m2 (corresponding to 𝑅 = 1
m), and, then, the only free parameters that remain to be determined by the fit to the experimental
data are 𝑓, 𝑞, 𝜏1 .
As we have already pointed out, the model is also based on the knowledge of the time
dependence of the diffusion coefficient 𝐷 that strongly depends on the adopted restriction measures
to the people mobility. Information about the form of the function 𝐷 = 𝐷(𝑡) can be inferred by
admitting that 𝐷 can vary while calculating 𝑟 (Eq. 1 to 6), point by point, along the whole
integration interval, in order to minimize the difference with the corresponding experimental point
(we imposed that such a difference keeps lower than 1%). For the calculations we imposed the

4

following initial conditions: 𝑟0 = 127 (i.e. the experimental point at 𝑡 = 0), 𝑝0 = 𝑟0 ⁄(1 − 𝑓), 𝑐0 =
𝑝0 , 𝑔0 = 0, 𝑚0 = 0.
The obtained values of 𝐷, determined as a function of different sets of the 𝑓, 𝑞, 𝜏1 parameters,
are plotted in Fig. 2 as a function of time (red curves). We notice that 𝐷 depends only very weakly
on 𝑓, 𝑞, 𝜏1 . Its behavior is characterized by a strong decrease, extending until June, the 14th and
corresponding to the end of the initial stages of the mobility restriction measures, followed by a
smooth increase lasting till October, the 1st, and by an even more significant increase starting after
October, the 1st and extending till October, the 25th. After that date, 𝐷 starts to decrease again as a
consequence of the new, more recent, mobility restriction measures adopted by Italy. It should be
also noticed that, the period following the end of the first stages of the measures limiting physical
distance (i.e. after June, the 14th) is characterized by a rather slow recovery toward higher values of
the mobility. We argue that this result is mainly due to the persistence of a spontaneous attention of
people in limiting the number of physical contacts. However, the increasing rate of 𝐷 becomes
suddenly larger in correspondence of October, the 1st, likely associated with the combined effect of
school opening and resumption of the working activities combined with the reduction of the smart
working modality.

Fig. 2 Diffusion coefficient 𝐷 as a function of time as determined from the analysis of the data on hospitalized cases
shown in Fig. 1, by applying the proposed model (red curve) for different sets of the 𝑓, 𝑞, 𝜏1 parameters. The blue
continuous curve is a fit to the data by using Eq. 7 and the parameters listed in Tab. I.

The blue line plotted in Fig. 2 is a fit to the 𝐷 values by using a set of four Fermi–Dirac
distribution like functions, each defined within a specific time range, of the kind of:
𝐷 = 𝐷2 +

𝐷1 − 𝐷2
𝑡−𝑡
exp ( 𝜏 0 ) + 1

where, for each time range, 𝐷1 and 𝐷2 are the two levels between which the diffusion coefficient
varies in correspondence of any transition associated with the change of the mobility restriction
measures, 𝑡0 is the time at which the transition occurs, and 𝜏𝑐 is a measure of the time interval
required to change 𝐷 from the value 𝐷1 to 𝐷2 . We used a unique set of the 𝐷1 , 𝐷2 , 𝑡0 , 𝜏𝑐 parameter
values (reported in Tab. II), to fit all the data shown in Fig. 2, independently of the particular choice
of 𝑓, 𝑞, and 𝜏1 [blue continuous line in Fig. 2(a) to 2(d)].

Once the functional form of 𝐷 is determined, we can fit the model to the experimental data of
Fig. 1, thus getting the best–fit values of 𝑓, 𝑞, and 𝜏1 . We focus our fitting procedure to the data
concerning the number of both hospitalized case and fatalities (red and grey points in Fig. 1,
respectively), since, as we have pointed out, the other information, on positive tested individuals,
total infected persons, and healed people, represents only a relatively small fraction of the actual
values.

dot–dashed lines are fits of the model to the data and describe three different scenarios occurring after October
the 25th, 2020. Dashed lines are the result of calculation under the assumption that the restriction measures
adopted on October the 25th could produce a reduction of the diffusion coefficient 𝐷 to the same level reached
as a consequent of the lockdown of March the 9th, 2020. Dot–dashed and continuous lines describe the
scenarios in which the diffusion coefficient 𝐷 approaches, after October the 25th, 2020, values 2 or 2.36 times
larger, respectively.

In addition, in order to improve the fit of the theoretical 𝑟 and 𝑚 curves to the corresponding
experimental data, we have included the possibility that the fraction 𝑞 of hospitalized people that
unfortunately die (Eq. 3) abruptly moves, after 𝑡 = 80 days, due to the improvement of the
effectiveness of the therapeutic protocols, to a value lower than the one characteristic of the first
stages of the outbreak diffusion.

Tab. II Parameters used to fit the proposed model (Eqs. 1 to 6) to the experimental data of hospitalized and fatalities
cases shown in Fig. 1.

Fig. 3 shows the results of such a fitting procedure (red and grey continuous lines). The
corresponding fitting parameters are reported in Tab. II. We notice that the agreement with the
experimental data is excellent. Calculations were extended to a time range well beyond the last
experimental point (𝑡 = 266 days) in order to get prediction of the future trend of the number of
hospitalized and fatalities cases, accordingly to the more recent mobility restriction measures
implemented on October the 25th (the 245th day after the beginning of the outbreak in Italy). Of
course, this prediction depends on the particular choice of the parameter values we adopt for
describing the time dependence of 𝐷 for 𝑡 ≥ 245 days.

Fig. 4 Time dependence of the function 𝜌𝐷 (average number of people that each individual meets in a day) for the
three different scenario simulated as a consequence of the restriction measures adopted on October the 25 th, 2020.

In particular, we have put in evidence three different scenarios, simulated by using forms of
the 𝐷 function that differs only after the 245th day (October the 25th, 2020), when the Italian
government introduced new measures in order to reduce people mobility. For each of those
7

scenarios, in Fig. 4 the quantity 𝜌𝐷, representing the average number of persons that any individual
meets in a day, is plotted as a function of time. In the first scenario, we simulated a situation where
̅ , that has been
𝜌𝐷 can diminish, for 𝑡 ≥ 245 days, quite rapidly (𝜏𝑐 = 4 days) to the value, 𝜌𝐷
reached during the lockdown implemented at the first stages of the outbreak, characterized by
particularly severe measures adopted to limit physical distance among people in all the Italian
territory. This scenario produces a trend of the hospitalized and fatalities cases that is represented by
the dashed lines plotted in Fig. 3, with a number of fatalities that asymptotically approach the value
of about 5.4104. The second scenario is the one according to which 𝜌𝐷 decreases, in the same time
̅ . The consequent behaviour of the
range, after the 245th day, to a level two times larger than 𝜌𝐷
hospitalized and fatalities cases is shown as dot–dashed lines in Fig. 3. In that case, the number of
fatalities asymptotically approaches the value of about 9.2104. Last, the third scenario is the one
̅.
where 𝜌𝐷 reduces, in the same time range, after the 245th day, to a value 2.36 times larger than 𝜌𝐷
In this scenario (continuous lines in Fig. 3) the number of fatalities approach to a level close to
1.7105. The new measures adopted from Italy on October the 25th, 2020, introduced light
limitation of the people mobility compare to the total lockdown last March. These measures were
subsequently strengthened (November the 5th, and the 15th, 2020), only to a Regional level,
depending on the local severity of the outbreak diffusion. To date (November the 15th, 2020), only
seven Regions out of twenty have reintroduced measures comparable to the full lockdown that has
been implemented on March 2020. Although the proposed model does not allow us to follow the
spread of infection at a local level, the time evolution of the data on hospitalized and fatalities cases
(Fig. 3) is well represented by the third scenario we have discussed, thus indicating the necessity to
extend lockdown–like measures to further Regions.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have shown that the spread of COVID–19 can be described by a mean–field
diffusion like model. The model successfully reproduces the experimental data on hospitalized and
fatalities cases in Italy and allows us to get the time dependence of the diffusion coefficient that
influences the dynamics of the outbreak. In particular, the model was successfully used to simulate

8

three different scenarios consequent to the last restriction measures (October the 25th, 2020) of the
people mobility in Italy, giving a clear indication of the future trend of the outbreak propagation.
