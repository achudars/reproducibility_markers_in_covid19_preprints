Abstract
The bicycle is a low-cost means of transport linked to low risk of COVID-19 transmission. Governments have incentivised cycling by redistributing street space as part
of their post-lockdown strategies. We evaluated the impact of provisional bicycle infrastructure on cycling traffic in European cities using a generalised difference-in-differences
design. We scraped daily bicycle counts spanning over a decade from 736 bicycle counters in 106 European cities. We combined this with data on announced and completed
pop-up bike lane road work projects. On average 11.5 kilometres of provisional pop-up
bike lanes have been built per city. Each kilometre has increased cycling in a city by 0.6%.
We calculate that the new infrastructure will generate $2.3 billion in health benefits per
year, if cycling habits are sticky.

Introduction

As social and economic activity resume after a period of social distancing to curb COVID19, policy-makers are seeking mitigation measures with favourable cost-benefit ratios that
can be implemented in the short-run. While overall mobility is almost back to pre-crisis levels in many European countries, the use of public transport is still lagging behind1 . Early
evidence points to shifts from public transport to car use as users react to the pandemic2 .
Governments have started incentivising cycling as a low-cost, sustainable, equitable, and
space-saving mode of transport that reduces the risk of COVID-19 transmission. A key
measure has been the redistribution of street space in cities to create provisional bike infrastructure often provisionally marked and protected by materials readily available from
road construction companies. As of 8 July 2020, 2000 kilometres of these infrastructure
changes had been announced3 .
In Europe, typically more than 50% of overall trips measured in transport surveys are
shorter than 5 kilometres4 . In 2019, 3 million electric bicycles were sold in the EU5 likely
making cycling more demographically diverse and increasing the distances travelled6 . This
speaks to an important short-term potential for shifts in transport mode choice that could
reduce crowds in public transport and help avoid traffic congestion in response to increased
car use out of fears of infection.

Mode choices are subject to behavioural effects, such as status quo bias, default effects, and
time-inconsistent preferences7 . This complicates the task of policy-makers to encourage
people to cycle, particularly in the short-run. However, major disruptions to public transport, such as strikes, cause people to reconsider their habits8 . Furthermore, highly visible,
large-scale expansions in the provision of bicycle amenities, such as bike sharing9 or a citywide network of 120 kilometres of separated bike lanes built within four years in Sevilla10 ,
have increased cycling and reduced congestion9 .
Here, we provide causal estimates of the effect of the post-COVID-19-lockdown roll-out
of provisional (“pop-up”) bike lanes in European cities. We compile new data on daily
bike counts in 110 cities. We connect to the open data application programming interfaces
(APIs) of these cities to download bike counts from a total of 736 counters spanning over
a decade. We combine this data with information on day-to-day changes in the number
of kilometres of pop-up bike lanes, which is collected by the European Cyclists’ Federation
based on official documents and media reports.3 Our sample consists of large and mediumsized cities in 20 European countries.

Methods Summary

We estimate a Poisson regression model at the counter level with daily counts of cyclists as
the outcome variable and the number of kilometres of pop-up bike lanes in service in a city
on a given day as the treatment.
Since the roll-out of pop-up bike lanes is not a controlled experiment, our main empirical
concern is that both the implementation of bike lanes and bicycle counts are driven by a
third factor that cannot be measured (omitted variable bias). We may also worry that bike
lanes are built as a reaction to increased cycling traffic (reverse causality). We address these
concerns using quasi-experimental variation in the roll-out of pop-up bike lanes in different
European cities.
Planning for provisional cycling infrastructure in Europe has started early in the pandemic
as a reaction to civil society pressure after announcements by the City of Bogota on 16
and 17 March to create 76 km of provisional bike lanes that was widely reported in the
international media. Similar plans were assembled in several European cities and the rollout of these plans has started during lock downs as a means to allow necessary travel under
high safety standards particularly for “key workers” (see Fig. 1).
Officials have stated in interviews and personal conversations, that the geographic placement of pop-up bike lanes has mainly been driven by the availability of street space that
can be redistributed without restricting car traffic to only one direction and the existence
of “shovel-ready” construction plans. The exact timing of pop-up bike lane construction is
driven by administrative idiosyncrasies and the availability and schedules of construction
firms. Therefore, we argue that the timing of the roll-out of pop-up bike lanes has been as
good as random.
Our regression analysis is based on comparisons between treatment and control groups before and after treatment around each cohort of new bike lanes (differences-in-differences).
We use a set of indicator variables (fixed effects) that remove variation from our estimation sample that could be biasing our estimates. Our study design allows for systematic
differences in the level of bike traffic between treatment and control group, but relies on
a common trends assumption, that bike traffic in treated and control cities would have

Fig. 1. Intensity of pop-up bike lane treatment over time This Figure shows treated cities and their treatment intensities in
implemented kilometres of public bike lanes at a given day between March and July 2020. Control cities are not plotted but
are included in Fig. S1 (see Supplementary Materials). London, Milan, Rome, and Lisbon are missing from the sample due to
a lack of daily bicycle counter data. Bars that do not cover the whole study period to July 8 2020 indicate missing bicycle
count data for the most recent dates due to updating time lags of the counter APIs. Information on individual pop-up bike
lanes with their street location, announcement date, and implementation date is from the European Cyclists’ Federation. The
newest data can be found at: https://ecf.com/dashboard

evolved on a parallel trend in the absence of treatment. Since we cannot observe treated
units in their untreated state after treatment (potential outcome), we cannot test the common trends assumption formally. However, we can investigate pre-treatment trends and
check the sensitivity of our estimates to changes in the control group definition.
As a baseline our difference-in-differences model includes fixed effects at the unit (counter)
and time (day) level. We thereby control for time-invariant factors at the level of each
counter and city, such as public transport and population density, topography, and preferences for green lifestyles. With our counter fixed effect we also rule out that our effect is
driven by new counters that get placed next to provisional bike lanes. The day fixed effect
removes trends from the treatment and outcome variation that are common to the whole
sample. These could be overall trends in cycling, seasonality, and the overall evolution of
the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe. Fixed effects at the country-day level remove variation
in cycling infrastructure and behaviour that is driven by state- or national-level COVID-19
policies.
For potentially biasing factors that vary at the city-level over time, such as local mobility
or weather, we cannot include fixed effects since this is the geographical level at which
our treatment is measured. We therefore include control variables in our regressions that
measure overall changes in mobility at the state-level. This variable is based on the aggregated movements of Facebook users. This is to rule out that our effect is driven by local
authorities reacting to increased traffic volumes. We also control for local temperatures,
sunshine, wind and precipitation. Weather could for instance create bias, when construc-

3

tion firms decide to create new bike lanes in weeks with good weather that will also have
more cycling.

Results

We compare bike traffic in treated cities in the days before and after they get treated compared to control cities and find that one kilometre of popup bike lane increases cycling by
0.6% (see right one of coefficients marked in blue in Fig. 2). When we multiply this estimate
for a kilometre of bike lane with the average number of kilometres (11.5), we find that the

% change per km bikelane

average effect of bike lane programs is a 7% increase in city-wide cycling.

Fig. 2. Effect of pop-up bike lanes on cycling in different model specifications This figure shows estimates of regressions of
the daily cyclist count on the number of kilometres of pop-up bike lane implemented at a given day in a city. The unit of
observation is the bike counter. Baseline specifications are marked in blue. Darker colours in the bottom panel indicate the
type of specification used. The 95% confidence interval is shown in darker colour and the 90% confidence interval in lighter
colour. One estimate is from an OLS specification and uses the natural logarithm of the bicycle count as the outcome. All
other specifications are Poisson regressions. The estimates can be interpreted as the average increase in the level of cycling
caused by one kilometre of pop-up bike lane. Control variables are from Facebook (mobility index measured by user
movements) and the ERA5 climate model (weather variables). The variable Number of counters indicates the total of counters
per city.

The bike count data spans over a decade. We can compare changes in cycling in the weeks
after the introduction of pop-up bike lanes with the same calendar weeks in previous years.
Fig. 2 shows a regression estimate based on this comparison (see left one of coefficients
highlighted in blue). Comparisons between weeks in 2020 and weeks in previous years
may be biased by differential trends between treatment and control group. Fig. 3 shows
the estimated difference between treatment and control group in the 12 months before and
3 months after the begin of the pop-up bike lane roll-out in March. The baseline category in
this event study specification is −13. This means that all estimated coefficients for months
before and after treatment are relative to February 2019.

Months relative to begin of pop-up rollout

Fig. 3. Treatment effect in months before and after beginning of pop-up bike lane treatment This figure shows the treatment
effect of treated cities compared to untreated cities. Observations are binned into months before and after treatment. The
treatment is hard-coded to March 2020. The baseline category and the begin of the sample is February 2019. Estimates are
from Poisson regressions that include city and country-day fixed effects. The shaded area shows the 95% confidence interval.

We can see that a treatment effect becomes only apparent after the treatment sets in. Before,
treatment and control group have been on the same trend. There is a slight but statistically
insignificant downward trend before treatment (Ashenfelter’s dip11 ), hinting at the possibility of stronger mobility reductions due to COVID-19 in cities that have decided to build
pop-up bike lanes. This could be the case because local and national governments are
more likely to take wide-ranging action, if their country is hit by a more intense outbreak.
It could also be due to governments acting upon idiosyncratic risk-aversion of their populations towards cycling in the context of emptier roads and increased speeding during the
lockdown. We rule out that these potential selection into treatment effects are driving our
results by controlling for COVID-19 related dynamics with fixed effects and a variable that
captures human mobility at the sub-national level based on Facebook user movements.
The treatment effect magnitude in Fig. 3 is higher than our baseline estimate. This difference stems from hard-coding the treatment in March 2020 and therefore discarding
variation in treatment timing at the day and week levels. This creates a more standard
difference-in-difference setting, that avoids the issue of already treated cities acting as controls for later cohorts, while they are still on a different trend because of prior treatment12 .
Therefore our main estimates tend to be attenuated compared to the setup shown in Fig. 3.
We check the sensitivity of our results to reshaping our regression-based treatment and
control group comparisons. Fig. 2 shows fairly stable estimates for comparisons between
(i) treated and untreated cities, (ii) cities that are already treated and those that have only
announced pop-up bike lanes, (iii) between treated cities only using their variation in treatment dose (km of bike lane built) and treatment timing or (iv) treatment timing only (event
study).
Estimates based on days before and after treatment within the same week have higher
magnitudes when country-day fixed effects are excluded from the model. This suggests
that within a narrow time window around treatment, national policy events and cycling
behaviour are correlated. Estimates that either include country-day fixed effects or use
longer pre- and post-treatment windows (no city-week fixed effect or city-calendar week
fixed effect only) mitigate this bias.

Discussion

We find robust evidence for substantial short-run increases in cycling in European cities
due to new provisional cycling infrastructure. An average pop-up bike lane program

5

has led to a 7% increase in city-wide cycling. The effects of this cycling infrastructure on
COVID-19 transmission should be investigated with high-resolution case data for a large
enough number of cities.
Independent of its impacts on COVID-19 transmission, the net benefits of the intervention
are likely to be large. The direct cost of cycling infrastructure including planning is low.
For the Sevilla network one kilometre of bike lane cost A
C25000010 . Iterative planning with
provisional infrastructure reduces costs further. In Berlin, one kilometre of pop-up bike
lane has so far cost A
C950013 . Previous research has found that every kilometre of cycling
generates health benefits of $0.4514 . We calculate baseline values for total cycling in a city
based on data on daily kilometres cycled in German cities in 2018 and extrapolate these
numbers to the rest of our sample based on city-level data on modal splits and population
(see Supplementary Material). We calculate that the additional cycling caused by the popup bike lane treatment during its first three months of operation has generated at least $580
million in health benefits1 . The new infrastructure will generate $2.3 billion per year in
health benefits, if the new bike lanes become permanent and if cycling habits are sticky.
The magnitude of our estimate is large compared to previous evaluations of cycling infrastructure improvements that have found statistically unclear or modest effects, typically
because of the limited scale of the interventions15–17 . Further research could investigate the
non-linearities in cycling adoption in terms of scale and timing of an infrastructure rollout. It remains to be evaluated, if cycling behaviour is sticky and how similar treatments
influence behaviour outside of the pandemic environment.
Research based on surveys indicates that separated, protected infrastructure is a key element to incentivise up-take of cycling18,19 . Cities have experimented with a range of measures to create new spaces for cycling, ranging from painted to provisionally protected bike
lanes and from traffic calming with signs to built “modal filters” that only let bicycles and
pedestrians pass. In our data, we do not see which share of increased bike counts is from
new cyclists and which is from existing cyclists, who decide to cycle more often or farther.
Large representative individual level samples, for instance based on transport mode detection by smartphone sensors, may help to investigate changes in modal split at a sufficiently
high geographical resolution. GPS traces of individual trips could also help understand,
how new infrastructure changes the route choices of cyclists20 and to measure the willingness to take detours for better infrastructure in terms of value of time.

Supplementary Material
Materials and Methods
Bicycle count data We assemble a new data set of daily bicycle counts from municipal
bicycle counters. We connect to national and municipal open data portals for bike counter
data sets and connect directly to the API of those cities that use the Eco-Counter standard
(see . We also obtain longer time series of bike counts going back to 2012 directly from the
Mayor’s staff for road planning and data in Paris.
Our raw data set contains roughly a million daily counts starting in 2007. We drop the
lower and upper percentiles from this raw sample since counters can record very low values, when they are not functioning properly or very high values, when there is a cycling
event that drives up counts. We drop the counter 100041252 from Bergen that varies between very low values and some of the highest daily counts in the sample. Our results
are robust to keeping these extreme values in the sample. The bulk of the bike counts are
from most recent years (see Table S1) and we focus most of the comparisons made in our
regressions on the years 2019 and 2020. Figures S3 and S4. show the variation in weekly
average bike counts for cities in our study sample. Fig. S3. shows treated cities and Fig.
S4. control cities. For certain cities, such as Paris and Berlin the raw data already indicates
that increase in peak in June 2020 compared to June 2019. Many of the control cities show
a similar pattern. Our regression analyses find a robust effect of new infrastructures, both
when taking the difference in these differences between treatment and control cities, but
also when focusing on variation in treatment timing exclusively.
Table S1 shows summary statistics for the main variables included in our analysis. The
unit of observation in our analyses is the bike counter and counts vary daily. An average
counter detects 1457 cyclists per day. The average number of counters per city is 22.9. The
average size of cities in our sample is 33000 ha. European cities tend to be denser than
American cities. Thus, our study areas can be thought of small commuting zones rather
than city cores.
Pop-up infrastructure data We use project-level data on provisional infrastructure in European cities as a reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic collected by the European Cyclists’
Federation1 . In the data we see the street, where the project is implemented, its size measured in kilometres, the date of announcement, and the date of implementation. The data
also contains the type of project. 80% are categorised as bike lanes and 16% as traffic calming. Our data includes all projects recorded until 8 July 2020. We aggregate this data at
the city-day level to construct a variable of daily implemented kilometres of pop-up bike
lane. We use the city definition and corresponding polygons from the European Urban
Audit 20202 . Typically areas defined by the European Urban Audit include suburbs. For
instance, the Paris polygon includes many areas beyond the ring highway that surrounds
the municipality of Paris ("Ville de Paris"). This allows us to capture commuting enabled
by new bike lanes from the suburbs into the city centre, which make up an important share
of projects (see Fig. S1). However, this also means that for infrastructure projects, which are
concentrated in one part of a city, such as in Berlin’s district of Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg,
we tend to underestimate the effect.
Our estimation sample contains 22 treated cities and 84 control cities, both of which some
are dropped from our Poisson regressions depending on the specification because of a lack

9

of variation after removing fixed effects or because we do not have observations for our
control variables. Fig. S2. shows the 20 treatment cities, for which the size of pop-up
infrastructure projects has been recorded in kilometre. We can see that Dublin and Berlin
have been the earliest adopters of pop-up bike lanes in the sample and Paris has been
the city with the largest program. We use this variation in both timing and the extent
of the implemented infrastructure to estimate our effects. We also include control cities
in the chart to illustrate the distribution of control cities across European countries. We
have a large sample from both France and Germany. This allows us to estimate our effect
based on within-country variation removing time-varying factors related to the pandemic
that could create bias in our estimates. Note that, while important cities such as London,
Milan, Lisbon and Rome had either announced or already implemented a pop-up bike lane
program at the time of the analysis, they are missing from the sample due to insufficient
spatial or temporal coverage of the bike count data. The average length by city of all bike
infrastructures in our sample combined is 11.5 kilometres, the length of bike lanes is 8.2
and the number of measures implemented 19.8.
We check the sensitivity of our results to different specifications of the treatment, for instance as an indicator variable that is 1, if there is any cycling related infrastructure change
in a city and 0 otherwise. The average effect of having any pop-up infrastructure treatment
in a city is 6% (column 4 in Table S3). The effect per individual measure taken by cities is
0.4% (column 3). Our findings are robust, when we define treatment based exclusively on
those projects that are clearly marked as bike lanes in the data (column 2) rather than based
on all types of cycling and traffic calming measures combined (column 1).
Mobility and weather controls Our identification strategy relies on the use of different
control groups that we expect to be on a common trend around individual daily cohorts of
pop-up infrastructure projects. As a baseline we remove and therefore control for timeinvariant differences between cities and the locations of the individual counters in our
data. Therefore any additional time-invariant control variables would be redundant in
our analysis. We also use fixed effect interacting different spatial levels with time dimensions, thereby controlling for many time-varying factors. We use additional data that varies
at a high spatial and temporal resolution to rule out any bias that may be introduced by
time-varying factors below our fixed effect levels.
We use weather data from the ERA5 climate model, that provides hourly reanalysis measures of surface temperature, UV radiation, precipitation and wind at a 0.25◦ × 0.25◦ resolution3 . We use the ecwmfr package4 to aggregate this to the EU Urban Audit city polygons
at the daily level. We capture average human mobility throughout the phase of the COVID19 pandemic starting in March with a human mobility index based on Facebook data5 . The
index is from a data set called "movement range maps" that Facebook shares after aggregating individual user movements for humanitarian and research purposes with a reference
to the principles outlined by epidemiologists and public health researchers6 . It measures
the number of daily 600 meter grid cells visited by Facebook users compared to a baseline
in February. For most of our sample the index is aggregated to the state-level, where we
use the data. Table S1 shows that on average in our sample period daily mobility has been
below the February baseline.
Regression model

We model the relationship between cycling traffic and the pop-up bike

lane treatment as:
10

log Bike Counticd = β 1 Bike Lane (km)cd + Xid + λi + σcw + ϕnd + ε id

(1)

where i indexes a counter, c indexes a city, n indexes a country, d indexes a day, and w
indexes as week.
λi is a counter fixed effect that controls for time invariant factors at a high spatial resolution.
σcw is a city-week fixed effect that controls for week-specific time-varying factors effectively
restricting identifying variation to days before and after treatment within the same week in
the same city. ϕnd is a country-day fixed effect that captures any daily changes common to
all cities in a country.
The coefficient of interest is β 1 . It captures the effect of the pop-up bike lane treatment on
average bicycle counts in a city. Our baseline treatment variable is defined as the number
of kilometre of pop-up bike lanes implemented on a given day. Multiplied by a 100 the
estimate can be interpreted as the change in bicycle count for a unit change in the treatment
variable.
Xid is a vector of control variables including the mobility index based on Facebook data,
weather variables (temperature, UV radiation, wind, precipitation) and the number of
counters per city.
We use Poisson pseudo-maximum likelihood regressions (PPML) to estimate this model7 .
As a robustness check we also use ordinary least squares (OLS) with the natural logarithm
of the bicycle count as the outcome (see Fig. 1). We cluster standard errors at the city-level,
where treatment is assigned8 .
Calculating the health benefits of the policy We calculate the health benefits by combining our estimates of cycling increases for each kilometre of pop-up bike lane with an
estimate of the average health benefits of a kilometre cycled ($0.45 converted from 0.62
Australian Dollars)9 , which is lower than typical values from the grey literature9 . Our
regression estimates only provide us with a percentage increase in cycling (0.6%) per kilometre of bike lane. We convert this result into additional kilometres cycled in a city based
on baseline values of kilometres cycled per person in a city from a detailed transport behaviour survey in 135 German cities10 . We impute values of kilometres cycled for other
European cities based on information on the modal split (trips) of commutes11 and a city’s
population both taken from the European Urban Audit12 .
Our estimate only counts benefits from cycling but not the saved costs of a potential modal
shift from car use to cycling, that we cannot measure with our data. It also does not take
into account shifts from walking or jogging and cycling for exercise to cycling in the city,
where counters in our sample are typically placed. Since the external costs of car use are
high13 , we interpret our calculation as a lower bound.

Table S1. Summary statistics at the counter-day level The unit of observation of our analysis is the counter and data varies
daily. Count data is from municipal bike counters and is obtained from different APIs. Treatment and control variables are
assigned to counters based on their city attribute. City definitions are from the EU Urban Audit. The Facebook mobility
index is only available from March 2020. It measures aggregate movement activity by Facebook users in a given
administrative area (districts or states).

Table S2. Summary statistics of most recent state of infrastructure at the city level show We use data from the European
Cyclists’ Federation. The raw data includes information on individual infrastructure projects announced or implemented.
We aggregate it to the city-day level using city definitions from the EU Urban Audit. Our analysis includes data up to the 8
July 2020. The newest data can be found at:

Table S3. Different treatment specifications Each column shows the effect of treatment with pop-up infrastructure on a city’s
cycling count compiled from city APIs. The data on daily pop-up bike lane additions are from the European Cyclists’
Federation1 . The unit of observation is the cycling counter. Time variation is daily. Coefficients are from Poisson regressions.
Column (1) shows the effect of a kilometre of any bike infrastructure, (2) shows the effect of bike lanes, (3) the effect of any
single measure in a city, and (4) the overall treatment of an implemented pop-up infrastructure program in a city. All
regressions include counter and day fixed effects and controls for overall mobility (measured with Facebook user
movements), weather (temperature, wind, sunshine, precipitation), and the number of counters in a city. We cluster standard
errors at the city level, where treatment is assigned. Significance levels are ∗ p < 0.1, ∗∗ p < 0.05, ∗∗∗ p < 0.01.

Fig. S1. Pop-up bike lanes and bicycle counters in Paris The map shows pop-up bike lanes implemented in Paris up to 3 July
2020 (green lines) and the location of bike counters (dots) in our data set. The detailed infrastructure data has been collected
by a consortium of French NGOs and researchers. It is available at:

Fig. S2. Intensity of pop-up bike lane treatment over time in treatment cities and control cities This Figure shows treated
cities and their treatment intensities in implemented kilometres (colouring on a log scale) of public bike lanes at a given day
between March and July 2020. Control cities are plotted in white. London, Milan, Lisbon and Rome are missing from the
sample due to insufficient spatial or temporal coverage of the data. Information on individual pop-up bike lanes with their
street location, announcement implementation is from the European Cyclists’ Federation. The newest data can be found at:
