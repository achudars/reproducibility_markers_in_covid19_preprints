Abstract
Recently in various theoretical works, path-breaking progress has been made in recovering the well-known Page Curve of an evaporating black hole with Quantum Extremal
Islands, proposed to solve the long-standing black hole information loss problem related
to the unitarity issue. Motivated by this concept, in this paper, we study cosmological circuit complexity in the presence (or absence) of Quantum Extremal Islands in negative (or
positive) Cosmological Constant with radiation in the background of Friedmann-LemaîtreRobertson-Walker (FLRW) space-time i.e the presence and absence of islands in anti de
Sitter and the de Sitter spacetime having SO(2, 3) and SO(1, 4) isometries respectively.
Without using any explicit details of any gravity model, we study the behaviour of the circuit complexity function with respect to the dynamical cosmological solution for the scale
factors for the above mentioned two situations in FLRW space-time using squeezed state
formalism. By studying the cosmological circuit complexity, Out-of-Time Ordered Correlators, and entanglement entropy of the modes of the squeezed state, in different parameter
space, we conclude the non-universality of these measures. Their remarkably different features in the different parameter space suggests their dependence on the parameters of the
model under consideration.

Prologue

In recent times, various outstanding quantum information theory concepts have been
extensively used to decode the enormous number of hidden secrets of a quantum theory
of gravity. Among all of these well known successful tools and techniques, in this paper,
we mainly concentrate on the underlying physics of circuit complexity [1]. The notion
of circuit complexity was first introduced in physics by Professor Leonard Susskind to
understand the mysteries of quantum aspects of black holes. It has been an important
and very successful probe in diagnosing certain interesting features underlying the system.
Before going into the details of this paper’s subject material, let us familiarize the readers
with the bigger picture to develop the strong background motivation of this paper.
The concept of quantum extremal islands [2, 3] has been a very successful theoretical
concept in reproducing the Page Curve for an evaporating black hole [4] from semi-classical
considerations, which has been recently studied in various remarkable works [2, 5–8]. This
program came into the picture to propose a possible solution to the long-standing famous Hawking Information Loss paradox [9–11]; related to the preserving unitarity in
evaporating black holes. A better understanding of Von-Neumann entropy was needed to
understand Hawking radiation. As a result, the idea of page curve remained incomplete
and led to many contradicting views. It was found that the consistent way of computing
the entropy involved an area of a surface that is not the horizon. It is the surface that
extremizes the generalized entropy, and hence the name arises Quantum Extremal Surface
(QES) in the associated literature. In refs. [2, 5, 6, 12], the authors explicitly showed that
using QES, one can systematically start from a pure quantum state black hole. During
the entire process of evaporation, a consistent definition of the fine-grained entropy can be
given. The curve displayed by this entropy shows that the expected Page curve is devoid
of any contradictions. Hence, the entropy computed, including QES was consistent with
the unitary evolution as expected from quantum mechanics. To successfully describe the
process, we need to add a bulk region in the QES after the Page transition time, which
aids in reproducing the Page curve. These bulk regions are known as Islands.
Over the years, many formulations for entanglement entropy came into the picture and
were applied in various cases [13–18]. However, the computation of this entanglement
entropy is not always very trivial. One can expect to find various underlying unexplored
features of entanglement entropy by studying complexity without going into the technical
details of computing the entanglement entropy from a given gravitational paradigm taking
motivation from Leonard Susskind’s path-breaking idea [19]. He explicitly showed the rate
of change of complexity [20–22] is equal to the product of entropy and the equilibrium
saturation temperature [19] i.e dC/dt = ST . Thus, he established a connecting relation
between the circuit complexity and the entanglement entropy for black hole systems. How-

2

ever, this is a conjectured relation and it has not been explicitly proved. Hence one cannot
take this relation to be universal. Explicit check of the validity of this conjecture might
be a very useful prospect and a generalisation of this conjecture for a general gravitational
system might be reveal extremely interesting features of the considered system.
The notion of cosmological circuit complexity is intimately related with the Out-ofTime-Ordered Correlation (OTOC) functions [23–27] which is generally used as a probe
of quantum chaos [28].¶
Cosmological Island bound :

OTOC = exp(−c̄ exp(λa)) = exp(−C)

(1.1)

where the equality holds for the maximal chaos inside the Island-inspired bulk region in
the FLRW cosmological background. This relation is also extremely useful in the context
of condensed matter systems, where computing the OTOC’s is not always a trivial task.
Here the quantity, c̄ ∼ N −1/2 , where N represents the number of degrees of freedom. Additionally, it is important to note that, the Quantum Lyapunov Exponent, to describe the
quantum description of the chaotic phenomena has to satisfy the following constraint, commonly cited as the Maldacena Shenker Stanford (MSS) bound in the associated literature,
as given by [28] ‖ :
MSS bound :

λ≤

2π
= 2πT,
β

where β =

1
in ~ = 1, c = 1, kB = 1 .(1.4)
T

Here β represents the inverse equilibrium temperature of the chaotic system during
saturation of the OTOC at a large evolutionary scale. In this connection, here, it is
essential to note that recently in ref. [29], Tom Hartman and co-authors investigated
the Cosmological Islands and the conditions for them to appear in gravitational curved
spacetime without singularities. They showed that islands appear in the four-dimensional
¶

This relationship between OTOC and Complexity in presence of Quantum Extremal Islands within
the framework of FLRW Cosmology, particularly for the two solutions for the scale factors may not be
universal.

In the context of FLRW cosmology by utilizing the fact that, the Quantum Lyapunov Exponent can
be computed from the scale factor dependence of the Cosmological Complexity i.e.
λ=

one can give a Cosmological extended version of the MSS bound, which is given by:

FLRW cosmology with radiation and negative cosmological constant(cc). In contrast, in
the positive cosmological constant case, islands are absent in the bulk region. We take
a leaf from this paper, and using the connection between complexity and OTOC as our
primary guiding principle; we reinvestigate these two particularly well-known cases from
the perspective of quantum chaos. We also study the behavior of these measures in two
different parameter spaces, to show the non-universality of these measures. In this paper,
we show that the complexity for four-dimensional FLRW with radiation and negative cc
(AdS case, with SO(2, 3) isometry) resembles Page curve behaviour which is absent for the
positive cc (dS case, with SO(1, 4) isometry). We also compute the entanglement entropy
in the language of squeezed parameters and study their evolution with the scale factor. The
purpose of using this squeezed state formalism is to translate the given problem entirely in
the language of a general quantum mechanical system. The squeezed state formalism also
provides an elegant and efficient way of computing the entanglement entropy particularly,
von-Neumann and Renyi entropy in terms of the squeezed state parameters. It also provides
a way to connect the entanglement entropy with the circuit complexity for the model under
consideration. Thus, though not exactly one will be able to develop an idea about how
the entanglement entropy of a particular system is related to the circuit complexity and
whether the conjectured relation proposed by Prof. Leonard Susskind holds true in that
particular case or not. We also observed that the complexity measure and the OTOC’s
are parameter dependent quantities and have widely different behavior in different regions
of parameter space.
The present computation of circuit complexity, entanglement entropy, the four-point
OTOCs, and many physical observables and quantities can be computed by following
the standard techniques of Quantum Field Theory of curved space-time for a general
gravitational metric, [30–33], other than the situation where one tries to understand the
black hole geometry with and without quantum extremal islands in presence of timeevolving FLRW metric. Even in the global and planar coordinates (inflationary patch) of
De Sitter space, one can compute a quantum effective action or a partition function by
following semiclassical approach, where gravity is taken to be classical and fields which are
embedded in the gravity are taken to be quantum, if due to some additional physical criteria
or speciality in the physical set up, anisotropy and inhomogeneity are introduced from the
starting point [30–38]. But once we talk about pure FLRW space-time from the starting
point, things are not as simple as mentioned above. Once a field is embedded in the FLRW
geometrical background (in presence or absence of islands), then due to the homogeneity
and isotropy property of the FLRW metric, fields are considered to be only time-dependent,
provided no influence of additional physics is considered here. Most importantly this is
not an assumption. Now, as we are interested in the quantum fluctuations of the fields
rather than the background embedded field, one usually introduces the inhomogeneity and
anisotropy in the metric as well as in the field in such a way that the underlying setup and
physical outcomes do not get effected due to this. In this construction, the metric and the

4

field after introducing the anisotropy and inhomogeneity can be written as:
gµν (x, τ ) = ḡµν (τ ) + δgµν (x, τ ),

(1.5)

φ(x, τ ) = φ̄(τ ) + δφµν (x, τ ),

(1.6)

In the above equations in both cases, the first terms represents only the conformal time
τ ∗∗ dependent background metric and the fields respectively which preserve the mentioned
homogeneity and isotropy in the FLRW space-time. On the other hand, the second terms
in the above equations are the outcome of perturbations in the FLRW background which
capture the effects of inhomogeneity and anisotropy. Now as we don’t know how to treat
a full quantum theory of gravity and how to deal with the gravitational fluctuations at a
quantum level even for FLRW background geometry the usual approach is to treat them
classically. But since we know how to quantize the inhomogeneous perturbed field, we
treat it at the quantum level. So here once again we are using the semi-classical treatment to write down the Quantum Field Theory in FLRW space-time from the perturbed
contributions but it is implemented in a little bit different way to break the homogeneity
and isotropy, which a general gravitational background might not in principle always have.
Now having this setup one can either follow the semi-classical path integral approach by
writing down the partition function or the associated quantum effective action and can
compute the quantities that we evaluated in this paper within the context of time-evolving
black hole geometry describing quantum extremal islands in presence of radiation in FLRW
background. The other approach is to treat the problem by quantizing the Hamiltonian in
terms of creation and annihilation operators using the well-known canonical quantization
technique in an appropriate gravitational gauge. As we proceed further with the material
of this paper, one can clearly visualize that we also have chosen a preferred gravitational
gauge which helps us to directly connect the scalar part of the gravitational isotropy and
homogeneity breaking fluctuation with the field fluctuation. Consequently one can translate the Hamiltonian and its quantized version in terms of gauge-invariant perturbations,
which is commonly used in the context of perturbation theory in FLRW space-time or
commonly known as the cosmological perturbation theory [39–44]. Apart from using the
usual canonical quantization technique, in the present context of the discussion, we have
used the single field squeezed state formalism which helps us to think of the quantized
∗∗

Conformal time and physical times are related by the following expression:
Z
dt
τ=
.
a(t)

(1.7)

Once we substitute the explicit physical time-dependent scale factor a(t) in FLRW space-time then one can
explicitly compute the connecting relationship between the conformal time and physical time coordinates.
In the present context of the discussion, we are specifically interested in two special types of solutions of
the scale factor in FLRW geometric background which can able to capture the information of quantum
extremal islands along with having tradition with two different signatures of Cosmological Constants
(positive as well as negative)

5

Hamiltonian in terms of a mode having momentum k and other having momentum −k in
the Fourier space. Additionally, using this formalism the quantized version of the Hamiltonian of the problem written in the present set up can be parametrised in terms two
parameters, which quantifies the amplitude and phase of the two mode squeezed states.
In the corresponding literature it is identified as the squeezing amplitude rk (τ ) and the
squeezing angle φk (τ ). For the two given expressions for a scale factors a(τ ) describing
two different physical solutions of FLRW space-time describing the time evolving black
hole geometry it is possible to compute the conformal time evolutions of these two parameters. Once this is done the rest of the problem can be automatically solved as most of
the physical observables can be expressed in terms of these two time evolving parameters.
This approach that we have followed in this paper actually expresses a very complicated
underlying semi-classical computation from the Quantum Field Theoretic set up in a very
simplified language which helps us to extract all physical information from the computation. Not only this approach helps to simplify the complicated structure of the set up,
but also helps to compute and physically interpret many quantum-mechanical observables,
circuit complexity function, entanglement entropy of the black hole with/without having
an island, and last but not the least also helps us to predict the features of four-point
OTOC in a very simplest language.
The main motivations behind the current work are as follows:
• Motivation-I
Instead of using the semi-classical approach to write down the quantum effective
action of the theory, express the entire set-up in terms of single field two mode
squeezed state formalism [45, 46].
• Motivation-II
To understand signatures of quantum chaos in FRW spacetime in the presence and
absence of Cosmological islands by using the quantum information theoretic measure
known as circuit complexity. Circuit complexity which is much more computationally
easier compared to other probes gives much more information about the underlying
system.
• Motivation-III
To comment about another probe of quantum chaos, i.e OTOC’s without directly
computing it but by establishing a closed relation with the circuit complexity. Computing the OTOC’s in this set-up is not a trivial task and is much more challenging,
but it can be very easily predicted by computing the circuit complexity.
• Motivation-IV
To study the dependence of circuit complexity on the parameters of the theory
thereby establishing the fact that the behavior of circuit complexity is not universal throughout the entire regime of the parameter space. The behavior of circuit

6

complexity may not unique in the entire parameter space of the model under consideration. Thus, circuit complexity provides a way of probing the behavior of the
model in the entire regime of the parameter space.
• Motivation-V
To try to provide an alternative way of calculating entanglement entropy without
going into the gravitational details of the model but from the perspective of circuit
complexity which is much more easier to calculate. Circuit complexity also provides much more information than entanglement entropy, which in itself is a great
motivation for computing it for any gravitational or field theory model.
The organization of the rest of the paper is as follows:
• In Sec. 2, we provide a brief review of the long-standing Black hole information loss
problem and various proposals given till date to solve it, focussing mainly on the
Island proposal as our prime motivation to study the cosmological extension of this
concept.
• In Sec. 3, we introduce the concept of circuit complexity to the readers to motivate
them about this computational tool’s role in probing various unexplored theoretical
framework related to quantum chaos and information theory related issues.
• We then provide the useful cosmological FLRW models with radiation and AdS and
dS spacetime that we have considered in this paper to study chaos and complexity
in Sec. 4 of this paper.
• Following that in Sec. 5, we provide the analytical expressions of circuit complexity
calculated from two different cost functionals commonly used in the perspective of
cosmological perturbation theory written in the language of squeezed quantum states.
• In Sec. 6, We provide the expressions of the Von-Neumann entanglement entropy,
Renyi entropy, and equilibrium temperature of the modes in terms of the squeezed
state parameters.
• Sec. 7 contains our numerical calculation of the cosmological version of the circuit
complexity and estimation of quantities like the measure of quantum chaos, i.e.,
quantum Lyapunov exponent
• Finally, in Sec. 8, we conclude with our all findings in this paper with some interesting
future prospects of the present work.

A brief review on Islands Paradigm

Black holes are thought to hold the key for quantum aspects of the gravitational
paradigm. It has kept everyone puzzled ever since its appearance in Einstein’s theory
of General Relativity. One of the biggest conundrums in quantum mechanics of black hole
physics, for half a century or so, has been the problem of unitarity or, in other words,
the Black Hole Information loss problem. Over the years, many proposals have tried to
solve this problem viz. Black Hole Complementarity principle [47, 48], Fuzzball paradigm
[49–56], and Firewall paradigm [57, 58].
2.1

Pedagogical details

Figure 2.1: Schematic diagram showing the entropy of the outgoing radiation of the
evaporating black hole as a function of physical evolutionary time scale. This schematic
diagram was taken from [59].
In 2019, many renowned physicists came up with the path-breaking concept of tackling
the Black Hole information loss problem by introducing Islands [2, 3, 5, 6, 60–65]. They
proposed that the contribution to the black hole entropy came not only from inside the

8

horizon (bulk) region but also from the outside horizon region of the evaporating black hole.
Considering the generalized quantum entanglement entropy that includes the contribution
from outside the black hole, the unitarity issue can be solved perfectly and consequently;
the black hole information loss paradox can be resolved.
It is important to mention here that, without the inclusion of the Island, the associated
entropy of the Hawking radiation increases monotonically with respect to the evolutionary
time scale. On the other hand, quantum mechanics demands that the final state of a black
hole should be a pure state, and the entanglement entropy should go to zero after a long
time. The Island proposal provides a quantum correction in the result for the Bekenstein
Hawking entropy, for an evaporating black hole. By considering the existence of the Island
region, it has been shown that after the Page time, the Island corrected entropy starts
to decrease to reach zero after a long time, which means there is no entanglement at the
very late time. Hence, the fundamental notion of unitarity of the black hole information
is restored, as shown in figure 2.1.

2.2

Technical details

Island formula generalizes the well known Ryu-Takayanagi formula used to quantify
the holographic entanglement entropy [13–18, 66–68]. Let us consider, R to be a nongravitational system which is entangled with a gravitational system. Then von Neumann
entropy of the region R is given by the following Island formula:
Island formula :

S(R) = min extI Sgen (I ∪ R) ,

(2.1)

where the generalized entropy is given by the following expression †† :

Generalized entropy :

Sgen (I ∪ R) =

Area(∂I)
+ Sm (I ∪ R) − Sdiv (∂I) . (2.2)
4

Here I is the region in the gravitational system known as Island, Sm (I ∪ R) is the
von Neumann entropy of the region (I ∪ R) and Sdiv (∂I) is the UV divergent entropy of
boundary of I i.e. ∂I. Region I is entangled with region R i.e. degrees of freedom of I
are encoded in R. It means that the operators in I can be rewritten as operators in R no
matter how complicated the form is.
Initial work on the Island prescription was done in the context of two dimensional
††

Here in the first term, we have fixed GN = 1 and ~ = 1 in the natural unit system.

defined by the following expressions:

(2.5)

Action given in eqn 2.3 is an example of modified measure theory as discussed in refs
[77, 78]. Recently in refs. [79, 80], the authors has shown the existence of Islands in higher
dimensional space-time as well. Further in refs. [81–83], Professor Robert C. Myers and
co. also have studied quantum extremal Islands in arbitrary space-time dimensions. Such
Islands can exist even without the presence of black holes. In this D + 1 dimensional
space-time the representative Island action can be written as:
Action in D + 1 :

1
S=
2

Z


√
dD+1 x −g φ R + K(φ)(∂φ)2 − 2V (φ)

.

(2.6)

In this paper, we consider 3+1 dimensional spacetime model to study the circuit complexity
in FLRW Islands to have realistic cosmological implications since our observed universe
is 3 + 1 dimensional. Recently, Hartman and collaborators in ref. [29] has studied the
presence of such Islands in 3 + 1 dimensional FLRW space-time.
In 3 + 1 dimensional FLRW cosmological space-time the representative Island action
can be expressed as:
Action in 3 + 1 D (Jordan) :

1
SJ =

Z


dτ d3 x a4 (τ ) φ R + K(φ)(∂φ)2 − 2V (φ)

(2.7)
Now, to extract the underlying the physical insight from the above mentioned model, we
need to perform conformal transformation on the above mentioned action. This allows us
to express the Island action written in Jordan frame to the Einstein frame, which is given

10

by:

(2.9)

where we have throughout used the following conformal transformation in the metric:
Einstein to Jordan frame :

g̃µν = Ω2 (φ) gµν

where Ω2 (φ) := φ

. (2.10)

The above mentioned transformed action is in perfect form to analyse the cosmological
perturbation theory, as it is representing the simple Einstein gravity minimally coupled
to a canonical scalar field in the Einstein frame. This will further help us to study the
cosmological imprints from the above mentioned Island action expressed in FLRW spatially
flat (k = 0) background space-time. To avoid any confusion here it is important to note
that, for further computational purpose we will drop the ˜ symbol from our analysis which
actually distinguish the Einstein and Jordan frame explicitly.
The conditions for such Islands to appear in any gravitational spacetime and quantum
state are already discussed in greater detail in [29]. Below we summarize the conditions.
• Condition I :
Bekenstein area bound for entropy must be violated in the following way within
the Island prescription:
S̃m ≥

Area(∂I)
4

,

(2.11)

Here S̃m is the finite matter entropy after subtracting the UV divergences appearing
at the boundary.
• Condition II :
The region I can be treated as the quantum normal if the following criteria holds
good for the generalized entropy:

11

±

d
Sgen (I) ≥ 0
dλ±

,

(2.12)

d
is the null derivative (+ for outward, − for inward) with respect to Island
dλ±
region I.

where

• Condition III :
The region G can be treated as the quantum normal if the following criteria holds
good for the generalized entropy:

∓

d
Sgen (G) ≤ 0
dλ±

,

(2.13)

d
is the null derivative (+ for outward, − for inward) with respect to Island
dλ±
region I.

where

Usually, calculating entanglement entropy is not a very easy task. We want to bypass this cumbersome task in a comparatively easy way by considering the use of circuit
complexity within the framework of FLRW Cosmology. We do not do any computation
from the gravitational theories to calculate the entanglement entropy in the presence of
quantum extremal Islands. Instead of doing a complicated computation, we consider the
FLRW metric with radiation along with the negative (AdS) and positive (dS) signature
of the Cosmological Constant as our initial ingredient for the present computational purpose. To understand the effects of quantum mechanics, we must perturb the usual classical
FLRW metric in 3 + 1 dimensional spacetime, out of which we will consider only the scalar
modes in this paper. In this paper, we study cosmological circuit complexity from squeezed
state formalism for both positive (dS) and negative (AdS) cosmological constant with radiation and re-examine the Island paradigm in both cases from a cosmology-complexity
connecting point of view. We will explicitly show that cosmological circuit complexity for
the AdS case will be precisely consistent with the Island paradigm, which can produce the
Page curve and resolve the well known black hole information loss paradox without exactly
computing any gravitational entropy.

Circuit Complexity and its purposes

12

Complexity as a measure was first suggested by Susskind et al. [84, 85] and a series of
other papers to explain the increasing size of an ER bridge inside an eternal black hole
that connects two copies of the dual CFT. To describe the interior, we need a measure
of information that evolves for much longer times after the boundary CFT has reached
thermal equilibrium [84, 86]. One can think of complexity as the information about the
processes in a system. A system with more processes (thermodynamic, mechanical or energy dissipation) can be considered to be of higher complexity than a system with lesser
processes happening. A definition of circuit complexity can then be extended as the minimum number of processes that follow a path along a circuit between a reference state and
a target state. In the language of quantum mechanics, we can look at processes as unitary
gates and the reference and target quantum mechanical states can be chosen based on our
model. In [87] Nielsen had shown the minimization of unitary gates of a circuit between
reference and target state is the minimization of geodesic length in circuit space. One can
start with a simple evolution of a reference state into the target state with some unitary
transformation U .
Target state from initial reference state :

|ΨT i = U |ΨR i ,

(3.1)

where the representative unitary operation for the circuit complexity can be represented
by n consecutive operations, as given by:

Unitary operator :

U=

Y

giα .

(3.2)

α=1

There is no unique choice in determining the circuit. We can work directly with the
wavefunctions [88] using Nielsen’s geometric approach, or we can use an alternative definition through Fubini-Study metric [89]. We adapt the approach given in [88] where they
work on a lattice of infinite harmonic oscillators and constructing the desired U using path
ordered exponential of Hamiltonian in the space of circuits parametrized by s.

can be expanded in terms of generalized Pauli matrices as,
Hamiltonian :

H(s) =

X

Y I (s)MI ,

(3.4)

I

where MI represents the generalised Pauli matrices, and the coefficients Y I (s) are control
functions that tell which gate to act at a particular value of s. These functions specify
tangent to the trajectory in the space of unitaries and hence solve the Schrödinger equation
Path evolution of unitary operator :

dU (s)
= −iY (s)I MI U (s) .

(3.5)

The idea then is to define a cost functional for all possible paths, and minimizing this will
give us the optimal circuit.

where F is a local cost functional depending on the position U (s) and velocity Y I (s).
This problem is now similar to minimizing action on a given Lagrangian - F (U (s), Y I (s)).
The cost function needs to satisfy certain properties for it to be physically reasonable. He
identified the problem of finding the optimal circuit with the problem of finding extremal
curves or geodesics in a Finsler geometry, with the cost functional acting as the Finsler
metric. Complexity is then identified with the length of the geodesic.
Among the many known, the most studied cost functionals are the linearly weighted
and the geodesically weighted cost functional and are defined as

The purpose of computing complexity from two different types of cost functional will
enable us to comment on which cost functional is better for probing the underlying quantum
chaotic features of a system.
The final step will be to get explicit expressions for the velocity. In our particular case
working with squeezed vacuum state and unsqueezed vacuum state Sec. 5, we can write
2
the wave functions as Gaussian e−x . By suitably diagonalizing we can represent the wave

(3.9)

Our reference and target states can then be specified in terms of the positive symmetric
matrices A. One can then find an expression of gates in their matrix forms that act on A
to produce the target state from the reference state. These gate action is defined by a set
of generators MI .
Gate Action :

Qab = exp[Mab ]

,

(3.10)

where MI are suitable generators decided by the Hamiltonian of the model. and  is
a parameter. We can then find explicit expressions for the velocity Y I (s) by rewriting
equation 3.5 in the following form:
Y I (s)MI = i(∂s U (s))U −1 (s)

.

(3.11)

Often the basis generators are simple enough to produce simple inner products seen in
many cases [88, 90, 91] given by
Inner Product :

Tr(MI MJT ) ≈ δIJ

.

(3.12)

With this one can get a straightforward equation of velocity.
Velocity :

Y I (s) = Tr(i(∂s U (s))U −1 (s)MIT )

.

(3.13)

Using this, we can write the velocity in terms of the Unitary operation that can be
identified from the diagonalized representation of the reference and target state derived
from the model’s Hamiltonian. We have done this using squeezed state formalism in
Cosmological perturbations in the following sections for our given model.
To give some motivation about the necessity of complexity in theoretical physics, we
review here some of the important aspects of complexity that has been used by many
people in this field:
• Motivation I:
The motivation to study circuit complexity in high energy physics arose when it
was applied to quantum field theory and gravity sector [88, 91–117], particularly

15

from attempts to apply AdS/CFT duality in certain black hole settings. Susskind
et al. in ref. [19] proposed ways of probing the interior regions of the black hole
horizon. They showed that these probes can be somehow related to a Quantum
information-theoretic measure, namely, ”Complexity”. Two famous conjectures came
into the picture, which opened many new areas of research in the branch of theoretical physics connecting condensed matter and high energy physics with quantum
information science being the heart. The two conjectures are famously known as the
”Complexity=Volume” and ”Complexity= Action” [1, 84, 85, 118].
• Motivation II:
Apart from its use in the gravity sector, the notion of circuit complexity has found
its application in various other areas. Having a close relationship with the Out of
time-ordered correlation functions (OTOC’s) circuit complexity has recently been
used as a diagnostic of quantum chaos and randomness [119, 120]. Complexity has
been found to provide many important details that are of utmost significance when
one speaks about a chaotic system. It can be used to predict the Lyapunov exponent
[121], scrambling time [122], equilibrium temperature, and many other important
properties of a chaotic system. Also in the non-chaotic regime where one cannot
connect the circuit complexity function with OTOC through a simple relationship,
the present analysis acts a significant theoretical probe to study the underlying various unknown physical properties of the system under consideration. We will show
later that instead of getting exponential growth, in the non-chaotic regime which
can be studied with very tiny values of the Cosmological Constant values we get
decreasing behaviour.
• Motivation III:
Recently people have tried to study and quantify chaos in different cosmological
frameworks using the notion of circuit complexity and OTOC’s [20–23, 123]. By
following the same research trend in this article we have studied the same issue for
the given model in detail. Though we have not restricted ourself to study only the
chaotic features, but also we have explored the other parameter space (tiny value
of the Cosmological Constants) where all the non-chaotic decreasing feature in the
circuit complexity function as well the Island entropy function can be observed with
respect the two possible solutions of the dynamical scale factors obtained for spatially flat FLRW cosmological background in presence of radiation and two possible
signatures of Cosmological Constant.

Cosmological models for Islands

Squeezed states from perturbation FLRW cosmology

In this section, we will study squeezed state formalism within the framework of cosmological perturbation theory for FLRW spatially flat background. As already discussed
in the earlier section, we consider the Island action in the 3+1 dimension in the Einstein
frame given by
Z

1
SE =
dτ d3 x a4 (τ ) R + (∂φ)2 − 2V (φ)
(5.1)
2
We again remind the reader that in the above equation, we have deliberately removed the
tilde sign from the field variable for the sake of notational simplicity. It is to be noted
that the field variable φ in the above equation represents the redefined field in the Einstein
frame. We now consider the following perturbation in the scalar field:
φ(x, τ ) = φ(τ ) + δφ(x, τ )

(5.2)

and the whole dynamics can be expressed in terms of a gauge invariant description through
a variable given by:
ζ(x, τ ) = − 

H(τ )
 δφ(x, t).
dφ(τ )
dτ

(5.3)

We fix some gauge constraints that re-parametrizes space-time for the first order perturbation theory:
δφ(x, τ ) = 0, gij (x, τ ) = a2 (τ ) [(1 + 2ζ(x, τ )) δij + hij (x, τ )] , ∂i hij (x, τ ) = 0 = hii (x, τ ),
This gauge, conserves the curvature perturbation variable is outside the horizon.
We apply ADM formalism to compute the second-order perturbed action for scalar
modes. The action, after gauge fixing is:

(5.5)

To re-parametrize the second-order perturbed action, we introduce the following space-time
dependent variable:
v(x, τ ) = z(τ ) ζ(x, τ ),

p
where z(τ ) = a(τ ) (τ ),

(5.6)

which transforms the perturbed action to a familiar form of canonical scalar field. This is
known as the Mukhanov variable. Additionally, note that the newly defined quantity, (τ )

20

is the conformal time dependent slow-varying parameter:

We vary the second-order perturbed action with respect to the perturbed field variable in
the Fourier space, and we get:
vk00 (τ ) + ω 2 (k, τ )vk (τ ) = 0.

(5.13)

This is known as the Mukhanov-Sasaki equation and represents the classical equation of
motion of a parametric oscillator where the frequency of the oscillator is conformal time
dependent and in the present context of discussion, given by :
ω 2 (k, τ ) := k 2 + m2eff (τ ),

(5.14)

The conformal time dependent mass parameter can be calculated for the two models considered in this paper as follows. In the Friedman equations the effective fluid in
the presence of radiation and a negative (AdS) / positive (dS) cosmological constant are
described by the following effective pressure and energy densities, which are given by:
AdS FLRW + Radiation:

(5.19)

Further, we introduce a quantity called equation of state parameter for the effective fluid,
weff , which is defined as follows:

Squeezed state formalism in Island Cosmology

Following [45, 46], we factorize the unitary evolution operator produced by the above

28

Hamiltonian U, as follows
U(τ, τ0 ) = Ŝ(rk (τ, τ0 ), φk (τ ))R̂(θk (τ )),

(5.55)

where R is the two mode rotation operator, defined as:
R̂(θk (τ )) = exp −iθk (τ ) âk â†k + â†−k â−k

(5.57)

The time-dependent parameters, rk (τ ) and φk (τ ) describes the squeezing amplitude and
the squeezing angle respectively. The two-mode rotation operator, R̂, also produces an
irrelevant phase factor exp(iθk (τ )) while acted upon the initial quantum vacuum state
and can be safely ignored. The appearance of the squeezed quantum state can be realized through the interaction of the cosmological perturbation with the conformal timedependent scale factor. This leads to a conformal time-dependent frequency for the parametric oscillator, whose quantization is described in terms of the two-mode squeezed state
formalism as described in [45]. We choose the ground state of the free Hamiltonian as the
initial quantum mechanical state:
âk |0ik,−k = 0

∀ k,

(5.58)

which is basically a Poincare invariant vacuum state in the present context of discussion.
The action of the squeezed quantum operator Ŝ on the above initial vacuum state
produces a two-mode squeezed quantum vacuum state, as:

Time evolution in squeezed state formalism

We begin by expressing the creation and annihilation operators of the parametric oscillator in terms of the squeezed states and using the factorized form of the unitary operator
introduced in the previous subsection, the expression for the creation and annihilation
operator can be written at any arbitrary time scale as:
âk (τ ) = Û † (τ, τ0 ) âk Û(τ, τ0 )
= R̂† (θk (τ ))Ŝ † (rk (τ ), φk (τ )) âk R̂(θk (τ ))Ŝ(rk (τ ), φk (τ ))
= cosh rk (τ ) exp(−iθk (τ )) âk − sinh rk (τ ) exp(i(θk (τ ) + 2φk (τ ))) â†−k , (5.62)
â†−k (τ ) = Û † (τ, τ0 ) â†−k Û(τ, τ0 )
= R̂† (θk (τ ))Ŝ † (rk (τ ), φk (τ )) â†−k R̂(θk (τ ))Ŝ(rk (τ ), φk (τ ))
= cosh rk (τ ) exp(iθk (τ )) â†−k − sinh rk (τ ) exp(−i(θk (τ ) + 2φk (τ ))) âk . (5.63)
Consequently, the quantum operator associated with the cosmological perturbation field
variable for the scalar fluctuation and the its canonically conjugate momenta can be expressed as:
!
v̂k (τ ) = vk (τ0 ) âk (τ ) + â†−k (τ )

Quantum complexity from squeezed quantum states in Island cosmology

To compute the complexity from squeezed formalism we use the wave function formalism
of computing circuit complexity developed by [88] and used extensively in [21, 22, 92]. We
fix a reference state |0ik,−k , commonly used in cosmological perturbations. The squeezed
two-mode vacuum state |Ψsq ik,−k becomes the target state.

31

The reference two-mode vacuum state wave function is given by:
âk |0ik,−k = 0 ∀ k

(5.72)

which has the following usual Gaussian structure:

Below, we provide a formal derivation of the expressions of the circuit complexities.
As already discussed, the above expressions are derived using the Nielsen’s wave function
approach. However another approach which people uses is the Covariance matrix method.
A formal derivation of the circuit complexities in the covariance matrix approach can be
found in [124]. The Nielsen’s wave function approach uses wavefunctions to give circuit
complexities of two mode squeezed states that is sensitive to both squeezing parameters:
rk and φk . The complexity is calculated using the reference and target two-mode squeezed
states. This enables to write the circuit complexity in terms of squeezing parameters rk
and φk .
The exponent of the target state i.e. two-mode squeezed states eq: 5.75 can be diagonalized as:



Ψsq = N exp − M̃ vk v−k

The unitary transformation acts like,
Aη = U(η).Aη=0 .U T (η)

(5.91)

The boundary conditions is given by:
Aη=1 = U(η = 1).Aη=0 .U T (η = 1)
Aη=0 = U(η = 0).Aη=0 .U T (η = 0)

(5.92)

U can be parametrized in terms of the tangent vectors as discussed earlier such that at η =
1, the required target state is achieved. Since, Aη=1 and Aη=0 can have complex elements,
elementary gates are restricted to GL(2, C) unitaries. The tangent vector components are
given by:
Y I = Tr(∂η U (η)U −1 (η)(OI )T )
(5.93)
where, it is to be noted that:
Tr(OI .OJT ) = δ IJ ,

(5.94)

and I, J = 0, 1, 2, 3. The metric is then given by:
ds2 = GIJ dY I dY ∗J .

34

(5.95)

For simplicity, we will choose penalty factors GIJ = δ IJ where we fix it to unity. The
off-diagonal elements in GL(2, C) can be set to zero as they increase the distance between
states. The U (η) will become:


X
(5.96)
U (η) = exp 
αi (η)Oidiagonal 
i∈(k,−k)

where, αi (η) are complex parameters and Oidiagonal are generators with identity at i diagonal
elements. The metric takes a simple form:
X
ds2 =
(dαi,Re )2 + (dαi,Im )2
(5.97)
i∈(k,−k)

where, Re and Im indicates real and imaginary part of αk respectively. The geodesic is
again a straight line in the manifold given by:
αi,p (η) = αi,p (η = 1) + αi,p (η = 0)

(5.98)

for each (i ∈ k, −k) and (p = Re and Im). For the given boundary conditions written
earlier, one gets

Entanglement entropy of two mode squeezed states

In this section, the prime motivation is to compute the entanglement entropy for the
two-mode squeezed states and compare it to the circuit complexity. Apart from being
entangled, there exists a strong correlation between the two modes of the state. |Ψsq ik,−k
is also an eigenstate of the operator n̂k − n̂−k with eigenvalue 0, where n̂k = â†k â−k and
n̂−k = â†−k âk . Due to this strong correlation and symmetry between the two modes,
average photon number is identical in each mode:
hn̂k i = hn̂−k i = sinh2 rk

(6.1)

The reduced density operators for the individual modes can be written as:
ρ̂k =

∞
X

1
(tanh rk )2n hnk |nk i,
2
(cosh rk )

n=0
∞
X

ρ̂−k =

n=0

1
(tanh r−k )2n hn−k |n−k i.
(cosh r−k )2

(6.2)
(6.3)

The probability of having n photons in a single mode k or −k is given by:
Pn(i) =

(tanhrk )2n
, i = k, −k
(coshrk )2

(6.4)

The most commonly used entanglement entropies are the Von-Neumann entanglement
entropy and the Renyi entropy, on which we have focussed on this paper. For a density
operator ρ̂, von-Neumann entropy is given by:
S(ρ̂) = −Tr[ρ̂ lnρ̂]

(6.5)

For a pure state the von-Neumann entropy is zero while for mixed states it is greater than
zero. However, it is usually not a trivial task to calculate the entropy, but for the basis
in which density operator is diagonal such as in Schmidt basis, entropy can be calculated

36

simply from the diagonal elements as:
S(ρ̂) = −Tr[ρ̂lnρ̂] = −

X

ρkk lnρkk

(6.6)

k

Since the two mode squeezed state 5.75 is already in the form of Schmidt decomposition,
and the form of reduced density operators of individual modes k and −k is also known,
the Von-Neumann entanglement entropy can be calculated by realizing that the diagonal
(i)
elements ρkk is Pn . Then, the Von-Neumann entropy is given by:
S(ρ̂k ) = −Tr[ρˆk lnρˆk ] = S(ρ̂−k ) = −

(6.7)

It is to be noted that the entropy corresponding to the squeezed state 5.75 is not calculated
because naturally this entropy is going to be zero as it is a pure state. Instead, we have
calculated entropy for the reduced density matrix.
The Von-Neumann entropy can now be generalized to get the Rényi entropy for the
reduced density operator:
d

2µ ln coshrk + ln(1 − tanh2µ rk )

Pn =
Sµ =
1 − µ n=1
µ−1

(6.8)

where µ ≥ 0 is the Rényi Parameter and d is the Schmidt rank of the squeezed state 5.75
which is infinity.
For very large squeezing parameter, we get:
Sµ (rk → ∞) ≈

2µrk
(µ − 1)

On taking the limit, µ → 1, we get the Von-Neumann entropy Eq. (6.7). Meanwhile,

of the thermal field is given by:

Numerical study with Cosmological Islands

Our objective is to numerically solve the time evolution differential equations satisfied
by the squeezed state parameters in this section. We have used the scale factor as the
dynamical variable instead of the conformal time, making our computation physically
justifiable. This change in the variable is commonly known as field redefinition. Once we
solve the differential equations, it will enable us to compute the circuit complexity between
two reference states within the framework of cosmological perturbation theory. The effects
of quantum fluctuations are treated in terms of squeezed states. We numerically plot
the complexities calculated from two different cost functionals for both the models of the
cosmological scale factors. Using the logic given in [20], we write the expression for the
complexity in the exponentially increasing region as
Ci (a) ≈ ci exp(λi a)a=aexp

∀ i = 1, 2

(7.1)

It is to be noted that the above equation is valid only for the exponentially rising region;
hence the subscript aexp has been used, which we indeed observe for both the measures
of complexity in both the models. The index ”i” in the above equation indicates which
measure of complexity is being used. The slopes and the amplitudes are written with
index i to indicate that they are different for different models. Mathematically, this can
be represented as

λi =

d ln Ci (a)
da


∀

i = 1, 2,

(7.2)

One can also conjecture a similar relation between OTOC and complexity for the
exponentially rising region keeping in mind that complexity and OTOC are related by
C = −ln(OT OC). Hence for the exponentially rising region, the out-of-time ordered
correlation function can be written as
OTOC ≈ exp(−c exp(λa))

(7.3)

In reference [20], the authors identified the slope λ as the quantum Lyapunov exponent
which captures the effect of chaos in the quantum regime and showed the existence of a

38

universal relation between the different measures of complexity. It is represented as
C = − ln (OTOC) ≈ Ci ∀ i = 1, 2

(7.4)

The above universal relation between the complexities can be translated to the Lyapunov
exponent through the MSS bound. Thus,
λi - λ ≤

2π
∀ i = 1, 2
β

(7.5)

This relation can further be used to estimate the lower bound on the equilibrium temperature, which can be done using the following relation

=⇒

For our purpose, we have numerically estimated the values of the Lyapunov exponents
for the both the models of scale factors using the following relation
λi =

ln Ci (apeak ) − ln Ci (arise )
apeak − arise

(7.7)

The use of the above relation simplifies our task and prevents the complications of implementing numerical differentiation. Furthermore, using the relation between the circuit
complexity and entanglement entropy, we numerically plotted the entropy with respect to
the scale factor.

Islands in recollapsing FLRW (Cosine Scale factor)

In Fig. 7.1 and Fig. 7.2 the squeezed state parameter rk and the squeezing angle φk are
plotted with respect to the scale factor. The behaviour of the squeezed state parameters
determines the nature of complexity.
• In Fig. 7.3 and Fig. 7.4 the behaviour of the circuit complexity computed from the
linearly weighted and geodesically weighted cost functional are shown with respect
to the scale factor. Although the overall behaviour of the complexity measures are
identical, some noticeable differences do occur, which are appended below
– The complexity measure C1 (linearly weighted measure)is larger than C2 for the
entire range of scale factor.
– At the transition point, a slight dip in C1 is observed, whereas, for the same
point, there is a peak for C2 .

worth raising at this point is whether the entanglement entropy between the two
modes of the squeezed state computed from the squeezed state formalism can be
related to the generalized entropy of the quantum extremal island in FRW spacetime.
Though, not directly but some information about the quantum extremal islands is
indeed encoded in the entanglement entropy of the two modes of the squeezed state.
This is because, the information of the model is provided by the solution of the
scale factor which has been used as the dynamical variable in solving the evolution
equations of the squeezed parameters.
• In Fig. 7.9, we have plotted the behavior of the equilibrium temperature of the two
modes squeezed state with respect to the scale factor. We observe that for intial
evolutionary scales, the equlibrium temperature rises sharply. This rise slows down
for the intermediate scales and moves towards saturation at the large evolutionary
scales. Thus, we can see that the equilibrium temperature is not a constant but has
different values at different phases of the evolutionary scales.

factor, so we start observing deviations from the linear graph. Moreover, in Fig. 7.15, we see
an initial rise, followed by saturation and then a sharp upward deviation at particular values
of the scale factor. We expect complexity measures also to experience similar deviation
near particular values of the scale factor.

• In Fig. 7.16 and Fig. 7.17 the behaviour of the circuit complexity computed from
the linearly weighted and geodesically weighted cost functional is shown with respect
to the scale factor. Although the overall behaviour of the complexity measures is
identical, some noticeable differences are mentioned below:
– The complexity measure C1 (linearly weighted measure) is larger than C2 for the
entire range of scale factor.
– The peak in C1 is a non-uniform double peak, whereas for C2 this becomes a
more uniform and smooth peak at the top.
– The initial rise in C1 is more linear when compared to the initial rising part of
C2 . We also observe the rise begins a little later in the case for C2 .
• The general trend that we observe for the family of complexity values is that it
initially rises, reaches a peak and then falls. The most peculiar difference is the
deviation at particular values of scale factor for each cosmological constant. We

Table 7.2 shows the value of the Lyapunov exponents calculated for the initial exponentially rising region before the transition scale factor. The family of complexity curves
follow a very similar trend during the rising portion. The estimation of the Lyapunov
exponent from different complexity measures gives very similar values. There are slight
differences in the values in the 3rd or 4th decimal places as we go to smaller values of the
cosmological constant.
We observe deviations only after a few decimal places, and they are only significant in
smaller values of the cosmological constant and higher cost functional family. This shows
a higher sensitivity in smaller cosmological constant and higher-order cost functional.

• A similar increasing behavior followed by saturation is observed for the equilibrium
temperature, as was seen for the cosine model case. However, the difference again
lies in the existence of the cut off values of the scale factor for the sinh model beyond

behavior while at large scales it just shows a random fluctuating behavior. This
feature was not observed in the earlier parameter space.
• The behaviour of the OTOC’s in this parameter space is also remarkably different
from the ones that we observed in the earlier parameter space. In this regime, the
OTOC shows a slowly increasing behavior in the early evolutionary scales, followed by
a sharp increase in the intermediate regions. However, at late time scales, the OTOC
shows a similar fluctuating behavior as the circuit complexity. Another important
feature is the absence of the cut off values of the evolutionary scales in this parameter
space which was observed in the earlier case.
In 7.3, a comparative analysis of the two models has been done in the two different parameter space chosen in the paper. The remarkable difference in the properties of the circuit
complexity and OTOC in the two different parameter spaces shows the non-universality of
the complexities and the OTOC’s and suggests that they are dependent on the parameters
of the chosen model and also on the regime of the evolutionary scale in which it is studied.
Table 7.4 summarizes all our important conclusions from the study of the two cosmological scale factors, one with island and the other without island.

Table 7.3: Comparative study of the two models of scale factors in the two different
parameter space chosen in the paper.
From our study of cosmological Islands, we have the following final remarks:
• Remark I:
The single field two mode squeezed state formalism enables us to express the various
measures computed in this paper in terms of only two variables, the squeezed state
parameter and the squeezed angle instead of adopting the general semi-classical approach. The squeezed state formalism approach provides an elegant way of comparing
various measures calculated in this paper.
• Remark II:
The notion of circuit complexity and OTOC can be used as a useful tool for elucidating many unknown aspects of gravitational and cosmological models. One can
comment on the difference between the two cosmological models considered in this
paper by computing the circuit complexity within the framework of spatially flat
FLRW cosmology in the presence of quantum extremal Islands, having AdS with
radiation and dS with radiation.
• Remark III:
In any chosen parameter space, the complexity behavior in spatially flat FLRW
cosmology in the presence and absence of islands shows remarkably different features.
• Remark IV:
The behavior of the Out-of-time-ordered correlation functions are also drastically
different for the two different cases considered in this paper.

• Remark V:
Circuit complexity and OTOC’s are universal in the entire region of the parameter
space of the chosen model. This can be seen from the different behavior of the complexity measures for different ranges of the cosmological models.
• Remark VI:
The Quantum Lyapunov exponent and equilibrium temperature calculated from different complexity measures satisfy the universality relation established in ref. [20].

56

• Remark VII:
The entropy of the modes of the squeezed states shows an increasing behavior for
both the models with some minute differences, showing that the presence or absence
of islands in FRW cosmology does not effect the entropy of the modes of the squeezed
state. The equilibrium temperature of the two mode squeezed state also shows
identical overall behavior irrespective of the presence or absence of islands.
• Remark VIII:
In the Sine hyperbolic model (without islands), one can see the initial portion of the
complexity curve resembling the cosine model (with islands). However, due to the
deviation at different cut-off values of the scale factor, the behavior in the decreasing
part at late evolutionary scales is not identical.
Some of the prospects can be in the following direction:
• Prospect I:
As discussed earlier, apart from the quantum extremal surface or Island prescription,
other proposals have also been suggested to solve the black hole information paradox.
However, none of them has been studied using the notion of circuit complexity and
OTOC. A very intuitive study will be to try and predict the entanglement entropy
from the computation of circuit complexity for the other proposals. One can then
comment on the best proposal for reproducing the page curve from the perspective
of Circuit complexity and OTOC.
• Prospect II:
It is a well-known fact that black holes are highly chaotic systems. One can then ask
the question from the perspective of black hole chaos about which one is a better
proposal in reproducing the page curve and revealing the chaotic features of black
holes. This question can be addressed from the study of circuit complexity and
OTOC, which are the most relevant probes of quantum chaos.
• Prospect III:
An extension of the present work can be done for the primordial gravitational waves,
requiring the inclusion of the tensor mode fluctuations generated from cosmological
perturbations in the spatially flat FLRW background rather than the scalar modes
considered in this case. It would be an interesting study as to how the two-mode
squeezed state formalism brings about the phenomenon of chaos and complexity in
primordial gravitational waves.
• Prospect IV:
A model-independent notion of circuit complexity can be given from the perspective
of Effective Field theory, where one starts from a single EFT action and derives

57

all models under various constraints satisfied by the action’s parameters. Squeezed
state formalism for such a universal action can be developed to generalize an give a
model-independent prescription of complexity.
• Prospect V:
Recently there has been a study of the Islands contribution in the Entanglement
negativity [125]. This motivates us to rethink various entanglement-related phenomena studied in [35, 36, 126, 127] and whether those aspects can be studied from the
perspective of Islands.
• Prospect VI:
Recently, there have been many studies in the field of Open Quantum Systems (OQS)
[128–130]. It is natural to expect that an OQS will exhibit chaotic behaviour due to
its constant interaction with its immediate surroundings. One can utilize the concept
of circuit complexity and OTOC to probe the chaos shown by an OQS.

Dispersion relation in Cosmological Islands

In this appendix, our prime objective is to derive the expression for the dispersion
relation in terms of the squeezed parameter rk (τ ) and the squeezed angle φk (τ ), where the
dispersion relation appears in the Hamiltonian after quantization that we studied in the
paper explicitly.
Let us first write down the expression for the conformal time dependent dispersion
relation Ωk in terms of the canonical field variable and its associated canonically conjugate
momentum that appears after performing the cosmological perturbation theory for a single
scalar field:
(

vk (τ ) + µ2 (k, τ ) |vk (τ )|2

Ωk (τ ) : =
(
=

!)

|πk (τ )|2 + k 2 |vk (τ )|2 + λk (τ ) πk∗ (τ )vk (τ ) + vk∗ (τ )πk (τ )

,

Now, we plug in the expressions for πk (τ ) and vk (τ ), which are reproduced here for
convenience :
!
vk (τ ) = vk (τ0 ) cosh rk (τ ) exp(iθk (τ )) − sinh rk (τ ) exp(i(θk (τ ) + 2φk (τ ))) ,

(B.1)

!
πk (τ ) = πk (τ0 ) cosh rk (τ ) exp(iθk (τ )) + sinh rk (τ ) exp(i(θk (τ ) + 2φk (τ ))) ,

(B.2)

and after doing algebraic manipulation we get the following result:
!
Ωk (τ ) =

|πk (τ0 )|2 + k 2 |vk (τ0 )|2

!
cosh2 rk (τ ) + sinh2 rk (τ )
!

+ sinh rk (τ ) · cos 2φk (τ ) |πk (τ0 )|2 − k 2 |vk (τ0 )|2
(
+ λk (τ )

(B.3)

!

!)
+ i sinh 2rk (τ ) sin 2φk (τ ) πk∗ (τ0 )vk (τ0 ) − vk∗ (τ0 )πk (τ0 )

.

Here we have chosen the initial condition at the time scale τ = τ0 by considering, −kτ0 =
1. We impose this condition on the perturbation field variable and on the canonically
conjugate momentum obtained for scalar fluctuation. We finally get:

Now we consider a specific situation in the time line of our FLRW universe, where it
is expected to have very small contribution from the squeezed parameter, rk (τ ) for which

63

one can use the following approximations:
cosh rk (τ ) ≈ 1,

sinh rk (τ ) ≈ rk (τ ).

(B.15)

Consequently, we get the following result for the Island dispersion relation:

which is basically dependent on the co-moving wave number and the time dependent
quantity νisland . Further, if we assume that the contributions appearing through the factors
∆AdS (a) and ∆dS (a) are appearing as a correction terms due to its smallness the by applying
the Binomial approximation the conformal time dependent generalised mass parameter
νisland can be approximately written by considering the contribution upto the next-toleading order term as:


νisland (a) ≈

(B.18)

The similar approximation can also be realised in terms of the effective equation of state
parameter as well, which can written as:

(B.19)

where we have neglected the contributions of all higher order small correction terms appearing as · · · from AdS+radiation and dS+radiation sectors respectively. Now after
substituting the above mentioned expression for the mass parameter νisland one can further
write the following simplified form of the dispersion relation, Ωk (τ ), which is given by:
