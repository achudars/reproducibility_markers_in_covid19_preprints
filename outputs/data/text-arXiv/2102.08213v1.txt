Abstract
In this paper we propose a novel SEIR stochastic epidemic model. A distinguishing feature of this new model is that it allows us to consider a set up under
general latency and infectious period distributions. To some extent, queuing
systems with infinitely many servers and a Markov chain with time-varying
transition rate are the very technical underpinning of the paper. Although
more general, the Markov chain is as tractable as previous models for exponentially distributed latency and infection periods. It is also significantly simpler
and more tractable than semi-Markov models with a similar level of generality. Based on the notion of stochastic stability, we derive a sufficient condition
for a shrinking epidemic in terms of the queuing system’s occupation rate that
drives the dynamics. Relying on this condition, we propose a class of ad-hoc
stabilising mitigation strategies that seek to keep a balanced occupation rate

after a prescribed mitigation-free period. We validate the approach in the light
of recent data on the COVID-19 epidemic and assess the effect of different stabilising strategies. The results suggest that it is possible to curb the epidemic
with various occupation rate levels, as long as the mitigation is not excessively
procrastinated.

1. Introduction
Classical epidemic models (e.g., Ross, 1916; Kermack et al., 1927; Hethcote,
2000) are powerful tools to understand the spread of diseases and support public health policies. However, these models are deterministic and consequently
do not capture the underlying uncertainties of the spread. Stochastic epidemic
models (Allen, 2008; Britton, 2010) were therefore designed to better capture
some of these uncertainties and provide more realistic support for decision making.
Perhaps due to its simplicity, the susceptible, infected, removed (SIR) is arguably the most utilised class of stochastic epidemic models. Trapman and Bootsma
(2009) made use of this framework to demonstrate the advantage of an M/G/1
queuing model to estimate the size of an epidemic at the time of detection.
Some time later, classical M/M/S queues were utilised to estimate the whole
outbreak of the Ebola virus (Dike et al., 2016). More recently, Barraza et al.
(2020) employed pure Birth processes to fit data from the initial stages of the
COVID-19 epidemic. Underpinning the analysis is the theory of Markov processes (Brémaud, 1999), used to model the transition of individuals among the
SIR populations.
Markov models provide a powerful analytical framework for SIR models, allowing for example the treatment of non-homogeneous populations (López-Garcı́a,
2016). One of the limitations, however, is that the duration of the infectious
period is assumed exponential, thus narrowing the technique’s applicability

2

(Clancy, 2014; Gómez-Corral and López-Garcı́a, 2017). A possible alternative is
to develop more complex block-structured Markov chains that can mimic certain
types of non-exponential infection times (Lefèvre and Simon, 2020; İşlier et al.,
2020). Albeit limited, the added flexibility comes at the price of less interpretable and tractable models.
A thorough treatment of general infection times demands a class of semiMarkov processes known as piecewise-deterministic processes (PDP) (Davis,
1993). Clancy (2014) uses such a class and martingale theory to derive the distribution of the number of infected individuals throughout the pandemic under
generally distributed infection times. Later, Gómez-Corral and López-Garcı́a
(2017) utilised a similar model to obtain the distribution of the number of secondary cases due to an infected individual. However, it requires a memory of
the disease progression of all currently infected individuals, which impacts the
model’s analytical and computational tractability and limits its use.
Inspired by the recent COVID-19 outbreak, this paper uses the SEIR (susceptible, exposed, infected, removed ) framework, which is analogous to SIR except for considering a latency period, whereby a recently infected individual
does not manifest the disease nor can transmit it for a limited period after acquiring the illness. In addition to being more general, such a modelling choice
is adequate for the COVID-19 epidemic, given its non-negligible latency period (Backer et al., 2020). Examples of stochastic SEIR models (Artalejo et al.,
2015; Lopez-Herrero, 2017; Amador and Lopez-Herrero, 2018) assume exponentially distributed latency and infection periods. The first work concerns the
duration of the outbreak, the second the transmission rate per infected person
and the latter the epidemic size.
This paper builds upon previous literature (Trapman and Bootsma, 2009)
with innovative use of two Mt /G/∞ models to describe the epidemic’s stochastic
behaviour. However, whilst the M/G/1 queue in (Trapman and Bootsma, 2009)
models the epidemic up to the time of detection, the proposed model covers the
whole outbreak. Such a generalisation hinges on two unique novelties. Firstly,
we describe the input process as a time-varying Poisson process, which enables
3

us to describe the variation of infection rates as a function of the system’s
dynamics. Secondly, by realising that there are no limits in the number of
new infections and considering that conditions progress in parallel, we select a
queuing model with infinitely many servers.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce a timevarying Markov chain capable of emulating a stochastic epidemic model with
general latency and infection times. This innovation relies on the results of
Eick et al. (1993), that demonstrate that the output process of Mt /G/∞ queues
comprises a series of time indexed Poisson variables. Albeit as tractable as the
models that assume exponential (memoryless) infection and latency periods
(e.g., Artalejo et al., 2015; Lopez-Herrero, 2017; Amador and Lopez-Herrero,
2018), the proposed framework is more general than the complex block-structured
models (e.g., Lefèvre and Simon, 2020; İşlier et al., 2020) as it does not impose
any assumption on the infection and latency period distributions.
Even if our approach’s level of generality is matched in part by previous PDP models within the more restricted SIR framework (Clancy, 2014;
Gómez-Corral and López-Garcı́a, 2017), these require memory of the disease
progression of all individuals in the infected population. Of course, this is infeasible for all but tiny population sizes and limits such models’ applicability to
support decision making. In contrast, the proposed framework considers general latency and infection periods by keeping track solely of the new expositions
within a complete cycle of the disease: from catching the virus to entering the
removed population.
In addition to the methodological innovations, we propose a novel strategy to
curb the epidemic that is based on the classical occupation rate of the Mt /G/∞
exposition-to-removal queue. We claim that this measure is analogous to the
deterministic reproduction number as it also provides a dynamic estimate of the
epidemic’s short-term growth. The strategy relies on mitigating actions specially
tailored to maintain the occupation rate ρ of the system as close as possible to
a prescribed level 0 < ρ̄ < 1 at all times and thus ensure a shrinking epidemic.
We use COVID-19 data from the literature to validate the strategy by means of
4

experiments designed to illustrate the utility of the approach whilst providing
invaluable insights into the system’s response to the proposed class of mitigation
policies. The results demonstrate that by maintaining adequate occupation
level targets, the epidemic can be conquered, as long as the mitigation is not
excessively delayed.
This work is organised as follows. Section 2 introduces the mathematical
formulation of the proposed SEIR model, starting with the proposed Mt /G/∞
queues. We then use these queues’ resulting input and output processes to
propose a continuous time Markov chain to describe the epidemic’s evolution.
Section 3 analyses stochastic stability and makes use of the results to propose
a class of ad-hoc mitigation strategies to curb the epidemic. Section 4 employs
COVID-19 data from the literature to establish a set of experiments designed to
illustrate the performance of the model in a real-world setting. The experiments
also highlight the effectiveness of prescribed mitigation policies belonging to
the class introduced in the previous Section. Finally, Section 5 concludes the
manuscript.
1.1. A Few Notations
Throughout this paper we shall be using the following notation. Let Z+ be
the usual set of non-negative integers and N = {0, 1, 2, 3, ...N } ⊂ Z+ , where N
is a finite number. Consider Ω = N 4 and define the probability space (Ω, F , P).
In addition, E(·) stands for the mathematical expectation.

2. Mathematical formulation
This section proposes a stochastic dynamic formulation in a probability space
(Ω, F , P). It relies on the classical deterministic SEIR epidemiological model
(Ross, 1916; Kermack et al., 1927; Hethcote, 2000), thus depicted in Figure 1
and in Table 1.
The model comprises four compartments, namely: (i) susceptible, (ii) exposed, (iii) infected and (iv) removed. Susceptible individuals can be infected if

they come in contact with infected individuals. The exposed population, meanwhile, have been infected but the infection is still latent. In that phase, they
are not able to spread the disease and do not manifest any symptom. Once
the latency period is over, exposed persons become infected and may present
symptoms. Finally, infected individuals either die as a result of the disease or
become immune to the disease. In both cases, they migrate to the removed
population, which consists of individuals that can no longer contract nor spread
the disease.
In the deterministic model in Figure 1, susceptible individuals become ill
at a rate β > 0 upon making contact with infected (infectious) individuals,
thus resulting in an infection rate δ = βSI. The individuals who acquire the
condition immediately become exposed and initiate their latency period, which
lasts on average σ units of time. Upon completing the latency period, exposed
individuals become infectious for an average of γ time units. After that, they
enter the removed population either due to acquired immunity or death. Table
1 below presents the parameters of the deterministic model:

2.1. Stochastic formulation
Although the model in Figure 1 is invaluable to understand the underlying
process, the dynamics are truly stochastic. Both the latency and the recovery
6

period are, indeed, stochastic variables. See for example Backer et al. (2020)
and Verity et al. (2020) for estimations of the latency and recovery periods at
the early stages of the COVID-19 epidemic. In this Section, use the insights
of Trapman and Bootsma (2009) to model the SEIR dynamics as a queue with
infinite service capacity.
Queue 1 in Figure 2 represents an individual’s trajectory from acquiring
the disease and therefore becoming exposed, to their removal of the system.
Because the individuals’ trajectories are assumed independent, the system can
be modelled as a Mt /G/∞ queue (Eick et al., 1993), since there is no upper
limit on the number of simultaneous infections. The service time is the sum of
two generally distributed random variables σ and γ, representing the latency
and recovery periods, see Table 1; the latter corresponds to the length of the
infectious period.

from Exposed to Infected

Following a previous study of the outset of epidemic (Trapman and Bootsma,
2009), we model the arrival rate as a Poisson random variable with a rate proportional to the maximum number of encounters between healthy and infected
individuals. However, the proposed model innovates by considering a timevarying input rate λ(t) = βS(t)I(t) to cover the epidemic’s evolution over time.
Observe in Figure 2 that each departure from Queue 1 represents a decrease of
one infected individual. In turn, each arrival corresponds to a new exposition,
i.e. a susceptible individual contracting the disease in its latent stage. The
compartments E, I, and R denote the corresponding SEIR populations.

7

Also in Figure 2, Queue 2 is a second Mt /G/∞ queue that covers the latency
period σ only. Each departure of this queue increases the infected population
by one.
The queues in Figure 2 are drawn from Eick et al. (1993). However, the
proposed epidemic model is more general since the input rate λ(t) is not a
deterministic function of time. Instead, it depends on the number of infected
and susceptible individuals at time t ≥ 0. As previously stated, stochastic jumps
in the number of infected individuals depend upon the departure processes of
the two queues introduced in Figure 2. On the other hand, the susceptible
population is non-increasing over time and decreases with each new arrival.
2.1.1. The arrival and departure processes
We start by modelling the arrival process shared by both queues. At any
given time t ≥ 0, the rate of contagion (exposition) is given by
λ(t) = βS(t)I(t), t ≥ 0,

(1)

where β is a scalar parameter, S(t) and I(t) are the sizes of the susceptible and
infected populations at time t, respectively.
By design, the output of Queue 2 - in Figure 2 - is the number of new
infections, i.e. individuals become infected when they depart this queue. Let
δe (t) be a random variable denoting the number of departures from Queue 2 at
time t ≥ 0. According to Eick et al. (1993), δe (t) is a Poisson random variable
with mean:
δe (t) = E(λ (t − σ) ).

(2)

This is because the latency period σ is also the service time of Queue 2.
Let δi (t) be a random variable representing the number of departures from
Queue 1 at time t ≥ 0. Each departure is a newly removed individual and the
total time from exposition to removal is the sum of random variables σ and γ,
which is also the service time of Queue 1. Once again, the results of Eick et al.
(1993) imply that δi (t) is a Poisson random variable with mean:
δi (t) = E(λ( t − (σ + γ) )).
8

(3)

2.1.2. Markov formulation with time-varying transition rate
We make use of the arrival and departure rates of Queues 1 and 2 in Eq.
(1)-(3) to define a time-varying Markov process Xt , t ≥ 0 that describes the
evolution of the populations in the SEIR compartments. At any time t ≥ 0,
X(t) = ( S(t), E(t), I(t), R(t) ) ∈ Ω is the state of process Xt , t ≥ 0. By
definition, Xt , t ≥ 0 will be subject to random jumps that happen whenever
either of these events occur: i) a new exposition, ii) a new departure from Queue
2 or iii) a new departure from Queue 1.
To describe the dynamics of the process Xt , t ≥ 0, we make use of the fact
that the input and output of both queues are described by Poisson variables
(Eick et al., 1993) at any given time t ≥ 0. Consequently, the time until the
next event will be exponentially distributed and the total jump rate at time
t ≥ 0 is:
Λ(t) = λ(t) + δe (t) + δi (t).

(4)

Let {τ0 , τ1 , . . .} be the sequence of jumps in the system, with τ0 ≡ 0 and τk+1 >
τk , ∀k ≥ 0. Now, assume a jump occurs at time t = τk . Then, the following
holds:

P ( X(t+ ) = Y |X(t) = (S(t), E(t), I(t), R(t))), t = τk )


0
otherwise.

(5)

The first expression on the right-hand side of Eq. (5) corresponds to a new

contagion/exposition, which happens at rate λ(t), see Eq. (1), and implies the
transference of an individual from the susceptible to the exposed population.
The second expression corresponds to a new infection that happens upon the
departure of an individual from Queue 2, which occurs at rate δe (t), see Eq. (2).
9

In that case, this individual moves from the exposed to the infected population.
Finally, the third possibility is the departure of an individual from Queue 1,
which happens at rate δi (t), see Eq. (3). In that case, this individual migrates
from the infected to the removed population.
Finally, after the jump at t = τk , k ≥ 0, the value of the exposition rate λ(t)
also changes, and becomes:
λ(t+ ) = βS(t+ )I(t+ ),

(6)

where the new values on the right-hand side of the expression above vary as
a function of the transition probabilities in (5). Clearly, λ(t) remains unaltered between successive jumps. Given an initial distribution and the transition
probability in (5), the process Xt , t ≥ 0 is a continuous-time Markov chain.

3. Stochastic stability and reproduction number
Whereas deterministic models rely on the evaluation of trivial equilibrium
to derive stability conditions and the so-called reproduction number R0 (e.g.
van den Driessche and Watmough, 2002), the notion of stochastic stability (e.g.,
Meyn and Tweedie, 1993) provides an ideal framework to evaluate the conditions for a receding epidemic as time elapses. Queuing theory connects this
notion with the so-called occupation rate, a measure of the input to output
ratio as time elapses (Shortle et al., 2018).
Consider Queue 1 in Figure 2. Assuming a very large population, the stability of such a queue hinges on the occupation rate (e.g., Shortle et al., 2018):
ρ(t) =

λ(t)
,
δi (t)

(7)

and can be ascertained if a finite time t̄ ≥ 0 exists such that ρ(t) < 1, ∀t ≥ t̄.
This guarantees that the system stabilises and the number of customers in the
queue remains finite. With a finite population, however, stability is guaranteed because the number of infected individuals will remain within finite, albeit
possibly large, bounds. In that case, we are interested in the trend of Queue
10

1, which indicates whether the epidemic is increasing or receding. Theorem 1
below establishes the condition for a receding epidemic.
Theorem 1. Consider the Markov process described in Section 2.1.2 and assume that ρ(t) < 1 for all t > t̄ ≥ 0, with t̄ < ∞. Then, it follows that:

(8)
E E(t+ ) + I(t+ ) | X(t) ; t = τk < E(t) + I(t), ∀t = τk > t̄, k ≥ 0,
where {τ0 , τ1 , . . .} is the sequence of jumps in the system, as defined in Section
2.1.2.
Proof From (5) we have that:
E E(t+ ) + I(t+ ) | X(t) ; t = τk



=

λ(t)
(E(t) + I(t) + 1) +
Λ(t)
δe (t)
δi (t)
(E(t) + I(t)) +
(E(t) + I(t) − 1)
Λ(t)
Λ(t)

=E(t) + I(t) +

λ(t) − δi (t)
,
Λ(t)

for all t = τk . The last equality holds because Λ(t) = λ(t) + δe (t) + δi (t) - Eq. (4).
Now, Eq. (8) follows by assuming ρ(t) < 1 for all t > t̄ ≥ 0.

As a consequence of Theorem 1, we can interpret ρ(t) as the reproduction
number of the system at time t and ρ(t) < 1 ∀t > t̄ ≥ 0 as a sufficient condition
for the epidemic to stabilise and shrink. It is worth pointing out that the
theorem indicates that the epidemic is receding only when the sum of exposed
and infected individuals, i.e. all latent and manifested infections, decreases. It
highlights that, although important, the number of infected individuals is not
sufficient to establish the tendency of the epidemic. Indeed, it is quite intuitive
that the latter depends upon the number of latent infections, which are bound
to occur shortly and therefore cannot be ignored.
The model indicates that we have to consider the disease’s whole cycle,
from exposition to removal, to evaluate the epidemic trend, such as in Eq. (7).
It underscores the importance of keeping an accurate track of the epidemic’s
evolution through an efficient testing strategy. The accurate evaluation of such
a cycle’s length will also be essential to evaluate the lags between mitigating
actions and decreases in the number of infections and expositions. Although

11

mitigation can prevent future expositions and infections, it has no effect on
recent transmissions still in the latent stage, which will continue to manifest
and may actually drive infection up in the first stages of the mitigation. This
will become more evident in the experiments carried out in Section 4.
3.1. Mitigation strategies
Theorem 1 provides a basis for developing mitigation strategies to stabilise the epidemic, whereas the Markov model in Section 2.1.2 enables us to
evaluate the long-term effects of such strategies. Following the literature, we
introduce the control (mitigating action) in the form of non-pharmaceutical
interventions to limit the spread of the disease (e.g., Ferguson et al., 2020;
Kantner and Koprucki, 2020; Tarrataca et al., 2021). A control level 0 ≤ u(t) ≤
1 attains a reduction of 100u(t) percentage points in the transmission rate at
time t ≥ 0, thus resulting in a controlled exposition rate:
λ(t, u(t)) = β(1 − u(t))S(t)I(t), t ≥ 0.

(9)

Let π = {u(t), t ≥ 0} be a mitigation strategy and let Π denote the set of
all feasible strategies Π = {π : 0 ≤ u(t) ≤ 1, ∀t ≥ 0}. The dynamics of the
system under any strategy π ∈ Π can be evaluated by running the Markov chain
Xt , t ≥ 0 with the same underlying dynamics, but making λ(t) = λ(t, u(t)), t ≥
0.
We are particularly interested in the class of stabilising policies ΠS ∈ Π,
such that:
u(t) =



0,

if t ≤ t̄,
 

ρ̄

min 1 −
, 0 , if t > t̄,
ρ(t)

(10)

where ρ(t) is the uncontrolled occupation rate in Eq. (7). It is easy to see
that such policies lead to a controlled input rate ρc (t) =

λ(t,u(t))
δi (t)

≤ ρ̄, ∀t > t̄,

see Eq. (9). Henceforth, ρ̄ will be called target occupation level and π = (t̄, ρ̄)
will describe any stabilising policy π ∈ ΠS that satisfies Eq. (10). In the next
Section we will evaluate these policies in the light of the COVID-19 epidemic
and explore the stabilising effect of parameters ρ̄ and t̄ in Eq. (10). Observe
12

that, because the population is finite, the effect of the control is highly sensitive
to and can be limited by a delayed start of mitigation.
Observe, however, that the Markov model in Section 2.1.2 is not limited to
the proposed class of mitigation strategies. In fact, one can substitute any arbitrary mitigation policy π ∈ Π in Eq. (9) and run the controlled Markov chain
to evaluate the effect of such policy. To demonstrate that, our experiments will
also include the on-off lock-down policies proposed by Tarrataca et al. (2021).
Designed to control hospital bed’s occupation, these policies trigger a full scale
lock-down when infections surpass a prescribed upper bound; conversely, mitigating actions are lifted when infections fall bellow a prescribed lower bound.

4. Numerical Experiments
This Section validates the proposed stochastic SEIR dynamic model in Section 2.1.2 in the light of data from the COVID-19 epidemic. We replicate the
parameters of Tarrataca et al. (2021) concerning the spread of the epidemic in
Brazil. The parameters are listed in Table 2.

To complete the necessary data to run the model, we also need the distributions of the latency period σ and of the latency plus infection period (σ + γ),
which represents the full disease cycle. The distributions are compatible with
previous observations (Backer et al., 2020; Verity et al., 2020) and assumed discrete to cope with the typical daily collection of data. Tables 3 and 4 unveil the
distributions of σ and (σ + γ), respectively.

4.1. The effect of delayed mitigation
The first series of experiments examine policies π = (t̄, ρ̄) ∈ ΠS that follow
Eq. (10) with a fixed target occupation level ρ̄ = 0.95. The objective is to
evaluate the effect of delaying the start of mitigating actions by varying the
first parameter. Cases A-G in Table 5 feature different triggering times for
the mitigating actions, starting with the case where no mitigation is enforced
(t̄ = ∞). For each experiment, we ran a full realisation of the system for two
years, starting from the outset of the epidemic.

Figure 3: Epidemic evolution for Case A: the unmitigated spread

Figure 3 shows the daily evolution of the epidemic for Case A, i.e. in the
absence of mitigating actions. To facilitate the interpretation, the number of
individuals in each SEIR compartment is depicted as a percentage of the total
population. One can see that the epidemic spreads rapidly, with the number of
infected individuals peaking around 64% of the population after 128 days. The
epidemic then starts to shrink due to the decrease in the susceptible population,
until it finally subsides around the 165th day.
Observe from Figure 4 that Case B starts the mitigation early in the epidemic, with low levels of infection. The upper plot conveys full results and
in the lower plot we zoom in to detail the evolution of the exposed, infected
and removed populations. The results illustrate the effectiveness of the mitigation policy. Observe that the mitigation policy successfully prevents the spread
of the disease, maintaining 99.6% of the population healthy over the whole
two-year interval, whereas the removed population reaches 0.4% at the end of
that interval. Controlling the epidemic, however, demands very high levels of
mitigation that oscillate and stabilise around 0.875. It is noteworthy that de-

respect to Case B. One can see that the mitigating actions are similar, tend to
stabilise around the same value and are equally sufficient to curb the epidemic.
The difference with respect to Case B is a rather steep increase in the final
number of individuals that catch the disease at some point, represented by the
removed population. This number increases from 0.4% in Case B to around
17% in Case C, thus highlighting the sensitivity of the spread with respect to
mitigation delay. The results also show that a three-week delay produces a
large increment in the peak of infections, for even though this peak only reaches
around 1% of the population, it is about four times as large as it would be if
the mitigation strategy started 21 days earlier.
Figures 6 features the results for Case D. Despite an extra delay of one week
with respect to Case C, it is still possible to flatten the curve and prevent an
uncontrollable increase of the epidemic. Nonetheless, the extra week produces
a peak of infections five times as large as in Case C, with 5% of people being
infected 107 days after the outset of the epidemic. The total removed population
skyrockets from about 17% in Case C to about 90% in Case D, thus reinforcing

the importance of early mitigation to prevent the spread of the disease and
the exponential effect of extra delays in the system. Observe that, due to the
spread of the disease and the corresponding decrease in the number of susceptible
individuals, we are able to slowly relax the mitigation until the disease has
contaminated about 50% of the population. As the disease spreads further, we
are able to rapidly relax the mitigation whilst still maintaining a steady decrease
in the number of infected individuals. The mitigation is completely lifted just
before the second anniversary of the outset of the epidemic.
Figure 7 shows the results for Case E that provide further evidence of the
deleterious effect of mitigation delay. A further delay of one week with respect
to Case D results in approximately three times as many infected individuals
at the peak, that occurs on day 114 and amounts to around 14% of infected
individuals. Due to the larger peak, we are able to relax the mitigation earlier
and more rapidly, reaching a full relaxation just after seven months. However,
since there are still susceptible individuals in the population, mitigation has to
re-start from day 396 onwards to avoid a recrudescence of the epidemic. The

Case F illustrates the increasingly reduced flexibility that results from a
belated mitigation. Observe in Figure 8 that the overall effect of the mitigation
is limited. Although we are able to halve the peak of infections with respect to
the unmitigated epidemic (Case A), with the total of simultaneous infections
peaking at 31% by day 121, the evolution of the epidemic still resembles the
unmitigated case. High levels of control are demanded at the beginning of
the mitigation period to contain the spike in infections. Still, as the removed
population reaches about 50%, the mitigation is dropped because the bulk of the
population is either removed, infected or exposed. The disease then stabilises,
but because 1% of the population is still susceptible, enforced mitigation is
necessary again to avoid another spike of the epidemic around day 250.

Finally, Figure 9 presents the results for Case G, which demonstrate that
delaying the mitigation by 126 days effectively renders it meaningless. Indeed,
on day 126, the uncontrolled epidemic is so widespread that the infection levels
are already dropping due to a small number of susceptible individuals remaining
in the population. The infection reaches its peak on day 129 when the infection

20

simultaneously afflicts approximately 64% of the population.
4.2. The effect of distinct occupation rates
This Section investigates the effect of distinct target occupation rates ρ̄ in the
stabilising policies. To provide an interesting baseline, we start our mitigating
actions on t̄ = 105, when the epidemic reaches a significant proportion of the
population but can still be controlled as in Case E of Figure 7. The set of
experiments in Table 6 assesses the effect of varying the target occupation level
from 60% to 90% in regular intervals. To account for the stochastic fluctuations
and prevent biases, Figures 10 to 13 show the median of 100 realisations of the
stochastic system within a two-year interval.

Figure 10 presents the results for Case H. As one can observe, the number
of infected people peaks around 18% on day 114. As expected, the stronger
mitigation has no effect in the early stages and is not able to prevent a similar
peak as in the baseline (Case E). However, as time elapses we can notice that the
increased mitigation produces a much more pronounced decrease in infections.
In effect, infections drop to about 2% by day 200 and 1% on the 231th day. The
increased control is able to keep the removed population at about 52% at the
end of two years, whereas that level was 97.5% in the baseline. It is noteworthy
that the mitigation is kept at a high level after the system stabilises to avoid
recrudescence.
The results for Case I are shown in Figure 11. The increase in the target
occupation rate ρ̄ with respect to Case H has several noticeable effects: a slight
decrease in the mitigating actions; a slower rate of decrease of the infection

levels and an increase of the removed population. The infection levels decrease
to 3% on day 200 and 72 days later reach 1%. The reduced control levels also
lead to an increase in the removed population, that climbs from 52% in Case H
to about 63% in Case I.
The trend of increasing infection levels gathers speed in Case J, as the decrease in the required mitigating actions leads to about 93% of removals within
the two-year horizon. On day 200, the number of infections reaches 5% of the
population, and 117 days later it reaches 1%. Coupled with the significant decrease in the susceptible population, which reduces the potential spread, the
decrease in ρ̄ produces a steep decrease in the control levels. These reach a minimum of 5% as the susceptible population starts to stabilise. However, increased
levels of mitigation are required later to avoid a second wave.
Finally, Figure 13 presents the results for Case K. As the target occupation
level approaches that of the baseline (Case E), the overall behaviour becomes
quite similar. We can notice a small decrease in the overall removals, that reach
about 3.5% as opposed to 2.5% in the baseline. Despite dropping mitigating

4.3. The effect of on-off lock-down policies
This Section briefly evaluates the effect of on-off lock-down policies. Proposed by Tarrataca et al. (2021), these policies demand a full scale lock-down
(u(t) = 1, ρ̄ = 0) when the number of infections surpass a prescribed upper
limit; conversely, all measures are lifted (u(t) = 0, ρ̄ = ∞) as soon as these
numbers drop below a lower bound. We simulate the two policies whose upper
and lower bounds appear in Table 7.

Figure 14: Epidemic evolution for Case L

Figure 14 shows that Case L features 12 lock-downs in two years, the first
starting on day 99. Infections recurrently exceed the upper bound in Table 7 and
peak around 4% on day 108; the removed population amounts to 52% at the end
of the second year. Consistently with the results reported by Tarrataca et al.
(2021), the system alternates between rapid increases and decreases in infection
and the lock-downs become shorter and more spaced over time.
A similar behaviour is observed in Figure 15 for Case M. But because the
upper and lower bounds are larger, the total number of removals increases from
52% to 74% in two years. In addition, the peak of infections observed on day
110 increases to 6%. Although Case M has 2 more lock-downs in two years,
the total time in lock-down is similar, as illustrated in Figure 16, which shows
the cumulative time in lock-down on the left hand side and the duration of
individual lock-downs on the opposite half. The mean duration of a lock-down
is about 23 days in case L and 21 days in case M, whereas the mean interval

5. Conclusions
Inspired by the unprecedented COVID-19 epidemic, this paper explored innovative stochastic modelling alternatives to describe the evolution of an epidemic by means of the classical SEIR framework. The proposed model innovates
26

by simultaneously addressing general infection and latency periods, whilst the
original methodology ensures that the resulting continuous-time Markov model
remains tractable and useful to support decision making.
By drawing a parallel between stochastic stability and the traditional reproduction number, the paper introduced stabilising strategies that can curb an
epidemic under very general conditions, provided that the mitigation is initiated in a timely manner. Beyond the academic contributions, we argue that the
generality of the proposed approach renders it invaluable to support real-world
decision making in the face of future epidemics. The methodology was validated
using COVID-19 data from the literature. The results provide a panorama of
insights into the pros and cons of distinct stabilising mitigation strategies over
a two-year horizon.
As expected, the experiments illustrate that early intervention is vital to
prevent the disease from affecting a large portion of the population. However,
to effectively prevent the spread, we need very high levels of mitigation over
the whole two-year horizon. The results also suggest that delayed mitigation
leads to a dramatic increase in the overall number of infections. In effect, delays
tend to produce persistent infection levels over time, even in the presence of
mitigation, thereby increasing the spread even though the infection curves are
effectively flattened. Beyond flattening the curves, this behaviour suggests that
we also need to ensure, by acting swiftly, that their summit is tolerable from
both societal and health care perspectives.
The proposed approach leaves many research avenues to be explored in future
works. One obvious route is to pursue stochastic optimal control policies that
somehow address the compromise between health care aspects, societal issues
and the economic burden of mitigation strategies. The challenges involve finding
a meaningful trade-off among the different elements that decision-makers need
to consider, as well as proposing effective formulations that avoid the curse of dimensionality (Powell, 2011, 2019) to ensure that the problem remains tractable.
Another branch goes into developing filtering and analytical approaches to estimate a system’s parameters considering that the available information is delayed
27

and biased, since dependent on local testing and reporting policies.
