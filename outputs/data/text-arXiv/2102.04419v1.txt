Abstract
The recent outbreak of the COVID-19 shocked humanity leading to the death of millions of people worldwide. To stave off the spread of the virus, the authorities in the
US, employed different strategies including the mask mandate (MM) order issued by
the states’ governors. Although most of the previous studies pointed in the direction
that MM can be effective in hindering the spread of viral infections, the effectiveness
of MM in reducing the degree of exposure to the virus and, consequently, death rates
remains indeterminate. Indeed, the extent to which the degree of exposure to COVID19 takes part in the lethality of the virus remains unclear. In the current work, we
defined a parameter called the average death ratio as the monthly average of the ratio
of the number of daily deaths to the total number of daily cases. We utilized survey
data provided by New York Times to quantify people’s abidance to the MM order. Additionally, we implicitly addressed the extent to which people abide by the MM order

1

that may depend on some parameters like population, income, and political inclination. Using different machine learning classification algorithms we investigated how
the decrease or increase in death ratio for the counties in the US West Coast correlates
with the input parameters. Our results showed a promising score as high as 0.94 with
algorithms like XGBoost, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes. To verify the model, the
best performing algorithms were then utilized to analyze other states (Arizona, New
Jersey, New York and Texas) as test cases. The findings show an acceptable trend,
further confirming usability of the chosen features for prediction of similar cases.

Introduction

The recent pandemic of COVID-19 has affected millions of peoples worldwide and led to the
tragic death of many innocent lives. The lack of a certain treatment at the beginning of pandemic traumatized populace and the only solutions were limited to preventive actions such as
wearing face coverings, maintaining social distancing, washing hands, and self-quarantine.
Owing to the high transmission rate, only in the US, the number of new daily cases increased from 6 to 22562 during March 2020 according to CDC (Center for Disease Control
and Prevention) [1]. There is still extensive ongoing research about the possible factors being
effective in the pace of this spread; as of now, scientists have declared that meteorological
factors such as temperature, wind speed, precipitation and humidity are some of the important environmental parameters in this regard [2]. However, most of the parameters involved
in the spread of COVDID-19 are out of our control. As a result, state officials began to
impose legislative guidelines including mandatory use of masks and closure of businesses
such as bars and restaurants. Shutting down different businesses has been sporadic due to
its adverse economic impact, but obligatory face coverings order is still in effect across the
US. In this respect, the effectiveness of facial masks gains further importance and requires
scientific studies.

Presenting a model that can measure the effectiveness of the mask mandate orders can
pave the way for governments to take decisive actions during pandemics. The experimental
data in tandem with mathematical modelings can be utilized to study the effects of facial
coverings on the spread of viral infections. A plethora of previous publications have tried
to address the effectiveness of nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) during pandemics,
particularly for the spread of influenza [3,4]. Deterministic models have been widely used to
study the effects of facial masks on the reproduction number R0 . Indeed, the face mask is
taken into account by its role in reducing the transmission per contact [5]. The results of the
deterministic model indicated that public use of face masks delays the influenza pandemic.
On the other hand, some studies suggest that the use of a face mask does not have a substantial effect on influenza transmission and there is little evidence in favor of the effectiveness
of facial masks [6, 7]. As for the COVID-19, the efficacy of the facial mask in impeding the
infectivity of the SARS-CoV-2 remains unclear. Having considered the effects of mask in
reproduction number R0 , Li et al. [8] claimed that wearing face masks alongside the social
distancing can flatten the epidemic curve. Other studies also pinpointed that public use of
a facial mask may contribute to the reduction in spread of COVID-19 [9]. Despite these
findings, the efficacy of face masks remains controversial.

The cardinal point that has not garnered enough attention is the relationship between the
degree of exposure to the virus and its mortality rate. The idea that the severity of the
symptoms correlates with the extent of exposure to the COVID-19 was presented by some
researchers to justify the high death rate in healthcare workers [10]. Unfortunately, there is
not a universal trend that can predict the relationship between the dose of the virus and the
severity of the resulting symptoms. A study performed on the relationship between influenza
and rhinovirus viral load, and the severity in the upper respiratory tract infections reported
a different behavior for those viruses [11]. In fact, the results indicated that for influenza A
and the rhinovirus, viral loads were not associated with hospitalization/ICU. On the other

3

hand, for influenza B, viral load was higher in hospitalized/ICU patients. Furthermore, for
Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), viral load seems to correlate with the severity of symptoms as many studies in the literature suggest that a correlation exists [12–14]. The same
controversy holds for the COVID-19. Recently, some studies have tried to investigate the
severity of COVID-19 with its load, where they found that the load tightly correlates with
the severity [15, 16]. However, another study suggests that no such a correlation exists [17].

To unveil whether COVID-19 viral load is related to disease severity requires an in-depth
study, which involves infecting volunteers with controlled doses of virus and monitoring their
symptoms. However, experimental challenges in addition to the ethicality of these experiments make this type of studies very challenging at this point [10]. Although studies have
not been convergent in whether nose [18] or mouth [19] is the primary site for COVID-19
infection, they underscored the importance of wearing a facial mask as a barrier to the virus
spread. Additionally, although the protection level of different types of mask are different, wearing any mask even a cloth mask is better than wearing nothing at all, which can
play a role in protection from the exposure to COVID-19 [20, 21]. Given the challenges of
the experimental studies on the relationship between the extent of exposure and severity of
COVID-19, one way to study whether the extent to which an individual is exposed to the
COVID-19 correlates with the severity of the symptoms is to introduce a model that can
capture changes in the mortality rate due to the wearing a facial mask. Indeed, if the ratio of
the number of death to the number of cases decreases, this can support the hypothesis that
there is a correlation between the viral load and the severity of symptoms. Thus, studying
the effects of MM order on the mortality rate gains extra importance.

An ML analysis can be very useful to shed light on the possible correlation between the
public use of mask and changes in the mortality rate. The success of implementing Machine
Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques in the previous pandemic has con-

4

vinced researchers to use them as precious tools in fighting against the current outbreak
[22]. ML and AI can be used for prediction and forecasting in different regions so that the
corresponding health officials can take essential actions in advance [22]. In addition, this
technology is capable of enhancing the prediction accuracy for screening both infectious and
non-infectious diseases [23]. Six ML methods have been carried out to predict 1, 3, and 6
days ahead the total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases with error ranges of 0.87%–3.51%,
1.02%–5.63%, and 0.95%–6.90%, respectively, in 10 Brazilian states [24]. Moreover, an ML
method like XGBoost model was capable of identifying 3 important biomarkers from 485
blood samples in Wuhan, China as the key mortality parameters [25]. ML algorithms also
have been used to capture the correlation between the weather data, and COVID-19 mortality and transmission rates [26,27]. Additionally, ML has been utilized to study the effects
of MM order on the number of daily cases, where no significant statistical difference was
observed in the number of daily cases in state-wise analysis [28]. These studies confirm the
strength of ML as a great tool to investigate the effects of MM order on mortality rates of
COVID-19.

Another important factor regarding the effectiveness of MM order is society’s adherence
to the regulations. One study that tried to quantify public compliance with COVID-19
public health recommendations found notable regional differences in intent to follow health
guidelines [29]. Some studies noticed a correlation between level of education and intent
to voluntarily adhere to social distancing guidelines [29, 30]. However, not only the level
of education but also level of income, race and political orientation can play a role in the
adherence to the regulations [31]. Based on these findings, it’s important to take into account the features that might be correlated with people’s compliance with the MM order.
Additionally, we will use a data based on the survey provided by New York times available
on Github, which quantifies people’s adherence to the MM order [32]. As a result, in this
study, we will include factors that might play a role in people’s adherence to the MM order

5

as our input features.

In the proposed work, utilizing different ML classification algorithms, we aim to unveil
how the change in the mortality rate correlates with certain features. The features will be
chosen in a way that they can reflect abidance by MM order in different counties. We will
use the data provided by CDC to find the average monthly number of COVID-19 cases. Additionally, the exact dates of the executive orders signed by the state officials are available
for each state. To have appropriate unbiased data, similar to what Maloney et al. [28] has
done in his study of the effect of mask mandate, we will be using the data for one month
after and before the executive orders for each preventive measure for the three states in US
West Coast. Indeed, with this data selection method, we limit the geographical region of the
study to ensure that changes in the cases are highly attributed to the public use of masks
rather than other factors such as environmental changes.

As a verification of the proposed work, the best performing algorithms are further chosen with
the calculated hyper-parameters for testing four additional states (Arizona, New Jersey, New
York and Texas). The findings demonstrate an acceptable accuracy scores, which justifies
the correlation of the chosen features with the effect of COVID-19.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. First, we will represent how our data was
collected and arranged. Then we will explicate the ML methods we have used for our
prediction. Finally, we will represent and compare the results obtained from different ML
methods.

Methodology

In this section, we will explain the collected data and the ML algorithms used for the training
and prediction.

2.1

Data

We defined the parameter of interest as the average ratio of the number of deaths to the
total number of cases, referred to as the death ratio, which can be interpreted as a measure
of the severity of the disease. The effective date of the executive orders by the governors,
requiring mask mandate at all the counties in the three West Coast states of California,
Oregon and Washington has been identified, which is publicly available [33]. We used the
average death ratio one month before and after the order to study the mortality rate. The
rationale behind this selection is to minimize the effects of other factors that might play role
in changing the COVID-19 data. The raw dataset for the daily cases and deaths for all the
US counties over time is extracted from the USAFACTS website [34], where county-level
data is confirmed by the state and local agencies directly. After obtaining the daily values of
death and case numbers for a month before and after the MM order, we divided the monthly
average number of deaths by the monthly average number of cases for each county. Then we
found the difference between the death ratio for one month before and after the MM order.
Finally, we categorized the variation based on its sign to quantify whether the death ratio
increases, decreases, or no change occurs. Out of the 130 samples, 47, 30, and 53 of them
belong to the ”decrease”, ”increase”, and ”no change” classes, respectively. We dropped the
”no change” data as they all correspond to small counties, where there were zero reported
COVID-19 cases and deaths, leaving 77 counties in total. Consequently, the two categories of
increase (denoted by class 0) and decrease (shown by class 1) are remained for the prediction
task. A histogram of the output classes is shown in the Fig. (1), which expresses that the
data is not biased.

Figure 1: Histogram of change in death ratio for the three states

Since it is not known exactly what percentage of population follows the MM order and
use face coverings, it is necessary to come up with features that can capture how likely is
an individual to follow the recommended practice. For bridging this gap, four main features
are chosen as primary indicators which are listed below:
1. County Population
2. Median Household Income
3. Political Inclination
4. Mask Usage based on New York Times Survey
Population in each county is obtained from the most recent surveys for the year 2019. The
income level is the median household in each county in the years 2015-2019. The raw data
for these features is all obtained from the US Census website [35]. The US Census measures
the median income as the regular income received excluding other payments like tax, etc
[36]. The data for the political inclination is constructed based on the 2020 US presidential
election results [37]. This feature has been converted to the categorical type in a vectorized
8

manner, i.e. the winner takes the value of 1 in the column, and the opponent takes 0 in their
own. Furthermore, we used a survey data, provided by the New York Times, that quantifies
the mask usage from 7/2/2020 to 7/14/2020 [32]. Since the survey timeline lies within the
month after the MM order for all three studied states, it is valid to use its data for our
purpose. Finally, we will try to establish an AI-based relationship between the features and
the death ratios of the Pacific Coast states at the county level using 9 different classification
algorithms, provided in section 2.2.

2.2

Methods

In this study, we have developed machine learning models to correlate the specified features
mentioned in section 2.1 with the aim of shedding light on the relationship between adherence
to mask mandate and mortality rate.
Classic ML methods of Logistic Regression [38] and Naive Bayes classifier [39] are used. In
addition, ensemble learning-based models, Random Forest and Extra Trees, are also analyzed
[40]. Moreover, the extreme boosting method, XGBoost is explored [41]. Other methods
such as Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbors [42], Decision Trees [43], and Neural
Network [44] are additionally used for prediction of effect of Mask Mandate on mortality
rate.
It should be noted that for carrying out the analysis, the data is split into training and test
sets, with a test size of 20%. A k-fold cross validation scheme with 5 folds has been used to
evaluate the performance of each method on the validation set and tune its hyper-parameters
with the classification accuracy as the metric accordingly. The hyper-parameter tuning is
done using either grid search or random search for all the methods. A statistical summary
of the final dataset for the purpose of binary classification is outlined in the table 1, which
indicates a large difference between the orders of magnitudes of the features. Therefore,
min-max and max-abs scaling have been used to transform the input features and output,
respectively, before passing the data to the ML algorithms for training.

Results and Discussions

The change in death ratio from one month before to one month after the date of mandating
face-covering in the three states is visualized for each county in Fig.(2). Two clusters of
increase in death ratio can be seen, one near northern Washington, and one near central
California. Our first intuition was that by increasing population, the chance of viral spread
would increase, and therefore we expected to see a positive change in death ratio for more
populated counties. However, as it can be seen from the map, there is an inherent randomness
which defies our initial intuition about the spread mechanism. Further, it is shown that more
counties experienced a decrease in death ratio one month after the usage of face-covering was
mandated by each state, as shown in Fig. (1). Therefore, usage of face-covering is chosen as
the main factor affecting the decrease of the change in death ratio. As explained previously,
to quantify adherence to the mask mandate, other auxiliary features are chosen, namely,
population, median income, and political inclination for each county.
As a preliminary analysis, political inclination, based on the result of the 2020 presidential
election, is chosen as the focal criterion to categorize the data for changes of death ratio for
all three states, as presented in Fig. (3). Fig. 3(a) shows that in general, communities that
voted republican in presidential election of 2020 were affected worse compared to democratic
10

counties. Further, a noticeable correlation is observed between average median income and
the change of death ratio, presented in Fig. 3(b). It is shown that, on average, the communities with less median income experienced a positive change in death ratio, meaning more
mortality rate regardless of their political inclination. The strongest correlation however is
observed by considering county population, shown in Fig. 3(c). The counties with fewer
residents were affected more adversely by the pandemic compared to high-population counties. The counter intuitive relation between population and change in death ratio further
corroborates necessity of inclusion of the two other supplementary features.

Figure 2: Change in death ratio in US West Coast states counties
To have an initial assessment of the variation of percent change in the death ratio, we
plotted the percent death ratio as functions of population, median income, and percent of
the population that frequently uses mask, which has a relatively high correlation coefficient.
Fig 4 a-c shows no detectable pattern between parameters of interest and death ratio. As a
result, it is not possible to predict the value of change in the death ratio using regression. On
the other hand, as we will show, converting changes to categories of increase and decrease

would pave the way for capturing the status of change. A summary of the overall death
rates in the months before and after the mask mandate order for the 3 states is presented in
table 2. It can be observed that change in death ratio significantly decreases in California
and Washington, but slightly increases in Oregon. This suggests an intrinsically complex
pattern between the death rate as the desired output and the selected inputs. According
to a recent study, there is a number of factors attributing to the possibility of a person to
follow or not follow the health guidelines set by the state officials [31]. Three features among
these parameters plus the mask usage as the fourth feature have been used to conduct the
current study.
Using the obtained data, the combined effect of features is analyzed on the death ratio. Then

the performance of each algorithm is evaluated for test and train sets. The effect of each
feature on the change of death ratio is visualized by the correlation heatmap provided in the
figure 5. Each row of the correlation matrix is an appropriate indicator of how correlated
that feature is with change in death ratio. A more negative value implies that increase of that
specific feature is positively correlated by a decrease in change of death ratio. For instance,
increase in population, median income, and votes for democratic party would result in a
decrease in change of death ratio. On the other hand, the positive correlation for republican
votes leads to a higher change of positive increase in death ratio. An interesting observation
13

is the disordered correlation pattern for mask usage. It can be seen that, as one expects,
increasing the number never and rarely mask users is positively correlated with change in
death ratio. However, the data associated with frequently mask users have resulted in a
positive correlation value. Such erratic correlation behavior necessitates inclusion of other
features in the analysis.

All implemented algorithms in this study are capable of providing us with high classification
accuracy i.e, to predict whether a county has experienced a decrease in its death ratios or an
increase. As provided in Table (3), it can be seen that in general, most of the algorithms have
relatively high accuracy scores for both training and test sets. The lowest accuracy comes
from neural net algorithm with a score of 63% for the test set. This could be a result of the
low sample data set. In general, neural network would incrementally increase in accuracy by
providing more training data set. In our case, we were limited by the existing data.
Despite the lack of sufficient training data set, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and XGBoost
have an accuracy of 94%. The selected hyper-parameters for XGBoost and Random Forest
classifiers are shown in table 4. The random search method has been done to tune these
hyper-parameters for XGBoost, and grid search is used for Random Forest. Naive Bayes does

Using the calculated hyper-parameters from the best performing algorithms, it would be
possible to predict effect of similar viral illnesses in future. To verify the legibility of the proposed work, the best performing algorithms (Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and XGBoost),
were chosen with the computed hyper-parameters to process the data for four additional
states, namely, Arizona, New Jersey, New York, and Texas. For choosing states for testing
purposes, three main criteria were considered: (i ) availability of data provided by NY Times
survey (ii ) population (iii ) versatility of death rate ratio. The NY Times mask usage survey
is only available for the time period of interest, July 2nd -14th ; therefore, the month after the
15

corresponding MM order should contain this period for validity of our analysis. The chosen
states all have high population. Lastly, Arizona, New Jersey, and New York all experienced
a negative change of death ratio, while Texas suffered significant losses in the month after
the MM was placed, as shown in the Table (5). Inclusion of cases with extreme positive and
negative change of death ratio was done deliberately to assay functionality of the selected algorithms. The accuracy score for the processed algorithms on these four states are presented
in the Table (6).

It should be noted that the results of the three west coast states were chosen as training data
set. The entire data from the four states is treated as test data set. Hence, it is expected
for the accuracy score to drop for testing the additional states. However, the trend of high
accuracy for train and test data sets, signifies the existence of a pattern between the chosen
features and the change in death ratio.
For instance, against the common belief that highly populated areas might experience harsher
effect of COVID-19, in the west coast of the United States, the areas with lower population endured worse conditions. Further, the result of this work would further signify the
importance of political leadership in guiding communities and ensuring the well-being of the
general public. Additionally, such a modeling approach could be used to optimize distribu16

tion of services and media coverage for possible future adversities. A possible solution for
decreasing effect of future pandemics such as COVID-19 would be improving media coverage
and public knowledge, especially in more vulnerable areas.

Conclusion

In this body of work, we have analyzed the effect of mask covering on the intensity of
spread of the COVID-19 virus by considering the death ratio at the county level to be the
primary indicator. To bridge the gap between level of adherence to mask mandate, four main
features are used as input data, population, income, political inclination, and the results of
the survey on mask usage from New York Times. The change in the death ratio is used as
the metric to quantify the effectiveness of face-coverings on the COVID-19 spread. After
extracting and refining the data-set from reliable sources, we analyzed the information using
9 different algorithms. Among all the methods used, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Naive
Bayes had the best performance with a classification accuracy of 94%. The high performing
algorithms, with the computed hyper-parameters, are then used to process four additional
states, Arizona, New Jersey, New York, and Texas entirely used as test data set. The
acceptable accuracy results for the large test case, further verifies legibility of the chosen
features as influential criteria for modeling purposes. The obtained hyper-parameters for
these models (except for Naive Bayes) can now be used to predict future conditions of the
spread of the virus.
It is shown that, in most of the counties, there exist a connection between adherence to the
mask mandate and change in death ratio. The findings of this work emphasizes importance
of immediate legislative action on well-being of societies. It is hoped that the findings of this
work, highlight importance of socioeconomic and political settings on behavior of different
communities, which as portrayed could be complex and counter-intuitive. For instance, if the
mask mandate had been issued earlier, with better implementation procedures along with

17

effective incentives targetted at specific communities, more people would be encouraged to
abide by the issued ordinance, and consequently, fewer individuals and families would have
become the victim of the pandemic.
