Abstract—As a result of the worldwide transmission of severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has evolved into an unprecedented pandemic. Currently, with unavailable pharmaceutical
treatments and vaccines, this novel coronavirus results in a great
impact on public health, human society, and global economy,
which is likely to last for many years. One of the lessons learned
from the COVID-19 pandemic is that a long-term system with
non-pharmaceutical interventions for preventing and controlling
new infectious diseases is desirable to be implemented. Internet
of things (IoT) platform is preferred to be utilized to achieve
this goal, due to its ubiquitous sensing ability and seamless
connectivity. IoT technology is changing our lives through smart
healthcare, smart home, and smart city, which aims to build a
more convenient and intelligent community. This paper presents
how the IoT could be incorporated into the epidemic prevention
and control system. Specifically, we demonstrate a potential
fog-cloud combined IoT platform that can be used in the
systematic and intelligent COVID-19 prevention and control,
which involves five interventions including COVID-19 Symptom
Diagnosis, Quarantine Monitoring, Contact Tracing & Social
Distancing, COVID-19 Outbreak Forecasting, and SARS-CoV-2
Mutation Tracking. We investigate and review the state-of-the-art
literatures of these five interventions to present the capabilities
of IoT in countering against the current COVID-19 pandemic or
future infectious disease epidemics.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a human infectious illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [1]. SARS-CoV-2 has been
spreading all across the world in 213 countries, which results
in over 18 million cases of COVID-19 illness as of August
2020 [2]. So far, the COVID-19 pandemic situation is not
optimistic due to many factors including the unfulfilled vaccine
and unavailable pharmaceutical treatment for COVID-19. The
spreading control of COVID-19 mainly depends on the duration of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and the non-pharmaceutical
interventions (NPIs) [3], such as contact tracing, quarantine,
and social distancing. On the one hand, the duration of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is still a mystery, which requires more
longitudinal studies to figure out. However, it has been known
that the immunity to other coronaviruses (e.g, SARS-CoV and
MERS-CoV) gradually wanes over time and the coronavirus
reinfections exist [4]. Similarly, the immunity to SARS-CoV-2

is highly possible to be short-term instead of permanent. Based
on the prediction from Harvard Public Health School [3], the
COVID-19 outbreaks would occur recurrently and regularly if
the immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is not permanent. Even if it is
permanent, SARS-CoV-2 could be spreading for many years.
On the other hand, the non-pharmaceutical interventions do
contribute to mitigating the severity of COVID-19 epidemics.
A study [3] estimates that social distancing could successfully
yield a 60% reduction of COVID-19 infections [3]. The
combined non-pharmaceutical interventions, involving selfisolation and public events banning, have effectively controlled the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in some regions like
Europe [5] and China [6]. Although the non-pharmaceutical
interventions are particularly important to COVID-19 prevention and control, it is worth noticing that these interventions
probably have profound influence on the economy and society
[7]. Also, the interventions, such as prolonged self-isolation
and complete city lockdown, have impacts on people’s both
physical [8] and mental health [9]. It is thus highly desirable
to build a more intelligent and systematic implementation of
non-pharmaceutical interventions to ensure effective COVID19 control with the minimal possible impacts on our lives and
society.
Meanwhile, our living environments are increasingly covered by various sensors inside everyday objects. Internet of
Things (IoT) technology seamlessly integrates them into the
online network and enable them to operate automatically
without manual efforts [10]. It is reported that in 2019, 26.66
billion IoT devices are utilized and the number will be increased to 35 billion in 2020 [11]. Due to the powerful sensing
capability of ubiquitous IoT devices, human features, such as
health condition [12], activities [13] and vital signs [14], can
be captured and analyzed spontaneously in the IoT platform.
Moreover, the immense data produced by IoT networks can
be further explored to perform event prediction using big
data analytics and machine/deep learning [15]. Thus, with the
support of IoT infrastructures accompanied by other emerging
technologies (e.g., artificial intelligence (AI), fog computing,
and big data), it is feasible to extend the COVID-19 NPIs into
our daily lives to achieve intelligent and effective prevention
and control. In this paper, we review an intelligent IoT-based
platform for COVID-19 prevention and control that can be
used in both the COVID-19 pandemic and post-pandemic
periods. Specifically, this IoT platform involves three NPIs
including COVID-19 Symptom Diagnosis, Quarantine Monitoring, and Contact Tracing & Social Distancing in a fog
layer. In a cloud layer, another two NPIs are implemented in
the IoT platform, including COVID-19 Outbreak Forecasting

In this section, we introduce a proposed Fog-Cloud-IoT
platform for COVID-19 Prevention and Control. As illustrated
in Fig. 2, we adopt a hierarchical computing architecture,
which involves four layers including perception layer, network
layer, fog layer, and cloud layer. In the first perception layer,
it consists of various IoT sensors which are implemented
in an individual, home/hospital environment, or outdoor environment to gather all kinds of information, such as vital
signs or symptoms of individuals and human activities. Next,
the sensing data is transmitted through a certain networking
technology, such as WiFi, 4G/5G cellular, and satellite. Then,
distributed fog nodes are deployed with network connections.
The fog nodes can be some physical devices (e.g., LANconnected processor) that are capable of computing and are
close to the IoT sensors, which minimizes the latency of
real-time data analysis. Therefore, in the fog layer, we can
implement time-sensitive NPIs including Quarantine Monitor-

ing and Contact Tracing & Social Distancing. Finally, all the
data streams are fed into a centralized cloud server that has
more powerful computing capability. In the cloud layer, we
can perform the complex event prediction using sophisticated
machining/deep learning algorithms and big data analysis,
where two NPIs including COVID-19 Outbreak Forecasting
and SARS-CoV-2 Mutation Tracking are implemented.
A. Perception Layer
The perception layer involves various devices that sense
the surrounding environment and individuals. We specifically
describe details of data acquisition in the perception layer by
using common IoT sensors. These IoT sensors are frequently
investigated in non-clinical healthcare and human activity
sensing.
1) Camera: Camera is a very common and key senor
in mobile devices and IoT devices. By using the camera,
image and video data can be captured and analyzed for
various applications, such as non-contacting monitoring and
recognition of human activities [16].
2) Inertial Sensor: Inertial sensors, equipped in the mobile
devices and wearable devices, are the sensors based on inertia
and relevant measuring principles [17], including accelerometer and gyroscope. Accelerometer, is used for measuring acceleration along three axes. By deriving the 3-axis acceleration
measurements, it is able to detect the dynamic forces of the device, including gravity, vibrations, and movement. Gyroscope
is another type of inertial sensors, which is conceptually a
spinning wheel with the 3-axis of rotation. It can lead to the
measurement of orientation and its rate of change, which tells
us how much the device is tilted. Human behavior attributes
can be derived from the readings of inertial sensors.
3) Magnetometer: Magnetometer is another key sensor in
IoT devices, which can detect the magnetic fields along three
perpendicular axes. It is originally used to detect the orientation of the device. Recent researches show that magnetic fields
contain spatial information, which can be exploited to estimate
distances between devices based magnetic measurements [18].
Therefore, the magnetometers are studied to perform proximity
sensing, which usually serves as a proxy for applications of
contact tracing and social distancing.

4) Microphone: Microphone basically is an acoustic sensor
that detects and measures ambient sound signals. Current IoT
devices typically equip the microphone with micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) technology, which offers a small
footprint/thickness, a high signal to noise ratio (SNR), and
lower power consumption. Many researches utilize microphones to sense ambient sounds for activity recognition [19],
[20]. Moreover, microphones are used in conjunction with
speakers, where speakers transmit the deigned acoustic signals
and the reflected signals are received by microphones used to
analyze Doppler shifts for detecting human activities [21].
5) Commodity WiFi: Researchers use two main measurements of WiFi, received signal strength indicator (RSSI), and
channel state information (CSI), to facilitate sensing tasks.
First, RSSI characterizes the attenuation of WiFi signals during
propagation [22]. When people have activities in a WiFi
environment, they create perturbations of RSSI, which can
be used as the fingerprints of different human activities. But
RSSI is coarse-grained and unstable, which is easily affected
by the environment changes. Thus, the fine-grained PHY layer
channel state information (CSI) of WiFi signals is recently
utilized for sensing tasks [23].
6) mmWave Radar: mmWave radar is also explored to
achieve non-invasive and non-contacting sensing. mmWave
radar can modulate the transmitting wireless signals to sweep
across a certain frequency band (i.e., frequency modulated
continuous wave) and then derive the object movements based
on the phase information of reflected signals from objects [24].
The mmWave radar is robust to environmental changes. For
example, light and sound cannot affect its sensing performance. Since it is capable of precisely modulating the transmitting wireless signals, the mmWave radar is increasingly
installed in IoT devices to achieve higher accuracy for activity
recognition [25].

7) Radio Frequency Identification (RFID): RFID is a wireless communications technology that allows recognition of
a specific target by radio signals. RFID consists of three
components that are a reader, an antenna, and a tag. The
antenna is connected to the reader and is used to transmit
radio signals between the tag and the reader. The reader is
used to read and recognize the signals from the tag. The
tag is composed of a coupling element, a chip, and a tiny
antenna, which is used to receive the radio signals from the
reader and antenna. Each tag has a unique electronic code
inside and is attached to the object to identify the target object.
RFID is widely applied in healthcare [26] and human activity
recognition [27].
B. Network Layer
The network layer is responsible for transferring information data or instructions in the perception layer to the whole
IoT platform. The information transmission relies on the public
or private network with the wireless or wired communications
mode, which includes 4G/5G cellar networks, WiFi networks,
and satellite networks.
C. Fog Layer
Fog computing is a promising technology introduced by
Cisco [28], which is closer to the physical IoT sensors at
the network edge comparing with cloud computing and thus
brings lower latency for data processing. In the fog layer,
the data of IoT devices would be transferred into the corresponding fog node for real-time analysis. The fog node can
be the devices that are capable of computing, storage, and
network connectivity, such as embedded servers or routers.
Fog nodes are not powerful servers, but a set of low-end and
decentralized devices with various functionalities, which is

Breathing monitoring is thus very important in clinical applications. Traditional breathing measurements require hospital
visits and professional medical devices attached to the human
body, which is not convenient for individuals in need. With
the advancement of IoT technologies, breathing monitoring are
becoming pervasive and ubiquitous. Many studies use various
IoT sensors, such as inertial sensor [29]–[31], camera [32]–
[39], microphone [40]–[43], mmWave radar [44]–[47], and
WiFi [48]–[51], to continuously monitor breathing activities
in both indoor and outdoor environments.
Hernandez et al. [29] propose a system named BioWatch,
which uses the accelerometer and gyroscope of wrist-mounted
devices (e.g, smartwatch) to measure both heart rates and
breathing rates. BioWatch exploits a bandpass digit filter with
fixed cut-off frequencies of 0.13 Hz and 0.66 Hz to extract
the breathing signal from the wrist motion data measured by
inertial sensors. Tian et al. [30] further improve the robustness

and laptop-based breathing monitoring system to constantly
record breathing information. Recently, Wang et al. [39]
propose to use deep neural networks to model the breathing
data from depth cameras to recognize the six types of COVID19 breathing patterns like Eupnea and Tachypnea.
Although camera-based approaches can achieve noncontacting breathing monitoring, they are constrained by
the lighting conditions. Therefore, some studies [40]–[42]
explore breathing patterns from breathing sounds recorded
by microphones. For example, the microphone embedded in
smartphones or headsets [40] is used to capture the breathing
sounds when users place the microphone around the head.
Similarly, Martin et al. [41] propose to use in-ear microphone
to recover the breathing waveform from breathing sounds and
also apply a normalized least mean squared adaptive filter to
eliminate ambient noises. With regard to diagnosing COVID19 breathing patterns, Faezipour et al. [43] use breathing
sounds acquired from smartphones to distinguish healthy and
unhealthy users based on machine learning models.

Recently, more studies focus on using radio frequency (RF)
sensing techniques to monitor breathing motions based on
radar and WiFi. Petkie et al. [44] use a continuous-wave
(CW) based Doppler radars to measure the chest displacements of breathing based on the Doppler shifted reflected
signals. To improve the rang resolution of Doppler radar,
Lai et al. [45] propose to use an ultra-wideband (UWB) radar
to detect breathing motions, which can achieve high-range
resolution for tracking breathing of multiple subjects. But the
transmission power of UWB radar is limited, which reduces
the signal-to-noise ratio and the sensing range. To avoid the
disadvantages of the Doppler radar and UWB radar, recent
studies [46], [47] utilize frequency modulated continuous
wave (FMCW) radars to perform reliable and multi-subject
breathing monitoring. In addition, the chest and abdominal
movements of breathing can impact the WiFi signal indoor
propagation (e.g., reflection and scattering), thus it is feasible to capture human breathing motions by analyzing the
received WiFi signals. Fig. 3 shows the WiFi signal data
of person breathing which indicates clear breathing cycles.
Abdelnasser et al. [48] first propose a WiFi-based breathing
estimator named UbiBreathe, which can derive the breathing
rates from WiFi signal strength values. Liu et al. [49] utilize
the amplitude changes of WiFi channel state information
(CSI) to estimate the breathing rates, which is a fine-grained
measurement for breathing. Further studies [50] [51] exploit
phase information of WiFi CSI to realize accurate breathing
monitoring for multi-subjects.

to continuously measure the blood SpO2 of patients. Blood
with different oxygen levels has differences in the absorption
of near-infrared light. Thus, the pulse oximeter emits nearinfrared light to pass through the blood of the finger to measure
the blood SpO2. However, this clinical pulse oximeter is not
convenient for the normal usages in daily lives. More studies
exploit wrist-mounted oximeters [57], [58] or wrist-mounted
photoplethysmogram (PPG) sensors [59], [60] to measure the
blood SpO2 by analyzing the absorption difference of reflected
light on the blood in wrist. These wrist-mounted sensors can
be integrated into smartwatch or Fitbit to continuously monitor
the relative changes of blood Spo2.
Recently, remote SpO2 measurements [52], [61]–[63] draw
more and more attention to researchers. Wieringa et al. [64]
propose a pioneering idea that uses a camera with three
different wavelengths of LED light to measure blood SpO2.
But they did not build a real system or give any measurement
results. Kong et al. [61] use two cameras under ambient light
to detect a narrow level range (i.e., 97% − 99%) of blood
SpO2. To measure the blood SpO2 in a wider range varying
from 80% to 100% , Guazzi et al. [62] utilize a RGB camera to
detect the blood SpO2 of an individual 1.5 m away. Moreover,
as shown in Fig. 4, Shao et al. [52] propose a new approach to
measure the blood SpO2 by using the camera-recorded videos
of a individual’s face area, which is a low-cost method suitable
for SpO2 monitoring in home settings.

B. Blood Oxygen Saturation Monitoring

C. Body Temperature Monitoring

Blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) is a measure of the oxygencarrying capability of red blood cells. Healthy individuals can
regulate blood oxygen to a high level (i.e., > 95%). For
COVID-19 patients, low blood SpO2 is an early warning sign
of the disease, where further treatments (e.g., supplemental
oxygen) are needed if the blood SpO2 of a COVID-19 patient
is lower than 90% [53]. In addition, research indicates that
many COVID-19 patients are measured as low blood SpO2
even they do not have any discomfort or symptoms [54].
Therefore, monitoring relative changes of blood SpO2 is
significant for COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment. In the
clinical situations, a pulse oximeter [55], [56], which is a
noninvasive device placed over an individual’s finger, is used

Fever is a typical symptom of COVID-19, where clinical
statistics shows that more than 80% COVID-19 patients has
the symptom of fever [66]. During the COVID-19 pandemic,
many hospitals setup infrared temperature sensors at the entry
to identify the febrile patients and isolate them from other patients for further assessment [67], which significantly reduces
the COVID-19 transmission in hospitals. Thus, it is important
for both COVID-19 diagnosis and prevention to monitor the
changes of human body temperature. Traditional electronic
thermometers are based on the principle that different temperatures can cause the changes of probe’s resistance and we
can measure the resistance of probe to obtain the temperature
values. This thermometer is usually required to be placed

in oral, which causes inconvenience and is hard to achieve
continuous monitoring. Infrared temperature sensors [68], [69]
thus are commonly used for non-contact measurement of the
body temperature in the situation of long-term and continuous
monitoring, which are suitable to be implemented in highrisk areas, such as hospitals, schools, and airports, to perform
fever screening. For example, Chan et al. [70] explore the
feasibility of using an infrared thermography (IRT) camera to
screen fever subjects in the airport during the SARS outbreak.
The experiments involving 176 subjects shows that IRT-based
approach can recognize fever subjects (i.e., > 38◦ C) with
accuracy of over 88% in the distance of 0.5 m. Moreover,
many researchers propose IRT-based body temperature monitor for remote healthcare [71] [72], which enables real-time
remote health monitoring. Similarly, as shown in Fig. 5, Mohammed et al. [73] [65] propose to use infrared thermography
imaging with drones to recognize COVID-19 infected person
in the outdoor environment. However, the accuracy of infrared
approaches is limited from a distance. Some studies [74]–[76]
explore RF identification (RFID) technologies for accurate
body temperature monitoring. They integrate temperature sensors into RFID tags and attach tags onto human skin to enable
the body temperature monitoring with an error of 0.25◦ C.
IV. Q UARANTINE M ONITORING
Quarantine is used to isolate the individuals, who have been
diagnosed with COVID-19 disease or have been exposed to
coronavirus, which is implemented to prevent the spread of
COVID-19 [78]. In addition to keeping away from others,
their health needs to be monitored for further assessment
and possible treatment. Conventional procedures of quarantine
monitoring, such as vital signs monitoring or activity monitoring, are implemented manually by medical staff.
However, the pandemic brings acute shortages of medical
staff and facilities. And this contact monitoring also increases

nausea prediction has been analyzed based on smartphonesenabled video observation and directly observed treatments.
In another vain, both the camera sensor and inertial sensors’
measurements have been utilized in [16] to monitor neck
posture and consequently to predict the level of humanheadache. A comprehensive work has been studied to indicate
the type of cough by using smartphone-microphone chipset
in [17] and [18].
In this article, the proposed framework aims to use all these
aforementioned sensors and algorithms (could be improved)
in a single solution. This is followed by getting the predicted
level results of symptoms from the applied algorithms and
stored them in a dataset as a single record. Thus, such records
from different patients could be collected and used as input
to a Machine Learning (ML) algorithm. There are several ML
techniques used for human-health purposes such as decision
tree, support vector machine, k-nearest neighbors and neural
networks. The most recent and accurate techniques is deep
learning scheme, also referred to as neural network family.
Many deep learning algorithms have been utilized for the
classification or recognition purposes such as convolution
neural network (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN)
algorithms. CNN is feed-forward neural network which is
generally used for spatial data such as image recognition [19].
While with RNN, the output of each layer will be saved and
then used as an input for the next layers as well as the RNN

is efficient for temporal data such as text [20] and signal
measurements [21].
The proposed framework consists as a set of layers, as
shown in Fig. 1. The first layer functionalities are responsible
for reading the data from the sensors. For example, reading the
captured CT scan images of lung and videos through using the
smartphone camera, getting the inertial sensors (accelerometer
sensor) measurements during 30-second sit-to-stand, recording
microphone voice measurements during a series of cough,
and finally scanning temperature sensor measurements during
fingerprint touching on the smartphone screen. The second
layer is structured to configure the onboard smartphone sensors
including reading intervals, image size, buffers’ size, timer
resolution, and etc. Further, the readings and configurations are
then used as the input of the symptoms algorithms running on
the smartphone application. The third layer of the framework
provides a the calculated symptoms level, separately, and then
stored as a record input to the next layer. The last layer
is to apply ML techniques to predict the COVID-19. The
ML techniques could be used according to the nature of the
recorded data. For example, for the abnormal sub-image of
the CT scan images, CNN could be used. This is followed by
using RNN for the rest of the recorded data. Therefore, a new
combined CNN and RNN ML technique can be proposed for
the framework.
In the proposed framework, one significant input to the

the risk of infections among nursing staff. Thus, quarantine
monitoring needs to be implemented in home settings during
the pandemic. The issue is that quarantined individuals at
home may not follow the rules and their health cannot be
monitored by professional medical staff or devices. To address
this issue, many studies explore the advances of IoT to enable
remote smart healthcare, which achieves automatic human
activity tracking and real-time health monitoring in home
settings [79]. Catarinucci et al. [77] integrate RFID into
wireless sensor network (WSN) architecture to build a hybrid
sensing network (HSN), which combines the advantages of
both RFID and WSN technologies to enable a long-range, lowpower consumption and low-cost sensing scheme for patient
monitoring. Specifically, the patients need to wear RFID tag
for monitoring their physiological data like heartbeat and
movement. Furthermore, as illustrated in Fig. 6, the sensing
real-time data of HSN is delivered through IoT smart gateway
to the local user or remote user (i.e., medical staff) for assessment. To achieve minimum-latency real-time monitoring,
Verma et al. [80] introduce the concept of fog computing to an
IoT-based system for remote health monitoring. They integrate
a fog layer into an IoT system to process real-time data that
delivers the information to doctors timely. In addition, a fogassisted IoT system is proposed in [81] to monitor the patients
of dengue fever, which can remotely send patients’ vital signs
and symptoms to doctors with short response time.
Many studies [82]–[86] have exploit IoT techniques for
the quarantine monitoring of COVID-19 subjects. El-Din et
al. [83] propose a basic IoT sensor-based system to monitor
COVID-19 infected subjects, which uses ear sensor, blood
sensor and motion sensor to measure the patients’ physical
information (i.e., temperature, respiratory rate, and blood
pressure) and sends alerts to hospitals if anomaly is detected.
Also, Singh et al. [84] use a wearable band attached to the
body to track the real-time locations of COVID-19 quarantine
subjects. Similarly, in [85], an IoT framework is used for
monitoring and identify COVID-19 subjects during the quarantine. Specifically, several bio-sensors are deployed to detect
the COVID-19 symptoms of subjects and these data would be
delivered to quarantine center for further assessment and, in

VI. COVID-19 O UTBREAK F ORECASTING
As aforementioned sections present, IoT senors can capture
a wealth of data. With the advance of big data analytics and
artificial intelligence techniques, we can explore the rich set of
IoT underlying data and perform elaborate analysis to predict
the occurrence of various events. Akbar et al. [102] propose
a generic architecture for mining IoT data based on machine
learning techniques, which can be used for early predictions
of complex events. An adaptive prediction algorithms, named
adaptive moving window regression, is designed for dynamic
IoT data analysis in near real-time. The proposed architecture
is implemented in a smart city for predicting traffic events with
high accuracy. Dami et al. [103] integrate a latent Dirichlet
allocation model into support vector machine to perform
nonlinear data analysis in the IoT environments, which can
predict the complex events in an efficient manner with high
accuracy. An IoT-based frost prediction system is proposed by
Diedrichs et al. [104]. This work use IoT sensors of weather
stations to capture environmental data like temperature and
humidity and exploit Bayesian network and random forest to
predict frost events.
In addition, many researchers have explored IoT data for
predicting outbreaks of infectious diseases. Sareen et al. [106]
design an IoT-based intelligent system to predict Zika virus
outbreak. Zika virus can cause a mosquito-borne disease.
The most common symptom of Zika is fever. This system
applies a fuzzy k-nearest neighbour algorithm to recognize
the possibly infected users with the fever symptom and uses
Google map to locate the infected users for risk assessment.
For similar arboviruses spreading by mosquitoes, Tavares et
al. [107] propose an IoT architecture for summarizing data
from IoT sensors and analyzing them using big data techniques
to predict and monitor the arbovirus outbreaks. As shown in

8

Fig. 10, Sandeep et al. [105] propose a healthcare system for
monitoring and predicting chikungunya virus, which utilizes
the advancement of IoT, fog computing, and cloud computing.
Chikungunya virus, spreading in many developing countries,
can cause vector borne disease. This work [105] uses IoTbased wearable sensors to acquire the data (i.e., body temperature) of users and implements Fuzzy-C means algorithm in
the fog layer to diagnose users in real-time. All the data of
infected users is then uploaded to the cloud sever for predicting
the outbreak of chikungunya virus using the approach of
social network analysis. Similarly, Rani et al. [108] present
an IoT platform for preventing chickungunya virus, where it
gathers data from IoT sensors and analyzes them in the cloud
using big data processing, and finally gives the suggestions
of taking preventive actions. Also, for Ebola virus disease,
Wesolowski et al. [109] build a model using mobile network
data to analyse the population mobility in Africa that can
be useful to forecast and control the Ebola outbreak. To
summarize, IoT based data analysis has been utilized for
predicting various infection diseases. Similar approaches can
be implemented for COVID-19 outbreak forecasting.
VII. SARS-C OV-2 M UTATION P REDICTION
Similar to most coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 is a RNA virus
with unstable single-stranded structure, which is characterized
by a high mutation rate. This mutation may evolve the virus
to become more infectious/mortal or drug resistant [110].
Therefore, tracking and predicting the mutation of SARS-CoV2 is very significant for proactively preventing and controlling
COVID-19.
Traditionally, researchers predict the virus mutation via
analyzing the changes of RNA secondary structure [111]–
[113], which involves massive biology laboratory operations.
With the emerging of AI and big data analysis, more researches [114], [115] use machine/deep learning models to
learn the mutation patterns of viral evolution from historical data. Salama et al. [114] propose to use a multi-layer
perceptron neural network to learn the rules of correlation
between nucleotides of RNA. These learned rules can be
exploited to predict the mutations in next generations of
RNA, where it achieves a prediction accuracy of 75%. Yin et
al. [115] propose a time-series prediction model based on
recurrent neural networks (RNN) to perform the mutation
prediction of influenza viruses. By leveraging the feature of
RNN that can remember all historical residue information, this
work improves the effectiveness of the predication model and
successfully derive the mutation dynamics of influenza virus.
For SARS-CoV-2, Magar et al. [116] collect 1933 antibody
sequences of SARS-CoV-2 and train a model based on these
data using support vector machine and multilayer perceptron
neural network to predict the possible neutralizing antibodies
for SARS-CoV-2.
The above studies predict virus mutations by exploring the
virus structural features. On the other hand, these internal
structural features of a virus are always reflected in the
external biological features of a virus, such as symptoms of
infected subjects, virus transmission rate and virus mortality

rate. As we mention in previous sections, all those biological
features of a virus could be monitored and analyzed in an IoT
platform. Thus, we consider that exploring gathered data from
IoT platforms for COVID-19 applications is also a feasible
direction for predicting the mutation patterns of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is no existing studies yet in this direction, and
we hope investigations can be explored soon in this important
direction.
VIII. C ONCLUSIONS
This paper proposes a fog-cloud combined IoT platform
for COVID-19 prevention and control by implementing five
NPIs, including COVID-19 Symptom Diagnosis, Quarantine
Monitoring, Contact Tracing & Social Distancing, COVID19 Outbreak Forecasting, and SARS-CoV-2 Mutation Tracking.
Table I summarizes various studies considering different layers
of the proposed IoT platform. We review the recent IoT-based
studies which can be applied for implementing the five NPIs.
We discuss how the recent technological advancements such
as fog computing, clouding computing, artificial intelligence,
and big data analysis, can be utilized for IoT and COVID-19
applications.
