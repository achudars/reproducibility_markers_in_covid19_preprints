ABSTRACT
During the current COVID-19 pandemic decision makers are tasked with implementing and evaluating strategies for both treatment and disease prevention. In order
to make effective decisions they need to simultaneously monitor various attributes
of the pandemic such as transmission rate and infection rate for disease prevention,
recovery rate which indicates treatment effectiveness as well as the mortality rate
and others. This work presents a technique for monitoring the pandemic by employing an Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, Recovered Death model regularly estimated
by an augmented particle Markov chain Monte Carlo scheme in which the posterior
distribution samples are monitored via Multivariate Exponentially Weighted Average process monitoring. This is illustrated on the COVID-19 data for the State of
Qatar.

1. Introduction
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) [22, 27] is a severe pandemic affecting the
whole world with a fast spreading regime, requiring to perform strict precautions to
keep it under control. As there are limited cure and target treatment at the moment,
establishing those precautions become inevitable. These limitations [10] can be listed
as social distancing, closure of businesses / schools and travel prohibitions [4].
Corona Virus is a new human Betacoronavirus that uses densely glycosylated spike
protein to penetrate host cells. The COVID-19 belongs to the same family classification
with Nidovirales, viruses that use a nested set of mRNAs to replicate and it further falls
under the subfamily of alpha, beta, gamma and delta Co-Vis. The virus that causes
COVID-19 belongs to the Betacoronavirus 2B lineage and has a close relationship with

SARS species. It is a novel virus since the monoclonal antibodies do not exhibit a high
degree of binding to SARS-CoV-2. Replication of the viral RNA occurs when RNA
polymerase binds and re-attaches to multiple locations [8, 18].
Cases of COVID-19 started in December 2019 when a strange condition was reported
among a cluster of patients in Wuhan, China. Within a few weeks of this, the COVID19 virus had spread to different parts of the world. On January 20, 2020, the first case of
COVID-19 was recorded in the United States; Italy reported its first confirmed case on
January 31, 2020. With COVID-19 cases rising across the world, the governments were
soon seen intervening in financial and healthcare sectors. In late January, 2020, the
first U.S. travel restrictions were imposed on travel from China. Weeks later, additional
travel bans were imposed on countries in Europe and the United Kingdom. The World
Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020, with
a total of more than 100,000 cases globally. As of January 26, 2021, the worldwide
total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases eclipses 100 million with over 2.15 million
deaths. This virus has a global mortality rate of 3.4%, which makes it more severe
than the flu. The elderly who have other pre-existing illnesses are succumbing more
to the COVID-19. People with only mild symptoms recover within 3 to 7 days, while
those with conditions such as pneumonia or severe diseases take weeks to recover. As
of January 26, 2021, the recovery percentage of patients, for example, in China stands
at 95%. The global recovery percentage rate of COVID-19 is somewhere around 97%
[26].
The main efforts in the literature is focused on model estimation and forecasting
the dynamic nature of the COVID-19 pandemic versus monitoring the process. The
Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, Recovered, Death (SEIRD) model is a common compartmental model used for modeling disease through a population and variants of it
have been used in modeling the COVID-19 pandemic, such as [15] for Italy, [2] for
India and [9] for the State of Qatar. For more on disease modeling in general, see
[6, 13, 17, 24].
Other modeling approaches include a time-series model to analyze the outbreak of
the pandemic [7], a time-varying Bayesian semi-parametric model to look at shortterm projections of the pandemic [23]. [12] studies the dynamic pattern of COVID-19
deaths over time. The impact of government intervention such as a lockdown has
been studied for China in [25] and for India in [2, 3]. Monitoring of the mathematical
process has been done for Ukraine’s COVID-19 outbreak [14]; however the parameter
estimates are not generated directly from the data and no clear monitoring scheme
is presented. As the vaccine is beginning to be distributed to the public, monitoring
the pandemic is more important to decision makers as they can determine how the
pandemic is progressing as well as any shocks to the system that may be problematic.
The monitoring approach needs to be able to react quickly to any large shifts in the
system.
The goal of this work is to develop a method of monitoring a pandemic using a base
mathematical model, such as SEIRD, that can be quickly updated as soon as new
information comes in and can “signal” if there is a change in the parameters of the
mathematical model. The literature does not seem to provide any approaches that meet
this goal. The big challenge in this problem is updating the parameters in an automated
way and converting those parameters to something that can be monitored. Here a
Bayesian approach is taken for the parameter estimation via a sampling algorithm that
will allow for quick updating, avoid particle depletion and from which the samples can
be monitored using a standard process control regime.
This work is organized in the following manner. Section 2 introduces the SEIRD
2

model specific to the State of Qatar, the mean model, and the likelihood used. Section 3 introduces the Reproduction number and illustrates its deficiency in this case.
This is followed by the Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling algorithm with particle
augmentation to update the parameters at each time step in Section 4. The Multivariate Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (MEWMA) monitoring approach is
presented in Section 5. The method is illustrated on real data from the State of Qatar
in Section 6, which shows how the monitoring can be employed to identify critical
changes in the pandemic. Finally, Section 7 provides a discussion of the method and
provides some suggestions for implementation as well as possible areas for improvement.

2. SEIRD Model
Let t be a time index that is the number of days from the first recorded case of
COVID-19 in the population of interest, S(t) be the number of subjects Susceptible
at time t, E(t) be the number of subjects Exposed at time t, I(t) be the number of
Infected (symptomatic) subjects at time t, R(t) be the cumulative number of Recovered
subjects at time t and D(t) be the cumulative number of subject Deaths at time t.
This can be modeled with the following system of ordinary differential equations:
dS(t)
dt
dE(t)
dt
dI(t)
dt
dR(t)
dt
dD(t)
dt

= −αS(t)E(t)
= αS(t)E(t) − βE(t) − γE(t)
= βE(t) − γI(t) − ηI(t)
= γI(t)
= ηI(t),

(1)

where the parameters are explained as follows: α is the transmission rate (per day ×
individual2 ) from Susceptible to Exposed, the rate (per day) at which Exposed become
Infected (symptomatic) is denoted by β, γ is the rate (per day) at which Infected
become recovered and the mortality rate (per day) for those Infected is denoted by
η. Notice that, this model formulation makes several key assumptions which are as
follows. Immigration, emigration, natural mortality and births are negligible over the
time frame and hence are not in the model. Once a person is in the Infected group,
they are quarantined and hence they do not mix with the Susceptible population. The
Recovered and Deaths compartments are for those who first are infected. Those who
are exposed and are asymptomatic recover at the same rate γ as those who become sick
and recover. The SEIRD model presented here is the same as the one presented in [9]
and matches the assumptions needed for the example provided in Section 6, however,
the estimation and monitoring method is not specific to this particular model.
Due to the dynamic nature of how the pandemic has developed, assuming the system
is in “steady state” is invalid as governments have intervened into the system in an
effort to influence various parameters as well as medical treatment of the disease has
changed across the time frame. Hence the parameters are also functions of time denoted

3

as α(t), β(t), γ(t) and η(t). Specifically,
dλS (t)
dt
dλE (t)
dt
dλI (t)
dt
dλR (t)
dt
dλD (t)
dt

= −α(t)λS (t)λE (t)
= α(t)λS (t)λE (t) − β(t)λE (t) − γ(t)λE (t)
= β(t)λE (t) − γ(t)λI (t) − η(t)λI
= γ(t)λI (t)
= η(t)λI (t),

(2)

where λs (t), λE (t), λs (I), λR (t) and λD (t) denote the respective mean parameters.
At each time point t the parameters must have a prior distribution. For this work the
prior distribution specification will be the same for all t, however, this is not necessary
if one has information that needs to be included at a specific time.
Since a Bayesian methodology is being employed the likelihood is specified to be:
I(t) ∼ P oisson (λI (t))
R(t) ∼ P oisson (λR (t))
D(t) ∼ P oisson (λD (t)) .

(3)

Notice that S(t) and E(t) are not in the likelihood as they are latent states in that
they are not directly observed. The true likelihood for {S(t), E(t), I(t), R(t), D(t)}
should be Multinomial. However, with two latent states, one of which is the largest
state, the Multinomial approach is challenging to apply, thus this work uses adopts
Poisson likelihood as an approximation.

3. The Basic Reproduction Number R0
The basic reproduction number, R0 , is defined as the expected number of secondary
cases produced by a single infection in a completely susceptible population. It is dimensionless and can be calculated as a product of the transmissibility, the average
rate of contact between susceptible and infected individuals, and the duration of the
infectiousness [5]. In model (1), the last two equations do not contribute to R0 and so
R0 =

α
.
β+γ

Since our model is time varying, it follows that
R0 (t) =

α(t)
β(t) + γ(t)

In this work the Reproduction number is not considered since it does not account
for all the parameters in the model. One of the goals of this work is to ensure the
monitoring process accounts for all of the parameters.

4. Sequential Sampling with Particle Augmentation
From a monitoring perspective, we need to essentially estimate the parameters, θt =
{α(t), β(t), γ(t), η(t)}), at each time step dependent primarily on the latest data. If at
time t, we want to estimate the change in the parameters from t − 1 to t, we need an
estimation algorithm that can update the parameters so that changes can be detected.
In a dynamic system where the parameters are changing due to interventions into the
system such as vaccines or quarantines, the estimation algorithm needs to also take
into account the previous changes that have taken place in the system. Traditional
approaches to modeling varying coefficient models from a Bayesian perspective have
difficulties as the sampling methods required often suffer from particle depletion as the
process proceeds through time.
The proposed Algorithm 1 is a variant of the Sampling Importance Resampling
algorithm at each time step. To ensure there are enough particles to work through the
sampling process, the basic idea is to augment each accepted sample by some random
perturbations to generate new particles to move through to the next step.
Let us fix the notation first. Denote D(k) = {S(k), E(k), I(k), R(k), D(k)} as the
actual state vector of the system at time step k, where the first two components are
latent, ∀k ∈ {0, 1, . . . , T } and T denotes the total number of time steps considered.
Denote g(θ0 ) and g(θk |θk−1 ), respectively, as the candidate distributions to sample
θ from at time step 0 and at time step k (∀k = 1, 2, . . . , T ). Let θ̃k denote the set
of accepted samples of θ at time k that will be passed on to the next time step
(∀k ∈ {0, 1, . . . , T − 1}). Denote the set that contains all the accepted values of θ up
to time k by Θ̃(k).
We elaborate on the key steps of Algorithm 1 below. At time step 0, we draw
∗ }nc . We then evaluate the
nc candidate samples of θ from g(θ0 ), denoted by {θ0,j
j=1
posterior distribution using the data at time 0 (i.e., D(0)) and the candidate particles
to obtain the unnormalized weights {wj∗ , j = 1, 2, . . . , nc } at time step 0, which are
subsequently normalized to the w
bj∗ . We then obtain np posterior samples by selecting
∗

from {θ0,j , j = 1, 2, . . . , nc } with the corresponding probabilities given by {w
bj∗ }nj=1
denote this set of np samples by θ̃0 = {θ̃0,1 , θ̃0,2 , . . . , θ̃0,np }. This set of accepted values
of θ will be passed on to time step 1. The sampling for time step k is similar to that
for time step 0 but enhanced with sample augmentation. Specifically, at time step
k (∀k ∈ {1, 2, . . . , T }), using an appropriate candidate density g(θk |θ̃k−1,ℓ ) which is
conditioned on each accepted sample from time step k − 1, we generate a batch of nb

b
}nj=1
for
candidate samples in the neighborhood of θ̃k−1,ℓ ; denote the batch by {θk,ℓ,j
ℓ = 1, 2, . . . , np . We then evaluate the posterior distribution using the data up to time k
(i.e., D(k)), the accepted samples up to time step k−1 (i.e., Θ̃(k−1)) and the candidate

step k, we update the set of accepted values of θ to Θ̃(k) = Θ̃(k − 1) ∪ θ̃k .

5. Monitoring
The presented method for estimating the SEIRD model parameters through time is
quite responsive to changes in the system. Hence, these parameters can be monitored
to look for changes in the parameters which will be manifested in the data. Since there
are four parameters in the SEIRD model that need to be simultaneously monitored,
the Multivariate Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (MEWMA) approach was
chosen as an appropriate monitoring method. [16] developed a multivariate EWMA
(MEWMA) control chart, which is an extension to the univariate EWMA.
First the parameter samples were differenced using a single backward lag of one,
∆α(t)i = α(t)i − α(t − 1)i , ∆γ(t)i = γ(t)i − γ(t − 1)i , ∆β(t)i = β(t)i − β(t − 1)i and
∆η(t)i = η(t)i −η(t−1)i . These form a vector (∆α(t)i , ∆γ(t)i , ∆β(t)i , ∆η(t)i )T to be
monitored for significant deviations from zero, which would correspond to a significant
change in the set of parameters. The multivariate parameters are given by the mean:
∆θ̄(t) =

1 T
1 (∆α(t), ∆γ(t), ∆β(t), ∆η(t))
n p np

and variance:




∆α(t)T
T
1 
 ∆γ(t)T  (∆α(t), ∆γ(t), ∆β(t), ∆η(t)) .
Cov(∆θ(t)) =

np − 1 ∆β(t) 
∆η(t)T
6

In order to have a monitoring process that is not too sensitive, the MEWMA is employed which is given by
M EW M A(t) = Λ∆θ̄(t) + (1 − Λ)M EW M A(t − 1),

(4)

with the moving covariance matrix:
V (t) = Λ2 Cov(∆θ(t)) + (1 − Λ)2 V (t − 1),
where Λ is a smoothing coefficient that controls how much a new observation can influence the overall mean. Lower values of Λ are more conservative in that new observations
do not have much influence on the mean as higher values allow new observations to
have a greater influence on the mean. This is used to control false signals as any process being monitored will have some natural variation that may cause the observation
to be signalled. Typical values of Λ include 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25 and 0.3.
Since we are looking at the differences in parameter values, the target value for the
process mean should be (0, 0, 0, 0) indicating no shift in the process. In the multivariate
case, a test statistic based on Hotelling’s T 2 can be formed as
T 2 (t) = M EW M A(t)T V (t)−1 M EW M A(t).

(5)

When np is large, T 2 (t) in Equation (5) is approximately χ2 (4) which has a 0.95quantile equal to 9.48. Hence any T 2 (t) > 9.48 would be deemed as a significant change
in the parameter differences and thus a significant change in the SEIRD process. Note
that, in our case np = 1, 000 and hence deemed large enough for the T 2 approximation.

6. Data Analysis: State of Qatar
6.1. Data Description
The World Health Organization, Johns Hopkins University and other agencies maintain data sets on the daily number of confirmed infected cases, deaths, and recoveries
for every country. In this work, we study the evolution of the pandemic in the State
of Qatar. All data for Qatar were obtained from Johns Hopkins University and are
freely accessible via the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 GitHub repository [19]. The GitHub
site includes daily cumulative number of confirmed infections, cumulative number of
recovered and cumulative number of deaths starting 22 January 2020.
The goal of the data analysis is to demonstrate and assess the proposed modeling
approach and its use in monitoring the pandemic as the varying coefficient approach
will allow for the model parameters to adjust quickly to changes in the data generation
process. In model (1), the Recovered and Death states are cumulative with no outgoing
transitions whereas the Infected state has transitions from Exposed and to Recovered
and Death states. Hence the data for confirmed infections are cumulative and include
the numbers from both the Recovered and Death states. As such, if CI(t) denotes
the confirmed infections at time t, then the number of Infected subjects at time t is
defined as
I(t) = CI(t) − R(t) − D(t).

Figure 1. Plot of Active Infections (a), Recovered (b) and Deaths (c) for the State of Qatar data.

From here on, the term “Active Infections” will be used to denote this derived variable
versus the cumulative Infected provided in the data.
Figure 1 shows the plots of daily Active Infections, Recovered and Deaths data for
the State of Qatar since 29 February 2020. The Active Infections start very low but
encounter a large jump around day 12 due to increased testing. The Active Infections
then seem to plateau until day 30, after which there is an extreme growth in Active
Infections. The Active Infections start to go down after day 90. The patterns in the
Recovered and Deaths are similar and reflect the time of infection before recovery or
death. Both graphs show a very slight increase in the number of recovered or dead
subjects until about day 90, after which a steady increase is noticed.
6.2. Evolution of the pandemic in Qatar
The State of Qatar is one of the countries heavily affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Since its first infected case way back on February 29, 2020, Qatar has become one of
the highest infected countries in the Middle East with the total number of confirmed
cases standing at 148,258 as of January 26, 2021. The total number of deaths in Qatar
so far stands at 248 cases, which is low relative to the total number of infected cases,
which is an indication of the country’s highly effective healthcare system.
Qatar prepared an excellent flexible plan for risk management, grounded on national
risk assessment, taking into account of the global risk assessment done by WHO and
focusing on reinforcing capacities to reduce or eliminate health risks from COVID19. Along with the well-organized healthcare system, the country was very quick to
respond to the global pandemic. The country implemented many preventive measures
very early on in the pandemic, including border control for early detection of cases.
This included, were but not limited to, installing thermal screening for passengers
who entered the country at Hamad International Airport and at seaports as early as
January 2020, with the first quarantine facilities opening on February 1 [1].
On March 9, 2020 (day 10), Qatar closed all universities and schools and placed a
travel ban on 15 countries: Bangladesh, China, Egypt, India, Iran, Iraq, Italy, Lebanon,
Nepal, Pakistan, the Philippines, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Syria and Thailand. On
March 14, 2020 (day 15), Qatar expanded its travel ban to include three new countries: Germany, Spain and France [11, 20]. The Ministry of Municipal and Environment
on March 21, 2020, closed all parks and public beaches to curb the spread of coronavirus. On March 23, 2020 (day 24), the Ministry of Commerce and Industry decided
to temporarily close all restaurants, cafes, food outlets, and food trucks for the public. Also, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry decided to close all unnecessary
8

businesses on March 27, 2020 (day 28) [11, 20].
As the number of infected cases continued to rise, on April 8, 2020 (day 40), the
Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) announced that Primary Health Care Cooperation will be designating two health centers, one in Umm-Salal and one in Gharrafat
Al-Rayyan, for screening, testing, and quarantining COVID-19 patients. MoPH also
announced a hotline for psychological aid on April 9, 2020 (day 41).
These interventions made by the government change the dynamics of the pandemic
and hence, need to be considered while setting up a a real-time monitoring system
of the infection, recovery and death rates. In the next subsection, we illustrate the
proposed model as a data-driven forecasting model for use by stakeholders in the
State of Qatar to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic.
6.3. Data analysis results
For Qatar, the prior distribution specification is: α(t) ∼ Exp(2/4450000), β(t) ∼
Exp(1/105), γ(t) ∼ Exp(1/14) and η(t) ∼ Exp(1/9500). These priors reflect some
information such as for γ(t) the mean is 1/14 which corresponds to a 14-day infection
duration.
The SEIRD model was run with the following initial values for Qatar: S(0) =
2, 782, 000, E(0) = 3, I(0) = 1, R(0) = 0 and D(0) = 0. The SEIRD model and the
sampling process given in Algorithm 1 were coded in MATLAB R2020a and were run
on a PC with Intel Core i7-7700 CPU at 3.60GHz with 8GB of RAM. At each time
step the sampler was run with nc = 10, 000, np = 1, 000 and nb = 10. Hence, each of
the np samples had a batch of nb samples generated in its neighborhood resulting in
np candidate particles at the beginning of the next time step. The model computation
time is about 60 minutes for T = 135 time steps. Note that, the number of individuals
in each compartment in the model is much smaller due to the population size. This
means that many of the computations are faster especially when dealing with large
factorials associated with the Poisson distribution.
Figure 2 shows the coefficient estimates across time, α(t) (panel a), β(t) (panel
b), γ(t) (panel c) and η(t) (panel d) for the Qatar data set. Of particular interest is
the time frame from day 90 to day 95 in which the active infections I(t) exhibited
a large drop (see Figure 1). Notice that the distribution for α(t) becomes incredibly
concentrated in this time frame as evidenced by the narrow credible intervals. This is
further exhibited in β(t) and η(t). However, by examining γ(t) during this time frame
one sees that, a large spike in the recovery rate with very narrow credible intervals as
well. And for γ(t) after about 80 days the recovery rate begins to increase dramatically
with another spike around day 115.
Figure 3 shows the model fitted to the data with 95% posterior predictive bounds
for Active Infections (panel a), Recovered (panel b) and Deaths (panel c). First note is
that all three models appear to fit the data extremely well based on visual inspection.
Particularly notice that around day 90 when the dramatic drop in Active infections
occurs this can be contrasted with Figure 2.

The Pseudo-R2 = 0.9999 which shows an incredible agreement between the median
fitted values and their corresponding data values. The proportion of observations that
fall into the 95% predictive bands Pbfit = 0.8394 which indicates that the model has less
uncertainty that it should. However, the value is still quite high with approximately
84% of observations being captured by the intervals.
Figure 4 shows the plot of T 2 (t) for the Qatar data with a control limit set at 9.48
(red dashed line) and a smoothing parameter Λ = 0.2. Notice that until time 40 the
process seems to be pretty stable as indicated by the T 2 (t) being below the control
limit. After day 40 there are several time points signalling a change in the process on
days: 40, 44, 47, 64, 65, 67, 68, 69, 71, 77, 95, and 123. The early days (40,44,47) can
easily be seen to agree with the change in both infection rate α(t) and death rate η(t)
in Figure 2 (a) and (d). Notice in these plots the high volatility with spikes in α(t)
and a clear shift upwards in η(t) at the same times. During the days 64 to 77 there
appears to be a very large amount of volatility in the infection rate α(t) which is also
evidenced in Figure 3 (a) for active infections. Notice how the active infections have
large increases one day and smaller increases the next day. The method also picks up
the spike in infection rates as well as the dramatic increase in recovery rate γ(t) at
time 95. At day 123, Figure 2 shows a spike in the rate of exposed to actively infected,
β(t) (panel b) and another shift in recovery rate γ(t) (panel c).
To study the sensitivity to the smoothing parameter in the MEWMA chart across
signals several other analyses were performed with Λ = 0.1, Λ = 0.15, Λ = 0.25, and
Λ = 0.3, which are commonly chosen values for this parameter. When Λ = 0.1 the
monitoring process signaled at days: 44, 47, 69, 77 and 123. Since the smoothing
parameter puts more weight on the previous mean than on the new observations, it
is expected that a smaller number of days would be signalled. When Λ = 0.15 the
monitoring process signaled at days: 40, 44, 47, 64, 68, 69, 71, 77 and 123. Notice that
for both Λ = 0.1 and Λ = 0.15 day 95 is not signaled, which upon inspection of almost
all the charts there is a shift in the process. Hence, these parameter choices would
be considered too conservative in this case. When Λ = 0.25 the following days were
signalled: 40, 44, 47, 64, 65, 67, 68, 69, 71, 77, 95 and 123. This is the same result
as when Λ = 0.2. When Λ = 0.3 the monitoring process signalled the following days:
40, 44, 47, 64, 65, 67, 68, 69, 71, 72, 74, 77, 80, 95 and 123. Here days 72, 74 and 80
are added to the list of signalled days. This reflects the volatility in α(t) across this
time frame. Overall, when less conservative values for Λ are chosen, the days signalled
are quite reasonable. In could be argued that in a pandemic situation a more sensitive
monitoring process would be beneficial to public policy makers as it can signal when

7. Discussion
This work provides a novel tool for monitoring and capturing changes in a pandemic
evolution process via monitoring changes in parameters of mathematical epidemiological models, such as the Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, Recovered, Death (SEIRD)
model using the Multivariate Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (MEWMA)
process monitoring technique. A Bayesian approach is taken for the parameter estimation with a sampling algorithm that allows for both quick updating of the SEIRD
model but also provides samples that can be monitored by the MEWMA regime.
This sampling algorithm uses the notion of Sampling Importance Resampling, but
augments the particles at each step to avoid particle depletion. This quick updating
allows for the process monitoring scheme to “signal” quickly if there is a change in the
model parameters. The method is then used to monitor the evolution of the COVID-19
pandemic in the State of Qatar.
Despite the proliferation of forecasting models for the evolution of the COVID-19
pandemic, their accuracy achieved can be compromised and comparisons can be complicated due to numerous factors, e.g., their construction methods, distinct healthcare
systems adopted by different countries/regions, different political decisions or policies
made, distinct testing and reporting mechanisms [21]. Hence, using the forecasts given
by a particular forecasting model for critical decision making is challenging. The proposed approach takes a different perspective and enables decision-makers to work with
a tailored SEIRD model, assess the effectiveness of the policies/decisions made, and
adopt interventions and/or prevention strategies consistently over time.
The State of Qatar example illustrates the proposed method’s ability to perform
daily monitoring of a pandemic. The proposed model fits the data very well with a
pseudo − R2 = 0.999. In the model definition, immigration, emigration, natural births
and natural mortality have not been included; however, based on the high psuedo-R2 ,
12

they would have a negligible effect on the fit. Furthermore, the model does not contain
compartments for subjects who recovered without being confirmed infections. Since
this is not observed, one can only speculate on the impact that additional data would
have on the model fit; however, it would be very small. As seen in Figures 2 and 3, the
proposed method successfully picks up the day to day fluctuations in the pandemic
evolution process in Qatar via the estimated time-varying model parameters. Note
that the pandemic’s overall state can also be monitored by tracking the T 2 statistic
over time (see Figure 4). For Qatar, the method signals the first change in the process
around day 40. This change can be attributed to several government interventions such
as closing parks and public beaches on day 24, closing all unnecessary businesses on
day 28 and announcing two major health centers catered towards COVID-19 patients
on day 40. The method also signals multiple days beyond day 40, all of which seem
reasonable upon further inspection. Thus, the proposed method gives decision-makers
the ability to evaluate planned interventions as well as discover new changes to the
process and respond accordingly. This method can also be extended for monitoring a
process at the state/county level by incorporating a spatial covariance and using the
mixed model approach.
Since the augmented sampling regime allows posterior samples to be saved from
the previous day, updating is performed on a daily basis and only requires the new
data and the previous day’s samples. Thus the entire SEIRD model need not be fit
from the beginning of the series. Furthermore, the MEWMA is quickly calculated
from the posterior samples and can quickly signal those managing the pandemic.
Note that the method is not tied to the SEIRD model given in Equation (1), as the
augmented sampler and MEWMA monitoring protocol are generic. Our motivation
here has been using a system where the reproduction number fails to include all the
relevant parameters. In systems where the reproduction number is dependent on all
parameters, the reproduction number could be added as a dimension to the monitoring
protocol as well. In situations where the reproduction number is meaningful, this
could be another dimension that could “signal” serious changes in long-term process
outcomes.
