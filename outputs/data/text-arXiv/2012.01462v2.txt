Abstract
Over the past few months, there were huge
numbers of circulating tweets and discussions
about Coronavirus (COVID-19) in the Arab region. It is important for policy makers and
many people to identify types of shared tweets
to better understand public behavior, topics of
interest, requests from governments, sources
of tweets, etc. It is also crucial to prevent
spreading of rumors and misinformation about
the virus or bad cures. To this end, we present
the largest manually annotated dataset of Arabic tweets related to COVID-19. We describe
annotation guidelines, analyze our dataset and
build effective machine learning and transformer based models for classification.

Introduction

As the Coronavirus (COVID-19) crippled lives
across the world, people turned to social media
to share their thoughts, news about vaccines or
cures, personal stories, etc. With Twitter being
one of the popular social media platforms in the
Arab region, tweets became a major medium of
discussion about COVID-19. These tweets can be
indicators of psychological and physical well being, public reactions to specific actions taken by the
government and also public expectation from governments. Therefore, identifying types of tweets
and understanding their content can aid decision
making by governments. It is also important for
governments to identify and prevent rumours and
bad cures since they can bring harm to society.
While there have been many recent works about
tweets related to COVID-19, there are a very few
targeted toward aiding governments in their decision making in the Arab region despite Arabic
being one of the dominant languages on Twitter (Alshaabi et al., 2020). Some of the existing works use
automatically collected datasets (Alqurashi et al.,
2020). Manually labeled datasets are either small

in size (few hundred tweets) (Alam et al., 2020)
or target different task such as sentiment analysis
(Haouari et al., 2020). To fill this gap, we present
and publicly share the largest (to our best knowledge) manually annotated dataset of Arabic tweets
collected from early days of COVID-19, labeled
for 13 classes. We present our data collection and
annotation scheme followed by data analysis, identifying trends, topics and distribution across countries. Lastly, we employ machine learning and
transformer models for classification.

Related Work

Much of recent works on COVID-19 rely on
queries to Twitter or distant supervision. This allows a large number of tweets to be collected. Chen
et al. (2020) collect 123M tweets by following certain queries and accounts on Twitter. GeoCoV19
(Qazi et al., 2020) is a large-scale dataset containing 524M tweets with their location information.
Banda et al. (2020) collected 152M tweets at the
time of their writing. Li et al. (2020) identifies
situational information about COVID-19 and its
propagation on Weibo. Other works include propagation of misinformation (Huang and Carley, 2020;
Shahi et al., 2020), cultaral, social and political
impact of misinformation (Leng et al., 2020) and
rumor amplification (Cinelli et al., 2020).
For Arabic, we see a similar trend where few
datasets are manually labeled. Alqurashi et al.
(2020) provide a large dataset of Arabic tweets
containing keywords related to COVID-19. Similarly, ArCOV-19 (Haouari et al., 2020) is a dataset
of 750K tweets obtained by querying Twitter. Alam
et al. (2020) annotate a small number of English
(currently 504) and Arabic tweets (currently 218)
for (i) existence of claim and worthiness of factchecking (ii) harmfulness to society, and (iii) relevance to governments or policy makers. Yang et al.

(2020) annotate 10K Arabic and English tweets for
the task of fine-grained sentiment analysis.

Data Collection

Figure 2: Examples for CURE, VOLUNT, PRSNL,
SUPPORT, PRAYER and UNIMP classes

Figure 1: Examples for REP, ACT, INFO, RUMOR,
ADVICE and SEEK ACT classes

We used twarc search API1 to collect tweets having the Arabic word AKðPñ» (Corona) in Feb and
March 2020. We collected 30M tweets in total. The
reason behind selecting this word is that it’s widely
used by normal people, news media2 and official organizations 3 as opposed to 19- YJ¯ñ» (COVID-19)
which is rarely used by normal people. We aimed
to increase diversity of tweet sources. Our collection covers the period from Feb 21 until March 31
in which Coronavirus was reported for the first time
in All Arab countries except United Arab Emirates
(AE)4 (Jan 29) and Egypt (EG) (Feb 14). The date

of the first reported Coronavirus case in Lebanon
(LB) was Feb 21, and in Iraq (IQ), Bahrain (BH),
Oman (OM), and Kuwait (KW) was Feb 24, in
Qatar was Feb 29, and in Saudi Arabia (SA) was
March 2. All other Arab countries came later.

Data Annotation

During the period of our study (40 days), we
extracted the top retweeted 200 tweets in each day
(total of 8000). We assume that the top retweeted
tweets are the most important ones which get
highest attention from Twitter users. Annotation
was done manually by a native speaker according
to class descriptions shown in Table 1. To measure
quality, we annotated 200 random tweets by a
second annotator. Inter-annotator agreement
was 0.85 using Cohen’s kappa coefficient which
indicates high quality given that annotation is not
trivial and some classes are close to each other.
Examples of annotation classes are shown in
Figures 1 and 2.
Note: If a tweet has multimedia (image or video)

or an external link (URL or another tweet),
the annotator was asked to open it and judge
accordingly to consider the full context of the
tweet. For example, if a tweet has a text about a
prayer and the attached image is about number of
new cases, this should be classified as REP not
PRAYER.

Limitation

We found that ≈10% of the tweets can take more
than one class, e.g. a tweet reports new cases and a
medical advice. We plan to allow multiple labels
in future. In the current version, such tweets take
the label of the first “important” class. We consider
the first 8 classes in Table 1 to be important and
the last 5 classes (PRSNL, SUPPORT, PRAYER,
UNIMP and NOT ARB) to be less important5 .
Figure 4: Timeline: Number of class tweets each day

Analysis

Class timeline is shown in Figure 4. We can observe the following important notes:
Figure 5: Hate speech example

• Large portion of tweets can be considered as
LessImportant to many people (≈ 30%).
• Reports (REP) and actions taken by governments
(ACT) are the most retweeted tweets.
• Information about the virus (INFO) get less attention with time and there is an increasing number
of tweets about volunteering (VOLUNT).
• There are continuous requests for governments
to take actions (SEEK ACT) – especially in the
beginning (≈ 15%), and few tweets are about
rumors (≈ 5%) and cures (≈ 2%).
We took a random sample of 1000 tweets and annotated them for their topics. Figure 3 shows that,
in addition to health, the virus affected many aspects of people’s lives such as politics, economy,
education, etc. We found also that 7% of tweets
have hate speech, e.g. attacking China and Iran for
spreading the virus as shown in Figure 5.
Table 2 shows country distribution and top accounts for the original authors of tweets. Typically,
people retweet tweets from ministry of health in
their countries in addition to famous news agencies
and celebrities. Most of these accounts are verified.

These classes will be merged into LessImportant class.

Experiments and Evaluation

We randomly split the data into sets of 6000, 1000
and 1000 tweets for train, dev and test sets respectively. We report macro-averaged Precision (P),
Recall (R) and F1 score along with Accuracy (Acc)
on test set 6 . We use F1 score as primary metric for
comparison.

Features

N-gram features We experimented with character and word n-gram features weighted by term
frequency-inverse term document frequency (tfidf). We report results for only the most significant
ranges, namely, word [1-2] and character [2-5].
Mazajak Embeddings Mazajak embeddings are
word-level skip-gram embeddings trained on 250M
Arabic tweets, yielding 300-dimensional vectors.

text classification tasks such as spam detection
(Mubarak et al., 2020), offensiveness detection
(Hassan et al., 2020) or dialect identification (Abdelali et al., 2020; Bouamor et al., 2019). We experimented with i) word n-gram, ii) character n-gram
and iii) Mazajak Embeddings. We used LinearSVC
implementation by scikit-learn 7 .
Deep Contextualized Transformer Models
(BERT) Transformer-based pre-trained contextual embeddings, such as BERT (Devlin et al.,
2019), have outperformed other classifiers in many
NLP tasks. We used AraBERT (Antoun et al.,
2020), a BERT-based model trained on Arabic
news. We used ktrain library (Maiya, 2020) that
utilizes Huggingface8 implementation to fine-tune
AraBERT. We used learning rate of 8e-5 , truncating
length of 50 and fine-tuned for 5 epochs.

Binary Classification

First, we experiment to distinguish LessImportant
tweets from others (see Section 4). From Table 3,
we can see that SVMs with character [2-5]-gram
outperformed others with F1 score of 79.8, closely
followed by AraBERT with 79.6 F1.

Fine-grained Classification

Our next set of experiments were designed for finegrained classification for 13 classes. With F1 score
of 60.5, AraBERT outperformed others (Table 4).
Error Analysis: AraBERT confusion matrix (Fig
6) shows that PRSNL, INFO and RUMOR are the
hardest classes to identify and the most common
error is misclassifying INFO as ADVICE. This suggests increasing data size to have more examples
from different classes.

Conclusion and Future Work

We present the largest publicly available manually
annotated dataset of Arabic tweets for 13 classes
that includes the most retweeted tweets in the early
days of COVID-19. Followed by data analysis, we
present models that can reliably identify important
tweets and can perform fine-grained classification.
In the future, we plan to compare our data to data
from later days of the pandemic.
