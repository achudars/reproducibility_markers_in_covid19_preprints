Main Text
Zhang et al. (1) argued that “mandated face covering represents the determinant in shaping the
trends of the pandemic worldwide,” and suggested that mandating masks in public is necessary
and sufficient to decrease the rate of new COVID-19 infections. Their analysis assumed that the
effect of the lockdowns in Italy and New York City (NYC) is captured by a linear increase in the
number of cases (their Figs. 2b,c) that would have continued without mask mandates. We show
two reasons why Zhang et al.’s statistical analysis of the association between mask mandates
and SARS-CoV-2 transmission are inappropriate.
First, consider the susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) model (2), where 𝛽 is the rate
at which contacts between the infected population fraction 𝑖 and susceptible fraction 𝑠 lead to
infections (after a latent period), with subsequent recovery 𝑟. After introduction of coronavirus and
before non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), 𝛽 is high; NPIs, including both lockdowns and
masks, act by decreasing 𝛽. The effect of one NPI, representing a lockdown alone, is shown in
Fig. 1.
Zhang et al. quantified the effect of lockdowns as the slope of the cumulative number of cases,
𝑁(𝑖 + 𝑟), where 𝑁 is constant population, fit with linear regression. Calculating 𝑑(𝑖 + 𝑟)/𝑑𝑡 from
SEIR gives,
𝑑
(𝑖 + 𝑟) = 𝛽𝑠𝑖.
𝑑𝑡
𝑑(𝑖 + 𝑟)/𝑑𝑡 is proportional not just to the effect of NPIs on 𝛽, but also to the number of
interactions between susceptible and infected people. This changes over time, even when the
effect of NPIs is constant (Fig. 1). Thus, the slope of the number of cases does not encapsulate
the effect of NPIs, a central assumption of Zhang et al.’s analysis.
Second, consider a location which was not included in Zhang et al.’s analysis, Switzerland (Fig.
2). Switzerland implemented a lockdown broadly similar to those in Italy and NYC approximately
two weeks after local transmission began (3, 4). However, unlike Italy and NYC, masks were not
mandated for the general public (4) nor widely worn through June (5, 6). If mask mandates were
the only factor that could drive a reduction in the number of cases, then the number of cases
should have continued to steadily increase, as no mask mandate was in place. Instead, the rate
of new cases peaked in late March and declined until early June (Fig. 2b), illustrating that NPIs
other than mask mandates affect trends in COVID-19 cases.
Our approach shows that mask mandates may not be the only factor contributing to changes in
COVID-19 trends, and other factors need to be considered when modelling changes in disease
over time. It is thus likely that Zhang et al.’s analysis overestimated the number of new cases in
Italy and NYC avoided by mask mandates alone. While masks appear to be an important element
in reducing transmission of the virus (7), Zhang et al.’s analysis should not be considered sound
evidence that mask mandates are sufficient to control or the primary factor controlling the spread
of COVID-19.
