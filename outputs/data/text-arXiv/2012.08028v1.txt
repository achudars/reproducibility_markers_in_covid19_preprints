sumer response to government policies in mitigating economic
loss, which is represented by spending and mobility. We perform the data analysis using interrupted time series analysis
(ITSA). We hypothesize that stimulus checks lead to a sharp
increase in spending and that state reopening leads to an
increase in foot traffic. We aim to quantify the short-term
and long-term effects of government measures on two kinds
of responses, consumer spending and foot traffic. Our result
builds on the emerging literature on consumer response to
COVID-19.

To battle with economic challenges during COVID-19 pandemic, the
US government implemented various measures to mitigate economic loss. From issuance of stimulus check to social distancing
measures, consumers had to constantly alter their behavior in response to government policies. Using anonymized card transactions
and mobile device-based location tracking data, we analyze the factors that contribute to these behavior changes, focusing on stimulus check issuance and state-wide reopening. Our finding suggests
that stimulus payment has a significant immediate effect of boosting spending, but it typically does not reverse a downward trend.
State-wide reopening had a small effect on spending. Foot traffic
increased gradually after stimulus check issuance, which coincided
or preceded several policy changes and confounding events (e.g.,
protests) in the US. Our results may be used to inform future economic recovery policies and their potential consumer response.

Data and Methods
We study consumer response patterns to COVID-19 using
card transactions and foot traffic data from SafeGraph. The
card transactions data is synthesized to protect individual
privacy while retaining 99.97% of the statistical attributes of
the original data. Note that these transactions are made from
challenger banks, payroll cards, and government cards, which
are mainly used by lower-income and younger populations. We
measured total spending by aggregating all of the transactions
per day. The foot traffic data is from opt-in smartphone devices
from tracking GPS across the US, which has information on
daily visits of 4 million points of interest across the country.
We took the daily number of visits and aggregated them by
day as well. We selected one state from the main regions in
the US, including Washington from the West Coast, New York
from the East Coast, Iowa from the Midwest, and Texas in
the South, to conduct our analysis. Each state had their own
reopening policy and a different reopening date.
To find out factors that contribute to changes in consumer
spending pattern, we conducted an ITSA on the date of issuing stimulus checks nationally, and the first state-ordered
reopening. We also performed seasonality adjustment since
the data contained weekly cycles. We used a Segmented Regression Analysis, which is one of the statistical models for
analyzing interrupted time series (11). We used intervention1
to represent the issuance of stimulus checks, and intervention2
to represent reopening date. The trend within each of the
three segments is approximated by a linear regression line.
The model is as follows:

Introduction

C

OVID-19 resulted in a global pandemic. It not only
presented a public health crisis, but also brought unprecedented economic challenges. In the US, unemployment
rate shot up from 3.8% in February to 13.0% in May (7).
To decrease the rate of new cases, US state governments implemented lockdown policies during the initial stages of the
pandemic. Consumers began to change their spending pattern
to respond to these policies and keep themselves safe, especially in sectors such as restaurants and retail. Foot traffic
declined 60% over March to April (4). Self-imposed precautionary behavior accounts for a large portion of the overall
drop in foot traffic, suggesting that stay-home orders served
as an informational treatment to warn citizens the severity of
the virus locally, in addition to formally restricting mobility
(4).
After the initial lockdown, the federal and state government implemented various measures to mitigate economic loss,
including stimulus packages and later limited reopening of
places of business. Various working papers and publications
have analyzed household responses to government policies. For
example, Baker et al. (1) and Chetty et al. (5) found that
spending increased sharply following the receipt of a stimulus
check, especially among low-income households, but little of
the increased spending flowed to businesses affected during
the pandemic. Chetty et al. (5) also built a platform that
aggregates data of consumer spending and other key indicators
during the pandemic. Coibion et al. investigated the effects
of stay-home orders on consumer spending and employment
using survey data (6).
In this report, we first analyze the overall consumer spending pattern during the pandemic. Then we analyze the con-

BRIEF REPORT

COVID-19 Effect on Consumer Spending and
Foot Traffic

the start of observation which is March 2, 2020; intervention1t
is an indicator variable coded 0 before April 17, 2020 and
coded 1 on and after it; intervention2t is an indicator variable
coded 0 before the date of reopening (differs across different
states) and coded 1 on and after it. β0 is the pre-intervention
baseline level, and β1 is the slope of daily spending before the
first intervention. β2 estimates the level change, or immediate
effect of the first intervention, and β3 estimates the change
in the slope of daily spending. Thus, β1 + β3 is the slope of
the period after intervention1, i.e., the average daily increase
or decrease of spending in this period. Similarly, β4 and β5
represent the level change and slope change due to the second
intervention, respectively. t represents the variability not
explained by the model.

Results
Aggregating total spending in the US, we found that the card
spending after the pandemic increased sharply after February
26, presumably due to the stockpiling of goods in the early
stages of the pandemic, then it dropped back to the baseline
level (Fig. 1). There are two peaks in the card transactions
data: February 26th is the day when many people started
panic buying, and April 13th is the day when the first round
of stimulus checks were deposited.
From our ITSA results (Fig. 2 and 3), the estimated coefficients of intervention1 are large for all four states, with
p-values less than 2e−16 (for New York, the p-value is 6e−4),
meaning there is an immediate significant jump in consumer
spending after receiving the stimulus checks. For New York
state, the estimated slope of spending shifts from negative to
positive (p-value is 4e−4), but the slope changes in the three
other states are not significant.
Although the reopening date varies by state, the immediate
effects of intervention2 are all significant among the states, but
the amount of change is much less than that of intervention1.
New York and Texas have p-value equal to approximately 0.04;
Washington has p-value equal to 0.006, and Iowa has p-value
of 1.85e−6. The change of slope after the second intervention
is not significant in any state except for New York, where the
spending slope decreases significantly.
We also performed ITSA on the foot traffic data to find out
whether similar patterns exist (Fig. 4 and 5). The immediate
effect of intervention1 is not significant (except for NY at
p-value < 0.05), but the slope change is significant in all four
states (p-value < 0.01). The immediate effect of intervention2
is significant in all states except for NY (p-value < 0.05). For
all of the four states, the change of slope after intervention2 is
negative, and in WA and NY, the decrease in slope is significant
(p-value < 0.1 and p-value < 0.01, respectively).
Comparing spending and foot traffic patterns, the issuance
of stimulus checks had a significant short-term increase in
spending, but the immediate effect is less significant for foot
traffic. In contrast, spending dropped back to the baseline
level in the long-run, and foot traffic saw a gradual increase.
The trend in the third period (after reopening) is also different:
while people are making more trips outside, the total amount
of spending decreased.

much changes in foot traffic patterns. Over the long term,
spending dropped back to the baseline level and foot traffic
slowly returned to normal as well. This implies that stimulus check payment only had a temporary effect on spending.
The impact of the second intervention, state-wide reopening
policies, is less significant for spending, suggesting that lifting
lockdown policies has a mild impact on spending. We also
see a flattening of the increasing trend for foot traffic in the
data, which could be due to foot traffic approaching to the
baseline level. This connects with the results from Cronin et
al. (4) that a large fraction of social distancing is driven by
voluntary precaution instead of legal restrictions, so lifting
these restrictions does not have a huge impact on mobility.
We also see that coastal regions had shown more flattening in
foot traffic than central regions after reopening.
Our results can be useful to policymakers when designing
post-pandemic economic recovery plans. Providing financial
support is a great way of boosting spending in the short
run, but the impact is temporary. This contributes to a
broader body of literature on the impact of fiscal policies
during recessions, such as the Great Recession in 2008. For
example, Fetai (9) showed that fiscal policies can increase
spending thus shortening the length of the financial crisis, and
Reichling and Whalen (10) analyzed the direct and indirect
effects of fiscal policies. Our findings also inform businesses
when they react to government policies during a pandemic.
Since reopening plans may have a mild impact on mobility,
businesses should still strive for connecting to customers online.
Colleen et al. (8) found that consumers’ purchase decisions
are strongly influenced by how brands react to the pandemic.
Future work could examine how consumer risk perception
affects their response (e.g., spending and foot traffic) to major
events (e.g., implementations of policies and interventions)
during the pandemic.
