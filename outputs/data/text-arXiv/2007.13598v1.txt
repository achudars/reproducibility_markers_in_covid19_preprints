Absorption and scattering of the impinging electromagnetic waves are the two fundamental operations describing the
energy exchange of any, organic or inorganic, particle with its environment. In the case of virion cells, substantial
extinction power, counting both absorbing and scattering effects, is a prerequisite for performing a variety of coupling
actions against the viral particles and, thus, a highly sought-after feature. By considering realistic dispersion for the
dielectric permittivity of proteins and a core-shell modeling allowing for rigorous formulation via Mie theory, we
report optical extinction resonances for corona-virions at mid-infrared range that are not significantly perturbed by
changes in the objects size or the background host. Our findings indicate the optimal regime for interaction of photonic
radiation with viral particles and may assist towards the development of equipment for thermal damage, disintegration
or neutralization of coronavirus cells.

INTRODUCTORY COMMENT

The energy exchange between an impinging light beam and
virus particles is a cornerstone in several biophotonic operations with important applications in Microbiology, Pharmacology, Medical Physics and Biochemistry. The study of
this interaction between virions and electromagnetic fields
has been greatly assisted by a large set of analytical methods and physical concepts reported for inorganic particles1 .
That inevitably led in their implementation and translation to
understand how microbes absorb and re-emit visible light in
various directions2 or what are the biophysical processes behind ultraviolet germicidal irradiation3 . Furthermore, applications of diverse types of scattering techniques to systems
of microorganisms have been reviewed4 while the diffusion
behavior of viral macromolecules into liquids has been extensively elaborated5 . Importantly, highly sensitive virus detection has become possible based on optical trapping6 or via the
reactive shift of a whispering-gallery mode7 , facilitating convenient medical diagnosis and food inspection. In addition,
the coupling of the incident beams with virions has been utilized in measuring the refractive index of the cells with high
precision8 and analyzing single viruses with a resolution comparable to that of electron microscopy9 .
Mie theory10 , admitting rigorous solution to the scattering
of electromagnetic waves by multilayered spheres, makes a
powerful tool for treating similar problems involving radiation impinging on virus particles, due to their quasi-spherical
shapes. In particular, simple formulas are derived towards the
interpretation of the characteristic anomalies in the optical activity of membrane suspensions11 of for the evaluation of collective backscattering from abundant viruses into sea water12 .
Mie scattering has been also used to model the light intensity
produced by virion-like nano-objects in biosensors13 , flow
cytometers14 and phase microscopes setups15 . Finally, analytical expressions have been provided for the shifts in the resonance frequencies of spherical dielectric microresonators ow-

medium of permittivity εb . The virion is bombarded by an electromagnetic (EM) pulse of high intensity and central wavelength λ .

Coronaviruses constitute a special category of viruses
whose genome is hosted into protein cells, with rod-shaped
spikes projecting from their surfaces; these elongated bumps,

2
when seen though electron microscope, create an image mimicking the solar corona, to which the viruses owe their name.
Since the 2020 global pandemic outbreak18,19 , the whole
world became familiar with the term “coronavirus” while
medical scientists struggle to handle20 that continued threat,
responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths and unprecedented socio-economic damage. Due to the alarming situation, numerous experimental efforts have been devoted to
test the photonic response of that specific coronavirus (SARSCoV-2) for various objectives like the fast biosensing that secures reliable viral disease diagnosis21 or the development of
cellular nanosponges that are allegedly able to neutralize the
virus22 . Interestingly, several studies also indicate that phototherapy has immense potential to reduce the impact of coronavirus diseases23 , and offers suggested ways that the healthcare industry can integrate modern light technologies in the
fight against SARS-CoV-2 and its mutant versions.
However, analytical modeling via Mie theory is very
rarely24 involved to works studying the light-coronavirus interactions, despite its rigorous yet simple formulation. In this
paper, we systematically examine the Mie scattering of a protein nanosphere covered by a suitably homogenized shell emulating the presence of amine radial spikes. The size of the
core25 and the spikes length26 are varying between their realistic limits, according to the adopted conceptual layouts26
and the images taken from electron microscopes27 . As far
as the background media that host the virions are concerned,
they are also selected based on the presently available data,
since the virus can transmit through the air28 , while can exist into blood29 and the human organs like liver30 as well.
The impinging electromagnetic pulse is harmonic with frequency that spans from the hard ultraviolet to the long infrared
part of the spectrum; the dispersion of the incorporated materials across this extensive band is taken into account, based
on experimental measurements contained in well-established
references31–33 . Our aim is to maximize the extinction power
from the core-shell nanoparticle, which is a prerequisite for
any action against the virion from disintegration to isolation.
The influence of the geometric characteristics of the considered model on the observable quantity is identified and the
optimal mid-infrared wavelengths leading to substantial extinction are determined. Importantly, the reported resonances
are found highly insensitive to structural changes regardless
of the background and thus are applicable to ensembles of
corona-virions of diverse features. Our findings may inspire
clinical research towards the development of diagnostic products and devices that require significant power interaction with
SARS-CoV-2 particles to dissolve or neutralize them.

PROPOSED APPROACH

A.

Core-Shell Model

As shown in the illustrative sketch of Fig. 1(a), a typical
corona-virion is composed of a homogeneous core (nucleocapsid), containing a mixture of proteins25 , surrounded by radial spikes of glycoprotein34 . We treat all proteins as diiso-

propylamine, also known as DIPA, whose dispersive permittivity εc = εc (λ ) can be easily found. As far as the crown of
protein rods is concerned, the simplest way to model it is as a
homogeneous shell of permittivity given by a weighed sum of
the protein dielectric constant εc and that of the background
medium εb :
εs = (1 − s)εb + sεc ,

(1)

where 0 < s < 1 is the filling factor indicating the percentage
of the corona volume occupied by the spikes.
We could follow alternative and more accurate approaches
to model the photonic setup of the virion, like approximating the shell by quasi-homogeneous multilayers35 , considering radial anisotropy36,37 or even assuming systropic properties for the fabric of the spherical particles38 . In this case,
the scalar εs would have been replaced by a uniaxial tensor
[εs ] = diag(εr , εt , εt ) in spherical coordinates (r, θ , ϕ). The radial permittivity εr = εs will be given by (1) since the corresponding depolarization factor of a needle vanishes. On the
contrary, the transversal constant (along local θ , ϕ directions),
εt , will be written as39 :
εt = εb

(εb + εc ) − s(εb − εc )
.
(εb + εc ) + s(εb − εc )

(2)

The solution of the wave equation into such a medium involves cylindrical Bessel functions Jν ,Yν of orders40 :
r

εt
ν = νn =
1 + 4 n(n + 1),
(3)

εr
for n ∈ N∗ .
However, the size of the virion is small (average radius b ∼
=
60 nm) and the regarded wavelengths large (average λ ∼
= 3500
nm, mid-infrared); accordingly, the incoming beams are not
expected to “feel” a more advanced setup emphasizing on the
geometry details. In other words, a very slowly moving wave
will perceive the very complicated actual structure of the protein spikes in the same way as a homogeneous cladding of
texture determined by (1). Thus, we advocate that the model
in 1(b), where the core (permittivity εc ) of radius a is engulfed
by the shell (permittivity εs ) of size (b − a) and host into a homogeneous background (permittivity εb ), captures sufficiently
the electromagnetic interactions and the underlying photonic
power interplay between the incident fields and the particle.
Note finally that the Bessel order (3) becomes complex if the
permittivities (1),(2) have non-zero imaginary parts, which is
the case in our consideration; as a result, numerical issues41
may emerge if the shell is assumed anisotropic. That makes
an extra reason to follow the isotropic and homogeneous modeling via (1).

B.

Mie-Theory Formulation

We assume that the virion of Fig. 1(b) is illuminated by
an electromagnetic beam in the form of monochromatic plane
wave (with free-space oscillating wavelength λ ≡ 2π/k0 ),
traveling into the background host. As mentioned above, the

3
symbols (r, θ , ϕ) are used for the related spherical coordinates
centralized at the cell, while the equivalent Cartesian ones
read (x, y, z); the suppressed harmonic time is of the form
e+i2πct/λ , where c is the speed of light into free space. For
simplicity and without loss of generality (due to the spherical symmetry), we assume that the incident wave propagates
along +z axis and its electric field vector is always parallel to x axis oscillating with amplitude E0 > 0 (measured in
Volt/meter). This background field can be decoupled in two
terms, each of which satisfies Maxwell’s laws: one term with
no radial electric component (TE) and another one with no radial magnetic component (TM). These terms can be expressed
as series of spherical harmonics, which dictate the θ − and ϕ−
dependence of the field quantities in all the regions defined by
the concentric and entire surfaces, according to the rigorous
Mie theory10 .
After imposing the necessary boundary conditions, the scattered fields for r > b (electric field vector of TE set and magnetic one for TM set), are written as42 :

brevity43,44 .
The power Pscat carried by the TE and TM scattered component, which constitutes a self-consistent electromagnetic field
into the background host, expresses how much the sphere perturbs the background field distribution externally to it. It can
be easily computed with use of Poynting’s theorem and expansions of hn (kb r) for large arguments kb r  1 (in the far

Parameters and Observables

Before proceeding to the numerical results and the discussion, let us first clarify the value ranges of the parameters incorporated into our model. In particular, the incident electromagnetic pulse is taken with a free-space central wavelength
λ belonging to extensive band spanning from hard ultraviolet
short waves (λ = 150 nm, UV-C) to long infrared radiation
(λ = 15 µm, IR-C). In addition, we consider an external radius for the virion varying into the interval: 30 nm < b <
100 nm, representing an assortment of various sizes19 and a
radii ratio with 0.5 < a/b < 0.9, corresponding to different
lengths of the protein spikes46 . When it comes to the density
s of the spikes, we regard all possible values: 0 < s < 1 from
an absent crown (s = 0) to a big homogeneous protein sphere
of radius b (s = 1).
The variation for the dispersive permittivity for the homogeneous core εc = εc (λ ) is depicted in Fig. 2(a), where the
data has been taken from reliable source31 and expanded to
short wavelength limit47 . We notice that the regarded protein (diisopropylamine, DIPA) is lossless across large parts
of the wavelength spectrum except for two bands around
λ∼
= 3.5 µm and λ ∼
= 9.5 µm; these losses are responsible

4
for the corresponding variations of the real part Re[εc ], according to the Kramers–Kronig relations that demand causal
responses1 . As far as the permittivity of the host is concerned,
it is lossless and non-dispersive for air and human organs like
liver33 as shown in Fig. 2(b). In the case of blood32 , εb exhibits some variation accompanied by moderate losses that
are ignored (Im[εb ] = 0) for a better formulation of the primary plane-wave excitation; otherwise a modification should
be performed48 . Note that the real parts of the dielectric constants for the proteins, the human organs and the human blood
are very close each other making a configuration of low textural contrast, where photonic power concentration is particularly challenging. Such a feature “pushed” us towards large
operational frequencies (ultra-small wavelengths λ ), as indicated above; only then the incoming light can interact strongly
or resonate49 with an inclusion constituting a so mild perturbation of the refractive index.
When it comes to the output of the system, we normalize
the absorbed and scattered power by the power of the incident
illumination passing through the geometrical cross section of
√
πE02 b2 εb
; in this way, the response
2η0

the scatterer, namely Pinc =
of the virion becomes more meaningful. The most important
quantity, however, is the extinction power Pext ≡ Pscat + Pabs ,
namely the sum of scattering and absorption from (4),(5), so it
represents the total effect of the particle on radiation traveling
into the background medium; thus, the basic metric of our
study is given by:

(6)

The series (6) is rapidly converging once the optical size a/λ
of the virion is small41 , which is the case in the present formulation. Our aim will be to identify the conditions under which
that ratio Pext /Pinc is maximized so that the external electromagnetic beam couples optimally with the virion admitting its
disintegration, conversion or neutralization.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Maximal Extinction Power

In Fig. 3(a), we represent the extinction power Pext normalized by the incident power Pinc with respect to the core-shell
radii ratio a/b for the three different background media indicated by Fig. 2(b). We notice that the quantity showing how
much the particle absorbs the radiation and “shakes” the local field distribution gets increased once the virion’s corona
becomes thinner indicating a more substantial power concentration around the core. In addition, the beneficial influence of
the material contrast between the spherical cell and the background on Pext /Pinc can be identified since the highest values
are recorded for airborne particles; on the contrary, the extinction power is small when εb ∼
= εc , as happening in the case of
virions hosted into human organs. Quantitatively speaking,
the magnitude Pext /Pinc , at least for the adopted short wavelength (λ ∼
= 250 nm), is quite high and, for a densely pop-

ulated crown by protein spikes, it surpasses unity. In other
words, the presence of particle participates in a huge power
exchange with its environment concerning the whole electromagnetic radiation passing through its transection. Obviously
a Pext /Pinc > 1 is feasible since the object may interact with
rays that are not directly incident on its spherical surface but
travel in the vicinity of it50 .
In Fig. 3(b), we show the metric Pext /Pinc from (6) as a
function of the filling factor s for alternative hosts. A rapidly
increasing trend is observed, demonstrating once more the
amplifying effect of the needle-shaped rods on the particlebeam interaction. Furthermore, the textural contrast is again
recognized as a factor that boosts the extinction power, while
the measured quantity is somehow higher compared to Fig.
3(a). It is also noticed that, despite the low difference between the refractive index of blood and organs as shown in
Fig. 2(b), the corresponding extinction power in human blood
background is much higher; indeed, what counts is the spread
between εb and the protein’s permittivity εc as depicted in Fig.
2(a).
Given the fact that Fig. 3 concerns the interplay of the particle with the incoming illumination at ultra-violet frequencies, it is important to understand the response of the spherical virion across the whole of the considered band. In particular, in Fig. 4(a), we represent the variation of the ratio
Pext /Pinc with respect to oscillation wavelength λ for the three

5
regarded hosts. When the wavelengths are tiny (λ < 1 µm),
it is natural to spot a declining trend since the particle is not
optically big enough to interact substantially with the incident
electromagnetic pulse. However, beyond 1.5 µm, where proteins exhibit significant losses (see Fig. 2(a)), the metric increases by orders of magnitudes to reach a strong local maximum at λ ∼
= 3.37 µm, regardless of the background. Therefore, in order to maximally engage with that specific type of
corona-virions, one should concentrate the impinging power
in the spectral vicinity of that frequency; this conclusion is
one of the major findings of our study. Similar resonances
are exploited for protein molecule monolayers detection by
covering the sensor to produce a controllable amount of resonance redshift51 . It should be finally stressed that the results
are host-indifferent only when the operating wavelengths λ
are large enough; for λ < 1 µm, the relative order of Pext /Pinc
for different hosts is dictated by the material contrast of Fig.
2, as happening in Fig. 3.

incident power through the spherical cross section Pinc as a function
of the incoming wavelength λ for: (a) various host environments εb
(b = 60 nm), (b) various external sizes b of the virions (in blood).
Plot parameters: a/b = 0.7, s = 0.5. The strong local optimum at
mid-infrared (λ ∼
= 3370 nm) is spotted, regardless of background and
size.

In Fig. 4(b), we repeat the calculations of Fig. 4(a) but
for different sizes of virions b, all existing into human blood.
The variation of Pext /Pinc is similar to that of Fig. 4(a) but the
larger size makes a difference and increases, on average, the

represented metric, even at lower frequencies (λ > 1.5 µm).
However, the major maximum at λ ∼
= 3.37 µm discussed
above, is present no matter how small is the virion and, importantly, it gives almost the same relative extinction power. Such
a feature remarks further the significance of the reported resonance, since the electromagnetic beam concentrated around
a single wavelength allows for maximal interplay with an
ensemble of virus particles possessing various sizes. Note
that mid-infrared frequency range makes a privileged band
for biosensing52 and chemical identification of biomolecules
through their vibrational fingerprints, namely, photonic operation at this resonance is experimentally feasible53 .

B.

Power Spatial Distribution

After having understood the influence of structural (a/b, s),
textural (several background) and spectral (λ ) parameters on
the way that corona-virions interact with the incident beams, it
would be meaningful to show the spatial distribution of electromagnetic power inside and outside the core-shell particle
for characteristic cases. In Fig. 5(a), we show the relative
field quantity |E/E0 |2 across zx plane, when the structure is
excited at the optimal mid-infrared wavelength (λ ∼
= 3.37 µm)
into human blood host; the represented quantity may be discontinuous as one crosses an interface between two different
media, due to the change in texture. By inspection of Fig.
5(a), one directly notices that the values of the electric field
magnitude |E| are very close to that of the incident plane wave
E0 ; however, it is natural given the very low permittivity contrast of the virion with its environment. On the contrary, the
power concentration at the interior of the spherical volume is
counter-intuitive and noteworthy since it clearly demonstrates
the substantial interaction of the entire virion with the incoming pulse. As recently reported54 , such a physical focus of
light is useful to photomedicine while can be directly utilized
for thermal damage in biological applications. That significant property is also illustrated when the zy plane is considered (Fig. 5(b)) but the distribution is not identical to that of
Fig. 5(a) due to the vectorial nature of the incident plane wave
which is polarized along x axis.
To show that the bright spots of Figs 5(a),5(b) are not easily
achieved, in Figs 5(c),5(d) we show the distribution of |E/E0 |2
when the incoming wavelength is arbitrarily picked (λ = 2.2
µm). Despite the fact that the pulse is faster making the virion
look larger and admitting it to develop more complex dynamics, the field into the object is lower than the background level
forming a bipolar pattern; as a result, the ability of the primary
excitation to engage with the particle is severely diminished
compared to the optimal case of Fig. 5(a). Similar conclusions can be drawn by juxtaposing Figs 5(c),5(d) referring to
zy plane; in the scenario of randomly selected wavelength, the
pattern is omni-directional and the power is weak into the scatterer, contrary to the signal focusing exhibited in Fig. 5(d).
In Fig. 6, higher frequencies are examined; more specifically, in Fig. 6(a) we show the electric field across zx plane
under violet color illumination (λ = 350 nm). One directly
notices that the field is stronger at the rear side of the virion

nm (arbitrary smaller wavelength). Plot parameters: a/b = 0.7, s =
0.5, b = 65 nm, human blood background. The blue lines indicate
the boundaries between two different media.

In Fig. 7, we examine the effect of the radii ratio a/b on the
spatial distribution of the electric field |E/E0 |2 , when working close to the reported optimal point (λ ∼
= 3.37 µm). It
is apparent that the power accumulation is significant in all
the considered cases and gets higher for an increasing a/b,
as also indicated by Fig. 3(a). In the same way that Fig.
4(b) shows insensitivity of the identified effect from the viral size b, Fig. 7 designates that the resonance is practically
indifferent to the corona thickness (b − a) and thus a universal effectiveness against large families of virions possessing
diverse characteristics, is demonstrated. Such an optical trap
allows for manipulation and energy exchange with individual viral nanoparticles that can lead to their disintegration or
neutralization; similar biomagnifying effects are reported for
different applications55 like optical imaging and assembly of
bionanomaterials. The experimental potential of the described
effect is further underlined by the fact that this type of resonances make typical spectrophotometers to be sensitive in
the activity of individual enzymes; thus, it renders the device suitable56 for on-chip antibody or antigen detection and
chromogenic-based operations such as bacteria detection.

but, if an averaging is performed, the relative signal within
the volume of the particle is comparable to that of Fig. 5(a),
even though the incident wavelength is ten times smaller and
much less harmful for the surroundings (healthy cells, tissues,
organs) into human body. It is also found that the field increases along z axis into the homogeneous core, contrary to
what is happening to Figs 5(a),5(b), where the opposite trend
is recorded. In Fig. 6(b), a larger wavelength corresponding
to red color (λ = 700 nm) is assumed; we observe a substantially poorer relative power concentration compared to both
Figs 5(a),6(a) for a much faster pulse than the one operated at
the optimal regime.

CONCLUDING REMARK

A single corona virion is modeled as a homogeneous spherical core surrounded by a conformal isotropic shell, under illumination from electromagnetic pulses. Rigorous Mie theory is applied to obtain the analytical solution of the formulated boundary value problem and compute the total extinction

7
power of the particle. This quantity indicates how successfully
the considered cells interacts with the incoming fields and is
found to be maximal at a specific mid-infrared resonance that
is independent from the structural characteristics or the background host. A substantial power exchange between impinging beams and the object is necessary for a series of actions
dealing with the virion from thermal damage and dissolution
to neutralization and isolation; therefore, the reported findings may pave the way to more efficient radiation treatments
against SARS-CoV-2.
The proposed model can be refined to include anisotropic
multilayers both at the core for more detailed description of
the engulfed genome and at the shell to take into account the
radial distribution of the protein spikes. Such a process will
involve complex-ordered Bessel functions calling for careful computation41 ; similarly, alternative excitation beams or
time-restricted causal pulses instead of plane waves can be
taken into account by properly evaluating complex Fourier
integrals57 . Importantly, an interesting follow-up of our approach would be to regard clusters of cells and investigate
their collective dynamics by implementing suitable transforms
for the summation58,59 of the responses from randomly or deterministically placed cells60 . In this way, the work at hand
can be considered as the first step towards the successful modeling of corona-virions and the derivation of analytical formulas for the exchanged power which will simplify significantly
the subsequent optimizations and make easier the designation
of optimal operation regimes.
