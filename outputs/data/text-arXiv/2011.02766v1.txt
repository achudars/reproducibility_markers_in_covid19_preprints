in Senegal
Massamba Diouf and Babacar Mbaye Ndiaye
Abstract. In this article, we analyze the spread of cases resulting from community
transmission of COVID-19 in Senegal in order to identify statistical associations. The
identification and knowledge of the factors associated with this community transmission can be a decision support tool to limit the spread of the disease. We estimate
parameters and evaluate the growth factor, community rate, weekly increase and
daily difference, and make forecasting to help on how to find concrete actions to
control the situation.
Keywords. COVID-19, community, forecasting, logistic model, transmission factors.

1. Introduction
In December 2019, the outbreak of COVID-19 associated with a new coronavirus was a
significant event. The ensuing spread prompted the World Health Organization to declare a pandemic on March 11, 2020, after it was considered a health emergency of global
concern [1]. The whole world is thus facing an unprecedented health crisis from the coronavirus with the number of people affected which is gradually increasing with more than
25,000,000 confirmed cases for nearly 800,000 deaths at the end of August 2020 [2].
Less affected by the pandemic compared to other continents, Africa is still resisting with
a COVID-19 death toll reaching nearly 30,000 deaths while confirmed cases have exceeded 1,130,000 (August 31, 2020) according to the African control center and disease
prevention [3].
This progression of the disease in this zone raises concerns as well among the governors
as among the health experts with regard to the living conditions of the communities, the
insufficient resources to face this type of threat and the noted failures. in some health
systems in Africa. In Senegal, at the start of the epidemic, the government declared a
state of emergency with several health, economic and security measures taken to reduce
the spread of COVID-19. Then in the face of socio-economic stress, an easing followed by
the lifting of restrictive measures seems to give a boost to the disease with the meteoric
increase in incident cases. From March to April, the number of cases was 933. In the period from May-June, people sick with the coronavirus increased by 5,860. From July to

August, the number of cases in Senegal increased by 6,818. This progression affecting almost all the health districts of all the regions of the country results for the most part from
the resurgence of cases resulting from community transmission. These community cases
are characterized by their difficulty in tracing to identify the source of contamination, but
also by the limited possibilities for identifying and isolating the various associated contacts. During the three periods described above, the number of community cases among
people positive for the coronavirus in Senegal was 109 for the first two-month period,
709 for the second two-month period and for the third two-month period July-August
2384. This development reflects an epidemiological situation including the magnitude
and seriousness with regard to the consequences related to lethality and other impacts
of all kinds, remain worrying. The determinants and/or variables linked to this form of
transmission are not sufficiently documented in Senegal. Therefore, the identification and
knowledge of the factors associated with this community transmission can constitute a
decision support tool to limit the spread of the disease, on the one hand through targeted
actions, to control the epidemic and its externalities on the other hand. The objective of
this work is to model the variables potentially involved in the spread of cases resulting
from community transmission of COVID-19 in Senegal in order to identify statistical
associations.
In our previous articles [4, 5, 6, 7, 8], we try to forecast the pandemic for Senegal using
the SIR, stochastic SIR and machine learning. Here, we give forecasting pandemic size of
community cases for Senegal and daily predictions using the logistic model. We assume
that the model is a reasonable description of the epidemic. Full daily reports are available
in [12]. First, we collect the pandemic data from [12], from March 03, 2020 to September
20, 2020. Then, we propose a logistic growth model for forecasting. Variables such as
community rate, growth factor, daily difference (daily variations) and weekly increase
(number of cumulative cases per week) were defined to better understand the dynamics
of the development of community cases in Senegal.
The article is organized as follows. In section 2, we present some data analysis followed
by the Logistic growth model for forecasting in section 3. Finally, in section 4, we present
conclusions and perspectives.

2. Data analysis
The simulations are carried out from data in [12], from March 02, 2020, to September
20, 2020. The numerical tests were performed by using the Python with Panda library
[13], and were executed on a computer with the following characteristics: intel(R) Core-i7
CPU 2.60GHz, 24.0Gb of RAM, under UNIX system.
According to daily reports, we first analyze and make some data preprocessing before
simulations. The cumulative numbers of confirmed and community cases are illustrated
in Figure 1, which shows a progression of community cases as a function of the total
number of confirmed cases. It seems to mean that the increase in confirmed cases correlates with the increase in community cases.
Figure 2 shows the variation in the number of community cases with the various institutional measures taken since the declaration of the index community case on March 21,
2020; as well as the religious events that occurred during this period.
The restriction of barrier measures has helped stabilize community cases (RBP, July 10,
2020 from Figure 2), with a slight increase followed by a decrease.

Figure 2. Senegal: community cases per day
The Aid Al Kabir (Tabaski, July 31, 2020) intensively increases the cases, because during this period people mix from house to house. This increase in cases has prompted the
government to strengthen barrier measures (RenBM, August 31, 2020). This increase in
cases has prompted the government to strengthen barrier measures (RenBM, August 31,
2020). That made it possible to reduce the transmission.
In managing the pandemic, controlling movement is a sure way to limit the spread. This
is why slogans urging everyone to stay at home were widely shared on social media to
persuade more.

2.1. Community rate
First, let’s define the community rate.
number of community cases
× 100
number of confirmed cases
The community rate (per day) is given by Figure 3, and it’s average and median values
in Table 1. The analysis of Figure 3 shows a variable evolution of the rate with extreme

average community rate 22.562284
median community rate 17.931034
Table 1. Average and median values

2.2. Growth factor
The growth factor is the factor by which a quantity multiplies itself over time. The
formula used is:
Every day’s new community cases
new community cases on the previous day
Remark 2.1.
• A growth factor constant at 1 indicates there is no change in any kind
of cases.
• A growth factor above 1 indicates an increase in corresponding cases.
• A growth factor above 1 but trending downward is a positive sign, whereas a growth
factor constantly above 1 is the sign of exponential growth.
The growth factor for community cases is given by Figure 4, and it’s average and median
growth factors in Table 2. The two largest growth peaks (8 and 13) are reached in May
and July.

The Daily difference for community cases is given by Figure 5. The greatest variations
are obtained between the end of July and the beginning of August (period of after Aid
El Kabir).
2.4. Weekly increase
The curve and the histogram for the weekly increase in number of community cases are
illustrated in Figures 6 and 7, respectively.

We see that week 23 was fatal for community cases, which corresponds to the period
after Aid El Kabir.

3. Logistic grow model for community cases
In this section, we a perform forecast with the logistics model ([9, 10, 11]) to predict the
final size of coronavirus epidemy, for community cases in Senegal.
The logistic model is a data-driven phenomenological model. Thus its predictions are
as good as useful data are and as good as it can mimics epidemy dynamics. It’s in a

way mimic both epidemy spreading and its control i.e. prevention measures. When daily
predictions of epidemic size begin to converge, we can say that epidemy is in control.
3.1. The model
In mathematical epidemiology, the epidemic dynamics can be described by the following
variant of logistic growth model:

dC
C
(3.1)
= rC 1 −
dt
K
where C is an accumulated number of community cases, r > 0 infection rate, and K > 0
is the final epidemic size (of community cases). If C(0) = C0 > 0 is the initial number of
cases then the solution of (3.1) is:
C=

K
1 + Ae−rt

(3.2)

0
where A = K−C
C0 .
When t  1, assuming K  C0 , and therefore A  1. We have the natural growth:



C0
ert
Kert
=
≈ C0 ert
C = rt
e +A
1 − C0 /K
1 + ert /A

When t −→ ∞ the number of community cases follows the Weibull function:
h
i

C = K 1 − Ae−rt + ... ≈ K 1 − e−r(t−t0 )
2

d C
The growth rate dC
dt reaches its maximum when dt2 = 0. From this condition, we obtain
that the growth rate peak occurs in time:
lnA
tp =
r
K
At this time the number of cases is Cp = 2 and the growth rate is
 dC 
rK
=
dt p
4
To answer the question about doubling time ∆t, i.e., the time takes to double the number
of cases we solve C(t + ∆t) = 2C(t) for ∆t . Result is

ln2 1  1
− ln
− e−rt − t
∆t =
r
r
A
The first term represents initial exponential growth, then ∆t increases with t. When
K
t −→ tp = lnrA , i.e., when C −→ K
2 , then ∆t −→ ∞. For C ≥ 2 doubling time lost its
meaning. For more details for the logistic growth model, see [9, 10, 11].

3.2. Numerical analysis
In Senegal, the first case of coronavirus appeared on March 2, 2020. But the first community case was detected on March 21, 2020. First, we collect the pandemic data from
[12], from March 21, 2020, to September 20, 2020. Then, we perform a forecast with the
logistics model to predict the final size of coronavirus epidemy, for community cases.
The size will be approximately 5100 ∓ 130 cases (Table 3). The estimated coefficients
are given in Table 3, and that the peak of the epidemic was on August 12, 2020. It seems
that the epidemic in Senegal is in the ending stage (see Figures 8 and 9).
The short-term forecasting is given in Table 4 where we see that the discrepancy of actual
and forecasted number of cases is within 3%. However, actual and predicted daily new

8

cases are scattered and vary between 26% to 600%.
On September 25, 2020, the actual number of cases was 3697, and the daily number of
cases was 15. Prediction in Table 4 is cumulative 3993 cases and 29 daily cases. The
errors are 48.276% and 7.413%, respectively.

4. Conclusion and Perspectives
These extensive statistical analyzes allow us to make predictions about the future of
the pandemic in Senegal. In the first phase of the response (at the national level), the
emphasis was more on government actions, the involvement of health professionals, and
uncompromising communication. Then, with the increase in cases of so-called community
transmission, the epidemic entered its active phase with an increasing incidence in society. This worrying situation has led to the strengthening of various measures: the state of
emergency with a curfew, the prohibition or restriction of interurban travel, gatherings
but above all barrier gestures such as wearing a mask. This context of restriction, like
everywhere in the world, has caused a gloomy economic environment in Senegal forcing
the State to readjust measures. An easing of restrictions is announced first and then, a
little later, the lifting of institutional measures, without first giving the necessary guarantees and support for the response strategy at the global level. Decisions that seemed
to help boost the spread of the pandemic nationally with areas, initially free from the
disease, which recorded their first cases of COVID-19.
Despite these considerations, religious events like the Eid feast have taken place during
this critical period. The festival of Eid or sacrifice of the sheep, in Senegalese sociology is
a symbol and a pillar of stability and solidarity. The individuals preferentially celebrate it
in a family or in the community. It is a time of exchanges of civilities, prayers in communion and sharing meals. This could facilitate the breaking of the barrier measures against
the spread of COVID-19. Moreover, one to two weeks after the July 31 celebration of this
holiday in Senegal, the rate of contamination of the disease has almost tripled with all
the affected regions and the resurgence of cases resulting from community transmission.
This situation further prompted the state to make the general wearing of masks compulsory in public places, commerce, transport, schools and universities. Wearing a mask
remains a beneficial measure for many countries and reduces contamination by limiting
the projection of postilions (especially in public). This fact seems to contribute to the
control of the disease in Senegal which, since the beginning of September, has been in a
downward dynamic.
According to an optimistic estimate, the pandemic in Senegal will end soon, while for

10

most countries of the world, the blow of the anti-pandemic will be no later than the end
of the year.
