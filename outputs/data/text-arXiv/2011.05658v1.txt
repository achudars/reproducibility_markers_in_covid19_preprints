Abstract
Recent studies exploiting city-level time series have shown that, around the world,
several crimes declined after COVID-19 containment policies have been put in place. Using data at the community-level in Chicago, this work aims to advance our understanding on how public interventions affected criminal activities at a finer spatial scale. The
analysis relies on a two-step methodology. First, it estimates the community-wise causal
impact of social distancing and shelter-in-place policies adopted in Chicago via Structural Bayesian Time-Series across four crime categories (i.e., burglary, assault, narcoticsrelated offenses, and robbery). Once the models detected the direction, magnitude and
significance of the trend changes, Firth’s Logistic Regression is used to investigate the
factors associated to the statistically significant crime reduction found in the first step of
the analyses. Statistical results first show that changes in crime trends differ across communities and crime types. This suggests that beyond the results of aggregate models lies
a complex picture characterized by diverging patterns. Second, regression models provide mixed findings regarding the correlates associated with significant crime reduction:
several relations have opposite directions across crimes with population being the only
factor that is stably and positively associated with significant crime reduction.

1 Introduction
The onset and spread of COVID-19 has affected nearly every continent and many millions of people. Not only has the virus infected, sickened, and killed scores of individuals as the virus moved from Asia, to Europe, to the US, and onwards to Central
and South America, but it has also affected the lives of persons living in each of the
countries that have experienced widespread infection. In particular, at the behest of
public health officials, citizens of just about every country have been subject to social
distancing measures, stay-at-home policies, shelter-in-place designations, and many
were forced to remain in their homes for well over a month at a time in order to contain the spread of the virus.
As a result of these policy prescriptions, a wide array of research questions can be
considered. For present purposes, we focus on the extent to which various policies
associated with containing the spread of COVID-19 may have affected the frequency
and patterning of criminal activity. Our interest in this space is not novel, as many
have started to examine these questions. At the same time, most studies that do exist
have used aggregate temporal series of crime data. These studies are certainly useful
as they help to examine changes in crime before and after policies have been put into
place at large units of analyses (Ashby, 2020; Abrams, 2020; Campedelli et al., 2020;
Leslie and Wilson, 2020; Mohler et al., 2020; Piquero et al., ming; Payne et al., ming;
Payne and Morgan, 2020a; Halford et al., 2020; Gerell et al., 2020). However, these
studies have been unable to separate the spatial meso characteristics of changes in
crime trends. The current study attends precisely to this issue. Herein, we use data
from the 77 communities of Chicago to examine whether daily trends differ across
crimes and communities and which factors are correlated with reductions in crime.
Before we present the results of our study, we provide some background material in
order to set the stage for our work and our specific analyses.

Background
COVID-19 in Illinois and Chicago
In the matter of a few months, the COVID-19 pandemic massively hit most regions of
the world. Aside from its deleterious effects throughout the world, the United States
is also experiencing the dramatic diffusion of the virus, currently being the country
with the highest number of confirmed cases and deaths due to the disease. At the
end of August, Illinois has the sixth-highest number of confirmed cases of COVID-19
countrywide (more than 223,000 cases), with a death toll of almost 8,000 individuals.
Cook County alone, which includes the city of Chicago and accounts for the highest
2

portion of registered infections, reported more than 121,000 confirmed cases–i.e., about
2.3% of the total population–with more than 5,000 deaths–i.e., about 4.15% of lethality
rate (Illinois Institute of Public Health, 2020).
Chicago represents the study site for the present investigation. The diffusion of
COVID-19 through February and early March of 2020, forced Illinois Governor Pritzker
to first announce a disaster proclamation (i.e., a state of emergency) and subsequently
issue official restrictive interventions to contain the diffusion of the virus. The first
measures, such as school closures, were promulgated on March 13th, but it is with
the set of interventions on March 15th that the State government started a series of
escalating measures aimed at enforcing social distancing between citizens, such as the
closure of bars and restaurants and the cancellation of all gatherings involving 50 or
more people. On March 20th, the State government also issued a stay-at-home-order,
closing all non-essential businesses. The stay-at-home order, which originally had to
be in place until April 7th, was firstly extended for the entire State of Illinois until April
30th and, secondly, through May 29th.

Related Work
The global COVID-19 emergency has caused unprecedented changes to interpersonal
interactions and individual routine activities, and also to collective phenomena such as
economies and political agendas. Crime is within the wide set of social processes and
phenomena that COVID-19 has affected. In light of this, criminologists have started
to explore whether and how the virus—or, more correctly, the virus together with
the policies issued by governments—have changed the frequency of criminal activity. Works mainly analyzed trends across US cities, exploiting a variety of different
quantitative methodologies (Mohler et al., 2020; Campedelli et al., 2020; Ashby, 2020;
Leslie and Wilson, 2020; Piquero et al., ming). Statistical results were heterogeneous
across contexts, with certain crimes exhibiting declines to different extents, while other
remaining unvaried. Early works also studied the consequences of the policies in Australia (Payne et al., ming; Payne and Morgan, 2020a,b) and Europe, specifically in the
United Kingdom (Halford et al., 2020) and Sweden (Gerell et al., 2020).
While the research and policy importance of these studies is critical to address the
newly emerging issues caused by the pandemic, further efforts are required to understand the meso-level patterns behind changes in crime trends. Decades of research in
crime and delinquency have demonstrated that crime does not occur randomly across
space and time (Freeman et al., 1996; Johnson, 2010; Weisburd, 2015). Events are rather
clustered and follow specific patterns based on social, economic, demographic and ecological characteristics of the environment (Merton, 1938; Shaw and McKay, 1942; Gibbs
and Erickson, 1976; Blau and Blau, 1982; Sampson and Lauritsen, 1994; Papachristos
3

et al., 2011; Damm and Dustmann, 2014; Weisburd, 2015). The existence of such differences opens new lines of inquiry in the attempt to frame the impact that the COVID-19
pandemic has had on criminal phenomena. Accordingly, the current study attempts to
disentangle meso-level dynamics focusing on Chicago’s communities, seeking to test
whether changes in crime trends are consistent and similar across very different areas and, eventually, explore the main correlates associated with the actual presence of
statistically significant reduction in daily-based crime counts.

Theoretical Framework
In an attempt to contribute both to the knowledge on the consequences of COVID19 on crime and on the study of spatial and temporal patterns of crime in Chicago,
we frame our work within the theoretical premises of routine activity theory (Cohen
and Felson, 1979), crime pattern theory (Brantingham and Brantingham, 1984) and
general strain theory (Agnew, 1992), while motivating our analytical framework from
the perspective of the literature on crime concentration.
Routine Activity Theory and Crime Pattern Theory outline that interactions and
features of individual-level activities guide the spatio-temporal clustering of offending and victimization. Scholars have thus been interested in scrutinizing whether the
modifications in human daily habits generated by the spread of COVID-19 have resulted in consequent changes in criminal activity. While Routine Activity Theory and
Crime Pattern Theory point in the direction of a general crime reduction, especially
for thefts, robberies, burglaries, and homicides, General Strain Theory goes in a different direction. In a situation of limited freedom of movement, increased social isolation, financial distress, and uncertainty related to the aforementioned containment
policies and the risk of economic backlashes, individuals may be subjected to negative
stimuli (e.g., stress) that could lead them to experience a range of negative emotions
which, left unchecked, may lead to the commission of a crime. In light of this, while
interaction and movement reduction can affect crime in the short-term, the prolonged
stay-at-home order may trigger spikes in certain types of crimes in the medium- and
long-ranges.
Although the pandemic context represents an unprecedented scenario, we hypothesize that crime changes are not equally distributed across communities. The potential
differences that one could observe within a city–a complex system made up of several social, economic, environmental layers–are thus tightly related to the literature on
crime concentration (Shaw and McKay, 1942; Freeman et al., 1996; Johnson, 2010). For
this reason, while Routine Activity Theory, Crime Pattern Theory and General Strain
Theory are critical in picturing aggregate macro-dynamics, the literature on spatial
concentration of crime opens further lines of inquiry that are crucial for better under4

standing the meso-level trends occurring in Chicago.

The Present Work
Geographical and Criminal Focus
The present work focuses on the 77 communities of Chicago. The aim of the study is
twofold. First, analyze whether there exist community-level differences across crime
trends in the post-COVID-19 containment policies period. Second, investigate statistical associations between significant crime reductions and four sets of correlates. These
correlates map, respectively, (1) crime-related characteristics of each community, (2)
socio-economic conditions, (3) health-related and demographic information and, finally, (4) the presence of joint pairwise reductions across crimes.
The reasons for concentrating on crime reductions, rather than changes, are mainly
two. First, previous studies highlighted that, with few important exceptions–e.g., domestic violence (Piquero et al., ming)–crime reduction is the prevalent spillover on
crime of COVID-19 containment policies (Ashby, 2020; Campedelli et al., 2020; Mohler
et al., 2020; Payne et al., ming). The current study aims to better investigate this relevant dynamic. As second, the–likely–low numerosity of communities registering increases in crime counts, together with the relatively low number of units of analysis,
may cause increases to bias any estimate.
Chicago Community areas were created by the Social Science Research Committee
at the University of Chicago in the 1920s and almost never changed since their original
creation, except for O’Hare annexation to the city in 1956 and the separation of Edgewater from Upton in 1980. The division of Chicago in 77 communities mainly serves
to organize service delivery and propose planning strategies and policies within the
city. Each community area may comprise one or more neighborhoods. While other
geographical divisions exist, the clear distinction of the boundaries across communities and their stable presence in time facilitated the process for which most of Chicago
statistics are produced at the community-level.
Our analysis will focus on four crime types: burglaries, assaults, narcotics-related
offenses, and robberies. Three sets of reasons lie behind the choice of these four crime
categories. Firstly, these crimes (with the exception of narcotics) have been analyzed
by recent studies focusing on the impact of COVID-19 on crime. Our study would thus
provide further insights on crime typologies that have been investigated only at aggregate level. Second, these crime categories are distinct in nature, hence allowing us to
observe not only differences at spatio-temporal levels but also crime-wise. Burglaries,
for instance, are appropriative and are not mandatorily “physical”, per se. Contrarily,
assaults, robberies and most of narcotics-related offenses require interaction between
5

individuals. Furthermore, robberies and assaults are mostly characterized by a certain
degree of violence. Also, while burglaries and robberies map appropriative offenses,
assaults have a rather expressive nature and are generally motivated by different objectives or reasons. Finally, narcotics-related offenses are connected to the provision
of an illegal service, that can be regulated by complex criminal markets. At the same
time, narcotics are also associated with policing activities. Thanks to these characteristics, narcotics allow for analyzing additional dynamics that possibly emerge as
consequence of the anti-COVID-19 measures. Thirdly, these four crime categories account for a total of more than 122,000 reported crimes registered in the Chicago Crime
Database from January 1st 2018 to May 17th 2020,1 thus ensuring a sufficient number
of crimes to carry out reliable analyses.

Methods
This work relies on a two-step methodology. In the first part, we evaluate the impact
of social distancing in Chicago, specifically focusing on burglaries, assaults, narcoticsrelated crimes, robberies across all of the 77 urban communities that are part of the city
through the use of Bayesian Structural Time Series (Brodersen et al., 2015), partially
replicating the methodology presented in Campedelli et al. (2020). Within the context
of the Bayesian models, we focus on the distribution, direction, and significance of
the relative cumulative effect (RCE) of COVID-19 containment policies for each crime
in each community. The RCE captures the relative difference (rather than the crude
count) between the actual number of crimes that occurred in the post-intervention period (which goes from March 16th to May 17th) and the predicted number of crimes
that we would have expected in absence of any intervention, as computed by the simulation model. This first part of the methodology allows for understanding whether
changes in crime trends (either positive or negative) exist and what their distribution
across Chicago communities is. The models are coded in R (R Core Team, 2013) and
performed using the CausalImpact package (Brodersen et al., 2015).
In the second part, we shift the object of our analysis on the detected statistically
significant crime reductions. For this reason, we have created a variable–“Crime Reduction” (CR)-mapping the actual presence of a statistically significant crime reduction. CR is equal to 1 if the relative cumulative effect is lower than 0 and the associated
p-value is lower than 0.05 and takes 0 values otherwise:
CR =:
1

(
1 if [RCE < 0] ∧ [p − val(RCE) ≤ 0.05]
0

otherwise

The sum of the four crime categories accounts for more than 20% of all registered crimes in the

original dataset.

6

Once the variable has been calculated for each crime in each community, four sets
of regression models are performed to assess the correlates of observed crime trends
at the community level. Firth’s Logistic Regression (Firth, 1993) is employed as it is
the most adapt statistical strategy to deal with particularly small samples (77 observations, namely the Chicago communities), and unbalanced classes–i.e., in our setup,
an unequal number of communities in which crime trends significantly decreased
(Heinze and Schemper, 2002; Nemes et al., 2009). Firth’s regression aims at reducing
the bias that generally arises when using ordinary logistic regression with small and
well-separated samples and specifically uses penalized likelihood instead of maximum
likelihood estimation.
The choice to estimate separate regression models is motivated by the small size
of the sample. The limited number of observations does not make it possible to estimate models with a large number of covariates, and we have thus decided to perform
distinct theoretically-driven analyses to explore the effects of the selected predictors
within each dimension of interest (e.g., the effect of poverty within the socio-economic
dimension). Such approach, although forced by the structural nature of the sample,
comes with limitations. First, it raises the likelihood of omitting relevant information
and it raises the risk of obtaining spurious relationships. Second, it makes it unfeasile
to compare effect size across models. While we acknowledge that estimating separate
reduced models represents an inherent limitation of the study, we have tried to limit
the risk of obtaining biased results by theoretically motivating the inclusion of our
predictors and by being parsimonious to avoid overfitting. Furthermore, not only we
have used 2019 rates of burglaries, assaults, narcotics and robberies as main predictors
in the crime-related models: we have also included them as controls in the other three
dimensions. Including them as controls, we provide stronger evidence of the potential
relation between our dependent variables and the crime-unrelated covariates chosen
in the models. The regression models are performed in Stata (StataCorp, 2015) using
the FIRTHLOGIT (Coveney, 2015) package.

Data
Several data sources have been employed to conduct the analyses. First, the primary
dataset is gathered from the Chicago Data Portal and originally includes all the reported crime incidents (except for murders) that occurred in the city of Chicago from
January 1st 2001 to present. For the purposes of this article, a subset of crime types has
been temporally selected, namely all the burglaries, assaults, narcotics-related offenses,
and robberies that occurred from January 1st 2018 to May 17th 2020.2 The decision to

on overly short time-frames face the risk of missing the presence of already existing
trends originating in the medium- or long-range past. The extraction from the Chicago
Data Portal led to a total of 122,421 offenses (descriptive statistics by community are
reported in Table 1 and aggregated daily trends are displayed in Figure 1).3

In the second part of the analyses, the results obtained from the Bayesian models are
used to understand what factors are associated with a significant reduction in terms of
RCE, particularly analyzing CR as the target variable of interest. As anticipated, four
different categories of correlates are considered: a crime-related dimension, a socioeconomic dimension, a health-demographic dimension and a so-called joint reduction
dimension. Each of these dimensions is populated by several variables that are hypothesized to be linked to the presence (or absence) of a statistically significant crime
reduction in a given community. The considered variables, along with their sources,
are listed in Table 2.
Crime-related Context
The crime-related dimension includes data on burglary, assault, narcotics, and robbery
rates in each community in reference to 2019. The rationale behind the inclusion of
these variables lies in the need for understanding whether significant crime reductions
daily changes in crime trends. To avoid possible biases due to late reporting we collected the data on
June 06th 2020–three weeks after May 17th 2020 which is the last day included in our timeframe.

Since the dataset is based on data recorded by the Chicago Police Department’s Citizen Law
Enforcement Analysis and Reporting (CLEAR) System, the coding of each crime follows the Illinois
Uniform Crime Reporting codes: each of the four mentioned crimes thus include a list of specific
offenses. Burglary specifically IUCR codes 0610, 0650, 0620, 0630; assault includes 0560, 0520, 0558,
051A, 0530, 0554, 0545, 0555, 0550, 0553, 0557, 051B, 0552, 0551, 0556. Narcotics specifically includes
2022, 2027, 2093, 2024, 2028, 1811, 1812, 1821, 2014, 2034, 1822, 2092, 2017, 2026, 2013, 2021, 2023,

are driven by crime rates in the past. From a theoretical point of view, it is relevant
to understand whether the most evident positive effects (i.e., crime reductions) are observed regardless of the pre-lockdown levels of criminal activity or if, contrarily, there
exist patterns highlighting greater benefits experienced by areas generally known for
their high crime presence. Furthermore, a measure mapping neighborhood safety is
considered to investigate how individual self-perception is reflected in the criminal
changes that occurred during the lockdown. Neighborhood Safety is in fact a measure
gathered from the Healthy Chicago Survey (provided by the Chicago Department of
Public Health), which estimates the rate of adults aged 18 years and older who report to
feel safe all of the time and most of the time in a given community. The rate is weighted
to reproduce the population from which the sample is drawn. In line with our reasoning regarding crime rates, we are interesting in verifying whether communities that
are perceived as less safe have benefited more from the COVID-19 containment policies. Finally, the dimension also controls for the presence of a police station within the
community, as to contribute to the existing debate on the effects of police presence on

crime trends (Wilson and Boland, 1978; Di Tella and Schargrodsky, 2004; Ratcliffe and
Breen, 2011).
Socio-Economic Conditions
Concerning the socio-economic dimension, five correlates are analyzed. First, the relationship between crime reduction and the number of inhabitants is investigated. The
criminological and economic literature has widely investigated the variability in crime
between urban and non-urban/rural contexts, and one of the characterizing elements
of urban contexts is the higher number (and density) of inhabitants. Urbanization is
positively associated to criminal activity (Flango and Sherbenou, 1976; Larson and Garrett, 1996; Glaeser and Sacerdote, 1999), but within the context of a pandemic-driven
lockdown, the criminal opportunities related to the dynamic aspects of urban life (such
as transient crowding, see Jarrell and Howsen (1990)) may be consistently reduced,
thus thinning the role of urbanization–and population–in driving criminal activity.
Furthermore, in line with routine activity theory (Cohen and Felson, 1979), highly populated areas may have developed a higher level of formal and informal guardianship
and control, thus further minimizing criminal opportunities.
Secondly and thirdly, income diversity and poverty are considered. Income inequality and poverty at the community level may be associated with the experience
10

of status and monetary strain, which, in turn may contribute to generate anger and
frustration (Agnew, 1999). Research has gone beyond the borders of relative and absolute deprivation to investigate the interplay between the two concepts, finding mixed
results that generally vary across units of analyses (e.g., countries, regions, cities, communities) and crime types (Patterson, 1991; Hooghe et al., 2011; Pare and Felson, 2014;
Burraston et al., 2018). In light of the complex relationship between income inequality
and poverty, this study will test whether we can identify associations between the two
and the significant reduction of crimes in Chicago communities.
A fourth factor regards the crowded housing rate. The forced condition of shelterin-place calls for careful consideration of crowded housing rate as a potential additional risk factor for crime. A situation of forced cohabitation in poor social conditions
where positively valued goals become difficult to achieve, and positive stimuli are inhibited while negative ones, such as stress and impoverishment, are introduced, fit
well within the frame expressed by general strain theory (Agnew, 1992). Finally, the
vacant housing rate is also included in the models. Previous research has noted the
role of abandoned buildings and places as attractors for crime (Vigil, 1988; Spelman,
1993): in the context of forced reduced human mobility and freedom to move, vacant
houses and abandoned buildings may even acquire greater importance for criminal
activity within a community.
Health-related and Demographic Conditions
Social scientists have long debated about the influence of age structure on crime, both
in terms of temporal and geographical distributions (Cohen and Land, 1987; Phillips,
2006; Arnio and Baumer, 2012). Therefore, variables controlling for the percentage of
people aged more than 65 years old and for the percentage of juveniles (people aged
less than 18 years) are considered. Potential dynamics may arise in neighborhoods
marked by higher levels of the elderly. With everyone forced in their residences and
an overall increase in enforced guardianship, offenders may for instance target houses
inhabited by seniors, hypothesizing a weaker type of guardianship and resistance.
A third variable refers to the overall health status of the community. The variable maps the estimated rate of adults (aged 18 and older) who reported their overall
health status as being good, very good or excellent community-wise and the measure
is weighted to reflect the structure of the population from which the sample is drawn.
Scientists in different disciplines have been interested in measuring how health status
and fear of crime interact together (Bazargan, 1994; McKee and Milner, 2000; Chandola,
2001). Although actual and perceived crime-levels often differ (Weatherburn et al.,
1996; Pfeiffer et al., 2005; Hipp, 2010), it is relevant to understand whether communities that, on average, perceived better status levels before the pandemic have been
11

associated with a significant reduction of crimes.
Finally, a variable expressing the rate of COVID-19 infected individuals living in
the community serves the purpose of investigating whether areas with higher levels
of contagion are also associated with higher (and significant) crime reduction patterns.
A higher prevalence of cases may lead to higher levels of fear within the community.
Fear of COVID-19, as empirically demonstrated (Harper et al., 2020), has a positive
role in strengthening compliant behaviors, including social distancing and personal
hygiene, and may consequently indirectly reduce crime, by impacting daily actions of
both non-offenders and offenders.

Other Crimes Evolution
Finally, the fourth dimension tests whether a significant reduction in one crime is positively associated with a reduction in another one. Research on crime containment
policies has demonstrated that, besides direct effects of interventions on criminal activity, a number of indirect consequences can possibly emerge, including displacement
mechanics of various types (Reppetto, 1976; Guerette and Bowers, 2009; Ratcliffe and
Breen, 2011). Specifically, it might happen that reductions in one crime type in a certain
area is followed by increases of other crimes in the same environment. Within the exceptional context of the lockdown, we may expect different crimes to follow common
trends, due to a diffused reduction in criminal opportunities. Alternatively, we might
observe a shift toward more expressive crimes induced by the simultaneous reduction
of opportunities and increase in strain.

Results
Community-level crime-wise Bayesian models
Overall, the first part of the analysis highlights that the effects of the COVID-19 containment policies are distinct in terms of geographic distribution, effect magnitude,
significance, and prevalence across Chicago communities. The following maps show,
for each crime, the presence of a significant change in the daily trend (top subfigures),
along with the magnitude of the cumulative RCE (bottom subfigures).

We preferred to use the rate of infected persons instead of the rate of dead persons, because the

COVID-19 related deaths were often misidentified by the health care systems. Hospitals and local governments did not always test the people who died with COVID-19 symptoms, so we decided to use
established number of infections in our analysis. Data on daily cases, deaths and hospitalizations are
available here (information on addresses are included): https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-HumanServices/COVID-19-Cases-Tests-and-Deaths-by-ZIP-Code/yhhz-zm2v/data.

Figure 2 refers to the community-wide analysis of burglaries. It is straightforward to notice that the vast majority of communities did not experience any significant change (i.e., red-colored communities). The bottom pictures the distribution of
the RCE magnitude per each community (lighter colors are associated with stronger
negative RCE values–i.e., crime reduction–while darker are linked to higher positive
RCE-i.e., crime increase). The bottom map indicates that there is a relevant share of
communities (n=12) that experienced an increase, even up to CRE=2.19 (i.e., an increase of 219% compared to the forecasted cumulative number of crimes as estimated
by the counterfactual scenario with no issued interventions produced by the Bayesian
model), although only 2 of these increases were found to be significant. The two communities that experienced a significant increase in crime are Douglas and Hyde Park,
situated in the South Side district. Among the socio-structural factors that cause opposite trends in burglaries, different distributions of residential and non-residential
buildings may play a role, as COVID-19 containment policies may impact residential
and non-residential burglaries to different extents (Ashby, 2020).

Far Southeast Side districts. Only 2 out of 77 communities witnessed an increase, but

Figures 6 through 9 show the distribution of RCE for each crime, showing that significant and non-significant values distribute differently. The different distributions
allow for drawing some further observations on patterns of RCE. First, significant RCE
for burglaries (Figure 6) are clustered in the extreme-left and extreme-right of the histogram, suggesting a correlation between the magnitude and the significance of the
effect. Extreme values in assaults are not always significant (Figure 7, although also
significant changes in assaults tend to cluster around high and low values. The same
is true for robberies (Figure 9), and especially for narcotics (Figure 8). Robbery and
narcotics are also the crime types for which no significant increase is detected; their
increases are not statistically significant.

Investigating correlates in crime reduction
Modeling results for each dimension are reported in the following tables. As anticipated in the Methods subsection, for each model, the dependent variable (CR) maps
the presence of a significant reduction in the RCE for the given crime type. In light
of this, variables displaying positive (and significant) odds ratios are positively associated with the presence of such reduction.
For each crime, Table 3 shows the effects of the crime-related correlates described
above. The presence of a significant reduction in burglaries is not predicted by any of
the included correlates; not even the rate of burglaries that occurred in 2019 is associated with a decrease in the post-intervention period. Conversely, effects are found for

other crimes. The rate of assaults computed for 2019 is positively associated with a statistically significant reduction of assaults in the post-intervention period (OR=1.008,
p<0.1). The same pattern is found for robberies: the higher the rate of robberies in
2019, the higher the likelihood of a significant reduction after the introduction of the
17

containment policies (OR=1.020, p<0.1).
Although the two effect sizes seem negligible in absolute terms, they are instead
relevant considering the variation of assaults and burglaries across Chicago communities. The rate of assaults in 2019 has a mean value of 87.84, with a range going from
a minimum of 14.01 to a maximum of 297.37 (St. Dev.= 69.19). The burglary rate also
indicates high variability: the average is 38.18, going from a minimum of 5.96 to a
maximum of 110.45 (St. Dev.= 23.84).
Reductions in narcotics-related offenses are successfully predicted by perceived
neighborhood safety only (OR=0.928, p<0.01). Specifically, the relationship indicates
that the higher the perceived safety in a neighborhood the lower the odds of reduction
in narcotics-related offenses. This finding might be related to policing dynamics: police
may decide to target communities that are generally less safe, hence reducing the possibility to positively influence narcotics activity in safer areas. Conversely, safer neighborhoods have higher odds to experience reductions in assaults (OR=1.040, p<0.1).
This finding may be explained by the fact that social distancing and shelter-in-place
policies further reduce the opportunity for assaults in already safe communities by
sensibly reducing the number of potential victims in the streets. Lastly, the presence
of a police station within a community does not have any significant impact on crime
reductions.5 While the magnitude of the OR is mostly positive (and high), except for
burglaries, the statistical relationship is not strong enough to make any inference about
the deterrence role of police stations in the post-intervention timeframe.
Table 4 focuses on the socio-economic variables. Two relations are found concerning the significant reduction of burglaries. First, more populated communities are
more prone to experience significant reductions. The positive relation between significant crime reduction and population is found for all the considered crimes (burglary
OR=1.039, assault OR=1.039, narcotics OR=1.032, robbery OR=1.056). In fact, the computation of the average marginal effect shows that burglaries are expected to reduce by
3.8% (OR=1.039) when the population of the average community increases by 1 unit
(an increase of 1,000 inhabitants), and other factors are held constant at their mean.
Still, the actual effects can be relevant given that communities in Chicago are heterogeneous in terms of population (the minimum is 2,254 and the maximum is 100,470
with a standard deviation of 22,916.61). We interpret the overall effect of population
in the frame of Routine Activity Theory: more inhabitants forced at home enhance
guardianship, reducing crime opportunities (Cohen and Felson, 1979).
5

Since data on police stations were gathered with their associated ZIP codes, and since a ZIP code

may belong to more than one community in the city of Chicago, a community was labeled as “has
police” if there was at least one police station present in a census associated to the community. If, for
instance, community A and B share ZIP code y, and ZIP code y has a police station, both A and B are
labeled as “has police” communities.

Contrarily, higher levels of poverty are negatively associated with the dependent
variable, in line with previous research on the effect of low economic conditions and
crime (Pare and Felson, 2014). If the rate of inhabitants living in poverty in an average
community (mean 21.97) increases by a 1 percentage point, the predicted probability
of a significant reduction in burglaries decreases by 12.4% (OR=0.833, p<0.05), as per
computation of the Average Marginal Effect.
As we are focusing on crime reductions, our initial hypothesis was the odds of
detecting crime reduction to decrease with each incremental rise in house crowding.
Yet, contrary to the theoretical premises of General Strain Theory, crowded housing is
not associated with any of the variables under consideration, not even with assaults.
The odds of significant narcotics reductions increase by a factor of 1.318 times for
each additional increment of vacant housing units, contrary to what we might have
19

expected based on the literature (Spelman, 1993). This suggests that the stay at home
order and social distancing policy recommendations may have discouraged people
from moving around the city to commit crimes in communities with a high prevalence
of unguarded buildings.
Income diversity shows divergent effects. On one hand, a positive relation between
income diversity and significant crime reductions is detected for narcotics (OR=1.270,
p<0.05) and assaults (OR=1.446, p<0.05). On the other hand, a unit increase in income diversity reduces the odds of witnessing significant reductions in burglaries
(OR=0.810, p<0.1) and robberies (OR=0.744, p<0.05). This might indicate that economically heterogeneous structures of communities create the conditions for palatable
robbery and burglary targets also in a condition of highly disrupted human mobility.
An underlying factor associated with this pattern can be relative deprivation, which is
connected in turn to resentment and frustration (Agnew, 1999; Wilkinson, 2004).

Concerning demographic and health-associated variables, heterogeneous associations emerge. First of all, the presence of elderly inhabitants is found to be significantly
and negatively associated only in terms of a significant reduction in burglary (Table 5).
Specifically, a unit increase in the rate of residents aged 65 or more leads to a 21.9%
reduction in the likelihood of having a significant reduction in burglaries. This is in
line with the hypothesis that burglars may target areas with a high share of elderly
individuals assuming lower levels of capable guardianship or physical resistance. In
line with this finding, also a reduction in robberies is negatively associated with the
presence of seniors in a given community (OR=0.782, p<0.05). This further suggests
that offenders may have decided to specifically target strata of the population with
weaker resistance capabilities.
Assaults display instead a statistically significant negative relationship with the
prevalence of juveniles in the community. The odds ratio of 0.863 means that, following the computation of the average marginal effect, an increase of 1 percentage point
in the rate of inhabitants aged less than 18 years in the average community (mean 22.5)
leads to a 14.9% reduction in the probability of a significant reduction of assaults. This
finding can be linked to both the literature about the effect of age structure on aggregate levels of crime and research in the context of life-course criminology (Cohen and
Land, 1987; Shavit and Rattner, 1988; Sweeten et al., 2013), but also to the fact that
youth may be less prone to comply with the containment interventions (Moore et al.,
2020; Gowen et al., 2020).
The prevalence of COVID-19 cases in a community does not affect the presence of
a significant crime reduction on three crime categories out of four, the ones in which
there is a victim. The only exception is narcotics; a unitary increase in the log-transformed
rate of cases is negatively associated with a decline in drug-related crimes (OR=0.477,
p<0.1). This relation may be driven by lower compliance with formal norms that
simultaneously applies to both drug consumption and violation of social distancing
measures (Jacka et al., 2020; Dumas et al., 2020) which, in turn, manifests in a higher
prevalence of COVID-19 cases and a lower reduction in narcotics.
The overall health status variable, which measures the “share of the population of
adults aged 18 years and older who reported that their overall health is good, very
good or excellent” is significantly and negatively associated only with a reduction in
narcotics. Specifically, a unit increase in this share leads to an 8.1% reduction in the
likelihood of witnessing a statistically significant reduction of drug-related offenses.
Contrarily, the relationship is the opposite in terms of robberies: the higher the perceived health status, the higher the likelihood of a significant reduction in the postintervention period (OR=1.178, p<0.05).
The joint reduction models show that there are two pairwise relationships, but we
do not observe offense displacement; the correlation between crime reductions are pos21

itive (Table 6). A significant reduction in robberies is associated with higher odds of
a reduction in burglaries in the same community (OR=5.801, p<0.05). In parallel, the
odds of a significant reduction in robberies, in a community where burglaries reduced
as well, are 6.373 (p<0.05). This suggests that the two crimes are jointly influenced by
common underlying opportunity structures that exist in the communities. Similarly, a
significant reduction in assaults is associated with a significant reduction in narcotics
(OR=2.984, p<0.10), and a significant reduction in narcotics is associated with a joint
significant reduction in assaults (OR=3.024, p<0.10). Also, in this case, this means that
regardless of the single determinants/risk factors previously assessed–which are often
different for the different crime types–there are other dynamics, which associate these
two pairs of crime types.

22

Discussion
In line with the literature on crime concentration, we found that the issued COVID-19
containment policies have impacted crime in different ways across communities. In
terms of burglaries, only 10 communities (12.98% of the total) experienced a statistically significant reduction during our post-intervention follow-up period. Concerning assaults, 18 communities (23.37%) experienced a significant reduction. Narcoticsrelated offenses are those that significantly declined in more areas compared to the
other crimes, with 35 communities associated with a statistical reduction (45.54%). Finally, robberies have been significantly reduced in only 10 communities (12.98%).
We also detected cases in which crimes have significantly increased. Significantly
more burglaries than expected occurred in 2 communities (with increases of 219% and
168%, respectively) and 1 community experienced a statistically significant increase
of assaults (+115%). As the overall number of assaults has contracted after the introduction of containment policies, the increase registered at Forest Glen may relate to
a spatial displacement dynamic. The forms of displacement related to the increase
in burglaries might, instead, be two; in addition to spatial displacement also offense
displacement–i.e., from residential burglaries to non-residential burglaries–might have
happened. Displacement relates to dissimilar changes in the crime environment. While
differences in criminal opportunities related to residential and non-residential burglaries maybe reconducted to a higher–or lower–guardianship during the stay-at-home
period, other modifications in the criminal environment would need to be addressed
with ad-hoc empirical strategies. More in general, evidence pointing in the direction
of increases in crime–although circumscribed to few communities and few crimes–
suggests further researches aiming at explaining them should be conducted.
For what concerns the inferential models investigating correlates of statistically significant reductions, mixed findings emerged. The 2019 level of assaults was positively
associated with the statistical reduction of the same reference crime category. The same
applies to robberies. This suggests that communities that had previously high levels
of such offenses benefited more from the COVID-19 containment policies, compared
to other communities. Concerning perceived neighborhood safety, two opposite relationships were found. Higher perceived safety in a community predicts significant
reductions in assaults, while a contrary link was found for narcotics, possibly due to
policing dynamics. Finally, the presence of a police station located in the ZIP codes
that are part of a community did not lead to any significant association with crime
reduction.
From the socio-economic point of view, the rate of people living in crowded houses
was not found to be negatively associated with statistical reductions in assaults, contrary to the theoretical premises of GST (Freedman, 1975; Booth et al., 1976; Agnew,
23

1992). Also surprisingly, vacant housing rate was positively associated with significant reductions in narcotics. Income diversity was positively associated with reductions in narcotics-related offenses and assaults but negatively associated with a decline
in burglaries and assaults. This latter result may be linked to the role of relative deprivation in shaping criminal activity within economically heterogeneous communities
(Blau and Blau, 1982). In parallel, poverty is negatively associated with reductions
in burglaries suggesting that absolute deprivation, in general, has a negative impact–
especially in such an exceptional condition–on appropriative crimes. The number of
inhabitants is the only variable positively associated with all the considered crime
types, indicating that the higher the number of people at home, the higher the levels of
capable guardianship, the lower the opportunities for crime.
Indications also emerged from the analysis of health-related and demographic variables. First, the higher the share of people aged more than 65 years old, the lower
the odds of observing a statistically significant reduction of burglaries. This can be
related to the fact that burglars prefer to target people that pose weaker resistance
and guardianship to their residencies and that retired people tend to spend more time
at home than younger ones; therefore, containment policies might introduce smaller
changes in the communities where older people are more numerous. Furthermore, the
higher the number of people aged less than 18, the higher the levels of assaults, in line
with perspectives on life-course criminology and with the hypothesis that youth are
less prone to comply with rules and restrictions.
The prevalence of COVID-19 infections in a community did not lead to any effect on
crime. Self-perceived health status was associated with reductions in robberies, while
the relationship was inverse for narcotics. A possible explanation of this dynamic lies
in the fact that a higher perception of health status might be related to higher compliance with mobility restriction orders (Barari et al., 2020) . In turn, the higher level of
compliance induces a reduction in robberies. Conversely, drug consumption may associate with lower self-perceived health, possibly via worse health status (Neale, 2004;
Millson et al., 2004).
Finally, we have found evidence of two pairwise relations between joint reduction
in two crime types of appropriative nature: observing a reduction in burglaries was
strongly associated with the odds of observing also a reduction in robberies, and viceversa. Additionally, observing a reduction in narcotics in a community is associated
with very high odds of observing a reduction also in assaults and vice versa.

Conclusions
This work analyzed the community-level trends in burglaries, assaults, narcotics-related
offenses and robberies to understand whether and how COVID-19 containment policies have impacted differently across different areas of the same city, and what are
the main contextual correlates associated to crime reductions. We framed our work in
the context of Routine Activity Theory (Cohen and Felson, 1979), Crime Pattern Theory (Brantingham and Brantingham, 1984) and General Strain Theory (Agnew, 1992,
1999), but the community-level focus of the analyses are motivated by the literature on
crime concentration which indicates that crime does not occur randomly in time and
space (Shaw and McKay, 1942; Freeman et al., 1996; Johnson, 2010; Weisburd, 2015).
It rather clusters in certain areas of a city. Concerning our crimes of interest, Routine
Activity Theory and Crime Pattern Theory both point in the direction of diffused decrease in crime events due to the massive reduction in opportunities (a joint effect of
increased capable guardianship and very low human mobility). On the other hand,
General Strain Theory suggests that the presence of negative stimuli–such as the stress
associated to isolation and financial and economic uncertainty–and the impossibility
to reach positively valued goals due to the stay-at-home policies may lead to crime
by increasing negative emotions responses, thus predicting potential spikes in certain
types of offenses. As these propositions govern the overall dynamics concerning crime,
we posited that such theories can explain the extent to which criminal activity varies
across Chicago communities due to their different criminal, social, economic, health,
and demographic contexts. Indeed, certain areas of the city experienced crime reduction, while others did not. These reductions are crime-sensitive and depend on the
different contextual characteristics of the communities.
Although providing new insights on the relation between the COVID-19 pandemic
and crime, our work comes with some limitations. First, there is a well-known gap
between actual and reported crimes. It is thus important to be careful when interpreting inferential results that are solely based on reported events. In addition, crimes can
also be reported later compared to the day when they were actually committed. To
partially mitigate possible biases coming from short-term late reporting we collected
the data on June 06th 2020–three weeks after May 17th 2020 which is the last day of
our time frame. Nonetheless, this does not help to solve problems related to longterm late reporting. Further, the literature on crime and place has consistently shown
that crime is patterned at micro-levels. This means that going more in detail at the
geographical level may reveal further mechanics and patterns that our analyses fail to
detect and consider. Community-wide analyses already disentangle diverging dynamics, but Chicago’s communities are highly complex, multifaceted, and diverse, and it
is thus likely that more micro approaches would be useful in highlighting further dy25

namics. Thirdly, we only considered a small set of crimes and some aggregate crime
categories (i.e, burglary does not distinguish between residential and non-residential
crimes). Given the heterogeneity of the results we provided, we expect many more
layers of complexity intervening in all the other offenses that we have not considered.
Future work should address this gap.
Despite these limitations, the many outcomes of our work first demonstrate that
crime trends do not behave in the same way across different areas of the same city and
across different types of crimes in the context of the pandemic. Additionally, we show
that there are different factors connected to community-level reductions in crimes. This
finding prompts new research questions and provides relevant insights also from a
policy standpoint. The inhomogeneous distribution and magnitude of effects and the
statistical associations found with variables mapping the context of each Chicago community can help inform public policies and police practices aimed at preventing and
tackling crime in this exceptional situation. This will be extremely important moving forward especially as restrictions are eased and then again if—and when—another
wave of the virus breaks out and policies are re-introduced.
