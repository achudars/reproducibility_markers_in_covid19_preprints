The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a dramatic surge in demand for personal protective equipment (PPE) worldwide. Many countries have imposed export restrictions on PPE to ensure the
sufficient domestic supply. The surging demand and export restrictions cause shortage contagions
on the global PPE trade network. Here, we develop an integrated network model, which integrates
a metapopulation model and a threshold model, to investigate the shortage contagion patterns. The
metapopulation model captures disease contagion across countries. The threshold model captures
the shortage contagion on the global PPE trade network. Results show that, the shortage contagion patterns are mainly decided by top exporters. Export restrictions exacerbate the shortages of
PPE and cause the shortage contagion to transmit even faster than the disease contagion. Besides,
export restrictions lead to ineffective and inefficient allocation of PPE around the world, which has
no benefits for the world to fight against the pandemic.

The COVID-19 pandemic is spreading rapidly around
the world. As of Jan 24, 2021, it has infected more than
96 million people and claimed more than 2 million lives
worldwide [1, 2]. Many countries have adopted a series of
public health measures to contain the epidemic, such as
the closure of commercial activities, bans on travel, and
export restrictions [3–5]. Personal protective equipment
(PPE), such as face and eye protection devices, protective garments, and gloves, is the most heavily affected
category of commodities in export restrictions. Over 73
governments have imposed export restrictions on PPE
exports [6, 7]. Since the COVID-19 pandemic has caused
a growing demand for PPE worldwide [8–10], countries
impose export restrictions to prepare for the potential
domestic demand.
Recently, several empirical studies have discussed the
pros and cons of export restrictions on medical supplies,
foods, drugs, etc., in the time of COVID-19. They concluded that export restrictions might cause uncertainty in
supply and other negative security consequences, though
these restrictions seem logical and justifiable [5, 7, 11].
Demand surges and export restrictions cause shortage
contagion on the trade network. There is rich economic
literature using quantitative models to investigate the
contagion patterns and their impacts on international
trade [12–16]. In physics, a wide range of research proposed different models to analyze the dynamics of contagion propagation on interdependent networks [17], for example, the diffusion model [18] and the threshold model
[19, 20]. However, how the shortage contagion transmits on the global PPE trade network during large-scale

epidemic like the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is underresearched. Most, if not all, existing studies examined
the disease contagion and shortage contagion separately,
and did not take into consideration the dynamic interplay between them. It is critical to characterize such
interplay because the surging demand is caused by the
epidemic arrival.
In this paper, we develop a novel integrated network
model to examine the impacts of export restrictions on
the global PPE trade network during the COVID-19 pandemic. We illustrate the structure of the model in Fig. 1.
The proposed model integrates a susceptible-infectedrecovered (SIR) based metapopulation model, which captures the dynamics of disease contagion on the global
mobility network (top layer of Fig. 1), and a threshold
model, which captures the dynamics of shortage contagion on the global PPE trade network (bottom layer of
Fig. 1). We investigate the shortage propagation patterns of eight sections of PPE commodities for five scenarios on export restrictions. We provide quantitative
evidence that export restrictions cause shortage contagion to transmit even faster than that of the disease contagion. Besides, export restrictions delay the occurrence
of shortages for self-sufficient countries, but accelerate
the occurrence of shortages for not-self-sufficient countries. In addition, export restrictions lead to ineffective
and inefficient allocation of PPE worldwide.
To capture the interplay between the disease contagion
and the demand for PPE, we adapt a threshold model
[14, 19] by (a) representing the increase of domestic demand for PPE as a result of the epidemic arrival, and (b)

FIG. 1. Overview of the integrated network model. The top
(disease contagion) and bottom (shortage contagion) layers
are the global mobility network where the epidemic spreads,
and the global PPE trade network where the shortage contagion transmits, respectively. Nodes represent countries.
Edges on the top layer represent the aggregated number of
seats on scheduled commercial flights between countries per
day. Edges on the bottom layer represent the daily trade
value between countries (in US dollars). Countries’ domestic
demand for PPE will increase since they are infected.

adding an inventory module as the buffering mechanism.
We construct the global PPE trade network using data
from the United Nations Comtrade Database (UNCD)
[21]. Here nodes represent countries and edges represent
the annual trade value between countries (in US dollars).
We select commodities with the World Customs Organization’s Harmonized System codes for COVID-19 medical supplies [22]. All commodities are classified into eight
sections.
Following Brockmann and Helbing [23], the SIR based
metapopulation model is constructed based on the global
mobility network, which is defined by the daily air traffic data [24]. Here, nodes represent countries and edges
represent the aggregated number of seats on scheduled
commercial flights between countries. The population
data used for constructing the global mobility network
is obtained from the United Nations World Population
Prospects national estimates [25]. After excluding the
countries that do not appear in these datasets, the proposed model has 195 countries.
The model works on a daily time step. At time t,
(s)
each country i distributes its imports impi (t), produc(s)
(s)
tion proi (t), and inventory invi (t) of commodities in
(s)
section s to meet the domestic demand demi,dom (t) and
(s)

foreign demand demi,f or (t). We assume that domestic
demand has higher priority than foreign demand. The
maximum amount of commodities in section s that country i can distribute at time t is

(s)

Di,max (t) = impi (t) + proi (t) + invi (t).

Here, α, β, γ, and ǫ are the infection rate, recovery rate,
average mobility rate, and local invasion parameter, respectively. σ(x) = xη /(xη + 1) is the sigmoid function
with parameter η. Denote Fji as the number of passengers traveling
from country i to country j per day,
P
and Fi = j Fji . Then Pji = Fji /Fi is the fraction of
individuals
traveling from country i to country j, and
P
j Pji = 1. We obtain Fji by averaging the daily traffic
data on the global mobility network.
Assuming that, before the pandemic, the domestic de(s)
mand for commodities in section s is µi per capita per
day for country i, thus, the total domestic demand for
commodities in section s for country i before the pan(s)
(s)
demic is Demi = µi Ni per day. We adopt the common assumption that the domestic demand for PPE increases with the number of confirmed cases, and then
reaches a plateau. To capture this relationship, we
modify the relationship function in [26] and represent
(s)
demi,dom (t) as

demi,dom (t) =Demi [1 + θd,i (t)]

Here, θd,i (t) is the demand increase factor for country i
at time t, which is represented as follows.

where θp,i (t) is the production increase factor for country i at time t. We assume that θp,i (t) is non-negative
for the following reasons. During the pandemic, PPE
production may decline due to the lockdown of cities,
infection of workers, etc. But in the meanwhile, governments have provided supports for PPE production and
manufacturers worldwide have retooled to produce more
PPE to combat the pandemic. Therefore, we assume the
production after the pandemic is no less than that before
the pandemic.
Assuming that countries cannot anticipate economic
shocks, they issue orders to other countries at the end of

This assumption means that country i can still meet the
domestic demand and foreign demand without imports

for φi days before the pandemic.
In the simulations, we consider the simplest pandemic
scenario, where no travel bans or other public health measures are considered. For simplicity, we assume k1 = 2,
k2 = 100, and µsi = 10 for all countries and all commodities. Following epidemiology literature, the mean
infectious period is set as 4.6 days [27] leading to the
recovery rate β = 0.217. The basic reproduction number R0 is set as 2.6 [28], leading to the infection rate
α = R0 β = 0.5642. From the OAG data, the average
mobility rate γ is estimated to be 0.00014 per day. We
adopt the choices for ǫ and η in [23], ǫ = 10−8 and η = 8.
We set that China is initially infected with 100 infected
cases at t = 0, which corresponds to December 31, 2019,
the date when the World Health Organization was informed of unknown pneumonia cases detected in Wuhan,
China [29]. We run the simulation for one year.
Now, we model five different export restriction scenarios among countries, and present their impacts on the

First, we give an overview of the trade network for
section 1 and section 2. In Fig. 2, we present the daily
exports and the cumulative percentage of daily global exports in section 1 and section 2 for the top five exporters
and other countries. We observe a Pareto distribution
in global exports in Fig. 2, where the top five exporters
share about 70% and 52% of global exports in section 1
and section 2, respectively.
In Fig. 3, we plot the number of infected countries
and the number of countries facing shortages at the end
of each month in different scenarios. Country i will
face shortages of commodities in section s at time t if
(s)
its domestic demand cannot be met, i.e., Di,max (t) <

demi,dom (t). As illustrated in Fig. 3, if the production
stays unchanged for all countries (i.e., θp,i (t) = 0), nearly
all countries will face shortages at the end of 2020 in

trade network for each commodity section. The description of each scenario is given in Table I. For the rest of
this paper, we only present the numerical results for commodities in section 1 (COVID-19 test kits and apparatus
used in diagnostic testing) and section 2 (protective garments and the like), because they represent two typical
situations: (a) the initially infected country (China) is
not the largest exporter (Germany) in section 1, and (b)
the initially infected country (China) is also the largest
exporter in section 2. Results for other sections are consistent with the results for these two sections, and thus
are presented in the Supplemental Material.

all scenarios. Generally, export restrictions exacerbate
global supply shortages. We can observe that, compared with scenario Sall where all countries restrict exports, the number of countries facing shortages decreases
greatly in the early periods (from January to June) in
scenario Snone where no country restricts exports. Besides, the number of countries facing shortages in scenario
S5% (only the top 5% of exporters restrict exports) is
nearly the same as scenario Sall , which can be explained
by the Pareto distribution in global exports. Counterintuitively, the number of countries facing shortages in
scenario Slower (the lower half of the exporters restrict
exports) is slightly fewer than that in scenario Snone .
The reason is as follows. The total percentages of world
exports that the lower half of the exporters share are
only 0.005% and 0.053% for section 1 and section 2, respectively. They can hardly help other countries manage supply shortages. Besides, exports lower the inventory level of these countries, thus, in scenario Slower , restricting exports can delay the shortages when disease
arrives at these countries. These findings show that, on
the one hand, agreements are urgently needed to ensure
open trade between countries during the pandemic; on
the other hand, such agreements should also allow countries that contribute little to global exports to impose
some export restrictions in order to ensure a sufficient
inventory for the upcoming pandemic.
For section 1, we find that scenario S1 leads to many
more countries facing shortages as compared to scenario
Snone , because Germany (the largest exporter) stops supplying commodities to others. This gap shrinks for section 2, because the largest exporter (China) is the initially infected country as well. So even without export restrictions (such as scenario Snone ), China has to meet the
domestic demand by lowering the exports significantly.

Next, we compare the epidemic arrival time Ta and the
first shortage time Ts for each country in different scenarios. We present the results for scenarios Snone and Sall
in Fig. 4. Note that countries not facing shortages within
the simulation periods are not represented in Fig. 4. The
epidemic arrival time Ta is defined as the date of the first
infected case after the initial outbreak. The first shortage time Ts is defined as the date when a country first
faces PPE shortages. Nodes represent countries. The
size of a node represents the export value of commodities in the corresponding section. The color of a node
indicates if it is a self-sufficient country for the section.
Country i is self-sufficient for commodities in section s
when its production is no less than its domestic demand

(s)
before the pandemic, i.e., P roi >= Demi . The blue
line corresponds to Ta = Ts . If a country faces shortages
before infected, it locates below the blue line. Otherwise,
it locates above the blue line.
As illustrated in Fig. 4 (a) and Fig. 4 (b), we can observe in section 1 that, compared with scenario Sall , more
not-self-sufficient countries locate above the blue line in
scenario Snone . The fraction of not-self-sufficient countries above the blue line increases to 65% in scenario

Snone from 1% in scenario Sall . In section 2, we also
observe that export restrictions lead to a much earlier
occurrence of shortages for not-self-sufficient countries in
Fig. 4 (c) and Fig. 4 (d). The mean value of Ts decreases
to 22 days in scenario Sall from 105 days in scenario
Snone . In Fig. 5, we also present the fraction of countries
with Ts > Ta in section 1 and the mean value of Ts in
section 2 for not-self-sufficient countries in all scenarios.
The differences in scenarios are consistent with that in
Fig. 3. To sum up, when all countries restrict exports, almost all not-self-sufficient countries locate below the blue
line, which can be observed in both section 1 and section
2, indicating that they encounter PPE shortages even
before the epidemic arrival. Besides, both self-sufficient
countries and not-self-sufficient countries locate farther
away from each other in scenario Sall than in scenario
Snone . Similar results to scenario Sall are found in scenario S1 and scenario S5% . These results indicate that
export restrictions delay the occurrence of shortages for
self-sufficient countries, but accelerate the occurrence of
shortages for not-self-sufficient countries.
Fraction of countries with Ts > Ta

Moreover, we find that for both sections, there are more
countries facing shortages than infected countries in scenarios S1 , S5% , and Sall . This finding indicates that
pandemic-resulted export restrictions can make shortage
contagion transmit even faster than disease contagion.

set as follows: θp,i (t) = 0, φi = 10.

These results also present the double-edged nature
of the PPE trade relationship between countries. On
the one hand, such relationships allow countries (especially not-self-sufficient countries) to address the pandemic with the help of trading partners. On the other
hand, shortage contagion can also transmit through these
relationships. As illustrated in Fig. 4(c), 80 countries suffer from shortages while only 26 countries are infected at
t = 100. The surge in domestic demand in infected countries leads to a reduction in their exports. The shortage
contagion then spills over to non-infected countries because the domestic demand cannot be met. However,
countries can mitigate such spillover effects by increasing production while facing shortages. We present the
averaged fraction of countries facing shortages for each
month with different production increase factor θp,i (t) in
scenarios Snone and Sall in the Supplemental Material.
We observe in both sections that, the number of countries
facing shortages decreases greatly as θp,i (t) grows, espe-

cially at the early stage (from January to June). Besides,
even as θp,i (t) grows, there are still more countries facing shortages in scenario Sall than that in scenario Snone
for the same θp,i (t). These results indicate that cooperation between countries (no export restrictions) always
plays an essential role in preventing global shortages of
PPE regardless of the production level. But at the same
time, a higher production level leads to less dependence
on imports, which greatly helps countries cope with PPE
shortages. Therefore, except for promoting global cooperation, governments and international organizations
should take actions to reduce supply chain barriers and
work together to increase global PPE production.

0, the world total inventory level Invw (t) and the world
(s)
total unmet domestic demand Uw (t) in scenarios Snone ,
S1 , and Slower are all lower than that in scenarios S5%
(s)
and Sall . Compared with scenario Sall , Uw (t) in scenario Snone is reduced by 100%, 93%, and 24% for January, February, and March in section 1, respectively. In
(s)
section 2, Uw (t) is reduced by 100%, 100%, and 0.64%
for January, February, and March, respectively. These results show that, with export restrictions, a large amount
of PPE is hoarded instead of being distributed to where
it is most needed, particularly at the early stage. We
can also find that, although there are more countries facing shortages in scenario S5% than that in scenario Sall
(s)
(s)
(Fig. 3), Invw (t) and Uw (t) in scenario S5% are almost
the same as or even slightly lower than that in scenario
Sall . From this perspective, we can conclude that the
more top exporters restrict exports, the less effective the
global PPE supply chain is. These findings further indicate that export restrictions are not an appropriate solution to address the pandemic. A fully functional PPE
supply chain system could leave countries more time to
adapt their production and identify alternative supply
sources. Countries should lift the export restrictions to
help allocate PPE more effectively and efficiently for the
collective benefit of humankind.
In summary, we investigated how the shortage contagion, induced by demand surges and export restrictions,
transmits on the global PPE trade network during the
COVID-19 pandemic. We simulated the impacts of five
export restriction scenarios based on an integrated network model, which integrates the real-world PPE trade
data and global mobility data. We find evidence that
the shortage contagion pattern is mainly determined by
the export restriction policies of the top exporters. Export restrictions can cause shortage contagion to trans-

mit even faster than the disease contagion, with only the
top 5% of exporters imposing export restrictions. To
some extent, export restrictions can provide benefits for
self-sufficient countries, at the sacrifice of immediate economic shocks at not-self-sufficient countries. The results
also validate that export restrictions are not an effective
and efficient solution to confront the pandemic. PPE is
not properly allocated to countries with shortages. To
better respond to the next wave of COVID-19 and other
emerging infectious diseases, countries should keep PPE
trade open and reduce reliance on only a small number
of PPE exporters.
