Abstract. In a pandemic like Covid-19, there are many countries of lower-earning
cannot provide a complete locked-down within the duration of the detected case. The
locked-down may result in famine throughout the region of underdeveloped countries
after the outbreak. So, a conjectural setup of an epidemic has been studied by applying
specific period of locked-down (30 days) in 5 different scenarios. The stochastic
approach to the SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected and Recovered) model has been
used to evaluate the dynamics and the effects of locked-down. It is observed that there
exist a suitable period to apply locked-down where more susceptible escape from the
infection. The effect of the early (as soon as the infected case detected) and late (with
respect to the estimated peak of detected cases for no locked-down) implementation
of the locked-down has also been studied and found that the late implementation
of locked-down will take the least time to end the epidemic. The CFR (Case Fatality
Rate) has also been found to be varied from 7.55 to 8.02 for all the considered scenarios.

Keywords: SEIR model, Stochastic individuals, escape out susceptible, Barabasi

1. Introduction
In a pandemic like Covid-19 originated at Wuhan, China, the whole world gets stuck
all at once for months [1]. The food supply chain gets broken, all the local and global
business falls, financial crisis has intensified. To prevent the damages due to the virulent
pandemic, all the regional area require to be locked-down. But most of the countries of
the world cannot provide food to their people if they get locked-down for months. They
have to trade the damages due to the epidemic of their people with foods and economics
for the people. Besides, a virus outbreak like coronavirus can take years to control and
vaccinated. Thus, it is very necessary to know about the implementation strategy of
the locked-down situation to a country of low and middle income.

The SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected and Recover) compartmental model is
a very well standard method in epidemiology to predict the dynamics of the infection
[2, 3]. It is well known that the SEIR model can prescribe many important aspects of the
dynamics of infectious disease. A number of researches are using this model to analyze
the Covid-19 outbreak in the various region along with other models [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. Using
this SEIR model, Mwalili et. al. suggest that the quarantine and the isolation method
will win over the spreading of Coronavirus [9]. All of those estimations and predictions
made by the deterministic model are impressively comply with the situation. These
researches also help to make policy and strategy over controlling the epidemic for many
countries.
The stochastic model of the SEIR and its variations are also being using for the
prediction of the dynamics of epidemics [10]. The important part of the stochastic model
of epidemics is that it does not require the integration as that of the deterministic model.
It is also important to consider the communication structure of the individuals for better
understanding of the transmission of disease, the effect of social distancing and contact
tracing which can be implemented in the stochastic model. An implementation of the
network model in stochastic SEIR model has been developed by S. G. Ryan et. al.
where communication distribution of the individuals can be studied [11].
In the case of an epidemic (basic reproduction number is larger than unity), the
stochastic SEIR model becomes useful to analyze the implementation of various epidemic
control policy. In this work, the authors would like the find out the variation in dynamics
due to applying the locked-down (social distancing) in a region. The authors would
also like to find out the number of escape population from the epidemic disease. The
stochastic network model has been described briefly in the method section. The results
of a conjectural experiment have been discussed in the results and discussion section.
The summary of the work has been provided in the conclusion section.

In the network model of population, a graph represents the state of an individual
(S, E, I, DE , DI , R, F ) and their interactions. At a given time, each individual
interacts with close contacts with a probability of (1−p)β and the interaction probability
with the global network is pβ.
Each individual (i) in a considered region has a state Xi which updates according
to the following probability transition rates [11] (and Ryan Seamus McGee, personal

3. Results and Discussions
The conjectural experiment has been designed for a total number of population N ,
100000. The magnitude of the parameter β = βD = 1/1.54, σ = σD = 1/4.5 and
γ = γD = 1/3.34 are chosen in such a way that the detected infection has a width
of at least 60 days. The other parameters are chosen as µI = 0.03, µD = 0.0004,
θE = θI = 0.02, φE = φI = 0.2, ψE = ψI = 1.0, q = 0.5 and initial infection = 10.
In the case of locked-down, the magnitude of p is taken as 0.1 whereas it is 0.5 for the
normal situation. These intentional parameters produce 2.17 for the basic reproduction
number (R0 ) (since the µD is very small).

In this stochastic model, the structured interaction network, Barabasi-Albert Model
[12], has been considered as shown in Fig. 2; where the frequency of individuals is plotted
against their degrees of communication. The mean degrees of communication for normal,
social distancing (locked-down) and quarantine situation is considered as 23.0, 3.3 and
1.6 respectively. The quarantine has been applied to the infected individuals after the
detection.
The values of the parameters are chosen in such a way that the detected case
of without locked-down has a width of more than 90 days. It is considered that the
epidemic region can be locked-down for only 30 days. Thus, it becomes necessary to

apply this 30 days more carefully so that the damage due to epidemic can be minimized.
Since the detected case has been found from 30th day to 160th day in the case of without
locked-down scenario (Fig. 3), the locked-down phase has been chosen form 10th to 40th ,
40th to 70th , 70th to 100th , 100th to 130th and 130th to 160th day (say scenario 1 - 5). It
is to be noted that the increase in the detected case is found after the 44th day. The
effect of locked-down for the described scenarios is visualized in Fig. 3 by considering
the detected active cases (DE ). In the case of scenario 1 and 2, the shift in the increase
of detected active cases has been observed whereas a steady and decreasing trend has
been observed for scenario 3 and 4, respectively. For scenario 5, there is no observable
shift whereas the widest shifting is found for scenario 1. It is also observed that the
peak of the detected cases for scenario 3 is lower than 0.25% whereas all other scenarios
it crosses the 0.80% of the total population (percentages are taken with respect to the
total population). It indicates that applying conditional locked-down at a suitable time,
can control the number of maximum active infected cases. This will help to use the
maximum medical facilities which may contribute to minimize the fatal cases.
The simulated active infected cases (I) are shown for all of the scenarios in Fig.
4. A similar trend of shifting has been observed as described for Fig. 3. But the peak
seems to be the same for no locked-down and all the scenarios except 3. In the case
of scenario 3, the peak is found after 79th day which is 9-days later of the locked-down
implementation day (1/β + 1/σ + 1/γ ≈ 9). Such a 9-days activity is also found for
scenario 4 decrease rapidly after 109th day with respect to the no locked-down situation.
Since the detected cases are not inter-related (a random fraction of the infected cases are

The dynamics of the susceptible population (S) is the greater interest of this
conjectural experiment. Fig. 5 shows the variation in the dynamics of the susceptible
population for all the cases. It is found that there are more than 30% susceptible

population remains unaffected after the epidemic for no locked-down, early and lately
locked-down (scenario 1, 2 and 3). It is also observed that this percentage become more
than 40% for scenario 3 and 4 (where locked-down happened near the peak of without
locked down). The early or late locked down seems to produce a similar number of
unaffected susceptible. These analyses indicate that there exists a suitable time for
applying conditional locked down where more people can escape from the infection.

Figure 6. Estimation of the Case Fatality Rate (CFR) for various locked-down
scenario.

The Case Fatality Rate (CFR) calculation is complicated as it should not be
[13, 14, 15]. In this article, the CFR has been calculated as the rate of deceased for the
recovered population at the same time [16]. It is observed that the CFR varies from
7.55 to 8.02 for all the locked-down scenario including no locked-down case after 130
days (Fig. 6). The lowest CFR is found for the scenario 2 whereas it is expected for
the scenario 3 because of the steady observation in detected cases (with respect to Fig.
3). The initial fluctuations are well understood for their detection and treatment to
the patient. The observed under or over estimation in the initial CFR has been well
discussed by Rajgor et.al. [14]. Though the number of case fatality depends on many
of the other factors (like age, immunity, previous medical condition etc.), the variation
in the observed CFR indicates that the fatality can also be depended on the applying
conditional locked-down.
This simulation has been run until no infected cases for the 100000 population. It
is observed that the longest and shortest epidemic occurs for scenarios 1 and 5. Which
describes whether to chose longest or shortest time.

4. Conclusions
A conjectural experiment has been designed to predict the effect of locked-down in
an epidemic. The Barabasi-Albert communication network model has been used to
produce deploy the regional normal, social distancing and quarantine communication of
individuals. The stochastic SEIR model has been intentionally parameterized so that
the detected active case can be observed for more than 90 days. A 30 days locked-down
period has been applied in 5 of the specific scenarios. The above mentioned notional
experiment with intentional parameters can be summaries as:
(i) If the allocated 30 days locked-down period has been applied too early (scenario
1 and 2) or lately (scenario 5), it barely modifies the dynamics of no locked-down
case.
(ii) In the case of scenario 1 and 2, the dynamics only shifted for more than 30 and 20
days respectively. So, the locked-down should not be applied too early, if it requires
to maintain a conditional locked-down.
(iii) In the study of the dynamics of susceptible population, interestingly scenario 3 and
4 has more than 40% susceptible individual remains after the outbreak.
(iv) It is observed that the initial fluctuation of CFR becomes steady after the 93rd day
(the day where the peak occurs in the infected case due to no locked-down condition
Fig. 4). The lowest CFR is 7.55 which is found for scenario 2.
(v) Very interestingly, scenario 5 (where late locked-down has been introduced) takes
least time to reach the end of the epidemic. And the scenario 1 takes the longest
time to reach at the end.
Though the verification of the above mentioned experiment is not feasible in reality,
the authors believe that the speculated summary will impact very efficiently to make
the policy for controlling the epidemic.
