Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused, in general, a sharp reduction in
traffic and industrial activities. This in turn leaded to a reduction in air
pollution around the world. It is important to quantity the amount of that
reduction in order to estimate the influence weight of traffic and industrial
activities over the total variation of air quality. The aim of this paper is to
evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on air pollution in Israel,
which is considered one of the countries with a higher air pollution than
other Western countries. The results reveal two main findings: 1. During
the COVID-19 outbreak, relative to its earlier closest period, the pollution
from transport, based on Nitrogen oxides, had reduced by 40% on average,
whereas the pollution from industrial, based on Grand-level ozone, had
increased by 34% on average. Relative to 2019, the COVID-19 outbreak
caused a reduction in air pollution from transport and industrial as well.
2. The explanation percent of the time period of COVID-19 is at most
22% over the total variation of each pollutant amount.

Introduction

Air pollution causes morbidity, death, and economic damage. The sources of air
pollution in Israel include man made air pollution sources such as transportation, power plants, factories, as well as natural sources, such as dust storms.
In addition to the pollution that comes from Israel, the migration of pollution
brings additional pollution from Europe or the desert. Other sources of pollution
are domestic air pollution, soil pollution, quarries, and the result of pesticide
spraying. Severe air pollution exists in the Bay of Haifa, Tel Aviv and Gush
Dan as well as in Jerusalem. Haifa and its surroundings have air pollution from
factories and transport alike, when the air pollution is a product of a number of
factories operating in a small area, producing high and unusual air pollution in
terms of the quantities and types of toxins emitted into the air. Common pollutants in Haifa Bay are Sulfur dioxide (SO2 ), Nitrogen oxides (NOx ), Particulate
matter (PM), and Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), such as Benzene. In
1

Tel Aviv and Gush Dan, air pollution is mainly from transportation; the area
suffers from severe air pollution caused mainly by vehicles on which the transport is based in and around Tel Aviv-Yafo, as well as buses and trucks stuck in
traffic jams, and airport. Transportation emits NO2 , NOx , Grand-level ozone
(O3 ), Carbon monoxide (CO), and particulate matter 10 micrometers or less in
diameter (PM10 ).
The first tackle with the COVID-19 pandemic was reduction of the economic
activity. Particularly a sharp reduction in road traffic, air traffic, shipping and
industrial activities. This in turn leaded to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution around the world. For example, one of the largest drops
in pollution levels could be seen over the city of Wuhan, in central China, which
was put under a strict lockdown in late January. The city of 11 million people serves as a major transportation hub and is home to hundreds of factories
supplying car parts and other hardware to global supply chains. According to
Nasa, NO2 levels across eastern and central China have been 10%-30% lower
than normal. NO2 levels also dropped in South Korea, which has long struggled
with high emissions from its large fleet of coal-fired power plants but also from
nearby industrial facilities in China.
In this paper we give an initial investigation of the influence of COVID-19
time period on air quality in Israel. The global COVID-19 epidemic in Israel
began to spread towards the end of February 2020. As part of the Israeli Ministry of Health’s deal with the epidemic, starting in mid-March, regulations
imposed on the public. At first, a local closure on places where the virus is
spreading had taken, as well as movement the public sector to the emergency
and the private sector to a limited 70% service. Branches that worked in order - up to 100%, while reducing as much as possible, were, for example, the
energy sector (including electricity, natural gas, oil, water), food industries (including agriculture, supermarkets, transport, storage and more), all freight and
storage services, the ports and shipping companies, and workplace dealing with
construction or infrastructure work. Industries that only some employers could
work with 100% were, for examples, various economic sectors, and economy
and industry. The public transport activity was also reduced to a quarter of
its normal size, train traffic was disabled and the number of passengers in the
taxi was limited. It was decided to ban crowds of over 10 people, and to shut
down all recreation and leisure. Next, the regulations became tougher: people
were ordered the avoidance of leaving home, except for emergency situations
that required it. Later on, they asked leaving the place of residence no longer
than 100 meters and for a short time. On April 19, for the first time, easing
restrictions applied to the public took effect. In the beginning of May, relief was
added (for example, people were allowed to go more than 100 meters). Based
on these dates, the restrictions time period is March 1 , 2020 until May 1, 2020.
During writing this paper, the available data we had was until May 2, 2020.
Therefore, throughout this paper, we refer to the time period of March 1 , 2020
until May 2, 2020 as the COVID-19 period. In order to examine any influence
of this time period on air quality, needs to compare this period with its earlier
closest period, with its parallel period a year ago, and with its parallel period
2

over various years ago. If any influence exists, we should quantity its amount,
and its relative weight over the total variation of a given pollutant, as well. In
this paper, we consider the earlier closest period to be the period of January 1,
2020 until February 29, 2020. For the comparison with a year ago, we compare
the whole period of January 1, 2020 until May 2, 2020, with the same period at
2019. Throughout this paper, we refer to the period of January 1 until May 2,
for a given year, as the full period. We compare the full period over the years
2000-2020, as well.
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data framework
used to evaluate the air quality during the full period over the considered years.
Section 3 presents the impact of the COVID-19 period on air quality, while
Section 4 examines this impact along with weather variables. Section 5 gives a
discussion and a summary of the analysis results.

Data

The data we use in this paper was downloaded from the Ministry of the Environment web [1]. We consternate on the two regions of Haifa and Gush-Dan,
which, as was mentioned in Section 1, have highly air pollution in Israel. The
list of the considered stations in Haifa and Gush-Dan, that includes their names,
names in the paper, type, and area type, is described in Table 1. The general
stations are stations located in a representative area, at the height of the roofs
of buildings or in open rural areas. These stations are not near specific emission
sources, such as industrial plants or roads. The transport stations are highway
stations along major transport routes. Measuring at this height makes monitoring of the transport stations to best represent the concentration of pollutants
exposed to pedestrians, cafes and drivers in the city.

The resolution of the data is half-hour in a day, and the considered air pollutants are PM (PM10 and PM2.5 ), NOx , NO2 , NO, CO, O3 , SO2 , Benzene,
Toluene, and Ethyl Benzene (EthylB). In addition, we use the weather variables wind-direction (WD), wind-speed (WS), temperature (Tmp), and relativehumidity (RH). We consider at each region the pollutants and weather variables
having no more than 10% missing values each one, at a specific station. In order to deal with unreasonable negative values of the pollutants, we converted
negative values smaller than -1 to zero, while we treated as missing data the
negative values that are larger than -1. The measurement units of each variable
are described in Tables 2, 3.

Impact of COVID-19

We follow three comparisons in order to examine the influence of COVID-19
time period on air quality:
1. A comparison of COVID-19 period (March 1, 2020 until May 2, 2020) with
its earlier closest period.
2. A comparison of the full period (January 1 until May 2), over the years 2020
and 2019.
3. A comparison of the full period (January 1 until May 2), over the years
2000-2020.
Each comparison is based on means comparison of a given pollutant at a specific
station. The calculation of the mean omitted the missing values. For testing the
significant of the difference, we used the t-test for two means comparison. In
order to evaluate the relative contribution of the COVID-19 period to the total
variation of a given pollutant, at a specific station, we used a linear regression
model. This model includes an indicator variable, ind, which is defined to be 0
if the date of the record belongs to the earlier closest period, and 1 if the date of
the record belongs to the COVID-19 period. That is, this variable distinguishes
between the COVID-19 period and the other period. Then, the model is of the
form Y = α + βind, where Y is the amount of a given pollutant at a specific

station. The resulted R2 of the model obtains the desired result. By this we can
understand the explanation percent of the total variation of a specific pollutant
as contributed by transport and industrial activates.

3.1

Comparison of COVID-19 period with its earlier closest period

Here we compare, for a given pollutant at a specific station, its mean at the
COVID-19 period with its mean at the earlier closest period. Most of the pollutants had a reduction in their means at the COVID-19 period relative to the
earlier closest period. But some of them had increasing. In most cases, the
reduction/increasing was significant. We report on the significant results only.
The relative change of each pollutant, which is defined as (mean(covid − 19) −
mean(earlier))/mean(earlier)) ∗ 100%, over the considered stations for Haifa
and Gush-Dan, is summarized in Tables 4, 5. These tables contain the R2 that
resulted by the above regression model.

A number of common trends are seen, as follows.
3.1.1

Nitrogen oxide

The pollutants No, NOx , and NO2 are all compounds of Nitrogen oxide. Generally, the most common source of Nitrogen oxide air pollution is internal combustion engines for motor vehicles, and power plants. Particulary in Israel, the
main source of nitrogen oxides is air pollution from land vehicles such as cars,
buses and trucks. During the COVID-19 period, these pollutants of NO, NOx ,
and NO2 had a consistent reduction relative to the earlier closest period, over all
the considered stations in Haifa and Gush-Dan. The reduction is, on average,
-33.35 in Haifa, and -46.33 in Gush-Dan. Note that in Gush-Dan the reduction
is higher than in Haifa; This is coincide with the fact that the main source of air
pollution in Gush-Dan is from transport. In more details, the reduction for each
component of these pollutants in Haifa is: NO2 : -31.21, NO: -36, NOx :-32.83,
and in Gush-Dan: NO2 : -40.63, NO: -51.94,NOx : -47.33. The explanation percent of the total variation of each of these pollutants by the period indicator is
ranged between 0 to 0.09 in Haifa, and between 0.01 to 0.22 in Gush-Dan. Particulary, the percent explanation of Nitrogen oxide by the period in Gush-Dan
is a little higher than in Haifa, which again coincide with the above fact.
3.1.2

Ground-level ozone (O3 )

Ground-level ozone is a secondary pollutant created by photochemical reaction
between primary pollutants such as nitrogen oxides, and hydrocarbons (volatile
organic compounds) in the presence of solar radiation. These pollutants are
emitted from industrial pollution and pollution from transport. In contrary
to Nitrogen oxide, O3 had increased during the COVID-19 period relative to
the closest period, over all the considered stations in Haifa and Gush-Dan. The
increasing is, on average, 20.86 in Haifa, and 46.24 in Gush-Dan. This surprising
result is due to increasing in promotion of transport and energy infrastructures
[2], and due to increasing in home renovations [3]. That is, industrial pollution.
The explanation percent of O3 by the period indicator is ranged between 0.07
to 0.18 in Haifa, and between 0.13 to 0.22 in Gush-Dan.
3.1.3

CO

Carbon monoxide emissions usually occur as a result of incomplete combustion
processes of natural gas, oil and coal. The main industrial activities contributing
to carbon monoxide emissions are: metal processing, power generation, metal
and coal mining, food production, gas and oil production, chemical production,
cement and lime production, plaster and concrete production, oil production and
refining. Other sources of carbon monoxide emissions include human sources transportation (vehicles, aircraft, ships), construction equipment, home heating,
cigarettes and fires. And natural resources - volcanoes, forest burning, lightning.
One of the most important sources of massive exposure to carbon monoxide in

9

humans is tobacco smoking. During the COVID-19 period, CO had decreased
relative to the earlier closest period over all the considered stations in GushDan, by -36.93 on average. This can be due to the reduction in transport. The
explanation percent of CO by the period indicator is ranged between 0.13 to
0.22. But, in the two stations in Haifa for which CO was measured, one station
had a reduction of -11.42 in CO, with R2 = 0.05, whereas the other station had
an increasing of 4.96, with R2 = 0.01, both general stations. The last increasing
can be due to increasing in industrial pollution, as was noted above.
3.1.4

PM10 and PM2.5

Particulate matter has natural and human sources. Natural sources that emit
particles with volcanoes, dust storms, forest and grass fires, vegetative pollen,
and seawater spray. Human particle-forming operations include combustion of
fossil fuel in vehicles and power plants; Industrial activities such as mining, and
combustion processes in various industries; Burning wood for heating and cooking, and burning vegetation (for example in felled agriculture and burning); As
well as dust caused by soil and desertification due to non-sustainable farming.
On a global average, human sources of particulate matter are only about 10% of
the total particle in the atmosphere. PM is divided into coarse particles, PM10 ,
and fine particles, PM2.5. The origin of the coarse PM10 particles may be dust
(from a natural or human source such as construction), agriculture, mining,
fly ash, spores and plant particles. The source of the finer respiratory particles PM2.5 is usually gases emitted as a result of fire and industrial combustion
processes that become particles in the atmosphere. During the COVID-19 period, PM10 had increased relative to the closest period, over all the considered
stations in Haifa and Gush-Dan. This, can be due to increasing in industrial
pollution, as was noted above. The increasing is on average 55.28 on Haifa,
and 40.1 in Gush-Dan. The explanation percent of PM10 by the period indicator is very small and between 0.01 to 0.03 over Haifa and Gush-Dan. From
the other hand, PM2.5 had increased in most stations except for two stations,
which had reduction. Over the stations with increasing in PM2.5 , the increasing
in Haifa was 22.63 on average, and in 22.79 on average in Gush-Dan. For the
two stations with reduction: the reduction in Haifa was -4.24 (general station),
and in Gush-Dan it was -16.67 (traffic station). This is coincide with the fact
that Gush-Dan is a traffic city, therefore the reduction is due to the reduction
in transport, whereas the increasing in PM for most stations considered is due
to increasing in industrial pollution. The R2 is at most 3% over Haifa and
Gush-Dan.
3.1.5

SO2

Human sources of atmospheric sulfur dioxide emissions are the use of fossil fuels
- mainly coal and oil, as well as in the smelting and production processes of
metals and minerals from sulfur-containing lead. The most important human
source of sulfur dioxide is the burning of sulfur-containing quartz fuels for home

10

heating, electricity generation at power plants, and motorized vehicles. In most
stations in Haifa and Gush-Dan, SO2 decreased during the COVID-19 relative
to the closet period, but some stations had increasing in SO2 . The reduction
is on average -28.31 on Haifa, and -5.22 in Gush-Dan. Over the stations with
increasing in SO2 , the increasing is on average 17.14 in Haifa, and 5.99 in GushDan. The explanation percent of SO2 by the period indicator is very small and
is 0.03 at most over Haifa and Gush-Dan.
3.1.6

Volatile Organic Components

Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are organic chemicals with high vapor pressure at room temperature. Man-made emission sources are divided into two
main groups: combustion processes (air pollution from transport, industrial
fuel combustion, vegetation fires and more), and evaporation processes (such
as storage tanks, various products in the home or office and more). The main
sources of man-made emissions can be divided into industrial, transport (and
gas stations) and emissions in the home environment. In our data, the pollutants
Benzene, Toluene, and EthylB are components of VOCs, which were measured
in one station in Haifa (general urban station). during the COVID-19, relative
to the closet period, they all had reduction of -49.5, -25.65, and -55.83, respectively. The explanation percent of these three pollutants is 0.13, 0.01, and 0.04,
respectively.

3.2

Comparison of the full period over 2019-2020

Here we compare the full period (January 1 until May 2) over 2019 and 2020.
This comparison is in terms of the relative difference in pollutant amount only,
without examining the period contribution to this difference. Each comparison is based on means comparison of a given pollutant at a specific station.
The calculation of the mean omitted the missing values. The relative difference for a given pollutant at a specific station is defined as (mean2020 −
mean2019 )/mean2019 . Tables A1, 2 in the Appendix present the results. In
addition, we used the t-test for two means comparison for testing the significance of the reduction/increasing for each pollutant. The resulted p-value is
described in Tables A1, A2 in the Appendix. For testing the significant of the
difference, we use the t-test for two means comparison. A number of common
trends are seen, as follows. In Gush-Dan, significant reduction in PM10 and
PM2.5 observed in all considered stations; significant reduction observed in the
pollutants CO, NO2 , NOx , and NO in all considered stations except for one
station (Yad-Avner) which has no difference between 2019 and 2020. In Haifa,
significant reduction observed in the pollutants PM10 , PM2.5 , NO2 , NOx ,NO,
and SO2 , but a significant increasing observed in the pollutants O3 , EthylB,
Toluene, and Benzene. These are measures for one station only. The percent of
change in Haifa is: NOx : -28.09, NO: -36.24, NO2 :-24.95, SO2 : -23.09, PM10 :
-25.96, PM2.5 : -30.32, and in Gush-Dan: NOx : -29.27, NO: -40.16, NO2 : -24.78,
CO: -8.07, PM10 : -31.56, PM2.5 : -28.38.

Comparison of the full period over the years 2000-2020

In order to understand if the observed change between 2019 and 2020 during
the full period (January 1 until May 2) is due to COVID-19 only, or it is a part
of a trend in the last years, we examined the behaviour of the pollutants in the
full period over the years 2000-2020. Figure 1 and Figure 2 present the trend
lines for each pollutant at the various stations in Haifa and Gush-Dan, respectively. These trend lines are based on average of the measures at a specific year,
where the calculation of the average omitted the missing values. Places in the
graph where the trend line is truncated are due to missing values in the whole
period over the specific year. For Gush-Dan, the graphs are based on measures
in the stations Remez, Amiel, IroniD, Yad-Avner, and Holon. For Haifa, there
was no unique station that had measures over the whole period over the years
2000-2020. Therefore the graphs are based on mixed of stations: for the years
2000-2010, the measures were taken from the station Market; for the years 20112020 the measures were taken from the station Azmaut, but from the station
Park Carmel when no measures in station Azmaut, and from Nesher when no
measures in the former stations. For the PM measures, there were some years
with measures of PM10 , and some other years with measures of PM2.5 , therefore we combined these data into one graph. That is, the graphs presented for
Haifa are only sketch to see the trend of each pollutant over the years 2000-2020.

Figure 2: Air pollution in Gush-Dan over the years 2000-2020, in the period January 1 - May 2

The general trends that are seen in the graphs are as follows. For GushDan, a decreasing trend is observed in NOx , NO2 , No; the trend in PM10 is
zigzag, that is, jumping up and down; a decreasing trend in CO, but there
is some increasing trend in the three recent years as observed in the stations
IroniD and Yad-Avner. For Haifa, an increasing trend is observed in NOx ,
NO2 , and No started at the year 2011, but it had decreased in the last years;
increasing trend in O3 , which had started to decrease at the year 2016, but
still it is high; for PM, a decreasing trend started around the year 2013 and
continue until now; some decreasing trend in SO2 started around the year 2007,
but there is some increasing trend in the last years. For all these pollutants in
Haifa there is reduction in 2020, except of O3 which increases. Using Multiple
comparisons of means (parametric t-test or non-parametric Wilcoxon test) for a
given pollutant for each two consecutive years, some comparisons are significant
and some of them are not. That is, during the years 2000-2020, we can see some
years with a reduction in the amount of some pollutants. Looking inside the
activates that are related to transport and industry can explain these trends.
The transport activities include a transfer of the diesel power plant to natural
gas, and technological improvements in the engines and fuels of trucks, buses
and cars. This resulted in a marked decrease in sulfur oxides (SOx), and some
decline in nitrogen oxides (NOx ). This also can explain the reduction of air
pollution in Gush Dan. However, there is no necessarily a reduction in PM and
O3 . In addition, improvement made in the fuels and in the combustion system
in automotive engines, and catalytic converters had introduced. Therefore, the
concentration of CO in the air had been reduced. Nevertheless, most exposure to
high concentrations of CO occurs in areas where there is a dense concentration
of slow moving vehicles, especially in busy city centers and along access routes.
The reduction in air pollution from factories and power plants, especially in
industrial pollution centres as Haifa Bay, is due to a combination of legislation,
public pressure and increased awareness that lead to the adoption of cleaner
technologies, cleaning and filtering technologies, beyond the use of natural gas.
As a summary, overall, there is a trend of reduction in air pollution in recent
years. But although, the reduction that was observed in 2020 in some of the
pollutants is even more than the decreasing trend seen before. That is, this
expresses the influence of COVID-19 period, and its component of reduction
transport pollution, and increasing of industrial pollution. All this true when
assuming that there was no a significant change in weather, but it is mire or
less the same over the recent years. That is, the change during the COVID-19
period is not part of the trend but the influence of the COVID-19 period.

Impact of COVID-19 along with weather factors

The contribution of the period indicator for the variation of the pollutant
amount, as we saw in Section 3, is 22% at most. But, needs to take into

15

account other factors that may explain this variation. These factors can explain
the difference in the pollutant amount during the COVID-19 period relative to
its earlier closest period, as well. Due to the available data we have in hand,
we examined the influence of the weather variables along with the indicator for
period. We did it by using a linear regression include the indicator variable
ind as in Section 3, and the weather variables wind-direction (WD), wind-speed
(WS), temperature (Tmp), and relative-humidity (RH). Because of possible correlations between these variables, the regression model includes usually some of
these variables and
all of them together. That is, the model is of the form
Pnot
p
Y = α + β1 ind + j=2 βj Xj , where Y is the amount of a given pollutant at a
specific station, and Xj denotes the weather variables. The weather variables
included in each model in addition to the period indicator are presented in Tables 6, 7 for Haifa and Gush-Dan, respectively. The combination of the variables
WD and WS is denoted in the tables as WDS. These tables also report the R2
for each model. By this we get the percent of the total variation of the pollutant
as explained by the variables included in the model. The maximum explanation
percent of the total variation for each pollutant by the weather variables and
the indicator for period together is as follows: Nitrogen oxide (No, NOx , and
NO2 ): 0.38 in Haifa, and 0.43 in Gush-Dan; Ground-level ozone (O3 ): 0.58 in
Haifa, and 0.49 in Gush-Dan; CO: 0.26 in Haifa, and 0.21 in Gush-Dan; PM:
0.11 in Haifa, and 0.10 in Gush-Dan; SO2 : 0.27 in Haifa, and 0.05 in Gush-Dan;
VOCs: 0.33.

Discussion

The period of COVID-19 breakout had influenced the air pollution in Israel in
two components, pollution from transport and pollution from industrial. Relative to its earlier closest period, the COVID-19 period caused a reduction in
pollution from transport, and an increasing in pollution from industry due to
increasing in infrastructures building and home renovations. We evaluate the
pollution from transport mainly by the Nitrogen oxide (i.e., NOx , NO2 , and
No), and the pollution from industrial by O3 . Over the regions of Haifa and
Gush-Dan, the reduction in pollution from transport was on average between
-33% to -46%, while the increasing in O3 was on average, between 21% to 46%.
Other pollutants had the both changes of increasing and decreasing over the various considered stations. That is, they captured the both influences of transport
and industry. But overall, all pollutants except the VOCs decreased relative to
the same period in the last year. The influence of the period over the total
variation of each pollutant is at most 22%, while adding weather variables resulted in explanation percent of 58% at most. As a conclusion, although the
sharp reduction in transport, still the reduction in air pollution from it was
less than 50%, and the percent of explanation by period was not high. Adding
the weather variables increases the percent of explanation of the total variation
of each pollutant, for a level which is higher than 50%. That is, there is still
high percent that we was not explained. Comparing with the previous period,
reduction was in almost all pollutants, that is, the increasing in industrial not
achieve the general reduction percent in pollution form industrial. But still the
reduction was less than 50%. Two possible explanations for this. First, there
are other possible factors that may influence the air pollution, which we did not
control them. Second, even if we completely stop polluting, probably some of
the pollution will sink but some will remain. That is, the decay in pollution
may be non-linear, and therefore should try a polynomial relation for further
research.
