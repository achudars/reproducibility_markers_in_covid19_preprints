Abstract—As COVID-19 has been spreading across the world
since early 2020, a growing number of malicious campaigns are
capitalizing the topic of COVID-19. COVID-19 themed cryptocurrency scams are increasingly popular during the pandemic.
However, these newly emerging scams are poorly understood by
our community. In this paper, we present the first measurement
study of COVID-19 themed cryptocurrency scams. We first create
a comprehensive taxonomy of COVID-19 scams by manually
analyzing the existing scams reported by users from online
resources. Then, we propose a hybrid approach to perform the
investigation by: 1) collecting reported scams in the wild; and
2) detecting undisclosed ones based on information collected
from suspicious entities (e.g., domains, tweets, etc). We have
collected 195 confirmed COVID-19 cryptocurrency scams in
total, including 91 token scams, 19 giveaway scams, 9 blackmail
scams, 14 crypto malware scams, 9 Ponzi scheme scams, and 53
donation scams. We then identified over 200 blockchain addresses
associated with these scams, which lead to at least 330K US
dollars in losses from 6,329 victims. For each type of scams, we
further investigated the tricks and social engineering techniques
they used. To facilitate future research, we have released all the
well-labelled scams to the research community.

I. I NTRODUCTION
The coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) has quickly become
a world-wide crisis. Beyond the virus in the physical world,
the cyber-space also suffers from the security threats relevant
to COVID-19. Recent months have witnessed a surge of
malicious campaigns that are exploiting the pandemic, such
as email scams, ransomware, phishing domains and malicious
apps [1]–[4], etc. According to the report from Federal Trade
Commission (FTC), victims in the US have lost over $77
million to fraud during this crisis by the time of July 2020 [5],
and the number is just the ‘tip of the iceberg’, as the fraud
was typically under-reported by consumers.
Blockchain, as one of the most popular techniques in recent
years, has attracted great attentions from attackers in this pandemic. As more and more businesses accept cryptocurrencies
as payments and people have been drawn to cryptocurrencies,
more scammers have appeared to take advantage of these eager
new targets to steal money. According to an FBI press released
on April 2020, the number of scams related to cryptocurrency
has increased greatly during the COVID-19 pandemic [6]. For
example, some scammers posing as World Health Organization
(WHO) sent fake emails asking for Bitcoin donation [7].
They also used a forged email address, “donate@who.int”, to

defraud people. Also, it is reported that a malicious COVID-19
themed domain coronavirusapp.site claims to offer a
real-time coronavirus tracking app [8]. However, the app is a
new kind of ransomware called “CovidLock” that locks the
victim’s devices and requests for Bitcoins in 48 hours on the
ransom note. Besides, a number of Initial Coin Offering (ICO)
and other token scam projects are taking advantage of COVID19 to release trashy cryptocurrency tokens (e.g., CoronaCoin,
COVID19 Coin), to cheat inexperienced investigators [9].
For example, three consecutive exit scams happened for the
CoronaCoin, which broke the project.
This Work. In this paper, we take the first step to characterize the coronavirus-themed cryptocurrency scams. Our goal is
to systematically summarize and investigate different types of
cryptocurrency scams related to COVID-19, explain how they
work, measure their prevalence and characterize their impacts.
To this end, we first make efforts to create a taxonomy of
COVID-19 themed cryptocurrency scams (see Section III).
By resorting to security reports of COVID-19 cybersecurity
attacks and scam reports obtained from discussion forums,
we have summarized a taxonomy of 6 types of scams that
take advantage of both COVID-19 and cryptocurrency to infect
unsuspecting users. These scams include: 1) COVID-19 token
scam, 2) COVID-19 giveaway scam, 3) COVID-19 blackmail
scam, 4) crypto malware scam, 5) COVID-19 themed Ponzi
scheme, and 6) crypto donation scam. By demystifying these
types of scams, we propose a hybrid approach to collect scams
in the wild (see Section IV), and identify 195 COVID-19
themed cryptocurrency scams in total, which correlate with
201 scam blockchain addresses, 57 scam domains, 14 crypto
malware, 47 social accounts and 91 coronavirus-related tokens.
We further measure the characteristics and impacts of these
scams (see Section V). Our investigation shows that at least
330K US dollars have been stolen by the attackers from 6, 329
victims, which is a lower bound estimate of the prevalence and
criminal profits associated with these scams.
To the best of our knowledge, this paper takes the first
step to reveal the COVID-19 themed cryptocurrency scams
with some unexpected and interesting observations. We believe
this work shall shed some light on identifying scams related
to public events. To boost future research, we have released
all the collected COVID-19 cryptocurrency scams to the
community at: https://covid19scam.github.io.

II. BACKGROUND AND R ELATED W ORK
A. Blockchain and Cryptocurrency
Blockchain was invented in 2008 to act as a public, decentralised ledger for Bitcoin. It stores transactions or related
events among involved parties. Each transaction in a block is
verified by consensus on most of the system’s participants,
and the data stored in the blockchain cannot be modified.
Cryptocurrency is a kind of digital asset that uses cryptography
to ensure the security of its creations and transactions. Since
the debut of Bitcoin, thousands of cryptocurrencies are emerging [10]. Cryptocurrencies except Bitcoin can be classified
into two types: Altcoins, which mean alternatives to Bitcoin,
and tokens, which are unable to operate independently without existing blockchain platforms. Blockchains like Ethereum
and EOSIO, have simplified the development of token smart
contracts. One can create a token smart contract with just a
few lines of code [11]. Recent work [12] suggested that there
are over 160,000 tokens exist on Ethereum.
B. Cryptocurrency Scams
More and more attackers target on cryptocurrencies to
make a profit. In 2019, cryptocurrency scams caused over
$ 4.26 billion in losses [13]. Although users, wallets and
exchanges are adopting new countermeasures to avoid being scammed, new scam techniques still emerge to defraud
users’ money. Vasek and Moore surveyed the presence of
Bitcoin-based scams [14] in 2015. By gathering reports from
voluntary vigilantes and reports tracked in online forums,
they identified 192 scams and categorized them into four
groups: Ponzi schemes, mining scams, scam wallets and
fraudulent exchanges. Most of existing scam studies were
focused on detecting the Ponzi schemes [15]–[21], fraudulent
Initial Coin Offering (ICO) [22], [23], market manipulation of
cryptocurrencies [19], [24]–[27], blockchain honeypots [28],
and phishing scams [29], [30], etc. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first work to study COVID-19 themed
cryptocurrency scams.
C. COVID-19 related Research
Since its outbreak, coronavirus has attracted great attentions from various research communities. A large number
of studies were focused on the medical domain, including
pathology study, epidemiology study, treatment study and so
on [31]–[34]. There are also some sociology or psychological
studies on COVID-19 like misinformation research or social
impact analysis [35], [36]. Computer scientists have adopted
computing techniques like machine learning to help medical
practitioners deal with COVID-19. Zhang et al. [37] proposed
the confidence-aware anomaly detection (CAAD) model to
screen viral pneumonia on chest X-ray images. Wang et
al. [38] proposed COVID-Net, a deep convolutional neural
network design tailored for the detection of COVID-19 cases
from chest X-ray (CXR) images.
At the same time, however, cyber attackers also exploit this
situation to conduct criminal activities [3], [39]–[43]. Lallie

et al. [39] analyzed the timeline of COVID-19 themedcyberattacks. They utilised the UK as a case study to demonstrate
how cyber-criminals leveraged key events and governmental
announcements to carefully craft and design attacks. Ahmad
et al. [43] analyzed the security challenges on the work-fromhome model and proposed some recommendations on how to
avoid being attacked by phishing websites or emails. He et
al. [3] presented a systematic analysis of coronavirus-themed
malware and found that over 53% of the malicious apps they
collected were camouflaged as official apps. They also found
that these apps aim to steal users’ private information or to
make profit by phishing and extortion. Sun et al. [44] analyzed
the security and privacy issues of COVID-19 contact tracing
apps. Although a few previous studies mentioned COVID-19
themed scams, there lacks a systematic study on COVID19 themed cryptocurrency scams, such as the impact and
popularity of these scams.
III. A TAXONOMY OF COVID-19 C RYPTO S CAMS
To understand the prevalence and characteristics of COVID19 themed crypto scams in the wild, we first create a comprehensive taxonomy by manually analyzing the existing scam
reports. We will explain how each kind of scams works in
this section. Based on this taxonomy, we will further measure
their popularity and impacts in Section IV and Section V.
Creating the Taxonomy. We resort to the following information to create the taxonomy: 1) security reports of COVID19 cybersecurity attacks released by security companies (e.g.,
DomainTools [45] and McAfee [46]), 2) over 40 scam reports obtained from scam accusations on Bitcointalk [47] and
BitcoinAbuse [48], 3) COVID-19 themed scams summarized
by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) [49], 4) COVID19 scams reported in the threat intelligence platforms (e.g.,
AlienVault [50] and COVID-19 MISP [51]), and 5) the related
information by searching keywords like ‘COVID-19 attack’
and ‘COVID-19 scam’ on Google. We summarize a taxonomy
of 6 types of scams related to COVID-19, as shown in Table I.
We will detail these scams in the following subsections.
A. COVID-19 Token Scam
A number of Initial Coin Offering (ICO) projects and scam
token projects take advantage of COVID-19 to release trashy
cryptocurrency tokens to cheat inexperienced investigators. In

Tricks
Issuing new tokens that claim to be used for charity;
“Pump-and-dump” schemes
Promising to reward users based on the money they sent.
Threatening to spread coronavirus if not receive cryptos,
or selling products/cures for COVID-19.
Locking victims’ phones or computers
and asking for cryptos
Claiming to return high interest payback
if someone invest with cryptos
Acting as public organizations and
claiming to raise money for COVID-19

addition to claiming to help people alleviate the pain of virus
and lockdown, the founding teams of some tokens also indicate
that they will participate in public welfare activities and donate
part of the profit of the tokens to charitable organizations.
Moreover, many tokens can be traded on some decentralized
cryptocurrency exchanges (DEX) and their promotion tricks
make investors believe these tokens are profitable. However,
some tokens are totally scams since the very beginning, and
the founders would just disappear with the investments they
received from the ICO projects. Some token projects may first
run normally after issuing the tokens, but the project owners
who possess most of the tokens will monetize their tokens
when the price increases. This type of scams is also known as
the “Pump-and-dump Scheme” [52], which has been studied
extensively by many researchers [19], [26].
Figure 1 shows the official webpage of the CoronaCoin1
(Token symbol: NCOV), which is claimed to be the first
token related to COVID-19. It has received more and more
attention since reported by medias like Reuters, Nasdaq and
New York Times [53]. It is designed to be burned per 48
hours according to the number of infections and casualties
from the Coronavirus. The founding team calls this mechanism
“proof of death”. It is advertised that by this way, the token
will be deflationary and its value will increase. Although they
donated about $235 on March 6th to the Red Cross for the first
time, which seems to prove they operated this project with a
good will, three consecutive exit scams happened afterwards.
The CoronaCoin’s developers and administrators monetized
the large amount of tokens they managed based on the “Pumpand-dump Schemes”. These scams broke the project, leading
to its current failure. From the scam accusation reports on
BitcoinTalk [54], many investors have found that this token
was a scam at the very beginning and they condemn the
behaviors of designing scams by exploiting the pandemic, but
there are still many unsuspecting investors who were deceived.
B. COVID-19 Giveaway Scam
Giveaway scam is a type of commonly used trick in the
field of cryptocurrency scam, and it is no exception when it
comes to the COVID-19 themed scams. The malicious actors
promise to reward users based on the money (tokens) that the

users send, but they will not fulfill their promises in the end.
The giveaway scam can be delivered using both social network
(e.g., Twitter) and content sharing services (e.g., YouTube).
Figure 2(a) shows an example of giveaway scam
reported on BitcoinAbuse. This YouTube video shows
Bill Gates’ speech about Bitcoin and pandemic investment, which inserts a giveaway scam Bitcoin address
1Gatesk17u25gLEk4JNYMDTg8WkCmLpn47. It asks users
to send Bitcoins to this address so that they will gain a double
payback. It is interesting to see that there is a “Gates” in the
address, which may increase the credibility of the scam.
Giveaway scams are also prevalent on social network.
Note that, our investigation reveals that the scams can be
distributed by either the scam social network accounts or
the hacked accounts. For the scam social network accounts,
they are usually fake accounts that act as the famous people.
For example, there are many fake accounts that have the
same name, avatar and other information with Vitalik Buterin
(one of the co-founders of Ethereum). In this way, they
can post giveaway scam tweets to cheat unsuspecting users.
For the hacked accounts, one of the largest campaigns is
the Twitter’s massive attack on July 15th, 2020 [55]. The
twitter accounts of major companies and individuals were
compromised and these accounts were controlled to conduct a
COVID-19 themed giveaway scam. Figure 2(b) shows one of
the scam tweets. The attackers used Warren Buffett’s account
to ask for sending Bitcoins to their addresses and promised
to return a double payback. Till July 16th, the scam address
bc1qxy2kgdygjrsqtzq2n0yrf2493p83kkfjhx0wlh has received
12.02 BTC (about 110K US dollars2 ).
C. COVID-19 themed Blackmail
The cryptocurrency-related extortion emails are mainly focused on sextortion, according to previous work [56]. During
this pandemic, attackers have adopted some other social engineering techniques for extortion. For example, attackers can
ask for money by threatening that they are able to infect the
emails’ receivers with coronavirus. There are also some scam
emails claiming that they have a cure for coronavirus.
2 As the prices fluctuate all the time, we estimate the prices of cryptocurrencies based on their closing prices on July 16th (the same below).

as a legitimate application. COVID-19 has been invoked for
malicious purposes by the ransomware creators. They usually impersonate COVID-19 themed apps to trick users into
installing them. Once launched, it will encrypt the victim’s
mobile phone files or force a lock screen and extort a high
ransom. Besides, there are also other crypto malware like
crypto miners in the wild.
Figure 4 shows an example of a mobile ransomware3 ,
which was distributed on a malicious COVID-19 themed domain http://coronavirusapp.site. Once launched, the malware
will lock user’s phone and ask for Bitcoins. Clicking the
button on the screen will redirect users to a Pastebin link
(https://pastebin.com/GK8qrfaC) where records the attacker’s
Bitcoin address 18SykfkAPEhoxtBVGgvSLHvC6Lz8bxm3rU.
E. Covid-19 themed Ponzi scheme

Figure 3 shows an example of a COVID-19 themed crypto
extortion email. The attacker claims to be the victim’s neighbour that was infected with COVID-19. He asks the receiver to send Bitcoins to 18P3S6DuNUpW2WLozsrrW6rRd6xh24Rc7N, otherwise he will spread the virus. This address
has been reported 15 times on BitcoinAbuse by the time of
this study. Fortunately, it only receives 0.06 US dollars in total.
We will further discuss the social engineering techniques used
in these scams and their impacts in Section V.
D. COVID-19 Crypto Malware
Ransomware is a type of crypto malware that threatens
to publish the victim’s data or perpetually block access to
it unless a ransom is paid. Ransomware is quite popular
in recent years, which has been widely studied by both
cybersecurity industry and academia [57]–[59]. Ransomware
attack is typically carried out using a Trojan that is disguised

Ponzi scheme is a kind of scam promising high rates of
return with little risk to investors [60]. In fact, the attackers
will only pay back the early investors using the money that
the subsequent investors deposit, and they will finally take all
the money they get and leave. Lots of studies were focused
on this kind of scam, both on normal blockchain Ponzi
schemes [17] and Ponzi schemes built on smart contracts [15],
[16]. Malicious actors also exploit the pandemic to carry
out Ponzi schemes, claiming to help people reduce economic
pressure of income fluctuations during quarantine.
Figure 5 shows an example of a Ponzi scheme domain. The
attackers claimed that they will invest in coronavirus’ vaccine
and give stable and high return to the investors. With such a
promise, the website did not survive for a long time. According
to Wayback Machine4 , the website can be accessed earlier than
March 15th and it was shut down by the time of March 29th.
F. Fake Crypto Donation
Besides some traditional scams on cryptocurrency, we also
identify a number of coronavirus-themed crypto donation
scams spread via emails, social network and websites. Attackers may act as some health-related official organizations or

departments like Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC), World Health Organization (WHO) and the United
Nations International Children’s Fund (UNICEF). Moreover,
some of them act as a charity group or individual to ask for
help during this pandemic. In general, they will ask people
to send money to their cryptocurrency wallet addresses in the
name of donation.
Figure 6 shows a fake donation domain, which was flagged
as malicious by VirusTotal. The attackers call for the cryptocurrency community to fight against the virus by donating
to them. The domain is built on top of WordPress, which
supports donations from 7 kinds of cryptocurrencies. As
another example, Figure 7 shows a donation scam in which
the attacker pretended to be WHO (using the email address
“donate@who.int”). Its sole purpose is to ask for donations to
COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund.
IV. C OLLECTING COVID-19 T HEMED C RYPTO S CAMS
In order to fully understand the prevalence of COVID-19
scams in the wild, we have adopted a hybrid approach to
conduct the investigation by: 1) collecting reported scams
in the wild; and 2) detecting undisclosed ones based on
information collected from various sources. Figure 8 shows
the overall procedure of our approach.
A. Harvesting Reported Scams
Based on the taxonomy of COVID-19 scams summarized
in Section III, we resort to the following scam databases for
collecting known ones reported by users.
1) BitcoinAbuse. BitcoinAbuse [48] is a database where
users can report malicious or scam Bitcoin addresses they

encountered. By the time of this study, BitcoinAbuse has
aggregated more than 170K Bitcoin addresses, which are
mainly used in ransomware, blackmails, and giveaway scams.
To identify the COVID-19 themed scams, we use keywords
like “COVID” or “Corona” to fetch related scam reports.
Through this, 31 COVID-19 themed scam Bitcoin addresses
are identified from BitcoinAbuse. Based on the tags and
descriptions provided by users, we manually classify them into
17 donation scams, 9 blackmail scams, and 5 giveaway scams.
2) CryptoScamDB. CryptoScamDB [61] aims at collecting malicious cryptocurrency domains and related blockchain
addresses using a crowd-sourcing based method. By the time
of this study, there are over 7,700 malicious cryptocurrency
domains collected by CryptoScamDB. To identify COVID19 related scams, we use the heuristics to search keywords
like “COVID” or “corona” in both the domain names and the
labels provided by CryptoScamDB. However, we did not find
any scams related to COVID-19 from CryptoScamDB.
3) BitcoinTalk. BitcoinTalk [47] is an online forum devoted
to the discussion of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. It hosts
a “Scam Accusations” board for people to report scams. Thus,
we have implemented a crawler to get all the related posts,
and then identify scams related to COVID-19 using keywords
matching. Finally, we get 9 related posts. We then manually
analyzed the archived pages and corresponding user reports to
label them. At last, we have identified 4 token scams, 2 Ponzi
schemes, 2 ransomware and 1 donation scam from these posts.
4) Threat Intelligence Platforms. Threat intelligence platforms like AlienVault [50] and some security companies like
McAfee provide reports related to coronavirus-themed attacks.

These reports often contain indicators of compromise (IoCs),
which can reflect attackers’ intentions to a certain extent. We
use a crawler to fetch all the reports and identify 9 COVID-19
cryptocurrency scam reports (with 11 blockchain addresses).
Based on the detailed descriptions provided by these reports,
we have categorized them into 4 donation scams, 5 crypto
ransomware and 2 giveaway scams.
5) StopScamFraud. StopScamFraud [62] is a platform
devoted to collecting users’ reports on scam emails. By the
time of this study, there are over 900 mail accusations related
to COVID-19. As we only consider cryptocurrency related
scams, we search the scams using blockchain related keywords
(e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.). However, we do not find any
related scam accusations.
B. Detecting Unrevealed Scams
To further identify unrevealed COVID-19 themed cryptocurrency scams in the wild, we first perform a semi-automated
analysis to identify suspicious scam entities, and then manually
verify them. As summarized in Table I, the scams can be
delivered via entities including tokens, domain, malware, smart
contract (DApp), email, and social network. Thus, our goal is
to first identify the scam entities related to COVID-19.
1) Scam Tokens. Etherscan [63] is an Ethereum blockchain
explorer that tracks tokens on Ethereum. We resort to Etherscan to search for COVID-19 themed ERC-20 and ERC-721
tokens5 using keywords like “corona” and “COVID-19”. By
the time of our study, we have identified 87 tokens that target
the pandemic. To verify whether they are indeed scams, on
one hand, we search these tokens (with their corresponding
addresses) in Google to check whether they have related websites, social accounts or scam reports. On the other hand, we
manually analyzed all their smart contracts, to see if they use
simple ERC-20 or ERC-721 code templates without additional
functions. Based on our manually verification, we believe all
of them are trashy tokens without any value. COVID-19 is
only used as the publicity stunt to cheat unsuspecting users.
2) Scam Domains. We seek to identify the malicious domains related to COVID-19 first, and then try to detect whether
some of them belong to the scams we summarized. Here, we
take advantage of URLScan [64], an online service that provides history snapshots, IP resolutions and other detailed information of massive domains. We use a number of keywords
including “coronavirus”, “COVID-19” and their squatting ones
(e.g., cor‘a’navirus, cor‘oo’navirus)6 to identify the domain
names that contain the keywords from URLScan. Combining
with COVID-19 themed domains fed by RiskIQ [67], we
have identified 175, 966 newly registered domains that contain
COVID-19 related keywords since January 2020.
Note that, the COVID-19 themed domains reported by
these threat intelligence platforms are not necessary to be
5 ERC-20 and ERC-721 are both token standards in Ethereum. ERC is a set
of rules that the developers have to follow so they can implement a token in
the Ethereum blockchain ecosystem. It includes information about the protocol
specifications and the description of the contract.
6 Previous work suggested that typosquatting [65] and combosquatting [66]
attacks are prevalent in malicious domains.

malicious, as some of them were found via newly registered
domain feeds, which never served any malicious activities.
Thus, we further take advantage of VirusTotal [68], a widelyused online service that aggregates over 60 anti-virus engines,
to check whether the COVID-19 domains are malicious. At
last, we identify 101, 004 COVID-19 domains flagged as
malicious by at least one anti-virus engine on VirusTotal. For
the malicious domains, after excluding the domain parking
web pages, we use a heuristic approach to identify and
classify the cryptocurrency related scams. Since domains that
contain words like “crypto”, “bitcoin”, “invest”, “donation”
tend to carry out coronavirus-themed cryptocurrency scams,
we select such domains that contain keywords in their domain
names, as the scam candidates (over 150 domains found).
Then, we perform a manually inspection to determine whether
they are cryptocurrency scams. For example, if a malicious
domain claims that it will give high excess returns to the
investors (i.e., high-yield investment program), we will label
it as a Ponzi scheme. If a malicious domain camouflages
as reputable organizations to ask for donation, we will label
it as a donation scam. If a domain claims to reward users
based on the cryptocurrency that they transferred, we will
label the domain as a giveaway scam and further label its
corresponding blockchain address as a scam address. At last,
we have manually verified 7 Ponzi schemes, 2 donation scams,
and 2 giveaway scams in this way.
3) Malware. To identify the COVID-19 themed crytocurrency malware, we rely on two data sources. On one hand,
for the aforementioned 101, 004 COVID-19 domains flagged
as malicious, we use a premium API provided by ViusTotal
to get files related to these malicious domains, i.e., files that
communicate to these domains or files that are downloaded
from these domains. After this step, we have collected 7, 294
binaries and 2, 362 of them are flagged as malicious by
at least one engine on VirusTotal. On the other hand, we
use Koodous [69], a large Android app repository with over
62 million apps in total by the time of this work, to find
suspicious COVID-19 themed malware. Koodous contains
historical apps from various sources. In this work, we collect
the apps whose app names or package names contain COVID19 related keywords. In this way, 2, 378 apps are collected.
For all the collected binaries, we further use VirusTotal and
AVClass [70] for labelling their malware families. Note that,
not all the samples can be assigned families, as AVClass
needs a number of AV engines’ detection results to achieve an
agreement on family name. As we only consider COVID-19
themed ransomware and cryptomining malware in this work,
all the malware whose families are labelled “Ransomware”,
“Locker” or “Coinminer” are kept to the further research.
Thus, 4 COVID-19 ransomware and 5 COVID-19 cryptomining malware are identified. All of them were labelled by at
least 6 anti-virus engines, and 5 of them were flagged by at
least 30 anti-virus engines.
4) Scam Social Network Posts/Accounts. Social network
is one of the major channels for distributing and advertising
COVID-19 themed scams. Thus, we resort to Twitter and

Telegram to identify more scams. To be specific, we first
identify Tweets and Telegram discussions that contain both
the COVID-19 keywords and cryptocurrency keywords. Then,
we manually inspect their contents. For example, if we find a
Twitter account that imitates an official account of reputable
organizations to publish donation information, we will flag
it as a donation scam. If we identify Tweets that advertise
giveaway information, we will mark it as a giveaway scam. We
have analyzed all the related Tweets and Telegram discussions
from January 2020 to July 2020, and identified 30 donation
scams and 10 giveaway scams, which were distributed by 37
Twitter accounts and 3 Telegram accounts.
5) Scam Smart Contracts (DApps). Previous work [16],
[19] suggested that some DApps (smart contracts) are actually
Ponzi schemes. To verify whether the Ponzi DApps take
advantage of COVID-19, we resort to DAppTotal [71], a wellknown DApp explorer to find whether there are coronavirusthemed DApps. However, our keywords searching does not
find any DApps related to COVID-19.
Note that, as we cannot get unrevealed email scams from
public information, we did not identify any new scam emails
besides the reported ones. For all the detected scams, we
further analyze them using a semi-automated approach to
identify their correlated blockchain addresses (if available).
To be specific, we first use regular expressions7 to identify
blockchain address candidates, and then we manually verify
whether they are real addresses.
C. Dataset Overview
Table II shows the statistics of scams we collected. Overall,
we have identified 195 COVID-19 cryptocurrency scams,
including 91 token scams, 19 giveaway scams, 9 blackmails,
14 crypto malware, 9 Ponzi schemes and 53 donation scams.
These scams correspond to 91 COVID-19 tokens, 57 malicious
COVID-19 domains, 14 COVID-19 themed malware, and 47
social accounts on Twitter and Telegram. Besides, we have
identified 201 blockchain addresses correlated with them.
V. M EASUREMENT OF COVID-19 C RYPTO S CAMS
In this section, we analyze the overall trends of COVID19 crypto scams, investigate the tricks and social engineering
techniques used in scams, and further measure the impacts.
7 For

example, the regular expressions (bc1—[13])[a-zA-HJ-NP-Z0-9]25,39
is used to identify Bitcoin address.

A. The Trends of COVID-19 Cryptocurrency Scams
1) Distribution of Scams: The distribution of scams is
shown in Table III. Obviously, the token scams (46%) and
donation scams (27%) are dominant in the ecosystem. There
might be two reasons. First, cryptocurrencies are claimed to be
the Safe Haven Asset (compared with the fiat currency). Thus,
during the pandemic, attackers have the motivation to use
COVID-19 token scams to cheat inexperienced users. Second,
most people want to help fight the pandemic, so the scammers
take advantage of this opportunity to act as the official agencies
(e.g., WHO) to advertise a number of donation scams.
2) Overall Impacts of Scams: We further estimate the overall impacts of scams. It is non-trivial to estimate the impacts,
as we can only resort to the blockchain transactions related to
these scam addresses, which is a lower-bound estimation. We
have collected all the transaction records related to these scam
addresses till July 16th 2020. Since a few scam addresses have
been active for a long time before 2020, we only consider
the transactions related to these scam addresses since the
beginning of the pandemic (early 2020) when calculating the
overall financial losses of scams. Note that token scam is a
special case. Here, we only consider the holders who have
the corresponding COVID-19 trashy tokens. As there are 91
scam tokens, we estimate their prices based on the latest value
shown in exchanges. For the tokens we cannot get their latest
value from exchanges (which means that they have no trade
records on exchanges), we do not count their value. Thus,
our estimation is definitely a lower bound of the COVID-19
cryptocurrency scam ecosystem.
As shown in Table III (column 4 and column 5), the
overall number of financial losses is over 333K US dollars,
contributed by 6, 329 victims. Giveaway scam is the most
profitable category (over $287K), with over 500 victims were
scammed. Besides, at least $21K contributed by 103 victims
were received by donation scams, and the volume of token
scams is over $23K. We will further investigate each scam
category in the following subsections.
3) The Distribution of Scam Blockchain Addresses: Table IV shows the distribution of the 201 scam addresses8 . It
can be observed that, Bitcoin addresses dominate the scams
8 Note that we list token scams’ addresses separately, because these scams
are based on comprehensive designs like “Pump-and-dump” schemes and
these addresses can not be simply measured with transactions on addresses.

(40.3%), followed by Ethereum with 18 addresses. Among
these scam addresses, 138 of them have transactions in 2020.
The Evolution of Scam Addresses. We further analyze the
evolution of all the 151 scam addresses that ever have transaction records (including 13 addresses only received transactions
before 2020), as shown in Figure 9. It is interesting to see that,
there are 20 addresses in total that were active before 2020.
We manually analyzed the 20 addresses, and observed that 2 of
them were involved in known scams in 2018 and 2019, respectively. For the remaining 18 scam addresses, 17 of them were
COVID-19 donations scams. However, we did not identify any
obvious scam activities of them before this pandemic. Thus,
it is quite possible that they were ordinary addresses before,
which were then used in scams during COVID-19. Most of
the scam addresses (86.8%) are active after 2020. It is obvious
that, there is a sharp increase in March and April 2020, which
is inline with the time of the global outbreak of COVID19. Among these 131 addresses that are new emerging in
2020, the first address that succeeded in receiving crypocurrencies is 0x4e4f4153C6DA6c6df6ecA1f3BF367E5461Ad8F88,
which was a giveaway scam that extracted from a Telegram
account “Help covid19funds”. It received 0.1 ETH on 7th
February and has received 6.5 ETH (about $1518.7) in total.
The Distribution of Transactions. The distribution of the
scam addresses’ incoming transactions is shown in Figure 10.
For the amount of financial losses, most of them are small
transactions, i.e., over 90% of the transactions are below
1, 000 US dollars and 67.6% of the transactions are below
100 US dollars. The largest transaction happened on July
15th, when the address9 associated with the Twitter hack

cryptocurrencies. Some scam addresses were active before this pandemic.

event received 4.56 BTC (roughly 41, 642 US dollars). As
to the transaction time, first transaction to the scam address
happened on January 19th, 2020, and the donation scam
address 0x376624e29f8c52b0181bdd794c76fd1058963334 received 44.5 USDT. The Twitter hack campaign on July 15th
accounts for over half of incoming transactions in our dataset,
suggesting its great impact on the blockchain community.
The Most Profitable Addresses. On average, each active
scam address has received 13.3 transactions. The most active address bc1qxy2kgdygjrsqtzq2n0yrf2493p83kkfjhx0wlh
has received 321 transactions. We further analyze the distribution of money each scam address received, as shown
in Figure 11. It can be observed that over 61.7% of the
active addresses have received less than $1, 000 equivalent
cryptocurrencies. Table V shows the top-5 most profitable
addresses in our dataset. Notably, three of them belong to the
Twitter hack related addresses. The largest one has received
14.75 Bitcoins, which is equivalent to roughly $134, 781.2.
The Relationship among Scam Addresses. Furthermore,
we attempt to investigate relations among scam addresses, i.e.,
whether they are controlled by the same malicious campaigns.
For addresses that have ever received transactions on Bitcoin
and Ethereum, we analyze their relationship based on the
money flow, i.e., transactions from one address to another.
Figure 12 shows the relationship between scam addresses.
There are 3 types of addresses in the graph: 1) the labelled
scam addresses (we exclude silent scam address that have no
transaction records); 2) the victim addresses, which have ever
transferred money to scam addresses but did not receive money
from them; and 3) the fund transfer addresses, which are

served as the money laundering channels, i.e., receive money
from scam addresses and help the attackers transfer the money
they have scammed.
There are 56 scam addresses, 1, 741 victim addresses
and 600 fund transfer addresses shown on Figure 12.
On average, each BTC scam address is connected to
37.1 victim addresses and each ETH scam address is
connected to 6.5 victim addresses. Interestingly, some
scam addresses are clustered into the same group. Here,
we perform the connected component analysis. As long
as there are paths between two scam addresses, we will
cluster them together. Note that, we have excluded the

impacts introduced by exchange addresses, as different scam
addresses can exploit the same exchange address for money
laundering. As a result, 9 scam addresses are clustered
into 3 clusters. For example, the address cluster centred on
address bc1qwr30ddc04zqp878c0evdrqfx564mmf0dy2w39l
is the Twitter hack address group. They have connected
to 533 victim addresses and 38 transfer addresses. Most
of the money they received was finally transferred to
1Ai52Uw6usjhpcDrwSmkUvjuqLpcznUuyF, another scam
address in the group, and was then transferred to multiple
addresses for money laundering. We also find a new
scam campaign based the relationship of the addresses.
They are 182P8T7MM9assMo7V9YpqZ925yJX8HZurL and
1Gatesk17u25gLEk4JNYMDTg8WkCmLpn47, which are
connected by 2 fund transfer addresses. It is interesting to see
that they both carried out giveaway scams and used similar
domain names (gatesbtc.live and gatesmicrosoft.
tech) that impersonated as Bill Gates’ foundation.
B. COVID-19 Token Scam
1) The Evolution of Tokens: There are 91 COVID-19 scam
tokens in our dataset. The distribution of their creation time
is shown in Figure 13. After 2 test tokens created, the first
CoronaCoin10 was officially released on 4th February 2020,
and a large number of tokens are created after that. Notably,
when the coronavirus raised global concern in March, there
are 31 (34.1%) newly emerging tokens created.
2) Current Status of Tokens: The number of token’s holders
and transfers can reflect the activity of a token to a certain
extent. Figure 14 shows the current11 status of these tokens.
84.62% of the tokens have less than 60 transfers and 86.81%

of the tokens have less than 50 holders, indicating that most
scam tokens do not infect too many victims. Among them, 5
tokens have more than 200 holders (see Table VI). Note that,
the first 3 tokens have the same name ‘CoronaCoin’, we add
the suffix based on their online time to distinguish them.
3) Price and Volume: Among these tokens, several tokens
are listed on some decentralised cryptocurrency exchanges
(DEX), so that we can fetch the daily price and volume of
them. We choose the price and volume from Saturn Network
Exchange12 because most available tokens (16) are listed there.
Their daily average volume is shown on Figure 1613 . Figure 15
shows the daily closing price of top 3 tokens that have the most
average volume. The highest price 0.001 ETH of CoronaCoin
#1 occurred on Feb 11th, but considering its normal volume
that day, we believe it is just a single case that the transaction is
likely to be initiated by the founders of CoronaCoin #1. Their
sole purpose is to increase the price of this token. After that,
the price of CoronaCoin #1 rises due to increasing attention.
On March 4th, a developer of the founding team made an exit
scam by dumping all the tokens he had, which makes the price
decreased sharply. The CoronaCoin #2 and #3 both created as
forks of their former version because of exit scams, and that is
why the price curve of CoronaCoin #1 and #2 dropped rapidly
in late March and early April.
4) ICO Scam and Exit Scam: By manually investigation,
we found 7 out of the 91 scam tokens have behaviors like ICO
scam and exit scam. For the CoronaCoin #1, it has two evident
exit scams. One is on March 4th, when a developer dumped 5
million tokens from the developers’ wallet, which profited him
14.94 ETH ( $3, 490.6)14 . On March 30th, the lead developer

compromised the wallet15 that originally intended to donate
to the Red Cross, and he got 63.43 ETH (about $14, 819.8).
The rest of the team migrated the project to the CoronaCoin
#2, and shortly after that, the third dump happened where
the malicious actors16 got 10 ETH (about $2, 336.4). Similar Pump-and-dump scams are found in VaccinaCoin17 and
COVID19 token18 . There are two scam tokens involved in the
ICO scams, i.e., they either provide fake information or entice
users to buy the token using giveaway-like tricks. Luckily,
these ICO scams have not scammed many users yet. For the
Corona Virus Coin19 , it only tricked 1 victim successfully with
merely 2.6 dollar profit. Another one is CoronaAid20 , which
has not received money yet by the time of this study.
5) The Creators of Scam Tokens: We further analyze the
creators of scam tokens, as shown in Figure 17. Overall,
73 creators released 91 tokens. Over 81% (74) of the tokens are created by external addresses (i.e., by humans),
while the remaining tokens (17) are created automatically
(i.e., by smart contracts). We observe that, some creators (9
external addresses and 2 contract addresses) have released
more than one COVID-19 scam token. For example, the
address 0xec9005224daa378598aa0ea8f4c656d5a7c6de76 created 4 tokens. After creating 3 tokens that are less popular, this

hack address, which is not used until July 15th. Besides the
Twitter hack addresses, the most active address in Ethereum
is 0xd03dc334fb65cea1b83e654b26515e72694a713f, whose
attackers pretend to be Vitalik Buterin, a co-founder of
Ethereum. The attacker gets $1383.2 equivalent profit. It can
be observed that COVID-19 themed giveaway scams impersonating famous persons or organizations are more effective.

C. COVID-19 Giveaway Scam
In total, we find 19 giveaway scams, to which 5 domains and
10 social accounts are related. Among them, 14 of 21 extracted
addresses have succeeded in receiving cryptocurrencies in
2020. Table VII shows top-5 active addresses. The most popular address is bc1qxy2kgdygjrsqtzq2n0yrf2493p83kkfjhx0wlh,
21 Address:0x170467C28C4BF99f2D3840E730498F730a526Da2

address:

We have collected 9 addresses related to blackmails, all of
which are Bitcoin addresses. They are totally reported 23 times
on BitcoinAbuse by users. The profit they made is shown in
Table VIII. To our surprise, attackers do not make too much
profit through these tricks. The most profitable address has
received 0.023 BTC, which claims to sell products during the
pandemic. 6 of the scam addresses do not even receive any
money. It might because people’s awareness of such scams has
increased, while scaring people with virus by email is difficult
to cheat people.
E. COVID-19 Crypto Malware
As to COVID-19 themed crypto malware, we have identified
5 Android ransomware and 9 Windows malware binaries (4
labeled as Ransomware and 5 labeled as Coinminer). By manually investigation, we found 4 addresses in them (1 address
shared by 4 Android apps and 2 addresses embedded in 1
windows ransomware). Their profits are shown in Table IX.
The only address which made a profit is related to the domain
http://coronavirusapp.site and its distributed apps
are disguised as coronavirus tracker apps.
F. COVID-19 Ponzi Scheme
We find 9 websites that are suspicious to carry out Ponzi
schemes. For example, they claimed that they will invest in
vaccine of COVID-19 and make the investors get financial
freedom, as shown in Figure 18. Table XI lists the 9 websites.
We can see that, most of them contain the keyword “invest”
in their domain names, and the descriptions shown on their
websites indicate they are highly suspicious to be scams.
However, by the time of our study, none of them can function
well or they are just unreachable during our manually analysis.
Thus, we cannot get their scam blockchain addresses, so that
we cannot estimate their impacts and the number of victims.

G. COVID-19 Fake Crypto Donation
We have identified 76 blockchain donation scam addresses, which are related to 23 domains and 30 social accounts. Table X shows the top 5 most profitable addresses. The most profitable address 142pEjfSBh8cnvE7BMJXMjoSBedJWvRKAG received 1 BTC on
March 22nd. In total, 28 of 76 addresses have made a profit
of 21788.9 US dollars, which accounts for the third largest
scam category by profit in our dataset. Because of donation’s
close connection with this pandemic, such a serious condition
deserves our vigilance.
VI. D ISCUSSION
A. Implication
Our observations are of key importance to the stakeholders
in the blockchain ecosystem and the researchers who are
interested in COVID-19 themed cybersecurity. On one hand,
considering the prevalent COVID-19 themed crypto scams in
the wild and their great impacts, it is urgent for the community
to detect these scams and eliminate possible losses. On the
other hand, it suggests that the attackers are taking advantage
of this kind of public event to perform cyber-attacks. Although
the six types of scams studied in this paper follow the similar
behavior patterns as other non-Coronavirus scams suggested
in previous work, they have adopted a number of social engineering techniques to deceive users, and similar techniques
can be easily adopted to other social events or domains. Thus,
the governance of the cyberspace on social events should

be improved. For example, paying special attentions to the
newly released domains/tokens/social network accounts that
related to the public events can help us identify these scams
timely. Furthermore, identifying the distribution channels (e.g.,
Twitter, Telegram, and malicious domains, etc.) of these scams
can greatly reduce the impacts.
B. Limitation
Our study carries several limitations. First, the taxonomy of
scams might not be complete. As the taxonomy is summarized
based on public known scams reported by users in the wild, it
is quite possible that there are new tricks we did not identified.
Nevertheless, we believe we have covered most kinds of the
COVID-19 themed crypto scams. Second, as suggested in
Section V-A3, a few scam addresses were active before 2020.
Although we only count their transactions after the break of
COVID-19 (only 7 of them have transactions in 2020), it is
hard to differentiate how many of them are actually involved in
COVID-19 scams. Nevertheless, we found that most of them
have very few transactions before 2020, and there is usually a
quiet period till their rejuvenation in COVID-19. As a result,
we believe most of the revenue should be credited to COVID19. Furthermore, it is quite possible that one scam address can
be used to fulfill more than one type of scam activities, while
is hard to us to differentiate. At last, this work relies on some
manually efforts to identify the unrevealed scams, which might
not be scalable. Although we have tried our best to reduce
the efforts, i.e., by using VirusTotal to label the suspicious
scams first, and applying heuristics to mark COVID-19 related
scams, we admit that some advanced techniques (e.g., machine
learning techniques) can be implemented to identify and
classify the scams in the future. However, while the study is by
no means comprehensive, we are able to provide a lower bound
estimate of the prevalence and criminal profits associated with
these COVID-19 scams.
VII. C ONCLUSION
In this paper, we take the first step to characterize COVID19 themed cryptocurrency scams. We investigated six types
of cryptocurrency scams related to COVID-19 by collecting
existing scam reports and detecting the unrevealed ones.
Specifically, we revealed how the scams work, measured their
prevalence in the wild, studied their evolution and characterized their impacts. Besides, we released the labeled scam
dataset to the research community to help fight against the
COVID-19 attacks in cyberspace.
