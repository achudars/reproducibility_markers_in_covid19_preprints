Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic dramatically changed the way of living of billions of people in a very short time frame.
In this paper, we evaluate the impact on the Internet latency caused by the increased amount of human activities
that are carried out on-line. The study focuses on Italy, which experienced significant restrictions imposed by local
authorities, but results about Spain, France, Germany, Sweden, and the whole of Europe are also included. The
analysis of a large set of measurements shows that the impact on the network can be significant, especially in terms
of increased variability of latency. In Italy we observed that the standard deviation of the average additional delay –
the additional time with respect to the minimum delay of the paths in the region – during lockdown is ∼ 3 − 4 times
as much as the value before the pandemic. Similarly, in Italy, packet loss is ∼ 2 − 3 times as much as before the
pandemic. The impact is not negligible also for the other countries and for the whole of Europe, but with different
levels and distinct patterns.

1. Introduction
At the time of writing, the coronavirus disease
(COVID-19) pandemic is still ongoing and billions of
people are under some form of lockdown. The restrictions faced by citizens are more or less stringent,
depending on the resolutions adopted by the different
governments, but in many cases non-essential activities
have been shut down and a large fraction of people is
confined at their homes. Many activities that are normally carried out in physical presence are now taking
place on-line. As a consequence, the amount of traffic on the Internet increased significantly during the last
months.

In this paper, we analyze the impact of the COVID-19
pandemic on the latency of the Internet. Latency is one
of the major properties of the network and it is becoming every day more important, as several Internet applications are particularly sensitive to its fluctuations. Examples include on-line videogames [1, 2], video calls,
VOIP [3], and IP geolocation [4, 5, 6]. We analyzed
a large set of measurements, collected by means of the
RIPE Atlas platform [7], to better understand the effects
on the network caused by this major change in the way
we live.
The analysis focuses on Italy which, in April 2020,
has been under lockdown for more than a month, experiencing some of the strictest limitations enforced by
authorities: all schools, universities, and non-essential
shops are physically closed, and people are authorized
to leave their homes only for undeferrable necessities.
Distance learning and remote working were applied
whenever possible, with a significant increase in usage of virtual-meeting and video-conference applications [8, 9]. Table 1 summarizes the most important
events which could have had an impact on the Italian Internet latency. As can be noticed, limitations to citizens
May 2020

have been introduced progressively. For this reason, the
changes caused by the Italian lockdown are studied, in
the remaining of this paper, by comparing the situation
of the network in the February 11-17 week with the
March 10-16 week. The former represents the “normal”
status of the network, as it is antecedent to all restrictive
measures; the latter, on the contrary, comes just after the
most restrictive limitations. The period in between corresponds to a transitory phase, where partial lockdowns
start to impact the network performance. Hereafter, we
will use W1 to indicate the baseline week, and W2 for
the week just after the major lockdown event.
Besides Italy, we include a brief analysis also concerning Spain, France, Germany, Sweden, and the
whole of Europe. Spain, France, and Germany have
been characterized by restrictions similar to the Italian
ones. Sweden instead decided not to impose a mandatory national lockdown. For Spain, France, and Germany W2 is shifted according to their major lockdown
event (shown in Table 1). For the entire Europe the situation is more heterogeneous, as some countries were
less hit by COVID-19 and thus adopted milder restrictions. For Sweden and Europe, W2 corresponds to the
March 20-26 week, the last of our observation period
which goes, overall, from February 11 through March
26. Results show that the impact is not always the
same across the considered countries and on a European
scale.
The contribution of this paper can be summarized as
follows:

information also on packet loss and path changes,
as they are, more or less, related with Internet latency, and on HTTP-based latency.
• Besides Italy, results also concerning Spain,
France, Germany, Sweden, and the whole of Europe are included. Since measurements have been
collected using a single platform, results obtained
for the different countries can be compared without the possible bias introduced by the adoption of
multiple and heterogeneous systems.
Results show that, in Italy, lockdown impacted the
latency of the network, especially in terms of increased
variability. Effects are more evident during the evening,
suggesting that latency is more negatively affected by
the increased traffic due to recreational activities rather
than remote working or distance learning. For the other
European countries included in the study, the impact is
milder in Germany and France, and similar to the Italian
one in Spain and Sweden.
The remaining of the paper is organized as follows:
in Section 2, we summarize the most significant work
concerning the detection and analysis of large anomalies occurred in the Internet; Section 3 describes the
data collection phase; in Section 4, the method we followed to compute the performance indexes is explained;
the main characteristics of the datasets are illustrated
in Section 5, together with a preliminary analysis; Section 6 contains the results on the Italian Internet latency
from different perspectives (type of measurements, hour
of the day, IPv4 vs IPv6, etc), whereas Section 7 shows
the results concerning the above-mentioned countries
and the whole of Europe (with less details compared to
Italy); Section 8 concludes the paper.

• Some statistics have been recently released by Internet Service Providers (ISPs), and other players of the Internet ecosystem, about the increased
amount of traffic they have been exposed to because of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, a
picture that leaves aside the very specific points of
view of the single operators is still missing. This
study provides a more global view, not polarized
by the single operator’s perspective. In addition,
most of the statistics released by operators concern
the amount of traffic, with limited (or absence of)
information about latency.

2. Related work
There is an extensive body of literature about anomalies on the Internet. However, the focus is, usually, on
the design of techniques aimed at detecting the occurrence of an anomaly (for instance [10, 11, 12, 13]). In
this paper, we do not try to define another detection
technique, as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on
the network is evident. We strive to provide a view of
the effects of the pandemic at a large-scale, including
a quantitative evaluation of its main characteristics as
seen from the perspective of latency.
When natural events assume catastrophic proportions, their effects might be observed also on the performance and reliability of the Internet. During the last
20 years, several studies have focused on the impact on

• The amount of measurements analyzed is large,
thus providing solid foundations for the included
statistics. Moreover, besides the sheer number, we
decompose the impact on delay according to the
most relevant factors, including the time of the day,
the type of target (belonging to a content delivery
network or not), and the version of the Internet Protocol. In addition to ICMP-based delay, we provide

terdomain routing point of view, Aben shows that a significant portion of traffic was rerouted around the affected area, again demonstrating the Internet resilience
and the importance of a redundant structure [20]. Similar outages can be observed also at a smaller scale, as
pointed out in [21]. The study uses ping to show that
reachability issues can occur at residential hosts in case
of moderately bad weather conditions (e.g. thunderstorms). However, unlike large-scale outages, on the
small scale the degree of redundancy is generally not
sufficient to cope with these events.
The vast majority of the studies concerning the impact of natural events on the Internet found in scientific
literature tackle the problem from a reachability, routing, or traffic point of view. Very few analyzed the experienced latency increase in such events as we do for the
COVID-19 pandemic. However, we believe that studying latency is of paramount importance, as it can give
an indication of the perceived quality of service by end
users. In addition, none of the previously studied events
reached the size of the COVID-19 pandemic, in both
space and time. At the time of writing, the COVID19 pandemic has been impacting the lives of billions of
people all around the globe for several months, while in
the other analyzed natural events the impact of the Internet was limited in time or circumscribed to a relatively
small geographic area.
Since the COVID-19 pandemic has started only few
months ago, there is still little scientific literature focusing on its impact on the performance of the Internet.
However, several network operators, content providers,
and Internet eXchange Points (IXPs), released reports
about the increased usage of their infrastructure, which
we review in the following. Cloudfare reported statistics
about the traffic increase towards their servers placed
in Seattle, Northern Italy and South Korea [22]. In
particular, Cloudfare reports an increase of 30% of the

the Internet of a few catastrophic natural events, such
as earthquakes and hurricanes. In [14], authors studied
the effects of the Taiwan 2006 earthquake on the Asian
Internet, from the viewpoint of interdomain routing and
traffic in research and educational networks. The earthquake damaged submarine fiber cables causing the failure of multiple links and unavailability of several routes.
The paper shows that through automatic rerouting performed by the BGP protocol and traffic engineering via
backup or redundant paths, the connectivity could be
restored within a matter of hours, even if with some
loss of performance. Other studies reported more significant damage and instability for longer periods [15].
Cho et al. conducted a similar study on the Japan 2011
earthquake and subsequent tsunami in [16]. The study
analyzes the impact on the Internet as seen by a local
ISP, analyzing both traffic and routing. Due to link failures, the Internet experienced traffic drops and subsequent peaks mainly due to the reconfiguration of content distribution networks. However, thanks to planned
backup and redundancy, the Internet proved to be resilient to such an event, and was affected only locally
and with minimal damage. Another study analyzed the
latency variations due to the same event [17], as seen
from PingER monitors [18]. The study shows that, after the earthquake, latencies from some monitors experienced a significant increase for a limited amount of
time. These studies point out the importance of maintaining redundant Internet routes, even if at a cost, as
they can be extremely useful when disruptive events occur.
Similar work was conducted on the effects caused by
severe weather conditions, such as the 2012 hurricane
Sandy. In [19], authors used ping to test the reachability
of edge networks, to discover that the number of outages
in the areas affected by the hurricane Sandy significantly
increased during and after the hurricane. From the in3

overall traffic in Northern Italy and a reduction of the
traffic coming from fitness trackers perhaps reflecting
the scarce mobility induced by social distancing. Similarly, Fastly reported traffic and download speeds towards their servers [23]. Various countries were considered, including Italy, which had a 109.3% increase in
terms of traffic and a 35.4% decrease in terms of download speed on average. DE-CIX, one of the world’s
biggest IXPs, reported a new traffic world record of 9.1
Tbps [24], as well as a 50% increase in video conferencing traffic and 25% of social media traffic. Finally,
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) released a report that aggregates the
various traffic increase information reported by Internet
operators in a single document [25]. Such report highlights some important numbers, among which: (i) an
increase up to 60% of traffic reported in many IXPs and
ISPs; (ii) an increase up to 24 times higher of the volumes of traffic for video conferencing platforms.
All these reports focus on the increase of Internet traffic and not on latency. We believe that latency is extremely important as, without information about capacities, traffic itself cannot be used for an estimation of
the perceived performance of the Internet by end users.
Moreover, as already mentioned, all the currently available studies are limited to the boundaries of the organizations that provided them.
One of the few papers focusing on this topic, from a
scientific perspective, is the one by Favale et al. [26],
where the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is observed from the campus network of an Italian University. Favale et al. highlight a 10 time decrease in incoming traffic and an increase of 2.5 times in outgoing
traffic, as a consequence of remote learning activities.
Moreover, using passive measurements collected using
Tstat [27] and application logs, they studied the fruition
and performance of their in-house distance learning system.

In particular, a large set of devices called probes periodically perform measurements towards other devices
called anchors. Anchors are usually hosted in IXPs, in
the operation centers of ISPs, or in data centers. Hence,
they enable monitoring of the core infrastructure of the
Internet. The results produced by AMs have been extensively used for both research (see, for instance, [30],
[31], [32], [33], [34]) and operational purposes (for example DNSMON [35], a service aimed at monitoring
the worldwide core DNS infrastructure). Additionally,
RIPE Atlas allows its users to collect measurements towards arbitrary targets. Results of User-Defined Measurements (UDMs) are stored in a database from where
they are accessible to the public (access is not restricted
to the experimenters who triggered them).
RIPE Atlas, for its measurements, relies on classical network tools. The latency from an Atlas node to
a target is estimated by means of the ping tool which,
as known, makes use of ICMP echo requests and echo
replies. For AMs, ping is launched to collect three
Round Trip Time (RTT) values. For UDMs, the default
number of collected RTT values is again three, but this
number can also be changed by the experimenter.
Our analysis of the impact of COVID-19 pandemic
relies on the results generated by both AMs and UDMs.
3.1. AM-derived dataset
Starting from the dates of the events reported in Table 1, we considered all AMs comprised in the interval
from the 11th of February to the 26th of March 2020.
The set of probes and anchors involved in the measurements is stable, with little variations caused by the possible temporary unavailability of probes. Since AMs
are performed periodically and for the entire period of
study, they provide information on the Internet latency
from a stable point of view. However, to be sure to eliminate measurements occurring in a short time frame and
thus not covering appropriately the observation period,
we further filtered the selection to contain only the measurements concerning source-target pairs that produced
successful results in at least 40 different days (90% of
the total time frame).
The position of source and target nodes is fundamental to analyze the impact on a country-level basis. For
AMs, the position of both source and target nodes is
well-known, as such information is provided for each
node participating in the platform. We use such information to select a subset of the ping measurements having both source and target in Europe.
From now on we will refer to such a subset as
the AM-derived dataset (AMD). AMD is composed of

3. Collection of data
The raw latency data used for this study was collected by RIPE Atlas [7]. We then filtered and enriched such data as detailed in the following subsections. RIPE Atlas is a globally distributed Internet measurement platform that produces more than 10 000 measurements per second [28]. Among the open platforms
aimed at measuring the Internet, RIPE Atlas is the one
with the largest number of vantage points [29], and it
has a massive presence in Europe.
RIPE Atlas automatically carries out Anchoring Measurements (AMs), where the set of targets is pre-defined.

than 1 billion RTT values generated by 671 292 sourcetarget pairs during the observation time period.

3.2. UDM-derived dataset
Users of the RIPE Atlas platform can define their own
latency measurements according to their needs and interests. They can select the set of targets to be probed,
define the periodicity of probing, and set the time-span
of their measurement activities. In UDMs, targets frequently include the servers of major Internet companies,
DNS servers, or privately owned network resources. As
a consequence, the set of targets involved in UDMs is
heterogeneous. Sources are always a subset of RIPE
Atlas nodes, but the subset can be different from user to
user.
For our analysis, we are interested in a subset of
UDMs where measurement activities were possibly
scheduled before the COVID-19 outbreak in Europe and
repeated periodically throughout the observation period.
To obtain such a subset, we adopted the following strategies. First, we extracted only periodic latency measurements, i.e. configured to be automatically repeated after a certain amount of time. Second, we discarded
the measurements configured to collect less than three
latency values per ping execution. Third, similarly to
AMD, we filtered the selection to contain only the measurements concerning source-target pairs that produced
successful results in at least 40 different days. Fourth,
we restricted measurements to the ones targeting IP addresses in Europe. It is important to notice that in
UDMs only the location of the source nodes is wellknown, as it is provided by RIPE Atlas. Hence, for this
step, we estimated the position of the targets by using
RIPE IPmap [36]. RIPE IPmap uses active geolocation,
and it has been reported to be 100% accurate at continent level, 99.58% at country level [37], and 80.3%
at city level [38]. Additionally, we used MaxMind GeoLite2 [39] as a fallback tool, in case of failed IP geolocation with RIPE IPmap. Measurements where the
target was not successfully geolocated using these two
tools were discarded. Finally, in some cases, we had
to limit the amount of extracted information due to the
almost unmanageable volume of data in the repository.
In particular, when the number of targets in the geographic area of interest was too large, we randomly selected 10 000 targets and the analysis was restricted to
them. Even when we had to limit the number of targets,
the number of sources from which measurements were
started was not subject to any limitation.
From now on we will refer to the dataset built according to the above-described procedure as the UDMderived dataset (UDMD). UDMD is composed of more

4. Method

Let d be the delay of a given Internet path. It can
be roughly expressed as d = dtra + d pro + dque , where
dtra is the transmission delay, d pro is the propagation
delay, and dque is the time spent because of queues
and processing at intermediate routers and target host.
In a wide-area scenario like the one considered, d pro
amounts to a significant fraction of the overall delay,
as signals travel at approximately 200 km/ms in fiber.
Moreover, the only component that is going to be affected by increased traffic is dque . To isolate dque from
the other terms, the dtra + d pro component can be estimated as the minimum delay observed in a set of latency
measurements collected on a given path. The larger the
number of collected samples, the better the quality of
the estimate: intuitively, the collection of more samples increases the probability of finding lightly loaded
network conditions. This approach is not novel and it
has been followed in other studies to characterize latency variations on a large scale. In [40], for each hostpair the difference between the maximum and minimum
RTT observed in a time bin was calculated. Then, the
evolution of the obtained difference values was used to
investigate on transient congestion. The use of the minimum observed RTT as an approximation of the fixed
delay associated with a path was adopted also in [41],
to study the variability in TCP connections.
Delay variation metrics are discussed in RFC
5481 [42], where one of the most widely implemented
formulations is based on the use of the packet with the
minimum delay in the sample as the reference packet.
In particular, Packet Delay Variation is defined in RFC
5481 as the one-way delay of the considered packet minus the one-way delay of the packet with the lowest
value for delay over the current test interval. Using the
minimum delay as the basis for delay variation is the
preferred method also according to the ITU-T Y.1540
Recommendation [43] (albeit when considering 2-point
packet delays, i.e. one-way delays computed by means
of the absolute arrival time at destination minus the departure time at the source host).
Starting from the above considerations, we defined
the following method. Each source node, say a, measures the RTT towards a target, say b, using the ping
command at time t, which produces a list of delay val5

ues Dab
t = {RT T 1 , RT T 2 , ..., RT T n }. Let us also define

in that specific bucket and across all source-target pairs
located in the region of interest (e.g. all source-target
pairs in Italy); as a consequence, the value of r is generally greater than zero. To have rmin,k equal to zero, all
considered ab couples should experience, almost simultaneously, their best RTT (mab ) during the kth bucket,
which is unlikely. The smallest observed delay found
for a source-target pair (m) provides an indication of the
“uncompressible” component of the delay for such pair
and, as such, can be excluded in a study aimed at evaluating the impact of the pandemic.

5. Characterization of the dataset and preliminary
data analysis

where O is the entire period of observation. Since the
observation period we considered is relatively long, it is
possible that some path changes occurred, i.e. that the
set of traversed routers was not always the same. This is
not a problem, provided that some of the above concepts
are reformulated appropriately. In a scenario where path
changes occur, mab is an estimate of the transmission
and propagation delay of the best path between a and
b, among all the paths followed during the observation
period.
Then, we used m as a baseline to estimate the additional time experienced for every single pair of nodes.
In particular, we computed

In this section, we provide a picture of the datasets
in terms of geographical extension and overall RTT dynamics. Figure 1a shows the distribution of distances of
source-target pairs in Italy, for both AMD and UDMD.
In detail, the distances between hosts are computed as
Great Circle Distances (GCDs), i.e. the length of the
shortest path on the surface of the Earth. Actual distances travelled by packets are generally larger than the
corresponding GCDs because of circuitousness of Internet routes (deviations from shortest physical paths can
be significant [44]). Distances span a couple orders of
magnitude, from few kilometers, when source and target are in the same city or metropolitan region, to almost
one thousand kilometers. Figure 1b shows the distribution of distances of European source-target pairs limited
to 500 targets (but using all sources). For the European
data, we had to limit the number of source-target pairs,
because to compute the distance both source and target
have to be located at city level, and active geolocation
is expensive. For both Italian and European data, the
distances reported in Figures 1a and 1b are the ones for
which we have been able to compute the position of the
involved nodes at city level (approximately 83-98% of
the considered couples). We believe that the distributions shown in Figure 1 are reasonably close to the ones
of the complete datasets.
The distributions of minimum RTT value observed
for each source-target pair (i.e. m) located in Italy and
in the whole of Europe are shown in Figure 1c and 1d,
respectively. The wide range of values, from few milliseconds up to ∼ 40 ms in Italy, and up to ∼ 80 ms in
Europe, originates from the geographical extension of
the considered areas.
Figure 2a shows the raw RTT values collected in
Italy, AMs, before any processing. More in detail, the
scatterplot has been produced using just 1:1000 of the

values of qmin,t , qavg,t , and qmax,t of all source-target pairs
in the region of interest were then grouped in buckets
with a duration of 30 minutes and averaged. This last
step originates from our interest in evaluating the impact

at the country level. More formally, let us call rmin,k ,

values to make the image readable. The largest values tend to be slightly higher after lockdown events.
However, a trend does not clearly emerge from raw values, probably because of the large amount of values
and because they are related to paths with very different
lengths. The red curve that is also shown in Figure 2a is
the moving average of raw AMs values, computed using a window with a duration of five minutes. In this
case, increased variability can be observed in the righthand side of the figure because of lockdown. The period
of fluctuations suggests that daily activities may play a
role and for this reason they are further analyzed in Section 6.3. Figure 2b shows the absolute values, again
for the Italian AMs, but now grouped according to the
method defined in Section 4. The dmin values have been
grouped in buckets and averaged, similarly to rmin , but
without subtracting m. Let us call such values smin . The
curve is approximately the same shown in Figure 2a,
but with less spikes as the size of buckets is 30 minutes.
Figure 2c shows the same smin curve, but now together
with rmin . The scale is different to have a better view of
the phenomenon. The rmin curve is very similar to the
other one, but translated downwards, as now the m value
found for each pair is subtracted. Figure 2d shows the
95th percentile of qmin , again grouped in buckets of 30
minutes. It is thus computed similarly to smin , but now
using the 95th percentile instead of the average. Variability of delays is even more visible in this case.
We do not provide an analogous discussion about the
European dataset and/or UDMD for the sake of brevity.
In the remaining of this paper, we base the analysis
mostly on r, as we are interested in evaluating the impact of the pandemic on the variable component of latency (with the exception of Section 6.1 where we also
include s). The phenomenon is principally observed in
its evolution along the line of time, as we wish to understand if, and to what extent, the lockdown measures,

enforced in Italy and in the other considered European
countries, had an impact on the network.
6. Impact of lockdown on the Italian Internet
We studied the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on
the latency of the Italian Internet from different perspectives: when both source and target are located in Italy or
just one of the two, when considering the time of the day
and workweek/weekend, and when taking into account
the version of the Internet Protocol. We also studied
the observed latency when the target is part of a content provider network. Beside ICMP-based latency, an
evaluation of latency as seen at the HTTP level is provided. Finally, a subsection also shows the path changes
occurred at the AS-level as they can be related to the
phenomenon under observation.
6.1. Overall results
We start our analysis from the measurements in AMD
with both source and target in Italy. We first analyze the
values of s measured in Italy. We recall that s is the average of the d values in each bucket, as defined in Section 5. Figure 3a shows the evolution of smin , savg , and
smax for the whole observation period. We notice that all
values progressively increase over time. Since Italy experienced some partial lockdown events before the most
restrictive one, there is no step-like increase, rather a
continuous one. However, approximately from February 23, when schools were closed in Northern Italy, delays start to grow and higher peaks can be observed. The
largest increase can be observed on March 10, which
is the date of the complete Italian lockdown. The increase appears to be quite significant, for example if we
consider the smin line, the peaks during the lockdown
are approximately 30% higher than the ones before the
lockdown.

smin in W1 and W2. The average smin experiences a
7.6% increase in W2, and the smin standard deviation
experiences a 201.5% increase. The measurements in
UDMD show a similar pattern, but more accentuated,
as can be seen in Figure 3b. In fact, in W2, the average smin is 14.5% higher than in W1, and the smin standard deviation is 310.1% higher. It has to be noticed
that the s values in UDMD show a little drop around
March 10, which lasts some hours. We investigated
on this aspect, and found that one of the targets of the
measurements was unreachable in that interval. The target involved multiple source-target pairs, corresponding
to approximately 1/5 of the measurements, which usually were providing relatively high absolute delays. In
other words, this is an artifact due to a temporary lack of
measurements, which can happen when measuring real
world devices.
Similar patterns can be observed when analyzing the
evolution of rmin , ravg , and rmax for both AMD and
UDMD, which can be found in Figures 3c and 3d. In
this case however, the curves are translated downwards,
as expected. This reflects on the increment of the average rmin value in W2 with respect to W1, which is
27.7% in AMD and 66.8% in UDMD, but not on the increment of the rmin standard deviation value, which remains almost unchanged: 203.6% in AMD and 280.8%
in UDMD.
Similar considerations can be made about measurements with sources in Italy and targets spread all over
Europe (excluding Italy), as shown in Figures 4a and 4b
for AMD and UDMD respectively. Also in this case,
the generally increased variability during lockdown is
clearly visible.
When considering measurements with sources in
Europe and targets in Italy, as shown in Figures 4c
and 4d, the situation is a bit different between AMD and
UDMD. In particular, for AMD the pattern is approximately the same as in Figure 4a. For UDMD, instead,
the pattern is quite different. An increase of the overall
variability is still noticeable, however the three curves
appear to be much more squeezed on top of each other,
i.e. the rmin and rmax curves are much closer to each
other than in the other scenarios.
It is also worth to notice that, especially for AMD, the
local minima of the rmin curve tend to get higher during
the the transitory period but then they start to get lower.
This is particularly visible in Figures 3a and 3c. The
local minima (the troughs) correspond to night hours,
when the network is lightly loaded. This phenomenon
could be explained by the infrastructural enhancements
introduced by network operators to respond to the cri-

sis. For example, during the transition period, TIM (the
Italian incumbent) started peering again in public peering LANs of Italian IXPs for the first time since the end
of 2012 [45]. Also, IXPs reported an increase of traffic
of 30 - 40%, which pushed them to introduce upgrades
in the capacity of their peering LANs, as reported during the Italian Network Community Meeting held for
the occasion [46]. Such improvements could also justify the situation in Figures 4a and 4c, where the troughs
during the lockdown reach smaller values compared to
the one of the first analyzed week.

for AMD, and from 3.1e-3 to 9.4e-3 (+205.7%) for
UDMD. Also the standard deviation of the packet loss
rate in W2 increases significantly compared to W1:
from 1.8e-3 to 1.1e-2 for AMD (+507.2%), and from
5.6e-3 to 2.6e-2 for UDMD (+367.9%).
We notice that in AMD there is an increase of the
packet loss that lasts approximately 2 days, around
February 29 – March 1. We investigated this behaviour
and found that the increase is not attributable to a narrow subset of the source-target pairs. We did not register any disconnections of sources nor targets, and the
same packet loss pattern can be seen in measurements
directed to 74% of the targets, although with different
intensities. These targets are geographically spread all
over Italy. In particular there are two targets that contribute in a significant manner, which are located in
Milan (at the Milan Internet eXchange) and Monopoli
(Puglia region), respectively (we point out that measurements towards one target involve multiple source-target
pairs). The temporary increase of packet loss is not reflected in the r curve, as for the involved source-target
pairs the packets that are correctly delivered experience

6.2. Packet loss
We estimated the impact of the lockdown in terms
of packet loss, as the fraction of unsuccessful echo request/reply. Figure 5 shows the evolution of the packet
loss for the whole observation period, for both AMD
and UDMD. Both datasets show an increase of packet
loss over time, especially after the lockdown starts. This
is consistent with the previous results, and indicates a
generally increased congestion due to the lockdown. We
computed the average packet loss in W1 and W2. The
increase is significant: from 2.8e-3 to 5.9e-3 (+110.3%)

a negligible increase of the RTT.

To evaluate the influence of the day of the week, we
separated the Italian measurements in those run during
work days and those run during weekends for W1 and
W2. Results can be seen in Figure 6, which shows
the boxplot of rmin in W1 and W2 for work days and
weekends. In both W1 and W2 the weekend values are
slightly higher and show higher variability. In addition,

6.3. Circadian rhythms
The three curves shown in Figures 3 and 4 show repeated peaks and troughs. This is particularly evident
during lockdown, and suggests that latency gets more
influenced by weekly or circadian rhythms.

a significant increase can be observed in W2 compared
to W1.
To evaluate the influence of the time of the day on
latency, we divided Italian measurements in one-hour
slots and aggregated them when executed in the same
hour. Then, we calculated for each slot the ratio between the average r values collected during W1 and
during W2. Results are represented in Figure 7a for
AMD. It is clearly visible how the increase is not uniform across the time of the day. Night hours show no
considerable increase. This is not surprising, as human
activity is very limited at night, thus also the congestion of the Internet. Morning hours show some little increase. Afternoon hours show a more evident increase,
but the highest increase occurs between 16:00 UTC and
22:00 UTC, with a peak between 20:00 and 21:00 UTC.
This is interesting, as, combined with the results of
weekend highlighted in Figure 6, it suggests that remote
working and distance learning have some impact on the
Italian Internet latency, but the major effects can be attributed to leisure activities which typically occur in the
afternoon/evening and on weekends, such as gaming or
video streaming (the reader has to keep in mind that
Italy is UTC+1 in the analyzed period). This could be
due to the lack of other recreational activities during the
lockdown. To deepen on this aspect we computed the
empirical CDFs of the rmin values in peak and off-peak
hours for W1 and W2 (Figures 8a and 8b). For peak
hours, we considered the interval 16:00-23:00, for offpeak we considered the interval 00:00-08:00. We can

notice that in both peak and off peak hours the CDFs for
W1 and W2 are clearly separated, and the CDF for W2
shows the highest values. However, it is clearly visible
that while in off-peak hours the two CDFs are very similar, in peak hours the CDF for W2 shows a substantial
increase of the rmin values (note that the x axis scale in
the two figures is different).
In Section 6.1, we highlighted as in night hours the
values of rmin are particularly low during the lockdown,
and in particular in Figures 4a and 4c the local minima
during the lockdown seem lower than the ones before
the lockdown. To evaluate this effect we computed the
ratio between W1 and W2 for the two cases depicted
in the aforementioned figures. The results are shown
in Figures 7b and 7c, respectively. In both cases the
ratio goes slightly below one during night and morning hours. Especially surprising is Figure 7c where the

provider and were flowing through non national paths
(mainly via Germany, Switzerland, and Netherlands).
In correspondence of the observed drop, the measurements involving these source-target pairs start to flow
through local paths via other providers. These paths
show considerably smaller latencies. After few days,
the original configuration is restored.
We further studied the latency experienced between
20:00 UTC and 21:00 UTC (the peak hour previously
identified) by the two protocol versions. In particular,
we compared the values collected during W1 with the
values during W2. For IPv4, values of the rmin average
show a 121.7% increase in W2. For IPv6 instead, the
increase is more modest, 11.2%. Both show a similar
increase in variability in W2: 103.8% IPv4, and 128.1%
for IPv6.
To conclude, IPv6 in Italy is characterized by a generally higher variability than IPv4, but in peak hours the
former has been impacted less than the latter by stayat-home orders. This is not surprising, as IPv4 and IPv6
are generally served by different infrastructures, and follow different paths [47]. In addition, IPv6 is not as common as IPv4 in domestic connectivity, and this could
justify the minor impact of the lockdown on latencies
observed in IPv6 measurements.
The same analysis was not repeated using UDMD, as
the relatively limited amount of IPv6-based UDMs does
not allow us to produce statistically sound results.

the ratio goes below one for the entire morning. This
could happen as in Figure 7c we consider sources outside Italy, thus the access network is still not involved in
a lockdown phase, and targets in the Italian infrastructure, which as mentioned has been improved to cope
with the traffic increase. During night and morning
hours the load on the network is still light, so in this
particular configuration the performance could increase.
To conclude, in evening hours the increased Internet usage during lockdown generally produces larger delays,
but in periods of lighter load the network is sometimes
more efficient than before the lockdown.
6.4. IPv4 and IPv6
We further analyzed AMD taking into account the
version of the IP protocol. To perform a fair comparison we only selected measurements run by dual stack
probes (i.e., probes which have both IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity). This means that for both IPv4 and IPv6 we
consider measurements run between the same sources
and targets. We found 11.6 million IPv4 RTT values
and 9.8 million IPv6 RTT values with both source and
target in Italy. Figures 9a and 9b shows the three r variations for IPv4 and IPv6, respectively. IPv6 latency,
in Italy, seems to be characterized by larger variability
compared to IPv4 latency, independently from the lockdown period. Such variability increases even more during the lockdown period. However, for IPv6 a reduction
of minimum rmin values is particularly evident, probably
due to the network improvements introduced by operators. In particular, a significant drop around March 17
is visible. We investigated on this aspect and found that
a subset of measurements were initially originated by
source-target pairs which shared a common upstream

measurements targeting them. We only selected ICMP
ping measurements (which are not subject to HTTP or
application layer redirects). We found approximately 6
million RTT values towards 115 YouTube’s servers located in Italy.
Figure 10 shows the three r variations we obtained.
An increase of the overall latency and its variability is
visible during the days of the lockdown. The standard
deviation of rmin is approximately 86.9% higher in W2
with respect to W1. The average rmin instead increases
by 25.2%.
Our hypothesis that the increase of RTT registered
in the evening hours is due to people forced to stay
home and using the Internet for entertainment, is thus
strengthened by the results of the measurements towards
YouTube. Figure 11a shows measurements collected
between 05:00 UTC and 06:00 UTC while Figure 11b
shows measurements collected between 20:00 UTC and
21:00 UTC, for the entire observation period. Also in
this case, the rmin during night hours slightly improves
during the lockdown. The rmin in the evening gets moderately higher during the transitory period and abruptly
increases after the first day of complete lockdown.
We acknowledge that YouTube is not fully representative of all content providers networks, in fact our initial purpose was to collect measurements towards Facebook and Netflix as well. However, we did not find
in RIPE Atlas enough measurements towards Facebook
and Netflix servers to cover the whole observation interval and obtain statistically significant results.

tainment), we investigated the impact of the lockdown
on the latencies towards YouTube.
We collected measurements towards the YouTube
Content Delivery Networks (CDNs), which is used
to serve video content. YouTube operates elaborated
server selection strategies [48] which could lead to inaccurate results. To avoid this, we operated as follows: (i) We first mapped the names associated with
the ad-hoc YouTube CDNs (googlevideos.com and ggpht.com) to the IP addresses that are used to serve content in Italy. For this purpose, we used all the RIPE Atlas probes in Italy to run multiple DNS queries in order
to obtain the IP addresses associated with the YouTube
servers. (ii) After obtaining all the visible IP addresses
of the YouTube’s servers (413 addresses), we used the
anycast detection service offered by RIPE IPmap, which
uses active measurements from RIPE Atlas probes to
detect if an IP is anycast or not. (iii) Then, we used
again RIPE IPmap to geolocate the IP addresses of the
servers. The servers not in Italy were discarded. (iv) Finally, we used these IP addresses to extract RIPE Atlas

6.6. Path changes
To further improve our analysis, we looked for
anomalous patterns in the level of path changes between the sources and targets of our measurements. We

If an IP path includes series of wildcards (i.e., non responding hops), these are squashed into a single one.
Then, each IP is converted to the AS number originating
the prefix such IP belongs to. For this step we use the
longest-prefix matching on RIPE RIS data [52]. Some
addresses cannot be mapped to an AS because they are
not available in the RIPE RIS data (e.g. not announced
publicly), or, more frequently, they are part of the private address space (RFC1918) [53]. We discard such
unmappable addresses. This approach has been previously described by Hyun et al. [54]. More sophisticated
approaches are of difficult application due to the size of
our dataset. Moreover, our main interest is to quantitatively estimate the variation of the path changes over
time, and not to analyze the Internet AS-level topology.
We then divided the observation period in buckets of
one day each, and for each bucket we computed the fraction of source-target pairs that incurred in at least one
change of AS path in that bucket. Figure 12 shows the
fraction of path changes over time for AMD. The fraction of source-target pairs experiencing path changes
each day is rather uniform on all the observation period,
between 0.1 and 0.2, which means that each day just 1020% of source-target pairs experienced a change of AS
path. However, by comparing W1 and W2 from a numerical point of view, we found that the average fraction
of path changes per day is 17.9% higher in W2. Thus,
there seems to be a slight increase of the number of path
changes per day due to the impact of lockdown.

level, as such level is the one impacting the most on
the geography of the paths, while the IP level is subject to various known artifacts and intra-AS load balancing [49]. From RIPE Atlas, we collected ICMP
traceroute measurements to match the Italian sourcetarget pairs of our analysis. For AMD, this was rather
straightforward as, besides ICMP ping measurements,
AMs also include other types of measurements such
as ICMP traceroutes. For UDMD, instead, we could
not find enough traceroute measurements to match the
source-target pairs of the ping measurements, thus we
restricted our analysis to the AMD source-target pairs.
To extract the AS paths from the traceroute IP paths,
we use the following methodology: Initially, we match
all the IP addresses against the Internet Topology Data
Kit [50] produced by CAIDA. This step converts different IPs belonging to the same router to a single one.
Then, we remove the first IP hop inside the network
of the probe’s host, as it is usually fixed. This step allows us to avoid most of the artifacts introduced by the
ICMP rate limiting happening close to the probes [51].

6.7. HTTP
In the previous sections, we reported results obtained
via ping measurements based on ICMP echo requests.
This type of traffic is used for network diagnostics and
sometimes routers can treat it differently from traffic

end latency of the TCP connection increases. Besides
this anomaly, the overall increment is noticeable also by
comparing average and standard deviation values of r,
which are respectively 24.9% and 98.5% higher in W2
with respect to W1. In Figure 13b, the failure rate of
HTTP measurements is shown. Such failures are due to
a combination of network errors which include connection timeout, host unreachable and network unreachable
problems. Also in this case an increment of the failure
rate can be noticed as long as the Italian lockdown becomes more restrictive. These results allow us to confirm that the increased latency, in Italy, during lockdown
is not limited to network diagnostic traffic but also to
end user traffic.

generated by end users, even if they usually behave similarly in terms of RTT [55].
Even if the trends highlighted in the previous sections
by ICMP show an evident increase of the network congestion caused by the COVID-19 lockdown, we also analyze the latencies produced by RIPE Atlas HTTP Anchoring Measurements (based on TCP). These kinds of
measurements are quite different from the ICMP measurements which we analyzed above. In particular, each
HTTP measurement collects just one sample (instead of
at least three for the ICMP ping ones). In addition, the
latencies that can be extracted from these measurements
include the time for sending an HTTP request to a server
and waiting for the HTTP response body to arrive. This
time includes the time needed for the server to build the
response. The time needed for the DNS resolution of
the server address, instead, is not included. For this reason, it must be noted that the latencies extracted from
HTTP measurements are not directly comparable with
the latencies obtained by means of ICMP ping.
We analyzed the latencies extracted from HTTP measurements with the methodology described in Section 4,
however, being each measurement composed by just
one sample, we will not have dmin , davg , and dmax , but
just d, and therefore just q and r. Figure 13a shows
the results for measurements with source and target located in Italy. The figure shows an increase in the latency due to the lockdown. Like in the previous results, the increase is progressive and not step-like, as
we recall that Italy experienced multiple partial lockdowns before entering in the strictest one. A step-like
increase is noticeable in correspondence of the increase
of the packet loss showed in Section 6.2. In this case
the packet loss affects the performance of HTTP as, differently from ICMP, the packet loss triggers retransmissions of the TCP protocol. Consequently, the end-to-

7. Impact of COVID-19 pandemic in other European countries
In this section, we show how the latency in other European countries was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. We considered Spain, France, and Germany,
which had their major lockdown events respectively
five, seven, and twelve days after Italy. In addition,
we considered Sweden, as an example of a country that
adopted a less formal lockdown policy. Finally, we considered all European countries together. Overall results
are depicted in Figure 14. Table 2 reports the increment of the average and standard deviation of rmin and
packet loss after stay-at-home orders. To obtain the increment, for each country we compared the first week
of measurements (W1) and the first week of lockdown
(W2). For Germany, the considered periods are four day
long instead of seven: Germany was put on lockdown
at the end of our observation period and a full week
was not covered by the collected data. Since there is
not a unique date for lockdown in the whole of Europe,
15

and since some countries did not even enter a lockdown
phase, for Sweden and Europe we compared the first
and the last week of the observation period. The two
weeks used for comparison are highlighted in light grey
in Figure 14. In the following we analyze the considered
countries in detail.
Spain shows high variability of latencies also before
the lockdown. However, an increase due to enforced
restrictions is noticeable in AMD. Similarly, circadian
patterns become more evident (Figure 14a). This is confirmed also by the summary statistics, which show an increment of 37.4% of the rmin average, and of 110.8% of
the rmin standard deviation, in W2 compared to W1. The
visual analysis of UDMD shows a progressive increase
of latency which starts much earlier than the lockdown,
with a generally spread variability (Figure 14b). In fact,
results in Table 2 show a significant increment in the
average rmin of 63.2%, but a modest 19.3% for the standard deviation. On March 7, a temporary increase can
be observed in Figure 14b. We investigated this phenomenon and found that it is due to a considerable increase in the latency towards one target, observed from
multiple sources. We believe this to be an anomalous
behavior due to the target itself or the network in its
proximity. The analysis of the packet loss shows opposite behaviours between AMD and UDMD. In AMD,
the packet loss decreases during the lockdown, while in
UDMD increases greatly.
In France, the situation is different, as shown in Figures 14c and 14d, which show AMD- and UDMD-based
results respectively. In AMD, the overall increase of latency is barely noticeable. Lockdown seems to accentuate the periodic fluctuations due to circadian rhythms.
In fact, the summary statistics included in Table 2 show
even a decrement of rmin average and standard deviation in W2 compared to W1, in the AMD. However, it
must be noticed that the first week of measurements in
AMD appears as particularly noisy if compared to the
other pre-lockdown weeks. UDMD instead show much
higher variability, which is the attribute that shows the
most evident impact of the lockdown. In fact, the analysis shows an increment of just 0.5% for the rmin average and 49.6% for the standard deviation of rmin . The
packet loss increases during lockdown for both AMD
and UDMD, in both average and standard deviation.
In Germany the situation is different from both Spain
and France. In AMD, the effect of lockdown is noticeable only in terms of amplified circadian patterns (Figure 14e). The analysis confirms this, by showing just a
2.8% increase of the rmin average, and a 37.3% increase
of the rmin standard deviation. In UDMD, a more significant increase of latency is visible (Figure 14f), which

corresponds to a 34.1% higher value for the rmin average and a 88.7% higher value for the rmin standad deviation in W2 compared to W1. It is worth noticing that in
Germany the degradation of latency starts more than one
week before the lockdown. This happened because Germany, like Italy, proceeded to some partial lockdowns
and school closures before the major restrictions. The
average packet loss slightly increases for UDMD, and
decreases for AMD.
As mentioned, Sweden adopted less formal restrictions. For this reason, results shown in Figures 14g
and 14h are definitely interesting. Both AMD and
UDMD show a progressive increase of r and of its variability in the considered time period. This can mean
either that Swedish people autonomously increased social distancing and implemented stay-at-home policies
as suggested by the Swedish government, or that the
performance of the Swedish Internet infrastructure has
been affected by the lockdown imposed in other countries. Also the comparison of W1 and W2 show a significant increase of rmin average and standard deviation:
44.7% and 531.2% for AMD and 28.6% and 231.7% for
UDMD. The packet loss increases just for AMD, but decreases for UDMD.
Figure 14i and Figure 14j show respectively the
AMD- and UDMD-based results for all of Europe. Additional latency is generally smaller than the individual
countries we analyzed. The response to national lockdowns seems to be fairly good even if we notice an accentuation of the variability due to the circadian activities, starting from the Italian lockdown, but not a significant increase of the overall latencies. This is confirmed
by the statistics reported in Table 2: the rmin average is
subject to a modest increase, equal to 8.1% and 15.4%
in AMD and UDMD respectively, while the rmin standard deviation experiences a significant increase, equal
to 114.6% and 108.1%. These results seem to indicate
that, on a continent-level scale, the impact of lockdown
is still noticeable but without dramatic changes in observed performance. The packet loss instead decreases
for AMD and is almost unchanged for UDMD.
It is worth to notice that, after analyzing the packet
loss in the different countries, we cannot conclude that
an increase in latency is coupled with an increase in
packet loss. In fact, in some cases we found increasing latency and decreasing packet loss, and vice-versa.
8. Conclusion
It is well-known that computer viruses may cause
a slowdown of the Internet [56, 57]. In 2020 we all
learned that also biological viruses may affect the global

Internet performance, because of the changes they bring
in the way we live.
In this paper, we analyzed the impact of the COVID19 pandemic on the latency of the Internet on a large
scale. Latency is particularly important not only because it has a profound effect on some classes of applications, but also because it is, by itself, an excellent indicator of the health status of the network. Results, which have been obtained from the analysis of
a large amount of measurements, show that the impact
of the increased on-line activities is relevant, especially
in terms of higher variability. The major changes have
been observed in the evening, the time of the day when
most of the on-line activities are related to entertainment. This suggests that distance learning and remote
working contributed to a lesser extent in terms of additional network latency. Results obtained for the considered countries show relevant differences, which can be
due to the resilience levels of their network and/or to the
non-uniform restrictions imposed by authorities.
We believe that the provided numbers and the related
analysis, despite being limited to a portion of the Internet, definitely help in better understanding this previously unseen event in the history of the Internet.
