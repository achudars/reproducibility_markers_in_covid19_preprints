Abstract
With the rapid development of COVID-19
around the world, people are requested to
maintain “social distance” and “stay at home”.
In this scenario, extensive social interactions
transfer to cyberspace, especially on social
media platforms like Twitter and Sina Weibo.
People generate posts to share information, express opinions and seek help during the pandemic outbreak, and these kinds of data on
social media are valuable for studies to prevent COVID-19 transmissions, such as early
warning and outbreaks detection. Therefore,
in this paper, we release a novel and finegrained large-scale COVID-19 social media
dataset collected from Sina Weibo, named
Weibo-COV1 , contains more than 40 million
posts ranging from December 1, 2019 to April
30, 2020. Moreover, this dataset includes comprehensive information nuggets like post-level
information, interactive information, location
information, and repost network. We hope
this dataset can promote studies of COVID-19
from multiple perspectives and enable better
and rapid researches to suppress the spread of
this pandemic.

Introduction

At the beginning of this writing, COVID-19, an
infectious disease caused by a coronavirus discovered in December, 2019, which also known as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2), has caused 4,517,399 individuals
infected globally, with a death toll of 308,515 (Doctor, 2020). Under the circumstance, the physical
aspects of connection and human communication
outside the household among people are limited
considerably and mainly depend on digital devices
like mobile phones or laptop computers (AbdulMageed et al., 2020). Due to it, people keep staying
1

weibo-public-opinion-datasets

at home and spending more time on social media
communication, making social media a vital avenue for information sharing, opinions expression,
and help-seeking (Lopez et al., 2020). All that
makes social media platforms like Weibo, Twitter, Facebook and Youtube a more vital sources of
information during the pandemic.
In previous studies, social media was considered a valuable data source for research against
disease, like uncovering the dynamics of an emerging outbreak (Zhang and Centola, 2019), predicting
the flu activity, and disease surveillance (Jeremy
et al., 2009). For example, some studies facilitate better influenza surveillance, like early warning and outbreaks detection (Kostkova et al., 2014;
De Quincey and Kostkova, 2009), forecasting estimates of influenza activity (Santillana et al., 2015),
and predicting the actual number of infected cases
(Lampos and Cristianini, 2010; Szomszor et al.,
2010). Hence, it is necessary to retrieve the relevant
social media datasets and make it freely accessible
for researchers, for the sake of public goods and
facilitating the relevant studies of COVID-19.
In this paper, we release a novel large-scale
COVID-19 social media dataset from Sina Weibo
(akin to Twitter), one of the most popular Chinese
social media platforms in China. For convenience,
we named it Weibo-COV, which contains more
than 40 million posts from December 1, 2019 to
April 30, 2020. Specifically, unlike the traditional
API-based data collection methods, which limit
large-scale data access, in this study, we construct
a high-quality Weibo active user pool with 20 million active users from over 250 million users, then
collect all active users’ posts during that period,
followed by filtering COVID-19 related posts with
179 representative keywords. Moreover, the fields
of posts in the dataset are fine-grained, including
post-level information, interactive information, location information and repost network, etc. We

2.1

Collection Strategy

At present, given specified representative keywords
and a specified period, there are two kinds of methods for constructing Weibo post datasets: (1) Advanced searching API given by Weibo; (2) Traversing all Weibo users, collecting all their posts during
the specified period, and then filtering these posts
with specified keywords.
However, due to the limitation of the Weibo
search API, the first method limits keyword search
output to 50 pages (around 1000 posts), making it
difficult to build large-scale datasets. As for the second kinds of method, although we could build largescale datasets with almost no omissions, traversing
all billions of Weibo users requires a very long time
and massive bandwidth resources. Besides, a large
proportion of Weibo users are inactive who may
not post any posts in the specified period, and it
makes meaningless to traverse their homepages.
To overcome these limitations, we propose a
novel method to construct Weibo post datasets,
which can build large-scale datasets with high construction efficiency. Specifically, we first build and
dynamically maintain a high-quilty Weibo active
user pool (just a small part of all users), and then
we only traverse the home pages of these users and
collect all their posts with specified keywords in a
required period.
2.2

Weibo Active User Pool

As shown in Figure 1, based on initial seed users
and continuous expansion through social relationships, we first collect more than 250 million Weibo
users. Then we define that Weibo active users
should meet the following two requirements: (1)
The number of followers, fans and posts are all

more than 50; (2) The latest post is posted in 30
days. Therefore, we can build and dynamically
maintain a Weibo active user pool from all collected Weibo users. Finally, the constructed Weibo
active user pool contains 20 million users, accounting for 8% of the total number of Weibo users.
2.3

COVID-19 posts Collection

According to the collection strategies described in
Section 2.1, we set the period from 00:00 December 1, 2019 (GMT+8, the date of the first confirmed
infected case of COVID-19) to 23:59 April 30,
2020 (GMT+8). Following best practices of text
retrieval and content analysis (Chen et al., 2019;
Zhang et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020, 2019; Shen
et al., 2020; Lacy et al., 2015), we generate a list of
179 keywords related to COVID-19 through close
observation of Weibo posts every day from late
January to April, 2020. These keywords are comprehensive, covering related terms such as coronavirus and pneumonia, as well as specific locations
(e.g., “Wuhan”), drugs (e.g., “remdesivir”), preventive measures (e.g., “mask”), experts and doctors
(e.g., “Zhong Nanshan”), government policy (e.g,
“postpone the reopening of school”) and others (see

Figure 2: The daily distribution of Weibo-COV

Appendix.1 for the complete list).
As a result, based on 20 million Weibo active
user pool, we first collect a total of 692,792,816
posts posted by these users in the specified period. Subsequently, we filter these posts by 179
keywords, along with duplication by unique post
id. Finally, 40,893,953 posts are retained in our
dataset.
Besides, some points should be noted that: (1)
This COV-Weibo dataset can be retrieved with a
single full download from our released website after submitting a data use agreement (DUA). (2) All
the users’ identifiable information such as user id,
user name, post id, etc. have been converted into
an unrecognizable status and can not be traced to
protect the privacy of individual users, which is
consistent with the presence of personally identifiable information (PII). Also, it is conducted by the
terms-of-use of Weibo. (3) We declare the ownership of the source data to the corresponding Weibo
users because Weibo users created this kind of public UGC (User Generated Content), and we only
collect, organize and filter them. (4) Our Institutional Review Board (IRB) is under processing and
waiting to be signed.

Data Properties
The Inner Structure of the Dataset

As shown in Table 1, fields of posts in
the dataset are very rich, covering the
basic
information
( id,
crawl time,
content), interactive information (like num,
repost num, comment num), location information (geo info) and repost network
(origin weibo).
Therefore, various kind
of studies related to infectious diseases can be
conducted based on this dataset, such as the impact

on people’s daily life, the early characteristics
of the disease, and government anti-epidemic
policies.
3.2

Basic Statistic

As shown in Table 2, Weibo-COV contains a total
number of 40,893,953 posts. Among these posts,
there are 1,119,608 posts with geographic location
information (accounting for 2.7%) and 8,284,992
original posts (accounting for 20.26%).
3.3

Daily Distribution

The distribution of the number of posts by day is
shown in Figure 2. It can be noticed that from
December 1, 2019 to January 18, 2020, the number
of COVID-19 related posts is tiny (less than 10K)
and may include some noise data. Since January
19, 2020, the number of COVID-19 related posts
expanded rapidly and maintained at least 200,000
per day.
Note that the data on April 4, 2020, is particularly striking, and the number of posts on that
day exceeds 1.8 million. A reasonable explanation
could be that day was Chinese Tomb Sweeping
Festival, a national mourning was held for the compatriots who died in the epidemic, people posted
or reposted many mourning posts on Weibo on that
day, which drawn extensive attention and generated
a massive number of posts.
3.4

GEO Distribution

As shown in Figure 3, we plot the location distribution of posts with geoinformation on April 4,

Figure 3: Distribution of location information of posts on April 4, 2020

Figure 4: Word cloud of posts in four days and some words are translated in red

2020. It can be seen that the distribution of posts
is mainly in China. There is also a part of posts
distributed oversea, including major countries in
Asia, Europe, Australia and America. The possible reasons could be that with the development of
economic globalization, more and more Chinese
people go abroad for work/living, and more and
more foreigners start to use Weibo, promoting a
large proportion of oversea Weibo users.
Therefore, our dataset can provide insight into
the nationwide and global impact of the pandemic.

3.5

Word Cloud

We select four days of posts data at different stages
of the epidemic development and draw word clouds.
As shown in Figure 4 (a), in the early days, people even did not know the characteristics of the
virus and, however, the government began to take
preliminary actions (e.g., “unexplained pneumonia”
and “health committee”). Later, as shown in Figure 4 (b), people learned that the virus is a new
coronavirus and learned preventive methods and

medicines (e.g., “new coronavirus”, “N95 mask”
and “ShuangHuang Lian”). Then, as shown in Figure 4 (c), governments took strict isolation rules
and strove to prevent imported cases from abroad
(e.g., “isolated at home” and “overseas import”).
By the end of April, as shown in Figure 4 (d), the
virus has had many impacts on people’s lives. Fortunately, research on vaccines and medicines has
been ongoing and made significant progress (e.g.,
“Remdesivir”).
Therefore, this dataset runs through the whole
development stages of COVID-19, including impacts of the disease on all aspects of society.

Related Work

Several works have focused on creating social
media datasets for enabling COVID-19 research.
(Chen et al., 2020), (Lopez et al., 2020) and (AbdulMageed et al., 2020) have already released datasets
collected from Twitter. However, these datasets are
mainly in English, and posts generated by Chinese,
the epicentre of the early development of COVID19, also deserves close attention. Therefore, collecting the Weibo datasets are also valuable and
can provide additional supplements for researches.
Only one dataset proposed by (Gao et al., 2020)
includes posts from Weibo, but their method relies on Weibo advanced search API provided by
Weibo, which hinders them from collecting largescale posts as we mentioned above. Compared
with our dataset, the data size (less than 200K), the
time period (from January 20, 2020 to March 24,
2020), and the number of keywords (only four keywords) of this Weibo dataset seem much smaller
and narrow.

Conclusion

In this paper, we release Weibo-COV, a first largescale COVID-19 posts dataset from Weibo. The
dataset contains more than 40 million posts from
December 1, 2019 to April 30, 2020, with rich field
information. We hope this dataset could promote
and facilitate related studies on COVID-19.
