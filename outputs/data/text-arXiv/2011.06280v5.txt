Abstract
For a stochastic COVID-19 model with jump-diffusion, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the global
positive solution of the model. We also investigate some conditions for the extinction and persistence of the
disease. We calculate the threshold of the epidemic system which determines the extinction or permanence
of the disease at different intensities of the stochastic noises. This threshold is denoted by ξ that depends on
the white and jump noises. When the noise is large or small, our numerical findings show that the COVID19 vanishes from the people if ξ < 1; whereas control the epidemic diseases if ξ > 1. From this, we observe
that white noise and jump noise have a significant effect on the spread of COVID-19 infection. To illustrate
this phenomenon, we put some numerical simulations.
Keywords: Brownian motion, Lévy noise, stochastic COVID-19, extinction, persistence.

1. Introduction
Infectious diseases are the public enemy of human population and have brought great impact to mankind.
In the present time, the novel coronavirus is the major disease in the world. This new strain of coronavirus
is called COVID-19 or SARS-Cov2. COVID-19 has been declared as a global emergency on January, 2020,
and a pandemic on March, 2020 [1]. Since the first breakout of the pandemic, according to the data released
by World barometer [2], there are more than 52 million confirmed (from which 17 million are active) cases,
1.29 million deaths and 33.5 million recoveries from the disease.
Researchers are working around the clock to understand the nature of the disease deeply. Scientists are
also battling to produce a vaccine to this new virus.
Many scholars [3–7] studied the mathematical model of COVID-19 to describe the spread of the coronavirus.
Recently, Zhang et at. [8] investigated the stochastic COVID-19 mathematical model driven by Gaussian noise. The authors assumed that environmental fluctuations in the constant β, so that β −→ β + λ Ḃt

where the variables S t , It ,, and Rt represent the susceptible population, infectious population, and recovered
(removed) population, respectively. The parameters Λ, β, ν, γ and σ are all positive constant numbers, and
they represent the joining rate of population to susceptible class through birth or migration, rate at which the
susceptible tend to infected class, due to natural cause and from COVID-19, the recovery rate, and the rate
of health deterioration, respectively. Bt is standard Brownian motion defined on the complete probability
space (Ω, F , {Ft }t≥0 , P) and λ is intensity of the Gaussian noise.
In [8], the researches proved the existence and uniqueness of the non-negative solution of the system
(1), and they also showed the extinction and persistence of the disease. But they did not consider the jump
noise.
Since, epidemic models are inevitably under the impact of environmental perturbation, such as earthquakes, floods, SARS, influenza, and so on, the stochastic model (1) that does not take randomness can not
efficiently model these phenomena. The Lévy noise, which is more comprehensive, is a better candidate.
In this study, we are going to investigate the stochastic COVID-19 model with jump-diffusion. Here,
we consider that the environmental Gaussian and non-Gaussian noises are directly proportional to the state
variables S t , It , and Rt . Several scholars used this approach, for instance, we refer to [9] and references
therein. The system which we consider has the following form:

where S t− is the left limit of S t . The description of the parameters Λ, β, ν, γ and σ is the same as in model
(1). For j = 1, 2, 3, ǫ j (y) is a bounded function satisfying ǫ j (y) + 1 > 0 on the intervals |y| ≥ 1 or |y| < 1.
N(t, dy) is the independent Poisson random measure on R+ × R \ {0}, N̄(t, dy) is the compensated Poisson
random measure satisfying N̄(t, dy) = N(t, dy) − π(dy)dt, with π(.) is a δ-finite measure on a measurable
j
subset Y of (0, ∞) and π(Y) < ∞, [10, 11]. Bt are mutually independent standard Brownian motion and λ j
stand for the intensities of the Gaussian noise, [12]. To the best of our knowledge this model is not studied
before.
The goal of the present work is to make contributions to understand the dynamics of the novel disease
(COVID-19) epidemic models with both Gaussian and non-Gaussian noises.
The rest of the paper is constituted as follows. In Section 2, we recall some important notation and
lemma. In section 3, we discus about the dynamical behaviour of the deterministic COVID-19 model.
Section 4 has two subsections. The existence and uniqueness of the solution of the stochastic COVID-19
model (2) is given in subsection 4.1. In Subsection 4.2, by finding the value of the threshold, we show the
conditions for the extinction and persistence to COVID-19. The discussion and numerical experiments of
our work are given in Section 5.

where X = S t + It + Rt . For Λ = ν X. Eq. (5) shows X is the total constant population with initial value
X0 = S 0 + I0 + R0 . This equation has analytical solution
X=

Λ

ν

(6)

In fact, the initial values are non-negative, then we have S t ≥ 0, It ≥ 0, Rt ≥ 0, and limt→∞ X = Λν . That
shows that 0 < X ≤ Λν . This implies that Eq. (6) has a positivity property. Thus the deterministic COVID-19
model (4) is biologically meaningful and bounded in the domain

E is called disease-free equilibrium point. Because no infectious individuals in the population, that means
that I = 0 and R = 0. E 3 is known as endemic equilibrium point of the model (4).
From the expressions of I 1 and I 3 , noting that if

the deterministic system (4) has unique positive equilibrium E 1 and E 3 . From this the reproductive number
the system (4) is given by

Theorem 1. The deterministic system (4) has
(i) a unique stable ‘diseases-extinction’ (disease-free equilibrium) equilibrium point E j for j = 0, 1, 2, 3 if
ξ0 < 1. This indicates the extinction of the diseases.
(ii) a stable positive equilibrium E j for j = 0, 1, 2, 3 if ξ0 > 1 that shows the permanence of the disease.

4. Dynamics of the stochastic COVID-19 system
4.1. Existence and uniqueness of the solution
To study the dynamical behaviour of a biological dynamic, the main concern is to check whether the
solution of the system is unique global and positive. Here, when we say unique global solution, we mean
that no explosion in a given finite time. To have a unique global solution, the coefficients of the system
must satisfy the following two conditions: (i) local Lipschitz condition, (ii) linear growth condition; see
[10, 12]. However, the coefficients of stochastic COVID-19 model (2) do not satisfy the second condition
(linear growth condition), so the solution (S t , It , Rt ) of system (2) can be explode in a finite time t. The
following Theorem helps us to show that there is a unique positive solution (S t , It , Rt ) ∈ R3+ of COVID-19
system (2).
Theorem 2. For any given initial value (S 0 , I0 , R0 ) ∈ R3+ , there is a unique non-negative solution (S t , It , Rt ) ∈
R3+ of the model (2) for time t ≥ 0.
Proof 3. The differential equation (2) has a locally Lipschitz continuous coefficient, so the model has a
unique local solution (S t , It , Rt ) on t ∈ [0, te ) where te is the time for noise for explosion. In order to have a
global solution, we need to show that te = ∞ almost surly.
h Toido this, assume that k0 is very large positive
number (k0 > 0) so that the initial values (S 0 , I0 , R0 ) ∈ k10 , k0 . For every integer k ≥ k0 , the stopping time
is defined as:
τe = in f {t ∈ [0, te ) : min(S t , It , Rt ) ≤

1
, or max(S t , It , Rt ) ≥ k}
k0

As k goes to ∞, τk increases. Define limk→∞ τk = τ∞ with τ∞ ≤ τe . If we can prove that τ∞ = ∞ almost
surely, then τe = ∞. If this is false, then there are two positive constants T > 0 and δ ∈ (0, 1) such that
P{τ∞ ≤ T } > δ.
Thus there is k1 ≥ k0 that satisfies
P{τk ≤ T } ≥ δ,

k ≥ k1 .

Now , let us define a C 2 -function W: R3+ → R+ by

Since this paper is considering the epidemic dynamic systems, we are focused in prevail and persist of
the COVID-19 in a population.
4.2.1. Extinction of the disease
In this subsection, we give some conditions for extinction of COVID-19 in the stochastic of COVID-19
system (2). Since extinction of disease (epidemics) in small populations is the major challenges in population dynamics [17]. So it is important to study the extinction of COVID-19.

Before we state the theorem, we give the definition of ’persistence in mean’.
Definition 2. If limt→∞ < S >t > 0, limt→∞ < I >t > 0,
say system (2) is persistence in mean.

limt→∞ < R >t > 0, almost surely, then we can

Remark 3. From the above two Theorems 3 and 4, we can take the value ξ as the threshold of the system

Gaussian and jump noises have significant effect on the behaviour of the system (2).

5. Discussion and numerical experiments
This article discussed the stochastic COVID-19 epidemic model driven by both white noise as well as
Lévy noise. In Theorem 2 , we proved that the the model (2) has a unique non-negative solution. We also
investigated some conditions for the extinction and persistence in mean of the COVID-19 epidemic.
By using the Euler Maruyama (EM) method [19], we gave some numerical solution to illustrate the
extinction and persistence of the diseases in deterministic system and stochastic counterpart for comparison.
We also obtained and compared the basic reproduction numbers for the deterministic model as well as the
stochastic model. From the comparison, we observed that the basic reproduction number of the stochastic
COVID-19 model is much smaller than that of the deterministic COVID-19 model, that shows that the
stochastic approach is more realistic than deterministic. In other words, the jump noise and white noise can
change the behaviour of the model. The noises can force COVID-19 ( disease ) to go out to extinct.
Furthermore, we showed that the disease can go to extinct if ξ < 1. While the COVID-19 becomes
14

persistent for ξ > 1.; please see Theorems 3 and 4.
From the findings, we concluded that if ξ < 1, it is possible that the spread of the disease can be
controlled, but for ξ > 1, COVID-19 can be persistent. βνΛ ≥ ϕ2 implies that the Gaussian and non-Gaussian
noises are small.
In Figs. 2 and 3, we fixed the parameters S 0 = 70, I0 = 50, R0 = 20, Λ = 0.0072, β = 0.002, ν =
0.001, σ = 0.01, γ = 0.02, ǫ j (y) = 0.004, for j = 1, 2, 3, and Y = (0, ∞), π(Y) = 1. Here, the value
of reproductive number ξ0 is 1.0286, and ξ = 0.9349. Having these values, the solution (S t , It , Rt ) of the
system (2) satisfies the property in Theorem 3, i.e.,
!
Λ
1
ln It
≤β
1−
= −0.0015 < 0 a.s.
limt→∞
t
ν
ξ
Which shows the It can vanish as t goes to infinity. . This happens because of the Lévy noise effect. When
λ2 = 0.019 and ξ = 1.0093, the solution (S t , It , Rt ) of Model (2) satisfies the condition in Theorem 4. This
scenario means that
limt→∞ < S >t = 7.1025,
limt→∞ < I >t = 0.0346,
and
limt→∞ < R >t = 3.1460,

a.s.

This numerical experiment shows that the COVID-19 will prevail. Noting that, Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 only differ
by the value of λ2 . The relationship of the variables S t , It , and Rt is plotted in Figure 4.
The numerical solutions imply that reducing contact rate, washing hands, improving treatment rate, and
environmental sanitation are the most crucial activities to eradicate COVID-19 disease from the community.
