Abstract
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. It is similar to influenza
viruses and raises concerns through alarming levels of spread and severity resulting in an ongoing pandemic worldwide. Within
eight months (by August 2020), it infected 24.0 million persons worldwide and over 824 thousand have died. Drones or
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are very helpful in handling the COVID-19 pandemic. This work investigates the dronebased systems, COVID-19 pandemic situations, and proposes an architecture for handling pandemic situations in different
scenarios using real-time and simulation-based scenarios. The proposed architecture uses wearable sensors to record the
observations in Body Area Networks (BANs) in a push-pull data fetching mechanism. The proposed architecture is found to
be useful in remote and highly congested pandemic areas where either the wireless or Internet connectivity is a major issue or
chances of COVID-19 spreading are high. It collects and stores the substantial amount of data in a stipulated period and helps
to take appropriate action as and when required. In real-time drone-based healthcare system implementation for COVID-19
operations, it is observed that a large area can be covered for sanitization, thermal image collection, and patient identification
within a short period (2 KMs within 10 minutes approx.) through aerial route. In the simulation, the same statistics are observed
with an addition of collision-resistant strategies working successfully for indoor and outdoor healthcare operations. Further,
open challenges are identified and promising research directions are highlighted.

Introduction

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a transferable illness that has recently been identified [1]. This infection was
unfamiliar before the occurrence of the Wuhan chain in December 2019 and within eight months (by August
2020), over 24.0 million persons are infected and over 824,162 have died. COVID-19's most commonly
recognized symptoms are fever, tiredness, and dry cough and some of the people suffered from throbbing pain,
nasal clog, runny nose, sore throat, or diarrhea [2]. The old people with medical conditions such as hypertension,
heart issues, or diabetes are enduring with illness; individuals with fever, cough, and trouble breathing should
seek immediate medical care. This virus spreads between people during close contact, i.e. at a minimum distance
of one meter (3 feet), through small beads during hacking, sniffling, or talking [2]. These beads are delivered
during exhalation, usually falling to the ground or to the surface instead of being contaminations over long
distances [3]. The virus can survive upto 72 hours on most surfaces. Recommended protective measures include
hand washing, closing the mouth while hacking, keeping away from others, observing, and self-isolating of
persons associated with being infected [2]. This led to usage of transportation restrictions, isolations, lockdowns,
stay at occupational risk assessments and the closures of facilities. Coronavirus (CoVs) has evolved as a significant
global virus since 2002 in different forms affected thousands of people in multiple countries [3].
Drone-based COVID-19 health and respiratory monitoring platforms creation is being explored by the
Australian Department of Defence for health monitoring and detection of infectious and respiratory conditions
including monitoring temperatures, heart and respiratory rates, amongst crowds, workforces, airlines, cruise ships,

potential at-risk groups, i.e., seniors in care facilities, convention centres, border crossings or critical infrastructure
facilities. [4]. ‘Drone’ a term usually used for an air vehicle that flies like other aviation craft (airplane/pilot) but
with a difference of pilot. Traditional aircraft are timely operated by pilots (Autopilot mode is no distinct), this is
what makes drone different. Under condition when an unmanned aerial vehicle is in aerospace, it is termed as
“Platform”. When external hardware or embedded systems are implemented to it is termed as “Payload”.
Attaching payload to platform results in a drone that can be used in various applications with increased efficiency
and accuracy. In [4][5], it is found that drones are widely used in the present COVID-19 pandemic. It is used for
monitoring, vigilance, thermal scanning, medication, food supply, alter system etc. In their use, data collection
centralization and analysis is a major challenge. The features of present drone-based systems can further be
enhanced by integrating the features of measuring social distancing, COVID-19 monitoring, and data collection
using artificial intelligence (AI), thermal imaging, sanitization with data analytics, record keeping etc.
Understanding the necessity and requirements of drone-based system enhancements for the smart healthcare
system, the main objectives of this work are:
 To propose collision-free zone-based single and multi-layered drones movement strategies.
 To propose an artificial intelligence-based system that collects the data through drones, analyze and provides
the necessary security measures.
 To propose a multi-layered architecture that collects the information from drones and exchanges with edge,
fog and cloud servers for necessary computing, data sharing, and analytics.
 To simulate the drone-based system for COVID-19 operations such as monitoring, control, thermal imaging,
sanitization, social distancing, medication, data analytics, and statistics generation for the control room.
 To implement a real-time drone-based system for sanitization, monitoring, vigilance, face recognition, thermal
scanning etc. in COVID-19 hotspots.
 To design and display the statistics of the drone-based smart healthcare system in a control room.
This work starts with reviewing the necessity to design, develop, simulate, and implement a drone-based
healthcare system for COVID-19 scenario. In consideration of existing drone-based systems and their features, a
drone-based system suitable for COVID-19 or other influenza viruses’ pandemic situation is proposed. The
proposed approach integrates artificial intelligence processes for data collection, analysis, statistical visualization,
sharing, and decision-making. In this work, both simulation and real-time implementation are carried out for
COVID-19 operations (sanitization, medication, monitoring, thermal imaging, etc.). In the real-time drone-based
implementation, a drone is designed, developed and tested for COVID-19 operations in the Delhi/NCR, India with
the approval of government authorities. In the simulation, multiple drone scenarios are considered for COVID-19
operations. Further, multiple drones collision-resistant strategies and their COVID-19 operation in outdoor and
indoor activities are proposed and experimented for evaluations. We observed that the drone-based approach can
cover a wide area in a short duration and it is an effective approach in pandemic situations and indoor patient
statistics.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the start-of-the-art over drone-based systems,
COVID-19, drone-based movement tracking systems, and usage of drone-based systems in healthcare. Section 3
presents the proposed drone-based architecture for the smart healthcare system using artificial intelligence
processes, fog, edge, and cloud computing services. Section 4 presents the collision avoidance algorithms used in
drones’ network. Section 5 presents the real-time drone-based evaluation scenario along with a simulation
approach for proposed drone-based system for various COVID-19 operations. Finally, the paper is concluded in
Section 6 along with presenting open challenges and promising new research directions.

Related Work

Extending the use of a drone from mission-centric, science, or defense sector to social health is of critical
importance especially for dealing with COVID-19 epidemic facing the world. This work supports the argument
that drones have influenced health quality and relief measures in real life at a significant level. People are living
in unprecedented times where the almost whole world has been affected by COVID-19. Worldwide, doctors and
medical professionals are working hard to help diagnose patients, nation leaders are suggesting to maintain social
distancing, police and health caring units are inspecting areas trying to sensitize the public along with many other
measures being taken at all levels [35]. Drones are proving to be of great assistance in all these areas at varying
levels. Countries are considering drones to be of great use through various measures [4]-[6]. Few scenarios where
drones have effectively escorted society with health supplements are briefly explained as follows.
 In Australia, a drone flight across cities detects if someone has a “doubtful” respiratory pattern or not [4]. Sensors

measurements are taken in different areas, especially in overcrowded areas. Here, a network of the camera is
used for monitoring and medication, and it is found to be effective and useful as well. The designed technology
for epidemic and disaster control is saving lives, helping people working in critical infrastructure, and
deployment of this technology over a large domain is in progress.
 China is practicing surveillance with more than 100 drones (The MicroMultiCopter company) over many cities
[7]. This measure is considered to be useful to prevent viral transmission by alarming people if the inter-personal
distance between individuals becomes less than a “specific” value or if people are walking in public places
without a mask (similar practices were also followed in Spain, Kuwait, and UAE) [7]. The majority of the
countries are supporting the drone-based approach for sanitization, monitoring, thermal scanning, governance,
vigilance etc. because it provides a safe way to help humanity.
 Sanitization is regulated in China by spraying disinfectant over mass (Terra drone) [5]. In this experimentation,
medicine delivery in fixed areas, sanitization, monitoring, and analysis is performed. This approach is tested
with at least 1000 patients and effective in a real-time environment. The proposed approach is found to be more
effective in rural areas where resources are scarce especially medical supplies. Further, the drone-based system
helps in teaching the people how to wear mass and stop spreading the virus. Lastly, the potential patients are
identified, counted, and analyzed using thermal images and measuring the body temperatures. Thus, the
proposed approach is found to be very effective in smart healthcare systems.
 In the United States, a personal medical kit for COVID-19 is being delivered by UAVs to remote locations [7].
Like the other drone-based systems, this system is found to be effective in delivering medical and other
necessary supplies. In the US, it is found to be effective in rural areas where corona symptoms are found in
patients. Likewise, it is recommended that the use of this technology should be increased to a large scale to
overcome the situations and help humanity in every aspect that we can do for saving the lives, providing them
with their necessities, and establishing healthy communication with everyone in all aspects.
 In India, states like Delhi, Kerala, and Assam are making announcements during surveillance across cities via
drones. Maharashtra is a step ahead as it has generated data analysis reports of the area being covered via drones
[8] [9]. In overall observations, government authorities in India have given special permissions to their
bureaucrats and police officials to use drone-based technology for vigilance, monitoring, medication,
sanitization, data analysis, reporting, and future decision-makings. Here, top officials in the government and
senior ranked officials are monitoring and taking control over COVID-19 hotspot positions through various
means. Drone-based systems are made an advance to handle individual patients or thermal scanning a large area
in short as well. Further, they are used for delivering medicines, food supplies, and other necessary equipment
weighing a few kilograms. Thousands of drones are deployed in each state of India for similar actions with
government permissions and it is observed that the success rate these drone-based systems and networks is very
high.

for smart healthcare or mission-oriented systems. This approach can be realized from COVID-19 pandemic
situations as well. Various challenges and requirements in establishing drone-based smart healthcare design,

network and routing, (iv) multi-layered drone flying, collision detection and resistance strategies, (v) solar-based
environment-friendly in-air drone-charging system, (vi) testing of the drone-based system in pandemic situations
(such as COVID-19) can be performed for various operations like monitoring, vigilance, sanitization, medication,

A Drone-based Architecture for Smart Healthcare System

This section proposes a drone-based architecture for the smart healthcare system. In this architecture, Artificial
Intelligence trends are integrated as shown in Fig. 1. This integration includes machine learning, and deep learning
for data analysis, Internet of Things (IoT) [36], Industrial IoT (IIoT), Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), and
Internet of Drones (IoD) for data collection or instruction-based services. AI is applied to design, develop, and
make internal processes more efficient. Thereafter, cloud, fog, and edge computing approaches are applied for
efficient data storage and processing starting from nearby locations to a distant secure position. Likewise, other
technological aspects including commuter movement, profiling, monitoring etc. are recovered, observed, and
analyzed for pandemic spreading.

Figure 1: Architecture for Drone-based COVID-19 Monitoring, Control, and Analytics in Smart Healthcare
System
Fig. 1 shows the proposed architecture for drone-based COVID-19 monitoring, control, and analytics in a smart
healthcare system. In this architecture, there are six systems, which are discussed below:
 Thermal Imaging System: An alternative to sensor deployment-based test data collection, drone-based
cameras can capture the person images and can be useful in social distancing measurements and density-based
thermal imaging. Using this system, the camera scanner detects the object and signal for the thermal image display.
If the image is not clear for thermal display then it is made clear through detection and unit system.
 Wearable Sensor System: In this architecture, it is assumed that sensors are deployed in the observational
area. The deployment of the sensor includes wearable sensors, or movement detection sensors at the ground near
to target monitoring/serving areas. This helps construct an IoT network using sensors, increase the scale of
interconnection and construct IIoT, or IoMT. All these deployments help in collecting the required data, data
analysis, and generating statistics. The wearable sensors, movement detection sensors, image processing etc. can
be used to monitor the COVID-19 pandemics. Fig. 2 shows a drone-based person monitoring system using
wearable sensors. A person under observation is monitored continuously through wearable sensors. Drones placed
closer to the population for collecting the patient’s data from wearable sensors or thermal imaging receive and
store data in drone memory. The stored data is forwarded to big data storage through multiple servers. These
servers use edge, fog, and cloud computing for processing, modeling, profiling, and analyze the data. The analyzed
and refined data is shared with hospitals with the proper policies and procedures, controlled and governed by the
medical board and the federal government. This way, it would be much convenient for both the federal government
and hospital to pre-plan the resources in emergency cases. Patient data is securely transferred to the doctor/hospital
as and when required. This proposal is found to be very handy to tackle pandemic situations such as COVID-19.
In pandemic situations, when data such as time and location of collecting data, population size, person’s profiling,
methods of collecting data etc. is available then it would be much convenient for everyone to govern the activities
and events. This way, it would be much convenient to identify the zero COVID-19 patient and the chain of the
pandemic. The integration of wearable sensors and drones are considered in IoT. An IIoT is formulated when
multiple stakeholders (e.g. hospital, drug, and equipment supplier, government, medical board etc.) are involved.
Further, IoMT is considered to interconnect the medical equipment, drug, patient, and doctor system for clinical
trial data fetching and storage. Similar or different clinical trials data is helpful for analysis and advancements.

Figure 2: Drone-based Person Monitoring System using Wearable-Sensor Data
 Edge Network and Computing System: This system applies edge computing for data modeling and initial
decision-making. Edge computing does not fetch all drone data. The drone does the self-processing and keeps the
data discrete. Edge computing saves time and resources while maintaining the data collection, pre-processing, and
analysis in real-time. Thus, edge computing is helpful to drones in making quick real-time decisions. Those initial
level decisions are helpful for drones that need instructions and operate within a stipulated time. Here, the major
challenge for edge computing is to balance the performance in handling drone-system and fog computing tasks.
In the proposed system, edge computing system sometimes needs to make the decision locally and other times it
has to send the data to fog servers for further detailed processing. The cost of transferring data to fog servers
increases with an increase in the scalability of sensors, IoT, and drone networks. Large data would require
resources and intelligence. Here, edge computing shreds its load by performing data aggregation at the initial level
and transfer the necessary data to fog or cloud networks as and when required.
 Fog Network and Computing System: This system adds fog computing services in the architecture for
commuter profiling, monitoring, and decision-making processes executed in the initial phase. Thereafter, data
analytics helps in smart and intelligent commuter trajectory profiling, monitoring, and decision-making. In the
system, multiple drones collect person’s information that differs in attributes. This way of collecting the data is
much convenient to make a person’s profile. Likewise, a COVID person’s profile helps in tracking the COVID19 cases’ chain.
 Cloud Network and Computing System: This system applies application-level services for activities such
as pattern recognition, monitoring, decision making, and large-scale sanitization are created. High-end cloud
computing resources offer capabilities for comprehensive analytics and decision making compared to the other
layers.
 Drone-System: Drone-based healthcare system is having various advantages over CCTV-based monitoring
including (i) it can cover those areas which are hidden in CCTV footage, (ii) drones are multipurpose, it can be
used for medicine delivery, sanitization, thermal imaging, scanning, etc., and (iii) drones can monitor the patient
from a close position as compared to CCTV. Medical sensors attached to a drone (such as accelerometers,
biosensors, MEMS etc.) can measure the patient conditions more closely and accurately compared to CCTV, and
(iv) loud noise is not there in every type of drone. There are quite drones (like DJI Mavic Pro Platinum, Parrot
Mambo, and DJI Phantom 3 Pro) designs that are more beneficial for indoor hospital systems. In the proposed
system, one or more drones move-around and push/pull the required information/instructions from sensors as and
when required. The data is processed initially at the drone for initial instructions. Thereafter, it is shared with other
systems for further detailed processing. The internet of drones is constituted for longer data transfer and analysis.
This internet of drones avoids collisions through either Radar / LiDAR systems or collision avoidance strategies.
Apart from Radar/optical systems, collision avoidance strategies are required if a large number of drones are used
for different services. Each of these services governs their strategy for drone movement. Using collision avoidance
strategies, a pre-planned drone movement strategies could be implemented and short-distance based collisions
could further be avoided with Radar/Optical systems.
 COVID-19 Monitoring & Control Room System: In this system, drones and area under observations, and
their associated statistics are observed. This system helps in monitoring COVID-19 hotspots remotely and plan
for necessary actions. Further, individual drone’s performance and movement can also be measured and
controlled.
 Information Capturing, Processing and Security Flow: The proposed drone-based smart healthcare system
aims to capture the person’s information using drones and then transmit it to the hospital remotely. However, there
are data processing, security, and privacy concerns that need to be addressed for successful
implementation/considerations. Fig. 3 shows the drone-based information capturing, processing, and security
flow in the proposed smart healthcare system. The COVID-19 operation starts with data processing and protection

COVID-19 operations after an agreement. A team of IRS used a drone system for data collection. The IRS and
Local drone data collectors operate the drone and collect the data using a secure tunnel. This secure tunnel uses
end-to-end data encryption (using Lightbridge application) for data sharing. Lightbridge application in the drone
system ensures that only authenticated devices receive the data. In Lightbridge application, multiple drones in
distributed architecture can receive the data in a secure tunnel. Local drone data collector uses cryptographic
primitives and protocols for secure data storage. The collected data is shared with the government-appointed
medical board either using manual data sharing or automated data sharing process. In the manual data sharing
process, a government official collects the data. Whereas, automated data sharing uses end-to-end secure data
sharing tunnel. Hospitals collect the data from the government’s system using end-to-end secure data sharing
tunnel.

Algorithms and Operational Strategies

AI-based drones capture raw data from IoT networks and can turn them into useful and actionable outcomes. Our
approach helps in multiple-drones to collaborate, share, and process the data and trace the pandemic. AI-powered
drones are useful in gathering pandemic ground intelligence, assess the COVID-19 virus spreading, thermal
imaging for pinpoint, and diagnose issues. All these COVID-19 operation statistics can be efficiently computed
if data is collected systemically. Thus, a geographical area is divided into multiple zones for drone-based COVID19 operations as shown in Fig. 4. Here, square zones of 𝜏 distance are formed and each zone is planned to have
an area that can be covered by a single drone. Algorithm 1 shows the drone’s federated learning process before
sharing its training data with an edge, fog, or cloud network computing. Thus, each drone can monitor its zone
based on individual experiences. However, an average value of observations from all zones is collected at the
edge computing side for collective decision. Algorithm 1 suggested applying the patient monitoring, thermal
scanning, and image identification followed by the patient’s body temperature measurement. The scalability of
applying a unique solution to drones increases as the decision process moves from edge computing towards cloud
computing. In the drone-system (shown in Fig. 1), sensor and IoT-enabled infrastructure can be monitored by
drones, and the movements of drones are important to observe for collision avoidance. Thus, the zone-based
approach does not allow any collision. In every zone, there is a collision feasibility area. If any drones move to
the collision feasibility area then it will send a signal (through LiDAR/RADAR/beam systems) to all neighboring
drones for collision avoidance. Now, if any drone wants to transfer its zones due to various reasons such as highbattery drone requirement, longer operation time drone requirement, malfunctioning of certain drones, specialized
drones requirement, rotation of drone shifts etc. then zone transfer algorithms with artificial intelligence
components based experiences can be applied. The zone-transfer strategies are divided into single or multi-layered
algorithms. These algorithms are explained in the following sections.

4.1 Single Layer Zone-Transfer Algorithms
This section presents three zone-transfer algorithms: fixed-area transfer, zigzag transfer, and parallel movements
and zone-transfer. Fig. 5 proposes a single-layered fixed-zone transfer strategy. In this proposed approach, drones
are allowed to change or exchange their zones using a zone transfer area. This area is pre-planned to have a storage
of at least one drone. The exchange is allowed if both the transfer zones (left to right and right to left) linking each
other is empty. The details of the proposed single-layered zone transfer strategy are explained in algorithm 2. Fig.
6 shows the simulation of the single-layered zone transfer strategy (in execution). For example, if one drone is
present in each zone-1 and zone-3, and they want to exchange their positions then zones transfer areas marked
with arrows help them to swap the position without collision.

Goal: To transfer or exchange the drones from one zone to another zone without any collision with a fixed

Fig. 7 shows the zigzag movement and zone-transfer strategy. Here, drones enter the area through an entry zone
and follow a zigzag strategy for transferring the zone. Algorithm 3 explains this strategy in detail. Additionally,
algorithm 4 helps in identifying any drone’s current zone by passing the index value. This index value could be
mapped to (latitude, longitude) value as well. Further, the collision feasibility zone (as shown in Figure 4) in each
zone will avoid small distance collisions. Fig. 8 shows a single-layer drone movement strategy where multiple
drones can enter the area through multiple and parallel zone’s entry points. Algorithm 5 explains this strategy in

4.2 Multi-Layer Zone-Transfer Algorithms
This section presents two multi-layered zone-transfer algorithms: two-layer zone transfer and hybrid zonetransfer. Fig. 9 shows a two-layered drone transfer strategy. Here, two-layers are proposed to have different dronebased COVID-19 activities (at different layers). The top-layer is considered as a zone-transfer layer and the bottom
layer is considered as the COVID-19 operation layer. Now, transfer from one layer to another layer for collision
avoidance happens through movements from the operation layer (layer-2) to the zone-transfer layer (layer-1). For
example, drones present in the zone-2 and zone-4 want to swap their positions. Thus, zone-2 and zone 4 drones
will move from layer-2 to layer-1. Thereafter, zone-3 drone from layer-1 will move to zone-2 of layer-2, and zone1 drone from layer-1 will move to zone-4 of layer-2. This approach can be extended to multiple layers for different
COVID-19 or other services’ operations/activities and/or working on uneven building structures. Every second
layer in the multi-layered architecture is considered as zone-transfer layer. Algorithm 6 explains the multi-layer
drone transfer strategy in detail. Fig. 10 and Fig. 11 show the simulation of the two-layered drone-based approach
in 2D and 3D views respectively (in execution).

Fig. 12 shows the multi-layer hybrid movement’s strategy. In this strategy, the drones’ movement area is
divided into multiple layers as per the existing infrastructure and possibilities of divisions. Thereafter, different
zone movement and transfer strategies could be applied for different operations. For example, four levels with
four areas are shown in Fig. 12. Area-2 at level-2 and area-4 at level-4 can use two-layered drone-movement and
zone transfer strategy for COVID-19 operations. Whereas, area 3 at level-3 can use a parallel drone movement
strategy for passing by drones. Similarly, area-1 at level-1 can use zig-zag drones’ movement strategy for product
delivery.

4.3 Social-Distancing Algorithms
This section shows two different approaches to maintain social distancing in COVID-19 operation. This system
helps in generating alerts/alarms through drones when social-distance is not maintained in an observational area.
Algorithm 7 proposed an approach that ensures the symmetric distance between any two persons standing in a
queue. Algorithm 8 proposed an approach that ensures the symmetric distance between any two persons when the
population is randomly distributed in a geographical region. Algorithm 7 and Algorithm 8 uses the following four
functions of COVID-19 social distancing.
 Max_Person_Calculation(): This function measures the number of people allowed in a geographical area. If
the number of people is greater than a certain threshold then it intimates the people through a wearable sensor
or speaker based alert generation system for spreading out.
 Distance_Measurement(): This function calculates the distance between two persons using various distance
measurement formulas. Initially, the distance is recommended to be measured using acoustic, acoustic, laser,
radio, infrared or mono/stereo distance sensors but if none of these choices are available then it measures the
distance from longitude and latitude measurements. For example, tunnel-based distance measurements are
preferred only for those cases when the distance between two persons is very long. In COVID-19 cases, tunnelbased distance formula can be used for data analytics in two different places and then comparing the results.
 Person_Intimation(): This function uses the intimation system to people through wearable sensors or alert
generation based system.
 Control_Room_Notification(): this function is used to measure the functionalities of an individual drone as
well as the drone-based network. Further, this function measures the COVID-19 social distancing and hotspot
identification as well.

and intimate through a wearable device, if necessary.

Performance Evaluation

This section discusses real-time and simulation-based realization of proposed system architecture incorporating
algorithms. It presents these evaluation cases adopted for COVID-19 scanning, sanitization, monitoring, analysis,
and statistics for the control room.

5.1 Case 1: Drone-based Real-Time System for COVID-19
We present a real-time drone system for COVID-19 developed by the Indian Robotics Solution (IRS). It is used
for sanitizing, monitoring, and controlling COVID-19 pandemic in Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR)
of India.
 Thermal Corona Combat Drone (TCCD): This system is deployed in-practice for object identification and
thermal scanning over many areas in Delhi and NCR, and found it as a suitable help to fight against COVID-19.
This is real-time implementation. Table 3 shows the complete specifications and features of the build and used a
TCCD system [6].

 Working of TCCD: TCCD takes off vertically from the ground and no explicit launching pad is required. First,
the team finalizes the area to be surveyed (densely populated areas usually) and takes clearances from relevant
government authorities. When the drone is at a suitable height inside a society (suburban area), it makes
announcements requesting the residents to come out on their balconies. Once the people are standing in their
balconies then thermal scanning begins for one person at a time where the body temperature is recorded. Thermal
scanning can be done of a person within 20 feet range. If the recorded temperature of any person is greater by at
least 2oC than normal body temperature, an alarm beeps and an announcement is made over the loudspeaker fitted
on the drone. To take an action the person having higher temperature may come down otherwise an official from
the outreach team may go up for more check-ups. A high temperature is one of the common symptoms of
coronavirus and temperature screening is used at many international borders and hospitals for initial symptomatic
detection [3]. This temperature measurement is followed by the healthcare system where other COVID-19
symptoms including nausea, headaches, fatigue, loss of taste or smell etc. are identified. Further,
immunodiagnostic tests are performed for confirming COVID-19. This multipurpose UAV facilitates society by
sanitizing the entire area via built-in spray functionality and providing medical supplies (if required). Two cameras
help in thermal image sensing and a video recording of the survey site even in the night using night vision mode.
Thermal image sensor recording and video of live scanning are visible on a connected portable digital assistant
like a mobile phone or phablet.

 Outcomes: Testing of TCCD has been completed in more than 15 densely populated areas (mostly slum areas)
where the roads are not good and reachability is an issue for the officials. Around 1 million people live in these
areas (Delhi, India), which include Keshav Puram, Narela, Sadar Bazaar, Slum areas of Civil Lines, Majnu ka
Tila, Paschim Vihar, and Dwarka. A sample of the scanned images, which can be seen on the PDA device, is
shown in Fig. 13. Fig. 13(a) and Fig. 13(b) show the temperature reading measurement over a PDA device from
a long and short distance respectively. Fig. 13(c) shows the drone designed and used for COVID-19 operations.
Fig. 13(d) shows the thermal image-based surface scanning. Scanning and sanitization of these areas has been
done in just 7 days. It is observed that an area of 2 km radius can be sanitized within 10 minutes. Thereafter, IRS
teams scaled-up this experimentation to a large area with proposed artificial intelligence and fast image
processing. Further, the experimentation is enhanced by using electrostatic spray. The electrostatic spray helps
droplets of sanitizer to be more centric and overlapping thus making it more effective and avoids wastage.

Case 2: Drone-based Simulation for COVID-19 Operations (Monitoring, Sanitising, and
Thermal Imaging ) in Outdoor Slum or Overused Areas

We have developed a simulation-based drone system for COVID-19 using AnyLogic [31] and JaamSim
Simulators [32]. In this simulation, multimedia modeling, agent-based modeling, discrete event modeling, and
system dynamics are applied over an area variation of 250m2 to 1000m2. Fig. 14 shows the drone-based simulation
when people are living or moving in close locations like in slum areas. The chances of sharing toilets, bathrooms,
water supply, and other public resources are very high. Thus, this increases the chances of COVID-19 pandemic
as well. To avoid spreading of COVID-19 cases, regular monitoring and sanitization are required. Fig. 14 shows
the side view of the area where drones are used for sanitizing the space. Here, two drones are shown that can move
freely and sanitize the area with instructions. Fig. 15 shows the drone-based thermal image of people's movement
monitoring and image processing. Here, people's movements are monitored and density-based analysis is
performed with the help of proposed multi-layered architecture. The high-density movement area needs frequent
sanitization as compared to low-density movement area. Fig. 15 shows the single-day observations and severity
of experimentation increases with the darkness of the red color. This indicates that sanitization is required at those
places. Fig. 16 shows the circuit used for simulating drone-based COVID-19 operations. Various components of
this circuit are briefly explained as follows.
 pedSource: ensures (i) significant passengers travel, and (ii) passengers increase with services and type of
services.
 pedGoTo: ensures randomness and free-pedestrian movements.
 pedWait: ensures (i) significant and random stay-time, and (ii) social-distancing.
 pedSink: ensures smooth pedestrian removal.

Case 3: Drone-based Simulation for COVID-19 Operations in Indoor Monitoring

Fig. 18 shows the experimentation for drone-based simulation for inspecting indoor COVID-19 patients. This is
a simulation-based study of indoor COVID-19 operations. In an indoor activity, nano or low altitude drones are
preferred because of their various advantages [29] [30]. Fig. 18 shows the hospital’s internal building and multiple
patient wards for admission. This drone’s camera is programmed for inspecting the patients based on their
movements and density. It is assumed that irrespective of drone-based special sanitization service, the wards are
sanitized (manually) after regular intervals or after patient discharge. Thus, drone-based sanitization is made
mandatory in those areas where the movement of people/patients is higher.

Drone’s camera used for COVID-19 operations shows that the accuracy of the proposed simulation is higher (93%
approx.). Fig. 19 shows the simulation’s thermal image of density-based areas that need sanitization. An increase
in darkness of red color indicates urgent sanitization.

Case 4: Drone-based Simulation for Social Distancing

This section presents the drone-based simulation of social distancing experiments. In the experiments, Algorithm
7 is used for ensuring symmetric distance between two persons. Algorithm 7 computes the number of persons
standing in a geographical area in its initial calculations. If the number of people standing in an area is more than
the acceptable limit then an alert is generated to reduce the count or stop the services. Thereafter, a distance
measurement process starts. Now, distance can be measured in multiple ways and through different formulas. Fig.
20 shows the application of the proposed approach in simulation. Fig. 20 (a) shows a road where people are free
to move through the front-view camera. In this view, three drones are shown to monitor the movement of people.
Fig. 20(b) shows social distancing in practice and the queue formation process. Here, people have made a queue
and they are served for their necessity as well. This queue ensures that if certain people are not following the
social distance rules then they will not be served and they have to go back to the queue-end for their turns. Fig.
20(c) is the circuit diagram designed and programmed for social distancing simulations. Various components of
this diagram are explained as follows.
 pedSource: This generates the number of pedestrians for experimentation from a pre-defined and fixed-line.
The pedestrians are free to move randomly and in any direction in the pre-defined area. However, everyone
has to follow the queue and social distancing otherwise they have to go back at the start of the queue and
follows the current position.
 atFareGates: As the number of pedestrians increases with time but space does not allow to move above a
fixed number of passengers. Thus, a crowd is generated at the entry gates. To avoid the pandemics, all people
are alerted to go back or follow the social distancing here as well.
 pedGoTo: specifies the number of pedestrians that are moving from the entry gate to service point. This
component does not allow multiple people to serve at a time. However, the services resumed only if all are
following the social distancing experiment.
 pedService: This component ensures that each person following the social distancing experiment is served
through a queue. The serving and time duration is fixed and pre-defined.
 pedSink: This component removes the pedestrians from observational space after they are served and at the
position of the exit gates.

exponentially. Results show that around 3389 persons can be checked in 55 minutes with 3 drones. Similarly,
13398, 16298, and 19697 persons can be checked in 55 minutes with 10, 20 and 30 drones respectively. Further,

distance checking when the maximum number of working parallel medicine supply units=20, and the maximum
time taken to supply a medicine= 120 seconds.

Room
Fig. 23 and fig. 24 show the results that can be displayed in the control room in addition to the statistics shown in
other cases. These statistics are simulated using AnyLogic simulator. Fig. 23 shows the variations in drones used
over the number of simulation days in the sanitization process. This statistic is variable and it varies with
simulation. However, Fig. 23 shows a static view of statistics between 0 to 600 days. Here, it is observed that 120
to 356 drones (cumulative) are used for the sanitization process. The cumulative drone number over the simulation
time (in days) shows the drone usage variations. In this experimentation, the same drone is counted twice if it is
re-used for sanitization. Fig. 24 shows the percentage of drone utilization. Results show that the percentage of
drone utilization varies from 0% to 80% approximately. These statistics are variable as well and it varies with

simulation. Fig. 24 shows the results for 30-drones. These statistics can be helpful to control room officials for
analyzing the drone situation and instructions could be passed accordingly. If the utilization is higher than the
chance of drone to deplete its battery, at a much faster rate, is higher as well. Thus, the minimum utilized drones
can be used for subsequent operations.

Assumptions: It is assumed that the maximum time taken to send a signal to the drone is 10 seconds. Here,
triangular distribution (compared to a normal distribution) is used for setting the signal time variation in the
simulation model because distribution is expected to be skewed with completion of the area under observation at
the minimum, maximum and modal values.
Outcomes & Discussions: This sub-section explains the various parameters used for performance
measurement. These are explained as follows.
Ground to Drones Signal Transmission Time Analysis: Fig. 26 shows the variations in signal transmission time
from a ground transmitter to the drone’s receiver. This variation is observed for an infinite period. Fig. 26 shows
the variations for the past one hour (0 to 3600 seconds). Here, “-“ sign is an indication of past time only. Results
show that signal duration varies from 0 (minimum) to 9 seconds (maximum). Mean and standard deviation values
of time variation are found to be 4.1 seconds and 3.7 seconds for 10 hours.

Figure 26: Ground to Drones Signal Transmission Time Analysis
Number of Drones Used: Fig. 27 shows the number of drones used over simulation time. In the proposed
simulation model, it is observed that a minimum of 25 and a maximum of 55 drones are used at a time. This usage
includes drones while operating inside the zone, filling the sanitizer, flying with no operation, and landing
operations.

Conclusions and Future Directions

This paper proposed a UAV-based smart healthcare system for COVID-19 monitoring, sanitization, social
distancing, data analysis, and statistics generation for the control room. Our framework gathers data by either
through wearable sensors, movement sensors deployed in the targeted areas, or through thermal image processing.
The data is processed through a multilayered architecture for analysis and decision-making. In multilayered
architecture, edge computing controls the proposed drones' collision-resistant strategies. Whereas, fog and cloud
computing techniques build commuters and patient profiles before making decisions. The proposed approach is
demonstrated with implementation and simulation. In an implementation, it is observed that a large distance can
be covered within a short period and the proposed drone-based healthcare system is effective for COVID-19
operations in Delhi/NCR regions. In the simulation, the proposed approach is tested for indoor and outdoor
activities. Results show that a distance of 1200 kilometers can be covered in 2293 to 18900 minutes with a

variation of 3 to 30 drones. In an indoor activity, thermal image-based patient identification is found to be very
effective for COVID-19 pandemic.
The simulation studies (Case-2 to Case-6) in the proposed drone-based smart healthcare system have limitations
such as it considers the movement of drones in an ideal scenario. In the real-scenario, environmental conditions
affects its movement and can change the statistics of its usage. Further, it is assumed that the drone used for indoor
imaging and sanitization is compatible with its operations. In the real-scenario, a compact-drone is required for
similar operations. Thus, compact-drone design aspects should be considered to analyze the real-facts.

6.1 Open Challenges and Future Directions
Although the proposed drone-based networked system and methods facilitate in combating COVID-19, it can be
further enhanced in a large scope keeping the following aspects into consideration.

Large scale medicine delivery: In recent times, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine is delivered using
drone-based system to fight against COVID-19. The COVID-19 medicines are under trial. In the future,
the feasibility of large-scale medicine delivery with different collision-resistant strategies can be explored
keeping infrastructure constraints in consideration.
Residents’ records and scanning: Resident record is another important parameter to ensure that every
person living in an area is scanned. Although resident welfare association keeps the records of every
resident but many people live outside resident societies as well. Thus, it is important to keep the record
of everyone and match with scanned population. This way, we can ensure that there are no resident with
initial symptoms of COVID-19.
Scanning services in case of lack of medical infrastructure: It has been observed that many doctors were
reluctant to handle patients when COVID-19 pandemic started. This is because of lack of medicine
facilities, patient behaviours, and long distance travel to provide services. In such cases, non-medical
person capable of flying drones to facilitate COVID-19 scanning or medicine supply can help and speed
up the scanning and testing processes.
Normal (Manual) vs drone-based thermal scanning statistics: The comparative analysis of manual vs
drone-based thermal scanning is required to show the importance of both types of systems in medical
system. For example, normal (manual) system is preferred if all medical facilities (including personal
protection equipment, a surgical gown, gloves, respiratory protection, eye protection, face shield etc.) are
timely available. It has been observed that drone-based system is preferred in case of scarcity of medical
facilities (like at initial stages of COVID-19 pandemic).
Large deployment of mini-drones for indoor operations: We have used drones to perform thermal
scanning in both real-time and simulation-based experimentations. In both cases, residential areas are
considered for scanning. Here, drones are used to scan people in both high-rise buildings and pedestrians
in real-time experimentation. Simulation considered the scanning of pedestrians only. However, multiple
mini-drones flying machines are required to perform indoor scanning operation in case people do not
take self-initiatives to come to balconies for scanning.
Smart mini-drones and accessibility in internal boundaries of the home/hospital: There is a need to test
the drones capable to operate at a long distance with indoor operations. The accessibility to operate such
drones and data collection without interruption is a major issues that need to be tackled in future.
Efficient framework implementation: We used different subsystems of the proposed system with
temporary arrangements with major concentration over combating COVID-19 pandemic and its cases.
For example, a group of machine at scanning sites were used as edge network and computing system for
filtering the required data and sharing with hospital under federal government monitoring and control.
However, there is a need to standardize such computing platforms and their efficiencies before actual
use. Thus, sub-system services including the use of computing infrastructure, security primitives and
protocols, and long term secure big data storage will be implemented.
Fool-Proof COVID-19 system and comparative analysis: In the proposed system, the comparative
analysis with state-of-the art work is limited to collision avoidance algorithms. However, there is a need
to perform more such comparative analysis like performance analysis of proposed system with other
pandemic and medical systems, and comparative security analysis of medical systems.
Large scale medical infrastructure integration: There is a need to develop an integrated medical system
for fast monitoring and collective support system that is capable of collecting long distant patient data
and provide services at large scale. Such systems can consider environment conditions and other barriers
in flying drones, collecting data, and maintain the data security as per government policies.
