Abstract
The outbreak of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the virus
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has already
created emergency situations in almost every country of the world. The disease spreads all over the world within a very short period of time after its first
identification in Wuhan, China in December, 2019. In India, the outbreaks
starts on 2nd March, 2020 and after that the cases are increasing exponentially. Very high population density, the unavailability of specific medicines
or vaccines, insufficient evidences regarding the transmission mechanism of
the disease also make it difficult to fight against the disease properly in India.
Mathematical models have been used to predict the disease dynamics and
also to assess the efficiency of the intervention strategies in reducing the disease burden. In this work, we propose a mathematical model to describe the
disease transmission mechanism between the individuals. We consider the
initial phase of the outbreak situation in India and our proposed model is fitted to the daily cumulative new reported cases during the period 2nd March,
2020 to 24th March, 2020. We estimate the basic reproduction number (R0 ),
effective reproduction number (R(t)) and epidemic doubling time from the
incidence data for the above-mentioned period. We further assess the effect
of preventive measures such as spread of awareness, lock-down, proper hand
sanitization, etc. in reducing the new cases. Two intervention scenarios are
considered depending on the variability of the intervention strength over the
period of implementation. Our study suggests that higher intervention effort

is required to control the disease outbreak within a shorter period of time in
India. Moreover, our analysis reveals that the strength of the intervention
should be strengthened over the time to eradicate the disease effectively.

1. Introduction
Coronaviruses, related to the family Coronaviridae are single-stranded,
positive-sense RNA viruses [1]. In the year 1960, the human coronaviruses
were first classified and scientists used the term ‘corona’ due to its crown-like
visibility on the surface area [2]. Three major outbreaks occurred because of
coronaviruses in the years 2003, 2012 and 2015. The outbreak occurred in
China in the year 2003 was named as ‘Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome’
(SARS) outbreak. Saudi Arabia in 2012 [3] and South Korea in 2015 [4] were
affected by ’Middle East Respiratory Syndrome’ (MERS) outbreak.
Recently, in December, 2019, a newly invaded coronavirus, first identified in Wuhan, the capital city of the Hubei province of China caused an
outbreak [5]. This is considered as the fourth coronavirus outbreak. It has
been reported that due to viral pneumonia, 27 people were infected which
includes 7 critically ill cases [6], and this outbreak has grabbed substantial
attentions all over the globe. The Chinese officials declared on 7th January,
2020 that this infectious disease is transmitted through a biological pathogen,
named novel coronavirus and on 10th January, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) referred the novel coronavirus as ‘2019-nCoV’. Finally,
on 11th February, 2020, WHO declared the official name of the disease and
the causing virus as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) respectively [7]. WHO
also published preliminary guidelines for all the countries to deal with this
outbreak. The guidelines are mainly based on how to provide health care support to the infected patient and build awareness among the ordinary people
about this new disease [8].
Plenty of research works indicates that COVID-19 possibly spread from
animal to human (zoonotic) [9, 10]. Moreover, a rapid number of new occurrences of COVID-19 reveals the key fact that the secondary transmission can
occur through human to human [11] via direct communication or through
droplets spread by coughing or sneezing from an infected person [12]. This
2

human to human transmission is considerably growing almost everywhere in
the world by means of the international movement [13] and as soon as an
area of a specific country is affected then COVID-19 rapidly grows through
local transmission. Person infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus shows symptoms
like fever, cough, and shortness of breath, muscle ache, confusion, headache,
sore throat, rhinorrhea, chest pain, haemoptysis, diarrhoea, dyspnoea and
nausea and vomiting [14, 12, 10]. WHO situation report [15] reveals that the
COVID-19 pandemic spread on the Western Pacific, European, South-east
Asia, Eastern Mediterranean, America and African Region with their respective territories, causing a huge number of infected cases. The new cases are
quickly growing in various countries like USA, Spain, Germany, France, Italy,
UK, Iran, Switzerland, India, Netherlands, Austria, etc. [15].
In India, the first confirmed case of COVID-19 was reported on 30th January, 2020 [16]. Government of India declared a countrywide lock-down for
21 days as a preventive measure for the COVID-19 outbreak on 24th March,
2020 [17]. Besides the lock-down, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare
(MOHFW) of India, suggested various individual hygiene measures e.g. frequent hand washing, social distancing, use of mask, avoiding touching eyes,
nose, or mouth, etc. [18, 19]. The government also continuously using various
media and social networking web sites to aware the citizen. However, the factors like very high population density, the unavailability of specific medicines
or vaccines, insufficient evidences regarding the transmission mechanism of
the disease also make it difficult to fight against the disease properly in India.
Mathematical models have been used to predict the disease dynamics
and also to assess the efficiency of the intervention strategies in reducing the
disease burden. In this context, several studies have been done using real incidence data of the affected countries and examined different characteristics
of the outbreak as well as evaluated the effect of intervention strategies implemented to curb the outbreak in the respective countries [6, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24].
In this work, we propose a deterministic compartmental model to describe
the disease transmission mechanism between the individuals. We consider the
situation of India during the initial outbreak period and fitted our model to
the daily cumulative new cases reported between 2nd March, 2020 to 24th
March, 2020. We estimate the basic reproduction number, effective reproduction number and epidemic doubling time from the incidence data for the
above-mentioned period. The efficiency of preventive measures in reducing
the disease burden is also studied for different level of intervention strength.
Further, the impact of intervention in the situation where the strength of the
3

intervention is varied over the implementation period.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we briefly
describe our proposed model. Section 3 is devoted in describing the procedure
of model fitting. The estimation of basic reproduction number, effective
reproduction number and epidemic doubling time from actual incidence data
is described in section 4. In section 5, the efficiency of the intervention is
studied. Finally we discuss the findings obtained from our study in section 6.
2. Description of the model
We adopt deterministic compartmental modelling approach to describe
the disease transmission mechanism. Depending on the health status, the
total human population is categorized into seven compartments: susceptible
(S), exposed (E), symptomatic (I), asymptomatic (Ia ), quarantined (Iq ),
hospitalized (H) and recovered (R). Susceptible population becomes exposed
with the disease after experiencing close contacts with the symptomatic as
well as asymptomatic individuals. We assume that the rate of disease transmission from asymptomatic individuals to susceptible individuals is less than
that of from symptomatic individuals. The rate of new infection is given by
βS(I+ηIa )
, where β denotes the transmission rate of the disease and η(< 1) is
N
the modification parameter that accounts the reduction in the transmission
rate from the asymptomatic individuals. At any instant of time, the total
population is given by N = S + E + I + Ia + Iq + H + R. Since we consider
the outbreak situation which usually persists for a shorter period of time, we
do not incorporate any demographic factors (i.e birth, death, etc.) into the
model. We assume that after the incubation period (σ −1 ), ρ1 fraction of the
exposed individuals move to symptomatic compartment, ρ2 fraction move to
the asymptomatic compartment and the remaining fraction, (ρ3 = 1−ρ1 −ρ2 )
move to the quarantined compartment. The individuals in the symptomatic
compartment (I) show severe symptoms of the disease and after α−1 period of
time they are hospitalized. On the other hand, the asymptomatic individuals
who do not show any symptom of the disease get natural recovery at a rate
γa and move to the recovered class (R). The individuals in the quarantined
compartment (Iq ) are those individuals who exhibit mild symptoms and are
advised to be quarantined. From quarantined class (Iq ), individuals move to
the hospitalized class (H) at a rate αq . They can also get natural recovery
and move to the recovered class (R) at a rate γq . Individuals admitted in
the hospitals move to recovered class at a rate γ. We also consider that the
4

hospitalized individuals die due to the disease at a rate δ. The recovered
population increases due to the recovery of asymptomatic, quarantined and
hospitalized individuals at the rates γa , γq and γ respectively. The following

3. Model fitting
Though the first confirmed case of COVID-19 was reported on 30th January, 2020 [16], from 2nd March, 2020 onwards, the new cases are being
reported continuously. Therefore, we consider 2nd March, 2020 as the starting date of the outbreak in India. It is also to be noted that, Government
6

of India declared a countrywide lock-down from 25th March, 2020 for 21
days [17]. Therefore, we assume that during the period 2nd March, 2020 to
24th March, 2020 no such preventive measures was taken by the Government
of India. Since we do not incorporate any intervention in our model (2.1),
we fit our model to the daily cumulative new reported COVID-19 cases of
India during the period 2nd March, 2020 to 24th March, 2020. The daily
cumulative cases data are obtained from [26].
We estimate four unknown model parameters: (i.) the transmission rate
(β), (ii.) modification parameter (η), (iii.) fraction of population move to
symptomatic class from exposed class (ρ1 ) and (iv.) fraction of population
move to asymptomatic class from exposed class (ρ2 ) by fitting the model to
the cumulative reported cases data.
The cumulative new reported cases from the model is given by
Z t
C(t, Θ) = C(0) +
(αI(τ ) + αq Iq (τ ))dτ,
(3.1)
0

where Θ = {β, η, ρ1, ρ2 } and C(0) denotes the initial cumulative cases.
We perform our model fitting by using in-built function lsqnonlin in MATLAB (Mathworks, R2014a) to minimize the sum of square function. In our
case, the sum of square function SS(Θ) is given by,
SS(Θ) =

C d (ti ) − C(ti , Θ) ,

where, C (ti ) is the actual data at tth

Fig. 2. The values of the estimated parameters are given in Table 1.

4. Basic reproduction number
Basic reproduction number is a key quantity in epidemiology which quantifies the average number of secondary cases generated from a single primary
cases during the his infectious period. This quantity can be calculated from
a mathematical model by following next generation matrix approach. Following [27], the new infection matrix F and the transmission matrix V are
given by,

(4.1)

It is to be noted that, the first term is the number of new infection caused
by symptomatic individual (I) whereas the second term is the number new
infection due to the infection by asymptomatic individual (Ia ).
4.1. Estimation of basic reproduction number from actual epidemics
The basic reproduction number (R0 ) for communicable diseases can be
estimated through the actual epidemic data by using various statistical as
well as mathematical methods [28]. In this study, we estimate R0 from the
initial growth phase of the epidemics [29, 30, 31]. At the early stage of the
epidemic, there is a non-linear relationship between the cumulative number of cases C(t) and the force of infection Λ which can be mathematically
written as C(t) ∝ exp(Λt). So the number of exposed, symptomatic and
asymptomatic population progress in the following form,
E ∝ E0 exp(Λt),
I ∝ I0 exp(Λt),
Ia ∝ Ia0 exp(Λt).

(4.2)

where E0 , I0 and Ia0 are constants. Further, the number of non-susceptible
population can be assumed negligible i.e. S(t) = N. Substituting the equation (4.2) into the model (2.1), we have
E0 (Λ + σ) = β(I0 + ηIa0 ),
I0 (Λ + α)
= ρ1 σE0 ,
Ia0 (Λ + γa ) = ρ2 σE0 .

(4.3)

Using the expression of R0 from equation (4.1) and applying the above
equations (4.3) we have determined relation between the R0 and the force of
infection Λ as follows:

R0 =

ρ

ρ2 η 
1
+
α
γa

"

#
Λ+σ
ηρ2 σ .
ρ1 σ
+
Λ+α
Λ+γa

(4.4)

Here we first estimate the force of infection Λ and then estimate R0 by
using equation (4.4). Following [32, 31], the relation between the number
9

of new cases per day and the cumulative number of cases per day C(t) as:
number of new cases ∼ ΛC(t).
The force of infection (Λ) can be calculated from the COVID-19 incidence
data in the following ways [30]:
Step 1. We plot the number of new COVID-19 cases (per day) in x−axis versus
the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases (per day) in y − axis.
Step 2. In the scatter plot, we point out the threshold of cumulative cases up
to which new cases show the exponential growth.
Step 3. Then we fit a linear regression model using the least square technique
to this exponential growth data.
Step 4. The slope of the fitted line is considered as the force of infection (Λ).
We obtain Λ = 0.2073 ± 0.0151 day −1 based on the slope shown in Fig. 3.
Using the equation (4.4) along with the parameter values form Table 1, we
obtain the estimate of R0 = 4.1849 with upper and lower bounds 4.5014 and
3.8799 respectively. This estimate of R0 indicates that the initial transmissibility of COVID-19 is pretty much higher than 1, which in turns implies
that it is essential to control the disease at the initial phase.
4.1.1. Epidemic doubling time
The doubling time of an epidemic is a measure of the rate of spread
of a disease. It is the required time to double the number of cases in the
epidemic. There is an inverse relationship between epidemic strength and
the doubling time i.e. if an epidemic declines, the doubling time increases
and vice versa. Following [22], we obtain the epidemic doubling time for our
study is T2 = ln(2)
≈ 3.34 days. Therefore, it is necessary to apply some
Λ
preventive measures else the epidemic appears in a large scale within a short
time.

2020. The box indicates the growing linear parts of the plots corresponding
to the initial growth of the epidemics. The least squares linear fit of the linear
phase corresponding to data in dot box gives Λ = 0.2073±0.0151 with correlation
coefficient R ≈ 0.9507.

4.2. Effective reproduction number R(t)
Study regarding the time span of an epidemic is very crucial and can
be achieved to a certain extent through the estimation of R(t), the effective
reproduction number. It is defined as the actual average number of secondary
cases from a typical primary case at time t [33]. The value of R(t) provides
information about the severity of the disease over different time points and
alert epidemiologists to suggest about the control measures [30]. We estimate
R(t) from the daily new infection curve of the infected COVID-19 cases data
by using the following equation derived from the renewal equation of a birth
process:
b(t)
,
b(t
−
a)g(a)da
a=0

R(t) = R ∞

(4.5)

where, the term b(t) corresponds to the number of new cases in the day t
and the term g() is the generation interval distribution for a disease [31].
We derive the expression of the generation interval distribution g(t) from
the model (2.1) by applying the method discussed in [31, 34]. The rates
of leaving the exposed and infectious compartments are indicated by b1 , b2
11

and b3 . These quantities are constant and extracted from the model (2.1) as
b1 = σ, b2 = α and b3 = γa . Moreover, the generation interval distribution is
the convolution of three exponential distributions with a mean Tc = 1/b1 +
1/b2 + 1/b3 . Following [31, 35], we have the following explicit expression for
the convolution:

g(t) =

3
X
b1 b2 b3 exp (−bi t)
i=1

Y

(bj − bi )

,

(4.6)

j=1,j6=i

with t ≥ 0. The validity of the above relation (4.6) holds for a minimum
threshold value of the force of infection Λ, defined as Λ > min (−b1 , −b2 , −b3 )
[34].
Using the daily COVID-19 incidence data and applying the expression of
g(t) in equation (4.6), we estimate R(t) from equation (4.5). Fig. 4 shows the
time evolution of the effective reproductive number R(t) to the COVID-19
outbreak in India, from 2nd March, 2020 to 24th March, 2020. The result is
shown here for t ≥ 3, since, the method used here to derive the expression
of R(t) is not applicable for lower values of t. Here the value of R(t) lies
between 2 to 6 most of the times. The low value of R(t) = 0 appears on
the second point (see Fig. 4) due to non occurrence of new cases at 6th
March 2020 also the high value of R(t) ≈ 7.54, 8.86 occurs on 6th , 17th day
of the outbreak due to the high number of new cases found on these days. It
implies that the disease continues to infect the more and more people during
that period. It is worthy to remember that, at this point Govt. of India
announced a lock-down to break the chain of infection spread else it will be
almost impossible to control the spread after a certain period of time.

parameter values are taken from Table 1.

5. Effect of intervention
In this section, we study the effect of intervention strategies in reducing the new COVID-19 cases through our model. Intervention strategies
includes the control measures such as lock-down, spreading awareness program through media, proper hand sanitization, etc. which results in slowing
down the disease transmission process. In terms of model parameter, the
implementation of intervention implies that there would be a reduction in
the disease transmission rate β. This reduction in the transmission rate is
considered as the strength of the intervention, k. In the presence of intervention, the parameter β is modified as (1 − k)β throughout the period of
implementation.
Staring from the initial date of outbreak, we consider a period of 210
days (i.e 7 months) and study the impact of intervention during that period.
13

Speaking in terms of actual date, we consider the time period 2nd , March,
2020 to 27th September, 2020.
We consider two types of intervention scenarios: (i.) the strength of the
intervention (k) is fixed throughout the implementation period, (ii.) the
strength of intervention is varied over the implementation period.
5.1. Scenario 1
In this intervention scenario, the strength of the intervention k is taken
to be fixed over the implementation period. We first consider the situation
without any intervention (i.e k = 0). Our model (2.1) is simulated for 210
days to observe the dynamics of the disease in the absence of any intervention,
using the in-built function ode45 in MATLAB (Mathworks, R2014a). From
Fig. 5, we see that the number new cases grows exponentially and attains
the maximum at the end of the June. It is also observed that maximum of
26.3593 million new cases can occur in the absence of any intervention during
the period (see Table 2). However, in the subsequent time, decreasing trend
in the new cases is noted.
Now we study the efficiency of the intervention by varying the strength
of the intervention (k). Regarding the initiation of the control, we follow the
same date when Govt. of India implemented nation-wide lock down i.e 25th
March, 2020. Throughout the study we consider this date as the initial date
of implementing the intervention.
For the low value of the intervention strength (i.e for k = 0.20), it is
observed that the time for the occurrence of peak of the outbreak is slightly
delayed than that of without intervention scenario (see Fig. 5). The peak of
the outbreak is shifted to the end of the month July. In this case, maximum
19.7233 million new cases can occur (see Table 2). If the strength of the
intervention is increased further (for k = 0.40), the peak of the outbreak
decreases and the occurrence of the peak shifted to the end of September
(see Fig. 5). In this case, the maximum number new cases in a single day
reduces to 11.2784 million (see Table 2).
Now we consider the higher values of intervention strength. For k = 0.75,
the new cases tend to decrease within a week (see Fig. 5) from the date of
implementation and in such a case maximum of 102 new cases can occur (see
Table 2). If the strength is increased further (i.e for k = 0.85 and 0.95) we
see that the disease can be effectively eradicated within 1 to 2 months from
the initial date of implementing intervention (see Fig. 5).

Next we quantify the cumulative number of new cases at the end of the
time duration under consideration (i.e at the end of 27th September, 2020)
for different values of strength of intervention (k). From Fig. 6, we see
that, the final number of cumulative new cases gradually decreases if the
strength of the intervention is increased. However, for higher values of k (i.e
for k ∈ [0.7, 0.95]), the final cumulative cases are reduced significantly. The
actual number of final cumulative cases for different values of k are presented
in Table 2.

Next we evaluate the maximum number of new cases during the time
period 2nd March, 2020 to 27th September, 2020 for different values of k (see
Fig. 7). The actual number of maximum new cases for different values of k
are tabulated in Table 2.

The zoomed in figure is displayed in the inset.

The percentage of relative reduction in the final cumulative new cases
for different k is presented in Fig. 8. It is observed that interventions having
lower strengths(i.e for k ∈ [0.1, 0.4]), can reduce up to 54.6% final cumulative
cases. However, if the strength of the intervention is considered to be higher
then almost 99.8% reduction in the final cumulative cases can be achieved.

5.2. Scenario 2
In this scenario, instead of considering the fixed value of k over the whole
time interval after the initiation of intervention as in scenario 1, we vary the
value of k over the implementation period. The implementation period i.e
25th March, 2020 to 27th September, 2020 is divided into three time windows.
The first window consists of 21 days whereas the second and third window
consists of 35 days and 131 days respectively.
We first decrease the value of k from first window to third window. The
values of k taken in the three windows are 0.9, 0.7 and 0.6 respectively.
We observe from Fig. 9 that in this case, the new cases decreases in the
first window and remains almost unchanged in the second window where the
value of k is decreased slightly than first window. However, when the value
of k is decreased further in the third window, the new cases tend to increase
rapidly. This implies that the relaxation in the interventions strategy over
the time does not end up with the disease eradication.

subsequent time windows after the initiation of the intervention

Next we consider the opposite case i.e we increase the value of k from
first window to third window. The values of k are taken as 0.3, 0.65 and 0.8
respectively in the respective time windows. It is observed from Fig. 10 that
the new cases tends to increase in the first two windows. However, in the
third window where the value of k is high enough, the new tend to decrease.
This essentially implies that the intervention should be strengthened over the
time to eradicate the disease effectively.

6. Discussion and conclusion
The COVID-19 outbreak in India is a potential threat to the country
due to its rapid spread. Mathematical models are very effective tools to
predict the time span and pattern of the outbreak. Moreover, mathematical
models can also provide useful insights regarding the impact of intervention
in lowering the disease incidence.
In this study, we proposed a deterministic compartmental model to describe the disease transmission mechanism among the population. We considered the initial phase of outbreak of the disease COVID-19 in India and fitted
our proposed model to the cumulative new reported cases during the period
2nd March, 2020 to 24th March, 2020. Some model parameters are estimated
by fitting our model to the cumulative new reported cases during the above
mentioned period. By looking at the estimated parameters, it is observed
that the rate of disease transmission is quite high which basically implies the
high infectiousness of the disease. The percentage of the symptomatic individuals coming from exposed individuals is estimated to be more than 52%,
20

whereas the percentage of the asymptomatic and quarantined individuals are
estimated as more than 27% and 20% respectively. This indicates that the
contribution of the asymptomatic population to COVID-19 cases in India is
not negligible.
Based on the estimated parameters and actual COVID-19 incidence data,
we estimated basic reproduction number, effective reproduction number and
epidemic doubling time to get an overview of this initial phase of outbreak.
We obtained the estimate of basic reproduction number R0 as 4.1849 with
upper and lower bounds are 4.5014 and 3.8799 respectively. This high value
of R0 basically captures the outbreak scenario in India. The effective reproduction number (R(t)) provides information about the severity of COVID-19
over different time points. In our study, the values of R(t) lie between 2 and
6 most of the time. This is also confirms high transmissibility of the disease.
The epidemic doubling time is also estimated to be approximately 3.34 days.
This suggests that the rate of disease transmission need to be controlled
otherwise a large proportion will be affected within a very short period of
time
We studied the impact of intervention in reducing the disease burden. We
basically considered the preventive measures such as lock-down, spreading of
awareness program through media, proper hand sanitization, etc. which slow
down the disease transmissibility. Two intervention scenarios are considered
depending on the variability of the intervention strength over the period of
implementation. In the first scenario, we fixed the strength of the intervention throughout the period of implementation and studied the impact of
intervention for different level of intervention efforts. In this scenario, our
study reveals that higher intervention effort is required to control the disease
outbreak within a shorter period of time. In the second scenario, the whole
implementation time are divided into three time windows and in each of the
window, the intervention strength is taken to be different. In such a scenario,
our analysis shows that the strength of the intervention should not be relaxed
over the time rather the intervention should be strengthened to eradicate the
disease effectively. Designing the efficient intervention strategy is one of the
crucial factor to curb the disease spread in an outbreak situation. In this
regard, our study suggests that strict intervention should be implemented by
the Government in the subsequent period of this outbreak. We believe that
the findings obtained from this study can provide fruitful insights in framing
policies regarding the control of COVID-19 in India.
