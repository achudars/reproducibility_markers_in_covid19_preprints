Abstract

The COVID-19 outbreak has posed an unprecedented challenge to humanity and science.
On the one side, public and private incentives have been put in place to promptly allocate
resources toward research areas strictly related to the COVID-19 emergency. But on the flip
side, research in many fields not directly related to the pandemic has lagged behind. In this
paper, we assess the impact of COVID-19 on world scientific production in the life sciences.
We investigate how the usage of medical subject headings (MeSH) has changed following the
outbreak. We estimate through a difference-in-differences approach the impact of COVID-19
on scientific production through PubMed. We find that COVID-related research topics have
risen to prominence, displaced clinical publications, diverted funds away from research areas
not directly related to COVID-19 and that the number of publications on clinical trials in
unrelated fields has contracted. Our results call for urgent targeted policy interventions to
reactivate biomedical research in areas that have been neglected by the COVID-19 emergency.

Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic has mobilized the world scientific community in 2020, especially in the
life sciences [6, 12]. In the first three months after the pandemic, the number of scientific papers
about COVID was fivefold the number of articles on H1N1 swine influenza [5]. Similarly, the
number of clinical trials for COVID prophylaxis and treatments skyrocketed [3]. Thanks to the
rapid mobilization of the world scientific community, COVID-19 vaccines have been developed
in record time. Despite this undeniable success, there is a rising concern about the negative
consequences of COVID-19 on clinical trial research with many projects being postponed [4, 10,
11]. According to Evaluate Pharma, clinical trials were one of the pandemic’s first casualties,
with a record number of 160 studies suspended for reasons related to COVID in April 2020
[2]. As a consequence, clinical researchers have been impaired by reduced access to healthcare
research infrastructures. Particularly, the COVID-19 outbreak took a tall on women and earlycareer scientists [7, 9, 13, 15]. On a different ground, Shan and colleagues found that nonCOVID-related articles decreased as COVID-related articles increased in top clinical research
journals [14]. Fraser and coworker found that COVID preprints received more attention and

citations than non-COVID preprints [6]. More recently, Hook and Porter have found some early
evidence of “covidisation” of academic research, with research grants and output diverted to
COVID research in 2020 [8]. How much should scientists switch their efforts toward SARS-CoV2 prevention, treatment, or mitigation? There is a growing consensus that the current level of
“covidisation” of research can be wasteful [1, 3, 4].
Against this background, in this paper we investigate if the COVID-19 pandemic has induced
a bias in in biomedical publications toward COVID-related scientific production. We classify
scientific articles of the last three years in PubMed in about 19 000 “research fields” using the
curated Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terminology. For each research field, we compute a
measure of relatedness to COVID-19 (including COVID-19 Testing, Serological Testing, Nucleic
Acid Testing, and Vaccines) and SARS-CoV-2 MeSH terms, which first appeared in the scientific
literature in December 2019. A sample of the MeSH terms most closely related to COVID-19 is
shown Figure 1.
We first look at how the COVID emergency has caused a profound change in the importance of
research topics (as proxied through MeSH) shifting attention to COVID-19 related research. We
then look through a natural-experiment approach on the impact of the pandemic on scientific
output. We consider COVID-19 as a transparent exogenous source of variation across research
fields. By applying a difference-in-differences regression analysis, we find that COVID-related
MeSH terms have been much more likely to be published in high-impact journals in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. The publication bias is even more pronounced for open
access research. We also document a significant contraction of non-COVID related clinical trial
publications and a negative funding effect for COVID unrelated research fields, with no sign of
re-balancing at the end of 2020.
The overall picture that emerges is that there has been a profound realignment of priorities
and research efforts within the scientific community and that this shift has displaced unrelated
research.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. We introduce first the data, our measure of relatedness as well as the econometric specification we rely on to identify the impact of the pandemic
on scientific output. We show the difference in difference analysis highlighting the sudden shift
in publications, grants and trial towards COVID related topics and show through a network
approach how the MeSH usage patterns of COVID related terms have risen to prominence and
also affected the focus of many other fields of research.

Figure 1: The 200 MeSH terms used most frequently with COVID-specific MeSH Terms are
shown as word-cloud. The size of the term is proportional to its relatedness to COVID-19
MeSH terms.

Materials and Methods
Data
For the analysis, we use PubMed, specifically the daily updated files up to 31/12/2020. We
consider 3 360 248 papers published between January 2018 and December 2020 for the main
analysis, as well as 6 389 974 papers published from 2015 on-wards to classify grants. We use
SCImago to weigh the papers by the impact factor of the journal they appear in.

Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)
We rely on the MeSH terminology in this work to approximate “fields” of research. This terminology is a curated medical vocabulary, which is manually added to Papers in the PubMed
corpus. The fact that MeSH terms are manually added makes this terminology ideal for classification purposes. However, there is a delay between publication and annotation (on the order
of months). To address this delay and have the most recent classification, i.e., December 2020,
we search for all 28 425 MeSH terms using the ESearch facility of PubMed and classify paper
by the results. We apply this method to the whole period (January 2018 to December 2020).
Similarly, we classify papers on clinical trials through ESearch, searching for the specific clinical
trial MeSH terms.

COVID-Relatedness
We estimate the relatedness of a focal MeSH term to COVID-19 MeSH terms as the conditional
probability that a paper contains a COVID-19 term given that it includes the focal term. Formally
simi = P (COVID|MeSHi ) = P (COVID ∩ MeSHi )/P (MeSHi )

(1)

We define a dichotomous variable COVIDi that takes value 1 for MeSH terms highly related
to COVID-19 (larger than the threshold value τ ) and 0 otherwise. In our primary analysis we
selected the value of τ , which minimizes the pre-2020 distance between the two groups.

Model
To estimate the impact of the COVID pandemic (treatment) on scientific production, we estimate a random effects panel regression where the units of analysis are about 19 000 research
fields observed over time before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, we estimate the
following model
ln Yit = β1 + β2 COVIDi + β3 Tt + β4 COVIDi × Tt + νi + it
Where Yit identifies one of the four outcome measures. The variable COVIDi is 1 if term i is
closely related to COVID-19 and 0 otherwise, specifically COVIDi = 1(simi > τ ). The variable
Tt identifies the period, i.e., month or year. νi is the MeSH specific error term, and it is the
overall error term. The saturation in COVID and T means that β4 can be interpreted as the
Diff-in Diff effect. In the yearly specification, 2018 is the base year. In the monthly specification,
January 2019 is the base month. The errors are clustered at the MeSH term level. We drop MeSH
terms which have fewer than five papers per month or 60 (=5*12) per year, to exclude infrequent
terms.

Additional Robustness Checks
We have carried out the regression analysis on the unweighted analogs of the dependant variables
(i.e., Number of Papers, not IFWN) and raw counts, i.e., not log-transformed. Moreover, we have
carried out the analysis using the continuous COVID-Relatedness measure and a wide range of
other τ values. Finally, we considered an alternative model by dropping MeSH terms with an
intermediate level of relatedness to COVID-19. The results are qualitatively identical. With the
provided code and data all the mentioned robustness checks can be replicated.

Results
Impact on Publications, Funding and Clinical Trials
In January 2020, researchers discovered the cause of a severe respiratory disease of unknown origin: the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Since then the pandemic has shuffled the research priorities of the worldwide scientific community. We consider SARS-CoV-2 and the related COVID-19
disease as a natural experiment that suddenly affected the scientific community at the beginning
of 2020. PubMed scientific publications of the last three years have been classified into about
19 000 areas of research. We defined a measure of relatedness to COVID-19 as the probability
that a paper in a given domain contains SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19 MeSH terms. Research fields
have been divided into two groups: COVID-related areas of research (treated) and other research
fields (control). Different thresholds of relatedness to COVID-19 have been used to separate the
two groups.
In Table 1 we report the result of a difference-in-differences regression to estimate the impact of
COVID-19 on the journal impact factor weighted number (IFWN) of publications, open access
publications, articles related to clinical trials, and publications with grants. And in Figure 2
we show the margins of this regression, which highlight that the common trend assumption is
satisfied since the scientific output grew at the same rate from 2018 to 2019 across both groups.
Then in 2020 the two groups significantly diverged: COVID-related publications experience a
significant increase, whereas publications in other fields halted, with a marked drop of clinical
trials publications and publications listing grants.
Figure 3 shows a similar analysis on a monthly basis. The monthly analysis reveals that total
scientific output and open access publications in non-COVID research areas bounce back to
pre-COVID-19 levels after a dip in May. Conversely, we do not detect any sign of recovery
for publication related to non-COVID clinical trials and granted publications. To understand if
non-COVID grants have been diverted to COVID-related research, we classify the type of grants
listed in the publications as “new grants” (appear first in 2020) and “old grants” (appeared before
2020). Obviously, old grants could not have been meant for COVID research. The usage of these
two types of grants by the two grups is shown in Figure 4. We notice that old grants are used
disproportionately more often in COVID-related areas of research. This implies that grants which
were not meant to sustain COVID research have been diverted to COVID publications. This is
on top of the ad-hoc financial support by new grants for COVID-19 in 2020.

Changes in MeSH usage
The sudden surge in publications on COVID-19 related terms documented above has also affected
the way MeSH terms are used and, by extension, the Biomedical research landscape’s focus. To

highlight this shift in focus, we proxy the usage and changing interdependence of MeSH terms
by looking at their co-occurrence on all publications in the years 2018, 2019 and 2020. Precisely,
we extract the co-occurrence matrix of all 28,000 MeSH terms as they appear on the 3.3 million
papers by year. These networks summarise their complex interdependence and usage by the
scientific community. We proxy the changes in this network by looking at the change in PageRank
centralities across years. The PageRank centrality tells us how likely a random walker traversing
a network would be found at a given node if he follows the edges. Specifically, for the case of the
MeSH co-occurrence network, this number represents how often an author would include a given
MeSH term following the observed general usage patterns. It is a simple measure to capture the

complexities of biomedical research. Nevertheless, it captures far reaching interdependence across
MeSH terms as the measure uses the whole network to determine the centrality of every MeSH
term. A sudden change in the rankings and thus the position of MeSH terms in this network
suggests that a given research topic has risen from obscurity to prominence as it is used more
often with other important MeSH terms (or vice versa).
To show that COVID-related research has profoundly impacted the way MeSH terms are used,
we compute for each MeSH how many ranks it gained from 2019 to 2020. To have a caparison,
we compute the gain for the pre-COVID period from 2018 to 2018.
In figure Figure 5 we see that MeSH terms with high COVID-19 similarity have risen quickly
from obscurity to become central to much of the published research. We find that the Pearson
correlation between rank gain and COVID relatedness is very high at 0.5. We also note that this

Discussion
The scientific community has swiftly reallocated research efforts to cope with the COVID-19
pandemic, mobilizing knowledge across disciplines to find innovative solutions in record time.
We document this both in the scientific output as well as in the usage of MeSH terms of the
scientific community. The flip side of this sudden and energetic prioritization of effort has caused
a sudden contraction of scientific production in other relevant areas of research.
Our results provide compelling evidence that research related to COVID has indeed displaced
scientific production in other research fields, with a significant drop of scientific output related
to non-COVID clinical trials and a marked reduction of financial support for publications not
related to COVID. The displacement effect is persistent to the end of 2020. Heading into 2021,
as vaccination progresses, we highlight the urgent need for science policy to re-balance support
for research activity that was put on pause because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
We find that COVID-19 dramatically impacted clinical research. Reactivation of clinical trials
activities that have been postponed or suspended for reasons related to COVID is a priority that
should be considered in the national vaccination plans by including patients and researchers in
the high priority groups. Moreover, since grants have been diverted and financial incentives have
been targeted to sustain COVID-19 research leading to an excessive entry in COVID-related

research and otherwise neglected or temporally abandoned areas of research. Without dedicated
support in the recovery plans for neglected research of the COVID-19 era, there is a risk that
more medical needs will be unmet in the future, possibly exacerbating the shortage of scientific
research for orphan and neglected diseases, which do not belong to COVID-related research areas.
