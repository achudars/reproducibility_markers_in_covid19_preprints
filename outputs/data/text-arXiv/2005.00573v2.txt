Abstract
The rapid and surprised emergence of COVID-19, having infected three million
and killed two hundred thousand people worldwide in less than five months, has
led many experts to focus on simulating its propagation dynamics in order to
have an estimated outlook for the not too distante future and so supporting the
local and national governments in making decisions. In this paper, we apply the
SIR model to simulating the propagation dynamics of COVID-19 on the Cape
Verde Islands. It will be done firstly for Santiago and Boavista Islands, ant then
for Cape Verde in general. The choice of Santiago rests on the fact that it is the
largest island, with more than 50% of the Population of the country, whereas
Boavista was chosen because it is the island where the first case of COVID-19 in
Cape Verde was diagnosed. Observations made after the date of the simulations
were carried out corroborates our projections.
Keywords: Covid-19, Santiago, Boavista, Cape Verde, SIR Model.

to millions of life. In the same proportion, the worldwide medical class has faced
enormous challenges in the search for cures, which usually takes several months
and sometimes years to be found. Nowadays, even with all the technological
and biotechnological advancement in the medical and pharmaceutical industry
of 21st century, cures have not yet been found for many diseases; a remarkable
and classical example is AIDS (caused by HIV) which has no cure yet even after
more than thirty years since the first cases were discovered. Based on estimates,
in 2020 the Global Health Observatory (GHO) reported 300 thousand deaths
by AIDS per year (see GHO [21]).
Chronologically, some of the most devastating infectious diseases in the last
seven centuries are summarized below:
• Black death (due to the black plague) in Europe, Asia and North Africa
claimed up to 72 - 200 million live (14th century, 1331–1353; see Austin
and suzanne [23]);
• New England’s (coastal) Plague claimed up to 30-90% of the population
(17th century, 1616–1619; see Bratton [24]);
• Persian plague claimed 2 million lives (18th century, 1772–1773; see Shahraki
et al. [25]);
• Third cholera pandemic in Russia claimed over one million lives (19th
century, 1852-1860; see Hays [26]);
• Influenza pandemic of 1918 (the most severe pandemic in recent history)
claimed at least 50 million lives worldwide (20th century, 1918–1919; see
Patterson and Pyle [27]);
• Asian flu (also known as 1957-58 Influenza pandemic) claimed two million
lives worldwide (20th century, 1957–1969; see Paul [28]);
• HIV (responsible for AIDS) claimed over 30 million lives worldwide and
still claiming lives, since there is no cure yet (XX century, since 1960;
see Ortiz et al. [29]).

Early in the 21st century, specifically in 2009, the world has witnessed the
pandemic of flu A of 2009 caused by H1N1 influenza virus , claiming more than
18 thousand lives worldwide (see World Health Organization [22]). Between
2013 and 2016 we also witnessed the ebola outbreak in West Africa which pinpointed serious flaws in emergency response systems, since it ultimately claimed
11 thousand of lives by the time it was officially declared over (see Baseler et
al. [30]).
As we write, we are faced white COVID-19 pandemic (acute respiratory disease caused by novel coronavirus), which started by the end of 2019 in China,
and reached almost every country in the world with devastating results. Unfortunately, within five months since the first case was reported, by April 24
the World Health Organization reported more than 2 million 800 thousand infected people, 195 thousand deaths, and 776 thousand recovered cases. While
researchers struggle to find the cure for this devastating infectious disease, the
numbers of infected and death cases continue to increase exponentially; however, fortunately, at the same time mathematicians from several countries rush
to model its propagation dynamics by making projections for months ahead, in
order to support national government authorities in the control measures.
This study aims to make projection of the propagation dynamics of COVID19 in Cape Verde (see Figure 1). It is organized as follow: the next two subsections, 1.1 and 1.2, introduce the materials and model used; Section 2 introduces
and discusses the model and the methodology adopted; Section 3 is devoted to
the projection of COVID-19 in Cape Verde for the next 3 to 6 months; finally,
Section 4 discusses the achieved results.

1.1. Materials
Here we introduce the proposed mathematical model for COVID-19 analysis
on the Cape Verde Islands. The model parameters are estimated via optimization of the error function given as square difference between the number of
infected and the corresponding number of predicted cases by the model we are
using. The data are selected accordingly with the occurrence of the first infected case in Santiago (2020-03-25), Boavista (2020-03-19) and Cape Verde in
general (2020-03-19). Starting on 2020-03-19 or 2020-03-25, as the case may
be, the observations were made up until 2020-04-17. The date follows the ISO
8601format YYYY-MM-DD.

1.2. Proposed Model
The epidemiological models divide the target population into compartments
reflecting the different stages in which the individuals find themselves during
a disease propagation at time t ∈ [0, +∞[, such as “Immune”, “ Susceptible”,
“Infected’,“Quarantine”, “Removed”, “Recovered”, “Death”, etc, whose evolution in time is described by continuous functions, and model the relations
between the compartments with ordinary differential equations involving the
relative functions.
During the 20th century several researchers have conducted researches in
epidemic modeling (see Herbert [1], [3], Metz and Van den Bosch [5] and Diekmann et al. [13], Li et al. [14], Chowell et al. [20], Schuette [8], Mollisson [6],
for example), in an effort to allow a better understanding of the propagation
dynamics and the disease impact in order to support government authorities in
the control measures.
Kermack and Mackendrick [18] (see also Isea and Lonngren [19]) proposed
the one that would become the epidemic model playing central role, the SIR
model; it is known as compartmental model due to the fact that it divides the
population into three compartments:
• Susceptive (S): individuals susceptible to be infected;
• Infected (I): Infected individuals ;
• Removed (R): Individuals removed from compartment I (recovered or
dead).
SIR model has been used to model epidemic diseases (see Busenberg and
Cooke [12], for example) such as the black plague in Europe, Asia and North
Africa, New England epidemic, Persian plague and Spanish flu of 1915, and has
produced accurate projections (see Herbert [1] and [3]). It must be remarked
that it makes no distinction between those who recovered and those who died,
all of them are put into compartment R. It is also relevant to remark that the
recovered individuals are assumed to adquire immunities at least within the
5

period in which the studies is conducted. This is a reasonable assumptions,
mostly because those who have recovered from an infectious disease will not
expose themselves again so easily. SIR model also does not take into account
the latent period, it is assumed that as soon as an individual is infected he
becomes a vehicle to infect other individuals.
Let S(t), I(t) and R(t) respectively denote the number of individuals at
compartments of Susceptible, Infectious and Removed, at time t ∈ [0, +∞[, and
assumes that the population is homogeneous and there is no vital dynamics, that
is the total number of individuals remain equal to N, where N = S(t)+I(t)+R(t)
at any time t. It is also assumed that time t is counted in days, that is t ∈
[0, 1, 2, . . . [.

2. Background - SIR Model
Under the hypothesis previously considered, the dynamics of disease propagation via contact may be modeled with SIR model accordingly. Let β denotes
the parameter that control the transition between S and I, called contact rate,
and γ the one which control the transition between I and R, called remotion
rate (rate with which an individual died or recovered from the disease). Figure 2
shows the flow diagram of the approached model.

Figure 2: A flow diagram demonstrating the flux between the three compartments S, I and
R, as well as the rate β and γ at which the individuals move between the compartments.

The SIR model is given as the following system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations:

where S 0 (t) denotes the derivate of function S at t, that is

(1)

dS(t)
dt .

This model uses the standard incidence and has recovery rate at time t as
γI(t), corresponding to an exponential waiting time e−γt , and since the time
period (day) is short it does not take into account the vital dynamics (births
and deaths).
Let s(t) =

S(t)
N ,

i(t) =

I(t)
N

and r(t) =

R(t)
N ;

this yields s(t) + i(t) + r(t) = 1.

The system (1) can be rewritten as follows:


s0 (t) = −βs(t)i(t)

Since r(t) can always be found from s(t) and i(t) by using the fourth equation
of system (2), it is sufficient to consider (2) in the plane si, i.e.:



s0 (t) = −βs(t)i(t)

The system (3) shows that the epidemiologically region is the triangle T
given by
T = {(s(t), i(t)) : s(t) ≥ 0, i(t) ≥ 0, s(t) + i(t) ≤ 1}.

The threshold

γ

in the Theorem 2.1, known as Ro , is a quantity that

measure how fast the propagation of a disease is. We may note that at the
beginning of an epidemic, day 1 (t=0), we have that i0 is a very small value,
usually equal one, and therefore
s0 =

S0
N − i0

N

since the population is usually large. Thus, βs0 is the number of susceptible
individuals that are infected by contact with one infected individual per day at
beginning of the epidemic. On the other hand, the quantity γ −1 is the average
duration of infection, that is the average period in which an individual remains
infectious.
Definition 2.1. Ro =

βs0
γ

is the basic reproduction number per unity of time

(day).
In other words Ro is the number of individuals infected by one infected
individual per day. See Diekmann et al. [13] or Chowell et al. [20] for additional
information.

3. Simulations
Let G(t)=(S(t), I(t), R(t)), depending on the parameters β and γ, where
0 ≤ β, γ ≤ 1, denoting the unknown solution of SIR model for the number of
Susceptible, Infected and Removed individuals, and A(t) = (S a (t), I a (t), Ra (t))
denoting the corresponding actual number of observed Susceptive, Infected and
Removed individuals in Cape Verde at time (day) t. Since we also aim to project
the propagation dynamics of disease on Santiago and Boavista islands, it is
convenient for us to introduce the corresponding notations, that is SS (t), IS (t)
and RS (t) respectively denote the number of Susceptive, Infected and Removed
individuals for Santiago island, while SB (t), IB (t) and RB (t) the corresponding
numbers for Boavista island. More over, according to the corresponding context,
Cape Verde, Santiago, and Boavista, the following notation will be used without
additional explanation:
• GS (t) = (SS (t), IS (t), RS (t)) and GB (t) = (SB (t), IB (t), RB (t)) respectively denote the unknown solution of SIR model for the number of Susceptible, Infected and Removed individuals in Santiago and Boavista.
• AaS (t) = (SSa (t), ISa (t), RSa (t)) and AaB (t) = (S B (t), I B (t), RB (t)) respectively denote the number of observed Susceptive, Infected and Removed
individuals in Santiago and Boavista;
• N , NS and NB respectively denote the constant number of population of
Cape Verde, Santiago and Boavista;
• β, βS and βb respectively denote the contact rate for Cape Verde, Santiago
and Boavista;
• γ, γS and γB respectively denote the contact rate for Cape Verde, Santiago
and Boavista;
• k.k2 denotes the Euclidean norm.
In order to find the optimal estimates for the parameters (β, γ), (βS , γS ) and
(βB , γB ) for which the SIR model better fit the observed date from 2020-03-25

2020-03-19 to 2020-04-17 in Cape Verde, respectively, we use the L-BFGS-B

3.1. Projection for Santiago and Boavista Islands
In this Section we propose and discuss the projection of COVID-19 for Santiago and Boavista. It will be done firstly for Santiago (subsection 3.1.1) and
then for Boavista (subsection 3.1.2).
3.1.1. Santiago Insland
With a total of NS = 313461 inhabitants, being 170236 of them located
in the city of Praia, the largest city of Cape Verde, Santiago is home to more
the

1
2

of Cape Verde’s total population; this makes Santiago - largest island in

territory and population - the island which requires more attention with regards
to the propagation of an infectious disease like COVID-19.
The records for 24 days (from 2020-03-25 to 2020-04-25) of observations in
Santiago are summarized in Table 1.
Table 1: Records from 25/03/2020 to 17/04/2020 in Santiago. For of values SS (t), t =
1, . . . , 24, it is enough to recall that SS (t) = NS − IS (t) − RS (t).

Through application of the optim() function to solve the least-square problem (5), regarding the observed data (see Table 1), the optimal estimates for
parameters βS and γS was produced and the results summarized in Table 2.

1.08269

The RSo = 1.08269 shows that the velocity of the propagation in Santiago is
largely below the range ]1.5, 3.5[, which is the observed range for the European,
Asiatic and American countries. This means that each infected individual transmits the infection to 1.08 individual per day. In addition, this small value for RSo
somehow reflects the correct measures adopted by the government early after
the first case of infection emerged in Cape Verde, precisely at Boavista island. It
is known that as soon as the concerned disease spread across Europe, the Cape
Verde government closed the air connections with all the affected countries,
Italy being the first one, and recommended social distancing within the country. Three days after the first case in Santiago was recorded the government
declared mandatory isolation and closed all internal air and sea connections,
only allowing individuals to leave home for strictly regulated basic necessities.
The inter-island connections was (and still are as we write) also allowed only for
transporting supplies but even so, under strict regulation. All these measures
seem to have influenced the value of RSo .
Now we use the achieved optimal estimates for contact and remotion rates to
predict the propagation of COVID-19 in Santiago. It will be done by using the
ode() function from the R package “deSolve” (see Soetaert et al. [33]) to solve
the differential equations of SIR model. The produced results are summarized
in Figures 3 and 4; Figure 4 is the same as Figures 3 but with the estimated
peak of infected individuals highlighted; the estimated number for total deaths
is also highlighted in Figure 4.

Figure 4: Projection of COVID-19 in Santiago, using data from 2020-03-25 to 2020-04-17.

Figures 3 and 4 shows that the propagation will be increasing for 169 days,
reaching a peak of 3933 infected, and at that point it starts to decrease until
disappear from the Santiago. This results are achieved on the base that the
island remains isolated.
3.1.2. Boavista Island
On its turn, Boavista is small both in territory and population compared to
Santiago; its total population of NB = 19879 is

1
15

of Santiago’s population. The

first and main reason for studying the propagation of COVID-19 on this island,
and not on the rest of the other seven Islands (except Santiago), is the fact that
the first reported case in Cape Verde (on 2020-03-19) took place there. Another
reason is the fact that the reported case was related to a foreign tourist hosted
in Hotel “Riu Karamboa”, which is one of the biggest hotels in Cape Verde with
more than 500 rooms. The last reason is the fact that Boavista’s main activities
13

are all related to tourism, having more than 25 hotels for a small population of
NB = 19879 habitants, and almost all local family income sources are related
to some contractual positions with local hotels.
All the above-mentioned situations are extremely conducive to a massive
dissemination of the disease in a short period of time, and so our particular
interest in studying the propagation there.
The records for 29 days (from 2020-03-19 to 2020-04-17) of observations in
Boavista are summarized in Table 3.

As stated for the previous case, the optim() function is used to solve the
least-square problem (6), regarding the observed data (see Table 3), the optimal

As it may be seen, RB

This, therefore, indicates that the disease is spreading relatively fast in Boavista than in Santiago, but yet still below the observed range in Europe, Asia
and America. This value seems to be largely related to the on time above- mentioned government measures. This value for RB
o suggests that, in average, each
infected individual transmits the infection to 1.37 individuals per day. Next,

14

the achieved optimal estimates for contact and remotion rates will be used to
predict the propagation of COVID-19 in Boavista. It will be done by using the
ode() function to solve the differential equations of SIR model. The produced
results are summarized in Figures 5 and 6; Figure 6 is the same as Figures 5
but with the estimated peak of infected individuals highlighted. The estimated
number for total deaths is also highlighted in Figure 6.

Figures 3 and 4 suggest that the propagation will be increasing for 64 days,
reaching a peak of 818 infected people, and at that point it starts to decrease
until it disappears in Boa Vista. This results also was achieved on the basis
that the island remains isolated.
3.1.3. Cabo Verde
Now we turn to the Cape Verde in general. As previously pointed out, as
soon as the first case was reported the government strongly recommended social
distancing, while cutting the air and sea connections with the affected island,
firstly with Boavista followed by Santiago and S. Vicente, before the total lock
down on 2020-03-29. Unfortunately, even with the mandatory lock down the
government has been reporting cases in which some individuals were using small
boats to travel between the islands, mostly leaving from Boavista which was the
island with the highest risk.

The records for 29 days (from 19/03/2020 to 17/04/2020) of observations
in Cape Verde are summarized in Table 5. Recall that the total population of
Cape Verde is N = 556586.
Table 5: Records from 19/03/2020 to 17/04/2020 in Cape Verde. For of values S(t), t =
1, . . . , 29, it is enough to recall that S(t) = N − I(t) − R(t).

Applying the optim() function to the least-square problem (4) regarding the
observed data at Table 5, the optimal estimates for parameters β and γ was
produced and the results summarized in Table 6.

Figures 3 and 4 suggest that the propagation will be increasing for 89 days,
reaching a peak of 5822 infected, and at that point it starts to decrease until
it disappears from the Cape Verde. The estimated number for total deaths is
highlighted in Figure 8.

4. Discussion
The Figures 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 corroborate what is the expected trend of
an highly infectious disease like COVID-19 which has already infected almost 3
million people worldwide in less than five months. They show that the number
of infectious individuals increases up exponentially (notice that there is exponentially fast and exponentially slow) until a peak (maximum value), and then
decreases to zero, this was already ensured by Theorem 2.1 (b).
While producing this work, between 2020-04-17 and 2020-04-23, an increase
was reported in infectious number somehow consistent with our achievement,
although slightly below; this may have been due to issues related to one of the
following reasons:
• An extraordinary performance of individuals with the accomplishment of
the social distance measures;
• Some defect in conducting tests for disease screening, such as a limitation
on the number of tests and the choice of class of individuals for whom
the test are conducted. Certainly, the greater the number of individuals
screened for the disease screening the less is the probability of having
individuals with the disease without being detected.
Since the day the first case was reported up to 2020-04-22, the authorities reported having conducted tests for COVID-19 screening only 342 individuals in
the country, yet only in individuals with symptoms or those who were confirmed
to be in direct contact with infected individuals, which reveals to be extremely
limited in what concerns both the number of individuals and who the test is

19

applied to. In order to reduce as much as possible the possibility of having notdetected (unidentified) infected individuals spreading the disease, we strongly
recommend increasing the number of tests as much as possible, and extend it to
other classes such as old people, individuals with disability or comorbidities and
health professionals on the ground. We also recommend randomly screening individuals in society. Besides all this, as a complement, we strongly recommend
to continue following all the social distance measures at least up to 35 - 45 days,
and mitigate them as the number of occurrence decreases.
