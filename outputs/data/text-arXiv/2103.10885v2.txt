Abstract
Introduction: The aim of our retrospective study was to quantify the impact of Covid-19 on the spatiotemporal distribution of Emergency Medical Services (EMS) demands in Travis County, Austin, Texas and
propose a robust model to forecast Covid-19 EMS incidents in the short term to improve EMS performance.
Methods: We analyzed the number of EMS calls and daily Covid-19 hospitalization in the Austin-Travis
County area between January 1st, 2019 and December 31st, 2020. Change point detection was performed
to identify critical dates marking changes in EMS call distributions and time series regression was applied
for our prediction model.
Results: Two critical dates mark the impact of Covid-19 on EMS calls: March 17th, when the daily number
of Non-Pandemic EMS incidents dropped significantly, and May 13th, by which the daily number of EMS
calls climbed back to 75% of pre-Covid-19 demand. New daily Covid-19-hospitalization alone proves a powerful predictor of pandemic EMS calls, with an r2 value equal to 0.85.
Conclusion: The mean daily number of non-pandemic EMS demands was significantly less than the period
prior to Covid-19 pandemic. The number of EMS calls for Covid-19 symptoms can be predicted from the
daily new hospitalization of Covid-19 patients. In particular, for every 2.5 cases where EMS takes a Covid-19
patient to a hospital, 1 person is admitted.

1. Introduction
The ongoing outbreak of the respiratory disease called Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid-19) has caused
overwhelming disruptions to healthcare systems around the globe [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], especially the emergency
medical services. Researchers have conducted extensive researches on different aspects of the emergency

Services (EMS) demands and emergency department visits [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15], pre-hospital
patient assessment [16, 17], medical resource availability and allocation [18, 19, 20], personnel protective
equipment [21, 22, 23], EMS response practices and strategies [24, 25, 26, 15] and ethical considerations [27].

This paper focuses on quantifying the impact of Covid-19 on the spatiotemporal distribution of EMS
demands in Travis County, Austin, Texas. Globally, the EMS utilisation rates varied early in the Covid-19
outbreak. The number of EMS calls increased in some parts of Europe (France [28], Ankara, Turkey [13],
Copenhagen, Denmark [15]) and Saudi Arabia [12]. However, observational studies on temporal trends
suggest a significant decrease in the number of EMS calls across the United States [6, 8, 9, 29]. Our
result confirms this national trend and provide a more detailed descriptive analysis in terms of the types of
problems impacted. Nonetheless, very limited information is available after the beginning of summer 2020,
when states began to lift travel restrictions and people became better informed of the nature of the virus.
Our study suggests that since mid-May in 2020, overall non-Covid-19 EMS incidents had rebounded to a
new plateau, although still consistently lower than pre-Covid-19 period. This resonates with the pattern of
national hospital admissions in later studies [30].
Cancellation, refusal of transport and missing patient impose challenges for healthcare agencies to optimally allocate ambulances. Earlier studies in Israel found that patients’ refusal to transport rose in 2020
compared to 2019 [31]. Our study shows that while the number of EMS incidents decreased, the ratio
of defunct EMS calls in Austin (cancellation, refusal of transport, missing patient and others combined)
increased since Covid-19.
A good forecast of emergency demand is crucial in optimizing ambulance allocation and routing. The
study of forecasting models dates back to 1970s [32, 33], since which various models have been developed.

[33, 34, 35, 36] applied least squares regression analysis incorporating socio-demographic and socioeconomic
variables in Los Angeles, CA, Atlanta, GA and Dallas, TX. [37] showed that weather could also be used for
regression analysis of daily ambulance demand Hong Kong. [38] provided a Poisson regression model with
temporal, climatic, and patient factors to approximate the demand for emergency department services. [39]
proposed Winters exponential smoothing model for four counties of South Carolina. [40] found seasonal
cycles, special-day effects, and positive autocorrelation from ARIMA models applied to Calgary, Alberta.
[41] explored non-parametric singular spectrum analysis for Welsh Ambulance Service Trust. Moving beyond temporal analysis, [42, 43] produced forecast for specific areas during different times of the day using
neural networks. [44] assumed the underlying distribution as a space-time marked point process. Large-scale
datasets of spatio-temporal information at high resolutions allowed [45, 46] to predict ambulance demands
in Toronto, Canada and Melbourne, Australia implementing spatio-temporal weighted kernel density estimation.
However, these EMS models were developed under normal demands. They are unable to adapt to disasters such as the Covid-19 pandemic, where traffic patterns change and hospitals rapidly become overwhelmed.
Studies in the 2016 Melbourne thunderstorm asthma epidemic [47] discovered a positive correlation between
thunderstorm asthma cases and increased EMS demands through negative binomial time series regression
analyses. To our best knowledge, no models specifically targeting Covid-19 related EMS demands have
been proposed. However, earlier studies in France [48, 49] and Israel [50] also hinted correlations between
Covid-19 case hospitalization and Covid-19 EMS demands. In this paper, we quantify this correlation by
implementing time series regression with change point detection.
2. Methods
2.1. Data Description
We conducted a retrospective analysis of de-identified EMS incident records in Austin Travis County
from January 1st, 2019 to December 31st, 2020. For each incident, this dataset included its problem type,
call disposition and time(table 1). This dataset was extracted from City of Austin Open Data Portal. 1

The nature/problem type of the emergency.
The date of the EMS call.
When the first ambulance received notification of the emergency and is assigned, after the EMS call was picked up.
When the first ambulance wheels started to roll and is actively driving toward the emergency, after assignment.
When the first ambulance arrived at the emergency and the
wheels stopped, after dispatch.
The final disposition of the event, such as cancelled call,
transported to hospital, etc.

For our time-series analysis, the data set consists of the daily frequencies of all incidents from January
1st, 2019 to December 31st, 2020 (table 2). Defunct calls are EMS incidents whose call dispositions (table 3)
were labelled as ”Call Cancelled”, ”No Patient”, ”Other”, ”Refusal”, ”Duplicate Call”, ”False Alarm Call”
and ”Information Call Only”; admitted calls includes all other incidents. The Covid-19 hospitalization data
was requested from The University of Texas Covid-19 Modeling Consortium [51]. This dataset was also
extracted from City of Austin Open Data Portal. 2

little interrogation. The ambulance is dispatched for the police or fire
agency, etc. Once on scene, the agency gives direction to the ambulance
crew.
A refusal is when the ambulance arrives on scene and speaks with the
patient, the patient refuses medical help.
The ambulance responds to the address provided but does not find a

2.2. Overall Statistics
The demand for EMS services in the Austin-Travis County area was enormous. The total number of EMS
calls in during the 2019 to 2020 period was 246,809. On average, the 37 ambulances in Austin Travis County
responded to 338 ± 34 calls per day. The density of overall incidents was loosely correlated to population
(figure 1). EMS incidents were prevalent along I-35 highway in Austin and were most frequent at downtown
Austin. There are 6 major hospitals in Travis County: Dell Seton Medical Center, South Austin Hospital,
Saint Davids Medical Center, North Austin Hospital, Seton Medical Center, Seton Northwest Hospital
(figure 2). The two biggest hospitals, Dell Seton Medical Center and South Austin Hospital, covered 26% of
all EMS incidents, and, in summary, the 6 major hospitals took care of 47% of all EMS incidents (figure 3).
Moreover, refusal (20%), cancellation (7%), missing patient (5%) and other defunct calls posed a challenged
in optimizing EMS routing strategies.
There were 22 types of problems with the highest number of calls (> 3, 000, figure 4), which in sum
comprises 88% of total number of incidents: abdominal pain, alarm activation, altered mentation, assault,
attended patient, cardiac arrest, chest pain, community health assist, diabetic, fall, hemorrhage, injury,
Overdose, psychiatric, respiratory, seizure, sick, stroke, syncopal episode, traffic injury, unconscious and
pandemic.
On average, the EMS responses in 2019-2020 were reasonably fast (figure 5). After a EMS call was picked
up, the mean time for an ambulance assignment was 1.21 minutes and the median was 1.03 minutes. The
mean and median time for an assigned ambulance to dispatch were both 1.05 minutes. The average time it
took for a dispatched ambulance to arrive on scene was 7.14 minutes and the median was 6.1 minutes. Oneway analysis of variance (ANOVA) suggested that the mean response time varied for the 6 major hospitals
(F-test, p-value < 0.01 for assignment, dispatch and arrival, figure 10). In particular, Dell Seton Medical
Center, located at downtown Austin, outperformed other hospitals. However, the slight difference in time
may not have practical significance (table 4).
2.3. Statistical Analysis
To identify which of the 22 major problems (figure 4) were impacted by the outbreak of Covid-19
pandemic, we use student t-test with Bonferroni correction. In other words, we set the significance cut-off
at 0.05/22 = 0.002273.
To evaluate the impact of pandemic on non-pandemic incidents, we identified changes in mean and
variance (cpt.meanvar) with approximate methods (Binary Segmentation [52]) and BIC penalty assuming

underlying normal distribution. To restrict our attention to the impact of the pandemic only, we chose the
maximal number of change points as 2.
Time series regression (ARIMA) with change point detection was applied to predict pandemic EMS
incidents from Covid-19 new daily hospitalization data in Austin. First, we identified multiple change
points in the new daily hospitalization data. Specifically, we applied exact change point detection (PELT
[53]) method on variance with MBIC penalty assuming underlying normal distribution. Second, to reduce
noise, we smoothed the time series of new daily hospitalization by an average of a period of 7 days. Since
epidemiological models commonly output hospitalization forecasts as ”expected values”, which would then
be fed into our model as inputs, smoothing the new daily hospitalization is both reasonable and practical.
Next, we parsed the new daily hospitalization data into different periods in accordance with detected change
point dates by adding dummy variables. Lastly, after splitting the training(80%) and testing set (20%), we
applied stepwise selection of ARIMA models and binomial thinning [54]. To evaluate the robustness of our
model, we estimated the r2 value using smoothed daily EMS incident data to remove unnecessary random
noise. To evaluate the predictive power of our model, we estimated the mean squared error and standard
error of prediction residual using the original daily EMS incident data.

3. Results
3.1. Impact of the pandemic
Two critical dates marked the impact of Covid-19 on EMS calls (figure 6, table 5). The first date was
March 17th, around the time of the Europe travel ban. The average daily number of Non-Pandemic EMS
incidents dropped significantly, from 225.69 to 155.84.
The second critical date was May 13th, or the beginning of summer, by which the daily number of EMS
calls climbed back to a new plateau, which is about 75% of that before March 17th (169.53 versus 225.69).
In sum, the total number of non-pandemic EMS calls decreased during Covid-19 times.

Noticeably, despite the disruption of Covid-19, non-pandemic defunct calls, including refusal, cancellation, false alarm, and missing patients, constantly compromise the optimal EMS performance (figure 6,
table 5). The proportion of defunct calls rose from 35% of the overall number of non-pandemic EMS calls
in pre-Covid-19 time to 39% since summer 2020.

As for pandemic-related incidents (figure 6), the red line shows pandemic EMS calls disposed to hospitals, and the brown line shows Pandemic related defunct calls. Note that pandemic EMS calls are closely
correlated with Travis County’s daily new hospitalization numbers of Covid-19 cases, shown by the green
line. Our time-series model in the next section found that this hospitalization rate alone is a powerful factor
in predicting pandemic EMS calls.
Figure 7: EMS Response Time

To further investigate the lasting impact of the outbreak of Covid-19, we separated the timeline into three
periods: period 1, from January 1st, 2019 to March 17th, 2020 with n = 442 represents the pre-pandemic
norm; period 2, from March 18th to May 12th in 2020, represents the sudden outbreak; and period 3, after
May 13th in 2020, represents the new normal.
A closer comparison between period 1 and period 3 shows that the frequencies of only certain types of
problems have dropped, while others remain unaffected by Covid-19. Incidents including attended patient,

community health assist, fall, hemorrhage, traffic injury, altered mentation, seizure, syncopal episode, unconscious chest pain, respiratory, and sick witnessed significant decreases (table 6). However, the frequencies
of incidents of problems such as cardiac arrest, psychiatric, stroke, abdominal pain, alarm activation, assault,
injury, overdose and diabetic remained stable.
The performance of EMS response was also impacted since the outbreak of Covid-19 (figure 7, table 7).
On average, the response time was slower during period 2 and period 3 than that in period 1 (one-sided
t-test, p-value < 0.01). In particular, the arrival time during period 3 is 0.73 minutes slower than during
period 1 for each EMS incident.
3.2. Covid-hospitalization predicts pandemic EMS calls
There have been 4 Covid-19-Hospitalization stages (figure 8) since March 2020. In particular, we see
rises in Covid-19 hospitalizations during summer 2020 (June 8th - August 18th) and winter 2020 (November
5th - ). This resonated with the global pandemic second and third waves. To achieve optimal modelling
performance, we avoided the uncertainties at the earliest stage of pandemic by only fitting and testing the
model using data from 2020-04-09 to 2020-12-31.
The ARIMA(0,0,0) model for Pandemic EMS Calls was regressed on smoothed (7-day average) hospitalization data (table 8, figure 9). This model obtained an r2 value equal to 0.85. Moreover, the residual
standard error of the training and test set are 6.62 and 5.44, respectively, which mainly characterize for
the random fluctuations on daily counts. This indicates that daily new hospitalization of Covid-19 cases
alone proves a powerful and robust indicator of pandemic-related EMS demands. The 0.40 estimate of slope
suggests that on average, for every 2.5 cases where EMS takes a Covid-19 patient to a hospital, 1 person
is admitted. Moreover, compared to earlier stages, there is a smaller offset between Pandemic EMS and
hospitalization numbers.

4. Discussion
The daily number of non-pandemic EMS incidents dropped precipitously after March 17th. This resonates with earlier studies in throughout the United States (March 8, 2020) [6, 7, 9, 29], Italy [10, 55] and
England [11]. Even though the number of non-pandemic EMS incidents bounced back at the beginning of
summer, it remained consistently lower than pre-pandemic era. This significant decrease in non-pandemic
EMS incidents may partly be explained by travel restrictions (attended patient, community health assist,
fall, hemorrhage, traffic injury) and misclassification into Covid-19-cases (chest pain, respiratory, and sick).
Earlier studies also suggested that the current Covid-19 pandemic may have created a climate of fear similar
to what has been observed in other countries in Europe and Asia [7].
Previous studies reporting the patterns of EMS demands under the impact of Covid-19 in Israel [50]
suggested that the increase of EMS calls for Covid-19 symptoms followed the same shape as for confirmed
10

Figure 9: ARIMA with change point detection

Covid-19 patients. Our study confirms this intuition by quantifying the correlation between Covid-19 daily
new hospitalization and pandemic-related EMS demands. Since Covid-19 hospitalization projection models
have been investigated extensively [51, 56, 57, 58, 59], our model serves as a simple and efficient tool for EMS
departments to quickly deploy distribution strategies. Interestingly, as time progressed, the offset between
Pandemic EMS and hospitalization numbers became smaller. This could be due to people becoming better
at making informed decisions about Covid-19-related EMS Calls. At the beginning of the outbreak, due
to lack of knowledge of the epidemic, people might have made haste to raise red flags even though they
were not contaminated by Covid-19. Another possible reason was that hospitals turned down a number of
Covid-19 cases due to lack of preparation.
5. Limitations
In this study, we restricted our attention to incident numbers, without differentiating the priority levels
of each incident. The ability to identify and forecast urgent incidents may improve EMS services further.
Another limitation is that our regression model forecasts the overall number of Covid-19 EMS cases. In
practice, a more fine-grained model incorporating spatial information may help identify incident hotspots
within the city.
6. Conclusions
This study analyzed the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on EMS call distributions and response
performance. The mean daily number of non-pandemic EMS demands was significantly less than the period
prior to Covid-19 pandemic. The response time for each EMS case was sightly slower after the outbreak of
Covid-19.
Moreover, time series regression with change point detection serves as a simple and useful model to
predict pandemic EMS incidents. In particular, the daily new hospitalization of Covid-19 patients proves a
powerful predictor for the number of Covid-19-related EMS calls. In particular, for every 2.5 cases where
EMS takes a Covid-19 patient to a hospital, 1 person is admitted.

Comparison of mean response time across hospitals
Figure 10 shows the mean plot of the response time across the six major hospitals in Travis County,
Austin, Texas.
Comparison of change point locations with respect to various choices of penalty
To evaluate the impact of pandemic on non-pandemic incidents, we identified changes in mean and
variance (cpt.meanvar) with approximate methods (Binary Segmentation) and BIC penalty assuming underlying normal distribution. To restrict our attention to the impact of the pandemic only, we chose the
maximal number of change points as 2. When we allowed a greater number of change points, Binary Segmentation with both BIC penalty and SIC [60] penalty also identified the date April 8th, around which
the non-pandemic incidents began to bounce back from the lowest point. We have also tested the PELT
method, which failed to produce meaningful results. To identify changes in mean and variance, the PELT
method was sensitive to random noise and produced too many dates. When we restricted the PELT method
to variance only, it failed to identify the date March 17th.
To identify multiple change points in the new daily hospitalization data, we applied exact change point
detection (PELT) method on variance with MBIC penalty assuming underlying normal distribution. We
chose PELT on variance with MBIC penalty because it produced a relatively small number of change points,
which could help avoid overfitting. The PELT method with other types of penalties (BIC, AIC, SIC), as
well as the Binary Segmentation method, however, produced too many change points (≥ 6).
Time series regression model without change point detection
Table 9 gives the output of a single variable time series regression model. The mean squared error of
this model is 40.501, which is worse than that of our proposed model (table 8).
