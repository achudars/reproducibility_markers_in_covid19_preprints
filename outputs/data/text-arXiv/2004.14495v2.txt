ABSTRACT There has been vigorous debate on how different countries responded to the COVID-19
pandemic. To secure public safety, South Korea actively used personal information at the risk of personal
privacy whereas France encouraged voluntary cooperation at the risk of public safety. In this article, after a
brief comparison of contextual differences with France, we focus on South Korea’s approaches to
epidemiological investigations. To evaluate the issues pertaining to personal privacy and public health, we
examine the usage patterns of original data, de-identification data, and encrypted data. Our specific
proposal discusses the COVID index, which considers collective infection, outbreak intensity, availability
of medical infrastructure, and the death rate. Finally, we summarize the findings and lessons for future
research and the policy implications.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Increasingly, the integration of big data and information and
communications technology (ICT) promises enormous social
value creation. In a pandemic crisis, public safety is a top
priority. Simultaneously, we cannot ignore potential privacy
breaches. The “old” debate over personal privacy and public
security is still relevant. Since personal information is crucial
to curtail the spread of a pandemic, policymakers and
officials can more likely expect “implicit” consent. However,
in the course of pursuing compelling public purpose, privacy
rights may be at risk [1, 2, 3].
In general, any epidemiological study is subject to an
ethics review to ensure privacy [4, 5]. For a face-to-face
investigation,
investigators
respect
confidentiality
requirements. However, in view of the increasing social costs
associated with the prevention and treatment of serious
infectious diseases, there is a growing demand to gather

VOLUME XX, 2020

accurate personal information in real time. For example,
Gilbert Beebe suggested that in certain disastrous
circumstances, public interest might be a higher priority than
privacy issues [7]. The widespread flu epidemic in 2009
provided additional support for this line of reasoning. While
conducting epidemiological investigations, researchers did
not always obtain an individual's explicit consent. In the
United States, the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act (HIPAA) established the privacy rules
that set limits on the use and disclosure of any personal
health information [8], though aggregating personal
information for public health purposes is a somewhat
different matter [9].
COVID-19 is an extraordinary circumstance that poses
enormous public health risks—potentially affecting millions
of people worldwide [10, 11, 12]. Nations are at war with the
coronavirus. In this context, what does it mean to balance

1

personal privacy and public safety? What are the boundaries
and acceptable norms? This study considers these questions
and examines the actual cases of two countries—South
Korea and France. The subsequent sections of this study
proceed as follows. In Section 2, we discuss the
characteristics of the virus that causes COVID-19. We then
introduce an anti-displacement alternative to COVID-19. We
further compare the results of the French and Korean
governments’ quarantine measures against COVID-19. We
apply the STRIDE Threat Model to perform a risk analysis of
the Korean government's quarantine system. Our specific
proposal considers collective infection, outbreak intensity,
availability of medical infrastructure, and the death rate.
Based on our findings, we present lessons and implications
for future epidemiological investigations.

confidence that Korea's medical capabilities could handle any
major public health challenges. Additionally, how to assess
asymptomatic patients was determined somewhat later. For
example, a Chinese woman who arrived from Wuhan on
January 20, 2020 was identified as the first confirmed case.
Until then, foreign tourists without fever were free to enter
Korea, and there was not yet any serious effort to track
asymptomatic patients.

II. COVID-19 RESPONSES

A new type of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was first reported
in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Since then, this
respiratory infection epidemic, designated as COVID-19,
spread throughout China and worldwide. Upon infection,
after a 2- to 14-day incubation period, patients experience
respiratory symptoms including high fever (about 37.5
degrees) and cough or dyspnea [13-19]. However, it seems
that there are several cases of asymptomatic infections. On
January 21, 2020, the Chinese government officially reported
15 confirmed cases of COVID-19 [20-23]. The medical staff
involved in the incident became credible evidence of humanto-human transmission [24]. On January 30, 2020, the World
Health Organization (WHO) declared the continual spread of
this infection as an International Public Health Emergency
(PHEIC). With an accelerating rate of confirmed patients
worldwide, on March 11, 2020 the WHO declared the
COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic [25].
COVID-19 is a respiratory virus that spreads primarily
through droplets generated when an infected person coughs
or sneezes, or through droplets of saliva or discharge from
the nose. The infected patient's saliva can be transmitted
directly to another person’s eye or if a person rubs their eyes
with a virus-contaminated hand [24]. The rapid spread of
COVID-19 was expected to overwhelm limited medical
equipment and facilities with the sudden increase in the
explosive number of patients [26]. Consequently, the fight
against COVID-19 requires contact tracing for close contacts
of laboratory-confirmed or probable patients. In some
countries, these responses were compulsory, while others
implemented a voluntary system. Our study compares the
cases of France and South Korea, with special focus on the
South Korean government’s approaches in seeking the
participation of its citizens.
A. KOREAN GOVERNMENT’S APPROACH

At first, the South Korean government did not respond
appropriately by not knowing the precise nature of the
COVID-19 pandemic. The initial optimism was based on
VOLUME 8, 2020

FIGURE 1. Disease Health Integrated Management System for COVID19.

However, upon understanding the significance of
asymptomatic patients and the nature of droplet infection, the
next task was to identify the pathogens of confirmed patients.
Fig. 1 describes the essential elements of the Disease Health
Integration System (DHIMS), which collects and uses
epidemiological survey data. Local governments conduct
tests for epidemiologic investigation. Medical staff at public
health centers and diagnostic screening centers follow-up
with the confirmed patients. Local governments are
responsible for operating screening clinics through large
scale drive-through or walk-through testing sites without
harvesting virus transmission [27].
If a person tests positive, then the health or diagnostic
center immediately uploads the relevant personal information
of the patient to the DHIMS. The health or diagnostic center
immediately submits incident reports to the Korean Centers
for Disease Control (KCDC). The local government health
center also conducts an additional epidemiological
investigation. The public safety law requires that confirmed
patients disclose their recent movements and identify all
contacted persons. The local government examines a
confirmed patient’s recent usage information from mobile
phones and credit cards and uploads all information about the
contacted persons including their name, address, contact
information, date of birth, gender, disease name, diagnosis
date, age, occupation, place of residence, telephone number,
and health status, to the DHIMS. In this way, a national
database of epidemiological investigations maintains all the
relevant information of the confirmed patient and all contacts.
A diagnostic test is performed immediately for persons
with symptoms. According to the severity of the COVID-19
symptoms, the individuals are either self-quarantines or
hospitalized. Recent contacts who have no symptoms are
2

quarantined for 14 days from the contact date of the
confirmed patient. Self-quarantined individuals are
monitored daily at local government call centers. If the
additional diagnostic test after 14 days shows that the
individual is negative and he/she has no symptoms, then the
individual is released.
The Korean government implemented a COVID-19
response system with 3P (Preemptive, Prompt, and Precise)
and 3T (Trace, Test, Treat) plus P (Participate) quarantine
response model [27]. It used innovative ICT systems such as
self-isolation and diagnostic apps, drive-through and walkthrough clinics, and mobile phone location information
analysis. The Korean government also counted on voluntary
participation by citizens to develop additional app
capabilities. For example, using these aggregated
epidemiological survey databases, real time COVID-19 maps
and monitoring apps were developed to benefit society at
large.
B. FRENCH GOVERNMENT’S APPROACH

France established Public Health France (PHF) on January
13, 2020 to monitor and respond to the COVID-19 epidemic
[28, 29]. PHF’s Crisis Center monitors epidemiological
prevention, mobilizes health protection organizations,
manages the strategic resources of medical facilities, and
offers support services. The PHF conducts daily
epidemiological investigations and releases the aggregate
details including the area, gender, and age group of COVID19 patients [30, 31].
The PHF set up a surveillance system to monitor the
epidemiological and clinical aspects of COVID-19 using
urban medicine, measure the severity of the epidemic and its
impact on the medical system, and report the fatality rate.
The PHF took active preventative measures to control the
spread of COVID-19 with the aim of reducing the risk of
transmission by providing warning messages to people in
affected areas. In addition, the precautionary measures aimed
to help people maintain a better quality of life, even in social
isolation.
The PHF also supported active health-related services by
operating a remote support system. The PHF allows
healthcare professionals (e.g., doctors, nurses, pharmacists,
physical therapists, midwives, etc.) and health professionals
(managers, supervisors, health facility personnel, and
engineers) to be prepared for a request for help from the
health center. The French government implemented
quarantine measures since March 16, 2020. The PHF
monitors the behavioral responses and mental health
practices in response to these changes and assesses social
anxiety levels. Certainly, the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted
the French ways of life and restricted vital economic and
social activities. From the early days of the outbreak, the

VOLUME 8, 2020

PHF’s main challenge has been how to mobilize citizen
participation in the fight against COVID-19.
C. COMPARISONS OF FRANCE AND SOUTH KOREA

According to WHO data, the first confirmed case in South
Korea was January 20, 2020. In France, the first reported
case appeared on January 24, 2020. However, after little
more than two months, these two countries showed a marked
difference in terms of cumulative number of confirmed cases
and total deaths [25]. As Table 1 (as of June 7, 2020) reports,
the cumulative total of confirmed cases in Korea is 11,776
and 153,634 in France. The cumulative deaths are 273 and
29,143 for Korea and France, respectively.

Korea’s population is 51,269,183, and France’s population
is 65,273,512 as of June 7, 2020 [25, 32]. In France, 20% of
the population is over the age of 65, while it is about 14% in
Korea, indicating that France has many elderly people. In
addition, the number of beds per 1,000 people is 5.98 in
France and 12.27 in Korea. In general, mortality is closely
related to the number of hospital beds and the elderly
population [33, 34]. Therefore, when comparing the hospital
bed and proportion of the elderly population, more deaths
should be more likely in Korea than in France. Both
countries encouraged their citizens to join the fight against
COVID-19. Even so, France has relatively more fatalities
than Korea. These differences deserve careful analysis of
other preventive measures. In the next section, we examine
the impact of the epidemiological investigation database and
the ICT technology usage in Korea.
III. SECURITY OF THE KOREAN RESPONSE SYSTEM

It is beyond the scope of this study to describe the
development of the Korean government's quarantine system
processes and its operational mechanisms fully. For the
purpose of this research, we applied available response
guidelines released by the Korean government and explored
other documents about the quarantine system [35, 36].
A. THREAT ANALYSIS USING THE STRIDE THREAT
MODEL

We evaluated security by applying the STRIDE threat model
and examined the dynamic investigation data input and
output of the DHIMS [27, 37].

Fig. 2 shows the sequence of on-line and off-line data
collection, DHIMS storage, and third-party access. Potential
data vulnerability spots are noted (

FIGURE 2. Potential Data Vulnerabilities in the System.

ways. Despite Korea’s effective response to COVID-19
using epidemiological survey data, the entire process also
contains potential privacy violations.
Identity Spoofing: The appropriate security level of the
DHIMS system requires identity safeguarding and restricting
access to epidemiological investigation data. After
performing the basic authentication operation procedures, the
relevant medical personnel, epidemiologists, government
agencies, or civilians (i.e., third parties) are allowed to access
the epidemiological investigation database. Identity spoofing;
that is, misusing stolen identity data, is the most prevalent
security risk attack.
Data Tampering: The on-line/off-line epidemiological
data collection methods involve extensive personal
information: name, address, contact information, gender, age,
and phone number of the confirmed patient / all contacted.
The DHIMS does not automatically de-identify such
epidemiological survey data. During the data entry process,
medical personnel or epidemiologists may make mistakes or
arbitrarily change some of personal information content.
Repudiation: Because a legitimate user has access to the
input and output of epidemiological survey data from the
DHIMS, there must be sufficient correcting and checking
procedures in the processing data operation. For example,
what if the epidemiological investigation results in an offline
state do not always exactly match the epidemiological data
entered in an online state? Therefore, a repudiation option is
necessary to ensure the integrity of the epidemiological
investigation data.
Information Disclosure: The retention period for
epidemiological data in DHIMS is permanent or semipermanent. If the DHIMS has solid system security, then we
can assume that all personal information is safe. However,
when a third party requests a particular set of
epidemiological investigation data, the DHIMS is supposed
to conduct a de-identification process and offer specific
numbers instead of names [37]. However, in the course of
various information disclosures, an individual’s privacy
might not always be well-respected.

VOLUME 8, 2020

Denial of Service/ Elevation of Privilege: What might be
problematic is the fact that these epidemiological
investigation data have a legally permanent or semipermanent retention period [37]. The DHIMS quality control
measures require an application of relevant parameters (e.g.,
proper authorization and examination of usage patterns).
Without the full operation of strict safeguarding measures
when issuing permission or denial of personal information
access, serous privacy risk concerns remain.
Table 2 summarizes the various types of threat and risk
levels according to the DHIMS system access level.

B. PERSONAL PRIVACY VS. PUBLIC SAFETY

The Korean government disclosed the COVID-19
confirmatory movement paths and the addresses of
quarantined buildings and enforced two weeks of selfcontainment for all confirmed patients and their contacts. In
the early days of the epidemic, COVID-19 maps tracked the
movements of these individuals, thus raising awareness of
many people in affected areas.
In the digital age, balancing public safety and personal
privacy is still enormously challenging [38, 39, 40]. With the
rapid spread of COVID-19, unidentified aggregate
information has little value. Public safety requires the “right
to know” about the status of infection. Individuals may waive
their privacy rights for public safety when it requires
informing people about relevant COVID-19 infection
information. The question is, “For legitimate public safety
purposes, how do government authorities rightfully use
personal information?”
C. EXAMPLE OF BIG DATA USE IN THE COVID-19
PANDEMIC

From the early stage of the outbreak, the Korean government
collected detailed personal information about the confirmed
patients. Using these data (e.g., credit cards, phone number,
and address), investigators could specify the paths of
infection, conduct disaster prevention, and implement selfcontainment measures of all contacts. Such active follow-up
methods had a considerable success.
On February 18, 2020, Korea had its 31st confirmed
patient from the Shincheonji church in the Daegu area. With
the sudden increase in confirmed patients among Shincheonji
4

church members, the Korean government changed its
approach and implemented more aggressive follow-up
measures [27]. Shincheonji church, as a new religious
movement, employ somewhat controversial elements in their
recruitment of new members and the education of its existing
members. In particular, their regular mass meeting often
occurs in an enormous, enclosed hall. Hundreds of the
church’s leaders attended their international missionary
outreach gathering in Wuhan, China and returned to Korea in
January 2020. In the meantime, the number of confirmed
patients increased explosively—up to 7,513 on March 10,
2020 [41, 42, 43].
Considering the rapid virus transmission among the church
members, the Korean government took aggressive action. At
the government’s request, the Shincheonji Church provided
the social security and phone numbers of its members. Local
governments called the church members in their region,
looked for symptoms, and conducted COVID-19 tests. The
Shincheonji church ledger has more than 200,000 people.
Thus, nearly all the church’s members (about 212,000) were
contacted and examined. The Korean government used this
set of big data to prevent the COVID-19 pandemic. With the
use of this data and follow-up testing, the government
effectively contained one of the main sources of the
widespread outbreak.

D. DE-IDENTIFICATION IN EPIDEMIOLOGICAL
INVESTIGATIONS

As a proactive measure to contain and prevent the pandemic,
the Korean government used epidemiological data through
ICT. Medical testing equipment expedited massive COVID19 testing, which was instrumental in reducing mortality. It is
a public safety imperative to use personal information to
control and prevent the spread of a pandemic. Managing
personal information stored in big data sets requires
appropriate privacy protection measures. Privacy violation is
related to the use of identifiable personal information.
Therefore, an effective safeguard of personal privacy requires
the use of non-identifiable personal information. The right
type of technological support is essential for such deidentification options.
In the United States, the HIPPA set national standards for
the protection of an individual's medical records and personal
health information. It applies to health plans, health care
information centers, and health care providers that transmit
any health care transactions electronically. This rule requires
appropriate safeguards to protect the privacy of personal
health information, sets limits, and specifies the conditions
for the use and disclosure of such information without patient
consent and approval [9, 45].
However, the Korean government uses identifiable
personal information with limited restrictions, potentially
leading to serious violations of the privacy of patients and
their contacts. Securing personal information for quarantine
measures is appropriate. With respect to personal privacy, it
is important to use the information gathered for the specific
intended purpose only. Using identifiable personal
information for any other purpose is a breach of confidence
and trust. Moreover, the legal provision of keeping
quarantine investigation data either permanently or semipermanently is not reasonable at all. Requiring the deidentification of personal information and rapid-deploymentrelevant technology is an urgent need [46].
IV. ADAPTIVE EPIDEMIOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS

FIGURE 3. Comparison of cumulative deaths in South Korea and
France [44]

Fig. 3 shows a comparison of the cumulative deaths in
Korea and France. The number of deaths before and after the
COVID-19 pandemic, declared on March 11, shows a sharp
difference. As we discussed in the case of Shincheonji
church, Korea’s aggressive and extensive use of personal
information made a significant difference. The question is,
“What is the proper way to use personal information, even in
this pandemic?” Here, we consider the value of using deidentified information.

VOLUME 8, 2020

The purpose of conducting epidemiological investigations is
to understand the nature of an epidemic and determine how
to control the spread of infectious diseases for public safety
[47]. However, public safety does not justify privacy
infringement. In this section, we discuss the practical steps
epidemiological investigations can take to achieve a balance
between privacy and public health.
A. CLASSICAL TRADE-OFF BETWEEN PERSONAL
PRIVACY AND PUBLIC SAFETY

The HIPAA’s privacy rules propose two approaches to the
de-identification of personal health information: the safe
harbor method and the expert determination method [45].
The safe harbor method deletes 18 personal identification
variables such as name, social security number, contact
information, IP address, fingerprints, photographs, and

5

detailed address. The method of using experts is to process
personal information using non-identifying algorithms.
The release and forget model, the data use agreement
(DUA) model, and the enclave model are all useful to
achieve effective control in data storage and usage processes.
The general pre-sale model is to release unidentified personal
information to the public by posting data online. A DUA
establishes sharing rules between research collaborators who
are covered entities under the HIPAA privacy rule. Only
intended recipients can use certain information in a
limited data set. The closed room model maintains a safe
analytic environment that restricts unauthorized access and
the export of personal information in its original form. It is a
physical and technical control method to respond and export
[48].
It is often challenging to enhance the scientific utilization
value of data collected with de-identified personal
information. An increasing level of de-identification is
negatively related to the quality of the data and the precision
of the research results. Conversely, higher data quality and
outcome precision require lower levels of de-identification. A
greater level of personal identification is related to a higher
possibility of privacy infringement [49].
Therefore, individual researchers aiming to achieve more
precise analysis results may prefer to use the original data,
which contains identifiable personal information. On the
other hand, reputable institutions satisfy personal privacy
requirements by ensuring the anonymity of the data.

anonymizing, but designing and organizing data to be useful
and meaningful.
So then, what are the alternatives? It is time to move from
the idea of de-identification to the application of appropriate
technologies. The aim is to strike a balance between the
public use of data and personal privacy [55, 56].
Technologies such as secure multi-party computation and
homomorphic encryption are emerging. More innovations
are certainly in progress in the post-COVID-19 world of new
big data technologies and ICT applications [57, 58].
The development of these new technologies can increase
our options when dealing with infectious diseases. It is
imperative to balance personal privacy and public safety,
even in the context of COVID-19. Personal information with
individual consent may be used for specific research
purposes.

B. BALANCING PERSONAL PRIVACY AND PUBLIC
SAFETY

D. COVID INDEX FOR EPIDEMIOLOGICAL
INVESTIGATION

There are diverse approaches to data de-identification. In
general, methods to determine the level of de-identification
of personal information are known [48]. The National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) proposes a
method determined by an expert and a safe hopper method
for removing multiple identifiers [50, 51]. In recent years,
differential privacy technology that adds noise to personal
information has been attracting attention as a way to increase
privacy in big data analysis [52, 53]. This differential privacy
technique is a de-identification method that performs a kind
of pseudonymization process.
With widely available de-identification technologies, it is
difficult to prevent individuals from being re-identified from
de-identification measures. Researchers at the Imperial
College London, UK, conducted experiments with published
data from the United States, Turkey, and other countries, and
found certain attributes accurately even by using deidentified data [54]. Their machine learning model could
identify individuals with 99.98% accuracy from anonymized
data using only 15 demographic attributes (age, gender,
marital status, etc.). This research team suggests a paradigm
shift: “We need to de-identify, then move on. Anonymity is
not a property of the data set. It depends on how the person
who writes it uses it.” In other words, what matters is not
VOLUME 8, 2020

C. THE NEED FOR AN INDEX TO BALANCE PERSONAL
PRIVACY AND PUBLIC SAFETY

There has been serious debate over the value priorities of the
epidemiological investigation. Healthcare policymakers are
more likely to lean toward public safety goals. On the other
hand, safeguarding personal privacy is important from the
individual rights perspective. In this context, developing an
effective mechanism for balancing public safety and personal
privacy is important and timely. We present an index
measure for balancing criteria. Our study provides a helpful
practical tool in epidemiological investigations.

By applying the concept of DREAD modeling in security
engineering, we propose the COVID index as a method to
balance public health and privacy in epidemiological
investigations [59]. This COVID model uses five parameters:
collective infection, outbreak intensity, viral tiler,
infrastructure of medical faculties (e.g. number of medical
beds per million people), and death rates (or fatality rate).

Table 3 illustrates how adaptive epidemiological
investigations may use the COVID index. Here, C represents
collective infection, O represents the outbreak intensity, and
V represents the viral propagation power. Here, the value
indicates the minimum concentration at which the virus
infects the cell. I represents the level of medical
infrastructure. D represents the mortality rate of the virus.
The COVID index can be calculated as follows:
COVID index =
.
(1)

6

Values from 0 (low) to 5 (high) are assigned to each item.
The values of each item are summed according to Equation 1,
and the COVID index is determined as the average value of
the results. The sum with be a value from 0 to 25, and the
COVID index will therefore be a value 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. A
high COVID index suggests a significant risk of the virus's
propagation power and public health and an urgent need to
investigate the epidemiology. In this case, aggressive
epidemiological investigations should be conducted by
collecting original data. Aggressive epidemiological
investigations minimize the incidence of additional
confirmed patients from contact and suspected patients [60,
61]. Quarantine measures can rapidly contain a virus. Thus,
deploying the available medical resources has the maximum
prevention effect.
If the COVID index is greater than or equal to 2, then the
epidemiological investigation should focus on collecting and
using de-identified data. On the other hand, for a COVID
index of either 0 or 1, researchers should collect and use
encrypted data instead.
E. SUGGESTIONS TO STRENGTHEN PRIVACY IN
EPIDEMIOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS

The primary purpose of the epidemiological investigation is
to minimize contact with a confirmed patient. Thus, isolating
individuals that test positive for a disease is imperative to
prevent the occurrence and spread of infectious diseases.
Here, we suggest several practical suggestions to enhance
security in the epidemiological investigations.
First, investigators should be required to obtain a personal
consent forms and use personal information within a specific
period. In the early breakout period of COVID-19, personal
information was often collected without a proper personal
consent process. Later, a mandatory requirement to specify
the data storage period and usage patterns of personal
information was put in place. If proper consent forms are not
obtained, then the personal information collection process
should stop. All personal information stored in the database
should include the entry time and expiration date. The
investigation
system
should
automatically
delete
epidemiological survey data after the expiration date. Further
steps may also be taken to remove personal information
completely from other databases and thus guarantee personal
privacy [62].
Second, we should explore other options to use identifiable
personal information. What if de-identification is not
practical for research purposes? Personal information is
regarded as similar to the copyright concept. For the sale of
any products with copyright, a certain amount of money is
set aside to compensate the copyright holder. Similarly, it is
plausible to compensate each individual for the use of their
personal information for specific research purposes.
Third, we should address de-identification technology. An
individual from the medical field or an epidemiologist may
apply de-identification technology when storing personal
VOLUME 8, 2020

information. When the required information is collected
through off-line systems and then uploaded to a database,
then the individual under investigation should be notified to
check the accuracy and provide consent. Afterward, the
offline information should be destroyed immediately and the
individual should be notified of the destruction.
Epidemiologists should do the same when they apply deidentification technology to store personal information
collected online.
Fourth, researchers should establish conditions for third
party access. Any personal information provided to a third
party should be made available in the form of non-identifying
numbers or symbols. In case a third party need to use
identified personal information, they should require personal
consent.
Fifth, researchers should design an operating system for
personal privacy. Google and Apple recently released a
tracking system with privacy features [63, 64]. Other scholars
also introduced systems that encrypt data to ensure privacy in
applications [65, 66]. These options offer additional
safeguards for ensuring personal privacy.
Adaptive epidemiological surveys may still contain human
errors in the course of using different types of technologies,
including artificial intelligence (AI)-based epidemiological
investigation systems. Implementing the suggestions above
should aim to improve personal privacy in epidemiological
investigations. In addition, our proposed COVID index can
provide a basis for epidemiological investigations to support
efforts to balance personal privacy and public safety.
F. IMPROVING THE INTEGRITY OF OFFLINE DATA IN
EPIDEMIOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS

People issues are too often related to data integrity and
information quality. In epidemiological investigations,
offline information gathering raises questions about the
reliability. Incorrect information obtained from interviews
with patients may lead to wrong assessment and evaluation
about quarantine decisions. Therefore, it is important to
check the quality and assure the integrity of offline
epidemiological investigations. Specific security measures
we propose are to strengthen an epidemiological
investigation system. It is to cross-check the accuracy of
offline information in real time using other online
information sources (e.g., usage history of credit cards, bus
and subway transportation cards). This will enhance the
integrity of data gathering process. It will also prevent the
rapid spread of infectious diseases through monitoring of the
history of patients contacts and taking additional preventive
measures for all those affected.
V. CONCLUSION

In the COVID-19 context, the Korean government actively
used personal information and achieved fairly successful
public safety outcomes. However, that is only part of the
whole story. The extensive use of personal information may
7

also negatively impact personal privacy. Therefore, practical
safeguard measures, including clear communication of the
scope of public disclosure and the de-identification of
personal information are required. This paper examined how
to implement personal consent procedures and the
appropriate use of big data. Even in a devastating pandemic
like COVID-19, balancing personal privacy and public safety
is still very important. Future research may explore how to
prepare for other pandemic outbreaks by combining the
capabilities of governmental leadership, technological
innovation, big data use, and societal cooperation. However,
such aggressive epidemic control measures involve personal
privacy concerns. Further investigations should consider
cultural issues related to privacy and public safety in different
national contexts.
