Abstract
Accurate prediction of the transmission of epidemic diseases
such as COVID-19 is crucial for implementing effective mitigation measures. In this work, we develop a tensor method
to predict the evolution of epidemic trends for many regions
simultaneously. We construct a 3-way spatio-temporal tensor (location, attribute, time) of case counts and propose a
nonnegative tensor factorization with latent epidemiological
model regularization named STELAR. Unlike standard tensor factorization methods which cannot predict slabs ahead,
STELAR enables long-term prediction by incorporating latent temporal regularization through a system of discretetime difference equations of a widely adopted epidemiological model. We use latent instead of location/attribute-level
epidemiological dynamics to capture common epidemic profile sub-types and improve collaborative learning and prediction. We conduct experiments using both county- and statelevel COVID-19 data and show that our model can identify
interesting latent patterns of the epidemic. Finally, we evaluate the predictive ability of our method and show superior
performance compared to the baselines, achieving up to 21%
lower root mean square error and 25% lower mean absolute
error for county-level prediction.

Introduction
Pandemic diseases such as the novel coronavirus disease
(COVID-19) pose a serious threat to global public health,
economy, and daily life. Accurate epidemiological measurement, modeling, and tracking are needed to inform public health officials, government executives, policy makers,
emergency responders, and the public at large. Two types of
epidemiological modeling methods are popular today:
• Mechanistic models define a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) which capture the epidemic transmission patterns and predict the longterm trajectory of the outbreak. These models include
the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model (Kermack and McKendrick 1927), the Susceptible-ExposedInfected-Recovered (SEIR) (Cooke and Van Den Driessche 1996) and their variants e.g, SIS, SIRS, and delayed
SIR. These models have a small number of parameters

which are determined via curve fitting. These types of
models do not require much training data, but they are
quite restrictive and cannot leverage rich information.
• Machine learning models such as deep learning, model
the epidemiological trends as a set of regression problems (Yang et al. 2020; Toda 2020; He, Peng, and Sun
2020; Chimmula and Zhang 2020; Tomar and Gupta
2020). These models are able to learn the trajectory of the
outbreak only from data and can perform very well especially in short-term prediction. However, they usually
require a large amount of training data.
This paper extends Canonical Polyadic Decomposition
(CPD) (Harshman 1970) via epidemiological model (e.g.,
SIR and SEIR) regularization, which integrates spatiotemporal real-world case data and exploits the correlation
between different regions for long-term epidemic prediction.
CPD is a powerful tensor model with successful applications in many fields (Papalexakis, Faloutsos, and Sidiropoulos 2016; Sidiropoulos et al. 2017). Compared to traditional
epidemiological models which cannot incorporate fine-grain
observations or any kind of side information, tensors offer a
natural way of representing multidimensional time evolving
data and incorporate additional information (Acar, Dunlavy,
and Kolda 2009; Araujo, Ribeiro, and Faloutsos 2017). CPD
can capture the inherent correlations between the different
modes and thanks to its uniqueness properties it can extract
interpretable latent components rendering it an appealing solution for modeling and analyzing epidemic dynamics. Additionally, it can parsimoniously represent multidimensional
data and can therefore learn from limited data. These two
important properties differentiate CPD from neural networks
and deep learning models which typically require a lot of
training data and are often treated as black box models.
In this work, we propose a Spatio-temporal Tensor factorization with EpidemioLogicAl Regularization (STELAR).
STELAR combines a nonnegative CPD model with a system
of discrete-time difference equations to capture the epidemic
transmission patterns. Unlike standard tensor factorization
methods which cannot predict slabs ahead, STELAR can simultaneously forecast the evolution of the epidemic for a list
of regions, and it can also perform long-term prediction.
In the experiments, we build a spatio-temporal tensor,
location × attribute × time of case counts based on large

real-world medical claims datasets, where the first dimension corresponds to different counties/states, the second dimension corresponds to different attributes or signals that
evolve over time, such as daily new infections, deaths, number of hospitalized patients and other COVID-19 related signals, and the third is the time-window of the available signals. This spatio-temporal tensor is factorized using the proposed low-rank nonnegative tensor factorization with epidemiological model regularization STELAR. We observed
that the extracted latent time components provide intuitive
interpretation of different epidemic transmission patterns
which traditional epidemiological models such as SIR and
SEIR are lacking.
Our main contributions are summarized as follows:
• We propose STELAR, a new data-efficient tensor factorization method regularized by a disease transmission
model in the latent domain to predict future slabs. We
show that by jointly fitting a low-rank nonnegative CPD
model with an SIR model on the time factor matrix we
are able to accurately predict the evolution of epidemic
trends.
• Thanks to the uniqueness properties of the CPD, our
method produces interpretable prediction results. Specifically, the tensor is approximated via K rank-1 components, each of which is associated with a sub-type of the
epidemic transmission patterns in a given list of regions.
The latent time factor matrix includes K different patterns
of the epidemic evolution and using the latent location and
signal factor matrices we can identify the corresponding
locations and signals associated with each pattern.
• We perform extensive experimental evaluation on both
county- and state-level COVID-19 case data for 10 and
15 days-ahead prediction and show that our method outperforms standard epidemiological and machine learning
models in COVID-19 pandemic prediction. Our method
achieves up to 21% lower root mean square error and 25%
lower mean absolute error for county-level prediction.

Related Work
Many epidemiological and deep learning models have been
applied for modeling the COVID-19 pandemic evolution.
Methods based on traditional epidemic prediction models
such as SIR (Kermack and McKendrick 1927) and SEIR and
their variants (Cooke and Van Den Driessche 1996), rely on
a system of differential equations which describe the dynamics of the pandemic (Yang et al. 2020; Toda 2020; He, Peng,
and Sun 2020). These models are trained for each location
independently by curve fitting.
Machine learning approaches and specifically deep learning models treat the problem as a time series prediction problem. Given as input a time series of length Lw ,
xt−Lw −1 , . . . , xt−1 , xt , the goal is to output Lo future time
points xt+1 , xt+2 , . . . , xLo . A popular and very successful
method for time series prediction is the Long Short Term
Memory (LSTM) network (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber
1997). Recent studies have applied LSTMs for COVID-19
prediction (Chimmula and Zhang 2020; Tomar and Gupta

a type of neural network which operates on a graph. Kapoor
et al. proposed creating a graph with spatial and temporal edges. They leverage human mobility data to improve
the prediction of daily new infections (Kapoor et al. 2020).
STAN (Gao et al. 2020) is an attention-based graph convolutional network which constructs edges based on geographical proximity of the different regions and regularizes the
model predictions based on an epidemiological model.
Methods based on tensor factorization have been applied for various time series prediction tasks. CP Forecasting (Dunlavy, Kolda, and Acar 2011), is a tensor method
which computes a low-rank CPD model and uses the temporal factor to capture periodic patterns in data. TENSORCAST (Araujo, Ribeiro, and Faloutsos 2017) is a method
that forecasts time-evolving networks using coupled tensors.
Both methods are not suitable for COVID-19 pandemic prediction and rely on a two-step procedure – fitting a low-rank
model and then performing forecasting based on the temporal factor matrix – which as we will see later leads to
performance degradation relative to our joint optimization
formulation.

Epidemiological Models

Canonical Polyadic Decomposition

Epidemiological models have been popular solutions for
pandemic modeling. For example, The SIR model (Kermack and McKendrick 1927) is one of the most famous and
paradigmatic models in mathematical epidemiology. In this
model, a population is divided into susceptible, infected and
recovered subpopulations. The evolution of these quantities
is described by the following equations:

The Canonical Polyadic Decomposition (CPD) expresses a
3-way tensor X ∈ RM ×N ×L as a sum of rank-1 components, i.e.,

S(t) − S(t − 1) = −βS(t − 1)I(t − 1)/N,
(1a)
βS(t − 1)I(t − 1)
I(t) − I(t − 1) =
− γI(t − 1), (1b)
N
R(t) − R(t − 1) = γI(t − 1),
(1c)

where A = [a1 , . . . , aK ] ∈ RM ×K , B = [b1 , . . . , bK ] ∈
RN ×K , C = [c1 , . . . , cK ] ∈ RL×K . The rank K is the minimum number of components needed to synthesize X. We
can express the CPD of a tensor in many different ways. For
example, X = [[A, B, C]] can be represented by the matrix
unfolding X(1) = (C B)AT where the mode-1 fibers
are the rows of the resulting matrix. Using ‘role symmetry’, the mode-2 and mode-3 matrix unfoldings are given by
X(2) = (C A)BT , X(3) = (B A)CT respectively. CPD
can parsimoniously represent tensors of size M × N × L using only (M + N + L) × K parameters. The CPD model
has two very important properties that make it a very powerful tool for data analysis 1) it is universal, i.e., every tensor
admits a CPD of finite rank, and 2) it is unique under mild
conditions i.e., it is possible to extract the true latent factors
that synthesize X.

where S(t), I(t) and R(t) stand for the size of susceptible,
infected and recovered populations at time t, respectively
and N = S(t) + I(t) + R(t) is the total population. The
parameter β controls the rate of spread and the parameter γ
is the recovery rate, so its inverse 1/γ represents the average
time period that an infected individual remains infectious. In
Equation (1a), the quantity βS(t)/N is the fraction of susceptible individuals that will contact an infected individual
at time t. Therefore,
C(t) := βS(t)I(t)/N,

(2)

denotes the new infections at time t. In Equation (1b), γI(t)
denotes the number of individuals recovered. Therefore, the
change of the infected cases at time t will be the difference between new infected and recovered cases as shown in
Equation (1b). Given S(0), I(0) and R(0), we can compute
S(t), I(t) and R(t) for t = 1, 2, . . ., L, where L is the size
of the prediction window we are interested in. An example
is shown in Figure (1a) where we have set N = 1, S(0) =
0.95, I(0) = 0.05, R(0) = 0, β = 0.4, γ = 0.1 i.e., we have
normalized the different populations by the total population
number N and set the window size to be L = 50.
The SEIR model is a variant of the SIR model. In this
model, a population is divided into susceptible, exposed, infected and recovered subpopulations. The exposed population consists of individuals who have been infected but are
not yet infectious. The SEIR model includes an additional
parameter σ which is the rate at which the exposed individuals becoming infectious.

Method
Problem Formulation
Consider a location where we monitor N signals related to
a pandemic over time, e.g., number of new infections, hospitalized patients, intensive care unit (ICU) patients, etc. At
time t, the value of the nth signal at location m is denoted by
xm,n,t . Assuming that there are N signals, M locations and
L time points, then, the dataset can be naturally described
by a 3-way spatio-temporal tensor X ∈ RM ×N ×L , where
X(m, n, t) := xm,n,t . Tensor X includes the evolution of
all signals and regions for times 1 through L and we are interested in estimating the signals at time L+1, . . . , L+Lo . In
other words, we want to predict the frontal slabs X(:, :, t) for
Lo timesteps ahead. However, standard tensor factorization
methods cannot predict slabs ahead. It is evident from Equation 3 and the mode-3 unfolding that is impossible to impute

when an entire slab X(:, :, t) is missing since we have no information regarding the corresponding row of C. To address
this challenge, we take into consideration the transmission
law dynamics of the disease. The key idea is to decompose
the tensor using a CPD model and impose SIR constraints
on the latent time factor.
To illustrate the key idea, we perform a preliminary
experiment using a rank-5 plain nonnegative CPD on a
spatio-temporal tensor X ∈ R140×15×82 with case counts,
constructed from real COVID-19 data. As shown in Figures 1b, 1c, 1d, CPD is able to extract meaningful latent
components from the data. Specifically, the figures show 3
columns of the latent time factor C where an SIR model has
been fitted after obtaining the decomposition. We observe
that each columns depicts a curve similar to the one in Figure 1a i.e., the CPD can unveil the principal patterns of the
epidemic evolution, and each pattern corresponds to a different pandemic phase.
Therefore, we propose solving the following constrained
nonnegative CPD problem

sk , ik the initial values of the subpopulations. Using Equations (1a),(1b) and (2) we can predict “future” values for
the kth column of C. We repeat the same procedure for all
columns of C such that we can predict the entire “future”
rows. Let Ĉ(t, :) ∈ RK be the prediction of the temporal
information at a future time point t using estimates β̂, γ̂,
ŝ, î. Since A and B do not depend on t, the prediction of all
signals in the tensor at time t is given by
b :, t) = Âdiag(Ĉ(t, :)B̂T .

Adding latent temporal regularization through an SIR
model offers significant advantages compared to having separate SIR models for each location. Our model can capture
correlations between different locations and signals through
their latent representations and therefore improve the prediction accuracy. Additionally, it enables expressing the evolution of a signal as weighted sum of K separate SIR models
e.g., the prediction of the nth signal for the mth location for
time point t, is given by

Optimization
(4)

The first term is the data fitting term. We fit a CPD model
of rank-K with nonnegativity constraints on the factors. The
second term is Frobenius norm regularization which is typically used to avoid overfitting and improve generalization of
the model. We introduce a third term which regularizes each
column of the factor matrix C according to Equation (2) i.e.,
we learn K different SIR models, each of which is fully described by parameters Sk (0), Ik (0), Rk (0) and βk , γk according to Equations (1a), (1b), (1c). We aim at estimating
these parameters such that each column of C follows the
new infections curve of an SIR model. Vectors β ∈ RK and
γ ∈ RK hold the β and γ parameters of each SIR model and
vectors s =∈ RK , i ∈ RK hold the initial conditions of each
SIR model. Note that the recovered cases curve can be safely
removed because it does not affect the optimization cost and
that the parameter Nk corresponding to the total population
has been absorbed in the vector β.

Prediction
After the convergence of the above optimization algorithm, we have some estimates of Â, B̂, Ĉ and parameters
{β1 , · · · , βK }, {γ1 , · · · , γK }, {s1 , · · · , sK }, {i1 , · · · , iK }
where the pair of βk and γk describes the epidemic transmission of the kth component in the time factor matrix and

The optimization problem (4) is a nonconvex and very challenging optimization problem. To update factor matrices
A, B, C we rely on alternating optimization. Note that by
fixing all variables except for A, the resulting subproblem w.r.t. A, is a nonnegative least squares problem, which
is convex. Similarly for the factor matrices B and C. We
choose to solve each factor matrix subproblem via the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) (Gabay
and Mercier 1976), which is a very efficient algorithm that
has been successfully applied to nonnegative tensor factorization problems (Huang, Sidiropoulos, and Liavas 2016).
Let us first consider the subproblem w.r.t. A. Assume that
at the `th iteration, we have some estimates of all the variables available. Fixing all variables except for A, we have

Experiments
Dataset and Baselines
We use US county-level data from the Johns Hopkins University (JHU) (Dong, Du, and Gardner 2020) and a large
IQVIA patient claims dataset, which can be publicly accessible upon request. JHU data includes the number of active cases, confirmed cases and deaths for different counties
in the US. The total number of counties was 133. We use
the reported active cases to compute the daily new infections. The claims dataset was created from 582,2748 claims
from 732,269 COVID-19 patients from 03-24-2020 to 0626-2020 (95 days). It contains the daily counts of 12 International Classification of Diseases ICD-10 codes observed
in each county and the Current Procedural Terminology
(CPT) codes related to hospitalization and utilization of intensive care unit (ICU). The size of the constructed tensor is
133 × 15 × 95. Using this data, we also construct a tensor

which includes the aggregated data for 5 states, New York,
New Jersey, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Pennsylvania and
is of size 5 × 15 × 95.
We perform two different experiments. Initially we use
85 days for training and validation and use the remaining
Lo = 10 as the test set. In the second experiment we use 80
days for training and validation and Lo = 15 days for test.
We compare our method against the following baselines:
1. Mean. We use the mean of the last 5 days of the training
set as our prediction.
2. SIR. The susceptible-infected-removed model.
3. SEIR. The susceptible-exposed-infected-removed epidemiological model.
4. LSTM (w/o feat.) LSTM model without additional features. We use one type of time series as our input.
5. LSTM (w feat.) LSTM with additional features. We use
15 different time series as input.
6. STAN (Gao et al. 2020) A recently proposed GNN with
attention mechanism.
7. STELAR (ν = 0) The proposed method without regularization (two-step approach).
We use the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as our evaluation metrics.

Results
Table 2 shows the county-level results for 10 and 15 day
prediction for daily new infections and hospitalized patients.
For new infections and Lo = 10, our method achieves 18%

lower RMSE and 9% lower MAE compared to the best performing baselines which are the SIR and STAN model respectively. When Lo = 15 our method achieves 10% lower
RMSE and the same MAE compared to the STAN model.
For hospitalized patients and Lo = 10, our method achieves
21% lower RMSE and 12% lower MAE compared to the
best performing baseline which is STAN. When Lo = 15
our method achieves 12% lower RMSE and 25% lower
MAE compared to the best baseline. For state-level prediction of new infections, the best performing model is STAN
but for hospitalized patients our method again outperforms
all the baselines. Note that in all cases except one, joint optimization and SIR model fitting always improves the performance of our method compared to the two-step procedure.
Figure 2 shows some examples of county-level prediction.
Figure 2a shows simple case where one can observe an increasing pattern of the new infections. Almost all models
are able to capture this trend except for the LSTM (w/feat.)
model. Figure 2b shows a more challenging scenario where
it is not obvious if the curve will continue increasing but
our method makes an accurate prediction, and is better than
the baselines. Finally in Figure 2c we observe an example
where a peak was already observed in the past and therefore
SIR and SEIR models fail. On the other hand, our method is
again able to make reasonable predictions.
Finally, we demonstrate the ability of our model to produce interpretable results. We train our model on countylevel data using K = 30. After the algorithm converges we
normalize each factor matrix such that each column has unit
norm and absorb the scaling to a vector w. Using this vector,
we extract the 3 rank-1 components with the highest weights

Figure 3: The strongest 3 temporal components of a rank-30
STELAR model.

i.e., by selecting the corresponding columns of A, B, C.
Figure 3 depicts the 3 temporal profiles (columns of factor
C) that corresponds to the selected rank-1 components. We
observe that the different curves depict different stages of the
disease transmission. For example, the 1st component has
captured an initial wave of the disease, the 2nd has captured
a more recent increasing trend and the 3rd component is very
similar to the first but shifted to the right. To gain some intuition regarding the results, we sort each column of factor
matrices A (counties) and B (signals) and present the top 10
counties and top 5 signals that contribute to each one of the 3
strongest components in Tables 4, 5. We can clearly see that
the counties which correspond to the early wave (1st component) are from the states of New York and New Jersey as

we would expect. Also the 1st component is mostly associated with new infections, hospitalized patients and ICU. On
the other hand, the 3rd component which is very similar to
the 1st is associated with hospitalized patients and ICU but
not with new infections. Some counties appear in both the
1st and 3rd component which means that hospitalized patients and ICU cases started to increase (or getting reported)
slightly after the new infections were reported. Finally, the
second component depicts a later increase to the number of
infections and hospitalized patients for some counties.

Conclusion
In this paper, we propose STELAR a data efficient and interpretable method based on constrained nonnegative tensor factorization. Unlike standard tensor factorization methods, our method enables long-term prediction of future slabs
by incorporating latent epidemiological regularization. We
demonstrated the ability of our method to make accurate
predictions on real county- and state-level COVID-19 data.
Our method achieves 18% and 10% lower RMSE compared
to the best baseline, when predicting county-level daily new
infections for 10 and 15 days-ahead respectively and 21%
and 12% lower RMSE when predicting county-level hospitalized patients.
