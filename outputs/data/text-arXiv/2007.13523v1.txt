Abstract
The study carries out predictive modeling based on publicly available COVID-19 data for the
duration 01 April to 20 June 2020 pertaining to India and five of its most infected states:
Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, Gujarat, and Rajasthan using susceptible, infected, recovered,
and dead (SIRD) model. The basic reproduction number R0 is derived by exponential growth
method using RStudio package R0. The differential equations reflecting SIRD model have been
solved using Python 3.7.4 on Jupyter Notebook platform. For visualization, Python Matplotlib
3.2.1 package is used. The study offers insights on peak-date, peak number of COVID-19
infections, and end-date pertaining to India and five of its states. The results could be leveraged by
political leadership, health authorities, and industry doyens for policy planning and execution.

1. Introduction
Quantitative conjectures about spread of epidemics or pandemics based on mathematical modeling
using simulations and data analysis techniques is critical information for policy makers as well as
ordinary citizens susceptible to these viral infections. Even as the pandemic batters the whole
world, India is facing unique challenges. India imposed country-wide lock down on 24th March
2020 which continued up to 17th May 2020. On 17 May 2020 lockdown was further extended up
to 31st May 2020 with different rules for three different district zones – green, red, and orange –
created based on spread of pandemic. The lockdown in India during 25 March to 31 May 2020 has
been acknowledged as one of the most stringent in the world (Hale et al., 2020). Researchers have
also recognized the fact that but for the lockdown, the number of infected individuals in India
would have been much larger. A study done by The Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics &
Policy (CEDEP), John Hopkins, and Princeton suggests that the very first phase of 21-day
nationwide lockdown up to 14 April 2020 must have significantly slowed down the spread of
COVID-19 as compared to a lack of intervention (Schuller et al., 2020). 1st of June 2020 onwards,
the Government of India issued the notification for “Unlock 1” with emphasis on restarting
economic activities and easing of restrictions in all areas except the containment zones. The
Unlock 1 phase has started even as the cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 cases and per
day increase in confirmed cases in India (Figure 1) is still showing an upward trend. As on 20th
June 2020 the number of confirmed cases in India stood at 4,11,727 (Worldometers, 2020, June
21) with the per day increase in number of cases reaching 14,516 (WHO, 2020, June 21).
The five Indian states analyzed in this study also show an increasing trend in number of
confirmed cases. As a result, India is caught in a catch-22 situation having to choose between the
devil and the deep sea. It has come down to an argument between life and livelihood.

While the number of confirmed cases is still registering an exponential growth, the
lockdown is being eased to restart economic activities. In such a scenario, the study explores the
longevity of COVID-19 in India and five of its states using confirmed cases data and based on a
robust theoretical framework – the susceptible, infected, recovered, and dead (SIRD)
compartmental model. Our analysis is of utility to policy makers, public health authorities, and
industry leaders to prepare themselves better in the coming months in terms of healthcare resources
and restarting of economic activities. It also enlightens the common citizens regarding COVID-19
timelines so that they are mentally prepared for a self-protective lifestyle. The study, thus, fulfills
two objectives. First, we predict the COVID-19 longevity timelines for India using confirmed
3

cases time series data during 01 April to 20 June 2020 based on SIRD model. Second, we also
derive the COVID-19 longevity pattern for five most infected states which cumulatively contribute
approximately 70% cases to the India tally. These states are Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Delhi,
Gujarat, and Rajasthan. In the process, we predict the following attributes related to the COVID19 lifespan pattern of India and its states: (1) the peak-date; (2) the peak number of infections; and,
(3) the end-date.
To the best of our knowledge, no study so far has endeavored to fulfill these objectives so
comprehensively. Even though Behl and Mishra (2020) have attempted to predict lifecycle patterns
of COVID-19, our study is different from theirs on following four counts. First, our study’s
theoretical foundation is based on SIRD model whereas their study is based on susceptible,
infected, removed (SIR) model. Second, we derive the predictions based on confirmed case data
of more than two months (01 April to 20 June 2020) whereas they used the data of only one month
(01 to 30 April 2020). Moreover, it was at a time when the trend was just about beginning to exhibit
an upward trend. Third, our study predicts COVID-19 lifecycle pattern of India as a whole, along
with five of its most affected states whereas their study carried out prediction for ten most infected
states only. Fourth, unlike their study, we derive the critical parameter of basic reproduction
number R0 for India and each state separately using the exponential growth method proposed by
Wallinga and Lipsitch (2007). Even as we make a quantitative conjecture in this article regarding
the lifecycle of COVID-19, we must concede that we are not epidemiologists. We are data
scientists reporting what the data is telling us. Therefore, the results should be interpreted and used
with caution. The remaining part of the article comprises of following sections: Section 2 discusses
the conceptual framework; Section 3 describes the research method; Section 4 presents outputs of
the study, and finally; Section 5 delves upon on implications.

2. Conceptual Framework
Extant literature in Epidemiology has used various compartmental models to analyze the spread
of infectious diseases (Hethcote, 2000). The most prominent and widely used among them being
SIR model proposed by Kermack and McKendrick (1927). However, SIR model is criticized as
being too simplistic (Bhattacharya et al., 2015) and is limited by the assumption that the pandemic
is non-fatal (Miller, 2020). With the fatalities due to COVID-19 going up, it would not be suitable
to assume zero fatalities. Therefore, this study draws its theoretical moorings from the seminal
SIRD model of epidemiology for predictive modeling of COVID-19 in India. The SIRD model
has been extensively used in extant literature to model spread of epidemics, in general, and
COVID-19, in particular (e.g., Caccavo, 2020; Chatterjee et al., 2020; Fernández-Villaverde and
Jones, 2020). The SIRD model classifies individuals into four mutually exclusive compartments:
susceptible (S), infected (I), recovered (R), and dead (D). The SIRD model considers recovered
and deceased as separate compartments and, therefore, must consider the case-fatality rate. The
transition from susceptible to infected, and from infected to either recovered or dead is captured
through a series of differential equations.
ds/dt = - β (si)
di/dt = β (si) – (ύ + σ) i
dr/dt = ύ (i)
dd/dt = σ (i)
Wherein, s = S/N, i = I/N, r = R/N, and d = D/N. Here, β is the effective contact rate which captures
the proportion of susceptible population in contact that an infected individual further infects per
unit time (Hill, 2016). ύ, the removal rate, is the inverse of the expected duration of infection
(Jones, 2007). And σ is the case-fatality rate i.e. the number of infected patients who die per unit

5

of time (Miller, 2020). The other acronyms used in the equations are N, the population; S, the
number of susceptible individuals at time t; I, the number of infected individuals at time t; R, the
number of individuals who have recovered from infection at time t; and, D is the number of
deceased individuals at time t. The unit of time considered is day and therefore, all calculations
have been done on per day basis. Additionally, the population N need not necessarily be same as
the population of the state (Batista, 2020). If we consider all members of this population equally
likely to be infected, N can be considered as equal to the total susceptible population at the
beginning of time. This study is based on reported confirmed cases of COVID-19 (C). Therefore,
as C increases, the population of susceptible individuals S out of the total population N keeps
decreasing and moving away from N. The data on number of confirmed cases C includes infected,
recovered, as well as deceased individuals. The application of SIRD model is based on two
important assumptions: (1) the model is recursive and therefore, there is no possibility of a
recovered individual getting infected again; and, (2) the population is constant during the period
of study which means the birth rate and death rate, including deaths due to COVID-19, are equal
(Miller, 2020). The laws of motion with respect to COVID-19 are as depicted in Figure 2.

3. Research Design
3.1 Data
We have taken into consideration COVID-19 confirmed cases data for the duration 01 April to 20
June 2020. The time series data reports per-day wise change in the number of cases. The data
pertains to India and five of its most infected states which together contribute approximately 70%
of the cases as on 20 June 2020 – Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, Gujarat, and Rajasthan. The
state-wise time-series data was downloaded from Kaggle (Rajkumar, 2020) whereas the timeseries data pertaining to India was downloaded from Our World in Data (Roser et al., 2020). Both
sources are publicly accessible data platforms. Even though the first case in India was reported on
31 January 2020, the data prior to 1st April 2020 was not utilized to avoid getting trapped by the
noise in the data.
3.2 Methodology
The critical parameters used for predictive modeling are determined as per established procedures
(Batista, 2020; Behl and Mishra, 2020).
3.2.1 Susceptible Population (S)
The total population, denoted by N, is also equal to the population of individuals susceptible (S)
to infection at the beginning of the time period. The value of susceptible population is estimated
using the method proposed by Chatterjee et al. (2020). We have estimated the lower bound and
upper bound of susceptible population and thereafter taken an average of it. The lower bound of
susceptible population is the number of individuals infected as on 20 June 2020. On the other hand,
the upper bound has been estimated based on positivity ratio, which is derived from the ratio
between the number of infected individuals and the number of tests done. The positivity ratio is
multiplied to the actual population of the country/state to estimate the upper bound of population

7

size vulnerable to infection. The susceptible population size is estimated as the average of the
upper and lower bounds (Table I).

3.2.2 Basic Reproduction Number (R0)
An important epidemiological parameter in modeling of infectious diseases is the basic
reproduction number denoted by R0 (Bettencourt and Ribeiro, 2008). The basic reproduction
number for a pandemic in each region is determined based on the “expected number of secondary
cases produced by a single (typical) infection in a completely susceptible population” (Jones, 2007,
p. 1). Liu et al. (2020) argue that an R0 value greater than one suggests rapid transmission of the
infectious disease whereas if the value of R0 is less than one, it indicates a decreasing transmission.
For COVID-19, the World Health Organization (WHO) suggests an R0 ranging between 1.4 to 2.5
(Liu et al. 2020). Some of the other estimated range of values of R0 for different countries are: 2.6
to 3.2 for South Korea and 2.6 to 3.3 for Italy (Zhuang et al., 2020); and, 2.24 to 3.58 for China
(Zhao et al., 2020). Liu et al. (2020) did a meta-analysis of 12 studies which estimated R0 for

8

COVID-19 in various parts of the world and suggested the mean R0 value of 3.28. For this study
we estimate the value of R0 by applying exponential growth method recommended by Wallinga
and Lipsitch (2007). We used RStudio 1.3.959 (RStudio Inc., Boston, MA) package R0 1.2-6
(Obadia et al., 2012) to estimate the value of R0 for India and five of its states. The parameter case
generation time, which is required for calculation of R0, is estimated from the mean serial interval
value. The serial interval is the time gap between onset of illness in a primary and secondary case.
For COVID-19, Bi et al. (2020) estimate the mean serial interval value to be 6.3 days with a
standard deviation of 4.2 days.
3.2.3 The recovery rate (ύ)
Even as research on recovery period from COVID-19 is still in its infancy, most experts agree on
a 2 to 6-week period. World Health Organization (WHO) suggests that 80-85% of COVID-19
patients recover in about 2-weeks. This contention to a large extent is also supported by academic
research (Toda, 2020). For India, Chatterjee et al. (2020) suggest a recovery period of 12 days.
Based on the preceding discussion, we have considered a recovery period of 12 days.
3.2.4 The effective contact rate (β)
The effective contact rate, denoted by β, influences the spread of the epidemic. It is defined as per
capita “average number of effective contacts with other individual hosts per unit time” (Li et al.,
1999, p. 192). Among the three parameters of the SIRD model, this is the only parameter that is
controllable and therefore, can check the spread of epidemic (Toda, 2020). The effective contact
rate of an epidemic in a population is determined by two factors – the average rate of contact
between infected and susceptible individuals i.e. the total number of contacts per unit time, and
the transmissibility of the epidemic (Jones, 2007). The effective contact rate, rate of recovery, and
basic reproduction number of an epidemic are related to each other by the following equation, as

9

suggested in extant research (Bhattacharya et al., 2015; Jones, 2007). This equation was used to
calculate the values of effective contact rate β for India and the five states modeled in this study.
R0 = (β/ύ)

(1)

3.2.5 The case-fatality rate (σ)
The case-fatality rate σ reflects the number of infected patients who die per unit time i.e. each day.
It is related to recovery rate ύ and fraction of infected individuals who die R1 in the following
equation (Miller, 2020). The value of σ varies across the states considered and is different from
the national value.
(σ = R1*ύ/100)

(2)

4. Results
The implementation of SIRD model depends on the parameters effective contact rate (β), rate of
recovery (ύ), and the case-fatality rate (σ). The effective contact rate, in turn, depends upon the
basic reproduction number (R0) of the epidemic (Jones, 2007). We estimated the values of basic
reproduction number R0 by applying exponential growth method (Wallinga and Lipsitch, 2007)
using RStudio 1.3.959 (RStudio Inc., Boston, MA) package R0 1.2-6 (Obadia et al., 2012). The
exponential growth rate, calculated by applying exponential function to the data, of COVID-19
confirmed cases in India was found to be 1.05, 1.04, and 1.03 for April, May, and June (01-20
June), respectively. Obadia et al. (2012, p. 2) argue that “It is necessary to choose a period in the
epidemic curve over which growth is exponential.” Therefore, we choose data from April to
compute the value of the basic reproduction number. The R0 values obtained for India,
Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, Gujarat, and Rajasthan are 1.72, 1.90, 1.45, 1.62, 2.14, and 1.73,
respectively. The values obtained for R0 are within the WHO recommended range of 1.4 to 2.5
(Liu et al., 2020).

10

The recovery rate (ύ) of COVID-19 infected individuals is determined by the average
recovery period. The recovery rate is considered as inversely proportional to the recovery period
in days (Hill, 2016; Toda, 2020). Since the recovery period of COVID-19 is 12 days (Chatterjee,
2020), a uniform recovery rate of ύ = 1/12 = 0.08 is considered for India as well as all five of its
states. The value of recovery rate is expected to be constant irrespective of the geographical region.
The recovery rate obtained is used to calculate the values of effective contact rate β using equation
(1) and the case-fatality rate σ using equation (2). The values of susceptible population (S), basic
reproduction number (R0), recovery rate (ύ), effective contact rate (β), proportion of deaths among
infected individuals (R1), and case-fatality rate (σ) for India and the five states investigated are
provided in Table II.

5. Discussion and conclusion
Quantitative conjectures based on mathematical modeling play an important role in understanding
an epidemic. Drawing upon SIRD model, this study endeavors to do predictive modeling of
COVID-19 epidemic in India and five of its states: Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, Gujarat, and
Rajasthan. These are the five most infected states and account for approximately 70% of all
COVID-19 confirmed cases in India as on 20th June 2020 as per data obtained from Kaggle
(Rajkumar, 2020). It is a scientifically robust study wherein all parameters have been estimated
objectively rather than relying excessively on assumptions. We have used established tools and
techniques to arrive at our estimates. Population susceptible (S) to COVID-19 has been determined
by averaging the lower-bound and upper-bound estimates as proposed by Chatterjee et al. (2020).
The basic reproduction number (R0) has been calculated using RStudio 1.3.959 (RStudio Inc.,
Boston, MA) package R0 1.2-6 (Obadia et al., 2012) through the exponential growth method
(Wallinga and Lipsitch, 2007). The recovery rate (ύ) has been calculated from the recovery period
of COVID-19 available in extant literature (Chatterjee et al., 2020). The effective contact rate (β)
and case-fatality rate (σ) have been obtained by using equations (1) and (2), respectively. Finally,
the ordinary differential equations defining SIRD model are run on Python 3.7.4 (Van Rossum and
Drake, 2009) using the Jupyter Notebook (Kluyver et al., 2016) platform and the plots (Figure 3)
are obtained using Python Matplotlib 3.2.1 (Hunter, 2007) package.
The projections from this study throw up two interesting insights for policy makers,
industry leaders, and healthcare experts. The basic reproduction number R0 for India was found to
1.72. Even as there is considerable debate on R0, a relatively lower value of 1.72 obtained in this
study for India in comparison to global estimates (3.28 and 3.32) is an encouraging sign. Liu et al.
(2020) estimated the mean value of R0 to be around 3.28 based on a meta-analysis of twelve studies

14

conducted during 31 December 2019 to 22 January 2020. Another meta-analysis on COVID-19
R0 based on 23 studies conducted within China found the pooled estimate of R0 to be 3.32
(Alimohamadi, Taghdir, & Sepandi, 2020). This essentially means that one COVID-19 patient in
India infects lesser number of individuals in susceptible population in comparison to the global
scenario. For a more profound assessment of this very significant parameter, we further determined
the R0 values for the months of May and June (01-20 June) 2020 for India. While R0 value for
April 2020 was 1.72, it declined to 1.40 and 1.29 for May and June (01-20 June) 2020, respectively.
The evidence essentially suggests that not only the basic reproduction number of India is lower
than the global estimates, it is declining and inching closer to one with each passing month. This
could be attributed to two reasons. First, the robust policies implemented by the central and state
governments of India for prevention and contact tracing. Some of the measures are - a strict
lockdown imposed by Government of India during 25 March to 31 May 2020; large scale
awareness programme to educate citizens; and, encouraging citizens to download “Arogya Setu”,
a dedicated app with proximity information on COVID-19. Second, extant research suggests
possible greater immunity of Indians due to the various vaccination programs mandatorily
implemented in India (Banik et al., 2020). Even as R0 is still much larger than the value of 1
required for the epidemic to show signs of stagnation (Liu et al., 2020), yet it is an encouraging
sign given the large population and high population density of India.
Another interesting finding of the study is pertaining to the lower case-fatality rate σ of
India. The value of σ is determined using equation (2) and is based on R1, the fraction of infected
individuals who died. For India, R1 is 3.22% as on 20th June 2020. Whereas, Onder, Rezza, and
Brusferro (2020) suggest that the rate was 7.2% for Italy as on 17 March 2020, the fraction has
increased to 14.5% as on 20 June 2020 (Worldometer, 2020). Similarly, for USA and Brazil, two

15

of the most affected countries, the value of R1 as on 20th June 2020 stands at 5.3% and 4.7%,
respectively (Worldometer, 2020). India faces some unique demographic challenges in terms of a
very large population, high population density, and scarcity of healthcare resources. In view of
these challenges, it is very difficult on India’s part to drastically contain the spread of COVID-19.
More so when almost 80% of COVID-19 infected individuals in India are asymptomatic and may
never have been known but for contact tracing (Times of India, 2020, May 28). Therefore, India
should primarily invest its limited healthcare resources to limit R1, the fraction of infected
individuals who die.
The overall picture of COVID-19 pandemic presented by this study is that of an epidemic
which may continue to impact us all the way up to the first quarter of 2021. As WHO has rightly
pointed out, the worst of COVID-19 is yet to come since the pandemic is now in acceleration
mode. Our study also reflects this observation (Figures 1 and 3). The pandemic is likely to reach
its peak during October 2020 and may start showing signs of decline only in January 2021 in most
parts of India (Table III). While the findings are critical, the study has two limitations which should
not be overlooked. First, there is possibility of potential bias since different states have different
testing capacities and reporting jurisdictions which cannot be accounted for in the model. Second,
the model assumes that future would be a mirror image of the past. As data scientists we have
extrapolated the past with a robust theoretical framework. Given the novelty of the virus, we do
not know how some of the important epidemiological parameters like incubation period, mean
serial interval, generation time would pan out in future. The study stands out as the only study
which has projected COVID-19 confirmed cases for India with data as recent as 20th June 2020. It
would help the policy makers, public health authorities, and industry leaders to prepare themselves
better in the coming months in terms of leveraging healthcare and economic resources.
