Abstract
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has triggered a worldwide outbreak of pandemic, and
transportation services have played a key role in coronavirus transmission. Although not
crowded in a confined space like a bus or a metro car, bike sharing users will be exposed to the
bike surface and take the transmission risk. During the COVID-19 pandemic, how to meet user
demand and avoid virus spreading has become an important issue for bike sharing. Based on the
trip data of bike sharing in Nanjing, China, this study analyzes the travel demand and operation
management before and after the pandemic outbreak from the perspective of stations, users, and
bikes. Semi-logarithmic difference-in-differences model, visualization methods, and statistic
indexes are applied to explore the transportation service and risk prevention of bike sharing
during the pandemic. The results show that pandemic control strategies sharply reduced user
demand, and commuting trips decreased more significantly. Some stations around health and
religious places become more important. Men and older adults are more dependent on bike
sharing systems. Besides, the trip decrease reduces user contact and increases idle bikes. And a
new concept of user distancing is proposed to avoid transmission risk and activate idle bikes.
This study evaluates the role of shared micro-mobility during the COVID-19 pandemic, and also
inspires the blocking of viral transmission within the city.

1. Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (Gorbalenya et al., 2020). COVID-19
outbreak was first discovered in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. The confirmed cases have
been subsequently diagnosed all over the world. Because of the alarming levels of spread and
severity, the World Health Organization has characterized COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic
(World Health Organization, 2020). As of December 4, 2020, COVID-19 pandemic has caused
65,220,557 confirmed cases and 1,506,157 deaths (Johns Hopkins University, 2020). COVID-19
symptoms may appear 1-14 days after exposure to the virus, including fever, cough, and
breathlessness (China Daily, 2020). Transmission of COVID-19 can occur through droplets and
touching the surface with the coronavirus. COVID-19 poses a huge challenge for the travel
demand and service safety of urban transportation.
Different modes of urban transportation have experienced various changes and employed
different measures during the COVID-19 pandemic. With many people crowded in confined
spaces, the transmission risk through public transport is very high. There is a significant
association between acute respiratory infection and bus or tram use before symptom onset (Troko
et al., 2011). So public transport agencies require riders to wear masks (BBC News, 2020), adjust
operating services (Brown, 2020), and even shut down in many cities (Hubei Daily, 2020).
Public transport has experienced a sharp decline of trip amount, such as the 80% decrease of
public transport travel in Budapest, Hungary (Bucsky, 2020). Besides, ride-sharing and taxi
could be high-risk environments for virus transmission. In addition to mask-wearing requirement
and exchanging critical information (World Economic Forum, 2020), plastic protective films are
also installed in cars (China News, 2020).
Shared micro-mobility (SMM) is the latest trend of urban transportation, and bike sharing is the
core component of SMM. The SMM refers to shared-use fleets of small, manually or electrically
powered vehicles (National Association of City Transportation Officials, 2020). Examples
include electric scooter sharing, station-based bike sharing (SBBS), dockless bike sharing (DBS),
and electric bike sharing. The SMM plays a key role in urban transportation amidst this
pandemic. Unlike public transport and taxi, bike sharing provides services in open spaces and
causes fewer safety concerns. During the COVID-19 shutdown period, bike sharing in Wuhan
became the most frequently used travel mode and provided healthcare staff essential mobility
services (CNR News, 2020). However, some cities and companies still stopped SMM services
after the outbreak because of the safety concerns about virus transmission. Lime and Bird
suspended their services of bike sharing and electric scooter sharing in many cities worldwide
(Plautz, 2020; Gauquelin, 2020). The SMM faces a tough trade-off between operational service
and health safety during COVID-19.

Hua, et al.

COVID-19 has caused a global health crisis in the past months, and transportation service has
been profoundly affected as a result. However, there are very few studies exploring the role of
bike sharing during the pandemic. And pandemic control measures on urban transportation still
lack research. Furthermore, the outbreak coincided with the 2020 Chinese New Year (CNY)
holiday, making it difficult to assess the impact of the pandemic on bike sharing. This paper
estimates the travel demand and transmission risk of bike sharing during COVID-19 with the trip
data of Nanjing Public Bicycle. This paper aims to help promote the SMM operation and reduce
virus transmission risk, by comprehensively analyzing bike sharing service from multiple
perspectives of users, stations, and bikes. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first
paper focusing on both user demand and transmission risk of bike sharing during the COVID-19
pandemic.
This paper is divided into seven sections. Following this introduction, the second section
presents the literature review about COVID-19 and transportation. The third section describes the
data sources and processing procedures. The fourth and fifth sections present the travel demand
change based on station and user perspectives. The sixth section analyzes the COVID-19
transmission risk through shared bikes. In the end, the last section presents the conclusion and
discussion.

2. Literature review
2.1. COVID-19 and transportation
COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, which is generally susceptible to the whole population but
more dangerous for weaker people. During hospital admission, the main diagnosis of patients is
pneumonia, followed by Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and shock (Guan et al.,
2020). Using a 14-day-delay adjusted estimation, the mortality rate of COVID-19 is 5.7% (Baud
et al., 2020). Compared with survivors, the deaths are more likely to have chronic medical
illnesses and are older (Yang et al., 2020). Based on the integration of extensive travel data and
reliable infection data, the basic reproductive number R0 is adjusted to be 5.7 (Sanche et al.,
2020). The communicable period of COVID-19 patients could be up to 21 days, and
asymptomatic virus carriers have non-negligible transmission potential (Hu et al., 2020).
SARS-CoV-2 could remain infectious in aerosol for hours and on the surfaces of stainless steel
and plastic for up to 3 days (van Doremalen et al., 2020).
Pandemic control strategies have been applied to contain and mitigate the COVID-19 outbreak.
These measures include quarantine of infected cases, self-isolation, social distancing (Chen et al.,
2020), cleaning touched surfaces, and wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) such as
masks and gloves. Highly effective contact tracing and case isolation is enough to control
COVID-19 outbreak in most scenarios (Hellewell et al., 2020). The social distancing strategy
2

Hua, et al.

could be effective to reduce transmission and mitigate pandemic (Fong et al., 2020).
Transportation services are the key factors that lead to the rapid spread of COVID-19, and
restricting transportation strategy is useful in slowing the pandemic spreading. Zhang et al. (2020)
find that frequencies of high-speed trains and air flight services out of Wuhan are significantly
related to the amount of infected cases. Because of the strong relationship between aviation
services and pandemic spreading, air travel data are used to estimate the true size of Italian
outbreak (Tuite et al., 2020). Chinazzi et al. (2020) confirm that international travel restrictions
slow virus spreading around the globe. Tian et al. (2020) find that suspending public transport is
related to the reduction of COVID-19 cases.
There have been some exploratory studies about the impacts of COVID-19 on transportation, but
urban transportation and shared mobility are rarely considered. Suau-Sanchez et al., (2020)
discover that the impact of COVID-19 on international air transport has been stronger than that
on domestic airlines. Loske (2020) finds that the increasing freight volume for dry products in
retail logistics depends on the increase of infected cases. Mogaji (2020) recognizes that
transportation in Lagos, Nigeria were affected by this pandemic, including increased travel cost,
shortage of travel mode, and traffic congestion.
Some studies have discussed transportation service supply during COVID-19 from a qualitative
perspective. Budd and Ison (2020) propose the concept of Responsible Transport for
post-COVID management, and stress that the individuals should assess the risk of their trips and
take action accordingly. Musselwhite et al. (2020) suggest that reducing hypermobility of the
transportation network and focussing on local connectivity could address virus threat. De Vos
(2020) recommends cycling can maintain satisfactory levels of health and wellbeing, and active
travel should be encouraged to cope with the problems of social isolation and limited physical
activity.
Existing research between COVID-19 and transportation still has many gaps, and several
questions need to be answered. COVID-19 can be transmitted through aerosol and surface, so
bike sharing in open spaces is much safer than public transport and taxi in confined spaces. Bike
sharing increases its modal share among all travel modes and provides critical mobility services
during the outbreak. There are very few studies focusing on SMM amidst the pandemic. And the
transmission risk through these shared vehicles has not been evaluated quantitatively.
2.2. Bike sharing
Extensive studies have explored improving the planning and operation of bike sharing, to
provide better services for users. Previous studies about bike sharing can be generally classified
into three categories: (1) user demand; (2) bike rebalancing; (3) parking allocation.
3

Hua, et al.

User demand is the base of service improvement, and user demand studies are mainly done
through questionnaire surveys or trip data. Some studies focus on user behavior of bike sharing,
such as the factors affecting demand (El-Assi et al. 2017; Wang et al. 2018; Kaplan et al., 2018;
Biehl et al., 2019; Ma et al. 2020). McKenzie (2019) compares electric scooter sharing and bike
sharing in Washington, D.C., and found that bike sharing is primarily used for commuting but
electric scooter sharing is not. Demand prediction is also a key part of bike sharing research. The
traditional regression models (Faghih-Imani et al. 2017; Almannaa et al. 2020) and the novel
machine learning methods (Xu et al. 2018; Li and Zheng 2020) are both used in predicting bike
sharing demand.
Bike rebalancing is to ensure that users can have bikes for riding and spaces for parking,
including truck rebalancing and user incentive rebalancing. Truck rebalancing has two types:
dynamic truck rebalancing and static truck rebalancing. Static truck rebalancing is a static
vehicle routing problem using trucks to rebalance bikes (Ho and Szeto 2017; Bruck et al. 2019;
Huang et al. 2020). And dynamic truck rebalancing is a dynamic vehicle routing problem
(Caggiani et al. 2018; Agussurja et al. 2019; Tian et al. 2020b). User incentive rebalancing also
attracted wide attention, encouraging users to rebalance bikes with monetary incentives (Haider
et al. 2018; Zhang et al. 2019a; Duan and Wu 2019).
In SBBS, parking allocation is station planning and dock allocation, which is an optimal
programming problem (Lin et al. 2018; Loidl et al. 2019; Caggiani et al. 2019; Soriguera and
Jiménez-Meroño 2020). In DBS, parking allocation is where and how many park spaces should
be allocated. Some studies detect the parking hotpots of DBS with machine learning methods,
but the amount of parking spaces in each place is not solved well (Liu et al. 2018; Zhang et al.
2019). Hua et al. (2020) apply clustering of DBS trips to identify virtual stations, then recognize
the maximum bike number in a day as the suitable amount of parking spaces in each station,
finding that a DBS bike requires about 1.2 parking spaces.
Most existing studies on bicycle sharing are about normal operation, and there are only very few
papers focusing on bike sharing amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. Teixeira and Lopes (2020) find
the possible evidence on a modal transfer from the subway to bike sharing in New York City
during COVID-19. Nikiforiadis et al. (2020) conduct a questionnaire survey of 223 people in
Thessaloniki, Greece, and the results show that COVID-19 will not affect the user amount of
bike sharing. The user demand and operational service of bike sharing during the COVID-19
pandemic remains to be studied.

Hua, et al.

Nanjing is the capital of Jiangsu Province and one of the super-large cities in China. This city has
a population of 8.5 million, and a city area of 782.3 square kilometers. Nanjing Public Bicycle
(NPB) started the SBBS service in 2013. As of February 2020, NPB had 53,200 bikes and 1,500
stations in operation. Nanjing has three DBS companies including Mobike, Didibike, and
Hellobike, with a total of 350,600 free-floating bikes. The visualization of the service supply of
bike sharing is shown in Figure 1. The DBS distribution is based on the position of each DBS
bike at midnight. The distribution of NPB stations and DBS bikes coincides, except for some
locations in the suburban area.
In Nanjing, the first covid-19 case was found on January 23, 2020. The last case in Nanjing was
found on February 18, 2020, and there has been no case since then. Nanjing’s urban
transportation suffered the biggest impact in February 2020, and the monthly trips compared
with 2019 falling by 90.6% in metro, 93.0% in bus, and 90.3% in taxi. The trip decline is
consistent with people’s extreme concern about levels of hygiene on public transport (Beck and
Hensher, 2020). After February, Nanjing’s urban transportation gradually recovered. In October
2020, the monthly trips compared with 2019 falling by 12.4% in metro, 27.8% in bus, and 12.4%
in taxi. For Nanjing, February 2020 is the most critical and most affected month during the
COVID-19 pandemic.

Hua, et al.

Four years of SBBS trip data from March 2016 to February 2020 is provided by Nanjing Public
Bicycle Company Limited. The raw SBBS dataset has 146.7 million trip records, with a file size
of 19.9 GB. The fields of NPB trip data include: user ID, bike ID, departure time, arrival time,
origin station, and destination station. The personal data of all 590,500 users during the four
years were also provided, including user ID, gender, and age. The personal data are anonymized
after data desensitization. Besides, the station list displays station name, latitude, and longitude.
The latitude and longitude of NPB stations use the WGS-84 coordinate system.
Three kinds of defective SBBS trip data are eliminated. Data defects include (1) 2.5 million trip
records that have no user ID, (2) 1.1 million trip records, of which the origin station is outside
the station list, (3) 0.1 million trip records, of which the departure time or arrival time do not
have the time precision to a second. After the data cleaning, 143.0 million SBBS trips are
extracted for the analysis.
Four weeks of DBS trip data is provided by Nanjing Transportation Bureau. The two fortnights
consist of two weeks in January 2020 and two weeks in February 2020. The raw DBS dataset has
4.8 million trip records, with a file size of 598 MB. The fields of DBS trip data include: bike ID,
company ID, departure time, arrival time, origin longitude, origin latitude, destination longitude,
and destination latitude. The personal information of DBS users was not provided.
Three kinds of defective DBS trip data are removed. (1) The departure time or arrival time of
954,000 records is missing. (2) The origins or destinations of 269,000 records are missing. (3)
The origins or destinations of 2,000 records are not in Nanjing. Finally, 3.5 million DBS trips are
used in the study.
Points of interest (POI) data were crawled from Auto Navi Map to explore the relationship
between land use and bike sharing. Auto Navi Map is one of the most popular digital map
companies in China. There are 65,848 POIs in the crawled data, including: company (43,225),
school (3,946), residence (7,906), shopping (3,077), scenery (2,683), religion (318), health
(4,693). Health POIs are subdivided into five categories: general hospital (380), specialty
hospital (615), community hospital (1,520), animal hospital (318), and pharmacy (1,860).
3.2. Development period of bike sharing
Under the influence of various factors, the operation status of bike sharing is constantly changing.
The monthly trip and user amounts of SBBS in Nanjing are shown in Figure 2. The four years
are accordingly divided into four development periods: (1) SBBS expanding period, from March
2016 to February 2017; (2) DBS shock period, from March 2017 to August 2017; (3) stable
period, from September 2017 to December 2019; (4) COVID-19 shock period, from January
2020 to February 2020.
6

Hua, et al.

In SBBS expanding period, user demand for SBBS travel grew rapidly, with a substantial
increase in supply facilities. During that period, bike amount increased from 28,000 to 39,000
with an increase rate of 39%, and trip amount increased by an average of 122,800 per month.
Increasing the supply of bikes and stations has a positive effect on promoting travel demand for
bike sharing. In the DBS shock period, SBBS suffered strong competition from DBS. There was
a significant decline in SBBS travel demand after the DBS promotion. In August 2017, Nanjing
government banned allocating new DBS bikes because of bike over-supply, and then the SBBS
operation has stabilized. In the stable period, SBBS survived the tide of DBS and still met
extensive user demand. For example, SBBS attracted 323,600 users and generated 29.6 million
trips in 2019. Besides, user demand is mainly affected by seasonal factors. User demand in
spring and fall is the highest, and user demand in summer is lower. User demand in winter is the
lowest because of the cold weather and the CNY holiday.
COVID-19 has a huge impact on bike sharing services. The amounts of trip and user have
decreased significantly, and the decline was much greater than that in previous winters. The
detailed analysis will be explained in the subsequent sections.

Figure 2. Development period of bike sharing in Nanjing.
3.3. Study period and spatial object
On January 20, 2020, Professor Nanshan Zhong, the leader of the high-level expert group of
China’s National Health Commission, affirmed the person-to-person transmission of
7

Hua, et al.

SARS-CoV-2 (The Beijing News, 2020). The news immediately had a widespread impact in
China. Jiangsu Province initiated a first-level response to public health emergencies, which
lasted from January 25, 2020 to February 24, 2020. And 2020 CNY was January 25, 2020, which
coincides with the COVID-19 outbreak. The impacts of COVID-19 and CNY need to be
distinguished.
The detailed study period and corresponding trip amount are shown in Table 1. February 2020 is
the most critical and most affected month, so the study period of COVID-19 impact is the
post-period 2020/2/2-2020/2/15. The pre-period 2020/1/5-2020/1/18 will serve as the benchmark
before the outbreak. In the pre-period, there is no COVID-19 case found in Nanjing; in the
post-period, there are many COVID-19 cases found in Nanjing almost every day.
The post-period is the second and third weeks after the 2020 CNY, and the pre-period is the
second and third weeks before the 2020 CNY. The data analysis of previous years’ trips shows
that travel demand would decrease before and after a week of the CNY, so the CNY impact can
be ignored in the pre-period and post-period. Therefore, the pre-period and post-period are
suitable for the before and after study of COVID-19 in Nanjing. Besides, the corresponding
periods of 2017 are also analyzed to consider seasonal factors, because the weather conditions
around 2017 CNY and 2019 CNY are similar.

The spatial object of SBBS is the NPB station. The spatial object of DBS is the virtual station.
Voronoi diagrams and buffer are combined to identify DBS virtual stations. Voronoi diagram of a
given set of sites is the partition of a plane into regions close to each site. Firstly, the DBS
service in Nanjing is partitioned into Voronoi regions centered by NPB stations. Then 250-m
buffer of each NPB station and the corresponding Voronoi region are fused to get the intersection,
which is the service area of each NPB station and corresponding virtual station. The service area
of all stations is only 16% of Nanjing city area, but 70% of DBS trips are covered. It indicates
that virtual station results are the suitable space objects of DBS analysis. The spatial distribution
of virtual stations is shown in Figure 3(b).

4. Demand analysis: station perspective
4.1. Trip decline at station level
The difference-in-differences (DID) model is one of the most powerful and popular methods to
evaluate the impact of extraordinary events and policy implementations. To estimate the
influence of COVID-19 on SBBS trip, the traditional DID model and the semi-logarithmic DID
model are both applied in the data analysis. The traditional DID model is represented in Equation
(1), and the semi-logarithmic DID model is represented in Equation (2). The comparison of
before-after periods and treatment-control groups are combined in the empirical methodology.
CNY is the basis for judging the before or after period. 2017 observations are used as a control
group, and 2020 observations are a treatment group.

where the dependent variable Yt is the daily trip of Nanjing SBBS (in 1,000 trips), and the
dependent variable lnYt is the logarithm of the daily trip. The vector ϕt is a set of time-related
dummy variables reflecting the time-varying trend, including the distance to CNY and the day of
week. Parameter β is a treatment group effect of different years. The dummy variable Year is
defined as 1 for 2020 observations, and 0 for 2017 observations. Parameter δ is the post-period
effect after CNY. The dummy variable Post is defined as 1 for post-period after CNY, and 0 for
pre-period before CNY. Parameter γ captures the impact of COVID-19 outbreak on SBBS trip.
The Semi-logarithmic DID model is found to be better than the traditional DID model. Because
R-squared of semi-logarithmic DID model with 0.964 is large than that of traditional DID model
with 0.931. In the estimated results of the semi-logarithmic DID model, the estimated values of β,
δ, and γ are -1.079, -0.060, -1.289 respectively. The impact of different events on SBBS trips
could be estimated by the values of these parameters. The SBBS trips in 2020 decreased by 66%
compared to 2017, which can be interpreted as the DBS shock. The post-period effect after CNY
would reduce SBBS trips by 6%. The most important finding is that the SBBS trips in Nanjing
fell by 72% because of the COVID-19 impact. COVID-19 outbreak is the biggest challenge for
SBBS during the four-year operation, followed by the DBS impact.
The semi-logarithmic DID model of i-th SBBS station is represented in Equation (3). Decrease
rate of trip amount is the negative value of relative deviation between actual value during
COVID-19 outbreak and expected value assuming no COVID-19. Due to the lack of 2017 DBS
data, the formulas for calculating the decrease rate of SBBS and DBS are different. The expected
trips of the SBBS station assuming no COVID-19 are represented in Equation (4). The expected
9

Hua, et al.

trips of the DBS virtual station assuming no COVID-19 are the trips in the fortnight before 2020
CNY. The decrease rate of SBBS trip di is represented in Equation (5), and the decrease rate of
DBS trip vi is represented in Equation (6).

where lnYi,t is the logarithm of SBBS trip in i-th station. Other variables and parameters in
Equation (3) are similar to those in Equation (1), except αi capturing the individual fixed effects
at the station level. For the i-th station, yi,2020post is the expected amount of SBBS trips assuming
no COVID-19, and Yi,2020post is the actual value of SBBS trips. Xi,2020pre is the expected value of
DBS trips assuming no COVID-19, and Xi,2020post is the actual value of DBS trips.
The decrease rate of SBBS station trip during the COVID-19 outbreak is shown in Figure 3(a).
SBBS trips at all stations have declined to varying degrees, and most stations have experienced a
trip drop of around 70%. Xuanwu, Gulou, and Qinhuai districts are close to the city center and
are the urban area of Nanjing. Qixia, Jianye, and Yuhua districts are suburban areas. Jianye and
Qixia districts are the regions hit hardest by the pandemic. The station ratio with a high decrease
rate in suburban areas is much larger than that in urban areas. Urban area is relatively less
impacted by COVID-19, and suburban area is relatively more impacted. But there are some hot
spots in the suburban area with a lower decrease rate.
Because of the COVID-19 impact, the DBS trip in Nanjing fell by 82%, which is larger than that
of SBBS (72%). And 78% of DBS virtual stations’ decrease rate is higher than the corresponding
SBBS station. DBS is more severely affected by the pandemic than SBBS in most regions. As
shown in Figure 3(b), DBS trips at all virtual stations have declined to varying degrees. DBS in
the Jianye district is hit hardest by the pandemic among all districts. The DBS virtual stations
with a high decreased rate coincide with the metro route, which shows that the integrated trip
mode of bike-sharing-metro has been greatly affected by the pandemic. Because the metro is a
confined space and has a higher transmission risk, the public is not prone to take a metro. The
major role of bike sharing in urban transportation has changed from cooperating with public
transport to independently providing mobility services.

4.2. Land use and travel change
Land use could be represented by the distribution of POIs, which is closely related to travel
purpose. The POI index is defined as the average amount of each type of POI near each trip, as
shown in Equation (7). The POI index is proposed to show the relationship between travel
demand and land use. The changes in POI index before and after the COVID-19 outbreak can
reflect changes in the travel purpose of bike sharing users. For example, a decrease in the
company POI index indicates that users are less likely to use bike sharing services for
commuting.

where Ik is the POI index of k-th type, Y is all trips, Oy and Dy are the y-th trip’s origin station
and destination station, pk(S) is the amount of k-th type of POI at the service area of station S.
According to the POI index results in Table 2, the SBBS user’s travel demand for commuting has
decreased significantly, and the DBS user’s travel demand for commuting and school has
decreased significantly. SBBS’s school trips increase and DBS’s school trips decrease. Many
school-related SBBS users may be school staff who still work during the outbreak, while the
school-related DBS users are students and parents who need not go to school. The travel demand
of SBBS and DBS for shopping and scenery has increased slightly. In both SBBS and DBS
systems, the travel demand for health, religion, and residence has increased significantly. So
areas near residential, religious, and health POI require more frequent disinfection by bike
sharing companies. Besides, the residential POI index is about leaving or returning home, and its
increase indicates a decrease in the diversification of travel purposes.
Healthcare service is very important during the pandemic. In both SBBS and DBS systems, the
travel demand for pharmacy (buying medicines) has increased the most during the COVID-19.
The increase of travel demand for community hospital is the second-highest for SBBS, and the
increase of travel demand for specialized hospital is the second-highest for DBS. Travel change
near the animal hospital is relatively insignificant. General hospital has a fever clinic and usually
is crowded with many people, so higher transmission concerns have led to smaller increases in
travel demand. Areas near hospitals or pharmacies should receive key guarantees for service
supply and bike disinfection.

5. Demand analysis: user perspective
5.1. Travel characteristics
The travel characteristic indexes of bike sharing are shown in Table 3. The number of SBBS
users has dropped by 67%, and the travel frequency of remained SBBS users has decreased by
12%. The main reason is that the social distancing strategy encourages people to stay at home as
much as possible in response to the pandemic. But the decrease in travel frequency does not
mean that bike sharing has become less important. Before and after the COVID-19 outbreak, the
daily trips of Nanjing Metro fell from 3,172,000 (pre-period) to 156,000 (post-period), with a
drop of 95%. And bike sharing trips in Nanjing only fell by 72% for SBBS and 82% for DBS.
Considering the higher decrease rate of other transport modes, bike sharing has played a more
important role in emergency services of urban transportation.
The average travel distance of SBBS increased by 32%, and the average travel distance of DBS
13

Hua, et al.

increased by 16%. Public transport such as metro and bus is a confined space and has a higher
transmission risk. As a response strategy, public transport in Nanjing has reduced departure
frequency and shortened service time. Therefore, some long-distance travel demands are satisfied
by bike sharing especially SBBS. This also confirms the previous finding that bike-sharing-metro
mode declined because of the COVID-19 impact. A possible reason for this trip decline is that
most bike-sharing-metro trips are for commuting purposes (Ma et al., 2018) but commuting is
greatly impacted by the pandemic. Travel time increased accordingly, and there is little change in
travel speed before and after the outbreak. DBS trips are faster than SBBS trips, because DBS
users are younger than SBBS users. Almost every person wears PPE such as a mask during the
pandemic, but wearing PPE did not significantly reduce the travel speed of bike sharing.
Network density is the ratio of the actual number of connections (origin-destination pairs) to all
possible connections (Wise, 2014). Degree is the actual number of connections of each station
(Saberi et al., 2018). Network density (value range is 0-1) and average degree can be used to
show the network connectivity of user travel. The larger network density, the higher network
connectivity. Network density of SBBS and DBS decreased by 45% and 43% respectively,
reflecting that network connectivity of user travel experienced a great decline.

* Due to the lack of DBS user information, user amount and travel frequency of DBS are blank.
The temporal characteristics of bike sharing trips are shown in Figure 4. There are significant
morning peak and evening peak for bicycle sharing before the pandemic. The morning peak is 7
am to 9 am and the evening peak is 5 pm to 7 pm. These peaks became less obvious during the
pandemic, reflecting a huge decrease in commuting travel. The peak phenomenon of DBS is
14

Hua, et al.

more significant than that of SBBS before the outbreak, indicating that commuting travel
accounts for a larger proportion of DBS trips. After the outbreak, the temporal characteristics of
DBS and SBBS become similar. So DBS is more affected by COVID-19 than SBBS. No matter
before or after the outbreak, the travel demand on weekdays is higher than the travel demand on
weekends. It should be noted that the vertical axis of the four subgraphs in Fig. 4 are different,
and the colors of each sub-graph cannot be compared with the others. For example, although the
color of Figure 4 (a) is lighter than that of Figure 4 (b), the trip amount of SBBS 2020 pre is
much higher than that of SBBS 2020 post.

5.2. Gender and age group
Due to the lack of DBS user information, the analysis of gender and age focus on SBBS user
travel. The travel speed of males (7.6 km/h) and females (7.2 km/h) has not been changed by the
pandemic. The bike sharing users are divided into five age groups: teenage (13-18 years old),
youth adult (19-28 years old), adult (29-39 years old), middle age (40-59 years old), the elderly
15

Hua, et al.

(≥60 years old). The female and male trips of different ages are shown in Figure 5. Before the
COVID-19 outbreak, the trips of females and males are roughly equal, except that the elderly
trips of females are less than that of males. But the middle age trips of females are also less than
that of male after the outbreak. The female trip proportion in all trips fell from 47% to 43%,
which shows that women are more affected by the pandemic than men. It also means that men
are more dependent on bike sharing than women.

Figure 5. The SBBS trip amount in relation to gender and age.
The SBBS travel changes for different age groups are shown in Table 4. The proportion of
teenage users is the lowest, and their travel demands are also the hardest hit by the COVID-19.
The user proportion of youth adult and adult have slightly decreased, and the decline in their
travel demand is relatively small. The proportion of middle-aged and elderly users has increased,
and their trip amount has been least affected by the pandemic. The travel frequency of middle
age and the elderly are also highest during the pandemic. These findings show that middle-aged
and elderly people are the key groups of SBBS users and have a strong dependence on bike
sharing services. Middle-aged and elderly users should get more attention from bike sharing
companies, especially elderly users who are more susceptible and vulnerable to the coronavirus.

The POI index is used to analyze the relationship between land use and the SBBS trips of various
age groups. The relative deviation of the POI index is shown in Table 5. The importance of
shopping and health especially pharmacy has increased significantly in trips of all age groups,
while the importance of commuting travel has decreased significantly in all age groups. Teenage
users have significantly reduced travel for school, scenery, and religion, but other age groups
have increased travel for these purposes. During the pandemic, teenagers avoid going to general
hospitals and specialized hospitals, which may result from parents’ safety concerns. The travel
purposes of youth adult and adult users are greatly affected by COVID-19. But the travel
purposes of middle age and elderly users are less affected by the pandemic.

6. Risk analysis: bike perspective
6.1. Transmission risk and bike usage interval
Unlike the confined space of metro or car, bike sharing service is provided in the open space. So
the main concern of virus transmission risk is the close contact by touching the bike surface.
Bike usage interval is defined as the time interval between former user travel and latter user
travel of the same bike, which also is the time interval of user contact. According to this
definition, the amount of bike usage interval is equal to the amount of user contact. Bike usage
interval can be used to characterize the user contact and the transmission risk.
During the COVID-19, SBBS bike turnover rate decreased from 1.7 trips per day to 0.8 trips per
day, and DBS bike turnover rate decreased from 1.0 trips per day to 0.4 trips per day. The
decrease of bike turnover rate directly leads to the duration increase and amount decrease of bike
usage interval. After the COVID-19 outbreak, the average value of SBBS bike usage interval
increased from 8.7 hours to 14.4 hours, and the average value of DBS bike usage interval
increased from 12.5 hours to 23.7 hours. The daily amount of SBBS user contact decreased from
46,600 times to 11,700 times, and the daily amount of DBS user contact decreased from 199,400
times to 31,200 times. The user contact of all companies in Nanjing is 42,900 times per day.
Nanjing has four bike sharing companies, NPB, Mobike, Hellobike, and Didibike. The bike
disinfection of one company is about 20,000 times per day, so the bike infection of all four
companies could exceed the amount of user contact.
The frequency distribution of bike usage interval is shown in Figure 6. After the COVID-19
outbreak, the bike usage interval of SBBS and DBS both are greatly reduced. Before the
outbreak, there were two peaks every 24 hours for the frequency of bike usage interval. The first
peak is the 8th hour (from morning peak 9 am to evening peak 5 pm), and the second peak is the
24th hour (the next day’s travel). After the outbreak, the bike usage interval has only one peak
every 24 hours, representing the travel of next day. This finding is in mutual corroboration with
the temporal visualization in Figure 4. Bike usage interval is determined by travel demand, and
travel demand drop and weaker peak phenomenon are the reasons of the amount decrease and
duration increase of bike usage interval. The possibility of user contact was further reduced, so
trip decline indeed reduces the risk of virus transmission through bike sharing.

18

Hua, et al.

Figure 6. The frequency distribution of bike usage interval of SBBS and DBS.
When riding a bike, users will touch the handlebars and seats, which are made of stainless steel
and plastic. Considering that the virus’s half-life is about 6 hours on these materials (van
Doremalen et al., 2020), we tentatively choose 6 hours as the safety threshold for bike usage
interval. If a bike usage interval is less than the safety threshold, a user close contact occurs.
After the COVID-19 outbreak, the daily amount of SBBS user close contacts decreased from
33,400 times to 6,800 times, with a decrease rate of 80%. And the daily amount of DBS user
close contacts decreased from 115,400 times to 14,000 times, with a decrease rate of 88%. The
decrease rate of user close contact is higher than that of bike sharing trips (SBBS: 80% vs. 72%,
DBS: 88% vs. 82%). The spatial distribution of user close contact is shown in Figure 7. There
are more user close contacts in central urban areas than that in suburban areas, which means a
higher risk of virus transmission. The high-risk places should be given priority in bike
disinfection.

19

Hua, et al.

Figure 7. The station-level distribution of user close contact during the COVID-19.
6.2. Service supply and user distancing
Service supply of bike sharing consists of bike supply and operational resources. The statistic
indexes of service supply and transmission risk in bike sharing are shown in Table 6. Bike supply
is more sufficient as the travel demand declines during the COVID-19 pandemic. Idle bike ratio
is the ratio of bikes that have not been used in a certain period to the all bike supply. The higher
the idle bike ratio, the greater bike over-supply. The idle bike ratios of SBBS and DBS both are
42% before the outbreak, that is, only 58% of the bikes are used in these two weeks. After the
outbreak, the idle bike ratio becomes even higher and bike over-supply becomes more serious.
These idle bikes should be activated to meet travel demand and used to avoid user close contact.
Bike repositioning is the most important part of operational resource supply. Bike repositioning
is to solve the imbalance between travel demand and bike supply, especially in the morning and
evening peaks. The amount of bike repositioning experiences a huge reduction after the
COVID-19 outbreak, because travel demand greatly decreases and the peak phenomenon
becomes insignificant. As shown in Table 6, SBBS bikes are daily repositioned 6,300 times
before the pandemic and 1,400 times after the outbreak, with a decrease of 78%. DBS bikes are
20

Hua, et al.

daily repositioned 72,400 times before the pandemic and 10,900 times after the outbreak, with a
decrease of 85%. The decrease rate of bike repositioning amount is large than that of bike
sharing trip. During the pandemic, the company's repositioning objectives should shift from
increasing bike efficiency to reducing transmission risk. The decline of repositioning amount
results in a relative surplus of operational resources, and more operational resources could be
devoted to bike disinfection.
Besides, we propose a new concept of user distancing to help avoid transmission risk. User
distancing is an application of social distancing strategy and user information-sharing in shared
micro-mobility. User distancing in bike sharing is to ensure that bike usage interval should
remain above the safety threshold and user close contact should be avoided. The potential user of
each bike is informed of the travel end time of the previous user and decides her/his travel
behavior accordingly. For example, if the parking duration of a bike to be used is shorter than the
safety threshold, the user will be informed that the bike is unavailable for travel and encouraged
to ride another idle bike or a bike with enough parking duration. If bikes are parked in the
high-demand area and require efficient turnover, the operation staff should be arranged to patrol
the area and ensure timely disinfection. The relative surplus of bike supply and operational
resources promotes the feasibility of user distancing strategy. The user distancing strategy can
reduce the bike disinfection workload, reduce operational cost and increase the turnover
efficiency of idle bikes.

7. Conclusion and discussion
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a huge impact on the globe, and transportation services in
many cities have undergone significant changes. Bike sharing, as a kind of shared micro-mobility,
played an important role in urban transportation during the pandemic. Many cities insist on
providing bike sharing services, while some other cities have decided to suspend this service.
Travel demand and transmission risk are the main concerns and the key basis for urban
decision-making. Based on the trip data of SBBS and DBS in Nanjing, this study explored the
usage pattern of the bike sharing system during the pandemic from three perspectives: station,
user, and bike. The station and user perspectives are used to analyze travel demands, and the bike
perspective is used to analyze virus transmission risk. This paper provides a valuable case study
21

Hua, et al.

of providing SMM service during the COVID-19 pandemic.
From the station perspective, bike sharing has been greatly impacted by COVID-19, and travel
demand for each (virtual) station has decreased variously. The decrease rate of SBBS trips (72%)
is lower than that of DBS trips (82%), meaning that SBBS is less affected by the outbreak. The
decrease rate in urban areas is lower than that in suburban areas, but some hot spots in suburban
areas are less affected by the pandemic. Besides, bike sharing trips near the metro have
significantly decreased, and travel distance has greatly increased after the outbreak. During the
pandemic, bike sharing provides more independent and long-distance transportation services,
rather than integrated services with public transport such as bike-sharing-metro mode. Besides,
bike sharing trips for commuting have greatly decreased, but trips for health and religion have
increased significantly. Health and religion POIs are the key areas of bike sharing services during
the COVID-19, and the adjacent bike sharing services need to be guaranteed with priority.
From the user perspective, bike sharing has become more important during COVID-19, and
middle-aged and elderly people are more dependent on this service. Bike sharing is far less
affected by the pandemic than metro, and it replaces some of the long-distance travel. At the
same time, the network connectivity and peak phenomenon of bike sharing have both weakened.
Women are more impacted than men, especially middle-aged females. The teenagers’ trips have
decreased significantly, and their school trips have been transferred to other purposes. The travel
purposes of youth adult and adult have changed greatly, with a marked decrease in commuting
travel and an important increase in tourism, religion, and health travel. Middle-aged and elderly
people are key user groups of SBBS, and their trip decline and travel purpose change are the
smallest among all age groups.
From bike perspective, the decline of travel demand reduces user contact, and adequate bike
disinfection can avoid the risk of virus transmission. Bike usage interval and user close contact
are used to evaluate the transmission risk. Less travel demand and weaker peak phenomenon
contribute to the amount decrease and duration increase of bike usage interval. The decline of
user close contact in SBBS and DBS is 80% and 88%, which are both greater than the trip
decline of SBBS and DBS. User close contact in the central urban area is higher than the
suburban area, so the city center is the key area for bike disinfection. Under the influence of
COVID-19, the service supply such as bike supply and operating resource is relatively surplus.
Bike sharing companies can encourage users to ride idle vehicles to reduce user contact, and
transfer some operating resources to bike disinfection.
During the pandemic, SMM such as bike sharing can both provide safe service and avoid
transmission risk, with appropriate control strategies. These management strategies include
social distancing, wearing PPE, disinfecting vehicles, and washing hands in time. Chinese cities
22

Hua, et al.

such as Nanjing and Wuhan insisted on providing bike sharing services during COVID-19.
While the pandemic in these cities has been effectively controlled and there is no report about
bike sharing spreading virus. These successful practices prove that bike sharing can
simultaneously meet travel demand and avoid safety risks. The answer to the question in the title
is that cities with good management are encouraged to maintain SMM services such as bike
sharing during the outbreak.
COVID-19 is unlikely to end in the short term, and the pandemic control strategies in the long
term needs to be considered. Strict strategies such as city shutdown adopted earlier are not
sustainable in the long term. Social life will continue to recover, and travel restrictions will
gradually be relaxed. With increased travel, people contact will become more intensive.
Therefore, how to effectively control the virus transmission risk in the long term is a huge
challenge. Reliable, low-cost, and flexible pandemic control strategies in urban transportation
should be explored. For example, we have proposed that companies can adopt the user distancing
strategy based on activating idle vehicles. Besides, users should be encouraged to wear PPE and
disinfect bikes before riding, and maintain these habits for a longer time.
