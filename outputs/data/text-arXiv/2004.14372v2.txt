This paper aims at analyzing the effect on the US air transportation system of the travel
restriction measures implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic from a passenger perspective. Flight centric data are not already publicly and widely available therefore the traditional
metrics used to measure the state of this system are not yet available. Seven metrics based
on three different passenger-generated datasets are proposed here. They aim to measure in
close to real-time how the travel restriction measures impacted the relation between major
stakeholders of the US air transportation system, namely passengers, airports and airlines.
Keywords - Air transportation system, passenger-generated data, passenger-centric metrics, COVID19

I. Motivation
A. The COVID-19 pandemic and international travel from a US perspective
Following the outbreak of corona disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the sever acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and to curb the spread of the resulting pandemic, many countries around the world have
imposed travel restrictions, both domestically and internationally [1].
Italy was the first country to implement a national lockdown situation [2] on March 9th 2020, previously only
confining the northern region of Lodi on February 21st 2020, which was the center of its national COVID-19 outbreak.
Two days later, on March 11th 2020, the United States barred travellers who had visited China, Iran and 26 member
states of the European Union (EU), and extended it to the other 2 members of the EU on March 16th 2020 [1]. The EU
then closed the boarders of 26 of its member states to nearly all visitors from non-EU countries on March 17th 2020 [1].
And on March 19th 2020, the US State Department issued a Level 4 Travel Advisory, a recommendation for all US
citizens to avoid all international travel, still in place as of April 27th 2020 [3].
The following dates are represented in every graph presented in this paper using dotted lines in order to help better
understand the timeline represented within each figure.
1) Lodi region lockdown in Italy: February 21st , 2020
2) Italy lockdown: March 9th , 2020
3) US ban of EU travelers: March 11th , 2020
4) EU border closure: March 17th , 2020
5) US Level 4 travel advisory: March 19th , 2020
B. What data can we use to assess the impact in real-time?
The effect of these travel restrictions measures, and the other measures taken by a majority of countries worldwide,
on the air transportation system has to be unprecedented. Official flight data are still to be released in the United

States regarding international and domestic air transportation (as of April 27th 2020), so there are no unified means of
measuring this impact.
Most traditional metrics to measure the state of the air transportation system are centered on the performance of
flights in terms of delay, cancellation and number of passengers transported using data gathered by the Bureau of
Transportation Statistics (BTS) [4]. This data has first to be provided by airlines and airports to the BTS before being
published as a monthly report. The usual latency is of two months for on-time flight data to be published by BTS. This
frequency is not adapted to the monitoring of situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic.
This paper proposes to take an alternative approach, and to consider data generated by the core of the business of the
air transportation system: passengers. Passengers generate various sort of data throughout their journey, as well as
before and after their flight should have taken place. Some of these passenger-generated data are publicly available in
close-to real-time and could be used in an aggregated and anonymized fashion to assess the state of the air transportation
system. Three such data sources are considered in this paper in order to build passenger-centric metrics: data passively
emitted by passenger passports at immigration, data passively emitted by their phones and data actively emitted within
social media.
The rest of this paper is structured as follows: Section II first presents an overview of what has previously been done
from a passenger perspective to monitor the state of the air transportation system. Section III analyses the impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic on airports from a passenger perspective. Section IV then focuses on the impact on airlines and
Section V summarizes the passenger-centric metrics proposed and discusses future research direction.

II. Background
A passenger approach to analyzing flight delays was first introduced by Bratu and Barnhart [5] who developed a
Passenger Delay Calculator to show that flight-centric metrics do not accurately reflect passenger delays, especially due
to flight cancellations. Later in [6] they calculated passenger delay using monthly data from a major airline operating a
hub-and-spoke network. They show that disrupted passengers, whose journey was interrupted by a capacity reduction,
are only 3% of the total passengers, but suffer 39% of the total passenger delay. Wang et al. in [7, 8] showed that high
passenger trip delays are disproportionately generated by canceled flights and missed connections. 9 of the busiest 35
airports cause 50% of total passenger trip delays. Congestion, flight delay, load factor, flight cancellation time and
airline cooperation policy are the most significant factors affecting total passenger trip delay. These studies, based on
BTS or airline data, have highlighted the disproportionate impact of airside disruptions on passenger door-to-door
journeys, already showing that traditional flight-centric metrics do not capture the full picture.
This led NextGen [9] in the United States and ACARE Flightpath 2050 [10] to advocate a shift from flight-centric
metrics to passenger-centric metrics to evaluate the performance of the Air Transportation System. Both the USA
and Europe aim to take a more passenger-centric approach, with ACARE Flightpath 2050 setting some ambitious
goals, including some that are not measurable yet due to lack of available data. In the US, the Joint Planning and
Development Office has proposed and tested metrics regarding NextGen’s goals, but there are still metrics missing from
the passenger’s viewpoint, especially regarding door-to-door travel times and passenger handling [11].
The shift from flight-centric information to passenger-centric metrics was then explored by Cook et al. [12] within the
project POEM - Passenger Oriented Enhanced Metrics, where they designed propagation-centric and passenger-oriented
performance metrics using both complexity and data science approaches. They simulated air transportation networks
and analyzed their resilience from a flight-centric perspective and from a passenger-oriented perspective, highlighting
the need for the implementation of passenger centric metrics.
Taking the passenger objectives during decision making was then proposed within the concept of Multimodal,
Efficient Transportation in Airports and Collaborative Decision Making (META-CDM) by Laplace et al. [13]. This
concept proposes to link both airside CDM and landside CDM, taking into account the passenger perspective. Within
this framework, Kim et al. [14] proposed to improve airport gate scheduling by implementing a decision model that
balances aircraft, operator and passenger objectives. Dray et al. [15] highlighted the need of taking a multi-modal
approach, which is passenger centered, when handling major disturbances of the air transportation system in order to
offer better solutions to passengers.
Taking a multi-modal approach implies having access to different source of data and being able to link them together.
Data generated by passengers throughout there trip are diverse and scattered across different sensors. Airports gather
customs or security records, shuttle traffic, parking occupancy, sometimes measure queue lengths, while third-parties
collect online traces through WiFi hotspots and Bluetooth beacons [16]. These real-time information, combined with
historical data, were used to analyze and predict passenger flow to an Australian immigration booth [17] or within
2

several Dutch train stations [18] as well as for the analysis and prediction of passenger occupancy in a Chinese airport
[19]. These studies are limited to a limited part of the full system (one or two airport terminals) indicating the difficulty
of gathering a system-wide data-driven picture of passenger behavior.
Considering passengers as sensors was made easier with the increase in the use of smartphones. Marzuoli et al. was
able in [20] and [21] to use mobile phone data in order to analyze the performances of US airports from a passenger
perspective. These studies were a first validation that passenger-centric data can be used to have a view of the overall
health of the Air Transportation System that is complementary to the traditional flight-centric approach. A major
weather perturbation impact on passenger experience in airports was studied using this same approach and the study
was complemented by an additional passenger generated data source, i.e. social media, in [21]. In Europe, a similar
approach was conducted within the BigData4ATM project∗ by Garcia-Albertos et al. [22] who were able to measure
door-to-door travel times of air passengers between two Spanish cities, Madrid and Barcelona, thanks to mobile phone
data. However mobile phone data is proprietary data and is not often publicly available for research. In the special case
of research about the COVID-19 pandemic, SafeGraph [23] gave access to an aggregated version of their database,
consisting of various sets of data generated by mobile phone users.
One important source of user-generated data regularly used to study large-scale behaviors with the advantage of real
time availability is social media, and Twitter† more specifically. With more than 68 millions active users in the United
States [24], Twitter is an important pool of user-created data. Its real-time availability already led Twitter to be the main
focus of multiple studies of large scale events, with several works by Palen et al. on how to help emergency responders
during US natural disasters [25–27]. In Europe, Terpstra et al. also studied how a real time Twitter analysis could
provide valuable information for the operational response of a natural disaster crisis management with the case of the
storm hitting a festival in Belgium [28]. Regarding the air transportation field, most works mining Twitter data focus on
airline sentiment analysis, with Breen [29] explaining how to mine Twitter textual data and create sentiment classifiers
or Wang et al. [30] proposing an improved airline sentiment classifying method. These works focused essentially on
improving the available methods for sentiment analysis without proposing any direct use of their results to improve
airline service or passenger satisfaction. Monmousseau et al. in [31] used publicly available social media data created
by passengers to accurately estimate and predict the hourly aggregated status of the US air transportation system. This
method was further improved in [32] to reliably estimate the hourly delays at departure and at arrival per airport.

III. Impact the COVID-19 travel restriction measures on airports
This section leverages two different user-generated datasets to analyze what was the effect on US airports of the
implemented travel restrictions presented in Section I.A from a passenger and visitor perspective.
A. Overall impact on the number of passengers/visitors at airports
1. International passengers
Travel restrictions do not ban entirely international travel, and there are still passengers arriving at most US airports
of entry after the implementation of these travel restrictions. However, starting March 13th 2020, US citizens who have
been in high risk areas and are returning to the United States have to arrive by one the thirteen following airports of
entry: [1]
• ATL: Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport
• BOS: Boston-Logan International Airport
• DFW: Dallas Fort Worth International Airport
• DTW: Detroit Metropolitan Airport
• EWR: Newark Liberty International Airport
• HNL: Daniel K. Inouye International Airport
• IAD: Washington-Dulles International Airport
• JFK: John F. Kennedy International Airport
• LAX: Los Angeles International Airport
• MIA: Miami International Airport
• ORD: Chicago O’Hare International Airport

• SEA: Seattle-Tacoma International Airport
• SFO: San Francisco International Airport
The effect of these travel restrictions on international travel coming to the US can be studied thanks to the "Airport
Wait Times" data from the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) website [33]. This data are aggregated at an hourly
level and are usually available on the following day they are generated. The readiness of the data is due to the fact that
CBP measures directly the signal emitted by passengers, the signal here being emitted through passports once passengers
clear the immigration process, and does not have to wait for an airline or airport to process and provide the data.
Among other information, the dataset contains the number of passengers arriving at immigration per hour, the
average wait time at immigration per hour, and the number of open immigration booths per hour. For a more detailed
presentation of the available dataset, the authors recommend the reading of [34], which also proposes an analysis of
these wait times from January 2013 to January 2019. The data considered here ranges from January 1st 2020 to April
22nd 2020.
Looking first at the evolution of the total number of passengers arriving at US immigration booths per day across all
airports, this number of passengers drops from an average of 218.7 thousands passengers per day between February
23rd 2020 and March 15th 2020 to an average of only 5.0 thousands passengers per day between April 1st 2020 and April
22nd 2020. This represents a drop of 97.7% in two weeks. The day by day evolution of the total number of passengers
arriving at US immigration from March 1st to April 22nd is shown in Figure 1. This figure also indicates for each
airport with no CBP immigration data available on April 22nd the last date where immigration data are available. This
corresponds to 22 airports. Only Raleigh–Durham International Airport (RDU) closed its immigration service between
the US ban of EU travellers and before the US entered a Level 4 travel advisory. It is to be noted that John Wayne
Airport (SNA) has no immigration data since January 5th 2020. Starting March 22nd 2020, the number of airports not
generating any immigration data steadily increases with nine airports shutting down their immigration services in ten
days. Another nine airports then stop generating immigration data in ten days starting April 12th 2020.

Figure 1 Evolution of the total number of daily arriving passengers. The dates of last recorded CBP data for
airports with no immigration data on the date of April 22nd 2020 are indicated as dotted lines.
Figure 1 indicates that BOS does not have any immigration data on April 22nd 2020 even though it is one of
the selected airport of entry for US citizens coming from high-risk areas. This illustrates the fact that the influx of
international passengers is so low that they had no arriving international passenger to their immigration service for at
4

least one day.
2. Impact on the number of airport visitors
From a domestic perspective, and thanks to SafeGraph’s willingness to provide aggregated data for research on how
to better understand and better handle the COVID-19 pandemic, weekly patterns at specific points of interest (POI)
are available‡ . From these patterns, it is possible to have an estimate of the number of airport visitors per hour by
considering all available POI associated with an airport. Airport visitors are a broader category than air passengers,
since this category also encompasses airport staff and people dropping off or picking up passengers. The data available
for this study ranges from February 27th 2020 to April 18th 2020.
Looking first at the evolution of the total number of airport visitors per day across all airports, this number of
passengers drops from an average of 176.8 thousands passengers per day between February 27th 2020 and March
15th 2020 to an average of only 20.2 thousands passengers per day between April 1st 2020 and April 18th 2020. This
represents a drop of 88.6% in two weeks. The day by day evolution of the total number of airport visitors from March
1st to April 18th is shown in Figure 2. Similarly to Figure 1, this figure also indicates for each airport with no CBP
immigration data available on April 22nd the last date where immigration data are available.

Figure 2 Evolution of the total number of daily airport visitors using SafeGraph data. The dates of last
recorded CBP data for airports with no immigration data on the date of April 22nd 2020 are indicated as dotted
lines.
From Figure 2, it is clear that US domestic travel was already impacted before the rise to a Level 4 travel advisory:
The number of airport visitors contained within the SafeGraph data drops from 152.4 thousands on March 11th 2020
down to 71.6 thousands on March 19th 2020, which represents a 53% drop.

B. Distribution of the impact across airports
1. At immigration
Figure 1 showed that all US airports of entry are impacted by these lockdown and travel ban measures, and the next
step is now to look into this impact at an airport level. Figure 3 compares the individual airport situation of the first two
weeks of April 2020 with the first two weeks of April 2019. Figure 3(a) shows the boxplots of the number of passengers
arriving at immigration per day for each airport over the period of April 1st -22nd 2019. The median number of arriving
passengers is indicated in green and each box lower and upper bounds represent respectively the 1st and 3rd quartile.
The whiskers above and below each box give a visualization of the full range of the considered data even though extreme
values are not drawn. The airports are ordered by their median daily number of passengers arriving at immigration
over that period. Figure 3(b) shows the boxplots of the number of passengers arriving at immigration per day for each
airport over the period of April 1st -22nd 2020. The airports in this figure are in the same order as for Figure 3(a). Please
note that the y-axis are not the same between Figure 3(a) and Figure 3(b) due to the important drop in the number of
passengers arriving at US airports of entries after the implementation of the travel restriction measures.

(a) April 1st -22nd 2019

(b) April 1st -22nd 2020

Figure 3 Boxplots of the number of arriving passengers per day for each airport of entry to the US over the
first three weeks of April for the years 2019 and 2020.
Figure 3(a) is a snapshot of the "normal" situation regarding the number of passengers arriving at US immigration
over the first three weeks of April, while Figure 3(b) is a snapshot of a pandemic situation regarding the number of
passengers arriving at US immigration. The thirteen airports chosen for handling the return of US citizens from
high-risk areas are all in the top 16 airports with the highest median daily number of passengers arriving at immigration,
along with George Bush Intercontinental Airport (IAH), Fort Lauderdale–Hollywood International Airport (FLL) and
Orlando International Airport (MCO).
The drop in the number of passengers arriving at immigration per day is clearly visible between the years 2019
(Figure 3(a)) and 2020 (Figure 3(b)) for the airports with the most arriving passengers. The drop for JFK is the most
important in volume going from a median number of passengers arriving at immigration of 45.9 thousands between
April 1st -22nd 2019 down to a median of 360 April 1st -22nd 2020. For JFK, this drop represents a drop of 99.3%
between the median number of passengers arriving at immigration of these two periods. For all the considered airports,
the corresponding drop is between 70.7% for Sacramento International Airport (SMF) and 100% for the eleven airports
without no immigration data between April 1st 2020 and April 22nd 2020.
Looking at the airport ranking based on the median number of passengers arriving at immigration per day over the
period of April 1st -22nd , Figure 3(b) shows that it has been reshuffled from year 2019 to year 2020: JFK dropped to
the sixth place and IAD climbed to the first place right behind LAX. IAD has however the highest average number of
passengers arriving at immigration per day over the period of April 1st -22nd 2020 with 726 passengers a day on average,
LAX being second with 658 passengers a day on average. JFK was the airport with the highest number of passengers
arriving at immigration per year since 2013 [33], this makes the drop from first place to sixth place is all the more
impressive.

2. At airports
A similar comparison of the number of airport visitors before and after the travel restriction measures can be
conducted based on the SafeGraph data. Due to data availability, this comparison has to take place between March 2020
and April 2020. Figure 4 shows the boxplots of the number of airport visitors per day for 40 US airport with available
SafeGraph data over the first two weeks of March 2020 (Figure 4(a)) and April 2020 (Figure 4(a)). The airports on
these two plots are sorted by their median daily number of airport visitor over the period of March 1st -15th 2020. Please
note that the y-axis are not the same between Figure 4(a) and Figure 4(b) due to the important drop in the number of
passengers arriving at US airports of entries after the implementation of the travel restriction measures.

(a) March 1st -15th 2020

(b) April 1st -15th 2020

Figure 4 Boxplots of the number of airport visitors per day for 44 US airport with available SafeGraph data
over the first two weeks of March and April 2020.
As for the number of passengers arriving at immigration, the airport with the highest median daily number of airport
visitors is the airport with the most important drop in volume. Regarding the median daily number of airport visitors,
ATL has a drop of 11.1 thousand airport visitors in the SafeGraph data between these two weeks, which represents a
89.3% drop. Unlike for immigration, no airport stops completely of receiving visitors, though the drop is important for
all 40 considered airports, ranging from 72.5% for Fresno Yosemite International Airport (FAT) to 93.8% for IAD.
C. Proposed passenger-centric metrics
1. At immigration
With 35 airports having a drop in the median number of passengers arriving at immigration greater than 90%, all
airports are severely impacted by the COVID-19 measures from a passenger-volume perspective. A question to be asked
is: Since there are far fewer passengers arriving at immigration, does the immigration process go faster? The number
of agents operating immigration booths has also decreased due to the corona virus, but it is possible to consider an
immigration load factor.
Definition 1 The immigration load factor is defined as the ratio of the number of passengers arriving at immigration
per hour with the number of open immigration booths per hour.
This load factor indicates the load in terms of passengers for each immigration booth per hour. A lower load indicates
that each immigration booth has fewer passengers to process per hour. From a passenger perspective, a lower load for a
given number of passengers, indicates that there are more immigration booths open, so the average processing time
should be lower and thus a passenger at immigration would have to wait less to be processed.
Assumption 1 If the daily average immigration load factor decreases, then the daily average wait time for passengers
at immigration should decrease as well.
Based on this reasoning, an immigration quality score is proposed: It measures how well Assumption 1 is verified
for an airport immigration service over a selected period of days.

7

Proposed passenger-centric metric 1 The immigration quality score for an airport of entry is defined as the correlation between the daily average wait time for passengers at its immigration service and the daily average immigration
load factor of the airport over a given period.
This immigration quality score is equal to 1 if Assumption 1 is perfectly verified, to 0 if the daily average wait time for
passengers at immigration is uncorrelated with the daily average immigration load factor and to -1 if the opposite of
Assumption 1 occurs over the considered period, i.e. a decrease in the daily average immigration load factor implies an
increase in the daily average wait time for passengers at immigration.
This proposed passenger-centric metric is applied to the period pre-COVID (January 1st 2020 to February 29th 2020)
and to the period post-COVID (March 1st 2020 to April 22nd 2020) for 40 US airports of entry. Table 1 shows the
associated partial ranking (top ten best airports and top 10 worst airports) for these two periods.

The airport still generating immigration data on April 24th with the worst drop between the period pre-COVID and
the period post-COVID is IAD, going from 17th down to 36th , and the airport still generating immigration data on April
24th with the best increase in rank is JFK, with 30 places gained and with an increase in score from the negative value
of -0.32 to the positive value of +0.81.
2. In terms of airport visitors
With 38 airports having a drop in the median number of airport visitors greater than 80%, all airports are also
severely impacted by the COVID-19 travel restrictions measures from a visitor-volume perspective. Visitors in general
avoid airports, but some are still going to the airports after the travel restriction measures. The same question as for the
immigration process can be asked: Are these visitors processed faster since there are less visitors?
The data for visitors available for this is different than the data available for passengers arriving at immigration,
therefore a different approach has to be considered here. The SafeGraph data contains weekly bucketed dwell times for
each considered location. The dwell time is the time spent at that location, be it waiting, shopping, walking, etc. The
buckets are: less than 5 minutes, between 5 and 20 minutes, between 21 and 60 minutes, between 61 minutes and 240
minutes and more than 240 minutes. From these weekly bucketed dwell times, two complementary passenger-metrics
are proposed to measure an airport efficiency to process visitors.
Proposed passenger-centric metric 2 The weekly airport visitor efficiency score for an airport is defined as the
weekly proportion of airport visitors spending less than 60 minutes at an airport.
Proposed passenger-centric metric 3 The weekly airport visitor slugginess score for an airport is defined as the
weekly proportion of airport visitors spending more than 240 minutes at an airport.
8

The time limits within these two metrics are also chosen due to the format of the data, and could be adjusted to
less aggregated data. The idea behind the airport visitor efficiency score is to incentivize airports to keep the flow of
people coming in and out of their airports as fast as possible. The time limit of 60 minutes concerns essentially visitors
dropping off or picking up a passenger, and hopefully some passengers on domestic flights, where the overall security
screening process is faster than for international flights. Most airlines and airports recommend their passengers on
international flights to arrive two to three hours ahead of their flight’s scheduled departure time, therefore the idea
behind the airport visitor slugginess score is to measure the validity of this recommendation.
Airport staff can be counted as airport visitors using this dataset and they are likely to stay more than 240 minutes at
the airport, increasing the number of airport visitors staying longer than this threshold. Therefore, an airport with a high
airport visitor slugginess score could either be an airport with many passengers taking more than four hours to clear
their entire airport process, or an airport with a disproportionate number of airport staff compared to the number of
airport visitors.
Since there are several locations per airport within the SafeGraph data, e.g. "LAX Terminal 4" and "LAX Terminal
South" for LAX, an estimation of the proposed airport visitor efficiency score is calculated by taking the minimum
weekly proportion of airport visitors spending less than 60 minutes at a location within an airport over all considered
airport locations. Similarly, an estimation of the proposed airport visitor slugginess score is calculated by taking the
maximum weekly proportion of airport visitors spending more than 240 minutes at a location within an airport over all
considered airport locations.
These proposed passenger-centric metrics are applied to the period pre-COVID (March 1st 2020 to March 15th 2020)
and to the period post-COVID (April 5th 2020 to April 19th 2020) for 44 US airports. These periods contain 2 weeks each
and therefore 2 points of data each. The scores are calculated for each week and then averaged over the period. Table 2
shows the partial ranking (top ten best airports and top 10 worst airports) associated to the proposed passenger-metric 2
for these two periods.

less than 60 minutes applied to the period of pre-COVID of March 1st 2020 to March 15th 2020 and to the period
post-COVID of April 5th 2020 to April 19th 2020 for the 44 considered US airports based on SafeGraph data.

In Table 2, a score of 1 indicates that all airport visitors within the SafeGraph data spend less than one hour at the
same location within the airport, while a score of 0 indicates that all airport visitors within the SafeGraph data spend
more than one hour at the same location within the airport. Some airports have a score of 0 due to locations receiving
very few visitors (less than 5) over the considered week that were captured within the SafeGraph data, and all those
visitors stayed more than one hour at that same airport location.

more than four hours at the same location within the airport. Similarly to the visitor airport efficiency score, some
airports have a score of 1 due to locations receiving very few visitors (less than 5) over the considered week that were
captured within the SafeGraph data, and all those visitors stayed more than four hours at that same airport location.
D. Focus on JFK and IAD immigration process
Following the results of the metric proposed in Section III.C.1, this section focuses on the two airports with the most
important change in behavior linked to the COVID-19 travel restriction measures, JFK and IAD.
1. JFK
JFK had the best increase in rank using the proposed immigration quality score presented in Table 1, and this section
aims at analyzing the available CBP immigration data. The effect of the travel ban measures presented in Section I.A on
passengers arriving at JFK’s immigration is presented in Figure 5 through four different views by comparing data from
2020 with CBP data from the years 2018 and 2019 between January 1st and April 22nd .
Figure 5(a) shows the daily evolution of the number of passengers arriving at JFK’s immigration and confirms the
important huge drop in the number of arriving international passengers to the US from an average 35.6 thousands
passengers arriving at immigration a day down to barely 360 passengers a day. Compared to the years 2018 and 2019,
with an average of 45.9 thousands passengers, the difference is more important, since the number of passengers arriving
at JFK’s immigration is usually higher in April than in March. Figure 5(b) shows the daily evolution of the average
number of open immigration booths per hour at JFK and presents a similar drop than in Figure 5(a), the number of
open immigration booths dropping from around an average of 35.4 per operating hour down to an average of 7.5 per
hour. This drop is however less important in proportion compared to the drop in the number of passengers arriving at
immigration. Figure 5(c) shows the evolution of the daily average load factor (Definition 1). After the lockdown and
travel ban measures, the load factor drops significantly from an average of 42.5 before the measures down to around 8.5,
which represents a 80% drop. This indicates that after the measures, an immigration booth has about five times fewer
passengers to process per hour. Or from the passenger perspective, each passenger has about five times more open
immigration booths to take care of them. This has a direct positive impact to the average wait time at immigration
for passengers. Figure 5(d) shows the daily evolution of the average wait time for passengers at JFK’s immigration. It
was reduced by half after the lockdown and travel ban measures, from around 21.5 minutes to around 10.5 minutes,
compared to the usual April levels of 26 minutes in 2019 and 23 minutes in 2018.

2. IAD
IAD had the worst drop in rank using the proposed immigration quality score presented in Table 1, and is the focus
of this section. Figure 6 shows the impact of the travel restriction measures for passengers arriving at IAD’s immigration
through the four same perspectives as the analysis of JFK.
Figure 6(a) shows the daily evolution of the number of passengers arriving at IAD immigration and confirms that,
even though in 2020 that number has dropped from an average of 7.2 thousands in February 2020 to an average of 726
in April 2020 after the implementation of the travel ban measures, the drop is less important than for JFK (Figure 5(a)).
Though this is still a 93% drop for the number of passengers arriving at immigration in April between the years 2019
and 2020, with a daily average of 10.4 thousands passengers in 2019, the number of open immigration booths was not
impacted as much as for JFK. Figure 6(b) shows the daily evolution of the average number of open immigration booth
per hour at IAD. The daily average of open booths per hour over the month of April 2020, with an average of 10.1 per
hour, is similar to the daily average over the month of April 2018, with an average of 11 per hour, and only slightly lower
than the number of open booths over the month of April 2019, with an average of 14.6 per hour. Over the period of
January to March, the daily average of open booths per hour is significantly higher in 2020 than in 2018 or 2019, with
an average of 10.2 for 2018 and of 11.7 for 2019. From a load factor perspective, the situation at IAD is quite similar
to the situation at JFK. Figure 6(c) shows the daily evolution of the immigration load factor at IAD. The decrease in
passengers after the travel ban measures led to a load factor that oscillates around an average of 26.7, which is three to

four times lower than the usual load factor of this period. The drop is of 67% with the year 2019 and of 75% with the
year 2018. Even though passengers arriving at immigration starting March 20th 2020 have at least three times more
available open booths than in the previous year, the wait time for passengers at immigration did not improve, unlike for
passengers arriving at JFK immigration. Figure 6(d) shows the daily evolution of the average wait time for passengers
arriving at IAD immigration. The average wait time has increased throughout the travel ban measures and even reached
the same level as during the previous years. It went from an average of 8.1 minutes in February 2020 to an average of 17
minutes in April 2020, compared to an average of 14.6 minutes in 2018 and of 26.3 minutes in 2019.

IV. Impact of the COVID-19 related travel restriction measures on US airlines
This section leverages a dataset actively generated by passengers to observe the effects of the travel restriction
measures presented in Section I.A on seven major US airlines and propose several passenger-centric metrics to analyze
their reactions with respect to their customers.
A. Twitter: a database of passenger-generated content available in real-time
Airlines operate over more than one airport and in each airport there are usually more than one airline operating
at the same time. There is thus no straight-forward way to determine which airline a passenger is flying with using
12

only geolocation data without excessive passenger tracking. The datasets presented and used for the evaluation of the
COVID-19 travel restriction measures on airports cannot be directly used to evaluate the impact of these same measures
to airlines. Another approach is thus necessary to evaluate the reaction of airlines to this pandemic situation from a
passenger perspective.
The importance of airport experience in customer, i.e. passenger, satisfaction towards both airline and airport
services was already highlighted in the study of Pruyn and Smidts [35], where they show that customer satisfaction is
largely affected by their experience at waiting areas, both in terms of wait times and wait environment. This implies that
waiting at airports (or any other transit station) can be acceptable for passengers if they are taken care of accordingly.
Watkins et al. [36] confirmed this conclusion by showing that the perceived wait time for transit riders was lower for
riders receiving real-time information than for passengers without that information.
One means of real-time information is social media. In particular, Twitter is an important means of direct
communication between airlines and passengers, with an average of more than 300 tweets a day over the month of
January 2020 written by the customer services of four major US carriers (Southwest Airlines, Delta Airlines, American
Airlines and United Airlines) and an average of more than 800 tweets a day written by their customers.
The use of Twitter as a real-time estimator of the air transportation system has already been investigated in [32] in
order to estimate flight-centric values per airport before they were released by BTS, and the same data extraction process
is used here. Seven airlines, and their associated Twitter handles, are considered in the following sections: American
Airlines (@AmericanAir), Delta Air Lines (@Delta), United Airlines (@united), Alaska Airlines (@AlaskaAir),
Southwest Airlines (@SouthwestAir), JetBlue Airways (@JetBlue) and Spirit Airlines (@SpiritAirlines). The first four
are legacy airlines, and the last three are low-cost carriers. All tweets written from these airlines Twitter account were
scrapped from February 1st 2020 to April 12th 2020 and are categorized as "customer service tweets". All tweets written
over that same period and mentioning at least one of the airline handles that was not written from the associated airline
Twitter account were also scrapped and categorized as "passenger tweets".
B. Sentiment analysis
The same classifiers as in the study conducted in [32] are used here to estimate the mood expressed within tweets
in order to monitor the real-time evolution of the passenger and airline customer service expressed moods. Each
classifier gives a score of 1 if it considers that the tweet expresses a positive sentiment and a score of 0 if it expresses a
negative sentiment. In effect, each classifier calculates the probability for a tweet of being positive, and then rounds
that probability to the closest integer (0 or 1). The classifiers are here transformed into regressors by considering the
probability for a tweet of being classified as positive. The output of all trained regressors are then averaged into one
single score, going from 0 for a negative mood to 1 for a positive mood.
Using the mean sentiment expressed within each tweets aggregated on a daily level, it is possible to compare the
effect of the lockdown from both a passenger perspective and an airline perspective. Figure 7 shows the evolution of the
expressed mood from February 1st 2020 to April 12th 2020 for the four legacy airlines considered.

(a) From passengers of major airlines

(b) From customer service

Figure 7 Daily average mood expressed in tweets containing airline Twitter handles for four legacy airlines
between February 1st 2020 and April 12th 2020.

13

From Figure 7(a), a drop in the mood expressed within passenger tweets can be observed right after the US travel
ban for the three major airlines (Delta Air Lines, United Airlines and American Airlines). Delta has the steepest descent
but also the sharpest recovery. The case of Alaska Airlines is particular: a #AlaskaHappyHour campaign, which gave
the opportunity of winning free flights to Alaska, took place in the beginning of March 2020. This campaign could
explain the increase in the expressed mood in passenger tweets between March 1st 2020 and March 5th 2020 and could
as well as compensate the effect of the travel ban announcement.
This drop in the mood is less visible (or non-existent in the case of American Airlines) within the tweets written by
the airline customer services, as shown in Figure 7(b). Though Delta Air Lines and Alaska Airlines had the highest
expressed mood on average within passenger tweets, the mood expressed by their customer service is the lowest on
average of the four legacy airlines considered. The better mood expressed by their passengers could be explained by
the fact that these companies expressed a mood closer to their passengers’ actual mood. The gap between the mood
expressed within tweets written by passengers and tweets written by airline customer services is visible from one figure
to another, airline customer service tweets expressing a mood about 0.2 points higher than passenger tweets.
Similar observations can be drawn from a low-cost carrier perspective. Figure 8 shows the evolution of the expressed
mood from February 1st 2020 to April 12th 2020 for the three low-cost carriers considered.

(a) From passengers

(b) From customer service

Figure 8 Daily average mood expressed in tweets containing airline Twitter handles for three low-cost airlines
between February 1st 2020 and April 12th 2020.
Figure 8(a) indicates that passengers from Spirit Airlines express a significantly lower mood on average than the
other two low-cost carriers considered over the months of February and March 2020. A spike in the expressed mood
in tweets written by JetBlue passengers can be seen around March 26th 2020, which corresponds to the period when
JetBlue announced they would be offering free flights to health care workers in order to help the governor of New York
handle the spread of COVID-19 in New York State§ , as well as the period when an update of their mobile application
contained the message "Now, go wash your hands". The drop in the mood expressed in the tweets written by passengers
of legacy airlines after Italy’s lockdown is less visible for passengers of low-cost airlines.
From a customer service perspective, Figure 8(a), the gap between the mood expressed in the tweets written by
Southwest Airlines customer and the mood expressed in the tweets written by the customer service of the other two
carriers is resorbed the day after Italy’s lockdown. This could indicate a similar communication policy for these carrier
regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. The same gap as for legacy airlines between the mood expressed within tweets
written by passengers and tweets written by airline customer services of about 0.2 points is visible from Figure 8(a) to
Figure 8(b).
Based on this sentiment data, two metrics are proposed here to compare airlines. A first metric aims to measure how
well airlines are in phase with the mood of their passengers. For example, if the average passenger mood is decreasing,
the mood expressed by the airline customer service should not be increasing.
Proposed passenger-centric metric 4 The airline empathy score is defined as the correlation between the evolution
of the average mood expressed by passengers in their tweets and the evolution of the average mood expressed by the
airline customer service in their tweets.
§ https://twitter.com/NYGovCuomo/status/1242941085535608835

14

This score goes from -1 to 1, with 1 meaning that the airline customer service expressed mood is perfectly in phase with
the mood expressed by their passengers. A score of 0 indicates that the mood expressed by the airline customer service
is uncorrelated with the expressed mood of their passengers. A score of -1 indicates that the airline customer service
expressed mood is in complete opposition of phase with the mood expressed by their passengers. In other words, the
mood expressed by airlines increases when the mood expressed by passengers decreases, and vice-versa.
Proposed passenger-centric metric 5 The airline sentiment gap measures the average difference between the average
mood expressed by passengers and the average mood expressed by airlines.
This measures goes from -1 to 1 with 0 indicating that airlines and passengers express the same average mood. 1
indicates the worst case, i.e. when the mood expressed by airlines is equal to 1 (i.e. highest possible) and the mood
expressed by passengers is equal to 0 (lowest possible) throughout the considered period. A measure of -1 indicates the
opposite scenario.
Table 4 presents these two proposed passenger-centric metrics based on the sentiment expressed in tweets for the
seven considered airlines and ranks the airlines for each score. The scores were calculated over the period of March
1st 2020 to April 11th 2020.

C. Keyword-based metrics
1. Cancellations
When a some exceptional situation occurs, a spike in the use of certain keywords can be seen within the stream of
tweets written by the affected Twitter users. For example, in the case of an important number of cancellations, many
passengers will go on Twitter and use the keyword "cancel" to express their concerns directly to the airline they were
flying with.
Figure 9 shows the evolution of the normalized number of occurrences of the keyword "cancel" in tweets written by
passengers from February 1st 2020 to April 12th 2020 for four US legacy airlines and three US low-cost carriers. The
normalization is based on the total number of passengers transported by each considered carrier over the year 2018
using BTS data [37].
Figure 9(a) indicates that the passengers of the four legacy airlines considered are reactive to the international
situation; an important increase can already be seen around the date of Italy’s lockdown announcement. A second spike
then occurs once the US announces that it bans all travellers from the EU, China and Iran, with Delta Air Line passengers
being, in proportion, the most vocal on Twitter. This could indicate that Delta Air Line has a greater proportion of its
US passengers traveling in the EU at that time. Alaska Airlines had an early spike in the number of tweets containing
the keyword "cancel" compared to the other legacy airlines. That early spike could be link to the fact that most of the
first US cases of COVID-19 were discovered on the US West Coast, which is where Alaska Airlines main hub is located.
Figure 9(b) shows the evolution in the mood expressed in passenger tweets for the three considered low-cost carriers.
Passengers of Southwest Airlines are the less vocal in proportion on the matter of cancellation, with a slight increase in
number of occurrences of the keyword "cancel" in their tweets almost entirely contained within the period between Italy
lockdown announcement and the rise to a Level y travel advisory for the US. Passengers of JetBlue Airways have a

behavior similar to legacy airlines in this case. Spirit Airlines passengers waited for the US travel ban announcement to
express massively their concerns using the word "cancel".
Figure 10 shows the evolution of the number of occurrences of the keyword "cancel" in tweets written by airline
customer sservices from February 1st 2020 to April 12th 2020 for the same four US legacy airlines and three US low-cost
carriers. Please note that the y-axis scale is different between Figure 10(a) and Figure 10(b).

(a) From customer service of legacy airlines

Figure 10

(b) From customer service of low-cost airlines

Number of occurrences of the keyword "cancel" in tweets written by airline customer services

For legacy airlines, the behavior shown in Figure 10(a) is similar for three out of four of the considered airlines.
There is a significant increase in the number of occurrences of the keyword "cancel" starting the Italy announced its
lockdown and that number then slowly decreases. For American Airlines, after a similar increase in the number of
occurrences of the keyword "cancel", that number does not decrease but fluctuates at a level more important than during
the period before the travel restriction measures where announced.
Regarding low-cost carriers, Figure 10(b) shows that each carrier has its own characteristic regarding the use of
the keyword "cancel". Southwest Airlines has two important spikes around each of the US announcements referenced
in the plot. JetBlue has a single massive spike on March 13th 2020. Both of these carriers then spent more than two
weeks with a higher level of occurrences of the keyword "cancel" than in February 2020. Spirit Airlines barely uses the
keyword "cancel" in their communication except on March 23rd 2020.
Based on the observations from the plots in Figure 9, it is possible to consider that an important increase in the
normalized number of passenger tweets containing the keyword "cancel" represents a situation that airlines have to deal
with in order for that volume to return to normal values.

16

Definition 2 A keyword-related Twitter situation is defined as an increase in the normalized number of occurrences of
the keyword within passenger tweets over a predefined level.
Two metrics to measure the airline reaction to such a situation are proposed here. The aim of the first metric is to
measure the effectiveness of the airline response to these keyword-related situations.
Proposed passenger-centric metric 6 The keyword-related Twitter situation quality response score of an airline is
the time needed for the airline to bring the normalized number of occurrences of the keyword within passenger tweets
back to a predefined level.
This proposed quality metric measures the time needed for the airline to bring the number of keyword occurrences back
to a normal state. When measuring the response of long term perturbation, such as the COVID pandemic, this time is
measured in days.
The number of keyword occurrences in the passenger tweets is normalized by the total number of passengers over
the year 2018 in this case, similarly to the data presented in Figure 9, and this normalization should be updated with the
most recent numbers once they are available.
The aim of the second metric is to measure the communication effort produced by the airline in order to handle the
situation linked to the increase of number of occurrences of the keyword under consideration.
Proposed passenger-centric metric 7 The keyword-related Twitter situation quantity response score of an airline is
calculated by integrating the number of occurrences of the keyword in tweets written by the airline over the number of
days associated to the situation.
The number of days used to calculate this quantity response score corresponds to the number of days found using the
quality response score associated with the same situation.
Table 5 presents these two proposed metrics in the case of the keyword "cancel" considering that the predefined
threshold indicating when a situation starts and ends is 1. Table 5 illustrates the necessity of considering both the

quality response score and the quantity response score hand in hand. Southwest Airlines has the best scores from both
perspective but Spirit Airlines has the second best quality response score but the worst quantity response score by far.
2. Refund
Figure 11 shows the evolution of the number of occurrences of the keyword "refund" in tweets written by passengers
from March 1st 2020 to April 12th 2020 for the same seven US airlines.
Figure 11 shows the evolution of the normalized number of occurrences of the keyword "refund" in tweets written
by passengers from February 1st 2020 to April 12th 2020 for the same seven US airlines using the same normalization
process.
From a passenger perspective, the situation linked to the "refund" keyword is similar to the situation linked to the
"cancel" keyword but at a lower proportion. Figure 11(a) shows that legacy airlines all have a steep increase in the
number of occurrences of the keyword "refund" in passenger tweets at the announcement of Italy’s lockdown and then a
very slow decrease, with Alaska Airlines have an anticipated spike at the beginning of March 2020. Figure 11(b) shows

Figure 11 Number of occurrences of the keyword "refund" in tweets written by passengers normalized by the
number of total passengers per carrier over the year 2018 using BTS data [37]

that Southwest Airlines increase in the occurrences of the keyword "refund" is still lower and resorbs faster than the other
low-cost carriers and that the spike for Spirit Airlines passengers starts only at the announcement of the US travel ban.
Figure 12 shows the evolution of the number of occurrences of the keyword "refund" in tweets written by airline
customer services from February 1st 2020 to April 12th 2020 for the same seven US airlines.

Figure 12(a) shows the evolution of the number of occurrences of the keyword "cancel" within tweets of customer
service of the four considered legacy airlines. The initial increase is similar than for the keyword "cancel" (Figure 10(a)),
however there is then a second increase towards the end of March 2020, this increase being most visible within the tweets
written by American Airlines. From a low-cost carrier perspective, Figure 12(b) illustrates the same idiosyncracies as
in Figure 10(b): Two spikes around the US announcements for Southwest Airlines, this time with higher fluctuations
afterwards, one major spike on March 13th 2020 for JetBlue and not even one occurrence of the keyword "refund" over
the whole period for Spirit Airlines.
The same two metrics associated to the "cancel"-related Twitter situation presented in Section IV.C.1, i.e. the quality
response score and the quantity response score, can be used for this "refund"-related Twitter situation. Table 6 presents
these two proposed metrics in the case of the keyword "refund" using the same predefined threshold of 1 for delimiting a
Twitter situation.

V. Discussion & Conclusion
A. Summary of the proposed metrics
In order to complement existing flight-centric metrics, which are not broadly and readily available, this paper
proposed to consider seven different passenger-centric metrics based on passenger-generated data, three of them focusing
on airports and the other four metrics focusing on airlines. They are regrouped and listed here.
Proposed passenger-centric metric 1 The immigration quality score for an airport of entry is defined as the correlation between the daily average wait time for passengers at its immigration service and the daily average immigration
load factor of the airport over a given period.
Proposed passenger-centric metric 2 The weekly airport visitor efficiency score for an airport is defined as the
weekly proportion of airport visitors spending less than 60 minutes at an airport.
Proposed passenger-centric metric 3 The weekly airport visitor slugginess score for an airport is defined as the
weekly proportion of airport visitors spending more than 240 minutes at an airport.
Proposed passenger-centric metric 4 The airline empathy score is defined as the correlation between the evolution
of the average mood expressed by passengers in their tweets and the evolution of the average mood expressed by the
airline customer service in their tweets.
Proposed passenger-centric metric 5 The airline sentiment gap measures the average difference between the average
mood expressed by passengers and the average mood expressed by airlines.
The following two proposed metrics can be used with selected keywords, e.g. "cancel" and "refund".
Proposed passenger-centric metric 6 The keyword-related Twitter situation quality response score of an airline is
the time needed for the airline to bring the normalized number of tweets containing the specific keyword back to a
predefined level.
Proposed passenger-centric metric 7 The keyword-related Twitter situation quantity response score of an airline is
calculated by integrating the number of tweets written by the airline and containing the keyword over the number of
days associated to the situation.
B. Discussion
These proposed passenger-centric metrics were built using data available, either in real-time or due to the exceptional
circumstances, and can still be further tuned to meet the expectations of both federal agencies and passengers. Several
limitations and possible improvements should be noted here for a better understanding of these proposed metrics.
The data used to estimate the number of visitors at airports and the proportion of time spent per airport location was
graciously provided by SafeGraph in order to better understand the COVID-19 situation, and is not usually as easily
19

available. In order to implement the associated metrics, agreements should be held between the different data providers
and the group in charge of such metrics. Furthermore, an analysis of the categories of person most likely to be within
the gathered data should be undertaken to better tune the final score.
The proposed Twitter related metrics have the unique advantage, among the presented datasets, that they can easily
be updated on an hourly basis if needed. They also enable each passenger and airline to actively be able to influence
their scores. They measure however essentially the communication quality and quantity between airlines and passengers,
and should therefore still be complemented with traditional flight-centric measures for completeness.
This study focused on the effects of the travel restriction measures linked to a major disruption taking its course over
an important number of days and tailored the proposed metrics for this timespan. Future studies could also investigate
into the adaptation of some of these proposed passenger-centric metrics to measure effects on a smaller scale, e.g. over
a single day or a few hours.
