Abstract
We introduce an epidemic spreading model on a network using concepts from
percolation theory. The model is motivated by discussing the standard SIR
model, with extensions to describe effects of lockdowns within a population.
The underlying ideas and behavior of the lattice model, implemented using
the same lockdown scheme as for the SIR scheme, are discussed in detail and
illustrated with extensive simulations. A comparison between both models
is presented for the case of COVID-19 data from the USA. Both fits to the
empirical data are very good, but some differences emerge between the two
approaches which indicate the usefulness of having an alternative approach
to the widespread SIR model.

1. Introduction
The study of epidemics spreading in human populations has a long history both on the mathematical aspects (see e.g. Kermack and McKendrick
(1927); Bailey (1957); Bollobás (2013)), as well as on the modelling of outbreak and control of their evolution (Anderson and May (1991); Fraser et al.

(2004); Fernández-Villaverde and Jones (2020)). Spreading phenomena has
been studied extensively also in the realm of statistical physics of disordered
systems (e.g. Ben-Avraham and Havlin (2000); Bunde and Havlin (2012);
Stauffer and Aharony (2018)).
In this paper, we introduce a lattice network model for epidemics spreading based in part on concepts taken from percolation theory. To motivate
the network approach to spreading, we first discuss the SIR model (Kermack
and McKendrick (1927)), also extending it to encompass the effects of lockdowns mimicked by using a time decaying reproduction number. To assess
the usefulness of the lattice model, we consider COVID-19 data from the
USA and compare the results of the simulations with SIR predictions, both
in the presence of lockdowns.
The paper is organized as follows: We start out in Sect. 2 with a brief
review of the SIR model, with emphasis on some analytical results and its
extension to the description of lockdown effects. Illustrative examples are
shown, together with a motivation for the need of going beyond a ‘meanfield’ approach. The network model is then discussed in detail in Sect. 3,
and the percolation ideas, relevant to the present case, are discussed. Extensive (Monte Carlo) simulations are shown to illustrate the advantages and
difficulties typically associated with such lattice models. In Sect. 4, we apply
it to the current case of COVID-19 USA data, by comparing the network
results with the predictions of the SIR model. The paper ends with our
concluding remarks in Sect. 5.
2. SIR models with extensions to lockdown effects
Infection spreading is typically modelled by the SIR model, introduced
by Kermack and McKendrick (1927). We briefly review it for the purpose of
introducing the notation, presenting extensions to describe lockdown effects.
We follow standard terminology in epidemic literature2 .
We consider a population with a fixed number of individuals, N . To describe the outbreak of an infectious disease, the population can be divided
into the following four categories: Susceptibles (S), Infecteds (I), Recovereds
2

It is widespread usage in epidemiology (see e.g. Smith and Moore (2001)) to refer
to ‘Susceptibles’, ‘Infecteds’ and ‘Recovereds’, rather than using longer phrases such as
‘population of susceptible individuals’ or ‘the susceptible category’. Here, we add the
‘Dormants’ category, referring to individuals who momentarily do not interact with others.

2

(R) and Dormants (D). The number of individuals in the first three categories depends on time t, so that we will indicate them as S(t), I(t) and
R(t), while the number of dormants D remains constant during the whole
process. Susceptibles are initially healthy but can get infected; infecteds
carry the infection and can transmit it to susceptibles, while recovereds are
infecteds who have healed or have died, thus they do not spread the infection any further. The fourth category, D, includes non susceptibles (perhaps
immune individuals to the specific disease), and in general healthy subjects
who do not get in contact with infecteds during the whole spreading process
(Fig. 1). The reason for introducing the fourth category will be clearer when
discussing solutions of the SIR system of equations.
At any time t, the number of individuals in each category must obey the
conservation equation,
S(t) + I(t) + R(t) + N0 = N,

(1)

where we have denoted N0 = D. We assume the unit of time to be one day.

Figure 1: Structure of a population of N individuals before the outbreak of the disease:
Susceptibles, N − N0 , versus non-susceptibles or dormants, N0 . The latter are assumed to
be inaccessible to the infection and being disseminated uniformly within the population.
Although this classification is apparently superfluous within a SIR approach, it becomes
useful for spreading phenomena on networks.

3

The SIR model is described by a set of three differential equations for the
time variation of the number of individuals in each category, S(t), I(t) and
R(t), which, upon taking into account the condition Eq. (1), read,
dS

(2)

(4)

where Neff = N − N0 = S(t) + I(t) + R(t), is the effective number of individuals taking part in the process, β is the infection (or contact) rate between
infecteds and susceptibles, β̄ = βNeff /N is the effective infection rate in the
presence of dormants, and γ is the healing (or immunization) rate of infecteds.
It is convenient to work with normalized quantities, s(t) = S(t)/Neff , i(t) =
I(t)/Neff , and r(t) = R(t)/Neff , so that the SIR equations become,
ds
= −β̄ s(t)i(t),
dt
di
= (β̄ s(t) − γ) i(t) = (R̄0 s(t) − 1)γ i(t),
dt
dr
= γ i(t).
dt

(7)

The above equations have exactly the same form as in the case N0 = 0. The
idea of considering explicitely a fraction of the whole population not taking
part in the spreading phenomenon, f0 = N0 /N (0 ≤ f0 ≤ 1), allows us to
interpret the so-called reproduction number, R0 , as composed of two factors,
a purely ‘biological’ one, ∼ β/γ, and a ‘structural’ one ∼ (1 − f0 ), denoted
as, R̄0 = (β/γ)(1 − f0 ). The second factor represents the effect of dormants
non-in-contact with others, thus ‘hindering’ or slowing down the spreading
process. The fraction f0 can change in time, but for simplicity we assume it
constant. Within the realm of the SIR model dormants don’t seem necessary,
however, they play a prominent role within the context of network models
of infection spreading, as we will discuss in detail in Sect. 3. More generally,
dormants can be considered as those individuals who interact very weakly
with others, thus representing a subset of the population which is in a sort
of ‘quarantine’ from others.
4

One can derive some general relations between the categories by considering ratios between the SIR differential equations (Eqs. (5,6,7)). First, divide
(6) by (5), yielding,
γ
1
di
= −1 +
, i(t) − i(0) = s(0) − s(t) +
log(s(t)/s(0)),
(8)
ds
R̄0
β̄S
and dividing (5) by (7), we find,
ds
β̄S
= − , log(s(t)/s(0)) = −R̄0 (r(t) − r(0)).
(9)
dr
γ
By specifying the conditions, i(0) = 1/Neff , s(0) = 1 − 1/Neff , and i(∞) = 0,
Eq. (8) becomes,
1
s(∞) = 1 +
log(s(∞)/s(0)),
(10)
R̄0
which can be written as,
s(∞) = s(0) e−R̄0 (1−s(∞)) .

(11)

Notable limits are, s(∞) = s(0) when R̄0 → 0, and s(∞) = 0 when R̄0 → ∞.
Also Eq. (6) admits a partial solution when di/dt = 0, in particular at
t = tpeak , i.e. at the peak of the infecteds curve, yielding,
1
1
, and i(tpeak ) + r(tpeak ) = 1 −
.
(12)
s(tpeak ) =
R̄0
R̄0
Typically, lockdown effects are modelled using an exponential time dependence of β (see e.g. Palladino et al. (2020)). Here, we employ a softer
decay which appears to work very well, i.e.
 τ q
0
, t ≥ τ0 ,
(13)
β̄(t) = β̄
t
and β̄(t) = β̄, for t ≤ τ0 , where τ0 is the time at which lockdowns start, and
q > 0 is a parameter. This means we deal with a time decaying reproduction
number, R̄0 (t) = β̄(t)/γ. Using this form in Eq. (6), we can obtain the time
tlock at which the infecteds curve displays its new maximum. The condition
is, R̄0 (tlock )s(tlock ) = 1, which, together with Eq. (12), yields,

1/q
s(tlock )
tlock = τ0
> τ0 ,
(14)
s(tpeak )
since s(tlock ) > s(tpeak ), as there are more susceptibles in the presence of
lockdowns than otherwise. Illustrative examples are reported in Fig. (2), for
R̄0 = 16.5 (with β = 1.1 and γ = 1/30) and f0 = 1/2.
5

Figure 2: (Upper panel) SIR model for β = 1.1, γ = 1/30, R0 = β/γ = 33 and f0 =
N0 /N = 0.5, yielding β̄ = 0.55 and R̄0 = 16.5. The case f0 = N0 = 0 (dashed lines)
is shown for comparison. (Lower panel) SIR model with distancing effects for β̄(t) =
β̄(τ0 /t)q , with τ0 = 18 and q = 2. The dashed lines represent the solution without
lockdowns, and are shown for comparison.

In the upper panel, we show the standard case, with γ representing the
inverse of a typical COVID-19 healing period. We show also for comparison
the case f0 = 0 (dashed lines). In this case, Eq. (11) predicts s(∞) ∼
= 0,
6

clearly consistent with the numerical data. As is apparent from the upper
panel of Fig. (2), the effect of f0 > 0 is to shift the infecteds peak at longer
times by keeping a still high reproduction number. The effects of lockdowns,
using relation Eq. (13), are displayed in the lower panel of the figure, for the
typical cases
p τ0 = 18 days and q = 2. Notice that according to Eq. (14),
∼
tlock = 18 0.66/0.06 ∼
= 60 days, and the infecteds peak is reduced by a
factor of about 4.
Let us return to Eq. (11). In the language of random graph theory (Erdős
and Rényi (1960); Erdős (1973); Bollobás (2013)), Eq. (11) is formally equivalent to the self-consistent relation for the fraction of nodes, P∞ ≡ 1 − s(∞),
belonging to the giant component of random graphs with a finite mean node
degree hki, given by,

P (∞) = 1 − e−hkip P (∞) ,
(15)
where 0 < p < 1 is the probability of occupancy of a link between two nodes.
It can be shown that a giant cluster exists when hki p = c > 1. This model
is also related to the mean-field theory of random spin glasses with finite
coordination number (see e.g. Kanter and Sompolinsky (1987)). Clearly,
P (∞) → 1 if c → ∞, while for c − 1 = ε, with 0 ≤ ε  1 we find,
P (∞) = 2p

c−1
,
c2

when c → 1+ .

(16)

The correspondence with Eq. (11) is achieved if we take R̄0 ≡ c and assume
s(0) = 1, which is the case since s(0) ≈ 1 in our spreading model. Using
1 − s(∞) = r(∞), we find,
r(∞) = 2

R̄0 − 1
,
R̄02

when R̄0 → 1+ .

(17)

This correspondence is actually not surprising since the SIR equations are
valid in a mean-field sense, where fluctuations and correlations among the
categories are neglected. This analogy suggests us that we should go beyond mean-field theory by studying infectious spreading on a network where
correlations can be implemented. This is done in the following Section.
3. Spreading phenomena on random graphs: Percolation concepts
Tracing infecteds in a population and how they move is essential to make
an accurate assessment of the extent of which a virus has spread in a region,
7

country or the whole world, in order to implement effective lockdowns in each
particular place (see e.g. Chinazzi et al. (2020)). Here we discuss a simple
network model defined on a two dimensional square lattice. The sites of the
lattice represent individuals belonging to one of the four categories (S, I, R,
D), which we will distinguish with different colors in the plots, i.e. green,
red, blue, and yellow, respectively.
Two individuals are said to be connected, i.e. transmission of the disease
can occur, if they are nearest-neighbors (NN) on the lattice, representing a
‘short-range’ contact interaction. The NN choice is done just for convenience,
and it can be relaxed in other versions of the model. The bonds between sites
represent therefore the links in the graph, and the coordination number of 4
gives the maximum node degree, under ‘static’ conditions. The latter mean
that the individuals are considered to be at rest in their lattice locations,
initially, while the virus can move around from site to site if the following
rules are obeyed: (1) The virus can cross a bond from an infected site to a
susceptible one; (2) no virus transmission occurs otherwise; (3) infected sites
heal after τH days, becoming recovered sites, so that they can neither infect
others nor being infected again (immune sites); and (4) dormant sites do not
participate in the spreading process.
It is essential to consider additional links ‘dynamically’ as the spreading
goes on. This is done in order to describe those individuals who move around
for different reasons. Thus, any infected site can reach sites which are not
NN to it, and the infection can spread according to the above rules. In this
case, the infection is transmitted with a probability βL = 1/τL , with τL > 1,
provided the target site is a susceptible one.
In summary, we have taken a two dimensional lattice to facilitate the
visualization of the network, and considering both NN transmissions as well
as long-range ones, though with a lower probability. Since the extra links
are not determined from the beginning, but are added dynamically, we do
not show them in the plots, facilitating the identification of the categories.
Another reason for choosing a square lattice is that the percolation threshold
for site percolation (in this case the susceptible sites) is about 0.6, meaning
that if we take say, f0 = 1/2, there is no percolating (‘infinite’) cluster of
susceptibles on the lattice. This ‘hindering’ effect is useful when implementing lockdowns, since the remaining susceptible clusters (of connected NN
sites) are disconnected from each other (they are indeed ‘finite’). One can
say that ‘long-range’ links can connect different susceptible clusters, which
otherwise would remain disconnected.

(100x100) square lattice represents an individual belonging to one of the four categories:
(S) Susceptible (green), (I) Infected (red), (R) Recovered (blue), (D) Dormant (yellow).

model parameters are: τI = 2 (transmission time) and β = 1/τI = 1/2, τH = 30 (healing
time) and γ = 1/30, yielding R0 = β/γ = 15, and τL = 10 (long range transmision
time) yielding βL = 1/10. Times are expressed in days. The average node degree for
the starting configuration is hki = 2, while additional links are added dynamically as
the network evolves in time. The newly created links yield an additional mean degree
h∆ki = 1110/5043 ∼
= 0.22, corresponding to an effective mean node degree hkeff i = 2.22.

lockdowns (t = 20); (Upper right) t = 50; (Lower left) t = 60; (Lower right) t = 70.
The model parameters are: τ0 = 20 (start of lockdowns) and τL = ∞ (no long range
transmission time) yielding βL = 0. The average node degree for the starting configuration
is hki = 2, while additional links are added dynamically until t = τ0 . The newly created
links yield an additional mean degree h∆ki = 156/5043 ∼
= 0.03, corresponding to an
effective mean node degree hkeff i = 2.03.

We show in Fig. 3 and 4 results of simulations for a single configuration,
without and with lockdowns, respectively, on a (100x100) lattice for times
t ≤ 100 days. Fixed boundary conditions are employed. The starting con10

figuration has a random distribution of either susceptible or dormant sites,
chosen with probability f0 = 1/2. The initial conditions include a single
infected site right at the center of the lattice, and none recovereds. We keep
track of the existing infected sites, each carrying a clock which starts ticking
when the site gets infected. After a time τL it becomes recovered (immune).
Death sites are not implemented, but they can be estimated simply as a
fraction of recovereds.

(Lower panel) Lockdowns: t ≥ τ0 = 20.

11

We count the number of dynamical links generated during the spreading,
from which we can determine, a posteriori, the effective mean node degree,
hkeff i, in our network. We find hkeff i ∼
= 2.22 without lockdowns (Fig. 3) and
∼
hkeff i = 2.03 with lockdowns (Fig. 4), indicating that effectively, hkeff i f0 & 1.
It turns out that the relatively small reduction of the mean node degree in
the presence of lockdowns is sufficient to reduce the number of infecteds
considerably, as one can see from the very different structure of recovereds
clusters from both figures. The time evolution of the three categories are
displayed in Fig. 5, and look qualitatively similar to those from the SIR
model in Fig. 2. We should mention that a single lattice simulation takes
few seconds on a typical laptop, even for lattices of size (400x400), allowing
to obtain accurate mean values by averaging over several configurations.
4. Analisys of COVID-19 USA data
As an application of the present ideas we consider COVID-19 USA data
(see also Wu et al. (2020); Dong et al. (2020); Xu et al. (2020)), from the
point of view of both SIR and network models. In order to do so, and due
to the complexity of the data, we need to introduce additional features in
particular for the SIR model.
For the USA data (Fig. 6), the lockdown regime can be described by the
Ansatz, similar to Eq. (13),
β̄(t) = β̄D

 τ q(t)
0

t

, t ≥ τ0 ,

(18)

where β̄D = (βD /γ)(1 − f0 ), with a time dependent exponent q only for the
SIR model.
Let us consider first the case of SIR (upper panel in Fig. 6). For the latter,
we use the decreasing function with time, q(t) = q−t/100, with q = 2.5. This
feature was needed in order to reproduce the slowly decreasing behavior of the
daily cases (blue circles in Fig. 6). In addition, a rather complicated form for
the factor d(t) determining the time evolution of deaths, Deaths= d(t)×R(t),
was required. We find that the form d(t) = 0.17[0.3 + 1/(t/60)] reproduces
the curve of deaths quite well (black circles in Fig. 6), but the results might
be improved using more parameters. This remains to be understood. The
whole fitting curves were shifted in time by an amount tLag = 29 days, that
is, the initial data were actually discarded from the fits.

12

Figure 6: Time evolution of COVID-19 in the USA. SIR model (upper panel): N =
3 106 , f0 = 1/2, β = 0.65, γ = 1/30, R̄0 = 9.75; Lockdowns: τ0 = 36, βD = 0.45,
q(t) = 2.5 − t/100, d(t) = 0.17(0.3 + 1/(1 + t/60)). Time lag tLag = 29. Network model
(lower panel): L = 400, N = 90 106 , β = 0.65, γ = 1/30, R̄0 = 9.75, βL = 1/8, hki =
1.994, h∆ki = 661/79900 ∼
= 0.008 and hkeff i = 2.002; Lockdowns: τ0 = 20, βD = 0.55,
βLD = 1/32, q = 2.5, d = 0.06. Time lag tLag = 45 for cases and tLag = 21 for deaths.
Data up to May 25, 2020.

13

In the case of the network model (lower panel in Fig. 6), the situation is
simpler since all parameters can be taken as constants, the values depending
on the regime under consideration. Regarding lockdowns (t ≥ τ0 ), the value
q = 2.5 works rather well, while we take a finite long-range transmission
probability βLD = 1/32, i.e. 4 times smaller than its value βL = 1/8 (t < τ0 ),
suggesting that indeed the lockdowns are not fully implemented and few
additional infecteds are still moving around. Also the number of deaths can
be estimated from the actual recovereds using a single value d = 0.06 (6%).
As well as in the case of SIR, also here we used times lags for the fits, i.e.
tLag = 45 for the cases and tLag = 21 for deaths.
5. Conclusions
We have introduced a network model for infectious disease spreading in
a population based on random graph and percolation theory concepts. The
model is conveniently defined on a square lattice which permits a simple
visualization of the four different categories in the problem: Infecteds, susceptibles, recovereds and dormants. The first three groups form the core of
the widely used SIR model, while the fourth one is introduced here representing those individuals who are disconnected to some extent from the rest
of the population. They do not participate in the spreading phenomena but
their presence acts as an effective slowing down of spreading by blocking an
otherwise direct transmission between infecteds and susceptibles. In the language of percolation theory, the ‘connected’ susceptibles form finite clusters
on the lattice which are separated from each other. To allow the spreading
to overcome these ‘connection gaps’ as the process evolves in time, we allow
infecteds to reach any other susceptible site in the lattice, and infect it with
a relatively lower probability than inside a finite cluster via NN contacts. We
denote these new links, not present initially in the ‘lattice graph’, dynamical
links. This dynamical approach allows us to describe lockdown effects in
terms of the slowing down or total lacking of the dynamical links.
We have assessed the performance of the network model by fitting COVID19 USA data and compared the results with predictions using the SIR model.
The network model works very well by just using constant parameters, while
the SIR model requires more involved time dependent parameters to achieved
similar fitting accuracy. We conclude that the present network model can
become a valuable technique to complement the widely used SIR model.
