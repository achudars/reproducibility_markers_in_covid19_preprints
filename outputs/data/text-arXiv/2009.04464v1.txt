Abstract
Snowball designs are the most natural of the network sampling
designs. They have many desirable properties for sampling hidden and
hard-to reach populations. They have been under-used in recent years
because simple design-based estimators and confidence intervals have not
been available for them. The needed estimation methods are supplied in
this paper. Snowball sampling methods and accurate estimators with
them are needed for sampling of the people exposed to the animals from
which new coronavirus outbreaks originate, and to sample the animal
populations to which they are exposed. Accurate estimates are needed
to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions to reduce the risk to the
people exposed to the animals. In this way the frequencies of major
outbreaks and pandemics can be reduced. Snowball designs are needed
in studies of sexual and opioid networks through which HIV can spread
explosively, so that prevention intervention methods can be developed,
accurately assessed, and effectively distributed.

Introduction

In network sampling, social links are followed from one person to another in
selecting the sample of people from a subpopulation that might otherwise be
hard to reach. The most natural of the network designs is snowball sampling,
in which any number of the links out from each person may be followed. So if
a person in the sample has two partners or contacts, either zero, one, or two of
those contacts are added to the sample, depending the selection probabilities
of the links. For another person in the sample with ten links to contacts, any
number from zero to ten links may be followed. In turn, links out from the

new people in the sample are followed at the next wave. In this way the
sample may grow fast or slowly, depending on the link-tracing probabilities
and also depending on the numbers and configuration of the links in the social
network of the target population.
In some snowball surveys, a respondent is not allowed to recruit a person
who has already been recruited into the sample. This results in a network
sample with tree structure (Figure 1). In other cases it may be natural to
allow re-recruitments. Usually the survey protocol will not allow re-cruitment
of a person by the same person that recruited them earlier, but will allow
re-recruitment of a sample member by a different recruiter. This results in
samples with network structure more general than a treee (Figure 2). Note
that most people in the sample have roles as both recruitees and recruiters.
The nature of snowball sampling brings different people into the sample
with different probabilities. To estimate the characteristics of the target
population, such as mean number of partners or proportion of people with a
characteristic such as a risk-related behavior, the different inclusion
probabilities for different sample members should be taken into account. A
sample mean or sample proportion gives each person equal weight and so
results in a estimate that is biased in comparison to the actual population
mean or proportion. Unbiased estimators in this design-based sense have been
available for only simple forms of snowball sampling, such as a complete
one-wave snowball sample where the inclusion probabilities for the initial
sample are known. The problem with more general snowball samples, with
many waves and link-tracing probabilities less than one, is that the inclusion
probabilities are not known. In fact they can not be exactly calculated from
the sample data because they depend on the population network outside the
sample as well as within it, as well as depending on the sampling design.
This inference problem has kept snowball sampling designs from being
more widely used than they should be. In this paper we present new
estimators for key population characteristics from snowball samples. The
method is based on estimating the unit inclusion probabilities from the sample
data in interaction with the network sampling design. The method is
design-based and data-based. It does not assume a statistical form of model
for the population network.
Snowball designs are currently being used to collect data on people with
exposure to animals, in order to understand and prevent the emergence of
novel species of the coronavirus family that jump from animals to humans and
lead to emergence of epidemics or pandemics every few years. Snowball
designs are used in some studies of key populations at high risk for HIV, such
as sex workers, clients of sex workers, and networks of people who mis-use
opioids and other drugs that are in some cases injected. Contact-tracing
designs of people exposed to sexually transmitted diseases or exposed to
someone with the new disease covid-19, where the purpose is primarily to find
cases and make interventions, rather than inference, also are of snowball form.
Because the of the importance of the snowball studies of in relation to
emergence of outbreaks of new coronavirus species in humans, and the fact
4

that those studies are recent and not so well known, that example will be
described at some length next. Subsequent sections will describe the method
proposed here and evaluate it in relation to alternatives.
Snowball sampling designs have many important uses in the real world. In
this paper we will focus on three. One concerns the prevention of future
pandemics caused by emergence of new species in the coronavirus family. The
second, related to the first, involves spatial adaptive designs for animal species
with uneven distributions. The third involves studies of sexual and opioid
networks with high risk of HIV, the human immunodeficiency virus.

1.1

Outbreaks of new species of coronavirus in humans

Virus species of the coronavirus family are adept at transfering from one
mammal host species to another, adapting to the new host environment
through genetic mutations and recombinations ([Latinne et al., 2020]). These
can include transfers from bats, civets, raccoon dogs, pangolins and other
species to humans ([Graham and Baric, 2010], [Tang et al., 2020],
[Andersen et al., 2020], [Montgomery and Macdonald, 2020]). Bat species are
considered likely to be the main reservoir for viruses in the the coronavirus
family. These transfers to humans are moderately common. Most of these die
out as the person infected recovered or dies, or they infect just a few people
close to that person before dying out ([Zhou et al., 2020]). But a small
proportion of these transfer viruses catch on and become major outbreaks.
Since the start of the 21st Century there have been three major outbreaks
of coronavirus species in humans. These are SARS ( the species SARS-CoV-1)
in 2002, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), in 2012, and
covid-19 (caused by the coronavirus species SARS-CoV-2), in 2019, and at the
time of this writing a worldwide pandemic. More such outbreaks and
pandemics are widely expected by virologists and epidemiologists unless some
interventions can make conditions less favorable to them.
[Li et al., 2019] used snowball sampling to obtain a sample across three
provinces in the south of China of 1596 people at-risk through their exposure
to animals. Eight study regions were selected in areas known to have diverse
coronaviruses in bat populations roosting close to human dwellings. The study
targeted “human populations that are highly exposed to bats and other
wildlife, including people who visit or work around bat caves, work in local live
animal markets, raise animals, or are involved in wildlife trade (e.g., wild
animal harvest, trade, transportation, and preparation), as identified by
previous exploratory ethnographic interviews.”
Sample members were given a questionnaire about risk-related and
protective behaviors and their experiences with flu-like and SARS-like
symptoms, and were given antibody tests for evidence of past infection with
bat coronavirus. The blood tests identified 9 individuals (0.6%) who were
positive for bat coronaviruses. 73 (5%) reported symptoms fever with cough
and shortness of breath or difficulty breathing within the last 12 months, and
227 (14%) reported fever with muscle aches, cough, or sore throat symptoms
5

within the last 12 months.
When asked about protective measures, among the 502 participants who
purchased animals from wet markets in the past 12 months 194, (39%) had
taken measures such as washing hands, purchasing live animals less often , or
purchasing meat at supermarkets instead of live animal markets. Only 7 (1%)
had considered wearing a mask while visiting the markets, with the same
number having considered wearing gloves.
Each reported percentage is the unweighted sample mean (divided by 100).
Much more accurate estimates for each of those quantities can be calculated
using the method proposed in this paper.
The need for accurate estimates becomes acute when we consider
evaluating the effectiveness of an intervention. Suppose an intervention
program is introduced to a community to increase the wearing of gloves when
working in the markets. We need to compare wearing gloves in the community
before and after the intervention, or with the rate in a community without the
intervention program. If the estimates are highly biased or erratic in their
statistical properties, then the comparisons may be in error and lead to
choosing the less effective intervention for roll-out on a larger scale.
A number of studies have sampled bats from their natural habitaats, tested
them for coronavirus species, and through phylogenetic analyses established
their relationship to species that have infected or can infect humans
([Ge et al., 2013], [Li et al., 2005], [Wang et al., 2006],
[Wang and Anderson, 2019], [Olival et al., 2017b], [Olival et al., 2017a],
[Hu et al., 2017], [Corman et al., 2015]).
[Huong et al., 2020] sampled the animals, rather than the humans, along a
supply chain in the wildlife trade in Vietnam. The animals on their way to
market and restaurants were tested for infection with bat coronavirus species.
They found that the infection rate increased along the supply chain. For
example, field rats for food, in the possession of the trappers who catch them
wild in the field, had a 21% infection rate. For rats in the markets, the
infection rate was 32%. At the restaurants that served wild animal dishes, the
infection rate in the rats was 56%. The presumed reason for the amplification
of infection rate along the supply chain was overcrowding in the cages the
animals were transported and held in, so that infection rapidly spread between
the animals.
If the infection rate of the animals is higher at a point in the supply chain,
then the risk to the people who work with them will be higher there.
The way to prevent future outbreaks and pandemics of emerging species of
coronavirus in humans is to decrease the frequency of occurrences of transfers
of coronavirises from animals to people. Most of those transfer strains die out
before producing any significant outbreak, but some small proportion of them
will catch on to produce serious outbreaks as well as new pandemics. If there
are less frequent transfers, there should be correspondingly less frequent
outbreaks and pandemics.
So far in the 21st Century the serious outbreaks have come 7 and 10 years
apart, so the next one could be anticipated to arrive not far in the future. If
6

through interventions the frequency of transfers could be reduced to one-third
its current value, then the next outbreak instead of 7 or 10 years, might be 21
or 30 years in the future. The anticipated outbreaks before then would have
been prevented.
Potential interventions suggested by the currently available studies would
include programs to increase the use of protective measures like washing hands
and use of gloves and masks in working with animals. To reduce the
amplification of infection rates along the supply chain, safer and more humane
transfer cages would need to be designed and required.
Sampling both of the people exposed to animals and of the animals they
are potentially exposed to will be required to accurately assess the
effectiveness of different intervention strategies and select thereby the best
interventions to make. The key missing tool up to this point has been an
accurate, robust estimation method for snowball sampling designs. The
purpose of this paper is to present such a method.

1.2

Adaptive spatial designs for animal species

In addition to snowball sampling of the people exposed to animals, we need to
sample the animals they are exposed to, in order to estimate the prevalence of
coronavirus infection in those animals, and to obtain the genetic sequences of
those virus. In some cases the sampling of the animals will be straightforward,
using conventional sampling design features such as random sampling without
replacement and stratification. This may be the the case in markets and
wildlife farms. If we need to sample wild animals living nearby the people,
such as bats with natural roosting sites in trees, adaptive spatial designs could
be useful.
The adaptive designs work by starting with an initial conventional sample,
such as a random sample of spatial units. Whenever a significant number of
animals is found in a sample unit, its neighboring units are added to the
sample. If any of those has significance abundance, its neighbors in turn are
added, and so on ([Thompson, 1990]). In ([Thompson, 2006], which was first
about network designs for estimating prevalence of risk behaviors for HIV, it is
shown that any of the spatially adaptive design can be re-framed as a network
sampling problem (see also [Thompson, 2011]. In ([Thompson, 2006] this was
done for a spatially uneven population of wintering waterfowl, and proved very
effective there. In the same way the network sampling estimators proposed in
the present paper can be used for adaptive spatial sampling designs and have
some advantages in terms over previous estimators for adaptive sampling
designs in terms of simplicity and flexibility.
The re-framing of an adaptive spatial design as network sampling works as
follows. In the spatial setting supposse for simplicity the sampling units are
square plots covering the study region. Convert each square plot to a circle
representing a node in a network. If plot i has animals in it, then if we observe
i it will lead us to any of its neighbors. So for a neighbor j draw an arrow from
i to j. If unit j has animals in it, then if it was observed first it would lead us
7

to i, so draw an arrow from j to i. With arrows in both directions, the link
between i and j is symmetric, so it can also be drawn as a simple line. Now
suppose unit j has no animal in it. Then it will not lead us to its neighbor i.
So there is an arrow from i to j but not from j to i. So the link is directional
here, and we get a network that is partially directional. The estimation
method work fine with the directional links in the network. This re-framing is
illustrated in the figures of [Thompson, 2006] and [Thompson, 2011].

1.3

HIV-at-risk sexual networks, opioid networks

With the HIV epidemic the key populations at risk include people who inject
drugs non-medically, people who sell or buy sex, or trade it for drugs or
tangible goods, and men who have sex with men. To study these people and
try to alleviate the epidemic, ethnographers and health outreach workers used
link-tracing methods. In the 1980s and 1990s these were usually in the form of
snowball designs.
Snowball sampling methods were used in [Potterat et al., 1999] to obtain
data on the entire network and people of a population at risk for heterosexual
and drug-related spread of HIV. In the study, investigators endeavoured to
find the individuals at both ends of every relevant relationship. Because of the
relative geographic isolation of the high-risk population, they were able to
obtain essentially the entire population and its network structure. This
population data set has been invaluable to studies of network sampling and
estimation methodologies. It is used in this paper for the simulations to
evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed estimators for snowball network
designs in comparison with other estimation methods.
Snowball sampling designs, the most freely-branching of the network
designs, are useful for studying the sexual and injection-related networks in
which HIV spreads. [Peters et al., 2016] and [Campbell et al., 2017] report on
a study in which contact tracing was used after an HIV outbreak associated
with opioid misuse in Indiana had spread rapidly. The traced network
together with phylogenetic data from sequencing of virus strains was used to
determine where the outbreak started and how it spread.
Snowball designs are generally the preferred network sampling method for
bringing interventions to benefit a population. Contact tracing for sexually
transmitted diseases has long used snowball sampling. An individual who tests
positive for the disease is asked to identify all their recent sexual partners.
Investigators attempt to find each of those partners, inform them of their
potential exposure, test then for the infection and, if the test is positive, to
treat them to cure the infection and then in turn try to trace all their partners
and do the same. In the current coronavirus pandemic, contact tracing of
individuals who test positive involves finding all their recent contacts and at
minimum to advise those individuals to self-isolate for a period. And in the
more thorough versions, the contacts when found are also tested and, if a test
is positive, that person’s contacts are traced as well.
For HIV there is currently no cure or vaccine available. There are effective
8

interventions such as increasing use of condoms and targeting condom use to
the early period in any new relationship. In [Thompson, 2017] it is shown that
distributing such an intervention program to some proportion of the
population using a snowball network design is highly effective in comparison to
the same intervention distributed to the same proportion of the population by
other methods.

1.4

Snowball sampling

Early uses of network sampling for hard-to-reach populations typically used
snowball sampling methods. Ethnographers studying drug users and other
hidden populations wanted to know as many of the relationships in the
community so tried to follow every referral to social partners. The data was
summarized by unweighted sample means and proportions [[Spreen, 1992],
[Heckathorn, 1997], and [Thompson and Collins, 2002]]. Design-based
estimates of population values from relatively simple network sampling designs
were obtained by [Birnbaum and Sirken, 1965] and [Frank, 1977],
[Frank and Snijders, 1994], and [Birnbaum and Sirken, 1965].
[Snijders, 1992] reviewed the literature on snowball sampling for inference
about population values. The estimates at that time were limited to the more
simple snowball designs, such as one-wave designs with symmetric. He
concluded that snowball sampling is more suited for inference about the links
than for inference about the nodes. [Heckathorn, 2011]
[Handcock and Gile, 2011] look at different uses of the term “snowball
sampling”.
Model-based methods can work well for snowball designs but, in addition
to requiring a stochastic network model for the population, may be limited too
specific forms of snowball designs, such as ones in which all links are traced
out to a certain number of waves ([Chow and Thompson, 2003a],
[Chow and Thompson, 2003b], [Thompson and Frank, 2000]).
[Pattison et al., 2013] assume an exponential random graph model and
describe a conditional estimation strategy for estimating parameters of the
model, with attention to computational efficiency so that large samples can be
handled. The focus is on identifying structural characteristics of the
population network, such as stars and triangles of various types.. Values of
nodes, such as whether an animal is infected or the person handling it wears
gloves, are not usually included in this type of model. The method appears to
work well for its intended purposes. [Handcock and Gile, 2007] provide an
informative discussion of design characteristics in relation to model-based
inferences for network samples. [Handcock and Gile, 2010] describe a Bayesian
model based approach for inference from snowball samples. The method works
well but is limited to specific types of snowball designs, such as those where
every like is followed out to some wave. The main limitation of the
model-based estimation methods for snowball sampling may be to scale-up,
because the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method required in the computations
get slow as sample size increases. [Atkinson and Flint, 2001] review the
9

methodology for snowball sampling and conclude that snowball sampling is
highly effective for finding members of a hidden population but that statistical
inference from snowball samples was at the time of their writing problematical.
[Thompson, 2006] gives a design-based strategy for snowball network
designs with estimation based on one or another simple, if inefficient, initial
estimator. That estimate is improved using the Rap-Blackwell method, which
finds the conditional expectation of the initial estimator given the minimal
sufficient statistics. In the network designs considered the minimal sufficient
statistics is the set of distinct units in the sample, not counting repeat
selections and not distinguishing order of selection. The estimates obtained
are exactly unbiased and are very efficient, having low variance because of the
Rao-Blackwell improvement. However, the method requires control over the
initial design that may not be achieved in practice with hard-to-reach
populations, and because of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo needed to do the
Rao-Blackwell computations, may be limited in terms of scale up to large
sample sizes.
In contrast to snowball sampling, the methodology of
Respondent-Driven-Sampling ([Heckathorn, 1997]), limited the number of
contacts a respondent could refer to a small number, typically 3. Estimators
for these designs based on random walk theory and assumptions of Markov
transitions in the sampling between values of attribute variables of
respondents were given in [Salganik and Heckathorn, 2004],
[Heckathorn, 2007], and [Volz and Heckathorn, 2008]. In a random walk design
only one link is traced from the currently selected person, and the sampling is
done with replacement. If a random walk is run in a network consisting of a
single connected component, the long term frequency of inclusion of node i is
proportional to di . Variations on these early approaches, still relying on the
assumption of a random walk design or Markov transitions include
[Gile, 2011], [Baraff et al., 2016], and [Rohe et al., 2019].
Among network sampling designs, a snowball design is at the opposite end
of the spectrum from a random walk design. A freely-branching snowball
design allows unlimited branching, up to however many links are available,
and is usually carried out without-replacement. For these reasons the
estimators based on the random walk assumption have never been
recommended for snowball designs, nor should they be.
The idea of the new estimation method is very simple. We run a sampling
process similar to the actual survey design on the sample network data and
use the inclusion frequencies in the sampling process to estimate the inclusion
probability of each sample unit in the real-world sampling. With the estimated
inclusion probabilities, well-established sampling inference methods can be
used for population estimates and confidence intervals. Two approaches to the
re-sampling are repeated re-samples and a Markov chain resampling process.
For the simulations we use the resampling process because it is
computationally much faster.
The estimation method and why it works are described more exactly in the
Methods section.

2.1

Methods
The new estimation method

In traditional survey sampling with unequal probabilities of inclusion for
different people, typical estimators divide an observed value yi for the ith
person by the inclusion probability πi that person. A variable of interest yi
can be binary, for example 1 if the person tests positive for a virus and 0
otherwise, or can be more generally quantitative, such as viral load. The
inverse-weighting gives an unbiased or low-bias estimate of the population
proportion or mean of that variable. In network surveys the inclusion
probabilities are unknown so they need to be estimated.
The estimators described in this report first estimate the inclusion
probability of each person in the sample by selecting many resamples from the
network sample data using a design that adheres in key features to the actual
survey design used to find the sample. In particular, the resampling design is a
link-tracing design done without-replacement and with branching, as was the
original design. The frequency fi with which an individual is included in the
resamples is used as an estimate of that person’s inclusion probability πi .
What we do is select T resamples S1 , S2 , ..., ST from the sample network
data. There are two approaches to selecting the sequence of resamples. In the
repeated-samples approach each resample is selected independently from seeds
and progresses step-by-step to target resample size independently of every
other resample, so we get a collection of independent resamples. in the
sampling-process approach each resample St is selected from the resample
St−1 just before it by randomly tracing a few links out and randomly
removing a few nodes from the previous resample and using a small rate of
re-seeding so we do not get locked out of any component by chance. It is this
Markov resampling process approach that we use for the simulations in this
paper because it is so computationally efficient.
For an individual i in the original sample, there is a sequence of zeros and
ones Zi1 , Zi2 , ..., ZiT , where Zt is 1 if that person is included in resample St
and is 0 if the person is not included in that resample. The inclusion frequency
for person i is
1
(1)
fi = (Zi1 + Zi2 + ... + ZiT )
T
Individuals centrally located in sample components tend to have high
values of fi . That is because there are more paths, and paths of higher
probability, leading the sample to those individuals. Also, individuals in larger
components tend to have larger fi than individuals in smaller components, so
that the method is estimating inclusion probability of an individual relative to
all other sample units, not just those in the same component or local area or
the sample This is because of the self-allocation of the branching design, even
in the absence of re-seeding, to areas of the social network having more links
and connected paths.

Results

The new estimators are evaluated and compared with the current estimates
using the network data on the hidden population at risk for HIV enumerated
in the Colorado Springs study on the heterosexual transmission of HIV
[[Potterat et al., 1999]], also known as the Project 90 study. The study was so
thorough in finding every linked person that it provides the most relevant
network data set that can be considered as an entire at-risk population for the
purpose of comparing sampling designs and estimators. In the simulations, the
population size is 5492, the number of people in the data set. From this
population a sample of 1200 people is selected, using a snowball design. For
resampling the target resample size is 400. For each of 1000 samples of size
1200 each, 10,000 resamples were selected, each resample of size about 400.
The population and the simulation methods are described in more detail in
the Methods section.
The most commonly used estimator with network surveys in current
practice is the VH estimator. The other variations in use such as SH are
related to it and are based on the same assumptions plus the additional
assumption of a first-order Markov process in transitions between node
attribute values during the sampling. The SH estimator is used mainly for
binary attribute variables. For categorical variables it has the property that
the proportion estimates do not add to one without extra adjusting of one
kind or another, and it is not well suited to continuous variables.

3.1

Mean degree and concurrency

Among the most important quantities to estimate in relation to spread of HIV
are the means and proportions of link-related variables. Two of widespread
interest are mean degree and concurrency. Mean degree is the average number
of partners per person in the population. The most common definition of
concurrency is the proportion of people in the population who have two or

more partners. This and related definitions of concurrency and their role in
spreading HIV are discussed in [Kretzschmar and Morris, 1996],
[Morris and Kretzschmar, 1997], and [Admiraal et al., 2016]. A high number
for either of these is an indication that an epidemic could spread rapidly in the
population once it starts there. With the reference data set we are using for
the simulations, a link indicates either a sexual relationship, a drug
relationship, or a friendship relationship. Because friendship is included, the
proportion of people with at least one relationship is very close to 1.00.
Therefore we use a definition of concurrency here, which might be called
“k-concurrency with k=10,” where a person is concurrent if they have more
than 10 relationships. The true proportion of this is .82. The purpose here is
to compare estimation methods for the mean of a characteristic of a node that
is highly related to links. Because inclusion probabilities in network sampling
depend on the pattern of links in the population in interaction with the
design, these variables are the most sensitive to choice of estimator.
The bars in Figure 3 show the mean squared error of three estimators for
estimating mean degree with the regular snowball design. We include the
sample mean as an estimator because it is the one most commonly used to
summarize
the results in a snowball survey. We include the estimator
P
µ̂d = [(yi /di )/(1/di )], which uses the self-reported degree di as in place of
the inclusion probability πi in Brewer’s estimator, because it is widely used,
though not recommended for snowball sampling. It would be the correct
estimator, equal to Brewers, if the design used had been a random walk
instead of a snowball design, and if he self-reported degrees were accurate. It
was used by [Salganik and Heckathorn, 2004] to estimate mean degree and by
[Volz and Heckathorn, 2008] for estimating any kind of variable. We
abbreviate it here VH.
Looking at the actual numbers represented in Figure 3, with the snowball
design the MSEs of y-bar, VH, and the new estimator are respectively
40.453589, 7.249053, and 0.264755. Dividing the MSE of the sample mean by
that of the new estimator gives thee relative efficiency of the new estimator as
153. The relative efficiency of the new estimator for the VH estimator is 29.
The high MSE of the sample mean and VH for snowball sampling is almost
entirely due to bias. For any estimator MSE = Variance + (Bias)2 . For the
sample mean, the bias squared is over 99% of the variance. For the VH the
squared bias is 99% of the variance. So a bar plot of the bias of the estimators
looks almost exactly the same as the bar plot for MSE in Figure 3.
The large biases result from using the wrong sampling weights in the
estimators in relation to the actual inclusion probabilities πi . The new
estimator estimates those inclusion probabilities using the sample network of
the data in interaction with the actual snowball design used or a close
approximation to it. Because the estimated inclusion probabilities fi come out
close to proportional to the actual inclusion probabilities πi , the bias is
virtually eliminated with the new estimation method.
For the snowball design allowing re-recruiitments the relative efficiency of
the new estimator to y-bar for estimating mean degree is 329, and to VH the
15

relative efficiency of the new estimator is 59. The high MSEs of y-bar and VH
again are mostly due to bias.
For the estimate of k-concurrency, with k = 10, the MSE values with the
regular snowball design for y-bar, VH, and the new estimator are 0.010717
0.043369 0.000447. The relative efficiency of the new estimator to the sample
mean is 24. The relative efficiency of the new estimator to the VH estimator is
97. The squared bias accounts for 99% of the MSE of y-bar, and 98% of the
MSE of the VH estimator.
For the snowball design allowing re-recruitments the relative efficiency of
the new estimator to y-bar for estimating k-concurrency, with k = 10, is 17,
and to VH the relative efficiency of the new estimator is 70. The high MSEs of
y-bar and VH again are explained largely by the bias due to the incorrect
weightings relative to the inclusion probabilities of the snowball design used in
the survey.
Notice also that the magnitudes of MSE of y-bar and VH reverse in
relation to each other, with VH performing better than y-bar for mean degree
and worse than VH for k-concurrency. When the sampling weights of
estimators differ significantly from the inclusion probabilities of the survey, the
estimators not only perform poorly in most cases, but the performance is
erratic, depending on the exact configuration of values of variables of interest
and of the sampling weights in the population. In the present study, only the
new estimator, with its inclusion probabilities estimated from the sample data
and the actual design, performed consistently well for every variable and with
each design.

3.2

Attribute variables

The Colorado Springs Study node data includes 13 individual attribute
variables such as sex worker, client of sex worker, or unemployed. These are
variables 1 through 13 in Table 1. For an individual, the value is 1 if the
individual has the attribute and 0 otherwise. The object for inference for each
attribute is to estimate the proportion of people in the population having that
attribute. Most of these variables, such as sex or race or employment status,
are not strongly or consistently related to inclusion probabilities. Still, for
design-based estimators to work well it helps to have the estimated inclusion
probabilities close to the actual inclusion probabilities. For the simulations,
missing values were arbitrarily set to zero so that sample sizes would be the
same for all variables.
With a conventional simple random sampling design for estimating a
population proportion, the mean squared error of the estimate is a
parabola-shaped function of the actual population proportion. The actual
proportion has to be between zero and one. The MSE is highest when the
actual proportion is one-half and the MSE is zero when the actual proportion
is zero or one. With the network designs and their unequal inclusion
probabilities the situation is more complex, but it is still the case that the
actual proportion has to be between zero and one and that the MSE will be

Actual proportion

Figure 5: With the regular snowball design, the mean squared error of three
estimators of population proportion for each of 13 individual attributes. The
three estimators are the sample mean (Y-BAR, white), weighting by reciprocal
of self-reported degree (VH, yellow), and the new estimator (NEW, black).The
new estimator (black) is compared to the current estimator (yellow). To help
see the pattern, the MSE for estimating the compliment of each attribute is
also shown. The compliment of sex work client, for example, is not-client. A
parabolic curve is fitted by weighted least squares to the MSEs of the new estimator (solid line) and the current estimator (dashed line). The new estimator
MSEs have the lowest fitted curve and the best fit.

Actual proportion

Figure 6: With the snowball design allowing re-recruiitments, the mean squared
error of three estimators of population proportion for each of 13 individual attributes. The three estimators are the sample mean (Y-BAR, white), weighting by reciprocal of self-reported degree (VH, yellow), and the new estimator
(NEW, black).The new estimator (black) is compared to the current estimator
(yellow). To help see the pattern, the MSE for estimating the compliment of
each attribute is also shown. The compliment of sex work client, for example,
is not-client. A parabolic curve is fitted by weighted least squares to the MSEs
of the new estimator (solid line) and the current estimator (dashed line). The
new estimator MSEs have the lowest fitted curve and the best fit.

zero if the actual proportion is zero or one.
To help see the pattern in the mean squared errors for estimating the
population proportions of the 13 attribute variables, the MSE for each variable
is plotted in Figure 3 against the actual proportion of people having that
attribute in the Colorado Springs study population. For each of the 13
variables, we can also estimate the proportion for its complement. The
compliment of “client”, for example, is “not client”. The proportion for the
compliment is 1 minus the proportion with the attribute, and the MSE for
estimation of the compliment is the same as the the MSE for estimation of the
original variable. This gives us 26 variables for each plot in Figure 3, with
actual proportions ranging from near 0 to near 1. The original variables are on
the left, since the actual proportions are all less than one-half. The compliment
variables provide redundant information but clarify the pattern in the MSEs.
The MSE with the new estimator (black in plots) is lower than that of the
current estimator in all cases except for some of the ones with actual
proportion near to zero for which the MSE is very small with either estimator.
While the MSEs of the new estimator fall rather close to the fitted parabola
(solid line), the MSEs of the current estimator are more erratic and the fitted
parabola (dashed line) is higher. The overall higher MSEs and erratic pattern
with the current estimator result from the discrepancies between actual
inclusion probabilities and those used in estimation.

squares regression estimator of the coefficient a is a simple ratio estimator.
Consider that the variable y = MSE linearly increases with the variable
x = p(1 − p) and that the variance of y about this line increases with x,
approximately linearly. From weighted regression results
P this
Psuggests, as an
estimator for the slope a, the ratio estimator hata =
yi / xi . So for an
overall comparison of the estimator y-bar with the new estimator, let aybar
and anew represent the estimated parameters of the respective lines. The ratio
aybar /anew is simply the sum of the MSEs with y-bar divided by the sum of
the MSEs with the new estimator, because the x-values are the same with
each design, so their sums divide out. Thus the ratio of the estimated
parabola parameters a is simply the ratio of the average MSE for the two
designs. It’s also the ratio of heights of the two parabolas at any point. This
ratio provides a measure of average relative efficiency of the the two designs.
For the regular snowball design, the overall relative efficiency of the new
estimator to the sample mean is aybar /anew = 0.02231997/0.002791733 = 8.0.
The relative efficiency of the new estimator to the VH estimator is 0.01079285
/ 0.002791733 = 3.9.
For the snowball design allowing re-recruitments, the overall relative
efficiency of the new estimator to the sample meean is
aybar /anew = 0.02244716/0.002445438 = 9.2. The relative efficiency of the new
estimator to the VH estimator is 0.01078216 / 0.002445438 = 4.4. To see these
relative parabola heights in Figures 5 and 6, note the position of zero on the
vertical axis.
Confidence interval coverage probabilities for each variable for each of the
15 variables are given in Tables 1 and 2. The median coverage probability of
the intervals for the 15 characteristics estimated with each of two designs is .94.

Discussion and conclusions

Snowball designs are the most natural of the network designs and have many
desirable properties. They self-allocate so that most of the sample size goes
into the most highly connected parts of the population. This leads
investigators to those areas where risk of spread of a virus is highest. This
makes snowball designs highly effective for distributing an intervention such as
a vaccine to a population.
Snowball designs have been used less than they should be because a simple
design-based estimator has not been available. The new method of this paper
provide such estimators.
Snowball designs and accurate estimators to go with them are needed for
preventing new pandemics from the coronaviruses family of viruses. They are
needed for understanding sexual networks on which HIV spreads and opioid
misuse networks which spread their own harms and occasionally provide
explosive terrain for HIV. The new estimators can also be used for adaptive
spatial designs for hard-to-sample animal species, by translating the spatial
structure into network form.
Accurate estimation with snowball designs requires estimating the
inclusion probabilities πi from the data taking the actual survey sampling
design into account. Sample means and proportions do not provide good
estimates or data summaries for snowball samples. Estimators that weight
observations by the reciprocal of the unit’s degree also do not work well with
snowball sampling designs.
The new estimates are fast to compute, scale up well, and are based on the
data and the design actually used rather than unrealistic assumptions. They
are low-bias, accurate, and give reliable confidence intervals.
