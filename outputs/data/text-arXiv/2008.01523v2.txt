Abstract

The global pandemic of COVID-19 has made
the public pay close attention to related news,
covering various domains, such as sanitation,
treatment, and effects on education. Meanwhile, the COVID-19 condition is very different among the countries (e.g., policies and
development of the epidemic), and thus citizens would be interested in news in foreign
countries. We build a system for worldwide COVID-19 information aggregation 1
containing reliable articles from 10 regions in
7 languages sorted by topics. Our reliable
COVID-19 related website dataset collected
through crowdsourcing ensures the quality of
the articles. A neural machine translation
module translates articles in other languages
into Japanese and English. A BERT-based
topic-classifier trained on our article-topic pair
dataset helps users find their interested information efficiently by putting articles into different categories.

Introduction

Due to the global COVID-19 epidemic and the
rapid changes in the epidemic, citizens are highly
interested in learning about the latest news, which
covers various domains, including directly related
news such as treatment and sanitation policies and
also side effects on education, economy, and so
on. Meanwhile, citizens would pay extra attention to global related news now, not only because
the planet has been brought together by the pandemic, but also because they can learn from the
news of other countries to obtain first-hand news.
For example, the epidemic outbreak in Korea is
one month earlier than in Japan. Japanese citizens

could prepare better for the epidemic if they had
obtained more information from Korea. Citizens
could learn from Asian countries about the effectiveness of masks before local official guidance.
Universities can learn about how to arrange virtual courses from the experience of other countries.
Thus, a citizen-friendly international news system
with topic detection would be helpful.
There are three challenges for building such a
system compared with systems focusing on one language and one topic (Dong et al., 2020; Thorlund
et al., 2020):
• The reliability of news sources.
• Translation quality to the local language.
• Topic classification for efficient searching.
The interface and the construction process of
the worldwide COVID-19 information aggregation
system are shown in Figure 1. We first construct
a robust multilingual reliable website collection
solver via crowdsourcing with native workers for
collecting reliable websites. We crawl news articles base on them and filter out the irrelevant. A
high-quality machine translation system is then
exploited to translate the articles into the local language (i.e., Japanese and English). The translated
news are grouped into their corresponding topics
by a BERT-based topic classifier. Our classifier
achieves 0.84 F-score when classifying whether an
article is about COVID-19 and substantially outperforms a keyword-based model by a large margin.
In the end, all the translated and topic labeled news
is demonstrated via a user-friendly web interface.

2.1

Reliable Website Collection

To avoid rumors and obtain high-quality, reliable
information, it is essential to limit the information
sources. Since we aim to create a multilingual system, the first challenge is to obtain a list of reliable
information providers from different countries and
in different languages.
Crowdsourcing is known to be efficient in creating high-quality datasets (Behnke et al., 2018).
To collect the list of reliable websites of a specific
country, we use multiple crowdsourcing services
(e.g., Crowd4U2 , Amazon Mechanical Turk 3 , Yahoo! Crowdsourcing4 , Tencent wenjuan5 ) and limit
the workers’ nationality because we assume that
local citizens of each country know the reliable
websites in their country. The workers not only
suggest websites they think are reliable but they
must also justify their choices and give a list of
related topics they address, similar to constructing
support for rumor detection (Gorrell et al., 2019;
Derczynski et al., 2017).

We decided to use eight countries of interest, including India, the United States, Italy, Japan, Spain,
France, Germany, and Brazil. For other countries
or regions such as China and Korea, reliable websites are provided by international students from
these areas.

We treat official news from the governments as
primary information sources and reliable newspapers as secondary information sources. We counted
how many times each website was mentioned by
the crowdworkers and found that the primary information sources tend to be ranked at the top three
in each country. So we mainly crawl articles from
primary sources.

Table 1 shows examples of the crowdsourcing
results. The workers provide websites indicating
for each one whether it is a primary or a secondary
source, what are the reasons to choose this particular website, and which topics are addressed by the
website. These topics are selected from a list that
includes eight topics (e.g., Infection status, Economics and welfare, School and online classes).

2.2

Please check the URL of the page first:

Crawl, Filter and Translation for
Information Localization

We crawl articles from 35 most reliable websites
everyday by accessing the entry page and jumping
to urls inside it recursively.
The number of crawled web pages is too big and
exceeds the translation capacity. We consider only
the most relevant pages by filtering using keywords
such as COVID. We can focus on pages with a
higher probability to be COVID-19 related.
We use neural machine translation model TexTra6 with self-attention mechanism (Bahdanau
et al., 2015; Vaswani et al., 2017). The translation system provides high-quality translation from
news articles in multiple languages into articles in
Japanese and English. The translation capacity is
approximately 3,000 articles per day.

Topic Classification

To perform topic classification, we first collect the
dataset via crowdsourcing. The topic labels are
annotated to a subset of articles. Then we train a
topic-classification model to label further articles
automatically.
2.3.1

Crowdsourcing Annotation for Topic
Classification
All articles are in Japanese and English after the
translation stage, we then apply crowdsourcing annotation to label the articles with topics. As shown
in Figure 2, the crowdsourcing workers first check
the content of the page and give four labels to the
article: whether it is related to COVID-19, whether
it is helpful, whether the translated text is fluent,
and topics of the article.
Each article is assigned to 10 crowdworkers from
Yahoo Crowdsourcing and we set a threshold to
50% for each binary question, i.e., if more than 5
workers think the article is related to COVID-19,
then we label the article as related. We post this
crowdsourcing task twice a week and can obtain
20K article-topic pairs each time.
2.3.2 Automatic Topic Classifier
The pretrained language model BERT (Devlin et al.,
2019) shows reliable performance on many NLP
tasks with limited annotated data including document classification (Adhikari et al., 2019; Sun
et al., 2019). We use a pretrained BERT model in
a feature based manner (Lee et al., 2019) where

3.1

Reliable Website Collection

As shown in Table 2, we totally recieved 908 questionnaire results from 8 countries with totally 550
websites. Rumors are rampant in this era, the reliable websites dataset can help people to protect
themselves from COVID-19 and avoid trusting rumors about COVID-19.

Table 6: Inter-annotator agreement measured by Krippendorff’s alpha of each topic.

Topic Classification

We compared the BERT-based model with the
keyword-based baseline model on topic classification task.
For the keyword-based method, there are totally
76 selected keywords of different topics such as
COVID, Remote work, and Social distance.
For the BERT-based method, we use the pretrained BERT-LARGE model with Whole Word
Masking (WWM). We add one linear layer after

the BERT encoder without fine-tuning the encoder.
For every article, we take the hidden state of the
ending symbol of each sentence as the sentence
embedding and perform mean and max pooling of
all sentence embeddings. The input of the linear
layer is the concatenation of mean and max pooling
embeddings and the output is a binary label.
The article-topic dataset is shown in Table 3,
it contains totally 57K articles from 8 countires

with topic label. We calculated the Krippendorff’s
alpha 7 as an inter-annotator agreement measure
for 57K human checked articles, as shown in Table 6, the inter-annotator agreement of all topics
is larger than 0.8 which is high enough (Krippendorff, 2004), showing the quality of our dataset is
guaranteed.
We randomly selected select 90% data as train
set and the remaining 10% as test set. As shown
in Table 4, the BERT-based model outperforms the
baseline model in almost all tasks. We can see that
our system can reliably classify which articles are
related to COVID-19 with 0.84 F1, and that our
interface can show related news to our users. The
topic classifiers achieve relatively satisfactory performance on the medical related topics (i.e. Infecction status, Prevention and Medical information).
The general high recall guarantees the most topic
relevant articles are returned. When presenting to
end users, the topic predictions are filtered by the
’Is about COVID-19’ classifier to ensure the eventual precision. Meanwhile, for some topics such as
Arts & Sports and Education, the performance of
the current system is still limited.
We further analyze the balance of the dataset
by calculating the positive and negative number of
each topic. As shown in Table 5, labels of several
topics are imbalanced, for example, Education, Art
and Sport, Economic. Analyzed together with the
BERT topic classifier results, we found that the performance is poor for such imbalanced topics. For
more frequent and balanced topics such as Infection status and Medical information, the F-scores
are relatively higher.
3.3

Machine Translation Evaluation

For the evaluation of the translated text, we conducted human evaluation through crowdsourcing.
As shown in Table 7, 61.7% of the articles are fluent
in the translated language and the inter-annotator
agreement is high enough (>0.8).

Conclusion

We built a system for worldwide COVID-19 information aggregation by combining crowdsourcing,
crawling, machine translation, and a topic classifier, which provides reliable, comprehensive and
latest information from the world. In the meanwile, we proposed an effective approach to annotate large cross-lingual news topic datasets with
high inner-annotation agreement, which potentially
benefits the NLP community to enrich the solutions
for preventing COVID-19. The contextual BERT
based classification models achieve reasonable performance considering the imbalance of the topic
labels. We assume this work could attract future
research interests to the COVID-19 related tasks.
