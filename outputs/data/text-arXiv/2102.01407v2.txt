Abstract
This paper introduces new methods to study the changing dynamics of COVID19 cases and deaths among the 50 worst-affected countries throughout 2020.
First, we analyse the trajectories and turning points of rolling mortality rates
to understand at which times the disease was most lethal. We demonstrate
five characteristic classes of mortality rate trajectories and determine structural
similarity in mortality trends over time. Next, we introduce a class of virulence
matrices to study the evolution of COVID-19 cases and deaths on a global scale.
Finally, we introduce three-way inconsistency analysis to determine anomalous
countries with respect to three attributes: countries’ COVID-19 cases, deaths
and human development indices. We demonstrate the most anomalous countries
across these three measures are Pakistan, the United States and the United Arab
Emirates.

1. Introduction
2020 will be remembered as the year that the world first battled the COVID19 pandemic. Almost 2 million people lost their lives, substantial restrictions
on population movement and activities were imposed, and almost every country
experienced an economic recession. During that year, treatments improved
substantially [1, 2, 3, 4] and several vaccines were produced by the end of the
year [5, 6]. However, the disease remains highly prevalent around the world as
of the start of 2021, and measures to contain and reduce its transmission remain
highly relevant for the reduction of casualties as well as economic and other
social consequences [7, 8].
Throughout the year, government responses to the pandemic varied substantially, both over time and between countries. Early government responses
included banning travel [9], the implementation of testing and contact tracing

programs [10], and lockdowns. Due to the economic consequences of lockdowns,
many countries implemented them too late [11, 12] and lifted restrictions before
cases had sufficiently reduced [13]. Such disparate responses to the virus led
to great variability in case and death counts, creating different waves of the
outbreak across many countries. Such later waves often exhibited higher case
and death counts than the first [14, 15].
The response of the scientific community to COVID-19 has also been varied
and multifaceted, producing research from many perspectives and disciplines. In
addition to the aforementioned medical research [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], mathematical
approaches to model and analyse the virus and its impact have been broad.
First, models based on existing statistical techniques, such as the Susceptible–Infected–Recovered (SIR) model and the basic reproductive ratio R0 , have
been proposed and systematically collated by researchers [16, 17]. These have
been used for various purposes, including diagnosis and prognosis of COVID-19
patients, efficacy of medications, and vaccine development. Next, nonlinear
dynamics researchers have proposed several sophisticated extensions to the
classical predictive SIR model, including analytic techniques to find explicit
solutions [18, 19], modifications to the SIR model with additional variables
[20, 21, 22, 23, 24], incorporation of Hamiltonian dynamics [25] or network
models [26] and a closer analysis of uncertainty in the SIR approach [27]. Other
mathematical approaches to prediction and analysis include power-law models
[28, 29, 30], distance analysis [31, 32], network models [33, 34, 35, 36], analyses
of the dynamics of transmission and contact [37, 38], forecasting models [39],
Bayesian methods [40], clustering [41, 42] and many others [43, 44, 45, 46].
We have a different motivation and approach relative to the aforementioned
work. Rather than performing predictions on an individual country basis or
comparing parameters among different countries (such as R0 or power-law
exponents), we seek to reveal structural similarity in COVID-19 case, death
and mortality time series across many countries of the world. Rather than
predicting the future, which is always challenging due to unpredictable changes
in government policy, we aim to be descriptive, revealing similarity and anomalous
countries in outcomes. Indeed, close analysis of the case, death and mortality
dynamics on a country-by-country basis is necessary to inform governments of
the most successful strategies for reducing transmission of cases and progression
to deaths. Identifying structural similarities between countries’ trajectories can
support conclusions that certain government responses will likely result in better
or worse outcomes. Moreover, identifying anomalous countries can provide
insights on which responses to the pandemic were exceptionally good or poor.
For this purpose, we present three sections, each of which contributes a new
mathematical method for analysing the world’s COVID-19 cases, deaths and
mortality, or any multivariate time series more generally.
This paper is therefore structured as follows. In Section 2, we analyse the
trajectories of mortality rates on a country-by-country basis. In particular,
we build upon a recently introduced algorithmic framework to identify the
turning points of the mortality trajectories, which reveal when the disease was
most and least lethal (with respect to the progression from cases to deaths).
2

We then use a new semi-metric between finite sets to assign countries into
classes of mortality trajectories. We believe this is the first work to classify
different mortality trajectories among countries, rather than a more traditional
comparison of overall mortality rates without considering its changing dynamics
over time. In Section 3, we analyse the eigenspectra of virulence matrices as a
new means of understanding trends in the worldwide prevalence and mortality
of COVID-19. This reveals periods in which COVID-19 was most severe and
most heterogeneous between countries. In Section 4, we compare countries’ case
and death counts with their human development index (HDI) and use a new
method to identify the most anomalous countries between these attributes. In
Section 5, we discuss our findings from the aforementioned analyses regarding
COVID-19 trends throughout the year 2020. We conclude in Section 6.
2. Mortality rate analysis
In this section, we study the dynamics of the COVID-19 mortality rate
among n = 50 countries. Our data spans 01/01/2020 to 31/12/2020, a period of
T = 366 days. We choose the countries with the 50 greatest total case counts
of COVID-19 as of 31/12/2020, order these by alphabetical order, and index
them i = 1, ..., n. Let xi (t), yi (t) ∈ R be the multivariate time series of new daily
cases and deaths, respectively, for i = 1, ..., n and t = 1, ..., T . Throughout this
paper, the subscript i pertains to the ith country, ordered alphabetically, while
evaluating a function at t gives its value at the tth day of the year. For a given
country, let ri (t) be its 30-day rolling mortality rate, defined by
Pt

ri (t) = Pts=t−29
s=t−29

yi (s)
xi (s)

, t = 30, ..., T,

(1)

or zero if no cases have been observed over the last 30 days. This gives a
multivariate time series ri (t), for i = 1, ..., n and t = 30, ..., T . The data point at
time t describes the rolling mortality rate over the prior 30 days.
2.1. Methodology
The aim of this section is to study these mortality trends on a country-bycountry basis and identify structural similarity across different countries. For this
purpose, we use two (semi)-metrics between the mortality rate time series and
apply hierarchical clustering [47, 48] to these measures. Hierarchical clustering
has been used in several epidemiological applications, including inflammatory
diseases [49], airborne diseases [50], Alzheimer’s disease [51], Ebola [52], SARS
[53], and COVID-19 [41].
These mortality rates ri (t) exhibit highly undulating behaviour, moving
between clear peaks and troughs (turning points). Our first semi-metric measures
distance between algorithmically-identified turning points as a proxy for each
time series’ behaviour. We modify an existing algorithmic framework for this
purpose. First, we apply a Savitzky-Golay filter to produce a collection of

3

smoothed time series r̂i (t), t = 30, ..., T and i = 1, ..., n. A beneficial effect of
this smoothing is to ameliorate some of the noise present in the COVID-19 case
count data. In addition to the smoothing procedure, our computation includes
a rolling mortality rate that further reduces the effect of perturbations in the
data’s underlying signal. We choose a 30-day rolling mortality rate for two
reasons: first, this window length provides a compromise between denoising
the data and not over-smoothing; second, 30 days provides a good luck at the
mortality rate behaviour of the last month of data. Next, we follow [15] and
apply a two-step algorithm where we select and then refine a set of turning
points. We assign each smoothed mortality rate time series a non-empty set Pi
and Ti of local maxima (peaks) and local minima (troughs). To better suit our
specific application, we modify the second step of this algorithm, in which the
turning point list is refined. Full details are included in Appendix A, including
a discussion of the procedure’s robustness against noisy data. We display 12
countries’ mortality rate time series and annotate their turning points in Figure
1.
To quantify distance between time series’ turning points, we modify the semimetric of [32] (with p = 1). Given two non-empty finite sets S1 , S2 ⊂ {1, 2, ..., T },
this is defined as
P
P

1
b∈S2 d(b, S1 )
a∈S1 d(a, S2 )
D(S1 , S2 ) =
+
,
(2)
2T
#S2
#S1
where d(b, S1 ) is the minimal distance from b ∈ S2 to the set S1 , and #S1 is the
cardinality of S1 , and analogously for S2 . By the choice of normalisation, this
is always bounded between 0 and 1. To more appropriately separate different
behaviours among mortality trends, we modify this semi-metric by including a
regularisation term. This treatment is inspired by various regularisation penalties
in the statistical literature [54]. We construct our semi-metric as follows:
D0 (S1 , S2 ) = D(S1 , S2 ) + β|#S1 − #S2 |,

(3)

where 0 < β ≤ 1 is a constant. The resulting values D0 (S1 , S2 ) are symmetric,
non-negative, and zero if and only if S1 = S2 . Then, we define the n × n matrix
DT P between turning point sets by
TP
Dij
= D0 (Pi , Pj ) + D0 (Ti , Tj ).

(4)

Here, Pi denotes the set of peaks for the ith country’s mortality series, while the
subscript ij gives a distance between countries i and j, ordered alphabetically.
In Figure 2, we perform hierarchical clustering on DT P with a range of values
of β. These distances do not capture the absolute values of the mortality rate
time series; they only distinguish between their undulating behaviour, reflected
in their sets of turning points. To round out our analysis, we include another
metric, an L1 norm that does account for difference in the absolute values of

4

mortality. We define another matrix by

Dij
=

|ri (t) − rj (t)|,

t=30

and perform hierarchical clustering on D1 in Figure 3. Again, the subscript ij
refers to a distance computed between countries i and j, ordered alphabetically.
2.2. Results
In Figure 1, we display rolling mortality rate and turning points for 12
countries: Brazil, India, Mexico, the United States (US), the Netherlands,
Sweden, France, Germany, Italy, Russia, Ecuador and Bulgaria. These countries
display highly heterogeneous behaviours, which are suitably captured in Figure
2. Figure 2a reveals four clusters of similarity, and one outlier. Russia (1j) is
the unique country with just two detected turning points. Several developing
countries such as Brazil (1a), India (1b) and Mexico (1c) as well as developed
countries including the US (1d), the Netherlands (1e) and Sweden (1f) have
three turning points. France (1g), Germany (1h) and Italy (1i) have four turning
points. Ecuador (1k) and others have five, while Bulgaria (1l) and others have
six. Figure 2b gives a near-identical result, where the clusters pertaining to
five and six turning points merge. However, examining the dendrogram closely,
both are clearly visible as subclusters, and we are comfortable identifying five
categories of trajectories. To demonstrate the robustness of our method, we
record the cluster structure for a greater range of β in Table 1.
Within the 4-turning point cluster, we see a dense subcluster of similarity containing Austria, Belgium, Canada, Czechia, France, Georgia, Germany, Hungary,
Italy, Poland, Portugal, Switzerland and the United Kingdom (UK). All these
countries experienced a peak in the mortality rate in April or May (corresponding
to the previous 30 days) and a local minimum near the beginning of September
(corresponding to the previous 30 days during August). This similarity can be
seen by examining members of this cluster, France (1g), Germany (1h) and Italy
(1i).
Turning to Figure 3, several other insights concerning the mortality rate
trajectories emerge. First, Mexico and Ecuador are identified as outliers in the
collection of countries, with only slight similarity to each other. For Mexico (1c),
this is due to a consistently high mortality rate over time, over 10% for most
of the period. Ecuador (1k) is an outlier due to peaks in mortality over 30%,
higher than any other country. Belgium, France, Hungary, Spain, and the UK
form their own smaller cluster characterised by high mortality rates (of around
20%) in their first wave of COVID-19. Indeed, these countries experienced higher
mortality in March-April than anywhere else in the world.
3. Virulence matrix analysis
In this section, we develop a new framework of time-varying analysis of
30-day rolling virulence matrices, inspired by, but differing from, covariance

classes are observed: Russia has two turning points; Brazil, India and the US have three;
most European countries have four, with a strong subcluster of similarity observed including
Austria, Belgium, and others. Two smaller classes are observed containing five and six turning
points, respectively. The cluster structure in the two dendrograms is near identical, with a
consolidation of the five- and six-turning point classes in (b). There, these classes are clearly
observed as subclusters.

matrices in finance [55]. Let t = 30, ..., T be a particular time. We form vectors
xi (t) = (xi (t − 29), ..., xi (t)), analogously for yi (t). These two vectors record the
case and death counts over the past 30 days, with the subscript i referring to the
ith country, ordered alphabetically. We may also form ri (t) = (ri (t−29), ..., ri (t))
for t = 59, ..., T , as the time series ri (t) only begin at t = 30. Define (unscaled)
inner products by
t
X

hxi (t), xj (t)i =

xi (s)xj (s).

(6)

s=t−29

We then define n × n (unscaled) virulence matrices with respect to cases, deaths
and mortality rates by the following (i, j = 1, ...n):
Vijc (t) = hxi (t), xj (t)i, t = 30, ..., T ;

Vijd (t)
Vijr (t)

= hyi (t), yj (t)i, t = 30, ..., T ;

(8)

= hri (t), rj (t)i, t = 59, ..., T.

(9)

The subscript ij refers to an inner product between the ith and jth countries,
while the superscripts c, d, r refer to case, death and mortality rate time series,
respectively. Due to the summation procedure used to form these inner products,
these virulence matrices implicitly average over 30 days’ worth of case counts
and can are thus robust against the noise present in day-to-day data. We
could also analogously define normalised virulence matrices by using normalised
inner products in place of the unscaled inner products above. These matrices
are thus named because they provide a representation of the global spread of
COVID-19 over the last 30 days and contain relationships between different
countries’ trajectories. The use of a standard covariance matrix here would
not appropriately measure this prevalence: a country with a constant (but
severe) number of cases for the past 30 days would yield a zero covariance
with any other country. Each matrix V (t) is a n × n symmetric real matrix,
and thus is diagonalisable with all real eigenvalues. By the positivity of the
inner product, each matrix satisfies a non-negativity condition uT V u ≥ 0 for

and Ecuador emerge as outliers, characterised by a consistently high mortality rate over the
full period and the highest peaks in mortality of all, respectively. Belgium, France, Hungary,
Spain and the UK are revealed as a secondary cluster, characterised by high mortality in April
and May, rapidly decreasing from then.

u ∈ Rn , and so all eigenvalues are non-negative. We list and order the eigenvalues
λ1 ≥ λ2 ≥ ... ≥ λn ≥ 0. This produces a time-varying eigenspectrum, which
we display in Figure 4 for the first ten eigenvalues. Moreover, for any such
symmetric matrix, the greatest eigenvalue λ1 holds particular significance. By
the spectral theorem, λ1 coincides with the operator norm of the matrix [56], a
measure of its total size. That is,
λ1 = ||V ||op =

||V u||
.

u∈R

(10)

Subsequent eigenvalues also have a real-world interpretation. λ2 = 0 if and
only if the matrix V is rank 1, which occurs if and only if all trajectories xi
(in the instance of the cases matrix) differ by a multiplicative constant. In
general, a small value of λ2 relative to λ1 indicates substantial homogeneity in
the trajectories.
In Figures 4a, 4b and 4c, respectively, we display the time-varying eigenspectra
for the virulence matrices associated to cases, deaths and mortality rates. There
are several interesting properties of these time-varying eigenspectra. The first
eigenvalue λ1 of Figure 4a demonstrates the general increase of new COVID-19
cases over the course of 2020. The sharp spike towards the end of the year
demonstrates the rapid growth in cases in the final months of 2020. Figure 4b
has two prominent peaks in its first eigenvalue, corresponding to the periods of

9

March-April and November-December. These peaks highlight the natural history
of COVID-19, where many countries suffered significant deaths during their
first wave of the virus, enforced harsh restrictions resulting in fewer cases and
deaths, and subsequently experienced further growth in cases and deaths upon
such restrictions’ easing. Finally, the first eigenvalue in Figure 4c highlights an
interesting trend in the mortality rate. There is a marked spike in March-April,
followed by a significant reduction throughout the remainder of 2020. This shape
in the first eigenvalue likely represents vulnerable people dying earlier and/or
under-reporting of cases early in the year, contributing to a higher calculated
mortality rate from reported cases and deaths.
The relationship between the first eigenvalue and subsequent eigenvalues
is also of interest. Figure 4a shows the second eigenvalue λ2 becoming quite
significant for cases towards the end of 2020, when the total number of cases is
larger than ever. This shows that the behaviour of new cases in late 2020 is more
heterogeneous than the first wave, when all cases were rising quite uniformly
throughout the world. Figures 4b and 4c show a more moderate, but similar
phenomenon concerning deaths and mortality rate at various stages of the year.
The second eigenvalue in Figure 4b is slightly more pronounced in the second
wave of the virus, displaying more heterogeneity in COVID-19 deaths later in
the year. The second eigenvalue in Figure 4c is more pronounced during the
first wave of the virus - highlighting more heterogeneity during the first wave
of the virus with respect to mortality. Indeed, Figure 1 shows that European
countries experienced substantial mortality in their first wave of COVID-19,
which characterised them as anomalous in Figure 3. This contributed to a
meaningful heterogeneity of mortality rates across the world during the early
stages of the year.
4. Inconsistency analysis
In this section, we describe how we measure the consistency between three
attributes, and reveal anomalous countries in the process. To do so, we introduce
a new method of comparing three distance matrices and apply this to distances
between case and death time series, and human development indices (HDI). This
generalises prior work studying anomalies between two attributes [57].
4.1. Methodology
Let hi be the HDI of each country. Calculated by the United Nations
Development Programme [58], this index combines a country’s life expectancy,
educational standards and economic standard of living. Bounded between 0 and
1, the HDI hi reflects a substantially lower living standard the further h moves
from 1. To reflect this, we use a logarithmic distance between these indices that
penalises movement away from 1 more than a linear distance:
h
Dij
= | log hi − log hj |, i, j = 1, ..., n.

the total size of the matrices, and shows (a) a large increase of cases towards the end of 2020,
(b) two or three waves of significant deaths, (c) the highest mortality early on in the year. The
second eigenvalue reveals more heterogeneity in case trajectories towards the end of the year,
and mortality towards the beginning of the year.

11

As before, the subscript i refers to the ith country, ordered alphabetically, the
subscript ij refers to a distance between the ith and jth country, while the
superscript h signals a distance relative to HDI. This forms a n × n distance
matrix between countries’ development indices. Given the exponential nature
of the spread of the virus, we also use a logarithmic distance between the case
and death time series. Some of these time series have negative counts due to
retrospective adjustments in the data. In order to ensure non-negative counts,
we first apply a Savitzky-Golay filter to produce smoothed case and death time
series x̂i (t) and ŷi (t) respectively. Due to its moving average and polynomial
smoothing, this eliminates almost all negatives, except when there are very few
counts. We replace any non-positive count with a 1. Then, we may calculate a
logarithmic L1 distance as follows:
c
Dij
= || log x̂i − log x̂j || =

T

| log x̂i (t) − log x̂j (t)|;

(12)

| log ŷi (t) − log ŷj (t)|.

(13)

t=1

Dij

= || log ŷi − log ŷj || =

T
X
t=1

Above, the superscripts c, d refer to distances relative to the case and death time
series, respectively, between countries i and j. Again, the summation across
many days of data has the effect of smoothing out over the noise inherent in
day-to-day variations of case counts. We use such a metric between case or death
time series rather than a simple difference between the total yearly counts to
distinguish between countries (and hence reveal potential anomalies) according
to when the cases or deaths occurred. Thus, we have defined three n × n distance
matrices between countries. Given a n × n distance matrix D, its corresponding
affinity matrix is defined as
Aij = 1 −

Dij
, i, j = 1, ..., n.
max {D}

(14)

All elements of these affinity matrices lie in [0, 1], so it is appropriate to compare
them directly by taking their difference. Given a n × n matrix C, let |C| be the
matrix given by taking the absolute value of all elements, that is |C|ij = |Cij |.
Then, define three n × n symmetric pairwise inconsistency matrices:
INCc,d = |Ac − Ad |;

and a total inconsistency matrix
INCc,d,h = INCc,d + INCc,h + INCd,h .

12

(18)

Above and below, a superscript c, d refers to inconsistency between cases and
deaths, while c, h refers to an inconsistency between cases and HDI, and similarly for d, h. A superscript c, d, h refers to an inconsistency between all three
attributes. Next, we can define pairwise anomaly scores by

In Tables 2 and 3, we record the anomaly vectors, total anomaly score and
weighted anomaly score for all 50 countries under consideration. In Figure 5, we
plot the total consistency matrix INCc,d,h , where anomalous countries can easily
be seen due to larger entries in their respective rows and columns. An analogous
weighted consistency matrix can also be defined, which is broadly similar to the
one shown.

Remark 4.1. In this brief aside, we explore the edge cases of maximal consistency
and maximal inconsistency, and interpret their meaning. Consider a single entry
c,d
c
d
c

INCc,d
ij = |Aij − Aij |. As both Aij , Aij ∈ [0, 1], the inconsistency entry INCij
has greatest possible value to 1. It attains that value when Acij = 1 and Adij = 0,
c
d
or vice versa. This equations can be reinterpreted as Dij
= 0 and Dij
= max Dd ,
respectively. That is, greatest inconsistency occurs when countries i and j
have equal case counts, but the greatest difference in death counts among any
pair of countries, or vice versa. The exact same statement applies for greatest
inconsistency between cases and HDI or deaths and HDI.
On the other hand, greatest possible consistency across the entire matrix
Dc

Dd

would mean Acij − Adij = 0, for all i, j. Rearranging this yields maxijDc = maxijDd ,
for all i, j. That is, the distance matrices Dc and Dd differ up to a single
scalar. One example where this can occur is if there are constants a and τ such
that yi (t) = axi (t + τ ), for all i = 1, ..., n, t = 1, ..., P
T . Then this relationship
passes

the

consistency would occur if every country has an identical progression of cases to

4.2. Results
The total inconsistency matrix and all computed anomaly scores yield several
insights. First, the three most anomalous countries with respect to the weighted
anomaly score are Pakistan, the US and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). A
near-identical result applies if we use the unscaled total anomaly score, with
Pakistan, the US, Nepal and then the UAE exhibiting the largest unscaled
scores. For the US and Pakistan, the highest contribution to the total or
weighted anomaly score comes from their high pairwise anomaly scores ac,h and
ad,h , which are the two highest of any country. Interestingly, these high scores
have differing explanations. The US is highly inconsistent between cases (and
analogously deaths) and HDI due to its much higher case and death counts
than other countries of similar HDI. Pakistan is classified as inconsistent due
to an extreme HDI, the lowest of any country under consideration, but a case
and death time series that are similar to many others. Thus, due to a lower
HDI than other countries with similar case and death counts, it is registered as
inconsistent. We remark that high anomaly scores do not necessarily indicate a
straightforward anomalous quotient between cases or HDI, for example. Instead,
a high anomaly score reflects inconsistency in relationships with other countries.
On the other hand, the UAE has a high weighted and total anomaly score
due to its value of ac,d , which is the highest of any country. Indeed, the
UAE experienced the lowest mortality rate across 2020 of any country under
consideration. The country with the second-highest value of ac,d is Mexico. This
is anomalous for the opposite reason: a consistently high progression from cases
to deaths, as first noted in Figure 1c.
5. Discussion
In this paper, we analyse the natural history of COVID-19 across 50 countries
over 2020. We observe significant structural similarity between certain countries
as well as heterogeneity across the world with respect to COVID-19 prevalence
and mortality, and identify anomalous countries therein. Such insights cannot be
gained with conventional techniques, such as a comparison of reproductive ratios
across countries. Our analysis consistently considers the changing dynamics with
time.
In Section 2, we analyse mortality rate trajectories for 50 countries. By
modifying a recently introduced turning point algorithm and introducing a
new semi-metric between turning point sets, we assign these time series into
five characteristic classes according to their differing trajectories. Russia is
identified as an outlier - its mortality rate rose consistently until July and never
dropped substantially enough to register a subsequent trough in our algorithmic
framework. It is unique in this sense among the 50 countries, possessing a
consistently stable mortality rate after its first peak. 19 countries exhibit three
turning points, including Brazil, India and the US, indicating a substantial
reduction in mortality from a first peak. 21 countries exhibit four turning
points, indicating a second wave in which mortality has increased once again.

Table 3: Anomaly vectors, total anomaly scores and weighted anomaly scores, as defined in
Section 4, for the remaining 13 countries under consideration. Pairwise anomaly scores quantify
the inconsistency in measurements between two quantities, while the total and weighted
anomaly scores incorporate all three attributes. The weighted anomaly score is chosen to more
appropriately weight the contributions from the three pairwise scores.

In particular, a strong subcluster contains most Western European countries:
Austria, Belgium, Czechia, France (1g), Germany (1h), Hungary, Italy (1i),
Portugal, Switzerland, and the UK. These all share highly similar mortality
trajectories, with a first peak in April-May, a trough around September, and
another peak at the end of the year.
There are three wealthy western European countries that do not fit into
this cluster. Both the Netherlands and Sweden, displayed in Figures 1e and 1f
respectively, do not register a second peak in mortality. Indeed, these countries
both kept their mortality low towards the end of the year, while France, Germany
and Italy experienced an increase. Prior research has noted that the Netherlands
reduced its mortality rate substantially in its second wave of COVID-19 [42],
while Sweden changed its COVID-19 response substantially relative to the first
half of the year [59]. Spain registers six turning points primarily due to highly
irregular reporting, featuring negative counts and large numbers of cases and
deaths consolidated and reported on single sporadic days.
A smaller number of countries exhibited more turning points: five with 5
turning points and four with 6. We observe that the majority of developed
countries exhibit 3 or 4 turning points, as visible in Figure 2, while the outlier
countries (with 2,5 or 6 turning points) were mostly developing countries. This
reflects more regular (and less undulating) behaviour in the mortality rate
trajectories and has two explanations. First, more developed countries may have
implemented more consistent testing, which could have caused less fluctuations
in the reported mortality rate. Secondly, more developed countries may have
more healthcare resources to improve their treatment of COVID-19 and thereby

17

reduce and stabilise the mortality rate over time.
As a whole, the most significant finding from Section 2 is the identification
of five categories of mortality trajectories, attained from both the turning point
algorithm and the use of clustering our new semi-metric between sets. This
reveals close similarity among mortality trajectories when considered as varying
functions over time, and carries more weight than an overall comparison of
mortality obtained by just dividing the number of deaths observed throughout
2020 by the number of cases. Our results are robust with respect to the variation
of parameters.
In Section 3, we introduce a new class of virulence matrices for cases, deaths
and mortality rates and analyse their eigenspectra. The first eigenvalue λ1
provides a measure of the total scale of the matrices and summarises worldwide
trends in prevalence and mortality throughout 2020. Figure 4a reflects a substantial surge in cases towards the end of the year, Figure 4b shows multiple
waves of deaths of comparable magnitude, while Figure 4c shows an early peak
that dominates the rest of the period. The second eigenvalue λ2 provides a
measure of the heterogeneity among the studied time series. Figure 4a exhibits
a considerable rise in heterogeneity towards the end of the year, during a time in
which new cases trajectories across different countries were substantial but quite
non-uniform. In Figure 4b, we see a much greater value of λ2 during the second
wave of deaths, in which λ1 is in fact lower than the first wave. The much milder
drop off between λ1 and λ2 indicates the greatest heterogeneity with respect to
deaths during this period in the middle of the year. Figure 4c similarly reveals
substantial heterogeneity in mortality rates during the earlier part of the year.
When viewed in conjunction, these three figures provide several insights
into the natural history of the disease throughout 2020. Case counts generally
increased in global severity throughout the year, while death counts constituted
a much clearer pattern of multiple waves. The mortality rate trajectory (4c) can
explain this - in March and April, the progression from reported cases to deaths
was much more severe throughout Europe, causing substantial deaths despite
fewer cases than late 2020. During the middle of the year, the heterogeneity
in death counts was at its highest. Indeed, the months of June to August
featured relatively few new cases in Europe [60], while Brazil [61], India and
other developing countries experienced substantial growth in cases [62]. Towards
the end of the year, the pandemic once again impacted the entire world, with
more counts observed than ever before. During this time, mortality was low,
but cases were so high that deaths became the highest they have ever been.
Heterogeneity in case trajectories also increased substantially, with COVID-19
trajectories differing substantially between different countries, many increasing,
some decreasing, but most with high total counts. One could more closely
examine heterogeneity by considering normalised virulence matrices obtained
from normalised inner products, as explained in Section 3.
This analysis provides a new means of identifying periods of maximal severity
and heterogeneity in case, death and mortality trajectories across the world. The
temporal dimension is critical in such analyses as both severity and heterogeneity
change over time. Specifically, cases are most severe and heterogeneous at
18

the end of the year; deaths are most severe in March/April and year-end, but
most heterogeneous in the middle of the year; mortality is most severe and
heterogeneous in March/April.
In Section 4, we study the consistency between cases, deaths and HDI for
all 50 countries under consideration. We believe that this is the first method
proposed to study (in)consistencies among a collection of time series for up
to three measures. We propose two measures of anomaly across these three
quantities: a total and weighted anomaly score (that more appropriately combines
the contributions of the three pairwise anomaly components). The three most
anomalous countries with respect to the weighted score are Pakistan, the US and
the UAE. Closer inspection of the pairwise anomaly components in Tables 2 and
3 can reveal which quantities most contribute to a country’s total or weighted
score. For the UAE, this is the high anomaly score between cases and deaths,
caused by the lowest progression from cases to deaths among our collection of
countries. For the US, both anomaly scores ac,h and ad,h contribute highly;
these reflect the fact that the US has considerably more cases and deaths than
other countries of similar HDI. For Pakistan, the same two anomaly scores ac,h
and ad,h are the largest of any country, but for the opposite reason: its HDI is
substantially lower than any country with a similar case and death time series.
The full collection of anomaly scores can also reveal broad trends regarding
consistency between the three measures. In Tables 2 and 3, we see that the
two pairwise anomaly scores relative to HDI are systematically greater than the
pairwise score between case and death counts. Indeed, we have ac,d
< ad,h
for
i
i
c,d
c,h
every single country and ai < ai for every country except Mexico (which has
the second-highest case-death anomaly score after the UAE due to its consistently
and anomalously high mortality). These patterns reveal systematically more
consistency between case and death counts than between case or death counts
and HDI. Qualitatively, this reveals there is little relationship between a country’s
HDI and its case or death counts. In addition, a closer examination reveals that
ac,h
< ad,h
for 34 out of the 50 countries, 2/3 of the collection. Thus, to a lesser
i
i
extent, there is greater consistency between case counts and HDI than there is
between death counts and HDI. This is a surprising finding - one would naively
expect more consistency between a lower HDI and higher deaths due to poorer
healthcare quality resulting in a greater progression of cases to deaths, regardless
of the number of cases.
The originality of Section 4 is two-fold: first, a new mathematical method
for identifying inconsistencies across three attributes; and second, as the first
analysis of cases, deaths and HDI of different countries simultaneously, again
taking temporal dynamics into account. The main findings are the identification
of specific anomalous countries, including Mexico and the UAE between cases
and deaths, and the US and Pakistan between cases (or deaths) and HDI.
Several limitations and opportunities for future research exist in this inconsistency framework. First, the results could also be repeated for case and
death time series as a proportion of each country’s population. Alternative
metrics between cases and deaths could be used, such as a simple difference

19

between the total yearly counts, without the temporal component provided by
the L1 metric. A closer analysis of the relationship between the varying sizes of
the anomaly scores could quantitatively characterise the differing consistency
between three quantities as a whole. One limitation in this analysis framework
is that anomalies are measured purely by their relative deviation from the rest of
the collection, and direction (positive or negative) is ignored. A closer inspection
is necessary to determine the nature of the anomaly. However, this could be
seen as a benefit of the methodology as well, as it is flexible in the detection of
different sorts of inconsistent behaviour. Further research could also incorporate
several different attributes other than HDI, such as countries’ age demographics,
size, and population density.
More broadly speaking, any analysis of reported cases and deaths due to
COVID-19 will have limitations. First, the reported counts of COVID-19 may
have been under-reported [63] throughout the pandemic. Not only did early
cases spread throughout Europe and the US before testing programs had been
established, but testing protocols were far from uniform across the year and
between countries. Indeed, several countries changed their testing protocols on
various occasions, including within the same wave [64, 65, 66]. Even deaths
may have been under-reported, with substantial differences observed between
excess mortality and reported COVID-19 deaths [67]. Nonetheless, our analysis
of reported case and death counts may reveal structural similarity and anomalies,
help governments in their decision-making, and motivate further research that
examines other data attributes in more involved studies.
6. Conclusion
Overall, this paper introduces new methods for analysing COVID-19 prevalence and mortality on a country-by-country and worldwide basis and chronicles
the natural history of COVID-19 during 2020. On a global scale, we reveal
broad trends in case and death counts as well as mortality trajectories, which
present a coherent picture of the changing impacts of COVID-19 over time.
On a country-by-country basis, we reveal both heterogeneity and structural
similarity with respect to mortality over time and study consistency between
COVID-19 prevalence and human development, revealing specific anomalous
countries. Moreover, the framework presented in this paper could be applied
broadly to various epidemiological or economic crises. The consistent theme in
our analysis, and motivation for it, is to always seek structure and associated
anomalies in case, death and mortality time series, with an essential consideration
of changing dynamics with time.
The primary strength of this analysis is that our findings are difficult to
detect with existing methods. For example, the use of SIR models and their
extensions, together with an analysis of the reproductive ratio R0 , may be fit
independently for each country and create predictions, but they are not suitable
to detecting structure in all the world’s case, death and mortality trajectories
at once. Such methods would not reveal the five classes of trajectories we find,
nor would they identify the periods of the greatest heterogeneity in prevalence
20

or mortality, nor identify anomalous countries with respect to our chosen data
attributes. Measurements such as R0 are more useful for early analysis of the
transmissibility of the virus; we aim to find structure while comparing the plights
of different countries over time.
As 2021 begins, the world remains severely affected by COVID-19. Though
vaccination distribution is underway in many countries, the analysis of trends
in cases, deaths and mortality remains of substantial relevance to governments.
The identification of structural similarity in mortality rate trajectories between
European states may inspire additional cooperation [7] and coordination of their
strategic response to the pandemic. Our methods highlight countries that have
responded particularly well or poorly, and our analysis highlights points in time
where cases, deaths and mortality rates changed substantially for candidate
countries. Finally, we reveal global changes in the relationship between cases,
deaths and mortality rates over time. Such changes should inform governments
regarding their response to the pandemic. This will be particularly crucial in
the coming months, as various vaccines are administered over the world.

Appendix A. Turning point methodology
In this section, we provide more details for the identification of turning points
of a mortality rate time series r(t). First, some smoothing is necessary due to
irregularities in the data set, and discrepancies between different data sources.
The Savitzky-Golay filter ameliorates these issues by combining polynomial
smoothing with a moving average computation, and yields a smoothed time
series r̂(t) ∈ R≥0 . Subsequently, we perform a two-step process to select and
then refine a non-empty set P of local maxima (peaks) and T of local minima
(troughs).
Following [15], we apply a two-step algorithm to the smoothed time series
r̂(t). The first step produces an alternating sequence of troughs and peaks. The
second step refines this sequence according to chosen conditions and parameters.

21

The most important conditions to identify a peak or trough, respectively, in the
first step, are the following:
r̂(t0 ) = max{r̂(t) : max(1, t0 − l) ≤ t ≤ min(t0 + l, T )},

(A.1)

r̂(t0 ) = min{r̂(t) : max(1, t0 − l) ≤ t ≤ min(t0 + l, T )},

(A.2)

where l is a parameter to be chosen. Due to the smoothing of the Savitzky-Golay
filter, noise in day-to-day counts will change the local maxima and minima of the
smoothed time series minimally, and will not affect either the number of total
turning points nor the distances between different turning point sets. Following
[15], we select l = 17, which accounts for the 14-day incubation period of the
virus [69] and less testing on weekends. Defining peaks and troughs according to
this definition alone has several flaws, such as the potential for two consecutive
peaks.
Instead, we implement an inductive procedure to choose an alternating
sequence of peaks and troughs. Suppose t0 is the last determined peak. We
search in the period t > t0 for the first of two cases: if we find a time t1 > t0
that satisfies (A.2) as well as a non-triviality condition r̂(t1 ) < r̂(t0 ), we add
t1 to the set of troughs and proceed from there. If we find a time t1 > t0 that
satisfies (A.1) and r̂(t0 ) ≥ r̂(t1 ), we ignore this lower peak as redundant; if we
find a time t1 > t0 that satisfies (A.1) and r̂(t1 ) > r̂(t0 ), we remove the peak t0 ,
replace it with t1 and continue from t1 . A similar process applies from a trough
at t0 .
At this point, the time series is assigned an alternating sequence of troughs
and peaks. However, some turning points are immaterial and should be excluded.
The second step is a flexible approach introduced in [15] for this purpose. In
this paper, we introduce new conditions within this framework. First, we use
the same peak ratio procedure: let t1 < t3 be two peaks, necessarily separated
by a trough. We select a parameter δ = 0.2, and if the peak ratio, defined as
r̂(t3 )
r̂(t1 ) < δ, we remove the peak t3 . If two consecutive troughs t2 , t4 remain, we
remove t2 if r̂(t2 ) > r̂(t4 ), otherwise remove t4 . That is, if the second peak has
size less than δ of the first peak, we remove it.
Finally, let t1 , t2 be adjacent turning points (one a trough, one a peak). We
choose a parameter  = log(2); if
| log r̂(t2 ) − log r̂(t1 )| < ,

(A.3)

that is, the values of the turning point differ by less than a factor of 2, we
remove t2 from our sets of peaks and troughs. If t2 is not the final turning point,
we also remove t1 . This is a different condition from previous work - whereas
[15] considers the average change with time between turning points of new case
trajectories, we consider only the absolute change between turning points in
mortality rate. Indeed, there is no need to consider how much time has passed
when determining whether mortality has increased or decreased by a sufficient
amount, in our implementation a factor of 2, to warrant a turning point being
included.
