A model for the spread of an epidemic from local
to global: A case study of COVID-19 in India
Buddhananda Banerjee∗, Pradumn Kumar Pandey†, and Bibhas Adhikari‡
Abstract. In this paper we propose an epidemiological model for the spread of COVID-19.
The dynamics of the spread is based on four fundamental categories of people in a population:
Tested and infected, Non-Tested but infected, Tested but not infected, and non-Tested and
not infected. The model is based on two levels of dynamics of spread in the population: at
local level and at the global level. The local level growth is described with data and parameters which include testing statistics for COVID-19, preventive measures such as nationwide
lockdown, and the migration of people across neighboring locations. In the context of India,
the local locations are considered as districts and migration or traffic flow across districts
are defined by normalized edge weight of the metapopulation network of districts which are
infected with COVID-19. Based on this local growth, state level predictions for number of
people tested with COVID-19 positive are made. Further, considering the local locations
as states, prediction is made for the country level. The values of the model parameters are
determined using grid search and minimizing an error function while training the model with
real data. The predictions are made based on the present statistics of testing, and certain
linear and log-linear growth of testing at state and country level. Finally, it is shown that
the spread can be contained if number of testing can be increased linearly or log-linearly by
certain factors along with the preventive measures in near future. This is also necessary to
prevent the sharp growth in the count of infected and to get rid of the second wave of pandemic.

Introduction

COVID-19 is a pandemic that is actively spreading in the whole world and is an unprecedented
challenge for the human race. All the countries infected with COVID-19 are struggling to
mitigate the spread through various strategies. This disease is spread by inhalation or contact
with infected droplets or fomites. It is observed that successful medical testing and as a result,
detection of people infected with SARs-Cov-2 becomes one of the crucial control strategies
for the spread of COVID-19 [1]. For instance, the epidemic curve in The Republic of South
Korea suggests that this control strategy in South Korea has curtailed the epidemic. Besides,
testing is also linked to tracing contact lists of the infected people and finally self-isolation
of those people help against the spread. The success of containment of COVID-19 in the
Republic of Taiwan has also the influence of proactive testing [2].
Given the fact that there in no effective antiviral vaccine or drug should coming soon,
different prevention strategies are adapted by different countries that include voluntary or
compulsory quarantine, stopping of mass gatherings, closure of educational institutions or
workplaces, social distancing or even nationwide lockdown. However, these strategies may

act less significant for the infected people who are at the pre-symptomatic stage, and in
that case they act as invisible spreaders for the disease [3]. Thus it becomes increasingly
important for mass medical testing for a country. Several researchers around the world are
actively working on producing mathematical models of the spread of COVID-19. Here we
quote that ‘model-based predictions can help policy makers make the right decisions in a
timely way, even with the uncertainties about COVID-19 [4].
The primary preventive steps adapted by the Government of India fall into five categories
which include social distancing, movement restrictions public health measures, social and
economic measures, and nationwide lockdown. A few notable decisions by the Government
of India are given in Table 7. It should be noted that a complete nationwide lockdown from
March 25 till May 13 helped to control the spread the disease at large distances but failed
to prevent it in neighboring districts, as observed in [5]. For example, before lockdown,
infected cases are reported from different districts across India which are at large distances
apart, however during the lockdown period it has been observed that new spread is reported
in districts which are neighbors of infected districts. Besides, due to lack of well planned
policy for migrant workers several of them have been travelling to their native districts during
lockdown. Unavailability of data of such a traffic flow across the districts can be crucial in
order to do a precise analysis of the spread. It can also be seen that the preventive measures
proposed by the Government of India are similar to those adapted in other counties.
It is observed in various studies that COVID-19 exhibits significantly different epidemiological attributes than other well studied epidemics in past. Thus it is of paramount interest
to develop mathematical models which can characterize the inherent dynamics of the spread
of COVID-19. Standard epidemic models such as SIR model considers human-to-human
transmission, and it describes the diffusion process through three mutually exclusive stages of
infection: Susceptible, Infected and Recovered. These models are also called compartmental
models [6] which enables to compartmentalize different individuals based their states for the
epidemic in a population. This model can help gain some insights about the growth of the
infection based on approximating the model parameters from the available data. However due
to a peculiar growth of COVID-19 in different countries, researchers have extended the SIR
model and other existing models such as SIS model in order to acquire meaningful insights
about spread of the COVID-19 [7]. It is very important to note that these studies can help
us to frame control strategies and policies that can mitigate the epidemic [8] [9].
One of the first models for the spread of COVID-19 is proposed by Anastassopoulou et al.
based on the data of confirmed cases reported at the Hubei province of China from the 11th
of January until the 10th of February, 2020 [10]. They propose a discrete SIRD (SusceptibleInfected-Recovered-Dead) model and estimate the mean values of the corresponding epidemiological parameters such as basic reproduction number, the case fatality and case recovery
ratio from the data. This model enables to forecast about the spread in near future. In an
another attempt, in [11] the authors study the datasets of transmission from within and outside Wuhan, China to estimate how transmission in Wuhan varied between December 2019,
and February 2020, and assess the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission to
occur in locations outside Wuhan through a stochastic transmission dynamic model. In [12],
a mean-field epidemiological model is proposed for COVID-19 epidemic in Italy by extending the classical SIR model. Here, in addition to susceptible (S) and infected (I), the other
stages of individuals are considered as diagnosed (D), ailing (A), recognized (R), threatened
(T), healed (H) and extinct (E), collectively termed as SIDARTHE. In [6], an Age-stratified
model of the COVID-19 is proposed to capture the age-dependent dynamics for nowcasting
and forecasting for Switzerland. This model incorporates the compartments of symptomatic
and asymptomatic infected individuals along with susceptible and exposed individuals. In
[13], the authors propose a model of COVID-19 epidemic dynamics under quarantine conditions. They also develop methods to estimate quarantine effectiveness in a country or a region
which is infected with COVID-19. Besides, a few models are proposed for understanding and
predicting the spread of COVID-19 based on metapopulation network approach, see [14] [15]

[16].
Several mathematical models are also proposed based on the the available COVID-19 data
of India and fitting them into classical epidemic models incorporating other factors such as
nationwide lockdown, social distancing etc., see [17] [18] [19] and the references therein. In
[20], a mathematical model of the spread of COVID-19 is proposed based on an age-structured
SIR model. However, the comparison of this model prediction with real data is criticized by
Dhar in [21]. In [22], the authors perform state-wise analysis of the data of infected population
in different states based three models: Exponential Model, Logistic Model and the SIS model.
They also provide state-wise prediction for number of infected people for different states in
recent future. An elementary network-based model for geographical spread of COVID-19 in
India is proposed in [23] . In [24], a model for the spread of COVID-19 in India is proposed
emphasizing on migration of population based on the spatial network of cities, incorporating
the growth-dynamics of SIR model at the city-level.
In this paper, we propose an epidemiological model for the spread of a contagious epidemic
in a region or country. The entire model is based on combining two growth processes of the
spread at local and global level. By local, we mean at the level of city or town or districts or
province, and global mean at the level of state or country. First we develop a new discrete
model for the growth-dynamics of infected people at local level as follows. We consider four
type of individuals living at a location. These are individuals who are tested as infected (X1 ),
tested as non-infected (X2 ), untested but infected (asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic, X3 ),
and untested and non-infected (X4 ) for the disease. Total number of such individuals equals
the total population living at that location. Given the time series data of these numbers
Xi (t), t = 1, 2, 3, 4, we define the growth statistic Xi (t + 1) − Xi (t) utilizing Xj (t), j 6= i
and four other parameters each one of them is related to the the spreading pattern of the
virus which causes the disease. Note that the different standard compartmental models exist
in literature based on susceptible, infected, recovered, and diseased, which do not preserve
the effect of parameters in an epidemic like COVID-19. In our proposed model, the growthdynamics at local level include the following parameters:
(a) Spread due to infected but asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals
(b) Effect of preventative measures like lockdown or restricted movement of individuals
across locations
(c) Daily testing statistics.
Then we consider the metapopulation network of all the locations at local level in order
to incorporate the transmission dynamics of disease at the global level. Here we mention
that the metapopulation network model is a standard and popular model for analyzing the
spread of highly contagious diseases which include Zika virus [25]. Also see [26] and the
references therein. In our proposed model, the vertices of the metapopulation network are
the locations infected with the disease and the links connecting them represent the possible
mode of transportation or spatial distance such as the great circle distance of the latitude and
longitude coordinates of the locations at local level. The weight of these links, that represent
the rate or percentage of transmission of population per unit time such as a day. Then the
final model is defined by combining the dynamics of the spread at local and global level. The
values of the model parameters are obtained by a learning technique based on training data
and an error minimization.
In the case of COVID-19, we consider the model parameters at the local level as testing
statistic, social distance, and rate of infected people by an infected but untested individual
(asymptomatic or pre-sympotatic) per unit time. In the context of India, the locations are
considered as districts which constitutes the states and union territories of India. There are
28 states and 8 union territories in India, and there are a total of 718 districts in India.
Based on the proposed model we predict number of COVID-19 infected people both at
state level and the country (India) level. The prediction depends on the number of testing

performed per day. The results show that the total number of infected people at India level
will be approximately 0.46 Millions on July 7, 2020, 1.9 Millions on November 7, 2020, and
4.6 Millions on May 7 2021 when the number of testing is approximately 1,00,000 per day
at the country level (which is the number of testing as on May 7, 2020 approximately). If
the number of testing grows linearly (with a certain rate see Section 3.2) then the number of
people tested positively with COVID-19 would be approximately 2 Millions on July 7, 2020,
59 Millions on November 7, 2020, and 130 Millions on May 7, 2021. Finally, if the number of
testing grows log-linearly (with a certain rate, see Section 3.2) then the number COVID-19
infected people in India would be approximately 1.3 Millions on July 7, 2020, 3.77 Millions on
November 7, 2020, 8.5 Millions on May 7, 2021. Note that these above mentioned predictions
are made when there is no external measure is used to control the spread, for example, using
any cure like a vaccine or drug discovered in between. Further using numerical simulation
we show that the spread stops when daily number of testing increases linearly or log-linearly,
however if the number of testing remains approximately the same as of May 7, 2020 the spread
need not stop in recent future, say in the year 2021.

The proposed model

Let V = { l | l is the index of a location} be the set of locations where persons infected with
COVID-19 are likely to stay in or move to on a day t. Suppose that Nl is the population
size in location l. Now we introduce the following notations to model the distribution and
dynamics of pandemic. If Tl (t) denotes the number of tested individuals in the location l then
T̄l (t) = Nl − Tl (t) stands for the number non-tested individuals up to time t. Let Cl+ (t) and
Cl− (t) be the total number of people infected and non-infected with COVID-19, respectively
in a location l ∈ V. Here these temporal data varies with time (t) measured in days. In any
location l for a given day t, we define a random vector
h
iT
X[l] (t) = X1[l] (t) X2[l] (t) X3[l] (t) X4[l] (t)

with four components for the distribution of population the Nl . Based on the above discussion
X[l] (t) can be represented in a 2 × 2 contingency-table, Table 1. Obviously,

the total population at the location l, though X3 (t) & X4 (t) are unobserved or latent random
variables. Unlike the standard epidemic models, the asymptomatic infected people or who
[l]
[l]
are infected with COVID-19 but not tested, that is, X3 (t) may influence the number X1 (t′ )

′
at a future date t > t. Besides, Cl (t) highly depends on the contact networks of Cl (t ) at a
[l]
previous date t′′ < t. But only X1 (t) is observed. Thus the number of people who are tested
for COVID-19 at a given day governs the dynamics of X[l] (t) at a location l over time.

2 The proposed model

Let Tel (t + 1) be a strategic number which provides the target quantity of new tests for
COVID19 to be performed on day (t + 1) in location l. Given the statistic X[l] (t), new tests
also depends on the availability of test-kits. However, this also depends on T̄l (t), the number
of people not tested for the disease at the location l. Hence, we define the possible number of
tests to be performed at l as
Tel∗ (t + 1) = min{Tel (t + 1), T̄l (t)}.

In Table 2, we introduce some generic notations of model-parameters that are used to
develop the dynamics of the system and some more hyper-parameters that are involved in
training and updating of model-parameters. All the parameters modified with suffix/super-fix

Now we consider the meta-population network G(t) with vertex set V of locations in order
to incorporate the effect of transmission of COVID-19 across the locations. Let A(t) = [akl (t)]
denote the adjacency matrix associated with G(t). Let dkl denote the distance between k and
l. Then define the weights of the edges of G(t) as


dkl
(6)
wkl (t) ∝ exp −
θ(t)
where θ(t) is the mobility parameter. Here wkl denotes diffusion weight for the human traffic
flows per day between the neighboring locations k and l. The value of θ(t) > 0 may be
controlled based on government policies. For instance, in the case of strict lockdown the
value of θ(t) may be considered as a small value. Now we define the matrix M (t) = [mkl (t)]
where
wkl (t)
mkl = P|V|
l=1 wkl (t)

which is a row-stochastic matrix. Finally we propose the following predictive model at the
level of state and country for the number of COVID-19 infected people.
[l]
Note that the traffic flow between locations influences the value of X4 (t + 1) as followed
[l]
by Eq. (5) which contribute to X3 (t + 1) and finally to the number of infected people
[l]
X1 (t + 1). Besides, the number of nodes in the metapopulation network G(t) varies with
time. At time t, the nodes of G(t) represented the districts which are affected by the diaease
P
[l]
[S]
at time t. Thus at the level of state S which consists of some locations, X1 = l∈S X1 at
anytime t. Further, the number of infected people at the country level is calculated based on
[l]
the proposed dynamics of Xi , i ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4} where l is a state. This is done presumably due
to the traffic flow between neighboring districts may be different from the traffic flow between
P
[I]
[S]
neighboring states. Hence, at the country level, say India, denoted by I, X1 = S∈I X1
at anytime (day) t.

2.1

Hyper-parameter selection and model parameters updation

In this section we discuss how to determine the values of the parameters involved in the
proposed epidemiological model. Note that the initial values can be assumed wisely based on
its characteristics observed from data and then as the time passes the model can update the
values of the parameters from observed and simulated data. Let [t0 , t1 ] be the learning period
throughout which the real data is available and the model can learn the data for estimating the
values of the parameters. Consequently, the growth-dynamics of parameters can be defined
which can update the values of the parameters when the real data is not available in future.
[l]
First we consider the parameter λ1 (t). Then define

spreading rate λ1 (t) is updated in such a way that if the number of tested and infected cases
are more than the simulated values then infection spreading rate would be more as compared
to current rate of of infection and vice versa. The value of α1 represents the slope of the line
[l]
along which λ1 (t) increases with time linearly.

[l]
λ3 (t) and ǫ in current version.

Fig. 1: Figure explains the way to update infection spreading rate.

2.2

Testing rate

Recall that individuals who are at the asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic stages of infection,
act as invisible spreaders for the disease. Hence, detection of individuals who are infected
with the virus plays an important role into the growth-dynamics of the number of infected
individuals at a particular location. Thus one of the control strategies to prevent the spread
is to conduct enough number of tests per day and separate-out the infected people. In a
country like India, where approximately 1.4 billion people live, conducting enough tests per
day could be a difficult exercise. Besides, due to lack of huge number of test-kits and medical
facilities, India is facing a lot of challenges to perform enough tests per day. The testing data
in India is plotted in Fig. 2 which is obtained from [27]. It may be observed that the data
is not available for three consecutive days after the 30th day. Besides the testing data is not
available before March 19, 2020.
Note that testing for COVID-19 for random sampling of individuals is not desired due to
scarcity of enough testing kits for a large population and medical support facilities. Indeed,
targeted testing by tracing social contacts of newly detected individuals with COVID-19
can be more efficient for identifying asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals who are
infected with the virus. Hence the increment of number of testing per day should depend on
the testing-coverage probability among the infected individuals at a particular location, that
[l]
is, λ1 .

Fig. 2: Testing performed daily in India, from March 19,2020 to May 20,2020 [27].
In this model we incorporate two possible growth of testing data over time at a location:
linear and log-linear. The parameters which we call rate of gain in the number of tests for
COVID-19, are denoted by r1 and r2 for the following linear and log-linear growth equations
respectively. From the real data it can be observed that the number of tested positive cases
[l]
has positive correlation (0.9177) with number of test performed. Indeed, from Eq. (7), λ1 (t)
has positive dependency over the number of tested positive cases. Thus, the number of tests
[l]
performed has positive relation with λ1 .
Let Tel (t) denote the number of tests performed at a location l on a day t. Then define

Thus assigning small values of λ1 (t), λ2 (t) in the beginning of the simulation of the model,
[l]
λ2 (t), and Tel (t) are updated according to Eqs. (7), (8), and (10) or (9) respectively.
Further, α1 , β1 , and r2 can be selected from the interior of the unit cube given by (0, 1) ×
(0, 1)×(0, 1), whereas r1 can be larger than 1. The searching method is well-known as as three

Prediction of number of individuals infected with COVID-19 at
global level

Now we discuss how the values of the model parameters estimated by real data at local
location can be used to predict the number of infected people at a global level such as state
and country level in near future. We propose to train the model based on two methodologies
at the the state level and country level. Recall that a state in India consists of several districts
(locations denoted by l), and in India there are 28 states and 8 union territories. In this paper
we adapt two-step approach for the prediction. The global level parameters include the social
mobility parameter θ, and the traffic flow across the local level locations, given by the edge
weight of the metapopulation network.
P
[S]
[l]
[l]
First, we make state level prediction, that is, X1 = l∈S X1 (t) when X1 is considered
at district level l, where S is a state of India. The metapopulation network for a state S is
formed by the vertices which are districts belong to the state S, and the traffic flow which is
represented by weights wkl defined by Eq. (6). The distance dkl between two districts k, l is
defined by the great circle distance between the longitude and latitude coordinates of k and
l.
Next, once the estimates for X1S are obtained for all states S in India, the prediction at the
the nation level is obtained by applying the proposed model treating the location as states.
Thus model parameters are further estimated comparing with the real data at the level of
states, as described above. Further, the metapopulation network of states is constructed,
and the traffic flow is calculated using the wight formula wkl where the distance between two
states is considered as the great circle distance between the longitude and latitude coordinates
of states k and l.

Note that both predictions at state and country level incorporate the social mobility
parameter θ which preserves the effect of policies of the Government. For instance, during
locklown the value of θ is considered as around 50 (more weights to local travel), and it will
take the value around 2000 (includes long distance travel) when there is no lockdown. Besides
the metapopulation network between the locations l plays a crucial role into the prediction.
The rate of traffic between two locations is considered as given by Eq. (6). Observed that
the effect of social mobility of individuals is also incorporated with the traffic flow.

Prediction with model and real data: a case study of India

In this section, the proposed model is trained with the data of infected population with
COVID-19 and number of testings performed in India from March 4, 200 to May 7, 2020
[28]. Since there is nationwide lockdown during this period, the traffic flow across states is
less. Therefore we simulate the model at an initial time t0 = 0 which is on March 4, 2020 by
[l]
[l]
[l]
setting λ1 (t0 ) = 1 × 10−3 , λ2 (t0 ) = 3 × 10−1 , r2 = 2.8 × 10−1 and λ3 (t) = 1 × 10−3 for all
t ≥ t0 , for every location l. These values are assumed due to the following facts.
(1) Testing-coverage probability is very small since the number of people infected with
COVID-19 in the beginning of the spread is small.
(2) Since the average family size is 4, so approximately 3 people out of 10 may be exposed
to get infected assuming that a person be in close and frequent contact with an group
of infected people.

Fig. 4: Plots are corresponding to data fitting (0-65 days), validation (66-72 days), and prediction of 78th day or May 20, 2020.
(3) For simplicity of the model, we consider the value of r2 such that total number of
tested individuals are close to real data. We obtained r2 = 0.28 during the optimization
(training) using grid search. To match the number of testing performed each day,
approximately 1, 00, 000 per day given after Eq. (10).
(4) Due to nationwide lockdown, the traffic flow across the locations is less. Hence, θ ≤ 70
and λ3 (t) is very less. The values of θ and λ3 (t)[l] are obtained using grid search. During
[l]
error optimization, (α1 , β1 , r2 , θ, λ3 ) is selected from five dimensional grid search.
After the initializing the model the parameter values are learned based on the real data.
For instance, the number of testings throughout the period March 04, 2020 to May 20, 2020
in India is approximately 105 per day [28, 27], and hence value of r2 is kept fixed during the
training period of the model with real data. The value of number of testing at a location l is
assumed as a random number between 1 to 5 when a first case of COVID-19 is reported.
The model is trained with the real data collected from How India Lives [28, 27] for the
period of March 04, 2020 to May 07, 2020 (65 days data). The remaining data, that is, the
real data for the period May 8 - 20, 2020 is validated based on estimated values of the model
parameters of the training dataset. A particular emphasis is given on the states where there
are more that 2000 cases of individuals infected with COVID-19 on May 7, 2020 (data used
for training) which include Maharashtra (MH), Tamilnadu (TN), Gujrat (GUJ), Rajathan
(RAJ), Madhya Pradesh (MP), Uttar Pradesh (UP), West Bengal (WB) and Andhra Pradesh
(AP). The error function contains the absolute difference between data point (observed value)
and corresponding value calculated using model. We define an error function which minimizes

purpose. The model parameters are learned by optimizing the error function as described in
Section 2.3. On an average per location (district) error when the prediction is made at the

the rate r2 = 0.28. At the country level the error corresponding to real data and model based
prediction is calculated with error 37.2070 on average at each state when the testing grows
log-linearly as above. Below we provide prediction at the level of state and India. During
training the model, we consider log-linear gain in rate of testing, and error in fitting real data
is reported in Table 3. After training and validation, two cases of gain in rate of testing are
considered: linear and log-linear.

3.1

Statewise prediction

We consider 8 states which have highest number of tested positive cases. For each state,
we learn a model and do the prediction of probable tested positive cases after 7 days of the
last day of validation data. We consider only those states which have sufficient data to train
the model (at-least 2000 tested positive cases on May 7, 2020). Learned values of model
parameters corresponding to each state are given in Table 3.
After training the models corresponding to data of each state, we do the prediction of total
tested positive cases in all the states on May 20, 2020. Predicted values and actual values are
noted in Table 4.
In all the experiments performed in this work, we set ǫ = 2, α = 4, and λ3 and θ are
selected using grid search and values are given in Table 3.

2020.

3.1.1

Prediction with the number of testing as of May 7, 2020

Maharashtra is the most affected state in India which has at-least 30% of total tested positive
cases in the country on May 20, 2020. Apart from Maharashtra (MH), we consider Tamil
Nadu (TN), Gujarat (GUJ), Rajasthan (RAJ), Madhya Pradesh (MP), Uttar Pradesh (UP),
West Bengal (WB), and Andhra Pradesh (AP). Maharashra has 39297 tested positive cases
as of May 20, 2020 and the proposed model predicts it as 38724 which is fairly close enough
to observed value. Similarly, TamilNadu, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh (MP), Uttar
Pradesh (UP), West Bengal (WB), and Andhra Pradesh (AP) have total number of tested
COVID-19 infected cases as 13191, 12539, 6011, 5735, 5175, 3103, and 2560, and respective
predicted values by the proposed model are 15092, 12453, 5197, 5389, 5089, 3039, and 2509
as of May 20, 2020. Thus, we conclude that the model is able to learn and predict the total
number of tested positive cases in each of these states.
In Figures 3 and 4, data and corresponding curve fitting is shown in which blue dots
correspond to real data which are used as training data set, and the sky blue dots correspond
to the validation data-set. The grey circles represent the trained and predicted values due to
the proposed model which are following the real data very well. Grey square in plots (X=78
marked point in plots) indicates predicted value on May 20, 2020.
Apart from next 7 days of prediction, we do a prediction for after 60 days, 180 days, and
365 days from the date of validation (May 14, 2020) under different values of testing rates r1
and r2 . Predicted values are tabulated in Tables 4 and 5 for different states and in Table 6
for India. Note that r1 = 0 means when the testing statistics remain same as per testing data
on May 07, 2020. However, if the number of total testing increases linearly or log-linearly
as defined by Eqs. (9) and (10) then the number of people detected with COVID-19 increase
significantly. This will be discussed in the next subsection.
The total estimate for the total number of COVID-19 infected people in India would be
approximately 4,60,000 on July 7, 2020; 19,00,000 on November 7, 2020; and 46,00,000 on
May 7, 2021, if the number of testing maintains the present statistics including lockdown
condition.

number of positive cases get changes and testing is able to trace all the branches of
infection spreading after certain time limit. In simulations, parameters are considered
at state level.

3.1.2

Effect on the total number of infected with linear and log-linear increment in
testing

Currently, in India the number of testing conducted per day is approximately 1, 00, 000 samples per day. However, training the proposed model over the real data provides the rate of
testing r2 = 0.28. The testing data is not available district level but at the state level. After
learning the data, the model uses different rates of gain in testing for validation. If r2 = 0
then it means that per day testing is constant for the entire period of interest. In order to
observe the effect of statistics of testing on the count of total number of people infected with
COVID-19, we propose two types of growth in testing: linear and log-linear.
First we perform this experiment when testing is increased linearly using Eq. (9), for

3 Prediction with model and real data: a case study of India

15

r1 = 5000 and r1 = 50000. As follows form Figure 5, we consider three cases: (I) Per day
testing is constant and corresponding curve is in grey color which is lowest among all three.
The number of total cases of COVID-19 increasing slowly due to less number of testing over
a huge population. (II) Increment of testings per day with r1 = 5000 results into a drastic
change in number of infected cases and it is increasing continuously and after certain time the
rate of infection goes down but does not contain. This implies that this rate of testing may not
control the spread of the disease. (III) Finally, When the increment of testing grows linearly
with r1 = 50000 then the simulation shows that the number of infected cases stabilizes and
the spread gets contained. During the simulation, we consider parameter values at state level.
Now we discuss the effect of testing when it is increasing at log-linear rate under Eq. (10).
We consider the following cases: (I) The number of testing is constant with the value as of
May 7, 2020. (II) If the gain in the rate of testing is r2 = 0.1 then it does not stabilize
(III) When r2 = 0.4 the simulation result shows stabilizes the spread and the spread can be
controlled. Number of infected cases get stabilized after certain time limit, a magnified view
is shown in Figure 6.

[l]
can be controlled before its pandemic like situation. (a) when λ3 (t)(= 1/100) is very
less then θ does not show its impact. Dark red patches are corresponding to points
(r2 , θ) which has large number of tested positive cases and these points are scattered
all over the middle (II) region (highest value of tested positive cases is almost 6 × 106).
[l]
While in (b) λ3 (t)(= 1/10) is significantly large and it shows the contribution of local
mobility in spreading of infection. In plot, it is observe that dark red patches have
more concentration inside circle (lower values of θ and r2 ). Here in middle (red region)
region, lower values of θ gives more weights to near by locations and less weights to
locations at distances while higher values of θ give almost equal weights to all regions
for mobility.
3.1.3

Effect of the mobility parameter:

Now we study the effect of mobility of individuals (θ), probability of migration across locations
[l]
(λ3 (t)) in the spread of the disease. Besides, we analyze the joint effect of the parameters
[l]
θ, λ3 (t)) and the increment of number of testing r2 (see Eq. s (2) - (5)). For instance,
during lockdown, the value of θ can be considered as a small value. Indeed, the mobility
parameter takes a smaller value as compared to the distance between districts which are far

Fig. 8: (a) Blue dots are corresponding to data points used to train the model, grey circles are
corresponding to trained and predicted values, sky blue dots are data points used for
validation of prediction. Model is trained for infection data of 65 days, and prediction
has been performed for next 7 days with high accuracy (validation set). Sky blue dots
(real data) are close enough to corresponding predicted values (grey circles). There
is shown a test point, corresponding to which, the values of tested positive cases is
1.152 × 105 , and 1.122 × 105 is the actual value of it. (b) Cumulative number of

apart but belong to the same state, and it is also true for states within the country during the
lockdown period. Besides, the probability of migration is very less corresponds to lockdown
effect. In simulation, we notice that the mobility parameter reaches the value up to 70 and
the migration probability is less than 0.1.
In Figure 7, (in both the plots) we identify three regions: (I) The region in the middle,
where number of tested positive (simulated) is highest, (II) A narrow region, left of (I) where
the number of tested positive is less as compared to (I), and (III) stabilizing region, which
is right to (I) that has less number of tested positive cases and it signifies that after certain
value of r2 , infection spreading can be controlled.
[l]
We observe the following: (a) when λ3 (t) = 0.01 no significant effect of θ in the number
of infected cases is found and it simulates the spread in neighboring locations of a location
which is infected (highest value of tested positive cases is almost 6 × 106). On the other hand,
[l]
in (b) when λ3 (t) = 0.1 then the contribution of local mobility into the spread of the disease
is noticed. In the second plot of Figure 7, observe that there are dark red patches (inside
circles) corresponding to lower values of θ and r2 . In the middle (red region), the number of
infected cases is more as compared to the previous case.
Moreover, note from Eq. (6) that if the value of social mobility parameter θ is much
larger than maxk,l∈V(t) dkl then the traffic flow indicator wkl becomes almost uniform for all k
and l. On the other hand, a small value of θ generates more traffic flow between neighboring
locations and induce less traffic flow across locations which are a large distant apart. If θ is
considered comparatively larger value then the traffic flow are almost equal across locations.
Besides, if θ is assigned in such a way that it induces higher traffic flow between the
locations which are significantly infected then the infected people in both the corresponding
location significantly increase. Consequently, the dark red patches are wide spread over the
middle region in Figure 7(a). Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that lower values of
θ corresponds to dark red patches which signifies local transmission, and larger values of θ
corresponds to long-distance transmission of COVID-19.

model (from March 4, 2020 to May 7, 2020), grey circles are corresponding to trained and
predicted values, sky blue dots are data points used for validation of prediction (from May 8,
2020 to May 14, 2020) [27]. In this plot, we have shown that model is trained for infection
data of 65 days, validated using next 7 days data, and prediction has been performed for
next 7th days almost accurately. Sky blue dots (real data) almost coincide with the centres
of corresponding to the predicted values (grey circles). Here training error is 37.2070.
Apart from short range prediction, we also do long range prediction in which we do the
prediction of possible number of tested positive cases after 60 days, 180 days, and 365 days
are noted in the last column of Table 6 under different testing rates r1 and r2 . We consider
r1 = 0, 20000, 60000, and r2 = 0, 0.1, 0.4; after training, r1 = 0 means testing will continue
with current volume (approximately 1,00,000 per day).
If the number of testing increases linearly with r1 = 103 then the total number of people
infected with COVID-19 would be approximately 5.3 Millions on July 7, 2020; 88 Millions
on November 7, 2020; and 220 Millions. For linear growth with r1 = 5 × 103 in testing
approximates the total number of infected people in India as 2 Millions on July 7, 2020; 59
Millions on November 7, 2020; and 130 Millions, see Table 6. Also the same for the log-linear
increase of testing per day is given in Table 6.
3.2.1

Stabilization of the spread of COVID-19

In this section, we discuss about the stabilization of spreading of COVID-19 in future. This
means the number of newly affected gradually decrease, and the number of total number of
infected people at country level becomes almost constant. From the analysis of the effect of

mobility parameter θ and gain in testing rate r2 (log-linear) or r1 (linear), from Figure 7 it
can be concluded that higher testing rate is more effective as we know that presently available
data is obtained under very less mobility rate. However, as the mobility will increase after
lifting the nationwide lockdown, the infection will presumably spread very fast.
Here, we demonstrate time series analysis of infection spreading under different values of
testing parameter r1 for all the states and India. From Figures 8(b) and 6(a) for country
level, where as 9, and 10 for state level show the stabilization of tested positive cases with
increasing number testing of after certain threshold.

that we have two plots (one from each sub-figure) in which once curves of total
infected cases flattened and again rise very fast. It corresponds to the second wave
of the spread of COVID-19.

3.2.2

Second wave

The second wave of a pandemic is often observed in a region when interventions are effectively
applied to mitigate the spread of the disease and but are then lifted [29]. In the proposed
model of this paper, the second wave can be examined under the following scenarios: (I) If
the number of testing performed daily is not enough, that is, it is at per with the cumulative
number of all social contacts of previously detected people with COVID-19, then there would
not be any sign of second wave; (II) If the number of testing is large enough such that next
day available cases to be tested is decreasing continuously and spreading will get controlled
soon; and (III) If the number of testing performed daily is sufficient to detect the number
of cases at present state of the number of infections but somehow due to few events, (for
example, if number of tested positive daily decreases and also the number of testing to be
performed is below the required limit) then a second wave of diffusion may be observed. Thus
it is important to track the last trail of infection diffusion completely to control it. Using
simulation, we show that the second wave can be observed under different scenario which
include: Number of testings is increased (a) linearly (b) log-linearly, in Figure 11.

Conclusion

We have proposed an epidemiological model for the spread of COVID-19. The model is based
on spread at local level which can be at the level of province, town, city or districts by combining a statistical approach and using the metapopulation network of infected locations. The
model incorporates a few parameters which represent the effect of spread by asymptomatic
or pre-symptomatic individuals, restricted mobility of individuals, and the testing statistics.
Predictions of total number of tested with COVID-19 people are made at the level of state

and the entire country, based on the data of testing as of May 7, 2020, and under linear and
log-linear growth of testing statistics. Finally it is shown that the spread can be contained in
very near future if linear or log-linear growth of testing is adapted.
The stabilization of infected cases primarily depends on the number of testing and the
inter location transition of population or the strictness of lockdown. If the testing rate is
low or moderate it may show less count of infected cases. But there is a chance of second
wave to hit-back. If the testing rate is sufficiently large and executed with proper sampling
scheme then the count of positive will get stabilized much early. The proposed epidemiological
model can be applied and generalized for prediction of total number of tested with COVID-19
people at any country. Indeed, if metapopulation network is a network of countries then the
prediction can be made at the world level based on the data of transmission of populations
across the countries.
