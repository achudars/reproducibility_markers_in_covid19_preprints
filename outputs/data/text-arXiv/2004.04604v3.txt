Abstract
The Covid-19 epidemic of the novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS CoV-2) has been spreading around the world. While different containment policies using
non-pharmaceutical interventions have been applied, their efficiency are not known
quantitatively. We show that the doubling time Td(t) with the success s factor, the
characteristic time of the exponential growth of Td(t) in the arrested regime, is a reliable
tool for early predictions of epidemic spread time evolution and it provides a quantitative
measure of the success of different containment measures. The efficiency of the
containment policy Lockdown case Finding mobile Tracing (LFT) using mandatory mobile
contact tracing is much higher than the Lockdown Stop and Go (LSG) policy proposed by
the Imperial College team in London. A very low s factor was reached by LFT policy
giving the shortest time width of the dome of positive case curve and the lowest number of
fatalities. The LFT policy has been able to reduce by a factor 100 the number of fatalities in
the first 100 days of the Covid-19 epidemic, to reduce the time width of the Covid-19
pandemic dome by a factor 2.5 and to rapidly stop new outbreaks avoiding the second
wave.

1. Introduction
The diffusion of Covid-19 is a transnational phenomenon that involves all continents
reaching a million of positive cases and thousands of deaths at early April, 2020. Following
the threshold of the very fast Covid-19 epidemic in January 2020 in Wuhan [1,2], it was
found that a very small characteristic time (about 2 days) of the exponential growth and the
characteristic number R0 of infected humans by one infected case was about R0=2.3, much
larger than the critical value of 1, pointing to an explosion of the pandemic with possible
millions of infected people in few weeks [3].
In the absence of a Covid-19 vaccine and without established therapies, scientists
informed the policy makers for the urgent need of actions for epidemic containment
measures [4,5] to reduce the expected number of hundreds of thousands of deaths in the
short time of the pandemic peak. Non-pharmaceutical interventions to reduce the care need
requests, below the critical number of beds available in hospitals, have been proposed for
USA [6,7] based on the experience on SARS containment invoking in addition fast
containment measures such as self-isolation. The lockdown stop and go protocol has been
proposed by Ferguson group of Imperial College [8] based on simulations with models
developed on the basis of known influenza pandemic [9,10]. The epidemic control
measures look for the reduction of the number of daily new cases N(t) to avoid an
unacceptable load to the health care systems to reach the goal of reducing the number of
deaths. The traditional method to reduce the number of deaths was the lockdown, an
emergency protocol that is enforced to prevent people from leaving a given area, city or a
region. This containment measure expands the time lapse of the virus diffusion by
stretching the exponent of its exponential growth. Therefore, while the number of cases will
decrease at the top, the time extent of the epidemic will become longer, however with a
severe negative impact to the economy.
China first focused an unconventional Covid-19 policy to reduce both the number of
deaths and the time extent of the epidemic [1]. This unconventional policy called here
Lockdown, case Finding, mobile Tracing (LFT) was based on the combination of measures
2

Antonio Bianconi et al. Efficiency of Covid-19 Containment by Measuring Time Dependent Doubling Time

looked to reduce both the number of new daily cases at epidemic peak and to reduce the
time width of the epidemic dome. Achieving the reduction of both maximum and width of
the diffusion peak, China obtained the drastic reduction of the total number of deaths. After
about 80 days from the epidemic threshold, on April 7th 2020 the long-term lockdown was
stopped in China with officially less the 3400 fatalities. It has been the largest “experiment”
to test the efficiency of the new LFT policy in the history of the epidemiology, which takes
advantage of both mass search of positive cases and the tracing of infected cases by a
mobile phone application. A similar approach has been considered by other countries, all
taking advantage of advanced methods based on Apps, i.e., software applications designed
to run on mobile phones and the treatments of Big Data developed in the last years. The
success of the Chinese and south Korean Covid-19 policy was considered by other
countries such as Norway, Singapore, and Taiwan [5].
The more conventional approach - a type of “herd immunity” - has been considered by
European countries, and USA, called Lockdown stop and go (LSC), [8]. The LSC approach
is made of combination of advices for the population to keep “physical distancing” to
protect others, to stay at home only for positive cases, household quarantine of their family
members and to reduce traveling. Intermittent measures are planned to be temporarily
relaxed in short time windows, and reintroduced when positive case numbers rebound [8].
The media informed the population about the actual numbers of epidemic cases and the
advices were diffused only weeks after the Covid-19 pandemic onset.
Italy, France and Spain, have followed the LSG policy and in March 2020 used the
mitigation strategy called here Mandatory Full Lockdown (MFL) with few days delay,
where the LSG traditional epidemiologic confinement approach was strongly enforced.
These unprecedented measures of imposition by law all over the country consist of physical
distancing, ordering enforced closure of schools, universities, all national manufactures,
ban of mass gatherings and public events, and confinement at home of the entire
population. This approach had the key target of reducing the number of infected cases day
per day paying attention not to overcome the maximum number of sick person requiring
3

Antonio Bianconi et al. Efficiency of Covid-19 Containment by Measuring Time Dependent Doubling Time

critical care [6-8]. In fact, the MLF policy gives priority to the health care system respect to
other economic demands.
Academic epidemiology analysis is usually made at the conclusion of the epidemic
event. On the contrary, in the case of the Covid-19 epidemic some countries immediately
shared verified data and made them available in public repositories. This opportunity gives
scientists the possibility to shed light on the new physics of epidemics with containment
measures [11-19] a growing field of high interest for population, health systems [8.9],
travels [20,21] and economy [10]. This is a highly interdisciplinary research activity, at the
intersections among biological physics, advanced statistical physics of complex systems,
physics of quantum complex materials, chain reactions control in nuclear reactors and the
most recent Big Data analysis methods.
It was clear for all scientists that in the early days Covid-19 follows the classical
exponential law of epidemic spreading with a constant rate, but it was realized by few
[11-19] that it is followed by a second regime with a variable time dependent rate quite
different for countries applying different policies. However, in spite of the relevance of the
question, none was able to measure in a quantitative way the relative efficiency of the
different containment measures based on verified Covid-19 data released by official
institutions and health agencies, a key information need to stop the diffusion of this
world-wide epidemic.
Only two weeks after the start of the MFL policy, it was [13,14] pointed out that the
slowing down of the pandemic diffusion was much less effective for the MLF that for the
LFT approach. The data analysis approach [13,14] used the quantitative determination of
the time dependent doubling time Td(t) of the Covid-19 pandemic spread calculated
averaging day by day data over a 5 days interval. The measure of the time dependent
doubling time (Td) is widely used not only in epidemiology, but also in the nuclear reactor
physics where it is used to keep the reactor in the critical regime between the subcritical
regime of the chain reactions of nuclear fission processes and the supercritical regime with
risks of severe explosive accidents. The similarity of the nuclear chain reactions in uranium
4

Antonio Bianconi et al. Efficiency of Covid-19 Containment by Measuring Time Dependent Doubling Time

with biological cell fission was already noticed by Lise Meitner and Otto Robert Frisch
when they coined the name nuclear fission, in 1939.
The comparative analysis of the time dependent doubling time data in South Korea and
Italy on March 15th after about 20 days from the epidemic threshold t0 has quickly shown
that the LFT controlled Covid-19 epidemic growth entered in the arrested phase in South
Korea while in Italy it was still rapidly growing in the near threshold phase [13,14]. This
was possible because the doubling time analysis has shown two well separated regimes: the
first near threshold phase, described by a stretching exponential with a slowly increasing
stretched characteristic time, followed by a second phase, the arrested growth process
following the Ostwald growth over the course of time, where one phase transforms into
another metastable phase, but with a similar free energy [13,14,22-24]. This mechanism has
been observed in the diffusion of oxygen interstitials diffusion in quantum complex matter
[25-27] and in the crystallization of complex molecules [28] and proteins [29].

2. Results and Discussion
The different efficacy of the containment policies can be recognized in Figure 1a where the
cumulative number of cases Nc(t) in different countries deposited on the data banks on the
95th day of the year, is plotted in the time scale with the zero sets at the first day t0 of the
exponential growth. The time t0 of the epidemic threshold has been defined as the day where
the time dependent doubling time shows a minimum before it starts to increase. Using this
criterion the cumulative number of cases shown in Fig.1a follows an average exponential
law from the 5th to the 14th day with a doubling time about 3 days and about 60 cases at the
initial time t0 of the epidemic threshold.
As it can be seen in the panel (a) of Figure 1 the diffusion rate for the different policies in
various countries is similar in the near threshold regime. Indeed, the reported curves of the
cumulative number of cases Nc(T) overlap in the near threshold regime during the first days
while they strongly diverge in the arrested regime. The dome of the positive case curve in
USA and UK has been predicted [7,8] using the standard individual-based simulation

model developed to support pandemic influenza planning [9,10] are plotted in panels (b)
and (c).

Figure 1. Standard curves used to report the Covid-19 epidemic time evolution showing the
cumulative number of cases (panel a) and the standard theoretical epidemiology predictions of the
needed number of beds based on the prediction of daily new cases for an uncontrolled epidemic
case (panel b) and mitigated epidemic case (panel c). Panel a) Cumulative number of positive
cases Nc(t) vs. time in South Korea (orange), France (blue), China (light blue), Italy (green), Spain
(magenta) and USA (red). The time scale for each curve of each country starts on the threshold
day t0. The curves overlap in the near threshold regime while later separate. The curves of the
cumulative number of cases of China and South Korea become flat after about 30 days, when the
pandemic is arrested. Panel b) & c) the theoretical predictions for the number of needed intensive
care beds (open symbols) from [8] for an uncontrolled diffusion (b) and for severe containment
measures (c). We show in Panel b) our calculation of the exponential variation of the doubling
time Td(t). The time dependent doubling time curves calculated in this work for uncontrolled
(black curve in panel b) and controlled epidemic (blue curve in Panel c). Our calculations predict
a different exponential increase of the doubling time in the near threshold regime (blue area) and
in the arrested regime (yellow area). The stop of the dome of the positive case curve occurs in the
range 50<Td(t)<70 d where the reproduction number R(t) becomes less than one, entering in the
critical regime where the effective infection time becomes equal to the effective removal time.

The calculated time dependent number of hospital beds dedicated to intensive care
medicine for the case of wild uncontrolled epidemic in panel (b) will imply the failure of
both USA and UK health care systems [6-8]. To avoid the break down it was proposed to
reduce the peak intensity in panel (b) by expanding the epidemic time scale by a factor 1.5
using non-pharmaceutical interventions, e.g., case isolation, home quarantine and physical

distancing, as evident in panel (c). In this work in order to evaluate the time evolution of
the epidemic growth, we have used the time dependent doubling time Td(t) as the key
physical parameter,

𝛵" (𝑡) =

where Nc(t) is the cumulative number of cases and the derivative at each time t is obtained
by averaging the Nc(t) curve over a period of five days.
The efficacy of the containment policies is probed by the increase of Td(t) from its
minimum value Td0=2 days, at the time threshold t0 to the time t* where Td=50 days. This
value of the doubling time is where the exponential growth in the supercritical phase (Td
<50) is expected to stop because it is the lowest limit of the Covid-19 epidemic critical
phase, in the range 50<Td<100 days, where the reproduction number R0 is near one [30].
Therefore, we have calculated the curves Td(t) in panels (b) and (c) of Figure 1, which
shows the exponential increase of Td(t) in the time range of the exponential growth showing
the dome of the positive case curve [13,14]. A kink in Td(t) separates two exponential
increasing regimes: the near threshold regime (shaded blue region) and the arrested regime
(shaded yellow region) separated by the transition regime around the peak of the pandemic
curve N(t) of the number of new daily cases. The theoretical curves of Td(t) for the
uncontrolled epidemic (black filled dots in panel b) and with the lockdown mitigation (blue
filled dots) show relevant changes on the time evolution behavior, which depends on the
containment policy. First, in the near threshold regime, the doubling time follows an
exponential growth (blue line in the semi-log scale) with the characteristic time s1

𝑇"4 = 𝐶4 𝑒 7/94

(2)

and in the arrested regime it follows a second exponential growth (red line in the semi-log
scale) with the characteristic time s2

(3)

The figure shows that the theory predicts that s2 is much smaller than the characteristic time
s1. In fact, measuring the average <s> factor by fitting the full Td(t) curve in the range 2< Td
<50 [13,14] we have provided a quantitative measure of the efficiency and the effectiveness
in term of time of the enforced containment policy. The extraction of <s>, s1, and s2 factors
allows a straightforward quantitative evaluation and, in addition, a quantitative comparison
of the different containment policies adopted to control the epidemic become possible. The
calculations show that the factor s1 decreases in the near threshold regime from the wild
regime value s1=80 days in panel (b) to the lockdown regime s1=140 days in panel (c). The
factor s2 in the arrested regime increases from the wild regime value s2=8.2 days in panel
(b) to the lockdown regime s2=14.2 days in panel (c).
The doubling time Td(t) reaches the value of 50 days after more than two months in the
wild uncontrolled pandemic spread curve, while this value is reached after 110 days in the
most severe lockdown policy, i.e., the pandemic is predicted to be about 1.6 times longer in
the lockdown regime, in agreement with the ratio of the half width values at half maximum.
The explosion of the Covid-19 pandemic has seen a fast response of the scientific
community proposing different models, which can be quickly verified or falsified analyzing
experimental data by fast computer codes, useful to test the different containment measures
[11-19].
The key results of our work are shown in Figure 2 and 3 where we report the doubling time
Td(t) as a function of time, extracted by verified data vs. time with the zero sets at the
threshold time t0 in several countries where different Covid-19 epidemic policies have been
enforced. The time evolution of the experimental doubling time Td(t) for South Korea and
China where the Lockdown, case Finding, mobile Tracing (LFT) policy was applied is
plotted in panel (a). The dome of the positive case curve in both countries is shown by the
curve of verified data of the number N(t) of daily new cases.

Figure 2. In this figure we report the time evolution of the doubling time Td, which we propose here
to use to shed light on the unconventional time evolution of the Covid-19 pandemic with
containment measures. Panel a) Evolution of the experimental doubling time Td(t) in the countries
where the LFT policy was enforced: South Korea (filled orange dots) and China (filled blue dots).
The open circles are the known curves of the number of daily new cases N(t) which are used here to
track the time evolution pandemic domes. Panel b) the experimental time dependent doubling time
Td(t) in Spain (filled orange dots), France (filled blue dots) and Italy, (filled blue dots) where the
Mandatory Full Lockdown MFL policy was applied. Panel c) the evolution of the doubling time in
USA (filled red dots) and UK (filled blue dots) applying the policy called Lockdown stop and go
(LSC). The N(t) curves are plotted in semi-log scale in panel b and c. In panel (a) and (b) the numbers
in the N(t) curves are normalized to overlap all curves in the near threshold region. The near
threshold time regime in panel (b) and panel (c) identified in the range between the threshold and the
kink in the Td(t) is 27 days in panel (b) and similar in panel (c).

The experimental doubling time Td(t) where the time unit is one day, is calculated using
equation (1) and it does not need any normalization. In South Korea, after the threshold of
epidemic outbreak, Td(t) increases exponentially up to the time t* where Td(t) reaches the
value of 50 days. For t > t*, Td(t) remains constant showing the transition from exponential
to linear growth. In our investigation of the Covid-19 outbreak in Italian regions [30] we
have extracted both the time dependent reproduction number R(t) and the doubling time
Td(t) showing that the critical phase where, Rt ≈ 1 correspond with the doubling time
fluctuating in the range 50<Td(t)<100. This regime separates the exponential growth phase
(which is called supercritical), with Rt >1, from the phase with Rt<1 (which is called
subcritical). Therefore, the time width of the exponential growth regime giving the
9

Antonio Bianconi et al. Efficiency of Covid-19 Containment by Measuring Time Dependent Doubling Time

characteristic width of the dome of the Covid-19 positive case curve, can be measured by
the difference between the day T*, where Td reaches the value of 50 days, and the outbreak
threshold time t0. We have found the full time width of the epidemic dome to be 27 days for
China and 24 days for South Korea. Introducing a normalized scale, i.e., dividing the time
in the time axis by the full time width, both the normalized domes of N(t) and the
experimental Td(t) curves for China and South Korea fully overlap, providing evidence for
the characteristic behavior associated with the mandatory "contact tracing" LFT policy.
The key result of the data analysis is that the kink in the Td(t) curves, which separates the
near threshold regime from the arrested regime is only 13-14 days. The different value of
the s1 factor in the near threshold regime is due to the immediate activation of the LFT
policy with mandatory mobile contact tracing as requested by scientists and experts, [3,4]
which was adopted by policy makers in South Korea faster than in China.
The overlapping domes of the positive case curves in both countries shows also that both
the epidemic peak and its full time width at half maximum are strongly reduced by the LFT
policy with mandatory "contact tracing". In Table 1 we report the key parameters obtained
by the fits to unveil the physics of the time evolution of pandemic in the selected countries.
Panel (b) of Figure 2 shows that the time dependent doubling time Td(t) in Italy, Spain and
France, where Mandatory Full Lockdown (MFL) policy (without the mandatory "contact
tracing" LFT policy) was applied, fully overlap. In the near-threshold regime the values of
the doubling time are very similar and the three curves show the same kink, probing the
transition from the near-threshold to the arrested regime at the same moment, i.e., 27 days,
which has been used to normalize the time scale. On 102th day of the year (DoY) the
arrested regime in these countries was only at its early stage, but it shows similar s factors.
The time dependent doubling time for USA and UK that adopted later a more soft version of
the Lockdown stop and go LSG policy is plotted in panel (c) of Fig. 2. While scientists and
some policymakers asked their governments to activate as soon as possible containment
measures [5], but for some time policymakers of USA and UK have chosen to “do nothing”.
The effect has a clearly impact on the s1 factor as outlined by the flat Td(t) curve in the
10

Antonio Bianconi et al. Efficiency of Covid-19 Containment by Measuring Time Dependent Doubling Time

near-threshold regime showing a similar constant behavior for USA and UK with a very
large s1 factor.

Figure 3. Extrapolated time T* of the day of year (DoY) when the doubling time Td will reach 50
days Td(T*)=50, used to predict the time width of the supercritical epidemic regime t*=T*-t0 for LSG
countries, from data available on the 102th DoY. The quantitative test of the efficiency of one
containment policy versus another one is given by its ability i) to achieve a short time width t* and ii)
to reduce the number of fatalities in the same time period normalized to the population. Panel a) Plot
of the doubling time Td(t) as a function of time in the arrested regime for the epidemic spread in Italy,
France, Spain, UK and USA. The linear fit in the semi-log scale allows the prediction of the expected
day T* of the year when Td will be 50. The predicted time duration of the supercritical regime is
given by t*=T*-t0. Panel b) Plot of t* as a function of the success s2 factor. The lower panel shows
that both the s2 factor and t* in the LFT countries (data in the yellow area) are smaller than in LSG
countries (data in the blue area). The average value t*=24.8 days in countries where the LFT protocol
has been enforced is about a factor 2 lower than the average value t*=58.4 days in countries where
LSG protocol [8] has been followed in agreement with data in Fig. 2b. The upper panel (b) shows that
the normalized number of fatalities in 30 days per milion people in the countries which have adopted
the LSG protocol without mandatory mobile contact tracing are similar and their average, N30=82, it
is a factor 40 larger than the number N30=2 reached in the countries which have adopted the LFT
protocol with mandatory mobile contact tracing.

We have plotted in panel (a) of Figure 3 the exponential increase of the doubling time in the
arrested regime for all 5 investigated countries applying the LSG policy without the
mandatory "contact tracing" policy on 102th day of the year. From the extrapolation of the
line in the semi-log scale (as determined by the exponential curve of Td(t) in the arrested
regime) it is possible to predict the time duration of the supercritical phase showing the
exponential growth in all five countries which adopted the LSG policy.
The exponential growth is expected to enter in the critical regime when the doubling time
Td (t*) > 50 days, as shown for the case of South Korea in Fig. 1. However, it is not
possible to predict how long this critical regime will continue since the number of daily
new cases could show either large fluctuations, or could decrease or increase with a linear
rate, as it has occurred in South Korea for a long time.
The linear fit of the doubling time in the arrested regime Td(t) in the semi-log scale shown
in panel (a) of Fig. 3 for the five cases where the LSG policy was enforced: Italy, France,
Spain, UK and USA, allows us to predict the expected day T* of the year when Td will be
12

Antonio Bianconi et al. Efficiency of Covid-19 Containment by Measuring Time Dependent Doubling Time

50 (called DoY stop): 108 in Italy, 109 in Spain, 114 in France, 124 USA and 130 in UK
with the error bar of ~2 days. The time width t* of the epidemic dome in the positive case
curve in the LSG countries is given by the time difference t*=T*- t0, which is predicted to
be in the range 55-63 days as given in table 1, i.e., it is more than two times longer for
countries where the mandatory "contact tracing" LFT policy was not adopted. In Table 1
we have summarized the key numerical results based on data available on April 10th.
In lower panel of Fig. 3b we report the estimated time width t* of the Covid-19 epidemic
supercritical regime as a function of the s2 factor. The success s2 factor in countries which
enforced the LFT policy with mandatory "contact tracing" has been found to be in the range
5 < s2 < 7 while the s2 factor in countries which enforced the LFT policy without mandatory
"contact tracing" falls in the range (10 < s2 < 15).
The time width t* in the countries which have applied the LSG protocol proposed by the
group of Imperial College [8] without mandatory contact tracing is predicted to cluster
around the average value of 58.4 days in the blue area which is two times larger that the
average value 24.8 days in countries where the LFT protocol has been enforced in
agreement with the differences of the time width of the epidemic dome of the positive case
curve shown in Fig.2.
In order to evaluate quantitatively the efficiency of the different policies for taking care of
the health of the population in different countries it is necessary to calculate the number of
fatalities collected in the same time interval and normalized to the total number of country
population. On the 102 DoY we can analize all cumulative curves of the Covid-19 fatalities
of all studied countries in the same time interval covering only the first 30 days of the
epidemic spreading. In the upper panel of Fig. 3b we have plotted the fatalities in the first
30 days, divided by the number of inhabitants in different countries measured in millions as
a function of the s2 factor. The data from countries which have applied the Lockdown case
Finding mobile Tracing (LFT) policy with mandatory mobile tracking [13-15] occur in the
yellow region showing that they have achieved a both a lower s2 factor and a low number of
fatalities. The countries in the blue region, using the Lockdown Stop and Go (LSG)
protocol [8] with no mandatory mobile tracking, have achieved a s2 factor about two times

longer. Morever on April 10 the average number of normalized fatalities is 40 times higher
in all countries using the LSG protocol without mandatory contact tracing than in countries
usong the LFT protocol with mandatory contact tracing.

3. Validation of predictions and evaluation of containtment protocols
On June 25th 2020, in the course the peer review process of this paper, we have been invited
to check our results by analysis of new available data of the Covid-19 epidemic spreading.
The available data on the 177th DoY of 2020 allow us to make a comparative evaluation of
the efficiency of both LFT and LSG containtment protocols in the same time range, 100 days,
covering the full dome of the positive case curve and to validate the accuracy of predictions
based on data covering only the first 15 days or the first 30 days [13,14]. The time evolution
of the doubling time in the first 100 days from the outbreak time threshold are shown in panel
(a) of Fig. 4 for countries folowing the LFT protocol and in panel (b) of Fig. 4 for countries
folowing the LSG protocol. The supercritical phase, characterized by the exponential growth
of epidemic following the explosion of the outbreak, which occurs for t<t* where Td(t)<50d
[30] is indicated by the red area. The the yellow area, where 50 d <Td(t)< 100 d, indicates the
critical regime. The time duration of the supercritical phase is much shorter, i.e., 24<t*<27
days as shown in panel (a) for LFT countries, than in LSG countries, which is 52<t*<78 days
as shown in panel (b). The time width of the supercritical regime has been much longer than
predicted in Fig. 3 for UK and USA. The success s2 factor, measured in the supercritical
regime for the LSG countries, is in the range 11<s2<24 (in the blue area of panel b). It is
larger than predicted in Fig. 3 and it is much higher than in the LFT countries, in the range
5<s2<7 (panel a).
On the 177 DoY it is possible to analize the cumulative curves of the Covid-19 fatalities of
all studied countries in the same time interval of 100 days, covering the full width of the
epidemic wave. The impact of different containment policies on the population has been
measured by the relation between the number of fatalities in the first 100 days of Covid-19
epidemic spread per milion people (N100) and the s2 factor shown in panel (c) of Fig. 4. The
s2 factors and the number of fatalities N100 are reported in Table 2.

Figure 4. The analysis of data available on the 177th DoY have allowed us to measure the time
dependent doubling time Td(t) in the first 100 days after explosion of the national outbreaks covering
the time full width of the epidemic dome in the supercritical regime. Panel a) shows the curves Td(t)
in countries which adopted the LFT protocol with mandatory mobile contact tracing. Panel b) shows
the curves Td(t) in countries which adopted the LSG protocol without mandatory mobile contact
tracing. The supercritical regime indicated by the red area, characterized by the exponential growth
of Covid-19 epidemic following the explosion of the outbreak occurs for t<t* where Td(t)<50d. The
time t* where Td(t*)=50d is assigned to the transition from the supercritical regime to the critical
regime (yellow area) which occurs in the range 50d<Td(t)<100d. The subcritical regime (blue area)
occurs where Td(t)>100d. The success s2 factor measured in the supercritical regime is in the range
11<s2<24 in the LSG countries (panel b) while is much smaller in the range 5<s2<7 (panel a) for the
LFT countries. The duration t* of the supercritical regime is in the range 52<t*<78 days, with the
average value <t*>=64.8 days, in LSG countries, (panel b) to be compared with 24<t*<27 days in
LFT countries. Panel c) shows the time duration t* of the supercritical regime (lower panel) and the
number of fatalities in the first 100 days per million people (upper panel) as a function of the s2
factor. The lower panel shows that both the s2 factor and the t* in the LFT countries (yellow area) are
shorter than in LSG countries (blue area). The upper panel shows that the normalized average
number of fatalities in 100 days over the full dome of the epidemics is about 129 times higher in
countries where LSG protocol [8] has been enforced (N100=502) than in countries where the LFT
protocol has been enforced (N100=42).

Qualitative predictions made in and predictions made on April 10 (see panel (b) in Fig. 3)
are confirmed. The upper panel of Fig. 4c shows the number of fatalities (N100) in the first
100 days per million people as a function of the s2. The results based on data collected on

the June 25th in panel (c) of Fig.4 confirm qualitatiely the predictions made on March 15
[14-15] and April 10th which are shown in Panel (c) of Fig. 3.

Td(T*) has reached the value of 50 days; Td(T*)=50 d; c) the measured time interval t*=T*-t0 of the

million people (normalized to the country population) during the first 100 days of the national outbreak of
each country.

All results confirm that a lower s-factor is correlated with both short duration of the
supercritical epidemic regimne and a lower number of fatalities. At the end of the first
pandemic wave the duration of the supercritical phase has been between 2 and 3 times
longer using the LSG protocol than using the LFT protocol. The normalized number of
fatalities has been about 120 higher in countries that applied the LSG protocol proposed by
the Ferguson team at the Imperial College [8] than in countries that applied the LFT
protocol with mandatory contact tracing. The LSG protocol guarantees privacy, but the data
show that it provides a poor public health care since the number of Covid-19 fatalities has
been a factor 120 times higher using the LSG protocol than the LFT protocol using
mandatory mobile contact tracing.

4. Conclusions
In this work we have extracted the time evolution of both the doubling time Td(t) and
the success s-factor, by analysis of available data of Covid-19 epidemic in seven countries
where different containment policies have been applied. The key result of this work has
been to unveil the presence in the same dome of the positive case curve of two statistical
different regimes during the exponential growth: i) the stretched near threshold growth
phase and ii) the arrested phase.
The two phases show two exponential functions of Td(t) versus time separated by a
kink, characterized by two time exponents s1 and s2. These success s-factors are used to
quantify the efficacy and success of the different mitigation methods. They could and
should be used in the future to monitor with accuracy and in a quick way, possible
rebounds of this pandemic, but it is also valid for a future pandemic (if any).
We clearly show that countries that selected and adopted advanced technologies [13,14,15]
i.e., the containment policy Lockdown, case Finding, mobile Tracing (LFT) with mandatory
"mobile contact tracing" have been able to reduce both the peak and the width of the
epidemic dome of the daily positive case curve of the Covid-19. The reduction of the time
duration of the lockdown as obtained by mandatory "contact tracing" has minimized the
impact on the economy [10] keeping the manufacture close for a shorter time. The number
of fatalities per million people over 100 days, covering the full width of the first wave, has
been more than a factor 100 smaller than in the countries, which have not used mandatory
mobile contact tracing.
Finally, we have shown in this work that the proposed use [13,14,31] of the time
dependent doubling time plots for early warning on the epidemic spread rate gives reliable
predictions in particular in the early stage of the epidemic spreading. Therefore, the
proposed method can be considered useful to predict the time evolution of future epidemic
outbreaks. This approach represents a fundamental advantage compared to the standard
analysis of the Covid-19 epidemic and supports the theory of fractal statistics or new
complex statistics of epidemic spread [12,19]. In this study, based on data published on the
17

Antonio Bianconi et al. Efficiency of Covid-19 Containment by Measuring Time Dependent Doubling Time

102th day of the year for the epidemic growth in action in Italy, France, Spain, UK and USA
we predicted (see panel (c) in Fig. 3) the end of the dome of the positive case curve for each
country on the day of the year reported in Table 1 within the indeterminacy of a couple of
days. The results have been validated in Figure 4 and Table 2 covering the first 100 days of
the Covid-19 epidemic in different countries. All predictions have been validated by data
available on the 177th DoY and a quantitative comparative valuation of different protocols
used for Covid-19 containtment have been obtained. Finally, we hope that this original
approach will be of help to understand epidemiology of Covid-19 and for policymakers that
are now well informed [31] how to save lives and reduce fatality numbers by two orders of
magnitude in a second wave of Covid-19 or for a future pandemic.
