ABSTRACT

1

Since its outbreak, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented losses to human lives and economies around the world.
As of 18th July 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) has
reported more than 13 million confirmed cases including close to
600,000 deaths across 216 countries and territories. Despite several
government measures, India has gradually moved up the ranks to
become the third worst-hit nation by the pandemic after the US and
Brazil, thus causing widespread anxiety and fear among her citizens.
As majority of the world’s population continues to remain confined
to their homes, more and more people have started relying on social media platforms such as Twitter for expressing their feelings
and attitudes towards various aspects of the pandemic. With rising
concerns of mental well-being, it becomes imperative to analyze
the dynamics of public affect in order to anticipate any potential
threats and take precautionary measures. Since affective states of
human mind are more nuanced than meager binary sentiments,
here we propose a deep learning-based system to identify people’s
emotions from their tweets. We achieve competitive results on two
benchmark datasets for multi-label emotion classification. We then
use our system to analyze the evolution of emotional responses
among Indians as the pandemic continues to spread its wings. We
also study the development of salient factors contributing towards
the changes in attitudes over time. Finally, we discuss directions
to further improve our work and hope that our analysis can aid in
better public health monitoring.

The coronavirus disease 2019, or the COVID-19, caused by the
SARS-Cov-2 virus, has subsequently taken the shape of a pandemic
since it’s outbreak in late December 2019, causing enormous losses
to societies and economies around the world [12]. Although the
enforcement of several protective measures such as lockdown, social
distancing, etc. have had positive effects on containing the spread
of the virus, the loneliness caused by self-confinement and reduced
access to family, friends, and other social support systems have
caused severe psychological threats to the physical and mental wellbeing of people around the globe [2, 8, 10]. While dealing with such
unprecedented challenges, as more and more people express their
emotions and opinions towards various aspects of the pandemic
through social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, etc., it
becomes essential to monitor the dynamics of public affect from
such user-generated textual content in order to understand general
concerns and anticipate any potential threats.
Human-written texts such as tweets reflect an author’s affective
state or thought process. Although emotions and sentiments are
closely related, merely classifying the subjective content of a tweet
into positive, negative or neutral sentiment categories may not
be sufficient to understand a person’s true feelings. Under trying
situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic, emotions can be even
more complicated [23]. A person might feel optimistic about vaccine
development or thankful towards the doctors or even both while
still being positive. Therefore, in order to capture people’s emotions
from their tweets, we build a transformer-based [21] supervised
multi-label emotion classifier that achieves state-of-the-art results
on two benchmark datasets, AIT [19], and SenWave [23].
With record no. of cases being reported daily and more than 1 million confirmed cases to date, India has now become the third worsthit nation by the pandemic after the US and Brazil. We, therefore
use our classifier, trained on COVID-19-specific SenWave dataset,
to monitor the evolution of emotional attitudes among Indians towards the ongoing pandemic by analyzing tweets posted between
March 1st 2020 and July 5th 2020. We also study the development
of salient factors or triggers contributing towards the changes in
emotions over time. We hope that our proposed system can aid the
concerned authorities in real-time identification of peoples’ mental
health conditions and concerns from their social media posts and
make timely interventions in fighting the global crisis.

RELATED WORK

Studies based on social media data around the COVID-19 pandemic
have seen a steep surge over the past few months. Prior works
[1, 13, 14] have stressed the need for automatic detection and monitoring of public affects from user-generated content, especially
during trying times such as the current pandemic. Although recent
benchmark annotated datasets [5, 18, 19] have facilitated the training and development of supervised deep learning-based classifiers
for automated sentiment analysis and emotion detection, their results are not directly applicable to COVID-19 analysis [23] due to
considerable differences in vocabulary between the training and
testing domains. Majority of recent works around COVID-19 such
as [11, 22] have thus relied on feature-engineering based methods or supervised methods with limited training data [12]. As the
pandemic continues to spread its wings, we draw our motivation
from [14, 19, 23] for building a multi-label emotion classifier and
studying the evolution of public emotions towards the COVID-19
from an Indian perspective, through the lens of Twitter.

DATASETS
• AIT : The Affect in Tweets Dataset (or AIT for short) was
created in [19], as part of SemEval-2018 Task 1. This nonCOVID-19 dataset consists of 7724 English tweets, each labeled with either neutral or no emotion or one or more of
the 11 emotions, anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, love,
optimism, pessimism, sadness, surprise, and trust.
• SenWave : We consider the 10K English tweets from the
largest fine-grained annotated Covid-19 tweets dataset created by the authors in [23]. Here, each tweet is labeled with
one or more of the 10 emotions, optimistic, thankful, empathetic, pessimistic, anxious, sad, annoyed, denial (towards
conspiracy theories), official report, and joking.
• Twitter_IN : We use version 17 of the COVID-19 Twitter
chatter dataset released by the authors in [3]. Twitter_IN
consists of around 1.4 lac English tweets from India posted
between January 25th 2020 and July 4th 2020.

The version of SenWave, obtained from the authors, contains an
additional label surprise. Although we use all the 11 categories to
train our models, however, we leave out surprise (since not documented in [19]) and official (since not an affective state) from further
consideration while performing our analysis with Twitter_IN.

4 MODEL DESCRIPTION
4.1 Data Preprocessing
We preprocessed the raw tweets in all the datasets, first by removing
the mentions (@user), and URLs. We then filtered out noisy symbols such as "RT" (retweet). Since hashtags can provide meaningful
semantics, we removed the # from the #word and kept the word.
We used a mapping 1 between emoticons with their meanings and
the emoji2 package to respectively replace emoticons and emojis
appearing in the tweets with their semantic phrases. We then used
a slang_translator 3 to convert online slangs, commonly used in
1 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_emoticons/
2 https://pypi.org/project/emoji/
3 https://github.com/rishabhverma17/sms_slang_translator

Figure 1: Model Architecture
short text message conversations, into their actual phrases. For eg:
"CUL8R" gets replaced by "see you later". We further expand the
contractions using contractions4 . Finally, we filtered out punctuations, line breaks, tabs and redundant blank characters, etc. since
they do provide any relevant lexical or semantic information.

4.2

Architecture

We used RoBERTa-Base [15] as the backbone of our multi-label emotion classifier. A tweet t to be classified is first broken down by the
RobertaTokenizer into its constituent tokens. A special token [CLS]
is appended to obtain the final sequence [CLS], t 1 , t 2 , ..., tn , which is
then passed through 12 layers of attention-based transformers to obtain a 768-dimensional contextualized representation of the tweet,
hC LS . Motivated by prior works [19], we simultaneously obtain a
194-dimensional feature vector derived from affect lexicons using
Empath [7]. We append the two to obtain a 962-dimensional vector
which is then passed through a fully connected layer with 11 output
neurons. At each neuron, we use the tanh activation function with
a threshold of 0.33 to finally predict the presence/absence of one of
the 11 emotions. hereafter, we refer to this model as ECROBERTA .
A variant of our model with BERT-Base [6] as the backbone is
referred to as ECBERT . Among our non-BERT variants, ECCNN consists of five parallel 1-D convolutions, each with different kernel
sizes ranging from 2-6 and ReLU activation function, followed by
1-D max-pooling layers. All five outputs are merged to obtain a
single representation vector for the tweet. ECLSTM consists of a
single layer of unidirectional LSTM cells with 256 hidden units.
Hidden state from the last LSTM cell is considered as the tweet representation vector. For both the above models, the obtained tweet
vector is passed through a hidden layer consisting of 128 neurons
followed by a fully connected layer with 11 output neurons. Labels
at each neuron are predicted with sigmoid activation function.

5 RESULTS AND ANALYSIS
5.1 Evaluation Metrics
Apart from Macro-F1 and Micro-F1, both [19] and [23] consider
Jaccard Accuracy as the principle metric to evaluate the multi-label
accuracy of the models designed for multi-label emotion detection. [23] additionally considers Label Ranking average precision
(or LRAP), Hamming Loss, and a relaxed accuracy mesaure called
Weak Accuracy or just "Accurcay" to evaluate the models.

5.2

Multi-label Emotion Classification

Table 1 compares our results with those of the baselines for the task
of multi-label emotion classification when the models are trained
on the AIT dataset. An ablation study performed on ECCNN demonstrates the advantage of using richer word representations such
as Glove [20] over Word2Vec [17]. It further establishes the importance of using affect representations from text such as Empath
embeddings for sentiment analysis tasks. Among our non-BERT
variants, ECLSTM performs the best. We obtain our best results with
ECROBERTA , when trained end-to-end for 5 epochs with AdamW
optimizer [16] and a learning rate of 2e − 5. As observed, we comfortably outperform the scores of NTUA-SLP [4], which achieved
the top rank for this subtask as part of the SemEval 2018 Task 1.
With a better F1-Macro score, we narrowly surpass the results of
the current top-ranked system on the leaderboard for this subtask,
with the competition currently running in its post-evaluation phase.
As can be observed from Table 2, ECROBERTA , when trained on SenWave dataset further achieves state-of-the-art results on four out of
six metrics, including Jaccard Accuracy, when compared with [23].

5.3

The Evolution of Public Emotions and
Contributing Factors

Owing to the fact that there were only three reported cases of
COVID-19 in India before March 2020, and there exist very few
tweets in Twitter_IN for the months of January and February, we
consider all tweets posted on or after Match 1st 2020 for our analysis.
We first use our ECROBERTA classifier, trained on SenWave dataset,
to predict the emotions for all tweets under consideration from

Figure 3: Count distribution of tweets containing a specific
emotion per 5000 tweets posted.

the Twitter_IN dataset. Few tweets with their predicted emotions
are listed in Table 3. Figure 2 shows the percentage distribution of
tweets, on a weekly basis, containing one or more from a total of
nine emotions. We observe that annoyed and thankful show contrasting trends. First and second peaks of annoyance correspond
with the declaration of nationwide lockdown and the Tablighi Jamaat gatherings respectively. Although, people initially showed
their gratitude towards the doctors and health workers for their
efforts in dealing with such unprecedented challenges, the sense
of thankfulness gradually declined as people started to feel more
helpless and anxious with growing no. of cases each day. Here, we
highlight that the no. of tweets posted greatly varies across weeks.
In Figure 3, we therefore create unequal-sized bins, each however
containing exactly 5000 tweets (except the last one, which contains
around 4,300 tweets), and observe the trends for six most relevant
emotions. We observe that the trends of optimism and pessimism
complement each other well as people gradually start to adjust
themselves with the new normal of life.
In order to extract relevant factors or triggers affecting the public
sentiments and emotions over time, we make use of an unsupervised
autoencoder-based neural topic model ABAE as proposed by Rudian
He, et. al. in [9]. We separately run the ABAE algorithm with the
tweets of each of the six emotions captured in Table 4 and report

emotion are filtered and assigned meaningful sub-categories by
means of a many-to-many mapping. In Figure 4, we plot the trends
of the subcategories for annoyed (Fig. 4a) and optimism (Fig. 4b ).
In Fig. 4a, we observe a clear peak from March 28th 2020 to
April 8th 2020 due to the religious gatherings of a certain community, thereby triggering widespread criticism and hatred from
the public. In Fig. 4b, the plots show a high level of community
gratitude in general, with occasional peaks which may be attributed
to the events targeted at raising solidarity among the public. For
the technological measures, we see a gradual increase and a peak
near the launch date of the Arogya Setu App - developed by the
Indian Government to help our citizens in this pandemic.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK

To summarize, we first build a multi-label emotion classifier that
achieves state-of-the-art results on two benchmark datasets, AIT
(non-COVID) and SenWave (COVID-specific). We then use our
trained model to predict the emotions from India-specific tweets
posted between March 1st 2020 and July 4th 2020. Using these
predictions, we study the evolution of emotions among Indians
towards the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We further study the
development of salient factors contributing towards the changes in
attitudes and draw interesting inferences. In future, we would like
to extend our work with the Valence-Arousal-Dominance or VAD
model and take a multi-tasking approach to build our classifiers.
