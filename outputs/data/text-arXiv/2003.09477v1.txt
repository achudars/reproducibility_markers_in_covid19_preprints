Abstract. The goal of this note is to present a simple mathematical model
with two parameters for the number of deaths due to the corona (COVID-19)
virus. The model only requires basic knowledge in differential calculus, and
can also be understood by pupils attending secondary school. The model can
easily be implemented on a computer, and we will illustrate it on the basis of
case studies for different countries.

1. Introduction
The corona (COVID-19) virus is currently a challenge for several countries of
the world. There are several recent articles, such as [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8], which provide
mathematical models. The goal of this note is to present a rather simple mathematical model for the evolution of the corona virus, where we merely concentrate on
the number of deaths due to the corona virus. However, from adequate predictions
of these numbers of deaths, we will also obtain estimates for the number of infected
people and for the probability that an individual of a population is infected at a
certain time point. The mathematical model is intended to be simple enough such
that practitioners can use it in order to compute different scenarios for the future.
Even pupils attending secondary school with basic knowledge in differential calculus
should be able to understand the model.
The remainder of this note is organized as follows. In Section 2 we have a look
at the data from China, and use this data in order to motivate the mathematical
properties of our model. Afterwards, in Section 3 we present the mathematical
model. In Section 4 we perform the fitting procedure of the parameters for our
model using the data from China. In Section 5 we look at the data from Italy and
make predictions for the number of deaths according to our model, and make some
concluding remarks regarding the situation in other countries. All data which we
use in this note are taken from [7], and all plots in this note are generated using R.
2. A look at the data from China
In order to motivate our model, let us perform an empirical investigation of Chinese data. So far, China is the only country which has essentially already overcome
the corona crisis, and where the numbers of deaths due to the corona virus are stabilizing. Figure 1 shows the numbers of deaths in China from January 22 to March
19, with linear and logarithmic scale.
Although these data are only available on a daily basis, we assume that the
number of deaths is a function D : [t1 , ∞) → [1, ∞) defined on an interval, where
t1 is the first day when deaths due to the corona virus are observed. Then we can
write the number of deaths as
D(t) = exp(L(t)),

Figure 1. These two plots show the numbers of deaths in China
from January 22 to March 19; in the left plot with the usual linear
scale, and in the right plot with logarithmic scale.
where L : [t1 , ∞) → R+ is the logarithm. With this notation, the function D
appears in the left plot of Figure 1, and the function L appears in the right plot of
Figure 1. Having a closer look at Figure 1, we make the following observations:
(1) The function L is strictly increasing and continuous, in fact even continuously differentiable. As a consequence, the function D is strictly increasing
and continuously differentiable as well.
(2) The function L is concave on the whole domain [t1 , ∞).
(3) There is time point T1 at which the curvature of D changes. Namely, the
function D is convex on [t1 , T1 ] and concave on [T1 , ∞). The time point T1
is the time where governmental measures start to become effective. Since
an infected person who dies, will die around 17 days after infection, in our
model the time point T1 is 17 days after the governmental measures.
(4) The limit L(∞) := limt→∞ L(t) exists. As a consequence, the limit D(∞) :=
limt→∞ D(t) exists as well. This means that the number of deaths stabilizes,
and indicates that the corona crisis is essentially overcome.
3. Presentation of the model
Bases on the empirical observations from Section 2, we will now present our
model for the number of deaths. As suggested in the previous section, we consider
a function D : [t1 , ∞) → [1, ∞). Typically we choose t1 = 1, the first day when
deaths due to the corona virus are observed. Then we can write the number of
deaths as
D(t) = exp(L(t)),

t ∈ [t1 , ∞),

where L : [t1 , ∞) → R+ is the logarithm. Let T1 ∈ [t1 , ∞) be the time point where
governmental measures begin to show consequences. As already discussed, this is
typically 17 days after the governmental measures. Let (t1 , . . . , tn ) be a vector of
time points for which the numbers of deaths (d1 , . . . , dn ) are available from data.
We assume that tn ≤ T1 , and denote by (l1 , . . . , ln ) the corresponding logarithms
li := ln(di ),

i = 1, . . . , n.

Now, we introduce the function L : [t1 , ∞) → R+ as follows:
(1) On the interval [t1 , T1 ] we define

β
t − t1
L(t) := l1 + (ln − l1 ) ·
, t ∈ [t1 , T1 ]
tn − t1

A SIMPLE MATHEMATICAL MODEL FOR THE CORONA VIRUS

for some constant β ∈ (0, 1], the concavity parameter. Then we have L(t1 ) =
l1 and L(tn ) = ln , which means that the function L matches with the data
points at t1 and tn .
(2) On the interval (T1 , ∞) we define

L(t) := L(T1 ) + λ 1 − exp(−ν(t − T1 )) , t ∈ (T1 , ∞)
with parameters λ, ν > 0.
Then the following statements are true:
(1) The function L is strictly increasing and continuous.
(2) Computing the second order derivative of L, we see that the function L is
concave.
(3) Computing the second order derivative of D, we see that D is convex on
[t1 , T1 ] and concave on [T1 , ∞).
(4) The limit L(∞) := limt→∞ L(t) exists with
L(∞) = L(T1 ) + λ.
Therefore, the limit D(∞) := limt→∞ D(t) exists as well, and we have
D(∞) = D(T1 ) · exp(λ).
The only missing property is that so far the function L does not need to be continuously differentiable at T1 . For this, we require conditions on the parameters λ
and ν. We have

β−1
t − t1
ln − l1
·
, t ∈ [t1 , T1 ),
L0 (t) = β ·
tn − t1
tn − t1
and the left-hand derivative at T1 is given by
lim
h↓0

ln − l1
L(T1 ) − L(T1 − h)
=β·
·
h
tn − t1



T1 − t1
tn − t1

β−1
.

Moreover, we have
L0 (t) = λν · exp(−ν(t − T1 )),

t ∈ (T1 , ∞),

and the right-hand derivative at T1 is given by
lim
h↓0

L(T1 + h) − L(T1 )
= λν.
h

Therefore, the function L is continuously differentiable at T1 if and only if

β−1
T1 − t1
β ln − l1
ν= ·
·
(3.1)
.
λ tn − t1
tn − t1
Consequently, in our model we only specify the two parameters (β, λ), and then the
parameter ν is already determined by (3.1). The two parameters (β, λ) have the
following interpretations:
• The parameter β ∈ (0, 1] is the concavity parameter of L. If β = 1, then the
function L is linear. Otherwise, the function L is concave, and decreasing
the value of β results in increasing the concavity of the function L.
• The parameter λ > 0 determines how rigorous the governmental measures
are. As we have seen, the asymptotic number of deaths is given by
D(∞) = D(T1 ) · exp(λ).
Hence, small values of λ indicate rigorous governmental measures, whereas
large values of λ indicate only gentle governmental measures, with the consequence of a larger number of deaths in the long run.

So far, we have focused on the number of deaths D(t) due to the corona virus at
time t. Another quantity of interest is the number I(t) of people infected with the
corona virus at time t. It is well known that the official numbers are not realistic.
They are much too low, because the government is only aware of reported cases.
However, given the function D : [t1 , ∞) → [1, ∞) of the numbers of deaths, an
estimate for the number of infected people at time t is given by
D(t + 17)
.
I(t) =
µ·κ
Here µ ∈ (0, 1) is the mortality rate of infected people, and κ > 0 is a constant due
to cluster effects. Reasonable values are, for example µ = 0.01 and κ = 5. We refer,
for example, to the discussion in [2]. Considering the fractions
I(t)
,
n
where n denotes the size of the population, we also obtain estimates for the probabilities that at time t an individual is infected with the corona virus.
P (t) =

4. Estimates for Chinese data

In this section we come back to the data from China, and fit the parameters
(β, λ) in our model. The concavity parameter is estimated as β = 0.6, and the
parameter representing the rigorousness of governmental measures is estimated as
λ = ln(3.25).

Figure 2. This plot shows the numbers of deaths in China from
January 22 to March 19, together with the fitted function D.
Figure 2 shows the data points from Figure 1 together with a plot of the function
D with the fitted parameters (β, λ). The red curve shows the function D in the first
period [t1 , T1 ], where D proceeds convex, and the blue curve shows the function
D in the second period [T1 , ∞), where D proceeds concave and the numbers of
deaths begin to converge. In this model January 24 is considered as the date of
governmental measures, and hence the date T1 , where the curve changes from red
to blue, is February 10.
5. Estimates for data from Italy and other countries
As already pointed out, China is the only country which has essentially already
overcome the corona crisis. South Korea has already reached the second stage of
the corona crisis, and the numbers of deaths is comparatively low. Apart from that,

the remaining countries are just in the first period, and we can make predictions
of the numbers of deaths in the future. As an illustrating example, we consider the
data from Italy. Figure 3 shows the numbers of deaths due to the corona virus in
Italy from February 21 to March 19, with linear and logarithmic scale.

At first view, the right plot in Figure 3 looks linear, but actually we obtain the
concavity parameter β = 0.65. Since Italy is in the first stage of the corona crisis,
it is difficult to estimate the parameter λ concerning the effects of governmental
measures. However, since the measures are equally tight as those in China, it is
reasonable to take the same parameter λ = ln(3.25).

Figure 4. This plot shows a prediction of the numbers of deaths
in Italy from February 21 to April 30, together with the fitted
function D.
Figure 4 shows the available data points together with the predicted scenario
according to the estimated parameters (β, λ). The red curve shows the function D
in the first period [t1 , T1 ], and the blue curve shows the function D in the second
period [T1 , ∞). In this model March 11 is considered as the date of governmental
measures, and hence the date T1 , where the curve changes from red to blue, is
March 28. Additionally, the green curve shows the corresponding scenario with the
same parameters, but date T1 being March 25. As a consequence, in this model

governmental measures taking place three days earlier would bisect the number of
deaths in the long run. Of course, other scenarios with different values of λ can be
considered as well.
We can perform the same procedure with other countries. For example, for Iran,
Spain, Germany, USA, France, South Korea, Switzerland, United Kingdom, Netherlands and Belgium data are available. For most of the countries the concavity parameter is easy to fit; exceptions are USA and France (despite many data) as well
as countries for which so far only few data exists. Apart from South Korea, for
each country the concavity parameter β is larger than 0.6, which is the value for
China. However, typically the concavity parameter is less than one, which means
that the function L is really concave, and not linear. Two exceptions are Germany
and United Kingdom, where the current estimates are β = 1.
