Abstract
Presently, there are no approved drugs or vaccines to treat COVID-19 which has spread to over
200 countries and is responsible for over 3,65,000 deaths worldwide. Recent studies have shown
that two human proteases, TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L, play a key role in host cell entry of
SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, inhibitors of these proteases were shown to block SARS-CoV-2
infection. Here, we perform virtual screening of 14010 phytochemicals produced by Indian
medicinal plants to identify natural product inhibitors of TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L. We built a
homology model of TMPRSS2 as an experimentally determined structure is not available.
AutoDock Vina was used to perform molecular docking of phytochemicals against TMPRSS2
model structure and cathepsin L crystal structure. Potential phytochemical inhibitors were
filtered by comparing their docked binding energies with those of known inhibitors of TMPRSS2
and cathepsin L. Further, the ligand binding site residues and non-covalent protein-ligand
interactions were used as an additional filter to identify phytochemical inhibitors that either bind
to or form interactions with residues important for the specificity of the target proteases. We
have identified 96 inhibitors of TMPRSS2 and 9 inhibitors of cathepsin L among phytochemicals
of Indian medicinal plants. The top inhibitors of TMPRSS2 are Edgeworoside C, Adlumidine
and Qingdainone, and of cathepsin L is Ararobinol. Interestingly, several herbal sources of
identified phytochemical inhibitors have antiviral or anti-inflammatory use in traditional
medicine. Further ​in vitro ​and ​in vivo​ testing is needed before clinical trials of the promising
phytochemical inhibitors identified here.

1. Introduction
In December 2019, a new respiratory disease with unknown cause was first reported in Wuhan,
China with clinical symptoms of fever, cough, shortness of breath, fatigue and pneumonia
(Huang et al., 2020; C. Wang et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020)​. While most cases of this new disease
show mild to moderate symptoms, a small fraction of cases, especially those with comorbid
conditions like diabetes and hypertension, can develop fatal conditions such as acute respiratory

2

distress syndrome (ARDS) due to severe lung damage ​(Chan et al., 2020)​. In January 2020, a
novel betacoronavirus, initially named 2019-nCoV, was discovered to be the etiological agent of
this new disease ​(Huang et al., 2020; C. Wang et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020)​. Subsequently,
human-to-human transmission of this disease was confirmed ​(Chan et al., 2020)​. By 30 January
2020, the 2019-nCoV had spread to more than 20 countries and the world health organization
(WHO) declared a public health emergency of international concern. On 11 February 2020, the
international committee on taxonomy of viruses permanently named 2019-nCoV as severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the WHO named the associated disease
as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). By 11 March 2020, COVID-19 had spread to more
than 150 countries across 6 continents and the WHO upgraded the status of the epidemic to
pandemic. As of 30 May 2020, the number of laboratory confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths
have already surpassed 6 million and 3,65,000, respectively, with the worst affected countries as
USA, UK, Italy, France, Spain and Brazil (​https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/​). In
short, the COVID-19 pandemic poses an unprecedented public health and economic threat to
humankind.
Coronaviruses are enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses with large
viral genomes. The publication of SARS-CoV-2 genome in January 2020 led to its taxonomic
classification into the family ​Coronaviridae​ and genus ​Betacoronavirus​ ​(Huang et al., 2020; C.
Wang et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020)​. Bats are natural reservoirs of coronaviruses ​(W. Li et al.,
2005)​. The SARS-CoV-2 genome shares 96% nucleotide identity with bat coronavirus RaTG13,
which suggests a probable zoonotic transfer to humans via an intermediate animal host ​(Zhou et
al., 2020)​. Prior to SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, there are two precedences of zoonotic transfer of
betacoronaviruses to humans, namely the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
(SARS-CoV) and the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which had
also led to outbreaks of severe respiratory disease ​(de Wit et al., 2016)​. In 2002-2003,
SARS-CoV emerged in China and led to 8098 infections and 774 deaths across the world ​(de
Wit et al., 2016)​. Interestingly, the SARS-CoV-2 genome shares ~80% nucleotide identity with
SARS-CoV ​(Huang et al., 2020; C. Wang et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020)​. In 2012, MERS-CoV
emerged in Saudi Arabia and led to 2521 infections and 866 deaths that were largely limited to

3

middle eastern countries ​(de Wit et al., 2016)​. Unlike SARS and MERS, the geographic spread
of COVID-19 and the ensuing mortality is significantly higher. To date, there are no approved
antiviral drugs or vaccines against betacoronavirus infections including COVID-19 ​(G. Li & De
Clercq, 2020)​. Hence, the current measures to contain COVID-19 include social distancing,
aggressive testing, patient isolation, contact tracing and travel restrictions. In present
circumstances, an immediate goal of biomedical research is to develop antivirals or anti-COVID
therapeutics for SARS-CoV-2 ​(G. Li & De Clercq, 2020)​.
The SARS-CoV-2 genome comprises ~30000 bases with 14 open reading frames (ORFs)
coding for 27 proteins ​(A. Wu et al., 2020)​. The genome organization of SARS-CoV-2 is similar
to other betacoronaviruses with the 5’-region coding for non-structural proteins and the 3’-region
coding for structural proteins. Important structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 coded by the
3’-region include the spike (S) surface glycoprotein, the envelope (E) protein, the matrix (M)
protein and the nucleocapsid (N) protein ​(A. Wu et al., 2020)​. The 5’-region of the SARS-CoV-2
genome contains the replicase gene which codes for two overlapping polyproteins, pp1a and
pp1ab, which are proteolytically cleaved by two important non-structural proteins,
3-chymotrypsin like protease (3CL​pro​) and papain-like protease (PL​pro​), to produce functional
(non-structural) proteins. Other important non-structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 for the viral
life cycle include the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and helicase. Accordingly, the 4
non-structural proteins, 3CL​pro​, PL​pro​, RdRp and helicase, along with the spike glycoprotein of
SARS-CoV-2 are among the most attractive targets for anti-COVID drugs ​(G. Li & De Clercq,
2020)​.
Rather than targeting important SARS-CoV-2 proteins for viral life cycle, an alternative
approach to anti-COVID drugs involves targeting host factors key to SARS-CoV-2 infection ​(G.
Li & De Clercq, 2020)​. For host cell entry, SARS-CoV-2 employs the spike (S) protein whose
S1 subunit has a receptor binding domain (RBD) that specifically recognizes the cell surface
receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) ​(Hoffmann, Kleine-Weber, et al., 2020; Ou et
al., 2020; Shang, Wan, et al., 2020; Shang, Ye, et al., 2020; Yan et al., 2020)​. Notably, both
SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV employ ACE2 as the cell entry receptor ​(Hoffmann,

4

Kleine-Weber, et al., 2020; Ou et al., 2020; Shang, Wan, et al., 2020; Shang, Ye, et al., 2020;
Yan et al., 2020)​. After attachment of S protein to ACE2 receptor, the membrane fusion of virus
and host cell depends on proteolytic activation of S protein by host proteases which involves
cleavage of S1 subunit at S1/S2 and S2’ sites resulting in dissociation of S1 subunit and
structural change in S2 subunit of S protein ​(Hoffmann, Kleine-Weber, et al., 2020; Ou et al.,
2020; Shang, Wan, et al., 2020; Shang, Ye, et al., 2020; Yan et al., 2020)​. Hoffmann ​et al
(Hoffmann, Kleine-Weber, et al., 2020)​ showed that the host cell proteases, Transmembrane
Protease Serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and cathepsin B or cathepsin L, can carry out S protein priming
required for SARS-CoV-2 entry. Hoffmann​ et al​ ​(Hoffmann, Kleine-Weber, et al., 2020)​ also
showed that TMPRSS2 is more essential for S protein priming and SARS-CoV-2 entry. In
parallel, Ou ​et al (​ Ou et al., 2020)​ used specific inhibitors of cathepsin L and cathepsin B to
show that cathepsin L rather than cathepsin B is essential for S protein priming of SARS-CoV-2
and membrane fusion in lysosomes. These studies highlight at least two alternate pathways for
host cell entry of SARS-CoV-2. On the one hand, after SARS-CoV-2 attachment to ACE2, the
membrane fusion and cytoplasmic entry can occur at the plasma membrane provided the cell
surface protease TMPRSS2 is available to carry out S protein priming ​(Hoffmann,
Kleine-Weber, et al., 2020; Ou et al., 2020; Shang, Wan, et al., 2020)​. On the other hand, after
SARS-CoV-2 attachment to ACE2, the virus can be internalized as part of endosomes in the
endocytic pathway, and later, the membrane fusion and cytoplasmic entry will occur in
lysosomes provided the lysosomal protease cathepsin L is available to carry out S protein
priming ​(Hoffmann, Kleine-Weber, et al., 2020; Ou et al., 2020; Shang, Wan, et al., 2020)​.
Depending on the target cell and associated expression of host cell proteases, SARS-CoV-2 may
use one of the alternative pathways for host cell entry ​(Hoffmann, Kleine-Weber, et al., 2020; Ou
et al., 2020; Shang, Wan, et al., 2020)​. Importantly, the above-mentioned studies also showed
that known inhibitors of TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L can block or significantly reduce the host
cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 ​(Hoffmann, Kleine-Weber, et al., 2020; Ou et al., 2020; Shang, Wan,
et al., 2020)​. In conclusion, human proteases TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L are key factors for host
cell entry and are important targets for anti-COVID drugs ​(Hoffmann, Kleine-Weber, et al.,
2020; Ou et al., 2020; Shang, Wan, et al., 2020; Hoffmann, Schroeder, et al., 2020)​.

To expedite this search for anti-COVID drugs, several computational studies have used
homology modeling or published crystal structures of SARS-CoV-2 proteins, molecular docking
and diverse small molecule libraries, to predict potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 proteins
including among existing approved drugs for repurposing and natural compounds (see e.g.
(Elfiky, 2020; Islam et al., 2020; Shah et al., 2020; C. Wu et al., 2020)​). In comparison, fewer
computational studies ​(Rahman et al., 2020; C. Wu et al., 2020)​ have focussed on identification
of potential inhibitors of host factors. In this work, we perform virtual screening of a large
phytochemical library specific to Indian medicinal plants to identify potential natural product
inhibitors of TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L.
Plant-based natural products have made immense contributions to drug discovery
(Newman & Cragg, 2012)​. Specifically, ~ 40% of the small-molecule drugs approved to date by
the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are either natural products or natural product
derivatives. Recently, there are reports from China of successful use of traditional Chinese
medicine and associated herbs in treatment of COVID-19 patients ​(Ren et al., 2020)​. On similar
lines, there have been suggestions to tap the rich legacy of traditional Indian medicine and
information on phytochemicals of Indian herbs in the search for anti-COVID drugs ​(Vellingiri et
al., 2020)​. Previously, some of us have built IMPPAT, the largest resource to date on
phytochemicals of Indian herbs ​(Mohanraj et al., 2018)​. In this work, we perform molecular
docking using a large library of 14010 phytochemicals compiled mainly from IMPPAT to
identify potential natural product inhibitors of TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1 Phytochemical library and drug-likeness evaluation
Previously, some of us have built the Indian Medicinal Plants, Phytochemicals And
Therapeutics (IMPPAT) database ​(Mohanraj et al., 2018)​ which is the largest resource on
phytochemicals of Indian herbs to date. For this study, we compiled a ligand library of 14011
phytochemicals by augmenting the information in IMPPAT ​(Mohanraj et al., 2018)​ with
additional information compiled from other literature sources ​(Rastogi, 1990, 1991, 1993, 1995,
6

1998; ​The Wealth of India,​ 2000a; ​The Wealth of India​, 2000b; ​The Wealth of India,​ 2000c; ​The
Wealth of India,​ 2000d; ​The Wealth of India​, 2000e)​. Thereafter, the widely-used drug-likeness
measure, Lipinski's rule of five (RO5) ​(Lipinski et al., 2001)​, was employed to filter the potential
drug-like molecules within the ligand library of 14011 phytochemicals. Specifically, 10510
phytochemicals passed the R05 drug-likeness filter. We then retrieved the three-dimensional
(3D) structures of these phytochemicals from Pubchem ​(Kim et al., 2019)​. Next the 3D
structures of the drug-like phytochemicals were energy-minimized using ​obminimize ​within the
OpenBabel toolbox ​(O’Boyle et al., 2011)​. Finally, the energy-minimized 3D structures of
ligands in .sdf format were converted to .pdb format using OpenBabel.
2.2 Homology modeling of TMPRSS2 structure
TMPRSS2 is a trypsin-like serine protease whose catalytic site consists of the triad
Ser441 (S441), His296 (H296) and Asp345 (D345) ​(Paoloni-Giacobino et al., 1997)​. It is well
established that trypsin-like serine proteases cleave peptide bonds following positively charged
amino acid residues such as arginine or lysine, and this specificity of the enzyme is determined
by a negatively charged aspartate residue located at the bottom of its S1 pocket ​(Evnin et al.,
1990)​. In TMPRSS2, this specificity is determined by the conserved negatively charged residue
Asp435 (D435) at the bottom of the S1 pocket ​(Paoloni-Giacobino et al., 1997)​.
To date the 3D structure of TMPRSS2 has not been experimentally determined, and thus,
we have used SWISS-MODEL ​(Waterhouse et al., 2018)​ webserver
(​https://swissmodel.expasy.org/interactive​) to perform homology modeling of TMPRSS2. We
submitted the TMPRSS2 protein sequence (NCBI reference sequence NP_005647.3) to
SWISS-MODEL and selected the crystal structure of human protein hepsin (PDB 1Z8G) ​(Herter
et al., 2005)​ as the template to build the model structure (Figure 1a). Note that hepsin is also a
Type II transmembrane trypsin-like serine protease, and it shares 38% sequence similarity with
TMPRSS2 (Figure 1b). Subsequently, UCSF Chimera ​(Pettersen et al., 2004)​ was used to
minimize the energy of the TMPRSS2 model structure obtained from SWISS-MODEL.
Thereafter, the energy-minimized TMPRSS2 model structure was assessed using the structure
assessment tool within SWISS-MODEL. In the TMPRSS2 model, 94.19% of the amino acid

7

residues were found to be in the Ramachandran favoured regions in the Ramachandran plot
(Figure 1c) and the model structure has a MolProbity ​(Chen et al., 2010)​ score of 1.50.
2.3 Protein structure of cathepsin L
We use the crystal structure (PDB 5MQY) ​(Kuhn et al., 2017)​ of human cathepsin L with
1.13 Å resolution obtained from Protein Data Bank for virtual screening. UCSF Chimera was
used to minimize the energy of the cathepsin L structure. Figure 2 displays the cathepsin L
structure with important residues in S1, S2 and S1’ subsites of the enzyme ​(Fujishima et al.,
1997)​. Previous research has also revealed that S1 and S2 subsites of cathepsin L are important
for the specificity of the enzyme ​(Fujishima et al., 1997; Vito Turk et al., 2012)​. In cathepsin L,
the catalytic site consists of Cys25 (C25) and His163 (H163) in the S1 subsite, and Trp189
(W189) is at the center of the S1’ subsite ​(Fujishima et al., 1997)​ (Figure 2). In cathepsin L, the
S2 subsite with important residues Asp162 (D162), Met161 (M161), Ala135 (A135), Met70
(M70) and Leu69 (L69) forms a deep hydrophobic pocket, and lastly, the conserved residue
Gly68 (G68) is at the center of the S3 subsite ​(Adams-Cioaba et al., 2011; Fujishima et al., 1997)
(Figure 2).

the conserved residue Gly68 (G68) in the S3 subsite of the enzyme.
2.4 Molecular Docking
AutoDock Vina ​(Trott & Olson, 2010)​ was used to perform the molecular docking of
energy-minimized 3D structures of ligands with energy-minimized structure of target proteins.
Accordingly, the 3D structures of prepared ligands in .pdb format were converted to .pdbqt
format using the python script ​prepare_ligand4.py ​from AutoDockTools ​(Morris et al., 2009)​.
Similarly, the energy-minimized structure of TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L in .pdb format were
converted to .pdbqt format using the python script ​prepare_receptor4.py f​ rom AutoDockTools
(Morris et al., 2009)​.
For protein-ligand docking, the appropriate grid box specified by the search space centre
and search space size for TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L was manually determined by considering
the key residues in target proteins such as the catalytic residues and substrate binding residues,

10

which are important for the function and specificity of the considered proteases as reported in the
literature. For TMPRSS2, the grid box was defined by the search space centre (40.50, -6.00,
25.70) and search space size of 25Å x 25Å x 25Å. For cathepsin L, the grid box was defined by
the search space centre (55.06, 48.65, 18.12) and search space size of 25Å x 25Å x 25Å.
For both target proteins, the molecular docking of prepared ligands was performed using
AutoDock Vina with the exhaustiveness set as 8. The top conformation of the docked ligand with
lowest binding energy, i.e. the best docked pose, was obtained from the output of AutoDock
Vina using the associated script ​vina_split.​ Subsequently, a combined structure file in .pdb
format of the docked protein-ligand complex (with ligand in the best docked pose) was prepared
using a custom script and pdb-tools ​(Rodrigues et al., 2018)​.
2.5 Identification of Protein-Ligand interactions
We searched the combined structure file of the docked protein-ligand complex for ligand
binding residues in protein and different non-covalent interactions that can facilitate the binding
of the ligand with the protein. These non-covalent protein-ligand interactions were identified
using different geometric criteria which are specific to different types of interactions.
Binding site residue.​ Ligand binding site residues are defined as amino acids in protein
which have at least one non-hydrogen atom in the proximity of at least one non-hydrogen atom
of the ligand. The distance cut off to determine this proximity between non-hydrogen atoms of
protein and ligand is taken to be the sum of their van der Waals radius plus 0.5Å ​(Schmidt et al.,
2011)​.
Hydrogen bonds​. The accepted geometric criteria for hydrogen bonds of type D-H···A are
as follows. Firstly, the distance between the hydrogen (H) and acceptor (A) atom should be less
than the sum of their van der Waals radii. Secondly, the angle formed by donor (D), H and A
atoms should be > 90° (Supplementary Figure S1a). Moreover, carbon (C), nitrogen (N), oxygen
(O) or sulfur (S) atoms can be donors while N, O or S atoms can be acceptors ​(Sarkhel &
Desiraju, 2004; Zhou et al., 2009)​.

11

Chalcogen bonds.​ In contrast to hydrogen bonds, chalcogen bonds are of type C-Y···A,
where Y can be a S or selenium (Se) atom and A can be a N, O or S atom. The accepted
geometric criteria for chalcogen interactions are as follows. Firstly, the distance between Y and
A should be less than the sum of their van der Waals radii. Secondly, the angle formed by the
triad, that is ∠C-Y···A, should lie in the range 150° to 180° (Supplementary Figure S1b) ​(Kříž et
al., 2018)​.
Halogen bonds​. Halogen bonds are of type C-Y···A-B, where halogen Y can be a
Fluorine (F), Chlorine (Cl), Bromine (Br) or Iodine (I) atom and A can be a N, O or S atom. The
formation of the halogen bond is favoured when the distance between Y and A is ≤ 3.7 Å and
the angle θ​1 of the A atom relative to the C-Y bond, and the angle θ​2 of the halogen Y relative to
the A-B bond should be ≥ 90° (Supplementary Figure S1c) ​(Borozan & Stojanović, 2013)​.
𝝅​-​𝝅 stacking​. This interaction occurs between two aromatic rings and can be majorly
classified into two types, namely, face-to-face and face-to-edge. In the case of face-to-face type
of 𝝅​-​𝝅 ​interaction, the distance between the centroids of the two participating aromatic rings
should be < 4.4 Å and the angle between their ring planes should be < 30°. In the case of
face-to-edge type of 𝝅​-​𝝅 ​interaction, the distance between the centroids of the two participating
aromatic rings should be < 5.5 Å and the angle formed by the ring planes should be in the range
60° to 120° (Supplementary Figure S1d,e).
Hydrophobic interactions.​ The geometric criteria for the formation of hydrophobic
interactions between atoms in protein and ligand are as follows ​(Ferreira de Freitas & Schapira,
2017)​. The distance between a carbon atom in protein or ligand and a carbon, halogen or sulfur
atom in ligand or protein, respectively, should be ≤ 4 Å. Furthermore, we ensure that the
involved atoms in a hydrophobic interaction between protein and ligand do not form hydrogen,
chalcogen or halogen bonds between them ​(Ferreira de Freitas & Schapira, 2017)​.
In order to detect the above-mentioned protein-ligand interactions, an in-house Python
program was written to enable batch processing of combined structure files containing docked
protein-ligand complexes for our large phytochemical library.

12

2.6 Comparison with reference inhibitors of TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L
In order to identify potent phytochemical inhibitors of target proteins, we decided to
compare the binding energy of the best docked pose of ligands with binding energies of the best
docked pose of known inhibitors of TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L obtained from AutoDock Vina.
Recent experiments have shown that both camostat mesylate and nafamostat mesylate,
which are approved for human use in Japan, can block the TMPRSS2-dependent cell entry of
SARS-CoV-2 ​(Hoffmann, Kleine-Weber, et al., 2020; Hoffmann, Schroeder, et al., 2020)​. ​By
docking these two inhibitors to TMPRSS2 using AutoDock Vina with exhaustiveness set at 50,
the predicted binding energies of camostat and nafamostat was found to be -7.4 kcal/mol and
-8.5 kcal/mol, respectively. Supplementary Figures S2a,b show the best docked poses of
nafamostat and camostat with TMPRSS2, and it is seen that both molecules form hydrogen
bonds with the substrate binding residue D435. Importantly, ​in comparison to camostat mesylate,
nafamostat mesylate in a recent experiment was shown to inhibit the TMPRSS2-dependent cell
entry with 15-fold higher efficiency and an EC​50​ value in lower nanomolar range ​(Hoffmann,
Schroeder, et al., 2020)​, and thus, the docked binding energies of these two known inhibitors are
in line with experiments. ​Based on above observations, we decided on a stringent criteria of
docked binding energy ≤ -8.5 kcal/mol for screened ligands to be identified as potential
inhibitors of TMPRSS2.
Recent experiments have shown​ that the small molecules E-64d and ​PC-0626568
(SID26681509) can block the cathepsin L-dependent cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 ​(Hoffmann,
Kleine-Weber, et al., 2020; Ou et al., 2020; Shang, Wan, et al., 2020)​. Note that ​cathepsin L is
one of 11 cysteine cathepsin proteases encoded by the human genome, and the cathepsins share a
high sequence similarity to papain, a non-specific plant protease ​(V. Turk et al., 2001)​. E64-d is
a broad spectrum inhibitor which can inhibit proteases cathepsins B, H, L and calpain, while
PC-0626568​ is a specific inhibitor of cathepsin L ​(Ou et al., 2020)​. Moreover, a recent study ​(Ou
et al., 2020)​ used the specific inhibitor ​PC-0626568 ​of cathepsin L to conclude that cathepsin L
rather than cathepsin B is important for cell entry of SARS-CoV-2. As both cathepsin L and

13

cathepsin B are expressed in several mammalian tissues, ​it is important to ​design specific
inhibitors of cathepsin L ​(Fujishima et al., 1997; Vito Turk et al., 2012)​ ​to avoid any off target
toxicity. By docking these two known inhibitors to cathepsin L using AutoDock Vina with
exhaustiveness set at 50, the predicted binding energies of E-64d and PC-0626568 was found to
be -5.0 kcal/mol and -8.0 kcal/mol, respectively, ​and thus, the docked binding energies ​are in line
with known specificity of E-64d and PC-0626568 to cathepsin L ​[11]​. Supplementary Figures
S2c,d show the best docked poses of PC-0626568 and E-64d with cathepsin L. It is seen that
E-64d forms hydrogen bonds with both catalytic residues C25 and H163, whereas PC-0626568
forms a hydrogen bond with H163 and hydrophobic interaction with C25. Based on above
observations, we decided on a stringent criteria of docked binding energy ≤ -8.0 kcal/mol for
screened ligands to be identified as potential inhibitors of cathepsin L.
2.7 Prediction of ADMET properties
In order to assess the pharmacokinetic properties and potential toxicity of the inhibitors
of TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L predicted from this docking study, we have also computed the
Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion and Toxicity (ADMET) properties of the
inhibitors using SwissADME ​(Daina et al., 2017)​ and vNN-ADMET ​(Schyman et al., 2017)​.
3. Results and Discussion
3.1 Workflow for virtual screening
This computational study aims to predict potential phytochemical inhibitors of human
proteases, TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L, that are important for priming of S protein and cell entry
of SARS-CoV-2 ​(Hoffmann, Kleine-Weber, et al., 2020; Ou et al., 2020; Shang, Wan, et al.,
2020)​. Briefly, the workflow for this virtual screening is as follows (Figure 3).
In the first stage, we prepared the ligands for molecular docking with target proteases.
We compiled a library of 14011 phytochemicals produced by medicinal plants used in traditional
Indian medicine, and the main source of this compilation was IMPPAT ​(Mohanraj et al., 2018)​,
the largest resource on phytochemicals of Indian herbs to date (Methods). Next, the standard

14

drug-likeness measure, Lipinski's rule of five (RO5) ​(Lipinski et al., 2001)​, was used to filter a
subset of 10510 drug-like phytochemicals. Next, the filtered phytochemicals were prepared for
docking by retrieving their 3D structures from Pubchem followed by energy-minimization using
OpenBabel ​(O’Boyle et al., 2011)​ (Methods).

inhibitors of human proteases TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L.
In the second stage, we prepared the target proteins for docking with prepared ligands.
For TMPRSS2, the 3D structure is yet to be determined experimentally, and thus, we built a
homology model of TMPRSS2 using SWISS-MODEL ​(Waterhouse et al., 2018)​ which was used
for docking after energy-minimization using UCSF Chimera ​(Pettersen et al., 2004)​ (Figure 1;
Methods). Figure 1 displays the TMPRSS2 model structure with the catalytic triad S441, H296
and D345 and the substrate binding residue D435 in the S1 subsite. For cathepsin L, the crystal

15

structure (PDB 5MQY) [15] with 1.13 Å resolution was used for docking after
energy-minimization using UCSF Chimera (Figure 2; Methods). Figure 2 displays the cathepsin
L structure with the catalytic dyad C25 and H163 in S1 subsite, and other important residues in
S2 and S1’ subsites.
In the third stage, we performed protein-ligand docking using AutoDock Vina ​(Trott &
Olson, 2010)​. For protein-ligand docking, an appropriate grid box was manually determined for
TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L (Methods). To decide on a stringent binding energy cut off for the
identification of potential inhibitors, docking was first performed for known inhibitors of target
proteins (Methods). ​Based on the docking binding energies of the known inhibitors, ​camostat
and nafamostat,​ to TMPRSS2, we decided on a stringent criteria of binding energy ≤ -8.5
kcal/mol for the best docked pose of screened ligands to identify potential inhibitors of
TMPRSS2 (Methods). ​Similarly, ​based on the docking binding energies of the known inhibitors,
E-64d and ​PC-0626568, to cathepsin L, we decided on a stringent criteria of binding energy ≤
-8.0 kcal/mol for the best docked pose of screened ligands to identify potential inhibitors of
cathepsin L (Methods). ​Thereafter, docking was performed for the prepared ligands in the
phytochemical library against the prepared structures of TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L (Methods).
Lastly, we filtered the subset of phytochemicals whose binding energy in the best docked pose
with TMPRSS2 (respectively, cathepsin L) is ​≤ -8.5 kcal/mol (respectively, ≤ -8.0 kcal/mol).
Moreover, ​the best docked pose with TMPRSS2 or cathepsin L of each filtered phytochemical
was separated from AutoDock Vina output file, and then, combined with the target protein
structure to obtain the docked protein-ligand complex in .pdb format (Methods). At the end of
third stage, we obtained 101 phytochemicals whose binding energy in the best docked pose with
TMPRSS2 is ​≤ -8.5 kcal/mol​ and 16 phytochemicals whose binding energy in the best docked
pose with cathepsin L is ​≤ -8.0 kcal/mol.
In the fourth stage, the structure of docked protein-ligand complex in .pdb format for
each filtered phytochemical from third stage was used to determine the ligand binding site
residues in the target protein and different non-covalent interactions between ligand and target
protein (Methods). In case of TMPRSS2, the specificity of this trypsin-like protease is

16

determined by the conserved substrate binding residue D435 in the S1 pocket
(Paoloni-Giacobino et al., 1997)​ (Methods), and therefore, a potent inhibitor should either bind
or form non-covalent interactions with D435. In case of cathepsin L, the specificity of this
cysteine protease is dependent on the catalytic residues, C25 and H163, in the S1 subsite
(Methods), and therefore, a potent inhibitor should either bind or form non-covalent interactions
with the catalytic residues. In this work, we consider a phytochemical to be a potential inhibitor
of TMPRSS2 (respectively, cathepsin L) only if the ligand binding energy in the best docked
pose is ​≤ -8.5 kcal/mol (respectively, ≤ -8.0 kcal/mol) and the ligand binds to or forms
non-covalent interactions with the residue ​D435 in TMPRSS2 (respectively, residues C25 and
H163 in cathepsin L).
At the end of fourth stage, we obtained 96 phytochemicals (labelled T1-T96; Figure 4;
Supplementary Table S1) as potential inhibitors of TMPRSS2 and 9 phytochemicals (labelled
C1-C9; Figure 5; Supplementary Table S2) as potential inhibitors of cathepsin L. Using IMPPAT
(Mohanraj et al., 2018)​, we provide a list of Indian medicinal plants that can produce the
identified phytochemical inhibitors of TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L (Tables 1-2; Supplementary
Table S3). Furthermore, we have also compiled information on potential antiviral or
anti-inflammatory use in traditional medicine of the herbal sources of the identified
phytochemical inhibitors of TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L (Tables 1-2; Supplementary Table S3).
In Supplementary Tables S4-S5, we list the ligand binding site residues and non-covalent
protein-ligand interactions for the identified phytochemical inhibitors of TMPRSS2 and
cathepsin L. Finally, we have also predicted the physicochemical and ADMET properties of the
identified phytochemical inhibitors of TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L (Methods; Supplementary
Tables S6-S7).

plants, and these 96 compounds labelled T1-T96 are listed in Supplementary Table S1 along
with their Pubchem identifier, common name, IUPAC name and structure in SMILES format. In
this section, we provide a detailed discussion of the top 9 phytochemical inhibitors (labelled as
T1-T9) whose binding energies in the best docked poses with TMPRSS2 are ​≤ -9.2 kcal/mol.
Figure 4 displays the structure of these ​top 9 phytochemical inhibitors of TMPRSS2 and ​Table 1
provides a ​list of Indian medicinal plants that can produce them.

4. Conclusion
Current COVID-19 pandemic is a serious threat to humankind. As of 30 May 2019,
COVID-19 has led to more than 3,65,000 deaths worldwide. Due to the absence of approved
therapeutics or vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, several countries have been forced to implement

29

partial or complete lockdown measures to restrict infection spread, however, such measures have
in turn resulted in an economic catastrophe. Consequently, there is an urgent need to develop
antivirals and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 to protect humankind. In this direction,
protein-ligand docking is a powerful computational method to expedite the search for
anti-COVID drugs by rapid identification of promising lead molecules. Here, we have used
molecular docking in the search of natural compound inhibitors of two human proteases,
TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L, that are key host factors in SARS-CoV-2 infection ​(Hoffmann,
Kleine-Weber, et al., 2020; Ou et al., 2020; Shang, Wan, et al., 2020)​.
Since early civilization, humans have used medicinal plants in different systems of
traditional medicine to treat various ailments ​(Yuan et al., 2016)​. Specifically, traditional systems
of Indian medicine including Ayurveda, Siddha and Unani have over centuries acquired
invaluable knowledge on medicinal plants spanning the rich biodiversity of the subcontinent for
treating various ailments including viral infections ​(Mohanraj et al., 2018)​. As plant-based
natural products have been an indomitable source of lead molecules in the course of modern drug
discovery ​(Newman & Cragg, 2012)​, it is worthwhile to search for potential anti-COVID drugs
among phytochemicals of Indian medicinal plants. In this direction, some of us have built
IMPPAT ​(Mohanraj et al., 2018)​, the largest resource on phytochemicals of Indian medicinal
plants to facilitate natural product based drug discovery. In this work, we have performed virtual
screening of 14010 phytochemicals that are produced by Indian medicinal plants to identify
potential inhibitors of key host factors, TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L, for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
We have predicted 96 potential phytochemical inhibitors of TMPRSS2, of which the top
candidates with least binding energy of -9.6 kcal/mol are Edgeworoside C, Adlumidine and
Qingdainone (Figure 4). We have also predicted 9 potential phytochemical inhibitors of
cathepsin L, of which the top candidate with least binding energy of -8.9 kcal/mol is Ararobinol
(Figure 5). Propitiously, Ararobinol is mentioned in a Chinese patent application ​(ZHU
SHOUHUI YANG, 2005)​ for its potential to treat human influenza virus infections.
Furthermore, most of the herbal sources of the identified phytochemical inhibitors of TMPRSS2
and cathepsin L are reported to have antiviral or anti-inflammatory use in traditional medicine

30

(Tables 1-2). Additional ​in vitro a​ nd ​in vivo​ testing of the identified phytochemical inhibitors of
TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L is needed before these molecules can enter clinical trials against
COVID-19. In conclusion, we expect the natural product inhibitors identified in this
computational study for TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L will likely inform future research toward
natural product-based anti-COVID therapeutics.
