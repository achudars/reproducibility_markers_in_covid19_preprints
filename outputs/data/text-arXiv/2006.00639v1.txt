ABSTRACT

Given the existing COVID-19 pandemic worldwide, it is critical to systematically study
the interactions between hosts and coronaviruses including SARS-Cov, MERS-Cov, and
SARS-CoV-2 (cause of COVID-19). We first created four host-pathogen interaction
(HPI)-Outcome postulates, and generated a HPI-Outcome model as the basis for
understanding host-coronavirus interactions (HCI) and their relations with the disease
outcomes. We hypothesized that ontology can be used as an integrative platform to
classify and analyze HCI and disease outcomes. Accordingly, we annotated and
categorized different coronaviruses, hosts, and phenotypes using ontologies and
identified their relations. Various COVID-19 phenotypes are hypothesized to be caused
by the backend HCI mechanisms. To further identify the causal HCI-outcome relations,
we collected 35 experimentally-verified HCI protein-protein interactions (PPIs), and
applied literature mining to identify additional host PPIs in response to coronavirus
infections. The results were formulated in a logical ontology representation for
integrative HCI-outcome understanding. Using known PPIs as baits, we also developed
and applied a domain-inferred prediction method to predict new PPIs and identified their
pathological targets on multiple organs. Overall, our proposed ontology-based integrative
framework combined with computational predictions can be used to support fundamental
understanding of the intricate interactions between human patients and coronaviruses
(including SARS-CoV-2) and their association with various disease outcomes.

Human coronaviruses pose a huge threat to global public health. The COVID-19
outbreak has led to significant morbidity, mortality and economic damage worldwide 1.
As of May 24, 2020, WHO reported over 5.2 million confirmed cases and over 337,000
deaths globally. COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2, a positive sense RNA virus in the
coronavirus family (Coronaviridae) 2,3. COVID-19 is the third well-attested outbreak of
zoonotic (infecting across species) coronaviruses in the last 18 years. The severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS) emerged in China in 2002, and the SARS outbreak lasted
for 8 months and caused in 8,098 confirmed human cases in 29 countries and 774
deaths4,5. In 2012, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was
isolated in Saudi Arabia from the sputum of a male patient who died from acute
pneumonia and renal failure 6. The MERS-CoV outbreaks resulted in 2,260 cases across
27 countries and 803 deaths7,8.
Coronaviruses are important pathogens for humans and other vertebrates 9.
Prevalent coronaviruses cause agriculturally important diseases in animals and a cold-like
illness in humans 10. Examples of coronavirus-induced animal diseases are avian
infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine
epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), and swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus
(SADS-CoV). A 2015 study estimated that IBV caused $3,567 in losses per 1000 birds
on poultry farms in Brazil 11. Prevalent human coronavirus strains, including human
coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HKU1, continuously
circulate in human populations and cause mild illness in children and adults around the
world 12.
These crucial differences between SARS-CoV-2 and more benign coronaviruses
are a function of specific adaptations that SARS-CoV-2 has made to the human host. For
example, the immune-evasive character of SARS-CoV-2 enables the COVID-19
pandemic to spread from asymptomatic individuals 13, because symptoms are primarily
produced by the host immune response. This spread from asymptomatic carriers is a key
portion of COVID-19’s rapid spread. Ongoing inquiry into these specific adaptations is
hampered by a lack of structured integrative resources with standard data and metadata
formats.

Deeper study of the interactions between hosts (human and others) and
coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and others) would help our
understanding of COVID-19 mechanisms and rational design of vaccines and drugs
against COVID-19. However, to achieve this goal, two major bottlenecks exist. First,
although intensive research has generated large amounts of data, the data are
multidimensional, heterogeneous, disintegrated and non-interoperable. Such data cannot
be efficiently interpreted by computers, preventing computer-assisted reasoning and
analysis. The second bottleneck is the lack of efficient computational algorithms and
bioinformatics tools to integrate and analyze the heterogeneous data and knowledge into
deep scientific understanding. This bottleneck slows the integration of host-coronavirus
interaction (HCI) data, discovery of HCI mechanisms, and new applications. Ontologies
can solve these problems in analysis by integrating big data in a computer-interpretable
way.
In the informatics field, an ontology is a human- and computer-interpretable set of
terms and relations that represent entities in a specific domain and how they relate to each
other. Ontology has played an important role in standard knowledge and data
representation, integration, sharing, and analysis. A major field of artificial intelligence is
knowledge representation and reasoning (KR², KR&R), and ontology is a foundation of
the KR&R. The Coronavirus Infectious Disease Ontology (CIDO) is a new communitybased biomedical ontology in the domain of coronavirus diseases
(https://github.com/cido-ontology/cido) 14. To better study the HCI mechanisms to
explain various COVID-19 phenomena, we propose to use CIDO as a platform for
standard and computer-understandable representation of the host-coronavirus interactions
and their influences on patient outcomes.
In this manuscript, we introduce a set of “HPI-Outcome postulates”, laying out a
set of basic rules for understanding host-pathogen interactions (HPIs) and their roles in
the disease outcomes. Then, we propose a model to study the relations between hostcoronavirus interactions (HCIs) and coronavirus disease outcomes. We used our
ontology-based strategy to annotate and classify human coronaviruses, hosts, and
experimentally verified host-coronavirus interactions (HCIs) obtained from literature
mining and bioinformatics studies. Using these annotations, we proposed an ontological

4

model of the interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and human to explain how the humanSARS-CoV-2 interactions would induce different disease outcomes such as hypertension
and cytokine storm. Furthermore, using known PPIs as baits, we developed a
computational method to predict new PPIs and their associations with multi-organ
disease phenotypes caused by SARS-CoV-2.

Methods
Manual literature mining of virulence factors and protein-protein
interacions. From the literature, we manually annotated and identified coronavirus
virulence factors and how host genes/proteins interact with coronaviruses.
Experimentally confirmed coronavirus virulence factors were added to the Victors, a
manually curated web-based database and analysis system15.
Ignet literature mining analysis. The Ignet interaction network tool
(http://ignet.hegroup.org/), powered by our in-house SciMiner 16 literature mining tool,
was used to mine gene-gene interactions in the specific domain of coronaviruses.
STRING bioinformatic analysis of PPIs. Known protein-protein interactions
among the host genes were collected from the STRING database with a medium
confidence score of 0.4.
Ontology-based representation and analysis. Coronaviruses and their prevalent
host species were mapped to NCBITaxon taxonomy ontology 17 and Human Phenotype
Ontology (HPO) 18. The disease phenotype outcomes, including different symptoms and
signs, were mapped to HPO. With these mapped terms, Ontofox 19 was used to generate
subsets (or slimes) of the NCBITaxon or HPO ontologies.
Prediction of host-coronavirus PPIs. We used a “domain-inferred prediction”
method to infer inter-species PPIs. Supported by the conservation and importance of
domains in proteins 20, such domain-domain interaction (DDI) infers the potential
interaction between two proteins if one domain in a pathogen protein A interacted with
another domain in a host protein B.
Visualization of host-coronavirus PPIs. Cytoscape21 was utilized for
visualization of the coronavirus-human PPIs.

Results
“HPI-Outcome postulates” and its associated model for deep COVID-19 study
Koch’s postulates22-24 have long provided criteria designed to establish a causal
relationship between exposure to a microbe and emergence of a disease. The four criteria
of Koch’s postulates are: (i) The microbe must be found in all organisms suffering from
the disease, but should not be found in healthy organisms. (2) The microbe must be
isolated from a diseased organism and grown in pure culture. (3) The cultured microbe
should cause the same disease when introduced into a healthy organism. (4) The microbe
must be reisolated from the inoculated, diseased experimental host and be identical to the
original causative agent.
If we assume that we know the causal relation between a microbe and a disease,
we are then asked to explain how the host-pathogen interaction (HPI) is causally
associated with an outcome. Such outcomes can include hard endpoints (i.e. death,
kidney failure) or intermediate phenotypic outcomes such as fever, reduced blood
oxygen. In this case, we may propose a set of HPI-Outcome postulates that can explain
how HPIs are linked to individual disease outcomes. Like Koch’s postulates, our HPIOutcome postulates include four criteria:
(i)

HPI motivation: The host (or pathogen) reacts to the pathogen (or host) to
achieve their best possible outcome. Such phenomena explain the root motivation
of the HPI and their associated outcomes.

(ii)

HPI-outcome causality: The host or pathogen outcomes are determined by the
HPIs at the molecular and cellular level. As a result, the host or pathogen’s
genetic and phenotypic profiles (such as the direct and co-morbid susceptibility
factors of the host) may affect such HPIs and thus disease outcomes.

(iii)

HPI role: The HPIs involves a network of molecular interactions at the interface
of host and pathogen or within either the host and pathogen, and different
molecules and interactions play different roles in determining disease outcomes.

(iv)

HPI interruption: An internal or external interruption of one or more H-P
interactions critical to the HPI-outcome network may change the outcome. The
external interruption can arise from drug or vaccine administration.

6

The HPI-outcome postulates provide a set of very basic rules to guide our study of
specific HPI mechanisms to explain disease outcomes. The first postulate explains the
root motivation of the HPI behaviors and disease outcomes. Note that pathogens
sometimes induce maladaptive responses in their hosts. For example, in the case of
coronavirus, the evasion or hijacking of the host immune response is crucial to viral
spread 25. Hosts have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to detect and fight against viral
infection, and immune evasion is a strategy by the virus to avoid a range of host
responses. At some stage, the host will successfully mount an immune response.
However, if immune evasion delays this immune response too long, the viral infection
may be too widespread and the immune response itself can kill the host/patient 26.
The other postulates are also critical for HPI study. For example, the 2nd postulate
explains why comorbid conditions may affect HPIs and thus outcomes. While in vitro or
labortary animal studies approximate in vivo human mechanisms, such studies may not
reflect HPI-outcome causal linkages in the relevant host (e.g., human) because important
HPIs leading to relevant outcomes may differ between hosts. According to the 3rd
postulate, each specific HPI initiates a dynamic interaction network and each interaction
has its role in the network. The HPI may change a cascade of molecular interactions
inside the host or pathogen. The roles of different molecules and interactions in the
network should be carefully studied. According to the 4th postulate, the HPI interruption
may be performed by the host or pathogen naturally or can be initiated by the
administration of a drug or vaccine.
Based on the HPI-Outcome postulates, we lay out the integrative host-coronavirus
interaction framework as shown in Figure 1. Basically, the framework includes three
major processes from the viral side and three major processes from the host side. For the
coronaviruses, crucial processes include: viral entry to host cell, viral replication, and
viral release from the infected cell. For the host, three responses exist: the naïve response,
the innate response, and the adaptive response. Initially, the host response to the
coronavirus entry through a receptor-ligand interaction is naïve since the host does not
realize the danger and react to the virus by a routine procedure. At this naïve host
response stage, neither signalling molecules nor selected immune cell populations are yet

7

present to coordinate an immune response. As signalling molecules are produced by
infected cells (e.g. cytokines, interferons), the host will show a delayed innate responses
to coronavirus infection. The innate immune response may or may not become effective
and strong against the viral infection. Eventually, through a process of recombination
followed by clonal selection in multiple immune cell subtypes, the host will mount an
adaptive immune response more effective against the viral infection (Figure 1). Each of
the viral or host process includes many subprocesses and interactions. Dynamic hostvirus interactions can be used to explain disease outcomes according to their impact on
these many subprocesses. If the viruses “wins”, the result will be the viral survival and
replication. If the host “wins”, the host will eventually control viral replication and kill
the viruses. To model and analyze the complex adversarial interactions between host and
pathogen, we propose to apply ontology as an integrative and systematic platform due to
the solid semantic logic behind ontology and its computer-interpretable nature.

Coronaviruses causing different host outcomes belong to different categories.
We used ontology to represent coronavirus disease knowledge including the
taxonomical structure of 9 coronaviruses in the NCBITaxon ontology, a taxonomy
ontology based on the NCBI Taxonomy database17. As shown in Figure 2A,
coronaviruses belong to subfamily Orthocoronavirinae (“true” coronaviruses) in the
family Cornavirinae. SARS-Cov and SARS-Cov-2 belong to the Sarbecovirus subgenera
in genus Betacoronavirus. MERS-CoV belongs to the Merbecovirus subgenera, also in
genus Betacoronavirus. Three human CoV strains HKU1, OC43, and A59 belong to
subgenus Embecovirus in genus Betacoronavirus. However, the two other humaninfecting strains (229E and NL63) belong to genus Alphacoronvirus. Avian
coronaviruses, such as IBV, are Gammacoronaviruses. As part of the NCBITaxon
ontology, this Linnean hierarchy is extracted to become part of the CIDO.

Human coronaviruses infect and transmit among mammal hosts. We identified over
10 organisms that can serve as hosts or reservoirs for human coronaviruses. Bats were
found to be the reservoir of a wide variety of coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and
MERS-CoV viruses 27. SARS-CoV was also found in masked palm civets and a raccoon

8

dog, and antibodies against SARS-CoV were also found in Chinese ferret badgers in a
live-animal market in Shenzhen, China 28. Our analysis found many other animals that
might have served as reservoir hosts of SARS-CoV (Figure 2B). The MERS-CoV virus
likely transmitted from dromedary camels 29.
These host organisms can further be classified using the NCBITaxon ontology
(Figure 2B). All the host organisms belong to Boreoeutheria, a clade (magnorder) of
placental mammals. Clades within Boreoeutheria include Euarchontoglires
(Supraprimates, including humans and rodents) and Laurasiatheria. Laurasiatheria
includes Artiodactyla (even toed ungulates, such as cattle and camels), Chiroptera (bats),
and Ferae (carnivores such as canines, felines, and civets, and relatives including
pangolins) (Figure 2B). The taxonomy hierarchy was also extracted from the NCBITaxon
ontology and become part of the CIDO.
Our NCBITaxon-based ontology analysis of all these coronavirus hosts further
shows that zoonotic human coronaviruses (including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and
SARS-CoV-2) are obligate mammal parasites (Figure 2B), suggesting that some
molecular factor distinguishes mammals from other animals to host and transmit
coronaviruses to humans. We hypothesize that zoonotic human coronaviruses (such as
SARS-CoV-2) can only originate in mammals (in contrast to influenza, which can
transmit to humans from avians). However, this hypothesis will need substantial
additional study. A recent paper suggests snake as an intermediate host for human
zoonotic coronavirus based on similarity in codon usage bias with 2019-nCoV (e.g.,
SARS-CoV-2) 30. Since snakes are not mammals, this would disprove our hypothesis, but
the overall pattern makes the proposed transmission via snakes an extreme claim, thus
requiring extreme evidence.

COVID-19 outcomes differ among hosts. According to US CDC, the common
symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing,
chills, repeated shaking with chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, and new loss of
taste or smell. Figure 3A is a hierarchical display of these 9 common symptoms and their
associated hierarchical phenotype representation using the Human Phenotype Ontology
(HPO) 31.

9

Comorbidity is the presence of additional condition(s) such as a disease or
phenotype that is concurrent with the coronavirus infection. Our further COVID-19
annotation and analysis show that the patients with many comorbid conditions (e.g.,
emphysema, chronic bronchitis, hypertension, coronary heart disease, and diabetes) are at
heightened risk for severe symptoms and death. Figure 3B shows comorbidities and the
COVID-19 outcome frequencies from case reports in peer-reviewed articles. To analyze
the host interactions leading to these outcomes, it is very important to build data
structures and data visualizations that can draw upon clinical electronic records.

Literature mining, annotation, and analysis of host-coronavirus interactions.
Clinical coronavirus disease outcomes result from host-coronavirus interactions.
We have collected 10, 4, and 1 virulence factors from SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and
SARS-CoV-2, respectively (Table 1, Figure 4). Table 1 shows 35 manually curated hostcoronavirus protein-protein interactions (PPIs), which has been extracted from peerreviewed articles and stored in Victors, a virulence factor database we developed15. These
PPIs include a number of experimentally verified mechanisms. For example, all
betacoronaviruses encode a spike (S) surface glycoprotein that binds to their
corresponding host cell receptors and mediates viral entry to the host cells. Our annotated
PPIs show that SARS-CoV uses its envelope spike (S) glycoprotein to bind to its cellular
receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) 32. The S1 subunit of the S protein
has a receptor binding domain (RBD) that binds to ACE2. Letko et al. confirmed that
human ACE2 is the receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 33. In contrast, MERS-CoV S protein
binds to dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) 34,35. These interactions are essential for viral
entry into host cells. More specifically, the viral S protein mediates the interaction with
the host-cell receptor, even when the host receptor varies between viruses. Table 1 shows
many other targets or effects of potential interest.
Using Ignet, our in-house centrality- and network-based literature mining analysis
program17, we performed a preliminary gene-interaction analysis on PubMed abstracts
related to coronavirus. In total 14,963 coronavirus-related PubMed abstracts were
extracted. Figure 4 illustrates the resulting gene interaction network, which identifies
critical genes and their interactions with host factors including IFNG, TNF, ACE2,

10

TMPRSS2, IL1b and IL-6. IFNG had the highest degree (number of interactions) at 27,
suggesting its critical regulatory roles in the coronavirus pathogenesis. ACE2 directly
interacts with viral proteins of three coronaviral strains (SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and
HCoV_NL63) and interacts with host-proteins that directly interact with other two strains
(HCoV_229 and MERS). ACE2 is also highly connected with other genes identified by
literature mining, which all strongly suggest its critical role in the pathogenic
mechanisms. It is likely that patterns of interaction with ACE2 differ among
coronaviruses, leading to differences in transmission and pathogenesis.
In addition to PPIs, non-PPI mechanisms also exist. Non-PPI host factors, such as
host lipids 36 and nucleotides 37, are also required for viral replication. Host lipids, such as
lipid rafts and cholesterol, participate in the endocytosis process by which viruses attach
to and infect cells. Many naturally derived substances, including cyclodextrin and sterols,
could reduce the infectivity of many viruses, including coronaviruses, by interference
with lipid-dependent attachment to human cells 38. Nucleotide and nucleoside analogue
inhibitors are chemically synthesized drugs used to treat both chronic and acute viral
infections by causing premature chain termination, reduced replication fidelity, and
depletion of pools of naturally occurring nucleotides37. For example, remdesivir is a
monophosphate prodrug of an adenosine nucleoside analog that has demonstrated
therapeutic efficacy in a non-human primate model of Ebola virus infection 39 and against
human SARS-CoV-2 infection 40.

Unification under an ontology-based integrative framework.
Based on our HPI-Outcome postulates, the model given in Figure 1, and our
literature mining results, we generated an integrative framework to formally specify the
interactions between host and SARS-CoV-2 factors with associated disease outcomes.
Figure 5 illustrates how the human host interacts with SARS-Cov2 and how such
interaction could result in hypertension. As discussed above, SARS-CoV and SARSCov2 use their envelope spike (S) glycoprotein to bind to the same cellular receptor,
ACE2, which is activated by TMPRSS241. The binding of the SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV2
to human ACE2 leads to the subsequent downregulation of ACE2. Experiments showed
that SARS-CoV infections and the spike protein of the SARS-CoV reduce ACE2

11

expression, and an injection of SARS-CoV Spike into mice worsens acute lung failure,
which can be attenuated by blocking the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) pathway 32. As
we know (Figure 3), patients with hypertension are more susceptible to death and severe
outcomes. This phenomenon can be explained if the down-regulation of the ACE2 due to
the infection is associated with hypertension (Figure 5). Specifically, the downregulation
of ACE2 would lead to excessive production of angiotensin II by ACE, which would then
bind to its receptor and induce vasocontraction and hypertension42.
Although ACE and ACE2 both act as key players in the RAS, they serve
oppositional roles to angiotensin II. An angiotensin II receptor blocker drug (e.g.,
Azilsartan) would block the angiotensin II binding to its receptor, and thus help treat
hypertension. In this way, the ontological model links host-pathogen interactions to the
hypertension outcome. If a patient already has hypertension, the further increased blood
pressure due to the interactions would exacerbate the underlying comorbidity, which may
explain the increased death rate of patients with superimposed Covid and hypertension.
However, other pathogen factors likely play a role in the extreme pathogenicity of
SARS-CoV-2. This is evidenced by the fact that despite markedly weak pathogenicity,
HCoV-NL63 (a prevalent human coronavirus) also uses an S-ACE2 interaction for
cellular entry43. However, HCoV-NL63 is considerably more benign than SARS-CoV-2.
This may be a consequence of molecular differences in the S protein-ACE2 interaction
between the two strains. The ontology-driven comparative analysis of CoVs provides a
formal representation for both similarities and differences among the S proteins from
different viruses. If the S proteins do not differ significantly, we hypothesize that some
other factor (e.g., a co-receptor) of SARS-CoV-2 contributes to viral binding and entry.
Our recent vaccine design study44 predicts many SARS-CoV-2 nonstructural proteins as
possible adhesins, some of which may serve as a possible co-receptor, which are testable
predictions.
A cytokine storm is an excessive immune response to external stimuli associated
with high levels of cytokine production45. Cytokine storm is a major cause of acute
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiple-organ failure in severe COVID-19
patients, resulting in death within a short time46. IL-6 is a major cytokine involved in the
cytokine storm45. IL-6 can be induced by the angiotensin II in human cells 47, which links

12

the cytokine storm to the S-ACE2 binding-associated interaction network (Figure 5).
Tocilizumab, a recombinant humanized anti-human IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibody,
can bind to the IL-6 receptor with high affinity, and thus prevent IL-6 from binding to its
native receptor and inducing downstream immune damage. It was recently reported the
Tocilizumab improved the clinical outcome in severe and critical COVID-19 patients and
effectively reduced mortality 48.
Figure 5 provides a logical and structured graphical summary of the knowledge
introduced above. This representation covers knowledge learned from many studies.
Without such an integrative representation, it is difficult to put all the pieces together.
Another unique feature of the Figure 5 representation is that it is ontology-oriented, so
that all the terms and relations are represented using a computer-interpretable ontological
format. Figure 5 is a subset of the comprehensive host-coronavirus interaction network,
which will be expanded as our understanding of host-interactions by the coronavirus
grows.
To demonstrate the ontological representation, the process 'SARS-CoV-2 S-ACE2
binding' can be defined by two logical axioms (Figure 5):
'has participant' some ('SARS-CoV-2 S protein' and ('has role' some 'ligand role'))
'has participant' some ('ACE2' and ('has role' some 'receptor role'))
The above ontological logical axioms define the relations where a SARS-CoV-2
S-ACE2 binding process has two participants: a SARS-CoV-2 S protein that serves as a
ligand role, and an ACE2 protein that serves as a receptor role.
In addition, we can define a logical axiom between 'SARS-CoV-2 S-ACE2
binding' and TMPRSS2 that defines the role of TMPRSS2 to activate the SARS-CoV-2
S-ACE2 binding process:
TMPRSS2: activates some 'SARS-CoV-2 S-ACE2 binding'
A major difference between ontology and taxonomy is that a taxonomy is built
only based on the is_a relation. Beside the representation of such is_a relation, ontology
can also provide additional relations between entities under different hierarchies, such as
the above ‘activates’ relation that links the TMPRSS2 protein in the protein hierarchy and
the SARS-CoV-2 S-ACE2 binding under the interaction process hierarchy.

13

Our ontology-based integrative framework will also cover other parts of hostcoronavirus interactions and their relations to the disease outcomes. Zoonotic human
coronaviruses appear to delay active innate responses to viral infection. The interferon
(IFN) family of cytokines, including IFN-α, IFN-β and IFN-γ, tigger the early innate
response against viral pathogens. However, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are able to
delay IFN induction and dysregulate IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) effector functions in
primary human airway epithelial cells or in cultured cells (altered histone modification is
a proposed molecular mechanism)49,50. Inteferons, in turn, are able to initiate the
expression of hundreds of ISGs that have antiviral and immune regulatory functions 49,51.
The excessive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, esp. IL-1b, IL8, IL-6, CXCL10, and CCL2, were detected in SARS patients 52-54, indicating the
initiation of a cytokine storm, which is eventually associated with the progression to
ARDS and death. It is obvious that the timing here is critical. The early IFN response
would be beneficial. However, coronaviruses, especially SARS-CoV-2, manipulate the
immune system to delay such a response allowing widespread infection prior to an onset
of symptoms. The understanding of such dynamics helps our rational design of proper
treatments and the timing of the treatments.
It appears that similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 also affects
the IFN response 51,55. SARS-CoV-2 even displayed a higher sensitivity to IFN-I in vitro
compared with SARS-CoV-1 in infected Vero cells 56. The difference in terms of IFN-I
activation between SARS-CoV and SAR-CoV-2 is likely due to the difference in the
sequences for two proteins (Orf 3b and Orf 6) of these two human coronaviruses 56.
Considering that different human coronaviruses induce varied phenotype outcomes, it is
important to include more coronaviruses in the systematic comparison and identify their
differential action on IFN production and on ISGs, which likely plays a critical role in the
delayed host recognition and responses to the infection, supporting the survival and
replication of the viruses inside the host. Our proposed HPI postulates combined with our
structured ontology support an systems-level investigation into these mechanisms and
into potential avenues of prophylaxis or treatment.
The second key component of the host response to coronavirus interaction is the
activation of an adaptive host response, which is also key to long term immunity. The

14

severe SARS disease is also related to the lack of or delayed activation of adaptive
immunity 42. The SARS patients with severe outcomes maintained high levels of many
innate immune system-linked cytokines (e.g., CXCL10, CCL2) and ISG-encoded
proteins with low levels of spike-specific antibodies 57. Conversely, surviving patients
had higher levels of spike-specific antibodies. These findings suggest that the prompt
formation of adaptive immunity is important to reduce disease severity and improve
outcomes. The adaptive immune response can be induced by effective vaccines against
COVID-19. Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV S and S1 have been used as vaccine
antigens/immunogens due to their ability to induce neutralizing antibodies that prevent
host cell attachment and infection 44,58. Numerous SARS-CoV-2 vaccine trials are
underway 44, with the hope that a safe and effective vaccine(s) will be ready in the near
future to control the COVID-19 pandemic.

Computational prediction of new host-coronavirus PPIs and tissue responses
Our previous Victors PPI predictions are based on the analyses of protein domains and
phylogeny15. By nature, each PPI is a domain-domain interaction. Therefore, we can
identify the domains of virus proteins, and based on known interactions with domains of
host proteins, predict how the virus proteins interact with host proteins. Using the known
PPIs as baits, we developed a domain-inferred PPI prediction strategy to predict more
PPIs, and how these PPIs could possibly affect organs and tissues. Our prediction found
that SARS-CoV-2 could induce 3,111 human-virus interactions with 133 human proteins.
Many PPIs are tissue-specific, and the tissue-specific information can be identified from
the Human Protein Atlas 59. Using our predicted PPIs, SARS-CoV-2 was predicted to
affect many tissues such as skin, liver, intestine, blood, glands and reproductive tissues
(Figure 6).
In addition to computational methods, the prediction described above also
depends on prior knowledge of the pre-identified PPIs and tissue-specific protein
expression profiles. Currently, these pre-identified PPIs and tissue-preferred gene profiles
are stored in tables or databases that do not have a scientifically well-motivated
associated ontology. Therefore, the use of this prior knowledge is labor intensive and
difficult to automate. We can ontologically represent the domains from viral and host

15

proteins, individual domain-domain interactions, and the tissue preference of each protein
and domain. We expect that such a systematic ontology-based representation of this prior
knowledge would facilitate the usage of both domain-domain interactions and tissue
specificity studies, supporting additional interaction predictions and analysis.

Discussion
The contribution of this article is manifold. First, a set of host-pathogen
interaction (HPI)-outcome postulates are proposed to provide a framework for deeper
understanding of host-pathogen interactions and their causal role in disease outcomes.
The HPI-outcome postulates can be applied to fundamentally understand interactions
between hosts (including humans) and coronaviruses (including SARS-CoV-2). Second,
to use the HPI-outcome postulates, we proposed an integrative ontology-based
framework to systematically model, represent, and analyze human-coronavirus
interaction (HCI)-outcome relations, including coronavirus and host phylogenies, and
literature mined and manually annotated host-coronavirus interactions, drugs, vaccines,
and their intertwined relations. Third, examples such as a potential mechanistic link
between the S-ACE2 interaction and blood pressure comorbidities illustrate applications
of our integrative ontology-based framework. We demonstrate a structured, hierarchical
representation of coronaviruses, hosts, phenotypes, and HCI interactions in terms of viral
pathogenesis and host innate and adaptive responses. We showed that based on prior
knowledge, we could develop computational predictions to predict new host-coronavirus
interactions (HCIs) and extrapolate to hypothetical affects on different tissues and organs.
We envision that our proposed integrative ontology-based framework could serve
as a foundation for ongoing and deeper studies of the COVID-19 disease. We have
initiated the development of the community-driven Coronavirus Infectious Disease
Ontology (CIDO), which can serve as a logic framework for the systematic
representation of the HCIs, disease outcomes, and the relations between the HCIs and
disease outcomes14. CIDO is an interoperable with other ontologies, such as the
community-based Ontology of Host-Pathogen Interactions (OHPI)15. The communitybased CIDO can serve as an ontology platform for describing host-coronavirus
interactions (HCIs) built from these HPI-postulates.

16

The intergrative ontological modeling can also support different applications such
as rational drug repurposing design and vaccine development. As shown in Figure 5, our
ontological representation provides several paths for rational drug repurposing design for
COVID-19 treatment. Camostat mesylate (a serine protease inhibitor) is capable of
inhibiting the function of TMPRSS241, which is crucial for the effective S-ACE2 binding
TMPRSS241. Angiotensin II receptor blockers can be used to block the activation of the
angiotensin II 60, therefore blocking the vacoconstriction and following hypertension.
Tocilizumab is able to inhibit IL-6 activity48 so block the formation of cytokine storm.
SARS-CoV-2 appears to use many pathways to cause different phenotypes. It is
reasonable to hypothesize that the drugs blocking early stages of the disease pathways
would be more effective than the later starges of the pathways. It is also important to
consider drugs that block the paths leading to severe disease outcomes such as
hypertension and cytokine storm. In addition, we also need to consider the side effects of
the drugs being used for the treatment. The integrative ontology framework provides a
foundation for these rational design. Ontology-based software tools and algorithms can
also be developed to support intelligence queries61,62 and enhance computational
predictions63-65, especially when the computer-intepretable ontology knowledge base
system becomes big and complex.
The CIDO ontology-based evidence-driven framework can provide a fundamental
structure analgous to Mendeleev’s periodic table of chemical elements. Based on the 64
chemical elements known, Mendeleev generated a periodic table to position these
elements and predicted the deeper, underlying structure giving rise to their chemical
properties. Similarly, we can accumulate all the existing evidence of HCIs and put these
interactions into a HCI framework to identify periodic patterns, and use these patterns to
predict strategies for drugs and vaccines. These patterns are represented through an
ontology, which provides a periodic table-like framework. CIDO aims to become such an
ontology. Our future plan includes more logical and thorough representation and analysis
of the host-coronavirus molecular and cellular interactions, and development of new
ontology-based algorithms and tools to support translational applications.

For example, (0.14, 0.30) in (B) indicates that superimposed hypertension is found in
14% and 30% of mild symptom and severe symptom patients, respectively. The results
were summarized from reported literature 66,67.

Figure 4. Gene-gene interaction network by Ignet on the PubMed abstracts related
to coronavirus. The figure was constructed based on expert curated (left non-gray
colored) and literature mined gene interaction by Ignet from 14,963 abstracts, retrieved
by a PubMed search of “coronavirus”. Node (gene) and font size correspond to the
number of connections to other nodes, a.k.a. degree. Edge (interaction) thickness
represents the relative importance of each connection in the network, measured by edge
betweenness centrality. This network includes 131 nodes with 163 edges.

Figure 5. Model linking host-coronavirus interactions to outcomes. This model
includes different components that integrate into the systematic framework, which

Figure 1. Model of host-coronavirus interactions and their associated disease
outcomes. The viruses enter into, survive in, and replicate in host cells. After initial naïve
acceptance of viral entry without triggering an immune reaction (a naïve response), the
host initiates active innate and adaptive responses.

Figure 2. Ontological representation of coronaviruses, hosts, and the coronavirushost associations. (A) The taxonomical hierarchy of human coronaviruses and a few
other coronaviruses as outgroups. (B) The taxonomical hierarchy of reported hosts of
coronaviruses. The links represent associations between the coronaviruses and
established hosts.

Figure 3. Human phenotypes associated with COVID-19. (A) Human phenotypes
commonly seen in COVID-19 patients. (B) Hierarchical representative of comorbidity
phenotypes and associated phenotype frequency in mild and severe COVID-19 patients.
For example, (0.14, 0.30) in (B) indicates that superimposed hypertension is found in
14% and 30% of mild symptom and severe symptom patients, respectively. The results
were summarized from reported literature 66,67.

Figure 4. Gene-gene interaction network by Ignet on the PubMed abstracts related
to coronavirus. The figure was constructed based on expert curated (left non-gray
colored) and literature mined gene interaction by Ignet from 14,963 abstracts, retrieved
by a PubMed search of “coronavirus”. Node (gene) and font size correspond to the
number of connections to other nodes, a.k.a. degree. Edge (interaction) thickness
represents the relative importance of each connection in the network, measured by edge
betweenness centrality. This network includes 131 nodes with 163 edges.

Figure 5. Model linking host-coronavirus interactions to outcomes. This model
includes different components that integrate into the systematic framework, which
illustrates a potential link between SARS-CoV-2 infection and hypertension severity (and
cytokine storm).

Figure 6. Predicted protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and their affected tissues.
PPIs are predicted based on domain-domain interactions and sequence similarity. We
predicted 3,111 human-virus interactions involving 133 human proteins. The nodes in the
middle are virus proteins and nodes in the outer circle are human proteins. The
interacting human proteins are annotated with tissue-specific expression profiles from the
Human Protein Atlas. Proteins enriched in different tissues are marked with different
colors.
