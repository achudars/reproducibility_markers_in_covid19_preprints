Abstract
We introduce a mathematical description of the impact of sociality in the spread of infectious
diseases by integrating an epidemiological dynamics with a kinetic modeling of population-based
contacts. The kinetic description leads to study the evolution over time of Boltzmann-type equations describing the number densities of social contacts of susceptible, infected and recovered individuals, whose proportions are driven by a classical SIR-type compartmental model in epidemiology.
Explicit calculations show that the spread of the disease is closely related to moments of the contact distribution. Furthermore, the kinetic model allows to clarify how a selective control can be
assumed to achieve a minimal lockdown strategy by only reducing individuals undergoing a very
large number of daily contacts. We conduct numerical simulations which confirm the ability of the
model to describe different phenomena characteristic of the rapid spread of an epidemic. Motivated by the COVID-19 pandemic, a last part is dedicated to fit numerical solutions of the proposed
model with infection data coming from different European countries.

Introduction

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic led in many countries to heavy lockdown measures assumed by the
governments with the aim to control and limit its spreading. In this context, an essential role is
played by the mathematical modeling of infectious diseases since they allow direct validation with
real data, unlike other classical phenomenological approaches. This consequently permits evaluation
of control and prevention strategies by comparing their cost with effectiveness and to give support
to public health decisions [22, 46]. On this subject, most of the models present in literature make
assumptions on transmission parameters [8, 17] which are considered the only responsible of the
spread of the infection. However, special attention was recently paid by the scientific community
to the role and the estimate of the distribution of contacts between individuals as also a relevant
cause of the potential pathogen transmission (cf. [5, 20, 24, 40] and the references therein).
In this direction, the results reported in [5] can be of great help when designing partial lockdown
strategies. In fact, an optimal control of the pathogen transmission of the epidemic could be
achieved through a direct limitation of the number of daily contacts among people. On this subject,
the detailed analysis performed in [5] put into evidence that the number of social contacts in the

population is in general well-fitted by a Gamma distribution, even if this distribution is not uniform
with respect to age, sex and wealth. Gamma distributions belong to the wide class of generalized
Gamma distributions [37, 48], which have been recently connected to the statistical study of social
phenomena [35, 45], and fruitfully described as steady states of kinetic models aiming to describe
the formation of these profiles in consequence of repeated elementary interactions [18, 49].
Starting from the above consideration and inspired by the recent development concerning kinetic models describing human behavior [18,49], in this paper we develop a mathematical framework
to connect the distribution of social contacts with the spreading of a disease in a multiagent system.
This result is obtained by integrating an epidemiological dynamics given by a classical compartmental model [8, 17, 32] with an approach based on kinetic equations determining the formation of
social contacts. In this paper we concentrate on the classical SIR dynamics. However, we stress
that the ideas here described are clearly not reduced to this model which can be intended as an
example. Instead, the methodology here discussed can be extended to incorporate more realistic
epidemiological dynamics, like for instance the classical endemic models discussed in [8, 17, 32]. In
particular, the extension of the present approach to age-dependent compartmental models could
be of great interest to produce realistic scenarios.
Other aspects, which certainly have a stronger impact on how a virus spreads, are related to
the presence of asymptomatic individuals [28] as well as to a time delay between contacts and
outbreak of the disease [14] which helps in the diffusion of the illness. These possible modeling
improvements are the subject of future investigations and they will not be treated in this work. In
fact, we stress that the principal scope of this work is to introduce a new class of models which is
capable to incorporate information on the social heterogeneity of a population which we believe to
be a crucial aspect in the spread of contagious diseases. Besides these simplifying assumptions, we
will show that the basic features considered and detailed in the rest of the article are sufficient in
many cases to construct a new class of models which well fits with the experimental data. Precise
quantitative estimates are postponed to future investigations.
An easy way to understand epidemiology models is that, given a population composed of agents,
they prescribe movements of individuals between different states based on some matching functions
or laws of motion. According to the classical SIR models [32], agents in the system are split into
three classes, the susceptible, who can contract the disease, the infected, who have already contracted the disease and can transmit it, and the recovered who are healed, immune or isolated.
Inspired by the model considered in [18] for describing a social attitude and making use of classical
epidemiological dynamics, we present here a model composed by a system of three kinetic equations, each one describing the time evolution of the distribution of the number of contacts for the
subpopulation belonging to a given epidemiological class. These three equations are further coupled
by taking into account the movements of agents from one class to the other as a consequence of the
infection, with an intensity proportional to the product of the average contact frequencies, rather
than the product of population fractions.
The interactions which describe the social contacts of individuals are based on few rules and
can be easily adapted to take into account the behavior of agents in the different classes in presence
of the infectious disease. Our joint framework is consequently based on two models which can be
considered classical in the respective fields.
From the side of multi-agent systems in statistical mechanics, the linear kinetic model introduced
in [18, 49] has been shown to be flexible and able to describe, with suitable modifications, different
problems in which human behavior plays an essential role, like the formation of social contacts. Once
the statistical distribution of social contacts has been properly identified as equilibrium density of
the underlying kinetic model, this information is used to close the hierarchy of equations describing
the evolution of moments [12]. In this way, we obtain a coupled system of equations, identifying
a new epidemiological model which takes into account at best the statistical details about the
contact distribution of a population. The model connects the measure of the heterogeneity of the
population, i.e. the variance of the contact distribution, with the epidemic trajectory. This is
in agreement with a well-know finding in the epidemiological literature, see e.g. [3, 16, 41, 51]. A
recent research showing the influence of population heterogeneity on herd immunity to COVID-19

infection is due to Britton et al. [9].
Starting from the general macroscopic model, one can fruitfully obtain from it various sub-classes
of SIR-type epidemiological models characterized by non-linear incidence rates, as for instance
recently considered in [36]. It is also interesting to remark that the presence of non-linearity in the
incidence rate function, and in particular, the concavity condition with respect to the number of
infected has been considered in [36] as a consequence of psychological effects. Namely, the authors
observed that in the presence of a very large number of infected, the probability for an infected
to transmit the virus may further decrease because the population tend to naturally reduce the
number of contacts. The importance of reducing at best the social contacts to countering the
advance of a pandemic is a well-known and studied phenomenon [22]. While in normal life activity,
it is commonly assumed that a large part of agents behave in a similar way, in presence of an
extraordinary situation like the one due to a pandemic, it is highly reasonable to conjecture that
the social behavior of individuals is strictly affected by their personal feeling in terms of safeness.
Thus, in this work, we focus on the assumption that it is the degree of diffusion of the disease
that changes people’s behavior in terms of social contacts, in view both of the personal perception
and/or of the external government intervention. More generally, the model can be clearly extended
to consider more realistic dependencies between an epidemic disease and the social contacts of
individuals. However, this does not change the essential conclusions of our analysis, namely that
there is a close interplay between the spread of the disease and the distribution of contacts, that
the kinetic description is able to quantify. In particular, we stress the fact that we consider our
approach as methodological, thus the encouraging results described in the rest of the article suggest
that a similar analysis can be carried out, at the price of an increasing difficulty in computations, in
more complex epidemiological models like the SIDARTHE model [29, 30], to validate and improve
the eventual partial lockdown strategies of the government and to suggest future measures.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the system of three SIRtype kinetic equations combining the dynamics of social contacts with the spread of infectious
disease in a system of interacting individuals. Then, in Section 2.2 we show that through a suitable
asymptotic procedure, the solution to the kinetic system tends towards the solution of a system of
three SIR-type Fokker-Planck type equations with local equilibria of Gamma-type [5]. Once the
system of Fokker-Planck type equations has been derived, in Section 3, we close the system of kinetic
equations around the Gamma-type equilibria to obtain a new epidemiological model in which the
incidence rate depends on the number of social contacts between individuals. Last, in Section 4,
we investigate at a numerical level the relationships between the solutions of the kinetic system
of Boltzmann type, its Fokker-Planck asymptotics and the macroscopic model. These simulations
confirm the ability of our approach to describe different phenomena characteristic of the trend of
social contacts in situations compromised by the rapid spread of an epidemic and the consequences
of various lockdown action in its evolution. A last part is dedicated to a fitting of the model with
the experimental observations: first we estimate the parameters of the epidemic through the data
at disposal and successively we use them in the macroscopic model showing that our approach is
able to reproduce the pandemic trend.

2 A kinetic approach combining social contacts and epidemic dynamics
Our goal is to build a kinetic system which suitably describes the spreading of an infectious disease
under the dependence of the contagiousness parameters on the individual number of social contacts
of the agents. Accordingly to classical SIR models [32], the entire population is divided into three
classes: susceptible, infected and recovered individuals. As already claimed the ideas here developed
can be extended to more complex compartmental epidemic models.
Aiming to understand social contacts effects on the dynamics, we will not consider in the sequel
the role of other sources of possible heterogeneity in the disease parameters (such as the personal
susceptibility to a given disease), which could be derived from the classical epidemiological models,

3

suitably adjusted to account for new information [16, 41, 51]. Consequently, agents in the system
are considered indistinguishable [43]. This means that the state of an individual in each class at any
instant of time t ≥ 0 is completely characterized by the sole number of contacts x ≥ 0, measured
in some unit.
While x is a natural positive number at the individual level, without loss of generality we will
consider x in the rest of the paper to be a nonnegative real number, x ∈ R+ , at the population level.
We denote then by fS (x, t), fI (x, t) and fR (x, t), the distributions at time t > 0 of the number
of social contacts of the population of susceptible, infected and recovered individuals, respectively.
The distribution of contacts of the whole population is then recovered as the sum of the three
distributions
f (x, t) = fS (x, t) + fI (x, t) + fR (x, t).
We do not consider for simplicity of presentation disease related mortality as well as the presence
of asymptomatic individuals which we aim to insert in future investigations. Therefore, we can fix
the total distribution of social contacts to be a probability density for all times t ≥ 0

f (x, t) dx = 1.

denote the fractions, at time t ≥ 0, of susceptible, infected and recovered respectively. For a given

Unambiguously, we will indicate the mean and the local mean values, corresponding to α = 1, by
x(t) and, respectively, xJ (t), J ∈ {S, I, R}.
In what follows, we assume that the various classes in the model could act differently in the
social process constituting the contact dynamics. The kinetic model then follows combining the
epidemic process with the contact dynamics. This gives the system
∂fS (x, t)
= −K (fS , fI )(x, t) + QS (fS )(x, t)

∂fI (x, t)

∂t
∂fR (x, t)
= γ fI (x, t) + QR (fR )(x, t)

(3)

where γ is the constant recovery rate while the transmission of the infection is governed by the
function K (fS , fI ), the local incidence rate, expressed by
Z
K (fS , fI )(x, t) = fS (x, t)
κ (x, y)fI (y, t) dy.
(4)
R+

In full generality, we will assume that both the recovery rate γ and the contact function κ depend
on a small positive parameter   1 which measures their intensity. In (4) the contact function

4

κ (x, y) is a nonnegative function growing with respect to the number of contacts x and y of the
populations of susceptible and infected, and such that κ (x, 0) = 0. A leading example for κ (x, y)
is obtained by choosing
κ (x, y) = β xα y α ,
where α, β are positive constants, that is by taking the incidence rate dependent on the product of
the number of contacts of susceptible and infected people. When α = 1, for example, the incidence
rate takes the simpler form
K (fS , fI )(x, t) = β xfS (x, t)xI (t) I(t).

(5)

Let observe that with the choices done, the spreading of the epidemic depends heavily on the
function κ (·, ·) used to quantify the rate of possible contagion in terms of the number of social
contacts between the classes of susceptible and infected.
In our combined epidemic contact model (3), the operators QJ , J ∈ {S, I, R} characterize the
thermalization of the distribution of social contacts in the various classes. To that aim, let observe
that the evolution of the mass fractions J(t), J ∈ {S, I, R} obeys to a classical SIR model by
choosing QS ≡ 0 and κ (x, y) ≡ β > 0, thus considering the spreading of the disease independent
of the intensity of social contacts.
The QJ , J ∈ {S, I, R} are integral operators that modify the distribution of contacts fJ (x, t),
J ∈ {S, I, R} through repeated interactions among individuals [18, 49]. Their action on observable
quantities ϕ(x) is given by

where B(x) measures the interaction frequency, h·i denotes mathematical expectation with respect
to a random quantity, and x∗J denotes the updated value of the number x of social contacts of the
J-th population as a result of an interaction. We discuss in the sequel the construction of the social
contact model.

2.1

On the distribution of social contacts

The process of formation of the distribution of social contacts is obtained by taking into account the typical aspects of human being, in particular the search, in absence of epidemics, of
opportunities for socialization. In addition to that, social contacts are due to the common use of
public transportations to reach schools, offices and, in general, places of work as well as to basic
needs of interactions due to work duties. As shown in [5], this leads individuals to stabilize on a
characteristic number of daily contacts depending on the social habits of a country. This quantity
is represented in the following by a suitable value x̄M , which can be considered as the mean number
of contacts relative to the population under investigation. This kind of dynamics and the relative
distribution of average daily contacts observed in [5] is the one we aim to explain and reproduce in
our model.
As a final result of our investigation, we look to a characterization of the distribution of social
contacts in a multi-agent system, the so-called macroscopic behavior. This can be obtained starting
from some universal assumption about the personal behavior of the single agents, i.e. from the
microscopic behavior. Indeed, as in many other human activities, the daily amount of social
contacts is the result of a repeated upgrading based on well-established rules. To this extent, it is
enough to recall that the daily life of each person is based on a certain number of activities, and
each activity carries a certain number of contacts. Moreover, for any given activity, the number of
social contacts varies in consequence of the personal choice. The typical example is the use or not of
public transportations to reach the place of work or the social attitudes which scales with the age.
Clearly, independently of the personal choices or needs, the number of daily social contacts contains
a certain amount of randomness, that has to be taken into account. Also, while it is very easy to

5

reach a high number of social contacts attending crowded places for need or will, going below a
given threshold is very difficult, since various contacts are forced by working or school activities,
among others causes. This asymmetry between growth and decrease, as exhaustively discussed
in [18,31], can be suitably modeled by resorting to a so-called value function [33] description of the
elementary variation of the x variable measuring the average number of daily contacts. We will
come back to the definition of the value function later in the section.
Remark 1. It is important to outline that, in presence of an epidemic, the characteristic mean
number of daily contacts x̄M reasonably changes in time, even in absence of an external lockdown
intervention, in reason of the perception of danger linked to social contacts. Consequently, even if
not always explicitly indicated, we will assume x̄M = x̄M (t).
Furthermore, an important aspect of the formation of the number of social contacts is that their
frequency is not uniform with respect to the values of x. Indeed, it is reasonable to assume that the
frequency of interactions is inversely proportional to the number of contacts x. This relationship
takes into account that it is highly probable to have at least some contacts, and the rare situation
in which one reaches a very high values of contacts x  x̄M . On this subject, we mention a
related approach discussed in [26]. The introduction of a variable kernel B(x) into the kinetic
equation does not modify the shape of the equilibrium density as shown later, but it allows a better
physical description of the phenomenon under study, including an exponential rate of relaxation to
equilibrium for the underlying Fokker-Planck type equation derived from the kinetic equation that
it we will introduced next in 2.2.
Following [18, 31, 49], we will now illustrate the mathematical formulation of the previously
discussed behavior. In full generality, we assume that individuals in different classes can have a
different mean number of contacts. Then, the microscopic updates of social contacts of individuals
in the class J ∈ {S, I, R} will be taken of the form
x∗J = x − Φ (x/x̄J )x + η x.

(7)

In a single update (interaction), the number x of contacts can be modified for two reasons, expressed
by two terms, both proportional to the value x. In the first one, the coefficient Φ (·), which takes
both positive and negative values, characterizes the typical and predictable variation of the social
contacts of agents, namely the personal social behavior of agents. The second term takes into
account a certain amount of unpredictability in the process. A frequent choice in this setting
consists in assuming that the random variable η is of zero mean and bounded variance of order
 > 0, expressed by hη i = 0, hη2 i = λ, with λ > 0. Furthermore, we assume that η has finite
moments up to order three.
The function Φ plays the role of the value function in the prospect theory of Kahneman and
Tversky [33, 34], and contains the mathematical details of the expected human behavior in the
phenomenon under consideration. In particular, the main hypothesis on which this function is
built is that, in relationship with the mean value x̄J , J ∈ {S, I, R}, it is considered normally easier
to increase the value of x (individuals look for larger networks) than to decrease it (people maintain
as much connections as possible). In terms of the variable s = x/x̄J we consider then as in [18] the
class of value functions obeying to the above general rule given by
δ

Φδ (s) = µ

e(s −1)/δ − 1
,
e(sδ −1)/δ + 1

s ≥ 0,

(8)

where the value µ denotes the maximal amount of variation of x that agents will be able to obtain
in a single interaction, 0 < δ ≤ 1 is a suitable constant characterizing the intensity of the individual
behavior, while  > 0 is related to the intensity of the interaction. Hence, the choice   1
corresponds to small variations of the mean difference hx∗J − xi. Thus, if both effects, randomness
and adaptation are scaled with this interaction intensity , it is possible to equilibrate their effects
as we will show in Section 2.2 and obtain a stationary distribution of contacts. Note also that the
value function Φδ (s) is such that
−µ ≤ Φδ (s) ≤ µ

6

and clearly, the choice µ < 1 implies that, in absence of randomness, the value of x∗J remains
positive if x is positive.
Once the elementary interaction (7) is given, for any choice of the value function, the study
of the time-evolution of the distribution of the number x of social contacts follows by resorting to
kinetic collision-like approaches [12,43], that quantify at any given time the variation of the density
of the contact variable x in terms of the interaction operators.
Thus, for a given density fJ (x, t), J ∈ {S, I, R}, we can measure the action on the density of
the interaction operators QJ (f )(x, t) in equations (3) fruitfully written in weak form. This form
corresponds to say that for all smooth functions ϕ(x) (the observable quantities) we have

dt R+
R+
Here, the expectation h·i takes into account the presence of the random parameter η in the microscopic interaction (7) while the function B(x), as already discussed, measures the interaction
frequency. The right-hand side of equation (9) quantifies the variation in density, at a given time
t > 0, of individuals in the class J ∈ {S, I, R} that modify their value from x to x∗J (loss term
with negative sign) and agents that change their value from x∗J to x (gain term with positive sign).
In many situations, the interaction kernel B(x) can been assumed constant [18]. This simplifying
hypothesis is not always well justified from a modeling point of view and thus in this work, we
consider instead a non constant collision kernel B(x) (see [26] for a discussion on this aspect).
Thus, following the approach in [26, 49], we express the mathematical form of the kernel B(x) by
assuming that the frequency of changes in the number of social contacts depends on x itself through
the following law
B(x) = x−b ,
for some constant b > 0. This kernel assigns a low probability to interactions in which individuals
have already a large number of contacts and assigns a high probability to interactions when the
value of the variable x is small. The constants a and b can be suitably chosen by resorting to
the following argument [49]. For small values of the x variable, the rate of variation of the value
function (8) is given by

Hence, for small values of x, the mean individual rate predicted by the value function is proportional
to xδ−1 . Then, the choice b = δ would correspond to a collective rate of variation of the system
independent of the parameter δ which instead characterizes the individual rate of variation of the
value function.
In the next section, we investigate the steady states of the interaction operators QJ (f )(x, t), J ∈
{S, I, R} which permit to derive the macroscopic epidemic model containing the effects of social
interactions among individuals described in Section 3.

Asymptotic scaling and steady states

Let us focus on the sole social contact dynamic and introduce a time scaling
τ = t,

fJ, (x, τ ) = fJ (x, τ /),

J ∈ {S, I, R}.

which, in the following, will permit to separate the scale of the epidemic from the time scale at
which, by hypothesis, the social contacts acts. Then, as a result of the scaling, the distribution fJ,
is solution to

case in which elementary interactions (7) produces extremely small modification of the number of

Consequently, the actions of both the value function and the random part of the elementary interaction in (7) survive in the limit  → 0. Let observe that the limit procedure induced by (12)
corresponds precisely to the situation of small interactions while, at the same time, the time scale of
the dynamics is suitably scaled to see their effects. In kinetic theory, this is a well-known procedure
with the name of grazing limit, we point the interested reader to [15,25,43] for further details. Since
if   1 the difference x∗J − x is small and, assuming ϕ ∈ C0 , we can perform the following Taylor
expansion

It has to be remarked that the shape χ is positive, only if the constant ν = µ/λ satisfies the bound

Note that condition (18) holds, independently of δ, when µ ≥ λ4 , namely when the variance of the
random variation in (7) is small with respect to the maximal variation of the value function. Note
moreover that for all values δ > 0 the moments are expressed in terms of the parameters denoting
respectively the mean x̄J , J ∈ {S, I, R}, the variance λ of the random effects and the values δ and
µ characterizing the value function φδ defined in (8). Finally, the standard Gamma and Weibull
distributions are included in (15), and are obtained by choosing δ = 1 and, respectively δ = χ. In
both cases, the shape χ = ν, and no conditions are required for its positivity. It is important to
notice that the function (16) expressing the equilibrium distribution of the daily social contacts in a
society is in agreement with the one observed in [5]. This was one of the goals of our investigation.

The macroscopic social-SIR dynamics

Once we have obtained the characterization of the equilibrium distribution of the transition operators QJ , J ∈ {S, I, R}, we are ready to study the complete system (3). In the rest of this section
we will determine the observable macroscopic equations of the introduced kinetic model.

3.1

Derivation of moment based systems

The assumption that the dynamics leading to the contact formation is much faster than the epidemic
dynamics corresponds to consider β = β in (4) and γ = γ with β, γ > 0, being   1 the
scaling parameter introduced in the previous section. After introducing the scaled distributions

The system (19) is complemented with the boundary conditions (13) at x = 0 and it contains all the
information on the spreading of the epidemic in terms of the distribution of social contacts. Indeed,
the knowledge of the densities fJ (x, t), J ∈ {S, I, R}, allows to evaluate by integrations all moments
of interest. However, in reason of the presence of the incidence rate K(fS , fI ), as given by (4), the
time evolution of the moments of the distribution functions is not explicitly computable, since the
evolution of a moment of a certain order depends on the knowledge of higher order moments, thus
producing a hierarchy of equations, like in classical kinetic theory of rarefied gases [12].
Before discussing the closure, i.e. how to obtain a closed set of macroscopic equations, we
establish some choices in the model in order to obtain results which are in agreement with the ones
reported in [5]. To that aim, we fix the value δ = 1, and the incidence rate as in (5). In particular,
the choice δ = 1 gives, for J ∈ {S, I, R}

Following the observations of Remark 1 we can now assume x̄J = xJ (t). Also, this time dependent
value can be different depending on the class to which agents belong. In order to obtain the time
evolution of the macroscopic observable quantities like densities and local means from the kinetic
model (19), we now consider the Fokker–Planck operator (20) which vanishes in correspondence to
a time-dependent Gamma density equilibrium with mean xJ (t). With these notations, system (19)
with δ = 1 reads

Integrating both sides of equations in (23) with respect to x, and recalling that, in presence
of boundary conditions of type (13) the Fokker-Planck type operators are mass and momentum
preserving, we obtain the system for the evolution of the fractions J defined in (1), J ∈ {S, I, R}
dS(t)

where we have restored the macroscopic time variable t ≥ 0. As anticipated, unlike the classical
SIR model, system (24) is not closed, since the evolution of the mass fractions J(t), J ∈ {S, I, R},
depends on the evolution of the local mean values xJ (t). The closure of system (24) can be obtained
by resorting, at least formally, on a limit procedure. In fact, as outlined in the Introduction,
the typical time scale involved in the social contact dynamics is   1 which identifies a faster

10

adaptation of individuals to social contacts with respect to the evolution time of the epidemic
disease. Consequently, the choice of the value   1 pushes the distribution function fJ (x, t),
J ∈ {S, I, R} towards the Gamma equilibrium density with a mass fraction S(t), respectively I(t)
and R(t), and local mean value xS (t), respectively xI (t) and xR (t), as it can be easily verified from
the differential expression of the interaction operators Q1J , J ∈ {S, I, R}.
Indeed, if   1 is sufficiently small, one can easily argue from the exponential convergence
of the solution of the Fokker-Planck equation towards the equilibrium fS∞ (x; θ, ν) (see [50] for
details), that the solution fS (x, t) remains sufficiently close to the Gamma density with mass S(t)
and local mean density given by xS (t) for all times. This equilibrium distribution fS∞ (x; θ, ν) can
then be plugged into the first equation of (23). Successively, by multiplying by x both sides of this
equation (23) and integrating it with respect to the variable x, since the Fokker–Planck operator
on the right-hand side is momentum-preserving, one obtains that the mean xS (t)S(t) satisfies the
differential equation
d
(xS (t)S(t)) = −β xS,2 (t)xI (t)S(t)I(t),
dt
which depends now on the second order moment. However, it is now possible to close this expression
by using the energy of the local equilibrium distribution, which can be expressed in terms of the
mean value as in (22) as follows
ν+1 2
xS (t).
xS,2 (t) =

Therefore, we have
S(t)

where the time evolution of the fraction S(t) can be recovered by the first equation of system (24).
Hence, the evolution of the local mean value xS (t) satisfies the equation

(25)

An analogous procedure can be done with the second equation in system (23), which leads to
relaxation towards a Gamma density with mass fraction I(t) and local mean value given by xI (t),
and with the third equation in system (23). We easily obtain in this way the system that governs
the evolution of the local mean values of the social contacts of the classes of susceptible, infected
and recovered individuals

The closure of the kinetic system (3) around a Gamma-type equilibrium of social contacts leads
then to a system of six equations for the pairs of mass fractions J(t) and local mean values xJ (t),
J ∈ {S, I, R}. In the following, we refer to the coupled systems (24) and (26) as the social SIR
model (S-SIR). With respect to the classical epidemiological model from which we took inspiration,
the main novelty is represented by the presence of system (26), that describes the evolution of the
social contacts. It is immediate to conclude from the first equation of (26) that the local mean
number of contacts of the population of susceptible individuals decreases, thus showing that the
social answer to the presence of the pandemic is to reduce the number of social contacts. A maybe
unexpected behavior is present in the second equation of (26), which indicates that, at least in
the initial part of the time evolution of the S-SIR model, the class of infected individuals increases
the local mean number of social contacts. This effect must be read as a consequence of the more

11

Figure 1: Evolution of system (24)-(26) for ν = 0.5 and ν = 1.
probable transition from susceptible to infected of individuals with a high number of social contacts.
It is interesting to remark that system (26) is explicitly dependent on the positive parameter ν =
λ/σ, which measures the heterogeneity of the population in terms of the variance of the statistical
distribution of social contacts. More precisely, small values of the constant ν correspond to high
values of the variance, and thus to a larger heterogeneity of the individuals with respect to social
contacts. This is an important point which is widely present and studied in the epidemiological
literature [4,16,17]. Concerning the COVID-19 pandemic, the influence of population heterogeneity
on herd immunity has been recently quantified in [9] by testing a SEIR model on different types of
populations categorized by different ages and/or different activity levels, thus expressing different
levels of heterogeneity.
A limiting case of system (26) is obtained by letting the parameter ν → +∞, which corresponds
to push the variance to zero (absence of heterogeneity). In this case, if the whole population starts
with a common number of daily contacts, say x̄, it is immediate to show that the number of
contacts remains fixed in time, thus reducing system (24) to a classical SIR model with contact
rate β x̄2 . Hence this classical epidemiological model is contained in (24)-(26) and corresponds to
consider the non realistic case of a population that, regardless of the presence of the epidemic,
maintains the same fixed number of daily contacts. The described behaviors are exemplified in
Figure 1 where we considered S(0) = 0.98, I(0) = R(0) = 0.01 and mean number of contacts
xS (0) = xI (0) = xR (0) = 15 for two choices ν = 0.5 and ν = 1. We can easily observe how
the number of recovered is affected by contact heterogeneity: the smaller the heterogeneity is, the
larger the population recovers from the pandemic.
Remark 2. The derivation leading to systems (24) and (26) can be easily generalized to local
incidence rates (4) with a contact function of the form κ(x, y) = βxα y α with α 6= 1. In this case,
however, we do not have an explicit formula which connects the moment of order α of the Gamma
density with the moment of order α + 1. Also, the procedure can be applied to equilibria which
are different from the Gamma density considered here, provided this density has enough moments
bounded.
Remark 3. The approach just described can be easily adapted to other compartmental models in
epidemiology like SEIR, MSEIR [8, 17, 32] and/or SIDHARTE [29, 30]. For all these cited models,
the fundamental aspects of the interaction between social contacts and the spread of the infectious
disease we expect not to change in a substantial way.

3.2

A social-SIR model with saturated incidence rate

The system (24)-(26) is a model for describing the time evolution of an epidemic in terms of the
statistical distribution of social contacts, without taking into account any external intervention.
However, protection measures such as lockdown strategies inevitably cause reduction in the average
number of social contacts of the population which can be taken explicitly into account in our model.
In the epidemiological literature, a natural way to introduce this mechanism, which dates from the
work of Capasso and Serio [11], consists in considering a non linear incidence rate whose main
feature is to be bounded with respect to the number of infected. Interestingly, on this subject, we
aim to highlight that a similar behavior of the incidence rate can be directly derived starting from
our social-SIR model (24)-(26). The additional hypothesis that is sufficient to introduce is that
the average number x̃I of social contacts of infected is frozen as an effect, for instance, of external
interventions aimed in controlling the pandemic spread. If this is the case, one can explicitly solve
the first equation of system (26), which now reads
β
dxS (t)
= − xS (t)2 x̃I I(t),

(27)

due to the fact that xI (t) = xI (t = 0) = x̃I . The exact solution of the equation (27) can then be
computed and it gives

Numerical experiments

In addition to analytic expressions, numerical experiments allow us to visualize and quantify the
effects of social contacts on the SIR dynamics used to describe the time evolution of the epidemic.
More precisely, starting from a given equilibrium distribution detailing in a probability setting the
daily number of contacts of the population, we show how the coupling between social behaviors
and number of infected people may modify the epidemic by slowing down the number of encounters
leading to infection. In a second part, we discuss how some external forcing, mimicking political
choices and acting on restrictions on the mobility, may additionally improve the reduction of the
epidemic trend avoiding concentration in time of people affected by the disease and then decreasing
the probability of hospitalization peaks. In a third part, we focus on experimental data for the
specific case of COVID-19 in different European countries and we extrapolate from them the main
features characterizing the contact function H(·).

4.1

Test 1: On the effects of the social contacts on the epidemic dynamics

We solve the social-SIR kinetic system (23). The starting point is represented by a population
composed of 99.99% of susceptibles and 0.01% of infected. The distribution of the number of
contact is described by (15) with ν = 1.65, δ = 1 and xJ = 10.25 in agreement with [5] while the
epidemic parameters are β = 0.25/x2J and γ = 0.1. The kinetic model (19) is solved by a splitting
strategy together with a Monte Carlo approach where the number of samples used to described the
population is fixed to M = 106 . The time step is fixed to ∆t = 10−2 and the scaling parameter

is τ = 10−2 . These choices are enough to observe the convergence of the Boltzmann dynamics
to the Fokker-Planck one as shown in Figure 2 where the analytical equilibrium distribution is
plotted together with the results of the Boltzmann dynamics. We considered also uniform initial
distribution
1
χ(x ∈ [0, c]), c = 20,
(36)

being χ(·) the indicator function. In the introduced setting, we then compare two distinct cases: in
the first one we suppose that nonlinear effects in the contacts dynamics do not modify the contact
rate, meaning H(I(t), t) = 1, while the second includes the effects of the function H(I(t), t) given
in (32) with α = 10. The results are depicted in Figure 3. The top right images show the time
evolution of the distribution of the number of contacts for the two distinct cases, while the middle
images report the corresponding evolution of the epidemic. For this the second case, the function
H(I(t), t) as well as the distribution of contacts for respectively the susceptible and the recovered
are shown at the bottom of the same figure. We clearly observe a reduction of the peak of infected
in the case in which the dynamics depends on the number of contacts with H(I(t), t) given by (32).
We also observe a spread of the number of infected over time when sociality reduction is taken into
account.
f0 (x) =

Test 2: Forcing a change in the social attitudes.

Next, we compare the effects on the spread of the disease when the population adapts its habits
with a time delay with respect to the onset of the epidemic. This kind of dynamics corresponds to a
modeling of a possible lockdown strategy whose effects are to reduce the mobility of the population
and, correspondingly, to reduce the number of daily contacts in the population.
The setting is similar to the one introduced in Section 4.1 and we consider a switch between
H = 1 to H(I(t)) = 1/(1 + αI(t)) when the number of infected increases. The social parameters
are ν = 1.65, δ = 1 and xJ = 10.25, as before, while the epidemic parameters are β = 0.25/x2J and
γ = 0.1, the final time is fixed to T = 70. The initial distribution of contacts is also assumed to be
of the form (36).
We consider three different settings, in the first one H = 1 up to t < T /4, in the second one up
to t < T /2 while in the third one we prescribe a lockdown for a limited amount of time (5 < t < 15)
and then we relax back to H = 1. The results are shown in Figure 4 for both the distribution of
daily contacts over time and the SIR evolution. We can identify three scenarios. The first on
the top causes a clear change to the epidemic dynamic, an inversion around t = 20 happens. For
the second, we observe a reduction of the speed of the infection, while for the third case we first
observe inversion and then the resurgence of the number of infected when the lockdown measures
are relaxed.

4.3

Test 3: Extrapolation of the contact function from data

In this part, we consider data about the dynamics of COVID-19 in three European countries:
France, Italy and Spain. For these three countries, the evolution of the disease, in terms of reported cases, evolved in rather different ways. The estimation of epidemiological parameters of
compartmental models is an inverse problem of generally difficult solution for which different approaches can be considered. We mention in this direction a very recent comparison study [39]. It
is also worth to mention that often the data are partial and heterogeneous with respect to their
assimilation, see for instance discussions in [1,10,13,47]. This makes the fitting problem challenging
and the results naturally affected by uncertainty.
The data concerning the actual number of infected, recovered and deaths of COVID-19 are
publicly available from the John Hopkins University GitHub repository [21]. For the specific case of
Italy, we considered instead the GitHub repository of the Italian Civil Protection Department [44].
In the following, we present the adopted approach which is based on a strategy with two optimisation

horizons (pre-lockdown and lockdown time spans) depending on the different strategies enacted by
the governments of the considered European countries.
In details, we considered first the time interval t ∈ [t0 , t` ], being t` the day in which lockdown
started in each country (Spain, Italy and France) and t0 the day in which the reported cases hit
200 units. The lower bound t0 has been imposed to reduce the effects of fluctuations caused by
the way in which data are measured which have a stronger impact when the number of infected is
low. Once the time span has been fixed, we then considered a least square problem based on the
minimization of a cost functional J which takes into account the relative L2 norm of the difference
ˆ
ˆ + R̂(t) and the
between the reported number of infected and the reported total cases I(t),
I(t)
evolution of I(t) and I(t) + R(t) prescribed by system (30) with H ≡ 1. In practice, we solved the
following constrained optimisation problem
ˆ R̂, I, R)
minβ,γ J (I,

where the cost functional J is a convex combination of the mentioned norms and assumes the
following form

We choose p = 0.1 and we look for a minimum under the constraints
0 ≤ β ≤ 0.6,

0.04 ≤ γ ≤ 0.06.

In Table 1 we report the results of the performed parameter estimation together with the resulting
reproduction number R0 defined in (??).

Once that the contagion parameters have been estimated in the pre-lockdown time span, we
successively proceeded with the estimation of the shape of the function H from the data. To
estimate this latter quantity, we solved the following optimization problem
minH J

(38)

in terms of H where J is the same functional of the previous step and where in the evolution of
the macroscopic model the values β, γ have been fixed as a result of the first optimization in the
pre-lockdown period. The parameters chosen for (38) are p = 0.1 while the constraint is
0 ≤ H ≤ 1.
The second optimisation problem has been solved up to last available data for each country with
daily time stepping h = 1 and over a time window of three days. This has been done with the
scope of regularizing possible errors due to late reported infected and smoothing the shape of H.
Both optimisation problems (37)-(38) have been tackled using the Matlab functions fmincon in
combination with a RK4 integration method of the system of ODEs.
In Figure 5, we present the result of such fitting procedure between the model (30) and the
experimental data. The evolution of the estimated H(t), t ∈ [t` , T ], is instead presented in the left
column of Figure 6. From this figure, it can be observed in the case of Italy how, even if the daily
number of infected decreases after May 1st, the estimated H remains quite stable after this day.
This behavior cannot be reproduced by using a function H(I(t)) as the one given in (??). Instead,
a function H(t, I(t)) of the form (31), which takes into account both the instantaneous
number of
P
confirmed infections N I(t) and the total number of infected in the population N s<t I(s) up to
time t, is able to better better fit the observed results. In fact, it appears that taking into account
possible memory effects on the contact function is a good path to follow. In the right column
of Figure 5, the two
P discussed contact functions have been denoted with H1 = H1 (N I(t)) and
H2 = H2 (t, N I(t) s<t I(s)). Both are assumed of the form

A least square minimization approach has been finally developed to determine a > 0, b ∈ R that
best fit the estimated curve whose results are presented in Table 2. We can easily observe in the
right column of Figure 6 how the function H2 is capable to better explain the estimated values of H
especially after the epidemic peak. To evaluate the goodness of fit we can finally use the so-called
coefficient R2 , as reported in Table 2. Results show that the function H2 appears more suitable in
terms of the fitting results for all tested situations. This fact may indicate that people are rather
fast to apply social distancing, and therefore to reduce their average number of contacts, whereas
they tend to restore the pre-pandemic average contact rate more slowly, possibly due to further
memory effects.

Test 4: S-SIR model with fitted contact function

In this last part, we discuss the results of the S-SIR model when the contact function has the shape
extrapolated in the previous paragraph. In particular, we devoted it to show whether the obtained
extrapolated function H, which depends on the product between the current number of infected
and the total number of infected, produces qualitative trends that are in agreement with the data.
As discussed in Section 4.3, it appears that the curve of infection may be better explained in
the case in which the contact function is both a function of the instantaneous number of infected
and of the total number of people that contracted the disease up to time t. In order to compare
qualitatively the observed curve of infected and the theoretical one, we consider the following setting
for the three countries under study: ν = 4, δ = 8 and xJ = 15, ∆t = 0.01, τ = 0.01, M = 105 .

coefficient is also reported.
Moreover, we suppose S(t = 0) and I(t = 0) to match the relative number of susceptible and
infected of each country at the time in which we start our comparison. Finally, we consider

where we use the parameters of Table 2 that we recall here for the seek of clarity: (a, b) = (1.41, 0.15)
in the case of France, and (a, b) = (0.017, 0.25) in the case of Italy. The case of Spain will be
discussed later.
In Figure 7 we show the profiles of the infected over time together with the shape of the function
H again over time. The results show that with the choices done for the contact function, it is possible
to reproduce at least qualitatively the shape of the trend of infected during the pandemic observed
in Italy and in France.
It is worth to remark that the considered social parameters have been estimated only the in
the case of France, see [5], and we assumed that the initial contact distribution is the same for the
Italian case. We now consider the case of Spain. For this country, according to Figure 5, the trend
of infected undergoes a deceleration during the lockdown period. This can be also clearly observed
in Figure 6 where the extrapolated shape of the contact function H is shown. Let also observe that
while the global behavior of this function is captured by the fitting procedure, we however lose the
minimum which takes place around end of April. This minimum is responsible of the deceleration
in the number of infected and can be brought back to a strong external intervention in the lifestyle
of Spain country with the scope of reducing the hospitalizations. This effect can be reproduced by
our model by imposing the same behavior in the function H. To that aim, the Figure 8 reports
finally the profile of the infected over time together with the shape of the function H again over
time for this last case. The results show that also in this case, the S-SIR model is capable to
qualitatively reproduce the data.

Conclusions
The development of strategies for mitigating the spreading of a pandemic is an important public
health priority. The recent case of COVID-19 pandemic has seen as main strategy restrictive measures on the social contacts of the population, obtained by household quarantine, school or workplace
closure, restrictions on travels, and, ultimately, a total lockdown. Mathematical models represent
powerful tools for a better understanding of this complex landscape of intervention strategies and

for a precise quantification of the relationships between potential costs and benefits of different options [22]. In this direction, we introduced a system of kinetic equations coupling the distribution
of social contacts with the spreading of a pandemic driven by the rules of the SIR model, aiming
to explicitly quantify the mitigation of the pandemic in terms of the reduction of the number of
social contacts of individuals. The kinetic modeling of the statistical distribution of social contacts
has been developed according to the recent results in [5], which present an exhaustive description
of contacts in the France population, divided by categories. The numerical experiments then show
that the kinetic system is able to capture most of the phenomena related to the effects of partial
lockdown strategies, and, eventually to maintain pandemic under control.
