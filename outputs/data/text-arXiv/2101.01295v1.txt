Abstract
Randomized vaccine trials are used to assess vaccine efficacy and to characterize the
durability of vaccine induced protection. There is a broad consensus that placebo volunteers in COVID-19 vaccine trials should be offered a vaccine once efficacy has been
established. This will likely lead to most placebo volunteers crossing over to the vaccine
arm, thus complicating the assessment of long term durability. We show how to analyze
durability following placebo crossover and demonstrate that the vaccine efficacy profile
that would be observed in a placebo controlled trial is recoverable in a trial with placebo
crossover. This result holds no matter when the crossover occurs and with no assumptions
about the form of the efficacy profile. We only require that the vaccine efficacy profile
applies to the newly vaccinated irrespective of the timing of vaccination. We develop
different methods to estimate efficacy within the context of a proportional hazards regression model and explore the implications of placebo crossover for estimation of vaccine
efficacy under different efficacy dynamics and study designs via simulation. We apply our
methods to simulated COVID-19 vaccine trials with durable and waning vaccine efficacy
and a total follow-up of 2 years.

Introduction

Randomized phase III clinical trials are used to definitively demonstrate the efficacy of candidate
vaccines. Volunteers are randomized to receive vaccine or a placebo and followed for a period
of time to assess whether the vaccine reduces the rate of disease. An important question in
vaccine development is whether vaccine induced protection is durable. For COVID-19 vaccines,
questions surrounding vaccine durability are particularly salient as acquired immunity against
seasonal and other coronaviruses ranges from 6 months to 2 years (Poland et al., 2020, Choe
et al., 2020). Clinical trials for vaccines against COVID-19 have planned to follow participants
for up to two years, (Moderna, 2020).
To assess long term safety and durability, long term blinded follow-up of the original placebo
and vaccine arms is ideal (World Health Organization, 2020). From an ethical perspective,
placebo volunteers should be offered a vaccine once efficacy is established (Wendler et al.,
2020). However, vaccination of placebo volunteers may occur before it is known whether vaccine
induced protection is durable. Besides waning of efficacy, there is concern that the vaccine might
eventually cause harm in subgroups. Such harm is known as vaccine associated enhanced disease
(VAED) and has been observed in other contexts, such as the Dengvaxia vaccine in seronegative
individuals (Sridhar et al., 2018). Finally, crossover may occur before reliable estimates of
vaccine efficacy can be assessed in subgroups or for rarer events such as severe disease.
It might seem that the ability to assess vaccine durability following placebo crossover is
completely lost once there is no longer an unvaccinated comparator group (World Health Organization, 2020). However, at the point of crossover the study remains a randomized trial, albeit
of immediate vs deferred vaccination. In fact, the VE profile for a standard non-crossover trial
can be recovered with placebo crossover under fairly mild conditions (Follmann et al., 2020).
The only additional assumption we require in the placebo crossover setting, beyond the typical
assumptions for a standard parallel-arm trial, is that the same VE profile applies to the newly
vaccinated irrespective of the timing of vaccination.
Crossover trials for absorbing endpoints, such as infection or death, have been discussed in
the literature (Nason and Follmann, 2010, Makubate and Senn, 2010). However, these methods
apply to estimation of an overall intervention effect when the benefit of the intervention stops
once a drug is no longer administered. Vaccination is quite different as the benefit lingers and
our goal is to see how the intervention effect varies with time. Crossover has been discussed for
vaccine trials, but only for the placebo arm and only to measure immune response (Follmann,
2006). Delayed vaccination has been used in an Ebola vaccine trial, but to serve as control
group prior to deferred vaccination (Henao-Restrepo et al., 2017).
Statistically, VE can be estimated using the Cox proportional hazards (PH) model (Cox,
1972), where it is minus the hazard ratio for disease on vaccine compared to placebo. It is
straightforward to allow VE to depend on time through use of time-varying covariates (Therneau
and Grambsch, 2013). Proportional hazard models can accommodate a variety of efficacy
profiles, including simple linear and piecewise–constant trends, or smooth functions that can
be estimated semi–parametrically. The added flexibility of semi–parametric methods comes
at the cost of greater sample size requirements, which may be compounded by the loss of the
placebo arm following crossover. Hence, it is important to consider the implications of placebo
crossover and other aspects of study design on the precision of VE estimates.
Our contributions in this work are threefold: first, we establish that vaccine durability can
be accurately assessed following placebo crossover under fairly mild assumptions. This result
has immediate implications for the conduct and analysis of ongoing COVID-19 vaccine trials.
2

We demonstrate how to estimate VE under placebo crossover using PH regression and develop
model–based estimates for estimating the VE profile using log-linear and P-spline functions
of the time since vaccination. We also provide a justification for using calendar time as the
natural timescale in VE models. Second, we explore the implications of different aspects of
study design and efficacy dynamics for estimation. We are particularly interested in how the
pace of crossover and unspecified heterogeneity in risk affect estimation in placebo crossover
and standard parallel trials. We demonstrate that placebo crossover with continued follow-up
provides unambiguously better estimates than would be obtained if a trial were to be stopped
early without further monitoring. This provides assurance that pre-crossover VE estimated
in subgroups and for severe disease can be improved post-crossover. Finally, we apply our
methods to two simulated COVID-19 vaccine trials that cross over after efficacy is established
to illustrate practical issues in implementation for constant and waning VE scenarios.

2.1

Vaccine Efficacy Under Placebo Crossover
Conceptual Development

Consider a vaccine trial where volunteers are randomized to receive vaccine or placebo. For
now, we assume that all are participants are enrolled at the same time and followed for a period
of time, [0, 2τ ]. Suppose that a blinded crossover occurs at time τ , at which point the original
vaccinees receive placebo and original placebos receive vaccine. Following crossover, both arms
are vaccinated and thus comparative efficacy might seem lost as there is no control group.
However, a randomized trial remains, but now as trial of immediate vs delayed vaccination; these
assignments correspond to the original vaccine and placebo arms. This ’rebranded’ randomized
trial can still provide information about safety and durability.
To illustrate, suppose we have case counts for the two randomization arms over the two
periods, (0, τ ] and (τ, 2τ ]. Suppose that the vaccine–placebo case split is 20 to 100 in period
one, and in period two we observe 20 cases in the Vaccine versus 12 on the placebo–turned–
vaccine arm. Using a person-time analysis, and imagining the denominators are so large that
d
they cancel out, we obtain a simple estimate of the period one VE as V
E 1 = 1 − 20/100 = 0.80.
Suppose now that this VE applies to the newly vaccinated participants in the second period.
The 12 placebo cases observed in period two represent 20% of the cases we would have expected
had the placebo group not been vaccinated. A simple counterfactual estimate of the placebo
case count, absent vaccination, divides the period two placebo case count by the case suppression
b2plac = 12/0.2 = 60. We contrast the counterfactual placebo case count of 60 to the eight
rate: N
d
observed cases in the Vaccine to obtain an estimate of VE in period two, V
E 2 = 1 − 20/60.
Based on these crude estimates, we conclude that VE has waned as efficacy has dropped from
80% in period one to 66.7% in period two.
The crux of this example is that VE depends on time since vaccination. By virtue of the
study randomization, the placebo can be assumed to receive the same immediate benefit from
vaccination that the original vaccine group received, regardless of changes in the population
attack rate. Additional considerations are discussed in Follmann et al. (2020). For our purposes,
a similar analysis can be carried out in a more flexible PH framework.
In the Cox PH model, the baseline placebo hazard function for the time to disease is an
arbitrary function and the hazard for participant i is proportional to the baseline hazard:
hi (t) = h0 (t) exp(Zi θ),
3

(1)

where h0 (t) is the placebo hazard function, and Zi is the vaccine assignment indicator. Vaccine
efficacy is defined as the change in the instantaneous risk of acquiring disease due to vaccination,
and is calculated as 1 − exp(θ). Model (1) can be fit to data from all study volunteers to obtain
an estimate of overall VE, and can also be applied to subgroups or to different events (e.g.
infection, severe disease) to provide a more complete picture of a vaccine’s effects.
(v)
Suppose we want to assess whether VE changes at time τ post vaccination. Let τi denote
the vaccination time for participant i. We can extend the PH model to include a time-varying
vaccine parameter, θ(t), that may vary with time since vaccination:
(
(v)
θ1 , t − τi < τ,
hi (t) = λ0 (t) exp[Zi (t)θ(t)], θ(t) =
(2)
(v)
θ2 , t − τi ≥ τ,
where Zi (t) is an indicator for whether participant i is vaccinated at time t. We can calculate
the VE in T1 and T2 as 1 − exp(θ1 ) and 1 − exp(θ2 ), respectively.
More generally, we might suppose that vaccine efficacy decays smoothly and model the
decay linearly on the log-hazard scale. In this case,

hi (t) = λ0 (t) exp[Zi (t)θ(t)], θ(t) =

and V E(t) = 1 − exp θ1 + θ2 t − τ (v) , with τ (v) = 0 or τ (v) = τ . The log-hazard for (3) is
diagrammed in Figure 1 for a constant baseline hazard. Again, the key insight is that the data
are observations of the same decay profile.

the cumulative hazard and sampling event times for each participant via the inverse survival
distribution (Crowther and Lambert, 2013, Brilleman, 2019).

It is standard practice in clinical trials to index events by time on study. However, calendar
time is a more natural index for the Cox model in trials with an attack rate that vareis with
calendar time and staggered entry, as reflected in (4). Aligning the data on study entry distorts
the risk set in the Cox partial likelihood at each event time. This is diagrammed in Figure
2, where participant j, who is still at risk at ti , falls out of the risk set after we align the
data on study entry. By the same token, participant k is erroneously introduced into the risk
set. Furthermore, indexing the model by calendar time preserves our interpretation of vaccine
efficacy as the relative reduction in the hazard, ceteris paribus. Specifically, participants are
not guaranteed to be alike in their baseline hazards at each event time, and assuming otherwise
may lead to incorrect cancellation of baseline hazard terms in the partial likelihood.

and now the baseline hazards no longer cancel out. However, this will not be the case if we

2.3

Flexible Models for VE(t)

As a practical matter, we do not know the functional form of the decay profile, f (·). Two
simple approaches are to model f (·) as piecewise constant, or to assume a flexible parametric
form for the decay function. However, these approaches involve uncomfortable choices that we
may want to avoid. For instance, we might not have a basis for selecting change-points in the
piecewise constant approach. Or, in the parametric case, we may not want to assume that
V E(t) is monotonic or to rule out the possibility of VAED, e.g., if we assume that f (·) < 0.
We can model f (·) semi-parametrically, and there are a variety of ways in which such a
strategy could be pursued (Wood, 2017, Perperoglou et al., 2019). An attractive options is to
estimate f (·) using penalised cubic P-splines (Eilers and Marx, 1996). This is implemented in
the survival package in R, which provides users with a convenient summary method for the
linear and non–linear spline effects, which is useful for testing for non-linearity in the decay
profile. Let PL (t; k, δ) denote a P-spline basis of degree δ = 3 with L basis terms and vector of
knot locations k, and let γ be a vector of coefficients, with γ0 reserved for the log-hazard ratio
immediately following vaccination. The hazard for participant i is

In practice, we center the decay component estimated by the P-spline at zero to ensure identifiability of γ0 . Note that we need to evaluate the hazard for each participant at every event time,
7

not merely at the time when a person experiences their own event (Therneau et al., 2017). We
demonstrate how to fit this model in code provided in the GitHub repository linked at the end
of the manuscript.

Assumptions

To recover VE under a standard trial requires that the volunteers in each arm are similar over
time and that the external environment is similar over time. We elaborate below.
• Volunteers in each arm are similar over time. This can be violated if there is differential
dropout in the two arms and dropout is related to underlying risk of disease. Relatedly,
unobserved heterogeneity in risk can result in differential culling by infection of the vaccine
and placebo groups. Thus, after a while, the remaining placebos tend to be a less risky
group than the remaining vaccinees and the vaccine efficacy can appear to decrease, see
Lipsitch (2019), Durham et al. (1998), Aalen et al. (2015). COVID-19 trials with 30,000
or more enrolled and perhaps 200-1000 cases over follow-up, any such bias should be
small. In other settings, one could explicitly model the heterogeneity or integrate over
the frailty distribution (Kanaan and Farrington, 2002).
• Study environment similar. The proportional hazards model allows for the attack rate
to change with time. But if the pathogen mutates to a form that is resistant to vaccine
effects, efficacy may appear to wane. Another possibility is if human behavior changes in
such a way that the vaccine is less effective. For example, the viral innoculum at infection
may increase over the study and overwhelm the immune response for later cases. We
also want to guard against changes in assessment of endpoints that might favor one arm.
Suppose symptomatic disease is the primary endpoint, the vaccine has higher efficacy
against severe disease, but severe disease is assessed less vigorously later in the study.
Again, vaccine efficacy could appear to wane.
The only additional assumption that we require in order to recover VE under placebo
crossover is that the effect of vaccination is the same no matter when the vaccine is given. Interestingly, placebo crossover might ameliorate biases arising from violations to the assumptions
listed. For example, if the circulating virus mutates following crossover and VE has different,
but constant, efficacy for the two strains, we would deduce a constant VE with crossover but
not with a standard trial. In the absence of crossover, we would have difficulty differentiating
between a sieve effect, i.e., differential efficacy against the two strains, from equal, but waning,
efficacy against both strains.

Simulated COVID-19 Trials

In this section, we explore how placebo crossover, the dynamics of durability, and the baseline
hazard affect our estimates of vaccine efficacy and durability. Since several COVID-19 vaccine
trials are powered to accrue 150 cases and follow all volunteers for 2 years, we evaluate 5 different
designs: i) Quit at 150 cases, ii) Quit at 1 year, iii) crossover at 150 cases, iv) crossover at 1
year and v) a standard parallel arm trial (Moderna, 2020). We consider two settings for vaccine
dynamics: constant VE of 75%, and VE waning linearly on the log-hazard scale from 85%
to 35% over 1.5 years. In the crossover scenarios, placebos were crossed over during a four
8

week period. For each of the 10 settings we simulated 10,000 trials. Each trial enrolled 3,000
participants in a 1:1 randomization with linear accrual of participants over an initial three
month period and followed participants for two years post–vaccination. While COVID-19 trials
are larger, we chose 3,000 to lessen our computational burden and calibrated the event rates to
match rates that would be typical of larger real–world trials. In practice, COVID-19 vaccine
trials would also build interim monitoring into the study design, though we will ignore this
detail. The baseline hazard was piecewise-constant and calibrated to yield an average of 50,
75, 50, and 25 cases per three month period in the placebo arm in the first year, and either the
same or half the year one case rates in the second study year. The data were analyzed in each
simulation using the log-linear decay model, (3), and the P-spline model, (7).
We can accurately estimate VE and the change in VE in all simulation settings using both
the log-linear and P-spline model (Tables 1 and S1). Coverage probabilities of 95% confidence
intervals were near their nominal levels or somewhat conservative. The P-spline model performs
similarly to the log-linear model except for the estimates at year 2 where the variance becomes
notably larger. Initiating crossover at one year resulted in an average accrual of 44% more
cases prior to crossover compared with trials that initiated crossover at 150 cases. We found
that this improved the precision of our estimates for all quantities of interest. One way to
quantify the relative performance of placebo crossover and parallel arm trials is by the ratio
of empirical variances. If this ratio is 2, then a crossover trial would need to be twice as large
as a parallel trial to achieve the same precision. Consider the empirical variances of estimates
obtained with the log-linear model in the constant VE setting where the baseline hazard in year
two was half that in year one. The one year crossover versus parallel trial empirical variance
ratios for estimates of VE at 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 years post-vaccination are 1.1, 2.5, 2.3, and
2.0. With crossover at 150 cases the analogous ratios are 2.3, 6.1, 5.7, and 5.0, respectively.
This underscores the potential benefit of additional case accrual during the pre-crossover period
leading into the second year when the baseline hazard was halved.
In Table 2, we provide estimates of the intercept and linear trend of the VE profile. Unsurprisingly, stopping a trial at either the 150 case mark or at one year resulted in greater
uncertainty in the estimates compared with continued followup to two years. For the constant
vaccine efficacy scenario, we see that continued followup after crossing over at one year reduces
the empirical variance of the overall VE estimate from a constant VE model by 24%; 0.033 for
stopping at one year versus 0.028 when followup is continued. Even after a crossover decision is
made, we continue to accrue information about overall VE during the crossover interlude until
all placebo participants have been vaccinated. The improvements in precision of the intercept
and linear trend estimates under the log-linear model are even greater as the empirical variances are reduced by 67% and 88% with continued followup. Continued follow-up after placebo
crossover thus offers substantial improvements in addressing questions about vaccine durability,
safety, and efficacy in subgroups.
We next compare the crossover at one year design to a standard parallel trial using the
log-linear model. This comparison is more of a benchmark as a standard trial is not ethically
possible following vaccine approval. It is interesting that the intercept estimate is improved
by crossover compared to a standard trial with a variance ratio of 0.77 = 0.040/0.052. During
the crossover interlude, the newly vaccinated placebo volunteers contribute information to the
intercept. This does not happen in the standard parallel trial. The slope estimate is somewhat
more variable at a crossover of 1 year compared to a standard trial. Crossing over at 150 cases
results in less precise estimates of the intercept and, especially, of the linear trend compared
to crossing over at 1 year. Thus delaying crossover has real statistical advantages. Results are

Table 1: Summary statistics for estimates of vaccine efficacy (VE) and change in VE for simulated trials where the baseline hazard in year two was half the baseline hazard in year one. The
log-linear and P-spline models correspond to (3) and (7), respectively. We report the empirical
variances and coverage of 95% confidence intervals for estimates of VE and decay in VE. We
also report the average time of crossover (in years), τx , and the average number of events at
crossover, Nx , along with standard deviations beneath the crossover grouping in the design
column. Time is given in years since study initiation.

similar for the P-spline model and for the waning efficacy scenario.
A design question is how estimation efficiency varies with the length of the crossover interlude. If crossover is instantaneous, the intercept term immediately factors out of the partial
likelihood and additional information is not accrued. To explore this design question, we did
additional simulations where we evaluated a standard parallel trial of 2 years, a trial where all
placebo participants are crossed over at 1 year, and a trial where the times of vaccination for all
volunteers were uniformly distributed over 2 years. The baseline hazard was constant over the
2 year period. Under the constant VE scenario, the empirical variances for the intercept term
were 0.051, 0.035, 0.031, respectively while the variances for the slope were 0.039, 0.039, and
0.034 respectively (Table S3). This suggests a longer crossover interlude is somewhat better for
estimation of the intercept and the slope.
Unobserved heterogeneity in the risk of disease can lead to bias in estimates of VE and
complicate the task of separating time-varying efficacy from culling of the frailty distribution
(Balan and Putter, 2020). We simulated placebo crossover and parallel arm trials with 30,000
participants and gamma distributed frailties with mean one, and variance equal to either one
or four. Crossover trials initiated vaccination of the placebo arm at one year. The baseline
hazard was constant and calibrated to yield either 50 or 300 cases per six month period on the
placebo arm, and VE was either constant or waned linearly on the log hazard scale, as before.
The frailty distributions in the original placebo and vaccine arms at the end of followup were
more similar in the placebo crossover trials than in the standard parallel trials (Table S7). In
the low baseline hazard scenario, where the dominant contribution to a participant’s propensity
for disease was their underlying frailty, placebo crossover trials yielded less biased estimates of
VE relative to the standard parallel design (Tables S8 and S9). In the high baseline hazard
scenario, the common baseline hazard dominated heterogeneity in the frailty distribution, and
in this setting the bias in VE estimates under placebo crossover was comparable to the bias that
was observed with parallel trials. Higher baseline hazards resulted in more differential culling
of the risk set and increased bias in estimates of VE. In practice, we could mitigate biases
resulting from heterogeneity in the frailty distribution by adjusting for known risk factors of
disease and stratifying our analyses by site or geographic region.

Detailed Example Trials

In this section, we present a more detailed analysis of two simulated COVID-19 vaccine trials
where the true VE was either constant at 75% or waned linearly on the log–hazard scale from
85% to 35% over 1.5 years. Each trial enrolled 30,000 participants with linear accrual over three
months in a 1:1 randomization to vaccine or placebo. The baseline attack rate was piece–wise
constant with change–points every three months, and was calibrated to yield 50, 75, 50, and
25 cases on the placebo arm in each period in the first year, and half the expected number of
cases per period on the placebo arm in year two. In this example, interim analyses are planned
at 150 cases, which ultimately result in crossover at the end of year one following evaluation
and vetting of the efficacy by a regulatory agency. Placebo crossover occurs over a four week
period. Each volunteer was followed for a total of two years.
The two simulated trials are summarized in Table 3. In the constant VE scenario, the trial
reached 150 cases in 234 days, and recorded 208 events by the one year crossover time–point
and 269 events overall. The case split across treatment arms declined from roughly 83% on the
placebo arm at the 150 case interim look to 75.5% at the completion of the study in the constant
VE scenario, and from 82% to 49% in the waning VE scenario. The overall VE estimate at

Table 2: Empirical variance and coverage for estimates of the intercept and linear trend in
vaccine efficacy under the log–linear model, (3), and semi–parametric model, (7). Here, the
time–varying baseline hazard in year two was half the baseline hazard in year one.

the one year crossover, estimated using a proportional hazards model without adjustment for
time since vaccination, was 78% (95% CI: 68.7%, 84.5%) in the constant VE case and 76.3%
(95% CI: 66.3%, 83.4%) in the waning VE scenario (the true geometric mean VE to one year
post–vaccination is 75.6%).
Point estimates for immediate VE and the linear trend in log VE from the log–linear and Pspline models were close in both scenarios, although confidence intervals in the P-spline models
were wider. The estimated efficacy profiles obtained with both methods were in agreement
and recovered the true VE profile (Figure 3). The P-spline estimates had wider point-wise
confidence intervals, but the inflation in the variance appears to be fairly modest for the period
spanning the end of study enrollment through, roughly, year 1.5 post–vaccination. In practice,
both the log–linear decay model and the P-spline model could be used to test a hypothesis of
time–varying VE. This is straightforwardly carried out for the log–linear model via a likelihood
ratio test (LRT) for the slope parameter in (3) where the test statistic is compared to a chi–
square distribution with one degree of freedom. For the P-spline models, we perform a likelihood
ratio test for whether all of the P-spline basis coefficients are jointly equal to zero, and compare
the test statistic to a chi–square distribution with 3.1 degrees of freedom (the effective degrees
of freedom for the P-splines in our models). In the waning VE scenario, we reject the null
hypothesis of time-homogeneous VE, and fail to reject the null in the constant VE scenario
(Table 3).
In the supplementary materials, we provide a table analogous to Table 4 but for a subgroup
about 1/8 of the total cohort. The true VE for this subgroup was 0.75. We evaluated the
estimate of VE(0) under the log-linear model. Using the pre-crossover data available at year 1
provides an estimated VE(0) of 0.84 with a 95% CI (0.16, 0.97) at 1 year. Following crossover
at 1 year and using the full follow-up, the estimate improved to 0.74 with a slightly narrower
confidence interval of (0.19,0.91).
These simulated examples show that for both the waning and constant VE scenarios, accurate inference about the behavior of the vaccine efficacy over time can be recovered as well as
somewhat improved estimation in subgroups. Furthermore, these examples demonstrate how
quitting the study at 1 year results in decidedly inferior estimates.

Discussion

Assessment of durability of vaccine induced protection is a key question in vaccine development, especially for COVID-19 vaccines. Placebo volunteers will be offered vaccine before long
term follow-up has completed. In this paper we demonstrated that durability can be accurately
assessed following crossover using a Cox proportional hazards model. To reflect seasonal variation in the attack rate, we use calendar time as the time index and specified flexible models for
vaccine efficacy over time. Our results point out the importance of a longer crossover period
and a longer crossover interlude to help improve the estimation. If crossover occurs quickly,
the early VE will remain poorly estimated, no matter how many post-crossover cases occur.
We show that continued crossover can help improve estimates of constant VE compared to
terminating the study. Thus, VE in subgroups or for rare events can be somewhat improved
following crossover. Compared with the standard trial, the estimate of VE post-crossover is
less reliable, though the disadvantage remains roughly constant post-crossover. Given that a
standard parallel trial is not ethically possible, such comparisons provide a kind of benchmark.
However, the real question is whether crossover offers advantages compared to quitting. Here

Table 3: Summary of example trials simulated under constant and waning vaccine efficacy (VE)
at times of interim analysis and placebo crossover. The intercept and linear trend correspond
to the immediate effect of vaccination and the time–trend for VE(t) under model (3), and the
true values were set to θ1 = −1.39 and θ2 = 0 in the constant VE scenario, and θ1 = −1.9 and
θ2 = 0.98 in the waning VE setting. The likelihood ratio test (LRT) for waning VE compares
models (3) and (7) to a PH model without adjustment for time since vaccination.

the statistical advantages are enormous. Therefore, we strongly recommend that followup of
study participants continue following vaccination of placebo volunteers.
In this work we implicitly assumed that there was no differential dropout or changes in
behavior during the trial. Such an assumption is plausible for a trial with blinded crossover. If
volunteers are unblinded and only placebo volunteers receive a crossover vaccination, the risk
for bias due to differential behavior is substantial. Unblinded volunteers, who had originally
received vaccine, will know they are protected and thus might engage in risky behavior or depart
the study. Such differential behavior can, in principle, be addressed via regression adjustment
or inverse probability weighting, but the conclusions from these analyses will ultimately depend
on untestable assumptions. Another possibility is to censor all volunteers for a period of time
around the crossover interlude. Such methods are beyond the scope of this paper. Our work
applies to the setting where endpoints are assessed continuously. Certain endpoints, such as
seroconversion, are assessed infrequently. While the arguments of this paper can, in principle,
be applied to periodically assessed endpoints, the development is more difficult as it involves
methods for interval censored data. Future work will investigate this setting. A related line of
inquiry is how to combine data on seroconversion, and disease endpoints in order to improve
estimation of VE for infection.
In this manuscript, we restricted ourselves to models and software with which it would
be reasonable to assume that practicing statisticians are familiar. However, a more bespoke
modeling approach might be beneficial in certain aspects, or even necessary. Certainly, a
more complex modeling framework would be required for analyzing infrequently assessed or
multivariate endpoints. Still, even within the context of the models in this manuscript there is
room for more sophisticated modeling tools that better reflect the dynamics of the underlying
biological processes. For instance, we used a P-spline to model the VE profile, but this allows for
VE to be non-monotonic. We could enforce monotonicity in the VE profile via shape constrained
splines (Pya and Wood, 2015). We also sidestepped the issue of covariate adjustment, although
incorporating covariate data can mitigate bias arising from model misspecification relating to
frailties, and can greatly improve precision and power in vaccine trials (Benkeser et al., 2020).

Varying the Crossover Interlude Duration

Here, we compare placebo crossover trials with long (two months) and short (two week)
crossover interlude durations and an average crossover time of one year. Simulations otherwise
follow the baseline set of simulations — piecewise constant baseline hazards varying seasonally
with the event rate in year two halved, staggered entry, and either waning or constant VE.

Frailty simulation results

This section presents results from simulated trials in where participants were heterogeneous
in their baseline hazards. Simulation was analogous to trials simulated elsewhere in this
manuscript, except that each trial consisted of 30,000 participants and the participant level
hazard was e
hi (t) = Ui hi (t), with hi (t) corresponding to either a constant VE or log-linear VE
model. In both cases the baseline hazard was constant. We considered two settings for the
baseline hazard: a low event rate scenario calibrated to yield 100 cases per year on placebo or a
high event rate scenario calibrated to yield 600 cases per year on placebo. Participant frailties
were drawn from a gamma distribution with mean one and a variance of either one (low frailty
variance scenario) or four (high frailty variance scenario).

Table S8: Bias of estimates of VE and the decay in VE for trials simulated with constant VE
at 75% and gamma distributed frailties. The low baseline hazard scenario was calibrated to
yield an average of 50 cases per six month period on the placebo arm, while the high baseline
hazard scenario was calibrated to yield 300 cases per six month period. The frailty distribution
had mean one and a variance of either one (low variance) or four (high variance).

Table S10: Summary of severe case subgroup analyses for example trials simulated under
constant and waning vaccine efficacy (VE) at times of interim analysis and placebo crossover.
Participants with disease independently developed severe disease with probability 1/8. The
intercept and linear trend correspond to the immediate effect of vaccination and the time–
trend for VE(t) under model (3), and the true values were set to θ1 = −1.39 and θ2 = 0 in the
constant VE scenario, and θ1 = −1.9 and θ2 = 0.98 in the waning VE setting. The likelihood
ratio test (LRT) for waning VE compares models (3) and (7) to a PH model without adjustment
for time since vaccination.
