Abstract

prompting additional terms for the disease,
including “2019-nCoV infection” (Huang et al.,
2020). The virus was then officially named
“SARS-CoV-2” on February 11, 2020
(Coronaviridae Study Group of the International
Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, 2020;
Gorbalenya, 2020), with the disease officially
named “COVID-19” in a separate proposal on the
same day (World Health Organization, 2020b).
Despite these proposals for standardized
terminology, the number of unique terms used in
the literature to refer to either COVID-19 or
SARS-CoV-2 has increased rapidly. Figure 1
visualizes an illustrative sample of terms for
COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 as a timeline of their
first use. Some authors may be dissatisfied with
the term “SARS-CoV-2” due to the potential for
confusion with “SARS-CoV” (Jiang et al., 2020).
However, terminology that does not follow the
existing nomenclature standards is common in the
biomedical literature (Cohen & Demner-Fushman,
2014), and it seems likely that the exceptionally
rapid growth of the literature discussing SARSCoV-2 and COVID-19 (Teixeira da Silva, 2020)
would exaggerate this effect. Handling term
variation is critical for automatically identifying
mentions of specific entities in text (Leaman et al.,
2020), thus despite many mentions of COVID-19
and SARS-CoV-2 following the standardized
terminology, identifying these important entities
comprehensively – that is, with high recall –
requires this high degree of variation to be
addressed.
While there have been many efforts to provide
extensive resources related to COVID-19 (Chen et
al., 2020; Lu Wang et al., 2020) and systems that
address identification of SARS-CoV-2 and
COVID-19 (Colic et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020),
there have been few efforts to provide
comprehensive resources of terms for COVID-19
or SARS-CoV-2 in the scientific literature. Many

The number of unique terms in the
scientific literature used to refer to either
SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19 is remarkably
large and has continued to increase rapidly
despite well-established standardized
terms. This high degree of term variation
makes high recall identification of these
important entities difficult. In this
manuscript we present an extensive
dictionary of terms used in the literature to
refer to SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. We
use a rule-based approach to iteratively
generate new term variants, then locate
these variants in a large text corpus. We
compare our dictionary to an extensive
collection of terminological resources,
demonstrating that our resource provides a
substantial number of additional terms. We
use our dictionary to analyze the usage of
SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 terms over
time and show that the number of unique
terms continues to grow rapidly. Our
dictionary is freely available at

Introduction

In a public health crisis involving novel entities,
such as COVID-19, the disease caused by the
SARS-CoV-2 virus, new scientific insights must
be disseminated rapidly. Researchers must
therefore refer to the novel entities before many of
their properties are understood and appropriate
terminology can be proposed. For example, the
first reports of the condition now known as
COVID-19 only refer to a general description of
symptoms, such as “pneumonia of unknown
aetiology” (Bogoch et al., 2020). The World
Health Organization proposed the provisional
name “2019-nCoV” for the new virus on January
30, 2020 (World Health Organization, 2020a),

illustrating the high degree of terminology variation. Terms are visualized as a timeline of the week of their
first appearance in the literature; for example, week 3 (leftmost cell) began January 13, 2020.

terminological resources only include a few
common variants. For example, Medical Subject
Headings (MeSH) lists 12 terms for COVID-191
while the NCBI Taxonomy lists 12 terms for
SARS-CoV-22. A notable exception is Rashed et al.
(2020), who provide extensive dictionaries for both
COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2, though the last
update to the dataset was in April 20203.

2.1

Terminology Guidelines

In this section we provide a high-level description
of the guidelines we used to create the dictionary.
• The SARS-CoV-2 virus and the disease it
causes (COVID-19) are separate entities.
• Subtypes (e.g. “mild”) are not differentiated.
• We do not include “pandemic” as part of the
name for either SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19.
• Terms are associated with either SARS-CoV-2
or COVID-19, but typically not both.
• Ambiguous terms are allowed if their usage in
context is not ambiguous.

Methods

We approach the task of creating a dictionary of
terms for the virus SARS-CoV-2 and the disease
COVID-19 by identifying terms that refer to these
in the biomedical literature. While this approach
has some similarities to named entity recognition
(NER), our task differs from NER in at least two
ways. First, NER is typically concerned with a
class of similar entities, such as diseases, while our
task is only concerned with two specific entities.
Second, while named entity recognition must
consider each appearance of a potential term in
context, in our task we only need consider whether
the potential term is used to refer to the entity at
least once.

2.2

Description of our approach

Our base lexicon contains 35 terms for COVID-19,
including “coronavirus disease 2019” and
“nCOVID-2019,” and 66 terms for SARS-CoV-2,
including “severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2019” and “hCoV 2019.”
Our system expands the set of base terms into a
large set of potential terms using three types of
rules. The first type of rule substitutes synonyms,
such as “new” for “novel,” near synonyms, such as
“19” for “2019,” or hypernyms such as “virus” for

We apply our dictionary to LitCovid (Chen et al.,
2020), a curated literature hub of PubMed articles
on COVID-19 that is updated daily. LitCovid is the
largest collection of articles specific to COVID-19,
containing 43,448 documents (6,516,832 tokens)
as of August 27, 2020. Our dictionary tagger,
described in Section 2.2, identified 424 unique
terms for COVID-19 from 116,577 mentions; of
these 92,395 (79.3%) are equivalent to the mention
“COVID-19” after normalizing case and removing
whitespace and punctuation. The tagger also
identified 126 unique terms for SARS-CoV-2 from
31,732 mentions; of these 22,559 (71.1%) are
equivalent to the mention “SARS-CoV-2” after
normalizing case and removing whitespace and
punctuation. Due to the lack of gold-standard
corpora containing mention-level annotations of
COVID-19 and SARS-CoV2, we do not provide
precision/recall evaluation for our dictionary.

between the AitsLabCorona dictionary, Combined
dictionary and our dictionary for both COVID-19 and
SARS-CoV-2.

“coronavirus.” The second rule type expands a
term for COVID-19 into a term for SARS-CoV-2
(or the reverse). For example, adding “associated
coronavirus” to the end of any term for COVID-19
results in a term for SARS-CoV-2. Likewise,
adding “infection” to any term for SARS-CoV-2
results in a term for COVID-19. The third type of
rule expands an existing term for COVID-19 or
SARS-CoV-2 into a term for the same entity. For
example, adding “disease” to a term for COVID19 results in another term for COVID-19. The rules
are applied repeatedly, resulting in 101,206
potential terms for COVID-19 and 413 potential
terms for SARS-CoV-2.
The next step in our approach is to identify
instances of the potential terms in the biomedical
literature. Our dictionary tagger identifies terms
independent of case and without regard for
whitespace or punctuation. The dictionary tagger
initially identifies all matching terms, so that
“COVID-19 disease” results in three mentions:
“COVID,” “COVID-19,” and “COVID-19
disease.” However, embedded mentions are
dropped, in this case leaving only “COVID-19
disease.” Terms that do not appear in the results at
least once are filtered.
The final step in our approach is manual review
of all terms found, including a sample of
appearances in context to ensure their usage in
context is not ambiguous. We identify rules that
should be added, such as the near-synonym
relationship between “associated” and “related.”
These steps are iterated until additional rules
cannot be identified.

Comparison

We compare our dictionary of terms for COVID19 and SARS-CoV-2 against the terms in two other
resources. The first dictionary, AitsLabCorona, is
derived from the COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2
dictionaries from the Aits Lab Corona project
(Rashed et al., 2020) by manually assigning terms
that are listed for both COVID-19 and SARS-CoV2 to only one entity. The second dictionary,
Combined, is a collection of terms for COVID-19
and SARS-CoV-2 from WikiData (Waagmeester et
al., 2020) and eight biomedical terminologies: NCI
Thesaurus (Fragoso et al., 2004), Monarch Disease
Ontology (MONDO) (Shefchek et al., 2020),
Medical Subject Headings (MeSH), Unified
Medical Language System (UMLS) (Bodenreider,
2004), NCBI Taxonomy (Federhen, 2012),
SNOMED CT 4 , Disease Ontology (Kibbe et al.,
2015), and FDA Substance Registration System
(UNII) 5 . Terms listed for both COVID-19 and
SARS-CoV-2 are again manually assigned to only
one entity. Because our focus is terms that are used
in the literature, we identify instances of the terms
in the biomedical literature, normalizing case and
removing both punctuation and whitespace as we
do for our dictionary. Terms that do not appear in
the results at least once are filtered.

Total number of unique mentions per
concept

We compare the terms found in each COVID-19
and SARS-CoV-2 term dictionary by identifying
the terms that appear in the each of the dictionaries.
The results are presented as a Venn diagram in
Figure 2. Analysis of the comparison shows our
dictionary includes many single-token variations
the others lack, such as “SARS-CoV-2 infected”
and “2019-new CoV.” However, our dictionary
lacks terms that include “pandemic” and is missing
semantically inverted terms such as “disease
caused by SARS-CoV-2.” The Combined
dictionary also contains the term “coronavirus” as
a synonym for SARS-CoV-26. This term does not
appear in our dictionary because the sense of
“coronavirus” referring specifically to SARSCoV-2 is uncommon in the scientific literature.

Discussion

While the number of unique terms for SARS-CoV2 and COVID-19 is large, a single term is
responsible for most mentions of each concept.
This suggests that an extensive dictionary may not
be necessary. To determine if this is the case, we
analyzed the frequency that the terms in our
dictionary appear in LitCovid. The distribution is
long tail for both entities: the average frequency of
terms for COVID-19 is 275 with a median of 2,
while the average frequency of terms for SARSCoV-2 is 252 with a median of 3. Plotting the
frequency of each term against its rank on a log-log
scale confirms that both distributions are Zipfian
(data not shown).
Since most terms are uncommon, however, the
additional recall provided by each additional term
is small. Thus, achieving high recall does require
an extensive dictionary. For example, identifying
99% of the COVID-19 mentions identified by our
dictionary requires 45 terms (27 for SARS-CoV-2)
but identifying 99.5% of the COVID-19 mentions
requires 148 terms (89 for SARS-CoV-2). Note
that these values are likely underestimated, since
our dictionary likely does not contain all terms for
either entity. Moreover, while some of the
uncommon
terms
(e.g.
“COVID-2019
pneumonia”) contain a more common term (e.g.
“COVID-2019”), many variations are not simple
extensions: “COVID-2019” does not contain
“COVID-19”. Thus, even for tasks where a term
could be considered redundant if it contains a more
common term, the list of non-redundant terms
6

remains relatively long (112 for COVID-19, 39 for
SARS-CoV-2).
4.1

Term usage over time

We analyzed the terminology used in the literature
to refer to COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 over time.
We used the dictionary tagger results on LitCovid
with our dictionary of terms for COVID-19 and
SARS-CoV-2. We represented time as the week
that the article was initially added to PubMed,
which is typically earlier than the publication date.
Figure 3 shows the total number of unique terms
used in the literature to refer to COVID-19 or
SARS-CoV-2 as a function of time. The standard
names for COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were
proposed in week 7, but the trends for both entities
after that time remain highly linear. This data
suggests both that a high degree of term variation
must be handled to comprehensively identify all
terms for either entity, and the dictionary will
require regular updates.
In contrast, however, Figure 4 shows the
percentage of articles (per week) that reference
either entity using the most common mention for
the entity (“@1”) or one of the 5 most common
terms for the entity (“@5”). The 5 most common
terms for COVID-19 are, in order of descending
frequency:
“COVID-19,”
“SARS-CoV-2
infection,”
“Coronavirus disease 2019,”
“COVID,” and “Novel coronavirus pneumonia.”

domain, namely two specific entities. Other studies
have previously identified near synonyms as a
significant source of synonymy for biomedical
terms (Blair et al., 2014), and generalizing this
approach to address normalization of a wider range
of entities may be potentially interesting. There is
also a significant amount of prior work on
identifying terminology with reduced supervision
(Neelakantan & Collins, 2014; Riloff & Shepherd,
1999; Williams et al., 2015), which would reduce
manual involvement and/or allow more entities to
be considered. Finally, it would be valuable to
automatically identify the most important terms to
review systematically (Tsuruoka et al., 2008).

again in order of descending frequency, are
“SARS-CoV-2,” “Novel coronavirus,” “Severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2,” “2019nCov,” and “2019 novel coronavirus.” This figure
demonstrates that despite the high degree of term
variation, most terms used are common, suggesting
that relatively high automated performance can be
obtained using relatively common terms. The
figure also shows that the term “SARS-CoV-2”
was accepted more slowly than “COVID-19,” and
that the usage rate for the term “SARS-CoV-2”
remains lower than the rate for “COVID-19.”
Finally, the continued appearance of the term
“novel coronavirus” in the 5 most common terms
is concerning because it appears in the literature
hundreds of times before the pandemic, making its
meaning both ambiguous and dependent on the
temporal context.
