Abstract
Current situation of COVID-19 demands a rapid, reliable, cost-effective, facile detection
strategy to break the transmission chain and biosensor has emerged as a feasible solution for
this purpose. Introduction of nanomaterials has undoubtedly improved the performance of
biosensor and the addition of graphene enhanced the sensing ability to a peerless level.
Amongst different graphene-based biosensing schemes, graphene field-effect transistor
marked its unique presence owing to its ability of ultrasensitive and low-noise detection
thereby facilitating instantaneous measurements even in the presence of small amounts of
analytes. Recently, graphene field-effect transistor type biosensor is even successfully
employed in rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 and this triggers the interest of the scientific
community in reviewing the current developments in graphene field-effect transistor.
Subsequently, in this article, the recent progress in graphene field-effect transistor type
biosensors for the detection of the virus is reviewed and challenges along with their strengths
are discussed.

1. COVID-19 Transmission: Extent and Trivial Goals
In December 2019 a new strain of coronavirus caused severe respiratory illness 1 which was
later termed as severe acute respiratory-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 2. World Health
Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as pandemic on 13 March 2020 and urged
international research community to carry out diagnostic test at a massive scale to fight the
rapid transmission of the disease 3. Since the transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2 is hasty fast,
thus to break the chain of transmission a uniform diagnostic approach needs to be followed.
WHO has formulated a guideline in this regard, named as ASSURED (Affordable, Sensitive,
Specific, User-friendly, Rapid and robust, Equipment-free and Deliverable to end-users) as a
benchmark to identify the most suitable diagnostic approach/test for resource-constrained
situations 4. However, this virus is novel in many aspects and possessed great difficulties for
all the countries around the world to get control over it 5. One of the major difficulties was
that, some of the patients are asymptomatic but are capable of transmitting the virus 6. Thus
rapid, reliable testing needs to be developed for isolation of COVID-19 patients as well as for
the safety for others.

2. Detection strategies for COVID-19
The early diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 is crucial to prevent the severe outbreak of the disease
and different detection strategies are being employed to encounter the adverse situation.
Current detection strategies can be categorized as detection using immunological assays,
detection based on amplification techniques and biosensing (Fig 1).

2

Fig 1. Different virus detection methods.
The methods involving immunological assays (e.g. Lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA),
Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)) suffer from the drawback of the
requirement of complex production routes of recombinant proteins and antibodies whereas
amplification-based techniques (e.g. Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RTPCR), Nanopore Target Sequencing (NTS)) involve skilled personnel and expensive
instruments 7. Moreover, both of these methods require complex, expensive optical imaging
devices and longer time for completion. Thus scientists are in search of an inexpensive,
reliable, facile way for the apt detection of SARS-CoV-2 with high accuracy. Under the
current scenario, biosensing is the most suitable technique for facile and accurate detection of
the SARS-CoV-2. The biosensing is performed using a biosensor which is generally
composed of two parts, a bioreceptor and a physiochemical transducer (Fig 2). The
bioreceptor identifies the target analyte e.g. antibody, enzyme, DNA, aptamer etc. A
biochemical signal is generated owing to the biomolecule-analyte interaction and transducer

3

converts it into measurable information and analyzed quantitatively. The signal received from
the transducer is firstly amplified and then processed for feeding into a display unit.

3. Nano-enabled biosensing systems for virus detection
Since the inception of the biosensor 9, a diverse range of biosensors undergoes research and
development phase covering a broad spectrum of applications. However, a very limited
number of biosensors are commercially available. For real-time sensing of biomarkers with
picomolar (pM) sensitivity, only a few complex sensing systems involving high cost was
proposed. Moreover, nanomaterials have been the area of keen interest since their discovery
because of their unique and novel properties 10. Consequently, various kinds (based on their

4

size and shape) of nanomaterials are employed in biosensor for simple, reliable and
inexpensive detection of viruses as listed in Table 1.

Later on, graphene entered the biosensing-platform after the first demonstration of easy
isolation of graphene by Geim and Novoselov, from bulk graphite in 2004 18. Graphene is a
two dimensional sp2 hybridized form of carbon consisting of a single layer of graphite with a
hexagonal lattice structure. Graphene can be oxidized by various routes to synthesize
graphene oxide (GO) and the GO can be further made to undergo reduction schemes to
achieve reduced GO (rGO) (Fig 3).

Fig 3. Synthesis schemes of GO from graphene and rGO from GO 19.

There are various methods to synthesize graphene and its derivatives for their integration in
the biosensor; meanwhile, chemical vapour deposition 20 proves to be the best amongst them.
Moreover, in recent days scientists have come up with advanced graphene synthesis method
to curtail the production cost 21, 22 even up to 95.5% 23 . In the pandemic scenario such as
COVID-19, the cost of production of biosensing platforms is a major concern since millions
6

of tests needs to be executed every day. The low cost of graphene makes it an ideal choice for
the fabrication of high-performance and low-cost biosensing platforms.

Owing to the extraordinary physical and chemical properties, graphene-based materials have
proved itself superior to other nanomaterials for the development of super-sensitive
biosensors with a very low detection limit 24 (Fig. 4).

Fig. 4. Extraordinary physical and chemical properties of graphene-based materials
facilitate their use in biosensors.

7

Subsequently, graphene-based sensing schemes have become widely popular nowadays 25 and
are being employed by the researchers around the globe for detection of bacterial and viral
pathogens 26, human virus 27, even for the vitamins 28 (e.g. biotin) with ultrahigh sensitivity and
specificity.

4. Graphene-based electrochemical and optical biosensors for virus detection
4.1 Graphene-based electrochemical biosensors
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) makes use of the Faraday’s law to
characterize a chemical process employing electrical measurements. In EIS, a small
oscillating voltage of varied frequencies is applied to an electrochemical cell and the
electrical impedance signal is recorded to acquire information related to diffusion and charge
transfer phenomena occurring on the surface of the electrode. An impedimetric biosensor is
constructed employing this idea by immobilizing biological recognition elements onto the
electrode surface of the electrochemical cell. Whenever the biological sample interacts with
the biological recognition elements then the resulted biochemical activities is measured by
the electrical impedance signal. Preferably the biorecognition layer should be deposited on a
transducing material having a high conductivity, low electron transfer resistance and high
surface to volume ratio. Since graphene qualifies for all the characteristics thus graphenebased impedimetric biosensor 29 was successfully employed for the detection of viruses.
Glassy carbon electrode was modified by Gong et al. 30 using graphene-naﬁon composite film
for the detection of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) gene with a detection limit of 2.3 x
10-14 M. Muain et al. 31 used gold nanoparticles-decorated rGO nanocomposite for detection
of hepatitis B virus with the lowest limit of detection of 3.80 ng mL−1. For the detection of
diarrhea virus, Li et al. 32 used nanocomposite consisting of molybdenum disulfide and rGO

8

decorated with gold nanoparticles. However, there is a drawback of the impedimetric
biosensor as the recording of the full impedance spectrum is a time-consuming task 33.

Impedimetric biosensor specifically measures the changes in charge conductance via
computing the impedance of the electrode surface whereas electrochemical biosensor in
general measures the biochemical interaction between a bioactive substance and a biomarker
and in addition to measure the impedance (which measures sensitivity); it also selectively
detects different molecules as the molecules can be oxidized/reduced at different potentials.
Graphene is widely used in the electrochemical biosensor as the high surface area of
graphene aids the presence of a large number of defects which act as electro-active sites for
heterogeneous electron transfer 34. Huang et al. 35 used silver nanoparticle-graphene-chitosan
nanocomposite for the detection of avian influenza virus (H7) with a detection limit of
1.6pg/mL. Human influenza virus (H1N1) can also be detected using GO-based
electrochemical biosensor as demonstrated by Joshi et al. 36 with a detection limit of 26
PFU/mL. Moreover, graphene is widely used for building analytical lab-on-chip platforms 37.
Sing et al. 38 explored this idea to fabricate rGO-based electrochemical immunosensor
integrated with a microfluidic platform for the detection of influenza viruses with a lower
detection limit of 0.5 PFU/mL. For the detection of dengue virus, Navakul et al. 39 used a
graphene-polymer based electrochemical biosensor and the sensor could detect the virus
down to the level of 0.12 PFU/mL. Graphene quantum dots 40 (GQD) were employed for the
fabrication of electrochemical biosensor platform for the detection of hepatitis B and hepatitis
E viruses by Xiang et al. 41 and Chowdhury et al. 42, respectively.

4.2 Graphene-based electrochemiluminescence and fluorescence biosensors
The novel optical properties of graphene such as broadband and tunable absorption along
with remarkable polarization-dependent effects make it a suitable material for use in the
optical biosensor. A material emits light when it undergoes different physical-chemical
process such as electrochemiluminescence (emission of light as a result of a chemical
reaction triggered by electron transfer process) and fluorescence (light emission caused by
electronic relaxation). Graphene is applied in various roles in electrochemiluminescence 43
and fluorescence-based optical detection schemes. Wang et al. 44 used GO as fluorescence
polarization signal amplifier for the detection of HIV with a detection limit of 38.6 pmol/L.
GO is also employed for the detection of ebola virus by Wen et al. 45 via the exploration of
quenching property of graphene. The lower detection limit of the device was 1.4pM. Jeong et
al. 46 made a biosensor using GO and the fabricated biosensor could detect as low as 3.8 pg of
influenza viral RNA. GQD is also widely used for optical biosensing of HIV 47 and dengue
virus 48.

5. Graphene-based FET biosensors for virus detection
A field-effect transistor (FET) is a majority carrier device having three terminals namely
source, drain and gate. In FET an electric field is applied at the gate terminal which in-effect
modifies the conductivity of the channel placed between source and drain. In Graphene FET
(GFET) graphene is introduced as a channel within the FET structure. Based on the
fabrication scheme of the gate, the GFET can be categorized as back-gated GFET or topgated GFET (Fig. 5 a and b). Since the conductivity of the graphene is very high thus the
response time of GFET is extremely small which essentially aids the quick detection of the
virus 49. In GFET biosensing scheme the virus is immobilized on graphene surface and the

10

virus modifies the conductivity of the graphene which is rapidly detected at the output (Fig 5
c and d).

Fig. 5. (a) Structure of back-gated GFET ; (b) Structure of top-gated GFET, (c) Optical
microscope image of a GFET and (d) a schematic image of biosensing by the GFET. 50,51

Because of the immense potential of GFET in biosensing, scientists have used advanced
modeling and simulation techniques to optimize the response of the GFET biosensor.
Hamzah et al. 52 modeled the electrical transport of GFET biosensor and found that simulation
temperature affects the electrical transport in GFET. Wu et al. 53 performed theoretical
modeling of GFET biosensor for bacterial detection. They found that the probe size,
11

graphene-bacteria distance and bacterial concentration are the key parameters for sensitive
detection. Moreover, GFET biosensors often suffer from the issue of baseline drift in their
response within the aqueous environment which makes it complicated to analyze biosensor
response against target molecules. Ushiba et al. 54 employed state-space modeling to resolve
this issue using time-series data of a GFET biosensor. Their model can be successfully
employed for precise analysis of GFET biosensor response under aqueous environment.
These theoretical modeling and simulation studies facilitate the optimization of the synthesis
procedure of GFET biosensor to speed up the production.

Owing to scalability, miniaturization capability, rapid detection ability at low cost with high
yield and reduced requirement of skilled personnel, GFET biosensors are widely used for the
point-of-care (POC) diagnosis of different kind of viruses. Consequently, as the GFET
biosensor needs to be used as a POC device, thus, it is of utmost importance to eliminate the
possibility of cross-contamination mediated via the biosensor. Cartridge-type biosensor 55,56,57
is advantageous in this aspect, as the disposable cartridge eradicates the chances of crosscontamination and makes the readout interface reusable for numerous times (Fig 6).

Chan et al.59 adopted a flow-through approach to fabricate a microfluidic integrated rGO
transistor-based DNA sensor for the detection of avian influenza virus. The strategy of
extended long probe immobilization was proved to be beneficial for them as the minimum
detection limit of 5 pM was achieved at a lesser time than electrochemical or optical sensing
schemes. Graphene micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) technique was employed by
Chen et al.60 to fabricate a portable GFET biosensor for the detection of human influenza
virus with a minimum detection limit of 1 ng/ml. Functionalisation is a useful tool for
chemical modification of material surface structure and Ono et al.61 used this option to
modify the graphene surface for the fabrication of GFET biosensor. He used glycan for
functionalisation and the fabricated GFET biosensor could successfully detect both the
human and avian influenza virus with a detection limit of 130 pM and 600 nM, respectively.
Mutsumoto et al.62 used sugar chain to modify the GFET biosensor structure for the detection
of both the human and avian influenza virus. He fabricated two kinds of GFET biosensor, one
was modified with the human type sugar chain, another was modified by the bird type sugar
chain and both types of GFET biosensor were successful in detecting the viruses. For the
detection of ebola virus, Jin et al.63 fabricated a FET structure using rGO as channel and after
the immobilization of the virus on the surface; the response of the device was measured as a
function of the Dirac voltage. The lower limit of detection of the device was 2.4 pg/mL. Chen
et al.64 also used the rGO based FET structure for the detection of ebola virus however the
lower detection limit of the device was 1 ng/ml. Probabilistic neural network (PNN) was
introduced by Ray et al.65 for quantification of Hepatitis B virus using graphene nanogrids
FET biosensor. The use of PNN proved to be around 85% better than polynomial fit and
static neural network models in lowering of the detection limit. Using PNN the detection
13

limit of the Hepatitis B virus could go down to 0.1 fM as reported by the group. Basu et al.66
used nanoporous silicon oxide template to develop an rGO nanogrid based FET structure for
the detection of Hepatitis B virus. Quantum transport behaviour of rGO and higher
interaction of the biomolecule with the pore walls facilitate the sensitivity of the structure to
achieve a detection limit of 50aM. Liquid ion-gated graphene nanohybrid FET structure
decorated with close-packed carboxylated polypyrrole nano-particle arrays were synthesized
by Kwon et al.67 using the photolithographic approach. The scalable and flexible fluidic FET
biosensor could sense the HIV at as low as 1 pM concentration. Islam et al.68 used aminefunctionalized graphene for the fabrication of FET structured biosensor. The fabricated
biosensor was used for the detection of HIV and the results showed that that the biosensor
could detect HIV with a limit of detection of 10 fg/mL. 3-D inkjet printing method was
adopted by Xiang et al.69 for the fabrication of GFET on flexible Kapton substrate for the
detection of norovirus with a lower detection limit of 0.1 µg/ml. Aspermair et al.70 fabricated
aptamer-functionalized rGO-FET for the detection of human papillomavirus in saliva and the
fabricated device could detect the virus with a detection limit of 1.75 nM. Hummers method
along with photolithography and reduction process was employed by Liu et al.71 for the
fabrication micropatterned rGO FET. After the attachment of rotavirus on the graphene
surface, the drain current quickly deceased and thus setting the lowest detection limit at 102
pfu which is superior to the conventional ELISA method. Pant et al.72 fabricated chemiresistive rGO FET biosensor and used pyrene-NHS (Linker) complex for attachment of
antibodies for the successful detection of rotavirus. For the detection of zika virus
photolithography and plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition was employed by Afsahi
et al.73 to fabricate GFET on Si wafer. The inexpensive, portable GFET could detect the zika
virus at concentrations as low as 450 pM. Currently, all the scientists around the globe are

14

searching for a facile, reliable, inexpensive but sensitive detection scheme for the detection of
SARS-CoV-2.

Fig. 7. SARS-CoV-2 detection scheme using GFET74.

Seo et al.74 fabricated a GFET functionalized with SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody for the
detection of SARS-CoV-2 (Fig 7). 1-pyrenebutanoic acid succinimidyl ester was used as a
probe linker for the immobilization of the SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody. The fabricated
device could be used for detection of SARS-CoV-2 both in transport medium and clinical
sample with a detection limit of 1 fg/ml. Zhang et al.75 also fabricated GFET structure for the
detection of SARS-CoV-2 within 2 mins with a minimum detection limit of 0.2 pM. The
above discussion on the fabrication of GFETs and use them to detect various kind of virus is
summarized in Table 2.

6. Challenges & drawback
Though biosensors have become an attractive choice for the detection of various kinds of the
virus yet there are still some drawbacks exists. Graphene being a nanomaterial, to synthesize
graphene with identical parameters is difficult and if any of the parameters varies then the
response characteristic of the sensor may change. Sample preparation is a crucial step for
reliable detection and it always been a hurdle for the scientist. Moreover, instead of the real
virus environment often a dummy virus environment is used for the safety of the lab
personnel. While many non-specific interactions may occur in the presence of the real sample
and which might be of primary concern regarding the biosensor sensitivity issue. Controlling
of binding efficiency between antibody and virus is also becomes difficult sometimes.

7. Outlook & Conclusions
Cost-effective and reproducible miniaturized GFET sensors having the potential for reliable
diagnosis of the virus with high sensitivity and selectivity are required for the early-stage
detection of SARS-CoV-2. Narvaez et al. 76 have made several recommendations in this
regard among which integration of biosensor with the internet of things (IoT) is very
important in terms of its use as a POC. To achieve these goals collaboration between
physicists, chemists, material scientists, as well as engineers and medical personnel is of
primary importance. Graphene is a wonder material as it showcased thorough several pieces
of evidence, thus it can be forecasted that graphene will overcome all the barriers in future
and GFET type biosensors will be the best possible biosensing scheme for graphene.
