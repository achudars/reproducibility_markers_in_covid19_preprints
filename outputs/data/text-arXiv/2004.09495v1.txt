Abstract— The Covid-19 outbreak, beyond its tragic effects,
has changed to an unprecedented extent almost every aspect of
human activity throughout the world. At the same time, the
pandemic has stimulated enormous amount of research by
scientists across various disciplines, seeking to study the
phenomenon itself, its epidemiological characteristics and ways
to confront its consequences. Information Technology, and
particularly Data Science, drive innovation in all related to
Covid-19 biomedical fields. Acknowledging that software
developers routinely resort to open ‘question & answer’
communities like Stack Overflow to seek advice on solving
technical issues, we have performed an empirical study to
investigate the extent, evolution and characteristics of Covid19 related posts. In particular, through the study of 464 Stack
Overflow questions posted mainly in February and March
2020 and leveraging the power of text mining, we attempt to
shed light into the interest of developers in Covid-19 related
topics and the most popular technological problems for which
the users seek information. The findings reveal that indeed this
global crisis sparked off an intense and increasing activity in
Stack Overflow with most post topics reflecting a strong
interest on the analysis of Covid-19 data, primarily using
Python technologies.

INTRODUCTION

The recent outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease
(Covid-19) that has been initially detected in Wuhan, China
and has rapidly spread all over the world, has caused a
global crisis. Besides the profound impact in health care, the
crisis has expanded to all other aspects of everyday life,
including social relations and economic activities. A unique
characteristic of the crisis is its rapid evolvement, i.e. the
situation changes from day to day. Due to the growing
number of infection epicenters, governments have put
emphasis on tight restrictive measures that prohibit access to
work, travels, meetings, etc. Such strategies essentially at
first encouraged and then necessitated distance work,
education, entertainment and social activities. These
measures soon led to increased and massive demand of
technological
support,
especially
regarding
communications, awareness, adaptation of e-government
and e-shopping systems, etc.
Apart from technologies supporting everyday activities
during the Covid-19 outbreak, there are growing needs for
Information Technologies (IT) that could aid the battle

against the disease. Similarly, researchers all over the world
are attempting to investigate the root causes of the
phenomenon, its spread patterns and mathematical models
governing its evolution. For example, data science
methodologies (e.g. data storing and management) are
particularly important for epidemiologists and for all those
taking decisions based on the distribution and the mortality
rates of the disease. Furthermore, other areas such as
bioinformatics and biostatistics are used in genomic and
clinical research, whereas, even for information purposes,
models and visualization are relying on data analytics.
The motivation of our work is based on our own
observations and our intuitive perception of the IT activities
in demand during the outbreak. Therefore, we decided to
investigate whether and how the new intense circumstances
are reflected on relevant developers’ posts in a “Q&A”
portal such as Stack Overflow (SO). The goal is to find,
retrieve and study SO posts that are related to Covid-19 so
as to understand why and for which topics developers are
interested and how these topics are associated. Also, our
study aims to investigate the evolution of posts in a time
frame where the crisis is continuously escalating. We should
note that with the term ‘developers’ we do not necessarily
assume that users posting on SO are software professionals.
Especially with respect to Covid-19, we consider it highly
possible that scientists from various domains (e.g. medical
sciences, biostatistics, public health scientists, etc.) are
pursuing research that relies on scientific software1 [1]
mainly targeting collection, analysis, visualization and
interpretation of Covid-19 related data.
We believe that this research is useful to a wide range of
scientists from different disciplines since it contributes in
understanding the interconnections of real world disasters
and crises in an era of massive available information,
especially within communities that employ IT to access
such data sources and consume them.

RELATED WORK

SO is continuously attracting the interest of researchers,
as a repository of technological knowledge and expertise.
Thus, many attempts have been made at tracking its
evolution and pinpointing the areas of interest it includes.
1

We refer to software created by scientists and engineers as
scientific software following the definition by Heaton and Carver

Attempts focusing at the website’s community structure
[2] analyze the answers to questions and, by linking coanswerers and answer votes, predict the quality of questions
and their technological content. By inferring the community
structure through the analysis of posts, affiliation networks
have also been employed [3] to track user activity and
cluster common tags into thematically similar groups.
Research has also been performed in the analysis of tags and
their use by developers. Topic shifting [4] and topic
modelling [5] are used in combination with the time factor
to identify trend changes in tag usage along with the
characteristics that render a tag suitable for a question.
Regarding the nature of the questions posted in multiple
categories such as mobile development [6], security [7] or
questions of all types, results indicate that although most
questions are mainly inquisitive (of the types “what”, “how”
and “why”), there are questions of more technical nature,
associated with specific fields of specialization [8,9].
Graph based approaches have been also used to represent
networks of tag co-occurrences [10] and tag-related
communities [11,12]. Finally, aspects like the personality or
the emotions of developers that post questions or answers is
an active topic of research, especially with respect to their
reputation in the community [13].

RESEARCH OBJECTIVES AND RESEARCH QUESTIONS

The main idea behind this study is to investigate,
whether Covid-19 outbreak has affected the activity of
developers’ triggering them to post questions related to
coronavirus topics in knowledge sharing communities. To
this regard, we focus solely on posts, where the
problem/issue being discussed is associated to the adaption
of IT methodologies (e.g. data science, software engineering
etc.) aiming to investigate, understand and provide solutions
to Covid-19 health crisis. Hence, we do not take into
consideration posts, where the topic of discussion concerns
for example the use of collaboration technologies that are
extensively used by organizations, educational institutions
etc. in order to facilitate their operational activities during
the coronavirus lockdown.

Figure 1 Example of a coronavirus-related post

In order to better illustrate our main objective, we
provide a representative example of what we are referring to
as a coronavirus-related post (Figure 1). The title of the post

summarizes that the main topic of the question being asked
by the user is to extract a dataset of Covid-19 cases
comprising information regarding confirmed cases, country
of interest, deaths etc. as it is concluded by the inspection of
the code snippet of the post. Even though we cannot be
absolutely certain regarding the poster’s intentions, the
question is certainly associated to technological challenges
emerging from the Covid-19 pandemic. Except for the title
and the body of the question, the four tags of this specific
post
(“python”,
“api”,
“web-scrapping”
and
“beautifulsoup”) directly point to the context of the
discussed topic, which, in this case, is the broad scientific
domain of data science.
Based on the previous clarifications, we formulate the
following research questions:
[RQ1a] Are developers concerned about coronavirus-related
topics in SO?
[RQ1b] When did this interest arise and which is the
evolution trend over the examined period?
Motivation: Given the severity of the crisis and its
detrimental effects to all aspects of our daily lives, RQ1a
aims to explore, whether developers have been triggered to
investigate and get involved into specific challenges related
to Covid-19 Pandemic, whereas in RQ1b, we focus on the
examination of the evolvement of this phenomenon from its
start and thorough the examined time period of this study.
[RQ2] Which are the characteristics of the coronavirus-related
posts?
Motivation: Since Covid-19 outbreak is an emerging,
rapidly evolving situation, there is no prior knowledge about
the sharing of knowledge and the related posts that can be
found in SO. To this regard, there is a need to explore and
acquire knowledge about the characteristics of the
coronavirus-related posts.
[RQ3a] Which are the most popular problem categories
expressed by SO tags among Covid-19-related posts?
[RQ3b] How these problem categories are associated to
each other?
Motivation: Given the rapid interest on coronavirus-related
research challenges, in RQ3a, we focus on the identification
of the most popular technological aspects that are discussed
by developers. Each post is labelled with one to five tags
defined by the user in order to provide a general overview
of the question by associating it to certain technological
content as the basis for future discussion [8]. To this regard,
Beyer et al. [8] point out that SO posts can be classified into
two question categories: (i) problems and (ii) questions.
Problems, expressed by SO tags, refer to the topics or
technologies that are discussed, whereas questions are
associated to the purpose of the post representing “the kind
of information requested in a way that is orthogonal to any
particular technology” [9].
Hence, in RQ3a, we wish to investigate the technological
content of Covid-19 related topics, and for this reason, we
extract and analyse the SO tags associated to each post. In
RQ3b, our aim is to explore underlying patterns expressed by
the co-occurrences of tags assuming that they contain

information about the interconnected technological aspects
discussed in the frame of coronavirus-related topics.
[RQ4] What types of topics are developers asking about?
Motivation: In RQ4, we focus on the discovery of what is
being asked in coronavirus-related posts. Although tags can
provide meaningful insights of technological content, they
do not identify purposes, issues, problems and generally the
reasons that lead the users to post a question [8]. To this
end, we make use of a topic modelling methodology on the
corpus of the title text in order to discover what are the main
topics of discussion for coronavirus-related posts.
IV.

METHODOLOGY

In this Section, we provide details regarding the
methodology of our experimental setup, which is illustrated
in Figure 2 and can be described as seven-step process
consisting of (i) data collection, (ii) feature extraction, (iii)
data cleaning and pre-processing, (iv) data representation,
(v) data analytics, (vi) knowledge synthesis and (vii)
dissemination of the findings.

Figure 2 Methodology of the study

A. Data Collection
Driven by the main objective and the RQs (Section 3),
we decided to collect posts found in SO, a well-known
Q&A forum. SO is popular for knowledge sharing among
software development due to its timeliness, in the sense that
it reflects quickly any emerging technological trends [14].
Since our main objective is the investigation of what
developers are asking about coronavirus-related topics, we
must note that the data collection is restricted only to
question posts. The search string that was used was quite
broad, comprising synonyms of coronavirus (“coronavirus”
OR “covid*” OR “corona-virus”) to retrieve the entire set
of relevant questions posted until the 1st of April, which was
the final date of collection. The application of the search
string on the SO search engine returned 601 candidate posts
in the form of semi-structured web documents. Document
collection was achieved by using a web scraper built in
Python based on the Selenium package2. The scraper
retrieved all questions on each page and iterated each
question individually to collect additional features not found
on the question’s display on the results page.

B. Feature Extraction
The basic unit of analysis is the question post (or simply
post), which is a web document composed of a number of
fields with a variety of entries. Generally, a post 𝑃 can be
defined as a tuple of a finite number of ordered elements of
the general form
𝑃 = 〈𝑖𝑑, 𝑡, 𝑏, 𝑡𝑎𝑔, 𝑑, 𝑛𝑎, 𝑢〉
(1)
where 𝑖𝑑 is the identification number, 𝑡 is the title, 𝑏 is the
body, 𝑡𝑎𝑔 are the associated tags, 𝑑 is the posting date, 𝑛𝑎
is the number of received answers, 𝑢 is the identification
number of the post owner.
C. Data Cleaning and Pre-processing
As we have already mentioned, the tuples of posts
comprise of both unstructured (i.e. title, body) and
structured (i.e. date, number of received answers etc.)
features. Regarding unstructured text, Text Mining (TM)
techniques were applied in order to reduce the size and
noise of the collected data through data cleaning and text
pre-processing steps. Specifically, we first filter posts that
are irrelevant to the general objectives of the current study,
i.e. posts including messages of support, information related
to technological assistance due to coronavirus lockdown etc.
After this cleaning process, we conduct the following steps
on the remaining 464 posts: (i) removal of stop-words, (ii)
tokenization, (iii) punctuation removal and (iv)
lemmatization. Regarding the list of tags, each tag was
transformed into a dichotomous variable (FALSE/TRUE)
based on its absence/presence in a post.
D. Data Analytics
The next step involves the application of data analytics
methodologies on the set of features to derive conclusions
about the posed RQs (Section 3). Regarding RQ1a and RQ1b,
we study the distribution of the collected posts during the
examined period our study, whereas for RQ2, we conduct a
kind of descriptive statistics analysis on the extracted
features of posts.
Regarding the analysis on the list of tags, we initially
explore the number of tags for each post (RQ3a) and then,
we make use of graph theory to examine whether there are
inter-connections among a subset of tags (RQ3b). More
specifically, we adopt a similar approach proposed by Cui et
al. [13] that is used for the examination of the dynamic
trends in collaborative tagging systems. According to this
approach, a tagging action can be described as a tuple of
three ordered elements:
𝑡𝑎𝑔𝑔𝑖𝑛𝑔 = 〈𝑢𝑖 , 𝑝𝑗 , 𝑡𝑎𝑔𝑘 〉
(2)
implying that the user 𝑖 tagged post 𝑗 with a set of tags 𝑘.
Based on this definition, we develop an Association Rule
Graph (ARG) [13] for tags and their associations to
represent inter-connected technological aspects.
Three concepts play pivotal role to the ARG approach:
The frequency (𝑓𝑟𝑒𝑞(𝑡𝑎𝑔𝑖 )) of a tag, defined as the number
of occurrences of a tag 𝑖 in the set of the collected posts, the
support (𝑠𝑢𝑝𝑝(𝑡𝑎𝑔𝑖 , 𝑡𝑎𝑔𝑗 )), defined as the number of cooccurrences of a specific pair of tags {𝑡𝑎𝑔𝑖 , 𝑡𝑎𝑔𝑗 } in the set

of the collected posts and the confidence (𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑓(𝑡𝑎𝑔𝑖 →
𝑡𝑎𝑔𝑗 )) representing the conditional probability of the
occurrence of 𝑡𝑎𝑔𝑗 in a post, given that the post is already
tagged by 𝑡𝑎𝑔𝑖 , where 𝑓𝑟𝑒𝑞(𝑡𝑎𝑔𝑖 ) < 𝑓𝑟𝑒𝑞(𝑡𝑎𝑔𝑗 ). The
confidence is defined as the ratio of the support for a given
pair of {𝑡𝑎𝑔𝑖 , 𝑡𝑎𝑔𝑗 } to the frequency of the tag with the
lower frequency (𝑡𝑎𝑔𝑖 ).
𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑓(𝑡𝑎𝑔𝑖 → 𝑡𝑎𝑔𝑗 ) =

𝑠𝑢𝑝𝑝(𝑡𝑎𝑔𝑖 ,𝑡𝑎𝑔𝑗 )
𝑓𝑟𝑒𝑞(𝑡𝑎𝑔𝑖 )

(3)

Based on the previous definitions, ARG is defined as a
directed graph 𝐺 = (𝑉, 𝐸), where 𝑉 and E are the set of
vertices and edges, respectively. In our case, each tag (𝑡𝑎𝑔𝑖 )
from the set of distinct tags represents a vertex accompanied
by a weight (𝑤𝑡𝑎𝑔𝑖 ) evaluated by the tag frequency
(𝑓𝑟𝑒𝑞(𝑡𝑎𝑔𝑖 )) of this specific tag. In addition, for each pair
of tags {𝑡𝑎𝑔𝑖 , 𝑡𝑎𝑔𝑗 } that co-occurred in the set of the
collection of posts and satisfying and 𝑓𝑟𝑒𝑞(𝑡𝑎𝑔𝑖 ) <
𝑓𝑟𝑒𝑞(𝑡𝑎𝑔𝑗 ), there is a directed edge accompanied by an
edge weight computed by the confidence (𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑓(𝑡𝑎𝑔𝑖 →
𝑡𝑎𝑔𝑗 )) for this specific pair.
For RQ4, we perform Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
analysis on the question titles, since titles provide
straightforward information about the problem being asked
by the user. LDA [15] is a well-known probabilistic model
for topic extraction in a collection of documents that has
been extensively used in many experimental studies for
topic modeling on textual content of SO posts [9]. The main
idea behind LDA is that documents are represented as
probability distributions over latent topics, where each topic
is represented by a distribution of words [15]. Thus, LDA
unveils the hidden topics by taking into consideration the
patterns of the words that tend to co-occur frequently in the
set of documents of the corpus. The selection of the number
of topics 𝐾 is based on experimentation with different
values of 𝐾, since it is a user-defined parameter [8] and
there is not an optimum value for all experimental setups
[14]. Generally, a high value of K results to the
identification of a detailed collection of topics, whereas
smaller values of K result to more general collection of
topics [6, 16].
Based on the main scope of RQ4, the total number of
posts and the restricted number of bag-of-words that can be
found in the title of each post, we decided to set 𝐾 = 6,
since this parameter value provided a broad collection of
topics capturing the general patterns that are hidden in the
collection of posts through the implementation of the LDA
model provided by the Gensim Python package3 on the
corpus consisting of all post titles.

RESULTS

In this section, we present the findings of this study
based on the posed RQs.

A. [RQ1a] Are developers concerned about coronavirusrelated topics in SO?
[RQ1b] When did this interest arise, and which is the
evolution trend over the examined period?
The search in SO indicates that “post-zero” is traced
back to January 26, in which the user wished to print
multiple identical values from an array of Covid-19-related
text in PHP. After the cleaning step described in Section 4,
the final dataset contains 464 retrieved Covid-19 related
posts that constitute the basis of our study.

Figure 3 Number of Covid-19 related posts for each day of February/March

In Figure 3, we present the number of posts per day for
two specific months (February and March) but we have also
to note that the final dataset contains also few cases posted
on January (including “post-zero”) and April 1st (i.e. the
final day of the data collection process). The figure shows a
significant increase of posts for month March
(approximately 95% of all posts) compared to month
February (approximately 4% of all posts), when the impacts
and consequences of the Covid-19 outbreak presented an
explosive spread to healthcare systems, businesses, financial
markets and economies and generally to our society.
B. [RQ2] Which are the characteristics of the coronavirusrelated posts?
In order to gain better insights about the characteristics
of the observed phenomenon, we initially performed
statistical analysis on the associated features that can be
found in each post.
Figure 4a presents the distribution of the number of
received answers for the set of posts indicating that more
than 60% of the posts has already been responded by at least
one user (mean value 𝑀 = 0.87, standard deviation 𝑆𝐷 =
0.88, median 𝑀𝑑𝑛 = 1). Considering that we have tracked
Covid-19 related posts for a two-month period, it is rather
reasonable that most posts have received a limited number
of answers. Due to the observed growing interest on
coronavirus-related, there is a need to examine, whether
these questions are posted by different users or whether,
there is only a specific proportion of users that are interested
in. To this regard, we evaluate the percentage of unique
users who posted a question related to a coronavirus issue.
The percentage of unique users (# of different users posted
one question divided by the # of posts) was 79.09%
signifying a broad awareness of the community.

Figure 4 Percentage distribution of the number of (a) answers and (b) tags

Figure 5 Percentage distribution of the top 10 popular tags

C. [RQ3a] Which are the most popular problem categories
expressed by SO tags among coronavirus-related
topics?
[RQ3b] How are these problem categories associated to
each other?
The analysis on the occurrences of SO tags showed that
most users (56.46%) defined from two up to three tags
(Figure 4b). Figure 5 presents the distribution of the 10 most
popular tags from the set of 482 total tags, from which we
can observe that the tags “python” and “r”, which are two of
the most known programming languages for Data Science,
significantly dominate in terms of their occurrences.
We have also to note that the percentages refer to the
identified distinct tags found in the posts, which practically
means that these percentages may be significantly higher, if
we take into consideration the fact that for any tag, there
may be a related tag or a synonym with the same meaning.
For example, the sixth most popular tag presented in the
dataset is “python-3.x”, which is in fact, a tag that is used
for posts “about Python programming language that are
specific to version 3+ of the language”4. To this end, the
total percentage of posts that is associated to Python
programming language after summing up other unique tags
referring to different versions of this specific language (i.e.
“python-2.7”, “python-3.7”, “python-3.x”) is 35.56%.
Regarding the other tags presented in the list of the top
popular ones, an interesting conclusion is the fact that they
are also related to Data Science. We have also to keep in
mind that Data Science is all about using data in order to
gain new insights that you would otherwise have missed
[17]. It is an inter-disciplinary field comprising scientific
methods and processes for the collection, organization,
4

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python-3.x

processing, storage, analysis and visualization of data with
the aim of extracting knowledge hidden in unstructured,
semi-structured and structured data [18]. Due to the
multifaceted nature of Data Science and the need for
interdisciplinary competences and skills, there is a variety of
challenges and tasks that a practitioner should be able to
handle. The findings suggest that the remaining most
popular tags (except from “python” and “r”) are closely
related to phases of the whole lifecycle of Data Science. For
example, the tag “web-scrapping” and “json” are related to
the collection phase through the extraction of information
from websites, whereas “beautifulsoup” is a Python package
that is used for parsing web documents. In addition,
“dataframe” is a well-known data structure in several
languages (e.g. Python, R etc.) for the organization of
information in data analytics and this is also the case for
“pandas”, which is a Python library for data manipulation.
Finally, the posts tagged by “html” or “javascript” reveal
an interest to seek knowledge about scraping content from
HTML documents (usually residing in Javascript-enabled
pages), most often through parsers developed in Python or
node.js or with the help of test automation tools. It becomes
evident that once again the focus is on data collection from
online sources and the developers of scientific software
wish to automate the parsing from websites with dynamic
content and convert the extracted information into data
structures of file formats for further processing.
Regarding the topic of discussion, the manual review
process through the inspection of the title and body of the
posts reveals that the users are mostly interested in
collecting, organizing and analyzing data of Covid-19
global cases (i.e. confirmed, deaths, recovered etc.).
After the identification of the most popular tags found in
coronavirus-related topics (RQ3a), the focus is now on the
investigation
of
the
interdependencies
between
technological aspects (RQ3b). To this regard, we construct
an ARG for the top 10 popular tags as described in Section
IV. To derive meaningful conclusions avoiding the problem
of presenting noise nodes and edges, we decided to exclude
association rules with low frequencies of the antecedent and
generally high values for confidence.
The inspection of Figure 6 indicates that the two tags of
the programming languages “python” and “r” are
represented by generally large circles (the area of the circle
represents the frequency of the tag, the direction of an edge
(𝑡𝑎𝑔𝑖 → 𝑡𝑎𝑔𝑗 ) is defined by the constraint 𝑓𝑟𝑒𝑞(𝑡𝑎𝑔𝑖 ) <
𝑓𝑟𝑒𝑞(𝑡𝑎𝑔𝑗 ), whereas the width of the edge is weighted
according to the value of confidence (𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑓(𝑡𝑎𝑔𝑖 → 𝑡𝑎𝑔𝑗 )).
Several well-known technologies are associated to the tag
“python”, including libraries and frameworks for webparsing (“beautifulsoup”, “selenium”), data manipulation
(“pandas”), interactive visualization (“matplotlib”, “plotly”,
“seaborn”, “choropleth”) and geospatial data analysis
(“geopandas”, “geojson”). Finally, the tag “python” is also
related to more general tags such as “data-science”,
“dataframe”, “dataset”, “curve-fitting” etc.

With respect to another frequent tag, namely
“javascript”, we observe that almost all associated nodes
point to libraries, frameworks and language elements
needed for extracting content or posting from/to the Web:
the widely used libraries “jQuery” and “d3.js”, are related to
HTML/XML document manipulation, while module
“cheerio”, method “get” and API “fetch” facilitate the
manipulation of “http” requests and responses. From these
tags, it is confirmed that developers of scientific software in
the era of Covid-19 are interested in getting content from
sites posting relevant information (presumably virus-related
demographics). The nodes corresponding to the API
“google-maps” and the library “leaflet” express the interest
to create and annotate maps with custom content using
Javascript (as for example in case of marking virus
hotspots). At the same time the API “google-sheet”, method
“filter” and questions related to “for-loop” instructions are
associated with attempts to process the data extracted from
the web and store it into arrays of spreadsheets. Finally,
following recent trends, developers are posting questions on
state-of-practice front-end frameworks such as “react.js”
and “vue.js” but are also interested in using “node.js” for
server-side scripting, in the context of setting up the user
interface and the back-end of Covid-19 related applications.
D. [RQ4] What types of topics are developers asking about?
The results of the application of LDA on the corpus of
titles are summarized in Table 1 presenting the most
frequent words for each one of the six extracted topics.
Moreover, we tried to reify the conceptual meaning of each
latent topic by providing a description of topics developers
are asking about coronavirus-related posts.
An interesting finding derived from the inspection of the
list of frequent words is the fact that the most common type
of question is “how to …”, a type generally found frequently
in SO posts [9,18,19,6,16,8]. Furthermore, the word “error”
designates that developers frequently face problems related
to occurrences of errors in their code.

Figure 6 Association rule graph for the top 10 popular tags

Besides the type of the question, the frequent words
provide to us a more detailed overview of the content of the

problem being discussed compared to tags. Again, it is clear
that the interest is focused on technological challenges
related to phases of Data Science lifecycle and to more
specific associated technologies such as specific
programming languages. The most popular technological
topic seems to be the collection of data related to Covid-19
cases through web-scraping techniques and content retrieval
from websites, whereas the users also post questions related
to the data analysis and visualization of reported cases
through maps for geospatial analysis. Finally, as far as
specific technologies concern, it is evident again that
languages Python and R play a predominant role to the
community of developers for examining challenges related
to Covid-19 pandemic.

DISCUSSION

In this section, we discuss the key findings of the study
organized per research question and the implications to
stakeholders.
RQ1: Developers interest on Covid-19-related topics in SO
From the number of Covid-19 related posts for each day
of February and March 2020 it becomes clearly evident that
the developers’ increasing interest over time follows closely
the global trends for the number of cases, fatalities and even
the popularity of Covid-19 terms in search engines. This is
reasonable but also proves the quick responsiveness of the
scientific software community against global phenomena
and emerging topics and the pressing needs for multiple
representations of data. It is also interesting that a
periodicity in the downward dents in the number of posts
can be observed: these drops seem to coincide with the end
of the corresponding weeks, as they mostly occur on Fridays
and Saturdays. Further investigation can reveal whether the
observed trend in the number of posts will match the Covid19 pandemic for the upcoming months.
RQ2: Characteristics of the coronavirus-related posts
Despite the rapidly increasing trend in the number of
Covid-19 related posts, it seems that the pandemic has taken
the world by storm. All identified Covid-19 posts have
received a rather limited number of answers (usually one
answer) and at the same time most users posting Covid-19
related questions are unique. This is of course a
consequence of the limited period in which the analysis of
SO posts has been carried out, but it could also imply that
the rapid developments did not allow the forming of mature

research communities. In other words, as in any other
emerging crises or trends, the first researchers who attempt
to analyze and interpret the phenomenon are working
independently and loosely interact with each other.
RQ3: Popular problem categories expressed by SO tags
The analysis of the identified SO tags clearly implies a
strong interest on seeking knowledge about the collection,
organization, processing, storage, analysis and visualization
of data. The developers’ goal is in most of the cases to
extract information from web pages and the primary
languages for this purpose appear to be Python and R.
Considering that all posts are related to Covid-19, we can
postulate that developers of scientific software from various
domains focus on Data Science techniques to analyze the
tremendous dimensions of the coronavirus outbreak. Thus,
knowledge sharing communities such as SO prove useful
not only for solving everyday technical challenges faced by
software professionals but also as a means of collaboration
and essential knowledge dissemination in cases of
emergencies or global crises. It should also be praised that
developers are willing to share the knowledge they hold to
assist fellow researchers underlining the benefits of open
source projects and communities.
RQ4: Topics of interest
The application of LDA on the corpus of post titles
confirm the overall picture obtained by RQ3. The extracted
topics reveal that during the Covid-19 pandemic developers
of scientific software are applying data science techniques
to a typical data science problem, that of analyzing and
interpreting the day-by-day changing virus-related figures.
Developers experiment with collecting data mostly through
web-scraping and in most of the cases build python, r, or
javascript applications to visualize aspects of the
phenomenon. The most frequent words associated with each
topic essentially reflect the early stages of programming in a
new environment where “how-to” questions come first and
fixing errors right after. The pattern of words possibly
implies that beyond the experienced developers, researchers
with less experience in programming have also been
attracted by the gigantic dimensions of the crisis and have
attempted to write their own applications.
All findings provide evidence that the outbreak of a
global health crisis triggers increased interest for data
collection and processing from software developers.
Although it is difficult to infer whether the interest is
professional or personal, the trend is clear. Based on the
evidences, we can assume as main motives the need for
understanding the nature of the crisis and the need for
forecasting its evolvement. We believe that these findings
are interesting and useful for all stakeholders involved in
software development (web sites, social awareness
applications, governmental services etc) either individuals
or organizations, since they provide an overall picture of the
technologies that are related to the needs and trends of a
crisis. Moreover, stakeholders involved in areas directly or
indirectly related to technology, such as financial forecasts,

biomedical research and business management are
potentially interested in the findings of the current study.
VII. THREATS TO VALIDITY
In this section, we present and discuss potential threats
to the validity of study. Regarding the internal validity, the
identification of posts related to Covid-19 topics was
performed by an automated process through the search
engine of SO. The search strings were quite broad, since we
only included general terms related to Covid-19, so as to
identify a high proportion of relevant posts but there is
always the risk of omitting questions, in which a different
terminology for the pandemic might have been used. In
addition, we have removed non-relevant posts, containing
the keywords of the search string but addressing a problem
that is associated to a general topic resulting from the
coronavirus lockdown (e.g. issues related to the utilization
of collaborative technologies). To mitigate bias from this
action, filtering was performed by the first and the second
author independently and by discussing conflicts. Moreover,
the collection, pre-processing and analysis of data were
based on mature packages of Python and R.
Regarding the decision on the number of topics which is
an important input parameter for the extraction of topics
through LDA, the selection of the optimal number is not a
trivial process. For this reason, we conducted several
experiments utilizing different values for the number of
topics having in mind the general scope of the posed
research question that is to investigate the broad topics of
discussion for coronavirus-related posts. With respect to the
interpretation of the extracted topics, the process is solely
based on the analysis conducted by reading the associated
terms, since LDA results to the identification of latent
concepts that should be reified by the practitioners of each
scientific domain.
Regarding external validity, one potential threat is the
fact that we restricted the analysis and inferential process on
questions posted in SO. Although SO is one of the most
popular Q&A sites for software developers, there are
opportunities for further research in order to compare and
generalize our findings to other knowledge sharing forums.
Additionally, we have to note the limited timeframe of the
collection phase resulting to the retrieval of a specific
number of posts, which is certainly smaller compared to
other studies investigating other more general topics.
However, we have to take into consideration that Covid-19
pandemic is an unexpected and emerging situation with
detrimental effects to any aspect of human activity and for
this reason, it triggers the adoption of a variety of
necessitated strategies and actions to understand and
mitigate the consequences of this phenomenon, even in their
infantile form. Finally, the extraction of topics of discussion
was based on the analysis conducted on the titles of posts.
Despite the fact that the title of a question is expected to
provide a general overview of the problem being asked, the
inclusion of the corpus found in the body may improve the
inferential process, even if it may also introduce some noise.

VIII. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
Covid-19 is considered by many the worst health crisis
of a generation that is challenging the world. For every
society the top priority has been the minimization of spread
and the treatment of infected people. Within the medical
approaches in the ‘arsenal of health’ to cope with the
pandemic, the paramount importance of epidemiology has
become clear. Proper policy decisions can be taken only if
we understand and predict the distribution, growth patterns
and spread mechanism of the disease. To this end, Data
Science and Information Technologies have a lot to offer.
In this study, we have focused on the interest of
scientific software developers on Covid-19 related topics
based on SO posts to shed light into their concerns, goals
and means. The results indicate an increasing interest that
matches the evolution of the pandemic; however, the
development of software to analyze the phenomenon has
just started. With respect to the information that developers
seek, the findings clearly indicate the ongoing effort to
collect, store, analyze, visualize and interpret Covid-19
related data. Collection is mostly performed through Web
scraping, with Python, R and javascript clearly being the
languages of choice.
The amount of scientific activity on challenges
pertaining to Covid-19 is expected to boom in the next few
months. Considering that all kinds of scientific studies rely
on the analysis of massive Covid-19 related information, we
also anticipate a tremendous increase in associated software
development activity. Thus, we plan to extend this study by
considering larger datasets of SO posts but also more
sources, such as open-source software repositories which
are expected to host relevant applications.
