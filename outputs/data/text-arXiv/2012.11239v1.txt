Abstract
The dynamics of COVID-19 in India are captured using a set of delay differential equations by
dividing a constant population into six compartments. The equilibrium points are calculated and
stability analysis is performed. Sensitivity analysis is performed on the parameters of the model.
Bifurcation analysis is performed and the critical delay is calculated. By formulating the spread
parameter as a function of temperature, the impact of temperature on the population is studied. We
concluded that with the decrease in temperature, the average infections in the population increases.
In view of the coming winter season in India, there will be an increase in new infections. This model
falls in line with the characteristics that increase in isolation delay increases average infections in
the population.

1. Introduction
The pandemic of COVID-19 has spread its tentacles across the world. Large number of countries
are seeing a spike in the new infections and a few experiencing second wave of the pandemic. Moving
into the winter season where influenza spreads rapidly and vaccine not being available to everyone in
the near future, the impact of temperature and isolation is an important study in fighting COVID-19.
Various models were framed to understand the dynamics in population scale in India[1, 2, 3, 4].
Since COVID-19 is asymptomatic in many cases, immediate isolation of new infections is not practical. The delay involved in identification and effective isolation plays a major role in flattening the
virus curve. A few models incorporated the impact delay on COVID-19 in India[5, 6, 7, 8]. Since
the SARS-CoV-2 virus, responsible for COVID-19, spreads faster through air, the temperature in
environment might play a role in spreading the virus. The effect of temperature on COVID-19 is
studied in a few papers[9, 10, 11, 12].
In this paper, we tried to capture the dynamics of COVID-19 in India using a system of delay differential equations from the inspiration given in [13]. The effect of temperature is also incorporated
using the spread parameters. The rest of the paper goes in this fashion. In Section 2, we proposed the
model along with the detailed explanations of delay, temperature and other parameters. In Section
3, a few important indicators like reproduction number and equilibrium points has been calculated.
The stability of equilibrium points is discussed along with the Hopf bifurcation analysis in Section 4.
In Section 5, the sensitivity analysis of sensitive parameters is given. The sensitivity analysis for the
rest of the parameters is given in Appendix 1. Section 6 deals with numerical simulations. Section
7 presents the impact of temperature and isolation on COVID-19 in India. In Section 8, conclusions

2. Mathematical Model
We frame the model equations by considering the fraction of the people in each category. We
assume a constant population(N) and divide it into six compartments as :
• S - fraction of the total population that is healthy and has never caught the infection.
• E - fraction of the total population that is exposed to infection.
• I - fraction of the total population infected by the virus and undetected.
• Q - fraction of the total population that are found positive in the test and either hospitalized
or quarantined.
• R - fraction of the total population that has recovered from the infection.
• D - fraction of the total population that are extinct due to the infection.
The proposed model is :

= β(T )S(t)I(t) − E(t) − µE(t)
= E(t) − γI(t) − pe−γτ I(t − τ ) − µI(t)

(2.1)

= pe−γτ I(t − τ ) − ρ(1 − α)Q(t − κ) − δαQ(t) − µQ(t)
= γI(t) + ρ(1 − α)Q(t − κ) − µR(t)
= δαQ(t) − µD(t)

Infectious hosts infect their neighbors at rate β. β is the expected amount of people an infected
person infects per day. That infected person can infect only S(t) people. Hence the change of S(t)
to the next day = -β S(t) I(t). Exposed individuals become infected at the rate . If an infected
individual remains infectious for τ units of time without having recovered, it enters a new state, Q
(for quarantine), with the detection probability p. Among I(t-τ ) infected persons at time t-τ , only
a fraction of them (e−γτ ) remains infectious and they are moved to quarantine Q at the rate p.
After staying in quarantine for κ days, individuals in Q compartment move to R at the rate ρ (1-α)
, where ρ is the rate at which people recover and α is the death rate. Individuals in Q compartment
die at the rate δα, where δ is the rate at which people die. Here, Ω and µ are the natural birth rate
and natural death rate respectively. We assume that Ω = µ.
All the parameters for this work are chosen in the Indian scenario from [2, 3, 4] making the
results applicable in Indian context.
We incorporated two delays in our model[3, 8]. They are :
1. Time elapsed between infection and identification(τ ) : Isolated individuals at time t were
infected at time t-τ . This delay can be accounted for both delay in testing the asymptomatic
individuals and the delay in isolating infected individuals.
2. Delay associated with recovery(κ) : Quarantined individuals stay in quarantine for κ days
after which they are recovered. We consider it to be 14 days.

Table 1: Table describing the parameter values

Among all the parameters in the proposed model, the transmission probability β may depend on
temperature[2, 10, 11, 14]. We consider β as a linear or quadratic function of temperature in similar
lines with [2, 11] as follows :
β(T ) = β0 + β1 T, β0 = 0.84, β1 = −0.00425
β(T ) = β0 − β1 (T − TM )2 ), β0 = 0.792, β1 = 0.000345, TM = 7.73
Very few infected individuals at time 0 spreads the virus. So, we take initial value as
(S(t),E(t),I(t),Q(t),R(t),D(t)) = (0.999,0,0.001,0,0,0).
The detection probability (σ) ranges from 0 to 1 depending on the effectiveness of the system.
For the preliminary analysis, we shall consider τ as 4 days[8] and p as 0.4 in the further sections.

3. Mathematical Analysis
3.1. Reproduction Number(R0 ) :
The basic reproductive number is the mean number of secondary cases that a typical infected
case will cause in a population with no immunity to the disease in the absence of interventions to
control the infection.
The variational matrix of the model computed at the infection free state ( S = 1 , E = I = Q
= R = D = 0) gives the non-negative new infection F-matrix and non-singular transition V-matrix
respectively as follows :

There are two equilibrium points of the delay model which are as follows,
The trivial equilibrium point, E0 = (1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0).

Endemic equilibrium exists if and only if E ∗ > 0. This implies that S ∗ < 1. Hence the condition is

4.0.1. Stability of Infection-free state(E0 ) :
The characteristic equation about the infection-free state(E0 ) is given as :
χ(λ) = (λ + µ)3 (λ + µ + δα + ρ(1 − α)e−κλ )(λ2 + d1 λ + d2 + e−λτ (e1 λ + e2 ))

where,
d1 = 2µ +  + γ
d2 = (γ + µ)( + µ) − β
e1 = pe−γτ
e2 = pe−γτ (µ + )
Now the characteristic equation without delays (τ = 0, κ = 0) is given as,
χ(λ) = (λ + µ)3 (λ + µ + δα + ρ(1 − α))(λ2 + d1 λ + d2 + (e1 λ + e2 ))

(2)

Using Descartes rule of sign change we see that all the roots of (2) are negative, which implies that
the disease free equilibrium E0 is locally asymptotically stable with α < 1 and (γ + µ)( + µ) > β.
Now we will analyze the stability of E0 with delays. Let us first consider the following,
(λ + µ)3 (λ + µ + δα + ρ(1 − α)e−κλ )

(3)

The three roots of this equation are : λ1,2,3 = −µ, and others are the roots of the following equation.
(λ + µ + δα + ρ(1 − α)e−κλ )

(4)

Let λ = iω. Substituting in the above equation (4) and simplifying the terms and equating the
real parts and imaginary parts, we get,
ω = ρ(1 − αcosκω)
µ + δα = ρ(1 − αsinκω)
Squaring and adding the above two equations give
ω 2 + (µ + δα)2 − ρ2 (1 − α)2 = 0

(5)

If (µ + δα)2 > ρ2 (1 − α)2 then all roots of (5) are imaginary, which implies that all roots of (4) are
negative. So far now we have all the roots of (3) to be negative provided (µ + δα)2 > ρ2 (1 − α)2 .
Now we consider the following expression of (1) and state and prove the bifurcation theorem for
E0 .
(λ2 + d1 λ + d2 + e−λτ (e1 λ + e2 )) = 0
(6)
Theorem. Let (µ + δα)2 > (1 − α)2 ρ2 and f1 > 0 and E0 be asymptotically stable without any
delay. Then
1. When the conditions d22 < e22 , γ 2 > ω 2 , d2 < ω 2 and x > y holds, the disease free equilibrium
point E0∗ of the delayed model (2.1) is locally asymptotically stable while τ < τ ∗ and is unstable
while τ > τ ∗ where

For τ = τ ∗, Hopf Bifurcation occurs as the value of τ passes through the critical value τ ∗ .
2. If d22 > e22 , then E0 is locally asymptotically stable for all τ.

Proof: The disease free equilibrium point E0 of the delayed system (2.1) will be asymptotically
stable if all the roots of the characteristic equation (6) have negative real parts. We have seen that
E0 of the non delayed system is asymptotically stable. We now check the sign of the real part of the
roots of (6) as we vary the value of the gestation delay τ .
Let λ = µ(τ ) + iω(τ ) where, µ and ω are real. Since E0 is stable for the non-delayed system and
µ(0) < 0, we will choose τ sufficiently close to 0 and use continuity of τ to prove the theorem. Let
τ > 0 be sufficiently small, then by continuity µ(τ ) < 0 and E ∗ will still remain stable. The stability
changes for some values of τ for which µ(τ ) = 0 and ω(τ ) 6= 0 that is when λ is purely imaginary.
Let τ ∗ be such that µ(τ ∗ ) = 0 and ω(τ ∗ ) 6= 0. In this case the steady state loses stability and
becomes unstable when µ(τ ) becomes positive.
By Rouche’s theorem [15] the transcendental equation (1) has roots with positive real parts if
and only if it has purely imaginary roots. Now we will assume that the characteristic equation (6)
has purely imaginary roots and then arrive at a contradiction.
Let λ = iω. Substituting in the above equation, simplifying the terms and equating the real parts
and imaginary parts, we get,
d2 − ω 2 = (−e1 ω)sin(ωτ ) − e2 cos(ωτ )
d1 ω = (−e1 ω)cos(ωτ ) + e2 sin(ωτ )
Squaring and adding the above two equations give
ω 4 + f1 ω 2 + f2 = 0

(7)

where,
f1 = d21 − 2d2 − e21
f2 = d22 − e22
If d22 > e22 then all roots of (7) are imaginary. This contradicts that ω is real therefore equation
(6) does not have purely imaginary roots. Hence by Rouche’s Theorem we conclude that all roots
of (6) have negative real parts. Therefore the disease free equilibrium point E0 is asymptotically
stable for all τ , whenever d22 > e22 .
When d22 < e22 from equation (7), we see that there is only one sign change, therefore using
Descartes rule of sign change we conclude that whenever d22 < e22 equation (7) has unique positive
root say ω ∗ . This implies that the characteristics equation (6) has a purely imaginary roots ±iω ∗ .
Now we will calculate the critical value of the delay τ ∗ based on ω ∗ .

Calculation of τ ∗ at ω ∗ :
Consider,
d2 − ω ∗2 = (−e1 ω ∗ )sin(ω ∗ τ ) − e2 cos(ω ∗ τ )
d1 ω ∗ = (−e1 ω ∗ )cos(ω ∗ τ ) + e2 sin(ω ∗ τ )
Solving the above equation for τ ∗ we get,

4.0.2. Stability of Endemic state(E∗ ) :
The characteristic equation about the infection-free state(E∗ ) is given as :
χ(λ) = (λ + µ)2 (λ + µ + δα + ρ(1 − α)e−κλ )(λ3 + a1 λ2 + a2 λ + a3 + e−λτ (b0 λ2 + b1 λ + b2 ))
where,
a1 = 3µ +  + γ + µ(R0 − 1)
a2 = (γ +  + 2µ)µR0 − pe−γτ ( + µ)
a3 = µ( + µ)[(γ + µ)(R0 − 1) − pe−γτ ]
b0 = pe−γτ
b1 = pe−γτ (µ +  + µR0 )
b2 = pe−γτ ( + µ)µR0
Now the characteristic equation without delays (τ = 0, κ = 0) is given as,
χ(λ) = (λ + µ)2 (λ + µ + δα + ρ(1 − α))(λ3 + (a1 + b0 )λ2 + (a2 + b1 )λ + a3 + b2 (e1 λ + e2 )) (11)
Using Descartes rule of sign change we see that all the roots of (11) are negative provided we
have,
1. α < 1
2. (a1 + b0 ) > 0, (b1 + a2 ) > 0, and (a3 + b2 ) > 0
Therefore with the above conditions the infected equilibrium E1 to be locally asymptotically
stable without any delay.
Now we will analyze the stability of E0 with delays. Let us first consider the following,
(λ + µ)2 (λ + µ + δα + ρ(1 − α)e−κλ )

(12)

The three roots of this equation are : λ1,2 = −µ, and others are the roots of the following equation.
(λ + µ + δα + ρ(1 − α)e−κλ )

(13)

Let λ = iω. Substituting in the above equation (13) and simplifying the terms and equating the
real parts and imaginary parts, we get,
ω = ρ(1 − αcosκω)
µ + δα = ρ(1 − αsinκω)
Squaring and adding the above two equations give
ω 2 + (µ + δα)2 − ρ2 (1 − α)2 = 0

(14)

If (µ + δα)2 > ρ2 (1 − α)2 then all roots of (14) are imaginary, which implies that all roots of (13) are
negative. So far now we have all the roots of (12) to be negative provided (µ + δα)2 > ρ2 (1 − α)2 .
Now consider the following,
(λ3 + a1 λ2 + a2 λ + a3 + e−λτ (b0 λ2 + b1 λ + b2 )) = 0
Let λ = iω. Substituting in the above equation gives :
−iω 3 − a1 ω 2 + a2 iω + a3 (cosωτ − isinωτ )(−b0 ω 2 + b1 iω + b2 = 0
Simplifying the terms and equating the real parts and imaginary parts, we get,

9

(15)

a3 − a1 ω 2 = (−a3 b1 ω)sin(ωτ ) + (a3 b0 ω 2 − a3 b2 )cos(ωτ )
a2 ω − ω 3 = (−a3 b1 ω)cos(ωτ ) − (a3 b0 ω 2 − a3 b2 )sin(ωτ )
Squaring and adding the above two equations give
ω 6 + c1 ω 4 + c2 ω 2 + c3 = 0

(16)

where,
c1 = a21 − 2a2 − a23 b20
c2 = a22 + 2a23 b0 b2 − a23 b21 − 2a1 a3
c3 = a23 (1 − b22 )
Now if c1 > 0, c2 > 0, c3 > 0 then (16) has no real roots. This implies that the characteristic
equation (15) has all roots to be negative. Therefore E ∗ is asymptotically stable. Where if c3 < 0
the we have E ∗ to be unstable. Thus from the above analysis we conclude that E ∗ is asymptotically
stable provided:
1.(µ + δα)2 > ρ2 (1 − α)2
2. c1 > 0, c2 > 0, c3 > 0
If any of the above two condition is violated then E ∗ should change its nature of being stable. Figure
4 and Figure 5 depicts the dynamics of the system for two specific values of β. We will illustrate
this by performing numerical simulations in section 6.

In this section we check the sensitivity of all the parameters of the proposed model. As each
parameter is varied in different intervals, the total infected cell population, mean infected cell population and the mean square error are plotted with respect to time. These plots are used to determine

The summary of sensitivity analysis is given in Table 3. Due to brevity, the detailed sensitivity
analysis of the rest of the parameters is given in Appendix 1.
6. Numerical Simulations
In this section with the help of the numerical simulations we verify our theoretical results. The
chosen parameter values for the model are given in the the Table 1. We have used the MATLAB
software for the simulation.
For the parameter values from Table 1, we find that f1 > 0 and (µ + δα)2 > ρ2 (1 − α)2 . The
values of d22 was found to be 0026 and e22 was found to be 0.00045. Therefore the condition d22 > e22
of Theorem 4.0.1 is satisfied. Now from Theorem 4.0.1, E0 should be asymptotically stable for all
the possible values of delay. Here we take two values of delay and check for the stability of E0 . From
Figure 15 , Figure 16, we see that the infection free equilibrium E0 is locally asymptotically stable.

Figure 15: Stability of E0 for τ ∗ = 5

Figure 16: Stability of E0 for τ ∗ = 20

With the parameter values from Table 1, we have d22 = 0.0062 and e22 = 0.0069. Therefore we
have d22 < e22 . Also γ 2 = 0.0142 > ω 2 = 0.0139 and d2 = 0.0128 < ω 2 = 0.0139. We also see that
the condition x + y = 9.4271 > z = 9.3946 is satisfied. The critical value of delay τ ∗ is calculated to
be 5.8485. Therefore from Theorem 4.0.1, we have E0 to be asymptotically stable for τ < τ ∗ and
unstable for τ > τ ∗ . From Figure 17 , Figure 18, we see that E0 is locally asymptotically stable
for τ = 5 < τ ∗ = 5.8485 and unstable for τ = 7 > τ ∗ = 5.8485. We plot the bifurcation graph in
Figure 19. From Figure 19, we see that the solutions of the system changes its nature from being
asymptotically stable to unstable as the value of τ crosses 5.5. Therefore Hopf bifurcation occurs at
τ ∗ = 5.8485.

Now we numerically check the stability of infected equilibrium E ∗ . For the parameter values
from Table 1, the infected equilibrium E ∗ was found to be (0.633, 0.093, 0.08, 0.003, 0.16, 0.02) and
we calculate the values of β = .0882 and ( + µ) ∗ (γ + µ + ρ ∗ exp−γ∗τ ) = .0559. Therefore the
existence of E ∗ is guaranteed. The values of c1 , c2 , c3 were calculated to be 0.22, 0.000035, 0.0000025
which are all positive. Also we calculate the values of (µ+δ ∗α)2 to be 0.247 and value of ρ2 ∗(1−α)2
to be 0.0017 and we see that (µ + δ ∗ α)2 > ρ2 ∗ (1 − α). Therefore from the stability analysis of E ∗
we must have E ∗ to be locally asymptotically stable for all delays. From Figure 20 and Figure 21,
we see that E ∗ is stable for all delays.
When we take the value of α to be 0.001 we see that (µ+δ∗α)2 = 0.004 < ρ2 ∗(1−α) = 0.005. This
violates the stability condition for E ∗ and we expect E ∗ to be unstable. From Figure 22, we see that
E ∗ starts loosing its stability and starts becoming unstable when we have (µ + δ ∗ α)2 < ρ2 ∗ (1 − α).

7. Effect of Temperature
7.1. Impact of Temperature :
Temperature is one of the key indicators that influence the spread of SARS-CoV-2 virus. For
temperatures ranging from -10 to 40, the average population belonging to each compartment is
calculated using dde23 method in MATLAB. Since we represented the spread parameter β as a
linear and a quadratic function of temperature, the first subplot gives the average values with
respect to β as a linear function of temperature. And the second subplot gives the average values
with respect to β as a quadratic function of temperature. Both the subplots in Figures 23, 24, 25, 26
concluded that with the decrease in temperature, the average number of infections and the average
number of deaths in a population of individuals increases.

7.2. Impact of isolation :
Isolation of infected individuals plays a very crucial role in controlling the pandemic situations.
With the infections highly probable to increase in the coming winter season, efficient isolation strategies play an important role in controlling the spike of new infections. In addition to the probability
of isolation, the delay in isolating infected individuals also play very crucial role in controlling infections. Figure 27 and Figure 28 give an idea on the impact of isolation probability and isolation
delay with respect to the new infections.
8. Conclusions
The system of delay differential equations proposed in this paper, incorporates key characteristics
of COVID-19. This includes the impact of temperature on the spread parameter β and the delay in
19

isolating infected individuals. The reproduction number is calculated and the impact of temperature
and two isolation indicators(isolation probability and isolation delay) with the temperature are
plotted. The proposed model admits two equilibria, i.e., disease free equilibrium and infection
equilibrium. The conditions for the stability of equilibrium points is obtained. The system exhibits
hopf bifurcation. The critical delay at which hopf bifurcation occurs is calculated. Sensitivity
analysis is performed for the proposed model. It is identified that a few parameters are sensitive
only at some interval. The impact of temperature and isolation on COVID-19 is observed that with
the decrease in temperature, the average number of infections and the average number of deaths
increases. This observation is in similar lines with the conclusions in [9] that 60.0% of the confirmed
cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) occurred in places where the air temperature ranged
from 5 C to 15 C, with a peak in cases at 11.54 C. With the winter season round the corner, these
results warn us of an increase in daily new infected cases and possibly a second wave of COVID-19.

Hence, the measures of face masks, sanitizers and social distancing has to be strictly followed in the
coming future to avoid any sudden spike of cases.
