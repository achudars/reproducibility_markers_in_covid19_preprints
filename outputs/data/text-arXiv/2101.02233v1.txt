Abstract
Correlated binary response data with covariates are ubiquitous in longitudinal or spatial studies. Among the existing statistical models the most well-known one for this type of data is the
multivariate probit model, which uses a Gaussian link to model dependence at the latent level.
However, a symmetric link may not be appropriate if the data are highly imbalanced. Here, we
propose a multivariate skew-elliptical link model for correlated binary responses, which includes
the multivariate probit model as a special case. Furthermore, we perform Bayesian inference for
this new model and prove that the regression coefficients have a closed-form unified skew-elliptical
posterior. The new methodology is illustrated by application to COVID-19 data from three different counties of the state of California, USA. By jointly modeling extreme spikes in weekly new
cases, our results show that the spatial dependence cannot be neglected. Furthermore, the results
also show that the skewed latent structure of our proposed model improves the flexibility of the
multivariate probit model and provides better fit to our highly imbalanced dataset.

Introduction

Correlated binary response data with covariates frequently arise in longitudinal (Fitzmaurice et al.,
1995, 2008) or spatial studies (Heagerty & Lele, 1998; Lin & Clayton, 2005). For instance, in longitudinal studies, the disease status (i.e., diseased or not diseased) is measured over time on the same
person. Similarly, in a panel study of income dynamics, the employment status information may be collected over time from the same survey participant. The multivariate probit model (Ashford & Sowden,
1970; Chib & Greenberg, 1998) is well-known for this type of data, as it describes the dependence between binary variables by a latent Gaussian link, which allows for flexible modelling of dependence, has
straightforward interpretation of the parameters and is easily amenable to Bayesian inference.

A symmetric link, however, does not always provide the best fit to a given dataset; see Chen et al.
(1999), Kim et al. (2008) for some examples. In this case, the link might be misspecified, yielding
substantial bias in the mean response estimates (Czado & Santner, 1992). Chen et al. (1999) used the
rate at which the probability of a given binary response variable approaches 0 and 1 to guide the selection
of a symmetric or asymmetric link. In other words, if the binary response data are highly imbalanced,
the rate of the probability of the random variable approaching 0 is typically very different from the one
approaching 1, so that an asymmetric link might be preferred than a symmetric link. Motivated by
this observation, a variety of flexible asymmetric link models have been proposed for univariate binary
response data. Surprisingly, to the best of our knowledge, no multivariate asymmetric link models have
previously been proposed in the literature for correlated binary responses. The purpose of this paper is
to fill this important gap by proposing a flexible multivariate skew-elliptical link model for correlated
binary responses, which includes the multivariate probit model as a special case and allows for fast and
accurate Bayesian inference; see Section 2.2 for details on the multivariate skew-elliptical distribution,
used in our model as a key building block.
Durante (2019) has proved that for the univariate probit model with Gaussian priors, the posterior of
the regression coefficients belongs to the class of unified skew-normal distributions (Arellano-Valle & Azzalini,
2006). This result has led to a similar result for the multinomial probit model (Fasano & Durante, 2020)
and a closed-form predictive probability in probit models with Gaussian process priors (Cao et al.,
2020a). In this paper we also consider Bayesian inference for our new multivariate model and prove
that the posterior of the regression coefficients belongs to the unified skew-elliptical family. The closedform and tractable posterior for the regression coefficients facilitates inference by using an algorithm
which does not rely on data-augmentation, and thus avoids the convergence and mixing issues of the
classical data-augmentation algorithms for probit models; see Johndrow et al. (2019) for a discussion of
this issue.
We illustrate the new methodology by application to COVID-19 pandemic data from three different
counties of the state of California, USA. By jointly modeling the occurrences of extreme spikes in
weekly new infected cases using our new model, we can estimate the underlying spatial dependence
structure, which might provide helpful quantitative insights into the transmission modes of the virus
and help authorities mitigate its spread. Furthermore, our model has additional skewness parameters
compared to the multivariate probit model, which improves its flexibility and makes it more appropriate
for modeling our highly imbalanced dataset.

Preliminaries: Skew-Elliptical and Unified Skew-Elliptical
Distributions

2.1

The Skew-Elliptical Distribution

The skew-elliptical distribution, originally proposed by Azzalini & Capitanio (1999), was formulated
by multiplying an elliptical density with a skewing function. Branco & Dey (2001) proposed a new
formulation of the skew-elliptical distribution by means of a conditioning mechanism. The close relationship between these two formulations is established in Azzalini & Capitanio (2003). Thanks to the
construction in terms of a conditioning mechanism, the formulation in Branco & Dey (2001) has led to
many attractive properties of this class of distribution, such as existence of stochastic representation
and closeness under marginalization and affine transformation. Fang (2003) considered a slightly wider
class of distributions than Branco & Dey (2001) by adding an extra truncation parameter, which was
later called the extended skew-elliptical distribution in Arellano-Valle & Genton (2010), and showed
that this new distribution is closed under marginalization, affine transformation and also conditioning.
Here we adopt a slightly different parametrization than Fang (2003) with the truncation parameter
taken as 0 and consider only skew-elliptical random vectors which possess densities. Let g (d+1) be a
density generator for a (d + 1)-dimensional elliptical random vector that satisfies
Z ∞
r (d+1)/2−1 g (d+1) (r)dr = Γ((d + 1)/2)π −(d+1)/2 ,
0

then a d-dimensional random vector X has a skew-elliptical distribution with location parameter vector
ξ ∈ Rd , positive-definite scale matrix Σ ∈ Rd×d , skewness parameter vector α ∈ Rd , and density
generator g (d+1) , if its density function is


x ∈ Rd ,

where σ = diag(Σ)1/2 ∈ Rd×d , q(x) = (x − ξ)⊤ Σ−1 (x − ξ), g (d) is the d-dimensional marginal density
generator induced by g (d+1) , and G(·; gq(x) ) is the cumulative distribution function of the univariate
elliptical distribution with mean 0, scale 1, and conditional density generator gq(x) (s) = g (d+1) (s +
q(x))/g (d)(q(x)). We write X ∼ SE d (ξ, Σ, α, g (d+1) ). When α = 0, the skew-elliptical distribution
reduces to an elliptical distribution.
The skew-elliptical distribution has two stochastic representations, i.e., a convolution-type representation and a conditioning-type representation; see Equations (10) and (19) in Fang (2003). The former
3

is useful for random sampling, and the latter allows us to express its cumulative distribution function
in the following simple form
F (x) = 2Gd+1 (x∗ − ξ∗ ; Σ∗ , g (d+1) ),

with x∗ = (0, x⊤ )⊤ , ξ∗ = (0, ξ ⊤ )⊤ and

where σ = diag(Σ)1/2 ∈ Rd×d , δ = (1+α⊤ Σ̄α)−1/2 Σ̄α with Σ̄ being the correlation matrix corresponding
to Σ, i.e., Σ = σ Σ̄σ, and Gd+1 (x∗ − ξ∗ ; Σ∗ , g (d+1) ) denotes the cumulative distribution function of
the (d + 1)-variate elliptical distribution with location vector ξ∗ ∈ Rd+1 , positive-definite covariance
matrix Σ∗ ∈ R(d+1)×(d+1) , and density generator g (d+1) . The positive definiteness of Σ∗ implies that the
admissible parameters of (Σ, α) are such that the matrix Σ̄ − δδ ⊤ is positive definite.
A prominent subclass of the skew-elliptical distribution is the skew-normal distribution (Azzalini,
1985; Azzalini & Dalla Valle, 1996). Specifically, when g (d+1) is the (d + 1)-variate normal density
generator, the density function of X is

f (x) = 2φd (x − ξ; Σ)Φ α⊤ σ −1 (x − ξ) ,

x ∈ Rd ,

where φd (x − ξ; Σ) denotes the probability density function of the d-variate Gaussian distribution with
mean vector ξ and covariance matrix Σ, and Φ(·) is the cumulative distribution function of the standard
normal distribution. We denote this distribution as X ∼ SN d (ξ, Σ, α). When α = 0, it reduces to
the d-dimensional normal distribution, Nd (ξ, Σ), and when d = 1 it coincides with the univariate skewnormal distribution (Azzalini, 1985).
When g (d+1) is the d-variate Student’s t density generator with ν degrees of freedom, we get another
important subclass of the skew-elliptical distribution, i.e., the skew-t distribution (Branco & Dey, 2001;
Azzalini & Capitanio, 2003; Gupta, 2003). Its density has the following form

where td (x−ξ; Σ, ν) denotes the probability density function of the d-variate t distribution with location
vector ξ, scale matrix Σ, and degrees of freedom ν, T (·; ν + d) denotes the univariate t distribution
function with degrees of freedom ν + d. We write X ∼ ST d (ξ, Σ, α, ν). When α = 0, it reduces to the
d-dimensional Student’s t distribution, and when ν → ∞, it tends to the d-dimensional skew-normal
distribution.

2.2

The Unified Skew-Elliptical Distribution

An extension of the skew-elliptical distribution is the unified skew elliptical distribution (Arellano-Valle & Genton,
2010), which aims to gain more flexibility by unifying various skew-elliptical families under the same
model. Specifically, a d-dimensional random vector X has a unified skew elliptical distribution, denoted
by X ∼ SUE d,m (ξ, Σ, Λ, τ , Γ, g (d+m) ), if its density function is

where q(x) = (x − ξ)⊤ Σ−1 (x − ξ), g (d+m) is a (d + m)-variate elliptical density generator, g (d) and
(m)

g (m) are its d-variate and m-variate marginal density generators, respectively, gq(x) (s) = g (d+m) {s +
q(x)}/g (d){q(x)}, ξ ∈ Rd is a location parameter vector, τ ∈ Rd introduces additional flexibility to
capture skewness, Γ ∈ Rm×m is a correlation matrix, and Λ ∈ Rm×d encompasses the main effect on the
skewness. When m = 1, it reduces to the extended skew-elliptical distribution (Fang, 2003), and if we
further have τ = 0, it reduces to the skew-elliptical distribution (1).
Similar to the skew-elliptical distribution, the unified skew elliptical distribution also has two special
subclasses, i.e., the unified skew-normal distribution (Arellano-Valle & Azzalini, 2006) and the unified
skew-t distribution. When g (d+m) is the (d + m)-variate normal density generator, we get the unified
skew-normal distribution with density

(2006) with a different parametrization. When g (d+m) is the (d+m)-variate Student’s t density generator
with ν degrees of freedom, we get the unified skew-t distribution with density

Posterior Inference for the Skew-Elliptical Link Model

3.1

The Skew-Elliptical Link Model

As discussed in Section 1, when modeling correlated binary data, the multivariate probit model uses a
Gaussian link to capture dependence at the “latent level”. A symmetric link, however, does not always
provide the best fit to a given dataset, in particular for binary response data that are highly imbalanced.
In this section we extend the Gaussian link to the multivariate skew-elliptical link, which includes
the skew-normal and skew-t links as special cases. Specifically, let Yij denote a binary 0/1 response
on the ith observation of the jth variable and denote by Yi = (Yi1 , . . . , YiM )⊤ the collection of the ith
∗ ⊤
observation on all M variables for i = 1, . . . , n. Let Yi∗ = (Yi1∗ , . . . , YiM
) be a vector of latent variables

capturing dependence among the components of Yi , β ∈ Rp be a vector of regression coefficients, Xi =
(xi1 , . . . , xiM )⊤ ∈ RM ×p be the data matrix for the ith observation, and denote X = (X1⊤ , . . . , Xn⊤ )⊤ ∈
RnM ×p . Then the multivariate skew-elliptical link model can be expressed as

 1, if Y ∗ > 0,

where µ ∈ Rp is a location parameter vector, Ω ∈ Rp×p is a positive-definite covariance matrix, In ∈ Rn×n

matrix, α ∈ RnM is a skewness parameter vector, and g (p+nM +1) is a (p + nM + 1)-variate elliptical
density generator.
The multivariate probit model (Chib & Greenberg, 1998) assumes that the covariates are not shared
⊤ ⊤
by the M variables Yi1 , . . . , YiM . In that case, β can be understood as β = (β1⊤ , . . . , βM
) , where
P
βj ∈ Rpj with M

understood as the vector xij = (x⊤
ij1 , . . . , xijM ) with xijk = 0 for k 6= j, so that xij β = xijj βj . This

notation of expanded vector β and xij simplifies the expression of our model (4).
To better understand the assumption on the joint distribution of β and ε in the model (4), we

6

express it in a different way. Using Proposition 2 in Fang (2003), an equivalent assumption is that
β | g (p+nM +1) ∼ SE p (µ, Ω, 0, g (p+1)),

(5)
(nM +1)

ε | β, Σ, α, g (p+nM +1) ∼ SE nM (0, In ⊗ Σ, α, gq(β)

where q(β) = (β − µ)⊤ Ω−1 (β − µ), gq(β)

),

(6)

(s) = g (p+nM +1)(s + q(β))/g (p)(q(β)), and g (p) , g (p+1) are the

p- and (p+1)-variate marginal density generators induced by the same generator g (p+nM +1) , respectively.
Assumption (5) may be understood as the prior for β, while (6) is the distributional assumption for
the latent data vector Y ∗ . From (6) we observe that β and ε are dependent, but they are conditionally
independent given q(β). This weak dependence between them is broken when g (p+nM +1) is the normal
density generator. Specifically, when g (p+nM +1) is the (p + nM + 1)-variate normal density generator,
(5) becomes the typical Gaussian prior, Np (µ, Ω), and (6) becomes ε | Σ, α ∼ SN nM (0, In ⊗ Σ, α),
which is independent of β conditional on Σ and α. If we further have α = 0, then (6) becomes ε | Σ ∼
NnM (0, In ⊗ Σ) and model (4) reduces to the well-known multivariate probit model (Ashford & Sowden,
1970; Chib & Greenberg, 1998) with a typical Gaussian prior for β. By assuming a joint distribution
for β and ε, we can gain two major advantages. The first is that we are able to account not only
for the dependence between β and ε, but also for the dependence between the different observations
Yi , i = 1, . . . , n. The second is that this assumption allows us to get a tractable posterior for β; see
Section 3.2 for more details.
From (6) we know that the admissible parameters of (Σ, α) are these such that the matrix In ⊗Σ̄−δδ ⊤
is positive definite, where Σ̄ is the correlation matrix corresponding to Σ and δ = 1 + α⊤ (In ⊗

Unified Skew Elliptical Posterior for the Regression Coefficients

In this section we prove that for the multivariate skew-elliptical link model (4), the regression coefficients
parameter β has a unified skew elliptical posterior. To prove this result, we first simplify the joint
probability mass function p(y | β, Σ, α, g (p+nM +1)) of the observed data in the following lemma.
Lemma 1. The joint probability mass function p(y | β, Σ, α, g (p+nM +1)) based on (4) can be simplified
to
(nM +1)

p(y | β, Σ, α, g (p+nM +1)) = 2GnM +1 (D∗ β; Σ∗ , gq(β)

),

where D = diag(2y − 1nM ) ∈ RnM ×nM with 1nM ∈ RnM being the vector of 1s, D∗ = 0p , (DX)⊤

Proof. Since a diagonal matrix diag(x) with x ∈ {−1, 1}nM has the property
−1
= diag(x),
diag(x)x = 1nM , and diag(x)
we have

p(y | β, Σ, α, g (p+nM +1)) = Pr(Y = y | β, Σ, α, g (p+nM +1))
= Pr(2Y − 1nM = 2y − 1nM | β, Σ, α, g (p+nM +1))

By (6), ε | β, Σ, α, g (p+nM +1) ∼ SE nM (0, In ⊗ Σ, α, gq(β)

know that
(nM +1)

(−Dε − DXβ) | β, Σ, α, g (p+nM +1) ∼ SE nM (−DXβ, D(In ⊗ Σ)D, Dα, gq(β)

).

Now we are ready to present our main result that the posterior distribution of β coincides with a
unified skew elliptical distribution.
Theorem 1. Let y = (y1⊤ , . . . , yn⊤ )⊤ be observations from the multivariate skew-elliptical link model (4)
and X = (X1⊤ , . . . , Xn⊤ )⊤ be the corresponding data matrix. Then
(β | y, Σ, α, g (p+nM +1)) ∼ SUE p,nM +1(µpost, Ωpost , Λpost, τpost, Γpost , g (p+nM +1)),
with posterior parameters
µpost = µ, Ωpost = Ω, Λpost = σ∗−1 D∗ ω, τpost = σ∗−1 D∗ µ, Γpost = Σ̄∗ ,
where D∗ ∈ R(nM +1)×p and Σ∗ ∈ R(nM +1)×(nM +1) are the matrices defined in Lemma 1, σ∗ = diag(Σ∗ )1/2 ∈
R(nM +1)×(nM +1) , Σ̄∗ is the correlation matrix corresponding to Σ∗ , i.e., Σ∗ = σ∗ Σ̄∗ σ∗ , and ω = diag(Ω)1/2 ∈
Rp×p .
Proof. The posterior density of the coefficients β is
p(β | y, Σ, α, g (p+nM +1)) ∝ p(y | β, Σ, α, g (p+nM +1)) · p(β | g (p+nM +1)).
Using Lemma 1 and the assumption (5), we have
p(β | y, Σ, α, g (p+nM +1))
(nM +1)

Hence, (β | y, Σ, α, g (p+nM +1)) ∼ SUE p,nM +1(µpost, Ωpost , Λpost, τpost , Γpost, g (p+nM +1) ).

In Bayesian regression we are mostly interested in the posterior marginals, their moments and more
complex functionals such as measures of dependence and credible intervals. Thanks to the fundamental
property of the unified skew elliptical distribution that it is closed under marginalization, conditioning
and affine transformations, this type of inference is simplified. We refer to Arellano-Valle & Genton
(2010) for details on how to obtain the parameters of the marginal distribution, conditional distribution
9

and the distribution after affine transformations. As for the calculation of the posterior moments and
credible intervals, numerical integration of the marginal posterior densities can be used. When interest
is in the posterior moments, another approach is to use the moment generating function. We refer
to Section 5 of Arellano-Valle & Genton (2010) for derivations of the moment generating function and
moments of the unified skew elliptical distribution.

3.3

Special Case 1: the Skew-Normal Link Model

The skew-normal link model is obtained when g (p+nM +1) in model (4) is the (p + nM + 1)-variate normal
density generator. In this case, the joint distributional assumption of β and ε becomes

which is equivalent to assuming

β ∼ Np (µ, Ω),

ε | Σ, α ∼ SN nM (0, In ⊗ Σ, α),

with the random vectors β and ε independent of each other given Σ and α. This implies that the prior for
β coincides with the typical weakly informative Gaussian prior, and we use a multivariate SN distribution
to model the dependence of the data at the latent level. When the skewness parameter α = 0, the
skew-normal link model reduces to the well-known multivariate probit model (Ashford & Sowden, 1970;
Chib & Greenberg, 1998).
Before analyzing the posterior of the regression coefficients, we first give the explicit expression of
the joint probability mass function p(y | β, Σ, α). Taking g (nM +1) in Lemma 1 as the normal density
generator, we directly get
p(y | β, Σ, α) = 2ΦnM +1 (D∗ β; Σ∗ ),
where D∗ and Σ∗ are defined in Lemma 1. Similarly to the multivariate probit model, if the covariates
are not shared by all the responses, the matrix Σ has to be a correlation matrix for identifiability reasons.
⊤ ⊤
This can be seen by considering Ω = (ωjm ) = CΣC ⊤ with C = diag(Ω)1/2 , β̃ = (β̃1⊤ , . . . , β̃M
) with

β̃j = ωjj βj , and α̃ = diag(In ⊗ C −1 )α, which gives p(y | β, Σ, α) = p(y | β̃, Ω, α̃). If the covariates
are shared by all the responses Y , then Σ does not need to be a correlation matrix. However, if we
assume that all the diagonal entries in Σ are equal, then Σ has to be a correlation matrix because
p(y | β, Σ, α) = p(y | bβ, b2 Σ, α) for any positive number b.
10

When α = 0, we get p(y | β, Σ) = ΦnM (DXβ; In ⊗ Σ). This result simplifies the calculation of the
joint probability of the multivariate skew-normal link model and also the probit model by expressing
it in terms of the multivariate normal distribution function. Therefore, existing fast algorithms for the
calculation of the multivariate normal probabilities can be utilized especially in high dimensions; see
Genton et al. (2018) and Cao et al. (2020b). Now we present the result that for the skew-normal link
model the posterior of β coincides with a unified skew normal distribution, which directly follows from
Theorem 1 by taking g (nM +1) as the (nM + 1)-variate normal density generator.
Corollary 1. Let y = (y1⊤ , . . . , yn⊤ )⊤ be observations from the multivariate skew-normal link model and
X = (X1⊤ , . . . , Xn⊤ )⊤ be the corresponding data matrix. Then
(β | y, Σ, α) ∼ SUN p,nM +1 (µpost, Ωpost , Λpost, τpost , Γpost),
where µpost, Ωpost , Λpost , τpost, Γpost are defined in Theorem 1.
The unified skew normal distribution, a subclass of the unified skew elliptical family, is closed under

marginalization, conditioning and affine transformations (Arellano-Valle & Azzalini, 2006; Arellano-Valle & Gent
2010). This property is useful for certain posterior inferences, such as the posterior marginals or their
moments. When interest is in sampling from the posterior distribution, the convolution-type stochastic
representation of the unified skew normal random vector is very useful. Specifically, using Equation (8)
in Arellano-Valle & Genton (2010), (β | y, Σ, α) has the following stochastic representation
d

(β | y, Σ, α) = µ + V0 + ΩD∗⊤ (D∗ ΩD∗⊤ + Σ∗ )−1 sV1 ,

where = means equality in distribution, s = diag(D∗ ΩD∗⊤ + Σ∗ )1/2 ∈ R(nM +1)×(nM +1) , V0 ∼ Np 0, Ω −

ΩD∗⊤ (D∗ ΩD∗⊤ + Σ∗ )−1 D∗ Ω is independent of V1 , which follows a (nM + 1)-variate truncated normal
distribution with location parameter 0, covariance matrix s−1 (D∗ ΩD∗⊤ + Σ∗ )s−1 and truncated below
the level −s−1 D∗ µ. This stochastic representation facilitates exact simulation from the posterior distribution; see Algorithm 1 of Durante (2019).

Special Case 2: the Skew-t Link Model

When g (p+nM +1) in model (4) is the (p + nM + 1)-variate Student’s t density generator with ν degrees
of freedom, we get the skew-t link model. Specifically, the joint distributional assumption of β and ε is

where Tp (µ, Ω, ν) denotes the Student’s t distribution with location parameter vector µ, dispersion
matrix Ω and degrees of freedom ν. The nonnegative parameter ν can be considered as a hyperparameter which controls the dependence between β and ε. As ν increases the dependence decreases,
and when ν → ∞, the skew-t link model tends to the skew-normal link model and the dependence
between them vanishes.
By taking g (nM +1) in Lemma 1 as the Student’s t density generator with ν degrees of freedom, we
get the following explicit expression of the joint probability

In practice, we typically assume a weakly informative prior for β, which means ν is often large and Ω
is often taken as a diagonal matrix with large diagonal entries. This implies that (β − µ)⊤ Ω−1 (β − µ)
is often very small compared to ν and ν ≈ ν + (β − µ)⊤ Ω−1 (β − µ). Hence, if we assume that the
diagonal entries of Σ are all equal, then Σ needs to be a correlation matrix because p(y | β, Σ, α, ν) ≈
p(y | bβ, b2 Σ, α, ν) for any positive number b. We now state the result that for the skew-t link model
the posterior of β coincides with a unified skew t distribution, which directly follows from Theorem 1
by taking g (nM +1) as the (nM + 1)-variate Student’s t density generator with ν degrees of freedom.
Corollary 2. Let y = (y1⊤ , . . . , yn⊤ )⊤ be observations from the multivariate skew-t link model and
X = (X1⊤ , . . . , Xn⊤ )⊤ be the corresponding data matrix. Then
(β | y, Σ, α, ν) ∼ SUT p,nM +1(µpost, Ωpost , Λpost , ν, τpost, Γpost),
where µpost, Ωpost , Λpost , τpost, Γpost are defined in Theorem 1.
Similarly to the unified skew normal distribution, the unified skew t distribution is also closed
under marginalization, conditioning and affine transformations (Arellano-Valle & Genton, 2010), which
simplifies the inference of the posterior marginals, their moments and functionals such as measures
of dependence and credible intervals. Thanks to the stochastic representation of the unified skew t
12

distribution, exact sampling from the distribution of (β | y, Σ, α, ν) is also feasible. Specifically, using
Equation (9) in Arellano-Valle & Genton (2010), (β | y, Σ, α, ν) has the stochastic representation

Simulation and Empirical Studies

4.1

Prior and Posterior for α and Σ

As the skew-normal link model is a limiting case of the skew-t link model when the degrees of freedom
ν tends to ∞, in this section we focus on the skew-t link model and perform a simulation study
and a real-data application. To make the model parsimonious, in both the simulation study and
empirical study we assume that the skewness parameters are the same across different observations,
i.e., α = (α1 , . . . , αM , . . . , α1 , . . . , αM )⊤ ∈ RnM , and Σ is a correlation matrix, i.e., Σ = Σ̄. The
assumption of a correlation matrix for Σ is not very restrictive because it is approximately equivalent
to assuming that all the diagonal entries in Σ are equal, as we discussed in Section 3.4. Now we specify
the prior and posterior for the skewness parameter αs = (α1 , . . . , αM )⊤ and the correlation matrix Σ̄.
Bayesian modeling of unstructured covariance or correlation matrices is a fundamental and difficult task because of the constraint of positive definiteness and the quadratic increase of the number
of parameters with respect to the number of correlated variables. More importantly, it is difficult
to specify a prior for them(Gelman et al., 2014). Typical priors for correlation matrices include the
marginally uniform prior, the jointly uniform prior (Barnard et al., 2000) and the so-called LKJ prior
(Lewandowski et al., 2009).
The marginally uniform prior means that each non-diagonal element in the correlation matrix has a
uniform marginal distribution over [−1, 1], whereas the jointly uniform prior means that the correlation
matrix has a joint uniform distribution over the compact space of valid correlation matrices. The LKJ
prior is recommended in the R library rstan (R Core Team, 2020) and has the form π(Σ̄) ∝ |Σ̄|η−1 ,

13

where |Σ̄| is the determinant of Σ̄ and η > 0 is the shape parameter of the LKJ distribution. The jointly
uniform prior is a special case of the LKJ prior when η = 1.
In this work we adopt the jointly uniform prior for Σ̄ by setting η = 1 in the LKJ prior and specify
an independent weakly informative Gaussian prior for αs . Then, using Equation (8), the joint posterior
of (Σ̄, αs ) given the data and the regression coefficients is
p(Σ̄, αs | y, β, ν) ∝ 2TnM +1

We evaluate the multivariate Student’s t probability on the right-hand side of (10) using the R library
tlrmvnmvt, which implements the classic Genz algorithm (Genz & Bretz, 1999, 2002) and exploits a
tile-low-rank algorithm (Cao et al., 2020b) to speed up the computation of the multivariate normal
and t probabilities. To avoid sampling the correlation matrix from a constrained space, we consider
the reparametrization adopted in Smith (2013) and Chin et al. (2020), which re-expresses a correlation

unconstrained parameters in LΣ̄ = (lij ) by θ, i.e., θ = {lij : i > j, i, j = 1, . . . , M}, and the M(M − 1)/2

As direct sampling from the distribution of θ, αs | y, β, ν is unknown, we propose to use a random
walk Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to generate samples from it. Specifically, we first sample α′s from
a proposal distribution with density q(· | αs ) and θ ′ from a proposal distribution with density r(· |
θ). Here we take both proposal densities q and r as symmetric normal densities, i.e., α′s | αs ∼
NM (αs , h1 IM ) and θ ′ | θ ∼ NJ (θ, h2 IJ ), J = M(M − 1)/2. Then the acceptance probability is

MCMC Sampling Scheme

As sampling from the distribution of (β | y, X, Σ̄, α) is feasible using (9) and sampling from the
distribution of (Σ̄, α | y, X, β) has been described in Section 4.1, we now combine them to construct
an MCMC sampler for the multivariate skew-t link model.

Simulation Study

In this section, we conduct a simulation study to assess the performance of our proposed Algorithm 1.
We consider three different scenarios with different values for the degrees of freedom, i.e., ν = 5, 10, 20.
In each of the scenarios, we generate a dataset with sample size n = 50, regression coefficients β =
(β1 , β2 , β3 )⊤ = (−1, 0.5, −0.5)⊤ , skewness parameter αs = (α1 , α2 , α3 )⊤ = (2, 0, −2)⊤ , and dispersion

For each of the scenarios, we fix ν to its true value, and then run Algorithm 1 for 10000 iterations,

discarding the first 3000 iterations as burn-in. The prior for β is taken as Np (0, 25Ip), the prior for
αs is NM (0, 16), and the variances h1 , h2 of the proposal normal densities in the Metropolis-Hastings
algorithm described in Section 4.1 are taken as h1 = h2 = 0.09. Table 1 displays the posterior estimates
for each of scenarios. The results show that the regression coefficients β can be quite well estimated in
all scenarios, but the skewness parameter αs and dispersion matrix Σ̄ are not easy to estimate. This
is expected as both αs and Σ̄ determine the dependence between the different binary observations in
y and such dependence enforced at the latent level cannot be easily estimated with a relatively small
sample size n. Moreover, the credible intervals appear to be more narrow for larger degrees of freedom ν,
which is due to the weaker dependence among observations (hence, larger effective sample size) implied
by larger ν.

4.4

Application to COVID-19 Pandemic Data

In this section we illustrate our methodology to COVID-19 pandemic data from different counties of the
state of California, USA, freely downloaded from the California open data portal https://data.ca.gov.
The dataset contains the number of daily new confirmed cases and deaths from March 18, 2020, to
November 24, 2020, in 58 counties of California. There is a clear weekly cyclic pattern in this dataset,
i.e., the numbers of new confirmed cases on weekdays are often much larger than those during the
16

weekends. This is possibly due to the fact that people tend to enjoy their weekends and go to the
hospital for testing after the weekend, or some testing facilities are closed during weekends. To avoid
modeling this artificial cyclic pattern, we aggregate the data and consider the weekly new confirmed
cases, resulting in n = 36 weekly observations. As n is relatively small, we here only focus on the three
most populous counties in California, i.e., Los Angeles, San Diego and Orange. Our goal here is to
jointly model the occurrence of extreme spikes in new weekly cases, i.e., “abnormal” weeks with respect
to the overall expected trend, and to detect if the spikes are spatially correlated. This informs us about
the potential transmission modes of the virus between counties, and whether an outburst in one county
may lead to an increased number of cases in another county.
To remove the obvious trend, we apply smoothing splines with five knots to the logarithm of each of
the three time series, where the logarithm is used because most epidemics grow approximately exponentially during the initial phase (Ma, 2020). Alternatively, one can try to fit the well-known susceptibleinfected-recovered (SIR) model (Anderson & May, 1979; May & Anderson, 1979) to remove the trend.
Unfortunately, this is not feasible with our dataset as it does not contain the number of daily recovered
cases. Figure 1 displays the observed data for the three counties, the smoothing splines for each time
series and the resulting residuals. We then consider a residual point as an extreme spike if it exceeds
the empirical 90% quantile of the corresponding time series, and we denote it as 1; otherwise we denote
it as 0. In this way, we get three imbalanced binary time series and we aim to model the dependence
among them.
We consider three covariates in total, i.e., an intercept, one covariate as time, and another one
as the square of time. Following the recommendation of Gelman et al. (2008), we standardize the
two temporal predictors in a preliminary step to make them have mean 0 and standard deviation
1. To assess the performance of the multivariate skew-normal link model, we consider six models
M1 , M2 , M3, M4 , M5 , M6 of different complexity. M1 , M2 , M3 are the multivariate skew-t link model
with ν = 5, 10, 20, respectively, M4 is the multivariate skew-normal model (i.e., obtained as ν → ∞),
M5 is the multivariate probit model (obtained with ν → ∞ and α = 0), and M6 is the independent
probit model (obtained with ν → ∞, Σ̄ = I, α = 0).
For each of these models, we run the Algorithm 1 for 25000 iterations and remove the first 5000
samples as burn-in. The prior for the regression parameters β is specified as Np (0, 25Ip ), and the prior
for the skewness parameters is taken as NM (0, 16IM ). The variances of the proposal densities in the
Metropolis-Hastings algorithm are taken as h1 = h2 = 0.09.
Table 2 summarizes the estimation results for all the models. The results show that the estimate

of the intercept for all the models are almost the same and are significantly negative. This is expected
as 90% of the observations are 0 and only 10% are 1. We also observe that the confidence intervals for
the correlation and skewness parameters are generally quite large (as in the simulation study), implying
that they are hard to estimate with only n = 36 observations. However, the correlation between
the counties of Orange and San Diego, i.e., Σ̄23 , seems to be quite strong, as its posterior mean for
models M1 , M2 , M3 , M4, and M5 is consistently far from zero (with an estimate close to 0.78) and its
95% credible interval always excludes zero. This indicates that these two counties are more connected
together in terms of extreme COVID-19 cases than the other pairs of counties considered, which sheds
some light into the spread of the epidemic. The extreme occurrences observed in the counties of Los
Angeles and San Diego also seem fairly strongly interconnected since the estimate of Σ13 is also quite
high, yet to a milder degree.
To compare the different fitted models, we use the Deviance Information Criterion (DIC) proposed
by Spiegelhalter et al. (2002). The DIC is the Bayesian analogue of the Akaike Information Criterion
(AIC) and is defined as
DIC = D(τ̄ ) + 2pD ,
where τ denotes the collection of all the parameters, τ̄ = E[τ | y] is its posterior mean, D(·) is a
deviance function and pD = E[D(τ ) | y] − D(τ̄ ) is the effective number of model parameters. Here we
take the deviance function D(τ ) as −2 log p(y | β, Σ̄, α, ν) when the model is the skew-t link model,
or −2 log p(y | β, Σ̄, α) when the model is the skew-normal link model, and estimate E[D(τ ) | y] by
Monte Carlo using the samples generated from Algorithm 1. The smaller the DIC value, the better
the model’s goodness-of-fit and predictive performance. We refer to Spiegelhalter et al. (2002) for other
properties about the DIC measure.
Table 3 reports the estimated DIC values for the six different models. The results show that the
multivariate skew-normal model M4 provides the best fit to the data despite its high complexity, the
multivariate probit model M5 is the second best, and the independent symmetric probit model M6 is
the worst. This has two major implications. The first is that spatial dependence plays an important
role in the spread of the epidemic and ignoring the correlation would lead to a poor fit of the extreme
spikes. The second is that adding the skewness parameter indeed improves the model’s flexibility and
can provide a better fit to our highly imbalanced dataset.

Conclusion

Although we here focus on the skew-elliptical link model, the result of a closed-form posterior for the
regression coefficients could also be obtained if we consider a more flexible class of distributions for the
assumption (6). In fact, if ε | β, Σ, α has a distribution which is closed under affine transformation,
following the proof of Lemma 1 and Theorem 1, one can show that the posterior of β coincides with
a fundamental skew distribution (Arellano-Valle & Genton, 2005). This novel result opens up new
avenues for the development of skewed link models for correlated binary data.
There are various directions for future research. As the number of observations in our dataset is
relatively small, we chose not to consider too many covariates and restricted the number of counties.
An interesting extension of our real data application would be to consider a larger dataset with more
informative covariates, such as daily weather information or population migration between different
counties. Adding such extra covariates could potentially fit the data better and provide a more detailed
and informed explanation of the spread of epidemic. Another interesting methodological extension is
to improve Algorithm 1. As we used the accept-reject algorithm of Botev (2017) within Algorithm 1
to sample from a multivariate truncated t distribution, its lack of scalability to higher dimensions is
inevitably inherited. Therefore, more efficient algorithms to sample from high-dimensional truncated
normal and t distributions would significantly improve the speed of algorithm 1. Finally, in the simulation study and data application we chose to fix the degrees of freedom ν to three different values
to facilitate inference. If one has many more observations and a more efficient algorithm to sample
from high-dimensional truncated t distribution, one can alternatively include the estimation of ν in the
