Scenarios for a post-COVID-19 world airline network

The airline industry was severely hit by the COVID-19 crisis with an average demand decrease of
about 64% (IATA, April 2020) which triggered already several bankruptcies of airline companies all
over the world. While the robustness of the world airline network (WAN) was mostly studied as an
homogeneous network, we introduce a new tool for analyzing the impact of a company failure: the
‘airline company network’ where two airlines are connected if they share at least one route segment.
Using this tool, we observe that the failure of companies well connected with others has the largest
impact on the connectivity of the WAN. We then explore how the global demand reduction affects
airlines differently, and provide an analysis of different scenarios if its stays low and does not come
back to its pre-crisis level. Using traffic data from the Official Aviation Guide (OAG) and simple
assumptions about customer’s airline choice strategies, we find that the local effective demand can
be much lower than the average one, especially for companies that are not monopolistic and share
their segments with larger companies. Even if the average demand comes back to 60% of the total
capacity, we find that between 46% and 59% of the companies could experience a reduction of more
than 50% of their traffic, depending on the type of competitive advantage that drives customer’s
airline choice. These results highlight how the complex competitive structure of the WAN weakens
its robustness when facing such a large crisis.

INTRODUCTION

We see only the beginning of the socio-economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) that
spread over the whole world in the first semester of 2020.
All sectors, agriculture, manufacturing industry, and of
course the tertiary sector will be strongly affected by
this crisis [1], and our way of life could deeply change.
In particular, the airline industry was severely hit with
many governments that enforced both domestic and international travel restrictions at various degrees. Some
countries restricted the flights from severely affected areas while others even cancelled almost all flights. These
travel restrictions did delay or interrupt the further transmission of the COVID-19 [2], but also caused great damage to the world airline network (WAN) [3], the most
important travel network in today’s world and one of the
key infrastructures of today’s global economy.
More precisely, the COVID-19 outbreak caused a decline from 44, 665 segments in the period 1-7 January
2020 to 24, 371 in the period 19-25 April 2020 (representing a decrease of 45.4%), thus impacting a large number
of companies. In order to visualize this variation, we
average over a 7-day time window the capacity (given
by the number of seats for all flights) for each company and plot the result on Fig. 1. In particular, we
show the capacity for the three biggest airline companies in China (Air China, China Southern Airlines and
China Eastern Airlines) and how their capacity dropped

companies also faced the decrease of capacity later with
the epidemic spreading over the whole world, including
Lufthansa Cargo at the end of February and Delta Airlines, American Airlines, United Airlines Cargo and Air
France during the middle of March.
This is not the first time that the WAN suffered largescale disruptions. For example the eruption of the volcano Eyjafjallajokull in 2010 not only threatened the
safety of local residents, but also seriously affected the air
traffic in Europe, by causing the cancellation of 108, 000
flights, disrupting the travel plans of 10.5 million passengers and costing the airline industry in excess of $1.7 billion in lost revenue [4, 5]. There are, however, differences
with these rare events, which brought massive losses for

2
the air industry, and the current crisis. First, it remains
unclear how long this pandemic will last. Since effect of
high temperature and high humidity on COVID-19 seems
to be limited [6], most experts do not expect that the epidemic will naturally come to an end in the summer 2020.
As a consequence, governments may have to maintain the
travel restrictions, which is definitely a strike to the whole
air industry. Second, it remains unclear how the demand
will resume back to normal, if it does so. An analysis of
the Boston Consulting Group [7] proposed various scenarios for the evolution of the air travel demand, the
most probable one being a gradual recovery stretching
into 2021 (‘prolonged U-shape’). This is motivated by
the fact that international travel is discouraged and that
borders will slowly reopen leading to a slow return of the
consumer confidence. The economic recession and the
failure of travel distributors will enhance this drop of air
travel demand. This situation could thus last a while,
and has already provoked the bankruptcies of more than
20 airlines so far [8, 9] such as Air Italy (Italy), Flybe
(UK) which was the largest independent regional airline
in Europe, Trans States Airlines (US), Compass Airlines
(US), Virgin Australia (Australia), Avianca (Colombia),
etc. Other major airlines called for multibillion bailout
in order to survive [10].
There are of course different reasons why an airline
goes bankrupt [11], but it ultimately boils down to the
lack of cash to cover the airline’s liabilities. An important ingredient is then the structure of the WAN and in
particular how the different airlines, which compose it,
are superimposed and interact with each other. Another
crucial ingredient is how customers will choose an airline
rather than another one, and it is in these extreme cases
that a competitive advantage will prove to be fundamental. In this work, we will address two aspects. First,
we will analyze the robustness of the WAN against the
bankruptcy of different airlines, and which failures are
the most dangerous for its connectivity. In this part we
will also study how the traffic can reorganize itself. In a
second part, we will consider how the global traffic demand reduction will affect different airlines, and for this
we will test various strategies of how customers choose
their airline company. For these studies, we will use real
traffic data from the Official Aviation Guide (OAG) for
the WAN (see Material and Methods).

A.

THE EFFECT OF BANKRUPTCIES ON THE
WORLD AIRLINE NETWORK
Robustness and the ‘airline company network’

Usually, the WAN is defined as the network composed
of nodes that are airports and links that represent direct
flights between two airports [12–14]. An obvious fact but
often ignored in many studies about the WAN is that
it results in fact from the superimposition of routes belonging to different airlines, leading to the well-known

emergent hub-and-spoke structure [15]. Each airline optimizes its own profit and the WAN can thus be seen
as the emerging network resulting from the choices of all
these operators. Despite this important aspect, the structure and the robustness of the WAN have mostly been
studied from a topological point of view, with a focus on
the effect on the giant connected component of node or
link removal [16–18]. However, as noted above, describing the WAN as a simple topological network might be
oversimplified, and in order to reach realistic conclusions,
it seems necessary to take into account other aspects of
this network (for a review and research agenda about
the robustness of this network, see [19]). In particular,
some works studied this important airline aspect, and
considered the WAN as a multilayer network where each
layer is a different airline company [14, 20–22]. We note
that in [22] the authors considered an interesting study
of re-scheduling of passengers after the failure of a given
segment.
Here, we will analyze the robustness of the WAN when
facing airline bankruptcies. This is different from the
usual robustness study where nodes/links are removed.
Instead, the removal of an airline implies the removal of
possibly many segments, and/or the decrease of capacity
if the segment is shared with another company, or the
complete removal of the link if the airline was the only
one operating on it. We first construct the WAN based
on the data provided by the OAG for the period 1st January - 25th April 2019 (see Material and Methods for
details). In order to analyze the robustness of this multilayer network from this point of view, we then construct
what we call here the ‘airline company network’ (ACN)
where nodes represent airline companies (the number of
nodes is here m = 849), and two nodes in this network
are connected if the corresponding companies share at
least a segment. Obviously, two airline companies can
share more than one segment and it is natural to define
the weight of a link in the ACN as the segment overlap
given by
 X
min{Ni (`), Nj (`)}


i 6= j
min{Ni , Nj }
Oij = `∈Li ∩Lj
(1)


0
i=j
where Li is the set of segments operated by company i,
Ni (`) is the capacity of company i on
Psegment ` (averaged over T = 116 days) and Ni = `∈Li Ni (`) is the
total capacity of company i. This segment overlap captures the similarity between two airline companies and
its distribution is shown in Fig. S1 in the appendix. We
observe a wide range of this overlap and while most of
the companies do not share segments with each other,
nearly 100 pairs of companies display an overlap equal to
1, indicating that either one is included in the other, or
that they are proposing exactly the same set of segments
and are thus in direct competition.
The study of this weighted ACN allows us to have a
better view of how the different airlines interact with each

other. In particular, it will help us to understand how
robust the WAN is when airlines are failing. In general,
when studying the robustness of the WAN, different link
or node removal strategies are adopted [16, 17]. Removing a link implies that all companies operating on this
segment stopped simultaneously, which is unlikely to occur in general, except in cases of airport closures which
happened for example during the eruption of the volcano Eyjafjallajokull. Here, we will consider the specific
situation where many airlines can fail. The bankruptcy
of an airline does not imply, however, that one or more
segments in the WAN will disappear, but just that its
capacity will be reduced.
Based on the segment overlap, it is natural to define
the average segment overlap of a company with its ‘neighbours’ as
1 X
Oi =
Oij ,
(2)
|Ci |
j∈Ci

where Ci = {j | Oij > 0} is the set of companies sharing
at least one segment with company i and |Ci | represents
the number of corresponding companies. A large average
segment overlap indicates that the corresponding airline
company shares many segments with others and is thus
in direct competition with them. In contrast, a small
overlap indicates a company that operates alone on some
segments and does not suffer any competition there. It is
then tempting to think that the average segment overlap
can serve as an indicator for identifying ‘critical’ companies, whose bankruptcy will induce the isolation of certain airports and cities and cause a great damage to the
connectivity of the WAN.
Classically, when ignoring the structure in terms of airline companies, the most effective strategy to destroy the
connectivity of the WAN is to remove the most central
nodes (i.e. nodes with highest betweenness centrality,
see [16, 17]) or the links with the lowest traffic [18]. As
already mentioned above, these results do not provide
much information about the impact of airline bankruptcies and the partial reduction in traffic capacity for certain segments. In order to test this influence, we first
consider the robustness of the WAN for four different
removal strategies: (i) random removal of airline companies; (ii) removal of airline companies with the largest
passenger capacity Ni ; (iii) removal of airline companies
with the largest betweenness centrality computed in the
weighted ACN; (iv) removal of airline companies with
the largest average segment overlap Oi . We note that
for strategy (iii), the calculation of the betweenness centrality in the weighted ACN relies on the shortest path
between two nodes such that the sum of weights (here
the segment overlap Oij ) is maximal among all connective paths. As most robustness analysis do, we choose
the size of the giant component (i.e. the connected subgraph with the largest number of nodes), as the measure
of the connectivity of the WAN.
We show in Fig. 2 the size of the giant component of
the WAN as a function of the fraction of the cumulative

passenger capacity of removed companies (which implies
that the intervals along the x-axis between dots are not
uniform due to the diversity of the companies’ capacities). For the strategy (ii), where we remove companies
according to their passenger capacity (from the largest
to the smallest), the variation over the x-axis is large but
the impact on the WAN is small. Sorting and removing
companies according to their betweenness centrality in
the ACN is also not very effective. Compared to these
cases, removing airline companies in a random order has
actually a larger impact on the WAN structure. However,
we observe that the last strategy (iv) is very effective:
removing companies according to their integration with
other companies seems to have the largest impact on the
WAN’s connectivity, suggesting that crucial paths in the
WAN are shared by the same set of companies. More
generally, this is a sign that in order to understand the
robustness of the WAN and the impact of the failure of
an airline company, we need to take into account its interaction with the other companies.
This discussion shows that not all airlines are equivalent and that their bankruptcy can display a large variety
of consequences. In particular, the location of the airline
in the ACN, or in other words, how it is coupled to other
companies, seems to be a crucial ingredient for understanding the impact of its bankruptcy. This leads us to
quantify how much a company has the monopoly over its
different segments and we define the monopolistic index
as
Mi =

1 X
N (`)

,
|Li |
j=1 Nj (`)

(3)

`∈Li

where |Li | is the total number of segments serviced by
company i. This index is equal or close to 1 if most the
segments of company i are dominated by i. The distribution of Mi shown in Fig. 3 indicates that there is a large
variety of companies with various degree of monopoly,
demonstrating the large diversity of the airlines companies. The peak at M = 1 indicates that there are about

segments are not shared with another company.
The importance of this feature can be checked with our
robustness test: we remove companies according to their
monopolistic index and obtain the result shown in Fig. 2.
The rapid decrease of the WAN connectivity with this
strategy confirms our conclusion about the importance
of airlines interactions for understanding the structure of
the WAN and its robustness.

Weighted Average Cost of Transfer

Rerouting after bankruptcy

An important process not considered in the robustness
analysis above is the direct consequence on passengers of
an airline company bankruptcy. These passengers have
to be rerouted and need to choose flights of other companies (when it is possible), putting extra stress on some
flights. In some cases even, the bankruptcy of companies
can isolate some cities leaving no other choices for the
passengers to find another transportation mode. In this
section, we will simulate this process for various level of
demand decrease, starting from the real data, in order
to understand the possible post-COVID-19 scenarios for
the WAN.
We denote by α ∈ [0, 1] the average demand/load ratio for all flights. We consider here the uniform case (see
the next section for other assumptions), where the actual
number of passengers for airline company i on segment `
is then αNi (`), where the capacity is Ni (`). If the company i fails, its αNi (`) passengers have to be rerouted
for each of its segment `. We assume here that passengers always choose the shortest path with less transfers
as possible. If for the segment `, there are other direct
flights provided by other companies, some lucky passengers can take them (which will be possible with α < 1).
Once the flights of current shortest path are fully occupied, the rest of the passengers will be rerouted over
the second shortest path, and so on. If all the rerouted
passengers can reach their final destinations, we compute the average number of additional transfers and the
average additional distance as the ‘cost’ of the airline’s

bankruptcy. For example, if a passenger wanted to fly
from city a to b at first, now he/she has to transfer in
city k. In this case, his/her number of additional transfers is 1 and the additional distance is (dak + dkb ) − dab ,
where dab is the distance between city a and b. In the
less favorable case where some passengers cannot reach
their destination which can happen if all flights are fully
booked, the WAN fails and we compute the number of
these stranded passengers.
We test the bankruptcy of each airline company in
the database, and use the rerouting process as described
above. We show in Fig. S2 the weighted average cost
of additional transfers with weight equal to the capacity of companies not inducing stranded passengers (see
Fig. S2(a) for the additional distance). For a low global
demand, passengers can always be rerouted without too
many problems, but with increasing α, passengers need
to make always more transfers and at the cost of a larger
distance. We also consider the total number of passengers
stranded due to the bankruptcies of airlines if they cannot
be successfully rerouted (Fig. S2(b)). As an indication,
we fit the result with a power law function and obtain the
large exponent value of 3.75, indicating a rapid increase
with α of the number of stranded passengers: when α
is of the order of 0.5, there is a significative number of
stranded passengers of about 2.5 millions.
The existence of stranded passengers depends on a critical point of demand for each airline company (denoted
by αic for company i) above which its passengers cannot transfer successfully after its bankruptcy, or in other
words: bankruptcy of company i leads to stranded passengers only for α > αic . The distribution of this demand
threshold is shown in Fig. S2(c). We observe a roughly
uniform distribution for all values of αic and a peak at
αic = 0 which corresponds to the case of cities served by
a single company. When these companies go bankrupt,
passengers have no other means to reach their destination (this is the case for approximately 300 companies).
We also observe a peak around αic ≈ 1 signaling the existence of very robust situation for which their bankruptcy
almost never lead to stranded passengers.

5

Local Effective Demand

When the global demand decreases, we have assumed
so far that all segments and all companies are affected in
the same, uniform manner. This is, however, not true in
general, and we have to test various customer’s strategies for choosing a company. A reduction in the global
demand can thus have different local consequences and
lead to very low passenger traffic demand for some companies. These are obviously the companies that will be
the most at risk and it is the focus of this part to identify
them.
We first focus on one segment ` shared by multiple
companies. Before the crisis, each company has its capacity Ni (`) on this
P segment and the total number of
seats is N (`) =
i Ni (`). We assume that the global
demand is still described by α ∈ [0, 1] for all segments
(for further studies, we could assume some geographical dependence), the actual number of passengers on this
segment is αN (`). The question is then how we remove
the (1 − α)N (`) passengers on this segment `, or equivalently, how the remaining αN (`) passengers choose their
airlines. There are many factors influencing the decision
for choosing a specific airlines, including the frequency,
reliability, price, etc. (see for example the study [23]).
We decided here to focus on two main aspects: the capacity of an airline and its rank. A large capacity usually
goes together with a large frequency and reliability, and
for the rank we use the rank list of world’s top 100 Airlines 2019 provided by Skytrax [24].
We thus consider the following 6 strategies so that all
αN (`) passengers find their seats on the flights among
these companies: (i) The first ‘Uniform’ Strategy (UN)
used as a reference: Each company receives a number of
passengers proportional to its capacity. This random case
ignores all competitive avantage but provides a benchmark for assessing the effect of other strategies. (ii) The
‘Biggest First’ Strategy (BF): Passengers are assumed to
always give preference to the company with the largest
capacity (and then to the second largest one, etc.); (iii)
‘One-Uniform’ Strategy (1UN): Passengers are assumed
to choose first the company with the highest rank (provided by [24]). If no companies on the rank list operate
on this segment, a random company will be chosen first.
After flights of the first-choice company are fully occupied, the other companies receive a number of passengers
proportional to their capacities; (iv) ‘One-Biggest First’
(1BF): Passengers are assumed to choose the company
with the highest rank first. If no companies on the rank
list are available for this segment, a random company will
be chosen. After flights of the first-choice company are
full, passengers give then their preference to the company
with the largest capacity; (v) ‘Rank-Uniform’ (RUN):
Passengers are assumed to choose companies according
to the rank list. If flights of companies on the list are occupied, the other companies receive a number of passen-

Companies with a large value of the local effective demand will have enough passengers to function normally,
while those with a low local effective demand can be
considered at risk of bankruptcy. For the strategy of

when α is equal to 36% (the estimated value of demand

without any passengers. For the 23 companies that went

give similar results, see Fig. S4). Except for the uniform
strategy, Fig. 7 shows that for the current state of air
travel demand α = 36%, more than 90% of companies
will see an actual number of passengers less than half of
their capacity in the pre-crisis state. Even if the global
demand is back to 60%, then between 46% and 59% of
the companies will have an actual number of passengers
less than half of their capacity in the pre-crisis state. In
the unlikely event that it will go back in a near future
to 80%, we still see from 11% to 36% of companies with
half of their regular traffic.

bankrupt so far, their local effective demand was in the
range [0%, 49%], consistently with the idea that a company with demand less than 50% is in financial danger.
In order to compare quantitatively these different
strategies, we show the local effective demand averaged
over all companies and its relative dispersion (equal to
the ratio of dispersion to average) in Fig. 6(a,b). For
the uniform case, where airlines are chosen completely
at random, the local effective demand of each company
is, as expected, identically equal to α (EiUN (α) ≡ α).
All other strategies produce important variations: from
Fig. 6(a) we can roughly estimate that for a demand of
36%, certain companies can experience a local reduction
of demand as low as about 30% or even less if we take into
account the dispersion which cannot be neglected (the
relative dispersion is always of order 1 - see Fig. 6(b)).
Even for a global demand of 60%, all these strategies
(except for the purely random case) predict that most
companies will experience a decrease of 50% or more of
their traffic. In order to highlight this local heterogeneity
effect, we plot in Fig. 7 the proportion of companies with
local effective demand less than 50% (We choose here
50% as this seems an already drastic reduction of the
demand that can be barely sustainable for most companies. Results for other values of the local reduction

DISCUSSION

The results in this paper are twofold. First, the impact
on the WAN connectivity of an airline company failure
depends on its coupling with other companies. If the
company shares many segments with others, its failure
will more strongly affect the WAN structure. This shows
that the impact of a bankrupted airline cannot be discussed independently from the other companies, and that
it is necessary to take into account the whole structure
of the coupling between companies - which is encoded
in the ACN introduced here. Next, we showed that the
global demand reduction can hide large heterogeneities
in its impact at the airline level. More precisely, we have
found that, depending on the customer choice strategy,
the local reduction of demand can be extremely different
from its average value, in particular in the presence of
a competitive advantage. This shows that more companies than we can expect from a simple demand reduction
argument could be strongly affected by this crisis. In
the reasonable scenario where the global demand is back
to 60% of its total capacity, our analysis suggests that
roughly half of the companies will see their traffic divided
by two. These results need naturally to be enriched by
many other details about companies, but we believe that
they pave the way for constructing a robust tool allowing
us to understand and predict the future of the WAN.

Appendix A: Segment overlap distribution

For the airline company network (ACN), we define the segment overlap between companies as
 X
min{Ni (`), Nj (`)}


i 6= j
min{Ni , Nj }
Oij =
`∈Li ∩Lj


0
i=j

(S1)

where Li is the set of segmentsPoperated by company i, Ni (`) is the capacity of company i on segment ` (averaged
over T = 116 days) and Ni = `∈Li Ni (`) is the total capacity of company i. This quantity captures the similarity
of segments operated by two different companies. The segment overlap Oij equal to 1 implies that either the set of
segments of one company is included in the set of the other one, or that they operate on exactly the same segments.
A value equal to 0 means that the corresponding companies operate over completely different sets of segments.
The distribution of segment overlap is shown in Fig. S1, and displays a wide range of values distributed in [0, 1].
We also observe that while the majority of the companies do not share any segments with each other (the highest
peak with segment overlap equal to 0), nearly 100 pairs of companies have an overlap equal to 1, meaning that they
operate over the same set of segments (or the set of segments of a company is included in the set of the other one),
indicating that these companies are in direct competition.

Appendix B: Rerouting after bankruptcy

For a given value of the demand α ∈ [0, 1], we compute the effect of rerouting the passengers. In particular, we
estimate the additional distance experienced by all the rerouted passengers (the difference of distance between new

and original routes), and count the number of stranded passengers.
For companies whose bankruptcy does not induce stranded passengers, we observe that passengers have to take
always more transfers and have to travel over longer distance with the increase of α. Fig. S2(a) shows the additional
distance travelers take in order to reach their destination. When α > 70%, passengers have to travel more than a
total of 1000 kilometers when transferring (results averaged over companies not inducing stranded passengers with
weight given by the capacity).
For companies whose bankruptcy leads to stranded passengers, the total number of stranded passengers (denoted
by Ns ) is shown in Fig. S2(b). When α is of order of 0.5, there is a significative number of passengers stranded of
about 2.5 million. The exponent τ = 3.75 of the power law function fitting (Ns ∝ ατ ) indicates the rapid growth of
the number of stranded passengers with α.
In Fig. S2(c), we show the distribution of the critical demand threshold (for each company) above which there
is a non zero number of stranded passengers. The two peaks of the demand threshold in Fig. S2(c) correspond to
two extremal types of airline companies: Companies with αic ≈ 0 dominate the segments for at least one city and
its bankruptcy will cause the isolation of the corresponding cities, while companies with αic ≈ 1 have only a few
passengers and their passengers will never experience difficulties to be rerouted after their bankruptcy.

indicates a power law fit of the form Ns ∝ ατ where the exponent is here τ = 3.75). (c) Distribution of demand threshold.

Appendix C: Local Effective Demand

The local effective demand Eis (α) is defined as
Eis (α) =

Nis (α)
,
Ni

(S1)

where Nis (α) represents the actual number of passengers for company i when passengers follow the airline choice
strategy s. Small values of this quantity allow us to identify companies at risk of bankruptcy.
We first show in Fig. S3, for the strategy of ‘Biggest First’, the distribution of the capacity of the airlines companies
with local effective demand less than 50% (computed for the global demand α = 36% which is the estimated value

10
of real demand in April 2020 by IATA). We see that even if most companies meeting this condition have a small
capacity, there are however a few large ones.
For each strategy, we compare the proportion of companies with local effective demand less than a value equal to
different thresholds 20%, 50% or 80% (Fig. S4). We observe a similar behavior for all these different thresholds. In
addition, for a given threshold, there is a critical point for α, below which the proportion of companies is above 50%.
In other words, for α less than this critical point, the proportion of companies with local effective demand less than
the threshold is larger than 50%, while for α larger than the critical point, the proportion of companies with local
effective demand less than the threshold is less than 50%. We show the value of the critical point of demand as a
function of the demand threshold and for different strategies in Fig. S5. We observe that this critical point is always
larger than the threshold, meaning that in general the local effective demand is always smaller than the global one.
