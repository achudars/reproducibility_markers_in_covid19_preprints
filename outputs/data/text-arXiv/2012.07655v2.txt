Abstract The new coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
has been declared a pandemic since March 2020 by the
World Health Organization. It consists of an emerging viral infection with respiratory tropism that could
develop atypical pneumonia. Experts emphasize the importance of early detection of those who have the COVID19 virus. In this way, patients will be isolated from other
people and the spread of the virus can be prevented.
For this reason, it has become an area of interest to
develop early diagnosis and detection methods to ensure a rapid treatment process and prevent the virus
from spreading. Since the standard testing system is
time-consuming and not available for everyone, alternative early-screening techniques have become an urgent need. In this study, the approaches used in the
detection of COVID-19 based on deep learning (DL)
algorithms, which have been popular in recent years,
have been comprehensively discussed. The advantages
and disadvantages of different approaches used in literature are examined in detail. The Computed Tomography of the chest and X-ray images give a rich representation of the patient’s lung that is less time-consuming
and allows an efficient viral pneumonia detection using
the DL algorithms. The first step is the pre-processing
of these images to remove noise. Next, deep features
are extracted using multiple types of deep models (pretrained models, generative models, generic neural networks, etc.). Finally, the classification is performed using the obtained features to decide whether the patient

1 Introduction
The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome-related
coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) started from Wuhan, China
in December 2019 and spread to all the countries worldwide. This virus caused pneumonia of unknown cytology and is named COVID-19. This infectious disease
has been classified as a public health crisis of the international community concern on January 30, 2020,
because of its high infectivity and mortality. The lack
of successful diagnosis or preventive measures has led
to a rise in the number of cases, an increase in the cost
of hospitalizations and palliative treatments. Therefore,
scientists and medical industries around the world incited to find a prompt and accurate detection of COVID19 for early prevention, screening, forecasting, drug development, and contact tracing to save more time for
the scientific community and healthcare expert to pass
to the next diagnosis stage to reduce the death rate
reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) is recommended to diagnose COVID-19. Additionally, there are studies in the literature using various
imaging methods (computed tomography (CT) and Xray). [93, 24, 85, 77, 97]. It may occur in situations that
negatively affect these methods. The changes of viruses

by the appearance of new mutations make the classifications a more challenging task [25]. Moreover, one
of the biggest problems with COVID-19 patients is viral pneumonia (VP). Differentiating between viral and
non-viral pneumonia (nVP) is not easy. Coexistence of
COVID-19 and viral pneumonia can have dire consequences.
Oxford COVID-19 Evidence Service Team Center
follows some tips in identifying these problems. Muscle
pain, loss of sense of smell and shortness of breath without pleuritic pain are the most common symptoms, especially in the case of COVID-19 infection. On the other
hand, symptoms such as bilateral positive lung findings,
tachycardia or tachypnea disproportionate to temperature, and low temperature indicate VP (not COVID19) symptoms [34]. nVP, however, is most susceptible
if it becomes rapidly unwell after a short period from
the appearance of symptoms and does not have similar symptoms of COVID-19, pleuritic pain, or purulent
sputum.
Many studies have been introduced to solve this
problem, for instance, Zhang et al. [98] proposed to
lessen the process of anomaly detection into a one-classclassification problem using a confidence aware module.
Deep learning (DL) is then used for the classification
task as shown in Figure 1. Recent reviews show that the
use of novel technology with artificial intelligence (AI)
and machine learning (ML) techniques considerably improves the screening, contact tracing, forecasting, and
drug and vaccine development with high reliability.
Since the COVID-19 pandemic started, it has been
clear that deep learning algorithms from ML technologies seem to be used extensively to detect COVID19, VP, bacterial pneumonia (BP) and other similar
cases. The advantages and disadvantages of these studies should be evaluated. In this study, it is aimed to
present a detailed review on studies using DL approaches
using various images in the literature to detect COVID19. In addition, studies that detection of COVID-19 using acoustic sound data are included.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section
2 presents the medical imaging technologies. In Section 3 we review the most important DL methods proposed to diagnose the COVID-19, as well as the recent
advanced applications. Section 4 presents some additional DL applications to fight against COVID-19 such
as acoustic analysis and human mobility estimation. In
Section 5 an overall discussion and proposed solutions
have been presented to accurately diagnose and to reduce the spread of the COVID-19. Conclusions, future
trends and challenges end the paper.

2 Medical imaging technologies versus RT-PCR
test
The medical imaging field has considerably emerged
in the last years offering reliable automated methods
for clinical decision making. It has received wide acceptance by the scientists and the medical community.
In the case of COVID-19, CT scans and X-ray images
can play a vital role in the early diagnosis of the disease. Infected patients have clinical symptoms including
cough and fever, however, an important proportion of
infected patients can be asymptomatic. In Germany, it
has been confirmed in the study of Rothe et al. [75]
that an asymptomatic patient was able to transmit the
virus to another patient. According to the study of AlTawfiq et al. [6] from 9 countries, 18 from 144 cases were
asymptomatic, the equivalent of 12.5%. The study has
been done using the RT-PCR test.
Due to the high risk of transmission of COVID-19,
accurate diagnostic methods are urgently needed to prevent the spread of the virus and for humanity to breathe
comfortably. Besides being the gold standard of the RTPCR test, the results are time consuming (requires 5 to
6 hours) to obtain.In addition, the high rate of false
detection of RT-PCR test is questioned whether it is a
good diagnostic method. [91, 55]. In this case, it is recommended that patients with typical imaging findings
should be separated ones from one another and more
than one RT-PCR test should performed to avoid misdiagnosis.

Title Suppressed Due to Excessive Length

The X-ray, however, is an efficient screening method,
it is fast at capturing, cheaper than the RT-PCR test,
and largely available worldwide. CT-scans, on the other
hand, can be obtained much faster and more accurately
in the presence of an efficient algorithm (notably DL algorithms) to accurately identify the infected patients.
In [51], it has been proven that DL offers highly promising results for medical diagnostics compared to healthcare professionals. Figure 2 presents the change that occurs in the COVID-19 pneumonia cases on some days.
In the following section, detailed information about CT
and X-ray images is presented.

2.1 Chest Computed Tomography
CT is an imaging method that uses a special x-ray beam
to create detailed scans of areas inside the body (e.g.
lungs, heart, blood vessels, airways, and lymph nodes).
These images are taken from different angles to generate tomographic images which give the possibility to
the radiographers to directly see inside the body instead
of surgery. CT images are considered to be an effective
way of making clinical decisions. They showed high efficiency in diagnosing COVID-19 especially patients with
false-negative RT-PCR results, assuming a role for the
CT as a reliable tool for COVID-19 diagnosis during
this epidemic period [49, 5, 91, 35]. Therefore, the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of
China suggested CT examination in monitoring disease
progression and controlling treatments of COVID-19 in
its 6th version of the diagnosis and treatment program
[99].

diagnosis, and control. X-ray scans are used worldwide
to diagnose the injured part and for the detection or
other diseases in order to treat patients [21]. The X-ray
facility is available even in the remotest parts and thus
X-ray images can be easily acquired for patients even
in their home or in their quarantine location. These
images have been extensively used for COVID-19 diagnosis [63]. The most common reported abnormal in
Chest X-ray (CXR) findings are ground-glass opacities
(GGOs) [95]. Figure 3 presents an example of an X-ray
scan for COVID-19 patients. CXR is the most widely
used imaging technology by researchers because it is
easily available and inexpensive. However, GGOs are
often the first sign of a diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia.

2.2 X-Ray Image
Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen has discovered the first X-ray
in 1895 during experimenting with Lenard tubes and
Crookes tubes. X-ray has a very important role in the
medical field, it can help in the prevention of infection,

DL is a subset of ML that offers considerable power
for improving the accuracy and speed of diagnosis by
automating the screening through medical imaging in
collaboration with radiologists and/or physicians. Subsequently, it has received wide acceptance and interest
by the medical community leads to emphasizing the development of such diagnostic technologies [51]. In the
following, we review the most important DL approaches
adopted to diagnose the pneumonia of COVID-19 since
its spread in December 2019 until today. Figure 4 presents
the taxonomy of these approaches using different images and acoustic features. In the following, we detail
each of the distinguished nine groups:

Fig. 4: Taxonomy of deep learning based-approaches for COVID-19 diagnosis.
3.1 Generic deep learning
Generic DL methods without any specific modification
have been proposed to detect COVID-19. For example,
Wang el al. [89] have used CT images of 5,372 patients
from 7 different cities in China to train a deep neural
network (DNN).
Pneumonia Detection Challenge dataset (RSNA) is
used in [56] to train a DL model in order to locate lung
opacities on chest radiographs. RSNA dataset contains
two classes: Normal and Pneumonia (non-normal). The
total of 16,680 images have been used from this data set
where 8,066 are from healthy class (normal), whereas
8,614 as classified as pneumonia.
The authors in [83] collected from two hospitals of in
China the CT images of 88 infected patients (COVID19), 101 patients diagnosed with bacteria pneumonia,
where the rest are healthy (86 persons). Using this dataset,
they applied a DL-based CT diagnosis system namely:
DeepPneumonia to localize the principal lesion features,
especially GGO and thus to identify the infected patients. The first step is the segmentation of the lung
region. Next, they introduced the DRE-Net (Details
Relation Extraction neural network) to draw the top-K
features in the CT images and to receive the image-level
predictions. Finally, the image-level predictions is used
to diagnose the patient.
Another generic DL framework is proposed in [96]
to automatically extract and analyze regions with high
possibility to be infected with COVID-19. To do so, the
authors applied a segmentation stage using a DL-based

technique. Then, the infected regions were processed
and quantized using specific metrics in the CT scan.
We can also find generic convolutional neural networks in which the authors use the generic CNN trained
with their datasets without any combination with other
ML algorithms or pre-trained models. For example, in
[20], the authors trained the CNN model with the data
collected from Wuhan Jin Yin-Tan hospital in order
to classify the CT images into one of the five following classes: healthy lung, COVID-19, pneumonia, nonCOVID-19 VP, BP and pulmonary tuberculosis.

3.2 Transfer learning
Transfer learning (TL) is a ML technique in which a
trained model for one task is redesigned in a related
second task (see Figure 5). This approach is explicitly
useful when there are not sufficient datasets like in the
case of COVID-19 in order to either reduce the necessary fine-tuning data size or improve performance. TL
can be used in two scenarios: supervised (with labeled
data from the target domain) or unsupervised (without any labeled data from the target domain: the pretraining process is supervised, but unsupervised during fine-tuning). A DNN is proposed in [40] to detect
COVID-19 using X-ray images. To do so, the authors
applied a TL approach on the deep Pruned EfficientNet model. Then, it has been interpolated by post-hoc
analysis to be able to explain the obtained predictions.
TL based-framework for the detection of pneumonia is

Title Suppressed Due to Excessive Length

proposed in [15]. The features have been extracted from
X-ray images using five different pre-trained models:
DenseNet121, ResNet18, GoogLeNet, AlexNet and InceptionV3. Next, an ensemble model has been added
to combine outputs from all pre-trained models. The
obtained results are as follows: accuracy of 96.4%; recall of 99.62% on non-trained data from the Guangzhou
Women and Children’s Medical Center database.
Fine-tuned deep TL with generative adversarial network (GAN) is presented in [42] to learn a limited dataset
and to avoid the overfitting problem. To do so, the authors applied the pre-trained models: Squeeznet, AlexNet,
GoogLeNet, and Resnet18 as deep TL models to detect pneumonia from chest x-rays. Applying a combination of GAN and deep transfer models enhanced
the accuracy of the proposed system and realized 99%.
After applying image preprocessing algorithms to the
chest X-ray images to identify and remove diaphragm
regions, the pre-trained VGG-16 model [81] has been
fine-tuned in [32] using the obtained images to predict
COVID-19 infected pneumonia. Another work proposed
in [8] to detect the COVID-19 in small medical image
datasets. To do so, they worked with two different data
sets from public databases. In the first dataset, there
are 224 COVID-19, 700 BP and 504 Normal X-ray images. The second dataset includes 224 COVID-19, 714
BP and VP, and 504 Normal X-ray images. They obtained 96.78% accuracy, 98.66% sensitivity and 96.46%
specificity performance values.
Multi-Channel TL-based method with X-ray images
have been proposed in [61]. Multi-channel pre-trained
ResNet model is then used to perform the diagnosis
of COVID-19. To classify the X-ray images on a oneagainst-all strategy, three ResNet models have been retrained. The three allowed classifications are: 1) normal
or diseased, 2) pneumonia or non-pneumonia, and 3)
COVID-19 or non-COVID19 individuals. The method
achieved a precision of 94% and a recall of 100%. Other
TL-based methods can be found in [60, 57, 12, 27, 1, 73,
68,53, 69].

3.3 Augmentation and Generation Techniques
Recently, generative adversarial networks (GANs) are
considered the most powerful and successful method for
data augmentation. Since the outbreak of COVID-19 is
recent, it is difficult to gather a significant amount of
radiographic images and datasets in such a short time.
Therefore, DL networks especially (CNNs) need additional training data to overcome this problem and to
enhance the efficiency of CNN in detecting COVID19 (See Figure 6). Various methods have been applied
the GANs for this reason. For instance, in [87], authors
generate more X-ray images using Auxiliary Classifier
Generative Adversarial Network (ACGAN) based on
the CovidGAN model. Accordingly, the classification
accuracy has been significantly enhanced from 85% using the CNN alone, to 95% using the ACGAN with
CovidGAN model.
Also, to handle the problem of the lack of datasets
for COVID-19, Loey et al. [52] proposed classical data
augmentation techniques along with Conditional GAN
(CGAN) on the basis of a deep transfer learning model
for COVID-19 detection using CT images. Similar representation has been used in [54] to classify the CT
images into the following four classes : the COVID-19,
normal, pneumonia bacterial, and pneumonia virus. To
do so, the authors have used a dataset of 307 images.
Three deep transfer models are then carried out in this
work for investigation. The models are the Googlenet,
Alexnet and Restnet18. three strategies have been conducted, in each strategy the authors applied a different deep TL using the three pre-trained models mentioned above. The testing accuracies achieved by the
Googlenet, Alexnet and Restnet18 are 80.6%, 85.2%
and 100%, respectively.
Another method proposed in [41] aims to generate
synthetic medical images using DL CGAN to overcome
the dataset limitation that leads to over-fitting. The
proposed model has been implemented in a form to support a lightweight architecture without transfer learning without performance degradation. It can deal with
any non-uniformity in the data distribution and the
limited accessibility of training images in the classes.
It consists of a single convolutional layer with filter size
32 and kernel 4 × 4, followed by ReLU activation function and Max Pooling layer for down-sampling the image (input representation) and enabling feature extraction. After a flatten layer there exists a dense layer of
size 128, followed by dropout and a final dense layer
with softmax activation function for a binary output.
Other methods based on data augmentation to detect
the COVID-19 can be found in [4].

3.5 Pre-trained Deep Neural Networks

3.4 Autoencoder-based models

Another ML technique to handle the problem of insufficient data for the affected COVID-19 cases is the
Autoencoder (AE) [10]. It is a neural network method
with competent data encoding and decoding strategies
used for unsupervised feature learning. The AE models
are comprised of two main steps: encoder and decoder.
The input samples are mapped typically to a lowerdimensional space with beneficial feature representation
in the encoding step. In the second step, the decoding
consists of reverting data to its original space, trying
to create data from lower space representation. Figure
7 shows the conceptual diagram of AE with its two
main steps. The advantage of adopting such unsupervised classification to handle the problem of COVID19 detection compared to its counterpart (supervised
classification) is to avoid the long time spent in assembling large amounts of data which could increase the
risk of mortality and postpones medical care. For example, in [44], the authors introduced the COVIDomaly
which aims to diagnose new COVID-19 cases using a
convolutional autoencoder framework. They tested two
strategies on the COVIDX dataset acquired from the
chest radiographs by training the model on chest Xrays: the first strategy used only healthy adults, the
second tested healthy and BP, and infected adults with
COVID-19. Using 3-fold cross-validation, they obtained
a pooled Receiver Characteristic Operator-Area Under
the Curve (ROC-AUC) of 76.52% and 69.02% with the
two strategies respectively.
In [22], the authors extracted discriminative features
from the autoencoder and Gray Level Co-occurence
Matrix using CT images. The obtained features are
then combined with random forest classifier for COVID19 detection. They achieved the following results: accuracy of 97.78%, specificity of 98.77% and recall of
96.78%. Other autoencoder-based methods can be found
in [13, 80, 43].

Pre-trained models were originally trained on existing
large-scale labeled dataset (e.g. ImageNet) and later
fine-tuned over the chest CT and X-ray images to accomplish the diagnosis process. The last layer in these
models has been removed and a new fully connected
(FC) layer is added with an output size of two that represents two separate classes (COVID-19 or normal). In
the obtained models, only the final FC layer is trained,
while other layers are initialized with pre-trained weights
[64]. These models can be a very useful solution to the
lack of large datasets for COVID-19. However, some
challenges exist. One of the risen problems here is that
the transfer across datasets from a domain to another
can lead to deterioration of performance due to the
gap existing between the domains. This is often the
case with medical images taken from different centers.
Moreover, there is an over-fitting problem with small
amounts of COVID-19 datasets. Therefore, pre-trained
models are generally used with some particular modifications in order to avoid the over-fitting problem.
In [64], eight pre-trained CNN models have been
compared including GoogleNet, AlexNet, MobileNetV2, VGG-16, SqueezeNet, ResNet-50; ResNet-34 and
Inception-V3. The obtained results for the classification
of COVID-19 from normal cases show that ResNet-34
outperformed the other pre-trained models and achieved
an accuracy of 98.33%. This evaluation has been conducted on a total of 286 scans of COVID-19 and normal classes as a training set, and 120 scans for the test
(60 scans for each class). When dealing with the augmented dataset, the total of the training scans is 1002,
where 428 scans are used for the validation and 120
scans for the test. ResNet-18 has been applied in [66]
using limited training datasets and achieved a sensitivity of 100% and 76.90% of precision for the COVID-19
class. Figures 8 and 9 show an example of AlexNet and
VGG-16 architectures respectively. DenseNet201 pretrained model is used in [39] on chest CT images. To
classify the patients into positive or negative COVID19, deep transfer learning is carried out, and obtained

a training accuracy of 99.82%, and validation accuracy of 97.48%. The extreme version of the Inception
(Xception) model is applied in [17] and achieved an
accuracy of 97.40%, f measure of 96.96%, sensitivity
of 97.09% and specificity of 97.29% for three classes
COVID-19, pneumonia, and other diseases. Hemdan et

the COVID-19 cases using X-ray images. It includes
three main steps to accomplish the diagnostic process

of the absence of public COVID-19 datasets, the experiments are carried out on 50 Chest X-ray images
where only 25 have been diagnosed with COVID-19, for
the validation. The COVIDX-Net combined the following seven different architectures of deep CNN models:
VGG-19, DenseNet121, InceptionV3, ResNetV2, InceptionResNet-V2, Xception, and the second version of Google

using the 3D Inception V1 model pre-trained on the
ImageNet dataset. The obtained accuracy was 95.78%
overall, and 99.4% on a a part of the dataset containing 1,684 COVID-19 patients. Li et al. [48] introduced a
3D DL system that aims to early detect the COVID-19,
called COVNet. The COVNet model is composed essentially of RestNet50, which have a range of CT scans as
entry and produces features for the equivalent scans.

3.7 Combination of Generic CNNs with traditional
ML algorithms

Another strategy is to use CNN models differently by
combining them with traditional ML algorithms.
In [84], the authors presented a CNN model trained
on X-ray images to recognize pneumonia. The proposed
architecture consists of a combination of the convolution, max-pooling, and rating layers. The obtained features comprise four convolutional layers, a max-pooling
layer, and a RELU activator between them. The traditional ML algorithm ANN (Artificial neural network)
is finally applied for classification. ANN and AlexNet
architecture have been combined in [9] to systematically find out COVID-19 pneumonia subjects using CT
scans. Firstly, a segmentation using ANN algorithm
is performed to localize the lungs. Next, COVID-19
classes are augmented to produce more images. Finally,
pre-trained Alexnet architecture is used in one time
with only a transfer learning process, the obtained accuracy is 98.14%. And with additional layer namely called
(Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memories) in the second time, with an accuracy 98.70%. Nour et al. [65]
proposed a scratch CNN model including five convolution layered serial network. Three ML algorithms have
been trained on the obtained deep features involving
k-NN, SVM, and DT. The highest accuracy is obtained
by the SVM with 98.97%.
Instead of using pre-trained deep CNNs only as feature extractor, in [38], two other strategies have been
conducted to accurately classify Chest X-ray images
into positive of negative COVID-19 including fine-tuning
strategy and end to end training. The following models have been used as a feature extractor : ResNet101,
VGG19, ResNet50, ResNet18, and VGG16 where SVM
is used for ML-based classification. Whereas, a new
CNN model is used for the fine-tuning strategy. Finally,
end-to-end training with a dataset of 180 COVID-19
and 200 normal is carried out as a third strategy. 94.7%
of accuracy is achieved using ResNet50 model and SVM
classifier, where fine-tuned strategy with ResNet50 model
achieved 92.6%. Finally, the end-to-end training strategy of the developed CNN model realized a 91.6% result. Deep CNN and long short-term memory (LSTM)
have been combined in [37] to diagnose COVID-19 automatically from X-ray images. The obtained accuracy
of the classification of three classes (COVID-19, normal, and other pneumonia) is 99.4%. Similar methods
that combine deep features and classical ML techniques
can be found in [77].

3.8 Ensemble models
Handling the problem of COVID-19 detection using a
single DL model without any specific addition might
not achieve a high accuracy classification using CXR
images or CT scans. For this reason, the use of many
DL models combined with each other can be a good
solution, namely: ensemble model and the learning approach is called ensemble learning. For example, the authors in [82] proposed a DL model namely Attentionbased VGG-16. This model used VGG-16 to capture
the spatial relationship between the ROIs in CXR images. By using an appropriate convolution layer (4th
pooling layer) of the VGG-16 model in addition to the
attention module, they added a novel DL model to perform fine-tuning in the classification process. In [28] ensemble of three pre-trained models including Resnet50
and VGG16 and an own small CNN is applied for a
test set of 33 new COVID-19 and 218 pneumonia cases.
The overall accuracy realized is of 91.24%. Shalaf et al.
[78] an ensemble deep transfer learning system with 15
pre-trained CNN architectures on CT images. They obtained the following results: accuracy (85%), precision
(85.7%) and recall (85.2%).
3.9 Smart phone applications
To further automate the screening of COVID-19 and to
make it faster, mobile phones can be a very interesting
framework for that due to their facility and numerous
sensors with important computing proficiencies. Specifically, a smartphone has is able to scan CT images of
COVID-19 patients to use them for analysis screening.
Moreover, multiple CT images of the same COVID-19
patient can be gathered into one smartphone for similarity examination of how disfigurement have been developed [71]. However, the computing capability of a
mobile to treat a large amount of data is lower than a
grand machine or a computer. Therefore, a lightweight
representation is needed to accomplish this task. Consequently, various recent methods have been proposed to
detect COVID-19 in mobile devices using a slight representation. In [101], a lightweight DL model namely
LightCovidNet has been offered to detect COVID-19
using a mobile platform. To enhance the performance
of the proposed model, supplementary data have been
generated and added to the training dataset using the
conditional deep convolutional GAN. In order to reduce
the memory usage of the proposed model, five units of
feed-forward CNN are built using separable convolution operators. Multi-scale features are then learned to
be suitable for the X-ray images which have been acquired from all over the world separately. Instead of

COVID-19 diagnosis and detection, various lightweight
applications have been introduced to delay the spread
of the virus. These applications could be designed to
be compatible with the capabilities of a smartphone to
further speed up their operation. Among these applications we can find: masked face recognition [30], facial
mask detection [14, 16], social distance monitoring [3,
74] and human mobility estimation [92]. Other mobilebased technique using to fight against COVID-19 has
been proposed in [58]. Using DL algorithms, the authors arrived to efficiently evaluate the level of pneumonia and thus to determine whether it is a COVID-19
case or not.

4 Deep learning for other applications
Other applications have been proposed to fight against
COVID-19 induced pneumonia, the most important are
cough detection and human mobility estimation.

4.1 Cough Detection
In addition to the DL approaches using X-ray and chest
CT scans for COVID-19 detection, scientists affirm that
audio sounds generated by the respiratory system can
be diagnosed and analyzed to decide whether the patient is infected or not. Therefore, cough analysis has
been used to screen and diagnose COVID-19. ML techniques can supply useful cues enabling the development of a diagnostic instrument. To do so, cough data
of COVID and non-COVID is required. Accordingly,
Sharma et al. [79] proposed a database called Coswara,
of respiratory sounds, namely, cough, breath, and voice.
Some experiments have been recently carried out to
screen COVID-19 from acoustic features, for example,
in [31], Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) has been used
in its new architecture, namely the Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM) to extract six speech features from a
collected dataset (i.e. Spectral centroid, Spectral Rolloff, Zero-Crossing Rate, Zero-Crossing Rate, MFCC,
and MFCC). In this work, 70% of the data was used
for training, and 30% for testing. The obtained results
show that the best accuracy is achieved for breathing
sound, reaching up to 98.2% followed by cough sounds,
an accuracy of 97% is attained. Whereas, the accuracy
of voice analysis is of 88.2%.
A smartphone application using cough-based diagnosis for COVID-19 detection is proposed in [36]. This
application is based on an AI-powered screening solution called AI4COVID-19. Its principle is to send three
3 second cough sounds to an AI engine running in the

cloud, and give a result during two minutes. To overcome the lack of COVID-19 cough training data, the
authors applied transfer learning using ESC-50 dataset
[70] that contains 50 classes of cough and non-cough
sounds acquired using a smartphone. Figure11 presents
the offered system architecture and a drawing of AI4COVID19. The obtained results show high overall accuracy of
95.60%, a sensitivity of 96.01%, a specificity of 95.19%,
and precision of 95.22%. Schuller et al. [76] studied what
computer audition could possibly contribute to the ongoing battle against the COVID-19. Other recent acoustic analysis for the detection of COVID-19 can be found
in [19, 7, 67, 72, 47, 67, 18].

4.2 Estimating Human Mobility
Human mobility (movement) is one of the main factors that promote the transmission of the virus. Policymakers find huge difficulties to find an optimal protocol to insure the social distancing and barrier measures.
To solve this problem, Bao et al. [11] proposed a system that aims to evaluate and estimate maps of people
movement responses by learning from existing ground
truth data. The proposed system is based on a DL
based-data generation called COVID-GAN. It merges
a diversity of features involving contextual features,
COVID-19 details and data history, as well as policies
from various origins such as news, reports and SafeGraph. Experiment results showed that COVID-GAN
can well imitate real-world human movement reactions
and the area-constraint-based correction can considerably upgrade the solution value. To further explain the
relation between people mobility and COVID-19 contamination, Xiong et al. [92] presented a study using
mobile device data to give more insights to decision
makers about the national mobility tendencies before
and during the pandemic.

Title Suppressed Due to Excessive Length

5 Discussion
Table 1 includes some studies conducted with DL models. It can be seen in Table 1 that studies have focused on two popular images, namely CT and X-ray
images. The most used of these is X-ray images. This
is because it is easily available everywhere. In addition,
both its low memory space and high results in its performance encouraged researchers to use X-ray images.
In addition, the greater availability of X-ray data from
COVID-19 patients in public databases has led to the
large number of these studies. In articles in the field
of medicine, it is often stated that CT images show
higher performance. However, these high accuracies are
not seen in DL based CAD systems. This may be because radiologists can easily distinguish patients from
CT images. CT images have too many cross-sections of
the same person. They are much more complex than
X-ray images. This complex situation is a disadvantage
in distinguishing them in DL methods. The combination of X-ray and CT images, performed in few studies,
also shows that it gives good results. It can be said
that studies are carried out with multi-class solutions
rather than the binary classification problem. It is seen
that studies carried out with 3D data have lower performance. It has mostly been studied with 2D data.
The results obtained from these data are very high.
Considering the number of data, it is known that DL
models work stably with a lot of data. According to
this fact, the number of data used is not sufficient. It
can be stated that this is one of the biggest problems
in the detection of COVID-19. It is very important to
compare the studies conducted with the data obtained
from many different centers. Otherwise, the accuracy of
the studies can be fooled. For this, we recommend that
data collected from many different centers be offered
to researchers from a single center. However, in studies
conducted with a small number of data, it is seen that
pre-trained models are used to ensure high model training. Especially Keras, Tensorflow, PyTorch and MATLAB also include these pre-trained models. The biggest
problem here is that these models are trained with the
ImageNet dataset. Having a lot of data belonging to
very different classes in the ImageNet dataset can reduce the trust in these models. However, it is seen that
the performances obtained are also very high.
Traditional ML algorithms are also used by using
the feature extraction part of DL models. This approach
appears to improve performance. It is generally seen
that the SVM algorithm is used. Most of the studies do not use any cross-validation (CV) method. We
think that this decreases the reliability of the results.
Because it is not known how the test data are distin-

xi

guished. A very high performance test dataset can be
created. This overestimates the results obtained. It can
be noted that a CV method should be used in which
the whole data set can be tested in studies. Although
there are many studies using DL-based methods, it is
very difficult to produce sufficiently transparent, stable
and reliable models. It was clearly stated above that
there are many parameters affecting the results.
As an alternative to the studies performed on X-ray
and CT images, researches on the detection of COVID19 are carried out with sound and cough-based acoustic
sound analysis. Alternative approaches are very important in the detection of COVID-19. It may be possible
to save more lives with real-time detection and diagnosis systems with online scanning systems installed
with mobile or computer. As a result of all these approaches, namely RT-PCR test, DL-based X-ray and
CT images, detection and acoustic examinations, it is
predicted that patients with COVID-19 can be detected
more stable and with higher accuracy. Because, considering that the epidemic started with a person, it is very
important to correctly diagnose even a person.
6 Conclusion
Although the RT-PCR test is considered the gold standard for COVID-19 diagnosis, it is time-consuming to
make a decision because of high false-negative levels in
the results. Therefore, medical imaging modalities such
as chest X-ray and chest CT scans are the best alternative according to scientists. Chest X-ray radiography
is of low cost and low radiation dose, it is available and
easy to use in general or community hospitals. This review presents a detailed study of the existing solutions
that are mainly based on DL techniques to early diagnose the COVID-19. This study gives more of an insight
into the scientists’ and decision-makers’ thought processes - not only during the wave periods but also during that of the vaccination that could require real-time
mass testing. The lack of data, however, is the mandatory problem to achieve efficient and real-time results.
Many solutions have been presented and discussed in
this review study to give more ideas to future trends and
also for eventual future diseases that might suffer from
the missing-data problem. We believe that with more
public databases, better DL based-approaches can be
developed to detect and diagnose the COVID19 accurately. Also, when policy-makers and citizens are making their best to submit to the difficult constraints of
lockdown and social distancing, AI can be used to create more intelligent robots and autonomous machines
to help health workforce and to reduce their workload
by disinfection, working in hospitals, food distributing

xii

and helping the patients. The challenge of this solution
is that people lack confidence in autonomous machines
and prefer to be served by a human even if there is
a risk of virus transmission. Moreover, entrusting chatbots to diagnose patients needs a large amount of medical data from experts. Also, the difference in languages
from a country to another makes an already difficult
task still more arduous. On the other hand, when dealing with voice analysis, there are still many challenges
to be taken up. For example, until now, annotated data
of patients’ voices are not publicly available for research
purposes of COVID-19 detection and diagnosis. Collecting these data is mostly made in unconstrained environments (i.e. in-the-wild) using smartphones or other
voice recorders. These environments are generally noisy
and contain reverberation, which leads to bad quality of
data and makes the diagnosis and detection of COVID19 more challenging. Finally, one of the most important
future trends is to concentrate on further decreasing the
false negative rate and, as far as practicable, reducing
the false positive rate by the same token to accurately
differentiate viral from BP.
