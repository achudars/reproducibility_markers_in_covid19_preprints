Abstract. This paper aims to provide reliable estimates for the COVID-19 contact rate of
a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model. From observable data on confirmed, recovered,
and deceased cases, a noisy measurement for the contact rate can be constructed. To filter out
measurement errors and seasonality, a novel unobserved components (UC) model is set up. It
specifies the log contact rate as a latent, fractionally integrated process of unknown integration
order. The fractional specification reflects key characteristics of aggregate social behavior such
as strong persistence and gradual adjustments to new information. A computationally simple
modification of the Kalman filter is introduced and is termed the fractional filter. It allows to
estimate UC models with richer long-run dynamics, and provides a closed-form expression for the
prediction error of UC models. Based on the latter, a conditional-sum-of-squares (CSS) estimator
for the model parameters is set up that is shown to be consistent and asymptotically normally
distributed. The resulting contact rate estimates for several countries are well in line with the
chronology of the pandemic, and allow to identify different contact regimes generated by policy
interventions. As the fractional filter is shown to provide precise contact rate estimates at the
end of the sample, it bears great potential for monitoring the pandemic in real time.

Introduction

Since the outbreak of COVID-19 reducing social contacts is widely viewed as the key way to
contain the spread of the virus. In terms of the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model1 ,
this relates to the contact rate, defined as the average number of contacts per person per time
unit multiplied by the probability of disease transmission between a susceptible and an infected
individual (Hethcote; 2000). The probability of disease transmission should only depend on
characteristics that are specific to the virus. Therefore, the contact rate can be interpreted
as a proxy for aggregate social behavior and is the key variable addressed by social distancing
measures. Knowing the trajectory of the contact rate would allow to draw inference on the impact
of policy measures on contact reduction, to real-time monitor the dynamics of virus dispersion,
and to design policy rules based on the current pandemic situation. Since the contact rate
itself is unobservable, appropriate methods to estimate the contact rate are required, and will be
considered in this paper.
At the early stage of the pandemic, first estimates for the natural logarithm of the contact
rate were obtained by fitting a deterministic, linear time trend with structural breaks to transformations of data on confirmed, recovered, and deceased cases (Hartl, Wälde and Weber; 2020; Lee
et al.; 2021; Liu et al.; 2021). Modeling the log contact rate by a piece-wise linear time trend was
a reasonable and pragmatic approximation given the short time series on case numbers available
at that time. However, it implies that contact rate growth evolves deterministically as a straight
line with jumps at the break dates. This assumption is likely to be violated by the behavior of
individuals. While structural breaks may be suitable to identify turning points of the contact
rate, they are inappropriate for monitoring the current pandemic situation, as breaks require at
least some post-break observations to be well identified.
This paper aims to improve estimates for the contact rate of COVID-19 by taking into account
key features of aggregate social behavior. In detail, the log contact rate, as denoted by log βt , is
modeled as an unobserved, fractionally integrated process of (unknown) order d ∈ R+ , generated
by stochastic shocks {ηi }ti=1 .2 The stochastic specification of the contact rate is motivated by
the consideration that social decisions, e.g. on whether to meet, are made conditional on the
information available at that time, e.g. on current social distancing measures or the state of the
pandemic. As information does not evolve deterministically but appears as stochastic shocks,
this suggests to treat log βt as a stochastic process generated by the information shocks {ηi }ti=1 .
Specifying log βt as a fractionally integrated process accounts for strong persistence and nonstationarity (in short: long memory) of social behavior. In contrast to structural breaks but also
to random walks, the fractional specification allows social behavior to gradually adjust to new

The SIR model – in its various variants – has recently become a popular tool to study the economic impact
of the pandemic and for policy simulations, see Acemoglu et al. (2020); Avery et al. (2020); Korolev (2021); Liu
et al. (2021) among others.

Fractional integration techniques have been found useful for describing the aggregate behavior of individuals
in a variety of applications, e.g. for explaining the Deaton paradox (Diebold and Rudebusch; 1991) and for the
estimation of the business cycle (Hartl, Tschernig and Weber; 2020).

information both at the individual and at the aggregate level. Individually, this reflects a gradual reduction or increase of contacts as new information becomes available (e.g. as new contact
restrictions are imposed), while on aggregate it allows individuals to react heterogeneously both
in terms of speed and intensity to novel information. As the persistence of the log contact rate
is unknown, the integration order d is treated as an unknown parameter to be estimated.
Methodologically, this paper contributes to the literature on time series filtering by setting
up a novel unobserved components (UC) model that does not require prior knowledge about the
integration order of the variable under study. Current UC models and related filtering techniques
rely heavily on prior assumptions about the integration order d and typically assume d = 1 (e.g.
Harvey; 1985; Morley et al.; 2003; Chang et al.; 2009) or d = 2 (e.g. Clark; 1987; Hodrick and
Prescott; 1997; Oh et al.; 2008) to be known. In contrast, the novel UC model reflects that
the degree of persistence of the log contact rate is unknown. It allows to decompose a noisy
measurement for the log contact rate that is based on a transformation of data on confirmed,
recovered, and deceased cases, into measurement errors, seasonal components, and the unobserved
log contact rate itself. As the latter is modeled by a fractionally integrated process, the model is
called the fractional UC model.
The second methodological contribution of this paper is to derive a computationally much
simpler estimator for the model parameters and the unobserved components compared to current
state space methods. Current methods typically rely on the Kalman filter to set up a conditional
(quasi-)likelihood function for the estimation of the model parameters. Given the parameter estimates, a time-varying signal for the unobserved components is then obtained from the Kalman
smoother. Both the Kalman filter and smoother become computationally infeasible when the
dimension of the state vector of UC models is high, as for fractionally integrated processes. To
address this problem, this paper proposes a computationally simple modification of the Kalman
filter and smoother that is termed the fractional filter. While filtered and smoothed estimates
from the fractional filter are identical to the Kalman filter and smoother, the fractional filter
avoids the computationally intensive recursions for the conditional variance. The fractional filter provides a closed-form expression for the prediction error of UC models, based on which a
conditional-sum-of-squares (CSS) estimator for the fractional integration order and other model
parameters is set up. While the CSS estimator has been found useful for the estimation of
ARFIMA models, see Hualde and Robinson (2011) and Nielsen (2015), it has not been considered in the UC literature so far. The CSS estimator minimizes the sum of squared prediction
errors that is proportional to the exponent in the conditional (quasi-)likelihood function based
on the Kalman filter. Due to the computational gains from the fractional filter, the CSS estimator allows to estimate UC models with richer long-run dynamics. The paper provides the
asymptotic theory for the CSS estimator, showing it to be consistent and asymptotically normally
distributed, while the finite sample properties are assessed by a Monte Carlo study.
Using data from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering
(Dong et al.; 2020, JHU CSSE), estimates for contact and reproduction rate are presented for

2

Canada, Germany, Italy, and the United States, where benefits from the new methods directly
become apparent: First, estimation results are not only well in line with the chronology of the
pandemic, but also allow to identify different contact regimes generated by the strengthening
and easing of contact restrictions. Second, a recursive window evaluation shows contact rate
estimates at the end of a truncated sample to largely overlap with those based on the full sample
information. This makes the fractional filter a suitable candidate for monitoring outbreaks at
the current frontier of the data. And third, the proposed estimation and filtering techniques are
shown to be fairly robust to under-reporting of recovered cases, which is of particular importance
for the US, as several states do not report data on recovered individuals. While under-reporting
heavily downward-biases contact and reproduction rate estimates in Lee et al. (2021), this is
shown not to be the case for the fractional filter.
The remaining paper is organized as follows: Section 2 motivates the specification of the
contact rate and sets up the fractional UC model. Section 3 introduces the fractional filter for
log βt , covers parameter estimation via the CSS estimator and presents the asymptotic theory.
Section 4 contains empirical results for Canada, Germany, Italy, and the United States, while
section 5 concludes. The appendices include proofs for consistency and asymptotic normality of
the CSS estimator as well as a Monte Carlo study on the finite sample properties.

A fractional unobserved components model for the contact
rate

To motivate the estimation of the contact rate, consider the discrete SIR model, augmented to
include deaths, which also forms the starting point of Pindyck (2020, eqn. 1–4) and Lee et al.
(2021, eqn. 2.1)
1 = S t + It + Dt + R t ,

(1)

∆It = βt St−1 It−1 − γIt−1 ,

(2)

∆Dt = γd It−1 ,

(3)

∆Rt = γr It−1 .

(4)

In (1), the (initial) population size, normalized to be one, is decomposed into St , the proportion
of the population susceptible in t, It , the fraction of the population infected in t, Dt , the fraction
that has died until t, and Rt , the proportion that has recovered until t. In (2), γ = γd + γr
denotes the rate at which infected either die, see (3), or recover, see (4), and obviously γd , γr ≥ 0.
Thus, γIt−1 denotes the fraction of outflows of infected at t. The fraction of new infections
at t is captured by βt St−1 It−1 , where St−1 It−1 can be interpreted as the average probability
of a contact being between a susceptible subject and an infected subject. βt > 0 is called the
contact (or transmission) rate. It equals the average number of contacts per person per time
unit multiplied by the probability of disease transmission between a susceptible and an infectious

3

person (Hethcote; 2000). As in Lee et al. (2021), the contact rate is allowed to be time-varying.
This reflects social behavior to change over time, e.g. in response to policy changes or to novel
information on the pandemic. Since the contact rate determines inflows into infected, see (2), it
is the key variable tackled by social distancing policies.
Based on the contact rate, the reproduction rate Rt = βt /γ can be derived. It is the average
number of infections caused by an infected subject during the infectious period 1/γ at the early
stage of the pandemic (where St−1 ≈ 1). Rt is an indicator for the current dynamics of the
pandemic, as for Rt < 1 outflows from infected exceed inflows, causing ∆It to converge, see (2)
where 0 ≤ St−1 ≤ 1. Thus, if policy seeks to contain the spread of COVID-19, then it must
control the contact rate, which controls the reproduction rate Rt .
As shown by Lee et al. (2021), from (1) to (4) a measurement for the contact rate βt can
be obtained directly: Denote Ct = It + Rt + Dt as the fraction of confirmed cases (consisting of
infected, recovered, and deceased cases) and use ∆Ct = ∆It + ∆Rt + ∆Dt together with (2) to
(4) to obtain ∆Ct = βt St−1 It−1 − γIt−1 + (γd + γr )It−1 = βt St−1 It−1 . Solving for βt yields
βt =

∆Ct
=: Yt ,
It−1 St−1

(5)

see Lee et al. (2021, eqn. 2.2). As argued there, if for each t the data (Ct , Rt , Dt ) can be observed,
then the time-varying contact rate can be calculated straightforwardly via (5) using St = 1 − Ct ,
as well as It = Ct − Rt − Dt .
Unfortunately, reported case numbers for Ct , Rt , and Dt , such as the daily data from JHU
CSSE used in the applications in section 4, suffer from measurement errors, see e.g. Hortaçsu
et al. (2021). In addition, they display a strong weekly seasonal pattern that is likely to be
driven by a varying number of tests conducted over the different days of the week (Bergman
et al.; 2020). Under the assumption that Yt is measured with a proportionally constant error
variance resulting from seasonality and measurement errors, one has the following structure for
the natural logarithm of the observable Ỹt .
Assumption 1 (Multiplicative seasonal and measurement errors). For each t, the observable Ỹt
satisfies
log Ỹt = log Yt +

with Yt as given in (5). si,t are seasonal dummies for i = 1, ..., 7, that capture the weekly patterns
P7

of reported case numbers,
i=1 αi = 0, and the measurement error ut ∼ W N (0, σu ) is white
noise.
Assumption 1 specifies an unobserved components (UC) model where the observable noisy
measurement log Ỹt is decomposed into an unobservable measurement error ut , seasonal compoP
nents 7i=1 αi si,t , and the log contact rate log βt . The log specification accounts for a proportional

4

impact of measurement errors and seasonality, and forces the contact rate to be strictly positive.
As the different components are not separately identified, an additional assumption on the
dynamic structure of the contact rate is required. Empirical models of COVID-19 case numbers
have so far assumed log βt to follow a piece-wise linear time trend with structural breaks, see
Hartl, Wälde and Weber (2020); Lee et al. (2021); Liu et al. (2021). As an alternative, the UC
literature suggests to model time-varying coefficients as random walks (see Durbin and Koopman;
2012, for an overview). Both specifications assume contact rate growth ∆ log βt only to be
contemporaneously affected either by structural breaks or by stochastic shocks, an assumption
that is likely to be violated. Reflecting that the persistence properties of social behavior, and
thus of the contact rate, are unknown, assumption 2 specifies the log contact rate as a fractionally
integrated process of unknown order d.
Assumption 2 (Specification of the contact rate). The log contact rate follows a type II fractionally integrated process of order d ∈ R+ , denoted as log βt ∼ I(d), where
∆d+ xt = ηt ,

log βt = µ + xt ,

ηt ∼ W N (0, ση2 ),

t = 1, ..., n,

µ is an intercept, and the ηt are white noise and are independent of the measurement error ut .
Under assumption 2, the log contact rate log βt is a stochastic long memory process generated
by the shocks {ηi }ti=1 . The shock ηt models the information new in t, such as news reports or
policy announcements. Social decisions, reflected in log βt , however may additionally depend on
past information ηt−1 , ..., η1 . Together, {ηi }ti=1 forms the information available at t, conditional
on which social decisions, e.g. on whether to meet, are made. The specification takes into account
that new information does not evolve deterministically, but appears as stochastic shocks, which
cannot be captured by a deterministic specification as e.g. in Lee et al. (2021).
The degree of persistence of the log contact rate is determined by the integration order d,
which controls for the persistent impact of past shocks via the fractional difference operator ∆d+ .
The latter exhibits a polynomial expansion in the lag operator L of order infinite

reflects the type II definition of fractionally integrated processes (Marinucci and Robinson; 1999).
For d = 1 the log contact rate is a random walk, which follows from plugging d = 1 into (6).
Consequently, assumption 2 encompasses the predominant specification in the UC literature.
However, assumption 2 allows for a far more general dynamic impact of past shocks η1 , ..., ηt on

While a random walk is an unweighted sum of past shocks η1 , ..., ηt , so that πi (−1) = 1 for all
i = 1, ..., t − 1, allowing d 6= 1 yields non-uniform weights of past shocks in the impulse response
function of log βt and thus a gradual adjustment of the log contact rate to new information.
This reflects that social behavior adjusts step-wise to new information both at the individual and
the aggregate level. As processing new information on the Coronavirus and revising individual
decisions (e.g. meeting friends, traveling, working from home) takes time and evolves gradually,
individuals can be expected to step-wise adjust their contacts in response to new information.
Overall, individuals will react heterogeneously both in terms of speed and intensity to novel
information: Some will anticipate new information faster than others, and the extent of reaction
will depend on individual characteristics such as risk awareness and attitudes. Such gradual
adjustments are well captured by assumption 2, in particular when 1 < d < 2: In that case,
contact rate growth ∆ log βt ∼ I(d − 1) is strongly persistent and mean-reverting, as will become
apparent in the applications in section 4. Strong persistence reflects the gradual adjustment of
social behavior to new information, while mean-reversion ensures an asymptotically declining
impact of past information to today’s contact rate growth.
The remaining assumptions are imposed mainly for technical reasons. The type II definition of
fractional integration assumes zero starting values for the fractionally integrated process by trunP
cating the polynomial expansion of the fractional difference operator, ∆d+ xt = t−1
i=0 πi (d)xt−i . It
is required to treat the asymptotically stationary (d < 1/2, from now on ‘stationary’ for brevity)
and the asymptotically nonstationary case (d > 1/2, from now on ‘nonstationary’) alongside
each other. While the type II definition may be a strong assumption for some time series, it is
plausible for the contact rate, as we have data covering roughly the whole pandemic. Thus, the
pre-sample shocks ηi , i ≤ 0, should be zero. Independence of ut and ηt follows from the characterization of ut as a measurement error that should not influence the contact rate. In general, the
assumption can be relaxed to allow for Corr(ηt , ut ) 6= 0, as for instance in correlated UC models
(Morley et al.; 2003), and will not affect the asymptotic results in section 3. The distributional
assumptions on ηt and ut are somewhat weaker than the assumption of Gaussian white noise on
which UC models typically rely (Morley et al.; 2003). They will be shown to be largely satisfied
in the applications of section 4. Finally, d > 0 is required to separately identify log βt and ut .

Parameter estimation, filtering and smoothing

In this section, the fractional filter is derived. It is a computationally simple modification of the
Kalman filter that avoids the Kalman recursions for the conditional variance. The modification
is necessary, as the Kalman filter becomes computationally infeasible for UC models when the

6

dimension of the state vector is high, as for fractionally integrated processes. The fractional filter
provides a closed-form expression for the prediction error of the UC model. Based on that, a
conditional-sum-of-squares (CSS) estimator for the model parameters is set up. It minimizes the
sum of squared prediction errors obtained from the fractional filter. The CSS estimator is shown
to be consistent and asymptotically normally distributed. Given the CSS parameter estimates,
the log contact rate can be estimated by the fractional filter given the full sample information.
Finally, estimation of the mean and seasonal components is considered.
Under assumptions 1 and 2, the fractional UC model is given by
log Ỹt = log βt +

In the following, let θ = (d, ση2 , σu2 )0 ∈ Θ denote the vector holding the parameters of (9),

D = {d ∈ R|0 < d ≤ dmax } and Ωi = {σi2 ∈ R|0 < σi2 < ∞}, i = η, u. Define Ft as the σalgebra generated by y1 , ..., yt , and let the expected value operator Eθ (zt ) of an arbitrary random
variable zt denote that expectation is taken with respect to the distribution of zt given θ, so that
Eθ0 (zt ) = E(zt ). Furthermore, let Σ (i,j) denote the (i, j)-th entry of an arbitrary matrix Σ.
Estimation of the parameters θ0 is carried out by the CSS estimator that minimizes the sum
of squared prediction errors of model (9). The prediction error is defined as the one-step ahead
forecast error of yt+1 given Ft
vt+1 (θ) = yt+1 − Eθ (yt+1 |Ft ) = yt+1 − Eθ (xt+1 |Ft ).

(10)

It depends on Eθ (xt+1 |Ft ), for which the fractional filter provides an analytical solution. The
filter is introduced in the following lemma.

The proof is contained in appendix C. As can be seen from lemma 3.1, the fractional filter

Note that estimating the parameters of the fractional UC model via the CSS estimator (12)
in combination with the fractional filter deviates from the methodological state space literature:
There, expectation and variance of xt+1 conditional on Ft are typically obtained from the Kalman
filter recursions (see e.g. Durbin and Koopman; 2012, ch. 4.3). The resulting prediction error and
its conditional variance then enter the Gaussian (quasi-)likelihood function that is maximized to
estimate θ0 . However, the Kalman filter becomes computationally infeasible when the dimension
of the state vector is high, as for fractionally integrated processes. Thus, a computationally
simpler filter is required. The fractional filter, as defined in lemma 3.1, is a modification of
the Kalman filter: Its solution for Eθ (xt+1 |Ft ) is identical to the Kalman filter (see Durbin and
Koopman; 2012, ch. 4.2), but it avoids the Kalman recursions for the conditional variance of xt+1 .
While the conditional variance is necessary for (quasi-)maximum likelihood estimation, the CSS
estimator only requires a closed-form expression for the prediction error, for which the fractional
filter is sufficient. The objective function of the CSS estimator in (12) is of course proportional to
the exponent in the conditional Gaussian (quasi-)likelihood function. However, CSS estimation
is computationally much simpler due to the fractional filter. Together, the fractional filter and
the CSS estimator provide a computationally feasible alternative to the Kalman filter and the
(quasi-)maximum likelihood estimator, particularly for UC models with richer long-run dynamics.
While the asymptotic theory of the CSS estimator is well established for ARFIMA models,
see Hualde and Robinson (2011) and Nielsen (2015), it has not yet been derived for structural
UC models. To fill this gap, theorems 3.2 and 3.3 summarize the asymptotic estimation theory
for the CSS estimator for fractional UC models. In addition, the finite sample properties are
addressed by a Monte Carlo study in appendix B. For consistency and asymptotic normality of
the CSS estimator, the moment assumptions on the shocks ηt , ut need to be strengthened.

8

Assumption 3 (Higher moments of ηt , ut ). The conditional moments of ηt , ut (conditional
on past ηt−1 , ηt−2 , ..., and ut−1 , ut−2 , ...) are finite up to order four and equal the unconditional
moments.
Theorem 3.2 (Consistency). Under assumptions 1 to 3 the CSS estimator θ̂ is consistent,
p

θ̂ −→ θ0 as n → ∞.
The proof of theorem 3.2 is given in appendix C and is carried out as follows: First, the
model in (9) is shown to be identified. Next, vt (θ), as given in (11), is shown to be integrated
of order d0 − d, and thus is stationary for d0 − d < 1/2 and nonstationary for d0 − d > 1/2.
As the asymptotic behavior of the objective function changes around the point d0 − d = 1/2,
the objective function does not uniformly converge in probability on Θ. Adopting the results of
Hualde and Robinson (2011) and Nielsen (2015), who show for ARFIMA models encompassing
the reduced form of (9) that the probability of the CSS estimator to stay in the region of the
parameter space where vt (θ) is nonstationary is asymptotically zero, the relevant region of Θ
asymptotically reduces to the region where d0 − d < 1/2 holds. Within the relevant region of the
parameter space this paper then proves weak convergence of the objective function by showing
the objective function to satisfy a uniform weak law of large numbers. This yields consistency of
the CSS estimator, see Wooldridge (1994, thm. 4.3).
Theorem 3.3 (Asymptotic normality). Under assumptions 1 to 3 the CSS estimator θ̂ is asymp√
d
totically normally distributed, n(θ̂ − θ0 ) −→ N(0, Ω0−1 ) as n → ∞.
The proof of theorem 3.3 is again contained in appendix C. Since the CSS estimator is
consistent, the asymptotic distribution theory is inferred from a Taylor expansion of the score
function about θ0 . A central limit theorem is shown to hold for the score function at θ0 , together
with a uniform weak law of large numbers for the Hessian matrix. The latter allows to evaluate
the Hessian matrix in the Taylor expansion of the score function at θ0 . Thus, the asymptotic
distribution of the CSS estimator, as given in theorem 3.3, can be inferred from solving the
√
Taylor expansion for n(θ̂ − θ0 ). As usual in the state space literature, no analytical solution to
the asymptotic variance of the CSS estimator can be provided. The parameters of the reduced
form depend non-trivially on θ, so that the partial derivatives of the reduced form cannot be
analytically derived. However, from theorem 3.3 it follows that an estimate for the parameter
covariance matrix can be obtained from the negative inverse of the Hessian matrix computed in
the numerical optimization.
Estimation of the latent component xt in (9) is considered next. In line with the methodological literature on state space models, xt is estimated by plugging the CSS estimates θ̂ into

identical to the Kalman smoother, see Durbin and Koopman (2012, ch. 4.4). However, (13) is
computationally much simpler, as it avoids the computationally intensive Kalman recursions for
the conditional variance. In line with lemma 3.1, (13) is the fractional filter for xt given Fn .
Finally, estimation of the seasonal components αi,0 , i = 1, ..., 7, and µ0 is considered. Theoretically, all parameters of the model in (8) could be estimated jointly by the CSS estimator.
But as Tschernig et al. (2013) explain, including deterministic terms in the optimization can
lead to poor results in finite samples for fractionally integrated processes, particularly when d0 is
close to unity, as the deterministic terms suffer from poor identification. They provide simulation
evidence and a line of reasoning explaining why the following two-step estimator is more robust:
In the first step, the integration order d0 is estimated using the exact local Whittle estimator of
Shimotsu (2010), which allows for unknown deterministic terms and yields dˆEW . Based on dˆEW ,
the deterministic terms µ0 , α0,1 , ..., α0,7 in

are estimated by ordinary least squares. In the second step, the objective function of the CSS
P
estimator in (12) is minimized for the adjusted log Ỹt − µ̂ − 7i=1 α̂i si,t .
As an alternative to (14), one could also eliminate the seasonal components by averaging over
P
seven neighboring observations, as 7i=1 αi,0 si,t = 0. The intercept in

could then be estimated by ordinary least squares. q determines whether averages are calculated
solely based on past data (q = 6), based on centered data around t (q = 3), or based on future
data (q = 0). While the second approach does not require to estimate α1,0 , ..., α7,0 , averaging over
seven days smooths out potential kinks in the contact rate which is problematic. Furthermore,
averaging may pollute the estimates of xt and induce spurious long memory. Finally, the choice
of q is not trivial: While for forecasting purposes q = 6 is adequate, choosing q = 0 is likely to
account best for the delay in reporting of case numbers, and obviously q = 3 may be a good

10

compromise between the two options. In the applications µ0 , α0,1 , ..., α0,7 will be estimated via
(14).

Empirical results

In this section, estimation results for the time-varying contact rate βt are presented for Canada,
Germany, Italy, and the United States. The underlying data on confirmed, recovered, and deceased cases stems from the JHU CSSE. As in Lee et al. (2021) and Liu et al. (2021), t = 1 is
set once the number of cumulative cases reaches 100. Prior smoothing as suggested by Lee et al.
(2021) and Liu et al. (2021), who use one-sided three-day rolling averages to smooth the data,
is avoided, as this likely pollutes the kinks in the contact rate that occur due to containment
measures.3
Instead of smoothing out seasonality, the data is adjusted for weekly seasonal patterns as
described at the end of section 3 using (14). The bandwidth for the exact local Whittle estimator
in (14) is set to m = bn0.65 c, which is justified by the Monte Carlo study in appendix B. Based on
the seasonally adjusted data, the parameters θ0 are estimated via the CSS estimator (12), where
100 combinations of starting values for θ0 are drawn from uniform distributions with appropriate
support (in particular d ∈ [0.5, 2]) to avoid convergence to a local optimum. However, due to
the parsimonious parametrization of the model, all combinations of starting values converged to
virtually identical optima, implying that the procedure is robust to the choice of starting values.
Plugging the CSS estimates into (13), together with µ̂ in (14), yields the log contact rate estimate
log β̂t .
The average infected period is required for Rt and is estimated by solving (2) for γ and taking
the average
γ̂ =

(16)

t=2

This reflects that the definition of recovered varies over the countries under study, particularly as
non-hospitalized persons are typically assumed to have recovered h days after they tested positive,
and h varies over the countries under study. The choice of h proportionally affects the number
of currently infected It , and thus βt is inversely proportional to h by (5). Consequently, only the
dynamics of βt should be compared over the different countries, not the absolute numbers. In
contrast, the reproduction rate Rt = βt /γ accounts for the different h when γ is estimated via
(16). If instead γ = 1/18 is fixed as in Lee et al. (2021), the dependence on h is not resolved
and countries with a higher h will exhibit a smaller reproduction rate by construction. This is
precisely the reason for the implausible estimates for Rt in Lee et al. (2021), and is solved by
3

Liu et al. (2021) argue that one-sided three-day rolling averages smooth out noise generated by the timing
of the reporting. However, the opposite should be the case, as a one-sided smoothing shifts case numbers from
past to present, while a delay in reporting shifts case numbers from present to the future. To fix the latter, a
forward-looking filter is required, not a backward-looking one, see the discussion at the end of section 3.

accounting for different h via (16).
Results are reported for Canada, Germany, and Italy in subsection 4.1. They are selected
as they are all members of the G7 and have implemented containment measures of different
strength, duration, and at different points in time, thus making a comparison interesting. For
the selected countries, there exist reliable data on confirmed, recovered, and deceased cases
provided by the JHU CSSE. As will be shown, the latter is not the case for the US, where data
on recovered subjects suffers heavily from under-reporting, yielding a severe downward-bias for
the estimated contact rate and the resulting reproduction rate Rt as reported by Lee et al. (2021).
The problem is fixed by an assumption on the average duration of an infection, and results for the
US are presented in subsection 4.2. As will become apparent there, the fractional filter is quite
robust to under-reporting of recovered cases. To monitor the pandemic in real-time, subsection
4.3 examines the precision of the fractional filter at the end of the sample.

4.1

Canada, Germany, and Italy

For Canada, figure 1 sketches the estimated log contact rate and the resulting reproduction rate
R̂t = β̂t /γ̂ in the first row. The average duration of an infection is estimated to be 1/γ̂ = 18.29
days. The second row of figure 1 displays the estimated prediction error vt (θ̂) and its estimated
autocorrelation function.
Based on the top-left panel of figure 1, several turning points of the contact rate can be
identified using a simple algorithm that defines a minimum (maximum) whenever the contact
rate βt at t is smaller (greater) than all βt+1 , ..., βt+10 , the contact rates of the next ten days.
These periods correspond to several policy regimes characterized by the strengthening and easing
of containment measures. While a small selection of policy measures is presented below, a detailed
overview is given by McCoy et al. (2020).
1. March 13 – March 21: The contact rate increases and peaks on March 21. As a
reaction, several provinces and territories declare the state of emergency between March
13 and March 22, impose gathering bans, close schools, universities, and businesses, and
cancel mass events, among others.
2. March 22 – July 5: After the implementation of containment measures the contact rate
decreases continuously. While additional containment measures such as travel restrictions
are implemented in April, several provinces and territories start to step-wise relax their
restrictions in May. On July 1, Canada’s national summer holidays begin.
3. July 6 – July 24: During the first half of the summer holidays the contact rate increases
sharply. The reproduction rate increases above unity on July 20.
4. July 25 – August 3: The contact rate slightly decreases, while the reproduction rate
remains above unity.
5. August 4 – September 30: After a short phase of reduction, contact and reproduction
rate start to increase again, while schools re-open on September 8. Canada’s prime minister
Trudeau says the second wave of COVID-19 is already underway.

6. October 1 – October 17: Contact and reproduction rate slightly decrease. Thanksgiving
takes place on October 12.
7. October 18 – November 7: After Thanksgiving, contact and reproduction rate increase
slightly. On November 3rd, Ontario introduces an incidence-based system for when to
tighten containment measures.
8. November 8 – December 23: Contact and reproduction rate exhibit a slight but steady
decrease. Reproduction rate remains above unity.
The estimated contact rate and the resulting reproduction rate are well in line with the chronology
of policy interventions. In particular, the fractional filter allows to identify turning points of the
contact rate that are not visible from the raw data that is plotted in gray color in figure 1.
The two graphs at the bottom of figure 1 illustrate how well the Canadian data fits the model
assumptions. Assumptions 1 and 2 assume the measurement error ut and the log contact rate
shock ηt to be homoscedastic white noise processes. Since θ̂ is consistent, see theorem 3.2, by
(C.1) the prediction error vt (θ̂) becomes a white noise process as n → ∞ if assumptions 1 and
2 hold. While some outliers exist, about 95% of the prediction errors lie within two standard
deviations, as the bottom-left panel illustrates. The bottom-right panel shows that there is not
much autocorrelation left in the prediction error. Given the parsimonious parametrization of the
fractional UC model, this is surprising. The two panels at the bottom of figure 1 thus substantiate
that the dynamics of the log contact rate are well captured by a fractionally integrated process.
The estimated integration order is dˆ = 1.2166, which implies that a unit shock on the contact
rate growth ∆ log βt retains 21.66% of its impact in t + 1, 13.17% in t + 2, and 9.73% in t + 3.
After one week, the impact is still 5.10%, after two weeks 2.98%, and after three weeks 2.17%,
which is due to the strong persistence of fractionally integrated processes, see assumption 2 for
the formula for πi (d − 1). The slow decay may very well describe the persistent impact of past
information shocks on today’s social behavior.
For Germany, figure 2 plots the empirical results. The average infected period is estimated to
be 1/γ̂ = 21.27 days, which is slightly greater compared to Canada and likely results from different
algorithms to estimate the number of recovered individuals. The integration order estimate is of
similar size as for Canada (dˆ = 1.2693, see table A.1). From the top-left panel of figure 2 the
following contact regimes can be identified:
1. March 2 – March 5: The contact rate starts at a comparably high level on March 2,
likely caused by Carnival celebrations and ski tourism during Germany’s winter holidays
(Felbermayr et al.; 2020). It peaks on March 5.
2. March 6 – May 2: A slight decrease at the beginning of March turns into a sharp decrease
around March 16. Measures to contain the spread of the virus, such as school closings and
event cancellations, are implemented from March 13 on. From March 22 on, gatherings of
more than two people are prohibited and several businesses are closed (Hartl, Wälde and
Weber; 2020). At the end of April, schools and businesses partly re-opened.

are relaxed and most businesses are allowed to re-open on May 6.
4. May 20 – June 10: Contact and reproduction rate slightly decrease.
5. June 11 – June 23: A short but strong increase is caused, among others, by a massive
outbreak in a meat factory (BBC News; 2020d).
6. June 24 – July 2: A slight decline follows. On June 29, summer holidays begin in
Germany’s largest state.
7. July 3 – August 11: During the summer holidays, Germany experiences a further increase
in its contact and reproduction rate.
8. August 12 – August 30: Contact and reproduction rate decrease.
9. August 31 – October 19: A slight increase of the contact rate is followed by a strong
increase at the end of September. On October 15 stricter rules for hotspots are implemented,
including mask obligations, contact restrictions, and curfews (Deutsche Welle; 2020b).
10. October 20 – November 28: Contact and reproduction rate decrease, but the latter
remains above unity. On October 28 a ‘lockdown light’ is announced for Germany, inducing
gathering restrictions and business closings among others (BBC News; 2020a).
11. November 29 – December 23: While contact and reproduction rate slightly increase,
the government announces a tightening of its lockdown measures on December 13 (BBC
News; 2020b).
Similar to Canada, the two panels at the bottom of figure 2 indicate that the model assumptions
are largely satisfied, despite little remaining autocorrelation in the prediction error.
For Italy, a slight adjustment of the data is required, as ∆Ct = 0 on June 19 and thus log Ỹt is
not defined, see (5). To adjust the single observation, averages from the neighboring observations
are used (i.e. ∆Ct = 1/3(∆Ct−1 + ∆Ct+1 )), while the adjusted cases in t − 1 and t + 1 will equal
2/3 of the reported cases. Thus, the cumulated number of reported cases is unaffected by the
adjustment.
The empirical results are displayed in figure 3. An estimate for the average infected period
is 1/γ̂ = 35.92 days, which is significantly higher than for Canada and Germany. The discussion
below (16) gives an explanation for the high variation in γ over the different countries. The
estimated integration order is dˆ = 1.4304 (see table A.1), which is somewhat greater than the
estimates for Germany and Canada, implying that a shock ηt in Italy will yield a more persistent
effect on the contact rate. This may be explained by the severity of the pandemic in Italy in
spring 2020, which likely had a long-lasting impact on social behavior. Based on the top-left
panel of figure 3 the following regimes and turning points are visible:
1. February 24 – February 25: Due to several clusters in northern Italy more than 100
cumulative cases are counted on February 23. While the contact rate peaks on February
25, epicenters in northern Italy effectively went into lockdown on February 22 (Signorelli
et al.; 2020).

2. February 26 – June 4: The contact rate exhibits the strongest decline among all countries
under study. During March, the government announces several containment measures such
as school closings, halting all non-essential businesses, and tight regulations on free movement (Signorelli et al.; 2020). During May, the lockdown is lifted gradually. It effectively
ends on June 3 (BBC News; 2020c).
3. June 5 – August 26: The contact rate exhibits a long and steep increase.
4. August 27 – September 23: A short decrease of the contact rate follows.
5. September 24 – October 24: The contact rate again increases and reaches a level as
high as at the end of March. Gatherings, restaurants, sports and school activities are again
restricted (Deutsche Welle; 2020a).
6. October 25 – December 9: The contact rate strongly declines, while additional restrictions on bars and restaurants are implemented (Deutsche Welle; 2020c).
7. December 10 – December 23: A minor increase in the contact rate is visible the days
before Christmas.
The two panels at the bottom of figure 3 are similar to Canada and Germany, and indicate that
the prediction errors are rather homoscedastic, although outliers exist, and little autocorrelation
is left.

4.2

United States

The US is treated separately, since data on recovered cases reported by the JHU CSSE seem heavily downward-biased. To see this, consider the difference between lagged cumulative confirmed,
cumulative recovered, and cumulative deceased cases for different lags h
Ct−h − Rt − Dt .

(17)

For h = 0, (17) measures the number of currently infected subjects. For small h, (17) should be
positive, as it takes some time for the infected subjects to either recover or die. As h increases,
(17) should turn negative, as an increasing number of subjects contained in the cumulative cases
Ct−h and subjects infected between t − h and t (and thus contained in Ct − Ct−h ) either recover
or die. The turning point, denoted by h̄, should be close to the average infected period 1/γ, as
long as new confirmed cases between t − h and t, i.e. Ct − Ct−h , do not explode. If they do, then
h̄ should be smaller than 1/γ, as outflows from Ct − Ct−h disproportionally increase Rt and Dt .
Figure 4 plots (17) in case numbers for lags h = 15, 18, ..., 42, 45. As can be seen, even after 45
days the difference between lagged cumulative confirmed, cumulative recovered, and cumulative
deceased cases is predominantly positive. This is at odds with the average infected periods for
Canada, Germany, and Italy as found in subsection 4.1, and indicates that data on Rt , Dt may
suffer from under-reporting. As stated by the JHU CSSE, data on recovered cases are based on
local media reports as well as on state reporting when available. US state-level recovered cases
stem from the COVID Tracking Project (www.covidtracking.com). The COVID Tracking Project

Figure 4: Difference between lagged cumulative confirmed, recovered, and deceased cases Ct−h −
Rt − Dt (in case numbers) for h = 15, 18, ..., 42, 45.
(2021) recently pointed out that several states and territories, including California and Florida,
do not report data on recovered cases, which may explain the downward-bias. In addition,
definitions of recovered cases differ considerably across states, and the majority of the states
consider a case as recovered if a certain number of days (generally between 10 and 30) after a
positive test result or symptom onset have passed and the patient has not died.
Since no reliable data on recovered cases is available for the US, an approximation is required.
In the following, it will be assumed that individuals either recover or die h̄ = 21 days after they
tested positive, Ct−21 = Dt + Rt . The assumption is justified as follows: First, it is similar to
the average infected period estimated for Germany and more conservative than the estimate for
Canada. And second, it is centered in the range of definitions for recovered individuals by the
federal states. In addition, estimates for h̄ = 18 and h̄ = 24 days are presented, which gives a
reasonable interval for the contact rate.
Under the assumption of h̄ = 21, the estimated integration order equals dˆ = 1.2499 (see table
A.1) and is very similar to the results in subsection 4.1. Estimates for contact and reproduction
rate are visualized in figure 5 and again allow to decompose the chronology of the pandemic into
different regimes:
1. March 5 – March 6: Contact and reproduction rate peak at the initial stage of the
epidemic.
2. March 7 – May 11: Contact and reproduction rate steadily decrease, despite a small
blip on March 19. The national state of emergency is declared on March 13, and several
containment measures such as business closings and stay-at-home orders are implemented
mainly during the second half of March. Depending on the state, businesses re-open from
April 20 on. More than half of the states have opened businesses on May 7 (Chernozhukov

3. May 12 – June 28: As containment measures are relaxed, contact and reproduction rate
increase slightly during the second half of May and experience a strong increase during
June.
4. June 29 – August 17: Contact and reproduction rate decline, reaching the level of May.
5. August 18 – September 21: A slight increase is visible.
6. September 22 – September 30: A short decrease follows.
7. October 1 – November 10: Contact and reproduction rate exhibit a steady increase,
reaching the June peak. Regional containment measures are implemented at the beginning
of November.
8. November 11 – November 26: Contact and reproduction rate decrease.
9. November 27 – December 7: After Thanksgiving, contact and reproduction rate experience a short increase.
10. December 8 – December 23: A decrease is visible from December 8 on.
As can be seen from figure 5, estimates for the contact rate are rather robust to the choice of
h̄. They are slightly greater for h̄ = 18, as the number of currently infected It is smaller by
construction and thus additional contacts are required to explain new confirmed cases, while
they are slightly smaller for h̄ = 24 exactly for the opposite reason. The estimated reproduction
rate is virtually identical among the three scenarios, as it is normalized by the average infected
period R̂t = β̂t /γ̂. For h̄ = 21, the two panels at the bottom of figure 5 indicate that the model
assumptions are largely satisfied, despite some weak correlation in the prediction errors. The
plots are very similar for h̄ = 18 and h̄ = 24 and thus not shown. The reproduction rate R̂t is
greater than unity during the whole sample, which contradicts the results of Lee et al. (2021)
who rely on the downward-biased data on recovered subjects from the JHU CSSE while fixing
the average infected period to be 1/γ = 18.

Monitoring the current state of the pandemic

This subsection investigates the end-of-sample properties of the fractional filter for real-time
estimation of the contact rate. Reliable contact rate estimates at the current frontier of the
data would allow to real-time monitor the state of the pandemic and can serve as a surveillance
measure for future outbreaks. Based on reliable real-time estimates for the contact rate, policy
rules can be implemented to prevent an exponential growth of case numbers. Acting early reduces
economic and social costs of containment measures, and consequently a well-designed policy rule
will be beneficial, given that the fractional filter yields a reliable estimate for the current level of
the contact rate. Drawing inference on the latter is the focus of this subsection.
In detail, real-time monitoring is simulated by truncating the sample at a certain point t,
r ≤ t ≤ n, where r is the minimum sample size for the CSS estimator to produce reasonable
estimates. The parameters θ0 , µ0 , α1,0 , ..., α7,0 of (8) are then estimated as described in section 3
using the information available at time t, Ft , and the resulting parameter estimates are denoted

21

as θ̂(t) , µ̂(t) , etc. To take into account reporting lags, and to be robust against outliers at the
end of the sample, a little backward-smoothing is allowed by reporting the smoothed estimate
for the log contact rate at period t − 3 given the information available at period t. From (13),
the smoothed estimates are
log β̂t−3|t = µ̂(t) + xt−3|t (θ̂(t) ).

(18)

As (18) only depends on information available at t, it mimics the situation of a policy maker at t
and can be used to draw inference on the monitoring properties of the fractional filter at time t.
Based on β̂t−3|t , policy rules to prevent an exponential spread of the virus can be designed. Such
rules could, for instance, define a threshold for R̂t−3 at which additional containment measures
are implemented. As the threshold should naturally depend on the number of currently infected,
current hospital capacities, and other parameters, the precise design of such a policy rule is left
to the experts, and only a primitive policy rule will be introduced later for illustrative purposes.
The reliability of real-time estimates for the contact rate is assessed by the following experiment: First, an estimation sample that consists of information available until May 31 is defined,
for which θ0 , µ0 , α1,0 , ..., α7,0 are estimated. It consists of at least 80 observations, which is considered as a reasonable sample size for the estimation sample. Based on these estimates, log β̂r−3|r
is obtained as described above. In a second step, information available on June 1 is added to the
sample and parameter estimates are updated using the θ̂(r) from the estimation sample as starting
values for the CSS estimator, which gives θ̂(r+1) . As before, the estimate for log β̂r−2|r+1 is stored.
The procedure repeats for all t, r < t ≤ n, where in every step t the CSS estimator is initialized
by θ̂(t−1) . The resulting real-time estimates for the contact rate are then compared to those of
subsections 4.1 and 4.2 to draw inference on their reliability. In addition, a primitive policy rule
is introduced. It assumes governments to take action as soon as R̂t−3 = β̂t−3|t /γ̂ > 1.2. The
latter is motivated by the observation that preventing an exponential propagation (i.e. Rt−3 > 1)
is desirable, and a margin of 0.2 is included to be robust against outliers. Finally, the real-time
contact rate estimates are compared to a rolling seven-day average

which includes three forward-looking observations and should smooth out the seasonality.
The real-time experiment considered in this paper deviates from Lee et al. (2021), who suggest
to monitor the current state of the pandemic by fitting a linear time trend with structural breaks
to log Ỹt . Lee et al. (2021) evaluate the monitoring properties of their contact rate estimate
ex-post, using all information available in their sample. Consequently, their estimates at point t
depend on information that was not available to policy makers at period t whenever t < n. As
structural breaks are not well identified at the end of the sample, recent changes in the contact
rate cannot be expected to be found by the estimator of Lee et al. (2021).

The results of the real-time experiment are visualized in figure 6. The four panels on the
left side sketch the resulting real-time estimates for the contact rate for the four countries under
study, together with the (full sample) results of subsections 4.1 and 4.2. As can be seen, the
real-time estimates almost perfectly overlap with estimates using the full sample information.
This implies that the real-time estimates are well suited for monitoring the current state of the
contact rate. Minor deviations are visible for Canada at the end of July, and for Germany at
the middle of June, while no greater deviations are visible for Italy and the US. The real-time
estimates exceed the threshold R̂t−3 = β̂t−3|t /γ̂ > 1.2 on the same day as estimates based on the
full sample for Italy (August 13) and for the US (May 31), where May 31 is the first observation
for the real-time estimates. For Canada, the reproduction rate based on the full sample exceeds
the threshold on July 21, one day after the real-time estimate. For Germany, the real-time
estimates exceed the threshold for the reproduction rate on June 19, two days before those based
on the full sample. These findings again substantiate the usefulness of the fractional filter as a
surveillance measure to monitor the current state of the pandemic. From the results in figure 6, it
follows that the primitive policy rule would have required governments to take action during the
summer where case numbers were comparably low across the four countries under study. Such
an early intervention would have likely reduced the economic and social costs compared to the
lockdown measures as implemented at the end of year 2020.
benchmark
The four panels on the right side of figure 6 display the deviations of log β̂t−3|t and log β̂t−3|t

from the log contact rate estimates based on the full sample information log β̂t−3|n . Thus, they
shed light on whether the fractional filter improves estimates for the contact rate compared to a
rolling seven-day average that uses three forward-looking observations. For Italy and the US, the
advantages of the fractional filter directly become apparent, as the benchmark exhibits greater
deviations. For Canada and Germany, the fractional filter performs comparably well when large
outliers occur, e.g. around July 20 for Canada and around June 20 for Germany.

Conclusion

To extract a time-varying signal for the COVID-19 contact rate from daily data on confirmed,
recovered, and deceased cases, this paper introduces a novel unobserved components model. It
models the log contact rate as a fractionally integrated process of unknown integration order.
A computationally simple modification of the Kalman filter is introduced and is termed the
fractional filter. It provides a closed-form expression for the prediction error that allows to
estimate the model parameters by a conditional-sum-of-squares (CSS) estimator. The asymptotic
theory for the CSS estimator is provided. For the countries under study, estimation results are
well in line with the chronology of the pandemic. They allow to draw inference on the impact
of policy measures such as contact restrictions. The new filtering method bears great potential
as a monitoring device for the current state of the pandemic, as it yields reliable contact rate
estimates at the current frontier of the data.

24

As vaccines become more and more available, future research can generalize the model to
include the number of vaccinated. For instance, this can be done by decomposing 1 = St + It +
Rt +Dt +Vt , where Vt is the fraction of vaccinated. The states Rt and Vt should be non-overlapping
as long as vaccines are not rolled out to recovered subjects. While vaccine recommendations vary
over the different countries, some assign a lower priority to recovered subjects, so that Rt and
Vt are non-overlapping at the early stage of the vaccine roll-out. Furthermore, mutations of the
Coronavirus can be taken into account e.g. by allowing for a smooth transition between a contact
rate with a low probability of virus transmission and one with a high probability.
For applications beyond COVID-19 related data, the fractional filter offers a robust, flexible,
and data-driven way for signal extraction of data of unknown persistence. It requires no prior
assumptions on the integration order of a process, and thus provides a solution to model specification in the unobserved components literature. Due to its computational advantages compared
to the classic Kalman filter, it allows to estimate unobserved components models with richer
dynamics.

In addition to the CSS estimates, estimation results for d0 from the exact local Whittle

j ∈ {0.45, 0.50, 0.55, 0.60, 0.65, 0.70}. Finally, the mean squared error M SEx and the coefficient

The results for the Monte Carlo study are contained in table B.1. Not surprisingly, the
parametric CSS estimator outperforms the exact local Whittle estimator. However, gains are
quite large in terms of the MSE for the integration order for all n ∈ {100, 200, 300} and all
combinations of ρ and d0 . The mean squared error of the integration order estimate becomes

increases with d0 . For the same reason, it decreases with increasing ρ. The same conclusions on
the precision with which d0 is estimated hold for the mean squared error of xt , which decreases
as n, d, and ρ increase. The proportion of explained variation of xt , measured by Rx2 , is high and
thus xt is estimated well via (13). Particularly for d = 1.25, which is the relevant case for the
applications in section 4, the Rx2 is close to unity for all n.

Proofs

Proof of Lemma 3.1. First, note that Eθ (xt+1 |Ft ) = Eθ (yt+1 |Ft ), so that it is sufficient to derive
the latter expression. For this, consider the reduced form of (9), which follows from taking
fractional differences and utilizing the aggregation properties of MA processes, see Granger and
Morris (1976), so that

be derived by matching the autocovariance functions of (C.1), see Watson (1986, eqn. 2.6), and
depend non-linearly on θ. However, they are not required for the proof. Solving for εt yields

is crucial, as it guarantees i=0
πi (d)πi+1 (d) 6= 0, so that the matrix in (C.2) has full rank.
Next, the CSS estimator based on the reduced form (C.1) is derived and is shown to be
identical to (12). Multiplying (C.1) by φ(L, θ)−1 yields εt = φ(L, θ)−1 ∆d+ yt , based on which
a reduced form CSS estimator can be constructed. Define ψ+ (L, θ) = [φ(L, θ)−1 ]+ = [1 −

εt (θ), the reduced form CSS estimator is

R(θ) =

and equals the CSS estimator in (12). To see this, add and subtract yt from εt (θ) = ψ+ (L, θ)∆d+ yt ,
so that yt = (1 − ψ+ (L, θ)∆d+ )yt + εt (θ), and plug yt into the conditional expectation in (10)
h
i
vt (θ) = yt − Eθ (yt |Ft−1 ) = yt − Eθ (1 − ψ+ (L, θ)∆d+ )yt |Ft−1 = ψ+ (L, θ)∆d+ yt = εt (θ).
The third equality follows from (1 − ψ+ (L, θ)∆d+ )yt being Ft−1 -measurable, since ψ(L, θ) =
P
i
1− ∞
i=1 ψi (θ)L and π0 (d) = 1. Thus, the contemporaneous yt cancel in the expectation operator
and the whole term can be taken out of the expectation operator. From vt (θ) = εt (θ) it follows
that the optimization problems in (12) and (C.3) are identical.
Next, the integration order of the residuals is assessed. Since yt ∼ I(d0 ), the residuals satisfy
d−d0
εt (θ) = ψ+ (L, θ)∆d+ yt = ψ+ (L, θ)∆+
ηt + ψ+ (L, θ)∆d+ ut ∼ I(d0 − d).

(C.4)

For d0 −d < 1/2 the residuals are stationary, while for d0 −d > 1/2 they are nonstationary. As the

29

asymptotic behavior of the objective function changes around d0 −d = 1/2, the objective function
does not uniformly converge on the set of admissible values for d. The same problem is addressed
by Hualde and Robinson (2011) and by Nielsen (2015) for ARFIMA models encompassing (C.1).
Nielsen (2015, eqn. 8) shows that a weak law of large numbers (WLLN) applies to the sum of
squared residuals whenever d0 −d < 1/2, while the sum of squared residuals diverges in probability
whenever d0 − d ≥ 1/2, which translates into

(C.5)

ε̃t (θ) = ψ(L, θ)φ(L, θ0 )∆d−d0 εt is the untruncated residual generated by the untruncated ∆d and
ψ(L, θ). In addition, letting D∗ (κ) = D ∩ {d : d0 − d ≤ 1/2 − κ}, 0 < κ < 1/2 denote the
region of the parameter space where εt (θ) is stationary, Nielsen (2015, eqn. 13) shows that for
any constant K > 0 there exists a fixed κ̄ > 0 such that

implying that Pr(dˆ ∈ D∗ (κ̄) ∩ θ ∈ Θ) → 1 as n → ∞. From (C.6) it follows that the relevant
parameter space asymptotically reduces to the stationary region Θ∗ (κ̄) = {θ|θ ∈ Θ, d ∈ D∗ (κ̄)}.
Since the model is identified, for consistency it remains to be shown that a uniform weak
law of large numbers (UWLLN) holds for the objective function within the stationary region
of the parameter space. A UWLLN holds if both, the objective function and the supremum of
the gradient, satisfy a WLLN, see Wooldridge (1994, thm. 4.2 and eqn. 4.4) and Newey (1991,
cor. 2.2). While a WLLN for the objective function follows directly from (C.5), it remains to be
shown that

For the remaining term in (C.9), note that the sum of absolute coefficients of the truncated

ψ(L, θ) = φ(L, θ)−1 . Thus, it is sufficient to prove absolute summability of the coefficients in
∂ψ(L, θ)/∂θ = −ψ(L, θ)2 (∂φ(L, θ)/∂θ). Absolute summability of the coefficients in ∂φ(L, θ)/∂θ
is shown in lemma D.1 in appendix D. Since ψ(L, θ) is stable, ∂ψ(L, θ)/∂θ satisfies the absolute

From (C.10) and (C.11) it follows that (C.7) holds. Consequently, the supremum of the gradient
satisfies a WLLN for θ ∈ Θ∗ (κ), which generalizes the pointwise convergence of the objective
function to weak convergence, implying that a UWLLN holds for the objective function. Since
the model is identified, consistency of the CSS estimator follows from the UWLLN together with
p

(C.6), and thus θ̂ −→ θ0 as n → ∞, see Wooldridge (1994, thm. 4.3).

To derive the asymptotic distribution theory for the CSS estimator, a central limit theorem
(CLT) is shown to hold for the score function at θ0 . Next, it is proven that a UWLLN holds for
the Hessian matrix by showing that the Hessian matrix and its first partial derivatives satisfy
a WLLN (Wooldridge; 1994, thm. 4.2). The UWLLN allows to evaluate the Hessian matrix in
√
(C.12) at θ0 and yields the asymptotic distribution of n(θ̂−θ0 ). As the reduced form coefficients
φ(L) depend non-trivially on θ, no analytical expression for the asymptotic variance of the CSS
estimator is provided. Instead, it will be shown that the CSS estimator is asymptotically normally
distributed, and its asymptotic variance is shown to exist. This allows to estimate Var(θ̂) e.g.
via the inverse of the numerical Hessian matrix.
Starting with the score function, similar to Nielsen (2015, p. 175) a CLT can be inferred from
the Cramér-Wold device by showing that for any 3-dimensional vector µ = (µ1 , µ2 , µ3 )0 , it holds
P

that µ0 Sn = 3j=1 µj Sn −→ N(0, µ0 Ω0 µ). To see this, define the σ-algebra F̃t = σ({εs , s ≤ t})
generated by the white noise εt and its lags. Next, note that in (C.14) the term εt [∂ ε̃t (θ)/∂θ

adapted to F̃t is a stationary MDS, since εt is white noise, the partial derivatives are F̃t−1 measurable, and the coefficients of the partial derivatives are absolutely summable, as shown in

To evaluate the Hessian matrix in (C.12) at θ0 , it remains to be shown that a UWLLN applies
to the Hessian matrix (Wooldridge; 1994, thm. 4.4), for which it is sufficient to show that a WLLN

and a WLLN holds for the Hessian matrix if the absolute summability condition for (C.8) is

θ ∈ Θ∗ (κ), the first term in (C.17) directly satisfies the condition for (C.8) and thus is bounded

summability condition for (C.8). As the coefficients in ψ(L, θ) are absolutely summable, the
third term in (C.18) is also bounded by (C.8), so that only the coefficients of the second partial
derivatives of ψ+ (L, θ) need to be shown to be absolutely summable. As their sum is bounded by
the sum of absolute coefficients of the untruncated polynomial ψ(L, θ) = φ(L, θ)−1 , it is sufficient
to prove absolute summability for the latter. For this, consider
∂φ(L, θ) ∂φ(L, θ)

Absolute summability of the coefficients of the partial derivatives of φ(L, θ) up to order three
is shown in lemma D.1 in appendix D. Consequently, (C.20) satisfies the absolute summability
condition for (C.8), so that (C.16) holds. Thus, a UWLLN holds for the Hessian matrix, so that
pointwise convergence generalizes to weak convergence. This, together with consistency of θ̂ (see
theorem 3.2) allows to evaluate the Hessian matrix in (C.12) at θ0 . Analogously to (C.13), it
follows from the argument of Robinson (2006, pp. 135-136) that the partial derivatives of εt (θ)
in (C.17) can be replaced by those of ε̃t (θ) as n → ∞, and εt (θ0 ) can be replaced by εt , which

w.r.t. d, while all coefficients of the other partial derivatives are bounded below. Consequently,
(D.9) to (D.11) are MA processes with absolutely summable coefficients. Note that this is not
sufficient for absolute summability of the partial derivatives of φ(L, θ), as σε in the numerators
of (D.9) to (D.11) also depends on θ.
For (D.2), consider ∂σε2 /∂θj = c1 (θ, θj ) − c2 (θ, θj ), where

From (D.9) it follows that the term on the left hand side (LHS) is a MA process with absolutely
summable coefficients for any t. Since the same holds for φ(L, θ)ε∗t , by (D.12) the first term on the
right hand side (RHS) is also a MA process with absolutely summable coefficients. Consequently,

and z1 (θ, θj , θk ) is a MA process with absolutely summable coefficients due to (D.2). Plugging
in ∂ 2 σε2 /(∂θj ∂θk ) = c3 (θ, θj , θk ) − c4 (θ, θj , θk ) and rearranging terms yields

where the LHS is a MA process with absolutely summable coefficients for any t due to (D.10) and
(D.14). Again, as the contemporaneous ε∗t cannot cancel out, c4 (θ, θj , θk ) = O(1) is bounded.
Therefore, c4 (θ, θj , θk )/(2σε )φ(L, θ)ε∗t is a MA process with absolutely summable weights, so
Pt−1 2
∂ φi (θ)/(∂θj ∂θk )ε∗t−i must also be a MA process with

absolutely summable weights for any t, which proves (D.3).
Turning to (D.4), the third partial derivatives of the variance parameter σε2 can be represented
as ∂ 3 σε2 /(∂θj ∂θk ∂θl ) = c5 (θ, θj , θk , θl ) − c6 (θ, θj , θk , θl ) with

as shown in (D.8). Consequently c5 (θ, θj , θk , θl ) = O(1), and the exact expression is omitted for

where z2 (θ, θj , θk , θl ) holds the products of the first and second partial derivatives of σε2 and φ(L, θ)
for which absolute summability was shown above. Therefore, z2 (θ, θj , θk , θl ) is a MA process with
absolutely summable coefficients. Plugging in ∂ 3 σε2 /(∂θj ∂θk ∂θl ) = c5 (θ, θj , θk , θl )−c6 (θ, θj , θk , θl )

where the LHS is a MA process with absolutely summable coefficients for any t by (D.11). As
for the first and second partial derivatives, c6 (θ, θj , θk , θl ) = O(1) holds, as the contemporaneous
ε∗t do not cancel on the RHS. Due to boundedness of c6 (θ, θj , θk , θl ), the term c6 (θ, θj , θk , θl ) =
