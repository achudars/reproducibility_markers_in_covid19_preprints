Abstract
A reasonable prediction of infectious diseases transmission process under different disease control strategies is
an important reference point for policy makers. Here we established a dynamic transmission model via Python
and realized comprehensive regulation of disease control measures. We classified government interventions into
three categories and introduced three parameters as descriptions for the key points in disease control, these being
intraregional growth rate, interregional communication rate, and detection rate of infectors. Our simulation
predicts the infection by COVID-19 in the UK would be out of control in 73 days without any interventions; at
the same time, herd immunity acquisition will begin from the epicentre. After we introduced government
interventions, single intervention is effective in disease control but at huge expense while combined
interventions would be more efficient, among which, enhancing detection number is crucial in control strategy
of COVID-19. In addition, we calculated requirements for the most effective vaccination strategy based on
infection number in real situation. Our model was programmed with iterative algorithms, and visualized via
cellular automata; it can be applied to similar epidemics in other regions if the basic parameters are inputted, and
is able to synthetically mimick the effect of multiple factors in infectious disease control.

Introduction
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious respiratory syndrome caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus
and characterised by high overall human-to-human transmission potential.1 The epidemic rapidly spread
regionally and subsequent follow on caused a global pandemic. 2 Yet until an effective vaccine or specific drug to
combat COVID-19 is developed, it is likely that the possibility of a resurgence in contagion will exist so that
disease control may become a normal part of everyday life. 3 The enormous infection scale and limited healthcare
system capacity makes it challenging to formulate a proper intervention strategy in the COVID-19 era. Moreover,
the complex properties of COVID-19 which include high human-to-human transmissibility (R0=2·2-6·47), a long
infectious period (infectiousness during the incubation period), the existence of asymptomatic infectors who have
a similar infection capacity (30%-60%), a high overall self-healing rate (80%), yet clinical severity in a minority
of individuals, have made the disease different from other antecedent epidemics and present difficulties for disease
control. 4–11
Modelling studies evaluating the effect and efficiency of disease control measures have provided good references
for policy makers.12–17 Previous modelling studies have successfully given insight into epidemic development
predictions such as quantitively predicting the epidemic extent and duration, and estimating mortality in different
countries; evaluating the effect and efficiency of particular COVID-19 control measures such as social distancing
and school closure; and forecasting transmission in special populations such as the elderly, obesity group and
diabetics.12–14,18,19 Most of these models follow the existing principle of susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) or
Monte Carlo simulation,20 here we established a novel infectious-hospitalized-selfheal (IHS) model with
application of iterative algorithm and with the platform of cellular automata. This new principle makes our model
more applicable to COVID-19 when considering its contagiosity in asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic infectors
which makes it different from many other epidemics. Our model is also flexible in applying to different global
regions since COVID-19 is unlikely to follow the identical path in every global region.21 In this article, we simulate
the development and recovery processes in the UK and we discuss what is the optimum plan for containing the
virus from spreading without too much disturbance to normal life, and also the optimal vaccination strategy based
on the current infection number, which will effectively bring the pandemic to an end.

In this article we summarised governmental interventions into three key strategies. First, the regional
transmission probability has been lowered by protective measures or vaccinations, which aim to reduce the
possibility of healthy people contracting the disease.22–24 Second, the mobility of the population has been
reduced by government-level measures like city lock-down, border sealing, and compulsory stay-at-home
policies.25 Last but not least, healthcare system capacity, especially in the areas of detection technologies and
intensive care, has been enhanced to make sure as many patients as possible are quarantined and treated, while
enhancement of detection capacity has aided early detection and immediate isolation. 26 We introduced
interregional communication rate (c) to describe the coefficient of disease transmission between communities to
take the impact of population mobility into consideration. Initial intraregional growth rate (m) was introduced to
describe internal infection among communities, which indicates the influence of personal protection measures
such as keeping a social distance and face covering. To be in line with reality, intraregional growth rate (m)
changes continuously as it is affected by patient recovery and thus assumed gain of immunity. Detection rate of
infectors (k) was introduced to describe the possibility of an infector (including asymptomatic and presymptomatic individuals) being detected, which is important for indicating the likely impact on healthcare
system capacity.

Then we introduce controlled parameters to describe the situation after interventions (details see method). To be
realistic, controlled interregional communication rate (c c) and detection rate of infectors (k) are steady state

Visualised transmission process of COVID-19 in the UK.
Our simulation of the infection starts with the initial daily infection number of each regions in the UK on 4th
March 2020.27 To simulate an ideal condition and due to the limitations of the iterative algorithm, the earliest
date we can start simulating interventions is one day after the first self-heal period. Therefore, in the first 16
days of the simulation, we use the initial parameters according to COVID-19 epidemiological characteristics,
the initial intraregional growth rate as 0.4, the interregional travel rate as 0.1, and the detection rate of infectors
as 0. Without any governmental intervention, the daily infection scale will exceed 14.8 million people on the
60th day of domestic infection (Figure 1B), which accounts for nearly a quarter of the UK population. The
accumulated infection number in 100 days may exceed 70% of the UK population (Figure 1A). Since the
simulation was interrupted when the cumulative infection number exceeds the local population, COVID-19
transmission in the UK suspends on the 73rd day. When we look at the regional infection curves, we can see that
the epidemic in London develops differently from other regions while the infection increases sharply during the
30th to 58th day, then decreases rapidly (Figure 1C). Indicating that, without interventions, the infection will first
be eliminated in London while the conditions are still getting worse in other regions.
From the visualized transmission maps we can also see that when the infection peak is reached, the COVID-19
outbreak will ameliorate in the epicentre while it is still developing in surrounding regions (Figure 2A). As
shown in the screenshots, the epidemic spreads from the epicentre to the periphery and surprisingly leaves the
centre epiclean (Figure 2A). Here we also simulated COVID-19 transmission process in London based on the
initial daily infection number of each borough on 11th March (Figure 2B) which shows similar results.27 Despite
a second wave of infection may happen from the epicentre of the outbreak once again, the periphery may be the
place hit by the epidemic more severely in a later period.

COVID-19 can be brought under control by a single intervention, but at huge expense.
We found that intensive single interventions are effective in flattening the daily infection curves. When the
controlled intraregional growth rate (mc) was in the range of 0.05-0.4 (0.75<R0<6), the daily infection curve
became progressively flatter with reduced mc while the period of the epidemic became longer. When the
controlled intraregional growth rate was lower than 0.1 (R0<1.5), this was effective in controlling the
propagation tendency, but a second infection wave was likely to occur. In addition, it was not possible to
completely eliminate infection cases within a 100-day period by only controlling mc, and the epidemic would
thus last for a longer time. When the controlled travel parameter (cc) was in the range of 0.0125-0.01, the overall
infection trends were downward but it was not possible to control the daily infection scale to an acceptable level
(Figure 3). An increasing detection rate of infectors (k) was capable of controlling the infection scales stably and
efficiently as well as eliminating the infection within a short period. The daily infection number dropped while k
was enhanced, and as shown in Figure 3, controlling k brings better disease control results than controlling m c
and cc. When k is as high as 0.175, it was possible to maintain the daily infection number curve at a flat level.

Combined interventions will significantly enhance disease control efficiency.
As shown in Figure 3, with achievable single interventions, it is hard to contain peak daily infection number to
acceptable levels. However, combined interventions significantly turned the peak daily infection number from 8
million down to 10 thousand. It is also worth noting that the time of disease control was sharply reduced. The
epidemic was now able to be cleared in the UK within 100 days.
The average length of hospital stay for COVID-19 patients is 7 days.28 The number of inpatient beds available
for COVID-19 patients before April in the UK was around 6,000-7,000.29 So the daily number of
hospitalizations should be kept within 1,000. As shown in mobility trend reports by Apple Maps, the general
4 / 17

mobility in the UK was reduced by around 20%-50% during the COVID-19 lockdown.30 Hence, we suppose the
interregional travel rate in the UK to be reduced from 0.1 to 0.08~0.05, indicating that 32%~16% people can
travel beyond 2.5 miles every day. The detection capacity in UK was 25,000 a day at early stage,31 and the
contact tracing policy led to 67% patients being accepted to hospital or self-isolating.32 As the ratio of positive
testees to total test number was estimated by WHO to be 3%-12% (we selected the median of 7.5%).33 The
optimum strategy should be based on the premise of not overwhelming hospital capacity and not excessively
affecting the social-economic system. (𝑁 ∙ 𝑘 ÷ 7.5% ÷ 67% ≤ 25000) As shown in Figure 4, we simulated the
transmission process and the daily number to hospital (H) under different conditions. We selected two
representative conditions: mc=0.17 (R0=2.5) and mc=0.3 (R0=4.5), with cc in the range of 0.08-0.05. We found
that when mc was initially set at 0.3 (R0=4.5), the detection rate of infectors should reach 0.145-0.16 (Figure
4B/4D). In this case the required detection number will be around 38,000-43,000 which obviously exceeds the
achievable number. Therefore, if the mc is initially set at 0.3, detection capacity needs to be improved. When m c
is set more strictly at 0.17, the detection rate does not need to be as high. The epidemic can thus be brought
under control when the detection number is higher than 5% of the daily infection number and the
communication rate is set below 0.8 (Figure 4A/4C).

Application on calculating vaccination demand to end COVID-19.
A key current strategy to combat COVID-19 is the development of an effective vaccine. We thereby provided a
method of calculating the required vaccination number based on this model. We started the simulation with
current infection number as an initial condition, and intraregional growth rate was influenced by vaccination and
existing natural immunization. For example, in September 2020, the daily infection cases in the UK were around
2000 with 200 being in London.34,35 Considering the average infection period of COVID-19 which is 12-15
days,38 we assume the real infection number in the UK and London is 22,000 and 2,200, accordingly. With the
premise of controlling the pandemic within two months, and controlling mc solely with vaccinations, we
simulated the disease control process with the initial infection number of 22,000 and 2,200 in the UK and
London and calculated the estimated daily detection number based on the highest daily infection number and the
proper detection rate, and the required number of vaccinations based on different mc values (Figure 5). Since the
current detection capacity in the UK has reached 200,000 tests each day,36 the required number of vaccinations
should be not less than 13.2 million in the UK and 720,000 in London (Table 1).

Discussion
As we have summarised, government intervention measures have focused on three main aspects: the spreading
coefficient, detection rate of infectors and travel parameter. Long-duration lockdown measurements effectively
reduced the burden of COVID-19 in the UK by strictly keeping the basic reproduction number (R 0) between 0.5
to 0.9.37 However, without cutting off the source of infection, the epidemic will not be eliminated in 100 days and
there is a risk of a second infection wave, even if the R0 number is very low (Figure 3A). With respect to the travel
parameter, during the COVID-19 lockdown and associated impact on travel, 46% of driving, 62% of public
transport and 33% walking trips were reduced on the days of lock-down compared to normal days before the
lockdown.38 However, the data shows the reduction started from 21st March, when the cases of infection had
already spread all over the country, therefore intra-regional growth was already occurring at this point. This also
matches our simulation results and shows that it is difficult to control the infectious trend by simply reducing the
travel parameter once the infection has spread to all regions. We next considered rate of detection and quarantine
for infectors. In our simulation, enhancing the detection rate of infectors (k) is shown to be the most crucial way
to bring the infection scale down as well as shorten the epidemic period. Without other interventions, around one
fifth of infectors must be detected and strictly isolated even if they are in the latent period of the disease or
asymptomatic.
Controlling all the single disease control parameters to ideal values in reality is difficult because of the special
characteristics of COVID-19, for example, detection and isolation of early-stage and asymptomatic infectors is a
big challenge for healthcare systems, and this was particularly the case with the unmatured detection technologies
and limited resources in the first phase of the COVID-19 outbreak. Therefore, our findings support the conclusion
that COVID-19 spread must be controlled by multiple combined measures with special attention on enhancing
detection rate. The initial R0 value was around 5.81 in the UK,8 to reduce the burden on the government and
balance economic development and disease control, and we believe that controlling R0 within the range of 2.54.5 is a reachable goal with proper control measures taken at the beginning of the period of interventions. To keep
the peak daily number of hospitalizations within 1,000, when R0 is immediately controlled at 2.5, with
intermediate travelling control policy, 5% of infectors must be detected and quarantined. Our recommendation is
that the minimum required daily test number at the early stage is around 17,600-18,000 given achievable rate of
5 / 17

contact tracing of infectors (67%).33 When R0 is controlled at 4.5, our recommendation is that the daily detection
number should be enhanced to at least 35,000.
Moreover, our simulation showed that the location at which the epidemic is most severe, was where the epidemic
first began to disappear. So we suggest that instead of gathering all detection systems and resources to the main
areas affected by the epidemic, distributing these resources to the peripheral regions will be a more efficient way
to save resources and bring the epidemic under control.
At the current stage, a key strategy to combat COVID-19 is the development of an effective anti-SARS-CoV-2
vaccine. We provided a potential method of calculating required vaccination number based on the actual infection
number, for example, our simulation shows that when the infection number is around 22,000 in the UK and 2,200
in London, the number of vaccinations in the UK should not be less than 13.2 million with 720,000 in London.

Conclusion
This study is a prognostic analysis of infectious disease development on the strength of an infectioushospitalized-selfheal (IHS) mathematic model with COVID-19 in the UK as an example. The model is designed
to better match the epidemiology characteristics of infectious diseases such as COVID-19 in particular its
asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic infectivity.
Through Python designing, we realized the comprehensive regulation of intraregional growth rate, interregional
communication coefficient, and detection rate. It is easy to evaluate the disease control effect by adjusting
various parameters and thus we can seek optimal solutions. Combined interventions are proven necessary,
among which enhancing detection rate is the most critical. In addition, we have found that to achieve better
control effects in the mid-term of the epidemic, more attention should be paid to the surrounding areas of the
epicentre. Moreover, our model can also be applied to estimate the quantity of vaccination demand based on
realistic situations to provide guidance for vaccination production.
This model can also be applied in the future to predict the spread of other similar infectious diseases in different
regions. It only needs to input specific disease parameters in the system, such as incubation period, self-healing
period, self-healing rate and so on. This model makes it convenient to quickly find the optimal solutions of
comprehensive interventions and take action, which can be helpful in future public health decisions making to
reduce morbidity and mortality.

The population is approximated to be constant and evenly distributed.
Death rate is counted as a part of the percentage of cases that are admitted to hospital.
Infected people are contagious constantly from the beginning to the end of the incubation period as well
as during the illness stage.
All the population are in the same physical condition.
All patients have contracted the virus through secondary infection; considering the high population
mobility, primary infected patients, which represent a tiny percentage, are omitted.

Automata cell establishment
Cellular automata is a dynamic system that is discrete in time and space; it consists of a regular grid of cells,
with each one being in a finite number of states. In our model, the disease transmission was described by partial
cellular interaction leading to global change. A geographical region was regarded as a two-dimension network.
To input this into cellular automata, each network was deemed as a cell while each cell stands for the location of
a group of people. Pixels were downscaled to correspond to the area of the cells. Each cell was selected and
separated according to the red, green, blue (RGB) value of the map. Red colour chromatic value in the pixels
represents the severity of the epidemic in the corresponding regions. The minimum value (r=0) means no cases
while the maximum value (re=225) represents the population of the cell.
The epidemic information and regional population of each cell was set initially according to the regional statistic
data, and the number of people who migrate each day depends on the interregional communication coefficient
and the local population.
6 / 17

A method of convolution kernel was applied for calculation of migrating cases. We suppose that infection starts
from one cell in each region, which was represented as a red dot on the map. The location of the dot was
randomly chosen, and pseudo-random number seeds were fixed. The epidemic is assumed not to transmit to
non-populated areas outside the coast where the infection number was forcibly set as zero.
Dynamical equations
Infectors go to the hospital and become self-healed only after appearance of symptoms, and thus the precise
number that go to hospital and self-heal depends on the infection number some period previously. The day’s
number to hospital in the cell is dependent on the daily infection number that occurred six days (the average latent
period) previously in local and surrounding regions. Considering some infectors will continually migrate between
regions, these infectors who are infected 6 days previously and are currently in cell 5 can be divided into two
parts: infectors who were infected in cell 5 and remained in cell 5 (local infectors who never migrate), and infectors
who were infected in other cells and moved into the cell 5 in the previous 6 days. Assuming the number of infectors
in cell 5 at the beginning is Y5.

Therefore, replacing Y with the exact number of infectors, the daily number to hospital of local infectors in cell

𝑁5 (𝑡 − 𝑡ℎ ) ∙ 𝑚5 (𝑡 − 𝑡ℎ ) ∙ ℎ ∙ (1 − 4𝑐)𝑡ℎ
Next, we consider the number of infectors who move into cell 5. Suppose the number of people in group Y in
adjacent cells of Y5 are Y2, Y4, Y6, Y8, and add up to Y2,4,6,8. Since each cell has only one side in contact with cell
5, on the first day the number of people in group Y who move into cell 5 is 𝑌2,4,6,8 ∙ 𝑐. Meanwhile people also
move out from cell 5, so on the second day the number of people in group Y who move into cell 5 is 𝑌2,4,6,8 ∙ 𝑐 ∙
(1 − 4𝑐). The rest can be calculated in the same manner.

Hence, the total number of people in group Y who moved into cell 5 on day t is

Data sources
We used an initial spreading coefficient to explain the daily percentage increase, in the UK the initial R0 value
was 5·81,4–8 the infection period (including incubation period) was 15 days, and the incidence number doubled
every 1·8 to 2·8 days (Table 2).39 So the value of the initial growth rate can be calculated as 0.4 (𝑚 =
𝑅0 ⁄15 𝑑𝑎𝑦𝑠 ).
We set 16183 pixels, for the areas of the UK. Therefore on a map of the UK, each pixel represents a 15 km 2
geographic area, and people who travel over a 4km (2.5 mile) straight-line distance are considered as migrants,.
The percentage of people migrating between cells in the UK is around 40% as roughly estimated based on
available worldwide and domestic travel and transport statistics (Table 2).40–42 Since there are four directions in
which people in one square cell can migrate, the number will be divided by 4, and the travel parameter was
estimated to be 0.1, standing for 10% people in one cell migrating between certain two adjacent cells every day
(Table 2).
The general percentage of hospitalization means the possibility of infectors being accepted to the hospital and
thus strictly isolated. We consulted the cumulative death rate which is estimated at 15.4%, and the number of
beds occupied by confirmed COVID-19 patients according to the NHS statistics in July, which showed that
2,000 beds were occupied by COVID-19 patients.27,43,44 Moreover, in early April the number of hospitalizations
was estimated at around 7,000-8,000.43 Considering there to be 200% undetected cases, as the number of
undetected patients is estimated to be more than two times that of the confirmed patients, the percentage to
hospital including death rate is 20% (Table 2).27,45
Since the illness period is estimated at 15 days, the controlled spreading coefficient can be calculated as 𝑚 =
𝑅0 ⁄15 𝑑𝑎𝑦𝑠 , which means the average number of people who can contract COVID-19 from one patient in one
day during his/her illness period.46
The detection rate of infectors stands for the possibility of an infector of being detected as well as isolated. For
instance, if the healthcare system provides no detection service, the detection rate of infectors is equal to 0. If
the healthcare system provides enough detection for all patients with severe symptoms and immediately isolates
them, the detection rate of infectors is equal to the rate of occurrence of severe symptoms (13.8%). If the
healthcare system provides general, extensive and compulsive detection services for all citizens, the detection
rate of infectors will be close to 1.

interventions were taken. B) Daily infection curves for the UK with interregional communication rates varying from 0.1 to
0.0125. C) Daily infection curves for the UK with detection rates of infectors varying from 0 to 0.2.

Figure 4. Daily infection curve and daily hospitalization curve with proper combined interventions with m c in the
range of 0.3-0.17 (initial R0 in the range of 4.5-2.5), and cc in the range 0.05-0.08 (20%-32% people in the UK can
travel over 2.5 miles a day).
(A) Daily infection curves when mc was initially controlled at 0.17 (R0=2.5). The maximum detection number will not
exceed 25000 when cc=0.08, k=0.055 or cc=0.07 k=0.05. (B) Daily infection curves when mc was initially controlled at 0.3
(R0=4.5). (C) When mc=0.17, cc=0.08-0.06, the number to hospital can be controlled within 1000 when k is controlled at
0.055-0.045. (D) When mc=0.3, cc=0.08-0.05, the number to hospital can be controlled within 1000 when k is controlled at
0.16-0.145.
