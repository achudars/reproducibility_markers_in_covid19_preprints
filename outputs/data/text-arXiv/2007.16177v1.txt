Abstract: In this study, we investigated the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein with HIV drugs
and their combinations. This glycoprotein is essential for the reproduction of the SARS-COV-2 virus, so its
inhibition opens new avenues for the treatment of patients with COVID-19 disease. In doing so, we used the
VINI in silico model of cancer, whose high accuracy in finding effective drugs and their combinations was
confirmed in vitro by comparison with existing results from NCI-60 bases, and in vivo by comparison with
existing clinical trial results. In the first step, the VINI model calculated the inhibition efficiency of SARSCoV-2 spike glycoprotein with 44 FDA-approved antiviral drugs. Of these drugs, HIV drugs have been
shown to be effective, while others mainly have shown weak or no efficiency. Subsequently, the VINI model
calculated the inhibition efficiency of all possible double and triple HIV drug combinations, and among them
identified ten with the highest inhibition efficiency. These ten combinations were analyzed by Medscape
drug-drug interaction software and LexiComp Drug Interactions. All combinations except the combination
of cobicistat_abacavir_rilpivirine appear to have serious interactions (risk rating category D) when dosage
adjustments/reductions are required for possible toxicity. Finally, the VINI model compared the inhibition
efficiency of cobicistat_abacivir_rilpivirine combination with cocktails and individual drugs already used or
planned to be tested against SARS-CoV-2. Combination cobicistat_abacivir_rilpivirine demonstrated the
highest inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein over others. Thus, this combination seems to be a
promising candidate for the further in vitro testing and clinical trials.

1. INTRODUCTION
It is still unclear where the SARS-CoV-2 virus came
from, and we have no scientific confirmation that the virus has
passed from an animal species to a human one. However, we
do have confirmation of the transmission of SARS-CoV-2
virus from humans to dogs and cats. Specifically, WHO
(World Health Organization) data describes two dogs in Hong
Kong and one cat in Belgium, which were virus-contaminated
from humans, but this was not COVID-19 infection in these
animals. Shortly after the first confirmed cases of infection
with SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus [1], COVID-19 spread rapidly
to almost all continents of the world, with the disease
becoming a pandemic in a very short time [2]. The number of
patients confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 is
increasing rapidly, and at the time of submission of this work,
according to WHO [3], it was more than 2,500,000 cases. The
end of this pandemic cannot yet be foreseen, and to make
matters even worse, the estimated mortality caused by this
virus is from about 1% to as high as 12% in the epicentre of
the epidemic [4].
A host of high frequency mutations have resulted in at least
five differentiated SARS-CoV-2 strains to date [5], therefore
finding an effective vaccine against this virus is not to be
expected soon. Consequently, efforts by the world scientific
community and the pharma industry need to be focused on
finding effective therapies as quickly as possible, in order to
reduce the number of deaths. Finding new antiviral drugs is
generally a costly and time-consuming process, and often
limited with our understanding of biology [6]. Therefore, it is
justified to consider the use of existing drugs to cure new
diseases [7], as these drugs already have well-established
recommended doses and regimens, known side effects, and
ways of preventing or mitigating such effects. Equally
important, the optimal methods of synthesizing existing drugs
are known, so in the case of increased demand for a certain
drug, it is easier, faster, and cheaper to expand existing
production capacities than to design and build new ones [8].
Repurposing existing drugs to treat diseases can provide
additional important benefits, and this is the possibility to
administer multiple drugs at the same time. For example, by
using combinations of drugs whose efficacy against the
specific mechanism of pathogen is greater than the efficacy of
the individual drugs, it is possible to achieve greater
therapeutic efficacy. Another approach is to use the
combination of several drugs with each drug acting on the
different mechanism of pathogen [9]. In addition, the
combined use of multiple drugs may reduce the potential for
the pathogen to develop resistance [10]. This approach is now
standard in the treatment of many serious diseases, including
the treatment of cancer [11], bacterial infections [12], and
infections with HIV [13].
The first attempts at treating COVID-19 disease with existing
drugs have already been made. Thus, Kaletra

(lopinavir/ritonavir combination) alone or in combinations
with α-interferon,
reverse transcriptase
inhibitors
(emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide fumarate), oseltamivir,
and guanosine analog and reverse transcriptase inhibitor
ribavirin, is being tested on SARS-CoV-2 patients. Trials with
ritonavir plus ASC09, umifenovir, and remdesivir are also
planned [14]. Antiviral drug favipiravir, chloroquine, and
nucleotide analog remdesivir are under investigation [15].
Given the research to date and clinical findings, we decided to
systematically investigate the possibility of administering preexisting antiviral medicines and their combinations in the
treatment of COVID-19. As a tool for our investigation, we
chose the VINI in silico model of cancer [16]. The VINI
model performs virtual drug screening [17] on KEGG
diseases metabolic pathways [18]. The high accuracy of the
VINI model in calculating the efficacy of cancer drugs and
their combinations has already been confirmed by comparison
with in vitro NCI-60 data and clinical trials [16] [19].
Furthermore, its modular architecture enables its easy
extensibility and virtual drug screening of nearly all diseases
described by KEGG metabolic pathways. However, since
there is no metabolic pathway for COVID-19 disease until
now established, we have taken the advantage of the VINI
model's ability to perform virtual drug screening also on only
one specific protein.
Like other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 has four structural
proteins, Figure 1, known as the S (spike), E (envelope), M
(membrane), and N (nucleocapsid) proteins; the N protein
holds the RNA genome, and the S, E, and M proteins together
create the viral envelope [20].
Although all four of these structural proteins are potential drug
targets, we restricted our investigation to spike protein, which
is essentially a glycoprotein that allows the binding of SARSCoV-2 to ACE2 (an angiotensin converting enzyme 2) and the
transfer of viral RNA material to the host cell [21]. The threedimensional structures of spike glycoprotein were deposited
by the same author's team at www.rcsb.org [22] on
11/03/2013. In our study, we used one of these structures,
designated 6VXX [23], as a target for virtual drug screening.

2. METHODS AND RESULTS
The task of virtual drug screening is to find drugs or
chemical compounds (ligands) with high free energy of
binding (in further text abbreviated ΔG) with target molecules
(receptors), thus inhibiting them. The VINI model uses
Autodock Vina software [24] to calculate ΔG [25] between
receptors and ligands. By definition, ΔG has always negative
values expressed in kcal/mol units, or zero value in case there
is no binding between receptor and ligand. The lower these
negative values, the greater the inhibition of the receptor by
ligand is. For example, the binding energy of the compound
A with ΔG = -15 kcal/mol is considered to have higher
inhibition than the compound B with the binding energy ΔG
= -10 kcal/mol. Although receptors can be any type of
chemical compounds, most common receptors in biological
processes are proteins. Unlike receptors, drug candidates are
mostly small molecules composed of several to several dozen
atoms.
The quest for a vaccine against the novel SARS-CoV-2 is
recognized as an urgent problem [26], however the
development of an effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is not
expected soon. For this, at this stage of the rapidly growing
COVID-19 pandemic one of the most important tasks is to
find effective drugs against SARS-CoV-2 as soon as possible.
Various approaches were suggested, for example to use
available angiotensin receptor 1 (AT1R) blockers, such as
losartan, and block angiotensin-converting enzymes (ACE2)
on human cells, thus preventing SARS-CoV-2 from attaching
to ACE2 with its spike glycoprotein [27].
Our approach is opposite: to block SARS-CoV-2 spike
glycoprotein directly with the combination of available
antiviral drugs expressing highest inhibition to it, thus
preventing the virus from attaching to the human cell.
Therefore, we decided to perform a virtual screening of the

On KEGG portal we identified 52 FDA-approved antiviral
drugs, 44 of them small molecules with an experimentally
determined three-dimensional (3D) structure, 7 interferon
drugs with FASTA sequence, and sinecatechin, a specific
water extract of green tea leaves from Camellia sinensis.
Furthermore, regardless of the fact that virtual drug screening
with reduced accuracy is possible to perform on proteins
without structure by predicting their 3D structures from
FASTA sequences [28], we omitted interferon drugs from this
study due to the extremely high demand of molecular dynamic
tools [29] needed to perform in silico protein-protein docking
and calculation of their binding free energies [30].
Of these small-molecule anti-viral drugs, we found 22 drugs
indicated for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), 6 for
influenza and herpes simple virus (HSV), 4 drugs for hepatitis
B virus and cytomegalovirus, and 2 for respiratory syncytial
virus (RSV). Additionally, we excluded from the further
analysis antiviral drugs whose binding energy to SARS-CoV2 is weak. The VINI model first calculated ΔG of 44 smallmolecule anti-viral drugs with SARS-CoV-2 spike
glycoprotein. As for all other calculations of ΔG in this study,
the VINI model used Autodock Vina software, performed
docking and binding free energy calculation between SARSCoV-2 spike glycoprotein structure file with RCSB pdb id
6VXX and each small-molecule drug 10 times, and then
computed average of ΔG expressed in kcal/mol units. For the
purposes of this and all subsequent simulations, the VINI
model pulled a 6VXX structure file from the RCSB portal. For
antiviral drugs, the VINI model used 3D structures from the
Drugbank [31]. The results of these calculations are presented
in Figure 2 (see the details of experimental results in Table I
in the section Supplementary Material).
A higher negative value indicates a higher energy of binding.
Values below 7.0 kcal/mol represent weak binding energies.
The highest ΔG values were shown by two HIV drugs
atazanavir and saquinavir, and the weakest by foscarnet, a
cytomegalovirus drug. Abbreviations used: CMV
(cytomegalovirus), IFV (influenza virus), HSV (herpes
simplex virus), HIV (human Immunodeficiency virus), HBV
(hepatitis B virus), and RSV (respiratory syncytial virus).
In the case of multi-drug cocktail therapy, the final binding
energy depends on the order of drug binding to the protein.
For example, the binding energy ΔG of protein P first with
drug A and then drug B differs from the binding energy of
protein P with drug B and then with drug A. Symbolically,
this can be written as:
𝛥𝐺(𝑃, 𝐴, 𝐵) ≠ 𝛥𝐺(𝑃, 𝐵, 𝐴)

(1)

Figure 2 Presented are calculated -ΔG values between the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and
the small-molecule antiviral drugs, expressed in kcal/mol units.
Furthermore, in the present study, and due to the possible
adverse drug interactions, we limited our search for cocktail
therapies with up to three individual drugs. The total number
of single, double and triple combinations with N drugs equals
can be expressed as:
𝑀 = 𝑁 + 𝑁2 + 𝑁3

(2)

From (2) and because Autodock Vina simulation between
SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and each drug was
performed 10 times, it follows that for all single, double and
triple combinations with N = 44 drugs the total number of
required simulations will be 10*M, which equals 871,640. We
estimated that such a calculation on the computing
infrastructure available for this study may take more than two
weeks. However, such a long calculation time is unacceptable
given the situation caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which
requires the rapid development of new drugs.

Because of this, the fact that HIV drugs and their
combinations are most frequently represented in previous
attempts to treat COVID-19 disease, and of the results given
in Figure 2 showing that most HIV drugs have a binding
energy to the SARS-CoV-2 glycoprotein higher than other
antiviral drugs, we further limited the scope of virtual drug
screenings to HIV drugs only.
Consequently, the VINI model calculated binding free
energies for all double and triple combinations of HIV drugs,
and isolated ten combinations with the highest inhibition of
SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. The results of these
calculations are shown in Error! Reference source not
found. (see the details of experimental results in Table II in
the section Supplementary Material).
All calculated values refer to -ΔG between SARS-CoV-2
glycoprotein and drugs, and are given in kcal/mol units. Drugdrug interactions and possible side effects of single drugs were
examined using Medscape [32] and Lexicomp [33] drug
interaction checkers. Combinations failing into category D (it

is not recommended to administer these combinations without
reducing the dosage of the individual drugs) are indicated in
red.
Combination
cobicistat_abacavir_rilpivirine
is
highlighted green, as both Medscape and Lexicomp found no
serious interaction effects. That means, no dosage reduction
of the individual drugs is required (category C). The
efficiency (E) of a particular combination of drugs or a single
drug is defined as the absolute sum of the lowest (min) and
highest (max) total binding energy:
𝐸 = | min(𝛥𝐺 ) + max(𝛥𝐺)|

(3)

In the case of single drugs, the min and max binding energies
are the same, and therefore their efficiency is absolute value
of 2 * ΔG.
In order to compare the relative efficacy of
cobicistat_abacavir_rilpivirine cocktail in inhibiting SARSCoV-2 spike glycoprotein against cocktails and single drugs
already used to treat COVID-19 or under the investigation, the
VINI model calculated ΔG for the following combinations
and compounds: Kaletra alone, Kaletra in combinations with
oseltamivir,
remdesivir
and
ribavirin,
and
hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, favipiravir and umifenovir
alone. The results of this comparison are presented in Figure
4 (see the details of experimental results in Table III in the
section Supplementary Material).
Drug-drug interactions and possible side effects of single
drugs were examined using Medscape and Lexicomp
software. The cocktails and single drugs that fall into category
C are indicated in green. This category does not require a
reduction in the doses of the individual drugs in combination.
The combination of Kaletra with remdesivir and remdesivir
alone are highlighted in red because remdesivir is
investigational antiviral compound, is not yet licensed or
approved anywhere globally, and has not been demonstrated
to be safe or effective for any use.

The predicted efficiency, computed as in (3), of
cobicistat_abacavir_rilpivine combination is higher than the
efficacy of other cocktail therapies currently used as of our
best knowledge against SARS-CoV-2. The gain of
cobicistat_abacavir_rilpivine cocktail in inhibiting SARSCoV-2 spike glycoprotein over Kaletra is 13,62%, over
Kaletra with oseltamivir cocktail 7,25%, and over Kaletra
with ribavirin cocktail 6,98%. The gain over single drugs used
or planned to be used is much higher, and is 69,27% over
favipiravir, and 61,67% over umifenovir. The gain over
hydroxychloroquine is not relevant because this drug works
on a completely different basis, by suppressing the immune
system overreaction. Only the predicted efficacy of Kaletra
with
remdesivir
cocktail
is
higher
than
of
cobicistat_abacavir_rilpivirine combination, and equals
4,83%. However, remdesivir is not an approved drug, but a
compound still under investigation in recently approved
clinical trials.
From the results, one can also discern a slight fluctuation of
ΔG results for the same receptor-ligand pair in different
experiments. Thus, regardless of the fact that ΔG was
calculated ten times for each receptor-ligand pair, in the first
experiment ΔG for indinavir was -9.63 kcal / mol (Table 1),
and in the second experiment ΔG was -9.50 kcal / mol (Table
2). Such fluctuations are expected and are related to the
stochastic nature of Autodock Vina, which each time initiates
simulation of the same receptor-ligand pair from different,
randomly selected initial coordinates.
3. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
The SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein is a key factor in the
binding of the virus to angiotensin-converting enzyme
(ACE2), allowing the virus to transmit its RNA material to the
host cell, and hence its further reproduction. Effective
inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein can slow or
even completely inhibit the reproduction of the SARS-CoV-2
virus, thus increasing the chances of the host immune system

to fight against the virus. The results of our study provide
scientific confirmation of the high efficacy of some
combinations of approved HIV drugs, and compounds still
under investigation, in the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 spike
glycoprotein. Further application of these results may pave the
way for new, even more effective therapies than those
currently used in the treatment of COVID-19.
Among the ten most effective HIV drug combinations
predicted by the VINI model to be the most effective in
inhibiting
SARS-CoV-2
spike
glycoprotein,
the
cobicistat_abacavir_rilpivirine combination stands out.
Although ranked 8th regarding its efficiency, it is, due to its
relatively low toxicity and acceptable drug-drug interactions,
suitable for use at standard doses of individual drugs without
the need for their adjustment.
The predicted efficacy of this combination in the inhibition of
SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein is greater than the efficacy
of the drug combinations and the individual drugs, which, to
the best of our knowledge, have been tried, or are planned to
be tried in the treatment of COVID-19. These are Kaletra
(lopinavir_ritonavir combination), Kaletra in combination
with oseltamivir, Kaletra in combination with ribavirin, and
hydroxychloroquine, favipiravir and umifenovir as single
drugs.
The efficiency of the cobicistat_abakavir_rilpivirin
combination predicted by the VINI model is slightly lower
than the efficacy of the Kaletra_remdesivir combination.
However, remdesivir is a compound under investigation, and
its possible side effects and interactions with lopinavir and
ritonavir are still unknown.
From the results obtained, it can also be concluded that the
order of action of individual drugs in some combination on
the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein does matter. Thus, the
highest ΔG of cobicistat_abacavir_rilpivirin combination on
this glycoprotein is achieved when it first binds cobicistat,
then abacavir, and at the end rilpivirine. This indicates that a
3 times daily regimen in which cobicistat is given first, then
abacavir, and at the end rilpivirine, could further increase the
effectiveness of this combination therapy. A detailed
pharmacokinetic analysis of the effects of individual drugs
will be required to evaluate the benefits such a regimen may
possibly bring, and this goes beyond the scope of this study.
Therefore, a clinical trial of the combination of
cobicistat_abacavir_rilpivirin with a limited number of
COVID-19 patients who are in moderate severe and severe
condition is warranted.
