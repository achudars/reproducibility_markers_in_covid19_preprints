Abstract
To control the current outbreak of the Coronavirus Disease 2019, constant monitoring
of the epidemic is required since, as of today, no vaccines or antiviral drugs against it are
known. We provide daily updated estimates of the reproduction number over time at https://
stochastik-tu-ilmenau.github.io/COVID-19/. In this document, we describe the estimator
we are using which was developed in (Fraser; 2007), derive its asymptotic properties, and we
give details on its implementation. Furthermore, we validate the estimator on simulated data,
demonstrate that estimates on real data lead to plausible results, and perform a sensitivity
analysis. Finally, we discuss why the estimates obtained need to be interpreted with care.

Introduction

As the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) threatens humanity, unprecedented measures to
stop its spread have been adopted around the globe. In many countries, schools have closed and
curfews have been imposed. Given the enormous burden these measures place on the economy,
sooner or later they have to be relaxed. This raises important questions for policymakers and
public health specialists. How large is the effect of these measures? Do they effectively stop the
spread of COVID-19? What will happen if restrictions get relaxed? And in the future, how can
we see whether the epidemic is getting out of hands again?
To answer these questions, one needs to know how fast the epidemic is growing. In infectious
disease epidemiology, this is measured by the reproduction number, i.e. the mean number of
people someone who got infected will infect in the course of time. Its critical value clearly is 1:
for larger values the epidemic will grow, for smaller values it will diminish.
Since conditions may change in the future, e.g. when countermeasures are introduced or lifted,
the reproduction number may also change. We therefore follow Fraser (2007) and consider what
he calls the instantaneous reproduction number R(t) at time t, and for which he suggests the
estimator
I(t)
w(τ
)I(t − τ )
τ =1

(1)

R̂(t) = P∞

where I(t) is the number of incident cases at time t and w specifies the so-called infectivity
profile, i.e. the distribution of the generation time, which is assumed to be known. To the best
of our knowledge, this estimator has first been published by Fraser and others in (Grassly et al.;
2006). An overview of other estimators may be found in (Obadia et al.; 2012).
We explain the probabilistic model behind this estimator following (Cori et al.; 2013, Web Appendix 1) in Section 2. In addition, we analytically derive asymptotic confidence intervals (with
details given in Appendix A) which are simple to compute. Here, we differ from Grassly et al.
(2006) who use computationally more elaborate resampling techniques, namely the bootstrap,
to obtain confidence intervals; Cori et al. (2013) on the other hand take a Bayesian approach,
assuming a certain gamma prior distribution for R(t).
In Section 3, some epidemiologically relevant properties of COVID-19 are discussed, and the
infectivity profile is modelled. The estimator and corresponding confidence intervals are validated
on simulated data in Section 4. Then, we apply this methodology to real data for Germany in
Section 5, followed by a sensitivity analysis in Section 6. Finally, the results are summarised in
Section 7, also discussing difficulties with this approach.
In order to continuously monitor the spread of COVID-19, a designated website has been created where the results of our analysis are shown and updated daily. It is available at https://
stochastik-tu-ilmenau.github.io/COVID-19/ in English for all affected countries based on the
data from (Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering; 2020) as well as
in German for Germany and its federal states based on the data from (Robert Koch-Institut; 2020)
at https://stochastik-tu-ilmenau.github.io/COVID-19/germany. The source code for that
website as well as for this report may be found at https://github.com/Stochastik-TU-Ilmenau/
COVID-19/tree/gh-pages, rendering this fully reproducible research. We note that a similar analysis using the Bayesian approach of (Cori et al.; 2013) was presented by Abbott et al. (2020) with
updates at https://epiforecasts.io/covid/posts/global/.

Derivation of the estimator

The following is an adaptation of the modelling in (Fraser; 2007) and (Cori et al.; 2013, Web
Appendix 1).
Time is taken to be discrete, i.e. we consider days t ∈ Z, since the spread of the epidemic shows
a strong intraday variability (e.g., there are fewer infections during the night when people are at
sleep), and the time scales of incubation and infectious period are on the order of days. Also, cases
are reported on a daily basis.
The number of incidences, i.e. newly infected cases, at day t will be given as I(t). The infection
2

age of an infected person in days, i.e. the number of day elapsed since the infection, is denoted
by τ ∈ N0 .
The spread of the epidemic depends strongly on the time-dependent transmissibility β(t, τ ) ≥ 0
specifying the expected number of susceptible individuals an infectious person at infection age τ , a
so-called primary case, will infect at time t. The transmissibility is in particular affected by the
contact rate, i.e. the mean number of people an infected person meets per day, and the infectiousness of the primary case. The former is addressed by non-pharmaceutical interventions
such as school closures and curfews, the latter is a virological feature of the disease. Therefore we
make a crucial structural assumption, namely that they separate:
β(t, τ ) = R(t) w(τ ),

(2)

where R(t) ≥ 0 denotes the (instantaneous) reproduction number at time t of transmission,
i.e. when the secondary case gets infected by the primary case, and w(τ ) ∈ [0, 1] specifies the
infectivity profile at infection age τ . This models the belief that contact rates change over
time but the infectiousness of the primary case depends only on τ which is debatable, however:
when rules for isolation or quarantine change are loosened, e.g. because hospital capacities are
exhausted, β will change differently for different values of τ ; we will reiterate this point in Section 7.
It is also reflected in the fact that any constant factor may be alternatively incorporated into R
or w. The latter is therefore standardised such that
∞
X

w(τ ) = 1,

(3)

τ =0

i.e. w is a probability distribution which can be interpreted as follows: for a fixed time t
randomly pick a pair of individuals where the first one is a primary case that got infected at time
t, in turn infecting the second one later; w(τ ) is the probability that the second case got infected
at time t + τ , i.e. at infection age τ of the primary case. w thus specifies the distribution of the
generation time. It is assumed to be known; see Section 3 on how we model it for COVID-19.
In a stochastic model for the dynamics of the epidemic, I(t) is given as the number of successful
transmissions from an infectious person to someone who is susceptible to the disease. Assuming
that each possible transmission succeeds independently (thus ignoring the possibility of multiple
infections) with a probability corresponding to β, and if there are many possible transmissions,
I(t) is – by the law of small numbers – approximately Poisson distributed conditional on the
past. The intensity of this Poisson distribution is equal to
E(I(t) | I(t − 1), . . . ) =

∞
X

β(t, τ )I(t − τ ) = R(t)

τ =1

∞
X

w(τ )I(t − τ ) .

(4)

τ =1

Here, transmissions on the same day are ruled out, i.e. w(0) = 0, which is a realistic assumption
since the incubation period will be at least one day.
The last equation suggests the estimator R̂(t) for R(t) given in (Fraser; 2007, Equation (9)),
I(t)
.
w(τ
)I(t − τ )
τ =1

(5)

R̂(t) = P∞

Note that the case reproduction number Rc (t), i.e. the expected number of people a primary
case infected at time t will infect, is given by, cf. (Fraser; 2007, Equations (2) and (8)),
Rc (t) =

∞
X

β(t + τ, τ ) =

τ =1

∞
X

R(t + τ ) w(τ ) .

(6)

τ =1

This is of course difficult or even impossible to estimate as it depends on future contact rates, i.e.
on countermeasures that will be imposed. However, assuming that conditions remain the same in
the future, i.e. R(s) = R(t) for s > t, we obtain R(t) again, cf. (Fraser; 2007, Equation (3)),
∞
X
τ =1

R(t + τ )w(τ ) = R(t)

∞
X

w(τ ) = R(t) .

(7)

τ =1

This explains why R(t) is called reproduction number.

For large intensities, i.e. if the conditional expectation in Equation (4) is large, the distribution of
R̂(t) can be well approximated by a Gaussian distribution, with small standard errors. From this,
asymptotic confidence intervals can be derived, see Section A. If q denotes the (1− α2 )-quantile
of the standard normal distribution then

τ =1 w(τ )I(t − τ )
is an (asymptotic) (1 − α)-confidence interval for R(t). Note that in practice ten or more incident
cases should suffice for the asymptotics to be reliable.

Specifics of COVID-19

As COVID-19 is a new disease, first being described at the end of 2019, its virological features have
not yet been conclusively determined. Nonetheless, we tried to choose parameters in agreement
with the current state of research.
For comparisons, we note that in a population without any countermeasures, the basic reproduction number R0 is believed to be given by some value between 2.4 and 4.1 (Read et al.;
2020).
The incubation time, i.e. the time from infection until symptom onset, ranges from 1 to 14 days
with a mean of 5 to 6 days; the virus can be detected from 1 to 2 days before symptom onset for
up to 7 to 12 days in moderate cases, and even up to two weeks in severe cases (World Health
Organisation; 2020). We therefore may indeed assume that w(0) = 0.
For modelling the infectivity profile w, it is important to realise that it is not proportional to
the amount of viral specimens that can be detected in an infected person’s sputum, say. Indeed,
since severe cases are very likely to be hospitalised and thus strictly isolated, the probability of
infecting someone more than 12 days after infection is very low. Similarly, before symptom onset
the probability for transmission might be very low since no sputum is spread.
The infectivity profile is therefore set to start with 0 on the first day after infection with a linear
increase up to day 4, remaining constant up to day 6 and decaying linearly again until being 0 at
day 11; see Figure 1. In Section 6 we discuss the effect this choice has on the analysis.

4

Validation on simulated data

To validate the estimator, we simulate a stochastic SEIR (a.k.a. Kermack-McKendrick) model.
To be more precise, we consider a discrete-time Markov chain describing a population of n =
1 million people with each individual being in one of four states: susceptible, i.e. not yet infected;
exposed, more aptly called latent, i.e. infected but not yet infectious; infectious; or recovered
and thus immune. We start at time 0 with 100 latent individuals, all others initially being
susceptible. At each time step, a susceptible person becomes infected if the virus is transmitted
through contact with an infectious person; such contacts happen independently with probability
pE . A latent person becomes infectious with probability pI , and an infectious person recovers with
probability pR ; otherwise an individual remains in its state.
This results in incubation times, i.e. times spent in the latent state, which are geometrically
distributed with mean 1/pI ; for this to be 3, we set pI = 1/3. Similarly, the infectious period
is geometrically distributed with mean 1/pR which we would like to be 4, so we set pR = 1/4.
The corresponding infectivity profile w is then given by the convolution of these two geometric
convolutions. It can be calculated analytically, see Appendix B for details; the result is shown in
Figure 2. Note that w(1) = w(0) = 0 since it takes at least one day to become latent and another
one to become infectious in this model.
The basic reproduction rate is then given by R0 = npE /pR since an infected person on average
infects npE individuals per day (if all were susceptible) for 1/pR days on average. In order to
simulate an epidemic with R0 = 2.5, we set pE = R0 pR /n accordingly.
Over time, the reproduction number changes naturally because more people recover and become
immune: R(t) is R0 times the proportion of susceptible individuals at that time. In addition, we

assume that countermeasures have been imposed at time 30, resulting in R(t) being 0.7 times the
proportion of susceptibles afterwards, and that measures have been relaxed at time 50, resulting
in R(t) being 1.3 times the proportion of susceptibles thereafter.
Figure 3 shows one simulation run. The resulting estimates R̂(t) and pointwise 95%-confidence
intervals (α = 5% as usual) can be compared with the true reproduction rate R(t) in Figure 4.
The simulation has been repeated 105 times, and for each time point the proportion of confidence
intervals containing the true reproduction number has been determined, see Figure 5. They appear
not quite to have the desired nominal coverage but given that they are only asymptotic confidence
intervals, and modelling errors are typically much larger, we consider them acceptable in practice.
These simulations demonstrate how well the estimator is able to detect changes in the reproduction
number. From a practical viewpoint, this is an overly optimistic result. In fact, Equation (4) and
consequently the estimator R̂(t) in Equation (5) are based on the number of newly infected cases.
But infection dates are rarely known. Instead, cases are reported when they are tested with a
positive test result. In our simple simulation, one should therefore consider the newly infectious
cases at day t as input data I(t) for the estimator. Note that their increase lags behind the one
of the newly infected cases, i.e. the newly latent cases, by the incubation time, see Figure 3
where they lag behind by about 1 day, the mode of the incubation time distribution.
We use a naı̈ve approach to deal with this which we call infection-to-observation period: we
shift the estimator back by the observed lag, i.e. by 1 day. The result is shown in Figure 6
where the jump in R(t) leads only to a rapid change of R̂(t), approaching the true value R(t)
exponentially fast, though. For real data, the infection-to-observation period is even larger, since
symptomatic cases are usually not reported immediately. This will be taken into account in the
following section.

5

Application to real data

As an example, we consider data for Germany and its federal states (Bundesländer) provided
by the Robert Koch-Institut (2020), see Figure 7 for the total daily reported cases. Each case
in this dataset is labelled with a reporting date, i.e. the day when the local health authority
(Gesundheitsamt) has been notified about the case. Of course, this is not the day of symptom
onset, let alone the day of infection which is needed for the estimator in Equation (5). We therefore
set an infection-to-observation period by which we backdate the cases. It is pragmatically
chosen as 5 days of incubation time (cf. Section 3) plus 2 more days reporting delay for testing
etc., i.e. the infection-to-observation period is set to 7 days.
Since cases are reported to local health authorities, then collected at the level of states who in
turn report them to the federal Robert Koch-Institut, they appear in the dataset a few days later,
although with the date of reporting to the local health authority. Therefore, we exclude data from
yesterday and the two days before.
Based on the backdated data and the infectivity profile from Section 3 (see Figure 1), we estimated
the reproduction numbers for Germany over time, see Figure 8. Note that there are no estimates
for the last 7 days for which new cases are shown in Figure 7 due to the infection-to-observation
period.
Starting with Bremen on 13/03/2020, more and more restrictive non-pharmaceutical countermeasures have been adopted by the federal states; see Table 1 for a short overview. Their effect on the
reproduction number is clearly visible in Figure 7, resulting in a reproduction number of less than
1 with all measures in place.

The strong weekly pattern in the estimates is due to the fact that less cases are reported around
weekends, cf. Figure 7 where Mondays are marked on the horizontal axis. We do not compute an
average over a sliding window of seven days so the viewer immediately recognizes the size of such
artefacts, warning her to be overly confident in the results. In fact, these artefacts are much larger
than the statistical uncertainty due to the stochastic nature of the epidemic which is reflected in
the confidence intervals.

6

Sensitivity analysis

The estimator depends on two ingredients, the data, of course, and the infectivity profile. For
Germany, there is a second dataset provided by Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems
Science and Engineering (2020) whose source are mainly official data, too, but collected at the
local level once they are available. In particular, as soon as data become available, they are marked
as reported on that very day. They therefore show a far less pronounced weekday effect than the
data from the Robert Koch-Institut (2020), see Figure 9 and compare with Figure 7. Moreover,
data are not backedited, so even yesterday’s data are final and can be used.
The estimates based on the data from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science
and Engineering (2020) differ quantitatively but not qualitatively from the ones using the data of
the (Robert Koch-Institut; 2020), see Figure 10.
To understand the effect the infectivity profile exerts on the estimates, we consider the infectivity
profile we computed for the stochastic SEIR-model used for simulations in Section 4 (see Figure 2),
employing it to estimate the reproduction numbers using the data from the Robert Koch-Institut
(2020) again. When comparing the results with the ones obtained using the infectivity profile
modelled in Section 3 (see Figure 1), one observes that the former profile has a longer tail, so the
estimator takes values from further in the past into account, which for increasing case numbers
reduces the denominator in Equation (5), and hence somewhat increases the estimates. Once case
numbers stabilise, this effect obviously vanishes. As with the data source, the influence of the
infectivity profile appears to be small enough not to matter qualitatively.

7

Discussion

The results for simulated data in Section 4 demonstrate the validity of the estimator, and of the
asymptotic confidence intervals we derived. This is substantiated further by the fact that the
estimated reproduction numbers’ decrease for Germany correlate strongly with enforcement of
non-pharmaceutical countermeasures there.
Let us stress the advantage of this estimator over approaches which determine growth rates or
doubling times by fitting exponential growth models to numbers of either new cases or total
cases in the initial phase of the epidemic where the proportion of susceptibles is close to 100%,
cf. (Obadia et al.; 2012). In fact, the latter models are implicitly based on the assumption that
conditions do not change such that the epidemic spreads with a constant growth rate, and thus
with a constant reproduction number. But here we aim to determine a varying reproduction
number. Fitting exponential growth models to total case numbers therefore is not conducive, even
when localising the procedure by considering short time windows. Indeed, the case numbers from
the past which occurred under different conditions will always affect the estimates. This problem
is alleviated when exponential growth models are fitted locally to the numbers of new cases. Still,
one needs to assume that conditions change slowly – which is debatable for the drastic measures
which have been implemented quickly. In any case, even if one could observe new infections
directly, the resulting estimates would be (additionally) smoothened, as opposed to the unbiased,
sharp results obtained for the estimator we consider here (cf. Figure 4).
Nonetheless, the estimates have to be cautiously interpreted. For one, the calculated confidence
intervals quantify only a rather small part of the uncertainty, namely the one which stems from
the stochastic nature of the epidemic’s evolution over time. Other uncertainties may affect the
estimates much more, in particular when case numbers are large. In the following, we discuss
those which we believe to be most important.
The first set of difficulties concerns the quality of the data.

(a) Not all infections are reported, for example because cases remain asymptomatic, or because
infected persons die without having been tested. If the proportion of infections which get
reported stays constant over time (or at least varies slowly), both numerator and denominator
in Equation (5) are multiplied by the same factor, so they cancel and the estimates are not
affected. Changes in the reporting or testing methodology, however, will affect the estimates,
as they will be indistinguishable from a true increase or decrease in the number of infections.
This will for example happen if more people are tested due to higher capacities in testing
facilities, or if lower case numbers allow more extensive tests of potential contacts, or if deaths
are attributed to the disease without testing when such capacities are exhausted. Potential
remedies include to not only consider reported infections but take fatalities, test rates etc.
into account.
(b) The reporting date is not the date of infection: when the patient becomes symptomatic, he
has to visit a physician, samples have to be tested, the test results need to be interpreted,
and finally reported to the authorities. The strength of this effect is visible from the periodic
pattern related to the days of the week in Figures 7 and 8. For some of the data provided
by the Robert Koch-Institut (2020), both the reporting date, and the day of symptom onset
are known, which in principle allows to infer dates of symptom onset for the entire dataset,
thus getting rid of the weekday’s influence. But the difficulty that the estimator is based on
knowing the date of infection remains, cf. Section 4 with Figure 6. To treat this properly, one
would need to know the distribution of the incubation times, and compute a deconvolution.
(c) Imported cases, i.e. travellers who became infected abroad and got reported after returning
home, should not be counted as secondary cases because the corresponding primary case has
not been accounted for. However, the location of infection is often unknown; such cases will
then unduly increase the numerator in Equation (5), and hence also the estimated reproduction number. This might explain the surprisingly large estimated values – larger than 4, cf.
Section 3 – at the beginning of March in Germany, see Figure 8, when many infections were
acquired during holidays abroad.
Other problems originate from the modelling approach.
(d) In Equation (2), a structural assumption was made: the infectivity profile does not change over
time. If changing conditions affect cases at different infection ages differently, e.g. because the
health system is overwhelmed and no longer can provide for high quality isolation of severe
cases (with higher infection ages), or because better medical treatment for such cases becomes
available, then the change of the transmissibility β depends on the infection age. As a result,
the estimates for the reproduction number will combine the changes for the different infection
ages into a certain average.
(e) Similarly, the method does not distinguish individuals in different strata of the population,
e.g. age groups or regions. So changes which affect certain strata more and others less, e.g.
school closures, will again be averaged over the population.
(f) Finally, the infectivity profile requires modelling. We stress that this needs to be distinguished
from a virological assessment of a case’s level of infectiousness, as it rather describes the
potential to successfully transmit the virus. For example, the probability at a late stage of
the infection may be assumed to be very low: such a person is most likely to be well isolated,
either at home (where either all other members of the household have already been infected or
apparently are immune) or at a hospital (where isolation measures are strict), so even though
from a virological point of view the person may be highly infectious, she probably will not
cause a secondary infection at that stage. From data on chains of infection, it may be possible
to directly estimate the infectivity profile from the observed generation times.
All these issues render comparisons between countries particularly difficult. In any case, they
sound a note of caution when looking at the proposed estimates. Nonetheless, encouraged by the
results in Section 5, we believe that qualitatively correct conclusions may be drawn from them,
and that they may prove useful to continuously monitor the spread of COVID-19.

Derivation of confidence intervals

Starting from Equation (4), the conditional expectation of R̂(t) given the past is
E(I(t)|I(t − 1), . . . )
= R(t) .
E(R̂(t) | I(t − 1), . . . ) = P∞
τ =1 w(τ )I(t − τ )

(9)

Therefore, R̂(t) is unbiased,
E R̂(t) = R(t) ,

(10)

and the conditional variance of R̂(t) is given by
R(t)
.
w(τ
)I(t − τ )
τ =1

Var(R̂(t) | I(t − 1), . . . ) = P∞

(11)

An application of Slutsky’s lemma gives an asymptotic (1 − α)-confidence interval for R(t): if q
denotes the (1 − α2 )-quantile of the standard normal distribution it is given by
s

"
R̂(t) − q

Note that (approximate) coverage is always guaranteed conditionally on the past, and hence also
without conditioning.

Derivation of the infectivity profile for the SEIR-model

Both latent period and infectious period are geometrically distributed with parameters pI and
pR , respectively. We essentially need to compute the convolution (summing over time s of getting
infectious). For τ > 1 and assuming pI > pR (the other cases are similar), we obtain
w(τ ) =
