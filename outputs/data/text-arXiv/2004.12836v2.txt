Abstract
Understanding how widely COVID-19 has spread is critical for examining the pandemic’s
progression. Despite efforts to carefully monitor the pandemic, the number of confirmed cases may
underestimate the total number of infections. We introduce a demographic scaling model to
estimate COVID-19 infections using an broadly applicable approach that is based on minimal data
requirements: COVID-19 related deaths, infection fatality rates (IFRs), and life tables. As many
countries lack reliable estimates of age-specific IFRs, we scale IFRs between countries using
remaining life expectancy as a marker to account for differences in age structures, health
conditions, and medical services. Across 10 countries with most COVID-19 deaths as of May 13,
2020, the number of infections is estimated to be four [95% prediction interval: 2-11] times higher
than the number of confirmed cases. Cross-country variation is high. The estimated number of
infections is 1.4 million (six times the number of confirmed cases) for Italy; 3.1 million (2.2 times
the number of confirmed cases) for the U.S.; and 1.8 times the number of confirmed cases for
Germany, where testing has been comparatively extensive. Our prevalence estimates, however,
are markedly lower than most others based on local seroprevalence studies. We introduce formulas
for quantifying the bias that is required in our data on deaths in order to reproduce estimates
published elsewhere. This bias analysis shows that either COVID-19 deaths are severely
underestimated, by a factor of two or more; or alternatively, the seroprevalence based results are
overestimates and not representative for the total population.

Introduction
The total number of COVID-19 infections is a key indicator for understanding the spread of the
pandemic. Despite its central importance in policy decisions, this indicator is largely unknown. The
number of confirmed COVID-19 cases may underestimate the total number, and the few
seroprevalence studies for COVID-19 have relied on non-representative samples.1-4 Moreover,
estimates that are based on complex statistical methods and simulation approaches 5,6 provide
important information, but have high data demands, and are not straightforward to implement.
We introduce a demographic scaling approach to estimate the number of COVID-19 infections and
their fraction in a population. This indirect approach can be applied in many contexts, as it requires
only a small amount of input data: namely, the number of COVID-19-related deaths for the
population of interest; and the age-specific infection fatality rates (IFR; deaths over infections) from
a reference population, scaled to match the target population based on life tables.
Scaling IFRs is not only a key and novel feature of the introduced approach, it is necessary, as
age-specific IFRs are not available for many countries. The scaling step allows us to transfer the
best IFR estimates available globally from a reference population to a target population. The IFRs
are scaled to indirectly adjust for underlying differences in age structures, health conditions, and
health care services. The scaling makes use of the demographic concept of remaining life
expectancy, which is sometimes called thanatological age. It maps IFRs between a reference and
a target country so that the people in a given age group in the target population are assigned the
same IFR as the people in another age group in the reference population if they have the same
number of remaining life years.
We apply the demographic scaling model to estimate the total numbers of COVID-19 infections as
well as their population fractions in 10 countries that have the most reported COVID-19 deaths as
of May 13, 2020. The model estimates suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic is much more spread
in each of those countries than the number of confirmed cases suggests. We also find that the
population fractions have increased exponentially with time, reaching levels as high as 3.1% [95%
prediction interval: 2.6%-7.7%] in Belgium, but that they are far from reaching levels required for
herd immunity.
The demographic scaling model can also be used to validate the quality of infection prevalence
estimates based on other approaches. We do this by developing formulas for quantifying the bias
that is required in our data on deaths or IFRs in order to reproduce infection estimates that are
based on local seroprevalence studies or simulation models published elsewhere. This bias
quantification can be used both for validating our model results, and as a benchmark for assessing
the quality of infection estimates from other sources. Our model estimates of the COVID-19
prevalence are considerably lower than the estimates of recent local seroprevalence studies for
the U.S., Italy, and Germany. This discrepancy can result either from the input data (deaths or
IFRs) in our approach being wrong, or the local seroprevalence studies not being representative.
Using our model to assess the bias required to reproduce the results of these local seroprevalence
studies indicates either a very high undercount of deaths, e.g., fewer than two in 100 deaths for
Germany, which is perhaps unlikely; or that the local infection estimates were not representative
for the total population on the national level.

The empirical relationship between confirmed cases and deaths from COVID-19
Figure 1 shows the relationship between confirmed cases and deaths from COVID-19 for the 10
countries that have reported the most COVID-19 deaths as of May 13, 2020. The countries fan out
between Belgium and Germany, and their crude case fatality rates (CFR; deaths over confirmed

2

cases) range between 4.5% and 16.4%. Up to this date, Belgium, France, the U.K., Italy, the
Netherlands, and Spain had experienced more COVID-19 deaths per confirmed cases than Brazil,
the U.S., Iran, or Germany. This variation in CFRs could be driven by several factors, some of
which are “real” differences arising from differences in the age-specific mortality risks among the
infected.7,8,9 However, the variation in CFRs may also reflect other factors, such as differences in
testing intensity10,11 and test specificity;11,12 variation in terms of the age structure of the number of
confirmed cases;8 the stage of progress of the COVID-19 outbreak;1 and differences in the
classification of deaths. Roser and colleagues13 discussed most of these issues.
FIGURE 1
For our purposes, a key question is whether the numerator of the CFR, or the number of deaths, is
more or less accurate than the denominator, or the number of confirmed cases. The number of
confirmed cases may strongly underestimate the total number of COVID-19 cases.11,14 For
example, cases with mild symptoms or asymptomatic cases may go undetected; test coverage
may be poor, and may focus on specific sub-populations only, or on tracing back only to people
with proven contact to confirmed COVID-19 cases; and false negatives may outnumber false
positives.11,12
On the other hand, the number of COVID-19 deaths may be under- or overestimated. Reporting
delays and inconsistent practices for defining COVID-19 deaths are among the key sources of
error. For example, in some contexts, all deceased individuals who have had COVID-19 may be
counted, while in other contexts, only deceased individuals for whom COVID-19 was the primary
cause of death, or only deceased individuals who had been hospitalized for treatment of COVID19, may be counted. Testing practices and coverage may also be insufficient to detect all of the
individuals who have died from COVID-19.13 This could lead to COVID-19 deaths being
undercounted. Studies that analyze excess mortality would be helpful for quantifying this bias. 15
We argue, however, that the numbers of COVID-19 deaths are more reliable than the numbers of
confirmed COVID-19 cases, and thus use COVID-19 deaths as the core empirical input in our
estimation approach. However, since the coverage of COVID-19 deaths is difficult to assess, we
develop formulas for assessing the potential effects of the over- and the underreporting of COVID19 deaths on our results.
Demographic scaling approach to estimate COVID-19 infections
We introduce a demographic scaling approach to estimate the total number of COVID-19 infections.
This approach is built on the assumption that COVID-19 deaths are fairly accurately recorded, and
that IFRs borrowed from a reference country reflect the true IFRs of the target country after
appropriate scaling. Each of these assumptions can be criticized, and we do so below in the
Discussion.
We start with the basic identity that represents the age-specific number of infected:
(1) 𝐼𝑥 = 𝑃𝑥 ⋅ 𝜆𝑥 ,
where 𝐼 is the unknown number of infected, P is the known population size, 𝜆 is the unknown
fraction of the infected population, and x denotes the age group. We estimate 𝜆𝑥 by using the
equation 𝐷𝑥 = 𝐼𝐹𝑅𝑥 ⋅ 𝑃𝑥 ⋅ 𝜆𝑥 , where 𝐷 is the number of deaths and 𝐼𝐹𝑅 is the infection fatality rate.
We rearrange the equation to get 𝜆𝑥 = 𝐷𝑥 /[𝐼𝐹𝑅𝑥 ⋅ 𝑃𝑥 ], and estimate the total number of infected by
(2) I = ∑𝑥 𝑃𝑥 ⋅ 𝜆𝑥
Replacing 𝜆𝑥 with its definition yields
(3) 𝐼 = ∑𝑥 𝐷𝑥 /𝐼𝐹𝑅𝑥

3

The key challenge is to arrive at credible estimates of 𝐼𝐹𝑅𝑥 and 𝐷𝑥 .
The simplest way to obtain estimates of 𝐼𝐹𝑅𝑥 is to borrow them from some source that appears to
be valid for the country of interest. We call this approach the unadjusted approach, and consider it
a potentially viable option only if the life table data needed for the scaling approach are not
available. The unadjusted approach is risky, as IFRs that are valid in one context may not carry
over to another context, even if they are age-specific. For example, the presence of underlying
health conditions – such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, chronic respiratory diseases,
hypertension, and cancer16 – increase the risk of death of a given COVID-19 infection, and the
distribution of these conditions varies. In addition, the ability of health care systems to treat illnesses
effectively may differ across countries.
A superior approach is to adjust the IFRs taken from one context to reflect the specific age structure,
health status, and health care system of the target country. To control for such cross-country
differences, we map IFRs between two countries based on their remaining lifetime (or
thanatological age), denoted by 𝑒𝑥 . More specifically, we assign the same infection fatality rate
(IFR) to people of two countries who have, on average, the same number of life years left (𝑒𝑥 ):
𝐼𝐹𝑅𝑒𝐶𝑂𝐼
= 𝐼𝐹𝑅𝑒𝑅𝐶
,
𝑥
𝑥
where COI denotes the country of interest and RC denotes the reference country. For example, if
70-year-olds in a reference country have, on average, the same number of life years left as 75year-olds in a country of interest, the infection fatality rate of the 70-year-olds in the reference
country is used for the 75-year-olds in the country of interest.
Mapping infection fatality rates based on remaining lifetime allows us to adjust for cross-country
differences in age and health structures, as well as in medical care. That is because remaining life
time is a function of underlying health conditions and a health care system’s effectiveness in curing
them.17 The fewer underlying health conditions people have and the more effective medical care is
in treating them, the healthier people are and the more life years they have left.
Another data challenge is related to COVID-19 deaths, 𝐷𝑥 . While these counts are available in total
numbers for many countries worldwide,18 they are often not available by age. To deal with this
problem, we disaggregate the total deaths into age groups using a global average pattern over age
that we estimated by analyzing all data on COVID-19 deaths by age provided by Dudel and
colleagues8 (SI appendix 3).
Deaths may be misreported. The impact on our results can be assessed by introducing the relative
amount of under- or overreporting directly into formula (3),
(4) 𝐼 𝐵 = 𝐵 ∑𝑥 𝐷𝑥 /𝐼𝐹𝑅𝑥 = 𝐵 ∙ 𝐼 𝑇 ,
where 𝐵 captures under- and overreporting, assuming that misreporting affects all ages to the same
extent; 𝐼 𝑇 is the true number of infections; and 𝐼 𝐵 is the number of infections observed with
reporting bias. If 𝐵 is below one, then there is bias through underreporting; and if 𝐵 is above one,
then there is bias through overreporting. Equation (4) shows that if there is an estimate of 𝐵, a
biased estimate of infections can easily be adjusted to derive the true number, 𝐼 𝑇 = 𝐼 𝐵 /𝐵. Equation
(4) also allows us to calculate the misreporting of deaths that is required to “explain” an estimate of
𝐼 taken from another reference. For example, if our method provides an estimate 𝐼 𝐸 , while another
method, such as a seroprevalence study, yields another estimate 𝐼 𝑆 , then to explain the difference
between 𝐼 𝐸 and 𝐼 𝑆 through misreporting, while assuming that 𝐼 𝑆 is the true value, 𝐵 has to equal
𝐼 𝐸 /𝐼 𝑆 . Depending on the resulting value of 𝐵, the values of 𝐼 𝐸 and 𝐼 𝑆 might be considered
inconsistent if 𝐵 is very high or low. This may indicate that the reporting of deaths is biased, or that
the results of the seroprevalence study are not representative.

We use the scaling approach (1) to estimate the total number and prevalence of COVID-19
infections for the 10 countries that have reported the most deaths caused by COVID-19 as of May
13, 2020 and (2) to assess the validity of recent local seroprevalence studies for the U.S., Italy, and
Germany. As input data, we use (1) 2019 population counts of the UN World Population
Prospects;19 (2) accumulated total COVID-19 deaths from Johns Hopkins University CSSE;18 and
(3) IFRs reported by Verity and colleagues20 for Hubei. Verity and colleagues 20 conducted a
Bayesian analysis, and provided credible intervals for their point estimates. We use these credible
intervals to generate uncertainty estimates (prediction intervals) of the number of infected
individuals. Both the population counts and the IFRs are provided by 10-year age groups, 0 − 9,
10 − 19, …, 80 +. We disaggregate COVID-19 total deaths into the same 10-year age groups using
the global average pattern over age that we estimated based on the data provided by Dudel and
colleagues.8 Details about the model and additional findings based on, e.g., unadjusted IFRs,
adjusted IFRs from a European reference country as reported by Salje and colleagues, 21 and
average time to death from COVID-19 are given in SI appendix 1 through 6.
Results
Figure 2 shows the numbers of confirmed and estimated COVID-19 infections as of May 13, 2020.
Our estimates suggest that across the countries, the total number of infections is approximately
four times higher than the number of confirmed cases. For example, for the U.S., which has 1.4
million confirmed cases, we estimate that the total number of infections might range from
approximately 1.4 million to 6.7 million, with a central estimate of 3.1 million infections. For a large
number of countries, the central estimate for the number of infections is more than five times higher
than the number of confirmed cases. For example, for Italy, we estimate that there are
approximately 1.4 million infections, whereas the total number of confirmed cases is just 222k.
Germany, where testing has been comparatively extensive, stands out in this context, as our results
suggest that the number of infections in Germany is only 1.8 times higher than the number of
confirmed cases (305k versus 174k).
FIGURE 2
Our lower bound estimates suggest that across the countries in our sample, the total number of
infections is approximately twice as high as the number of confirmed cases. For example, for Italy,
the lower bound is 590k, or 2.7 times the number of confirmed cases (222k). For France, our lower
bound estimate is 536k infections, which is 3.1 times higher than the number of confirmed cases
(176k). In Germany, our lower bound estimates suggest that the total number of infections might
be lower, at 138k, than the number of confirmed cases (174k). Note, however, that the confirmed
cases within 95% prediction intervals do not indicate model error, but rather effective testing in a
country, as many people who are or have been infected with COVID-19 are detected.
The upper bound estimates for the total number of confirmed cases suggest that the total number
of infections may be more than 11 times higher than the number of confirmed cases in some
countries. For the U.S., our results suggest that there is an upper bound of 6.7 million, which is
almost five times higher than the number of confirmed cases. In Belgium, Italy, and France, our
upper bound estimates are 892k, 3.7 million, and 3.3 million, respectively, or more than 16 to 18
times higher than the numbers of confirmed cases. In addition, for Spain, the U.K., and the
Netherlands, our upper bound estimates are more than 13 to 16 times higher than the number of
confirmed cases. Iran, Germany, and Brazil are the only countries where the upper bound is less
than five times higher than the number of confirmed cases.
Figure 3 shows the COVID-19 prevalence estimates over time. For each date shown, the numbers
may underestimate the fractions of the population who are infected, since we do not account for
the time lag between infection and death. However, accounting for the time lag is not expected to

5

strongly change the shape of the curves (as shown in SI appendix 6). Based on these estimates,
as of May 13, 2020, we find the central prevalence to be on average 1.5%. It ranges from 3.1% in
Belgium; to between 1.9% and 2.7% in Spain, Italy, France, and the U.K.; to approximately 1.3%
in the Netherlands; to 0.9% in the U.S. and to 0.4% or less in Germany, Iran, and Brazil. The
uncertainty bounds are wide and range on average between 0.7% and 3.8%. The lower bound
includes values as low as 0.01%, 0.1%, and 0.2% for Brazil, Iran, and Germany, respectively. The
upper bound includes values as high as 7.8%, 7.7%, and 6.1% for Spain, Belgium, and Italy,
respectively.
FIGURE 3
Considering both the total numbers and prevalence of COVID-19 infections provides two
complementary perspectives on the progress of the pandemic within and between countries. While
we estimate for the U.S. to have the largest numbers of infections across our sample of ten
countries, as of May 13, 2020, we also estimate for the U.S. to have a comparatively small
prevalence of individuals who are infected with COVID-19. We find an opposite pattern for Belgium,
a country that has almost 30 times fewer inhabitants than the U.S.. We estimate for Belgium to
have comparatively small total numbers of infections, but comparatively high infection prevalence.
In fact, we estimate the population fractions of COVID-19 infections to be largest in Belgium since
April 22, 2020, so that they are even larger than in Spain and Italy who are estimated to have had
the largest COVID-19 prevalence since April 2, 2020 and February 24, 2020, respectively, as
COVID-19 has started to spread earlier in those two countries.
Compared to the results of recent local seroprevalence studies for the U.S., Italy, and Germany,
our COVID-19 prevalence estimates are much lower for those countries. We assess the quality of
these seroprevalence-based infection estimates with our demographic scaling model by showing
how many more COVID-19 deaths would have been required to match them. For example,
Bendavid and colleagues3 reported in the middle of April 2020 a seroprevalence between 1.1%
and 5.7% for Santa Clara County in the U.S., compared to our central estimate of 0.4% for the U.S.
as a whole at the same time (April 17, 2020). Assuming the seroprevalence estimate of 1.1% is
correct, we would need to have only one in three COVID-19-related deaths registered. Bendavid
and colleagues3 estimated a seroprevalence of 10% for the city of Robbio in Italy, and a
seroprevalence of 14% for the German municipality of Gangelt. To be compatible with our central
prevalence estimates of 1.7% in Italy and 0.2% in Germany, only one in five COVID-19-related
deaths would have to be recorded in Italy, and fewer than two in 100 deaths would have to be
recorded in Germany. However, when working with the upper bound of our prevalence estimates,
only one in two COVID-19-related deaths would have to be missed for the U.S. and Italy, which is
possible; whereas for Germany, the number is still unrealistically high. Either way, the estimates
based on local, non-representative seroprevalence studies appear to be higher than our prevalence
estimates, which may suggest that they are not representative of the total population.
Discussion
The total number of infections is among the key unknowns of the COVID-19 pandemic. Several
studies have provided estimates of the number and prevalence of COVID-19 infections, based
either on local seroprevalence measurement3,4 or complex projection models.5,6 We have
developed a demographic scaling model to estimate the number and prevalence of infections
based on modest data requirements. Our results suggest that across the 10 countries with most
COVID-19 deaths as of May 13, 2020, the total number of infected individuals is approximately four
times higher than the number of confirmed cases. However, the level of uncertainty about these
findings is high, as the lower and upper bound of the 95% prediction interval suggest that, on
average, there are twice and 11 times as many infections as confirmed cases, respectively.
Country-specific variation is also high. Our estimates for Italy suggest that the total number of
infections is approximately 1.4 million, or more than six times higher than the country-specific

6

number of confirmed cases. For the U.S., our estimate of 3.1 million infections is more than twice
as high as the number of confirmed cases, and the upper bound of 6.7 million is almost five times
higher than the number of confirmed cases. For Germany, where testing has been comparatively
extensive, we estimate that the total number of infections is only 1.8 times (upper bound: slightly
more than four times) higher than the number of confirmed cases.
Considering the urgent need for population-based seroprevalence studies in order to assess the
progress of the COVID-19 pandemic and to determine optimal time points for (de-)escalating
control measures, it is also critically important to have at hand or to introduce evaluation tools for
them. Our demographic scaling approach is also a suitable tool to validate infection prevalence
estimates that have been published based on seroprevalence studies. It can be used to analyze
(1) how many more or fewer deaths or (2) how much higher or lower infection fatality rates would
need to be for our results to match those from seroprevalence studies. A comparison of our model
estimates for the U.S., Italy, and Germany with results from recent local seroprevalence studies
shows that the latter usually provide rather high prevalence estimates that are unlikely to apply to
the total population, particularly in the case of Germany. Local seroprevalence studies may be
biased due to various reasons, such as false negative and false positive test results, and population
samples that are not nationally representative.22
Our model estimates of COVID-19 infections build on two key assumptions: (1) total numbers of
deaths from COVID-19 are accurately recorded, and (2) the scaled infection fatality rates from
China reported by Verity and colleagues20 (or from another source) can be applied to other
countries. At best, these assumptions only partially hold.
Our first key assumption implies that COVID-19 deaths are fairly accurately recorded. However,
COVID-19 deaths may be underestimated, particularly in regions that are heavily affected by the
pandemic.23 Reporting delays that can be as long as several days may result in the underestimation
of COVID-19 deaths in all regions. Inconsistent and changing practices for defining COVID-19
deaths and poor test coverage may also influence the accuracy of death counts.13 However, as we
argue that the numbers of COVID-19 deaths are more reliable than the numbers of confirmed
COVID-19 cases, we selected death counts as the core empirical input in our estimation approach.
If the numbers of total deaths were too small, the estimated numbers of infections would be biased
downward, and vice versa. However, if the deaths were misreported and the amount of bias caused
by this misreporting was known, our approach could easily incorporate this information. Studies
that analyze excess mortality are urgently needed,15 as they may help to gauge the amount of bias
in COVID-19 death counts.
Our second key assumption implies that infection fatality rates from a reference country become
applicable in a country of interest through scaling based on remaining life expectancy, and that
these life years left are a useful marker to account for overall cross-country differences in age
structure, health conditions, and medical services. Although scaling infection fatality rates between
a reference and a target country increases the applicability of this estimation approach, such
borrowing strategies do not fully reflect country-specific trends. It is also important to note that using
the infection fatality rates of epidemiological studies (based on nasopharyngeal swabs or, even
better, population-representative serological studies) would be preferable to relying on estimates
of other models, as it would enable us to avoid the circling effects between different modeling
approaches. However, infection fatality rates are lacking for many countries so that we make use
of those derived from a Bayesian model for Hubei, China, by Verity and colleagues,20 which have
also been adopted in the context of the U.K. and the U.S.. SI appendix 5 shows how estimations
of COVID-19 infections increase when they are based on scaling French infection fatality rates from
a Bayesian model reported by Salje and colleagues.21 Infection fatality rates can be biased due to,
e.g., model misspecification and misreported input data.
In addition to relying on the two key assumptions regarding death counts and infection fatality rates,
we ignore the time lag between infection (or reporting date) and death, which may be several

7

weeks.24-26 One option for adjusting for the time lag between the onset of infection and death is to
compare estimated infections with confirmed cases 18 days ago, as Zhou and colleagues 25 found
this to be the average duration until death from COVID-19. Accounting for this time lag would lead
to higher estimates of infections (SI appendix 6). However, finding the correct counterpart of
confirmed cases is not straightforward, as reporting dates and data about time to death vary.24,25
Developing simple and fast approaches to estimating the total number and prevalence of infections
is important in situations in which the detailed data needed for precise estimation are not available
and population-representative seroprevalence studies are lacking. Our demographic scaling model
can be implemented broadly, and provides useful information about the magnitude of the unknown
number of infections and their population fractions in countries across the globe. It is also a suitable
tool to validate infection estimates based on model simulations and seroprevalence studies. Our
model outcomes can be used in decision-making, and as input in more advanced models.1,5,6,27-29
Moreover, as the information about the key parameters of the estimation approach – deaths and
infection fatality rates – improves, the approach will produce increasingly accurate results.

COVID-19 infection fatality rates
To estimate COVID-19 infections with the introduced demographic scaling model for the 10
countries with most COVID-19 deaths as of May 13, 2020, we map the infection fatality rates
of Hubei, China, as published by Verity and colleagues.1 For the sake of convenience and
transparency, we list these infection fatality rates (the mode as well as the lower and upper
bound of the 95% credible interval) in Table S1.

Estimate COVID-19 infections based on scaling infection fatality rates between two
countries via thanatological age
It takes four steps to estimate COVID-19 infections for a country of interest with the introduced
demographic scaling model, which maps the infection fatality rates of Hubei, China, onto a
country of interest via the thanatological age.
1. Ungroup the reference country’s infection fatality rates 𝐼𝐹𝑅𝑥 from 10-year age groups into
single years of age using a cubic smoothing spline via the R-function smooth.spline.
2. Ungroup the remaining life years (𝑒𝑥 ), taken from abridged life tables of the UN World
Population Prospects,2 for both the reference country and the country of interest.
3. Map the ungrouped infection fatality rates of the reference country onto the country of
interest via thanatological age. The mapped infection fatality rates for the 10 countries with
the most COVID-19 deaths as of May 13, 2020, are shown in Figure 1.
4. Calculate the number of COVID-19 infections (𝐼) based on equation 𝐼 = ∑𝑥 𝐷𝑥 /𝐼𝐹𝑅𝑥 .
Figure S1 displays the mapped IFRx for the 10 countries with the most deaths attributable to
COVID-19 as of May 13, 2020. Tables S2 and S3 list the corresponding IFRx by 10-year age
groups, as well as the crude IFRx for each of those countries, based on central estimates and
the upper bound of the 95% prediction interval.

Take French infection fatality rates as reference in adjusted model

Figures S5 and S6 illustrate the estimated total numbers and population shares of COVID-19
infections based on the adjusted model that scales French infection fatality rates as reported
by Salje and colleagues5 via remaining life expectancy (thanatological age), from January 22
to May 13, 2020.

Across the 10 countries with the most COVID-19 deaths as of May 13, 2020, our central
estimates suggest that the total number of infections is slightly more than six times higher than
the number of confirmed cases. However, the level of uncertainty is high, as the lower bound
of the 95% credible interval suggests that, on average, there are almost four times as many
infections as confirmed cases, and the upper bound indicates that there are even more than
16 times as many infections as confirmed cases. Country-specific variation is high. Our modal
estimates for Italy suggest that the total number of infections is approximately 2.1 million, or
more than nine times higher than the number of country-specific confirmed cases. For the
U.S., our modal estimate of 4.1 million infections is almost three times higher than the number
of confirmed cases, and the upper bound of almost 13.7 million infections is almost 10 times
higher than the number of confirmed cases. For Germany, where testing has been
comparatively extensive, we estimate that the total number of infections is only 2.5 times
higher (upper bound: 6.5 times higher) than the number of confirmed cases.

Based on the central estimates, as of May 13, 2020, we find that the prevalence of COVID-19
infections ranges from roughly 4% in Belgium and Spain; to between 3.4% and 2.7% in Italy,
France, and the U.K.; to approximately 1.9% in the Netherlands; to 1.3% in the U.S. and to
0.5% or less in Germany, Iran, and Brazil. The uncertainty bounds are wide and range on
average between 1.3% and 5.6%. The COVID-19 prevalence estimates are largest in Belgium,
Spain, and Italy with 11.5%, 10.1%, and 8.7%, respectively.

We find that the total numbers and prevalence of infections are estimated to differ between
the two sets of infection fatality rates as reported by Verity and colleagues1 and Salje and
colleagues5. The infection estimates appear to be larger based on infection fatality rates
reported by Salje and colleagues.5 Figure S7 compares the two sets of infection fatality rates.
It shows that the infection fatality rates of Salje and colleagues 5 are lower for age groups 5059, 60-69, and 70-79 and higher for age group 80+. Both sets of infection fatality rates are
produced with a Bayesian model. They can be biased due to, e.g., model misspecification and
misreported input data.

Account for time to death when estimating COVID-19 infections

Figure S8 compares the estimated numbers of COVID-19 infections with the numbers of
confirmed cases as of April 26, 2020, in order to account for the average time to death of 18.5
days, as reported in Zhou and colleagues.6 We use the adjusted model, scale the Chinese
IFRs via remaining life expectancy (thanatological age), and take the latest deaths from
COVID-19 as of May 13, 2020.

Across the 10 countries with the most COVID-19 deaths as of May 13, 2020, our central
estimates suggest that the total number of infections is approximately six times higher than
the number of confirmed cases. However, the level of uncertainty is high, as the lower bound
of the 95% credible interval suggests that, on average, there are three times as many
infections as confirmed cases, and the upper bound indicates that there are even more than
14 times as many infections as confirmed cases. Country-specific variation is high. Our modal
estimates for Italy suggest that the total number of infections is approximately 1.4 million, or
more than seven times higher than the number of country-specific confirmed cases. For the
U.S., our modal estimate of 3.1 million infections is more than three times higher than the
number of confirmed cases, and the upper bound of 6.7 million infections is more than seven
times higher than the number of confirmed cases. For Germany, where testing has been
comparatively extensive, we estimate that the total number of infections is only two times
higher (upper bound: close to five times higher) than the number of confirmed cases.
