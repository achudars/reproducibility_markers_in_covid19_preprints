Abstract—Airborne transmission is now believed to be the
primary way that COVID-19 spreads. We study the airborne
transmission risk associated with holding in-person classes on
university campuses. We utilize a model for airborne transmission
risk in an enclosed room that considers the air change rate
for the room, mask efficiency, initial infection probability of
the occupants, and also the activity level of the occupants.
We introduce, and use for our evaluations, a metric R0ef f
that represents the ratio of new infections that occur over a
week due to classroom interactions to the number of infected
individuals at the beginning of the week. This can be seen as
a surrogate for the well-known R0 reproductive number metric,
but limited in scope to classroom interactions and calculated on a
weekly basis. The simulations take into account the possibility of
repeated in-classroom interactions between students throughout
the week. We presented model predictions were generated using
Fall 2019 and Fall 2020 course registration data at a large US
university, allowing us to evaluate the difference in transmission
risk between in-person and hybrid programs. We quantify the
impact of parameters such as reduced occupancy levels and mask
efficacy. Our simulations indicate that universal mask usage
results in an approximately 3.6× reduction in new infections
through classroom interactions. Moving 90% of the classes online
leads to about 18× reduction in new cases. Reducing class
occupancy to 20%, by having hybrid classes, results in an
approximately 2.15 − 2.3× further reduction in new infections.

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on
educational institutions around the world. More than 85 colleges and universities across the US have reported at least
1,000 cases of COVID-19, and over 680 institutions have
reported at least 100 cases [1]. More than 124,000 public and
private schools, colleges, and universities in the US closed
in April 2020, impacting more than 55 million students [2].
Worldwide, similar disruptions have affected more than 1.7
billion students [3, 4].
In response to the initial COVID-19 outbreak in Spring
2020, a large number of colleges and universities across the
US decided to cancel classes and close student housing [4].
This work has been supported by a Provost’s New Strategic Directions in
Research and Scholarship Award at USC.

Many universities and colleges moved instruction online. In
Fall 2020, many institutions of higher education in the US
returned to in person instruction. However, this led to a
significant increase in new infections. Several colleges and
universities decided to reopen in the Fall 2020 and provide
hybrid classes where a portion of the students could attend the
classes in person while the others attended online, providing a
partial solution to the problems associated with purely online
instruction. In addition, colleges and universities put in place
rules about physical distancing and face covering usage and
limited social gatherings. Many institutions also put in place
extensive population testing, contact tracing, and quarantining
measures for on-campus students, staff, and faculty. This
combination of measures had some success in curbing the
spread of COVID-19 on campuses [1].
In this work, we study the impact of different policies on
transmission through classroom interactions at universities.
We characterize the effect of parameters such as reduced
occupancy and mask wearing on the number of new infections
generated via university classroom interactions. In particular,
we compare model predictions generated using course registration data from a large US university for Fall 2019, when
all classes were held in person, and for Fall 2020, when most
classes were online and some were conducted in hybrid mode.
The main contribution of this work is to quantify the impact
of university policies on COVID-19 transmission through
classroom interactions. Our analysis indicates that, with the
Fall 2019 schedule in place, universal mask wearing would
have resulted in a roughly 3.6× reduction in new cases
and a reduction in classroom occupancy to 20% would have
resulted in a further 2.15 − 2.3× reduction. Moving 90% of
classes online, as was done for Fall 2020, leads to a roughly
18× reduction in cases relative to the Fall 2019 baseline,
with universal masking and reduced occupancy leading to
further reductions. Together, these findings suggest that the
precautions taken by US institutions of higher education may
have had a significant impact in curbing the spread of COVID19 via classroom interactions.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II
presents a general model for transmission risk in enclosed
spaces. In section III, we describe how this model is used
to compute transmission via classroom interactions in our
simulations. In section IV, we present the Fall 2019 and Fall
2020 datasets that we used in the simulations. The simulation
methodology is discussed in section V. Simulation results are
presented and discussed in section VI. Finally, in section VII
we conclude the paper.
II. G ENERAL R ISK M ODEL
In this section, we present a simple model for airborne
virus emission and exposure in an enclosed space. The goal
is to provide an estimate for airborne virus concentrations
and dosage for a known number of occupants and duration of
proximity. Airborne virus concentrations depend on the number of infectious persons in the room, whether the occupants
are being active or passive, as well as any mitigating factors
such as the use of face coverings, enhanced HVAC protocols,
and limited occupant density due to physical distancing. The
dosage for exposed individuals further depends on the duration
of proximity and the effectiveness of any face coverings. The
main assumption of this model is that it considers perfectlymixed conditions in the room, which means the concentration
of virus particles is uniform. In simple terms, the model
assumes that any airborne particles are mixed throughout the
space quickly. This assumption implies a uniform transmission
risk for all occupants in the room. Such mixed flow or
continuously-stirred reactor models are common in indoor air
quality modeling [5, 6]. In the context of airborne disease
transmission, such models are typically referred to as WellsRiley models after pioneering studies in this field [7–9].
In this model, we consider an enclosed room of volume v
(m3 ) with a volumetric air exchange rate through the HVAC
system Ehvac (m3 /s). The total number of people in the
room is n. Each person is assumed to inspire and expire
(“exchange”) air at the rate of Q (m3 /s) on average. The
probability of a person being initially infected is qi and the
virion emission rate for an infected person is QCia (virions/s)
if the person is being active (e.g., lecturing loudly) and
QCip (virions/s) if the person is being passive (e.g., listening
quietly). A virion is a single infectious virus particle. The
probability of a person being active is pa ; the probability
of a person being passive is therefore pp = 1 − pa . We
further assume that the use of face coverings with the filtration
efficiency f and fˆ for inhalation and exhalation, respectively.
Finally, we assume that the occupants remain in the enclosed
room for the duration of T . Using these parameters, we can
estimate the average airborne virus concentration C using a
room-scale mass balance as:
C(n, qi , pa ) = (1 − fˆ)

n
qi (pa QC ai + (1 − pa )QC pi )
Ehvac v
(1)

and estimate the average virus dose D for an occupant as:
D(n, qi , pa ) = C(n, qi , pa )(1 − f )QT =
n
qi (pa QC ai + (1 − pa )QC pi ) QT (2)
(1 − fˆ)(1 − f )
Ehvac v
Note that the above equations assume steady state conditions.
Further, for simplicity, this formulation neglects virus removal
due to settling and the decay in the number of viable (or
infectious) virus particles over time. In other words, the
primary sink of virions is assumed to be air exchange through
the HVAC system. This is a reasonable simplification given
that (1) settling timescales for aerosols are typically an order
of magnitude higher compared to the time scales associated
with air turnover [10], and (2) there is significant variability
in estimates for how long SARS-CoV-2 remains viable in
aerosols or droplet nuclei [11].
The virus emission rates QCia and QCip can be estimated
based on known virus concentrations and aerosol volumes
for typical active and passive activities [12–14]. For instance,
Stadnytskyi et al. [13] estimate that 25s of active or loud
speaking leads to the emission of between 60nL and 320nL
of oral fluid. The viral load in the sputum is estimated to
be cv ≈ 7 × 106 virions/cm3, though this may be as high
as O(109 ) virions/cm3 [15]. Based on these estimates, the
virus output for an active infected person is expected to be
QCia ≈ 17 − 90 virions/s. Further, the data presented in
Buonanno et al. [14] suggest that virus emissions are roughly
40 times higher while speaking when compared to resting
conditions. Assuming QCia /QCip ≈ 40, virus emissions from
passive persons are expected to be QCip ≈ 0.4 − 2.3 virions/s.
Given the average virus dosage, we can calculate the infection probability for one individual in the room after the
exposure to other potentially initially infected occupants as:
Pi = 1 − e−

D(n,qi ,pa )
D0

(3)

where D0 is the dose that leads to transmission in approximately 63% of cases [8, 14]. Note that the exponential
mapping used to translate virus dose into a transmission
probability implicitly accounts for the variation in physiological responses to the same exposure as well as the roomscale variation in exposure that the well-mixed model neglects
(i.e., arising from concentration hotspots). To our knowledge,
the infectious dose for SARS-CoV-2 remains uncertain, but
previous estimates for SARS-CoV-1 and Influenza A suggest
that 300 − 800 virions are needed to cause infection in 50% of
the population [16, 17]. If the infectious dose is D0 = 1000
virions, the respiratory emission estimates provided above
suggest that active infectious persons with QCia ≈ 17 − 90
virions/s can emit approximately 60 to 320 infectious doses
per hour while passive persons can emit approximately 1.8 to 7
infectious doses per hour. These ranges are consistent with the
estimates provided by Buonanno et al. [14], who suggest that
infectious persons undergoing light activity and talking can
generate over 100 quanta per hour, where a quantum is defined
as the dose required to cause infection in 63% of susceptible
persons. We recognize that there is significant variability in

our estimates for both virus emissions and infectious dose.
As a result, any predictions for absolute infection risk must
be treated with caution. Nevertheless, predictions generated
using the physics-based model presented in this section should
still provide useful estimates for relative risk under different
scenarios.
III. C LASSROOM R ISK M ODEL
In this section, we take the model presented in section II
and adapt it to consider classroom interactions. A classroom is
assumed to be occupied by instructors (teachers) and students.
Instructors are more likely to be active (i.e., lecturing) during
a class while students are more likely to be passive (i.e.,
listening). Therefore, to better model classrooms interactions,
we assume different activity levels for instructors (teachers)
and students and we also consider the effect of differing initial
infection probabilities for instructors (teachers) and students.
Specifically, we assume instructors (teachers) and students
have activity rates of pta and psa , respectively. Similarly, we
assume instructors and students have initial infection probabilities qit and qis , respectively. We further assume that we have
N s students in a classroom and 1 instructor. N s is the number
of students attending the class in person and is given by:
N s = αn,

(4)

where n is the total number of students enrolled in the class
and α is the occupancy ratio of the students who attend
the class in person. The average viral dose from m infected
students in a classroom can be calculated as:
s
Dm
= D(m, 1, psa )

we have:
s
Pi,class
=

N
X

psi (m, N s )[qit Pi (1, m) + (1 − qit )Pi (0, m)].

m=0

(10)
Using the above formulation, we can now formally define
three important metrics for assessing the impact of classroom
s
interactions over one week: (i) Pi,week
, the individual infection
1
s
probability for students , (ii) P̂i,week , the average infection
probability, and (iii) R0ef f , the effective reproduction number.
We define these metrics below.
The reason that we present these metrics with reference to
the time period of one week is in part a modeling choice –
our analysis and simulations could easily be carried out for
any other time period. However, one week is a natural timescale to focus on for two reasons. First, class schedules repeat
weekly. Second, COVID-19 symptoms appear at the latest
after two weeks, and on average symptomatic patients show
the symptoms after one week [18]. We assume individuals
would not attend classes once they are symptomatic.
If a particular student j attends k classes with infection
probabilities of p1 , p2 , · · · , pk , the individual infection probability for this particular student after attending one week of
classes will be:
s
Pi,week
(j) = 1 − (1 − p1 )n1 (1 − p2 )n2 · · · (1 − pk )nk , (11)

where ni is the number of sessions for the class i. We can
then define the average infection probability after one week
of classes as:
s

and the average viral dose from one infected instructor can be
calculated as:
Dt = D(1, 1, pta ).
(6)
The infection probability for a student in a given classroom
after one session, for the case that the instructor and m
students are initially infected, is given by:
Pi (1, m) = 1 − e−

s
Dt +Dm
D0

The infection probability for a student in the case that the
instructor is not initially infected but m students are initially
infected is given by:
Pi (0, m) = 1 − e

(12)

A well-known parameter for infection spread in epidemics is
R0 , referred to as the expected reproductive number, which
indicates the average number of individuals infected by one
initially infected individual in a population. For classroom
interactions over a week, we can define a similar ratio of
new cases to initial cases by taking the ratio of infection
probabilities before and after the week. We thus define the
effective R0 from one week of operating classes as:
R0ef f =

s
P̂i,week

IV. DATASET

To find the total infection probability for a student in a class
session, we have to first compute the probability that m
students out of N s will be infectious given the initial infection
probability of 1 student as qis . For this purpose, we use the
following binomial probability:

We obtained registration information of all students for a
large US university for Fall 2019 and Fall 2020. Both datasets
include information for each student registered for classes. For
Fall 2019, we consider only classes that were held in person
(as most of them were). However, the classes in Fall 2020
were either online or hybrid. In hybrid mode, a fraction of
students are assumed to attend the class in person and the rest

for Fall 2019 there were 5986 courses with 34042 students
on campus. For Fall 2020, there were 523 hybrid courses
and 6376 students registered for those classes. The remaining
classes were entirely online and are therefore not considered
in this study.

We performed simulations to understand the impact of
holding one week of classes. We used the three metrics
introduced in section III to evaluate the impact of different
policies on virus spread predicted in our simulations. The
first metric is the infection probability of individual students
after attending one week of classes, shown in equation (11).
This metric is shown via histograms in figure 1 for different
policies for the Fall 2019 and Fall 2020 datasets. The second
metric is the average infection probability of the students after
attending one week of classes, shown in equation (12). The
third metric is the effective reproduction number R0ef f for the
students given in equation (13) for one week of classes. This
metric was calculated for differing scenarios and is presented
in Table III. In the simulations, we explicitly study the impact
of the following parameters on classroom transmission.
• α: This parameter represents the occupancy ratio of the
number of students who attend the class in person. We
consider the default value for the occupancy ratio to be
α = 0.2 for hybrid classes in the Fall 2020 dataset, which
assumed that 20% of registered students attend the classes
in person. For in person classes in the Fall 2019 dataset,
we assume full occupancy, α = 1.
• f, fˆ: These parameters represent how effective masks
are in decreasing transmission probability. The default
value for the mask efficiency is considered to be 0.5
based on experimental measurements made for a variety
of common mask materials [19].
For reference, default values for each parameter are shown in
table II.

For the business-as-usual case with the Fall 2019 dataset (i.e.,
in-person classes, full occupancy, no mask usage), figure 1(a)
shows that a significant proportion of the students have high
s
individual infection probabilities, Pi,week
≥ 0.05. Indeed,
the average infection probability after one week of classes
s
is P̂i,week
= 0.05407, which is more than five times higher
than the initial infection probabilities for the students and
instructors. In other words, the simulations predict that holding
classes in person without occupancy reductions or masking
requirements would have led to a substantial increase in
infection rates for the students.
Figure 1(b) shows that the transition to online instruction
with limited hybrid classes leads to a substantial reduction
in infection probabilities compared to the business-as-usual
scenario. Specifically, the average infection probability for the
s
students reduces by more than a factor of 3 to P̂i,week
=
0.01508 even without occupancy reductions or mask usage.
Note that this average infection probability is still higher than
the initial infection probabilities at the start of the week, which
is indicative of a reproductive number greater than 1. However,
as shown in figures 1(d) and 1(f), the use of 50% effective
masks and a reduction to 20% occupancy leads to significant
further reductions in average infection probabilities to levels
where the effective reproductive number is less than 1.
Table III provides a summary of average infection probabilities and effective reproductive numbers for the different
scenarios we considered. The simulations predict a lower average infection probability for Fall 2020 compared to Fall 2019
across all masking and occupancy conditions. They indicate
that universal mask usage results in an approximately 3.6×
reduction in new infections through classroom interactions.
In addition, reducing class occupancy to 20%, by having
hybrid classes, results in an approximately 2.15−2.3× further
reduction in new infections. The transition to having 90% of
the courses online between Fall 2019 to Fall 2020 alone, even
without using masks or reducing the occupancy, results in a
18× reduction of cases.

VI. R ESULTS AND D ISCUSSION

VII. C ONCLUSION

We now study the impact of different policies on virus
spread for the Fall 2019 and Fall 2020 datasets in the context
of the three different metrics discussed in section V.
Figure 1 shows infection probability distributions for the
students after one week of classes under three different occupancy and masking scenarios for Fall 2019 and Fall 2020.

In this work, we have studied the impact of various policies on COVID-19 transmission via classroom interactions at
universities. Our specific aim has been to quantify the effect
of different policies on transmission rates, and thereby enable
institutions of higher education to prepare for future epidemics.
We utilized an established model for airborne transmission in

We also obtained a dataset containing information about
buildings, classroom sizes, ventilation rates, and maximum
occupancy (or capacity). This dataset was used to estimate
the physical parameters (classroom volume v, air change rate
Ehvac , etc.) appearing in equations (1)-(2).

enclosed classrooms and registration data from a large university to perform simulations for different scenarios. We also
introduced a quantitative metric R0ef f that represents the ratio
of the infection probability after holding one week of classes
to the initial infection probability. We consider this metric
to be analogous to the well-known reproductive number, R0 .
We have analyzed the effect of classroom occupancy, mask
usage, and initial infection probabilities in the student and
instructor populations on transmission. The simulations also
accounted for repeated interactions in classes between students
throughout the week. In the future, it would be of interest to
also investigate the effect of student interactions outside of
classes, although, it is challenging to find relevant data.
