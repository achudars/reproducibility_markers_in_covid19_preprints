Introduction:
COVID-19 has exposed glaring holes in our existing digital1, data2, and organizational3
practices. Researchers ensconced in epidemiological and human health work have repeatedly
pointed out how urban encroachment, climate change, and other human-triggered activities and
patterns are going to make zoonotic pandemics more frequent and commonplace4. The ​Gray
Rhino5 mindset provides a useful reframing (as opposed to viewing pandemics such as the
current one as a ​Black Swan6 event) that can help us recover faster from these (increasingly)
frequent occurrences and build resiliency in our digital, data, and organizational infrastructure.
Mitigating the social and economic impacts of pandemics can be eased through building
infrastructure that elucidate leading indicators via passive intelligence gathering so that
responses to containing the spread of pandemics are not blanket measures; instead, they can
be fine-grained allowing for more efficient utilization of scarce resources and minimizing
disruption to our way of life.
Yet, pervasive monitoring poses significant privacy7 and trust challenges8 limiting the efficacy of
such measures. In addition, ad-hoc approaches further diminish trust in these measures.
Participatory design9 and proactive development to generate preparedness will not only elicit
higher levels of trust, but also help to build infrastructures that are tailored better for the
communities that they are meant to serve and help us better weather the harmful societal
impacts of pandemics.
Digital infrastructure interventions:
From a digital infrastructure standpoint, continual investments in extending the reach of
networks and internet access to the “last-mile” areas that are as of yet uncovered is important if
we’re to embark on helping ​all ​communities recover swiftly by sharing with them the necessary
tools that allow them to function during periods of distancing and other protective measures

mandates by health authorities. Sparsely connected regions have faced a disproportionate
burden of this current pandemic10 due to their inability to access digital services, hindering their
ability to work remotely (to the extent that their workplaces allowed for that).
Parallel investments in extending high-speed internet via existing wired and wireless networks
can help reach sparsely populated regions11. This will enable better data collection, leading
indicators generation, and tailoring policy responses to combat the pandemic in these regions.
Reopening of the economy can also be done in an informed manner rather than the current
trial-and-error approach that has led to recurring ebbs and flows of cases12.
Data infrastructure interventions:
Here we approach the fundamental tension that has plagued the current technological
deployment of solutions to combat COVID-19: privacy intrusions due to an expansion of
surveillance infrastructure, whether benign13 or one with ulterior motives14. There are three
measures that can be adopted to mitigate these concerns: transparency in the design,
development, and deployment of contact-tracing and other technologies, use of
privacy-preserving technologies like differential privacy (DP)15 as opposed to ad-hoc
anonymization and other unproven methods, and proactive and premeditated data trusts run by
communities themselves.
Transparency
Adopting transparent design, development, and deployment of digital contact-tracing has been
shown to be better received than taking a closed-door approach as seen in the face-off between
PEPP-PT16 and DP-3T17 protocols in Europe. The Apple-Google toolkit when adopted by

governments18 has also shown to be more effective in part (though potentially confounded by
higher interoperability and ease of use) because of the technical standards19 and considerations
being made public ahead of time. When the design choices are made public ahead of time,
iterated open under public scrutiny, and have a tracked version history (via a service like
Github) as was used by DP-3T20, it engenders more trust from users and increases the adoption
of the technology bolstering its efficacy.
Privacy-preserving techniques
Time21 and again22, it has been demonstrated that ad-hoc anonymization doesn’t offer the most
robust guarantees in terms of personal data protection. Yet, it is the dominant technique
mentioned whenever discussions on privacy arise. Whether in popular media or in
policy-makers’ offices, a more thorough understanding of techniques like DP, which is able to
provide mathematically verifiable bounds23 on the protection of personal data, will be essential.
More so, practical and ​highly public d
​ emonstrations using DP, for example the push from the
US Census in 202024, will showcase that it is not a theoretical construct and can be scaled to a
national level. Additionally, aligning language in privacy legislations and regulations that are
closer to how such techniques might be realized in practice25 will help to strengthen the case for
adoption of these industry best practices.
Data trusts
Ad-hoc creation of data trusts tends to create discord and distrust in the communities that these
solutions are meant to serve26. A
​ priori ​creation of stewardship mechanisms for
community-collected data is essential. Such an approach also creates a transparent ​contract
between those who are tasked with managing the data and the data subjects. It also affords the

opportunity for engaged discussion arriving at agreements that are aligned with the values
upheld by the communities27.
Organizational infrastructure interventions:
The creation of well-established playbooks and organizational measures such as dedicated
bodies and committees that are composed of the necessary experts who have a long history of
engagement on the technical, scientific, and social aspects of pandemic management helps to
bake-in i​ ntelligence into the process through continual learning and iteration, something that is
proving to be challenging as ad-hoc measures are springing up across the world28. Unaware of
the work being done by others, and duplicating research29 and creating best practices from
scratch has led to uneven responses30. In a pandemic, such responses are particularly harmful
since they limit the effectiveness of the measures undertaken by everyone else.
Future Directions:
Ultimately, embodying this ​Gray Rhino m
​ indset has the benefit of ushering in an era of
pandemic preparedness that taps into the best practices across digital, data, and organizational
infrastructure that shifts the paradigm from being reactive to proactive. It is also centered on
capacity building in a deliberate and continual manner to reduce uncertainty and the severity of
negative consequences when a pandemic strikes. Respecting ethical considerations including
privacy, data rights, context, and non-discrimination through the empowerment of people who
are disproportionately affected by pandemics will help us utilize technology that truly does
benefit everyone.
