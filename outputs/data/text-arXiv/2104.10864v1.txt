Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic has been damaging to the lives of people all around the world.
Accompanied by the pandemic is an infodemic, an abundant and uncontrolled spreading
of potentially harmful misinformation. The infodemic may severely change the
pandemic’s course by interfering with public health interventions such as wearing masks,
social distancing, and vaccination. In particular, the impact of the infodemic on
vaccination is critical because it holds the key to reverting to pre-pandemic normalcy.
This paper presents findings from a global survey on the extent of worldwide exposure
to the COVID-19 infodemic, assesses different populations’ susceptibility to false claims,
and analyzes its association with vaccine acceptance. Based on responses gathered from
over 18,400 individuals from 40 countries, we find a strong association between
perceived believability of misinformation and vaccination hesitancy. Additionally, our
study shows that only half of the online users exposed to rumors might have seen the
fact-checked information. Moreover, depending on the country, between 6% and 37% of
individuals considered these rumors believable. Our survey also shows that poorer
regions are more susceptible to encountering and believing COVID-19 misinformation.
We discuss implications of our findings on public campaigns that proactively spread
accurate information to countries that are more susceptible to the infodemic. We also
highlight fact-checking platforms’ role in better identifying and prioritizing claims that
are perceived to be believable and have wide exposure. Our findings give insights into
better handling of risk communication during the initial phase of a future pandemic.

Introduction
In the contemporary world with social media, misinformation and disinformation can be
rapidly disseminated to millions of people [1, 2]. Studies suggest that harmful false
information spreads more broadly than the truth online [3]. Due to social media’s global
reach with a rapid amplification mechanism [4], information can quickly inundate the
Internet and get reinforced, potentially creating an “infodemic” [5, 6]. This abundance
of information can lead to harmful consequences. For instance, the COVID-19 infodemic
has resulted in seemingly harmless acts such as eating vegetables, shaving one’s head, or
saltwater gargling [7] to norm-violating and damaging acts like arson [8].
Previous work addressing misinformation in healthcare has found that false and
misleading claims negatively influence people’s attitudes towards vaccine acceptance.
One study conducted in the Democratic Republic of the Congo during the Ebola
epidemic found an adverse effect of false information on vaccine acceptance [9]. The
World Health Organization (WHO) has highlighted how misinformation has raised
doubts on the effectiveness of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines [10]. Furthermore,
vaccine refusal has led to the measles’ resurgence in the US, even after decades of
containment [11]. Research has proven that vaccines do save lives [12]. In the context of
the coronavirus pandemic, a vaccine is widely believed to be the only way out towards
pre-pandemic normalcy [13].
Due to the Internet’s nature, it is challenging to prevent the spread of false
information [14]. There is no established authority that checks the veracity of the
information that is shared. Moreover, social media can quickly spread a piece of
information to large groups of people, independently of its source and authenticity.
Misinformation, disinformation, and eccentric opinions can get reinforced by repeated
exposure and threaten public health. As a result, communicating even the most basic
facts to the public can become a challenge in itself.

A possible remedy to the harm caused by an infodemic is flagging and removing
false information from the Internet and social media. Extensive research has focused on
automating this process [15, 16], and recently, social media platforms have taken both
proactive and reactive steps to prevent and minimize the spread of

misinformation [17, 18].
Proactive dissemination of fact-checked information preempting the spread of the
infodemic is another way to combat misinformation. Working on these lines, we had
launched an online campaign to debunk COVID-19 rumors [19] that disseminated
accurate coronavirus-related information reaching over 50,000 individuals. The
campaign aimed to collect fact-checked information from regions that had already
suffered from the infodemic and spread them to other regions where the infodemic was
at its infancy.
Many studies have addressed the pressing issue of of COVID-19 infodemic [20–23].
These studies target the problem either from a computational or exploratory perspective.
In this work, we deploy a descriptive survey based approach to analyze the prevalence of
infodemic. We utilize the data gathered from our public campaign and study the public
susceptibility to the infodemic by analyzing the individual survey responses. Through a
global-scale survey conducted using the Facebook Advertisement Platform, we utilize
18,407 complete responses from individuals in 40 countries (see Fig 1) and measured the
extent to which a wide range of coronavirus-related rumors and their respective
fact-checks reached different countries. We also examined the impact of exposure to
misinformation on attitudes towards rumor believability and vaccine acceptance.
We find that distinct claims disseminate differently around the world,
disproportionately affecting less economically developed countries. Our results also
indicate that exposure to false information is nearly two times more prevalent than that
of corresponding fact-checked information, indicating that half of the online users
exposed to rumors might not have encountered the corresponding fact-checks.
When jointly considering believability, the picture becomes more complicated.
Although some claims—such as those 5G-related ones—exhibit inherently low
believability, we find that they spread widely. Other popular claims, e.g., regarding the
use of existing drugs, have relatively high believability. This finding implies that
fact-checking organizations could utilize user response or quick polls to identify claims
that are more likely to be widely believed. Such a prioritization strategy could be
helpful given the limited resources at fact-checking systems.
Our study reflects a positive association between exposure and both believability
and vaccination hesitancy. The results also show that those who perceive the pandemic
as more threatening are more willing to accept a future vaccine, highlighting the
importance of raising public awareness concerning the disease’s risks. Our regression
analysis suggests that exposure to fact-checks could nearly balance out the adverse
effect of exposure to misinformation. This remedy, however, doesn’t seem to be effective
for individuals who report being susceptible to false information; to what extent
participants found claims believable was much more strongly associated with vaccine
hesitancy.
Given the rising social media usage, including in the developing and underdeveloped
regions, social media platforms could be used as a primary medium for disseminating
fact-checks. We propose one algorithmic prioritization method for future debunking
strategies that account for the varying degrees of believability and exposure of claims.
This work demonstrates how web data can be analyzed to understand important health
implications during a global pandemic. We describe our methodology for conducting
surveys over a social media platform and post-processing the data to correct for
sampling demographic biases.

Materials and Methods
COVID-19 Claims Selection
For identifying popular false claims, we collected over 200 COVID-19 rumors from
DXY.cn, a Chinese online community for physicians and healthcare professionals, on
March 18, 2020. This site hosted a comprehensive list of Chinese social media rumors
during the COVID-19 infancy in China. Many of them were later found to have spread
worldwide. After removing redundant content and lockdown-related claims, we
investigated 30 pieces of misinformation addressing health-related behaviors. We
combined these pieces into 11 distinct claims (e.g., combining the effect of multiple
different rumors into a single claim). We also categorized claims into subgroups
depending on the rumor’ nature (e.g., those addressing vaccination or do it yourself
(DIY) measures). Corroborating these claims with fact-checked information from
credible sources, including the World Health Organization (WHO) ’s Mythbusters [24]
and the International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN) ’s #CoronaVirusFacts Alliance
database [25], we arrived at the following list of 11 misinformation claims:
1. 5G (5G): 5G networks can contribute the spreading of the coronavirus.
2. Dryer (Hot&Co): Hot-air dryers can kill the coronavirus.
3. Gargling (DIY): Gargling with salt water can prevent coronavirus infection.
4. Drugs (DIY): Existing drugs for malaria and HIV can help treat COVID-19.
5. Pharma (Vaccination): Pharmaceutical companies are spreading COVID-19 so
they can profit from its vaccine.
6. Population (Vaccination): The COVID-19 vaccines currently being developed are
forms of population control.
7. Sunbath (Hot&Co): Standing in the sun can kill the coronavirus.
8. Tracking (Vaccination): The COVID-19 vaccine is being developed to implant
people with tracking microchips.
9. Vinegar(DIY): Apple cider vinegar can kill the coronavirus in the throat.
10. Water (DIY): Drinking water every 15 minutes will prevent getting infected with
the coronavirus.
11. Weather (Hot&Co): The coronavirus will only spread in cold, dry weather and
does not survive in hot, humid weather.
Our survey and claims were translated into English, French, Spanish, Portuguese,
and Arabic. For French and Spanish, we first used Google Translate to obtain crude
translations and then used the Prolific crowdsourcing platform [26] to recruit native
speakers from these languages (minimum 18 each) to refine the translations. Recruited
participants attended a short survey in which they were asked to refine the provided
translations. This procedure was repeated three times for each language in an iterative
manner. The translations were done entirely by volunteering native speakers from the
second author’s institution for Portuguese and Arabic.

Survey Design
This study had been approved by the Institutional Review Board at the corresponding
author’s institution (KAIST IRB-20-229) and was performed in accordance with the
relevant guidelines and regulations. Informed consent was obtained from all study
participants. Participants were asked their current residence country and their level of
worry regarding the pandemic using a 5-pt Likert Scale. Our survey was designed to
address four different aspects of the coronavirus infodemic to the public: i ) exposure to
misinformation, ii ) exposure to fact-checks, iii ) perception of claim believability, and iv )
perception of how beneficial fact-checks could be to one’s community. The following
questions were presented in random order to the survey participants for each of the
claims:
1. Exposure: Have you seen or heard this information in the last month?
Yes, Partly, No, I don’t remember)

(Answer:

2. Fact-Checks: Have you ever seen an official source confirming or denying the
claim above? (Answer: Yes, No, I don’t remember)
3. Believability: How believable does the information above seem to you? (Answer:
Not believable at all, Not really believable, I am not sure, Somewhat believable,
Very believable)
4. Benefit: To what extent would your community benefit from seeing a
fact-checking result of the claim above? (Answer: Not at all, A little,
Moderately, A lot)
Participants were not explicitly asked whether they believed the study’s rumors to
avoid potential social desirability biases. Respondents might have answered that they
did not believe the claims so that they would be seen more favorably. Hence, we
phrased our questions such that they were asked to what extent they found the rumors
to be believable. At the end of the survey, respondents were also asked demographic
questions and to what extent they perceived the novel coronavirus as a threat, which
was measured via a threat scale introduced in [27] (termed perceived threat).

Data Collection
We conducted a large-scale online survey using the Facebook Advertising Platform from
June 18 to July 13, 2020. The survey was designed in the SurveyMonkey platform, and
the link to the survey was made available via advertisements on Facebook. As of March
2020, Facebook had 2.60 billion monthly active users and 1.73 billion daily active
users [28], making it the largest social media platform. Some recent publications [29, 30]
have explored Facebook’s usage as a survey platform and noted its advantages of a deep
and broad reach, rapid data collection, granular targeting, and cost-effectiveness. The
Facebook Advertising Platform allows targeting based on age, location, spoken
language, and interests. Sample biases can be dealt with the adequate application of
post-stratification weighting techniques, although studies such as [31] show that the
demographic distributions of Facebook users tend to not differ hugely from census
distributions.
To obtain a large and more representative sample of every country, we designed
independent Facebook campaigns for the target countries. Each campaign was further
divided into four advertisement sets by age groups (18-24, 25-44, 45-64, and 65+ years).
The English survey was run from June 18 to June 25, the Portuguese, Spanish and
French surveys were conducted from June 22 to June 28, while the Arabic survey was
run from July 7 to July 13.

To control for demographic factors, we ensure a minimum sample of 100 responses
from each country. For countries with less than 30 complete responses from the initial
round, the survey was rerun from July 7 to July 13. Since the respondents were
recruited through the Facebook Advertising Platform, they did not receive any financial
benefit from participating in the survey. Therefore, participation is voluntary, and
respondents could choose to withdraw from the survey at any time.
We obtained 1,946,516 responses (N =44,239) from Facebook users who have seen
and clicked on our advertisement. We discarded incomplete responses and participants
with duplicated IP addresses. Due to our weighted analysis, which requires each
participant to report their sex, age, and country of residence, we discarded responses
from participants who chose not to reveal their sex. We allowed participants to report
their sex as “other.” To weigh responses successfully, we solely kept participants from
those countries with at least 30 complete responses. Our final dataset consisted of
805,816 complete responses (N =18,314) from 40 countries (see Fig. 1). Our sample
covers all continents and contains a median of 464 respondents per country.
Demographic information regarding all participants is presented in SI Table S1.

Sample and Weighting
Recruiting participants through the Facebook Advertising Platform allowed us to reach
a larger and more representative pool of respondents than otherwise possible through
crowdsourcing platforms. Nevertheless, Facebook users are still not demographically
representative of countries’ populations. For instance, although previous work has found
a high correlation between the US Census and Facebook users, the latter was composed
of younger and more educated people [31].
To compensate for any imbalance between our sample and the general population
demographic distributions, we employed raking as a post-stratified weighting technique
that assigns a weight to each response according to its respondent’s demographics.
Raking is an iterative method that calculates weights for each joint demographic group
concerning separate demographic distributions until convergence [32]. These weights
can be used to estimate a population’s information more accurately given a
non-representative sample. Previous research has shown that Facebook user
demographics are comparable to gold-standard surveys and the differences can be dealt
with by appropriate weighing techniques [33].
After obtaining estimates of each country’s age and sex distributions from the
United Nation’s 2019 World Population Prospects dataset, we used raking for
calculating each response’s weight. This technique was employed for each country,
resulting in weights for each sex, age group, and country triple in our dataset. As the
UN provides information about age distributions in 5-year intervals, we used the 20-24
bracket corresponding to our 18-24 age group for weighting purposes. Unless stated
otherwise, we present weighted results from our analysis.
Figure 2 exemplifies the weighing process. The left plot shows our sample’s age
distribution from Brazilian survey respondents from Facebook alongside the true
Brazilian population’s age distribution. By comparing the two, it is possible to note that
the survey sample is younger than the real population. Weighting techniques like raking
compensate for this discrepancy and help obtain a more accurate population-level
estimation [32]. The right plot in Figure 2 shows how weighting adjusted the sample’s
estimates for the case of exposure to the 5G rumor. Some age groups exhibit
statistically significant differences between the weighted and unweighted estimates.

exposure rates to the 5G claim. Error bars are standard errors.

Regression Models
This work presents three different regression models, all of which consider reported
demographics features and the respondents’ mean perceived threat as control variables.
Demographic features in this study are reported age group, sex, education, health, and
financial status. Except for sex and vaccination history-related dummies, all variables
are treated as continuous or counts. Independent variables correspond to exposure to
misinformation, and the respective fact-check counts for Model 1, and additionally,
average believability for models 2 and 3. We add interaction terms for vaccination
history (as history for a non-mandatory vaccine implies past vaccination) as well for
exposure to claims and their respective fact-checks (to be exposed to a fact-checked also
implies that one has been exposed to the claim, even if only at the time of debunking).
Table 3 presents how variables were coded in all models.
Model 1 is a linear regression predicting the average reported believability of false
claims. It is of the form Equation 1

where Y is the mean believability, α is the intercept term, and βi , βg , βk are coefficients
for control variables Ci , independent variables Ig , and interaction terms Tk respectively.
Model 2 and 3 are logistic regression models predicting the dichotomized responses
to the COVID-19 vaccine acceptance question (with the third option “I don’t know”
treated as a negative response). In order to segregate and identify the association of
different categories of claims on the vaccination acceptance, we divide the claims into
four groups in Model 3: DIY, Hot&Co, vaccination conspiracies, and the 5G-related
claim. For Model 3, the independent variables are distinct exposure and fact-check
counts and the mean believability of the segregated groups, whereas, for Model 2, we
aggregate these variables across all claims. Also, we utilize respondents’ vaccine history
as another control variable alongside the respondent’s perceived threat. Model 2 and 3
are of the form Equation 2

respectively. We also run the same models with country-level random effects, with lasso
and elastic regularization and present the results in the SI Tables S3 - S14.

Results
Exposure to Rumors
Figure 3 shows to what extent different countries have been exposed to COVID-19
misinformation and their respective fact-checks. The countries presented in the figure
were selected to cover different regions of the world and varying exposure levels to the
claims. We also show the overall weighted average across all 40 countries. All others
countries are presented in SI Fig S1.
When we examine the overall exposure, we note that some claims have exceptionally
high public appeal. Drugs and Weather are the two most popular claims in our data,
with an average of 84.2% and 77.1% of participants encountering these rumors,
respectively. Vaccination-related claims show moderate-to-high exposure with Tracking
seen by 60.7%, Population by 57.6% and Pharma by 55.7% of the respondents. The
smallest portion of respondents were exposed to do-it-yourself (DIY) rumors on
preventive measures with Sunbath seen by 54.7%, Water by 44.3%, Vinegar by 34.9%,
and Dryer by 27.4% of the respondents.
Next, we investigated the COVID-19 infodemic reach across different geographical
regions by comparing the pink polygons in the figure representing the extent to which a
country has been exposed to the infodemic rumors. Countries in the same region are
exposed to a similar extent to the rumors (exemplified by a similar shape of the polygon
for the Middle Eastern countries of Saudi Arabia and Iraq, or the European nations of
the UK, Spain, and Sweden). At the same time, there is a noticeable variance in the
infodemic’s reach across continents.
Moreover, the selected claims demonstrate varying levels of exposure in different
countries. Some rumors are regionally concentrated. For instance, Gargling was widely
disseminated in Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Nicaragua (i.e., above 90%), with markedly low
exposure in the UK, Spain and Sweden (i.e., 40% or less). Similarly, 5G was seen widely
in Papua New Guinea, Spain, and the UK, but less in other regions. On the other hand,
rumors regarding Drugs, Weather, and vaccine-related claims (Tracking, Population, and
Pharma) spread globally and received significant exposure across countries.

Exposure to Fact-Checks
The inner purple polygons in Figure 3 show the extent to which participants were
exposed to fact-checks for each claim covered by our study. Our results reveal that
48.6% of participants were exposed to fact-checks on the Drugs rumor, which had spread
the highest. The second most popular claim, Weather, was also the second most
fact-checked claim, with 40.3% of respondents seeing an official source confirming or
denying it. Fact-checks for all other claims have been seen by no more than 25% of
respondents on average.
Our results exhibit that fact-checks do not spread at the same rate as the rumors
themselves. On average, fewer than half the respondents who have seen rumors have
encountered the corresponding fact-checks, as demonstrated by the difference in areas of
pink and purple regions in Figure 3. Given that we opt to choose the prevalent rumors
on social media, we highlight that only less than half of the people saw the
corresponding fact-checked information is quite alarming. Finally, we investigated the
relationship between the perceived benefit of sharing fact-checks and exposure to
fact-checks. Our results suggest that respondents perceive fact-checks to be more
beneficial to their community if they address less commonly seen rumors (Spearman’s
ρ=-0.745, 95% CI -0.972 – -0.120).

The Most Vulnerable Regions
We observed that Figure 3 seems to suggest a relationship between the infodemic’s
reach and a country’s economic development; developed countries (e.g., Sweden, Spain)
appear to have been less exposed to the infodemic than the underdeveloped or

developing countries (e.g., Iraq, Nicaragua). Figure 4 shows the level of exposure to
each of the eleven rumors by country while ordering countries by their GDP per capita
on the x-axis. The choice of GDP per capita is motivated by the fact that it is the most
widely used comparative economic indicator. We also assume it as a proxy for health
indicators and healthcare infrastructure.
Our results indicate that the 5G claim was seen more widely in developed countries
than in other regions (ρ=0.515, 95% CI 0.248 – 0.779). On the other hand,
vaccination-related — Pharmacy, Population, and Tracking — and the Drugs claims show
no significant difference in exposure between developed and underdeveloped countries.
For the remaining claims, we observe a downward trend (i.e., negative correlation),
suggesting that disadvantaged nations are more vulnerable to the infodemic. These
claims include Weather (ρ=-0.676, 95% CI -0.863 – -0.485) and DIY measures such as
Vinegar (ρ=-0.466, 95% CI -0.777 – -0.153), Sunbath (ρ=-0.532, 95% CI -0.753 – -0.309),
Gargling (ρ=-0.463, 95% CI -0.786 – -0.136), Water (ρ=-0.700, 95% CI -0.905 – -0.491),
and Dryer (ρ=-0.347, 95% CI -0.658 – -0.035).

Believability of Rumors
As a measure of people’s perception of these claims, we asked survey respondents to
indicate the extent to which they found each claim to be “believable” on a 5-point
Likert scale. The responses ranged from ‘Not believable at all’ (score of -2) to ‘Very
believable’ (score of 2).
The only claim perceived to be somewhat believable was the Drugs rumor, with a
weighted mean value of 0.190 (i.e., borderline believable). All other claims reported a
low mean believability (below -0.5), with the 5G claim being the least believable claim
with a mean value of -1.307.
To understand what fraction of respondents from each country might be susceptible

April 23, 2021

to believing in misinformation, we dichotomized the reported believability values into
positive (i.e., susceptible to believing in a rumor) and negative (i.e., not susceptible).
On average, we observe that 22% of respondents per country are predisposed to
believing in rumors. We note the highest misinformation believability (more than 31%)
in Yemen, Algeria, Saudi Arabia, and Tunisia. Swedish and Finnish people seem the
least susceptible to the infodemic, with a mere 7.4% of respondents reporting that
rumors are believable.
After determining a country’s weighted average for each claim, we calculated a
nation’s believability z-score. In Figure 5, we present every country’s perceived
believability (with the countries ranked in increasing order of their GDP per capita) for
each rumor. A positive value suggests that a country’s population finds a specific claim
more believable than an average community, i.e., is more susceptible to believing in it.
A visual inspection of Figure 5 reveals that the most economically developed
countries covered by our study show the lowest rates of believability across claims.
Conversely, the lower half of the nations ranked by GDP per capita appear to have the
highest believability values. These findings suggest that misinformation is likely to be
perceived as more believable in economically vulnerable countries.

Misinformation and Vaccine Acceptance
After quantifying public exposure to misinformation, we assessed the perceived
believability of each rumor (termed believability hereafter) and its relationship to
willingness to get vaccinated (termed vaccine acceptance). Our primary goal was to
examine whether extensive exposure to misinformation increases rumor believability and
whether such reinforcement further leads to vaccine hesitancy (i.e., a decrease in vaccine
acceptance).
We analyzed the survey responses through three different regression models (see SI
for details). The first model (Model 1) predicts average believability based on one’s
exposure to misinformation and its corresponding fact-checks. The next two models
examine which specific aspects of infodemic are associated with changes in attitudes
towards COVID-19 vaccination. For Model 2, we aggregate responses across all claims,
while for Model 3, we cluster them into different groups: i) DIY measures, ii)
temperature-related (termed Hot&Co), iii) vaccination conspiracies, and iv) 5G
conspiracy. The rationale behind this grouping is to test the influence of distinct
notions of misinformation and behavioral measures on vaccine acceptance. Finally, all
the presented models control for demographic features and consider other survey
responses as independent variables. Table 1 reports, for each model, the average
marginal effects (M). The regression coefficients are reported in SI Table S3 - S14 for
fixed-, mixed-effects, lasso and elastic net models. All models show similar results.
For Model 1, we find that exposure to misinformation is positively correlated with
overall claim believability (M=0.098, 95% CI 0.093 – 0.103). A higher perceived threat
concerning the pandemic is also associated with higher believability (M=0.114, 95% CI
0.095 – 0.133). Our findings indicate a weak effect of exposure to fact-checks in
believability (M=–0.010, 95% CI -0.015 – -0.004).
Model 2 results, in which claims are not grouped, show that mere exposure to
misinformation is not strongly associated with vaccination willingness (M=–0.004, 95%
CI -0.007 – -0.001). However, the perceived believability of false information is
associated with vaccine refusal (M=-0.128, 95% CI -0.137 – -0.119). Although
statistically significant, the marginal effect size of overall past-vaccination history is
negligibly small, while those who had received a non-mandatory vaccine in the past also
report higher vaccine acceptance (M=0.184, 95% 0.170 – 0.199), as those who perceive
the pandemic as more threatening (M=0.166, 95% CI 0.155 – 0.177).

Our final logistic regression model (Model 3), which groups related claims into
distinct types, indicates that increased exposure to vaccine-related misinformation is
directly associated with an increased level of vaccination hesitancy (M=-0.035, 95% CI
-0.042 – 0.027). A more substantial association is seen for the reported believability of
false vaccination-related claims (M=-0.120, 95% CI -0.128 – -0.113). Our results also
show that increased exposure to fact-checked vaccination-related information is
correlated with increased vaccine acceptance (M=0.032, 95% CI 0.018 – 0.045).
Aside from the vaccination-related claims, our results suggest that exposure,
believability, and fact-checking of other types of misinformation are not strongly
associated with vaccine acceptance (see Table 1). Additionally, following our Model 2
results, respondents who feel more threatened by the pandemic are more likely to get
vaccinated (M=0.147, 95% CI 0.135 – 0.158). People with previous experience with
non-mandatory vaccines also report higher vaccine acceptance (M=0.171, 95% CI 0.157 –
0.185), whereas general past vaccination has no statistically significant effect. The
relative marginal effects for Model 3 can be visualized in Figure 6.

Discussion
Using Social Media as a Survey Platform
In the present study, we used the Facebook Advertisement Platform as a recruitment
platform for conducting our survey and obtained responses from over 18,000
respondents worldwide. We described our method for collecting demographically diverse
survey responses via targeted advertisements for different locations and varying age
groups. We also employed a post-stratification weighting scheme (i.e., raking) to correct
survey results for non-response and non-coverage. The broad and deep reach of social
media and the weighting technique helped us better estimate the infodemic’s worldwide
reach compared to other commonly used crowdsourcing platforms.
Additionally, the Facebook Advertisement Platform also is a financially viable choice
for conducting global-scale surveys. Our survey, reaching over 50,000 people with 18,407
complete responses, cost US$8,550. Assuming an identical setting (e.g., a median of 11
minutes to complete the survey), a survey of the same scale could have cost over five
times, e.g., US$43,741 on Prolific [26] or US$45,870 on Amazon Mechanical Turk [34].
Moreover, the demographic reach would be significantly lower with participants mainly
from selected regions, e.g., Amazon Mechanical Turk’s user base predominantly
comprises the US and Indian residents [35], and Prolific’s workers reside in OECD
countries. We believe the economic viability and broad geographic reach make social
media advertising platforms a feasible survey tool for researchers and practitioners.

Treatment of Local Versus Global Rumors
Another finding of this paper was the uneven spread of rumors across geographic regions
(see Fig. 3). For instance, the top-2 rumors, i.e., Drugs and Weather reached nearly
three-fourth of all respondents globally. Besides an inherent appeal of these claims, they
might have spread more widely for political reasons. Public figures worldwide
downplayed the virus’ impact by stating that it would disappear as temperatures
started rising [36]. The potential use of existing drugs like hydroxychloroquine, a
malaria drug that has not shown any promising result [37], has been openly promoted
as a potential therapy [38, 39]. These findings exemplify the influence that local public
figures can exert on the general public’s information, as shown in a prior study on the
public narrative of Ibuprofen’s possible side-effects on coronavirus patients [40].
One of the localized rumors was that saltwater gargling prevents the coronavirus
infection (Gargling). This claim had exceptionally high exposure in the Middle East;
nearly 90% of respondents from Saudi Arabia and Iraq reported to have seen the claim
compared to only around 20% of respondents in Sweden and Finland. Although the
rumor’s premise may be harmless, this claim led to tens of infection in South Korea as
some churchgoers continued to congregate after spraying saltwater in each other’s
mouths [7]. There have been numerous cases where seemingly harmless misinformation
swayed people away from official guidelines (e.g., social distancing, washing hands with
soap). In addition to tackling globally popular misinformation, local governments could
work together with platforms to further debunk claims with a strong regional foothold.

Algorithmic Prioritization of Fact-Checks
When it comes to prioritizing claims to debunk first or deciding which fact-checks to
disseminate widely, fact-checking organizations need to consider the exposure and
believability of claims. A good example to discuss is 5G, which was seen by 60% of all
respondents, yet had low believability of, on average, 13%. This may indicate that

prioritization and (b) how currently practiced.

(b) Aggregate dissemination percentage of fact-checks.

relative to its wide dissemination, the potential harms may not be extensive given
people are not susceptible to believing it.
Based on rumor exposure, fact-check exposure, and believability, we propose a
heuristic algorithmic prioritization method to decide which fact-checks to disseminate
widely first. We propose an estimate of blind belief in a rumor as
(Rumor Exposure − Fact-Check Exposure) × (Believability)

(3)

Using the dichotomized value of believability, we can roughly estimate a proxy for how
many people may believe a specific claim. The same idea can be used in deciding which
claims to debunk first.
Figure 7(a) shows the estimated percentage of respondents that might believe each
claim after encountering it online without having seen a fact-check. Drugs exhibits the
highest value, followed by the three vaccination-related claims. Although Weather was
the second most seen claim, it is ranked sixth in the blind belief scale. Rumors
addressing DIY measures against the disease (e.g., Gargling, Sunbath) suggests that less
than 10% of the population might believe them without access to fact-checks. Likewise,
5G is ranked ninth, low if compared to its disproportionate large exposure.
In contrast, Figure 7(b) shows the popularity of fact-checks by the weighted
percentage of survey participants who have seen them. Note that Drugs is top-ranked as
in the algorithmic suggestion. However, our results suggest that the three
vaccination-related fact-checks, which the proposed algorithm recommends to be highly
prioritized, have not been widely popular in real campaigns. We also see relatively high
dissemination for Weather and Sunbath compared to their blind belief potential.
The observation above implies that fact-checking organizations and social media
platforms could use simple online tools to elicit users’ perceived believability and

April 23, 2021

15/35

identify which claims are more likely to be widely believed. A possibility would be
social media platforms presenting prompts to users inquiring whether they find claims
believable as soon as they are identified in online networks (e.g., by machine learning
methods or reporting functions). Efforts could prioritize those claims that are widely
shared and perceived to be believable. This prioritization could prove to be incredibly
helpful, considering limited manual fact-checking resources and the relative inaccuracy
of automated fact-checking models.

Underdeveloped Countries Are More Susceptible to the
Infodemic
Another finding of this study is that economically disadvantaged countries are exposed
more to the infodemic than richer nations. Moreover, respondents from nations with
lower GDP per capita generally are more susceptible to believing in misinformation
upon exposure. This finding is most prominent for claims that propose DIY preventive
measures, such as Gargling and Water. It can be linked to the literature which has found
that those more economically disadvantaged are more likely to have limited health
literacy [41, 42]. Users from these countries have limited access to healthcare [43, 44],
which might make them more receptive to non-conventional health behaviors.
Underdeveloped countries seem to be in higher distress during the pandemic [45],
mainly due to a lack of healthcare infrastructure and limited number of health
professionals [46]. The spread of the infodemic could increase the burden caused by
COVID-19 in these countries, as health information inequalities are known to widen
global health disparities [47].
A Pew Research Center study has found that social media use is continuously rising
in underdeveloped and developing countries [48]. This observation is two-fold. Although
people might be exposed to more misinformation as they go online, this also creates
opportunities for online dissemination of accurate and debunking information. Hence,
our finding underlines the importance of fact-checking platforms in propagating correct
information before rumors spread in vulnerable countries. Preparing reactive fact-checks
alone might not be enough if their spreading potential is smaller than rumors’ and if
rumors are considered believable. Social media platforms could be used to facilitate the
dissemination of such preemptive fact-checks.

Vaccination-Related Rumors Are Popular Worldwide
Vaccination-related claims show no significant difference in exposure between developed
and underdeveloped countries. More worryingly, our results suggest that these claims
are widely shared online, reporting up to 60% exposure across the countries covered by
our study. Our proposed estimate of public belief in rumors presents these claims as
prospects for high belief among the world population. This is a concern for global
health as research has found that information delivered through social media can cause
COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy [49].
Given the importance of vaccination in the control of the pandemic [13] and the
strong influence that anti-vaccination movements exert in online communities [50], we
highlight the importance of fighting this type of misinformation, particularly now that
coronavirus vaccines are being rolled out. Some online platforms have taken proactive
stances on this topic and banned misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines [51, 52]. Our
findings highlight the importance of these efforts, and we urge other social platforms to
adopt a similar stance on the topic.

Infodemic and Vaccine Hesitancy
Our analysis reveals that exposure to misinformation influences vaccination decisions.
Interestingly, false information’s perceived believability is a much more decisive factor in
vaccine acceptance than mere exposure. Susceptibility to believing in misinformation,
and consequent belief in an unconfirmed piece of information, could have critical
implications on public health behaviors. On the other hand, increased exposure to
fact-checked information is associated with a more positive attitude towards the
coronavirus vaccine. Although the adverse impact of perceived believability of
misinformation in vaccine acceptance is more pronounced than that of fact-checked
information, its positive effect highlights the importance of concerted efforts for
disseminating accurate and debunking information to the public.
As the claims addressed in this study cover various aspects of the infodemic, we also
studied whether different misinformation categories have varying effects on people’s
vaccination tendencies. Although increased exposure to vaccination-related false
information and associated believability negatively affects vaccine acceptance, our
results suggest marginally adverse or even positive effects for other types of
misinformation (see Fig 6).
These conflicting and marginal results indicate that misinformation not directly
addressing vaccination might not be associated with vaccine refusal. For instance, those
exposed to more DIY-related claims show higher rates of vaccine acceptance; people
adhering to various behavioral measures for their safety might also feel more threatened
about the coronavirus and thus may be more willing to accept a vaccine. Another
hypothesis is that people interested in personal health and well-being, i.e., arguably
more likely to have seen DIY rumors, are active followers of coronavirus-related
information to protect themselves from infection. The opposite effect was observed for
the 5G rumor; people who have seen this conspiracy theory might also have been
exposed to vaccination-related conspiracies [53] and hence show higher vaccine refusal
rates.

Conclusion
To understand how the COVID-19 infodemic has affected different countries worldwide,
we conducted a large-scale survey to quantify public exposure to a wide range of
coronavirus-related misinformation and fact-checks. Additionally, we assessed the extent
to which people’s belief in misinformation negatively influences their acceptance of the
coronavirus vaccine. All forty countries examined showed extensively higher exposure to
rumors than to their respective fact-checks. Most importantly, our findings indicate that
the infodemic could disproportionately hit economically disadvantaged countries the
hardest. These vulnerable countries have higher rates of exposure to coronavirus-related
rumors and found claims more believable than developed nations’ residents.
Our study indicates that misinformation, particularly to what extent people are
open to believing in it, negatively influences their acceptance of the coronavirus vaccine.
A more fine-grained analysis revealed how vaccination-related claims could contribute to
vaccination hesitancy, while other false information does not seem to influence these
decisions. Worryingly, our findings indicate that the positive effect of fact-checks on
vaccine acceptance is less pronounced than the extent to which the population is
susceptible to believing in misinformation.
There are however, several limittaions that might be associated with this work.
Although we have designed our study to cover a wide range of coronavirus-related
misinformation topics, our list is not comprehensive of the whole infodemic. Future work
should address a more extensive list of rumors which were not covered in the current

study. We have also conducted our study in a month-long time window. The infodemic
is under constant mutation, and future studies should also address the temporal aspect
of misinformation. This also means that in retrospect, the ever-evolving nature of
pandemic and the associated infodemic might also introduce some asymmetries in the
survey design. Although we have adopted post-stratification methods to compensate for
non-respondents and non-coverage, our results might not be generalizable to those
countries with smaller sample sizes. Additionally, our weighting technique, i.e., raking,
might be associated with issues like non-converge under some conditions [54, 55].
We recruited our respondents through social media to cover a wide range of
respondents from different world regions and adopted weighting methods to compensate
for non-respondents, but our results are not strictly representative of the world
population. For instance, we have focused our efforts on economically undeveloped
countries (e.g., in Africa), as previous work indicates that developing countries are more
vulnerable to communicable diseases [56]. Hence, our respondents do not cover the
majority of other countries. Facebook users could also be more susceptible to being
exposed to rumors, as false information is rapidly disseminated online. Moreover, we
maximized the reach of our survey by translating it into some of the most widely spoken
languages, but we did not cover Chinese, Indic, and Slavic languages.
Our results are based on self-reported values, which could be influenced by social
desirability biases [57]. An influencing factor could also be the terminology used in the
survey. For future work, it could be mitigated by a more careful survey design and the
use of clearer phrasing. Nevertheless, the association between perceived believability
(particularly of vaccine-related rumors) and vaccine hesitancy is highly significant across
a wide range of models. Additionally, we underline that previous studies have not
observed social desirability biases in estimates of compliance with COVID-19
regulations [58]. Hence, our main findings associating rumor exposure and believability
with vaccine hesitancy should be consistent with Facebook users’ views.
It is also important to consider a possible limitation concerning self-selection biases;
participants who chose to take part in the study by clicking on its advertisement might
have been particularly interested in the pandemic. Nevertheless, we highlight that
previous studies have found no major bias in Facebook samples compared to
traditionally administered surveys [59], particularly if correction factors, such as
post-stratification weights, are used [31].
The fact that we quantified infodemic spread and its association with vaccine
hesitancy at a global scale makes our work truly unique. We present our analysis with
individual responses from 40 countries of world, covering the continents of Asia, Africa,
Europe, and the Americas, with translations in widely spoken local languages. This
work is also a distinction from published research on the matter that is largely
Anglo-centric.
We defended a proactive stance in disseminating accurate information, flagging
suspicious content before rumors are widely spread and believed. We also highlighted
the importance of local efforts in fighting the infodemic as claims might be constrained
to specific regions. Given the importance of perceived believability in overall belief in
claims regardless of their reach, we discussed how social media platforms could elicit
users’ perceived believability of rumors to prioritize which misinformation should be
quickly addressed. In addition, we proposed a heuristic prioritization method based on
the reach of rumors, fact-checks, and perceived believability to assist decisions of which
rumors to prioritize in the fight against the infodemic.
Finally, our findings suggest that accurate information promulgating public
awareness about the disease’s risks and side effects is important for widespread vaccine
acceptance. We underlined the importance of debunking falsehoods and spreading
truths about vaccination given the public susceptibility to and widespread reach of

April 23, 2021

vaccination-related rumors, particularly once coronavirus vaccines are distributed
worldwide. Additionally, our study indicates that economically vulnerable countries are
more susceptible to infodemic. Considering these nations’ more precarious healthcare
infrastructure, we propose that public organizations and social media platforms
prioritize underdeveloped and developing countries to fight against misinformation.
Social media is continuously growing in these nations, and platforms should play a key
role in suppressing rumors and disseminating facts. We hope findings from this work
contribute to public and policy decisions and enable the authorities and the stakeholders
to be better equipped for responding better to future misinformation spreading.

Fig 8. Country-level exposure to misinformation (pink) and fact-checks (purple) (S1 Fig.)
The plot indicates the percentage of participants who have seen each claim and its corresponding fact-check in a specific
country covered by our study. The numbers are calculated after post-stratification weighting by the process of raking. The
radial axis represents the percentages ranging from 0 to 100. In the angular axis, distinct claims representing similar notions,
i.e., vaccination-related claims, are arranged together. The titles of the plots are each country’s ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 codes.
