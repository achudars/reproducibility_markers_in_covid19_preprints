Abstract
We present Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) statistics in China
dataset: daily statistics of the COVID-19 outbreak in China at the city/county level [1]. For each city/country, we include the six most important
numbers for epidemic research: daily new infections, accumulated infections, daily new recoveries, accumulated recoveries, daily new deaths, and
accumulated deaths. We cross validate the dataset and the estimate error
rate is about 0.04%. We then give several examples to show how to trace
the spreading in particular cities or provinces, and also contrast the development of COVID-19 in all cities in China at the early, middle and late
stages. We hope this dataset can help researchers around the world better
understand the spreading dynamics of COVID-19 at a regional level, to
inform intervention and mitigation strategies for policymakers.

Background & Summary
Starting in East Asia at the beginning of 2020, COVID-19 is by now a global
pandemic. At the time of writing there are more than 392,000 confirmed cases
in more than 190 territories with no sign of slowing down. To meet this great
healthcare challenge of our time, we need to combine efforts from the medical, pharmaceutical, epidemiological, transport, and even political realms [2, 3].
Thus far scientific efforts made to understand how COVID-19 spreads, are
mainly based on numbers from China at the province level. As the situation improves in China, we can derive a more complete and detailed picture
of COVID-19 spreading in the territory. This picture can help other countries
develop their own strategies to combat the coronavirus. At the time of writing,
there are several datesets on the spread of COVID-19. One of the most popular
dataset is maintained by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering in

John Hopkins University [4] and others derived from this [5]. These datasets
are mainly at the country or province level. However, for advanced modeling
and prediction, data at a smaller scale, i.e. the city level is necessary. Unfortunately, there is no high-quality publicly-available datasets at the city level and
covering a whole region to the best of our knowledge, which scientists from all
over the world can use. In reality, Chinese authorities announce the ongoing situation daily after 20 Jan 2020, although (1) cities and provinces put their daily
reports only in their own homepages and in different formats, and (2) most of
these reports are in Chinese. It is therefore difficult for scientists who cannot
read Chinese to do any research based on these reports. For our own research,
and also to make the data more widely accessible, we collected all daily reports
available from the official websites, extracted the data and organized them in
several .csv files. Researchers can then use their favorite tools to analyze the
data, and it is our hope that this dataset can help people understand and fight
COVID-19 better.

Methods
At the end of 2019, the novel coronavirus was first discovered in Wuhan City,
Hubei Province, China. Since then, the viral infection spread out to nearby
provinces and eventually to the whole of China. Starting from 21 Jan 2020,
provincial authorities have decided to release new and accumulated infected
cases, newly recovered and accumulated recovered cases, death tolls, and other
information to the public daily. This information is published on the official
Health Commission websites of each province once or twice a day (for some rare
cases, we also found them reporting three to four times a day) depending on
whether the infection situation is changing rapidly. There are 22 provinces, 5
autonomous regions, 4 municipalities, two special administrative regions (Hong
Kong and Macao), and also Taiwan. In these official COVID-19 reports, cases
are reported down to the administrative region level (the equivalent of a county).
For example, in Hubei Province, there are 17 administrative regions, such as
Wuhan City, Huangshi City, Shiyan City, Yichang City, Xiangyang City, and so
on.
Here, let us describe the procedures we used to extract essential information
from the COVID-19 daily reports. First, to ensure the reliability and verifiability
of our data, we used a browser tool called Save Page WE to download all the
daily reports and save them locally as html files. For consistency, the html files
are named in the format “Province_dd-mm-yyyy.html”. We organized these
source files into folders named after the provinces or regions. The whole dataset
will be made accessible to all readers. Next, we describe what information the
daily reports reveal. A typical daily report contains a duration of time, say
for example 1600 hour on 23 Jan 2020 to 0900 hour on 24 Jan 2020. If this
duration is within one calandar day, we treat new cases reported therein as
for that calendar day (see for example Figure 1(a)), whereas if the duration
straddles two calendar days, we treat new cases reported therein as belonging

Figure 1: A schematic diagram illustrating cases having different time durations
in the daily reports. The green and blue rectangles represent the coverage of
two consecutive daily reports. (a) The duration is entirely within one calandar
day. (b) The duration straddles two calendar days, and has uneven coverage.

to the calendar day with the longer coverage (see for example Figure 1(b)); in
cases where the duration is split evenly between the two calander days, we count
new cases reported therein towards the earlier day (see for example Figure 1(c)).
In the current version, we only extract (1) new and accumulated infected cases,
(2) new and accumulated recovered cases, and (3) new and accumulated death
cases, so we end up with six types of data for each of the administrative regions.
Because of their larger populations, municipalities report cases down to the
district level. Since municipalities are similar in sizes to counties, we decided
to collect aggregated data for the municipalities so that our data set is uniform
geographically. Some provinces like Liaoning Province offer only aggregated
data, and do not go down to the administrative region level. For these cases,
we collect and show only aggregated data. Here we introduce three formulas
that we used to count on day i the new infected (N Ii ), recovered (N Ri ), and
deaths (N Di ) from the accumulated infected (T Ii ), recovered (T Ri ), and deaths
(T Di ):
N Ii = T Ii − T Ii−1 ,
(1)
N Ri = T Ri − T Ri−1 ,

(2)

N Di = T Di − T Di−1 .

After we extract the reported cases from the daily reports, we use the above
formulas to deduce the number of new cases for our dataset.
As a side note, in the early stage of this project, we planned to do data extraction automatically. Unfortunately this was not successful because the report
format for each province was different, making scripting approaches impractical and unreliable. We show in Figures 2, 3, and 4 to illustrate how different
the formats can be and the level of difficulty to automate the collection process.
Nonetheless, we will continue to explore ways to make the automation procedure
feasible in the future.

indicate the data we extracted and stored in the dataset.

Data Records
We made the dataset available through Github [1] under the Creative Commons
Zero v1.0 Universal (CC0-1.0) license. We provide six .csv files to cover basic information of the COVID-19 pandemic in China, namely the number of new confirmed infections (China_daily_new_infections.csv) , the number of accumulated confirmed infections (China_accumulated_infections.csv), the
number of new recovered patients (China_daily_new_recoveries.csv), the
number of accumulated recovered patients (China_accumulated_recoveries.csv),
the number of new death case(s) (China_daily_new_deaths.csv), and the

number of accumulated death case(s) (China_accumulated_deaths.csv) on
each day in each city.
Each file contains 368 lines and 44 columns: the first row is the header, the
name for each column, while other rows are the data for all cities/counties. For
each row, the first four columns are names for city/county: the first cloumns
is the name of city/county in English, the second column is the name of the
provincial-level region this city/county belongs to in English, the third column

is the name of city/county in Chinese, and the fourth column is the name of the
provincial-level region this city/county belongs to in Chinese. The remaining
columns are dates ranging from 20 January 2020 to 29 Febraruy 2020 (in YYYYMM-DD format). For example, in China_accumulated_infections.csv, for
row 169, column 1 is ‘Wuhan’, whereas, column 19 (2020-02-04) is 8351. This
tells us that there are 8351 confirmed cases reported in Wuhan up till 24:00, 4
Febraruy 2020.

Technical Validation
In the data collection process, we separated the 22 provinces, 5 autonomous regions, 4 municipalities, 2 special administrative regions (Hong Kong and Macao),
and also Taiwan into two groups. The first two authors were then responsible
for the extraction of data from daily reports and then convert them into spreadsheet files from each of the groups. After completing this task, the two authors
swapped the data groups and proceeded to do a cross validation on each other’s
datasets. The purpose of swapping the datasets at this stage is to make sure
that we eliminate as many of the possible confirmation biases that can occur
during the data extraction process. During this validation stage, we identified
random errors like input errors, typos, and also registration errors (data consistently wrong after some dates). The registration errors can seriously degrade
the quality of our datasets. For the 4 municipalities, the 2 special administrative regions, and Taiwan, the error rates are close to zero because they are not
extracted at a city level. However, in some of the provinces, like Hubei Province
and Jiangsu Province, the error rates are as high as 5.7% and 4.6% respectively,
which make these datasets unreliable without the cross validation. On average, we found that the error rate over the whole of our dataset is around 2%.
Therefore, after cross validation the error rate should be 0.04%. Based on this
estimate, we expect to find 34 errors in our 84,000-point dataset. This translates to finding one error for each province. Notwithstanding this, we believe
our COVID-19 data set is robust and reliable enough after cross validation for
other scientist to use for their respective rigorous studies. Next, we demonstrate
step-by-step how to perform simple visualization and operations tasks on our
COVID-19 dataset using Python.

Usage Notes
Our datasets are in the common csv format, therefore researchers can use any
software or programming language they prefer. For example, to plot daily new
infections and daily new recoveries in Wenzhou using the Python packages Pandas and Matplotlib, we can use the following code:
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib . pyplot as plt

new_ infect ions = pd . read_csv ( " C h i n a _ d a i l y _ n e w _ i n f e c t i o n s . csv " )
t o t a l _ i n f e c t i o n s = pd . read_csv ( " C h i n a _ a c c u m u l a t e d _ i n f e c t i o n s . csv " )
Wenzhou = t o t a l _ i n f e c t i o n s [ t o t a l _ i n f e c t i o n s \\
[ ’ Prefectural level or Country level ’] = = " Wenzhou " ]
dates = Wenzhou . columns [ 4 : ] . tolist ()
numbers = Wenzhou . iloc [ 0 ] . tolist () [ 4 : ]
fig , ax = plt . subplots ()
ax . bar ( dates , numbers )
plt . xticks ( dates , dates , rotation = ’ vertical ’)
plt . title ( " Wenzhou " )

Figure 5: The accumulated number of COVID-19 infections in Wenzhou.
Beyond the city level, we can also study COVID-19 at the province level
with our datasets by using the convenient "groupby" function in Pandas, as
shown in the following Python code and figure.

province_data = new_in fectio ns . groupby ( ’ Provincial - level regions ’) .
sum () . reset_index ()
dates = province_data . columns [ 1 : ] . tolist ()
Anhui = province_data [ province_data [ ’ Provincial - level regions ’] = =
" Anhui " ]
Guangdong = province_data [ province_data [ ’ Provincial - level regions ’]
= = " Guangdong " ]
fig , ax = plt . subplots ()
ax . plot ( dates , Anhui . iloc [ 0 ] [ 1 : ] . tolist () , label = " Anhui " )
ax . plot ( dates , Guangdong . iloc [ 0 ] [ 1 : ] . tolist () , label = " Guangdong " )
ax . s e t_ x ti ck l ab el s ( dates , rotation = ’ vertical ’)
plt . legend ()

Guangdong.
Through the use of a software like QGIS, our datasets can also be used to
visualize the spreading of COVID-19 in whole of China with city-level resolution.
