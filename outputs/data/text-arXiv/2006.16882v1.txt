ABSTRACT

The objective of this paper is to synthesize the digital interventions initiatives to fight against COVID-19
in Bangladesh and compare with other countries. In order to obtain our research objective, we conducted
a systematic review of the online content. We first reviewed the digital interventions that have been used
to fight against COVID-19 across the globe. We then reviewed the initiatives that have been taken place
in Bangladesh. Thereafter, we present a comparative analysis between the initiatives taken in Bangladesh
and the other countries. Our findings show that while Bangladesh is capable to take benefits of the digital
intervention approaches, tighter cooperation between government and private organizations as well as
universities would be needed to get the most benefits. Furthermore, the government needs to make sure
that the privacy of its citizens are protected.

I. INTRODUCTION

The ‘2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)’ or ‘COVID-19’
is a new strain of coronavirus that is linked to the same family of viruses such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
(SARS). The outbreak of COVID-19 was first identified in
Wuhan, China in December 2019, which then spread to the
rest of the world. As of today (06 April 2020), coronavirus
has spread in 208 countries and territories affecting over a
million people, and 69,501 deaths [1]. Figure 1 shows the
total infected cases of COVID-19 around the world [1] and it
has been rapidly rising. Mathematical modeling suggests that
one in three people given hospital treatment for coronavirus
will need intensive care [2]. Therefore, it is expected to
overwhelm the heath-care services of many countries.
Bangladesh is a densely populated country with around
170 million people, and a population density of 1265 persons
per square kilometer [3]. The first three cases of corona affected patients in Bangladesh were reported by the country’s
Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research
(IEDCR) on 8th March 2020 [4]. As of 02 April 2020,
according to the IEDCR report, a total of 123 persons are

FIGURE 1. Infected cases of COVID-19 around the world [1]

affected, 13 died and 33 have recovered; 66,071 persons are
in home-quarantine and 420 are in isolation [5]. Figure 2
shows the total infected cases of COVID-19 in Bangladesh
[5].
The pandemic spread of COVID-19 has brought many
countries to a halt. Academic institutions and businesses were

closed down; houses, villages, even the entire cities were
quarantined to reduce the spread of COVID-19. People are
panicked due to the mass information (and misinformation)
on COVID-19 on social media and other online sources [6]–
[8]; and the healthcare systems of different countries are
crumbling under the encumbrance. The government of
Bangladesh and private organizations have taken a number
of initiatives to fight against the pandemic spread of COVID19 [9]. WHO declared declared COVID-19 a global pandemic on 11th March, 2020 [10]. Consequently, Bangladesh
government imposed total lockdown and deployed armed
forces to assist civil administration from 26th March, 2020.
The educational institutions were closed down from 18th
March, 2020 [11]. However, considering the fast-spread of
the novel corona virus and its divesting examples throughout
the whole world as shown in Figure 2; and considering the
population density, health illiteracy, socio-economic situation
and the health services of Bangladesh, it would be tough for
Bangladesh to fight against the pandemic spread of novel
corona virus. Therefore, digital solutions to provide health
care services were deemed important. Digital interventions
or the digital health interventions can play a vital role to
provide health care services for the containment of the pandemic spread of COVID-19 as observed in many developed
countries [12] [13] [14]. The term digital health intervention
is defined by the WHO [15] as “a discrete functionality of
digital technology that is applied to achieve health objectives
and is implemented within digital health applications and
ICT systems, including communication channels such as text
messages”.
Although several epidemic and pandemic diseases occurred in the recent past like Ebola Virus Disease (EVD)
and H1N1 flu (swine flu) [16], COVID–19 pandemic can
be differentiated based on the number of infected countries,
cases and applied digital interventions all over the world.
Therefore, there is limited knowledge on how digital interventions can help in the containment of a global pandemic.
Recent reports suggest that different kinds of digital solutions
are being used by the different countries in order to combat
the pandemic spread of COVID-19. These technological interventions are published in various websites and newspapers

in a very scattered way [13] [17] [18] [19]. Therefore, a
research is needed to systematically gather these initiatives
and summarize them for communicating it to the academic
society as well as other relevant stakeholders such as governments, non-governmental agencies, ICT companies, among
others. Developing countries like Bangladesh have also taken
a number of ICT-based initiatives to fight against the pandemic spread of the novel corona virus. However, what
kinds of digital initiatives have been taken and how do these
initiatives differ from the developed world are required to
be studied to plan for future digital intervention strategies.
Thus, it is utmost important to understand what kind of
digital solutions are used to combat the pandemic spread of
cornonavirus; and then highlight the possible opportunities
and the challenges to adopt such digital interventions in the
context of a developing nation like Bangladesh.
Therefore, the objective of this study is to explore the
digital intervention for the containment of pandemic spread
of COVID-19 across the globe as well as in the context
of Bangladesh. The outcome of this research will greatly
contribute to understand what kind of technology could be
used and for what purposes. The findings may help the
developing nations like Bangladesh to take further necessary
initiatives related to digital interventions to measure, prevent
and control the pandemic spread of COVID-19.
II. RESEARCH METHOD

As the topic is still emerging and there are no academic
literature available in this area, we followed an online content
review approach to attain our research objectives. We note
that online content review approach is widely accepted in
research, and popularly known as digital ethnography, online ethnography and netnography [20], [21]. Google search
engine was used to find the related online content. The
online content were analysed through systematic coding and
interpretation.
The search strings used to find the available online
content from a global perspective were “digital intervention and corona virus”, “digital intervention and COVID19”,“information technology and corona virus”,“information
technology and COVID-19”,“digital services and corona
virus”,“digital services and COVID-19”, “artificial intelligence and corona virus”, “artificial intelligence and COVID19”, “mobile application and data science and robot and
corona virus”, “mobile application and data science and
robot and COVID-19”, “electronic health services and corona
virus”, and “electronic health services and COVID-19”. The
similar set of keywords appended with ‘and Bangladesh’
were also used to find the online content explicitly focusing
to the context of Bangladesh, for example, “digital intervention and corona virus and Bangladesh”, “digital intervention
and COVID-19 and Bangladesh”, and the likes.
The search results produced more than 1000 sites of contents. We then removed the online content that discussed
the same topic, especially the news articles that focus on
the same digital/ICT interventions but published in multiple

newspapers; online contents that are not focusing to our research objectives; and the contents written other than English
and Bengali. After applying this inclusion-exclusion process,
we finally selected 57 online resources that include electronic
news article, article written as a blog, online press releases,
and the websites/web contents of different organizations. The
flowchart of inclusion and exclusion process to select the
online resources or electronic resources for content analysis
is shown in Figure 3.
The selected article were reviewed systematically for coding (after extracting related data) and interpretation. This review study primarily extracted two types of data: the technology or digital solution used in pandemic spread of COVID19; and the purpose of using such digital technologies for the
containment of pandemic spread.
Then the data were synthesized and analyzed to explore
the digital interventions from a global perspective and in
context of Bangladesh. Finally, we conducted a comparative
analysis between these two sets of findings to understand
the underlying facts of digital interventions in context of
Bangladesh and future perspectives of adopting any new
digital interventions in Bangladesh to combat the pandemic
spread of COVID-19.

III. DIGITAL INTERVENTION AND COVID-19 PANDEMIC

This section summarizes digital interventions during the pandemic spread of COVID-19. Our review found many major
ICT interventions around the globe [12]–[14], [22], [23]. We
found automatic vehicles have been used to reduce workload
of medical staffs and avoid cross-infection in China. For
example, two White Rhino unmanned vehicles were used in
Wuhan to supply medical staffs, medicines and foods [24].
The use of drones for different purposes was observed in
several countries including China, Italy, Singapore, South
Korea, France, and USA [25], [26]. Drones are used to deliver
medical supplies (e.g., thermal imaging camera) and patient
samples to improve virus detection. Agricultural drones are
used to spray disinfectants in the countryside. Some countries
used drones to ensure the lockdown. Drones that are equipped
with the face recognition capability are used to broadcast
warnings for staying at home and wearing protective facemasks.
The use of robots is also noteworthy to mention during
the pandemic spread of COVID-19 [27]–[30]. Robots are
used in different capacity in different countries such as USA,
China, Tunisia, Greece, Spain, and Italy for measuring body
temperature, recording other relevant data, spraying disinfectants and cleaning, assisting patient diagnosis, monitoring

the quarantine patients, preparing meals at hospitals, serving
foods in restaurants, vending foods, and dispensing hand
sanitizers, among others [17], [31]. Virtual humans are used
to support nurses and doctors to screen sick patients, monitor
patient recovery or help hospital staffs to answer calls or
patient questions [17].
Artificial intelligence (AI) is being used to help in the
crises of COVID-19 pandemic in a number of ways like
predicting affected patients, maintaining social distance, and
screening the patient risk in Singapore, South Korea, China,
Taiwan, USA, UK, and the EU countries [32]–[35]. AI is
used to detect people who are not using the protective mask.
It is also used to diagnose or predict coronavirus affected
persons through facial recognition technology, interpret radiological image, provide intervention recommendations, and
monitor temperature, among others [19]. AI is also heavily used in online screening and consultation platforms,
for example, an AI based coronavirus screening system is
developed that can start automatic video conversation if a
particular person is detected as a suspected patient. Another
AI based system first discusses with the patients through text
messages before transferring them to the doctors.
Big data and data analytics were used for collecting, sorting and analysing the huge masses of data produced on the
Internet and other sources in Malaysia, USA, Italy, China,
Singapore, and UK, among many other countries [36]–[38].
These techniques are used to build predictive models and
turning point projection to prevent and control the pandemic.
Data science and AI together are used to identify, track and
forecast outbreaks, diagnose the virus, process healthcare
claims, develop drugs, and develop advanced fabrics for protection [19]. For example, a big data based health monitoring
system was developed in China that uses data related to the
individuals travel history, time spent in virus hotspots, and
close contact with any affected people to identify and assess
the risk of each citizen [19]. Furthermore, supercomputing is
used for vaccine and drug development [39].
Internet of Things (IoT) is used to track clinical specimens.
For example, in Italy, an IoT based dash clicker (‘Nurse
Button‘) was used to connect patients and doctors in a field
hospital with 5,500 hospital beds and 500 intensive care beds
[40]. Wearable technologies are used to provide telemedicine
services, crowd activity monitoring, and care in quarantine
area [19], [41]. For example, a wearable device that can be
placed on throat to monitor temperature, cough and respiratory activity, has been developed in the US. It is currently
used in a limited scale to monitor the COVID-19 patients
from hospital. In China, sensor technology is used for remote
health monitoring [41], [42].
Tele and video consultation services have also been used
during the pandemic in all the infected countries. For example, national health service of England strongly recommended to use video-based consultation to help and reduce
the risk of spreading the coronavirus [43]. Chatbots are used
to share information, reassure people, help to assess COVID19 risk, help patients to get treatment and keep them away

from emergency care centers [44].
Online assessment/screening systems are used to allow
individuals to assess the possibility of being a carrier of
COVID-19 in all the infected countries including China,
Singapore, USA, and EU countries [45], [46]. Furthermore,
internet, websites, mobile applications and social network
sites were used to monitor the disease outbreak and information dissemination [17]. For example, an online resource hub
that includes blog posts, webinars, and other useful links for
helping users to manage stress, staying active, eating healthy
diets and sleeping well for dealing with COVID-19 pandemic
[44]. China used a smartphone app with color codes (green,
yellow or red) to find out people who should be allowed in
public spaces or should be quarantined [18]. Similarly, South
Korea developed the Corona 100m app that alerts users when
they come within 100 metres of a COVID-19 patient [26].
Interactive maps are used to provide the information related
to the surveillance of the epidemic. Virtual Reality (VR) is
used to teach kids about coronavirus safety [17].
Figure 4 summarizes the digital interventions to fight with
the pandemic spread of COVID-19.
IV. DIGITAL INTERVENTION TO COMBAT COVID-19 IN
BANGLADESH

As of Feb 2020, according to the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC) there are approximately 100 millions Internet users, 166 millions mobile
phone subscribers [47] [48]. Due to the wider adoption of
mobile phones and Internet, it deemed possible to use digital
interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic. In response to
pandemic spread of COVID-19, several initiatives related to
the digital technologies are taking place in Bangladesh. The
existing initiatives include the following.
i National Corona Portal-Corona Info: This is the national
web portal in Bangladesh for providing COVID-19 related information and resources [5]. The portal provides
current status of the total number of confirmed cases,
sample being tested, total recovery, and total death due
to COVID-19, among other information. It also provides
information related to the total number of quarantined
people, people at isolation and the number of people
being released from quarantined or isolation. The corona
symptoms, WHO guidelines, list of emergency numbers,
safety and prevention tips, video messages from key personnel about public awareness, recent news and digital
press releases related to corona, are updated here. Apart
from these, doctors and interested persons may apply to
contribute as health workers and to participate training on
COVID-19.
ii Information chat bots: The ‘COVID-19 Response
Bangladesh’, ’Mita Chatbot’ and the ’Bloodman’ chatbots are embedded in Facebook Messenger, and a few
other chatbots like the ‘eGeneration Corona Bot‘ and the
‘Corona INFO BOT’ are hosted at national Corona portal
[5], [49]. The chatbots can be used both in Bengali and
English. The chatbots source information from IEDCR,

WHO, and CDC. The chatbots offer COVID-19 related
information, advice on mental health, doctor consultation, and access to emergency, among others.
iii Electronic and mobile awareness initiatives: All major
mobile phone operators started a number of awareness
and preventive initiatives among their customers [50].
For example, as part of an awareness drive, Grameenphone sent awareness and preventive SMSs on coronavirus pandemic to its subscribers, provided cautionary
messages such as “Stay Home” next to the signal bar on
the phones. It also started a call service (free of charge) to
*3332 to discuss and get information on COVID-19 [51].

Ministry of Health and Family welfare of Bangladesh
government also started a national COVID-19 surveillance system to assist the people of Bangladesh in the
pandemic spread of novel corona virus [52].
iv Interactive Voice Response (IVR) services: The BTRC
directed all mobile operators in Bangladesh to start a 90second call under interactive voice response service
[53]. During each IVR session users will be asked several
questions including their age, whether they have fever
or cough, breathing problems, if they came in contact
with any corona virus infected person or someone who
recently returned from abroad.

M.N. Islam et al.: A Systematic Review of the Digital Interventions for Fighting COVID-19: The Bangladesh Perspective

v COVID-19 self-assessment: A web service available at
[54] is released to check the corona symptoms in Bengali. The system takes all necessary information about
health condition and any close contact with corona affected people, and person recently return from abroad
for assessment. Few other corona testing services like
’Corona survey’, ’COVID-19 Checker’, ’COVID-19 Self
Test’, and ’Test Corona’ are developed by different nongovernment organizations, and are hosted at the national
Corona portal [5].
vi Mobile Applications: At present, only a few number of
mobile applications are developed in Bangladesh [5]. The
apps are mainly developed to provide preventive guidelines, symptoms of corona virus, awareness information,
information for emergency care, self-screening to check
if anyone is infected or have the symptoms of corona
infection, track the quarantine people, provide the current
status of infected, recovery and death, and the likes. The
Table 1 provides an overview of the existing apps and
their purpose of development.
vii Social media/Facebook page: As Facebook and YouTube
are popular in Bangladesh, many Facebook pages are
created to provide the awareness information and up-todate corona status to the citizens. Several video documentaries have been prepared in Bengali and released
through YouTube and Facebook to make it accessible to
mass population for making people aware and prevent
corona virus. Corona related press conferences and other
awareness programs are organized thorough Facebook
live in a regular manner.
viii Preventive, awareness and controlling initiatives: A number of initiatives to educate and aware people about
corona virus, its prevention and controlling mechanism
are taken. Such initiatives include online help desk, dedicated section of a website, COVID-19 dashboard, national guidelines and policies for preventing corona virus,
and dedicated window for the e-newspapers, among others by different government and private organizations
as well as universities [59]–[61]. For example, SciTech
Academy has developed a educational portal on COVID19 for the Kids (age 5 to 12) to drive children’s awareness
to deal with the pandemic spread of novel corona virus
without being panicked [62].
ix AI and Big data based predication system and other
ICT initiatives: A team from Daffodil International University, Bangladesh developed an AI based corona prediction system that can diagnose COVID-19 from Xray results. However, the system has not been clinically
tested yet to make it usable in the current situation [63],
[64]. Another organization (eGeneration) developed a
similar system using neural network to analyse the chest
X-Ray images to detect COVID-19 and usual pneumonia
[65]. Few other institutes are conducting similar kind of
research but yet not developed anything for the clinical
use. For example, a cost-effective robot is developed
by the Sonargaon University, Bangladesh to support the

COVID-19 patients and assist doctors for treating corona
infected patients [66]. This robot still is in the experiment
phase and yet to be deployed in the hospital. Based on the
mobile users’ self-reported health information (collected
through free SMS) and big data analytics, the government
is in the process of developing a digital map to track
coronavirus cases and find out areas susceptible to contamination [67], [68]. Bangladesh police has used drones
in a very limited scale to track and monitor citizens
in Chattogram and Satkhira districts to enforce social
distance and the lockdowns [69], [70]. Furthermore, the
government is sponsoring to arrange a competition to design a cost-effective and efficient ventilator, and other ITbased application that can serve corona infected patients
[71].
V. DISCUSSIONS

In this section, we describe a comparative analysis of the
approaches that have been taken by Bangladesh in compare
to the rest of the world described earlier.
First, we observe that Bangladesh has been mostly relying on the self-reported data using the previously discussed
IVR and self-assessment web portal. This makes sense as
testing all people (170 millions) for detecting COVID-19 is
practically impossible due to the costs and other practical
limitations. In fact, we observe that even developed countries
are not able to test all of their citizens. The true infection
rate is expected to be much higher than what we see as the
confirmed reported number of cases. Therefore, it is understandable why Bangladesh moved to self-reported data approach. However, it has introduced some unique challenges.
The self-reported data are subject to biases and consist of
noises. Despite the noises, the services are expected to give
some benefits such as identifying possible affected areas and
quickly allocate resources in the areas or even locking down
the entire areas. In general, we observe preliminary initiatives
in Bangladesh on using data science and AI approaches.
However, in our view it has introduced the challenge of
data privacy. This is because there is no comprehensive
data privacy protection framework like the GDPR in Europe
and the current digital security act of Bangladesh has some
loopholes [72], [73]. Most of the digital interventions have
been based on the cooperation between public and private
sectors. Therefore, citizens’ data was shared with the private
companies. This leads citizens to worry about their data
privacy. However, the government has assured that it will
make the data protection act as soon as possible. Many people
also believe that if they are identified as corona patients, they
will be left out of the society. Therefore, they are reluctant to
share information, even they are having corona symptoms.
Second, most of the initiatives have been taken to share
information related to COVID-19 in Bangladesh. The information includes statistics on the amount of infected cases,
news, and mitigation approaches, among others. Therefore,
these initiatives relate to raising awareness among the people
about COVID-19. In contrast, countries like China and South

Purpose of the Mobile Application
Provide updated corona status, preventive information, emergency information, and notify if any
corona affected person comes close (2-3 meter) to the app user.
Provide corona status and information related to the prevention, awareness, and emergency
contact information
Provides prevention guidelines, symptoms of corona virus, how the virus spreads and tips on
emergency care.
Assists to track quarantine people using the global positioning system and face detection system.
Provide the updated status mainly about the number of individuals who are infected, recovered,
died, under quarantine, and isolation in Bangladesh.
This is the mobile version of the national corona portal of Bangladesh, and provides the similar
services through mobile platform.
Provide COVID-19 risk assessment service, and information related to COVID-19 prevention,
control and treatment.
Individuals may report their health conditions (symptoms related to COVID-19) to get the
required treatment services.

Korea have been using wearable and other related technologies to track people’s activities to make sure the infected
people are maintaining the quarantined protocol. However,
this again introduces the challenge of data privacy that we
discussed before.
Third, we note that we did not find much digital intervention approaches regarding psychological well-being across
the globe. COVID-19 is not only impacting our physical
health but also creating fear among us. Therefore, more
interventions would be required to maintain people’s psychological well-being during this pandemic.
Fourth, a major challenge from both global and
Bangladesh perspectives is to deal with misinformation on
online sources [6]. Misinformation creates panic among people and also it affects on people’s behavioral change during
pandemic. Therefore, we believe this is one potential area
where digital intervention may be useful.
Fifth, tele and video consultation services are needed to
be deployed in each hospital in Bangladesh as these services
were shown effective in this context [74]–[76]. The use
of tele-consultation has been proved useful in the global
perspective [77] as well. We observed several initiatives by
some hospitals and organizations in Bangladesh so far that
are providing telemedicine services during the COVID-19
pandemic situation to the citizens of Bangladesh as well as
for the Bangladeshi citizens living in abroad [76]. However,
in order to increase the coverage area, more hospitals need to
start tele-consultation services, and preferably video consultation.
Finally, only a few mobile applications have been developed for coronavirus so far. We note that prior research
found that most mobile health applications developed in
Bangladesh suffer from usability problems [78]–[82]. Prior
works suggest that usability is the key for wider adoption
and continued use of services [83], [84]. We did not test
the usability of the COVID-19 mobile applications in our
research. However, we observed that most of the applications
developed for COVID-19 provide similar type of services
as well as significant number of citizens are not well aware
about these applications. Furthermore, the availability of 4G
technology, internet connectivity, and user behaviour towards

accessing the mobile internet and mobile applications in
Bangladesh clearly depict the opportunity to introduce more
useful and usable mobile applications for the containment of
the pandemic spread of the coronavirus. Different services
such as remote assistance, mental health support, awareness information, education on corona virus, and monitoring
quarantine people and communicating with them could be
provided through mobile applications. Developing such kind
of applications would be a cost-effective, efficient and feasible digital intervention to combat COVID-19 pandemic to a
greater extent.
VI. CONCLUSION

In this paper, we have systematically reviewed the digital
intervention initiatives that have been taken across the globe
as well as by Bangladesh for the containment of pandemic
spread of COVID-19. Based on our comparative analysis, we
propose some areas where Bangladesh can focus to reduce
the pandemic spread of COVID-19. In summary, we think
that some of the digital interventions that have been taken and
proved useful in the global perspective may be possible in
Bangladesh. In order to achieve this, we think a cooperation
between government and private sectors will be needed.
Our study has a number of limitations, but at the same time
provides some avenues for future research. First, we used
some specific keywords to search for the relevant materials.
Therefore, it may be that we missed some important materials
that did not emerge from our search queries. Second, it may
be that the materials that we have used may have some biases
in their reporting. Third, we think timely and up-to-date
data are the key to most of the digital interventions that we
have identified in this paper. Therefore, future works would
be needed to collect accurate data using multiple methods
and not just relying on testing facilities. Fourth, while many
initiatives have been taken to collect data through digital
surveillance, we think that there is a need to develop privacy
friendly services. Finally, in this paper we present a comparative analysis between the initiatives taken in Bangladesh
and the other countries in the world. Future research can be
conducted to present comparisons among other countries.
