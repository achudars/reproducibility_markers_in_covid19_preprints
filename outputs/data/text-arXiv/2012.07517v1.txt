ABSTRACT
The paper presents our solutions for the MediaEval 2020 task
namely FakeNews: Corona Virus and 5G Conspiracy Multimedia
Twitter-Data-Based Analysis. The task aims to analyze tweets related to COVID-19 and 5G conspiracy theories to detect misinformation spreaders. The task is composed of two sub-tasks namely (i)
text-based, and (ii) structure-based fake news detection. For the first
task, we propose six different solutions relying on Bag of Words
(BoW) and BERT embedding. Three of the methods aim at binary
classification task by differentiating in 5G conspiracy and the rest
of the COVID-19 related tweets while the rest of them treat the
task as ternary classification problem. In the ternary classification
task, our BoW and BERT based methods obtained an F1-score of
.606% and .566% on the development set, respectively. On the binary classification, the BoW and BERT based solutions obtained
an average F1-score of .666% and .693%, respectively. On the other
hand, for structure-based fake news detection, we rely on Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) achieving an average ROC of .95% on the
development set.

INTRODUCTION

In the modern world, social media is playing its part in several ways,
for instance in news dissemination and information sharing, social
media outlets, such as Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram, have been
proved very effective [1, 6, 7, 9]. However, it also comes with several challenges, such as collecting information from several sources,
detecting and filtering misinformation [4, 5, 11]. Similar to other
events and pandemics, being one of the deadly pandemics in the
history, COVID-19 has been the subject of discussion over social
media since its emergence. Without any surprise, a lot of misinformation about the pandemic are circulated over social networks.
In order to identify misinformation spreaders and filter fake news
about COVID-19 and 5G conspiracy, a task namely "FakeNews:
Corona Virus and 5G Conspiracy Multimedia Twitter-Data-Based
Analysis" has been proposed in the benchmark MediaEval 2020
competition [8].
This paper provides a detailed description of the methods proposed by team DCSE_UETP for the fake news detection task. The

task consists of two parts, namely (i) text-based misinformation
detection (TMD), and (ii) structure-based misinformation detection (SMD). The first task (TMD) is based on textual analysis of
COVID-19 related information shared on Twitter during January
2020 and 15th of July 2020, and aims to detect different types of
conspiracy theories about COVID-19 and its vaccines, such as that
"the 5G weakens the immune system and thus caused the current
corona-virus pandemic etc., [8]. In the SMD task, the participants
are provided with a set of graphs, each representing a sub-graph
of Twitter, and corresponds to a single tweet where the vertices
of the graphs represent accounts. Similar to TMD, in this task, the
participants need to detect and differentiate between 5G and other
COVID-19 conspiracy theories.

2 PROPOSED APPROACH
2.1 Methodology for TMD Task
For the text-based analysis, we employed two different methods
including a (i) Bag of Words (BoW), and a (ii) BERT model-based
solution [3]. Before proceeding with the proposed methods, it is
to be noted that the dataset provided for the text-based analysis
is not balanced where one of the classes namely non-conspiracy
contains a very high number of samples while the rest are composed of relatively fewer samples. In total, the majority class contains 4412, while the other two classes, namely 5G conspiracies, and
other conspiracies, are composed of 1263 and 785 samples, respectively. In order to balance the dataset, we rely on an ensemble of
different re-sampled datasets, where ùëÅ models are built/trained by
dividing the class with a higher number of samples into n-differing
parts as illustrated in Figure 1. After training ùëÅ models, the results
of the models are combined using two different late fusion methods
including a majority voting method, and summation of the posterior probabilities. In the majority voting, since we have four models,
in the case of tie we consider the accumulative probabilities/scores
to assign a label to a test sample.
Before deploying BoW and BERT, text has been cleaned by removing punctuation‚Äôs keys, such as commas, full-stops, emojis,
URLs, and stop words. Once the text is pre-processed, we proceed
with the tokenization and creation of BoW vocabulary, which is
followed by generation of the feature vector for each sentence. A
Naives Bayes classifier is then trained on the extracted features.
On the other hand, a logistic regression model is trained on word
embeddings generated via BERT.

Methodology for SMD Task

Graphs representation learning using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
have been shown to be effective in various domains such as social
networks, biological networks, and financial networks. GNNs aggregate the neighborhood representation within k hops and then
apply a pooling such as SUM, MEAN, MAX to obtain the final representation of the node. Furthermore, GNN‚Äôs can be used to learn
the representation of a simple graph structures [2, 10, 12], which
then can be used to classify the graphs. For graph classification,
these methods learn the representation of nodes, followed by graph
READOUT method, which is aggregating the node features obtained
after the final iteration of GNN.
We model this problem as a graph classification task. Following
Keyule et al.[12], we train our model using three classes of the
graphs 5G Conspiracy, non-conspiracy, other-conspiracy, and learn
the representation of the graphs.

3 RESULTS AND ANALYSIS
3.1 Runs Description in TMD Task
For TMD, we submitted six different runs mainly relying on two
approaches, namely BERT and BoW, under two late fusion schemes.
Three of the runs are based on binary classification while the three
deal the task as ternary classification problem. It is to be noted
that the fusion schemes are used to combine the scores/output of
the four individual models trained as result of the data balancing
method as described earlier.
The first three runs are based on the ternary classification task,
where run 1 and run 2 are based on BoW with majority voting and
accumulative classification scores of the individual models. The
third and final ternary run is based on BERT features, where a
logistic regression model is trained on word embeddings generated
by BERT. As can be seen in Table 1a, overall, better results are
obtained with BoW approach under the majority voting scheme.
The last three runs are based on the binary classification task,
where the first two (i.e., Run 4 and Run 5) are based on BoW with majority voting and accumulative classification based fusion methods
while the final one (i.e., Run 6) is based on BERT with accumulative
score based fusion scheme. As expected, the performance of all the
methods is significantly higher on the binary classification task
compared to ternary classification task.

Runs Description in SMD Task

For training the model, we divide the dataset into train/valid/valid
(80/10/10). We used the grid search to obtain the best hyperparameters. The model has four MLP layers, and use MAX and MEAN
operations for neighbor pooling and graph pooling respectively.
The model is trained on 1000 epochs with a learning rate of 0.01, and
dropout 0.3 is applied on the final layer output. The final embedding
size is 128. We evaluate our model on AUC-ROC and the result of
the test set is given in Table 1(b). The results show that the model
has discriminative power to learn to classify the graph structures.
Furthermore, it shows that the diffusion of information depending
on the type of information being spread forms a diffusion pattern.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK

The challenge is composed of two tasks, one aiming to analyze and
detect COVID-19 related fake news using tweets‚Äô text while the
other aims to analyze network structure for the possible detection
of the fake news. For the first task, we mainly relied on two state-ofthe-art methods namely BoW and BERT embeddings under different
fusion schemes. Overall better results are obtained with BoW under
the majority voting scheme. For the SMD task, we rely on GNNs
to differentiate among different conspiracy theories on COVID19. In the current implementations, both textual and structural
information are used independently, in the future we aim to enrich
the structural information with the textual information for better
detection of fake news.
