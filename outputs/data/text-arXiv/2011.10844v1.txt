Abstract: This paper presents lessons learned to date during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic from the
viewpoint of Saskatchewan power system operations. A load estimation approach is developed to identify how the
closures affecting businesses, schools, and other non-critical businesses due to COVID-19 changed the electricity
consumption. Furthermore, the impacts of COVID-19 containment measures and re-opening phases on load uncertainty are
examined. Changes in CO2 emissions resulting from an increased proportion of renewable energy generation and the
change in load pattern are discussed. In addition, the influence of COVID-19 on the balancing authority’s power control
performance is investigated. Analyses conducted in the paper are based upon data from SaskPower corporation, which is
the principal electric utility in Saskatchewan, Canada. Some recommendations for future power system operation and
planning are developed.

1. Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a
contagious disease caused by severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 [1]. COVID-19 was first
recognized in December 2019, in Wuhan, China and, soon
after, COVID-19 cases were identified all over the world
and the number of infected individuals progressively
increased. The first confirmed case in Canada was
determined on January 27, 2020. In Canada, travelers or
individuals linked to the travelers primarily constituted the
initial confirmed COVID-19 cases, which in turn galvanized
the Federal Government to invoke the Quarantine Act in
mid-March, 2020. As per this Act, travelers, excluding
essential workers, are legally required to self-isolate for 14
days upon entering Canada from another country. On March
11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared
COVID-19 a global pandemic. Correspondingly, various
provincial governments announced a State of Emergency
(SOE).
By March 22, an SOE had been declared in all
Canadian provinces and territories. As a consequence, all
schools, universities, and non-essential business centers
were closed. International travel was severely restricted and
large assemblies were prohibited. Employees of many
organizations and companies were asked to work remotely
from home. As a side-effect of these socio-economic
changes, various industries experienced an unprecedented
recession. From February 21 to March 27, the Canadian
Crude Index (CCI) tumbled to $8.66 (i.e., the lowest price in
five years) [2]. The Alberta Natural Gas price also declined
by 10% from February to March 2020 [3]. The stock market
price of various multinational industries, which make up a
considerable portion of the non-conforming electric loads,

plummeted drastically, which can be considered as an
indicator of lower manufacturing activities. For instance, on
March 13, the stock price for EVRAZ plc had dropped by
41% compared to February 21, and on March 20, Nutrien
Ltd. and Mosaic Co. experienced their lowest stock market
price in the last five years [4], these companies are
significant electricity users in Saskatchewan, Canada.
Provincial Government measures, devised to tackle the
COVID-19 pandemic, as well as their consequent impact on
human activities and industries, resulted in drastic changes
in electricity consumption in Saskatchewan. In turn, power
system operations have changed, and operators have faced
unconventional challenges.
Changes in electricity consumption patterns have
been reported in various countries and regions in response to
the pandemic. In Italy, electricity consumption in 2020
declined by 37% compared to 2019, and this demand
reduction affected the electricity market and power system
reliability. The energy price also decreased by
approximately 30%, forcing the large thermal generation
units (which cannot compete against renewables) to shut
down due to higher production costs compared to the market
price [5]. In the Brazilian power grid, the lockdowns and
isolations resulted in an apparent decline in electricity
consumption and changes to the weekly load profile [6]. The
impact of various European countries measures to curb the
spread of COVID-19 on electricity consumption is
examined in [7]. Electricity consumption has noticeably
differed during COVID-19, compared to the same time
period in 2019. Electricity consumption declined in
European countries undergoing lockdowns but grew in other
countries with less restrictive measures. Changes in power
systems operations in three small power systems—Israel,
Estonia, and Finland—is examined in [8]. Compared to

February 2020, the commercial load in both Israel and
Estonia dropped more than 15% by April 2020. The weekly
averaged load profile also became smoother as time
progressed. Overvoltage and frequency stability issues
resulting from low loads and high renewable penetration are
considered the key problems in these grids.
The experiences shared by various electric utilities
show that depending on the power system specifications and
governmental measures, utilities may face dissimilar and
unprecedented challenges in power system operations;
therefore, investigating the impact of the COVID-19 can
provide further insights into the effect of a pandemic on
electric power systems operation. Moreover, most of the
studies were conducted early in the COVID-19 outbreak,
and the prolonged influence of the pandemic and response
measures have not been examined. To this end, this paper
considers approximately six months of historical data (since
the start of the COVID-19 pandemic) and scrutinizes
Saskatchewan power system operations during the initial
months of the SOE and the mandatory business closures and
then the subsequent re-opening phases. Saskatchewan power
system operations are analyzed based on historical data
recorded before and during the health crisis (i.e., January
2015 to September 2020). A weather-based load estimation
approach is developed to estimate the changes to the daily
load pattern, as well as energy consumption. Different
aspects of the load profile are examined, which can be used
to define scenarios that need to be considered in planning
studies. Additionally, the impact of a modified daily electric
load profile, as a result of the SOE, on the accuracy of the
load forecasting model is considered. The consequences of
prolonged energy consumption disruption on the generation
mix, CO2 emissions, and power control performance are
discussed. Taking into account the outcomes of this study in
planning and operation can facilitate power system
resiliency and future preparedness against pandemics.

2. Saskatchewan’s Power System
To acknowledge the impact of COVID-19 containment
measures on Saskatchewan power system operation, some
information is provided about North American power
systems as well as SaskPower Corporation (SPC)—the
primary electric utility in Saskatchewan, Canada.
As shown in Fig. 1, the electrical power grid of North
America is mainly a network of five interconnected grids:
Eastern Interconnection, Western Interconnection, Texas
Interconnection (ERCOT), Quebec Interconnection, and
Alaska Interconnection. The North American Electric
Reliability Corporation (NERC)—the electric reliability
organization for North America—oversees six regional
reliability entities to ensure the reliability of the North
America Electric Power System [9]: Northeast Power
Coordinating Council (NPCC), Midwest Reliability
Organization (MRO), SERC Reliability Corporation
(SERC), Reliability First (RF), Texas Reliability Entity
(Texas RE), and Western Electricity Coordinating Council
(WECC). Reginal reliability entities are responsible for
ensuring the compliance of the entities that own, operate, or
use the interconnected grid.
SPC is part of the Eastern Interconnection and a
subregion within the MRO. SPC serves as a balancing
authority, transmission operator, and reliability coordinator
that plans and operates generation and transmission systems
such that the demand and resource balance is maintained
within the balancing authority area and supports the
interconnection frequency in real-time. As can be observed
from Fig. 1, SPC is the most western region of the Eastern
Interconnection and is connected to the eastern

2

Fig. 2. SPC installed generation capacity mix.
region of the interconnection through the Manitoba Hydro
Electric Board (MHEB) with five alternative currents (AC)
tie-lines. It is also connected to the southern part of the
interconnection (i.e., the US) via the Basin Electric Power
Cooperative (BEPC) grid by means of a phase shifter
transformer. SPC connects the Eastern Interconnection to
the Western Interconnection and WECC with a direct
current (DC) interconnection to Alberta, Canada.
SPC's total installed generation capacity is about 4850
MW. Most of the generation facilities are owned by SPC,
with the exception of a few independent power producers
that are mainly gas-fired generation facilities. The installed
generation mix in Saskatchewan is illustrated in Fig. 2.
SPC’s maximum observed electricity demand in summer
(i.e., May to October) and winter (November to April) are
3523 and 3792 MW, respectively. Compared to the Eastern
Interconnection, SPC’s generation and load are relatively
small. Therefore, due to SPC’s AC tie-lines with the rest of
the Eastern Interconnection, SPC benefits from a high
system inertia.
3. Provincial COVID-19 Containment Measures
Identifying the COVID-19 control measures that
have disturbed the energy consumption pattern is essential
to understand the impact of the pandemic on Saskatchewan
power system operations. A summary of the Provincial
Government responses is provided below.
On March 18, 2020, the Government of
Saskatchewan declared an SOE, which was followed by the
closure of all businesses except critical public services and
essential business services. Critical public services and
essential business services are defined by the Government as
services and businesses the closure of which would imperil
residents’ health and safety, or that are providing residents
with essential needs. All gatherings were limited to 10
people, and all activities that require larger assemblies were
cancelled or became virtual. As per Governmental
guidelines, many companies had their employees to work
from their own homes.
On April 23, 2020, the Government of Saskatchewan
released its re-opening plan, which consisted of five phases.
In the first phase, starting May 4, some minor businesses,
including previously restricted medical services, were re-

opened, but the size of gatherings was still limited to 10
people. On May 19, retail and personal care services were
re-opened in the second phase, but the gathering size limit
remained at 10. In the third phase of re-opening that began
June 8, restaurants, fitness centers, places of worship, and
childcare facilities recommenced their activities, and the
allowable size of indoor and outdoor assemblages increased
to 15 and 30, respectively. In the fourth phase of re-opening,
starting June 22, most restrictions on continuity of services
and businesses were lifted. The fifth phase (date
forthcoming) is a long-term plan to remove the restriction on
the size of the public gatherings. Along with the
Government re-opening plan, many companies have
established their re-integration plans with several phases to
return staffs who are working remotely to the workplace.
As elaborated in the next section, the SOE
declaration and COVID-19 control measures initially
resulted in a reduction in energy consumption, as well as
noticeable changes in the energy consumption pattern.
However, in response to the re-opening phases and reintegrations, energy consumption has gradually returned to
levels closer to the normal.
4. Impact

of

COVID-19

on

Electricity

Consumption
To examine the consequences of the COVID-19 on
electricity consumption, in this section, first, a demand
estimation approach is developed that approximates the
electricity demand based on historical load patterns and
climatological information during SOE, in the absence of
the COVID-19 impacts. Comparing the estimated energy
consumption with the actual one highlights the impacts of
the COVID-19 on the electricity demand.
4.1. An Electricity Demand Estimation Approach
Hereafter the hourly averaged system load time series
𝑁∙𝑇
is denoted by {𝑦𝑡 }𝑡=𝑇𝑠𝑠 , where 𝑇𝑠 is the sample time. In this
paper, 𝑇𝑠 = 1 ℎ. The electricity demand during the COVID19 pandemic is estimated using the following linear model.
𝑦̂𝑡 = 𝑡𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑦𝑒𝑎𝑟𝑡 + 𝒂𝑡 × 𝒃,

(1)

𝒂𝑡 = [𝑾𝒆𝒆𝒌𝑫𝒂𝒚𝑡 , 𝑴𝒐𝒏𝒕𝒉𝑡 ,
, 𝑯𝒐𝒖𝒓𝑡 , 𝑾𝒆𝒆𝒌𝒅𝒂𝒚𝑯𝒐𝒖𝒓𝑡
𝑊𝑒𝑒𝑘𝑒𝑛𝑑𝒕 , 𝑯𝒐𝒍𝒊𝒅𝒂𝒚𝑡 ,
𝑇𝑒𝑚𝑝𝑡𝑀𝑎𝑥 ∙ 𝑯𝒐𝒍𝒊𝒅𝒂𝒚𝑡 , 𝑇𝑒𝑚𝑝𝑡𝑀𝑖𝑛 ∙ 𝑯𝒐𝒍𝒊𝒅𝒂𝒚𝑡 ,

(2)

𝑊𝑖𝑛𝑑𝐶ℎ𝑖𝑙𝑙𝑡 ∙ 𝑯𝒐𝒖𝒓𝑡 ∙ 𝑊𝑖𝑛𝑑𝐶ℎ𝑖𝑙𝑙𝑆𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑜𝑛𝑡 ,
𝐻𝑒𝑎𝑡𝐼𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑥𝑡 ∙ 𝑯𝒐𝒖𝒓𝑡 ∙ 𝐻𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑆𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑜𝑛𝑡 ,
, 𝑇𝑒𝑚𝑝𝑡 ∙ 𝑯𝒐𝒖𝒓𝑡 , 𝑇𝑒𝑚𝑝𝑡2 ∙ 𝑯𝒐𝒖𝒓𝑡 , 1] ,
where 𝑡𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑦𝑒𝑎𝑟 𝑡 pertains to the annual trend of the load for
time 𝑡 . Throughout a year, 𝑡𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑦𝑒𝑎𝑟𝑡 has a constant
quantity. 𝑾𝒆𝒆𝒌𝑫𝒂𝒚𝑡 , 𝑴𝒐𝒏𝒕𝒉𝑡 , 𝑯𝒐𝒖𝒓𝑡 , and
3

𝑾𝒆𝒆𝒌𝒅𝒂𝒚𝑯𝒐𝒖𝒓𝑡 are one-hot vectors with 1 × 7, 1 × 12,
1 × 24, and 1 × 168 vector, respectively. 𝑊𝑒𝑒𝑘𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑡 is a
binary variable, which is 1 when time 𝑡 refers to a time on a
weekend and 0 otherwise. In (2), 𝑯𝒐𝒍𝒊𝒅𝒂𝒚𝑡 is a 1 × 12
one-hot vector, where the 𝑖th element of the vector becomes
1 if time 𝑡 is related to a federal or provincial statutory
holiday in the 𝑖 th month. 𝑊𝑖𝑛𝑑𝐶ℎ𝑖𝑙𝑙𝑆𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑜𝑛𝑡 and
𝐻𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑆𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑜𝑛𝑡 are binary variables that categorize the
months of the year into the cold season (i.e., months with
wind chill) and hot season (i.e., months with high heat
index). In (2), 𝑇𝑒𝑚𝑝𝑡𝑀𝑎𝑥 and 𝑇𝑒𝑚𝑝𝑡𝑀𝑖𝑛 are the maximum
and minimum daily temperatures, respectively. 𝑇𝑒𝑚𝑝𝑡 ,
𝑊𝑖𝑛𝑑𝐶ℎ𝑖𝑙𝑙𝑡 , and 𝐻𝑒𝑎𝑡𝐼𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑥𝑡 pertain to ambient
temperature, wind chill, and heat index, respectively. 𝒃, in
(1), is an unknown column vector. 𝑡𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑦𝑒𝑎𝑟 𝑡 , in (1), is
obtained by least square approach without consideration of
the second term of Eq. 1 (i.e., 𝒂𝑡 × 𝒃). After acquiring
𝑡𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑦𝑒𝑎𝑟 𝑡 , 𝒃, in (1), is acquired using the least-squares
approach. Climatological data for this study are obtained
from [10], and the wind chill and heat index are calculated
based on [11] and [12], respectively. It is worth noting that
other feature candidates including various lags of
climatological data are tested as the input features, however,
no improvement in the load estimation was observed.
4.2. Evaluation Metrics
Mean Squared Error (MSE) is employed to examine
the accuracy of the load estimation and assess the load
consumption changes resulting from the COVID-19
pandemic. The MSE is calculated as follows [13]:
𝑀𝑆𝐸 = 𝑉𝑎𝑟 + 𝐵𝑖𝑎𝑠 2 ,

(3)

where 𝑉𝑎𝑟 and 𝐵𝑖𝑎𝑠 are the variance and average of error
𝑁∙𝑇
time series (i.e., {𝑦𝑡 − 𝑦̂𝑡 }𝑡=𝑇𝑠𝑠 ), respectively.
The daily Energy Variation Index ( 𝐸𝑉𝐼 ) is another
metric to assess further the trend of energy consumption and
measures the percentage of the changes in energy
consumption with respect to the estimated daily energy. The
𝐸𝑉𝐼 for the 𝑑th day is defined as follows:
′′

𝐸𝑉𝐼𝑑 (%) =

∑𝑡𝑡=𝑡 ′ 𝑦̂𝑡 − 𝑦𝑡
′′

∑𝑡𝑡=𝑡 ′ 𝑦̂𝑡

× 100,

(4)

𝑡 ′ = 24 ∙ (𝑑 − 1) + 1,

(5)

𝑡 ′′ = 24 ∙ 𝑑.

4.3. Load Estimation
An easy way to comply with the requirements stated
in the Author Guide [1] is to use this document as a template
and simply type your text into it. PDF files are also
accepted, so long as they follow the same style.
To investigate the performance of the load estimation
approach prior to COVID-19 and assess the impact of the
COVID-19
containment
measures
on
electricity
consumption, three scenarios are considered. Table 1
summarizes the time window of each scenario. In Scenario
I, the hourly averaged load from March 1, 2017 to March
18, 2020 (i.e., prior to the declaration of a provincial SOE)
is estimated. The performance evaluation of the load
estimation for Scenario I is used to examine the accuracy
and unbiasedness of the load estimation. In the load
estimation process, the model is updated every 167 days
(i.e., the number of days from the SOE declaration to
September 1, 2020) using the recent 26 months dataset.
Updating the model every 167 days ensures the historical
load data do not influence the load estimation. Scenarios II
and III represent the estimated hourly averaged load from
March 18 to September 1 in 2019 and 2020, respectively.
These scenarios allow for a comparison of the load
estimation performance during similar days in different
years, where the latter reflects dates after the SOE
declaration.
The results of 𝑀𝑆𝐸 and its components (i.e., 𝑉𝑎𝑟 and
𝐵𝑖𝑎𝑠) from the estimation of various scenarios are presented
in Table 1. 𝑀𝑆𝐸 values for Scenario III, compared to the
ones for Scenarios I and II is substantially higher which is
due to its evidently higher 𝐵𝑖𝑎𝑠 value as the result of lower
energy consumption compared to expected energy
consumption during the time interval associated to Scenario
III. Negative 𝐵𝑖𝑎𝑠 corresponds to an overall overestimation
(i.e., estimated loads are higher than actual loads), while
positive values refer to a general underestimation (i.e., i.e.,
estimated loads are lower than actual loads). This table
shows the load estimation approach results in a relatively
unbiased prediction for Scenarios I and II, but a tangible
overestimation in Scenario III. To compare the 𝐵𝑖𝑎𝑠 values
for Scenarios I and II with the one for Scenario III, it is
assumed that the load estimation error for each hour of all
scenarios can be modeled as independent random variables
each with equal variance. It can be shown that there is
abnormal load behavior in Scenario III, compared to
reference Scenario (i.e., Scenarios I and II), if the following
condition holds:

where sub-index 𝑆𝐶𝑅𝑒𝑓 refers to Scenarios II or III, and the
sub-index 𝑆𝐶𝐼𝐼𝐼 is associated with Scenario II. Based on
Table 1, the Eq. 7 inequality is satisfied, i.e., 114.24 ≫ 1.95
if 𝑆𝐶𝑅𝑒𝑓 refers to Scenario I and 143.88 ≫ 1.95 if 𝑆𝐶𝑅𝑒𝑓
refers to Scenario II. Therefore, the observed 𝐵𝑖𝑎𝑠 in
𝑆𝑐𝑒𝑛𝑎𝑟𝑖𝑜 𝐼𝐼𝐼 is substantially high which is an indicator of
anomalies and can be associated with COVID-19 as
discussed further in the following.
Fig. 3a shows actual and estimated daily energy
consumption from January 1 to September 1, 2020. Prior to
the SOE declaration, the estimated daily energy
consumption is very close to the energy consumption;
however, since late February 2020, the estimated energy
values have been higher, which may be rooted in the
historical oil price drop and the subsequent reduced
industrial activities. Following the declaration of the SOE in
Saskatchewan, electric energy demand declined steadily,
with the highest reduction in energy consumption observed
in May 2020. However, since mid-July 2020, the difference
between actual and estimated daily energy consumption has
progressively decreased. To further clarify the difference
between the estimated and actual daily energy consumption,
Fig. 3b presents the 𝐸𝑉𝐼 for January 1 to September 1, 2020.
The 𝐸𝑉𝐼 prior to COVID-19 is mostly limited within the -

5% to 5% interval—except in late February when the oil
price crashed. However, the 𝐸𝑉𝐼 spiked to more than 10%
after the SOE declaration until mid-July, when the fourth
phase of re-opening in Saskatchewan started, i.e., when
shopping malls, recreational centers, gym facilities,
restaurants, small businesses, movie theatres, etc., were reopened with reduced capacity.
As mentioned above, SPC observed the highest energy
consumption drop in terms of 𝐸𝑉𝐼 in May 2020. To further
investigate the load behavior, the estimated and actual
hourly averaged load values for May 2019 and May 2020
are presented in Fig. 4. Fig. 4a shows the estimation
approach can determine the load for May 2019 with high
accuracy, except in the first few days of the month that
feature non-conforming loads due to planned and unplanned
outages. On the other hand, Fig. 4b shows the estimated load
for May 2020 is markedly higher than the actual load.
Further investigation revealed a statistically significant
correlation between maximum daily temperature and 𝐸𝑉𝐼
observed in May 2020 (Pearson correlation 0.63, 𝑝<0.0001).
Fig. 5 shows the 𝐸𝑉𝐼 and maximum daily temperature
associated with each day of May 2020. The large differences
between the estimated and actual loads mostly occurred on
days with high temperatures, when cooling loads needed to
be utilized. However, due to the closure of many indoor
public areas, teleworking plans, and cancellation of public

events, the cooling loads were substantially reduced
compared to 2019.
To investigate the accumulated energy consumption
reduction since the SOE declaration, the accumulated
difference between the estimated and actual load for 2020 is
shown in Fig. 6. The accumulated difference for the last
three years within a similar period is also depicted and
provides insights about the performance of load estimation
in past years. The figure shows the accumulated difference
between the estimated and actual load for 2017-2019
fluctuates and is relatively small, yet for 2020 grew steadily

but has been approximately flat since mid-July. Overall, the
2020 data reflect an approximately 510 GWh reduction in
energy consumption, but also that the impact of COVID-19
on energy consumption is diminishing.
From the declaration of the SOE to mid-July 2020, the
hourly ramp-up and ramp-down of the daily load profile
slightly declined, thereby flattening the daily load profile.
Figs. 7 and 8 respectively present box-and-whisker diagrams
of the maximum hourly averaged ramp-up and ramp-down
that occurred daily from March 18 to July 15 in various
years. Approximately 75% of the maximum daily ramp-ups
and ramp-downs in 2020 are lower than the median of
maximum daily ramp-up and ramp-downs that occurred in
the previous five years.
Overall, SPC has observed substantial changes in the
electricity load consumption pattern. From March 18 to midJuly 2020, energy consumption dropped. The most
noticeable energy consumption decline occurred in May
when the ambient temperature was as high as 30 ℃. The
hourly average load variability also shrunk; and
consequently, the daily load profile became smoother. Since
the fourth phase of re-opening began in mid-July, the actual
load consumption pattern has begun to resemble the
expected pattern more closely. This indicates the energy
reduction impact of COVID-19 has declined.

5. Impact of COVID-19 on Load Uncertainty
SPC purchases its load forecasting services from a
third-party vendor. The load forecast takes into account
weather forecast information as well as the historical load.
The day-ahead load forecast is used in the day-ahead unit
commitment and economic dispatch. The electricity
consumption changes discussed in Section 4 have resulted in
increased load forecasting inaccuracy due to a lack of
adequate historical load data with a similar pattern. Mean
Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error
(MAPE) are used to evaluate the performance of the dayahead prediction of electricity load for March to September
in both 2019 and 2020. MAE and MAPE are calculated as
follows:

where 𝑦𝑡 and 𝑦̂𝑡 are the actual and forecasted load values
related to the 𝑡 th observation, respectively. 𝑁 is the total
number of observations.
Table 2 summarizes the load forecast performance
assessment for various months in 2019 and 2020. The last
two columns in this table present the relative 𝑀𝐴𝐸 and
𝑀𝐴𝑃𝐸 for 2020 with respect to 2019, where positive
quantities refer to deterioration of the forecast in 2020
compared to 2019 for similar months. Compared to the load
forecast performance in March 2019, the load forecast in
March 2020 significantly deteriorated as the 𝑀𝐴𝐸 and
𝑀𝐴𝑃𝐸 increased by 68.83% and 77.64%, respectively. The
accuracy of the load forecast gradually recovered in the
ensuing months, and in May the load forecast performance
was very similar to the previous year. However, since June
and with electricity consumption gradually returning to
normal, the performance of the load forecast has steadily
deteriorated. As noted in Section 4, during the third and
fourth re-opening phases, the electricity consumption began
to return to normal, but the system load historical data prior
to the re-opening phases were considerably lower than the
estimated loads. These disturbed historical data might affect
the load forecast model.

6. Impact of COVID-19 on Fuel, CO2 Emissions,
and Generation
The reduced electricity consumption and changes in the
daily load profile result in changes to the generation mix. As
an example, the pie charts in Fig. 9 show the generation mix
in May for 2019 and 2020. This figure shows the penetration
of the hydro and wind markedly increased in 2020 versus
2019. Specifically, wind and hydro generation constitute
15% of the total SPC generation in May 2019, but this
increased to 32% in May 2020 (i.e., more than 100%
increase in their penetration to the power system). Such
increased penetration of hydro and wind is associated with
the higher runoff flow and substantially lower load in May
2020 compared to May 2019, as discussed in Section 4. Fig.
10 illustrates the highest renewable penetration observed
every year since 2015, with the highest percent penetration
occurring in 2020. The highest renewable penetration SPC
has ever observed was occurred at 8:00 a.m. on May 31,
2020.
The higher share of renewable energy generation
contributing to meeting the electricity demand resulted in a
reduction in CO2 emissions. Compared to March 18 to
September 1, 2019, the same date ranging in 2020 saw CO2
emissions caused by the coal-fired generation fleet drop by
more than 25% and by the gas-fired generation fleet drop by
6%. Therefore, thanks to the measures taken to control the
COVID-19 pandemic, SPC generation was more
environmentally friendly.
With the disruption in the generation mix and reduced
load during the COVID-19 pandemic, the real power control
performance was also affected. Some of the large fossil fuelfired generation units could not be dispatched even to their
minimum stable generation level and were kept on cold
standby mode. This is largely attributed to the lower
baseload. On the other hand, the fast response small-scale
generation units, which are able to operate in automatic
generation control (AGC) mode, were committed and
dispatched close to their full available capacity and beyond
the AGC mode region. Therefore, they were able to provide
very limited regulation services, especially regulation up
service. Moreover, Saskatchewan experienced a unique
long-lasting spring runoff in which the reservoirs were fully
utilized, and a large amount of excess water flowed down
the spillways, while most of the hydro generators were
generating close to their maximum capacity. Such high
runoff flow restricted the hydropower generators' capability

to provide down-room regulation reserve.
Due to the aforementioned reasons, the efficiency of
power control performance declined; however, SPC’s power
control performance was still maintained significantly above
the NERC requirements. To demonstrate this, Control
Performance Standard 1 (CPS1) [14] is calculated for
various months. The monthly CPS1 is calculated as follows:

where 𝜖1𝐼 is the interconnection constant, and for the Easter
Interconnection is 0.018 Hz. In (12), 𝑁𝑀𝑜𝑛𝑡ℎ is the number

setting, which varies annually for different balancing

is the clock-minute average of
frequency deviation from the target system frequency for the

𝑡th minute and 𝑅𝐴𝐶𝐸𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑢𝑡𝑒
is the clock-minute average of

reporting area control error for the 𝑡th minute and is
calculated as follows [15]:
𝑅𝐴𝐶𝐸 = (𝑁𝐼𝐴 (𝑡) − 𝑁𝐼𝑆 (𝑡)) − 10𝐵(𝐹𝐴 (𝑡) − 𝐹𝑆 (𝑡)),
(14)
where 𝑁𝐼𝐴 (𝑡) and 𝑁𝐼𝑆 (𝑡) are the actual and scheduled net
interchange at time 𝑡, respectively. 𝐵 is the frequency bias

setting, expressed as

frequency at time 𝑡, while 𝐹𝑆 (𝑡) is the scheduled frequency.
Table 3 summarizes the relative values of CPS1 for
March to September in 2020 compared to 2019. Positive
quantities show that, from the CPS1 perspective, the power
control performance in 2020 was worse than in 2019, while
negative quantities represent a relative improvement in
CPS1. Table 3 shows that, in terms of the CPS1 metric, the
power control performance has been worse in most months
since the SOE declaration, with the worst CPS1 score is
related to May; however, from June onward the
deterioration in CPS1 score has recovered. Also, note that
the CPS1 score for some of the months in 2020 is better than
these in 2019; this is attributed in part to the Chinook
Combined-Cycle Generation facility—one of the main
generation units with a wide range of AGC operation—
being out of service.

7. Discussion
This study examined various impacts of the socioeconomic restrictions resulting from the COVID-19
pandemic. Prolonged COVID-19 containment measures
substantially
reduced
electricity
consumption
in
Saskatchewan. The baseload decreased, which brought
about more sustainable power system operations by
increasing the penetration of renewable energy, lowering
CO2 emissions, and shutting down large-scale fossil fuelfired generation units. However, the reduced load led to
some power system operations challenges. Shutting down
some of the fossil fuel-fired generation units meant the
available regulating reserve was markedly reduced, which
led to a lower CPS1 score in March-June 2020 compared to
the same months in 2019. This high renewable penetration
provides power systems operators and planners with a
unique opportunity to experimentally perceive the
challenges of future power systems with increased
proliferation of renewables.
Furthermore, as a consequence of COVID-19 socioeconomic impacts, system load uncertainty increased as the
load forecast model became less accurate. Therefore, in dayahead and real-time operation planning, more operating
reserves should be available to compensate for load forecast
errors. No overvoltage or frequency issues were identified,
which is attributed to the reduced load as a result of the
COVID-19 pandemic.
This study provides valuable insights that can be used
in various future studies. For example, a resilient power
system must consider scenarios with prolonged electricity
consumption reduction in both generation and transmission
expansion planning. In this way, the specifications of future
generation units (e.g., minimum stable generation level,
AGC region, etc.) are identified such that the power system
can reliably and economically operate in the case of such
scenarios. Correspondingly, from the transmission
expansion viewpoint, future expansions must consider
adequate flexibility to alleviate issues that can be a
consequence of lower electricity demand. From the power
system operations perspective, developing load forecasting
tools that consider socio-economic factors (i.e., business
closures due to pandemics, re-opening and re-integration
plans, stock market, etc.) is crucial.
8. Conclusion
Socio-economic issues related to the COVID-19
pandemic affected Saskatchewan's electricity consumption.
This study demonstrates how provincial measures with
respect to the COVID-19 changed the daily load profile and
resulted in lower energy consumption. A consequence of the
re-opening phases and re-integration processes employed by
many organizations and companies diminished the impact of
COVID-19 on electricity consumption. Due to the
disruption in the electricity demand, the accuracy of the load
forecasting tool declined and therefore, more operating
reserve was required to handle the load uncertainty.
Furthermore, the investigations reveal Saskatchewan
experienced its highest ever renewable energy penetration
thanks to the lower load during the COVID-19 business
closures. The lower load and higher share of renewable

energy resulted in drastic changes to the generation mix.
Accordingly, CO2 emissions substantially declined in
March-September 2020 compared to a similar period in
2019. Furthermore, power control performance declined as a
consequence of generation mix changes.
The outcomes presented in this paper provide
valuable perceptions of how a prolonged SOE declaration
can affect power system operations. The insights will assist
planners and operators in ensuring the preparedness of the
power system for reliable operation under such
circumstances.
