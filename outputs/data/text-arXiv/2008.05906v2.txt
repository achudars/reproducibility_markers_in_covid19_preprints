Abstract
Millions of people are infected by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) around the world.
Machine Learning (ML) techniques are being used for COVID-19 detection research from the
beginning of the epidemic. This article represents the detailed information on frequently used datasets
in COVID-19 detection using Machine Learning (ML). We investigated 96 papers on COVID-19
detection between January 2020 and June 2020. We extracted the information about used datasets
from the articles and represented them here simultaneously. This investigation will help future
researchers to find the COVID-19 datasets without difficulty.

Introduction

The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2, also known as SARS-CoV-2 or novel Coronavirus 2019 or
mostly used COVID-19 was first reported in December 2019 in the Hubei Province of China [1]. Over 0.7 million
deaths and around 20 million confirmed cases had been reported worldwide by the World Health Organization (WHO)
due to the virus epidemic [2]. A vital step is quickly identifying the infected people and isolating them to delay the
spread of the epidemic [3]. In the context of COVID-19 identification, ML techniques have been employed to detect
the disease from various data analysis and classification [4, 5]. ML-based techniques are automatic and easy to use
and implement in clinical settings [6]. One of the key parts of ML techniques is the dataset to train detection models
and validation. Literature shows, most of the COVID-19 detection-based models were developed using image datasets
including X-ray image, Computed Tomography (CT) images. But it is difficult and hard work for new researchers to
collect and identify the required dataset for their research.
To address this issue, we represented a large scale open access datasets collection which was used by previous COVID19 research studies. Initially, we collected hundreds of COVID-19 detection related articles between January 2020
and June 2020 from various online libraries, such as Google Scholar, Elsevier, PubMed, and WHO Database. Finally,
we selected 96 ML-based COVID-19 detection articles to conduct this investigation. This article collection process
was performed by the established and popular Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses
(PRISMA) statement [7]. Then we extracted the information of used datasets for detection models from each article.
We listed out the most frequently used datasets in the 96 studies. Besides, we included the detailed information, open
accessible destination link, and available paper link of each dataset in the next section. This dataset compilation
initiative will give easy and effective access for future COVID-19 researchers.

Task description

As Figure 1 shows, the first task of this study was collecting articles from different databases. We used the PRISMA
statement to collect all articles that are relevant to COVID-19 detection research using ML techniques. The article
collection using the PRISMA method was described broadly in the following articles [1, 3, 8]. In addition, we used
four digital libraries to collect articles including Google Scholar, Elsevier, PubMed, and WHO Database. After
ending this process we confirmed 96 COVID-19 detection research articles using ML techniques. The next step was

sources are combined in their dataset, e.g., Cohen JP dataset, COVID-19-database. This combined dataset is
available online and freely accessible in the Kaggle repository.
COVIDx: It is also a hybrid dataset that combines 5 different publicly available data repositories and is known
as “COVIDx”. This open-access dataset is available in GitHub storage. Three types of data were included and
each type has different train and test data distribution in the dataset.
COVID-CT: This dataset is divided into two parts: one for COVIT-19 positive known as “COVID-CT” and
non-COVIT-19 known as “non-COVID-19 CT”. Data of various sources were combined to prepare the datasets.
The contributors collected 760 COVID-19 research preprints from two different platforms. Then they did an
interesting job, they extracted CT images from the PDF documents of the articles. Extracted images were
manually pre-processed and metadata of each image collected.
COVID-CTset: The lung CT scan data was collected from an Iranian medical center. Dataset contains
COVID-19 positive and normal both patients’ images, also they included the metadata of the patients. The
data and relevant documents are available online with open access.
POCUS Dataset: This dataset was prepared differently, images were taken from lung POCUS video recordings
that are publicly available in web and publications. A total of 64 videos were considered from various sources,
where 39 COVID-19, 14 pneumonia, and 11 videos of healthy patients. Average 17±6 frames were selected
from per video with a frame rate of 3Hz. Dataset is available in the GitHub repository with open access.
IRCCS blood data: The data of the dataset were collected from patients’ blood, known as “IRCCS blood
data”. This dataset consists of routine blood exam records of patients admitted to an Italian hospital from the
end of February 2020 to mid of March 2020. Several features were considered from blood tests, including
white blood cell counts, and the platelets, CRP, AST, ALT, GGT, ALP, LDH plasma levels. They also included
the rRT-PCR swab test results for every patient as the dependent variable. Dataset is freely available for
everyone in the Zenodo repository.

Conclusion

We build a collection of COVID-19 research datasets, where top used datasets were considered from the COVID-19
detection research articles between the period of January 2020 and June 2020. We investigated 96 research articles to
access the information of used datasets. We described the datasets in three categories, one was COVID-19 positive
sample-based, another was negative sample-based, and lastly, positive-negative both samples based. We represented
the datasets along with a short description, Characteristics of them, and relevant reference links. This article will help
future researchers to find the COVID-19 detection research datasets easily and it will save their time.
