Abstract
The rise of social media has ignited an unprecedented circulation of false
information in our society. It is even more evident in times of crises, such as
the COVID-19 pandemic. Fact-checking efforts have expanded greatly and have
been touted as among the most promising solutions to fake news, especially in
times like these. Several studies have reported the development of fact-checking
organizations in Western societies, albeit little attention has been given to the
Global South. Here, to fill this gap, we introduce a novel Markov-inspired computational method for identifying topics in tweets. In contrast to other topic
modeling approaches, our method clusters topics and their current evolution in
a predefined time window. Through these, we collected data from Twitter accounts of two Brazilian fact-checking outlets and presented the topics debunked
by these initiatives in fortnights throughout the pandemic. By comparing these
organizations, we could identify similarities and differences in what was shared
by them. Our method resulted in an important technique to cluster topics in a
wide range of scenarios, including an infodemic – a period overabundance of the
same information. In particular, the data clearly revealed a complex intertwining between politics and the health crisis during this period. We conclude by
proposing a generic model which, in our opinion, is suitable for topic modeling
and an agenda for future research.

1. Introduction
On September 3rd, 2018, Fabiane Maria de Jesus, a young woman in her
early thirtieth, could never imagine she would never return home after a church
? This is a pre-print version of the full article available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.

service. She died at the hands of a lynch mob driven by a series of vicious online
rumors on the outskirts of Guarujá, a small coastal city in São Paulo, Brazil.
Her death was motivated by the suspicion that Ms. Fabiane was connected
to child abductions in the region thought to be linked to black magic rituals.
However, investigations showed that the rumors were false. It all began with a
post on Facebook that alerted local residents of a woman kidnapping children
in the region to use them in witchery rituals. A tragic end for Ms. Fabiane
shows the potential that disinformation has on social media[1].
Better known as fake news, the emergence of various forms of harmful content
are many perils of social media that users can, even unconsciously, encounter in
the online ecosystem[2]. The nature of information disorder of fake news makes
it overlaps with other concepts that arose from the fabricated information that
tends to mimic news content. In fact, fake news can take many shapes, it is
therefore needed to distinguish between ‘misinformation’ and ‘disinformation.’
The first represents the claims that are false connected or inaccurate information, while the latter describes false information that is purposely spread to
deceive people[3]. In the case of Ms. Fabiane, we can call that misinformation
happened, once people shared the news that seemed accurate at the time but
they later found it was made up. However, there are other situations where
disinformation behaviors happen when an individual has intentional actions to
purposely mislead people. Thus, false information has real consequences, which
makes it a relevant subject for study. This is especially true for troubled times
that serve as nourishment for fake news[4]. The coronavirus pandemic has given
a tremendous increase to this issue on social media networks. By taking root
in a critical juncture filled with uncertainties and fears, the exploitation of the
COVID-19 crisis has generated an excessive amount of information about a
problem. Consequently, we also need to fight against the proliferation of false
information about the topics related to the virus. This ’infodemic’ “can hamper an effective public health response and create confusion and distrust among
people”[5]. Furthermore, the decline in public trust in the media and the current political situation in a state of great flux around the world have even more
notoriety to fake news[6].
There is no simple antidote to fake news. To face this problem, fact-checking
became an important mechanism to fight falseness and information with the
intent to harm[6]. The rise of several fact-checking initiatives in recent years
has shown the importance of debunking “widely circulating claims online”[7].
However, conflicts in the logics that guide the operation of these sites have also
been challenged by accusations of political bias[8] and lack of clarity on what is
being assessed by these initiatives, which shows the importance of understanding
what topics actually are covered by these organizations. On the other hand,
fact-checks can give a hint of what type of horrors lurk inside social networks.
Several studies have shown the development of fact-checking organizations in
Western societies but little attention has been given to Global South[9]. Special
attention is necessary to address the dissemination of fake news in this region,
where the rise of leaders like Jair Bolsonaro (Brazil), Daniel Ortega (Nicaragua),
Rodrigo Duterte (Philippines), and Nicolas Maduro (Venezuela) reveals that au2

tocratic populism can thrive in a wide range of environments to the propagation
of rumors or false information, posing a global threat to democracy[10, 11]. To
address this gap, this study analyzes the trend based on a topic modeling approach to understand what was covered during the pandemic based on different
fact-checking organizations. Therefore, in this study, we consider Brazil because
even with the pandemic taking the media agenda in the world, the country has
entered into a period of strong political instability, which makes the country
even more susceptible to fake news campaigns[9, 12].
Drawing on a literature review of communication and computer science,
we employed in this study a mixture of quantitative and qualitative methods
including time-series analysis, topic modeling, and trend analysis. Through an
original computational method inspired by Markov chains, we identify the “fake
news” trends in Twitter accounts of Brazilian fact-checking organizations to
further understand the rumors and false information that arose during the first
half of the global health crisis. In this process, we also qualitatively analyzed
the clusters to identify the topics that emerged in the time span defined by the
authors.
Our contribution here is twofold to academic scholarship. First, we propose
an innovative method that clusters topics based on an established time span.
Second, we use this model to identify the topics that emerged in this extremely
complex period known by an overabundance of the same information, also referred to as an infodemic, in a country that is facing a populist government,
which makes it even more relevant. To show the usefulness of the proposed
method, we focus our experimental investigation on tweets that were crawled
of the timelines of the two major fact-checking initiatives in Brazil during the
first half of the 2020 global health crisis.
Our approach tackles the abuse of social media along three dimensions: a
better understanding of the debunks of the fact-checking initiatives during this
period; the noisy points in the process by measuring the discrepancy between
political and pandemic agendas; and also a correlation between the themes that
were covered by these two initiatives to detect topic repetition and characterize
the dissemination of false news information during this time frame.
RQ1: What are the topics that fact-checking initiatives covered during the
pandemic? And how are these topics related between these two organizations?
RQ2: How is the evolution of political topics intertwined with the pandemic
crisis?
RQ3: What are the challenges to map topics in a period of overload of information on the same issue?
The results obtained through the proposed method provide answers to the
questions above and also our methodology is not restricted to this topic (fake
news). The article is organized as follows. First, we propose a theoretical
background to understand the importance of fact-checking initiatives and fake
news in the media ecosystem. Second, we contextualize the situation of the
pandemic in relation to the dissemination of false information and rumors to
later introduce the relatedness of the Brazilian political agenda in this matter.
Third, we describe our method to approach the problem. Fourth, we discuss
3

the results relating to the evolution of false information and the influence of
the political agenda during the health crisis. Last, we include some concluding
remarks and further research issues.
2. Related Work
2.1. Fact-checking: a task force to fight fake news
The Internet has given everyone a voice, but many feel entitled to use these
voices to spread false or misleading information. Consequently, the effect of
propagation of misinformation, disinformation, and propaganda has recently
been amplified due to the unprecedented increase in access to social media access. Ostensibly popularized as ‘fake news,’ and widely questioned in academia
and the industry as it was used as a political weapon, this type of content predates the development of technology and social media and brings a range of
meanings that have been associated with it [4], such as destroying the credibility and trust of journalism as well as articulating and popularizing a political
ideology.
Previous studies have emphasized the strategies behind the dissemination
of this content[13]. The reasons behind go from money interest to political
weapon, but the main purpose is to deceive the public [6]. As has been previously reported in the literature, the efforts to misinform or disinform the public
is understood by the financial motivation within the fake news chain from where
it starts (upstream) to where and how it spreads (downstream). For example,
research has provided evidence for the inadvertent funding granted to disinformation websites from programmatic advertising[14, 15]. Furthermore, fake news
relied on the platforms and their business models to gain traction by offering
tools to actively promote dissemination and monetize content[3].
Fake news has primarily drawn attention during the 2016 U.S. presidential
election and became a constant problem, which made organizations look for
ways to mitigate it[16]. One of the most popular forms to address the prevalence of fake news has been fact-checking. The practice is defined by assessing
the validity of claims made by institutions or public people “to identify whether
a claim is factual”[12]. The idea behind this is to provide information to improve public discourse. Consequently, fact-checking organizations claim that
they are nonpartisan and non-political entities. Thus, these initiatives establish
a clear institutionalization to become more credible and acquire the professional
prestige of the audience as a form to clarify their intention to become antidotes
to misinformation.
Besides that, a close examination of scholarly literature has shown ambiguity about the efficacy of fact-checking [17, 9, 12]. While some studies have
pointed out that political interest and ideology play a key role leading to a
failure of fact-checking, others argue that debunks influence people’s receptiveness to trust a source. Furthermore, the efficacy of fake news is contested by
motivated reasoning and also preexisting beliefs that play a major role in determining the way information is processed. That happens because fact-checking

4

organizations navigate in a “tricky terrain”[12], discussing complex and often
contradictory information whilst attempting to bring knowledge to the general
public. Furthermore, there is an increasing polarization in online social media
that has been gaining scholarly attention in recent years amid the changing
political landscapes of many parts of the world. These polarized communities share a common narrative, which is empirically observed in the existence
of echo chambers, stimulating the confirmation bias, i.e., the information confirming their beliefs even if containing false claims[18]. Prior research suggests
that in these groups, fact-checking corrections often fail to lessen misperceptions
within an ideological group[19]. Also, studies documented numerous situations
of a “backfire effect” in which these fact-checking debunks or corrections actually
strengthen misperceptions amid these groups[19, 20, 21].
In fact, political ideology plays a major role in determining how fact-checking
is processed by individuals[22]. Therefore, fact-checking reporting is usually accused of political bias, as readers believe that some candidates are likely to
be more scrutinized than their counterparts. To overcome this, many organizations appeal to social-scientific approaches to selecting claims to avoid perceived
bias[23]. Even so, important differences persist between topics that are covered
by distinct initiatives, which reinforces the impression of bias.
However, many fact-checking initiatives exist with limited resources as they
are yet small and employ few people that are insufficient compared to the scale
of the fake news industry. Hence, there is a delay of approximately 13h between
the consumption of fake news stories and its verifications. Thus, fact-checking
lags behind misinformation and disinformation in terms of overall reach and
response time[24]. Still, to this date, the debate on how to improve the efficacy
of fact-checking is far from resolved and all information is needed to come to a
high-quality debunking decision.
Additionally, fact-checking has its peak during political events, such as elections or campaigns[25]. Scholarly studies have shown that people tend to share
at a faster speed more false information on Twitter than other platforms, especially political topics[26, 27]. In 2020, it was marked by a particular unique
shock when the COVID-19 pandemic killed hundreds of thousands of people and
forced all of us into social isolation, similarly to the period of elections when
fact-checking is needed most[28]. The health crisis has shown that individuals
are more likely to be exposed to misinformation or disinformation[29] and the
importance of fact-checking to debunk these claims. Thus, the power of fake
news encounters in its ability to penetrate social spheres [4].
2.2. Computational Social Science and Twitter
Since the escalating notoriety of online social media platforms and the emergence of computational science, more and more researchers from a range of
distinct areas have begun to examine social phenomena using large scale humangenerated data computationally. Within this conjuncture, Twitter has become
an indispensable social communication platform by offering many contrasting
views and cultures on miscellaneous topics[30]. Indeed, a large number of existing studies in the broader literature took the opportunity of this platform to
5

examine and get a better understanding of the interactions between individuals
and their environment[30].
Recent progress in various disciplines, such as mathematics and computer
science, and particularly a subset of areas, such as network analysis, computational linguistics, and statistics have given a variety of tools to better understand
social media content. By tracking, modeling, analyzing, and using mining techniques, scholars could grasp meanings out of the complexity of social media
data[31]. The social network approach has given a valuable method to explain
the way that information travels and how users put themselves at the intersections of routes where information flows[32]. In fact, some studies argue that
social networks are not always the most effective methods to identify collective
action efforts[33].
On the other hand, numerous methods have been developed to map the collective sentiment of tweets[34], such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine
(SVM), linear classifier, and maximum entropy. These algorithms intend to
classify tweets into positive, negative, or neutral[35]. Yet, another study approached the sentiment of tweets based on hashtags and emojis by manually
labeling 12 categories that were then used to identify the users’ perceptions of
these messages[36].
Another prominent area of study in computational social science is the trend
and time-series analysis. A recent study analyzed in Facebook the evolution of
rumors that related the pandemic outbreak to the rollout of 5G broadband
technology using the time-series analysis to understand the evolution of this
disinformation throughout the time analyzed[37]. Despite this study, false information has spread to all social media platforms, and Twitter has become an
increasingly popular social network to study the evolution of the pandemic. To
illustrate this, deniers of the pandemic used the hashtag #FilmYourHospital on
Twitter to encourage users to visit hospitals and hinder the work of physicians
and nurses in the middle of a health crisis to take pictures to “prove” that the
COVID-19 pandemic is an elaborate hoax[38]. In fact, several methods to predict the trends of news topics on Twitter have emerged in recent years[39]. For
example, prior work has applied trend analysis methods, such as the Moving
Average Convergence-Divergence (MACD) indicator, to understand the news
topics that were trending at the moment and could potentially become popular
on Twitter[40].
Similarly, topic modeling became increasingly popular on social networks.
Many sources give methodological guidance on how to apply LDA topic modeling on news articles, for instance, on temporal analysis of climate change articles
published between 1997 and 2016[41]. However, the application of the LDA algorithm in tweets was reported in the literature that may not work well because
the text corpus is short[42, 43]. To overcome this, a study has used a fetched
category from news articles to compare the classification of tweets using Naive
Bayes and SVM algorithms, and concluded the latter is more effective[44]. Other
studies proposed to aggregate tweets as a single document. An example of this
is the technique to group together tweets occurring in the same user-to-user
conversation and use a combination of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and
6

the Author-Topic Model (ATM) to determine topics in tweets[45].
In the same vein, existing studies in the broader literature have examined the
applicability of LDA in Twitter messages to detect fake news. By analyzing the
main topics of the messages with reliable sources, such as magazines and news
portals, it helped to identify false information disseminated in tweets[46]. Another method introduced was the combination of sentiment analysis with topic
modeling. In it, the authors extracted the sentiment from replies or retweets
to analyze the general opinion on topics and assist LDA in the classification of
fake news[47, 48].
A recent study used sentiment analysis and LDA to analyze tweets and
concluded that there is a wide range of automated accounts that were disseminating content on Twitter. For instance, in a set of 29 million tweets, the
authors found that 21% of the accounts were bots and, consequently, 30% of
these tweets. However, it is not clear whether the implications of bots are always negative on social networking sites, once there are automated accounts
that share reliable information[49].
Other methods were also proposed to detect false information on social media content without topic modeling algorithms, such as Principal Component
Analysis – PCA[50] and Statistical Relational Learning – SRL[51]. PCA is a
technique to extract features and in general, used to eliminate irrelevant information. In this case, it applied to identify rumors and false content. In the
same vein, SRL combines machine learning and data mining to detect noisy,
missing, or partially observed information[46].
Despite these studies showing good results, a number of questions regarding
the evolution of fake news agenda in time remain to be addressed. Furthermore,
there is no solution to curb fake news at the moment. As technology spawned
the dilemma of fake news, it is tempting to assume that technology can solve
it. In this context, scholars proposed a range of strategies to curb the dissemination of false information on social media, for instance, focusing on the role of
network polarization[52]. In addition, artificial intelligence (AI) solutions have
been particularly effective in detecting and removing dubious or undesirable
content online. On the other hand, scholars raised concerns about the accuracy and transparency of AI by placing responsibility for technology to detect
and tag what is false content on social media platforms[53]. Methodology-wise,
combining computational methods and human analysis provides a more effective
way to explore such information in social media[54].
2.3. From a health crisis to a political firestorm: How Brazil is handling the
outbreak
The newness of the COVID-19 virus means that no one has yet been able to
understand the etiology of the pandemic. This has caused many uncertainties
and fears in the population. To make matters worse, as the COVID-19 pandemic
made landfall in every continent, fake news ramped up on just about every
platform, causing widespread fear and confusion. The furor over fake news has
intensified long-standing concerns in this fragmented media environment that
is seen in society today, with many sources of information. Furthermore, online
7

rumors and political lying are other concerns that have exacerbated this fake
news scenario [16].
This mix of facts, fears, rumors, and speculations has characterized the
pandemic and provided fertile ground for the dissemination of misleading information and cybercrime on the Internet[55, 56]. Considering that fake news
that “spreads faster and more easily than”[5] a virus, this became a concern
during the pandemic. For all that, the World Health Organization (WHO) has
declared that false information shared on social media about COVID-19 is an
“infodemic” that must tackle alongside the pandemic itself and the concern over
the problem is global.
But apart from this issue, some heads of state stand apart for their continued denials of the threat the pandemic poses. To illustrate this, leaders of
Belarus (Alexander Lukashenko), the USA (Donald Trump), and Brazil (Jair
Bolsonaro) use their position to deny the global movement to fight the pandemic
and described the illness as a “little flu,” or promoting a medicine (hydroxychloroquine) as a cure for the illness, despite growing scientific evidence against
the efficacy of the malaria drug[57, 58]. In a scenario where official information is understood as unreliable, the climate is set for the viral dissemination of
unproven rumors and speculations [59].
In this environment, not everything is false, some “emerging, albeit unverified, information might be valuable, and deleting it would cause harm”[59]. In
fact, the effects of this factually dubious content produced with no regard for
accuracy or fairness that mimics the format of journalism in the public remain
to be addressed [3]. On the other hand, it also made more evident than ever the
fundamental importance of fact-checking initiatives in periods of crisis, mainly
where politicians made a complicated landscape for citizens. In Brazil, the
political scenario has created many uncertainties and fears in the population.
The systematic violation of access to information and transparency during the
coronavirus pandemic made by the Brazilian Federal Government has failed to
mitigate the impacts of the pandemic on the population [29, 60]. Consequently,
major legacy media organizations teamed up to provide transparency of daily
coronavirus death tolls and infection rates to citizens[61].
In the same vein, fact-checking initiatives play a crucial role in debunking and verifying information that is disseminated in social media in Brazil.
Some organizations in the country target politicians exclusively but others focus mainly on correcting mistakes in the media or even in niche areas, such as
fact-checking of religious content posted by Christian personalities, especially
politicians and influencers in social media platforms [62]. Among the most
recognizable fact-checking organizations in Brazil are Agência Lupa and Aos
Fatos[63, 64]. Besides being the major producers of fact-checking stories, these
organizations are committed to the transparency standard of the International
Fact-Checking Network (IFCN), an alliance that abides by promoting excellence
in fact-checking[65]. Whereas most fact-checkers in the United States have ties
to a news outlet, internationally fewer than half do[66], what it is exactly the
case of these two organizations that have their entire operation focused on debunking information propagated in social media platforms. Furthermore, these
8

two initiatives have a huge impact on social media, for example on Twitter,
Agência Lupa has more than 181K people following their content, while Aos
Fatos counts with 238K followers (as of November 2020).
Our analysis deals only with these two organizations that came about due to
the huge demand for rigorously verified information, with public and transparent
data that gained evidence in the last years. Thus, this study wants to uncover
features and issues that were debunked during the pandemic to test an original
method to evaluate the trends of fake news topics on Twitter based on a Markovinspired model. A comprehensive description of methods and data has been
provided to support our results in the next section.
3. Data and methods
Beyond electoral impacts, it is still restricted what we know about the effects
of fake news content in periods of crisis, similar to the COVID-19 health crisis.
From increasing cynicism and apathy about the health crises to encouraging
extremism with false statements, this article studies the topics that have risen
up the agenda during this period. There exists little evaluation of the trends
of fake news in these regards, and also a computational method to identify
these topics properly. To address this gap, this study proposes a comprehensive
method that provides a nicely integrated solution to identify these trends in a
time-series analysis.
3.1. Data description
To investigate the evolution of fact-checking trends during the pandemic
and understand how the political agenda has influenced the fake-news agenda,
we analyzed tweets from Brazilian fact-checking accounts. Instead of a simple
topic modeling, we propose a method that clusters the topics and its evolution in an established time. To address this phenomenon, this article relies on
the open Twitter application programming interface (API) connection to crawl
the timelines of the two major fact-checking agencies in Brazil, @aosfatos and
@agencialupa. In total, these accounts account for 5115 tweets from January to
July 2020.
We concentrate on two fact-checking organizations, and we do not investigate the numerous other smaller initiatives existing in the platform because
the number of tweets produced by them during the period was not enough to
be considered in this study. Nevertheless, because our samples include activities of the most prominent fact-checking organizations, we can draw consistent
inferences about our method and the questions proposed by this research piece.
We retrieved the tweets and metadata related to these accounts to assemble
the pool of data for our computational method. This choice is made because
these organizations posted the most tweets related to fact-checking content over
the course of the period appraised. Also, as mentioned before, these organizations are well embedded in a set of historically rooted values, traditions, and
norms that shaped the fact-checking process. Other initiatives were considered but their number of tweets was not enough to compute effective temporal
9

features. After devised compilation and cleansing, data is further used in our
computational model.
3.2. Data preparation
Literature has shown different approaches for topic modeling, such as Latent
Dirichlet Allocation – LDA[67] and Latent Semantic Analysis – LSA[68] and also
best practices that yield more coherent topic-bags[69]. However, these models
are independent of time, and to overcome this issue, other algorithms are used
to obtain this temporal information, such as DDTM (Discrete-time Dynamic
Topic Model), CDTM (Continuous-time Dynamic Topic Model), ToT (Topics
over Time), and TAM (Trend Analysis Model). However, these models also deal
with the limitation of the complexity of variational inference or there is a need
to delimit the number of topics beforehand[70]. To address this gap, we derive
a novel algorithm that analyzes tweets in the fortnightly tide by clustering the
output inspired by Markov chains[71]. We made the decision to divide into
fortnights because that encompasses an ideal number of functional units that
can be formed as a community (or cluster).
Due to the nature of Twitter data, there is a lot of noise among words.
Preprocessing of tweets is still a popular technique to help in this procedure. It
is a common task for text normalization and almost every task related to natural
language processing (NLP) to apply some kind of tokenization, stemming, and
lemmatization. In our case, the tokenization is performed in the context of
graphs that were generated to represent the tweets. The purpose of stemming
and lemmatization is to lessen inflectional forms and sometimes derivationally
similar modes of a word to a common base form. However, the Portuguese
language has its own particular characteristics. Lemmatization considers the
syntactic classification of words, presenting, for instance, different lemmas for a
verb or a noun (in the same word family). In English, this nuance is different,
once the same lemma can assume multiple syntactic categories. Instead, in
Portuguese, and other romance languages, it is of predominant importance, and
changes the meaning of the sentence. In practice, many exceptions to these
same rules frustrate the goal of achieving an accuracy close to 100% in most of
the romance languages[72].
An example, the word campeão (champion) in singular and campeões (champions) in the plural to extract the end of these two words includes many exceptions that do not necessarily fit the typical case for one option or another
and result in an impossible task for computers to perform. Stemming is easier to implement, usually refers to a crude heuristic process that chops off the
ends of words. However, it discards possibly valuable information, by making it
practically difficult to identify, for instance, a noun from a verb in its stemmed
form[72]. Thus, due to the complexity of this task for the Portuguese language
and at the risk of losing sight of the main point of the tweet, our algorithm does
not include lemmatization and stemming processes in the pre-processing phase.
On the other hand, we decided to first map all threads and treated each
of them as a single tweet to encompass the same topic. To be able to achieve
it, the tweets that were posted in the time interval of fewer than two minutes
10

were aggregated into a single one. Known as Twitter threads, it is a series
of connected tweets from one account and usually contains the same sort of
elements. This was an important step to enrich the vocabulary of a certain
topic and guarantee that neither the content would remain separated. Secondly,
a pre-processing step consisted of eliminating stop words and punctuation signs.
We additionally removed the “RT” from the retweets, mentions, and hashtags.
We also evaluate the impact of different models of lexicons for the Portuguese
language and the effect of pre-processing techniques for the task and mapped the
common words that are not relevant and appear in our dataset to be removed.
LDA and LSA algorithms were used to help in the process, as these algorithms use probabilistic models to extract latent bags of words or topics in a
document. We run a number of times these algorithms, which did not present
good results in the clusterization process, but they served along with our model
in the optimization of the pre-processing phase. Likewise, after evaluating and
deleting the terms and expressions that are common by these fact-checking
agencies, such as “We verified” and “This is false,” we prepare our data for the
application of our method based on graphs. Other specific and popular terms
in this specific context, such as coronavirus and COVID-19, were also removed
to help in the clustering process. To illustrate the preprocessing model, a tweet
in our dataset was like this one:
• NO AR. OMS não orientou evitar sexo com animais para se prevenir do
coronavı́rus. (LIVE. WHO did not guide to avoid sex with animals to
prevent from coronavirus, in English) https://aosfatos.org/noticias/omsn... #CoronaV irusF acts
After the preprocessing, it should have been coded in that way:
• OMS ORIENTOU EVITAR SEXO ANIMAIS PREVENIR (WHO GUIDE
AVOID SEX ANIMALS PREVENT, in English)
3.3. Markov chains and topic modeling
Markov chains are widely applied in various fields, such as economics, finance, sports, and even are applicable to on our daily routine, such as typing in smartphones, where the device predicts what one is going to type next.
However, the model has not “yet been widely implemented in communication
research”[73]. Unlike the conventional view of classifying tweets, like LDA,
Markov chains use a stochastic approach that is formally equivalent to the equations for steady-state probabilities.
Here we develop a network that is inspired in a Markov chain[74], our
method that generates a graph G = (V, E) that is composed of vertices V =
v1 , v2 , v3 . . . vn that represent the words of a tweet and the edges E = e1 , e2 , e3 . . . em
are the connections between these words. As each tweet, with n = |V | vertices and m = |E| edges, involves a sequence of words, our graph here is directed, thus, it respects the text structure. Furthermore, each E has a weight
W = w1 , w2 , w3 . . . wm that represents how many times these two words were
connected in the dataset, as shown in figure 1.The importance of directed graphs

Figure 1: Example of a directed graph based on the pre-processed tweet: “OMS ORIENTOU
EVITAR SEXO ANIMAIS PREVENIR”

in our methods lies in generating the right knowledge to form the sequence of
processed words in the tweets. For example, “Flavio” (subject) and “steal” is
not the same as “steal” and “Flavio” that is the reason a directed graph is necessary to maintain the ideas that a sentence shares. Similarly, it is the relation
in Twitter, one person follows someone that does not necessarily follow the same
person back[30].
Besides that, cycles were not considered in this method, once words that
are feeding themselves do not bring extra information to our topic modeling
approach. Weighted graphs are a more informative graph, which tells the probability of visiting the next node or maybe the distance of a node to another
or maybe the dependency of one node over the other[74, 75]. Once the graph
is built, a community detection method highlights the main communities of
the network and, consequently, the topics. The graph was constructed using
tweets within a certain time window. Specifically, after a careful investigation
of distinct time resolution (days, weeks, and a month), we observe that, for the
scenario considered in this investigation, a time window of two weeks, i.e., 15
days. This number was decided based on experiments to obtain a representative
sample of tweets of each organization that could be evaluated by our algorithm.
In fact, it was also noted through our experiments that the major topics of
the dataset remained in this time span. The method is then applied for tweets
within each interval, thus, each graph was composed of the words (V ) and the
connection between them (E). To provide an intuitive understanding of the
algorithm proposed here, we described the steps conducted below:
• After pre-processing, each tweet that is loaded, vi are added to the graph.
In case, a word is already on the graph, it is not added.
• The tweet is read from left to right (the same way that we read) and for
each pair of words that are subsequent in the dataset, an ei is added with
weight 1. Again, in case the edge already exists, no other edge is added,
but the weight increases by 1.
12

• This process happens until all tweets are loaded in the graph.
As a result, the obtained graph is a subset of the dataset that conforms to a time
span. Thus, simple, cost-effective measures could be found, such as the degree
of any vertices and the weights of any edges, which reveals some important
information about the dataset. To put it another way, in many fortnights, the
top five heaviest edges were related to the main topics found during the study
period. After that, the graph is clustered, which we used an edge-clustering
framework that can group the heaviest edges into bundles to reduce the overall
edge crossings.
Furthermore, we ran our method a couple of times to detect possible words
that could be merged in the pre-processing phase. For instance, in our initial
analysis, we identified that the edges with higher weight represent compound
names, such as city or states’ names (Rio de Janeiro) or important figures (Jair
Bolsonaro or Sérgio Moro). Indeed, this was an important step to return to
our data preparation. In many cases, pre-processing is not a single operation.
Instead, pre-processing is an entire pipeline composed of many phases to achieve
an optimal formulation.
In our graph, we relied on a Python library igraph that provides different
types of clustering methods. In an echo of scholarly literature, we selected the
walktrap algorithm, as it delivers the correct number of communities regardless of network sizes[76]. Walktrap approach based on random walks, i.e., run
unsystematically the graph, thus, the walks are more likely to stay within the
same community because there are only a few edges that lead outside a given
community, which result in more precision in the topic modeling. Consequently,
our graph could identify clusters of tweets that were closely linked with each
other, thus determining a topic. For each graph, we qualitatively analyzed the
clusters to observe the different topics. Regarding community detection, any
method that is suitable for directed networks would work in our case. As a
methodological choice, walktrap is a method that we are used to and we have
a certain domain about it. Other community detection methods would work as
well in our algorithm.
Our time-series analysis divided the period into fortnights and generated the
clusters of the five major clusters for each individual period to obtain meaningful
information on the evolution of the topics covered by the organizations during
the time assessed. Since classifying the clusters would involve a considerable
manual effort, we prioritized the annotation of the five major clusters, once
those groups usually represent a larger number of tweets. We also limited the
number of topics to the five major communities, as we would like to visualize
it through figure 3 and 5, which were produced using the ggplot2 library in R.
Furthermore, topics that were closely related or too small were not considered,
thus reducing the number of topics in a certain time span.
Another important point is that to better visualize the communities, we
decided to adopt a word cloud to represent each community. In it, the words
represent the vertices and their weight. Hence, it gives greater prominence to
vertices with higher weight, the ones that were more frequently used in that

cluster. Lastly, it is worth mentioning that the smallest clusters were threads
or one single tweet that was not relevant for this study. Thus, we created word
clouds of the most connected vertices (filtered above 10 degrees), as shown in
figure 2.
We also observe in our results the presence of clusters in specific languages.
Although the fact-checking organizations use Portuguese in their tweets, some
retweets were in English or Spanish. As the process of creation of the graph connects related words, it is natural that words in the same language present more
connection between them than in other languages. Thus, it is easily detected as
a cluster by our algorithm. One disadvantage of the most traditional methods,
such as LSA and LDA that are probabilistic methods (related to the frequency
of a word in relation to its neighbor), is that the precision depends on the size
of the dataset and lexical diversity. The method here proposed is instead designed to be not influenced by these factors, once it considers the connection

14

of the words contained in tweets in relation to the dataset. The quantity of
topics is also another strength as it does not need to be previously established.
However, by adopting a rigid clustering system, there is a risk that the clusters
formed will be a thread or a single tweet. This level of adjustment also allows
better control of the topics found. In the process of labeling our clusters, we
identified 23 codes in the whole dataset, which includes Federal Government
(topics related to the Presidential Government), Politics (in general), Health,
and also topics that were related to COVID-19 associated with other areas like
COVID-19 – Dissemination or COVID-19 – Treatment (see more in Table 1 and
2). By applying the method here described, we could identify the topics and
the patterns that were covered by fact-checking agencies during the first half of
2020 and were described next.
4. Results
Our results are divided into three parts, each of them dedicated to answering
a research question. The first part is dedicated to present the topics that were
covered during the 2020 pandemic and the validity of our computational method
(RQ1). In the second part, we analyze the evolution of the political agenda
during the pandemic and how it is intertwined with the health crisis(RQ2).
Last, we describe the main challenges that arose to identify topics in a period
of infodemic (RQ3).
4.1. Fact-checking shows the evolution of false information
In order to address RQ1, we present first our findings to the fake news
topics that have been debunked or explained by the organization here examined.
In response to the COVID-19 crisis and the infodemic, there have been great
efforts put into informing the public of the pandemic and its surroundings. The
impact of COVID-19 is affecting the way that organizations address immediate
and strategic people issues. During the first semester of 2020, Brazilian factchecking organizations have used social media to combat the spread of false
information about the COVID-19 pandemic, which mirrors recently released
studies about efforts to tackle misinformation problems via social platforms[77,
78]. Therefore, the structure of our computational model provides a unique
framework to interpret the evolution of fact-based information based on the
response to the proliferation of misinformation and disinformation online. To
validate this, we conduct a brief preliminary round, checking manually random
tweets per fortnight.
The clusters obtained using our algorithm are shown in Tables 1 and 2. To
illustrate this, we also summarize here the relevant results. False information
about the dissemination of the virus, such as pets could transmit COVID-19
and a photo of a wet food market from Indonesia shared as it was in China’s
Wuhan were debunked. Also, forms of prevention, such as lemon, orange, fennel, and bicarbonate were spread as forms to protect from coronavirus disease.
Another community that our method identified described the rumors and false

news about the register of death and over-notification. Also, political topics
have also arisen and been developed during this period. Due to the fact that
Bolsonaro and his peers disseminated information that was deemed fake or distorted during the pandemic[79], we decided to group them in a category different
from “politics.” This was important to show the pandemic has also been influenced by major political and institutional dysfunctions, which will be discussed
more in the next section.

Figure 3: Trends of fake news topics by fortnights (Q1–Q2/2020)

Our algorithm has shown the similarities and differences in the working
of fact-checking initiatives to disprove rumors and combat disinformation. A
better picture of the evolution of these trends is shown in figure 3. In it, the
topics are colored according to the organization, being Aos Fatos in blue and
Agência Lupa in red. When a topic is covered by the two organizations at
the same time, the gray color is used and is represented by a bar of double
size. Furthermore, the flows between one bar and another represent the topics
that continued to be debunked in the following month. In this way, we clearly
18

illustrate the continuity of the topics in the time span.
During fortnight 1, both organizations focused a great part of their work on
fact-checking statements about the Australian bushfires and the US-Iran crisis,
and also related to public policies, such as the water supply in Rio de Janeiro.
Moving to fortnight 2, the Federal Government has gained increasing attention
from both organizations. In fortnight 3, our model did not find any major topic
that was common to the two initiatives.
From fortnight 4, which includes the two last weeks of February when the
first case was reported in Brazil, the discussions about pandemic dominated
social media conversations, which provided insight into the fake news spread in
online social networks about the COVID-19. The forms of prevention and dissemination were frequently debunked during the whole time considered. These
organizations fact-check statements by public figures, major institutions, and
other widely circulated claims of interest to society, thus, economy, politics,
and Federal Government were also topics that were covered by these two organizations in the same time period. The only exception is during fortnight 4
when Carnival happened, thus, these organizations verified information about
leisure activities, such as false information that glitter can damage the health
and funding costs for Carnival.
The pandemic crisis is intertwined with uncertainty over the future and a
complicated landscape for citizens. This is explained by tapping into topics that
cover Federal Government, transparency, and local decisions related to COVID19 that appeared in our results. There is some fundamental coincidence between
these topics in fortnight 12, 9, and 8, respectively. Also, during fortnight 8,
politics appeared related to the 2020 pandemic flooded by fake news about
supposed empty coffins that were being buried, which induced the population
to panic.
A closer look at the literature on fact-checking and fake news argues that the
repetition of debunks makes it more believable by the public, however, reveals
a number of gaps and shortcomings[80, 6]. Several fact-checking initiatives
around the globe to probe the veracity of news stories in social media but no
previous research has investigated if these organizations tend to debunk different
stories or are almost exclusively focused on diversifying their content. To better
understand the commonalities in the coverage of the different themes that are
found in the stories of these two organizations and look for repetition in these
topics, we discuss the correlation between the trends that were mapped through
their data.
Based on the 23 topics found in the time-series analysis of these two factchecking initiatives, we verified if the same theme emerged in the same time span
during the course of the period examined. To this end, a Spearman’s correlation,
formally referred to as Spearman’s rho, was run to determine the relationship
between these topics. Opting for the Spearman correlation is because it is based
on the ranked values for each variable rather than the raw data, and also these
variables tend to change together, but not necessarily at a constant rate. Also,
this correlation is used to assess relationships involving ordinal variables and not
linear relationships between two continuous variables, which would require the
19

Pearson correlation. By applying Spearman’s correlation on the ranked values
based on the time when it was covered, we could find the relationships between
the topics not exclusively when it happens but also the lack of this topic in a
certain period of time, which are presented in figure 4.

Figure 4: Correlation between the topics covered during the pandemic

Figure 4 shows only one topic has a strong correlation with the time-series
data. Leisure was common to both fact-checking initiatives in the same period
of time due to the period of the most important event in the country, the
Brazilian Carnival, which happened in the last fortnight of February. The second
strongest correlation is the topic Economy due to the financial crisis that the
country is going through and the polemics involving president Jair Bolsonaro
that have a strong impact on the economy. And it was also the theme of the
third strongest correlation but in this case related to misleading information
about the impact of COVID-19 in the economy. Overall, our studies indicate
that there are overlapping in the coverage areas of these two organizations.
However, in the major part, these initiatives pick and choose what to scrutinize,
limiting their main points of incidence. Also, a few topics last for a very long
time, which does not echo studies that show that the message repetition made
20

it more believable[80, 6].
4.2. Political agenda is used to draw the attention away from the health crisis
Our algorithm demystifies that fact-checking organizations were only overwhelmed by coronavirus misinformation (RQ2). Understanding this phenomenon
is crucial, given the short and long-term effects of fake news not only on individuals and organizations but also on societies and cultures. These organizations
debunk politics and government power and offer a hopeful outline of a world
both free and more democratic, as shown in the literature[6, 9, 23]. When politicians fail on how to translate the scientific evidence into policy and action, it
amplifies the influence of rumors, informal news sources, and fringe journalism.
This raises the importance of understanding change over time in relation to each
case, rather than relying only on a comparison of volumes, and we turn to figure
3 for this.
Furthermore, by uncovering false and misleading information, these factchecking organizations shed light on the influence of politics on the disproportionate rates of illness and death experienced during the COVID-19 situation. A
first observation that highlights the imbalance between fortnights is significant.
The evolution in time shows a continuously growing trend towards misinformation about the dissemination and prevention of COVID-19 but also about
themes related to the Federal Government that did not arise from the pandemic. While in the fortnights 6 and 7 only topics related to COVID-19 were
fact-checked, the following weeks were composed by exposure of stories that
are in the public interest corresponding to mainly Federal Government but also
media, politics, and international affairs but not related to health crises.
This echoes with the political situation in Brazil that helps to explain these
developments. In the due course, the country had three ministers who resigned,
being two of them Health Ministries. Also, in June, the government had even
stopped publishing total numbers of deaths and cases[81]. This shows how
disinformation thrives with political instability and conflict.
Our main approach was to compare relative volumes of different classes by
the organization as shown in figure 5. This illustration shows the topics exposed
by the falseness of claims, dissemination, and prevention have led, followed next
by the Federal Government. Between the two fact-checking outlets, Aos Fatos
have checked more claims related to the government and the president Bolsonaro
than Agência Lupa. This demonstrates how the silence on the influence of
politics and also the shifting focus from deadly virus to politics, law, and jobs is
a matter of serious concern. An example is a fake news story about the former
Brazil’s justice minister, Sergio Moro, when he resigned: a rumor was spread in
social media that citing that the former minister prevented an investigation of
other politicians when he was a judge to tarnish his reputation. Similarly, other
events happened that have shifted the focus away from the pandemic.
Beyond a computational method, we propose in this article to investigate
the interplay between fake news, fact-checking, politics, and the ongoing health
crisis, and to outline the temporal evolution of debunked topics. As shown in
these results, this is particularly important in Brazil, once we show that the
21

political agenda has gained more attention than the health crisis due to the
political actors and institutions in the country. Thus, our finding highlights
that there is a distinct number of topics that were specifically focused on politics and COVID-19, while others were exclusively about politics. Consequently,
it focuses people off the health crisis and keeps going with the disinformation
agenda about politics. A new approach is therefore needed to understand how
fact-checking organizations decide which topics to debunk and the political campaigns that are currently fueling social media platforms with fake news.

Figure 5: Topics covered by these two organizations during the 2020 pandemic crisis

4.3. The infodemic: a very specific scenario
In our work about fact-checking political claims and debunking viral deceptions, we have found a tremendous amount of misinformation on the coronavirus
pandemic. This was expected as the unprecedented COVID-19 crisis triggered
an avalanche of unprecedented challenges both for people and society. In this
context, the restriction to a very specific scenario and model hinders interoperability with other components. Our data shows that the majority of topics
covered are based on the dissemination and prevention of the COVID-19 outbreak. Also, fake news about transparency and treatment dominates the hot
topics that were debunked.
22

These potential contradictions that are created by fake news generate confusion and distrust in society and it can undermine an effective public health
response. This fact also deals with the limitation that infodemic brought by
spreading an excessive amount of information about an issue, which makes it
confusing and hinders to identify a solution (RQ3). Therefore, this is fertile
ground for the dissemination of fake narratives as we identified by the number
of refuted or checked claims by fact-checkers.
Furthermore, our data has shown that some topics lasted longer than others.
Before the first case (since fortnight 2), the fact-checking about dissemination
and prevention have been checked by at least one of the organizations here studied. Although this period has an information overload about the same theme,
this asymmetry does not influence our investigation. The clusters were generated even with an insufficient lexicon coverage, as described by the percentage
of community in relation to the whole dataset in Tables 1 and 1.
These examples show that the use of a computational method based on
Markov chains is more effective than other traditional methods for topic modeling, such as LDA and LSA, which require more lexicon and more corpus. Our
study also provides an opportunity for the examination of relationships between
relative volumes and temporal dynamics, whether across a whole dataset or for
individual Twitter accounts.
5. Discussion and Conclusion
Fake news has existed, still exists, and will continue to exist. The digital
age and the rapid expansion of social media have provided a breeding ground
for the dissemination of misleading and false information. Thus, fake news
became a global phenomenon with no solution on the horizon. Debunks became
a stopgap measure to reduce belief in false claims or prevent the uptake of
misinformation. In fact, the importance of fact-checking initiatives lies in their
ability to uncover and debunk hoaxes on social media platforms to facilitate the
exposure of stories that are in the public interest. These fact-checks are used
as forms to mitigate the spread of harmful misinformation. Collectively, our
results provide a potential mechanism for identifying the fake news topics that
arose during the time span considered.
The findings presented here provide us with first insights into fake news
agenda based on the fact-checking content posted by specialized organizations
on Twitter. Against the wave of speculations and fake news[37], scientific facts
matter. The infodemic has shown presence and allowed it to escalate to a level
that requires a coordinated response. It has triggered an army of fact-checkers
and debunkers worldwide to verify these false or misleading statements. In
Brazil, the fact-checking agencies Lupa and Aos Fatos showed the relevance of
fact-checking in a situation where political decisions remain incongruent to the
global health crises. Their debunks covered not only this infodemic but also a
range of topics that were necessary to address in autocratic populism promoted
by Jair Bolsonaro.

23

Our method has shown the widespread potential to scale up this analysis
from two accounts with 5115 tweets to a broad number of accounts or tweets.
In our analysis of the two major fact-checking organizations in Brazil, we have
found the similarities and differences in what was debunked by these organizations, which shows a different perspective from the existing literature stating
that repetition makes fact-checking more believable [80, 6]. Only a few topics lasted more than one fortnight. Also, this applied to the topics that were
covered during the fortnights and were not continued into the following periods.
The analysis leads to the following conclusions: these organizations do not
necessarily debunk the same topic and also the fact-checking agenda does not
necessarily reflect the situation that currently exists within a country. Furthermore, the literature pertaining to fact-checking practices strongly suggests that
a detailed debunking message when presented to the user repeatedly in varying
time intervals correlated positively with the debunking effect [82, 80, 6]. However, in our study, the fact-checking agencies adopted to cover distinct themes.
This article contributes to a growing corpus of research of fake news by
developing a method that can determine the main characteristic of the fake
news and fact-checking genres that can help news organizations to identify topics
that rose or fell in popularity in the social media platforms and look at unique
ways and angles to tackle this issue. Also, identifying categories that experience
sharp temporal increases during the pandemic is important to set an agenda and
include support for efforts to resolve these issues and identify means of fostering
cooperation between different fact-checking initiatives.
The analysis presented here also suggests that the political agenda has
shifted away from the focus of the health crisis and gave more attention to
the political actors and institutions. An extreme right-wing political agenda
is used to legitimize the leader’s actions and remove the focus from the crisis.
Consequently, politics and pandemic have been intertwined in varying degrees,
which causes continuing difficulties for tackling misinformation. Future studies
should aim to replicate results in a larger set of time to an integrated overview
of pandemic and its evolution over time. Also, our computational method can
be applied to political entities to cluster what they are posting on social media
during these health crises. In addition, future research might automate the time
spans to optimize the division of topics per period.
Although this study is very beneficial to the field, limitations should be
addressed. Unfortunately, there are not enough tweets from other fact-checking
initiatives. We, therefore, concentrate on two major fact-checking organizations,
and we do not investigate the numerous other smaller initiatives existing in the
platform because the number of tweets produced by them during the period was
not enough to be considered in this study. This can be a potential limitation of
this observational cohort study. Future studies should aim to replicate results
in a more substantial dataset, including more organizations and countries. Also,
a different time interval can help to include more fact-checking initiatives that
have less number of tweets.
Last, a critical open question is whether this method is generic and can be
applied not only to tweets but to a different range of datasets with distinct sizes.
24

This experiment adds to a growing corpus of research showing that even with
limited text corpora, we were able to cluster topics. This result shows that our
method has the potential to be applied to other contexts, but future studies
could fruitfully explore this issue.
Fact-checking is an effort to tackle misinformation problems but there is
no one-size-fits-all solution to fake news. But in a period of uncertainty and
almost constantly changing news and new research is added regularly while
much has not yet been discovered, fact-checking provides a service by clarifying
the assessment of a claim by delivering context and background information in
a situation that any little bit makes a difference. The COVID-19 pandemic is
just a reminder about the huge problem of misinformation, disinformation, and
hoaxes that have become part of our lives now.
