Abstract
The temporal growth in the number of deaths in the COVID-19 epidemic is subexponential. Here we show that a
piecewise quadratic law provides an excellent fit during the thirty days after the first three fatalities on January 20 and
later since the end of March 2020. There is also a brief intermediate period of exponential growth. During the second
quadratic growth phase, the characteristic time of the growth is about eight times shorter than in the beginning, which
can be understood as the occurrence of separate hotspots. Quadratic behavior can be motivated by peripheral growth
when further spreading occurs only on the outskirts of an infected region. We also study numerical solutions of a simple
epidemic model, where the spatial extend of the system is taken into account. To model the delayed onset outside China
together with the early one in China within a single model with minimal assumptions, we adopt an initial condition of
several hotspots, of which one reaches saturation much earlier than the others. At each site, quadratic growth commences
when the local number of infections has reached a certain saturation level. The total number of deaths does then indeed
follow a piecewise quadratic behavior.

growth law, it is useful to plot the square root of the number of death, N 1/2 , because this quantity then increases
linearly in such a representation; see Figure 2. We immediately notice the appearance of two subranges, A and B,
with approximately quadratic growth, but different slopes.
Before substantiating the reality of quadratic growth,
we first examine the possibility of exponential growth during early times. In Figure 3, we show a semi-logarithmic
representation for the end of January 2020. We see that,
even at early times, there is no convincing evidence for exponential growth, although it is always possible to identify
an approximately constant slope during short time intervals. The fit shown in Figure 3 for January 22–28 is given
by

2. Quadratic versus exponential growth
Our primary interest is in the number of infections, but
this number is uncertain because it depends on the amount
of tests that are done in each country. A more robust proxy
is the number of deaths. For the data after January 22,
2020, we use the worldometers website1 , while the data
of earlier days can be found on the DEVEX website2 . In
Figure 1, we show the number of infections and the number
of deaths in a semi-logarithmic representation. Following
Brandenburg (2020a), time is here counted as the number
of days after January 20, which he identified as the date
when quadratic growth commenced. Specifically, he found
Nfit (t) = [(t−Jan 20)/0.7 days]2 (quadratic fit). (1)

Nfit (t) = exp[(t − t0 )/τ ]

This means that every 0.7 days, the square root of N
changes by one. Such an increase is much slower than
an exponential one, where instead the logarithm of N
changes by one during one characteristic time. To illuminate the quadratic growth in more detail, we consider an example for January 30. In that case, Equation (1) predicted Nfit = (10/0.7)2 = 204, so 0.7 days
1/2
later, Nfit changed by one (from 14.3 to 15.3) and therefore Nfit = (10.7/0.7)2 = 234, corresponding to an increase
of N by 30. On February 20, i.e., 31 days after January 20,
the formula predicted Nfit = (31/0.7)2 = 1960, so 0.7 days
later, Nfit = (31.7/0.7)2 = 2050 has increased by 90. This
gives us a sense of the way N increased. These numbers
agree quite well with the actual ones.
Real data never agree perfectly with any particular
mathematical growth law. It is therefore important to
quantify the accuracy of any such a description. To assess the accuracy of a description in terms of a quadratic

analogous to the exponential fit, but the meaning of τ is
different; see Table 2 for the parameters of the quadratic
fits. The residual of Equation (3) applies to both types
of fits. The quadratic fit of Equation (1) has a standard
deviation of only 4% over a much longer time interval of
about 30 days in Interval A (see Figure 4) compared to
the exponential fits for Interval I (Figure 3) and II (see
Table 1 for the parameters).
As mentioned before, there is an intermediate phase
(Interval III), where the growth is indeed approximately
exponential with a value of σ of about 2% for about 20
days; see Figure 5. This stage is followed by a quadratic
growth (Interval B) until the present time with σ = 1.9%.
In Figure 6 we show such a representation. The characteristic time is now about 0.09 days, which is eight times
shorter than the time during the early stage in Interval A.
This means that N 1/2 changes by one every 0.09 days or by
about ten every day. We have to remember that N is now
larger than for Interval A: when N 1/2 = 400 (late times in
Figure 6), a change of N 1/2 by ten per day corresponds to
a change of N from 4002 = 160000 to 4102 = 168100, i.e.,
a change by about 8000 in one day.

summary of the parameters. The e-folding time increases
from about 3 days during Interval I to about 8 days during
Intervals II and III; see the values of τ in Table 1.
Next, to quantify the accuracy of the fits given by
Equation (2) for limited time intervals, t1 ≤ t ≤ t2 , we
compute the relative residual as
res = [N (t)/Nfit (t) − 1].

3. Heuristic model of peripheral spreading
Contrary to the usual exponential growth, a quadratic
growth can be the result of control interventions. It can be
explained by spreading on the periphery of a bulk structure, which can be of geometrical or sociological nature
(Britton, 2020b). In the bulk, no further infections are
possible. At the level of an epidemic model, it would correspond to a situation where the local population density
has effectively reached saturation levels in the number of
infections (Britton et al., 2020). In the case of COVID-19,
however, it is more realistic to describe this as a state of
partial confinement and isolation of individuals or small
groups of people.

This residual is shown as an inset to Figure 3, and its
standard deviation, σ = h(res)2 i1/2 , is indicated by dotted
lines. Here, angle brackets denote averaging over the time
span t1 ≤ t ≤ t2 . For Interval I, σ is approximately 8%;
see Table 1. For the quadratic fit, we write
Nfit (t) = [(t − t0 )/τ ]2

(quadratic fit),

where τ is again a characteristic time and t0 is a reference
time, where the fit intersects the abscissa. This is fairly

where n is the number of people in a narrow strip around
the periphery. Its size scales with the ratio of the circumference (= 2πr for a circle of radius
r) to the square root
√
of the area (= πr2 ), so n ≈ 2 πN . Here, the prefactor
√
depends on the geometry and we would have n = 4 N√for
a rectangular geometry. We may therefore set n = α N ,
where α ≈ 3.5 for a circular geometry. Inserting this into
Equation (5) yields

with the solution
N (t) = (αt/2T )2 .

The empirical analysis of Section 2 suggested a growth
of the form N (t) = (t/τ )2 , with τ ≈ 0.7 days (or about
17 hours) and t being the time in days after January 20,
2020 for Interval A and τ ≈ 0.093 days for Interval B. For
a circular geometry, this implies that the spreading times
are T = ατ /2 = 1.2 days and 0.16 days for Intervals A and
B, respectively.
The idea of a geometrically confined bulk with a surrounding periphery may need to be generalized to sociological or network structures that can follow similar patterns
(Iannelli et al., 2017; Britton, 2020b; Prasse et al., 2020).
In the present work, we do not make any attempts to analyze this aspect further, but refer instead to recent work
of Sanche et al. (2020), who analyzed the spatial patterns
of COVID-19 during the early phase, and to the work of
Ziff & Ziff (2020), who also discussed spreading on a fractal network.
The increase in the slope of N 1/2 versus t corresponds
to a decrease of τ by a factor of about eight for Interval B. This can be the result of multiple separate hotspots,
each of which display peripheral growth. This idea will be
substantiated further in the following, where we use the
spatio-temporal epidemiological model of Noble (1974).
Such a model leads to radial expansion waves that propagate at constant speed. It is therefore expected to lead to
situations similar to what we have discussed above.
At later times, several hotspots can merge. This leads
to a decrease in the slope, which has in fact also been
observed since the middle of May. Corresponding plots
are presented along with the datasets for the present paper
(Brandenburg, 2020b). The discussion of such models will
be postponed to a subsequent paper.

and a group of

responsible for spreading the disease with a characteristic time scale
T.

Here we propose a model where the continued confinement efforts prevent spreading within the bulk of the infected population, but these efforts cannot prevent spreading on the periphery; see Figure 7 for a sketch. The rate
dN/dt, with which N increases in time, is therefore equal
to the number of infected people on the periphery divided
by a characteristic spreading time T . We therefore arrive
at the following simple differential equation

4. Epidemiological model with spatial extent
The SIR model of Kermack & McKendrick (1927) is a
predator–prey type model, where the number of prey corresponds to the susceptible individuals S, and the number of predators corresponds to the infected population I.
The latter also spreads to their neighbors by diffusion, described by a diffusion term κ∇2 I with κ being a diffusion
coefficient (Noble, 1974; Källén et al., 1985; Murray et al.,

1986). Finally, there is the number of diseased or recovered individuals R. The quantity I can be identified with
the variable N used in Section 2. Thus, we have

this model, a certain fraction of R could be interpreted
as the number of deaths, but this distinction will not be
made in the present work. In addition to the three aforementioned parameters, we have the spatial and temporal
coordinates, x and t. It is convenient to define nondimensional space and time coordinates as x̃ = kx and t̃ = λt.
This leaves µ̃ = µ/λ and κ̃ = κk 2 /λ as the only nondimensional input parameters that we shall vary. The population
number is normalized by the initial number of susceptible
individuals, S0 , so we can define S̃ = S/S0 , I˜ = I/S0 , and
R̃ = R/S0 as the fractional (nondimensional) population
densities. We then have hS̃ + I˜ + R̃i = 1 at all times.
The tildes will from now on be dropped. In practice,
this means that we always keep λ = 1 and adopt for the
domain size L = 2π, so k = 1.
As initial condition, we assume S = 1 and I = 0, except
for nine mesh points, where we initialize I = I1 on one isolated mesh point and I = I2 on eight others. We refer to
them as “hotspot”. We always use I1 = 10−6 for the main
hotspot, which we place at x ≈ y ≈ 2; see Figure 8. Since
the growth rate is normalized to unity, one would expect
I1 to reach unity in a time t = − ln 10−6 = 6 × ln 10 ≈ 14
in the absence of saturation. We perform different experiments using for the secondary multiple hotspots the values
I2 = 10−60 , 10−180 , and 10−300 , which, in the absence of
saturation, would reach saturation at times t = 60×ln 10 ≈
140, 180 × ln 10 ≈ 410, and 300 × ln 10 ≈ 700.
We begin by studying models with µ = 0, but later we
also consider small nonvanishing values of µ. For most of
our models, we use κ = 10−6 , which is close to the smallest
value that is allowed at our resolution of 40962. It implies
that reaction fronts are sufficiently well resolved. Their
size and speed depend on the values of λ and κ and can be
obtained on dimensional grounds. It is therefore useful to
restore the symbol λ, even though we have already
put it to
p
unity. In our case, the width of the front is κ/λ = 10−3 .
Such an expression is typical of reaction–diffusion equations (Fisher, 1937; Kolmogorov et al., 1937). The front

(10)

In a closed domain, the total number of individuals is constant, so hS + I + Ri = const. We therefore only need to
solve Equations (8) and (9).
To solve Equations (8) and (9), we employ the Pencil Code3 , a publicly available time stepping code for
solving partial differential equations on massively parallel architectures (Brandenburg & Dobler, 2010). Spatial
derivatives are computed from a sixth-order finite difference formula and the third order Runge–Kutta time stepping scheme of Williamson (1980) is employed. We use
40962 mesh points and run the model for about 1200 time
units, which takes about six minutes with 1024 processors
on a Cray XC40. We fix the time step to be 0.05 and have
checked that the solution did not change when the time
step is decreased further. The SIR model is implemented
in the current version, and also the relevant input parameter files are publicly available (Brandenburg, 2020b).
We solve Equations (8) and (9) in a two-dimensional
Cartesian domain with coordinates x = (x, y) and periodic
boundary conditions. We characterize the domain size L
by the smallest wavenumber k = 2π/L that fits into the
domain.
The model has three parameters: the reproduction rate
λ, the rate of recovery µ, and the diffusion constant κ. In

κ = 10−6 (iii), and κ = 5 × 10−7 (iv). The arrow points in the
direction of increasing values of κ.

In Figure 9, we show the evolution of hIi for our three
values of I2 (= 10−60 , 10−180 , and 10−300 ). We see that at
very early times, hIi increases exponentially. This is seen
in the inset of Figure 9(a). Locally, the big hotspot has
reached saturation within a tiny spot, which then begins
to expand. We recall that the primary spot had an initial
value of 10−6 , but in the inset we plot the averaged value
hIi, which can be 40962 ≈ 2 × 10−7 times smaller.
At some point, the values of I(x, y, t) at the secondary
hotspots begin to become significant and, because of their
larger number, begin to dominate the growth of hIi. This
is similar to the late phase in Interval B shown in Figure 2. By the argument presented in Section 3, the slope
of the graph of N 1/2 , which is proportional to hIi1/2 ,
should scale with the ratio of their total circumference to
the square root of the total area. Therefore, the slope
should scale with the square root of the number of secondary hotspots. In this connection, we note that a dependence of the total reaction speed on the number of
topologically disconnected regions is also typical of other
reaction–diffusion equations and has been seen before; see
Figure 4 of Brandenburg & Multamäki (2004).
Next, we study the effects of changing of µ. We see
that already rather small values of around µ = 2 × 10−4 =
0.02% have a noticeable effect at late times, so that hIi
reaches a maximum as a function of time at around t =
800. The position of this maximum depends only weakly
on the value of µ.
Finally, we study the effects of changing the diffusivity
κ. The result is shown in Figure 11.
√ We see that the
speed of spreading, which is roughly 2 λκ, increases with
increasing diffusivity.
Having now gained some experience with this model,
we can ask what would be realistic parameters related
to COVID-19. Given that the slope of N 1/2 (t) depends
on the value of κ, one might be able to give some estimates. Using
√ the slopes seen in Figure 11, we find that
τ −1 = β λκk 2 , where βA ≈ 0.56 for Interval A and
βB ≈ 2.8 for Interval B, with the subscript denoting the

speed is c = 2 λκ (Murray, 2003), which is characterized
by the nondimensional quantity Pe = c/κk = 2000, which
is also known as the Péclét number.
In Figure 8 we show gray scale visualizations of I(x, y, t)
at two instants shortly before (t = 400) and shortly after
(t = 500) the time when the secondary hotspots become
significant (shown here for µ = 0). For t = 500, we also
present a case with µ = 0.005 = 0.5%. We see that this
small value of µ hardly affects the spatial spreading of the
disease. In the interior of the affected region, however,
there is a certain recovery, so I(x, y, t) decreases again at
the center of each hotspot. We have not plotted S(x, y, t),
but we note that it has an essentially complementary structure in that its value drops locally approximately by the
same amount that I(x, y, t) increases.

interval. Again, we have restored here the symbol λ, even
though λ = 1 was assumed in all of our simulations. The
ratio of the two coefficients is around five, which is nearly
twice as much as the square root of the number of secondary hotspots, which was expected based on the heuristic argument presented in Section 3. To estimate the effective value of κ, the largest uncertainty comes from the
value of k, which is the inverse domain size which, in turn,
is ultimately related to the size of the affected continents
on the Earth. Assuming that κ ≈ (λτ 2 k 2 )−1 , we see that
with k ≈ (1000 km)−1 , λ = (10 days)−1 , and τ = 1 day, we
have κ ≈ 109 km2 / day, which is much larger than the diffusion coefficient estimated for the spreading of the Black
Death in 1347, for which a diffusion coefficient of the order
of 102 km2 / day has been estimated (Noble, 1974).

tine. This suggests that the following thirty days of nearly
perfectly quadratic growth where solely the result of human interventions, and therefore potentially highly unstable. This is evidenced by the subsequent period of short
exponential growth, before the second period of quadratic
growth commenced. The present work has demonstrated
that quadratic growth laws are generally the result of partial confinement and that the maximum possible infection
levels, given the existing confinement measures, have already been reached. At present, the consequences of relaxing these measures cannot be easily predicted, given
that the almost universal lockdown in Europe and the US
has been unique in human history.

Appendix A. Late quadratic growth
Published separately in Brandenburg (2020b)
In Brandenburg (2020a), it was shown that in a twodimensional epidemic model, the normalized averaged number of infections hIi grows quadratically in time when the
population is not strongly mixed and the local number of
infections I is large compared to the number of susceptible ones S that can still be infected. This leads to what
is known as peripheral growth, which is always quadratic,
but with a time constant that depends on the number of
hotspots that are surrounded by an individual front.

Figure A.14: Square root of N (black dots) versus time since January 20, 2020. The actual date is given on the upper axis and the
actual values of N are given on the right-hand axis.
Figure A.12: Simulation with 9 hotspots that later merge and overlap. The local distribution of I(x, y, t) is shown in the xy plane for
three values of t. The length of the circumference determines the
speed of growth. When several hotspots merge, the circumference
shortens and the growth slows down.

A decrease in the slope of N 1/2 versus t is indeed seen
since May 2020; see section C of Figure A.14, which is
an updated version of Figure 2 of Brandenburg (2020a),
where only data until April 20 were analyzed. Here, the
number of deaths, N , is taken from the worldometers website4 . It is a more reliable proxy of the number of infections
than the reported number of infections. During section A,
the epidemic was largely confined to China, but during
section B many other places in the world got affected.

Figure A.13: Time series for simulation with 9 hotspots that later
overlap. Note that N 1/2 ∝ hIi1/2 grows linearly with time t, which
shows that N ∝ t2 .

It was shown that the growth is faster when there are
more fronts, and it was stated that the growth becomes
slower when fronts merge and several hotspots now connected by a common front. The result of a simulation similar to the fiducial run of Brandenburg (2020a) is shown
in Figures A.12 and A.13. The value of N is proportional
