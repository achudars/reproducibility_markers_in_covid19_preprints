Abstract
A novel strain of coronavirus, namely, COVID-19 has been identified in Wuhan city of
China in December 2019. There are no specific therapies available and investigations regarding
the treatment of the COVID-19 are still lacking. This prompted us to perform a preliminary in
silico study on the COVID-19 protease with anti-malarial compounds in the search of potential
inhibitor. We have calculated log P and log S values in addition to molecular docking and PASS
predictions. Among the seven studied compounds, mepacrine appears as the potential inhibitor of
the COVID-19 followed by chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine and phomarin. Therefore, these
anti-malarial drugs may be potential drug candidate for the treatment of this novel coronavirus.
A detailed analysis on these inhibitors is currently in progress and clinical studies are invited to
investigate their potential medicinal use for the COVID-19.

Introduction
At the beginning of this year, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was recognized in
Wuhan, China [1]. Subsequently, the COVID-19 started spreading across the globe, putting the
whole world on high alert [2–5]. This led to 655 total cases and 18 deaths all over the world
including China and 9 other countries till 23 January 2020 [6]. In India, the first case of the
COVID-19 was reported in Kerala on 30 January 2020. As of 20 March 2020, there are 230
cases and 4 deaths as reported by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of
India [7]. According to a report of the world health organization (WHO) dated 17 March 2020,
there are a total of 0.18 million cases of the COVID-19 worldwide, causing almost 7.5 thousand
deaths and counting [8].
Coronaviruses infect humans and vertebrate animals, affecting their respiratory,
digestive, liver and central nervous systems [9]. Since the inception of the COVID-19 at the end
of 2019, the continuous efforts have been made in the research and development of the
diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines for this novel coronavirus [10]. Based on the results of
some clinical trials, it has been reported [11] that chloroquine phosphate, an anti-malarial drug,
has a certain curative effect on the COVID-19. In particular, chloroquine phosphate is
recommended to treat COVID-19 associated pneumonia in larger populations in the future.
Subsequently, another research based on clinical trials suggested [12] that hydroxychloroquine
added with azithromycin is very effective in the treatment of the COVID-19. This motivated us
to perform a systematic study on some anti-malarial drugs using molecular docking and
reinvestigate their biological activities and pharmacological effects. Such studies become
important as they offer some insights into structure-based drug design. Recently, Lin et al. [13]
have reported the structure-based stabilization of non-native protein-protein interactions of the

3

coronavirus in antiviral drug design. However, there exists no systematic study on the inhibition
of the coronavirus by anti-malarial drugs to the best of our knowledge. Therefore, we believe
that this study should offer better insights into the binding and interaction of anti-malarial drugs
with the COVID-19 receptor.
Methodology
To identify the potential binding sites for anti-malarial compounds, we have been
performed an automated in silico molecular-docking procedure using the SwissDock web server
[14, 15], which is based on the docking algorithm EADock ESS. We have used the main
protease in corona viruses as a potential target protein for COVID-19 obtained from the RCSB
protein data bank (PDB ID: 6LU7) [16]. The processed coordinates file for each of the ligands
and COVID-19 protein (6LU7) has been uploaded, and docking was performed using the
‘Accurate’ parameter option, which is most exhaustive in terms of the binding modes sampled.
We have also calculated lipophilicity (log P) and aqueous solubility (log S) ALOGPS 2.1
program [17]. This program is based on electrotopological state indices and associative neural
network modeling developed by Tetko et al. [18]. The log P and log S are two very important
parameters for quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) studies. In order to explore
and predict the pharmacological effects and biological activities of molecules, we have used
PASS software [19]. The PASS predicts 900 pharmacological effects, molecular mechanisms of
action, mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, teratogenicity and embryotoxicity.
Results and Discussion
We have chosen seven popular anti-malarial compounds as a ligand to the COVID-19
protease namely mepacrine (1), chloroquine (2), quinine (3), hydroxychloroquine (4), artemisinin
(5), phomarin (6) and proguanil (7). The molecular structures of these drugs are displayed in Fig.
4

1. In order to assess and compare their biological activity, we have computed their log P and log
S values as listed in Table 1. Log P is closely associated with the transport property of drugs and
their interaction with receptors whereas log S is an important factor affecting its bioavailability.
One can see that the log P values of compounds 1-7 lie in the range 6.13-1.90. Chloroquine (2)
has a log P value of 5.28 followed by hydroxychloroquine (4) with a log P of 3.87. However,
mepacrine (1) has the highest log P of 6.13 among all seven compounds studied in this work.
Likewise, the log S value of these anti-malarial compounds ranges between -2.35 and -5.22. In
general, about 85% of drugs have log S values in the range of -1 to -5, a few have values below 5 but virtually none have values below -6 [20]. All log S lies between -1 and -5, except
mepacrine (1) having log S slightly below -5. These log P and log S values suggest that the drug
molecules may easily diffuse across the cell membranes, as their organic (lipid) solubility is
quite large.

This study has been focused on the main protease in the novel corona virus as a potential
target protein for COVID-19 treatment. The 6LU7 [21] is the main protease found in the
COVID-19, which has been deposited as a PDB file in early February 2020. Therefore, we have
chosen 6LU7 as a potential target for molecular docking studies. The molecular docking
calculations have been performed as blind, i.e., covered the entire protein surface, not any
specific region of the protein as the binding pocket in order to avoid sampling bias. The output
clusters have been obtained after each docking step and ranked according to the full fitness (FF)
score by the SwissDock algorithm. A greater negative FF score suggests a more favorable
binding mode between ligand and receptor with a better fit.

The results of molecular docking are displayed in Fig. 2. The docking parameters such as
binding energy, FF score along with the amino acids (residues) found in the active site pockets of
6LU7 have been also listed in Table 1. The binding energies (affinities) obtained from docking
of 6LU7 with ligands mepacrine (1), chloroquine (2), quinine (3), hydroxychloroquine (4),
artemisinin (5), phomarin (6) and proguanil (7) are -8.86, -8.15, -7.77, -7.62, -7.34, -7.13 and 6.69 kcal/mol respectively. The affinity of drug compounds depends on the type of bonding that
occurs with the active site of the protein. The results of docking analyses show the mepacrine (1)
forms H-bond (bond length = 2.663 Å) with the glutamate (GLU-166), a polar amino acid. On
the contrary, chloroquine (2) forms H-bond (bond length = 2.321 Å) with the glycine (GLY143), a non-polar amino acid. Unlike 2, quinine (3) and hydroxychloroquine (4) form H-bonds
with the histidine (HSD-163), a polar amino acid (bond length = 2.377 Å) and phenylalanine
(PHE-140), an aromatic amino acid (bond length = 2.501 Å). Artemisnin ((5) forms two H-bonds
of bond lengths 2.447 Å and 2.369 Å with the same amino acid (GLY-143). Phomarin (6) also
forms two H-bonds, one with the GLY-143 (bond length = 2.462 Å) and another with the GLU166 (bond length = 2.607 Å). Proguanil (7) forms H-bond of 2.262 Å with the leucine (LEU141), a non-polar amino acid. The binding modes of different anti-malarial compounds with the
6LU7 receptor have been shown in Fig. 2 as well. Thus, our docking analyses suggest that the
COVID-19 protease (6LU7) can be inhibited by anti-malarial drug compounds. Based on the
binding affinity, the inhibition potential of these compounds can be ranked as; 1 > 2 > 3 > 4 > 5
> 6 > 7. Combining the results of log P and log S with the docking, we can expect that the
compounds 1, 2, 4 and 6 should behave as potential inhibitors of the COVID-19.

For the purpose of drug design, it is desirable to analyze the detailed biological activities
or possible pharmacological effects along with toxicity or possible adverse effects of the drug
compounds. Therefore, we have predicted activity spectra of anti malarial compounds using the
PASS software. This prediction is based on the study of structure activity relationships (SAR) for
the training set including about 50,000 drugs, drug‐candidates and lead compounds whose
biological activity has been reported experimentally. An average accuracy of prediction in
leave‐one‐out cross‐validation is about 85% [19]. In supplementary Table S1, we have listed the
pharmacological effects as well as adverse affects of these compounds with Pa > 70%. This is to
ensure that the molecules will most likely exhibit these activities in the experiment. Furthermore,
the probability that the molecules have several closely analogous drugs is quite high. These
results of PASS prediction might be useful during clinical trials and drug development stage of
the COVID-19.
Concluding Remarks
We have performed a systematic study on anti-malarial compounds in the search of
potential inhibitors for novel coronavirus, COVID-19 protease. Based on the binding affinity,
mepacrine appears as the most powerful inhibitor among seven compounds studied here.
However, its log P is quite high and log S value is very low. Other potential inhibitors of
COVID-19 protease include chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine and phomarin. Therefore, a
detailed analysis on these drugs is required. Meanwhile, we suggest some clinic trials of these
compounds or their suitable combinations. Our PASS predictions may be useful for clinical trials
of these inhibitors of COVID-19. Further studies in these directions are in progress in our lab and
shall be reported shortly.
