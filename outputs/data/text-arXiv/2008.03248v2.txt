Abstract This work constructs, analyzes, and simulates a new compartmental SEIR-type model for the dynamics and potential control of the current
COVID-19 pandemic. The novelty in this work is two-fold. First, the population is divided according to its compliance with disease control directives
(lockdown, shelter-in-place, masks/face coverings, physical distancing, etc.)
into those who fully comply and those who follow the directives partially, or
are necessarily mobile (such as medical staff). This split, indirectly, reflects on
the quality and consistency of these measures. This allows the assessment of
the overall effectiveness of the control measures and the impact of their relaxing or tightening on the disease spread. Second, the adequate contact rate,
which directly affects the infection rate, is one of the model unknowns, as it
keeps track of the changes in the population behavior and the effectiveness
of various disease treatment modalities via a differential inclusion. Existence,
uniqueness and positivity results are proved using a nonstandard convex analysis based approach. As a case study, the pandemic outbreak in the Republic
of Korea (South Korea) is simulated. The model parameters were found by
minimizing the deviation of the model prediction from the reported data over
the first 100 days of the pandemic in South Korea. The simulations show that
the model captures accurately the pandemic dynamics in the subsequent 75

days, which provides confidence in the model predictions and its future use.
In particular, the model predicts that about 40% of the infections were not
documented, which implies that asymptomatic infections contribute silently
but substantially to the spread of the disease indicating that more widespread
asymptomatic testing is necessary.

1 Introduction
The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 emerged in Wuhan, China, in December
2019 as a mutation of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus,
SARS-CoV. The first group of COVID-19 patients, reported in Wuhan exhibited flu-like symptoms resulting in the serious cases in pneumonia and death.
There is mounting evidence (Huang et al. 2021; Marshall 2010; World Health
Organization (WHO) 2021) and the references therein, that the virus affects
blood vessels, and therefore, the body organs, which may cause long term
health complications. Currently, the pandemic affects all parts of the world,
and can be found in over 200 countries and territories (Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University (JHU) 2021; World Health
Organization (WHO) 2021; Worldometer 2021). The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic on 11 March 2020, which caused
the introduction of emergency measures: large scale closing of borders, and
lock-down of countries, states, regions, cities, and communities, as well as
closing of schools and universities. As of 8 Aug. 2020, globally, there are over
14 million confirmed cases, over 600,000 deaths and over eight million recovered (Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University
(JHU) 2021; Worldometer 2021). Thus, the number of COVID-19 infections
by far exceed the number of SARS or the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome
(MERS) infections. The SARS-CoV-2 human-to-human virus transmission is
mainly via airborne fluid droplets, especially among those who are in close
proximity. Transmission from infected patients to healthcare personnel has
been often observed.
Because of the global impact of the pandemic, many researchers have been
engaged in mathematical and statistical modeling of various aspects of the
disease dynamics, aiming at predicting global and national trends, as well as
specific regional behaviors of the virus spread. These are meant to help policymakers with hospital and emergency services preparedness and utilization;
national and regional policy response decisions; business plans; implementation, relaxation and evaluation of various control measures; organization of
large scale vaccination; and scientific understanding of the many facets of the
disease dynamics. These efforts are reflected in the large number of relevant

Mathematical model of COVID-19

publications listed in, see, e.g., (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) 2020; Wikipedia 2020b; World Health Organization (WHO) 2021), and
many recent publications such as (Anguelov et al. 2020; Eikenberry et al. 2020;
Fanelli and Piazza 2020; Garba et al. 2020; Giordano et al. 2020; Hou et al.
2020). An interesting mathematical model dealing with some of the social
implications of the pandemic is Johnston and Pell (2020). Since this work is
concerned with simulations until 8 Aug. 2020, we do not consider new virus
strains, or the global vaccination efforts that are underway.
We construct a new model for the COVID-19 pandemic to help researchers
and policymakers evaluate the effectiveness and effects of various intervention
and mitigation strategies, in real-time. It is based on the ideas underlying the
MERS model in (Al-Asuoad 2017; Al-Asuoad and Shillor 2018; Al-Asuoad
et al. 2016). However, our preliminary simulations of the COVID-19 pandemic
using this MERS model produced unsatisfactory results. One of the main reasons is related to the government-mandated measures (how strict they were,
how well they were communicated and enforced) and how well the population complied with them. Therefore, we distinguish those who follow properly
the directives (wear masks in public, keep an appropriate distance from other
people and frequently wash hands and/or use disinfectants) and those who
do not or only partially do so. The latter group includes also health care
personnel who have to be in contact with sick people, retirement homes’ personnel, and other essential workers. To account for this, we introduce a new
time-dependent parameter θ that represents the division of the exposed and
infected subpopulations into those who fully comply and those who comply
only partially. This parameter measures both the effectiveness of the directives and the population’s compliance and allows to study the effects of these
control measures and the possible impact of relaxing or tightening them on
the disease spread. A related parameter in a simpler model was introduced in
(Anguelov et al. 2020; Garba et al. 2020), where the focus was on estimating
the size of the exposed but asymptomatic population. Our model provides this
information, too.
The second novelty is in considering the ‘adequate contact parameter’ β,
(Hethcote 2000), as one of the model dependent variables, instead of the usual
assumption that it is a fixed constant, or a function of time, see e.g., (Greenhalgh and Das (2020); Greenhalgh and Day (2017); O’Neill (1997); Thieme
and Yang (2002)) and the references therein. The case when β depends on
the number of recovered R can be found in Báez-Sánchez and Bobko (2020),
where it is shown how the choice of β(R) affects the stability of the equilibrium
points in a ‘simple’ SIR model. Here, instead of having to modify and fit β
as the pandemic progressed, we consider it as a dependent variable, since it
is known that β changes with changing population behavior, (Thieme (2003);
Wikipedia (2021)), with tightened/relaxed control measures, seasonal changes,
and availability of more information on the spread of COVID-19 and its effects
on human health. The change in β can also be caused by the introduction of
more effective face masks, and possible mutations. The latter will likely involve randomness that we would like to study in the future. Furthermore, in

4

simple SEIR models, there is a saturation phenomenon, that is, a decline in
infectivity unrelated to the ‘herd immunity,’ see e.g., (Gai et al. 2020; Heesterbeek and Metz 1993; Zhang and Ma 2003) and references therein. By choosing
β to be one of the model unknowns, we keep track of the intrinsic changes
of the contact parameter, which includes the virus ‘infectiveness,’ and also
the changes in human behavior. Since 1/β is the average number of contacts
needed to infect a healthy person, it has a restricted range, 0 < β ≤ 1. This
restriction is modeled by a differential inclusion. For the sake of simplicity, we
assume that β grows (linearly) with the infected and decays (linearly) with
the recovered. This linearity assumption is ad-hoc and is not based on any
deeper epidemiological considerations. Therefore, it is of considerable interest
to explore more appropriate forms of the inclusion in the future. Choosing β
as an unknown that is described by a differential inclusion captures the evolution of the pandemic more naturally and is expected to make the model more
accurate. However, our simulations for South Korea shows that β varies very
little over the 175 days of simulations, so taking it as a fixed parameter, in this
case, leads to very similar results. This is likely due to their successful COVID19 containment and mitigation strategies. Nevertheless, long-time simulations
(1,000 days) show that β changes to a lower value, which indicates that it
is affected by the process. A third novelty is the theoretical introduction of
randomness into the model parameters. This wil be used in future works to
study the sensitivity of the model to certain parameters and thus allowing for
better predictions, as well as the introduction of virus mutations.
Since the model includes a differential inclusion, we establish the existence
of the unique solution for the initial value problem, based on a theorem in
abstract Hilbert spaces, (Brézis 1973). Moreover, the introduction of randomness into the model parameters raises the question of the measurability of the
solutions with respect to the random variables. These mathematical issues are
discussed in some detail in Sections 3 and 4.
An algorithm for the model simulations was constructed and implemented
in MATLAB. Several simulations that show the predictive power of the model
are presented in the context of the pandemic dynamics in the Republic of
Korea. South Korea is chosen for the case study because it is one of the first
countries to go through the disease cycle and the information provided by the
government is very reliable. In the simulations, we use some of the published
data to ‘train’ the model by using an optimization routine in MATLAB which
finds the model parameters that provide a ‘best `1 fit.’ We present our simulated model predictions together with the data, one part of which (the first
100 days) was used in the optimization while the remaining 75 days depict
how close the model predictions and the data are. The simulations of 175 days
indicate that the model captures well the disease dynamics in South Korea.
Following this introduction, the mathematical model for the pandemic is
constructed in Section 2. It consists of a coupled system of seven nonlinear
ordinary differential equations and a differential inclusion for the contact variable β. The existence of the unique solution to the model is established in
Section 3. Section 4 describes very briefly the addition of randomness and the

Mathematical model of COVID-19

measurability of the solutions with random parameters. The stability of the
two equilibrium states, the disease-free equilibrium (DFE) and the endemic
equilibrium (EE), is presented in Section 5, based on an expression for the
system’s Jacobian derived in the Appendix. Section 6 outlines the algorithm
used in the numerical simulations. Section 7 reports the results of the simulations of the COVID-19 dynamics in South Korea. The baseline simulations are
in Subsection 7.1, where the model predictions are compared to the data. This
section also provides additional information about the various subpopulations,
which is difficult to obtain in the field, such as those who carry the virus, can
infect others, but are undocumented and asymptomatic, and the variation in
β as well as the stability of the DFE and EE. The effectiveness of the control
measures and their connection to θ is studied in Subsection 7.2, while Subsection 7.3 presents the resulting case fatality and the infection fatality rates.
Conclusions, unresolved issues and future work can be found in Section 8.

2 The Model
This section presents a mathematical model for the dynamics of the COVID-19
pandemic. It is based on the ideas that led to the MERS model in (Al-Asuoad
2017; Al-Asuoad and Shillor 2018; Al-Asuoad et al. 2016). However, there are
significant differences between the compartmental structures and the resulting
set of equations of the two models. In particular, this model separates the
subpopulations of those who comply with the disease control directives and
those who choose not to or partially comply.
The model describes whole populations and assumes that they are large
enough to justify continuous dependent variables, thus, we use ordinary differential equations (ODEs). When the geographical distribution of the disease is
important, or when the density and culture of the population vary in different
parts of the country, it must be modified and partial differential equations
(PDEs) need to be used instead. However, using PDEs considerably increases
the mathematical complexity of the model and is beyond the scope of this
work.
The model assumes that there may be various disease control measures such
as voluntary or mandatory isolation, shelter-in-place directives, movement controls, closure of various public spaces and places, physical-distancing, and that
a portion of the population practices these measures with varying degree. It
describes the dynamics of seven subpopulations: susceptibles S; asymptomatic
(exposed) fully compliant Ef c ; asymptomatic (exposed) partially compliant or
noncompliant Epc ; infected fully compliant, If c ; partially compliant or noncompliant infected Ipc ; hospitalized H; and recovered R. Unlike the usual SEIR
models where those in the E compartment(s) are latent and cannot infect others, here the term ‘exposed’ also includes those who carry the virus and can
infect others, but do not exhibit any symptoms. This compartment is of considerable interest in COVID-19 since a portion of the infections were caused
by individuals in E. For the sake of simplicity, we refer below to partially com-

pliant or noncompliant as partially compliant. In addition, the model includes
a differential inclusion for the infection rate function β. The populations and β
are functions of time, which is measured in days. The compartmental structure
of the model is depicted in Figure 1.

rates; δ is the hospitalization rate; σE , σI , σH are recovery rates; and dI , dH are the disease

The susceptible subpopulation S(t) consists of those who are healthy (only
in terms of the COVID-19, while they may have other health conditions) and
can become sick, or do not belong to any of the other groups. The subpopulations Ef c (t) and Epc (t) denote the current numbers of those exposed to
COVID-19 who fully comply with the disease control directives and those
who do not or do so partially, respectively. The subpopulation Epc (t) includes
also those who because of work or other circumstances cannot fully follow
the shelter-in-place and the other directives. Furthermore, the subpopulations
Ef c (t) and Epc (t) consist of: asymptomatics – those who do not become sick;
pre-symptomatics – those who in 5-14 days develop clinical symptoms; and
those who do not show symptoms or are mildly symptomatic but are not
tested and documented. It is established that both subpopulations carry the
virus and can infect susceptibles and as noted above, they include the latent
individuals who cannot infect others and also those who can.
The subpopulations If c (t) and Ipc (t) consist of documented infected individuals who are fully compliant or partially compliant, respectively, with no,
mild, or medium clinical symptoms. H(t) denotes those whose symptoms are
severe or critical and are hospitalized. Finally, R(t) denotes the individuals
who recovered from COVID-19 and as of Aug. 2020, there are approximately
9 million such individuals in the world. We assume that recovered individuals
have temporal immunity and cannot become infected again. Moreover, at this
stage it is not known how long this immunity lasts. If evidence of reinfection

Mathematical model of COVID-19

emerges, it is straightforward to modify the model to add reinfection pathways
in the compartmental structure, possibly with delays.
Next, we define the parameters of the model. The total living population
at time t is given by
N (t) = S(t) + Ef c (t) + Epc (t) + If c (t) + Ipc (t) + H(t) + R(t).
We denote by pS (t) the number of susceptible individuals that are added
each day by birth or by travel from outside of the region of interest. We
let pEf c (t) and pEpc (t) be the per day influx of fully compliant and partially
compliant exposed, respectively, and note that this influx (mostly by air travel)
seems to be one of the main reasons why COVID-19 spread so quickly around
the globe (see, e.g., (Nextstrain 2020)). Next, pIf c (t) and pIpc (t) denote the
per day influxes of fully compliant infected and partially compliant infected
populations, respectively. Then, pH (t) is the number of those who arrive sick on
day t and need hospitalization, and pR (t) is the influx of recovered individuals.
The ‘natural’ death rate coefficient (in the absence of COVID-19) of the
population, µ (1/day), can easily be obtained from the demographic information of the country and can be considered as given.
Next, the contact rate (or the infection rate coefficient) β(t) (1/day) at
time t is the average number of contacts sufficient for transmission. The rates
of infection of a susceptible by a fully or partially compliant asymptomatic,
a fully or partially compliant infected, or a hospitalized results in infection,
respectively, are
Ef c β,

Epc β,

If c β,

Ipc β,

H β,

(1/day). The ’s are nonnegative dimensionless infection rate modification constants. When the isolation is very effective, the first and the last three are likely
to be small, since contacts are discouraged, and H should be kept small in
every hospital environment.
The rate Γ , the so-called force of infection, is given by
Γ =

β
(Ef c Ef c + Epc Epc + If c If c + Ipc Ipc + H H),
N

and measures the rate at which susceptibles get infected. We note that to
model the case when E represents only those that are latent and cannot infect others, one has to set Ef c = Epc = 0. The rate, per day, at which the
fraction θ of the susceptibles becomes exposed fully compliant is θΓ S, and the
rest becomes exposed partially compliant at the rate (1 − θ)Γ S. Moreover, we
allow fully compliant exposed to become partially compliant exposed and vice
versa, with rate constant γE . This may be triggered by a change in their views
or their economic situation. The rate constant γI has a similar interpretation.
The parameters γf c , γpc (1/day) denote the rate constants of development of
clinical symptoms in fully compliant and partially compliant exposed individuals, while γ − , γ + are the rate constants of clinical symptoms in fully compliant who become partially compliant and infected (hopefully small), and those

8

A. Cesmelioglu et al.

partially compliant exposed who become fully compliant infected. The model
assumes that there is no disease-induced death in the exposed populations.
Next, the rate constant at which the fully compliant infected and the partially
compliant infected individuals need hospitalization is assumed to be the same,
δ. The additional disease-induced death for the infected and hospitalized are
dI and dH , respectively. To complete the flow chart, we denote by σE , σI and
σH the recovery rates of the exposed, infected and hospitalized, respectively.
Finally, the model takes into account the changes in the contact number, which also includes the virulence (infectivity) and other effects related to
changes in contact, of the coronavirus via a novel differential inclusion for the
infection rate coefficient β. These changes may be due to the changes in social
behavior, changes in weather (allowing more people to be outside where the
infection rates are smaller), or minor mutations of the virus. We assume that β
increases in proportion to the infected population, with rate coefficient δ∗ ≥ 0,
and decreases in proportion to the population immunity and the number of
those recovered, with rate constant δ ∗ ≥ 0. This is expressed in the differential
inclusion (10) and a detailed explanation can be found below. However, this
differential inclusion is ad-hoc and different formulations will be investigated
in the future when a deeper understanding of the virus dynamics emerges.
Moreover, it may be of interest to add in the future the effects of vaccination.
With the notation and assumptions given above, our model for the COVID19 pandemic is defined below.

together with the initial conditions,
S(0) = S0 , Ef c (0) = Ef c0 , Epc (0) = Epc0 , If c (0) = If c0 , Ipc (0) = Ipc0 ,
H(0) = H0 , R(0) = R0 ,

(11)

β(0) = β0 ∈ [β∗ , β ∗ ].
Here, S0 > 0 is the initial population at the breakout of the pandemic;
Ef c0 , Epc0 , If c0 , Ipc0 , H0 and R0 are nonnegative initial subpopulations, and
β0 is the initial transmission rate which can be estimated from the data.
In practice, one typically assumes that S0 = N (0) > 0, so that at the
start of the pandemic there are only susceptibles, and all the other populations vanish. However, for the sake of generality, we allow initially the other
subpopulations to be nonnegative. Specifically, if the starting point is later
than the very first day of the pandemic,
N (0) = S0 + Ef c0 + Epc0 + If c0 + Ipc0 + H0 + R0 ,
so that (8) holds initially. A summary of the definitions of the model parameters is given in Table 1.
Equation (1) describes the rate of change, per day, of the susceptible population. The second term on the right-hand side is the rate at which the
susceptibles become infected by contact with exposed, infected, and hospitalized individuals. We emphasize that the exposed populations include the
asymptomatics that may cause infection. The last term describes the ‘natural’
(unrelated to the pandemic) mortality.
The rest of the equations, except (10), have a similar structure and interpretation. For instance, in (6) the rate of change, per day, of the hospitalized is
the sum of those who arrive from outside (say overflow in other locations), pH ,
and fully compliant and partially compliant infectives whose illness becomes
severe and need hospitalization, δ(If c + Ipc ), minus those who recovered on
that day, σH H, those who died naturally, µH, and those who died because of
the pandemic, dH H.
We note that in our model, the usual expression for the probability that
one susceptible is infected (per day), βI/N , is replaced with Γ . This means
that the values of β must be restricted, which we describe next.
Next, we describe equation (10), actually a differential inclusion, for the
change in the infectiveness of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. We assume a ‘simple’
linear relationship between the infection rate coefficient β and the fractions of
those who carry the virus and the recovered. In particular, an increase in the
fraction who have the virus and can infect others, (Ef c +Epc +If c +Ipc +H)/N ,
is assumed to make the virus more infective, while an increase in the fraction
of recovered, R/N , is assumed to increase the immunity of the population
leading to a decrease in the disease virulence. Finally, we use a subdifferential
(explained below) to guarantee that β remains in the admissible set [β∗ , β ∗ ],
where β∗ and β ∗ are appropriate values such that 0 ≤ β∗ < β ∗ . Let I[β∗ ,β ∗ ] (β)
be the indicator function of the interval [β∗ , β ∗ ], which vanishes when β is

10

in the interval and has the value +∞, otherwise. Then, its subdifferential,
∂I[β∗ ,β ∗ ] (β), is the set-valued function or multifunction

otherwise.
Adding this term guarantees that β∗ ≤ β(t) ≤ β ∗ for 0 ≤ t ≤ T . Indeed, when
β ∈ (β∗ , β ∗ ) then ζ = 0 and (9) is just a rate equation. When β(t) = β∗ then
there exists an element −ζ ∈ [0, ∞) that prevents β from becoming smaller
than β∗ ; and when β(t) = β ∗ there exists an element −ζ ∈ (−∞, 0] that
prevents β from exceeding β ∗ .
The number of active ‘documented’ or identified cases A(t), at time t, is
A(t) = If c (t) + Ipc (t) + H(t),
and, following (Worldometer 2021), we denote by Am (t) = If c (t) + Ipc (t) and
Ac (t) = H(t) those with an active mild condition, documented but not serious,
which can be with no symptoms, mild or medium symptoms, and those with
serious or critical conditions, respectively.
Next, CC(t), the cumulative or total number of cases, up to time t, is
CC(t) = A(t) + CR(t) + CD(t),

(13)

where the cumulative number of the recovered CR is given by

the daily number of deaths caused by the disease is

and the cumulative or total number of deaths CD(t) caused by the disease is
Z t
CD(t) = D0 +

The number of new cases on day t is given by
Cday (t) = CC(t) − CC(t − 1).

Finally, the cumulative number CA(t) of those who recovered from the
asymptomatic population is given by
Z t
CA(t) = σE
(Ef c (τ ) + Epc (τ )) dτ,

assuming that the initial number of the asymptomatic who recovered is zero.
In this way, the model provides insight into an important aspect of the
pandemic that is very difficult to obtain in the field.

3 Existence and uniqueness of the solution
Proving the existence of a unique solution to the model for each finite time
interval is a mathematically important next step. Without the differential
inclusion (10) and when θ is a known continuous and bounded function, the
local existence in time follows from the fact that the functions on the righthand sides of the equations are locally Lipschitz. Then, the existence of the
global solution is established by demonstrating that the solution stays bounded
on every finite time interval. This includes showing that given nonnegative
initial conditions, the solution components stay nonnegative, which is not only
necessary mathematically but also important for the model to be biologically
relevant. However, this is not the case in our model. Specifically, we allow θ
to be bounded and piecewise continuous, hence not continuous, and β is not
given but a solution of a differential inclusion. Therefore, the standard way
outlined above no longer works, requiring a more sophisticated approach that
we detail in what follows.
We assume that the input functions pS (t), . . . , pR (t) are bounded, nonnegative, and smooth and all the parameters, except for γE and γI , are positive
constants.
First, we assume that θ(t) is given and 0 ≤ θ(t) ≤ 1 for all t ∈ [0, T ], and
β is a given smooth function with values in [β∗ , β ∗ ] ⊂ (0, 1]. Below, we relax
the assumption that β is given.
Positivity of Ef c ; Epc ; If c ; Ipc ; H; R. We first establish the non-negativity of
the solutions of the system when the initial data is non-negative (except for
S0 > 0). To that end, let S0 > 0 and assume that the other initial conditions
satisfy Ef c0 , Epc0 , If c0 , Ipc0 , H0 , R0 ≥ ε > 0, and also pR ≥ ε. Below, we let
ε → 0. Thus, there exists T1 > 0, which we may assume to be the largest time,
such that the local solution exists and is unique on [0, T1 ). The continuity of
the solution implies that there is a maximal time t∗ , satisfying 0 < t∗ ≤ T1 ,
which may depend on ε, such that the solution is component-wise positive on
[0, t∗ ). Moreover, we have that N > 0 on [0, t∗ ], since otherwise if N (t∗ ) = 0
then by (8),
S(t∗ ) = Ef c (t∗ ) = Epc (t∗ ) = If c (t∗ ) = Ipc (t∗ ) = H(t∗ ) = R(t∗ ) = 0,
and it follows from (7) that at t = t∗ ,
dR
≥ ε > 0,
dt
which means that R is an increasing function at t∗ , and since R(t) > 0 on
[0, t∗ ), it is positive on [0, t∗ ], and then N > 0 on [0, t∗ ].
Then (9) implies that

0 ≤ Γ < 5β ∗ max Ef c , Epc , If c , Ipc , H := Γ ∗ ,

since Ef c , Epc , If c , Ipc , H < N and β ≤ β ∗ on [0, t∗ ]. It follows from (1) that
dS
≥ pS − (Γ ∗ + µ)S,
dt
on [0, t∗ ]. Since S0 > 0 and pS ≥ 0, then on [0, t∗ ],
S(t) ≥ S0 exp (−(Γ ∗ + µ)t) ≥ S0 exp(−(Γ ∗ + µ)t∗ ) > 0.
Next, we introduce the following notation for the sake of simplicity,
γ
bf c := γf c + γ + + σE + µ,
−

γ
bpc := γpc + γ + σE + µ,
δb := δ + σI + dI + µ,

(18)
(19)
(20)

and assume that the parameters satisfy
|γE | < min{b
γf c , γ
bpc },

b
|γI | < δ,

(21)

which is necessary to prove boundedness but also makes the model biologically
relevant.
Next, we consider (2) and since θΓ S ≥ 0 and Epc < N , we obtain
dEf c
≥ pEf c − (b
γf c + |γE |)Ef c ,
dt
and since pEf c ≥ 0, we find that Ef c (t) ≥ Ef c0 exp(−(b
γf c + |γE |)t∗ ) > 0 on
[0, t∗ ]. We now consider (3), and since pEpc ≥ 0, (1 − θ)Γ S ≥ 0 and Ef c < N ,
we have
dEpc
≥ pEpc − (b
γpc + |γE |) Epc ,
dt
therefore, Epc (t) ≥ Epc0 exp (−(b
γpc + |γE |)t∗ ) > 0 on [0, t∗ ].
The arguments concerning (4) and (5) are similar. Since pIf c ≥ 0, by
omitting all the nonnegative terms in (4), we find,
dIf c
≥ pIf c − (δb + |γI |)If c ,
dt
and hence, If c (t) ≥ If c0 exp(−(δb + |γI |)t∗ ) > 0 on [0, t∗ ]. Similarly, it follows
from (5) that Ipc (t) ≥ Ipc0 exp(−(δbf c + |γI |)t∗ ) > 0 on [0, t∗ ].
We turn to (6). Since pH ≥ 0 and δf c If c + δpc Ipc > 0, we have
dH
≥ −(σH + dH + µ)H,
dt
and so H(t) ≥ H0 exp (−(σH + dH + µ)t∗ ) > 0 on [0, t∗ ]. Finally, it follows
from (7) that
dR
> −µR,
dt
and hence R(t) > R0 exp(−µt∗ ) > 0 on [0, t∗ ].

We note that all the decay rates in the estimates above depend on the
problem data but are independent of ε, then all the variables S(t), . . . , R(t),
as well as N (t) and Γ (t), are positive on the closed interval [0, t∗ ], and since the
solution is continuous, we conclude that they are strictly positive on [0, T∗ ] for
some t∗ < T∗ < T1 , and by extension T∗ = T1 . Indeed, if S(t∗ ) = αS > 0 and
S is defined and continuous at t∗ , then there exists an interval (t∗ − ξ, t∗ + ξ),
for some ξ > 0, such that S(t) ≥ αS /2 on (t∗ − ξ, t∗ + ξ).
We conclude that when ε > 0, i.e., the initial conditions are positive, then
the solution is positive as long as it exists. However, it is noted that T∗ does
not depend on ε, and therefore, we have the following summary.
Proposition 1 Assume that (21) holds, S0 > 0, the other initial conditions
are nonnegative, and θ and β are bounded and positive. Then, the solution of
system (1)-(7) is positive as long as it exists.
Now that it is established that under the assumptions of Proposition 1, the
solution is positive as long as it exists, the only way it can cease to exist is
when one or more of the variables approaches infinity in finite time.
Boundedness of S, Ef c , Epc , If c , Ipc , H, R on finite intervals In the second step,
under the assumptions of Proposition 1, we show that each of S(t), . . . , R(t) is
bounded on every finite time interval, and therefore, the solution cannot approach infinity in finite time. This is sufficient to show that the solution exists
on each finite time interval. We begin with the interval of existence, [0, T1 ).
We note that since pS (t) is bounded and Γ > 0, equation (1) shows that
S(t) is bounded on every finite time interval it exists on. Using the definition
of γ
b1 given by (18) in equation (2), 0 ≤ θ ≤ 1, the bound on Γ given by (17),
and 0 < Epc /N < 1, yield
dEf c
< pEf c + Γ ∗ S − (b
γf c − |γE |)Ef c .
dt
Then, by assumption (21) that |γE | < γ
bf c and since pEf c and S are bounded,
it follows that Ef c is bounded. We now consider (3). Using the definition of
γ
bpc given by (19), 0 ≤ 1 − θ ≤ 1, and (17),
dEpc
< pEpc + Γ ∗ S − (b
γpc − |γE |)Epc .
dt
Since pEpc and S are bounded and γ
bpc > |γE |, it follows that Epc is bounded.
Next, using the definition of δb from (20) and 0 < Ipc /N < 1 in (4) and (5), we
obtain
dIf c
< pIf c + γf c Ef c + γ − Epc − (δb − |γI |)If c ,

14

A. Cesmelioglu et al.

from equations (6), (7) and the fact that pH , pR and Ef c , Epc , If c , Ipc are all
bounded independently of the choice of β ∈ [β∗ , β ∗ ].
We summarize the result as follows.
Proposition 2 Assume that S0 > 0, the other initial conditions are nonegative, and θ and β are bounded and positive. Moreover, assume that
|γE | < min{b
γf c , γ
bpc },

b
|γI | < δ.

Then, the solution of system (1)-(7) is positive and bounded on every finite
interval.
Before proceeding with the existence proof, we note that Γ (t) is bounded
and positive and the boundedness results above and equation (8) imply that
N (t) is bounded and positive on every finite interval. Furthermore, the differential set-inclusion (10) can be rewritten as
R
dβ
+ δ ∗ β + ∂φ (β) 3 δ∗ Γ,
dt
N

β (0) = β0 ∈ [β∗ , β ∗ ] ,

(22)

where φ(β) = I[β∗ ,β ∗ ] (β), and ∂φ(β) is its subdifferential, (12). Since φ in (22)
is convex and lower semicontinuous, its subdifferential ∂φ forces β to remain
in the interval [β∗ , β ∗ ].
Existence and uniqueness To use the powerful tools of convex analysis for the
existence and uniqueness proof, we first reformulate the problem in an abstract
form. Letting
x = (S, Ef c , Epc , If c , Ipc , H, R),
the system defined by equations (1)–(7) together with (8) and (9), can be
written as
x0 = F (t, x, β, θ) , x (0) = x0 ,
(23)
where F is Lipschitz in x, β and θ; β is a given continuous function having
values in [β∗ , β ∗ ]; and θ and is bounded with values in [0, 1].
We first assume that θ is continuous. Below, we relax this assumption and
allow it to be piecewise continuous. Let β and β̂ be two continuous functions
such that β(t), β̂(t) ∈ [β∗ , β ∗ ] for all t ∈ [0, T ]. We let x and x̂ be the solutions
to (23) corresponding to β and β̂, respectively. Then, using straightforward
computations, as in (Hale 2009; Kuttler 2017; Richard Bellman 1995), we
obtain a constant C > 0, independent of β and β̂, such that

Here, K is an appropriate Lipschitz constant that depends on the estimates

modifying the constants,

The Lipschitz continuity of F ensures the existence and uniqueness of a
solution to the initial value problem with given β and continuous θ (see e.g.,
Theorem 2.4 (Boyce and DiPrima 1986)).
We summarize the result of the discussion above as follows.
Proposition 3 Assume that β is a continuous function having values in [β∗ , β ∗ ].
Then, there exists a unique solution to the initial value problem defined by (1)–
(7), together with (8) and (9), and the initial conditions (11). Moreover, if x, x̂
are two solutions corresponding to β and β̂, then (24) holds for a constant C
that is independent of β.
Now, let β ∈ C ([0, T ]) such that β (t) ∈ [β∗ , β ∗ ] for all t. Then, we use the
solution that exists by Proposition 3 to construct a solution to the evolution
inclusion (22), based on the following well-known theorem of Brézis (Brézis
1973). In our case the Hilbert space is R and we assume that β0 ∈ [β∗ , β ∗ ].
Theorem 2 Let H be a Hilbert space. Let f ∈ L2 (0, T ; H) . Let φ be a lower
semicontinuous convex proper function defined on H and β0 be in the domain
of φ. Then, there exists a unique solution β ∈ L2 (0, T ; H) , β 0 ∈ L2 (0, T ; H) ,
to
β 0 (t) + ∂φ (β (t)) 3 f (t)
a.e. t,
β (0) = β0 .
We also have the following result:
Corollary 1 In addition to the assumptions of Theorem 2, suppose f (t) is
replaced with f (t) β, where f ∈ L∞ (0, T ; H). Then, there exists a unique
solution to the resulting inclusion.
Proof Let β̂ ∈ C ([0, T ] ; H) and let F (β̂) be the solution of
β 0 (t) + ∂φ (β (t)) 3 f (t) β̂.

(25)

Then, standard manipulations and the monotonicity of the subgradient, for
F (β̂) and F (β̄), yield
Z t

|(F (β̂) − F (β̄))(t)|2H ≤

This implies,

and shows that a sufficiently high power of F is a contraction map. Hence, F
has a unique fixed point that is the unique solution of the evolution inclusion
(25).

16

A. Cesmelioglu et al.

Now, we turn to the whole problem defined by (1)–(11) and construct
a mapping Θ : C([0, T ]) → C([0, T ]) as follows. Let β̄ ∈ C ([0, T ]) having
values in [β∗ , β ∗ ]. Then, it follows from Proposition 3 that the solution to
the initial value problem for such fixed β̄ is unique. Now, we define a map
Θ : C([0, T ]) → C([0, T ]) where Θ(β̄) = β, is the solution of (22) for the given
β̄. We write the equation for β, given β̄, as
R(β̄)
dβ
β + ∂φ(β) 3 δ∗ βF (β̄),
+ δ∗
dt
N (β̄)

β(0) = β0 ∈ [β∗ , β ∗ ].

Since the estimates above do not depend on the choice of β̄, as long as it has
values in [β∗ , β ∗ ] , the differential inclusion is of the form
dβ
+ ∂φ(β) 3 G(t, x̄, β̄),
dt

β (0) = β0 ∈ [β∗ , β ∗ ] ,

where x̄ is the solution to the initial value problem with given β̄, and G is a
Lipschitz continuous function in both x̄ and β̄.
To proceed, we let β̄1 and β̄2 be given with the properties as above, and
let Θ(β̄1 ) ≡ β1 and Θ(β̄2 ) ≡ β2 . Then, it follows from the inclusion and the
monotonicity of ∂φ and routine computations that there exists a constant
C > 0, independent of β and a suitable Lipschitz constant K, such that
Z t
1
|β1 (t) − β2 (t)|2 ≤ 2CK 2
(|β̄1 − β̄2 |2 + |x̄1 − x̄2 |2 )ds.

It follows from (24), after modifying the constants, that

Therefore, a sufficiently high power of Θ is a contraction mapping, and it
has a unique fixed point that is the solution to the problem. This completes
the proof of the existence and uniqueness of the solution of the full problem
assuming the given function θ is continuous.
To take into account a piecewise continuous θ, we assume that there are
finitely many non-overlapping time intervals {Ii } and continuous functions
θi (t) defined on Ii such that θ (t) = θi (t) on the interior of Ii . Then, on each
interval where θ is continuous, we have a unique solution obtained as above,
and it is straightforward to piece these into a global solution of the problem.
This leads to the main mathematical result in this work.
Theorem 3 Assume that θ is bounded and piecewise continuous and
|γE | < min{b

|γI | < δ,

(26)

where γ

solution to problem (1)–(11) on every finite time interval [0, T ].

Mathematical model of COVID-19

We note that in the model the assumptions on γE and γI make sense, although
it is possible to remove them at the expense of considerable additional effort
in obtaining the estimates.
Finally, since β has values in [β∗ , β ∗ ] and its derivative is in L2 (0, T ), it
follows that β is Hölder continuous with exponent 1/2. Therefore, the solution
is at least in C 1,1/2 (0, T ). It seems plausible that the regularity is higher since
β 0 ∈ L∞ (0, T ) and then it is Hölder continuous with exponent 1, however, we
leave the question open as part of further study of the solution’s regularity.

4 Randomness in system parameters
For the sake of completeness, this short section provides a rather abstract
discussion about adding randomness to the system parameters. This allows
a better understanding of the model’s dependence on the parameter values.
Moreover, to use the model as a predictive tool, it is crucial to find out how
parameter changes affect model predictions. Small changes in the solution that
are caused by small changes in a parameter indicate that there is low sensitivity to the parameter and an approximate value is sufficient for acceptable
predictions, while considerable changes in the solution caused by small changes
in the parameter values indicate that a more precise parameter value is needed
to obtain reliable predictions. It may also indicate that the model is unstable
or the process itself is unstable, in which case attempts at prediction may be
of little use.
We now introduce randomness into the system parameters. For the sake of
generality, we note that we have 38 system parameters including the 7 initial
conditions, as listed in Table 1 and let the probability space be (Ω, F, P ), where
Ω is the sample space, a box centered at the origin of R38 ; F is the Borel σalgebra, and P is a general probability function. We let ω ∈ Ω be the random
variable and define
ω=ω
b + ω,
(ω ∈ ω
b + Ω) ,
where ω
b denotes the vector containing the optimized parameters. We note that
the choice of Ω is such that ω ≥ 0 (component-wise).
Next, we consider the modified system (1)–(9) and (11), in the form
x0 = F (t, x, β, ω) ,

b (ω),
x0 (0) = x

b (ω) = x0 + ω̄, ω̄ ∈ Ω, together with the differential inclusion
where x
dβ e∗ R(ω)
+δ
β + ∂φ (β) 3 δ∗ Γ (ω),
dt
N (ω)

β (0) = β0 ∈ [β∗ , β ∗ ] .

Here, ∂φ(β) = I[β∗ ,β ∗ ] (β) is defined by (12). The function F depends on ω
such that ω → F (t, x, β, ω) is measurable, F is Lipschitz continuous in x and
β and is continuous in all of the first three variables.
It follows from the recent results in (Kuttler et al. 2016) that the uniqueness
of the solutions for each fixed ω implies that the functions ω → x (·, ω) , ω →

18

A. Cesmelioglu et al.

β (·, ω) and ω → F (·, x (·, ω) , β (·, ω) , ω) are each measurable into C ([0, T ]).
Moreover, ω → β 0 (·, ω) is measurable into L2 (0, T ), and then it follows from
Theorem 3.3 in (Kuttler et al. 2016) that (t, ω) → β 0 (t, ω) can be considered
as a product measurable function.

5 Stability of the DFE and the EE
This section discusses the stability of the critical points of the system: the
disease-free equilibrium (DFE) and the endemic equilibrium (EE) (when it
exists), based on the system’s Jacobian matrix. The usual approach, see e.g.,
(Allen 2007; Hethcote 2000; Thieme 2003), is to derive the basic stability number RC . In simple SEIR models, RC coincides with the basic reproduction
number R0 , however, in more complex models the expression is naturally as
complex as the model. When RC < 1, all the eigenvalues of the Jacobian,
evaluated at the DFE, have negative real parts, which indicates that the DFE
is asymptotically stable (i.e., stable and attracting), and there is no EE. On
the other hand, RC = 1 is a bifurcation point, and when RC > 1 at least one
of the real parts is positive and the DFE loses its stability. Usually, when the
DFE becomes unstable the EE appears and is stable and attracting. However,
because of the complexity of our model, we did not find a closed-form expression for RC , so, instead, we derived the Jacobian of the system (Appendix A)
assuming that β is constant and evaluated it numerically at the DFE.
To proceed, we assume that β = β0 ∈ [β∗ , β ∗ ] and the population is constant, that is, the number of ‘natural’ COVID-19 unrelated deaths is balanced
by pS , and so pS = µN and pEf c , . . . , pR vanish and the disease-related deaths
that happened on the way to the DFE are not included, that is, dI = dH = 0,
since the DFE excludes any infection. We let the solution

x(t) = (S(t), Ef c (t), Epc (t), If c (t), Ipc (t), H(t), R(t)),

represent the trajectory of the system in R7+ , for 0 ≤ t ≤ T . Then, the DFE
contains only susceptibles, that is,

DF E = (N, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),

and the force of infection vanishes, Γ = 0.

We note that the model contains 29 parameters and seven initial conditions.
However, in the computations we use three theta values instead of one so
there are 31 parameters and seven initial conditions, which are optimized.

We remark that a rather technical and involved analysis is needed to establish rigorously that when the DFE is stable and attracting,
lim x(t) = DF E,

t→∞

for all nonnegative initial conditions, and the EE does not exist. And when
the DFE loses its stability, the EE appears and is stable and attracting. We
leave this theoretical question open here and remark about it in Section 8.

6 Numerical Simulations
This section describes the approach to our computer simulations of the model.
We use MATLAB’s ode45 ODEs solver together with fmincon constrained optimization routine to determine the value of the optimized model parameters
that minimize the `1 −deviation of the model predictions for the total number of cases and deaths and the seven-day averaged numbers of daily cases
and deaths from the given data. To be specific, to find some of the model
parameters, we minimize the objective function:

where Ndata is the total number of data points, ω ∈ R38 is the parameter set,
CC(ω, tn ), CD(ω, tn ), DC(ω, tn ) and DD(ω, tn ) are the model predictions
using ω for the cumulative cases, cumulative deaths, daily cases and daily
d n , CD
d n , DC
d n and DD
d n denote the
deaths, respectively, on day n, and CC
actual reported cumulative cases, cumulative deaths, 7-day averages of the
daily cases, and daily deaths, respectively, on day n.
Table 1 summarizes the meaning of the model parameters in ω. For the
model to make sense, we impose the following constraints:

γ

(29) guarantees that in equation (2) the number of those that leave compartment Ef c , per day, does not exceed the number of the individuals in that
compartment. The other conditions in (29) have similar interpretations.

7 COVID-19 in The Republic of Korea
This section presents the model simulations of the pandemic’s dynamics in
South Korea, which is chosen because it is one of the first countries that went
through the pandemic cycle and the complete unbiased data is available on the
web, in particular in (Worldometer 2021). As of Aug. 8, 2020, the pandemic
there is under control, with minor outbreaks. The values of the optimized
baseline parameters and their intervals of feasibility can be found in Table 2.
The total population N (0) and the COVID-19 unrelated death rate µ are fixed
constants obtained from South Korea’s population data and are not part of
the optimization process. We solved the ODEs of Model 1 numerically using
these optimized parameters predicting the pandemic’s near future.
As noted above, the values in Table 2 were obtained by an `1 optimization
routine in MATLAB that compares the model predictions for the total number
of cases and the total number of deaths as well as the seven-day averaged
daily cases and deaths with the data taken from (Worldometer 2021) for the
time period of 100 days, from 15 Feb. until 25 May 2020. It is important
to emphasize that the model uses past data and, therefore, cannot predict
outcomes resulting from major changes in the virus behavior, new mutations,
change in population behavior, new policies and directives, or the environment.
However, the model predictions for the following 75 days are very close to what

22

A. Cesmelioglu et al.

was observed in the field, as we show below. Then, by modifying only θ, the
model predictions can fit very well for more than a year.
7.1 Baseline simulations
We start with the baseline simulation, using the parameters in Table 2. To
properly describe the South Korean government’s response to the pandemic,
we use the following values of θ: the lock-down order was declared on day 8,
and the relaxation of the directive started on day 81. To represent these policy
changes in the model, we set


if t < 8,
θ1 = 0.01
θ = θ2 = 0.995 if 8 ≤ t < 81,


θ3 = 0.352 if 81 ≤ t ≤ 175.
These values were obtained by the optimization subroutine and in particular,
we note that θ = 0.995 for days 8 − 80 corresponds to very effective control
directives and a highly compliant population.
The cumulative number of COVID-19 cases and the cumulative number of
deaths are depicted in Figure 2 for the period of 175 days, from 15 Feb. until
8 Aug. 2020. The red filled circles are the field data for the first 100 days of
the pandemic (15 Feb. until 25 May), (Worldometer 2021), which were used
to optimize the parameters, while the green filled squares depict subsequent
data (26 May till 8 Aug.). The agreement between the green filled squares
and the blue line, which is a measure of the model’s predictive ability, is good
for the cumulative number of cases, although it slightly under-predicts the
more recent cases, however, the prediction is remarkable for the total deaths.
We note the model does not fully capture the initial exponential growth in
the number of cases, while it does so well with the number of deaths. The
median discrepancy in the cumulative cases is 182 and the median error in the
cumulative deaths is 4.4.
Fig. 3 depicts the daily cases and deaths, respectively, for the same simulations. To allow for a better comparison, in addition to the data (red filled
circles and green filled squares) we also introduce, similarly to various web
publications, a seven-day moving average (red curve), i.e., averaging the data
over the previous seven days (or a part of them at the beginning). Even though
there is considerable randomness in the daily data while the simulations don’t
admit randomness, and the numbers of cases are rather small, the daily case
predictions follow the trends surprisingly well. We conclude that the model
captures well the known details of the pandemic in South Korea.
Furthermore, the form of the model allows us to investigate the behavior
of the other subpopulations, which are usually hard to assess and are not
reported separately. This provides further details and considerable insight into
the disease dynamics. Fig. 4 depicts the model predictions of (for the sake of
simplicity) the combined daily numbers of exposed, Ef c + Epc , and of infected
If c +Ipc , noting that the corresponding data is not available (in open sources).

Fig. 2: Model predictions (blue curves) of the cumulative cases (top) and deaths (bottom);
175 days from 15 Feb. until 8 Aug. 2020. The red filled circles are the 100 days of field
data used in the optimization, the green filled squares depict subsequent data. θ changed
from θ1 = 0.010 to θ2 = 0.995 on day 8 (vertical dashed lines) and to θ3 = 0.352 on day
81 (vertical dash-dotted lines). The median error in the cumulative cases was 182 and the
maximum error was 1847 (on day 11); the median error in the cumulative deaths was 4.4
and the maximum error was 18 (on day 174).

Fig. 5 depicts the simulation results for the other three subpopulations: the
number of susceptibles S (top left), the number of hospitalized H (top right)
and the number of recovered R (bottom left). The number of hospitalized H
should be known precisely to the authorities, but it was not available online
for comparison. Finally, and this is one of the main contributions of this work,
we show in Fig. 5 (lower right) that the decrease in the contact rate β in
the South Korea case over 175 days is very small. This is likely due to their
success in the first 175 days in controlling the spread of the disease. Running
the simulation for 1, 000 days shows a decrease to β = 0.094 hence as time
increases β changes more noticeably. For countries with uncontrolled disease
spread we expect more significant variation in β. Therefore, considering the
infection rate as a dependent variable in that case would lead to more accurate
model predictions.
To determine the stability of the DFE, we found numerically the eigenvalues of the Jacobian at the DFE using (27). We used the baseline parameters,
except for setting pS = µN , pIf c = . . . = pR = 0, dI = dH = 0, so that the
population is constant, β = 0.094, and θ = 0.995. Then, the eigenvalues were
approximately
−1.7 10−5 , −1.7 10−5 , −0.273, −0.0188, −0.089, −0.102, −0.158.
Thus, (when θ = 0.995) all the eigenvalues are real and negative, so the DFE
is stable and attracting.

Fig. 3: Model predictions (blue curves) of the daily cases of infection (top) and deaths
(bottom), and seven-day moving averages of the data (red curves); 175 days from 15 Feb.
until 8 Aug. 2020. The red filled circles are the 100 days of field data used in the optimization,
the green filled squares depict subsequent data. The red curves are the seven-day moving
averages of the data. θ changed from θ1 = 0.01 to θ2 = 0.995 on day 8 and to θ3 = 0.352 on
day 81.

Hypothetical long runs with θ = 0.995 result in very slow convergence to
the DFE, because the first two eigenvalues are very close to zero. Indeed, it
took over 1, 000 days to see partial convergence to the limit.
As noted above, we found that the DFE looses its stability at θ∗ ≈ 0.034,
which is a bifurcation value when the real part of at least one of the eigenvalues
becomes positive, and the DFE becomes unstable. Then, theoretically, the EE
appears. Long-time simulations with θ = 0.352, the value on day 81 when the
directives were relaxed (which is above the critical value), show, as expected,
that the DFE is stable and attracting.
Using the baseline parameters, except for pS = µN , pIf c = . . . = pR = 0,
dI = dH = 0, β = 0.094, and θ = 0.352, shows that the eigenvalues of the
Jacobian at the DFE are approximately
−1.7 10−5 ,

−1.7 10−5 , −0.0242, −0.0184, −0.2384, −0.1517, −0.1580.

Thus, (when θ = 0.352) the DFE is stable and after running the simulation for
1, 000 days (with constant population of 51 million), we found approximately
S = 50, 971, 000, Ef c = 0, Epc = 0, If c = 0, Ipc = 0, H = 0, R = 29, 000.
Since there are no new infections, R → 0 because of natural deaths, but very
slowly.

Fig. 5: Baseline simulation. The daily numbers of susceptibles S (top left); hospitalized
H (top right); recovered R (bottom left); and the slight decrease in the disease infectivity
β (bottom right). 175 days from 15 Feb. until 8 Aug. 2020. θ changed from θ1 = 0.01 to
θ2 = 0.995 on day 8 and to θ3 = 0.352 on day 81.

Model simulations with the baseline parameters for 175 days gives for the
cumulative cases, deaths, and asymptomatics, respectively (approximately):
CC = 14, 058,

CD = 322,

CA = 5, 634,

26

A. Cesmelioglu et al.

and
CF R = 0.022,

IF R = 0.016.

Simulations with baseline parameters listed in Table 2 for 1, 000 days (i.e.,
asymptotically) yields the following projections:
CC = 53, 216,

CD = 1, 188,

CF R = 0.021,

CA = 23, 312,

IF R = 0.015.

We see that the CF R and the IF R are essentially constant. We refer to
Subsection 7.3 for additional discussion.
We remark that at the end of 1, 000 days, β decreased to β = 0.094, which
indicates that allowing β to be a variable may be of importance. On the other
hand, since there were changes in the various directives following day 175, our
asymptotic numbers on day 1, 000 are more of an ‘if’ case.
We next note that in Spain (Pollán et al. 2020), about a third of the
individuals who have developed antibodies were asymptomatic, that is, they
did not develop any clinical symptoms and were undocumented until tested
for antibodies. Using (16), we obtain that the fractions of such cases in South
Korea for 175 days and for 1, 000 days, respectively, are:
5, 634
≈ 40.1%,
14, 058

23, 312
≈ 43.8%.
53, 216

Therefore about 40% of the infections were not detected. This implies that
asymptomatic infections contribute silently but substantially to the spread of
the disease and more widespread testing for asymptomatics may be necessary.
Since our model predictions for the first 175 days agree well with the data,
we have enough confidence in our model to proceed with the study of the other
aspects of the pandemic.

7.2 Effectiveness of control and θ
We study next the effectiveness of the control measures in South Korea that are
used to contain the pandemic, lumped together, and described in the model
by the parameter θ. To that end, we conduct three hypothetical computer
experiments showing the model predictions for different control measures. We
use three other values of θ, representing different responses of the government
and the population to the pandemic. In these simulations, the θ values are
applied on day one and do not change over the 175 days of simulation. In the
first simulation, we choose θ = 0.5, which means that there are some control
measures but they are not very strict; in the second simulation θ = 0.2; and in
the third simulation, θ = 0.1, that is, very few control measures are in place.
All the other system parameters are kept at their baseline values reported in
Table 2. We note in passing that if any one of these cases was realized, some

Mathematical model of COVID-19

27

of the system parameters would have been different, and it is very likely that
the outcome would have been worse.

Fig. 6 shows that when θ = 0.5 the number of cumulative cases and deaths
on day 175 (8 Aug. 2020) would increase 1.3-fold approximately. Specifically,
on that day the predicted cases would be about 19, 739 and deaths about 425,
whereas the real data was at 14, 562 and 304, respectively.

circles are the 100 days of field data used in the optimization, the green filled squares depict
subsequent data.

Next, Fig. 7 shows that when θ = 0.2, the number of cumulative cases
would be more than 5-fold and the number of deaths on day 175 would be
more than 4-fold. Specifically, the model predicts that on day 175 there would
be about 73, 288 cases and 1, 276 deaths.
Finally, it is seen in Fig. 8 that if θ = 0.1 the number of cumulative cases on
day 175 would have jumped more than 10-fold and the number of cumulative
deaths more than 7-fold. Specifically, on day 175, the model predicts about
158, 613 cases and 2, 387 deaths.
Furthermore, it is common sense to expect that less control measures would
lead to worse outcomes and this is confirmed by our model predictions showing
substantially worse consequences with relaxed control measures. Indeed, higher
values of θ are quite effective in avoiding large scale disruptions of the health
care system, and all other state and economic systems because of the pandemic.

7.3 The COVID-19 death rates in South Korea
Since there is a considerable discussion in the literature and especially in
the media, about the COVID-19 death rates, we use the baseline simulations
to determine two death rates, (see, e.g.,(Wikipedia 2020a)). The first, the case
fatality rate (CFR), µ∗∗
cov19 (t), is the ratio of the total deaths caused by the
disease to all those who have been diagnosed (or documented) with the disease,
and this includes the current infectives, hospitalized, and those who recovered

Mathematical model of COVID-19

29

or died, and is given by
CF R = µ∗∗
cov19 (t) =

CD(t)
.
CC(t)

Here, CD(t) is the cumulative number of deaths, (14), and CC(t), (13), is the
cumulative number of infected, up to time t. The second, the infection fatality
rate (IFR), µ∗cov19 (t), is the ratio of the deaths to all those who had the virus,
including the asymptomatics, and is given as

% of CC+CA with fatal outcome % of CC with fatal outcome

Fig. 9 shows that on day 175 (8 Aug 2020) the CFR was approximately
2.16% and the IFR was 1.57%. According to the official KCDC (Korea Disease
Control and Prevention Agency (KCDC) 2020), on that day there were 304
deaths and 14, 562 cases, hence the ‘official’ CF R = 2.09% was slightly less
than the model prediction. Whereas the CF R = µ∗∗
cov19 can be found in official
publication, the IF R = µ∗cov19 cannot, since it includes those who were never
officially counted as having the virus, and usually one has to revert to different
ways of estimating it. Thus, our model provides a means to estimate this death
rate that has been used (often loosely) in the media.

8 Conclusions and further research
This work presents a new compartmental model of the SEIR-type for the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic, in particular allowing the assessment of
the effectiveness of the related disease control and containment measures. The
model’s novelty is two-fold. First, the populations are split into those who follow fully all the control measures and those who follow only partially, such as
essential workers who need to be mobile and cannot socially distance, or those
who choose to only partially follow the directives. The split is controlled by
the parameter θ that also takes indirectly into account the ‘quality’ of these
measures. Second, the infection contact rate coefficient β(t) is a dependent
variable, the dynamics of which is governed by a differential inclusion, (10).
This takes into account the intrinsic variability of β due to various causes of
infection rate changes, such as changes in the population behavior or improvements in treatments.
Since the model is complex and includes a differential inclusion, the existence of its unique solution on every finite time interval is established by a
nonstandard proof, using results from convex analysis. The positivity of the solutions is also established. Moreover, when the data is measurable with respect
to any random variables, then so are the solutions.
Several baseline simulations, in MATLAB, of the disease dynamics were
conducted for South Korea. The optimal model parameters were obtained by
an (`1 based) optimization routine fitting the model solutions with the data
of both cumulative and daily cases and deaths. In particular, the parameter
θ that controls the split between fully and partially compliant populations is
found to be 0.010 for the first eight days, on day eight (22 Feb. 2020) when a
lock-down and strict control measures were implemented, it jumped to 0.995
and as the control measures started to ease on day 81 (6 May 2020) it dropped
to 0.352. The baseline simulations show that the model captures the disease
dynamics very well when compared to the data for daily cases and deaths (with
seven day moving averages) and cumulative cases and deaths. Furthermore, it
provides additional information about the pandemic dynamics that are difficult
to observe in the field, such as 40% asymptomatics.
One of the model conclusions, when applied to South Korea, is that their
success in controlling and reducing the infection rates is related to having a
period of 73 days in which θ = 0.995, which indicates that the majority of the
population adhered to the national directives and disease control measures,
which in turn were consistent and clearly applied.
In addition, our model predicts substantially worse consequences with relaxed control measures which makes sense as it is common sense to expect
that less control measures would lead to worse outcomes. Indeed, higher values of θ are quite effective to avoid large scale disruptions of the health care
system, and all other state and economic systems because of the pandemic.
This, however, is in the absence of vaccinations.
To gain further insight into the model predictions, we studied the system’s
equilibrium points. Due to the complexity of the model, instead of finding a

Mathematical model of COVID-19

31

basic stability number RC , we used the the eigenvalues of the system Jacobian.
We found that the disease-free equilibrium (DFE) is asymptotically stable
when θ = 0.995 and becomes unstable when θ∗ ≈ 0.034, and since we used
θ = 0.352 from day 81 onward, the DFE is stable and attracting.
We also used the baseline simulations to compute the death rates and found
that the case fatality rate was CF R = 2.16% and the infection fatality rate
was IF R = 1.57% on day 175, as shown in Fig. 9. The simulations for 1, 000
days show that the rates are essentially the same.
The next topic we investigated was the effectiveness of the disease containment measures controlled by the values of θ. Simulations with θ = 0.5, 0.2, 0.1
show that not using sufficient control measures would have caused a substantial increase in the number of cases and deaths. Indeed, for θ = 0.1 there would
be more than a 10-fold increase in cases and 7-fold increase in fatalities. These
results were obtained without taking into account large-scale vaccination.
An important result that the model provided is that the asymptomatics,
those who were carry the virus without symptoms, constituted about 40% of
the cases. This is very important information that is very difficult and costly
to obtain in the field.
We also performed a partial sensitivity study of the models dependence on
θ, and the infection rates of the exposed (γf c , γpc ). We found that the model is
sensitive to these parameters. Thus, to obtain reliable predictions, these model
parameters need to be estimated accurately. However, since we did not conduct
a full sensitivity analysis with respect to the full set of 38 model parameters,
we did not present these impartial results in this work.
We now describe some of the unresolved issues that may be of interest for
further study:
(i) Add the effects of large-scale vaccination to the model and study the
model predictions. This will bring the model up-to-date and entails modest
modifications of the model.
(ii) Modify the model to take into account new variants of the SARS-CoV2. This entails major modifications of the model.
(iii) Replace the jump of θ to 0.352 after day 81 when the lock-down control
measures started to ease, with an appropriate function of time, θ = θ(t).
(iv) Compare the model prediction of the hospitalized H(t), (Fig. 5 top
right), and the field data.
(v) Introduce more θ-like parameters to allow for the separate assessment
of the control measures, such as wearing a face mask in public, washing hands
often, keeping distance in public spaces, and following the instructions. However, such an expansion may result in a more complex model that may be
more difficult to work with.
From the mathematical point of view, it may be of interest to:
Establish rigorously the bifurcation property in θ; the convergence of the
solutions to the DFE when it is stable and attracting, and the convergence to
the EE when it exists. Determine that there are no other equilibrium points
and analyze in more depth the properties of the two states. Study more thor-

oughly the differential inclusion for β, consider alternative formulations based
on more general biological information about the disease based on published
observations. Find the optimal regularity of the solutions. Study alternative
objective functionals by assigning different weights for the number of cases
and deaths and using an `2 -type minimization.
We conclude that the model has been sufficiently validated for the pandemic in South Korea. It both provides insight and allows for ‘mathematical
experiments.’ We plan to use it for other countries and states for which reliable
data can be found.

Appendix A

Jacobian of the system

This appendix constructs an expression for the system’s Jacobian assuming
that β = const.
For this purpose, we write equations (1)–(7) using the notation introduced
in (5) as
dx(t)
= f (t),
dt
where the components of f (t) are given by

f1 (t) = pS − Γ S − µS,

f5 (t) = pIpc + γpc Epc + γ Ef c − δIpc − If c Ipc ,
N
f6 (t) = pH + δ(If c + Ipc ) − σ

f2 (t) = pEf c + θΓ S − γ
bf c Ef c +

f7 (t) = pR + σE (Ef c + Epc ) + σI (If c + Ipc ) + σH H − µR.

The Jacobian matrix of the system is
