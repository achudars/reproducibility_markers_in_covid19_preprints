Abstract
The current pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 has caused extensive
damage to society. The characterization of SARS-CoV-2 prpfiles
has been addressed by researchers globally with the aim of
resolving this disruptive crisis. This investigation process
is indispensable for an understanding of how SARS-CoV-2
behaves in human host cells. However, little is known about
the systematic molecular mechanisms involved in the effect
of SARS-CoV-2 infection on human host cells. Here, we
have presented gene-to-gene regulatory networks in response to
SARS-CoV-2 using a Bayesian network model. We examined
the dynamic changes of the SARS-CoV-2-purturbated networks
established by our proposed framework for gene network
analysis, revealing that interferon signaling gradually switches
to the subsequent inflammatory-cytokine signaling cascades.
Furthermore, we have succeeded in capturing a COVID-19
patient-specific network in which transduction of these signalings is coincidently induced. This enabled us to explore local
regulatory systems influenced by SARS-CoV-2 in host cells more
precisely at an individual level. Our panel of network analyses
has provided new insight into SARS-CoV-2 research from the
perspective of cellular systems.

Introduction
The newly emerging coronavirus, severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has spread rapidly
over the world (1, 2), with more than 22,000,000 cases of
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and 790,000 deaths
as of August 21, 2020 (3). This pandemic outbreak has
drastically changed our society, and has compelled us to stay
alert to the continuous risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection (4). To
overcome this dire situation, the development of novel drugs
or vaccines is still an urgent global challenge. During the
therapeutic development process, the elucidation of cellular
mechanisms is essential for the discovery of potential targets;
the fundamental question to be solved is how SARS-CoV-2
influences host cells and causes COVID-19 at the molecular
level. However, these cellular mechanisms for COVID-19 are
poorly understood.
High-throughput technologies have contributed to the acquisition of a large amount of “omics” data, which has
provided comprehensive information on the cellular systems.
These technologies have also featured during the current
research into SARS-CoV-2. Several reports have provided

various clues to understanding the global cellular signatures
in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection at both the proteome
and transcriptome level (5–7). Recently, network-based
approaches have stimulated great interest in the use of
these emerging omics data for drug discovery and systems
biological analysis in the current SARS-CoV-2 field (8–13).
Their major approaches combine publicly available sources,
including knowledge of the already established pathways
and drugs with these omics data to reconstruct molecular
networks. However, these networks do not sufficiently
represent a real-world cellular system owing to two main
reasons: 1) public data consist of heterogeneous knowledge
that has been accumulated throughout the longstanding
biological researches; and 2) the previous works use mixed
networks that combine data from various samples, but cannot
reflect an individual cell-/patient- specific network.
To address these problems, we recently developed a method
to extract a core sample-specific network from a massive
gene network generated from a Bayesian network (14).
Gene regulatory network estimation has been developed as
a prospective method to model the cellular system using
omics data (15–19). Although Bayesian network-based approach can infer the cause-and-effect relationships between
genes with transcriptome data, the key issue has been to
extract biologically significant information from the huge and
complicated network, which is often sarcastically referred
to as a hairball (20). Our unique framework consists
of three steps: 1) estimation of a global gene network;
2) extraction of context-specific core networks based on
differences in molecular systems from the global network;
and 3) identification of a sample or patient specific network
(Fig. 1). The prominent advantage is that it enables us to
identify putative context-specific or sample-specific potential
sets of edges in the form of a network, i.e., gene-to-gene
relationships with directions, as well as nodes.
In this study, by using our developed framework for gene
network analysis, we have presented the core host cellular
systems involved in SARS-CoV-2 over several in vitro
experiments; different viral loads, cell lines, and respiratory viruses. No studies have been performed on the
computational data-driven gene regulatory network approach
regarding SARS-CoV-2. We characterized interferon signaling and subsequent inflammatory signaling cascades as
significantly changed networks in human host cells, which
represent the innate antiviruses-immune system in response
to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, given that the recent
studies have reported that patients with COVID-19 exhibit

various clinical outcomes depending on each patient, and
that a certain proportion of patients will experience a severe
disease (21–23), it is much more important to reveal the
cellular mechanisms causing these clinical symptoms at an
individual level. To this end, we have further identified the
gene networks specifically for patients with COVID-19. We
believe that our landscape of gene networks is beneficial to
achieve an understanding of how cellular systems respond to
SARS-CoV-2 and to further drug development.

Results
Estimation of basal gene network in the involvement
of respiratory viruses infection using a Bayesian
network. We first characterized a global gene network

(hereafter referred to as the basal network) using a Bayesian
network (see Methods) with a transcriptome dataset involved
in the engagement of respiratory virus infection, including
SARS-CoV-2, in several human cell lines (7). To determine a
basal network structure, we performed a network estimation
using the neighbor node sampling and repeat algorithm (24),
and screened the best algorithm parameters for the target
dataset, as described in our previous study (14). Briefly, the
network estimation was run three times independently, and
the subsequent concordance test was performed to ensure the
robustness and stability of the estimated basal network. We
confirmed that the iteration number T = 500, 000 satisfies
less than 5% error (Error = 4.0% for T = 500, 000; error =
5.3% for T = 300, 000). The final basal network comprised
127,126 edges and 15,258 nodes, with a threshold of 0.05 and
an average degree of 16.7. We used this final basal network
for the subsequent analyses.

of host cellular system dynamics during the increase of
SARS-CoV-2 viral loads, we aimed to characterize the
networks perturbated by SARS-CoV-2 with two viral loads; a
low multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.2 and a high MOI of
2 in A549 cells. We expected that cells exposed to different
viral loads each present a unique cellular system, and that our
approach could capture the fluctuation of system dynamics
in whole cellular systems. To obtain differential core gene
networks for each viral load, we followed the multiple
steps using an edge quantification technique, called edge
contribution value (ECv), established in our previous study
(14). We first calculated ∆ECvs following the Eq. (2) where
S = SARS-CoV-2 infected and T = mock samples for each
MOI condition (see Methods). The distributions of ∆ECv
showed that the innate cellular system was more extensively
perturbated in the cells exposed to the high MOI than the
low MOI (Fig. 2A). We next set a threshold of 1 for ∆ECv
and obtained differentially regulated edges (DREs) from the
basal network. The Venn analysis for the ∆ECv-extracted
DREs showed that the number of DREs in the high MOI
was larger than in the low MOI (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, the
number of shared DREs between high- and low- MOIs was
42, which was only 6% of the total number of DREs in both
conditions, indicating that the underlying regulatory system
between them was not similar. To confirm the biological
involvement of the DREs, we performed canonical pathway
analysis for the genes contained in the ∆ECv-obtained
DREs, showing that these genes were associated with some
cellular antiviral systems (Fig. 2C). These results supported
that the components of the DREs were biologically relevant
to viral infection.
To gain a greater insight into the profiles of the DREs
from the perspective of network topology, we next generated
networks using a set of all the DREs in the Venn diagram
(Fig. 2B). These DREs connected mutually and, in turn,

We reasoned that if these fragments represented some
biological significance, these features should be reflected as
modularity, as biologically close functions in cellular systems
link together and shape modules (25). Hence, small-sized
fragments were likely to be less informative, and we focused

on the biggest connected component among the various
fragments. The biggest connected component was extracted
and the basal edges were additionally mapped on this
network, which established the SARS-CoV-2-perturbated
network with 130 nodes and 305 edges (Fig. 3). We found
that this network consisted of clear three modules linking

each other. One module (module 1, yellow marked region)
was mainly formed of a set of the DREs in the low MOI
condition, and its constituent elements were many interferon
(IFN)-stimulated genes (ISGs): IFIs, MXs, OASs, TRIMs,
IFTMs, IRFs, and STATs. These highly orchestrated webs
of various ISGs are induced by transductions of both IFN
signaling and subsequent JAK/STAT signaling (26). This
evidence strongly suggested that module 1 represents the
consequences of activation of both these signaling pathways
by the acute antiviral response. Contrary to module 1, the
other two modules (module 2, green marked region; and
module 3, purple marked region) are mainly shaped by a
set of the DREs in the high MOI condition. Module 2 and
module 3 were found to comprise fewer IFN-related genes.
While module 2 appeared to be a GAS5-centralized module,
module 3 was composed of chemokines (CXCL1, CXCL2,
CXCL3, CX3CL1, and CCL20), interleukins (IL6, IL1A,
IL1B, and IL32), and colony-stimulating factors (CSF2
and CSF3), which are implicated in inflammatory-related
cytokine signaling followed by the acute activation of IFN
and JAK/STAT signaling represented in module 1. In
particular, the cluster of module 1 and module 3 probably

response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Namely, the cellular
system perturbated by SARS-CoV-2 gradually switches to
inflammatory signaling (module 3) via IFN and JAK/STAT
signaling (module 1) as the viral load increased. This
was consistent with the clinical observations of COVID-19,
and thus may partially explain the process of cytokine
storm syndromes, which is a severe clinical feature of
COVID-19 (21, 23). We also performed the same analyses
among the four respiratory viruses, and found that module
3 was exclusive for SARS-CoV-2 (Supplementary Fig.
S1). Collectively, we identified the SARS-CoV-2-perturbated
network and its three modules, which reflected distinctive
host cellular functions in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

genes influence a child gene in response to the pairwise
parent’s mRNA expression, and it can therefore reveal local
regulatory changes in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection at
an individual sample level. To characterize the individual
networks, we calculated RCs for 12 samples within four
groups (mock × 3 for SARS-CoV-2-infected (MOI: 0.2),
SARS-CoV-2-infected × 3 (MOI: 0.2), mock × 3 for
SARS-CoV-2-infected (MOI: 2), SARS-CoV-2-infected ×
3 (MOI: 2)) involved in the network generation process
in Fig. 3, and selected representative four samples from
each group. By representing RCs as the sizes of edge
widths, we depicted these four sample-specific individual
networks (Supplementary Animation 1), and found that
the vicinity of the GAS5-centralized module (module 2)
drastically changed at an RC level (Fig. 4). Interestingly,
this module included GAS5, SNHG8, ZFAS1, SNORD52,
SNORD58C, SNORA24, and LOC100506548, which encode non-coding RNA (ncRNA) genes. Given that GAS5
appears to function as a hub gene, these results suggested that
the genes downstream of GAS5 are regulated by different
cellular systems in the mock and SARS-CoV-2 infections
at a local system level. Especially, our results showed that
GAS5, ZFAS1, and SNHG8 were found to be dominant

for SLC9B1 in SARS-CoV-2-infected samples compared
with the mock, suggesting the regulatory system used was
significantly different between them (Fig. 4). GAS5 is a
single-strand long ncRNA and one study demonstrated that
the mRNA expression of GAS5 was elevated in response
to hepatitis C virus infection and that GAS5 impaired virus
replication by the interaction between truncated-GAS5 and
HCV NS3 protein in human cells (27). Combined with
this evidence, our results suggest the possibility that this
ncRNA-related module 2 may play a novel clear role in
SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Conversely, of the four individual networks, the two networks
for mocks exhibited no significant change in RC (Fig. 4
and Supplementary Animation 1). This was consistent
with the prerequisite experimental designs as the mock
samples are supposed to exhibit the same behaviour, which
further supported the validity of our method. Moreover, the
RC-highlighted edges displaying even small or no changes
explained that their local regulatory system, presented as a
set of pairwise parent-child relationships for one child, did
not change between the individual samples. Collectively, our
data have demonstrated that we can capture the local system
differences in network signaling at an individual level.

Identification of specific individual networks for patients with COVID-19. Finally, we aimed to establish

COVID-19 individual networks with a human biopsy dataset
(healthy: two samples; COVID-19 positive: two samples)
on the basis of the estimated basal network model. We
expect that the in vivo biopsy dataset potentially provides
a more clinically relevant perspective compared with the in
vitro experiments. Usually, network estimation is impossible
with such a small number of samples owing to the difficulty
in acquisition of the robust network structure, yet our
approach using the basal network model was capable of
generating a context-specific network, even with a few
samples of a different dataset (Fig. 1). By using the B-spline
regression model of the Bayesian network acquired by the
estimation of the basal network, we first computed the ECv
for the preprocessed biopsy dataset, despite the absence
of some genes compared with the dataset used for the
basal network estimation. To obtain DREs, we calculated
∆ECv between healthy (regarded as control) and COVID-19
samples following the Eq. (2) where S = healthy (|S| =
2) and T = COVID-19 (|T | = 2) (see Methods). The
∆ECvs were distributed over a broad range, and 4242 DREs
were observed at the threshold of 1 for ∆ECv (Fig. 5A).
To extract more reliable DREs induced by COVID-19, we
set the threshold of 2.3 corresponding approximately to
log2 FC where FC=5, which resulted in 638 DREs. These
DREs were mapped as networks and the biggest connected
component (167 DREs) was depicted with inclusion of the
basal edges, generating the COVID-19-perturbated network,
which comprised 127 nodes and 412 edges (Fig. 5B). This
network is supposedly a representation of the distinctive
cellular system in patients with COVID-19. The pathway
analysis of genes contained in this network showed that they
were involved in the immune and inflammatory response
(Fig. 5C), supporting the consistency of our established
network with the biological observations in COVID-19.
To determine the signatures of the acquired DREs in
the COVID-19-perturbated network, we measured the ECv
similarity for a set of the 167 DREs across the other
experimental samples. This result showed that the ECv
profiles in COVID-19 were most similar to the sample of
high SARS-CoV-2 viral load in A549 cells in the vitro
experiments (Supplementary Fig. S2A), further supporting
that the obtained DREs were associated with SARS-CoV-2
infection. We further explored the extent to which the
COVID-19-related 167 DREs overlapped with the Venn
diagram established in Fig. 2B. We observed that a moderate
number of the DREs were shared by the cell models of
SARS-CoV-2 perturbation (Fig. 5D), and then these overlapped edges were mapped onto the COVID-19-perturbated
network (Supplementary Fig. S2B). Unlike the network
observations in Fig. 3, we found that both the ISG-related
webs (module 1) and subsequent cytokine signaling (module
3) involved in inflammatory cascades were coincidently
present in the COVID-19-perturbated network, indicating
that these two modules were continued to be mutually
activated in COVID-19.

To uncover the differences in the local regulatory system,
we next examined the profiles of the COVID-19-perturbated
network at an individual level using the RC method (Fig. 1).
As the two COVID-19 samples were originally derived
from a single patient who tested positive for COVID-19,
we calculated RCs for three individuals (healthy 1, healthy
2, and COVID-19 patient). The depiction of the RC
as the edge sizes eventually led to the establishment of
the COVID-19 patient-specific network, which is likely to
show how the cellular system changed in the patients with
COVID-19 compared with the healthy controls (Fig. 6A).
The panel of three individual networks dramatically exhibited a great magnitude of differences, showing that the
cellular regulatory systems were quite distinctive among
individuals (Supplementary Animation 2). In comparison
with the SARS-CoV-2-perturbated network established by
the well-organized in vitro experiments using cell lines
(Supplementary Animation 1), this broad range of RC
fluctuation for each in vitro sample probably reflects further
differences among individuals. The representative regions
where local regulatory systems are different among individuals were illustrated in Fig. 6B. In the zoom 1 region,
PELI1 is a parent gene for both TNF and RGS16; these two
signals were dominant in the healthy individuals, but not in
the patient with COVID-19. In contrast, the zoom 2 and
3 regions showed that local signals were clearly different,
not only between the healthy patients and the patient with
COVID-19, but also even between two healthy individuals.

Discussion
Here, we have presented the host cellular gene networks
perturbated by SARS-CoV-2 both in vitro and in vivo by
using our proposed framework for gene network analysis.
As the networks we established to be associated with
SARS-CoV-2 were generated through RNA-seq data, these
networks explain how genes are systematically regulated at
the transcriptome level. Although our approach depends on
the initial network estimation with an experimental dataset
and may therefore risk the inclusion of false relationships
or the exclusion of true relationships, we have succeeded
in capturing the biologically explainable immune response
systems in human cells induced by SARS-CoV-2 at the level
of signaling networks.
Sensing viruses cause an immune defense system in host
cells, and this induces acute IFN signaling activation followed by expression of IFNs. These IFNs amplify JAK/STAT
signaling to promote the expression of various ISGs and
accelerate subsequent cytokine signaling (26). As illustrated
in Fig. 3, the mutually interacting module of ISGs (module
1) followed by IFN and JAK/STAT signaling was shown to
be an early response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. During the
process of cells exposed to high SARS-CoV-2 viral loads,
the signaling appears to move to the next stage, represented
by inflammatory signaling, including the involvement of
various cytokines (Fig. 3). The recent reported drug,
dexamethasone, could be effective for severe patients with
COVID-19 by suppressing these orchestrated inflammatory

signaling cascades (28). In this network, IL6 was located
as a hub gene to regulate downstream cascades, including
chemokines and colony-stimulating factors, which are reported to be increased in patients with COVID-19 (21). The
web of chemokines, such as CXCL1, CXCL2, and CXCL3,
may represent how SARS-CoV-2-infected cells present a
signal to induce leukocyte chemotaxis and infiltration. The
localization of ICAM1 in the vicinity of IL6 and chemokines
is supportive of this, as ICAM1 is known to be a scaffold
for the accumulation of leukocytes at inflammatory sites
and its expression is regulated by cytokines, including
IL6 (29, 30). This tendency was also observed in the
network comparison analyses across four respiratory viruses,
including SARS-CoV-2 (Supplementary Fig. S1C). These
data showed that IL6 was not exclusive to SARS-CoV-2, but
a universal factor in response to respiratory viral infection,
except for influenza A virus. Given that several studies have
reported that tocilizumab, an inhibitor of the IL6 receptor,
is a potential drug able to suppress the cytokine storm

observed in many critical patients with COVID-19 (31, 32),
the accumulated evidence strongly suggested that IL6 would
be a central regulator of the inflammatory cascade, even from
a network perspective. In addition, our network showed that
CSF2 is regulated via various factors, including IL6, which
strengthens previous reports suggesting that CSF2 may be
a promising therapeutic target in combination with IL6 (33,
34). Several recent studies have shown that ACE2 plays a key
role in the process of SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV-2
enters into host cells via ACE2 (35), and ACE2 was found to
be an ISG in human airway epithelial cells (36). Considering
that the SARS-CoV-2-perturbated network includes several
ISGs (Fig. 3), it can be reasoned that some clues regarding
ACE2 may be present in this network. In this context, we
found that ACE2 was closely located to this network and
was downstream of TNFRSF9, ATF3, and ARRDC3 via
ACHE (data not shown); these are potential candidates for
further investigation of the relationship between ACE2 and
ISGs. Thus, our networks provide promising information

to elucidate SARS-CoV-2 profiles from a broad biological
perspective.
Our second noteworthy outcome in this study was that
we succeeded in the characterization of sample-specific
individual networks by introducing the new edge-quantitative
technique of RC. In particular, although it is impossible to
estimate a network with a small number of samples, such
as the four biopsy samples used in our case, the basal
network model that was already obtained through the analysis
of the in vitro dataset with both RC and ECv methods
has led to establishment of the COVID-19 patient-specific
individual network. This process represents how we extrapolate between in vitro and in vivo experiments. Different
samples each exhibit a unique regulatory profile, especially
in actual individuals (such as those obtained from biopsy)
rather than well-controlled in vitro samples (Supplementary
Animation 1 and 2). These results probably reflect a
more realistic clinical situation and increase the importance
of making the most of effective utilization of a biopsy
dataset. In the current outbreak of COVID-19, we need to
look into both biological and clinical aspects for exploring
COVID-19 therapy. The individual networks regarding
COVID-19 shows the extent to which individuals possess
their own network, which ultimately links to the necessity
of personalized treatment. Therefore, our efforts are a
potential contribution to the emerging field of personalized
medicine. The biopsy dataset that we used was not sufficient
to allow interpretation of the comprehensive information
through individual networks in patients with COVID-19, as it
contained fewer COVID-19 samples. More clinical samples
from patients with COVID-19 can lead to the determination
of key regulatory systems at a clinical level. We hope that our
panel of network analyses will be of help to the SARS-CoV-2
research field and to establishment further treatments for
COVID-19.

Methods
Global gene network estimation and core network
extraction. In general, methods for gene network analysis

are intended for the extraction of gene-to-gene regulatory
relationships universally underlying given transcriptome
datasets. Unlike commonly existing gene networks, we
recently developed a method to extract sample-specific gene
networks. Our method first estimates a global gene network,
called the basal network, that included all the genes in a
dataset using a Bayesian network with B-spline nonparametric regression (24, 37). Bayesian network estimation
is capable of capturing global cause-and-effect relationships
among gene expression, rather than extracting locally coregulated genes, such as co-expression correlation networks.
This is realized by finding the conditional independencies
among variables. In gene network analysis using a Bayesian
network, gene expression is regarded as an observed sample
from the random variables that correspond to genes or
transcriptomes in a cell.
Let X1 , . . . , Xp be p variables of genes. In a Bayesian
network, we consider the joint density of p variables and
Tanaka et al.

assume that it is decomposed as the product of local
conditional densities, such that
f (X1 , . . . , Xp ; θG ) =

p
Y

f (Xj |Xj1 , . . . , Xjqj ; θj ),

j=1

where j1 , . . . , jqj are indices of qj dependent variables of the
j-th variable. This decomposition can be represented as a
directed acyclic graph (network) and variables Xj1 , . . . , Xjqj
are connected as parents or inputs of the j-th variable in the
network.
The B-spline nonparametric regression version of the
Bayesian network models gene-to-gene expression relationships as mathematical equations using B-spline curves, such
that
(j)
(j)
xj = m1 (xj1 ) + · · · + mqj (xjqj ) + εj ,
(1)
where xj represents an expression value of the j-th gene,
εj is the error term normally distributed with mean 0
P
(j)
and variance σj , and mk (x) = M
m=1 γjkm bjkm (x) is
a regression function using M B-spline basis functions
bjkm (·), and their coefficients γjkm .
The structure search of the Bayesian network corresponds to
finding the decomposition of the joint density. This is implemented by the maximization of the posterior probability,
such that
Z Y
n
p(G|X) ∝ π(G)
f (xi1 , · · · , xip ; θG )π(θG |λ)dθG ,
i=1

where X is an n-by-p input matrix whose element xij
corresponds to an expression value of the i-th sample for the
j-th gene, G represents the network structure, π(G) is the
prior probability of G, θG is the parameter vector of the local
conditional densities, π(θG |λ) is the prior distribution of θG ,
and λ is the hyperparameter vector. The difficulty in gene
network estimation by the Bayesian network is the step of
structure learning for large networks, because this is known
to be an NP-hard problem; namely, an exponential increase
in search space to the number of variables. We have used the
neighbor node sampling and repeat algorithm that realizes
the estimation of the large Bayesian network structure (24).
It repeats the subnetwork estimation many times in parallel
for the sampled variable sets by random walking, and thus it
can estimate the large network within a realistic time.
After the basal network estimation, we then quantified
every single edge with respect to a certain sample in terms
of the system-level usage of the edge with the estimated
mathematical model. Tanaka et al. (14) defined an edge
contribution value (ECv) of edge jk → j as
(j)

(u)

ECv(u) (jk → j) = mk (xjk )
(u)

where xjk represented the expression value of the jk -th
(j)

gene at a certain sample denoted by u, and mk (·) was a
regression function defined in Eq. (1). Note that sample u
did not necessarily have to be a single sample for use in the

network estimation. They proved that ECv can be used for
the quantification of edge jk → j with respect to a given
sample. To extract sample-specific networks, they considered
the differences of ECvs between two different conditions of
samples, similar to extracting differentially expressed genes
by comparing control and perturbated expressions. They
defined ∆ECv as
∆ECv(S,T ) (jk → j) =
1 X
1 X
ECv(s) (jk → j) −
ECv(t) (jk → j) ,
|S|
|T |
s∈S

t∈T

(2)
where S and T are sets of samples observed in the particular
conditions, respectively, in which |S| ≥ 1 and |T | ≥ 1. Note
that in the case of |S| = |T | = 1, this allows consideration
of the differences between just two samples, e.g. control
and perturbated samples. In general, we assume multiple
replicated samples or a set of individual samples for both S
and T . By extracting edges and their connected nodes with
∆ECvs greater or equal to a certain threshold, we can define
the sample- or condition-specific core network from the basal
network. In this study, S and T were sets of infected and
control (mock) replicated samples, respectively. As the target
dataset includes control samples for a particular series of
experiments, we can extract certain core networks from them
by calculating ∆ECv for the series of experiments using their
corresponding control samples. For example, we extracted
a SARS-CoV-2-perturbated core network by calculating
∆ECvs for SARS-CoV-2-infected and their corresponding
mock-triplicate samples. As performed in the previous study,
we generally employed ∆ECv ≥ 1.0 for the threshold of the
core network extraction. This approximately corresponds to
2-fold changes in differentially expressed genes for extracted
genes. Thus, we considered the extracted networks, including
edges and nodes, which showed the significant activation of
regulatory systems by the infection.
Proposed relative contribution of edges for characterizing individual networks. This ECv development allowed

a new solution for gene network analyses. In the previous
study (14), we succeeded in characterizing network profiles
by calculating ECvs for edges in a ∆ECv-extracted core
network with respect to many samples from patients with
cancer. The conventional clustering onto these calculated
ECvs led to the identification of prognosis-related subgroups.
Thus, we demonstrated that the differences and similarities in
edge profiles of the network could be captured as patterns
of ECvs. Despite the high availability of ECvs, it is still
impossible to directly compare ECvs between individual
samples, because ECvs have different sizes depending on the
estimated pairwise edge and the sample. The normalization
of ECvs across samples is inappropriate for our purpose
owing to the mutual dependency of the individual network
on each sample. Thus, it has not been possible to highlight
the differences in regulatory systems at an individual level.

For these reasons, ECvs are not appropriate to the analysis
of individual networks. To overcome the drawbacks, we
have proposed a novel method, relative contribution (RC),
to quantify edges with respect to individual samples using
the estimated gene network model. We hypothesized that
the differences of individual samples in terms of the cellular
system can be observed as the differences in ratios of the
contributions of edges connecting to a certain node in the
network. Edges with different samples need to be described
as differently weighted edges according to ratios of effects
between parents that regulate or are connected to a certain
gene. In addition, the quantification of a network with a
single sample needs to be independent from other samples
and their distributions. To realize this, we define the relative
contribution of an edge with respect to a sample as
RC(u) (jk → j) =

|ECv(u) (jk → j)|
,
max1≤k0 ≤qj |ECv(u) (jk0 → j)|

where u represents a certain sample (0 < RC ≤ 1). That is, an
RC of the edge is a relative strength of the contribution of the
edge to the maximum strength among the parents connecting
to the same child node. The reason why an RC is not divided
by the sum of the ECvs is that the range of RCs does not
shrink depending on the number of parents of the child node.
A drawback of RCs is that, if the ratio of ECvs of the parents
is not changed, the changes of parent values do not affect the
RCs. However, RCs of their downstreams will be affected by
such changes. Therefore, this drawback is not problematic
in terms of the specification of differences in individual
networks. Note that, similar to ECvs, sample u does not
necessarily need to be a single sample used for the network
estimation. As illustrated in Results, we have shown that RCs
can be used to analyze individual networks, even if we have
a single sample, or only a few samples, of gene expression
data, as long as a basal network can be estimated from other
datasets. RC therefore offers a significant enhancement to
our framework for gene network analysis. Our data have
demonstrated that the framework, through an integration of
the three key pieces – Bayesian network estimation, ECv,
and RC – provides a powerful data-driven solution to seek
biological phenomena through cellular systems ranging from
a global level to an individual level. Our proposed framework
is mathematically illustrated in Supplementary Fig. S3.
Dataset. The transcriptome dataset GSE147507 was down-

loaded from NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (7). The
samples were infected with respiratory viruses, including
SARS-CoV-2, and biological replicates were performed. We
first selected samples exclusive for human RNA-seq with
78 samples. Among the samples, four samples of the in
vivo experiment (biopsy) data were pre-eliminated. The
log2 -transformed dataset was filtered to remove genes with a
mean percentile lower than 30%, resulting in 74 samples and
15,258 genes. This preprocessed dataset of the 74 × 15258
matrix was used as input for the basal network estimation.
The biopsy dataset eliminated above prior to global network
estimation consisted of four samples (two healthy samples

and two COVID-19-positive samples). The RPM (reads per
million) normalized biopsy dataset was log2 -transformed and
genes with at least one zero value were removed to obtain
more reliable data. The two technical replicate samples for
COVID-19 were averaged for RC calculation. Following this
preprocessing, the input dataset for RC calculation finally
comprised a 3 × 4516 matrix. The RNA-seq samples used
for ∆ECv calculations in this study were: SARS-CoV-2
in A549 cells (MOI of 0.2/2 for 24 hr, n=3) and the
corresponding mock (n=3); SARS-CoV-2 in normal human
bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells (MOI of 2 for 24 hr, n=3)
and the corresponding mock (n=3); SARS-CoV-2 in Calu-3
cells (MOI of 2 for 24 hr, n=3) and the corresponding mock
(n=3); human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in A549 cells
(MOI of 2 for 24 hr, n=3) and the corresponding mock (n=3);
human parainfluenza virus 3 (HPIV3) in A549 cells (MOI
of 2 for 24 hr, n=3) and the corresponding mock (n=3);
influenza A virus (IAV) in A549 cells (MOI of 5 for 9 hr,
n=2) and the corresponding mock (n=2); COVID-19 (n=2)
and healthy (n=2).

Supplementary Fig. S1. Network comparison analyses across four respiratory viruses. (A) The histograms of ∆ECv for each respiratory virus as indicated: SARS-CoV-2
(MOI: 2), HPIV3, IAV, and RSV. ∆ECvs were calculated following the Eq. (2) where S = virus-infected and T = corresponding mock samples for each virus (see Methods).
The X-axis corresponds to the threshold for each ∆ECv. The Y-axis stands for the number of edges on a log scale. (B) The Venn diagram represents the numbers of
∆ECv-extracted edges for all respiratory viruses with a ∆ECv threshold of 1.0. (C) The respiratory viruses-shared network comprised of 62 nodes and 116 edges (including
53 basal edges). The colored solid edges represent DREs; SARS-CoV-2 ∩ IAV ∩ HPIV3 ∩ RSV (purple), SARS-CoV-2 ∩ RSV ∩ HPIV3 (red), IAV ∩ RSV ∩ HPIV3 (blue).
The top 10 terms of canonical pathway analysis for the genes of ∆ECv-extracted DREs shared by at least three viruses in the Venn diagram (Supplementary Fig. S1B). (D)
SARS-CoV-2 specific network comprising 182 nodes and 295 edges (including 171 basal edges). The solid edges (magenta) represent DREs for SARS-CoV-2 (MOI: 2). The
dot edges represent the basal edges (grey). The size of the node represents the extent of outdegree. The nodes (green) are target genes for existing drugs (Supplementary
Table S1). The top 10 terms of canonical pathway analysis for the genes of ∆ECv-extracted DREs exclusive for SARS-CoV-2 in the Venn diagram (Supplementary Fig. S1B).
