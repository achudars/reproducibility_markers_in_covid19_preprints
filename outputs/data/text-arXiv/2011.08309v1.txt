Abstract
Emerging at the end of 2019, COVID-19 has become a public health threat to people
worldwide. Apart from the deaths who tested positive for COVID-19, many others have
died from causes indirectly related to COVID-19. Therefore, the COVID-19 confirmed deaths
underestimate the influence of the pandemic on the society; instead, the measure of ‘excess
deaths’ is a more objective and comparable way to assess the scale of the epidemic and
formulate lessons. One common practical issue in analyzing the impact of COVID-19 is to
determine the ‘pre-COVID-19’ period and the ‘post-COVID-19’ period. We apply a change
point detection method to identify any change points using the excess deaths in Belgium.

Introduction

Emerging at the end of 2019, COVID-19 has become a public health threat to people worldwide.
According to statistics compiled by Johns Hopkins University (COVID-19 Dashboard 2020),
up until early June, the COVID-19 pandemic has claimed nearly 400,000 lives globally. With
a population of just 11.5 million, Belgium had the highest death to population ratio, with 78
deaths per 100,000 people (Coronavirus Resource Center, Johns Hopkins University 2020) at
that time. This figure includes only deaths directly linked to COVID-19 and is likely inaccurate
due to different reporting practices or people dying of COVID-19 related causes without being
tested. The physical, psychological, and social effects of lockdown and economic changes
stemming from COVID-19 have indirectly caused deaths, which are not counted in official
figures. Therefore, the deaths directly linked to COVID-19 underestimate the impact of the
pandemic on society.
One way to explore the pandemic’s actual mortality effect is to look at the number of ‘excess
deaths’. This measure can be constructed by comparing the observed weekly deaths throughout
2020 to values from the previous non-pandemic period. This provides a more objective and
comparable way to assess the scale of the pandemic and formulate lessons.
Attempts have been made to continuously track and examine comparative excess mortality
data for Europe, the United Kingdom, the United States of America, and other countries. Simple
visualizations and discussions can be found in The Financial Times (2020), The Economist
(2020) and etc. Researchers have recently developed different approaches to understand the
dynamics of the pandemic. In the field of demography, researchers have focused on the impact
of COVID-19 on different demographic groups, such as age, gender, and income level. For
example, Dowd et al. (2020) examine the role of age structure in deaths, showing that countries
with a much older population have a dramatically higher mortality rate than those with a much
younger population. Cairns et al. (2020) analyzed the impact of COVID-19 on future higher-age
mortality. Riley et al. (2020) assessed the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on sexual
and reproductive health in low-and middle-income countries. Banerjee et al. (2020) estimated
the one-year excess mortality associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.
One common practical issue in analyzing the impact of COVID-19 is to classify the ’preCOVID-19’ period and the ’post-COVID-19’ period. Some researchers choose the date when
the first death was reported (see, e.g., Vandoros 2020), while the others choose the date when
the number of fatalities began increasing steeply as the change point (see, e.g., Barbero 2020).
The former choice may underestimate the magnitude of any effect on non-COVID-19 death,
2

while the latter choice is likely to exaggerate any findings. Hence, it is necessary to propose a
statistical method for determining the breakpoint.
As age group (Dowd et al. 2020) highly influences the COVID-19 mortality, a natural
question to ask is whether the phase changes also exhibit age patterns? If this is the case,
practitioners should classify the ’pre-COVID-19’ and post-COVID-19’ period for each age group
independently when analyzing COVID-19 impact differences between age groups. In addition,
the phases change differences among age groups may aid in establishing more targeted policy
and public guidance towards different age groups in different pandemic periods.
To this end, a change point detection method for time series may provide a statistically
reliable result for phase change detection of excess deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic. In
the literature, change point analysis either deals with the mean change (Bai & Perron 2003),
variance change (Hawkins & Zamba 2005), or the distributional change (Matteson & James
2014) within time-ordered observations. The number of change points is usually assumed
to be single or a known number. However, as the COVID-19 pandemic may change the
mean or variance of the underlying data structure, we seek to detect distributional changes.
Using the hierarchical divisive estimation approach proposed by Matteson & James (2014),
any distributional changes within an independent time-ordered sequence can be identified
simultaneously without assuming the exact number of change points.
This paper’s contribution is to provide a statistical change point detection method to identify
the change points in the counts of COVID-19 caused excess death. The rest of the paper is
organized as follows. In Section 2.1, we introduce the dataset and provide a brief analysis of
the excess deaths in Belgium. The change point detection method is provided in Section 2.2,
followed by a discussion of the change point detection results for the excess deaths in Belgium
in Section 3. We examine if the phase changes exhibit age differences — finally, we summarize
our search findings in Section 4.

Methodology
Dataset overview

To examine the excess death counts in Belgium, we extract the data from the Human Mortality
Database (2020). The original data contains the weekly death counts in Belgium from January
1st , 2010 to May 16th , 2020. To obtain a stationary time series, we only use the past five-year
data. In summary, we use the weekly data from week 1 in 2015 to week 20 in 2020, which are
3

279 weeks in total. The data are recorded by gender (male and female) and age group (age 0 14, 15 - 64, 65 - 74, 75 - 84, and above (and including) 85).
Figure 1 presents the weekly total death counts from 2015 to the present plotted against
the week of the year. There is a clear annual seasonal pattern due to temperature and other
weather-related effects (see also Healy 2003). The graph shows the COVID-19 pandemic effect
in 2020, and it also indicates increased mortality rates at the start of 2015 and 2018 and the first
half of March 2018. This increase is probably due to the flu epidemic.

Figure 1 The weekly total death counts in Belgium
To minimize the impact of large random fluctuation, we use the weekly median death counts
in the past five years to capture the pattern of ‘pre-COVID-19’ death counts. The excess death
counts are computed as the difference between the actual weekly death counts and the weekly
median death counts (Roser et al. 2020). Then, to adjust for the subpopulation size, the excess
death rate is computed as the excess death counts divided by the median death counts from
2015 to 2019. Compared with the excess death counts, the rate is more suitable for comparing
the impact across groups. Therefore, in the following analysis, we work with the excess death
rate labeled by gender and age groups from 2015 to the present.
The weekly total excess death rates are shown in Figure 2, with the rates in 2020 highlighted
in red. In early 2020 (before week 11), the weekly excess death rate is negative. We might
not draw any conclusions based on this information as the deaths generally vary much at the
beginning of a year. However, from week 13 (end of March), the weekly excess death rate
increased dramatically, and it continued to increase until week 15. Based on the graphical
4

interpretation, we have gained insight into the critical time points in the COVID-19 pandemic.
In the following sections, we utilize statistical methods to identify the change points that mark
the different phases in the COVID-19 pandemic.

Figure 2 The weekly total excess death rate in Belgium
The bar charts in Figure 3 show a different level of the negative impact of COVID-19
for different subpopulations in Belgium. Both genders show similar excess death patterns.
Surprisingly, the total excess death rate in 2020 for ages between 65 and 74 is negative. However,
when examining excess deaths by the week in Section 3, we notice that the excess deaths for
thosed aged between 65 and 74 after week 13 are positive, which suggests that the elderly
(age above 64) are more susceptible to COVID-19. In particular, those aged above 85 are more
vulnerable to COVID-19 than other age groups. Meanwhile, COVID-19 has little impact on
excess deaths amongst children and teenagers, as they travel and going out less. By contrast,
COVID-19 is a much greater threat to the older people, as they generally suffer from the
physiological changes associated with aging, decreased immune function, and multimorbidity.
Additionally, the gender difference in excess death counts has different patterns among age
groups. For age groups below 85, males generally have a higher excess death counts, while
there are more excess deaths for females than males for those aged over 85. This is because
the female subpopulation aged above 85 is larger than that of males. The median death count
for females above 85 is also higher than males. Therefore, after we control for median death
counts, males have higher death rates than females for all age groups. This phenomenon is
consistent with the findings in many existing empirical studies that male tends to have more
severe infection outcome (e.g., higher mortality rate) in all age groups (see, e.g., Haitao et al.

Change point detection

We consider a hierarchical divisive estimation approach (Szekely & Rizzo 2005) to detect the
single or multiple change points in the excess death counts. We adopt this approach because it
can detect a distribution change without assuming any specific distribution structure. Therefore,
it is more flexible than Bai & Perron (2003) and Hawkins & Zamba (2005), where only the mean
and variance change can be detected.
Let { Zt , t = 1, . . . , T } be an independent sequence of time-ordered observations (either
univariate or multivariate). Given a change point t∗ , the observed data is partitioned into two
clusters At∗ = { Z1 , . . . , Zt∗ } and BT −t∗ = { Zt∗ +1 , . . . , ZT }. Both At∗ and Bt∗ are independent
and identically distributed (i.i.d) samples from the distribution A, B ∈ Rd for d ∈ N, respectively, such that E| A|α , E| B|α < ∞ for some α ∈ (0, 2). We compute the generalized energy
distance between A and B as follows:
∗

The first term on the right-hand side of (1) corresponds to the between-distance measure
of At∗ and BT −t∗ . The second and third terms on the right-hand side of (1) correspond to the
within-distance of At∗ and BT −t∗ , respectively. To incorporate different sample sizes, Szekely &
Rizzo (2005) proposed a Q statistic defined as
∗
∗
b ( At∗ , BT −t∗ ; α) = t ( T − t ) Eb( At∗ , BT −t∗ ; α).
Q
T

b ( At∗ , BT −t∗ ; α). For
A change point location t∗ is determined as the value that maximizes Q
detecting a difference in mean, α is set to 2.
To estimate multiple breakpoints, we iteratively apply the above techniques as follows.
Suppose that k − 1 change points have been estimated at time 0 = bt0 < bt1 < · · · < btk−1 <
b1 , . . . , C
bk ), such
btk = T. These change points can partition the observations into k clusters (C
bi = { Zb
that C
ti−1 +1 , . . . , Zbti+1 }. Given these clusters, we then apply the procedure for finding
a single change point to the observations within each of the k clusters, so that we obtain k
candidate change points. Then we choose the one resulting in the largest Q statistics as the
estimated kth change points. Then, we check if the selected kth change point is significant
using a permuatation hypothesis test. Details of the hypothesis test can be found in Szekely &
Rizzo (2005). The iteration terminates if the kth estimated change point tested is insignificant.
The implementation of this distance-based approach is included in the ecp package (James &
Matteson 2014) in R (R Core Team 2020).

Results and discussion

Since our interest lies in the change point detection caused by COVID-19, we perform the
change point detection on data from the latter half of 2019 until the most recent observation in
2020.
Let {Xt , t = 1, . . . , T } be the observed excess death rate starting from the 27th week of Year

2019, so that T = 46 and Xt = Xt,i , Xt,j , i, j = 1, . . . , 5 . The superscript ‘m’ and ‘f ’ are used
to distinguish the gender ‘male’ and ‘female’, and the subscript t denotes the week index and
i, j denotes the five age groups (age 0 - 14, 15 - 64, 65 - 74, 75 - 84 and above (and including) 85).
We first apply the change point detection to the matrix-valued time series {Xt , t = 1, . . . , T }.
In this way, we obtain identical change points for all age groups and genders. There is no
change point detected in the latter half of 2019. The change points detected in 2020 are in week
13 and week 18 (corresponds to bt∗ = 39 and 44). Then, the excess death rate in 2020 fall into

three clusters (see Figure 4f). Week 12 is the end of the ’pre-COVID-19’ period, and starting
from week 13, the surge of weekly excess rates reveals the outbreak of COVID-19 among the
population. From week 18, the weekly excess rate drops to one-fourth of the amount in the
peak week (week 15). However, it is still too early to tell if the excess death curve is about to be
flat since the collected data at the time of this study are only available up to week 19 of 2020.
As different age groups have different risk exposures to COVID-19, the change points might
also vary across age groups. Therefore, we perform the detection for each age group separately,
and the clusters are partitioned accordingly (see Figure 4a - 4e).
We can see clear distinctions in the excess deaths distributions and the phases change points
among the young population (age below 14), middle-aged population (age between 15 and 64),
and the old population (age above 65). The young population’s excess death rates are small,
with negative numbers from week 5 (when the first COVID-19 case appeared in Belgium). One
possible reason is that children have engaged in fewer outdoor activities and undertaken less
international travel, making them less likely to contract the virus. Moreover, lock-down and
social distancing policies mean they are less likely to be involved in accidents (see also Lee et al.
2020). For people between 15 and 64, there is a steep increase in excess death rate in weeks

8

14 and 15; soon after that, the excess deaths drop to around zero. However, for older people,
the COVID-19 deaths surge started one week earlier and lasted longer than the middle-aged
population. This might be because older people are more vulnerable to COVID-19 due to
their weak immunity and prior/on-going complications/diseases. Moreover, the older the
age group is, the more excess death counts appeared, and the longer the “COIVD-19 outbreak”
period lasted. Additionally, as over 60% of the excess deaths are amongst those over age 85,
the detected change points in the whole population are the same as those detected using the
population above (and including) 85 only.

Conclusion

We detect the COVID-19 pandemic phase in Belgium using a statistical change point detection
technique. According to our analysis, the phase change shows age differentials. A surge in
deaths in the elderly population appeared earlier than for the middle-aged population and also
lasted longer. Policymakers should consider this evidence and adjust their policies and focus
guidance towards specific age groups. For example, lock-down policies may be first relaxed for
younger age groups, while older people should remain extremely cautious.
