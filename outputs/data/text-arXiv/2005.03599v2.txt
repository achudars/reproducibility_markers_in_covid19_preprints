Abstract: To address the massive spike in uncertainties triggered by the coronavirus disease
(COVID-19), there is an ever-increasing number of national governments that are rolling out
contact-tracing Apps to aid the containment of the virus. The first hugely contentious issue facing
the Apps is the deployment framework, i.e. centralised or decentralised. Based on this, the debate
branches out to the corresponding technologies that underpin these architectures, i.e. GPS, QR
codes, and Bluetooth. This work conducts a pioneering review of the above scenarios and
contributes a geolocation mapping of the current deployment. The Apps’ vulnerabilities and the
directions of research are identified, with a special focus on the Bluetooth-inspired decentralised
paradigm.
Keywords: contact tracing app; coronavirus; COVID-19; decentralised; health informatics;
mHealth.

1. Introduction
In the recent few months, contact-tracing Apps have emerged and pushed the boundary of
innovations in response to the outbreak of the coronavirus (COVID-19) [1]. A contact-tracing App [2]
is a mobile platform that assists the identification of people who may have come into contact with an
infected person, and the subsequent collection of further information about these contacts for
containing the virus’ spreading. There is an ongoing debate on the deployment of the Apps
regarding their technology framework, i.e. centralised [3,4] versus decentralised [5,6], and their
corresponding sensor technologies, i.e. the Global Positioning System (GPS) integrated with Quick
Response (QR) codes scanning [7,8] and big data analysis [9,10], versus the wireless Bluetooth
devices [11] enabled by microwave [12,13] and millimetre-wave [14–17] communications.
In the centralised architecture, personal data collected through the App is controlled by
government authority. These Apps mainly follow the PEPP-PT (Pan-European Privacy-Preserving
Proximity Tracing) [18] protocol, but the consensus amongst the technical community is that this
framework is too academic for practical development. For the decentralized approach, the personal
data is enclosed or controlled by individuals only on personal devices. These Apps follow the DP-3T
(Decentralised Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing) [19] data protection solution recently
developed by the European Academics. However, this framework is only partially decentralised, i.e.
there is an anonymous centralised database for only the infected people. Google and Apple in
partnership [20] will launch an exclusive decentralised framework in May which will be more
compatible with the Android and iOS systems. Regarding the technologies and infrastructures that
underpin the two architectures, GPS is based on crowd mapping for tracking the spread of the
COVID-19, while the QR codes scanning approach is combined with physical temperature testing
equipment or thermal imaging cameras to track the healthy or infected individuals’ movement on
public transport. The Bluetooth method detects other devices retained for a certain amount of time
within a certain range of distance, and notifies the devices which have had sufficient contacts with
the infected individual's device, assuming that the infected individuals report their anonymous
infection states to the App. Researchers from Oxford [21] recently modelled and proposed a

2 of 7

threshold on the active user rates (at least 60%) for the App to fully deliver its valuable insights for
the government to contain the virus. There is arguably a growing trend globally and especially in
Europe that the decentralised architecture would be preferable.

2. Survey of the Data Regulations and Technology Protocols
Keeping personal data safe and secure is one of the greatest challenges posed by the rapid
development of today’s health informatics. The up-to-date regulations and frameworks are detailed
in sections below, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) [22,23], as well as the
key competing architectures that have been mentioned in section 1.
2.1. Data Regulations

GDPR [22,23] released on 14 April 2016 as a standard for Apps - provides the strongest
safeguards of trustworthiness (i.e. voluntary approach, data minimisation, time limitation) for
Apps to operate widely and accurately to protect personal data and limit intrusiveness.
EU approach for efficient contact tracing apps to support gradual lifting of confinement
measures [24] released on 15 April 2020 - a common approach for voluntary and
privacy-compliant tracing Apps.
EU guidelines on the use of location data and contact-tracing tools in the context of the
COVID-19 outbreak [25] released on 21 April 2020 - published by European Data Protection
Board (EDPB), providing guidance for the use of location data and contact-tracing tools.

Pan-European Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (PEPP-PT) [26] released on 1 April 2020 –
which was followed by the German and Italian governments, and was involved with the
development of the UK government’s NHSX App (centralised).
Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (DP-PPT)/ (DP-3T) [27] released on 6 April
2020 - no pooled data is collected, which largely mitigates the privacy risk. The none-infected
individuals’ data are decentralised based, and the infected individuals’ information will be
collected anonymously to a central database.
Apple and Google partner on COVID-19 contact tracing technology framework [20] (yet to be
released in May) - privacy-preserving contact tracing, Bluetooth based, decentralised, free of
GPS. Apple and Google tech is currently trading (integrating) with some of the Governments
self-running Apps.
Government-run contact tracing technology [28] framework that not going to deploy Apple &
Google’s framework, e.g. the UK, France, and several US states.

3. Systematic Mapping of the Global Deployment Status for the COVID-19 Contact-tracing Apps
We produce the first geolocation mapping for the global deployment of the COVID-19
contact-tracing apps in Fig. 1, with the format codes in an order of the country name, App name, the
number of users (download times), and the underpinning technologies (GPS, QR codes, Bluetooth).
The color of the country represents the employed framework, i.e. with red denoting the centralised
architecture, while green representing the decentralised (or being migrating into the decentralised
framework, e.g. Austria, Swiss, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Alberta of Canada, and Vietnam).

Figure 1. Systematic mapping study into the global deployment of the contact-tracing Apps for
COVID-19 (format codes order: country name, App/SDK name, download times/user numbers).

Following a software vulnerability-mapping analysis paradigm [24], the flaws of 10
contact-tracing Apps are analysed and summarised below. For instance, one of the key non-technical
but important questions for the UK NHS COVID-19 tracking App is the fault positives (i.e. what if
people without concern for COVID-19 maliciously report a positive using the App) and the fault
negatives (i.e. what if infected people do not report their cases in the App).
(1) The Health Code on Alipay and WeChat (QR code and big data based, centralised) used in
China has achieved a 63% of the population coverage and 100% on travelers. However, it is
introducing a significant cost for the temperature testing equipment. Many staff are
involved in the checking house by house and helping people without using the digital App.
(2) The StayHomeSafe used by Hongkong, CN (Bluetooth, GPS and WiFi based, decentralised)
is applied to only self-quarantined people staying at home, and hence not a rigorous
contact-tracing App. It is susceptible to the risk if people take off the wristband and phone
together and go out.
(3) The Stopp Corona (Bluetooth based, decentralised) used by the Austria Red cross (initiating
in Netherlands) is on an ID rolling basis (i.e. public key and private key are rolling) with
users covering 4.5% of the population. The Bluetooth’s signal-distance relationship and the
associated risk level definition are calling for a more unified technical framework to be
addressed.
(4) The NHS CV19 App (Bluetooth based) to be deployed by the UK NHS is struggling to
address false positives and negatives, especially for the situation if people who have
symptom but do not report in the App. There is a rising concern about the App’s
downloading rates among the whole country, as evidenced in the first launch in the Isle of
Wight, with a limited coverage up to 24% of the residents.
(5) The Healthy Together (GPS based, centralised) used by the State of Utah (US), and the
Care19 (GPS based, centralised) employed by the North and South Dakota (US) are both
vulnerable to flaws in the centralised data pool protection and the sensitive GPS location
data issues. The less than 2% of the population coverage also struggles to meet the
sensitivity target.

(6) The TraceTogether (Bluetooth based, centralised) proposed by the Singapore Government
exhibits limitations in the life or death situations. 16.7% of the population are currently
active on the App.
(7) The COVIDsafe (Bluetooth based, centralised) employed by the Australian Department of
Health from this May is also susceptible to vulnerabilities in the centralised data pool
protection. Currently only 10% of population coverage is reported.
(8) The Hamagen (the Shield) employed by the Israel Health Ministry (Bluetooth based,
centralised) reports a user coverage rate of 16.8% and vulnerable to the flaws in the
centralised data pool protection.
(9) The BlueZone (Bluetooth based, decentralised) employed by Vietnam provides limited
analytics insights for the government, with a user coverage rate less than 0.1%.
(10) The Corona Data Donation (GPS based, centralised) used by the German public health
authority is susceptible to the sensitive personal health and location data security problems.

4. Challenges and Research Directions for Bluetooth based Contact Tracking Technologies
As observed from Fig.1 and the flaws analysis, Bluetooth (either in centralised or decentralised
framework) has accounted for 57% of all the tracking technologies, as compared with the GPS (43%),
which merits a further analysis into both the technical and geopolitical characteristics.
Firstly, there is a trade-off between the data privacy and the insights. Arguably, the
decentralised and no GPS solution provides the highest level of data protection for individuals as no
personal data is collected unless the individual is infected. Without the GPS tracking, Apps cannot
collect and trace the movement of the population geographically. With a decentralised framework,
however, any data collected from individuals cannot be driven into a centralised database for future
analysis, i.e. less information will be provided to the government for controlling the self-quarantine
and the movement of the disease among the population.
Secondly, existing decentralised tracing Apps such as the Austria’s Stopp Corona are issuing a
static unique digital ID to each user with rolling public and private keys (keeping the message
encrypted and increasing the data protection standard). If the digital ID is unique and static, it runs
the risk that certain digital ID could be hacked and paired with a mobile device, thus compromising
the individual privacy. Thereby, a rolling base digital ID to mitigate this vulnerability would be a
better practice. In the practical situation, this would be relatively easy to tailor and optimise
compared with other related challenges.
Furthermore, different mobile devices exhibit a variety of Bluetooth signal intensity at the ISM
band, i.e. the capability of each mobile device to determine the social distance precisely can vary.
Accordingly, it is of research and development interest regarding how this can be manipulated
(converted) in a unified framework that regulates different generations of devices to communicate
and share data with each other. Other factors, such as the multipath interference and spatial
blockage between devices are also urgent yet promising research areas that could tip the balance on
the functional performance and fault tolerance of the Bluetooth based contact tracking. Coupled
with the technical hurdles, the risk-level evaluating standard based on the distance and time
contained should be updated accordingly.

5. Conclusion
This work reviews the states-of-the-art contact-tracing Apps for the COVID-19. A systematic
mapping of the global deployment architectures and technologies is proposed, with a detailed
analysis of the flaws for each scenario presented. Specifically, the key challenges facing the Bluetooth
based solutions are identified to assist the health informatics decision-making concerning the UK’s
current status in COVID-19 (see Appendix A for an exponential fitting performed to model the
cumulative cases up to date).
