Abstract. We introduce a comprehensive screening platform for the
COVID-19 (a.k.a., SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia. The proposed AI-based
system works on chest x-ray (CXR) images to predict whether a patient
is infected with the COVID-19 disease. Although the recent international
joint effort on making the availability of all sorts of open data, the public
collection of CXR images is still relatively small for reliably training
a deep neural network (DNN) to carry out COVID-19 prediction. To
better address such inefficiency, we design a cascaded learning strategy
to improve both the sensitivity and the specificity of the resulting DNN
classification model. Our approach leverages a large CXR image dataset
of non-COVID-19 pneumonia to generalize the original well-trained classification model via a cascaded learning scheme. The resulting screening
system is shown to achieve good classification performance on the expanded dataset, including those newly added COVID-19 CXR images.
More specifically, the proposed DNN learning proceeds in three stages. In
the first stage, the model is trained to predict the mask of lung regions
to emphasize the targeted areas of concern and alleviate the effect of
irrelevant annotations on a CXR image. Incremental learning is then
deployed in the subsequent stage so that the pre-trained DNN can learn to
classify the additional COVID-19 images, while retaining its classification
performance on the original data. The design is to first filter out images
of the normal category in the second stage and then, in the final stage,
conduct fine-grained classification to divide the pneumonia candidates
into two specific types, namely, COVID-19 and non-COVID-19. We report promising results on both the open and clinical COVID-19 datasets.

Introduction

The outbreak of COVID-19 disease (a.k.a., SARS-CoV-2) has been affecting the
world in an unprecedented way. While intensively global research efforts are being
made to seek its effective treatments or vaccines, at the core of the most urgent
concern is to prevent the pandemic from further spreading into an uncontrollable
and chaotic status. In this work, we are endeavoring to establish an open AI-based
platform to seamlessly carry out preliminary large-scale screening of potential
COVID-19 patients, and provide early detection at the onset of the infection
from the viewpoint of radiology imaging.
Countries such as the United States and Japan are now actively practicing
social distancing and seem to receive encouraging outcomes to curb further
spread of COVID-19. Still, an affordable and reliable procedure to effectively
screen the potentially infected patients is much needed. The reverse-transcription
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing is the preliminary evaluation to
assess whether a subject is at risk of COVID-19. However, the less satisfactory
sensitivity of RT-PCR has its limitation on reducing the false-negative rate [1]
and may overlook a good number of COVID-19 patients, especially in their early
stage of infection. It is essential to find a complementary testing to boost the
screening confidence and chest radiology, especially chest x-ray (CXR), with
the advantages of affordability, efficiency and reliability, is promising in this
regard. As will be demonstrated in the experiments, the proposed AI-based CXR
screening system of COVID-19 could effectively detect the infection with high
sensitivity, even several days prior to the confirmed RT-PCR results.
Compared with chest computer tomography (CT), chest x-ray imaging is more
suitable for being incorporating into a large-scale AI-based screening platform for
COVID-19. The supporting evidence is threefold. First, performing CT scanning
for comprehensive screening is not practical to contain a pandemic outbreak in
that even the well-established healthcare system of a developed country simply
does not have such a capacity to do so. Second, cleaning the CT scanning
equipment takes considerably longer time than the case of using chest x-ray. The
deep cleaning is necessary to prevent subsequent patients from being infected of
COVID-19. Third, chest x-rays are already widely adopted as a de facto screening
procedure, while CT scanning equipment is not equally popular and is mostly
available in primary healthcare institutes. Their distinction in public use also
reflects in the availability of large-scale open datasets of chest x-ray images over
CT. The ease of collecting image data is crucial in training a reliable AI-based
screening system, especially under the current circumstance.
The proposed chest x-ray screening platform leverages the pneumonia classification system developed by Taiwan AI Labs to detect COVID-19. To extend the

model, we collaborate with several medical research centers in Taiwan to collect
chest x-ray images from COVID-19 patients at various stages, and re-train the
pneumonia classification system using a three-stage cascaded learning strategy.
Specifically, in the first stage, the AI model is trained to predict from a given CXR
image the regions of interest, i.e., the mask of lung regions. In the second stage,
features from the predicted regions are extracted to decide whether the image is
a positive case of pneumonia. In the final and the third stage, the platform would
further make decision on whether the underlying case is COVID-19 or another
type of pneumonia. The resulting screening system also yields the stage-wise
predicted heatmaps and thus provides explainable image clues leading to the
classifications. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed platform for
COVID-19 screening, we report the inference results from both the open datasets
and those from the collected clinical cases.

Methodology

We denote the dataset for learning the classification network as D = {(xi , yi )}N
i=1 ,
where xi is a chest x-ray image and yi is the pneumonia class label. In our
implementation, we have yi = 0 to reflect that xi is a CXR image of Normal case
and yi ∈ {1, 2} for the COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 Pneumonia, respectively.
The training set can be further decomposed as D = Do ∪ Dc and |Do |  |Dc |
to indicate that Do is the original (large) collection for conventional pneumonia
classification and Dc includes all the COVID-19 CXR images. The overall network
architecture of the proposed three-stage cascaded learning is illustrated in Fig. 1.
We detail the design details as follows.
Lung segmentation. The convenience of working with an open dataset often
comes with a price—the image quality could vary among samples in the collection
and noisy or irrelevant annotations may be included in some images. Figures 2(A)
and 2(B) illustrate examples of such issues regarding the image or annotation
quality from an open dataset of medical images.

The alphabet at the upper-right corner, date stamp, and arrow marks in CXR
images may confuse an AI-based system in both training and inference. (C) Stage
1 of the proposed DNN architecture functions as a preprocessing step to filter
out non-informative areas and enable the system to focus on the lung regions.

To prevent an AI-based system from learning inconsistent information or
noisy annotations, we design the pneumonia classification system to focus on the
essential regions of interest, which in our case is the lung areas. We consider a UNet model [2] to first predict a mask of the lung regions in a CXR image, and use
the resulting mask to filter out image areas that could distract the AI system from
learning the crucial pneumonia-relevant features for the underlying classification
problem. Simply put, the task of the first stage, as shown in Fig. 2(C), can be
thought of as a preprocessing step to segment the mask of the lung regions in
each given CXR image.
Pneumonia classification. Having excluded non-informative regions from
each CXR image xi , the task of the succeeding second stage of the proposed
cascaded learning is to carry out binary classifications: Normal versus Pneumonia.
That is, the DenseNet-121 [3] pneumonia classifier is trained to predict xi as
negative if yi = 0, and otherwise positive if yi ∈ {1, 2}. Under this design setting,
all CXR images of pneumonia are expected to be classified as positive no matter
what their type is. After all, the goal of this stage is to filter out non-pneumonia
samples from further considerations.
It is constructive to explain the pneumonia classification outcome of a CXR
image xi by using the CAM [4] interpretation technique. As shown in Fig. 1,
performing global average pooling (GAP) yields a 1024-D feature vector fi2 ,
which can be reshaped into a 32 × 32 tensor h2i and then upsampled to Hi2 of
the original input resolution, 512 × 512. We express the CAM modeling at stage

A Cascaded Learning Strategy for Robust COVID-19 Screening

2 as follows.
reshape

upsample

fi2 ∈ R1024 7−−−−−→ h2i ∈ R32×32 7−−−−−−→ Hi2 ∈ R512×512 .

(1)

The heatmap Hi2 derived in (1) can be interpreted as the importance distribution over the lung regions leading to the pneumonia classification outcome
of xi . Intuitively, the AI-based readout of a CAM heatmap can be used to aide
physicians to identify anomalous spots in the input CXR image xi .
Recall that the training dataset D comprises Do and Dc . The latter includes
the COVID-19 images and is expected to expand constantly when new CXR
samples are provided by our collaborative medical centers. The frequent changes
in the available training data may require re-training the AI model to improve
classification performance on COVID-19 images, while it also may degrade the
overall pneumonia classification in stage 2. To overcome this dilemma, we deploy
incremental learning to ensure a robust model learning in stage 2. We first adopt
a pneumonia classification model by Taiwan AI Labs, which is pre-trained on Do ,
and then perform incremental learning on Dc by optimizing the model parameters
θ with respect to the following loss function:
!
X
X
1
LD (θ) =
`CE (xi , yi ) + λ
`KL (xi )
(2)
|D|
xi ∈D

xi ∈Do

where `CE is the cross-entropy loss, `KL is the knowledge distillation loss for
learning the prediction output of the pre-trained model and λ ≥ 0 is a parameter
to weigh the effect of knowledge distillation. When λ is set to 0, the incremental
learning is simply reduced to re-training the model with the updated data D.
COVID-19 screening. At the stage 3 of the cascaded learning, the task is
to distinguish the specific type of pneumonia: COVID (y = 1) and non-COVID
(y = 2). Notice that the dataset Do solely comprises non-COVID CXR images,
which could correspond to normal cases and viral or bacterial pneumonia. We
can write the input to the stage 3 classification as
x̃i = xi

where symbolizes pixel-wise product. In Fig. 1, an example of x̃i is illustrated
as a mask of informative regions relevant to predicting an input CXR image xi
as a COVID-19 or non-COVID-19 pneumonia case at the stage 3.
Analogous to the derivation of Hi2 in (1), we can explore the heatmap responses
to gain insights into how the classification system distinguishes COVID-19 from
other types of pneumonia. We consider GradCAM [5] to generate the heatmap
Hi3 in that the resulting GradCAM responses tend to be concentrated rather
than diffusive. The heatmap Hi3 yields interpretable image cues relevant to how
likely the AI system predicts the pneumonia case of xi as COVID-19. Inspired by
[5], we also generate Guided-GradCAM (Guided Activation) as detailed responses
to further focus on patterns to distinguish COVID-19 pneumonia.

Experiments

In collaborations with NTUH, TMUH and NHIA, we evaluate our method on
both open and clinical collections of CXR images. Details about the datasets are
listed in Table 1 and Table 2. We learn the model of each stage separately, i.e., all
parameters other than those of the current training stage are kept unchanged.
Lung segmentation masking. The preprocessing stage 1, lung segmentation,
is trained on Tuberculosis Chest X-ray Image Data Sets that consist of two parts,
Montgomery County X-ray Set and Shenzhen Hospital X-ray Set. The total
number of samples contains 406 normal case images and 394 tuberculosis case
images. We randomly sample 80% as our training/validation sets and 20% as our
test set. Our stage 1 model achieves 0.88 dice similarity coefficient (DSC) on the
test set. Fig. 3 shows some segmentation outcomes from our stage 1 model. We
further investigate the effect of stage 1 considering the whole screening pipeline.
Table 3 compares the pneumonia classification (stage 2) results between models
with lung segmentation masking and models without lung segmentation masking.

COVID-19 chest x-ray screening using open datasets. We first train the
stage 2 model to carry out pneumonia classification on the open datasets, summarized in Table 1. We separate the data into three groups: Noraml (N), Pneumonia
(P, non-COVID-19), and COVID-19 (C). Normal and non-COVID-19 pneumonia
CXR images are collected from Padchest [7] and RSNA [8], while COVID-19
samples are selected from [6]. For the data from Padchest and RSNA, we randomly divide it into training/validation/testing in the ratio of 80%/10%/10%. As
to the data of COVID-19, we split it into training/validation/testing in the ratio
of 50%/25%/25%, due to its small sample size. During stage 2, binary labels
are considered, where non-COVID-19 Pneumonia (P) and COVID-19 (C) samples
are labeled as 1 (positive) and Normal samples are labeled as 0 (negative). For
each batch of training, we evenly sample each group to account for imbalanced
distributions among Normal, non-COVID-19 Pneumonia, and COVID-19 samples.
The masked images by stage 1 model (lung segmentation, as in Fig. 3) are used
as the input of stage 2 model for both training and inference. After achieving
results of pneumonia classification of stage 2 as in Table 4, we then train the
stage 3 model to distinguish COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 pneumonia, using
only non-COVID-19 Pneumonia (P) and COVID-19 (C) training samples. All
parameters but those of stage 3 are fixed during training. In this stage, marked

as “3: COVID-19” in Table 4, COVID-19 (C) samples are labeled as 1 (positive)
while non-COVID-19 Pneumonia (P) samples are labeled as 0 (negative). Table 4
shows the results of our method on both open and clinical datasets, where only
open datasets are utilized during the training phase.
Fine-tune stage 2 and 3 on clinical datasets (NTUH and TMUH).
From Table 4, we observe the performance gaps in both validation and testing
between clinical data and open data. (We will further elaborate this discovery in
the next section.) To further improve the AI-based classification performance and
achieve clinical applicability, we collaborate with NTUH, TMUH, and NHIA to
collect more clinical COVID-19 CXR samples, as summarized in Table 2. Starting
from a pre-trained model using only open datasets, we fine-tune our model using
clinical data. Instead of using only clinical data, we combine open datasets and
clinical datasets to prevent from overfitting during our fine-tuning phase, and
consider the incremental learning strategy as in (2). As in the experiments on
open datasets, we fine-tune our pneumonia classification (stage 2) and COVID-19
screening (stage 3) sequentially. Based on the final results shown in Table 5,
our method is able to recognize Normal, Pneumonia (both non-COVID-19 and
COVID-19), non-COVID-19, and COVID-19 cases respectively with high AUC,
sensitivity, and specificity. For qualitative result, those cases sampled from the
testing set of open dataset in Fig. 6 and the clinical dataset in Fig. 5 demonstrate
reasonable model activation in different stages.

Fine-tune stage 3 on NHIA dataset. To evaluate the clinical applicability
of our method, we fine-tune our stage 3 model on a relatively larger dataset
(NHIA), which includes 306 COVID-19 (C) samples from 306 confirmed cases
in Taiwan and 3,069 non-COVID-19 Pneumonia (P) samples. Of those 3,069
Pneumonia (P) samples, 50% of them are diagnosed with bacterial pneumonia
and the other half are diagnosed with viral pneumonia. Table 6 includes the
validation and testing results on NHIA dataset, suggesting the potential of using
our method for distinguishing COVID-19 from both common bacterial and viral
pneumonia.
Early COVID-19 detection with our screening system Further, to gain
insights into the advantages of using the proposed CXR screening platform, we
investigate its efficiency of early prediction over RT-PCR so that the needed
medical treatment can be performed as early as possible. To this end, we describe
the overall performance of our screening platform and the case study on the
NHIA dataset, particularly the validation (n=54) and the test (n=55) set. Out of
these 109 samples detected by RT-PCR, there are 47 samples with visible signs
of pneumonia, which are double confirmed by our medical specialist. Based on
this subset, our model correctly detects 42 samples; that is, the sensitivity of our
model achieves 89.36%.
Out of these 109 samples, taken in a period of three months (January 2020 to
March 2020), the advantage of using our system for early detection of COVID-19
versus using RT-PCR can be observed from in the comparative study. Fig. 4
illustrates the details of each case.
– Case 24 was detected by our system, 17 days prior to RT-PCR confirmed
(on January 31, 2020).
– Case 268 was detected by our system, 6 days prior to RT-PCR confirmed
(on March 20, 2020).
– There were 27 out of 109 cases detected at least 2 days earlier than the
RT-PCR confirmed dates (Case 24, 226, 227, 235, 256, 268, 271, 272, 273,
279, 284, 287, 289, 290, 292, 308, 310, 313, 316, 317, 335, 349, 353, 355, 361,
363, and 379). Among these cases, Case 24, 268, 279, and 292 were detected
5 days earlier.
Comparison with relevant studies. To evaluate the efficacy of our multistage method, we further conduct an experiment on the training/testing data
split setting of COVID-Net [9]. The CXR samples are taken entirely from open
datasets [6,8], which consist of 13,594 CXR images (7966/5476/152 in N/P/C) in
the training set and 231 CXR images (100/100/31 in N/P/C) in the testing set.

As shown in Table 7, our method is more sensitive (and specific at inverse perspective of binary classification) than COVID-Net in both Normal and COVID-19
predictions. Note that in the stage 2 of our method, the binary classification is
to predict Normal versus both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 pneumonia.

Conclusion

Since the outbreak of COVID-19, intensive efforts have being made by healthcare experts in hospitals to reach diagnosis result for each patient even with
supplemental symptoms. Suggested by medical experts, because of the efficiency
and availability of CXR, we propose an AI-based screening system to recognize
COVID-19 pneumonia in CXR images. Regarding coarse to fine manners, our
cascaded method consists of lung segmentation, pneumonia recognition, and
COVID-19 recognition as hierarchical screening. The proposed approach outperforms a previous method on open dataset of COVID-19 cases and is able to reach
clinical-grade performance on NTUH and TMUH clinical data. Moreover, our
method has been integrated into the internal system of Taiwan NHIA and CDC,
achieving over 80% sensitivity and specificity on NHIA clinical test cases. Key
future research challenges include the sensitivity improvement on cases with mild
symptoms, medical studies of COVID-19 cases with recognized lesion patterns,
and the refinement of lung segmentation to uncover subtle and relevant regions.
