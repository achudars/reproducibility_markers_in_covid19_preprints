Abstract
In this report we fit a semi-mechanistic Bayesian hierarchical model
to describe the Mexican COVID-19 epidemic. We obtain two epidemiological measures: the number of infections and the reproduction number.
Estimations are based on death data. Hence, we expect our estimates
to be more accurate than the attack rates estimated from the reported
number of cases.

Introduction

As of today, there are almost 14 million of confirmed cases of coronavirus disease
2019 (COVID-19) in the world, and a total of 591,228 reported deaths (Worldometer). Mexico has 317,635 COVID-19 confirmed cases with 36,906 deaths.
The numbers are growing rapidly in the country, along with plans for a gradual
reopening which started in June. In addition to this, the testing rate in Mexico
is the lowest among the OECD countries, implying a likely large sub-reporting
of cases. The Ministry of Health of Mexico has declared that the data available
are inconsistent and, therefore, difficult to use to define the reopening of activities. Given this, a better understanding of the current epidemiological situation
at the state level, and the impact of government-imposed mitigation measures
is necessary.
Here, we use the semi-mechanistic Bayesian hierarchical model of COVID-19
epidemiological dynamics found in Flaxman et al. (2020) to assess the effect of
different control interventions in Mexico. We estimate the number of infections
and the time-varying reproduction number (the expected number of secondary
cases caused by each infected individual) as a function of human mobility. Figure

1 shows the cases and deaths reported in Mexico. The distribution of deaths
among states is highly heterogeneous, with Mexico City and State of Mexico
accounting for almost 40% of the deaths reported to date.
Mexico’s government determined three phases of contingency for the COVID19 pandemic. The first two cases were confirmed on February 27, from travellers
returning from Italy. Later, on March 17, the suspension of school activities
began nationally. A week later, on March 23, The Comité Nacional para la
Seguridad en Salud announced the start of the second phase of the epidemic.
Almost a month later, on April 21, phase three was declared. Distancing measures included suspension of all non essential activities of public, private and
social sectors. The measures were initially planned to last until April 30, but
were later extended depending on the local situation of every municipality of
the country.
In June, the government announced a monitoring system to regulate the use
of public space in accordance with the risk of COVID-19 contagion, with the
aim of moving towards a new normality. They defined the traffic light of state
epidemiological risk. This traffic light is made up of four colors: red, orange,
yellow and green. Red is the color with the highest epidemiological risk, where
only essential economic activities are allowed. The traffic light moves from color
to color until reaching green, when all activities are allowed. In the last update,
17 entities were in orange, with high risk, and 15 in red, with maximum risk.
It remains unclear the extent to which this traffic light has been effective. This
week, the government did not present an epidemiological traffic light because
state data is not consistent and the reopening has caused outbreaks. Given
this, a better understanding of the current situation would be highly beneficial
to guide policy decisions.
The outline of the paper is as follows. In Section 2 we explain briefly the
model and some important modelling assumptions. In Section 3 we describe our
data sources. In Section 4 we show the application of the model results. Finally,
in Section 5 we give some concluding remarks and future research directions.

Model and Assumptions

The main idea of Flaxman et al. (2020) is to model the expected number of
deaths in a given country on a given day as a function of the number of infections
occurring in previous days, linking the deaths to the infected cases by using two
quantities. The first is the infection fatality ratio (IFR), which is the probability
of death given infection. The second is the distribution of times from infection
to death. The number of deaths every day is the sum of the past infections
weighted by their probability of death, where the probability of death depends
on the number of days since infection and the state IFR.
For the state-level IFR, we made adjustments accounting for the substantial
heterogeneity we expect to observe in health outcomes across states, due to
variation in healthcare quality and capacity (as in Mellan et al., 2020). We
consider the IFR of Mexico City as the IFR estimated from the Chinese epidemic

(see Verity et al., 2020), and the IFR of Chiapas and Oaxaca, which are the most
marginalized states in Mexico, more similar to those that would be expected in
a Lower Middle Income Country (see Walker et al., 2020). Then, we weight
according to age groups. Finally, we interpolated the rest of the states using
five levels of the State Marginalization Index. The marginalization index is an
official standard indicator that allows states to be differentiated according to the
deprivations suffered by the population, such as education, housing, monetary
income, or access to health services. We also allow the IFR for every state to
have additional noise, multiplying it by a N (1, 0.1) distribution.
The distribution of times from infection to death is the sum of two independent random times: the incubation period and the time between onset of
symptoms and death. As in Flaxman et al. (2020), we assume the infection-toonset distribution is a Gamma(5.1, 0.86), and the onset-to-death distribution is
a Gamma(18.8, 0.45).
Now, in Mexico, there are two evident and significant problems that must be
considered with death data. One of them is the death-delayed reporting and the
other is the under-reporting. The death-delayed reporting refers to COVID-19
deaths that will take time to report (see Castañeda and Garrido). Death records
must be validated by two information systems, which obtain information from
medical units and health jurisdictions. Many of the COVID-19 deaths that were
tested are awaiting the proper certification and classification. The assessment
and confirmation processes take days. That is why the official figures of deaths
from COVID-19, published by the Ministry of Health, have an important lag.
Figure 2 illustrates the cumulative proportion of deaths reported as the delay
increases, with different colours corresponding to different dates of death. Very
few deaths (around 10%) are reported within one day, and the vast majority of
deaths (around 90%) are reported after a month. To account for this, we are
adjusting the deaths reported in the following way. We assume the delay has
the same distribution in all the country, but this can be corrected when more
data becomes available. Let pt be the proportion of cases reported on day t,
then
(p1 , ..., pk ) ∼ Dir(αη1 , ..., αηk ),
where the parameters η1 , ..., ηk are the empirical proportion of cases reported,
and α ∼ Gamma(100, 1). Notice that, since η1 + ... + ηk = 1, then E[pt ] = ηt
and V ar(pt ) = ηt (1 − ηt )(α + 1)−1 . Afterwards, we are multiplying the case
numbers of each day by the estimated proportion of cases reported. We do not
report the last two days, since underreporting in those two days is very high.
Also, to avoid biasing the model, we only include observed deaths from the day
after a state has accumulated 10 deaths.
The under-reporting refers to COVID-19 deaths that will not be reported
(or it will take more than a year). Estimating the extent of the under-reporting
remains very difficult, especially in areas outside of Mexico City where less studies have been conducted. Estimates of excess deaths can provide information
about the burden of mortality potentially related to the COVID-19 pandemic,

5

including deaths that are directly or indirectly attributed to COVID-19. However, in Mexico, there are no official published data on deaths during 2020. The
publication of death statistics is annual and the last record is from 2018.
In Mexico City, there are several death certificates stating that the confirmed
or probable cause of death was COVID-19, three times higher than the COVID19 deaths reported by the government (see Adam et al.). Another study of the
death certificates shows that the excess mortality derived from the COVID-19
health crisis in Mexico City is four times greater than that reported (Romero
and Despeghel). This excess includes both people who died from COVID-19 and
also those who died from other causes derived from the health crisis. According
to the Registro Nacional de Población (Renapo), the number of deaths from
COVID-19 in the country doubles what is reported every day (Navarro and
López). However, the government rejects that these death figures are official.
We adopted the extension of Mellan et al. (2020) to reflect the uncertainty
about under-reported deaths. Meaning that we address the effect of underreporting in the data by setting a ψm ∼ Beta(θ, ρ) prior distribution to death
under-reporting in each state m, where both of the hyperparameters of the beta
density are fixed in 80, in order to get a mode of 50% (meaning that, on average,
half of the COVID-19 deaths are being reported). Figure 3 shows the plot of
this prior distribution.
With all of this considerations, if we let Dt,m be the daily deaths attributed
to COVID-19 at day t and state m, we model Dt,m using a positive real-valued
function dt,m = E[ψm pt Dt,m ] that represents the expected number of deaths,
taking into account the designated state-under-reported rate ψm and the deathdelayed reporting adjustment pt .
The rest of the mathematical model follows the original manuscript of Flaxman et al. (2020). Daily deaths are assumed to follow a negative binomial
d
distribution with mean dt,m and variance dt,m + t,m
φ , where φ follows a posi+
tive half normal distribution, φ ∼ N (0, 5), and dt,m is given by the following
discrete sum:
t−1
X
dt,m = IFRm
cτ,m πt−τ .
τ =0

IFRm is the IFR of the state m, cτ,m is the number of new infections on day τ
in state m, and π is the discretized distribution of times from infection to death.
To model the number of infections over time, we need to specify a serial
interval distribution g with density g(τ ) (the time between when a person gets
infected and when they subsequently infect another other people), which we set
as in Flaxman et al. (2020), g ∼ Gamma(6.5, 0.62). With this, the number of
infections ct,m on a given day t, and a state m, is then given by:
ct,m = St,m Rt,m

t−1

where St,m = 1 − Nm
i=1 ci,m is a population adjustment to account for susceptible individuals, gm is the discretized serial interval distribution, and Rt,m

is the state-specific time-varying reproduction number which was parametrized
as a function of Google mobility data as explained below.
Denote by Xk,t,m to the k-th Google mobility indicator at time t for state
m, smoothed by a seven day moving average (meaning that each point is the
mean of the day and the previous 6 days). To allow flexibility, we define dummy
variables after June, were relaxations started. Denote this variables by Zk,t,m ,
then Zk,t,m = 1 if the day t is after June 1 or Zk,t,m = 0 otherwise, for k = 1, ...4
and for any state m. The state-specific time-varying reproduction number Rt,m
is modelled by:

Rt,m = R0,m 2λ
−
[(αk + βk,m )Xk,t,m + γk,m Zk,t,m ] ,
k=1

The basic reproduction number, R0,m , has a normal prior for every state
m, R0,m ∼ N (3.28, k), where k ∼ N + (0, 0.5). This premise is tested in Mellan
et al. (2020) through a sensitivity analysis. The conclusion is that, for this
type of model, the results vary slightly depending on it. However, our major
concern must be two highly influential assumptions, each state IFR and the
under-reporting distribution.

Data

As input of deaths and reported cases, our model uses Open data from the Dirección General de Epidemiología, and the Historical bases on cases associated with
COVID-19 nationwide. For population counts we are using data provided by
Víctor M. García as the Consejo Nacional de Población population projections
for 2020 are not disaggregated for the age groups over 65 years old. Regarding
intervention data, the values taken into account are the dates in which interventions were effectively applied, even though they were encouraged at earlier
dates.

Results

The attack rate (AR) is the proportion of individuals that has been infected
to date. The country’s AR is estimated in 18% (95% Confidence Interval (CI):
16%-19%) on July 7. Of this infections, 7,235,600 (95% CI: 6,281,900-8,062,000)
have occurred in the previous 14 days (which is the official definition of active
cases in Mexico).
Table 1 shows the estimated IFR, state population, reported deaths and
deaths per million population, estimated number of infections in thousands,
estimated number of infections in the previous 14 days in thousands, and estimated AR for all the states.

Our computed IFRs for each of the states range from 0.4% to 1.1%, reflecting substantial differences between states in their demographic structure and
healthcare provision. The percentage of people that have been infected with
SARS-CoV-2 ranges from 47% (95% Cl: 44%-50%) in Baja California to 5%
(95% Cl: 4%-6%) in Michoacán.
Figure 4 shows the estimates of infections, deaths and reproduction number
for each state. The reproduction number is an important parameter for assessing
whether additional interventions are required. At the start of the epidemic,
the basic reproduction number meant that an infected individual would infect
three others on average. If the reproduction number is above one, a sustained
outbreak is likely. The aim of control interventions is typically to reduce the
reproduction number below one. Following non-pharmaceutical interventions
such as school closures and decreases in population mobility, our results show
substantial reductions in the estimated value of Rt,m in each state m. However,
we can notice growth from June to this date, which has translated to a linear
growth of the infections. In some states, the number of infections goes down
and then comes back up again, making what many call a second wave.

Discussion

We applied the semi-mechanistic Bayesian hierarchical model found in Flaxman
et al. (2020) as an alternative model to estimate the number of infections and
the reproduction number in Mexico. In this context, we have incomplete and
biased data. We expect the model to provide more accurate estimates, since the
estimation is made with deaths observed over time, on the basis that the death
data is more reliable than the data of infected people. Weekly updates can be
checked at https://covid19mex.netlify.app/.
The results presented here suggest an ongoing epidemic in which substantial
reductions in the average reproduction number have been achieved through nonpharmaceutical interventions. However, our results also show that so far the
changes in mobility have not been enough to reduce the reproduction number
below one. Therefore we predict continued growth of the epidemic across Mexico
and increases in the associated number of cases and deaths unless further actions
are taken.
Our results also reveal extensive heterogeneity in predicted attack rates between states, suggesting that the epidemic is at a far more advanced stage in
some states compared to others. Despite this, in most states, a small proportion
of individuals has been infected to date, indicating that herd immunity is not
close yet. The exception is perhaps Baja California, where almost half of the
people have already been infected.
It is now established that SARS-CoV-2 pre-existing immune reactivity exists
to some degree in the general population (see, e.g., Sette and Crotty, 2020).
Pre-existing cross-reactivity against COVID-19 in a fraction of the human population is relevant in our modelling, that considers at every time a population
adjustment for susceptible individuals. This can be introduced naturally in the

10

model and is worthy of further exploration when there is more information.
Also, there is still a lot to be done regarding the adjustment in death-delayed
reporting, we will be able to set a distribution to death-delay for each state
when more data is available.
To conclude, let us highlight that this model uses mobility to predict the
rate of transmission, neglecting the potential effect of additional behavioural
changes or interventions such as increased mask wearing, changes in age specific
movement, testing and tracing.
