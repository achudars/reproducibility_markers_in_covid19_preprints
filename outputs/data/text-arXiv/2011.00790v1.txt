Abstract
At the time of writing, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), had already resulted in more than thirty-two million
cases infected and more than one million deaths worldwide. Given the fact that the pandemic is
still threatening health and safety, it is in the urgency to understand the COVID-19 contagion
process and know how it might be controlled. With this motivation in mind, in this paper,
we consider a version of stochastic discrete-time Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Death (SIRD)based epidemiological model with two uncertainties: The uncertain rate of infected cases which
are undetected or asymptomatic, and the uncertain effectiveness rate of control. Our aim is
to study the effect of an epidemic control policy on the uncertain model in a control-theoretic
framework. We begin by providing the closed-form solutions of states in the modified SIRDbased model such as infected cases, susceptible cases, recovered cases and deceased cases. Then,
the corresponding expected states and the technical lower and upper bounds for those states
are provided as well. Subsequently, we consider two epidemic control problems to be addressed:
One is almost sure epidemic control problem and the other average epidemic control problem.
Having defined the two problems, our main results are a set of sufficient conditions on a class
of linear control policy which assure that the epidemic is “well-controlled”; i.e., both of the
infected cases and deceased cases are upper bounded uniformly and the number of infected
cases converge to zero asymptotically. Our numerical studies, using the historical COVID-19
contagion data in the United States, suggest that our appealingly simple model and control
framework can provide a reasonable epidemic control performance compared to the ongoing
pandemic situation.

Introduction

At the time of writing, according to the World Health Organization, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), had already
resulted in more than thirty-two million cases infected and more than one million deaths worldwide; see [19], and even worse, the pandemic seems to be “showing no clear signs of slowing down”
in many countries. To this end, governments are persistently striving to control and slow down
the spread of COVID-19; e.g., minimizing the contact rate by consulting non-pharmaceutical intervention mechanisms such as lock-downs and social distancing or relying on some pharmaceutical
interventions such as enhancing medical treatments, and developing possible cure or remedies. With
this motivation in mind, the focal point for this paper, as a preliminary work, is to understand how
the disease spreads and how it would be possibly controlled.

In the existing literature, many mathematical epidemiological models are proposed for modeling
the virus transmission and evolution of the epidemic. For example, the seminal continuous-time
SIR compartmental model, introduced in [14], divides the individuals into three disjoint classes: the
susceptible S class, the infectious I class, and the recovered R class. After that, various extensions
and ramifications to this model are proposed which include considerations such as death due to the
epidemic, the delay time for infected individuals to become infectious, quarantining individuals,
and spatial effects; e.g., see [3,4,12,18]. In contrast to the continuous-time model, the discrete-time
counterpart for the SIR model and its modifications such as SI and SIS model are analyzed in [2]. A
stochastic version of the SIR model and its stability is discussed in [18]. In addition, a comprehensive
review along this line of research can be found in [12]. To close this brief literature survey, we
mention [1, 5, 6, 15, 17] which rely on control-theoretic approaches to mitigate the epidemics.
Consistent with the existing literature, in this paper, we consider a version of the stochastic
discrete-time Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Death (SIRD)-based epidemiological model with uncertainties. We note that two uncertain quantities are included in our modified SIRD model; i.e.,
the uncertain rate of infected cases which are undetected or asymptomatic and the uncertain effectiveness rate of control. The necessity of the uncertain rate of infected cases can be argued by the
following observations: While the number of infected cases at a given time is crucial, in practice, the
actual number of infected cases often remain unknown — only the number of infected individuals
that have been detected as “positive” is available. Said another way, many infected individuals
are indeed undetected; see [8, 16]. To this end, a typical assumption used in the literature using
SIR-based model is that the infected cases are the actual infected ones. However, this assumption is
arguably unrealistic and may lead to erroneous conclusions; e.g., see [5, 6], which justifies the needs
for introducing the uncertain rate of infected cases into our modified SIRD model. To see why
the second uncertain quantities “effectiveness rate of control” is also needed, we argue as follows:
Suppose a government already announced a social distancing or lock-down policy, there might exist
some people who are not disciplined or may be reluctant to follow the medical advise for wearing
the masks or social distancing. In addition, it might be the case that the cure being used is not
very effective or only work for a certain group of people. These considerations suggest the needs for
introducing the uncertain effectiveness on control policy into our model. It is also worth mentioning
that such a consideration, while is important, seems not appear to have been heavily considered in
the existing literature.
Unlike many COVID-19 related papers aimed at predicting the behavior of the pandemic disease, in this preliminary work, we formulate two epidemics “control” problems. That is, we aim
at studying the effect of an “abstract” epidemic control policy on the model in a control-theoretic
framework. The word “abstract” used above is to refer to the fact that we do not characterize
specifically how to develop the medical treatments or when to lock-down using our control policy.
Instead, we show the cause and effect when the policy is applied and how much it may affect the
disease. To this end, we provide useful analytic expressions for all of the states; i.e., textitinfected
cases, susceptible cases, recovered cases and deceased cases, in our modified SIRD-based model.
Furthermore, we show a set of sufficient conditions on a class of linear control policy which assure
that the epidemic is “well-controlled” in the following sense: Both of the infected cases and deceased cases are upper bounded uniformly, and the ratio of infected cases must go down to zero
asymptotically. Our numerical studies, using the historical COVID-19 contagion data in the United
States, suggest that our appealingly simple model and control framework can provide a reasonable
performance compared to the ongoing pandemic situation.

Organization of the Paper

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 we describe the preliminaries
involving the details of our modified SIRD-based epidemiological model. Then two problem formulations for epidemic control: Almost sure epidemic control problem and average epidemic control
problem are stated. Subsequently, in Sections 3, detailed analyses on our epidemiological model are
provided. In Sections 4 and 5, using a linear epidemic control policy, we provide sufficient conditions
on feedback gain so that the epidemic can be properly controlled in either expected value sense or
almost sure sense. Next, in Section 6, we describe a simple model parameter estimation approach
and illustrate its use via numerical examples involving historical COVID-19 data from the United
States, the country among those with a relatively high confirmed cases in the middle of 2020. The
control performance is also discussed. Finally, in Section 7, we provide some concluding remarks
and promising directions for future research.

Preliminaries and Problem Formulation

In the sequel, we take k to be the index indicating the day number and u(k) ≥ 0 to be the
corresponding abstract epidemic control policy implemented by governments.1 We view that the
large values of u(k) correspond to enhanced medical treatments or stringent non-pharmaceutical
interventions such as mandating social distancing with wearing the masks. The smaller values of
u(k) might correspond to diminished medical treatments or relaxation of the rules. In the analysis
to follow, we assume that the epidemic control policy u(k) is causal ; i.e., it only depends on the
past and current information that is available at hand—not the future.

2.1

Epidemiology Model with Uncertainties

For k = 0, 1, . . . , let S(k) be the number of susceptible cases at the kth day, I(k) be the infected
cases at the kth day and R(k) be the recovered cases at the kth day, and D(k) be the deceased
cases at the kth day. Take N (k) be the underlying human population at the kth day satisfying
N (k) = S(k)+I(k)+R(k). As mentioned in Section 1, many infected individuals may go undetected
or asymptomatic [16] and the effectiveness of a control policy u(k) may be uncertain at the time, we
introduce two uncertainty quantities: The uncertain rate of infected cases which are undetected or
asymptomatic, call it δ(k), and the uncertain effectiveness rate of control, call it v(k), in our model
to follow. Now, with initial values S(0) := N (0) := S0 , I(0) := I0 > 0, and R(0) = D(0) = 0, we
consider a discrete-time stochastic epidemiological model with uncertainties described by

S(k + 1) = S(k) − δ(k)I(k);

where dI (k) is the death rate for infected cases satisfying dI (k) ∈ [0, dmax ] with dmax < 1 for all
k. We assume that the sequence dI (k) are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random
1 Again, as mentioned in Section 1, the word “abstract” is to indicate that we do not characterize specifically how
to develop the medical treatments or when to lock-down using our control policy. Instead, we show the cause and
effect when the policy is applied and how much it may affect the disease.

variables. In addition, we assume that both of δ(k) and v(k) are i.i.d. random variables with
arbitrary distribution but known bounds 0 ≤ δ(k) ≤ δmax and 0 < vmin ≤ v(k) ≤ vmax ≤ 1,
respectively.2 If v(k) = 1, it corresponds to the case where the control policy is extremely effective.
On the other hand, if v(k) ≈ 0, it corresponds to an extremely ineffective case; i.e., the people are
not disciplined and may be unwilling to follow the medical advise for masks or social distancing;
see also a discussion in Section 3.5. In the sequel, we assume further that I0 δmax < S0 ; and v(k),
δ(k), and dI (k) are mutually independent. For the sake of notational convenience, we also take the
shorthand notations δ := E[δ(k)], dI := E[dI (k)] and v := E[v(k)] for all k.
Remark on the Epidemiology Model. As a preliminary work, while we allow uncertainties
on both infected cases I(k) and control u(k), our epidemiological model 1 assumes that u(·) can
interact with the infected cases instantaneously without any time delay. The action with delay is
left for future work; see also Section 7. It is also worth mentioning that, if one considers a linear
control policy u(k) = KI(k) with constant K ≥ 0, then a basic reproduction ratio of sorts, call it
R0 (·), can be obtained as follows: For k ≥ 0,
R0 (k) :=

β(k)
γ(k) + dI (k)

where β(k) := δ(k)(S(k) + I(k)))/S(k) is the infectious rate and γ(k) := v(k)K is the recovery
rate. If R0 (·) > 1, the number of infected cases is expected to increase; if R0 (·) < 1, then the
infected cases decrease. Finally, we should mention that, in terms of the terminology in systems
and control theory, the epidemiological dynamics described by equation (1) is indeed an uncertain
linear time-varying system. This observation is useful in the following sections to follow.

2.2

An Almost Sure Epidemic Control Problem

In this subsection, we introduce the first epidemic control problem, which we call the almost sure
epidemic control problem. That is, given the modified SIRD model 1, we seek a control policy u(·)
which assures the following conditions hold:
(i) The ratio of infected cases converge to zero with probability one; i.e.,
lim

k→∞

I(k)

with probability one.
(ii) There exists a constant MI > 0 such that infected cases I(k) is upper bounded uniformly
by MI ; i.e., I(k) ≤ MI for all k with probability one.
(iii) There exists a constant MD > 0 such that deceased cases D(k) is upper bounded uniformly
by MD ; i.e., D(k) ≤ MD for all k with probability one.
Remarks. The results related to this almost sure epidemic control problem is discussed in
Section 4 when a linear control policy of the form u(k) = KI(k) with pure gain K ≥ 0 for all k ≥ 0
is applied.
While almost sure epidemic control policy, if exists, can be a good candidate to mitigate the
pandemic. However, in practice, some potential issues remain. For example, in some cases, the

max is in the support of δ(k) and dmax is in the support of dI (k). Lastly,
the bounds vmin and vmax are in the support for v(k).

cost for implementing an almost sure epidemic control policy may be still too expensive in practice;
see Remark 4.1.2 in Section 4. To hedge this issue, we now introduce our second epidemic control
problem which we call the average epidemic control problem aimed at controlling the “expected”
infected cases and “expected” deceased cases.

2.3

An Average Epidemic Control Problem

To address the issue raised in previous subsection, we consider the second epidemic control problem
which we call the average epidemic control problem aimed at controlling the “expected” infected
cases and “expected” deceased cases. Rigorously speaking, given the modified SIRD model 1, we
seek a control policy u(·) which assures the following conditions hold:
(i) The ratio of expected infected cases E[I(k)]/I0 converge to zero asymptotically.
(ii) There exists a constant CI > 0 such that expected infected cases E[I(k)] is upper bounded
uniformly by CI ; i.e., E[I(k)] ≤ CI for all k.
(iii) There exists a constant CD > 0 such that deceased cases E[D(k)] is upper bounded uniformly by CD ; i.e., E[D(k)] ≤ CD for all k.
Remark. Similar to the previous remark, the results related to this average epidemic control
problem is discussed in Section 5 when a linear control policy of the form u(k) = KI(k) with K ≥ 0
for all k ≥ 0 is applied.

Analysis of Epidemiological Model

In this section, to understand the contagion process and the evolution of the epidemic, we assume
that there exists a control policy u(·) which assures that infected cases I(k), susceptible cases S(k),
recovered cases R(k) and deceased cases D(k) are all nonnegative for all k with probability one.3
The analytic expression for infected cases, susceptible cases, recovered cases, and deceased cases
are provided. The results obtained in this section are useful for the subsequent sections to follow.

3.1

Analysis of Infected Cases

In the sequel, we use a shorthand notation
Φ(k, k0 ) :=

k−1
Y

(1 + δ(i) − dI (i))

(2)

i=k0

for integer k ≥ k0 ≥ 0. We mention here that Φ(k, k0 ) is a state transition function for infected
cases from day k0 to k. The reader is referred to [7] for detailed discussion on this topic. We may
sometimes write ΦI (·, ·) instead of Φ(·, ·) to emphasize that the function is related to the infected
cases. The following lemma characterizes some useful properties of the function.
Lemma 3.1 (Properties of State Transition Function). For integer k ≥ k0 ≥ 0, the state transition
function ΦI (k, k0 ) satisfies
(i) (1 − dmax )k−k0 ≤ ΦI (k, k0 ) ≤ (1 + δmax )k−k0 with probability one.
(ii) E[ΦI (k, k0 )] = (1 + δ − d)k−k0 .
3 Such a policy exists, for example, by taking u(k) = KI(k) with K ∈ [0, (1 − d
max )/vmax ]; see Section 4 for
detailed discussion on this topic.

Proof. To prove part (i), we let f (k) := 1 + δ(k) − dI (k). Since δ(k) ∈ [0, δmax ] and dI (k) ≥ 0
for all k ≥ k0 ≥ 0, we have 1 − dmax ≤ f (k) ≤ 1 + δmax for all k with probability one. Note that
the upper and lower bounds are nonnegative. Hence, a straightforward multiplication leads to the
desired inequality and the proof of part (i) is complete.
To prove part (ii), with the aid of the fact that δ(k) and dI (k) are i.i.d. in k and are mutually
independent, we obtain

where δ = E[δ(k0 )] and dI = E[dI (k0 )], which is desired.
Having proved Lemma 3.1, we are now ready to characterize the infected cases I(k).
Lemma 3.2 (Number of Infected Cases). Given I0 > 0, the infected cases at the kth day is
described by

Proof. Since the infected cases dynamics (1) is a linear time-varying system, the solution I(k) and
its corresponding proof are well-established; hence we omitted here and refer the reader to any
standard textbook in system theory; e.g., see [7].
To complete the proof, we must show that the expected infected cases can be characterized by
the form described in the lemma. Using Lemma 3.1 and the fact that v(k) ≥ vmin and are i.i.d., we
observe that
E [I(k)] = E[ΦI (k, 0)]I0 −

Note that u(i), as assumed in Section 2, is causal; i.e., it only depends on the information available
up to the ith day. In addition, according to equation (2), the state transition function ΦI (k, i + 1) =
Qk−1
j=i+1 (1 + δ(j) − dI (j)), which is independent of u(i) for i = 0, . . . , k − 1. Therefore, it follows

Remark

As seen later in the next section, if one adopts the linear feedback policy of the form u(k) = KI(k),
then the solution I(k) described in Lemma 3.2 can be greatly simplified.

3.2

Analysis of Susceptible Cases

The following lemma gives a closed-form expression for the susceptible cases S(k).
Lemma 3.3 (Number of Susceptible Cases). With S(0) = S0 > 0, the number of susceptible cases
at the kth day is given by

Analysis of Recovered Cases

In this subsection, we characterize the solution of recovered cases and some of its useful properties.
Lemma 3.4 (Number of Recovered Cases). With r(0) = 0, the recovered cases at the kth day is
Pk−1
given by R(k) = i=0
v(i)u(i) for k ≥ 1. Moreover, the expected number of recovered cases is given
Pk−1
by E[R(k)] = i=0 E[v(i)u(i)]. Moreover, it is bounded; i.e.,

for k ≥ 1.
Proof. While the proof is simple, for the sake of completion, we provide a full proof here. We first
recall that r(0) = 0 by assumption on initial condition. To complete the proof, we proceed a proof
by induction. Begin by noting that for k = 1, the recursion on R(k) tells us that r(1) = r(0) +
P
v(0)u(0) = v(0)u(0). We now proceed a proof by induction. Assuming that r(j) = j−1
i=0 v(i)u(i)
Pk
for all j ≤ k, we must show R(k + 1) = i=0 v(i)u(i). Note that
R(k + 1) = R(k) + v(k)u(k)
=

v(i)u(i)

i=0

which is desired.
To complete the P
proof, we now show the desired expected recovered cases and its bounds. For
k−1
k ≥ 1, since R(k) = i=0 u(i)v(i), with the linearity of expected value, it immediately follows that
Pk−1
E[R(k)] = i=0 E[v(i)u(i)]. Hence, using the fact that 0 < vmin ≤ v(k) ≤ vmax ≤ 1 for all k, it
implies that

E[u(i)] ≤ E[R(k)] ≤ vmax

which is desired.

Remark

It is readily seen that R(k) is increasing in k since u, v are nonnegative.

3.4

Analysis of Deceased Cases

The number of deceased cases and its expectation are provided in this subsection.
Lemma 3.5 (Number of Deceased Cases). With D(0) = 0, the number of deceased cases at the kth
day is given by
D(k) =

k−1

for k ≥ 1. Moreover, the expected number of death is bounded by

i=0

Proof. With D(0) = 0, we begin by recalling that the deaths dynamics (1) is given by D(k +
1) = D(k) + dI (k)I(k) for k ≥ 0. An almost identical proof as seen in Lemma 3.2 leads to
Pk−1
D(k) = i=0 dI (i)I(i) for k ≥ 1.
To complete the proof, we take expectation on equation 5 and, with the linearity of expectation
and the fact 0 ≤ dI (k) ≤ dmax , the desired inequality follows immediately.

What if No or Extremely Ineffective Control

If there are low or no medical supports, i.e., u(k) ≈ 0, or the medical treatments are lacking or
extremely ineffective, due to the reasons such as the people are not disciplined or unwilling to follow
the medical advise to wearing masks or social distancing; i.e., v(k) ≈ 0, then it is readily verified
that the susceptible cases, infected cases, recovered cases, and deceased cases become

Consistent with the intuition, the equation (6) above tells us that the recovered cases R(k) are
close to zero approximately. On the other hand, the infected cases I(k) and the deceased cases D(k)
are both increasing monotonically; i.e., an “outbreak” is seen.

3.6

Linear Epidemic Control Policy

To mitigate the pandemic, in this paper, we consider a class of linear epidemic control policy of
the form u(k) := KI(k) for k ≥ 0 where K ≥ 0 is the feedback gain which represents the degree of
the epidemic control effort on providing medical treatment or mandating the non-pharmaceutical
interventions. In the sequel, we sometimes call the linear epidemic control policy above as linear
feedback policy or just linear policy for the sake of brevity.

Control of Epidemics in Almost Sure Sense

As mentioned in Section 2, our objective of this section is to address the almost sure epidemic
control problem using the linear control policy. We begin with discussing the control of infected
cases in the almost sure sense.

4.1

Control of Infected Cases

The following lemma is useful for deriving one of our main results: Theorem 4.2.
Lemma 4.1 (Boundedness of Infected Cases). For any linear control policy of the form u(k) =
KI(k) with gain 0 ≤ K ≤ (1 − dmax )/vmax , we have
(i) 0 ≤ I(k) ≤ (1 + δmax − Kvmin )k I0 for all k ≥ 1 with probability one.
(ii) If K < (1 − dmax )/vmax , then I(k) > 0 for all k ≥ 1 with probability one.

Proof. Fix k ≥ 1 and let u(k) = KI(k) with K ∈ 0, 1−d

becomes I(k + 1) = (1 + δ(k) − dI (k) − Kv(k))I(k), which implies that
I(k) =

k−1
Y
i=0

9

f (i)I0

where f (i) := 1 + δ(i) − dI (i) − Kv(i). Since
f (i) ≥ 1 − dmax − Kvmax
and K ≤ (1 − dmax )/vmax , we conclude that the f (i) ≥ 0 for all i = 0, . . . , k − 1. Therefore, the
product of f (i) is also nonnegative which implies that I(k) ≥ 0 for all k with probability one. To
max
complete the proof of part (i), we note that for any K ∈ [0, 1−d
vmax ], the infected cases satisfy
I(k) =

k−1
Y

(1 + δ(i) − dI (i) − Kv(i))I0

i=0

≤ (1 + δmax − Kvmin )k I0
which is desired.
To prove part (ii), an almost identical proof as seen in part (i) applies. That is, if K <
(1 − dmax )/vmax , then I(k) > 0 for all k with probability one.
4.1.1

Remark

According to part (ii) of the lemma above, we see that if K < (1 − dmax )/vmax , then the infected
cases I(k) is strictly positive for all k with probability one. Said another way, the infected cases
can not be eradicated at any time. However, as seen in the next theorem, the ratio of the infected
cases can go down to zero asymptotically for some K.
Theorem 4.2 (Asymptotic Behavior and Boundedness on Infected Cases). If the maximum unmax )

then we have

probability one. If K = δvmax

≤ log(1 + δ − Kv).
where the last inequality hold by the monotonicity of logarithmic function. Hence, log(1+δ−Kv) ≤
0 for any K ≥ δmax /vmin ≥ δ/v. Therefore, E[log f (0)] < 0, which implies that limk→∞ I(k)/I0 → 0
and the proof for part (i) is complete.

Practical Considerations and Sub-Optimal Feedback Gain

In practice, since the medical resource is limited, it is natural to put additional constraints on
the feedback gain such as K ∈ [0, L] with L ≥ 1 being the constant which corresponds to the
maximum allowable medical resources to be used. Hence, other than the sufficient condition 7, for
max )
, one might require K to satisfy
any δmax < vmin (1−d
vmax


δmax 1 − dmax
∩ [0, L].
(9)
K ∈ K :=
,
vmin
vmax
However, one should note that the set K might be an empty set. To see this, we consider L = 1,
vmin = vmax = 0.01 and δmax = 0.1 and dmax = 0.01. Then it is readily verified that the condition
11

max )
but K = (10, 99)∩[0, 1] = ∅. If K = ∅, it tells us that the infected cases does not
δmax < vmin (1−d
vmax
converge to zero asymptotically and the epidemic is uncontrollable. If this is the case, one should
put whatever they can to suppress the disease; e.g., by putting K := L for possible L ≥ 1.
On the other hand, given the fact that the higher feedback gain would cause a higher consumption on medical/economical resources, one should choose the lowest feedback gain which is nonzero.
Hence, an immediate “sub-optimal” choice would simply be as follows: If δmax ≤ vmin we take
K ∗ := δmax /vmin with the aim that I(k) ≤ I0 can be guaranteed at least. On the other hand, if
δmax > vmin , we take K ∗ := L. Or, we can write it in a more compact way as follows:

K ∗ :=

δmax
·1
+ L · 1{δmax >Lvmin }
vmin {δmax ≤Lvmin }

(10)

max )
provided that δmax < vmin (1−d
where 1{δmax ≤Lvmin } and 1{δmax >Lvmin } are the indicator function;
vmax
see [11] for a detailed discussion on this topic. As seen later in Section 6, the K ∗ above will be
adopted to test the epidemic control performance using historical data.

Recovered Cases, Susceptible Cases, and Deceased Cases

In this subsection, the recovered cases R(k), susceptible cases S(k), and deceased cases D(k) under
linear control policy are discussed.
The analysis of recovered cases is simple. We begin by recalling
Pk−1
Lemma 3.4 and write R(k) = i=0
v(i)u(i). Now, by taking linear control policy u(k) = KI(k)
with gain 0 ≤ K ≤ (1 − dmax )/vmax , we have R(k) ≥ 0 for all k with probability one and
R(k) ≤ vmax K

Thus, via a lengthy but straightforward calculations, it is readily verified that S(k) ≥ 0 for k ≤

Remark. While the lemma above tells us that S(k) ≥ 0 holds up to k ≤ ⌊S0 /(I0 δmax )⌋, we
should note that the initial cases S0 = N (0) are often far larger than the denominator I0 δmax .
Hence, without loss of generality, in the sequel, we deemed that S(k) ≥ 0 for sufficiently large k.
The next lemma indicates that the deceased cases under the linear control policy.
Lemma 4.4 (Upper Bound on The Deceased Cases Under Linear Policy). Any linear policy of

Almost Sure Epidemic Control Policy: A Revisit

With the aids of Theorem 4.2 and Lemma 4.4, we see that if we take linear feedback policy
with constant gain;
 i.e., u(k) = KI(k) and assuming that δmax < vmin (1 − dmax )/vmax and
δmax 1−dmax
K ∈ vmin , vmax , then we have: (i) infected cases converges to zero asymptotically with prob-

ability one. (ii) there exists a constant MI := I0 > 0 such that infected cases I(k) ≤ MI for all k
with probability one. (iii) there exists a constant
MD :=

I0 dmax
>0
Kvmin − δmax

such that infected cases I(k) ≤ MD for all k with probability one. Therefore, the almost sure
epidemic control problem is solved.
While the almost sure epidemic control policy, if exists, can be a good candidate to mitigate the
pandemic, some potential issues remain in practice. That is, recalling Remark 4.1.2 in Section 4, it
tells us that, in some cases, the almost sure epidemic control policy, while exist, may not be possible
to implement. To address this, as mentioned in Section 2, we now move to our second epidemic
control problem which we call the average epidemic control problem. In this setting, the aim now
becomes to control the “expected” infected cases and “expected” deceased cases

5

Control of Epidemics in the Sense of Expected Value

In this section, we provide our results on control of epidemics in the sense of expected value. We
begin with discussing the control of expected infected cases.

5.1

Control of Expected Infected Cases

The lemma below provides an useful analytical expression for the expected number of infected cases.
Lemma 5.1 (Expected Value of Infected Cases). The expected number of infected cases is given by
E[I(k)] = (1+δ−dI −Kv)k I0 for any linear policy u(k) = KI(k) with gain K ∈ [0, (1 − dmax )/vmax ].
Proof. The proof is straightforward. We begin by noting that, for any linear policy u(k) = KI(k)
Qk−1
with gain K ∈ [0, (1 − dmax )/vmax ], I(k) ≥ 0 for all k with probability one and I(k) = i=0
(1 +
δ(i)−dI (i)−Kv(i))I0 . Since δ(k), dI (k) and v(k) are i.i.d in k and are mutually independent, taking
the expected value on the I(k) above yields
E[I(k)] =

k−1
Y

E[1 + δ(i) − dI (i) − Kv(i)]I0

i=0

= 1 + δ − dI − Kv
and the proof is complete.

With the aid of the lemma above, we are now ready to provide our second main result.

and the feedback gain satisfies

then we have
(i) limk→∞ E[I(k)]/I0 = 0.
(ii) The expected infected cases are upper bounded uniformly by initial infected cases; i.e.,
E[I(k)] ≤ I0 for all k ≥ 0.
(iii) If K := (δ − dI )/v, then we have E[I(k)] = I0 for all k.
Proof. The idea of the proof is similar to the one used in Theorem 4.2. However, for the sake
max )v
and
of completeness, we provide our full proof here. We begin by assuming that δ < (1−d
vmax
max

one. Now, according to Lemma 5.1, we have

δ−dI
v

E[I(k)] = (E[f (0)])k I0

(12)

where E[f (0)] = 1 + δ − dI − Kv. To see the desired limiting result, we now write (E[f (0)])k =
exp (k log E[f (0)]) . Hence,


E[I(k)]
= exp lim k log E[f (0)] .
lim
k→∞
k→∞
I0
Note that
log E[f (0)] = log(1 + δ − dI − Kv).
Hence, log(1 + δ − dI − Kv) < 0 for any K > (δ − dI )/v and the logarithmic function is welldefined for K within the assumed range. Therefore, we have log E[f (0)] < 0, which implies that
limk→∞ E[I(k)]/I0 → 0 and the proof for part (i) is complete.
To prove part (ii), we fix k and simply note that, with the assumed assumptions on δ and K
and the fact that dI (·) ≥ 0, it is readily verified that E[I(k)] ≤ I0 , which completes the proof of
part (ii).
To prove part (iii), take K = (δ − dI )/v and substitute it back into the equation 12, we obtain
E[I(k)] = I0 for all k and the proof of part (iii) is complete.
5.1.1

Due to the limited available medical resources, it is reasonable to choose a “sub-optimal” K in the
sense of minimizing the potential use of medical resources. For example, we let 1{δ≤Lv} and 1{δ>Lv}
be the indicator functions and consider
K ∗ := K =

Recovered Cases, Susceptible Cases, and Deceased Cases

In this subsection, the expected recovered cases E[R(k)], expected susceptible cases E[S(k)], and
expected deceased cases E[D(k)] under linear control policy are discussed.

Average Epidemic Control Policy: A Revisit

I
a pure constant gain; i.e., u(k) = KI(k) and assuming that δ < (1−d

with dI > 0, then we have: (i) Expected infected cases converges to zero asymptotically. (ii) There

exists a constant
I0 dI
CD :=

Kv − δ + dI
such that expected deceased cases E[D(k)] ≤ CD for all k. Therefore, the average epidemic control
problem is solved. In the next section to follow, we provide an illustrative example using historical
COVID-19 data to demonstrate our epidemic control performance.

6

Examples Using Historical Data: United State

We now illustrate the application of our control methodology on the epidemiological model using
historical data for year 2020 available in https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus, which contain the
number of daily confirmed cases, denoted by c(k), and daily reported deaths, denoted by d(k) for
k = 0, 1, . . . , N − 1 for some fixed integer N .

6.1

A Simple Data-Driven Estimations

To study the epidemic control performance, there are various way to estimate the uncertain parameters; e.g., one can consult “standard” approach such as minimizing the least-square estimation error
b dbI and vb; e.g., see [5, 6, 9]. However, for the sake of simplicto obtain the “optimal” parameters δ,
ity, we now provide a simple “mean-replacing” approach to estimate the uncertain rate of infected
cases δ(·) and the death rate dI via the available data of confirmed cases and the number of reported
deaths. That is, we begin by recalling that the deceased cases satisfy D(k + 1) = D(k) + dI (k)I(k).
For k = 0, 1, . . . , N − 1, given the confirmed (infected) cases c(k) and reported deaths d(k) and
taking c(k) := I(k) and d(k) := D(k), we obtain
d(k + 1) = d(k) + dI (k)c(k).
Then, the estimate of death rate dI (k), call it dbI , is defined by4

N −1
1 X d(k + 1) − d(k)
b
dI :=
.
N
c(k)

(15)

k=0

4 Of course, one can also consult an moving average flavored estimate on the d (k). Here, as a preliminary work,
I
the simple “mean-replacing” estimate is used.

18

Having found dbI , we can now estimate the remaining two uncertain quantities δ(k) and v(k). To
this end, assume that the adopted epidemic control policy is linear of the form u(k) = KI(k)
with K := 1; i.e., we ideally assumed that government had put all available resources to control the
pandemic. Now, setting c(k) := I(k), dbI := dI (k), and replacing v(k) by its mean v, we obtain
c(k + 1) = (1 + δ(k) − dbI − v)c(k)

b is given by

Having obtained the estimates δb and dbI , we then ready to apply the epidemiological model and use
it to compare it with the available data; see next subsections to follow.

6.2

Control of COVID-19 Contagion in Almost Sure Sense

Using the data from the start of the epidemy, over a horizon starting from March 1, 2020 to
September 8, 2020, we obtain the estimates δb with δmax := δb ≈ 0.5135 and dbI := dmax ≈ 0.0449. In
addition, we take L = 2 and assume that the effectiveness rate of control v(k) follows a uniform
distribution with vmin = 0.1 and vmax = 0.2; i.e., 10% to 20% effectiveness rate on control. Observe
that
vmin (1 − dmax )
≈ 0.4775.
δmax >
vmax
Hence, Theorem 4.2 does not apply. However, we can still choose a suboptimal feedback gain
discussed in Section 4.1.2; i.e.,
K ∗ := K =

δmax
· 1{δmax ≤Lvmin } + L · 1{δmax >Lvmin } = L.
vmin

This means that, if the infected cases can not be well-controlled in almost sure sense, governments
should put whatever they can to suppress it; here, we see a 100 · L% feedback gain is applied. The
epidemic control performance is shown in Figure 1 where the black solid lines depict the confirmed
cases c(k) and reported deaths d(k) from historical COVID-19 data in the United States. The other
thinner lines with various colors depict the epidemic control performance, in terms of c(k) and d(k),
under the linear policy u(k) = Kc(k) with K := L. Interestingly, the figure also tells us that if
L = 2 is possible, it may yield, in average, a lower confirmed cases.
6.2.1

Control of Infected and Deceased Cases in Expected Value

With the aid of equations 15 and 17, we obtain the estimates dbI ≈ 0.002 and δb := δ ≈ 0.215. Similar
to the previous example, we again assume that v(k) follows a uniform distribution with vmin = 0.1
and vmax = 0.2; hence the average v = 0.15. It is readily verified that our estimates satisfy
δ<

(1 − dmax )v
≈ 0.998.
vmax

Figure 1: Almost Sure Epidemic Control Performance: Confirmed Infected Cases c(k) (top) and

Hence, Theorem 5.2 applies if we take
K ∗ := K =

δ
+ L · 1{δ>Lv} ≈ 1.4245.
·1
v {δ≤Lv}

The control policy above tells us that the government may need to bring in extra medical resources
to achieve K > 1. The corresponding epidemic control performance is shown in Figure 2 where the
confirmed cases is on the top panel and the deaths is on the bottom panel. In the figure, we see
a downward trend occurs on the confirmed cases and the saturated deaths as time increases. The
Figure 3 shows, with y-axis in log-scale, the epidemic control performance comparison where the
black solid lines are the reported confirmed cases (top) and reported deaths (bottom).

Concluding Remarks and Future Work

This preliminary work has been done in the urgency of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, with
the mind of providing a simple yet explainable epidemiological model with a rigorous study on
the effectiveness of a linear epidemic control policy class. Consistent with the existing literature
on epidemic modeling and control, this paper considers a modified stochastic SIRD-based model.
We analyzed the model and considered two epidemy control problems: One is the almost sure
epidemic control problem and the other is the average epidemic control problem. Then, for both
of two problems, with linear control policy, we show sufficient conditions on feedback gain so
that the epidemy is deemed to be “well-controlled” in the sense that infected cases goes down
to zero asymptotically, and both infected cases and deceased cases are upper bounded uniformly.

Subsequently, we provide a simple data-driven parameter estimations and show some promising
numerical results using historical COVID-19 data in the United States. Based on our work to date,
two important directions immediately present themselves for future work which described in the
next subsections to follow.

7.1

Generalization to Multi-Population Epidemic Control

It is possible to extend our analysis to involve multi-population epidemics. To illustrate this,
below we consider only the infected cases dynamics. Fix m populations, then for each population
i = 1, . . . , m, we write
Ii (k + 1) = (1 + δ(k) − dI,i (k))Ii (k) − ui (k)vi (k)
with limited medical resource
u(k) =

m
X

(18)

ui (k) ≤ umax

i=1

for some umax > 0 and the overall infected cases are
I(k) =

m
X

Ii (k).

i=1

˜
It is also possible to consider the case where the control policy is with delay effect; i.e., u(k − d)
˜
with delay time d; see also [13] for a discussion on handling the time delay considerations in a class
of positive finance systems.

7.2

Economic Budgets Consumption

Another possible research direction would be to take the economic budget into play. As seen in
Remark 4.1.2, the idea of minimizing the expenditure induced by implementing control policy may
lead to a version of “optimal” choice for feedback gain K. In particular, one can even consider the
budget dynamics and carry out the optimization. Specifically, let B(k) be the available medical
budget at the kth day which satisfies
B(k + 1) = B(k) + p(k)u(k)
where p(k) is the price to pay per control policy at each stage, which can be modeled as a random
variables with finite support. Then, it is readily verified that
B(k) = B0 +

k−1
X

p(i)u(i)

i=0

for k ≥ 1. From here, there are many possible directions to pursue. For example, one can consider a
optimization problem which minimizes the expected budget cost and infected cases; i.e., one might
seek to find a sequence of K which solve
inf E[βB(k) + γI(k)]
K

for some constants β and γ.
