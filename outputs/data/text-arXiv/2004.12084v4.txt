Abstract
With the rapid development of COVID-19 into a global
pandemic, there is an ever more urgent need for cheap, fast
and reliable tools that can assist physicians in diagnosing
COVID-19. Medical imaging such as CT can take a key
role in complementing conventional diagnostic tools from
molecular biology, and, using deep learning techniques,
several automatic systems were demonstrated promising
performances using CT or X-ray data. Here, we advocate
a more prominent role of point-of-care ultrasound imaging
to guide COVID-19 detection. Ultrasound is non-invasive
and ubiquitous in medical facilities around the globe.
Our contribution is threefold. First, we gather a lung
ultrasound (POCUS) dataset consisting of 1103 images
(654 COVID-19, 277 bacterial pneumonia and 172
healthy controls), sampled from 64 videos. This dataset
was assembled from various online sources, processed
specifically for deep learning models and is intended to
serve as a starting point for an open-access initiative.
Second, we train a deep convolutional neural network
(POCOVID-Net) on this 3-class dataset and achieve an
accuracy of 89% and, by a majority vote, a video accuracy
of 92% . For detecting COVID-19 in particular, the model
performs with a sensitivity of 0.96, a specificity of 0.79
and F1-score of 0.92 in a 5-fold cross validation.
Third, we provide an open-access web service
(POCOVIDScreen) that is available at: https:
//pocovidscreen.org.
The website deploys the
predictive model, allowing to perform predictions on
ultrasound lung images. In addition, it grants medical
staff the option to (bulk) upload their own screenings
in order to contribute to the growing public database
of pathological lung ultrasound images.

1 Introduction

The strengths of POCUS are numerous and include its
simplicity of execution, its ease of repeatability, its noninvasiveness, its execution without relocation and its ease
of disinfection at the bedside. The devices are small and
portable and can be wrapped in single-use plastics to reduce the risk of contamination and promoting sterilization
procedures. Moreover, US is very cost-effective, with an
estimated $140 for an US examination compared to $370
for chest X-ray [23] and $675 – $8600 for chest CT [24].
The low price of the device itself, starting from $2000,
facilitates the distribution to hospitals and primary care
centers [25]. The diagnostic routine can be accelerated by
connecting the device to a cloud service and uploading the
recordings automatically. As a tool that is ubiquitously
available even in sparsely equipped medical facilities and
that can serve not only for diagnosis but also for monitoring disease evolution on a daily basis, POCUS is the ideal
biomedical imaging tool in the current crisis.

To date, SARS-CoV-2 has infected several millions and
killed hundreds of thousands around the globe. Due to
its long incubation time, fast, accurate and reliable techniques for early disease diagnosis are key in successfully
fighting the spread [1]. The standard genetic test, reverse
transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), is characterized by high reliability (at least in most countries)
but a relatively long processing time (more than an hour).
Alternatively, fast serology tests are in early stages of development, and are based on antibodies that the immune
system only produces in an advanced stage of the disease.
It is of great concern, however, that several publications
have reported the problem of false negatives thrown by
molecular genetics and immunological tests [2, 3, 4, 5].
Overall, global containment efforts suffer from bottlenecks
in diagnosis due to partially unreliable tests and lacking
availability of the necessary testing equipment; a situation
exacerbated by often asymptomatic, yet infected patients
that are not properly managed due to the lack of precision
around the global process [2].

The growing expectations of POCUS are perhaps best
exemplified by the NIH’s recently launched large-scale
initiative on "Point Of Care UltraSonography (POCUS)
for risk stratification of COVID-19 patients" (accessible at: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/
NCT04338100). However, this initiative is launched without the availability of an automatic tool that can assist in
COVID-19 detection and patient stratification. Therefore,
there is an evident need for an open-source framework
that pools COVID-19 ultrasound scans from worldwide
sources and exploits the power of deep learning to develop
a system that can complement the work of physicians in a
timely manner.

Biomedical imaging. In this context, biomedical imaging techniques have great potential to complement the
conventional diagnostic techniques of COVID-19 such as
molecular biology (RT-PCR) and immune (IGM/G) assays.
Specifically, imaging can be a viable tool in the detection
process by providing a fast assessment of patients in order to guide the selection of subsequent molecular and
immunological tests. Indeed, it was reported in two studies
that CT scans can detect COVID-19 at higher sensitivity
rate (98, respectively 88%) compared to RT-PCR (71%
and 59%) in cohorts of 51 [6] and 1014 patients [7]. Note
that sensitivity of RT-PCR varies heavily across countries,
ranging from 65% [5] to 96% [8]. While CT scans are the
gold standard for pneumonia detection [9], X-ray scans are
still the first line examination, despite their low specificity
and sensitivity [10, 11], whereas ultrasound (US) has only
received growing attention in the last few years [12] and
achieved promising results [13]. In this contribution, we
emphatically make the case for a more prominent role of
the latter, based on clear evidence for the diagnostic value
of lung ultrasound (US), which is provided in much detail
in a comparison of CT, X-ray and US in section 2.

Automatic detection. In the last months, a myriad of
preprints attempting to use machine learning for biomedical image analysis for COVID-19 has appeared, but to
the best of our knowledge they exclusively focus on Xray or CT (for reviews see [26, 27, 28, 29]) and neither
a publication nor a preprint has used ultrasound data for
automatic COVID-19 detection. Here, we aim to close
this gap with a first approach of training a deep learning
model to detect COVID-19 on POCUS images. It is crucial
to note that medical doctors must be trained thoroughly
to reliably differentiate COVID-19 from pneumonia and
that the relevant patterns are hard to discern for the human
eye [30]. Therefore, automatic detection is highly relevant
as it has been shown to reduce the time doctors invest to
make a diagnosis [31].

Lung point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS). Note first
that lung ultrasound is already an established method for
monitoring pneumonia and related lung diseases [12, 14,
15]. It has been suggested as the preferred diagnosis technique for lung infections, especially in resource limited
settings such as emergency situations or low-income countries [16] and it has started to replace X-ray as first-line
examination [9, 13, 17, 18]. Although literature on the
applicability of ultrasound for COVID-19 is still scarce, a
growing body of evidence for disease-specific patterns in
US has lead to advocacy for an amplified role of US in the
research community [19, 20, 21, 22].

Our contribution. In this work, we propose the first
framework for automatized detection of COVID-19 on US
images. Our study is in line with others demonstrating that
deep learning can be a promising tool to detect COVID-19
from CT [32] or X-ray [33]. Our contributions can be
summarized in the following three steps:
1. We publish the first dataset of lung POCUS recordings
of COVID-19, pneumonia and healthy patients. The
collected data is heterogeneous, but was pre-processed

Ultrasound. Ultrasound can evidence pleural and interstitial thickening, subpleural consolidation and other physiological phenomena linked to changes in lung structure
when the infection is in early stages [19]. Studies report
abnormalities in bilateral B-lines (hydroaeric comet-tail artifacts arising from the pleural line), as well as identifiable
lesions in the bilateral lower lobes as the main characteristics to enable COVID-19 detection [47, 48]. In Figure 1 an example of B-lines visible in the US image of a
COVID-19 patient is shown. In a review, [46] observed
great agreement between ultrasound and CT when monitoring COVID-19 patients (especially between B-lines in
ultrasound and GGOs in CT [49]) and concluded a high
potential for ultrasound in evaluating early lung patients,
especially to guide subsequent testing in triage situations.
Others reported concordance between US and chest recordings in 7/8 monitored adolescents with COVID-19, while
the last patient had a normal radiography despite irregular
US [22]. For a review on the timeline of US findings in
relation to CT see [50].

manually to remove artifacts and checked by a medical
doctor for its quality.
2. We trained a convolutional neural network (that we dub
POCOVID-Net) on the available data and evaluated it
in 5-fold cross validation. We report a classification
accuracy of 89% and a sensitivity to detect COVID19 of 96%. The model demonstrates the diagnostic
value of the collected data and the applicability of deep
learning for US images.
3. We offer a free web service that first promotes clinical
data collection by giving users the possibility to upload
data, and secondly provides an interface to our trained
model.

Data collection initiatives. Perhaps the most significant

initiative is from Cohen et. al. [51] who started building an
open-access database of X-ray (now also CT images) that,
to date, contains ∼150 COVID-19 images: Using deep
convolutional neural networks, many have claimed strong
performances on the X-ray data of Cohen et al, ranging
from 91% up to 98% [52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58]. Besides that, the COVID-Net open source initiative presented
the COVIDx dataset of chest radiography (X-ray) data [33]
that was assembled from [51] and other sources, resulting
in 183 COVID-19 images across a total of 13k samples.
While the authors report 92 % accuracy [33], others reported higher numbers with more refined models [59, 60].
Regarding CT imaging, [61] published a database of 275
COVID-19 CT scans and reported an accuracy of 85%. In
light of these seemingly convincing performances, it needs
to be emphasized that these databases still contain rather
limited number of samples with suboptimal quality. [62]
review 13 models proposed for the detection of COVID-19
on CT scans, and conclude that most are at high risk of
bias due to qualitative and quantitative pitfalls in their data.
Since at the same time the amount of proprietary samples
is rising quickly, we encourage all responsible hospitals
and decision makers to contribute their data to open-access
initiatives.

Chest X-Ray. Although chest X-rays were traditionally
heavily used for diagnosing lung conditions, they are not
well suited to detect COVID-19 at early stages [34], for
example [11] found that 89% of 493 COVID-19 patients
had normal or only mildly abnormal X-ray scans. Instead,
it is a reliable tool to evidence bilateral multifocal consolidation, partially fused into massive consolidation with
small pleural effusions and "white lung”[35]. However,
multiple studies demonstrated the superiority of ultrasound
imaging in detecting pneumonia and related lung conditions [9, 18, 36, 37].
Computed tomography (CT). CT presents a more viable technique for early COVID-19 detection and has been
the most promoted screening tool so far [38, 39]. Reviews
report high detection rates among symptomatic individuals [38, 40], as CT can unveil air space consolidation,
traction bronchiectasis, paving appearance and bronchovascular thickening [41, 42]. Also, (multifocal) ground glass
opacities (GGO) were observed especially frequently, often bilateral and with consolidations and prominent peripherally subpleaural distribution [43]. GGO are zones
of increased attenuation that usually appear in several interstitial and alveolar processes with conservation of the
bronchial and vascular margins [44]. However, CT involves evident practical downsides such as exposing the
patient to excessive radiation, high cost, the availability
of sophisticated equipment (only ∼30,000 machines exist
globally [45]), the need for extensive sterilization [46, 8]
and patient mobilisation.

Reports on propriertary data. Further preprints gathered their CT data independently and reported accuracy
between 80% and 90% on 400-2700 slices [63, 64, 65] or
even accuracy up to 95% on ∼2000 or more slices [66,
67, 68]. Apart from simple classification models, also segmentation technique were employed to identify infected

notes on the visible patterns in each video (e.g. B-Lines
or consolidations) were added. They confirm that in all
collected videos of COVID-19 and pneumonia diseasespecific patterns are visible. However, in order to train a
machine learning model, a larger dataset of images instead
of videos was required.
Data processing. Since the 64 videos were taken from
various sources, the format and illumination differ significantly. In order to generate a diverse and still sufficiently
large data set, images were selected from the videos with
a frame rate of 3Hz and a maximum of 30 frames per
video. This resulted in an average of 17±6 frames per
video and a total of 1103 images (654 COVID-19, 277
bacterial pneumonia, 172 healthy). To homogenize the
dataset, we cropped the images with a quadratic window
excluding measure bars and texts visible on the sides or top
of the videos. Five videos were manually processed with
Adobe After Effect in order to remove measure scales
and other artifacts that were overlaying the US recording.
Examples of the cropped images are shown in Figure 1.
We are however aware that the heterogeneity of the data is
still problematic, and we are constantly searching for more
data to prevent the model from over fitting on the specific
properties of the available recordings.

3 A lung US dataset for COVID-19 detection

We assembled and pre-processed a dataset of a total of 64
lung POCUS video recordings, divided into 39 videos of
COVID-19, 14 videos of (typical bacterial) pneumonia and
11 videos of healthy patients. Note that despite the novelty
of the disease, COVID-19 images account for 60% of our
dataset. So far, we have restricted ourselves to convex
utrasound probes. Linear and convex probes are the most
standard ones in medical services, and we are focusing
on the latter because more data was available. The linear
probe is a higher frequency probe and gives better resolution images, but with less tissue penetration and therefore
more superficial images. The convex probe is more suitable for deep organs (abdomen, fetal ultrasound, etc.) or
in obese patients. Usually, linear probes are preferred for
lung ultrasound, but in practice, most medical facilities

across folds. Nevertheless, the ROC-AUC score of COVID19 detection is 0.94. Figure 2 also depicts where the accuracy is maximal for each class. It can be observed that
the rate of false positives at the maximal-accuracy point
is larger for COVID-19 than for pneumonia and healthy
patients. In a clinical setting where false positives are less
problematic than false negatives, this property is desired.

pneumonia can be distinguished best with a sensitivity of
93% and precision of 95%. Note that only three frames of
pneumonia were classified as healthy patients, showing at the very least - the model’s ability to recognize strong
irregularities in lung images. Nevertheless, it is clear that
further work is necessary to improve the false negative
rate of COVID-19, as 75 images are classified as healthy
lungs. We believe that a main reason for that is the low
number of lung POCUS recordings of healthy subjects
compared to the number of COVID-19 images. Thus,
model performance might be improved significantly with
more data being collected, for example in the form of
collaborations with ultrasound companies or hospitals.

Adam [73] with an initial learning rate of 1e−4.
Furthermore, we use data augmentation techniques
to diversify the dataset. In explanation, the Keras
ImageDataGenerator is used, which applies a series of
random transformations on each image when generating a
batch (in-place augmentation). Here, we allow transformations of the following types: Rotations of up to 10 degrees,
horizontal and vertical flips, and shifts of up to 10% of the
image height or width respectively. As such transformations can naturally occur with diverse ultrasound devices
and recording parameters, augmentation adds valuable and
realistic diversity that helps to prevent overfitting.

To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model,
we compare the results to the performance of a model
called COVID-Net that has recently been proposed for the
classification of X-Ray images [33]. Training COVID-Net
on our data, it achieves an accuracy of 81% (averaged
across all folds), whereas our model has 89% accuracy.
Factoring in the balanced accuracy score over the three
classes (82% vs 63%), POCOVID-Net clearly outperforms
COVID-Net. Apart from the COVID-Net model, we also
tested an architecture following [32] on our data. The authors employ Res-Net [74] instead of VGG-16. In our experiments we observed that using Res-Net or NasNet [75]

summarized the frame-wise scores to determine the video
class, employing two different methods: First, a majority
vote of the predicted classes was taken, and secondly
we average the class probabilities as predicted by the
network, and then select the class with the highest average
probability. Both methods achieved the same accuracy of
92% videos that were correctly classified, and a balanced
video accuracy of 84%.

The dataset and proposed model constitute a very preliminary first step toward the detection of COVID-19 from ultrasound data. Envisioning an interface that simplifies data
sharing processes for medical practitioners thus attempting to foster collaborations with data scientists in order to
serve the global need for rapid development of tools to alleviate the COVID-19 crisis, we have decided to build a web
platform accessible at: https://pocovidscreen.org.
The platform (see preview in Figure 4) is open-access and
was designed for two purposes: First, users can contribute
to the open-access dataset by uploading their US recordings (i.e. images or videos from COVID-19, pneumonia
or healthy controls). The collected lung ultrasound data
will be continuously reviewed and approved by medical
doctors, carefully processed and then integrated into our
database on GitHub. This strategy is chosen in order to
simplify the data sharing process as much as possible. Secondly, users can access our trained model to perform a
rapid screening of their own (unlabeled) data. Best performance is to be expected if the image is cropped to a

In summary, POCOVID-Net is able to learn frame-wise classification into COVID-19, pneumonia and healthy, where
sensitivity for COVID-19 is already very high at 96%. It
was demonstrated that the proposed architecture outperforms COVID-Net, and aggregating the frame-wise predictions into video classification yields a general classification
performance of 92% accuracy. Last, it was argued that further work is required to reduce the number of false positive

detection of COVID-19 is a promising future endeavour.
Despite these encouraging results, readers are reminded
that we have presented very preliminary results herein and
that we do not claim any diagnostic performance. We also
do not consider the detection on US data as a replacement
for other test methods and neither as an alternative to
extensive training of doctors in the usage of ultrasound for
the detection task.
Last, with the presented web service we provide an interface that makes our model publicly available to researchers
and hospitals around the world. Most importantly, this
interface resembles a user-friendly way to contribute lung
ultrasound data to our open-access initiative.

can upload images or videos to contribute to the dataset, or test
the model POCOVID-Net on their own images.

quadratic section of the relevant part, similarly to our data.
Subsequently, the prediction is performed by evaluating
all five models trained during cross validation. The output
scores are averaged and the predicted class, in conjunction
with a probability, is displayed to the user.

Conclusion
We believe that POCUS can provide a quick, easy and lowcost method to assess the possibility of a SARS-CoV-2
infection. We hope to have opened a branch for automatic
detection of COVID-19 from ultrasound data and envision
our method as a first step toward an auxiliary tool that can
assist medical doctors. In case of a positive first-line examination, further testing is required for corroboration (e.g.
CT scan or RT-PCR). Lung ultrasound may not only take
a key role in disease diagnosis, but can be utilized to monitor disease evolution through regular checks performed
non-invasively and without the need of relocation.

In short, we hope that this tool can serve as a starting point
which will lead to the development of better prediction
models. Our web-service facilitates the process of data
collection thus transforming the task into a community
effort. Additionally it gives users the opportunity to use
our model to infer the class of their own data, so far of
course with a preliminary model whose outputs should not
be considered of any clinical significance.

Regarding the patient journey, we envision POCOVID-Net
as a preliminary test for random screening and a step toward a complementary test to PCR for COVID-19 suspicions. If a patient is suspected of COVID-19, POCUS
could be used to assess the presence of lung lesion that
might not have clinical repercussions and thus help detecting people at risk of lung complications which would
allow to focus in a more dedicated manner on high-risk
patients. For random screening, if POCOVID-Net identifies
the patient with COVID-19 lung symptoms, further tests
such as RT-PCR, CT-scan and medical check-up should
be conducted. As POCUS devices are easily transportable,
this test could take place in a primary care center where a
physician or technical specialist can go to perform several
screenings and avoid contamination in hospitals. It should
be noted that with one device, it is possible to perform 4
to 5 lung screenings per hour, taking into account the time
needed for installation and cleaning.

6 Discussion
In the current global pandemic, it is as relevant as hardly
ever before that the research community pools its expertise
to provide solutions in the near future. Our contribution
is the exploration of automatizing COVID-19 detection
from lung ultrasound imaging in order to provide a quick
assessment of the possibility of a person to be infected
with COVID-19.

Summary Our first step towards this goal is to release a collection of POCUS images and videos, that
were gathered and pre-processed from the referenced
sources. The videos are reliably labeled and can be
split to generate a dataset of more than a thousand images. We would like to invite researchers to contribute
to our database, e.g by pointing to new publications or

the video classification based on a frame-based majority
vote improved the error rate by more than 25% (from 89%
to 92% accuracy). Secondly, the benefit of pre-training
the network on large image databases could be improved
by training the model on (non lung) ultrasound samples
instead of using ImageNet, a database of real life objects.
This pre-training may help detecting ultrasound specific
patterns such as B-Lines. In addition, to exploit the higher
availability of CT or X-ray scans, transfer learning strategies could be adopted as in [76, 77]. Furthermore, generative models could help to complement the scarce data
about COVID-19 as recently proposed in [78].

We aim to extend the functionality of the website in the
future, to further encourage the community effort of researchers, doctors and companies to build a dataset of
POCUS images that can leverage the predictive power of
automatic detection systems, and thereby also the value
of ultrasound imaging for COVID-19 in general. If the
approach turns out to be successful, we plan to build an
app as suggested in [79] that can enable medical doctors to
draw inference from their ultrasound images with unprecedented ease, convenience and speed.
