Abstract: Recent study reported that an aerosolised virus (COVID-19) can survive in the air
for a few hours. It is highly possible that people get infected with the disease by breathing and
contact with items contaminated by the aerosolised virus. However, the aerosolised virus
transmission and trajectories in various meteorological environments remain unclear. This
paper has investigated the movement of aerosolised viruses from a high concentration source
across a dense urban area. The case study looks at the highly air polluted areas of London:
University College Hospital (UCH) and King’s Cross and St Pancras International Station
(KCSPI). We explored the spread and decay of COVID-19 released from the hospital and
railway stations with the prescribed meteorological conditions. The study has three key
findings: the primary result is that it is possible for the virus to travel from meters up to
hundred meters from the source location. The secondary finding shows viruses released into
the atmosphere from entry and exit points at KCSPI remain trapped within a small radial
distance of < 50m. This strengthens the case for the use of face coverings to reduce the
infection rate. The final finding shows that there are different levels of risk at various door
locations for UCH, depending on which door is used there can be a higher concentration of
COVID-19. Although our results are based on London, since the fundamental knowledge
processes are the same, our study can be further extended to other locations (especially the
highly air polluted areas) in the world.

1. Introduction

1

The earliest confirmed case of COVID-19 was in December 2019 and has since become a
global pandemic with over 93,688,066 confirmed cases and 2,005,773 deaths worldwide as of
January 14, 2021 (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/).
Existing studies showed that the virus is mostly spread through breathing, coughing and
sneezing (Chakraborty and Maity 2020; Howard et al., 2020), and direct contact with
unsterilised abiotic surfaces such as plastics and stainless steel (where the virus can remain
infectious for 28 days, https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-54500673). Social distancing in the
range 1 ~ 2.5 meters has been recommended to mitigate this situation (Blocken et al. 2020;
Wei and Li, 2015). However, there is evidence that the virus can remain in the air for more
prolonged periods of time (remaining infectious for over 3 hours after expulsion, van
Doremalen et al. 2020; Setti et al. 2020), travelling further contained within aerosols suspended
in the air (Li et al., 2020). Studies have found that similar particles containing viral matter can
travel up to ten meters, suggesting that the recommended social distancing may be insufficient
(Morawska and Cao, 2020). A higher rate of mortality is also linked with an increased
concentration of particulate matter (PM, Wu et al. 2020) and the number of COVID-19 cases
has been linked with the level of PM in Italy and France (Kowalski and Konior, 2020).
Prior research on the effect of aerosols in transmitting the virus, suggest measures like
better ventilation to keep the aerosols outside of buildings, keeping those within safe
(Morawksa and Cao, 2020) but few have considered the effect of aerosols on outdoor
transmission over longer distances, partly because there are no simple methods to collect data,
and therefore a lack of data to analyse (Carducci et al., 2020).
The aim of this computational study is to tackle the aforementioned issues with the
computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model Fluidity, developed by Imperial College. Fluidity
is an open source Large Eddy Simulation (LES) model with an advanced adaptive mesh
capability (https://github.com/fluidityproject). This study investigates the effect of the

2

exponential decay of the virus and the complexity of the spreading phenomenon: how long can
the virus spread for given certain meteorological conditions? We will explore these in two
different locations in London: University College Hospital (UCH); King’s Cross Station and
St Pancras International (KCSPI). This study will explore the spread of this virus from
hospitals and railway stations, and the impact of meteorological conditions on a virus. Our aim
is to explore the impact of the aerosol transport of the virus under specific meteorological
conditions and highlight the importance of treating the pandemic seriously. Although our study
is based on London, it can be extended to other locations (especially the highly air polluted
areas) in the world since all the fundamental knowledge processes are the same.
2. Methodology
2.1. Governing equations in virus spreading simulations
The three-dimensional (3D) Navier-Stokes equations and generic atmospheric chemical
transport (advection-diffusion) equation are utilized for COVID-19 spreading simulations. The
3D Navier-Stokes equations are written as:
u
1
+ u u = − p + Su +  2u
t


where u = ( u, v, w ) is the velocity vector, t is the time,  =
T

(1)



i + j + k , ρ is the
x y
z

(assumed uniform) density of the atmosphere, Su represents the source, absorption or the drag
forcing term of velocity (e.g. there is an absorption term when the flow passes the trees) and

 represents the dynamic viscosity.
The virus transport equation is:

C
+   ( uC ) −   (C ) = S + D
t

3

(2)

where C is the mass concentration of the virus,  is the tensor of turbulent diffusivity, S
represents the source term of virus, and D is the decay of virus.
The virus exponential decay formulation (van Doremalen et al, 2020) is given as follows:

C = C0  e − t

(3)

where C0 is the initial virus concentration, λ denotes the decay rate. The decay term in
Equation (2) can thus expressed as D = −C . Studies have shown that the decay of airborne
viruses is sensitive to the metrological conditions (wind velocity, ambient humidity and
temperature (Yang and Marr, 2012; Schuit et al. 2020; Chan et al. 2011). In this work, to ensure
stability and suppress spurious oscillations, the control volume (CV) method is used for
resolving the virus concentration. To avoid spurious oscillations, the CV–TVD (control volume
– total variation diminishing) limiter is used to make the solutions total variation diminishing.
For control volume discretization, an explicit scheme is simple but strictly limited by the CFL
number, which can be restrictive on adaptive meshes as the minimum mesh size can be very
small. Here, we adopt a new time stepping scheme based on traditional Crank–Nicolson
scheme because of its robustness, unconditional stability and second-order accurate in time.
2.2. Meteorological boundary conditions
The Synthetic-Eddy Method (Pavlidis et al. 2010) is used to set up the inlet boundary
condition:
U in ( x, t ) = U in ( x ) + uin ( x, t ) ,Vin ( x, t ) = Win ( x, t ) = 0

(4)

where x = ( x, y, z ) are the spatial coordinates, t is the time, U in ( x, t ) , Vin ( x, t ) , Win ( x, t ) are the
velocity components at the inlet along the x, y, z directions, respectively, the mean velocity

U in ( x ) is the function of the vertical z coordinate obeying the standard log-law over roughness
height z0:

4

z  z0
0,

U in ( z ) =  u*  z 
  ln  z  , z  z0
   0

(5)

where u* is the friction velocity,  is von Karnman constant, uin ( x, t ) is the fluctuating
velocity. The calculation of the fluctuating component requires the turbulence length-scale,
Reynolds stresses, as well as a number of coherent structures (known as turbulent spots) (for
details, see Aristodemou et al., 2018).
2.3. A dynamically adaptive mesh model for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and virus
spreading simulations
Fluidity is a computational fluid dynamics code capable of numerically solving the NavierStokes Equation (1) with the large eddy simulation (LES) and accompanying field equations
shown in Equation (2) on arbitrary unstructured meshes (For details, see (AMCG, 2014; Zheng
et al., 2015, 2020). The key feature of Fluidity is the use of anisotropic adaptive mesh
techniques. The mesh is adapted to optimally resolve the multi-scale flow dynamics in full 3D
as the flow evolves in space and time.
Once viruses are emitted into the air, the dynamic and transmission processes involve a
wide range of spatial scales. An artificial dilution of viruses may lead to a shorter lifetime in
existing fixed grid models if the resolution of grids is not high enough. It has been proved
(Zheng et al., 2015, 2020) that mesh adaptivity is the most efficient and effective approach for
resolving multi-scale dynamic processes. The mesh is adapted with respect to the dynamic flow
features and virus concentrations in time and space. Using the adaptive mesh, the detailed flow
dynamics and the temporal and spatial evolution of COVID-19 viruses during the spreading
process can be captured, especially the local turbulent flows around buildings.
3. Case Study

3.1. Modelling setup
•

Study area: University College Hospital (UCH) and King’s Cross and St Pancras
International Station (KCSPI) on the Euston road in the center of London, is close to
significant traffic along Euston road resulting in high pollution levels around that area. The
computational area is a rectangular 2 km * 1.5 km domain centered on UCH, and 1000 m
high to capture the dynamic part of the atmospheric boundary layer. As shown in Figure
1, the computational domain includes many buildings of different heights and
configurations.

Figure 1. Study location and geometry in the center of London.

•

Wind field: In March in London, the wind direction is mostly from the southwest, and a
typical mean wind speed of approximately 5.23 m/s at 10 m above the ground (see
https://weatherspark.com/m/45061/3/Average-Weather-in-March-in-City-of-LondonUnited-Kingdom).

•

COVID-19 virus lifetime: The exponential lifetime of the virus is assumed to be 3 hours
(van Doremalen, 2020).

•

Source release locations and concentrations: The locations of virus sources at UCH are
chosen at the entries in Doors 1 ~ 4, shown in Figure 2 (a)-(c). It was reported that the
concentration of COVID-19 ranged from 0 ~ 113 copies/m3 in different locations in Wuhan
city (Liu et al. 2020). In this study, the range of the virus concentration is set to 3 ~ 50
copies/m3 in the source locations (see Figure 2 (e) and (f)). The residue of viable viruses
at the source locations is associated with the meteorological conditions (Frontera et al.,
2020, Liu et al. 2020, Sahin, 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Briz-Redón and Serrano-Aroca,
2020).

•

Adaptive mesh resolutions: The use of dynamically adaptive meshes optimizes the
computational effort to resolve the flow dynamic and virus transport processes over a wide
range of spatial scales. In this study, the mesh is dynamically adapted with respect to both
the wind velocity field and virus concentration. The a-priori error measure for adapting the
mesh is 0.3 m/s for velocity solutions and the relative error measure is 0.01 for virus
concentration. The maximum number of nodes is set to be 600,000, which is large enough
to ensure the a-priori error to be achieved. To avoid spurious dilution of virus emission,
high resolution meshes are located around the sources (see Figure 2 (f)-(g)).

•

Boundary and initial conditions: At the inlet boundary, the velocity profile is given by
Equation (4). Open boundary conditions (stress-free boundary conditions) are specified at

7

the outlet. No-slip boundary conditions are provided in the top, bottom and side
boundaries. The CFD simulation starts from the ‘static’ state.

Figure 2. Release location of viruses in (a), (b), (c) Doors 1 ~ 4 in UCH, (d) the St Pancras
International, (e) King’s Cross stations, as well as the corresponding adaptive meshes
around the source locations (f) UCH and (g) railway stations.

3.2. Results and discussions
In this discussion we will focus on (1) the spatial distribution of viruses released from
UCH and KCSPI for given wind field; (2) the release locations of viruses in hospital; (3) the
distance of virus transmission.
Wind field and spatial distribution of viruses: The wind velocity solution from the CFD
simulations is shown in Figure 3. We can observe how turbulent flows are developed around
higher buildings – for example, at the HM Revenue & Customs in Figure 3 (at the intersection
between A501 and A400), the wind speed can reach 4 m/s, also reaching 2.5 m/s around the
UCH building (both measurements taken at a height of 2 m). If the virus is emitted from UCH,
it can build up around the corner between Euston road and North Gower street. Euston road
has high levels of congestion, leading to high pollution levels (over 22 µg/m3) (see the
8

https://www.londonair.org.uk), the aerosol present there could transmit the disease. The
increased wind speed can carry the aerosolized virus along East Euston road and North Gower
street, reaching Euston Square Gardens up to KCSPI. This demonstrates how the viruses
emitted from UCH can infect neighboring communities – the area around University College
London (UCL), and the commuters passing through Euston road and Gower street to list a few.

Figure 3. Top panel: (a) Contour map of the mean velocity field (unit: m/s) at the height of
5 m in the whole computational domain; Bottom panel: Zoom of the mean velocity field at
the height of 5 m around (b) UCH, and (c) rail stations.

Spatial distribution of viruses: We have plotted the virus contour maps in Figures 4-7.
From these, we can see that the concentration of viruses decreases rapidly by a factor of 2 ~ 3
near the sources. Relatively higher concentrations of the virus (0.3 ~ 10 copies/m3) can be found
around UCH, Gower road, A400, Gower P1 and all the way up to Euston Square Gardens.
Further downwind past the Euston Square Gardens – places like the British library, St Pancras
International and King’s Cross stations, the concentration is much lower, in the range of 0.1 ~
0.2 copies/m3, roughly 0.1% of the concentration found in the immediate vicinity of UCH.
From the contour maps, we can observe that the majority of the viruses remain trapped within
a short radial distance of under 50 meters along St. Pancras Road, past that, the concentration

9

rapidly diluted to under 0.1 copies/m3. Concentrations around 0.1 copies/m3 are found within
250 meters away from UCH. This can be attributed to the weaker wind field of around 0.5 m/s
around the railway stations compared to the stronger wind field near UCH at 0.5 ~ 3 m/s.

viruses at the height of 2 m, where the color bar represents the value of the virus
concentration (unit: copies/m3).

released from (a) UCH, (b) the St Pancras International, and (c) King’s Cross station where
the color bar represents the value of the virus concentration (unit: copies/m3).

Release location of viruses: We have experimented with test cases that have many different
release locations (Doors 1 ~ 4, see Figure 2) at UCH with the spatial distribution of viruses
released from the doors shown in Figure 7. It should be noted that the infectious area (see the
green area representing the iso-surface of 0.1 copies/m3) of the virus emitted at Door 2 is larger
than those of other doors. The virus released from Door 1 is directly transported to Euston road
whilst those released from Door 2 are blown down Grafton way, splits between going down
Huntley street and staying in Grafton way, some of the latter merges with the viruses from
Door 4 and with Door 3’s at A400, from which it moves continuously to Euston road. The
infectious area of the virus emitted from Doors 1 and 2 mostly focuses on Wolfson Institute on
Grafton way, UCL along A400, while the virus emitted from Doors 1 and 3 mainly infects the
commuters passing through Euston road and Euston square station to list a few.

concentration.

4. Conclusions
Our findings suggest that the aerosolised virus particles can be transmitted a long distance
(hundreds of meters) due to the fully developed turbulent flows around the source locations.
For example, around the UCH, there is a strong wind field (~ 2.5 m/s) at the height of 5 m and
viruses with the concentration of > 0.2 copies/m3 can be found within 60 ~ 500 m away from
UCH for given meteorological conditions (e.g. wind field). We also notice that the infectious
12

area from the virus released from Door 2 in UCH is larger than the other doors. This suggests
that Door 2 in UCH is not a good location for A & E; the entry location in hospital must be
chosen carefully. Our study found that the majority of the viruses released from the St Pancras
International and King’s Cross stations remain trapped within a short radical distance of less
than 50 meters and will not affect the people living nearby. In summary, it is suggested that a
face cover is needed for personal protection if people travel to public dense places (hospital,
train stations etc.). Finally, the impact of urban green (tree, for example) environment on
reducing the virus spreading will be further investigated in our future work.
