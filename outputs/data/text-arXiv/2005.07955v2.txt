Abstract
Virtual screening of phytochemicals was performed through molecular docking,
simulation, in silico ADMET and drug-likeness prediction to identify the potential hits that can
inhibit the effects of SARS-CoV-2. Considering the published literature on medicinal
importance, total 154 phytochemicals with analogous structure from limonoids and triterpenoids
were selected to search potential inhibitors for the five therapeutic protein targets of SARS-CoV2, i.e., 3CLpro (main protease), PLpro (papain-like protease), SGp-RBD (spike glycoproteinreceptor binding domain), RdRp (RNA dependent RNA polymerase) and ACE2 (angiotensinconverting enzyme 2). The in silico computational results revealed that the phytochemicals such
as glycyrrhizic acid, limonin, 7-deacetyl-7-benzoylgedunin, maslinic acid, corosolic acid,
obacunone and ursolic acid were found to be effective against the target proteins of SARS-CoV2. The protein-ligand interaction study revealed that these phytochemicals bind with the amino
acid residues at the active site of the target proteins. Therefore, the core structure of these
potential hits can be used for further lead optimization to design drugs for SARS-CoV-2. Also,
the medicinal plants containing these phytochemicals like licorice, neem, tulsi, citrus and olives
can be used to formulate suitable therapeutic approaches in traditional medicines.

1. Introduction
There is extensive ongoing research globally to formulate suitable therapeutic approaches
to control the effects of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to
human life that caused the disease COVID-19. The first patient infected with SARS-CoV-2 was
detected in December, 2019 at Wuhan, China [1]. Subsequently, the virus spread across 187
countries and territories due to its high human to human contagious nature and infected
10710005 as of 3rd July 2020 with a total death of 517877 [2]. The World Health Organization
(WHO) declared the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 as a public health emergency of international
concern (PHEIC) on 30th Jan 2020, and a pandemic on 11th March 2020 [3]. The non-availability
of medically proven efficacious drugs or vaccines is the main concern of COVID-19 pandemic
[4]. Therefore, effective steps to identify the infected persons through rapid diagnosis followed
by quarantined them to stop the further spread of the virus are underway to fight against this
pandemic. In addition, the FDA-approved drugs like hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, favipiravir,
arbidol, hydroxychloroquine/azithromycin, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir combined
with interferon beta etc. are repurposed, but despite some promising results further clinical
studies are required to examine their mechanisms of inhibition, efficacy and safety in the
treatment of COVID-19 [5-9]. Therefore, both the computational and experimental approaches
are adopted to search suitable drugs from the library of FDA-approved drugs and also drugs
under clinical trial but not yet repurposed against COVID-19. Simultaneously, some recent
reports supporting the use of traditional medicines as an adjuvant for the treatment of COVID-19
[10-12] and therefore, efforts are also going to integrate the use of both western drugs and
traditional medicines for formulating suitable therapeutic strategies.
The computational approaches like molecular dynamic simulations, molecular docking,
drugs-likeness prediction, in silico ADMET study etc. are adopted mainly to screen potential
2

drugs/molecules from various databases/libraries. The computational screening saves the
experimental cost and time in the field of drug discovery. Considering the recent results of the
use of traditional medicines in managing the COVID-19 epidemic [10-12], the current
research work was carried out to screen phytochemicals found mainly in the Indian medicinal
plants with the important objectives: (i) to search phytochemicals that bind effectively at the
active sites of the therapeutic protein targets of SARS-CoV-2, (ii) to propose important hits
that can be further investigated for lead optimization and drug discovery, and (iii) to provide
computational evidences for formulating traditional medicines against SARS-CoV-2.
Our literature survey revealed that the triterpenoids like 3Œ≤-friedelanol from Euphorbia
neriifolia, quinone-methide triterpenoids extracted from Tripterygium regelii (Celastraceae) and
glycyrrhizin from Glycyrrhiza glabra are experimentally proven to inhibit the effects of SARSCoV (first identified in Guangdong, China in 2002) [13-16]. Also, our recent molecular docking
studies of phytochemicals against the therapeutic protein targets of SARS-CoV-2 supported the
effective binding affinity towards limonin, a triterpenoid found in citrus [17]. The highest level
of genomic similarity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 [18], and the effectiveness of
triterpenoids against SARS-CoV prompted us to search potential phytochemicals from limonoids
and triterpenoids. In this manuscript, total 154 phytochemicals from limonoids and triterpenoids
were selected by considering their known medicinal importance to search potential hits for the
five therapeutic protein targets of SARS-CoV-2 i.e., 3CLpro (main protease), PLpro (papain-like
protease), SGp-RBD (spike glycoprotein-receptor binding domain), RdRp (RNA dependent
RNA polymerase) and ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2). The phytochemicals were
screened through in silico molecular docking, simulation, ADMET and drugs-likeness prediction
to propose the potential hits against SARS-CoV-2.

2. Experimental
2.1. Compounds and proteins selection
The 154 biologically important phytochemicals from limonoids and triterpenoids were
first selected based on their reported medicinal properties. The structures of the phytochemicals
were collected from various sources and screened to filter the potential compounds that can
inhibit the effects of SARS-CoV-2. The SDF files of the selected phytochemicals were retrieved
from

EMBL-EBI

(www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/advancedSearchFT.do)

and

PUBCHEM

(https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). The collected structures of the phytochemicals were further
optimized by semi-empirical PM6 method coded in the computational program Gaussian 09W
[19]. The optimized structures were converted to the PDB file format by using the program
GaussView 5.0. The crystallography structures of the SARS-CoV-2 protein targets (3CLpro,
PDB ID: 6LU7; PLpro, PDB ID: 4MM3; RdRp, PDB ID: 6M71; SGp-RDB, PDB ID: 2GHV;
ACE2, PDB ID: 6M17) were retrieved from the PDB database (www.rcsb.org).
2.2. Molecular docking and simulations
The molecular docking studies were carried out to estimate the binding energies of the
phytochemicals towards the therapeutic protein targets of SARS-CoV-2 by using Autodock Vina
1.1.2 [20]. The proteins 3D structures retrieved from RCSB PDB databases were modelled using
Swiss-model online server to generate the fine structures. The missing amino acid residues (5168, 102-110, 122-127, 895-904) were found in the crystal structure of the RdRp protein (PDB
ID: 6M71). The refined protein structures were analysed by using the Ramachandran plot (Fig.
S1-S5). The PDB files of the phytochemicals and proteins were converted into PDBQT files by
using AutoDock tools. The grid box dimensions and the grid map coordinates centre for the
random and site specific docking for each protein were summarized in Table S1. All docking

4

were performed with Lamarckian genetic algorithm (LGA). The docked structures were analysed
by using the BIOVIA Discovery studio visualization tool.
The protein structure flexibility and dynamics simulations were performed using the
CABSflex2.0 online simulation tool with the default options [21]. The simulated model
generated through trajectory clustering k-medoid method. This tool calculates the protein
dynamic simulations at 10 ns, predicts fluctuations and protein aggregation propensity. The rootmean-square fluctuation (RMSF) is generated based on the MD trajectory or NMR ensemble.
The RMSF of a residue fluctuation profile can be calculated with the following formula:
RMSF =

(x (ùëó)‚àí< x >)

Where, x is the residue position (CŒ± atom) i in the trajectory or NMR ensemble model j
and < > denotes the average over the whole trajectory or NMR ensemble. In CABS-flex, the
statistical errors of RMSF values are reflected in root mean squared deviations (RMSD) between
RMSF profile data. CABS-flex tool detects the unusual dynamic behaviour of the secondary
structure of the protein, the higher RMSF or fluctuations during the simulation indicates the
greater flexibility.
2.3. ADMET and drug-likeness prediction
After the molecular docking studies of 154 phytochemicals with the five protein targets
of SARS-CoV-2, the absorption, distribution, metabolism, elimination and toxicity (ADMET) of
the

properties. ADMET properties include absorption: Caco-2 permeability, water solubility, human
intestinal absorption, P-glycoprotein substrate, P-glycoprotein I and II inhibitors, skin
permeability; distribution: VDss (volume of distribution), fraction unbound, blood brain barrier

chronic toxicity, hepatotoxicity, skin sensitization, hERG I and II inhibitors [22].
Drug-likeness properties were predicted using the online tool molinspiration
(https://www.molinspiration.com/cgi-bin/properties). Providing SMILES inputs of selected
compounds into the tool calculated the LogP values to predict the molecular properties and
bioavailability scores resulting in the drug-likeness of the compound. Based on drug-likeness and
bioavailability capabilities, the potential compounds were finalized for further protein-ligand
interaction study. The calculations of LogP are based on the formula satisfying lipophilicity,
hydrophobicity and polarity of the compound explains the ability of molecules that could bind to
hydrophobic sites of target proteins [23].
Lipophilicity = Hydrophobicity ‚Äì Polarity
LogP = aV +  å

(V = Molecular volume,  å = Polarity term)

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Selection of the phytochemicals
Our recent molecular docking study on searching inhibitors for COVID-19 revealed that
the phytochemicals limonin known for inhibiting the replication of retroviruses like HTLV-I and
HIV-1 showed the higher dock score towards the three protein targets (spike glycoprotein, RdRp
and ACE2) of SARS-CoV-2, and comparatively higher than the drug hydroxychloroquine [17].
Limonin, the highly oxygenated triterpenoid dilactone is the first isolated limonoids and till date
more than 300 limonoids are isolated and characterized. The limonoids including the structural
analogous triterpenoids found in medicinal plants, such as citrus, neem, basil and licorice etc.,
6

are reported for various pharmaceutical properties like antiviral, antifungal, antibacterial,
anticancer and antimalarial, and also used routinely in the Indian traditional medicine (ayurveda)
to treat various health problems [24]. The structure of important limonoids and triterpenoids
were first collected from the databases, i.e., EMBL-EBI and PUBCHEM, then a basic
preliminary screening of the phytochemicals were carried out based on the published medicinal
importance. Total 154 phytochemicals were selected, and then studies against the five
therapeutic protein targets (3CLpro, PLpro, SGp-RBD, RdRp and ACE2) of SARS-CoV-2
(Scheme 1).

Scheme 1. Flowchart showing the steps to screen phytochemicals for the COVID-19.
3.2. Molecular docking results
The selected 154 phytochemicals were screened against the five important protein targets,
i.e., Mpro or 3CLpro, PLpro, SGp-RBD, RdRp and ACE2 of SARS-CoV-2 by performing
7

random molecular docking using the Autodock Vina computational program. The study of the
mechanism of action of the SARS-CoV-2 virus for infecting human cells revealed that the
structural spike glycoprotein (S protein) of SARS-CoV-2 interacts with the transmembrane
protein of host cell receptor ACE2 [25,26]. This process also internalizes the virus into the
endosomes, where the conformational changes take place in the spike glycoprotein that allowed
the virus to enter into the human host cell. Thereafter, the RdRp facilitates the viral genome
replication [27]. The 3CLpro and PLpro act as proteases in the process of proteolysis of the viral
polyprotein into functional units [28]. In short, the SGp and ACE2 are collectively involved in
disease establishment and the 3CLpro, PLpro, RdRp involved in translation and replication lead
to virus proliferation in the host cell. Therefore, these five proteins were considered as the
therapeutic protein targets for the molecular docking with the selected 154 phytochemicals.
The dock score of the phytochemicals against each protein is summarized in Table S2.
The table of dock score of 154 phytochemicals against the five target proteins revealed that
majority of the phytochemicals showed dock score higher than -6.5 kcal/mol [29], and
comparably higher dock score than the western drugs hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir and
arbidol studied as a control [30]. As the core part of the structure of all phytochemicals are
similar, the best 20 phytochemicals for each protein that showed higher dock score were selected
for further in silico ADMET and drug-likeness study (Table S3).
3.3. In silico ADMET and drug-likeness results
Some phytochemicals commonly showed higher dock score with multiple protein targets
and therefore, selecting best 20 phytochemicals for each protein target resulted total 47
phytochemicals. The 47 compounds selected based on their higher dock score were screened
further for in silico ADMET and drug-likeness study. Out of 47, only 15 compounds are obeying
the ADMET limitations and drug-likeness LogP values (Table 1). These compounds satisfied
8

the limitations of lipophilicity, hydrophobicity and polarity. The drug-likeness properties are
screened based on miLogP (molinpiration LogP) values and TPSA (topological polar surface
area) [31]. This study helps in screening out the best compound with drug-likeness and polarity
of compound permeable in biological system. The results of ADMET properties and BOILEDEgg model of the 15 phytochemicals are summarized in Table S4 and Table S5. ADMET results
are interpreted based on marginal values compared with resultant value as high caco-2
permeability predicted value >0.90, intestinal absorption less than 30% is considered as poorly
absorbed, human VDss is low if it is below 0.71 L/kg and high value above 2.81L/kg, BBB
permeability logBB > 0.3 considered as it cross BBB and logBB<-1 are poorly distributed. CNS
permeability interpreted through logPS > -2 penetrate CNS and logPS < -3 as unable to
penetrate. T. pyriformis toxicity predicted value > -0.5 ug/L considered as toxic and Minnow
toxicity log LC50< -0.3 considered as high acute toxicity [22]. Most of the potent
phytochemicals finalised are found in the extracts of medicinal plants like neem, basil, licorice,
olives and citrus. These 15 phytochemicals were selected for protein-ligand interaction study to
identify the potential hits that bind at the active sites of the respective protein targets of SARSCoV-2.

3.4. Protein-ligand interaction study
3.4.1. Screening of inhibitors for main protease
The main protease 3CLpro is a cysteine protease containing three domains, i.e., domains
I (8-101 residues) and II (102-184 residues) with antiparallel ÔÅ¢-barrel structure and the domain
III (201-303 residues) with five Œ±-helices linked to the domain II by a long loop (185-200
residues) [48]. The catalytic dyad CYS145 and HIS41, and the residue GLU166 involved in
protein dimerization, substrate cleaving through catalysis present in the cleft between domains ‚Ö†
and ‚Ö°. The enzyme active site consists of 6 subunits (S1-S6), and the active site residues are 140145 and 163-166 amino acids in the domain II. The protein-ligand interaction study revealed that

10

four phytochemicals (7-deacetyl-7-benzoylgedunin, glycyrrhizic acid, limonin and obacunone)
bind with the catalytic dyad of 3CLpro. The dock score of the best pose of the four
phytochemicals and their important molecular interactions at the active site of 3CLpro is
summarized in Table 2. The 7-deacetyl-7-benzoylgedunin binds with higher dock score (-9.1
kca/mol) at the active site followed by the glycyrrhizic acid (-8.7 kca/mol), limonin (-8.7
kca/mol) and obacunone (-7.5 kca/mol).
The docked structure of 7-deacetyl-7-benzoylgedunin binds firmly at the active site of the
3CLpro long loop region of domain ‚Ö° (Fig. 1a-b). The catalytic dyad CYS145 and HIS41
respectively formed Pi-alkyl and Pi-Pi T-shaped interactions. In addition, the higher binding
affinity of 7-deacetyl-7-benzoylgedunin is attributed to the multiple non-covalent interactions
like hydrogen bond, van der Waals (VDW) with other amino acid residues (GLU166, HIS163,
ARG188, ASP187, HIS164, GLY143, SER144, LEU141, ASN142, PHE140, HIS172, LEU167,
PRO168, MET165) at the active site of 3CLpro. The protein structural simulation generated
RMSF graph showing protein residues fluctuation and aggregation (Fig. S6). The fluctuated
residues showing the hydrophobic cavities where substrate binding and the catalytic functions
took place. For 3CLpro simulation, some of the residues fluctuation impact at chain A residues
(5-16, 46-56, 136-151, 165-178, 181-196, 241-260, 271-286), and the fluctuation impact
showing ligand interactions at these residues. Further, the site specific docking of 7-deacetyl-7benzoylgedunin was performed at the active site of 3CLpro and the binding of the three best pose
with a dock score of -9.1, -8.0 and -7.7 kcal/mol is shown in Fig. 1c. In addition to the 7deacetyl-7-benzoylgedunin, the phytochemicals glycyrrhizic acid, limonin and obacunone are
also binding at the active site of 3CLpro (Table 2). The binding pose of the best three
phytochemicals at the active site of 3CLpro is collectively shown in Fig. 1d.

11

It is also important to mention that the phytochemicals ursolic acid and oleanolic acid
isolated from holy basil leaves are effectively binding at the domain III active site residues with
the dock score of -8.9 kcal/mol, which enhanced the catalytic activity of 3CLpro. Both the
phytochemicals bind with 3CLpro by forming hydrogen bonds with the residues LYS137,
LEU272, and the closest non-covalent interactions with the residues THR199, ARG131 and
LEU287.

3.4.2. Screening of inhibitors for PLpro
PLpro consists of four domains such as thumb, finger, palm and ubiquitin like domain.
The active site located in between the thumb and palm domains [49]. The subunits consist of the
catalytic triad (CYS112, HIS273 and ASP287), where the active site of PLpro is located. PLpro
NSP3 domain contains S2/S4 inhibitor binding sites. Therefore, the molecular screening of
phytochemicals that docked at specific residues of S2/S4 site could inhibit the activity of PLpro
[49]. The dock score along with the important molecular interactions of the four phytochemicals
(obacunone, glycyrrhizic acid, ursolic acid and 7-deacetylgedunin) binding with the catalytic
triad at the active site of PLpro are summarized in Table 3. The obacunone (-8.3 kcal/mol) and
glycyrrhizic acid (-8.2 kcal/mol) showed almost similar binding affinity followed by ursolic acid
(-7.2 kcal/mol) at the pocket of the catalytic triad of PLpro [50,51]. In addition, the proteinligand interaction study revealed that the phytochemicals epoxyazadiradione and limonin are
also binding close to the catalytic site of PLpro.
Obacunone binds firmly at the catalytic site of PLpro, and the docked structure is
stabilized by different non-covalent interactions (Fig. 2a-b). The catalytic residues HIS273 and
13

ASP287 of PLpro formed Pi-alkyl and carbon hydrogen bond, respectively. Also, the obacunone
formed hydrogen bond with residue ARG285, VDW contacts with TRP107, THR266, GLY267,
THR275, GLY272, and Pi-alkyl interaction with CYS271. The MD simulations generated the
RMSF plot of PLpro showing available contacts to substrate binding at chain B residues (5-10,
170-185, 265-270) (Fig. S7). Further, the site specific docking of obacunone was performed and
the binding modes of three best pose with dock score -8.3, -7.7 and -7.3 kcal/mol at the catalytic
triad of PLpro is shown in Fig. 2c. It is also important to mention here that the phytochemicals
glycyrrhizic acid, ursolic acid and 7-deacetylgedunin bind with the catalytic residues His273 and
Asp287 of PLpro. The binding modes of the best three phytochemicals at the active site of PLpro
is collectively shown in Fig. 2d.

3.4.3. Screening of inhibitors for RdRp (NSP12 domain)
RdRp, the non-structural protein NSP12 is a replication tool plays a major role in the
transcription cycle of the virus with the help of cofactors NSP7 and NSP8. So, the primary target
of the RdRp is NSP12, where the active site is located in between the NiRAN domain ÔÅ¢-hairpin
[52]. The NTP entry channel is formed by a set of hydrophilic residues such as LYS545,
ARG553, and ARG555. The RdRp active site is located in the tunnel-shaped, where the protein
complex posing strong electrostatic surfaces contains divalent cationic residues 611-626,
especially the residue ASP618. Some of the catalytic residues are located between residues 753769. More than 80 phytochemicals binds at the RdRp functional sites, but only 6 compounds
were finalized based on their high dock score at the active site, in silico ADMET and druglikeness. The interaction details and the binding energy of the 6 phytochemicals at the active site
of RdRp are summarized in Table 4.

15

The best phytochemical glycyrrhizic acid is encapsulated in the receptor cavity with the
maximum binding energy of -9.9 kcal/mol. The binding site is located between NiRAN domain

divalent cationic residue ASP618, hydrogen bond with ARG555, and VDW with LYS545. Also,
the interactions with the catalytic residues, mainly ALA762 makes the glycyrrhizic acid potential
phytochemical against RdRp. The three best binding conformations of glycyrrhizic acid at the
active site of RdRp is shown in Fig. 3c, which clearly indicate that the phytochemical is well
inside the hydrophobic cavity created by the residues at the active site of RdRp. Other
phytochemicals limonin (-8.2 kcal/mol), 7-deacetyl-7-benzoylgedunin (-8.2 kcal/mol) and
limonin glucoside (-8.2 kcal/mol) showed a similar binding affinity at the active site of RdRp.
Limonin (furanolactones), the potent phytochemical docked at the active site between NSP12NSP7 residues formed conventional hydrogen bonds to SER709, LYS714, ASP711, THR710,
TRP800 and TRP617, and VDW interactions with residues PRO620, TYR619, ASP760,
SER814, ASP761, ASP618, GLY616, GLU811, ALA797 and LYS551, including Pi-alkyl/Pi-Pi
contacts with residues CYS622, LYS798 and HIS810 located in RdRp tunnel structure. The
collective binding pose of the three best phytochemicals glycyrrhizic acid, limonin and 7deacetyl-7-benzoylgedunin at the active site of RdRp is shown in Fig. 3d. Further, the MD
simulations generated the RMSF plot of RdRp showing available contacts to chain A: 31-45,

3.4.4. Screening of inhibitors for SGp-RBD
The spike protein determine the virion-host tropism that includes the entry of the virions
into the host cells [54]. The receptor binding domain (RBD) of the trimeric spike glycoprotein
interacts with the human host cells by binding to ACE2. Due to its structural importance, we
focused on SGp-RBD inhibition study by screening 154 phytochemicals through molecular
docking, and the binding confirmations were analysed at the active site that could inhibit the
SGp-ACE2 complex formation. The RBD of the spike glycoprotein contains 333-527 residues
where the active site is located [55]. The protein-ligand interaction study revealed that 6
phytochemicals bind at the active site, and their important molecular interactions are summarized
in Table 5.
Maslinic acid binds firmly at the active site with a binding energy of -9.3 kcal/mol due to
the multiple non-covalent interactions with the residues of SGp-RBD. It forms hydrogen bonds
with ASP454, SER456, GLY464, alkyl/Pi-alkyl interactions with HIS445, PHE460, ARG444,
PRO477, VAL458, PRO466, and VDW contacts with LEU443, ARG441, LYS465 (Fig. 4a-b).
18

The best three binding poses of masnilic acid at the active site of SGp-RBD with a dock score of
-9.3, -8.2 and -7.5 kcal/mol is shown in Fig. 4c, which revealed that this phytochemical bind
with different residues at the active site of SGp-RBD. MD simulation of SpG-RBD generated the
RMSF plot detailing contact sites showing the fluctuations in chain C: 432-438, 352-368, and
456-480 residues of the receptor binding site (Fig. S9). In addition to maslinic acid, the
phytochemicals glycyrrhizic acid, corosolic acid, 2-hydroxyseneganolide and oleanane showed
comparable binding at the active site of SGp-RBD. The binding pose of the best three
phytochemicals at the active site of SGp-RBD is shown in Fig. 4d.

3.4.5. Screening of inhibitors for ACE2
ACE2 plays a key role in cardio renal disease and acts as a human host receptor for the
SARS-CoV-2 [56]. ACE2, a human viral receptor binds to SGp-RBD at a specific site that
establishes the primary contact for host-pathogen interaction [56]. The active site residues of
ACE2 were studied by using site-directed mutagenesis, and it was found that ARG273 plays a
vital role in substrate binding. The HIS345 and HIS505 are catalytic residues plays an important
role as a hydrogen bond donor/acceptor to form the tetrahedral peptide intermediate [57]. Also,
the residues GLN24, MET82, ILE79, LYS31, HIS34, GLU37, GLY354, GLN325, ASP38,
ASN330, GLU329, GLN42 and LEU45 of ACE2 receptor interacts with the SGp-RBD. From
the protein-ligand interaction study, the seven phytochemicals bind at the active site of ACE2
20

and their important molecular interactions are summarized in Table 6. The phytochemicals
glycyrrhizic acid, obacunone, azadiradionolide and gedunin bind firmly at the catalytic site of
ACE2, whereas maslinic acid, epoxyazadiradione and ursolic acid binds at the RBD site of
ACE2.
Glycyrrhizic acid bind firmly at the catalytic site of ACE2 with a dock score of -9.5
kcal/mol. The glycyrrhizic acid interacts to catalytic residues forming hydrogen bonds with
ARG273, HIS374, TYR515, ASN394, and VDW contacts with ARG393, TYR385, GLU402,
ASP350, ALA348, TRP349, ASP382, HIS505, PHE504 (Fig. 5a-b). The three best binding
conformations of glycyrrhizic acid at the catalytic site of ACE2 with the dock score of -9.5, -8.3
and -8.2 kcal/mol is shown in Fig. 5c. In addition to the glycyrrhizic acid, the phytochemicals
obacunone, azadiradionolide and gedunin binds at the catalytic residues ARG273, HIS345 and
HIS505 with a binding energy of -8.1, -8.0 and -7.3 kcal/mol, respectively. The binding pose of
the three best phytochemicals glycyrrhizic acid, obacunone and azadiradionolide at the catalytic
site of ACE2 is shown in Fig. 5d. Further, the MD simulation of ACE2 complex with
glycyrrhizic acid showed multiple contact sites in receptor chain B: 51-81, 141, 201-231, 261,
321-351, 531-561, 591-651 residues (Fig. S10). Out of these residues, the SGp-RBD contacts to
ACE2 receptor residues GLN24, MET82, ILE79, LYS31, HIS34, GLU37, GLY354, GLN325,
ASP38, ASN330, GLU329, GLN42 and LEU45. It is important to mention here that the
phytochemicals maslinic acid, epoxyazadiradione and ursolic acid interact with ACE2 substrate
binding site with the dock score of -8.5, -8.0 and -7.4 kcal/mol, respectively. The binding
conformation of maslinic acid and epoxyazadiradione at the ACE2 substrate binding site is
shown in Fig. 6. The effective binding of glycyrrhizic acid, maslinic acid, obacunone,
epoxyazadiradione, azadiradionolide, ursolic acid and gedunin at the catalytic site and RBD site

prevent the entry of virus into host cells.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we have screened 154 phytochemicals from limonoids and triterpenoids by
molecular docking, in silico ADMET and drug-likeness prediction, and selected 15
phytochemicals to propose the potential hits against the five therapeutic protein targets (3CLpro,
PLpro, RdRp, SpG-RBD and ACE2) of SARS-CoV-2. The phytochemicals 7-deacetyl-7benzoylgedunin, glycyrrhizic acid, limonin and obacunone binds at the catalytic dyad of main
protease 3CLpro. The phytochemicals obacunone, glycyrrhizic acid, ursolic acid and 7deacetylgedunin binds at the catalytic triad of PLpro. Six phytochemicals glycyrrhizic acid,
limonin, 7-deacetyl-7-benzoylgedunin, limonin glucoside, 7-deacetylgedunin and obacunone are
found to bind at the active site of RdRp. The SGp-RBD site is important for the virion-host
tropism, where the phytochemicals maslinic acid, glycyrrhizic acid, corosolic acid, 2hydroxyseneganolide, oleanane and gedunin binds firmly with multiple non-covalent
interactions. For the human ACE2 receptor, seven phytochemicals glycyrrhizinic acid, maslinic
acid, obacunone, epoxyazadiradione, azadiradionolide, ursolic acid and gedunin were found
binding at the catalytic site and/or the RBD site. Based on the dock score and reported medicinal
properties, the combination of seven phytochemicals 7-deacetyl-7-benzoylgedunin, glycyrrhizic
acid, limonin, obacunone, ursolic acid, corosolic acid and masilinic acid is sufficient to formulate
an appropriate therapeutic approach to fight against SARS-CoV-2. The rich source of these
phytochemicals are licorice, citrus, neem, holy basil and olives. Among the seven, the most
24

important phytochemical is glycyrrhizic acid that binds at the active site of all the five protein
targets of SARS-CoV-2. Overall, the computational predictions along with the reported
pharmacological properties postulated that the limonoids and triterpenoids are potential against
SARS-CoV-2 target proteins. The outcomes will be useful in formulating therapeutic strategies
using the traditional medicines as well as the potential hits can be used for lead optimization for
drug discovery for the treatment of COVID-19.
