The growing literature on the propagation of COVID-19 relies on various dynamic SIR-type models (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) which
yield model-dependent results. For transparency and ease of comparing
the results, we introduce a common representation of the SIR-type
stochastic epidemiological models. This representation is a discrete
time transition model, which allows us to classify the epidemiological
models with respect to the number of states (compartments) and their
interpretation. Additionally, the transition model eliminates several
limitations of the deterministic continuous time epidemiological models
which are pointed out in the paper. We also show that all SIR-type
models have a nonlinear (pseudo) state space representation and are
easily estimable from an extended Kalman filter.

Introduction

For almost 100 years following the introductory article of Kermack, McKendrick (1927),
the SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) model has remained the primary tool of analysis
for epidemiological studies and has inspired a considerable number of extensions [see
e.g. Hethcote (2000), Brauer,Castillo-Chavez (2001),Vynnicky et al. (2010), for general
review]. In recent applications to the Coronavirus propagation however, these SIR-type
models tend to produce results and forecasts that lack robustness and show variation
across models.
This paper introduces a common representation of SIR-type stochastic epidemiological models to facilitate the comparison between models and their outcomes. This representation is a discrete time transition model, which is used to define a typology of
epidemiological models with respect to the number of states (compartments) and their
interpretation.
The discrete time transition model is characterized by a transition matrix, which
determines the probabilities of transitions between the states distinguished in an epidemiological model. As such, it can easily accommodate individual and aggregate count
data sampled at various frequencies. On the contrary, a discretization bias arises when
a continuous time deterministic differential system is adapted to data sampled at fixed
intervals. In particular, the discretization bias affects the estimated collective immunity
ratio, which causes its reliability and even its existence to be questionable. Moreover, a
time discretized SIR-type model is shown to provide different results in an application to
data sampled at different frequencies, such as the daily or weekly frequencies, due to its
inconsistency with respect to the time unit. The same limitation concerns the reproduction number, which is a commonly used epidemiological parameter. We also comment
on the constrained specifications of some SIR-type models, with the potentially complex
dynamics of infection probabilities being determined from very few parameters. The transition model allows us to avoid these and other limitations revealed in the commonly used
epidemiological models and discussed in the paper.
When aggregate counts are observed, all SIR-type models are shown to have a (Gaussian) (pseudo) nonlinear state space representation, which is convenient for statistical
inference. We show that a quasi-maximum likelihood (QML) estimation method can be

THIS VERSION: June 19, 2020

applied to the pseudo state space representation and easily implemented with an extended,
or unscented Kalman filter used for approximating the unobserved state probabilities.
The paper is organized as follows. The stochastic transition model is introduced in
Section 2. First, we define the stochastic framework of individual histories, which is next
transformed into a deterministic dynamic model, for the cross-sectional count aggregates
over a large number of individuals. Section 3 examines the features of the 2-state SI
and 3-state SIR models. We perform the sensitivity analysis to see how the peak of
new infections and the time-to-peak depend on the propagation parameters. In Section
4, the (pseudo) state space representation of an epidemiological is derived for statistical
inference. In Section 5, we discuss the case when the propagation parameters display
either a deterministic, or stochastic variation over time. We show that these extensions of
the model can also be examined in a (pseudo) state space framework. Section 6 concludes.
The typology of SIR type models with 2, 3 and 4 states is given in Appendix 1. Proofs
are gathered in Appendix 2.

Contagion Modelling

This section introduces a general specification that encompasses the main epidemiological
SIR-type models. It is a discrete time stochastic transition model that allows for modelling of individual histories during an epidemic without the limitations revealed in the
deterministic epidemiological models. In particular, we point that the time discretized
version of a continuous time SIR-type model depends on the time unit and needs to be
re-adjusted for the sampling frequency of the data. Moreover, the reproduction number
computed from the time discretized model depends on the time unit as well and takes a
different value when computed from daily or weekly data. We also show a difficulty with
inference based on a continuous time model of frequencies.

2.1

The Stochastic Transition Model

We consider a large panel of individual histories Yi,t , i = 1, .., N, t = 0, .., T , where the
variable Y is qualitative multinomial with J alternatives denoted by j = 1, ..., J. These
alternatives are the states of infection, recovery or death, depending on the model specification (or compartments in the epidemiological terminology). The discrete time t is

THIS VERSION: June 19, 2020

3

assumed to be measured in days, as daily data are often used in epidemiological studies.
Assumption A1: The individual histories are such that:
i) The variables Yi,t , i = 1, .., N at time t fixed have the same marginal (i.e. crosssectional) distributions. This common distribution depends on time t and is discrete. It
is determined by the vector p(t) of size J with components:
pj (t) = P (Yi,t = j), j = 1, .., J.
These components are non-negative and sum up to 1 .
ii) The processes (Yi,t , t = 1, ., T ), i = 1, .., N are independent, heterogeneous Markov
processes of order 1, with common transition probabilities. The transitions from date
t − 1 to date t are characterized by the J × J transition matrix Π[p(t − 1)]. This matrix
has nonnegative elements and each of its rows sums up to 1.
The vector p(t) represents the cross-sectional (marginal) probabilities of states. In
practice, the cross-sectional probability p(t) is close to the cross-sectional frequency f (t),
computed from the values of Yi,t . Then, transition matrix Π[p(t−1)] is close to Π[f (t−1)].
However the transitions between states have to be defined with respect to p(t−1) to remain
independent of the population size.
Assumption A2: i) The epidemic starts at time 0. ii) At time 0 all individuals are in
state j = 1, which is interpreted as the susceptible compartment.
Under Assumptions A1 and A2, the individual histories Yi,t are independent and identically distributed. Therefore, the individuals are exchangeable, i.e. have similar risk
factors (homogenous population).
The initial condition also implies nonstationary evolutions of the processes of individual histories over time. This nonstationarity and the time dependence of the transition
matrix through p(t − 1) only are the distinct characteristics of a SIR-type model. There
is one exception, however. When the SIR model is a homogenous Markov process, the
transition matrix Π is independent of p(t−1). In general however, the transition matrix Π
is time dependent. Then, the type of epidemiological model is determined by the number
of states, their interpretations, and the structure of the transition matrix. More specifically, the elements of the transition matrix can be either zeros, constants, or functions

THIS VERSION: June 19, 2020

of marginal probabilities p(t − 1) in the presence of time dependence. The models differ
with respect to the form of those functions and of the components of p(t − 1), which are
their arguments.
The examples of commonly used SIR-type specifications are described in Appendix
1. Although most of the SIR-type models are heterogeneous Markov models, the homogeneous Markov model mentioned above can be used for either the local analysis (see
Section 2.2), or for deriving the lower and upper bounds on the trajectories of marginal
probabilities p(t). Those bounds are mainly determined by the maximum (resp. minimum) of moduli of all eigenvalues of Π[p(t − 1)], called the Lyapunov exponents, over
time t.

2.2

The Deterministic Model

Assumptions A1 and A2 defining the stochastic dynamics of Yi,t lead to a deterministic
nonlinear recursive model for the dynamics of marginal probabilities p(t). This deterministic representation is obtained by applying the Bayes formula and is given by:
p(t) = Π [p(t − 1)]0 p(t − 1), t = 1, .., T,

(2.1)

with initial condition: p(0) = (1, 0, .., 0)0 . As shown in Section 4, system (2.1) can be used
as a system of estimating equations for statistical inference.
System (2.1) can be rewritten to define the dynamics of changes in marginal probabilities:
∆p(t) = p(t) − p(t − 1) = {Π [p(t − 1)] − Id}p(t − 1),

(2.2)

where Id denotes the identity matrix. The equation (2.2) highlights the role of the
generator: Π [p(t − 1)] − Id, in determining the changes in marginal probabilities ∆p(t).
Remark 1: Discretization bias.
A major part of literature concerns epidemiological models written as deterministic
differential systems in continuous time. A continuous time analogue of the deterministic
model (2.2) is:
dp(t)/dt = {Π[p(t)] − Id}p(t).

(2.3)

THIS VERSION: June 19, 2020

In general, the system of equations (2.2) is not the exact time discretized version of the
continuous time system (2.3) [see Appendix 2 for the rational recursive system]. Thus,
due to the nonlinearities in the dynamics, a chaos effect can arise and induce considerably
different evolutions of p(t) defined from (2.2) and (2.3), especially over the medium run.
To highlight the differences between the discrete and continuous time modelling, let
us consider the 2-state SIS model with a linear force of infection, i.e. a linear function π
(see Remark 1). The probability of being infected p2 (t) satisfies the following recursive
equation 1 :
p2 (t) = [βp2 (t − 1)][1 − p2 (t − 1)] + (1 − γ)p2 (t − 1),
in discrete time and
dp2 (t)/dt = (β − γ)p2 (t) − γp2 (t)2 ,
in continuous time. Even though both equations look similar and contain the same parameter symbols, the following differences can be pointed out:
i) The discrete time version of SIS is not time consistent, as p2 (t) at lag 2 derived by
recursive substitution is a quartic function of p2 (t − 2). Hence, this specification needs to
be modified whenever the unit of time separating the observations changes. In practice,
this means that a specification valid for daily data is not valid for weekly data. On the
contrary, the continuous time version of SIS is time consistent.
ii) The parameters β and γ in both the discrete and continuous time SIS models given
above depend on the selected time unit too. In the continuous time model however, β
and γ are multiplied by the same factor when the time unit is changed. Then, the socalled reproduction number R0 = β/γ is invariant with respect to the time unit. As the
discrete time model is not time consistent, R0 computed directly from the time discretized
model is not invariant with respect to the time unit either. Hence, different values of R0
are obtained from daily and weekly data. Any result obtained from the time discretized
differential equation (called the Euler discretization) and interpreted in the continuous
time framework needs to be interpreted with caution. This finding calls into question
1

Coefficients β, γ are assumed constrained to ensure that p2 (t) takes values between 0 and 1, for any
p2 (t − 1) in [0,1].

THIS VERSION: June 19, 2020

the reliability of the reproduction number R0 and some of its transforms, such as the
asymptotic value p2 (∞), which are important components of epidemiological studies.
Remark 2: Non-differentiability of a continuous time frequency model
It is common to write the epidemiological model as a differential system of frequencies
f (t), instead of marginal probabilities p(t), as:
df (t)/dt = [Π[f (t)] − Id]f (t).

(2.4)

This differential system is not compatible with the set of admissible values of vectors f (t) 2 .
The components of f (t) are not continuously valued functions, as they take on values equal
to the multiples of 1/N , which implies the non-differentiability of function f (t). Therefore,
an epidemiological model of this type cannot provide accurate results. Moreover, as the
model is deterministic, it cannot take into account the ex-ante uncertainty about the
vectors f (t), which are random.

2.3

Local Expansions

Let us now examine the dynamics of marginal probabilities of states p(t). The analysis of
their evolution during an epidemic can be simplified if we focus on either the beginning,
or the end of the epidemic and consider local expansions.
2.3.1 Beginning of the epidemic
At time t = 0, the initial value is: p(0) = (1, 0, .., 0)0 . Below, we consider expansions
of orders 1 and 2 of the recursive system (2.1) in a neighbourhood of p(0).
i) First-Order Expansion:
The first-order expansion is:
p(t) = Π[p(0)]0 p(t − 1),

(2.5)

which corresponds to a homogeneous Markov model with transition matrix Π[p(0)]. It
can be solved analytically as:
2

It is also the case when a stochastic feature is introduced by replacing the deterministic differential
equation by a stochastic one, such as a multivariate Jacobi process to account for the positivity and unit
mass restrictions on the components of f (t) [see, Admani et al. (2018), Jiang et al. (2011), El Koufi et
al. (2019) for examples of stochastic differential epidemic models and Gourieroux,Jasiak (2006) for the
multivariate Jacobi process].

0

p(t) = Π [p(0)] t p(0),

(2.6)

We find that locally the components of marginal probabilities p(t) are combinations of
exponential functions (and also of sine functions, cosine functions, which can possibly be
multiplied by polynomials, if some eigenvalues of Π [p(0)] are complex and/or multiple).
Their dynamics are constrained by the specific form of matrix Π[p(0)], which is a transition
matrix. More specifically, all components of p(t) have to take values between 0 and 1.
In order to satisfy this restriction, locally, the marginal probability p1 (t) is exponentially
decreasing over time, whereas marginal probabilities of other states pj (t), j = 2, .., J are
exponentially increasing over time.
ii) Second-Order Expansion
The second order expansion leads to the dynamic system:

p(t) = {Π [p(0)] +

J
X

dΠ [p(0)]/dpj pj (t − 1)}0 p(t − 1),

(2.7)

j=1

which is a Riccati quadratic recursive system.
2.3.2 End of the epidemic
In general, the epidemiological models include some absorbing states, such as the
states of deceased, or recovered (see the examples in Section 3 and Appendix 1). In this
case, the sequence of marginal probabilities p(t) has a limit when t → ∞ : p(∞), say. If
there is only one absorbing state J, say, we get p(∞) = (0, 0, .., 1)0 . Then, the first- and
second-order expansions can be performed in a neighbourhood of p(∞), yielding dynamic
approximations systems analogous to systems (2.5) and (2.7).
The early phases of the epidemic, which are characterized by expansions given in
Section 2.3.1. are illustrated in Section 4. Expansions derived in Section 2.3.2 can be
used for other research objectives, such as determining the level of collective immunity.

Let us now study the dynamic properties of two commonly used epidemiological models,

transition model. We derive the dynamic equations of marginal probabilities and describe
their behavior at the beginning and the end of an epidemic.

3.1

SI Model

3.1.1 The deterministic model
The transition model representation of the deterministic SI model involves the following
2 × 2 transition matrix:
row 1, S: 1 − π(p2 ); π(p2 ).
row 2, I: 0, 1.
The state I of infected, still infectious and immunized is the absorbing state. Function
π is the contagion function (called the force of infection) that satisfies the following
assumption:
Assumption A3: π is a non-decreasing function of p2 , which takes values between 0 and
1.
The value π(0) can be interpreted as an exogenous component of the contagion. In an
open economy, it can be due to the effect of tourism, international trade and migration.
In a closed economy, such as the world in its entirety, it can be set equal to zero. There
is a strict (endogeneous) contagion effect if function π is strictly increasing.
Example 1: A common specification of the force of infection π is the linear function:
π(p2 ) = b p2 , where parameter b takes values between 0 and 1, or a logistic function of p2 :
π(p2 ) = exp(a + bp2 )/[1 + exp(a + bp2 )],
where coefficient b is non-negative. In the logistic force of infection the exogenous infection
rate is measured by: exp a/[1 + exp a] and the strict endogenous contagion effect by
parameter b. Other functional forms have also been considered in the growth literature
and obtained, for instance, by replacing p2 by a power of p2 in the expressions given
above [see e.g. Richards(1959), Kuhi et al. (2003), Table 1, Brandenburg (2019), Wu et
al. (2020), Harvey, Kattuman (2020)].
The form of the transition matrix given above leads to the following nonlinear recursive
equation of order 1 for the marginal probability of being infected:

THIS VERSION: June 19, 2020

p2 (t) = π(p2 (t − 1))[1 − p2 (t − 1)] + p2 (t − 1).

9

(3.1)

Proposition 1: Under Assumption A3, p2 (t) is a non-decreasing function of time with
exponential lower and upper bounds:
1 − [1 − π(0)]t ≤ p2 (t) ≤ 1 − [1 − π(1)]t .
It tends to 1 when t → ∞.
Proof:
i) It is non-decreasing, as p2 (t) − p2 (t − 1) is non-negative.
ii) The bounds are obtained by observing that p2 (t) is an increasing function of π.
iii) Since p2 (t) is non-decreasing and bounded by 1, it converges to a value p2 (∞). This
limit is equal to 1, by considering (3.1) at t = ∞.
QED
In particular, if there is no contagion effect i.e. if π(p2 ) is constant and equal to π,
then the marginal probability of being infected is: p2 (t) = 1 − [1 − π]t .
3.1.2 Expansions
It is interesting to consider the expansions of the dynamics of the probability of being
infected in the SI model at the beginning of the contagion,i.e. when p2 is close to zero, or
at the end of the contagion, i.e. when p2 is close to 1.
i) Beginning of the contagion
A second-order expansion leads to:
p2 (t) − p2 (t − 1) ∝ [π(0) + dπ(0)/dp p2 (t − 1)][1 − p2 (t − 1)].

(3.2)

ii) End of the contagion
The second-order expansion in a neighbourhood of p2 = 1 yields:

p2 (t) − 1 = [π(1) + dπ(1)/dp [p2 (t − 1) − 1]][1 − p2 (t − 1)] + p2 (t − 1) − 1.

(3.3)

Both approximations lead to discrete time logistic recursive equations for the probability of being infected p2 (t) and the probability of not being infected 1 − p2 (t), respectively.

THIS VERSION: June 19, 2020

10

3.1.3 Continuous time analogue
The continuous time analogue of the recursive equation (3.2) is:
dp2 (t)/dt = (α + βp2 (t))(1 − p2 (t)),

(3.4)

where α = π(0), β = dπ(0)/dp are both nonnegative.
Equation (3.4) can be solved analytically.
Proposition 2: i) Assuming that the beginning of the epidemics is at time t = 0, the
solution of equation (3.4) is:
p2 (t) = [α exp[(α + β)t] − α]/[α exp[(α + β)t] + β].
ii) If β > α, the solution is such that the derivative dp2 (t)/dt attains the maximum
when p2 (t) = (β − α)/(2β). The time-to- inflection is reached at t∗ = log(β/α)/(α + β).
Proof: see Appendix 2.
It follows that the probability of being infected p2 (t) is a logistic function of time.
Moreover, if the strict contagion effect is large as compared to the exogenous component
of the contagion, there is a peak in the changes of ratios of infected individuals over time.
The size and timing of the peak depend on the propagation parameters. However, the
SI model has only two parameters, which is insufficient to independently determine the
peak, the time to peak and other characteristics such as the flatness of the curve at the
peak (the so-called ”plateau” effect) as well as the asymmetry of the curve with respect
to the peak.
These above outcomes of the SI model (3.1) are based on a local expansion of the initial
nonlinear recursive equation and are therefore valid at the beginning of an epidemic only.
The length of the time episode over which such an expansion is valid depends on function
π, and also on the values of parameters a, b in the parametric SI model in Example 1.
3.1.4 Sensitivity Analysis
Let us consider below the parametric SI model in Example 1 and illustrate graphically
its dynamics. At time 0, we fix the probability of being infected p2 (0) = 0 and set the
parameters α, β, where α > 0, β > 0 equal to α = 0.005, β = 0.85.

THIS VERSION: June 19, 2020

Figure 1 below displays the dynamic of solution p(t) which satisfies the continuous
time SI model (3.4), i.e. with the logistic evolution given in Proposition 2, and its discrete
time Euler approximation at the beginning of an epidemic given in equation(3.2). It is
computed with the same values of parameters α, β given above. Figure 1 shows that the
discrete time approximation (3.2) can be very misleading when it is used for forecasting
over a medium or long run.
[Insert Figure 1: Evolutions of p(t), SI Model]
When β < α, we get an increasing concave curve that tends to 1. When β > α, as in
Figure 1, we get an exponential convex increase for small t, followed by an increasing
concave pattern of convergence to 1.
The evolutions of changes of p(t) are shown in Figure 2:
[Insert Figure 2: Evolutions of Changes in p(t), SI Model]
When β > α, we get a hump-shaped pattern with the curve decreasing at a slower rate
after the peak than increasing before the peak.
We complete the sensitivity analysis of the main features of the SI model by examining
the size of peak (Figure 3) and the time-to-inflection (Figure 4).
[Insert Figure 3: Size of Peak, SI Model]
[Insert Figure 4: Time to Inflection, SI Model]

3.2

SIR model

3.2.1 The model
Let us now consider the SIR model (see Appendix 1) with three states: S for Susceptible; I for Infected, infectious, not immunized; R for Recovered, immunized and no longer
infectious. Its transition model representation involves the 3 × 3 transition matrix, which
is triangular and given by:
row 1, S: 1 − π(p2 ); π(p2 ) ; 0
row 2, I : 0, p22 ; p23
row3,R : 0; 0; 1
where p23 is strictly positive, and R is the absorbing state.

THIS VERSION: June 19, 2020

12

In the limiting case p23 = 0, the 2 × 2 North-West subset of the transition matrix
corresponds to the SI model discussed in Section 3.1. There are two absorbing states in
the SIR model: I and R. State R cannot be reached starting from an initial state S of
susceptible individuals.
The marginal probabilities of states I and R satisfy two linearly independent estimating
equations:

p2 (t) = π[p2 (t − 1)][1 − p2 (t − 1) − p3 (t − 1)] + p22 p2 (t − 1),

(3.5)

p3 (t) = p23 p2 (t − 1) + p3 (t − 1).
From the second equation of system (3.5),we get:
p2 (t − 1) = [p3 (t) − p3 (t − 1)]/p23 ,

(3.6)

and by substituting into the first equation, we derive the recursive equation satisfied by
p3 (t):

p3 (t) = p3 (t − 1) + π[(p3 (t − 1) − p3 (t − 2))/p23 ][p23 − p3 (t − 1) + (1 − p23 )p3 (t − 2)]
+ p22 [p3 (t − 1) − p3 (t − 2)].

(3.7)

Proposition 3 i) The sequence p1 (t) [resp. p3 (t)] is decreasing [resp. increasing].
ii) The sequence p3 (t) satisfies a nonlinear recursive equation of order 2.
iii) The sequence p2 (t) is a linear moving average of order 1 in p3 (t + 1).
The higher order of temporal dependence in p3 (t) is due to the interpretation of state I as
a transitory state between S and R. Thus, the dynamics of p3 (t) has to account for both
the entries into and exits from the state I.
Let us now discuss the behaviour of marginal probabilities p(t) when t tends to infinity.
Since p3 (t) is increasing, and it is upper bounded by 1, its limit is p3 (∞), say. From
equation (3.6), it follows that the limit of p2 (t) is zero. Then, by taking into account the
first equation of (3.5), we get:

THIS VERSION: June 19, 2020

13

Lemma 1: When t → ∞,
i) p2 (t) → 0.
ii) If π(0) is different from 0, p3 (t) → 1.
iii) If π(0) = 0, p3 (t) might tend to a limiting value p3 (∞) < 1.
Determining the conditions for such a convergence to p3 (∞), which is strictly less
than 1 and computing this limiting value, which is interpreted as the level of collective
immunity are common topics in the epidemiological literature. Due to the time discretisation bias (see Remark 1), estimation errors on a long run parameter p3 (∞) are large in
an early phase of epidemic. Hence, the estimated ratio of collective immunity and even
its existence may be unreliable.
3.2.2 Homogeneous Markov
As mentioned Section in 3.1, it is interesting to consider the homogeneous Markov
chain, obtained when function π is constant (no contagion). Then the evolution of p(t) is
driven by a linear recursive equation of order 1: p(t) = Π0 p(t − 1), where Π is a triangular
matrix with eigenvalues: 1 − π, p22 , 1. The following proposition is obtained:
Proposition 4: For a constant π, we have: p(t) = A(1 − π)t + Bpt22 + C, where A, B, C
are 3-dimensional vectors.
The effects of entries into and exits from state I induce the two driving exponential
functions.
When function π is not constant, the decreasing sequence p1 (t) and increasing sequence
p3 (t) take values between their analogues computed from a homogeneous Markov chain
with π = π(0) and π = π(1), respectively.
3.2.3 Local expansion
At the beginning of an epidemic the probability of being infected p2 (t) is close to 0.
Then, the estimating equations can be replaced by second-order discrete or continuous
deterministic systems of Riccati type. Some of these Riccati systems have closed-form
solutions that involve transcendental functions [see Miller (2012), Harko et al. (2014)].
However these analytical solutions have complicated expressions. Alternatively, they can
be derived by simulation methods, which are easy to perform in the SIR model.
3.2.4 Sensitivity Analysis

THIS VERSION: June 19, 2020

14

Let us assume a linear function π(p2 ) = a+bp2 , where a > 0, b > 0, a+b < 1. Then the
SIR model involves 3 independent parameters, and is expected to provide more flexibility
than the SI model, due to the additional parameter p23 . Below, we perform a sensitivity
analysis similar to that in Section 3.1.4 and focused on series p2 (t). Parameters a, b, p23
are set equal to a = 0.005, b = 0.85, p23 = 0.5.
[Insert Figure 5: Evolution of p2 (t), SIR Model]
[Insert Figure 6 : Evolution of Change in p2 (t), SIR Model]
The timing of a peak is determined by parameter a as shown below. We hold parameter
b = 0.85 constant and change the values of parameter a in Figure 7.
[Insert Figure 7 : Timing of Peak, a varying, SIR Model]
Next, parameter a = 0.005 is held constant and the values of parameter b are allowed to
vary. The size of peak is determined by parameter b as shown in Figure 8 below.

Statistical Inference

This section present the methods of inference for the discrete time transition model. Let
us now consider a parametric transition matrix Π[p(t − 1); θ], with parameter vector θ,
and assume that the empirical frequencies f (t), t = 1, .., T are observed. In addition, we
assume that the parametric model is well specified.

Under Assumptions A1, A2, these frequencies converge at rate 1/ N to their theoretical
counterparts and are asymptotically normal. Thus we can write:
f (t) = p(t) + u(t),

(4.1)

where the errors are Gaussian with mean zero and the variance-covariance matrix at lag
h given below [Gourieroux, Jasiak (2020)]:

Cov[u(t), u(t − h)] = (1/N ){Π(t − 1, h)diag[p(t − h)] − p(t)p(t − h)0 },

(4.2)

THIS VERSION: June 19, 2020

where: Π(t − 1, h) = Π[p(t − 1)]...Π[p(t − h)].

4.2

(Pseudo) State space representation

System (4.1) resembles a measurement equation in a state space system with the measurement variable f (t), measurement error u(t), and the following system of transition
equations for the state variable p(t),:
p(t) = Π[p(t − 1); θ]0 p(t − 1).

(4.3)

However, the system of equations (4.3) and (4.1) does not fully satisfy the definition of
a state space representation because the measurement errors u(t) are serially correlated,
as shown in equation (4.2).
This difficulty is easily circumvented by assuming a pseudo Gaussian distribution for
the errors u0t , and disregarding the autocorrelation. Their variance-covariance matrix at
time t can be assumed equal to an identity matrix Id (Ordinary Least Squares approach)
or an unknown constant matrix Ω (Weighted Least Squares approach), or even the true
expression of V (ut ) can be considered. Upon this change of autocovariance structure, a
(pseudo) state space representation is obtained.
The pseudo state space representation can be estimated by the Gaussian quasi-maximum
likelihood (QML). The quasi-maximum likelihood approach has also an interpretation in
terms of estimating equations and asymptotic least squares [see, Berkson (1944), Godambe, Thompson (1974), McRae (1977), Kalbfleisch et al. (1983), Hardin, Hilbe (2003),
Miller, Judge (2015)]. As the asymptotic theory is established for T fixed and N → ∞,
the QML and weighted least squares methods provide consistent estimators of parameter
vector θ, which are not fully efficient as the true structure of autocovariances of errrors
ut has not been taken into account [see, Gourieroux, Jasiak (2020), Appendix 2].
In practice, the QML estimates 3 of θ can be computed numerically from an extended,
or unscented Kalman Filter

4

applied to the (pseudo) state space model.

The estimation approach outlined above remains valid when some frequencies fj (t)
3

As the QML approach does not account for the structure of the variance-covariance matrix of the
u(t)’s it can be improved by replacing a ”moment” estimator by a GMM estimator.

are missing (see Gourieroux, Jasiak(2020) for an application to inference on latent counts
of infected and undetected (asymptomatic) individuals).
The extended Kalman filter provides information on the uncertainty of estimates and
predictions. This uncertainty has to be taken into account, especially at the early ascending phase of an epidemic, when the number of observations is small, the quality of data
is rather poor and the parameter of interest, such as the peak, is distant in time from the
period of observations. Then, the confidence and prediction intervals are rather wide and
the statistician has to interpret the results with caution [see e.g. Viboud et al. (2016),
Chowell et al. (2019) for studies at early stages].
The extended Kalman filter is suitable as an updating algorithm of estimates and
forecasts [Nihan, Davis (1987)]. This is especially important at the beginning of the
epidemic, when each newly arrived observation is very informative.

Models with Time Dependent Parameters

5.1

The modelling

The simple epidemiological models can be easily extended to allow for time dependent
parameters, obtained by replacing θ by a(t), b, say, to distinguish the time dependent
parameter vector from the constant parameters. Then, their transition model representation involves the transition matrix Π[p(t − 1), a(t), b]. The time dependent propagation
parameters can, for instance, capture the time varying implementation of social distancing measures and the compliance with these measures [see e.g. DiDomenico et al. (2020),
Alvares et al. (2020)]. Such an extended model can be written also in the (pseudo) state
space representation and estimated by using the methods given in the previous Section.
The (pseudo) state space representations depend on the assumptions on the evolution of
parameter vector a(t). At least three types of modelling approaches can be considered.
i) Dynamics of a(t) left unspecified
The state space representation comprises the measurement equation:
f (t) = p(t) + u(t),
and the transition equations:

THIS VERSION: June 19, 2020

17

p(t) = Π[p(t − 1), a(t), b]0 p(t − 1).
The state variables are the marginal probabilities p(t) and parameters a(t) while b is
the vector of constant parameter. They can be jointly estimated and the state variables
filtered by the extended Kalman filter, under an identification condition. In particular,
the order condition: (J − 1)(T − 1) ≥ T dim a + dim b has to be satisfied.
ii) Stochastic evolution of a(t)
An alternative model has the same measurement equation and extends the previous state
space representation system as it includes additional transitions such as:
a(t) = φa(t − 1) + v(t),
where the errors v(t) are Gaussian noises independent of the measurement errors u(t) and
|φ| < 1 for stationarity.
Under this representation, the state variables are the marginal probabilities p(t) and
parameters a(t), and b is the constant parameter vector. The extended Kalman Filter
can be used to jointly estimate b and filter the components of a(t).
iii) Exogenous information on a(t)
If the indicators x(t) of social distancing are available, such as counts of travellers
[see, Hurtacsu et al. (2020)] and the daily numbers of fines for disobeying the social
distancing rules, the model can be extended to include x(t). Then, the model is similar to
the representation above with the autoregressive dynamic replaced by an equation such
as:
a(t) = Cx(t) + v(t)
where C is a row vector of constant coefficients to be estimated and v(t) are Gaussian
noises independent of the measurement errors u(t).
5.2 Logistic model with stochastic contagion parameter
Let us now examine the limiting case of time independent stochastic parameters,
which is a very special case of stochastic dynamics and consider the logistic model of
Proposition 2. The stochastic parameters are introduced to account for heterogeneity of

THIS VERSION: June 19, 2020

18

infection patterns. For ease of exposition, we assume a discrete heterogeneity distribution
with weights qk , k = 1, ..., K on values (αk , βk ), k = 1, ..., K [see, Gourieroux et al.(1996),
Yan, Chowell (2019)]. Then, equation (3.4) is written conditional on α, β and defines the
evolution of p2,k (t) for values αk , βk . Next, these evolutions need to be re-integrated with
respect to α, β, in order to find the marginal probability of being infected p2 (t) as follows:

p2 (t) =

K
X

K
X
qk p2,k (t) =
{qk [αk [exp(αk + βk )t] − αk ] / [αk exp[(αk + βk )t] + βk ]}.

k=1

k=1

We get a convex combination of logistic functions 5 . This additive specification implies
that p2 (t) cannot follow a quadratic differential equation such as (3.4). There is a double
heterogeneity i) in coefficients α, which means that there exist multiple initial exogenous
clusters of infection of different sizes, ii) in coefficients β, which means that the speeds of
propagation of each cluster are different. This model is not a special case of (SI)K [see
Appendix 1] as there is no contagion between the sub-populations k and only contagion
within is allowed.
The presence of heterogeneity in a logistic model generates the following effects:
i) several peaks can appear in the changes in p2 (t) over time. This is the wave effect
[Witham (1974), Gourieroux et al. (1996)], due to different propagation parameters of
each wave.
ii) the persistence of p2 (t) increases due to the additive representation. This is a wellknown long memory effect revealed in Granger, Joyeux (1980) for linear autoregressive
models that also exist in nonlinear logistic models [see Sattenspiel (1990)].
Below, a three-wave pattern is illustrated in Figure 9 for the following parameter
values: α = 0.015, 0.0005, 0.0001, β = 0.95, 0.85, 0.75
[Insert Figure 9: Three-Wave Infection Pattern]
We observe the three waves with the highest peak due to the first wave. We also
observe a persistence effect as the decline following the first peak is slower than the
declines of each wave separately.

Concluding Remarks

Contrary to the major part of literature on epidemiological models, which considers deterministic continuous time models of counts of individuals in various compartments (states),
we consider stochastic models in discrete time for variables representing individual histories [see also Allen (1994), Das et al.(2011) for discrete time approach]. The proposed
discrete time transition model has the following advantages:
i) It eliminates the lack of consistency between time discretized continuous time models with respect to the time unit. In the continuous time setup, it also eliminates the
assumption of differentiability of aggregate counts, which are discrete variables. This is
especially important in the early phase of an epidemic when some of these counts are
small.
ii) The stochastic model allows us to combine aggregate count variables and individual
medical histories of patients under medical care.
iii) The stochastic component allows us for deriving not only the point, but also
interval forecast. This is important at the beginning of an epidemic when the number of
observations is small and the results are less reliable.
iv) The estimation of the transition model can be performed by applying an extended
Kalman filter to its (pseudo) state space representation.

Appendix A.1

Structural Epidemiological Models
This Appendix presents a typology of basic epidemiological models that can serve as
building blocks of more complex specifications. The difference between the basic models
are with respect to:
i) the number of states ( compartments) and their interpretations as S= susceptible,
E=exposed, I =infected, R =recovered, D=deceased.
ii) The number and types of virus propagation sources
iii) The location of zeros in the transition matrix (i.e. the causal structure)
iv) The structure of time dependent transition probabilities.
We provide below the transition probabilities along with the state interpretations. The
time dependent transition probabilities are denoted by π and are functions of (lagged)
marginal probabilities p(t).
The models described below are the following:
2-state: SI model, SIS model
3-state:SIR model
4-state : SIRD model, SEIR model, SIR model, (SI)2 model, S,IU ,ID, R model.
The interpretations of states and the form of transition matrices are given below.
2-state SI model
S= susceptible,I= infected,being immunized and staying infectious for the S people
row 1,S: π11 (p2 ), π12 (p2 )
row 2, I : 0,1
One absorbing state,one source of infection.
2-state SIS model
S:susceptible, I infected, can recover, but without being immunized.
row 1,S: π11 (p2 ), π12 (p2 )
row 2,I: p21 , p22 , with p21 > 0.
One source of infection, no absorbing state;a non degenerate stationary solution can
exist [see e.g. Allen (1994), Feng et al (2005) for the use of SIS model].

The population is divided into 2 sub-populations, as region 1 & region 2, male & female,
young & old. It is easily extended to any number of regions.

One absorbing state,one propagation source [see e.g. Zhang,Ma (2003)].
4-state: S IU ID R

row 2, IU: 0, p22 , p23 , p24
row 3, ID: 0, 0, p33 , p34
row 4, R: 0, 0, 0, 1
One absorbing state, two propagation sources [see e.g. Gourieroux, Jasiak (2020)].
These structural models can be extended by considering other states, such as the birth
6

to offset the future number of deaths due to coronavirus, the types of medical treatment

of patients in hospitals, the severity (asymptomatic (mild), symptomatic, high), or the
detection (contact tracing, influenza like illness surveillance, tests, etc) [see, e.g. Verity et
al. (2020)]. The models can also be extended by combining the basic models as building
blocks to construct a 5-state model such as the SEIRD [see e.g. Korolev(2020)], or S IU
ID R D, a 6-state model such as the SIU 2 , ID2 , R, or (SIR)2 . The structure of the
transition matrix can also be modified to account for the possibility that a fraction of
recovered individuals is not entirely immunized and can be infected twice.

6

In transition models the state birth is usually introduced to balance the deaths and to provide
stationary evolutions of the processes [see e.g. Harko et al. (2014)]. This ad-hoc introduction of births
is not relevant at the beginning of the epidemic when the interest is in determining the nonstationary
dynamic at the beginning of the epidemic, rather than in the long run equilibrium. Second, there is no
increased count of births (known 9 months earlier) in order to offset the increasing number of deaths due
to coronavirus.

Appendix A.2

Rational Recursive Equations
This Appendix shows the exact solution and the exact time discretization of the probability to be infected in a continuous time SI model. We provide below the results for
a general one-dimensional Riccati equation in continuous time written on a series x(t).
Then, the results can be applied to the special case x(t) = p2 (t).
i) The differential equation
This differential equation is:
dx(t)/dt = −λ(x(t) − a)(x(t) − b)/(a − b),
where λ is strictly positive.
ii) The solution
Since:
(a − b)/[(x(t) − a)(x(t) − b)] = 1/(x(t) − a) − 1/(x(t) − b),
we deduce:
dx(t)[1/(x(t) − a) − 1/(x(t) − b)] = −λdt,
and by integration:
|x(t) − a|/|x(t) − b| = exp(−λt)|x(0) − a|/|x(0) − b|.
The form of this relation implies that the trajectory x(t) and the starting value x(0)
satisfy always the same relationship with respect to a and b, that is x(t) is in the interval
(a,b) (resp. below, above), if x(0) is in this interval (resp. below, above). Therefore, we
can disregard the absolute values to get:
(x(t) − a)/(x(t) − b) = exp(−λt)(x(0) − a)/(x(0) − b),
for any nonnegative t.

THIS VERSION: June 19, 2020

29

This implies a logistic expression for x(t):
x(t) = [a − bkexp(−λt)]/[1 − kexp(−λt)],
where: k = (x(0) − a)/(x(0) − b).
iii) The exact time discretized recursive model
We deduce that the exact time discretized counterpart corresponds to a rational transform of x(t − 1). More precisely, we get:

x(t) = {a[x(t − 1) − b] − b[x(t − 1) − a]exp(−λ)}/{[x(t − 1) − b] − [x(t − 1) − a]exp(−λ)}.
This rational recursive equation, which is the exact time discetization, differs from the
crude Euler discretization.
iv) Special case
The results above can be computed for equation (3.4) with: λ = β > 0, a = −α/β, b =
1. Without an exogenous source of infection: α = 0 ,the interval (a, b) is the interval (0,1),
x(t) = p2 (t) is decreasing and tends to 0 when t tends to infinity, for any starting value
p2 (0).
