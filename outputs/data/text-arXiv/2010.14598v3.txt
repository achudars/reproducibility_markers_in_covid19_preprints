Infectious diseases that incorporate pre-symptomatic transmission are challenging to monitor,
model, predict and contain. We address this scenario by studying a variant of a stochastic
susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered model on arbitrary network instances using an analytical
framework based on the method of dynamic message-passing. This framework provides a good
estimate of the probabilistic evolution of the spread on both static and contact networks, offering a significantly improved accuracy with respect to individual-based mean-field approaches while
requiring a much lower computational cost compared to numerical simulations. It facilitates the
derivation of epidemic thresholds, which are phase boundaries separating parameter regimes where
infections can be effectively contained from those where they cannot. These have clear implications
on different containment strategies through topological (reducing contacts) and infection parameter
changes (e.g., social distancing and wearing face masks), with relevance to the recent COVID-19
pandemic.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Rapid spreading of infectious diseases has had a devastating impact on societies throughout human history but
has become more critical in modern society due to dense
population in urban areas and the increase in human
mobility facilitated by global transportation networks.
A recent threat is the spread of the COVID-19 disease
caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which has led to a pandemic with severe impact on public health and the global
economy. One prominent feature of this disease is that
the presymptomatic and asymptomatic viral carriers can
spread the disease as well, which poses a big challenge
to contact tracing and disease containment [1–4]. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the signiﬁcance of these
undetected transmissions and estimate their impact. Of
particular importance are parameter regimes where preand asymptomatic infections result in a complete breakdown of our ability to identify infected individuals and
contain the spread.
Numerous studies that investigate the spread of the
COVID-19 disease aim at predicting the causes of the
spreading processes and examine the eﬀectiveness of nonpharmaceutical intervention strategies [5–7]. It is common to model the evolution of the population mass of
each group (e.g., susceptible, exposed, infected, and recovered) by deterministic diﬀerential equations [4, 5, 8].
While being simplistic and tractable, such a method assumes homogeneous mixing of the population (in a city or
within an age group) and neglects the social contact network structures of the speciﬁc instance investigated [9].
Large scale agent-based simulations are also widely used,
which provide a more detailed picture of the spreading
processes but are very computationally demanding and

suﬀer from a lack of principled understanding [10–13]. To
obtain a reliable statistical description of the process, one
has to increase the number of samples signiﬁcantly as the
system size increases, which makes the computation prohibitive for large systems. Analytical treatments to the
epidemic spreading processes on heterogeneous contact
networks are valuable both in providing solutions in speciﬁc instances and in exploring the typical macroscopic
behavior of an ensemble of systems with similar characteristics; the latter also results in generic and intuitive
understanding.
In this paper, we analyze diseases spreading with
presymptomatic transmission such as COVID-19 by
studying a variant of stochastic susceptible-exposedinfected-recovered (SEIR) model on contact networks, in
which nodes in exposed states can also spread the disease without showing symptoms. For simplicity, the contact networks are viewed as static, serving as substrates
on which the disease spreads. We derive the dynamic
message-passing (DMP) equations for this model, which
provide a good approximation to the complex stochastic
spreading dynamics on general networks and facilitates
theoretical analyses [14–18]. Based on this framework,
we derive the epidemic thresholds and their dependence
on diﬀerent intervention methods. The emphasis of this
paper is to provide a more accurate description of the
complex spreading dynamics through DMP to obtain a
more intuitive physical picture and to clarify the eﬀects
of some containment strategies.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. We
introduce the SEIR model in Sec. II, and derive the dynamical equations in Sec. III. We then perform a linear
stability analysis of the dynamical equations in Sec. IV,
based on which the epidemic thresholds are obtained and
analyzed in Sec. V. In Sec. VII, we show that nonbacktracking centrality can be used to predict the outbreak
proﬁle. In Sec. VIII, we investigate the eﬀects of reducing contacts on slowing down the spread of the disease.

2
Finally, we summarize our ﬁndings and discuss some limitations and outlook.
II.

THE MODEL

The contact network is represented by a graph G(V, E),
where V is the set of nodes and E is the set of edges. We
assume that the network has only one connected component. Each individual resides on a node, assuming one
of four states, susceptible (S), exposed (E), infected (I)
and recovered (R) at any particular time step. We assume that a node in the exposed state has contracted the
disease but has not developed symptoms yet. Unlike the
usual SEIR model [19], the exposed nodes can also spread
the disease. The dynamical process of the modiﬁed SEIR
model in discrete time is deﬁned in the form of transition
probabilities of states of neighboring nodes (say i and j)
and the state evolution of an individual node i,
αji

S(i) + E(j) −−→ E(i) + E(j),

(1)

S(i) + I(j) −−→ E(i) + I(j),

(2)

βji

νi

E(i) −→ I(i),

(3)

I(i) −→ R(i),

(4)

µi

where αji (βji ) is the probability that node j being in the
exposed(infected) state transmits the disease to its susceptible neighboring node i at a certain time step. We
assume that each time step corresponds to one day, keeping in mind that a ﬁner time scale can also be considered.
At each time step, an existing exposed node i becomes
infected (i.e., develops symptoms) with probability νi ,
while an existing infected node i recovers with probability µi . Therefore, the average periods of incubation and
recovery are 1/νi and 1/µi , respectively. At a certain
time step, the symptom-development and recovery processes are assumed to occur after possible transmission
activities. Since we will contrast the properties of the
SEIR and SIR models, we also introduce the transition
probabilities of the latter,
βji

S(i) + I(j) −−→ I(i) + I(j),

(5)

I(i) −→ R(i),

(6)

µi

which has been widely studied in the literature [9]. We
remark that both models are Markovian processes, implying an exponential distribution for both symptomdevelopment and recovery times, which may not be fully
realistic for many diseases including COVID-19 [9, 20].
Nevertheless, they both represent relevant models that
provide insights, oﬀer an approximate and eﬀective description of the spreading process and are amenable to
analysis.
The epidemiological parameters depend on the nature
of the disease and the intervention strategies being imposed; they are usually estimated based on observations

and can be subject to a high degree of uncertainty. As
for COVID-19, the average incubation period is about
5.2 days [3, 21]. Infectiousness is estimated to start
from 2.3 days before the onset of symptoms [3], while
it is argued [22] that infectiousness can start much earlier (one needs to look back at 5 days to catch 97% of
presymptomatic infections). The time needed for the
symptoms to disappear depends on disease severity of
the patient. In Ref. [3], it is inferred that infectiousness declines rapidly within 7 days. In [23], it is found
(from patients with mostly mild COVID-19) that viral
subgenomic RNA, which provide evidence of replicative
intermediates of the virus, were detectable up to 8 days
after the onset of symptoms. In this paper, we deﬁne
the recovered (R) state where the exposed and/or infected individual eﬀectively looses infectiousness, irrespective of whether the symptoms persist or not. Therefore, an infected individual who has been put into isolation and can no longer infect others is also categorized to
be in state R. To address the COVID-19 disease, we set
νi = 1/5, µi = 1/8 according to these previous ﬁndings.
The transmission probabilities αji , βji are more diﬃcult to estimate. Based on estimates from previous studies [2], we set αji = βji /2 in some experiments but will
also consider other parameter combinations in establishing the epidemic thresholds phase diagram. For simplicity, we also assume that the parameters are homogeneous,
i.e., αij = α, βij = β, νi = ν, µi = µ, while any infection
and/or recovery parameter distributions can also be accommodated. Various intervention strategies have diﬀerent impacts on these epidemiological parameters.
Our model can be easily extended to accommodate
other aspects of disease modeling. Some studies report cases where infected individuals remain asymptomatic throughout the course of the infection; however,
these cases seem to have a much lower secondary attack
rate [24, 25]. To keep the analysis simple, we do not
consider asymptomatic individuals who do not become
infected prior to recovery but brieﬂy discuss how the
frameworks used could accommodate such cases in Appendix B. We also discuss the extension to a model with
an additional compartment where the exposed individual
is non-contagious for a period of time, and derive the corresponding DMP equations in Appendix C. Despite the
simplicity assumptions made, the proposed SEIR model
captures the essential characteristics of presymptomatic
transmission and constitutes an eﬀective approximation
of the realistic spreading dynamics.

THEORETICAL FRAMEWORKS

Individual-Based Mean-Field Approach

Since the exact solutions of the stochastic spreading
processes Eqs. (1)-(4) are diﬃcult to obtain, various approximation methods have been developed to tackle such
complex dynamics [9]. A simple method is the individual-

3
based mean-ﬁeld (IBMF) approach [9, 26], which expresses the evolution of the marginal distribution Pσi (t)
that each node i belongs to state σ by assuming the independence on the probabilities of neighboring nodes.
Consider the SEIR model deﬁned in Sec. II. For node i
being in the susceptible state S, it will remain in state S
in the next time step if none of its neighbors transmits an
infection signal to node Q
i. In the
 IBMF framework, this

occurs with probability k∈∂i 1 − αki PEk (t) − βki PIk (t) ,
where ∂i denotes the set of nodes adjacent to node i.
Therefore the evolution of the marginal probability node
i in state S is given by
PSi (t + 1) = PSi (t)

Y

k∈∂i


1 − αki PEk (t) − βki PIk (t) . (7)

The probability of node i in the exposed state E increases
if there is an infection signal from its neighbors, while it
decreases with rate νi (probability of transforming into
state I) as infection symptoms appear. The corresponding IBMF dynamical equation is
PEi (t + 1) =(1 − νi )PEi (t)

Similarly, the evolution of

and

are given by

(10)

This approach has been used to investigate similar
models addressing the COVID-19 pandemic [27, 28].
However, the drastic simpliﬁcation based on the independence assumption of probabilities may lead to large
approximation errors [26]. One source of errors comes
from the mutual infection eﬀect due to this decorrelation
assumption [17, 29]. For instance, suppose that a node
i, having probability PEi (t) in the exposed state, infects
its susceptible neighboring node k at time t, then node
k can also reinfect node i at time t + 1 with some probability, which is an artifact of neglecting the correlation
between nodes i and k. Such eﬀects need to be correctly
accounted for to improve accuracy.
B.

Dynamic Message-passing Approach

The dynamic message-passing approach, an algorithm
that originates from the statistical physics literature [14–
16] avoids the mutual infection eﬀect by considering the
irreversible complete trajectories of the system. Formally, the DMP equations can be derived from the belief
propagation equations of dynamical trajectories, which is
especially useful when the correct set of dynamical variables are diﬃcult to determine straightforwardly [16, 30].

In this section, we provide an intuitive derivation of the
DMP equations of the SEIR model, while we give the
more formal derivation based on belief propagation in
Appendix A.
Similar to the IBMF approach, the DMP method aims
at deriving the evolution of the marginal distributions.
Consider the marginal probability PSi (t) of node i being
at state S at time t, it is given by
Y
PSi (t) = PSi (0)
θk→i (t),
(11)
k∈∂i

where θk→i (t) is the probability that node i has not contracted the disease from node k up to time t. We have
made the assumption that the probability which node i
has not contracted the
Q disease from its neighbors up to
time t factorizes as k∈∂i θk→i (t). This assumption is
valid in tree graphs but constitutes a good approximation in many loopy networks [16].
The message θk→i decreases if node k transmits the
infection signal to node i, which occurs with probability
αki if node k is in state E or with probability βki if node
k is in state I. Therefore, it follows the update rule
θk→i (t + 1) =θk→i (t) − αki ψ k→i (t) − βki φk→i (t), (12)
where ψ k→i (t) is the probability that k is in state E but
has not transmitted the infection signal to node i, and
φk→i (t) is the cavity probability (on a graph where node
i is absent - a cavity) that k is in state I but has not
transmitted the infection signal to node i up to time t.
The message φk→i decreases if node k transmits the
infection signal to node i or changes from state I into
state R; note that the two processes can occur at the
same time step. On the other hand, it increases if node
k changes from state E into I. Therefore, it is updated
according to


φk→i (t + 1) = 1 − βki 1 − µk φk→i (t)

+ 1 − αki νk ψ k→i (t).

(13)

Similarly, the message ψ k→i (t) decreases if node k
transmits the infection signal to node i or changes from
state E into state I, while it increases if node k changes
from state S into E. In computing the probability increment due to the latter case, one needs to exclude the contribution from node i to node k in the previous time steps
to avoid the eﬀect of mutual infection. This is achieved
through deﬁning
Y
θl→k (t),
(14)
PSk→i (t) = PSk (0)
l∈∂k\i

which is computed in the cavity graph assuming that
node i has been removed. Then the message ψ k→i (t)
follows the update rule

Upon

the
messages
{θk→i (t), φk→i (t), ψ k→i (t), PSi→j (t)} from the update
rules, the marginal probability PSi (t) can be obtained by
Eq. (11). The marginal probabilities of other states can
also be determined as

(18)

We assume that the nodes are either in susceptible or exposed states at time t = 0, such that the initial conditions
are solely determined by PSi (0) as
ψ i→j (0) = 1 − PSi (0),

(19)

θi→j (0) = φi→j (0) = 0,

(20)

PEi (0) = 1 − PSi (0),

(21)

PIi (0)

PRi (0)

= 0.

(22)

If node i is selected as the initial exposed node, the initial
condition is simply set as PEi (0) = 1, PSi (0) = PIi (0) =
PRi (0) = 0. Based on the initial data, the messages are
solved by updating the DMP Equations (12)-(15) forward in time, after which the marginal probabilities are
determined by Equations (11), (16), (17)and (18). The
computational complexity of the DMP algorithm is linear in the number of time steps and in number of edges
as O(|E|T ). Therefore, the DMP approach saves a signiﬁcant amount of computational resources compared to
Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, which requires many realizations to obtain reliable results. On the other hand, it
is more demanding than the IBMF approach which deals
with node-wise variables rather than edge-wise variables.
Nevertheless, if the network is sparse, i.e., the average
degree hdi = 2|E|/N ≪ N , then the DMP approach has
the same order of computational complexity as the IBMF
approach. This is relevant to the case of disease spreading as the number of close contacts each person has is
limited [31], except for super-spreaders.

Evaluation on Contact Networks

Here we evaluate the eﬀectiveness of the developed
theories on contact networks, which are either artiﬁcially generated or adapted from some realistic human
contact data. The realistic contact networks are taken
from data sets obtained in the SocioPatterns collaboration [32], where the temporal face-to-face human contacts
are projected to static contact networks as described in
Appendix D.

to. (b) Evolution of the average population of each state. The
parameters used are ν = 0.2, µ = 0.125, β = 0.016, α = β/2.
At time t = 0, there are 5 exposed nodes. The trajectories
predicted by the DMP approach (represented by lines) match
well with those from MC simulations (averaged over 104 realizations, represented by dots).

Many realistic contact networks exhibit community
structures. For instance, in workplaces, people usually
interacts more frequently with other people from the
same department compared to those from other departments; in schools, students from the same class also interacts more frequently. An exemplar contact network in
the workplace (WP2015) from the SocioPatterns data is
depicted in Fig. 1(a). We run the DMP algorithm for this
contact network by randomly selecting 5 nodes as the initial exposed nodes and iterating for T = 100 time steps.
The evolution of the population of each compartment is
shown in Fig. 1(b). The number of exposed or infected
cases ﬁrst rises and then decreases, and eventually dies
out when herd immunity is reached. The trajectories predicted by the DMP approach match well with those from
MC simulations in this case.
As another example, we evaluate the eﬃcacy of our
framework on random regular graphs, where all nodes
have the same degree and are connected randomly. Only
one node is selected as the initial exposed node, and the
system is simulated for T = 30 time steps. The results are
shown in Fig. 2, exhibiting a much better approximation
accuracy of the DMP approach compared to IBMF. Due
to the eﬀect of mutual infection, both IBMF and DMP
tend to overestimate the outbreak.
In Fig. 3, we systematically compare the results between theories and MC simulation, showing that DMP
provides a much better approximation than the IBMF
approach. It is found that the prediction errors of both
theoretical approaches generally increase with the epidemiological parameter β, and also depend on the number of initial exposed nodes. Intuitively, large values of β
lead to larger growth rates of the infections, in which case
a small approximation error in early time steps could be
ampliﬁed in late times. For large β, the prediction errors typically decrease as the number of initial exposed
nodes increases. One possible reason is that the infections
spread out from a unique source are correlated, so that
the independence assumption in the IBMF and DMP ap-

Linearized Dynamics of the DMP Equations

The fate of the spreading processes depends on the epidemiological parameters. For large transmission probabilities β and α, the disease can spread out to a large
fraction of the network, while it tends to die out quickly
for small transmission probabilities. There exist thresholds for these parameters, above which the epidemic outbreaks occur. One commonly used method to determine
epidemic thresholds is to examine whether the diseasefree state is linearly stable to small perturbations [9, 34].
Speciﬁcally, the initial disease-free state is perturbed
inﬁnitesimally as PSi (0) = 1 − ǫi ; if such perturbation
diverges, then the outbreak tend to spread out globally.
At the initial stage, the message θk→i (t), which denotes
the probability node k has not passed the infection signal
to node i, can also be expressed as θk→i (t) = 1 − δ k→i (t).
At time t + 1, we have

The prediction errors depend on the number of initial exposed
nodes and the epidemiological parameter β.

proaches deteriorates [33], e.g., the assumption that the
messages in Eq. (11) factorize does not hold strictly. On
the other hand, if there are multiple initial seeds that trigger the outbreak, the infection signals into a node will be
less correlated, which partly preserves the decorrelation
assumption.
The network topology also impacts on the approximation accuracy of the theories as shown in Appendix E. As
mentioned before, DMP avoids the mutual infection by
excluding one step backtracking interaction, it does not
take into account mutual infections due to backtracking
of multiple steps, which can be non-negligible in networks
with many short loops. In Appendix E, we ﬁnd that the

where I is the 2|E|-dimensional identity matrix. The
spectral radius ρ(J ) of the Jacobian J determines the
growth rate of the fastest mode of the linearized dynamics. The appearance of the NB matrix B in the linearized
dynamical equation is rooted in the fact that the one-step
backtracking infection is excluded in the DMP equations
(e.g., through Eq. (14)), therefore it also appears in other
algorithms for complex networks based on linearizing belief propagation, such as the applications in community
detection [36] and percolation [37].

B.

Spectral Properties of the Jacobian

The condition that ρ(J ) ≥ 1 corresponds to an exponential growth of the linearized dynamics in Eq. (28),
which implies that the disease is likely to spread out
globally. The solution of ρ(J ) = 1 marks the phase
boundary of the epidemiological parameters. Since the
matrix elements of J are non-negative, the PerronFrobenius theorem asserts that (i) its leading eigenvalue
λmax
(deﬁned as the eigenvalue having the largest real
J
part) equals its spectral radius ρ(J ) and therefore is
real and non-negative and (ii) there exists an eigenvector
with non-negative and nonzero elements corresponding
to λmax
[38].

In this way, we relate the dynamical properties of the
SEIR model to the epidemiological parameters and network structure properties, where the latter is subtly conveyed through the eigenvalue λmax
B . This is in contrast
to the growth rate given by the commonly used basic reproduction number R0 , deﬁned as the expected number
of secondary cases caused by a single randomly-selected
exposed individual when the rest of the population are
susceptible. In the SEIR model considered here, the R0
is estimated to be (see Appendix G)

which only depends on the averaged degree hdi, but neglects possible higher order structures of the contact networks. It has long been recognized that the R0 measure
is deﬁcient in network epidemiology [9, 26].
Another useful measure is the eﬀective reproduction
number R(t), which has a similar deﬁnition to R0 but is
based on the expected secondary infections to the remaining susceptible population at time t [19]. The network
structure and dynamical model play a role in determining R(t), as the real-time susceptible population needs to
be estimated, which is diﬃcult to carry out analytically.
In general, applying R(t) requires solving the dynamics
and it is more suitable as an indicator for monitoring the
spread (e.g., as in Ref. [39]), which diﬀers from the role
of R0 or the epidemic threshold as predictors.
The computation of the leading eigenvalue λmax
can be

is a large matrix if the underlying network is relatively

Intuitively speaking, the reduction of complexity comes
from compressing the edge-based data, e.g., φi→j (t) and
ψ i→j (t), to node-based data [36] as shown in Appendix H.
This allows us to work with networks of relatively large
sizes.

taken such that the outbreaks saturate and the ﬁnal state
of each node i is either susceptible or recovered. The fraction of nodes
P that have been infected is an order parameter r = i PRi (∞)/N deﬁning the phase transition from
localized infections to global epidemics. Since statistical

fraction of the systems nodes are aﬀected by the epidemic
outbreak above the critical point βc . In Fig. 4(b), we pinpoint the critical point βc from MC simulations through
the variability measure Cr , and compare them to those
obtained via the IBMF and the DMP approaches, where
it is observed that the DMP approach provides a much
better estimation. In Appendix H we observed that the
epidemic has a small probability to die out even for large
β, a behavior that also appears in the SIR model [41]

and may impact on the estimation of βc through simulations [29]. This is not captured by the theories which only
consider averaged quantities. It would be an interesting
future direction to study the deviations from the mean
behaviors [42] and possible heterogeneous structures [43].

VI. EXPLORING PHASE DIAGRAM AND THE
IMPACT OF INTERVENTION STRATEGIES

In this section, we explore phase diagrams in diﬀerent scenarios via the DMP approach and examine the
impact of some intervention strategies. Any speciﬁc intervention strategy will have an eﬀect on the system parameters, and therefore inﬂuence the dynamics. Here, we
primarily examine their impact on epidemic thresholds in
the asymptotic limit. In particular, we expect that various social distancing measures eﬀectively reduce β and
α. Some intervention strategies may inﬂuence the transmission probabilities β and α in diﬀerent manners, so
we consider the phase diagrams in parameter subspace
spanned by β and α, rather than keeping a ﬁxed ratio
between them.
The critical line separating the parameter regions of
localized infections and global outbreaks, obtained by

disease will die out only in region (I) in the SEIR model.
Particular caution is needed in region (II), where β is
small enough so that it is safe for the SIR model, but
the presymptomatic transmission is suﬃciently signiﬁcant (i.e., α > αc (β)) to cause a global epidemic.

Diseases with Different Incubation Periods

Similarly, when µ and λmax
are ﬁxed, varying ν will

only impact on the intersects of the phase boundaries
with the α-axis but not those with the β-axis, as seen
in Fig. 5(d). Physically, diﬀerent ν values correspond to
diseases with diﬀerent incubation periods. For smaller
ν, the exposed nodes have a longer time to infect their
neighbors, which makes it more diﬃcult to combat the
epidemic spreading.

Cases For α = 0 and β = 0

Consider the special case α = 0, solving αc (β) = 0
gives

which coincides with βcSIR . It indicates that the intersection of the two critical lines occurs at α = 0 (as shown
in Fig. 5(a)) is a general phenomenon. Physically, this
special case corresponds to the traditional SEIR model
where the exposed nodes are not infectious, which has
the same epidemic thresholds with the SIR model, irrespective of the incubation period 1/ν.

is independent of µ), as seen in Fig. 5(b). Physically,
since diﬀerent values of µ represent diﬀerent recovery
rates, increasing µ can be eﬀectively realized by isolating
all nodes in state I before they recover. If such a policy can be executed strictly and timely, it corresponds
to a large µ that can signiﬁcantly expand the parameter
region of the epidemic-free phase, leaving a lot of ﬂexibility in implementing social distancing measures (i.e.,
many usual social interactions can still be allowed). Nevertheless, if the presymptomatic transmission probability
α is large enough, e.g., α > αSEIR
|β=0 , then isolating the
c
patients in state I alone is insuﬃcient to slow down the
spread; in this case, identifying nodes in state E through
contact tracing or mass testing, and/or implementing
stricter social distancing measure become necessary.

D.

Approximation of the Phase Boundary

Finally, although the phase boundary αc (β) of the
SEIR model is in general nonlinear, the cases considered
in Fig. 5 exhibit an almost linear relation, except for a
very small λmax
B . This can be seen more explicitly in
the limit of large λmax
B , where one of the suﬃcient conditions is that the network has a large average degree (e.g.,
λmax
= d − 1 in random regular graphs), and requires the
B
transmission probability β and α to be small enough for
the disease to die out. Under the condition of large λmax

and small β, Eq. (38) can be approximated as

Equation (42) explains the phenomena shown in Fig. 5(c)
that when ν and µ are ﬁxed but λmax

epidemic-free region expands, but the slope of the phase
boundary remains roughly unchanged. Physically, reducing λmax
can be achieved by limiting the number of conB
tacts between nodes, as will be shown in Sec. VIII.

be obtained by the condition R0 = 1, where R0 satisﬁes

VII. PREDICTION OF OUTBREAK PROFILE
BY THE NONBACKTRACKING CENTRALITY

Similar to the eigenvalues, the eigenvectors of the Jacobian matrix also provide valuable information on the
dynamics. Consider
P the eigen-decomposition of the Jacobian as J = a λaJ ξ a (ξ −1 )a , and note that the messages can be decomposed
using the eigenvectors as bases,
 P
i.e., ψ(t), φ(t) = a ca (t)ξ a . In light of the linearized
dynamics, the component cmax (t) corresponding to the
max
leading eigenvalue λmax
> 1
J , will dominate when λJ
as the system evolves. Therefore, we can use the leading eigenvector ξ max of the Jacobian J to predict the


outcome ψ(T ), φ(T ) of the dynamics.
According to Eq. (31), the two components of ξ max =
(ũ, ṽ) are proportional to each other, i.e., ṽ ∝ ũ. Thus,
it is suﬃcient to examine one component only. In what
follows, we consider ũ, which is the leading eigenvector
of the NB matrix B according to Eqs. (32) and (33).
Furthermore, we are ultimately interested in the marginal
probabilities, which relate to the incoming messages to
each node as seen in Eq. (11). In the linearized dynamics,
the probability of newly infection of node i is given by
PSi (t) − PSi (t + 1) ≈

X

k∈∂i


αψ k→i (t) + βφk→i (t) . (44)

Therefore, we need to consider the incoming vector of the
leading eigenmode ũ

which is known as the nonbacktracking centrality [45].
Interestingly, in addition to the leading eigenvalue λmax
B ,
the NB centrality ũin can be obtained through the much
smaller matrix M [36] as shown in Appendix H. The NB
centrality has been shown to play an important role in
percolation and SIR model in networks [37, 43, 46].

evolves. Thus, we can use ũin to predict the relative
strengths of the outbreak, indicated by {1 − PSi (t)}. Figure 6(a) demonstrates that, for β large enough, the evolution of correlation coeﬃcient ρ between ũin and the
proﬁle of the outbreak on the WP2015 network generally
increases with time. For small β = 0.002, the correlation
remains low as the disease will die out. For a rather large
β = 0.016, the correlation coeﬃcient ρ increases rapidly
in the initial stage of the development of the spreading,
and then decreases to a lower level. This is because for a
very large β, most nodes are likely to be infected eventually, irrespective of the spatial structure of the network.
As shown in Fig. 6(b), such relation between ρ and β is
also observed in other networks, including a graph generated by a stochastic block model (SBM) and a scale-free
network (SF) with degree exponent γ = 2 (details of the
networks will be discussed in Sec. VIII).
Similarly, the IBMF approach dictates that the leading eigenvector of the adjacency matrix A (known as
the eigenvector centrality [45]) is a predictor of the outbreak proﬁle [28]. Comparison between diﬀerent centrality measures is brieﬂy discussed in Appendix E, where the
NB centrality generally provides a better prediction than
the eigenvector centrality. As was mentioned before, the
DMP approach only avoids the eﬀect of mutual infection
due to one-step backtracking, and the approximation accuracy can deteriorate if counteracting the eﬀect of onestep backtracking is insuﬃcient. This is of particular concern when the NB centrality ũin displays the localization

are much larger than the others [45, 47]. In Appendix E
we demonstrated the degradation of the approximation
power of the DMP equations and the NB centrality in
random networks with a relatively large planted clique
(i.e., a complete subgraph), which possesses the localization property [45]; we also observed a poor approximation accuracy in one of the contact networks from the
SocioPatterns data, recorded in a high school in 2013
(HS2013) [48], where the NB centrality ũin is more localized on a few communities.
VIII.

EFFECT OF REDUCING CONTACTS

In addition to the social distancing rules that lower
the transmission probabilities β and α, reducing social
contacts between individuals is also an eﬀective measure to slow down the spread of the disease. We examine its eﬀects in the static contact networks considered
here, by removing edges between nodes. Such a measure
will change the network structure and reduce the leading
eigenvalue λmax
of the matrix B, which can enlarge the
B
epidemic-free region in the parameter space as shown in
Fig. 5(c). In general, the leading eigenvalue λmax
can

depend intricately on the network structure. In the special case of conﬁguration model where the node degrees
follow a given distribution P (d) and the nodes are wired
randomly, it is found in Refs. [36, 45] that λmax
can be
B
approximated as
λmax
≈
B

hd2 i − hdi
,
hdi

(46)

which already indicates that even in the high degree limit,
the epidemic thresholds obtained by R0 in Eq. (43) do
not generally coincide with those obtained in the DMP
approach in Eq. (42). Speciﬁcally, the second moment
of the degree distribution is also relevant for epidemic

thresholds in uncorrelated random networks [9], which is
not captured by Eq. (43). A more reﬁned approximation
taking into account the relation of degrees of neighboring nodes is given in Ref. [47]. The accuracy of these
approximations depends on the validity of the uncorrelated random network assumption and/or the presence of
localization of NB centrality [47] (see also Appendix H 4).
Due to the dilution of connections between nodes,
a network may become disconnected, resulting in fragmented components [49]; if such cases happen, we keep
the largest connected component in the following experiment. In Fig. 7(a), Erdős–Rényi (ER) random graphs
and networks generated via a stochastic block model
(SBM) are considered. A network generated by SBM
has 4 communities, where each community comprises
50 nodes; node i in community a is connected to cab
nodes of community b on average. Here, we consider
cab = 4, ∀a 6= b and caa = 10, ∀a 6= 1, while diﬀerent values of c11 are considered. When c11 = 10, all four communities are statistically equivalent, and the node degrees
follow a Poisson distribution, similar to the ER random
graphs. For such Poisson random graphs, λmax
≈ hdi
B
according to Eq. (46), which is justiﬁed experimentally
by the numerical results of Fig. 7(a). On the other hand,
λmax
deviates from hdi in SBM networks with c11 > 0.
B
The networks become sparser when edges are removed
randomly, and λmax
decreases linearly with hdi. A quasiB
linear decreasing trend is also observed in the random
edge removal experiments in contact networks from the
SocioPatterns collaboration as shown in Fig. 7(b), as well
as in scale-free networks where the node degrees follow

shown in Fig. 7(c).
of scale-free
In Fig. 7(c), the leading eigenvalues λmax
B
networks can deviate signiﬁcantly from hdi, especially
for more heterogeneous networks with a small γ value.
Therefore, predicting the cause of the spread through
R0 becomes very unreliable in scale-free networks, an effect which has been observed in network epidemiology
studies [9]. Physically, there exist a small number of
hubs (i.e., nodes with very large degrees) in scale-free
networks, which can be viewed as super-spreaders that
signiﬁcantly facilitate the spread of the disease. In light
of this, restricting contacts of these high-degree nodes
preferentially can eﬀectively reduce λmax
as shown in
B
Fig. 7(d), and consequently lower the epidemic thresholds.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK

In this paper, we studied the SEIR model with
presymptomatic transmissions, a feature of the COVID19 disease, in both artiﬁcial and realistic contact networks through the dynamic message-passing method.
The DMP approach provides a much better approximation compared to the IBMF approach while being much
less computationally demanding than MC simulations,

to the epidemic thresholds and phase diagrams of the
models, where their dependence on epidemiological parameters and the network structure are elucidated. A
larger presymptomatic transmission probability value α
leads to a lower critical point βc , which makes the strategy of blocking only symptomatic transmission less effective. We also show that diﬀerent intervention strategies impact on the epidemic thresholds in diﬀerent manners. The inﬂuence of network structure on the epidemic
thresholds is represented by the leading eigenvalue λmax
B
of the nonbacktracking matrix B, which encodes more
subtle structural information in contrast to the average

number of contacts hdi appearing in the basic reproduction number R0 . Additionally, we demonstrated that
the nonbacktracking centrality ũin related to the leading eigenvector of the matrix B can eﬀectively predict
the relative strength of the outbreak.
On the other hand, it is worthwhile mentioning some
limitations of the DMP method. Firstly, as the DMP
approach is based on the decorrelation assumption of the
infection signals, it may become a less accurate approximation when the correlations between trajectories are
non-negligible, which can happen when there is a single
initial exposed node seeding the dynamics and/or there
are many short loops in the network. Second, the approximation accuracy of the DMP approach also deteriorates
when counteracting the one-step backtracking reaction is
insuﬃcient to avoid the eﬀect of mutual infection; this
eﬀect has been observed in networks where the nonbacktracking centrality exhibits a localization phenomenon as
shown in Appendix E. It is an interesting future direction
to further characterize the condition of nonbacktracking
centrality localization, its impact on spreading processes
and possible improvements [47].
‘The theoretical frameworks were mostly applied to
contact networks in some speciﬁc scenarios or those exhibiting particular characteristics, such as the presence
of community structure or high-degree hubs. The applications on a wider scale (e.g., in a city) require considering additional network characteristics, such as the
mixing pattern of diﬀerent age groups [31], the household structure, and so on [53]. Additional states, such as
hospitalized and dead, can also be considered in order to
model the pressure on public-health services and social
cost. Since presymptomatic transmissions make it more
diﬃcult to contain the disease by dealing with the symptomatic cases only, an extension of particular interest is
to examine the eﬀectiveness and limitation of (manual
or digital) contact tracing [39, 54, 55], mass testing and
other strategies which can identify exposed individuals
that have not shown symptoms. The DMP equations developed here will also beneﬁt future works which aim at
optimal deployment of resources (e.g., vaccines) to contain the spread of epidemics with presymptomatic transmissions [30, 33, 56].

Appendix A: Deriving DMP Equations From Dynamic Belief Propagation
1.

Belief Propagation Equations of Trajectories

In this Appendix, we derive the DMP equations from the principled dynamic belief propagation established in
Ref. [16]. It is based on the message mi→j (~σi |~σj ), which is the cavity probability of the dynamical trajectory
~σi = [σi0 , ..., σiT ] (where σit ∈ {S, E, I, R}) of node i in the cavity graph in which node j has been removed. Since
the transition between states is irreversible (only permitted in the order S → E → I → R), the trajectory ~σi can be
parametrized by three transition times (τi , ωi , εi ) as ~σi = |S0 SSEτi EEIωi IIIRεi RRT i.
The dynamic belief propagation for the modiﬁed SEIR model takes the following form
mi→j (τi , ωi , εi |τj , ωj , εj ) =

which closes the DMP equations.

Appendix B: Modeling Asymptomatic Transmission

As for the COVID-19 epidemic, there are patients who remain asymptomatic prior to recovery. Here, we discuss
how to accommodate potential disease transmissions due to having asymptomatic individuals in our framework.
Patients who do not exhibit symptoms at the time of exposure but developed symptoms at a later time are termed
presymptomatic as described in the main text. There are many possible scenarios to model asymptomatic infections.
One example is that each individual has a certain probability to become either asymptomatic or presymptomatic upon
contracting the virus, in which case an additional asymptomatic state is required to model such stochastic transitions.
The DMP equations can be derived accordingly, but will diﬀer from those in this study.
Another perspective is based on the observation that whether an exposed individual will develop symptoms or not
seems to vary from person to person, based on age and pre-existing medical condition, e.g., children are more likely
to have mild or no symptoms [24]. In light of this, one can assign each node i a label ℓi (either probabilistically or
according to additional existing information information), such that ℓi = 1 if the individual is expected to develop
symptoms when exposed and ℓi = 0 otherwise. Nodes with diﬀerent labels may have diﬀerent epidemiological
parameters. The disease transmission dynamics still obeys the transition rules of Sec. II, and the DMP equations
in Sec. III B also apply. The only diﬀerence is that when a node i is in state I, one should interpret it as infected
with symptoms if ℓi = 1, or asymptomatic if ℓi = 0. In this way, our theoretical framework can readily accommodate
asymptomatic transmission, except that a weighted-version of nonbacktracking is needed to accommodate diﬀerent
characteristics of symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals.

Appendix C: Modeling Non-contagious presymptomatic Period in SCEIR Model

Another extension of the model is to take into account a possible non-contagious presymptomatic state when the
viral load is too small to infect others. To accommodate this eﬀect, we introduce an additional compartment called
contracted (C) and deﬁne the corresponding SCEIR model. In this model, an individual in state S (say node i) who
contracts the virus will ﬁrstly assume state C (non-contagious and non-symptomatic), after which that person will
turn into state E (contagious and non-symptomatic) with rate λi , and subsequently to states I and R with rates νi
and µi , respectively. Similar to the SEIR model, we also denote the transmission probabilities from node j in state E
(state I) to a susceptible node i as αji (βji ).
Following a similar derivation from dynamic belief propagation as above, the DMP equations for the SCEIR model
admit the following form

Appendix D: Contact Networks
1.

Realistic Networks

The realistic contact networks are taken from data sets obtained from the SocioPatterns collaboration website [32],
where the face-to-face contacts were recorded through wearable sensors over a certain period. Each data set contains
a lists of active contacts between two individuals lasting for 20 seconds and the membership information of each
individual (belonging to a class or department). To build the contact network, we ﬁrst aggregate the contacts
between any two individuals i and j, and consider the link between node i and node j as active if the cumulative
contact duration between them in the recording period is not less than 60 seconds. A more precise treatment is to
retain the information of contact duration in the transmission probabilities βji , αji . However, this results in a graph
with a weighted nonbacktracking (NB) matrix, which complicates the analysis. For simplicity, we only preserve the
topological information of the resulting networks, keeping in mind that the contact duration information can also be
incorporated in our framework. In this paper, we consider contact networks in a primary school (PS2014) [50], a high
school (HS2013) [48] and workplaces (WP2013, WP2015) [51, 52].

Artificial Networks

Artiﬁcially generated networks are also considered in this paper, including Erdős–Rényi (ER) random graphs, random networks with community structures, scale-free networks and random networks with planted subgraph structures.
a.

Random Networks with Community Structure

Random networks with community structures are generated through the stochastic block model. It is speciﬁed by a
list of population of each block (n1 , n2 , ..., nr ) and a r × r symmetric probability matrix Pab , where r is the number of
blocks. Suppose node i is assigned to block a and node j is assigned to block b, then node i and node j are connected
with probability Pab . The average number of neighbors of node i (assigned to block a) belonging to block b is given
by
(
Paa (na − 1) if a = b,
cab =

otherwise.

Scale-free Networks

The scale-free networks are generated through the conﬁguration model. We ﬁrst generate a degree sequence
(d1 , d2 , ..., dN ) of size N where each element follows the power law distribution
d−γ
P (di ) = Pdmaxi

dj =dmin

d−γ

,

(D2)

where dmin and dmax are the minimum and maximum of the admissible degrees. In this study, we set dmin = 5 and
dmax = 100, considering the maximal number of people that one contacts can not be arbitrarily large. After assigning
a degree to each node, we randomly connect diﬀerent nodes such that each node i has di connections. The resulting
graph may have a few self-loops and multiple edges between two nodes, which are simply removed to form a simple
graph.
c.

Random Networks with Planted Subgraph Structures

We also look at random networks with planted subgraph structures, primarily for the purpose of examining the
eﬀect of localization. Following [45], we consider the ER random graph (with average degree hdi) with a planted hub
(of degree dh ), which is constructed by adding a hub to the existing ER network through creating connections from the
hub to dh randomly selected nodes. When dh is large enough, i.e., dh > hdi(hdi + 1), it is argued that the eigenvector
centrality (i.e., the leading eigenvector of the adjacency matrix) is localized at the hub, while the nonbacktracking

a random regular graph with N = 100, d = 10. The parameters are T = 100, ν = 0.2, µ = 0.125, β = 0.03, α = β/2. The initial

centrality does not suﬀer from localization [45]. The intuition behind the localization of eigenvector centrality is that
the hub and its neighbors are reinforcing each other, similar to the mutual infection eﬀect of the IBMF approach to
epidemic spreading. The NB centrality avoids this problem due to the hub by forbidding one-step backtracking.
On the other hand, it is noticed in [45] that a relatively large clique (i.e., a complete subgraph) can cause the NB
centrality to localize as well. Therefore, we consider the ER random graph (with average degree hdi) with a planted
clique (of size Nclique ), which is constructed by randomly selecting Nclique nodes of the existing ER network to form
a complete subgraph. For the original ER graph, the leading eigenvalue of the NB matrix B is given by λmax
≈ hdi.
B
In the presence of the clique, the leading eigenvalue satisﬁes λmax
> Nclique − 2, which can easily exceed hdi for
B
large Nclique , so that the NB centrality is dictated by the clique [45]. There are also other subgraph structures that
can cause the NB centrality to localize, such as dense subgraphs and overlapping hubs [47]. The intuition behind
the localization of the NB centrality is that there is a subgraph sharing many neighbors, and avoiding one-step
backtracking is insuﬃcient to counteract the self-reinforcement among them.

Appendix E: Additional Experiments
1.

Approximation Accuracy of the Theory on Different Networks

In this Appendix, we give more examples of spreading processes experiments to support the ﬁndings in the main
text. In Fig. 8, it is shown that the approximation accuracy of the theories improves as the number of initial exposed
nodes increases; we expect that it also depends on the locations of the initial seeds.
In Fig. 9, we examine the theoretical results on ER random networks with diﬀerent average degrees and/or diﬀerent
planted subgraph structures. We remark that there is no absolute fair comparison among diﬀerent networks, as they
have diﬀerent dependencies on the epidemiological parameters (e.g., as in Fig. 3 of the main text). Here, we ﬁx the
values of ν, µ and let α = β/2, and choose β such that approximately 70% of the population have contracted the
disease in the ﬁnal time T = 100. Fig. 9 demonstrates that the IBMF approach becomes a better approximation when
the network is denser. This implies that the DMP approach is superior to the IBMF approach, especially in sparsely
connected networks. When the average degree becomes higher, the trajectories obtained by the IBMF equations are
approaching those by the DMP equations. In the limit of very dense random networks, the mass-action approximation
becomes a good approximation [9]. As mentioned before, a planted hub of relatively large degree can cause the leading
eigenvector of the adjacency matrix A to localize [45], which impairs the accuracy of the IBMF approach. We show
in Fig. 9(b) that such a planted hub does not have a noticeable eﬀect on the approximation accuracy of the DMP
approach. However, a planted clique which can cause the nonbacktracking centrality to localize [45, 47], does impair
the approximation accuracy of the DMP approach, as shown in Fig. 9(c).
In Fig. 9, we examine the theories on the networks extracted from contact data obtained in the SocioPatterns
collaboration. The approximation accuracy of the HS2013 network is much poorer than the other networks, which
may be attributed to the weakly localization of the nonbacktracking centrality as shown in Fig. 13.

Evolution and Distribution of the Epidemic Outbreak

P
In Fig. 4 of the main text, the normalized outbreak size at large time r = i PRi (∞)/N was used to identify the
critical point βc of the SEIR model. In Fig. 10(a), we show the transient evolution
of the normalized outbreak size,
P
which is deﬁned by the fraction of nodes that has contracted the disease as 1 − i PSi (t)/N . The normalized outbreak
size increases only gently near criticality, while it grows rapidly above the critical point βc .
As the epidemic outbreaks are triggered by a few initial seeds, there is always a small probability that the disease
will die out before spreading out further (e.g., the infected node transforming into state R much faster than average,
or the infection signal not being transmitted to neighbors). This can also happen when β > βc , indicating that there
are some instances where the outbreak size is small although the system is in the global-epidemic phase, as shown in
Fig. 10(b). This phenomenon has been observed in the SIR model [29, 41]. While the theoretical frameworks only
concern the average behaviors, they do not capture such variability of trajectories due to stochastic ﬂuctuations. A
detailed theoretical investigation into these aspects will be an interesting topic for future studies.

3.

Nonbacktracking Centrality

As mentioned in the main text and in Sec. E 1, the degradation in accuracy of the approximation of the theory
(IBMF or DMP method) is correlated with the localization phenomenon of the corresponding centrality measure,
where the centrality values of a few nodes are much larger than the others. We have showcased this in Fig. 9
by considering some planted subgraph structures in a random network. We further examine the prediction of the
centrality measures on the outbreak proﬁles in these planted random networks. In Fig. 11(a), it is shown that in
the ER graph, both the eigenvector centrality and the NB centrality (coming from the linear approximation of the
IBMF and DMP approaches), as well as the degree, are good predictors of the outbreak proﬁle, despite the poor
approximation of the full nonlinear IBMF approach in Fig. 9(a). On the other hand, a planted hub causing the
eigenvecter centrality to localized, degrades its prediction accuracy as shown in Fig. 11(b), while the NB centrality
appears to be a much better predictor. In the presence of a clique, the NB centrality also predicts the outbreak poorly
as shown in Fig. 11(c) due to the localization phenomenon.
In all three cases, the degree appears to be a good predictor of the outbreak proﬁle; in random networks, having
more neighbors usually implies a higher chance to contract the disease. However, this does not hold in general, e.g.,
consider a hub connected to many dangling nodes but linked to the bulk of the network through only a few edges,
such a hub node is not likely to be at high risk as indicated by its degree.
It has been shown in Fig. 12 that the approximation accuracy of the HS2013 network is much poorer than the other
networks from the SocioPatterns data sets. In Fig. 13, we show the NB centralities on the corresponding networks.
Comparing to other networks, the NB centrality ũin of HS2013 concentrates on two communities, which may cause
the approximation of the DMP equations to be less accurate.

Perron-Frobenius Theorem

For a non-negative matrix X which satisﬁes Xij ≥ 0, the Perron-Frobenius (PF) theorem asserts that (i) the
spectral radius ρ(X) is an eigenvalue of X, which implies that the leading eigenvalue of X (deﬁned as the eigenvalue
having the largest real part) satisﬁes λmax
= ρ(X), which is real and non-negative and (ii) there is a nonnegative and
X
nonzero vector u (satisfying ui ≥ 0, u 6= 0) such that Xu = ρ(X)u; more properties of the leading eigenvalue and
eigenvector can be deduced if the matrix X is irreducible [38].

Fig. 14.

Epidemic Threshold by the IBMF Approach

Similar to the DMP approach, we can also derive the epidemic thresholds through the individual-based mean-ﬁeld
(IBMF) approach. The initial disease-free state is perturbed inﬁnitesimally as PSi (0) = 1 − ǫi , in which case the
probabilities PEi (t) and PIi (t) are also of order ǫi in the initial stage. We expand Eq. (8) and neglect terms of higher
order of ǫi , leading to

Appendix G: Basic Reproduction Number of The SEIR Model

In this appendix, we provide a simple estimation of the basic reproduction number R0 for the SEIR model under
investigation, which is deﬁned as the expected number of secondary infections from a single infection in a population
where all subjects are susceptible. We assume at time t = 0, a node randomly chosen from the network is exposed to
the virus. The exposed node has hdi susceptible neighbors on average; the average number of neighbors it infects is
computed as

Reduction from Matrix B to Matrix M

where IN is the N -dimensional identity matrix. The reduction to Eq. (H1) is a manifest of the Ihara-Bass formula [57],
where an intuitive derivation of the reduction can be found in Ref. [36]. The Ihara-Bass formula has also been
generalized to weight graphs and linked to Bethe free energy in belief propagation [40], which is relevant in our study
when heterogeneous transmission probabilities {βij , αij } are considered.
For completeness, we provide a derivation using the matrix notation in this section. To this end, we deﬁne the

the context of spreading processes, they correspond to edge-based messages and node-based marginal probabilities,

In the main text, it is argued that the leading eigenvector of the matrix B (denoted as ũ), and the corresponding
incoming vector ũin = T ũ (i.e., the nonbacktracking centrality), are useful in predicting the outcome of the epidemics.
From the analysis in this section, both the leading eigenvalue λmax
and the nonbacktracking centrality ũin can be
B
obtained through the matrix M , which signiﬁcantly reduces the computational complexity. The Perron-Frobenius
theorem guarantees that the leading eigenvector ũ of the matrix B can be chosen to be non-negative, so does the
nonbacktracking centrality ũin .

Exact Expression in Random Regular Graphs

The leading eigenvalue of the matrix M can be computed exactly for random regular graphs. We ﬁrst notice that
the smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix L = D − A of a graph is λmin
= 0 [58]. For regular graphs with degree
L
d, we have D = dI, and therefore L commutes with A. It suggests that the largest eigenvalue of A is
λmax
= d.

Approximations of the λmax
in Uncorrelated Random Networks
B

For uncorrelated random networks, approximate expressions of the leading eigenvalue λmax
can be derived, which
B
can be useful for estimating epidemics properties in large networks. In the annealed approximation where only the
information of the degree distribution P (d) is retained, λmax
is approximated as [36, 45]
B
λmax,an
≈
B

hd2 i − hdi

(H24)

In a more reﬁned approximation assuming uncorrelated networks but taking into neighborhood information, λmax
is

approximated as [47]
P

max,un
P

(H25)
λB
≈
i di (di − 1)

To examine the validity of the uncorrelated random network assumption, we consider the degree correlation coeﬃcient [49]
max

rd = 2
kl(ekl − qk ql ),
σ

(H26)

k,l=1

where ekl is the element of the degree correlation matrix (i.e., the probability of ﬁnding an edge connecting two nodes
(k)
of degree k and degree l), qk = kPhdi
(with P (k) being the degree distribution) is the probability of ﬁnding an edge
Pdmax 2 2
Pdmax
is the variance of the measure q. The neutrality
whose one end has degree k, and σ 2 = k=1 k 2 qk −
k=1 k qk
condition rd = 0 needs to be (at least roughly) satisﬁed for a network to be uncorrelated.
In Table. I, we examine the approximations oﬀered by Eqs (H24) and (H25) for the networks considered in this
paper. In general, λmax,un
provides a better approximation than λmax,an
, both of which predict λmax
quite well

B
when rd is low. The two cases with a relatively poor approximation (especially for λmax,an
)
are
the
SBM
network
B
with c11 = 30 and the ER network with a clique. These two networks exhibit high values of the degree correlation
coeﬃcient rd , violating the assumption of uncorrelated random network. On the other hand, the existence of dense
subgraph structures can cause localization of the NB centrality, which also makes the approximation inaccurate. In
light of this, it has been proposed in Ref. [47] to identify some characteristic subgraph structures for an improved
approximation of λmax
B .
