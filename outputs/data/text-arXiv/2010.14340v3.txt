Nonparametric estimation of highest density
regions for COVID-19
P. Saavedra-Nieves

Abstract
Highest density regions refer to level sets containing points of relatively high density. Their estimation from a random sample, generated from the underlying density,
allows to determine the clusters of the corresponding distribution. This task can be
accomplished considering different nonparametric perspectives. From a practical
point of view, reconstructing highest density regions can be interpreted as a way of
determining hot-spots, a crucial task for understanding COVID-19 space-time evolution. In this work, we compare the behavior of classical plug-in methods and a
recently proposed hybrid algorithm for highest density regions estimation through
an extensive simulation study. Both methodologies are applied to analyze a real data
set about COVID-19 cases in the United States.

Introduction

As noted by the World Health Organization (WHO)1 , coronavirus disease usually known
as COVID-19 is an infectious pathology caused by a newly discovered virus. Most people infected experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment, elderly people, and those with severe medical problems such as
cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely
to develop serious illness.
The origin of the virus is located in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China at the end
of 2019. China officially reported a total of 84025 cases and 4637 deaths in May 2020.
European and American governments were unable to stop its fast expansion due to its
high degree of contagiousness. In fact, the WHO on March 11th, declared the coronavirus a global pandemic. Figure 1 in Section 1 of Supplementary Material (SM) shows
the daily evolution of COVID-19 confirmed cases distribution around the world from
January 22nd and May 5th through an interactive map. The area of each red circle is
proportional to the number of new confirmed cases. It was elaborated from available
data on a GitHub repository2 of Johns Hopkins University 3 . It should be noted that
confirmed cases include presumptive positive cases and probable cases, in accordance
with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention4 guidelines as of April 2020.

The capacity of health systems has been overwhelmed in many countries, and COVID19 became a public health problem. One of the most difficult issues to deal with was the
lack of personal protective equipments for medical staff leading to a considerable number of infections among them. Shortage of disease tests or masks to be used by population in order to avoid the increases of infections were other important questions that
authorities had to solve. More efficient solutions to manage the expansion of the virus
could be provided by public entities of a country if areas where coronavirus incidence
is extremely high were detected. In particular, real-time evolution analysis of these subpopulations or clusters would provide useful information to rule decisions such as prioritize the supply of sanitary material in a specific time moment or facilitate masks to the
populations that lives in zones where an incidence peak of the virus is observed. Therefore, estimating regions where the coronavirus incidence is remarkably high is one of
the main aims of this work. Mathematically, this can be seen as a density level set estimation problem. Formally, given a random sample of points Xn “ tX1 , ¨ ¨ ¨ , Xn u from
a density f , level set estimation theory deals with the problem of reconstructing, for a
given level t ą 0, the unknown set
Gptq “ tx P Rd : f pxq ě tu.

(1)

Hartigan (1975) puts forward the idea of connecting the concept of clusters with the connected components of the level set defined in (1). The generalization of this definition
in the directional setting and for general manifolds can be found in Saavedra-Nieves
and Crujeiras (2020) and Rinaldo et al. (2010), respectively. Note that the number of
these clusters is usually smaller than the number of modes (local maxima of f ). These
two concepts are closely related although due to its geometrical nature, the concept of
cluster is generally easier to handle. One non-minor problem of the definition in (1) is
that it relies on the user-specified level t and which poses some drawbacks for practical
purposes. Additionally, the areas of the distribution support where f is close to zero

deserve less interest since the probability of finding observations from the underlying
distribution is usually very low. Then, an alternative definition for density level sets
is considered next. Given τ P p0, 1q, it is defined the highest density region (HDR) of
probability 1 ´ τ as the level set
Lpτq “ tx P Rd : f pxq ě f τ u
where

f ptqdt ě 1 ´ τ .

f τ “ sup y P p0, 8q :

Gpyq

Equation (3) shows that f τ is equal to the largest threshold such that the set Lpτq has
a probability greater than or equal to 1 ´ τ with respect to the distribution induced by
f . Note that Lpτq is equal to the minimum volume level set with probability content at
least 1 ´ τ, see Polonik (1997) and Garcia et al. (2003). In practice, if Ĝptq denotes an
estimator of the level set Gptq defined in (1) obtained from Xn , f τ can be estimated as
fˆτ “ maxtt ą 0 : Pn pĜptqq ě 1 ´ τu
where Pn denotes the empirical probability measure induced by Xn .
Figure 1 shows the geographical coordinates (slightly jittered) of confirmed cases of
coronavirus reported in the United States. This data set is also available in the GitHub
repository of Johns Hopkins University. As an illustration, contours of the HDRs have
been represented for different values of τ. Observe that the effective support of f is represented for values of τ close to zero. However, for higher values of τ, HDR coincides
with the domain concentrated around the greatest modes or τ´clusters of the distribution. Therefore, the largest incidence peaks of COVID-19 can be determined from τ
values close to one. Of course, HDRs could be also estimated globally at world level.
However, the lack of uniformity in data registers between countries and even between
different administrative divisions in a same country hampers the possibility of carrying
out a global analysis.

Figure 1 Contours of HDRs for τ “ 0 05 (left) τ “ 0 25 (center) and τ “ 0 5 (right)
Nonparametric estimation of HDRs has been considered in the statistical literature
from three different perspectives namely plug-in algorithms excess mass approaches
and hybrid methods See Rodrı́guez-Casal and Saavedra-Nieves (2019b) for a review
on this topic The most simple and common reconstruction is provided by plug-in algorithms Specifically they propose to estimate the HDR Lpτq as L̂pτq “ t f n ě fˆτ u where
f n is usually the kernel density estimator which is defined at point x as
ˆ
˙
n
x´X
1 ÿ
K
f n pxq “
H
nH d “1
where H is a bandwidth and K a kernel function According to Hyndman (1996) fˆτ
could be determined as the τ´quantile of f n pXn q In this work we will focus in the hybrid methodology which is a hybrid of a plug-in approach because it smooths Xn and
excess mass methods because it assumes some shape condition on the HDR to be reconstructed A classical hybrid method called granulometric smoothing method is proposed in Walther (1997) Designed for reconstructing HDRs it assumes that Lpτq and the
closure of its complement are both r´convex The geometric condition of r´convexity
is a much more flexible geometrical property than convexity as it will be shown later
In fact this shape property allows to consider more than one connected component
an interesting feature for practical purposes However the real value of r is usually
5

unknown as the theoretical HDR to be reconstructed. Rodrı́guez-Casal and SaavedraNieves (2019b) establish an alternative hybrid method for estimating HDRs also under
r´convexity assumptions but, unlike granulometric algorithm, suggesting a consistent
estimator of the parameter r which plays an important role on the geometry of the HDR.
Although satisfactory theoretical results have been obtained for this recent proposal, its
practical performance has not been checked yet. An extensive simulation study is carried out in this work to analyze its behavior. In addition, this method is used in practice
for estimating HDRs for COVID-19 in the United States on a weekly bases, providing a
space-time evolution description of the pandemic spread.
This paper is organized as follows. Some mathematical background is introduced in
Section 2. First, geometric assumptions on the HDR and the optimal value of r to be estimated from the sample Xn are discussed. Then, the main theoretical aspects of hybrid
method for reconstructing HDRs proposed in Rodrı́guez-Casal and Saavedra-Nieves
(2019b) are reviewed. In Section 3, we describe in detail the practical implementation
of the algorithm. In Section 4, the performance of this method will be checked through
simulations. Additionally, our proposal will be used in practice in order to reconstruct
HDRs for COVID-19 in Section 5. Then, the time and spatial evolution of its clusters can
be studied. Finally, conclusions are exposed in Section 6. Sections 1 and 2 of SM contain
interactive representations for the real data results.

Mathemathical tools

Usually required geometric assumptions on the HDRs and its nonparametric estimation will be reviewed next. In particular, the role of the usually unknown parameter r
will be discussed. Furthermore, the hybrid method proposed in Rodrı́guez-Casal and
Saavedra-Nieves (2019b) and its main theoretical aspects are briefly reviewed.

HDRs are assumed to be r´convex for some r ą 0 in Rodrı́guez-Casal and SaavedraNieves (2019b). Definition 2.1 establishes formally the definition of this geometric property.
Definition 2.1. A closed set A Ă Rd is said to be r´convex, for some r ą 0, if A “ Cr pAq,
where
Cr pAq “

č

pBr pxqqc

tBr pxq:Br pxqXA“Hu

denotes the r´convex hull of A and Br pxq, the open ball with center x and radius r, whereas T c
denotes the complementary of T.
In practice, Cr pXn q can be computed as the intersection of the complements of all
open balls of radius larger than or equal to r that do not intersect Xn . In particular, if r
is equal to infinity, Cr pAq is equal to the convex hull of A. In Figure 2, the computation
of Cr pXn q is shown considering the geographical coordinates of confirmed cases of coronavirus reported in the United States from March 26th to April 1st as Xn for r “ 1000,
r “ 10 and r “ 1. It is equal to the intersection of the complements of all black open balls
represented. Note that C1000 pXn q is practically equal to the convex hull. However, if we
select r “ 1, the number of connected components increases considerably. In fact, there
are multiple isolated points.
The parameter r can be seen as a shape index that controls the level of fragmentation
of the hull. Therefore, it plays the role of a smoothing parameter with a considerable
influence on the estimations. Hence, if a HDR is assumed to be r´convex and the subset
f

Xn p f τ q “ tXi P Xn : f pXi q ě f τ u inside the HDR was known, the most natural estimator
f

would be the r´convex hull of Xn p f τ q. It is the smallest r´convex set containing Xn .
f

However, r and Xn p f τ q are usually unknown in practice as the theoretical HDR Lpτq.
Then, estimating both of them from Xn are a first key step for reconstructing HDRs. As
regards r, it easy to check that if a set is r´convex then it will be also r˚ ´convex for all

0 ă r˚ ď r Then it is necessary to determine precisely which is the optimal value of r
to be estimated Rodrı́guez-Casal and Saavedra-Nieves (2019b) propose to estimate the
highest value of r which verifies that Lpτq is r´convex Concretely if Lpτq is a compact
nonempty nonconvex and r´convex HDR for some r ą 0 it is defined
r0 p f τ q “ suptγ ą 0 Cγ pLpτqq “ Lpτqu

(4)

Of course the definition in (4) depends on τ Moreover the case when Lpτq is convex is not considered because in such particular case r0 p f τ q is non finite Then the
most natural reconstruction of the HDR Lpτq would be the convex hull instead of the
r´convex hull Rodrı́guez-Casal and Saavedra-Nieves (2019b) also prove that under a
mild regularity condition Lpτq is r0 ptq´convex and therefore it is the optimal value to
be estimated This property which is also needed to guarantee the consistency results
for the HDR estimator is slightly stronger than r´convexity
(Rrλ ) A closed ball of radius λ ą 0 rolls freely in Gptq (inside) and a closed ball of
(Rrλ )radius r ą 0 rolls freely in Gptqc (outside)

Following Walther (1997) and Walther (1999), a closed ball of radius γ ą 0 rolls
freely in a closed set A if for each boundary point b P BA there exists x P Rd such that
b P Bγ rxs Ă A where Bγ rxs denotes the closed ball of radius γ centering at x.
Sets fulfilling property (Rrλ ) show interesting conditions which make them easier to
handle. For instance, their frontiers are smooth and, under the condition (Rrλ ), the rrolling condition implies the r´convexity. Following Cuevas et al. (2012), this is not true
in general.
Under several regularity assumptions on the density f and on its usual kernel density estimator f n , Rodrı́guez-Casal and Saavedra-Nieves (2019b) suggest to estimate consistently the unknown index r0 p f τ q as
r̂0 p fˆτ q “ suptγ ą 0 : Cγ pXn` p fˆτ qq X Xn´ p fˆτ q “ Hu,

(5)

where

Xn` p fˆτ q “ tX P Xn : f n pXq ě fˆτ ` Dn u, Xn´ p fˆτ q “ tX P Xn : f n pXq ă fˆτ ´ Dn u and
a.s

and Dn denotes a non negative sequence that verifies Dn Ñ 0 and that bounds the
quantity | f ´ f n |. In fact, Dn could be chosen as Dn “ Mn plogpnq{nq p{pd`2pq for Mn Ñ 8.
The original random sample Xn is divided into three subsamples, Xn` p fˆτ q, Xn´ p fˆτ q
´
¯
and Xn z X ` p fˆτ q Y X ´ p fˆτ q . Following Rodrı́guez-Casal and Saavedra-Nieves (2019b),
n

it can be checked that, given f τ ą 0, Xn` p f τ q and Xn´ p f τ q provide feasible information
on the HDR and its complementary, respectively. Then, it would be natural to consider
Cr̂0 p fˆτ q pXn` p fˆτ qq as an estimator for the HDR Lpτq. However, the consistency cannot
be guaranteed in this case, at least under general conditions. Then, Rodrı́guez-Casal
and Saavedra-Nieves (2019b) propose L̂pτq “ Crn p fˆτ q pXn` p fˆτ qq as the resulting estimator of the HDR where rn p fˆτ q “ νr̂0 p fˆτ q for a fixed value ν P p0, 1q. Remember that if
Lpτq is r´convex is also r˚ ´convex for 0 ă r˚ ď r and, therefore, it is verified that
Lpτq “ Cr pLpτqq “ Cr˚ pLpτqq. Then, it is expected that, for n large enough, Lpτq was
9

rn ptq´convex. Theorems 3.3 in Rodrı́guez-Casal and Saavedra-Nieves (2019b) shows
that this hybrid method achieves minimax rates for Hausdorff metric and distance in
measure, up to log factors, in most cases where the minimax rates are known, see Mammen and Tsybakov (1995). These distances between sets are commonly used in order to
assess the performance of set estimators calculating the distance between them and the
corresponding theoretical HDR. Let A and C be two closed, bounded, nonempty subsets
of Rd . The Hausdorff distance between A and C is defined by
#
+
d H pA, Cq “ max sup dpa, Cq, sup dpc, Aq ,
aPA

cPC

where dpa, Cq “ inft}a ´ c} : c P Cu and } } denotes the Euclidean norm. Another
possibility, if A and C are two bounded and Borel sets then the distance in measure
between A and C is defined by dµ pA, Cq “ µpA4Cq, where µ denotes the Lebesgue
measure and 4, the symmetric difference, that is, A4C “ pAzCq Y pCzAq.
Despite these satisfactory theoretical achievements, a practical implementation of
this method had to be proposed avoiding its dependency on the unknown sequence Dn .
Details on the algorithm established in Rodrı́guez-Casal and Saavedra-Nieves (2019b)
are discussed in what follows.

Hybrid algorithm for nonparametric HDRs estimation

The reconstruction of the HDR Lpτq from the random sample Xn relies strongly on the
specifications of the sets Xn` p fˆτ q and Xn´ p fˆτ q whose definitions involve the unknown
sequence Dn . According to Rodrı́guez-Casal and Saavedra-Nieves (2019b), it could be
any stochastic upper bound of the absolute difference between f and its kernel estimator
f n . Although this bounding problem is already considered in Hall et al. (2013) and Giné
et al. (2010), results obtained from simulations were not entirely satisfactory. Therefore,
10

an automatic bootstrap algorithm was established in Rodrı́guez-Casal and SaavedraNieves (2019b) for computing Dn focusing on the problem of HDRs reconstruction.
This hybrid procedure, fully described in Algorithm 1, is closely related to the definition of f τ established in (3). Given τ P p0, 1q, we will select the biggest value 0 ă τ ď τ
such that the associated HDR estimator contains a proportion of sample points bigger
than or equal to 1 ´ τ. Although the performance of this approach has not been checked
conveniently in practice, it avoids the direct estimation of the sequence Dn .
Following Rodrı́guez-Casal and Saavedra-Nieves (2019b), the reconstruction of HDR
corresponding to each τ is established from the subsets of Xn denoted by Xn` p fˆτ` q and

Xn´ p fˆτ´ q in Algorithm 1. Note that the corresponding thresholds fˆτ` and fˆτ´ are calculated from the bootstrap procedure described below.
˚ , ..., X ˚ of size n must be generSpecifically, a total of B bootstrap resamples X1,n
B,n

ated from f n . For each of these ones, the proportion of points inside and outside the
known region t f n ě p f n qτ u in the bootstrap world must be determined. In this work, the
threshold p f n qτ is calculated following the method proposed in Hyndman (1996). Given
p, τ ` and τ ´ are calculated from the B values of the probability contents of the HDR
and its complementary, respectively. Then, fˆτ` and fˆτ´ are determined as it is described
in Algorithm 1 and their selection is performed attending to the bootstrap probability
contents of the HDR and its complementary. If the proportion of points in Xn contained
in L̂pτq is greater than or equal to 1 ´ τ, the searching procedure is finished. Otherwise,
a smaller τ should be considered. Note that, Dn could be computed as the maximum
value between fˆτ` ´ fˆτ and fˆτ ´ fˆτ´ . Then, the direct estimation of the sequence Dn is
not necessary here.
Figure 3 shows the phases of Algorithm 1 when a HDR for τ “ 0.8 is estimated from
a random sample X1000 generated from a trimodal density that will be also consider as a
model for simulations in Section 4. In this illustration, B “ 100, p “ 0.05 and step“ 0.025

Figure 3: Phases of Algorithm 1 when a HDR Lpτq for τ “ 0.8 is estimated from a
random sample X1000 generated from a trimodal density. From phase 1 to phase 5,

Xn` p fˆτ` q and Cr̂0 p fˆτ q pXn` p fˆτ` qq are represented using green color; Xn´ p fˆτ´ q, using red color
and Xn zpXn` p fˆτ` q Y Xn´ p fˆτ´ qq, using gray color.
Note that phase 0 only shows the theoretical contours of the trimodal density for τ “ 0.8
(black color) and two additional smaller values (gray color) in order to describe the
density conveniently. Furthermore, it contains the random sample X1000 (black color)
used for reconstructing Lpτq. Apart from the theoretical HDR, next phases contains the
sets Xn` p fˆτ` q and Cr̂0 p fˆτ q pXn` p fˆτ` qq (green color), Xn´ p fˆτ´ q (red color) and Xn zpXn` p fˆτ` q Y

Xn´ p fˆτ´ qq (gray color). It is convenient to remember that the information on Lpτq and
its complementary is provided by the sets Xn` p fˆ` q and Xn´ p fˆ´ q, respectively. However,
τ

sample points in Xn zpXn p fˆτ q Y Xn p fˆτ qq can be considered as a non-informative doubt-

ful set. Although the connected components of the theoretical HDR are overestimated in
some areas, the algorithm succeeds in detecting the three greatest modes or τ´clusters
of the distribution.
The code of Algorithm 1 can be obtained from the author upon request. It should
be noted that R packages ks and alphahull were used in order to compute the kernel
density estimator and the set Cr̂0 p fˆτ q pXn` p fˆτ` qq. For more details, see Duong et al. (2007)
and Pateiro-López and Rodrı́guez-Casal (2010), respectively.

Simulation study

The behavior of the HDRs estimator established in Algorithm 1 will be analyzed through
a simulation study. Nine normal mixture models (see Wand and Jones (1993)) are considered in this study. Figure 4 contains the contours for τ “ 0.2, τ “ 0.5, τ “ 0.8 and
τ “ 0.9 of the corresponding HDRs. So, the number of connected components for each
value of τ can be checked easily.
Algorithm 1 described in Section 3 is compared with two plug-in methods emerging
from the consideration of different bandwidth selectors. Concretely, a plug-in selector
H1 generalizing the proposal in Wand and Jones (1994) and the cross-validation selector
presented in Duong and Hazelton (2005) are used. Moreover, the Hausdorff distance
and the distance in measure are the two error criteria considered in order to analyze the
performance of these HDRs estimation methods.
A total of 250 random samples of sizes n “ 500, n “ 1000 and n “ 2000 were
generated for each model. Note that the largest samples sizes are considered in order

to analyze the behavior of the algorithm attending to the enormous amounts of data
available for COVID-19. From each sample, HDRs were reconstructed using the three
cited methods for τ “ 0.2, τ “ 0.5, τ “ 0.8 and τ “ 0.9. Remark that the last two values
of τ correspond to the greatest modes which will be particularly interesting for the realdata analysis of the COVID-19 distribution. Two different values for the number of
bootstrap resamples B (100 and 250), six different values of the probability p (p1 “ 0.05,
15

p2 “ 0.1, p3 “ 0.15, p4 “ 0.2, p5 “ 0.25 and p6 “ 0.3) and just a single value of
parameter step (0.025) were considered. Some simulations were also performed when
the parameter step takes the value 0.01 but non significant differences were detected. The
pilot bandwidth used in order to determine the kernel density estimator in Algorithm 1
is H1 .

For each method and each sample, we measure the estimation error approximating
the Hausdorff distance between the boundaries of the estimated and the theoretical sets.
A grid of points on the frontiers of these two sets can be easily obtained for the different
estimation methods considered in this work. Note that the theoretical HDR and its
estimator could be very close in Hausdorff distance and still have quite different shapes.
Such anomalies typically arise when boundaries of these sets are far apart. Hence, a
natural way to reinforce the notion of visual proximity between the two sets is to impose
the proximity of the respective boundaries. Additionally, the distance in measure is
also approximated from the generation of a uniform sample of size 2e ` 05 on a square
r´3, 3s ˆ r´3, 3s containing the contours of the considered models.
16

Both error criteria provide similar results. However, distance in measure usually
presents smaller errors when the Algorithm 1 shows a poor behavior with a milder
penalization of its performance. For this reason, only results for Hausdorff distance are
shown.

Although simulation results for τ “ 0.2 and τ “ 0.5 are not shown in this section,
the information that they provide is briefly exposed next. In particular, if τ “ 0.2 and
n “ 1000, plug-in and hybrid method provide similar Hausdorff results for unimodal
models from 1 to 4. In particular, hybrid method is the most competitive for densities
3 and 4 characterized its skewness and its kurtosis, respectively. From models 6 to 9,
hybrid results are remarkably poor. Concretely, the hybrid error means is sometimes
more than twice the plug-in error means. The same comparison is also considered when
17

τ “ 0.5 and n “ 1000. Again, results for the four first models are similar. For models
from 6 to 9, the Hausdorff mean errors decrease considerably reinforcing the idea that
when bigger values τ are selected, hybrid method is more precise. Quotients q1 and q2
exposed in Table 1 show that the hybrid algorithm improves its behavior considerably
when the sample size increases. Remember that q1 denotes the quotient the Hausdorff
error means for n “ 500 and n “ 1000 when τ “ 0.5 and B “ 100 and q2 , when τ “ 0.8
and B “ 250. In particular, errors for the bimodal density have been reduced a 53% and
a 39% when τ “ 0.5 and τ “ 0.8, respectively. The error reduction is less remarkable
for models 8 and 9 but, it should be noted, that they are really complex models to be
estimated, at least, for the considered values of n. The influence of the parameter B
denoting the number of bootstrap resamples considered in Algorithm 1 can be checked
through quotient q3 of Hausdorff error means for B “ 100 and B “ 250 when n “ 500
and τ “ 0.5 contained in Table 1. Then, the effect of B is non significant. It only remains
to ckeck the influence of probability p. The analysis of simulations for τ “ 0.8 and
τ “ 0.9, that will be exposed immediately, will show that it also plays a non relevant
role.
Table 2 shows the average (M) and the standard deviations (SD) of the 250 Hausdorff
estimation errors obtained for the three mentioned HDRs estimation methods when τ “
0.8 from samples of sizes n “ 500 and B “ 250, respectively. The first six rows contain
the results of Algorithm 1 for the considered values of p. Results clearly show that
this parameter has not influence on the estimations given the higher flexibility of the
hybrid method. Rows seven and eight contain the mean errors for plug-in methods
with bandwidths H1 and H2 respectively, with similar results. Note that they present
similar results. The two last rows show, for comparisons, the error means quotients of
Algorithm 1 when p “ p3 and the plug-in methods. Note that the hybrid algorithm is
competitive except to models 6 and 9. However, it offers the most competitive option if
18

HDRs are reconstructed for model 7.

Table 3 shows the results obtained when τ “ 0.8, n “ 1000 and B “ 250. Although
plug-in methods are clearly more competitive for models 5, 6 and 9, Algorithm 1 present
a good performance for all the other densities. Despite plug-in methods improves their
results considerably, the hybrid algorithm is again the best option for estimating the
HDRs of model 7. This feature can be also seen in Figure 5. Again, it is observed that the
selection of p is not relevant the simulated scenarios. The distance in measure improves
slightly the hybrid errors. For instance, when distance in measure is used, p3 {H1 is equal
to 1.67 for density 9.
Simulations for τ “ 0.9, n “ 1000 and B “ 100 are summarized in Table 4. In this

Figure 6: Violin plots for Hausdorff errors of Algorithm 1 (selecting p3 ) and plug-in

case, the hybrid method offers competitive results for all models except for the bimodal
model 5. Additionally, the comparison of the nineth rows in Tables 3 and 4 show that

21

the hybrid algorithm reduce considerably their results from models from 6 to 9. For
instance, when τ “ 0.8, its error is twice the plug-in error for density 9; although the
HDR has also two connected components, when τ “ 0.9, the hybrid error only increases
a 28%.
Table 5 shows the results for τ “ 0.9, n “ 2000 and B “ 100. Note that means
are considerably smaller than errors shown in Table 4 for n “ 1000. However, plug-in
methods become more competitive comparatively from models 5 to 9. This can be also
seen in Figure 6. Again, the consideration of the distance in measure makes smaller the
hybrid errors. Concretely, when distance in measure is considered, p3 {H1 is equal to
1.71 and 1.26 for densities 5 and 6, respectively.
Some general conclusions can be summarized from simulations. First, both plug-in
methods considered present competitive and very similar results for any of the considered densities and values of τ. As regards the method exposed in Algorithm 1, it is
important to note that it does not depend strongly on the selection of input parameters
B, p and step. Moreover, it is checked that its performance clearly improves when bigger values of τ and n are considered. These issues justify the application of this hybrid
method for COVID-19 analysis because, in such setting, the identification of distribution modes (when τ is large) is specially relevant and the sample sizes are usually huge.
Although results for smaller values of τ were not satisfactory, if τ is close to zero, this
problem could be treated alternatively using support estimation methods such as the
one proposed in Rodrı́guez-Casal and Saavedra-Nieves (2019a). Finally, it is important
to remark that the simplicity of plug-in methods and their good global results are not
good enough reasons to reject Algorithm 1. Both methods provide HDRs reconstructions of completely different nature. If information on the shape of the HDR is known,
plug-in methods does not incorporate it in the estimator. Additionally, one of the most
remarkable characteristic of this hybrid algorithm is that the resulting estimators present
22

interesting mathematical properties such as easy-to-handle frontiers.

Space-time evolution of COVID-19 clusters for confirmed
cases in the United States

Real-time detection of extremely high incidence of COVID-19 areas is a natural step
within a proper space-time characterization of the disease evolution. This type of analysis enables the identification of regions where medical services and materials need to
be reinforced. Moreover, it is also possible to detect areas where the coronavirus has
suffered a setback or, on the contrary, it continues expanding. In particular, if concrete
measures have been taken in order to stop its expansion in a specific area, the analysis
of its spatial distribution could determinate their degree of efficacy.
From the real data set already introduced in Section 1, the time and spatial evolution
of HDRs and their clusters for the coronavirus in the United States will be analyzed on a
weekly basis between February and May 2020 using a plug-in method with bandwidth
H1 and also Algorithm 1. For the last one, the number of bootstrap resamples generated is B “ 250, the value of p is equal to 0.25 and the value of step, 0.025. Specifically,
a total of ten samples corresponding to the ten weeks studied were considered with
sample sizes equal to 89, 1007, 8007, 58673, 149814, 221738, 214264, 204644, 209343 and
167116, respectively. Note that, except for the first two weeks when the number of data
smaller, samples sizes are larger than 2000, one of the reference values in the simulation
study. According to the results shown in Section 4, the algorithm analyzed in this work
improves its performance when the sample size increases and high values of τ are considered. Therefore, we expect that it was at least as competitive as plug-in methods in
these scenarios.
Figure 1 in Section 2 of SM shows an interactive representation of weekly HDRs
23

reconstructions Cr̂0 p fˆτ q pXn` p fˆτ qq for τ “ 0.9 obtained using the Algorithm 1. Specifically,
the animation covers the period from February 27th to May 5th. Remember that each
one of the ten estimators contain at least the 10% of confirmed cases. Therefore, the
largest modes or clusters of COVID-19 distribution are identified. In the first week, a
single cluster is detected in Seattle. However, only a week later, an additional risky area
is located on New York. Note that New York becomes the only cluster detected from
third to tenth week. Therefore, it is the city with the biggest numbers of cases which
make sense because it is also the most populous city in the United States. As a summary,
Figure 7 shows the HDRs estimator for the third, sixth, eighth and tenth weeks.
Figure 2 in Section 2 of SM shows, as before, an interactive representation of weekly
HDRs estimators for τ “ 0.8 from February 27th to May 5th. In this case, the set reconstructions contain at least the 20% of confirmed cases of COVID-19 however results are
practically equal to the obtained when τ “ 0.9. The only major difference is detected
in the last week analyzed when Chicago appears as a new problematic cluster. Again,
Figure 8 shows the HDRs estimator for the third, sixth, eighth and tenth weeks.
HDRs estimators obtained for τ “ 0.5 are presented in the interactive representation
in Figure 3 in Section 3 of SM. Therefore, the empirical probability content of estimated
clusters is, in this case, 0.5. As before, the animation covers the period from February
27th to May 5th. In the first of the analyzed weeks, results are not very informative
mainly due to the small sample size. Although two clusters are estimated in the second
of the weeks, they provide more useful information to manage the pandemic because
their locations are clear. One of them is located in Seattle and the another one includes
the cities of Boston and New York reaching Detroit. The number of clusters increases
in the third week reflecting the expansion of the disease and also its geographical evolution. Specifically, four risky areas are detected on Seattle, San Francisco, Detroit and
New York. However, only two areas (Chicago and the east coast of the country) register

Figure 7 Time and spatial evolution of HDRs when τ “ 0 9 for confirmed COVID-19
cases in the United States by week between February 2020 and May 2020
the 50% of cases from fifth to seventh week Los Angeles is added as a new risky cluster
in the last weeks of the performed analysis Again Figure 9 shows the HDRs estimator
for the third sixth eighth and tenth weeks
Plug-in reconstructions of HDRs have not been represented because when τ “ 0 9
and τ “ 0 8 the estimated number of clusters and their geographical location is exactly
the same than the obtained from the Algorithm 1 When τ “ 0 5 an only relevant dif25

Figure 8 Time and spatial evolution of HDRs when τ “ 0 8 for confirmed COVID-19
cases in the United States by week between February 2020 and May 2020
ference is detected the cluster sited on New York and Boston in the seventh and eighth
week is divided into two connected components by the plug-in method Therefore both
alternatives provides practically the same HDRs reconstructions when big samples sizes
are considered and the biggest modes of the COVID-19 distribution are estimated selecting high values of τ Although the simplicity of plug-in methods is maybe its main
advantage Algorithm 1 can be useful if additional information on the HDR shape to

Figure 9 Time and spatial evolution of HDRs when τ “ 0 5 for confirmed COVID-19
cases in the United States by week between February 2020 and May 2020
be reconstructed is available Therefore this algorithm tackles the problem of HDR
estimation from a completely different perspective with interesting advantages where
geometry plays a fundamental role In particular unlike plug-in methods the simple geometric structure of the estimator boundary makes possible to determine explicitly the
distance between different clusters boundaries (arcs of circumference) of the estimated

27

HDR.
Finally, it is important to remark that this type of studies can be really useful to determine the areas where interventions to slow the progress of the disease must be carried
out urgently or to identify where they have been really effective. The fight should be
stronger in which areas where the COVID-19 incidence is clearly higher. Of course,
they could be performed considering smaller periods of time (even daily) as long as the
amount and quality of data was high enough.

Conclusions and discussion

The two main goals of this work are to study the practical performance of the new datadriven algorithm proposed in Rodrı́guez-Casal and Saavedra-Nieves (2019b) for estimating a r´convex HDR and apply it for reconstructing the HDRs of confirmed cases of
COVID-19 in the United States from February to May 2020. The route designed to reach
this goal can be summarized as follows: (1) Defining formally the concepts of density
level set, cluster and HDRs illustrating them through a COVID-19 data set (2) reviewing
some of the main geometric aspects of this method, (3) describing in detail and motivating this practical algorithm, (4) checking its behavior through an extensive simulation
study comparing it with classical plug-in HDR estimation methods and (5) illustrating
its performance in order to reconstruct the clusters of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in
the United States where big enough samples sizes are available.
According to the results obtained, the algorithm analyzed in this work presents its
best behavior for large sample sizes and the interest is to estimate the biggest modes of
the distribution considering big values of τ. The analysis performed in this work, where
the Algorithm 1 and plug-in methods are used to reconstruct the HDRs of COVID-19
from weekly occurrences and detecting temporal changes in the spatial pattern of the
28

virus, is under these assumptions. No remarkable differences were detected between the
HDRs estimators provided by the two approaches. Of course, this type of studies could
be performed considering any other time periods or different geographical regions due
to the large amount of data available for COVID-19.
Finally, HDRs estimation theory can be seen as a powerful tool to fight against COVID19. Although plug-in methods offers quite competitive results, the hybrid algorithm
considered in this work provides flexible HDRs reconstructions from a geometrical perspective. Note that the explicit boundary of this estimator is fully determined which
is an important characteristic when, for instance, areas or distances must be calculated
between clusters. A nonparametric test for comparing two or more populations in general dimension could be designed using distances between the estimated HDRs. The
test statistic could measure, for example, the discrepancy among the HDRs estimators
of these populations using the distances between their boundaries, fully known if the
hybrid algorithm studied in this work is considered.
