Abstract:
We consider the SIR epidemiological model applied to the evolution of COVID-19
with two approaches. In the first place we fit a global SIR model, with time delay,
and constant parameters throughout the outbreak, including the contagion rate. The
contention measures are reflected on an effective reduced susceptible population Nef f .
In the second approach we consider a time-dependent contagion rate that reflects the
contention measures either through a step by step fitting process or by following an
exponential decay. In this last model the population is considered the one of the country
N . In the linear region of the differential equations, when the total population N is
large the predictions are independent of N . We apply these methodologies to study the
spread of the pandemic in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, and South Africa for
which the infection peaks are yet to be reached. In all of these cases we provide estimates
for the reproduction and recovery rates. The scenario for a time varying contagion rate
is optimistic, considering that reasonable measures are taken such that the reproduction
factor R0 decreases exponentially. The measured values for the recovery rate γ are
reported finding a universality of this parameter over various countries. We discuss the
correspondence between the global SIR with effective population Nef f and the evolution
of the time local SIR.
Keywords: COVID-19, time-dependent SIR, time-delayed SIR, variable reproduction
rate.

Introduction

In this year we have been confronting a very challenging situation in the world with
the expansion of COVID-19 virus. Its contention remains a challenge to most of the
countries and as of now, we have to rely on efficient testing, social distancing measures
and other sorts of non-pharmacological intervention (NPI). Similarly, to the extent of
each country’s capacity and the international aid the hospital bed and ICU capacity
have to be increased. Modeling the evolution of the pandemic becomes relevant for
all of the issues mentioned above. Testing and following of the infections provides the
primary data source to model the evolution of the pandemic. Prompt reporting and
representative testing naturally reflect on the quality of the forecast models and the
accuracy of the predictions. Similarly, both models and data permit us to evaluate the
efficiency of the NPIs and their role in changing the course of the outbreak. Finally the
modeling of the outbreak can provide guidelines in terms of readiness of the healthcare
systems in such a way that once the infection peak is reached, all possible measures
to ensure efficient attention as well as risk mitigation procedures are adequately put in
place.
The SIR model is among the classics of epidemiological modeling and owes its name
to the split of the population into three categories: susceptible (S), infected (I) and
recovered (R). Despite of its simplicity, it has proven its versatility in the modeling

–1–

of a variety of infectious outbreaks, among these, the novel coronavirus [1–26]. The
SIR model is described in terms of a system of coupled differential equations for the
evolution of S, I and R, and the solutions will depend on the initial conditions as
well as on the contagion rate (denoted by β) as well as the recovery rate (denoted by
γ). In this work we consider the SIR model and variations of it in order to describe
the short term evolution of the pandemic in various latin-american countries as well
as South Africa. Part of our working strategy is to follow a self contained approach,
in such a way that the parameters involved in the evolution of the outbreak in each
case study are automatically derived from a best fit on the data. This means that
for each country we obtain estimates for β and γ as well as the basic reproduction
number R0 . This is advantageous in comparison to other studies where the evolution
is described upon the use of data from countries that have already navigated through
the first peak, in the sense that the case by case parameters account for particular
features of the population under consideration, such as mean population age, frequency
of comorbidities and healthcare capacity among others. In this sense this work accounts
for a self contained study based on the country by country data provided by national
authorities to the World Health Organization. However we obtain a certain universality
in the parameters studied, for example the recovery rate γ is always around 0.06 as
noticed in [26] from fitting the tale of the active cases curve in the case of China.
Our strategy is twofold: In the first case we consider a SIR model with time
independent parameters β, γ as well as an effective population Nef f and a time shift δt
in the evolution. These parameters are found upon marginalization of the corresponding
models to the data. Even though it is expected for the parameter β to decrease due
to the diverse NPIs put in place, this effect is reflected on a smaller value for β as it
averages over the corresponding time evolution, and more importantly on a small value
of Nef f as the NPIs tend to reduce the exposure of the overall population. This can
occur due to the characteristics of the initial spreading and also due to the contention
measures in the society. Another issue encountered when modeling the data has to
do with the fact that one usually finds an overall delay in the evolution of the curves,
once this suitable time delay is included we obtain a proper fit1 . The cause of this
delay can be explained by the fact that the time of incubation is finite, and therefore
the time variation of the different populations should be related with the values of the
magnitudes at a previous time. There are previous studies which consider that the
total susceptible population is a quantity which is smaller than the country (or city)
population [1].
In the second case we allow for an explicit time dependent contagion rate β(t).

Models with time delay for evolution of epidemics have been discussed in refs. [7–9] among others.

–2–

Time dependent contagion rate has been considered in previous COVID-19 studies
[7]. In particular in [24] step, exponential and linear dependences were explored. The
motivation to explore an exponential decay in [24] is that the reduction of the contagion
rate is obtained after lockdown due to the fact that contacts are reduced to closest
family members, but the disease has a life time ≈ 1/γ. However this can change if
the country relaxes the contention measures. The model was successfully applied to
describe the evolution of the virus in Cuba, estimating correctly the peak of active
cases. We consider for this work the mentioned exponential dependence. Also in [25]
this dependence has been applied successfully to describe the outbreak in Italy. Also
the step dependence of β is very accurate to study the evolution of the epidemia, and
we employ it, but it doesn’t allow to predict stricter control measures, as one can not
estimate what will be the next down jump of this magnitude. In the case when the
control measures have already ensured that the reproduction number R0 < 1 one can
extrapolate with the achieved constant contagion rate βtoday , to bound a worst case
scenario. As the studied countries are not yet in this phase, we take into account the
functional exponential dependence. We fit the best values of γ, β(t) to a time dependent
SIR considering that the total population of susceptible is the country population N .
This consideration makes the SIR differential equations linear, and the populations
dependence is then locally in time an exponential.
Both of these approaches allow us to make an estimate of when the first peak will
occur for each country, as well as the detected active cases at the peak, the total number
of detected infected and the number of deceased patients during the course of the first
peak. This quantities are reported for the different models in Table 1 were we include
the prediction for each methodology and the corresponding confidence intervals.
Our paper is organized as follows: In section 2 we describe the general characteristics of the SIR model. In subsection 2.1 the relation of the SIR model with the logistic
curve is discussed. In section 2.2 we discuss the reproduction number for the SIR model
with constant parameters and also with variable parameters. Section 3 is devoted to
the two different forecast methodologies. Subsection 3.1 discusses the SIR model with
time independent parameters, effective population and time delay, subsection 3.2 describes the SIR model with time dependent β(t) calculated by steps, while subsection
3.3 describes the SIR model extrapolated with an exponential β(t). In the last two
cases the population is the complete country population. In Section 4 we discuss the
two different approaches and present our conclusions.

The SIR Model

The SIR model owes its name to the three compartments that make up for the entire
population, namely the group of people susceptible of getting infected, the group of

–4–

infected people and the group of recovered at any given time. If we assume no mortality
and a constant population N 2 , we can normalize everything to the value of N and work
with fractions, such that the variables susceptible S(t), infected I(t) and recovered
R(t) take values between 0 and 1. Hence, at any given time t it must hold that
S(t) + I(t) + R(t) = 1. If we want to know the net number of infected people at any
given time, we just have to multiply I(t) by N and similarly for the other variables in
the model.
The equations governing the evolution of the simple SIR model we have just described are the following
dS
= −βSI,
dt
dI
= βSI − γI,
dt
dR
= γI.
dt

(2.1)
(2.2)
(2.3)

The model is specified in terms of the parameters β (the infection or contagion rate)
and γ (the recovery rate). The units of the constants are given by [β] = [γ] = 1/T ,
and the fractional populations are dimensionless [S] = [I] = [R] = 1. T represents the
unit of time, which is considered to be a day. This system of equations appears to be
independent of N . However, we must recall that this is a non-linear system of ordinary
differential equations, the effect of N can indeed be seen in the boundary conditions, for
instance, if at t = 0 we have the first reported infected person, the boundary conditions
needed to evolve the SIR model of interest are
S(0) =

N −1
,
N

I(0) =

1
N

and R(0) = 0 .

(2.4)

As N increases its effect on the evolution of a SIR model is going to be a delay in the
appearance of the infection peak. More in general, one can consider to run a model
in such a way that at t = 0 there is a fraction of infected i and already a fraction of
recovered r. In this fashion, the boundary conditions will be:
S(0) = 1 − i − r ,

I(0) = i

and R(0) = r.

(2.5)

This type of conditions are not necessarily accounted for by the solutions satisfying
(2.4) and this is a natural consequence of the non-linearity of the system of differential
2

More involved versions of the SIR model might allow for natality and mortality rates independent
of the infection under consideration as well as mortality rates due to the infection itself, for a more
detailed version discussion of these issues, the reader is refered to chapter 3 of [29]

–5–

equations. The boundary conditions (2.4) become specially relevant if one attempts to
solve the SIR model by patches, where each patch has a distinct β parameter. It is
also useful to write them in this way for the case when N is a large quantity and the
SIR equations become linear. For this case the condition S ≈ 1 holds, and the SIR
equations evolution is independent of a rescaling of N . We elaborate more on this issue
when discussing time dependent SIR models in subsections 3.2 and 3.3.
The cumulative number of infections can be defined as
Ic (t) = I(t) + R(t) ,

(2.6)

and would correspond to the total number of infections reported e.g. by John Hopkins
Data Base[11], once we multiply Ic (t) by the population N .
At the begining of the outbreak S(t) is roughly one, hence Eq. (2.2) admits an
approximate solution of the form:
I(t) = I0 e(β−γ)t ,

(2.7)

with this expression we can obtain the R(t) for the exponential phase as
R(t) =

γI0 (β−γ) t
e
,
β−γ

(2.8)

we can define R0 = β/γ as the reproduction number, i.e. the number that characterizes
the evolution of the infection. Now if we consider the cumulative number of infections
in the SIR model during the exponential phase we obtain
Ic (t) = I(t) + R(t) =

R0 I0 (β−γ) t
e
.
R0 − 1

(2.9)

Our intention is to use the data of confirmed, recovered and deceased patients.
Particularly for the former two, the accesible data corresponds only to a fraction of
the total infected and recovered patients. One expects that under adequate testing
protocols, the numbers reported keep a time independent proportionality to the actual
numbers. This is reflected in the following equation
Ic (t) = αIT OT (t),

(2.10)

where IT OT (t) is the total number of cumulative cases at time t. The constant of
proportionality is the detection rate and we denote it by α. For instance, in China, it
is considered that only 14% of all cases were detected [5], that is α = 0.14. There are
also other scenarios for which α = 0.535 [6].

DAYS. Day 1: 5.06.2020

Figure 1: Numerical solution for the various populations of the SIR model: active cases
I(t) (green), recovered R(t) (blue), cumulative cases C(t) (yellow) and deaths D(t)(red). For
this plot we have used γ = 0.146, β = 0.184 and N = 126.2 ∗ 106 . This is a SIR with the
population of Mexico, the contagion rate β determined locally on 5.06.20, and the recovery rate
determined in the interval 16.03.20 to 5.06.20. A detection rate α = 0.14 has been assumed.
The deaths are estimated fitting the mortality rate µ = 0.138, with D(t) = µC(t). This is a
worst case scenario, which we consider it will not be reached if the β(t) continues the current
decaying dependence we explore in this work.

As a final remark we must recall that our simple SIR model does not have a
compartment for the deceased D(t). The simplest manner to account for this group is
to describe them as a fraction of the SIR recovered R(t):
D(t) = µR(t) ,

(2.11)

where the a-dimensional coefficient µ corresponds to the mortality rate. In Figure 1 we
show as an example a global SIR model evolution for Mexico, notice the huge numbers
obtained for the population. This is a worst case scenario that we don’t expect to
reach.
2.1

Relation to the Logistic Sigmoid Curve

A good approximation for the number of recovered patients can be the so called Logistic
Sigmoid curve, given by the following expression
R(s)
,
(2.12)
1 + e−κ(t−t0 )
where t = t0 is the inflection point, i.e. the point where the derivative attains a
maximum. Note that the recovered population gets saturated at the value R(s) , and
R(t) =

–7–

that at R(t0 ) = R(s) /2. Note also that for t  t0 the behaviour of R(t) is essentially
described by an exponential function
R(t) = R(s) eκ(t−t0 ) + . . . ,

t  t0 ,

(2.13)

recall that R(t) in the SIR model also has an exponential phase at the begining of the
outbreak (see Eq. (2.8)), from this we find that
κ=β−γ.

(2.14)

In a similar fashion, it is possible to approximate the number of cumulative reported
infections predicted by the SIR model in terms of a Logistic Sigmoid
(s)

Ic (t) =

Ic
0 .
1 + e−κ(t−t0 )

(2.15)

We have taken the same κ since, according to the SIR model, at the beginning of the
outbreak, I, R and Ic grow with the same exponential factor. However, we take a
different inflection time t00 , as it can be seen from figure 1 that there is a certain offset
between R and Ic . Comparing Ic in the exponential phase with Eq. (2.9) we obtain
0

Ic(s) e−κt0 =

R0 I0
,
R0 − 1

(2.16)

using Eqs. (2.14) and (2.16) we obtain
0

Ic(s) e−κt0 = R̃0 R(s) e−κt0 .

(2.17)

Let us recall that for large t, the quantity I(t) in the SIR model approaches zero.
(s)
Hence, the asymptotic values of Ic = R(s) must coincide. From this observation we
arrive at the following relation
0
eκ(t0 −t0 ) = R0 .
(2.18)
2.2

On the Basic Reproduction Number R0

For the SIR model with constant parameters one can establish time dependent quantities in order to account for the evolution of the epidemic. One can draw some inspiration
from the Logistic curve approximation and define
κ(1) (t) =

d Log(Ic (t))
.
dt

(2.19)

Note then that at the beginning of the outbreak, κ(t) = κ as defined in Equation (2.14).
In this fashion, we can define a time dependent basic reproduction number
(1)

R0 (t) = 1 +

–8–

κ(1) (t)
,
γ

(2.20)

note that this quantity is always bigger than 1, matches the global basic reproduction
number at the beginning of the outbreak and as it approaches 1 it signals the end of
the disease’s spread. This definition can also be employed for a time varying β(t) in
(2)
the limit of N huge, such that R0 (t) = 1 + (I + R)0 /(γ(I + R)).
In a similar fashion we can use the infected population in order to define a second
dynamical quantity,
d Log(I(t))
κ(2) (t) =
= βS(t) − γ,
(2.21)
dt
in this case the dynamical basic reproduction number can be defined analogously,
(2)
R0 (t)

κ(2) (t)
,
=1+
γ

(2.22)

(2)

Note that in this case, R0 (t) becomes 1 once the infection peak is reaches and for
(2)
further times is less than one. An R0 smaller than one is a sign that the infected
population is decreasing. Again this definition can be considered for a time varying
(2)
β(t) in the limit of N huge, giving S(t) ≈ 1, such that R0 (t) = 1 + I 0 /(γI).
When the contagion rate of the SIR model is dependent of time, which is the case
of the second approach considered in this work the value of reproduction number can
be defined as:
β(t)
(3)
R0 (t) =
.
(2.23)
γ
This quantity in the limit S(t) ≈ 1 which is the situation in our second model, coincides
(1)
(2)
with both of the previously defined ones R0 (t) and R0 (t).

Forecast Methodologies

In this section we describe the two methodologies applied in fitting the various models
to the data. In order to do so, we must first prepare the data in order to fit the
observables of the SIR model. For the data we denote C(t) the number of confirmed
cases for a given time (day) t. Similarly we denote the recovered by R(t) and the
deceased by D(t). Note that the SIR model does not have a compartment for the
deceased, hence this quantity has to be assigned to the recovered compartment. In
our case we choose to combine the data for both recovered and deceased into a new
“effective recovered” group RSIR (t), more suited to be described by the SIR model
RSIR (t) = R(t) + D(t) ,

(3.1)

and similarly, we describe the infected active by
ISIR (t) = C(t) − R(t) − D(t) .

–9–

(3.2)

The data we would like to fit is now described in terms of C(t), RSIR (t) and ISIR (t).
As a notation reminder, datasets we denote by italic letters, C, R, I, etc, whereas
functions, such as the ones in the SIR model are denoted by curly letters C, S, I, R,
etc.
3.1

Time Independent SIR Model

For this methodology the goal is to obtain the optimal values for the population Nef f ,
the contagion rate β as well as the recovery rate γ, such that the data for confirmed,
recovered and active infections is best fitted with a SIR model. Note that in the for
the initial conditions presented in Eq. 2.4, Day 0, i.e. t = 0 is the day when the
first confirmed case is reported. However, one has to be careful with setting t = 0, as
the first infection might have occurred before. For that purpose we also include a time
offset, or delay δt, in such a manner that the SIR model observables used to fit the data
are Ic (t + δt), R(t + δt) and I(t + δt). Therefore, in addition to the SIR parameters N ,
β and γ we would also have to estimate δt. As mentioned already, the data we intend
to fit are the confirmed cases C(t), to be described by the function Ic (t + δt), the sum
of recovered plus deceased R(t) + D(t) to be described by the function R(t + δt) as well
as the active cases C(t) − R(t) − D(t) to be described by I(t + δt).
Note that at the begining of the outbreak we could fit an exponential to C(t) in
doing so we would obtain the the parameter κ = β − γ. From this approach one would
have to be careful since only as small amount of data follows a straight line in log
scale. This implies that the most recent data can not be used for the estimation of κ,
therefore missing the effect of the most recent interventions, nevertheless this can serve
to a time local description of β(t) as the ones discussed later. Furthermore, in choosing
a given interval we would be introducing bias errors in the estimation of κ. Instead we
fit C(t) by a sigmoid function and estimate κ from the best fit. We use Mathematica
for the estimation of the best fit.
Having the value of κ we reduce the parameter space by 1: We leave β out of
the game and estimate it using κ once we obtain the value of γ. Note that we don’t
employ analytic expressions for Ic (t), R(t) and I(t), for this SIR model with time
delay, however an analytical expression for the standard SIR is well studied [30]. We
have to numerically solve the SIR differential equations for fixed N , β and γ. In order
to describe numerically how close a given model approaches the data we define the
following likelihood function
Today

L(N, γ, δt) =

X 
(Ic (t + δt) − C(t))2 + (R(t + δt) − RSIR (t))2
t=0


+(I(t + δt) − ISIR (t))2 ,

(3.3)

the optimal values for N , γ and δt are those for which L(N, γ, δt) attains a minimum.
The errors are estimated from the function L(N, γ, δt) as well, depending on how far
one has to go in either direction such that the value of L increases by 0.5 above the
minimum.
The error estimates for N , γ, δt and β (through κ) are used to run SIR models
with different configurations of parameters, i.e.3
{p1 = (N + ∆N+ , β, γ, δt) , p2 = (N − ∆N− , β, γ, δt) p3 = (N, β + ∆β+ , γ, δt) , . . . , }I
(3.4)
where the index I = 1, ..., 10 denotes a set of particular parameter values, i.e. an
element on the net of parameters. In each of these situations we compare to the SIR
model for the central value parameters p0 = (N, β, γ, δt). Say we are interested in the
prediction for cumulative infections Ic , the central value will be given by Ic (p0 ; t) and
for the corresponding Error bars, we define two sets
P + (t) ={pI | Ic (pI ; t) − Ic (pI ; t) > 0} ,
−

P (t) ={pI | Ic (pI ; t) − Ic (pI ; t) < 0}.
Then the errors in Ic at time t are given by

Step changing contagion rate

In this subsection we implement a SIR model with a time changing contagion rate
in order to describe the evolution of the various population compartments for the
considered countries. The first approach is to study β(t) as a step function, where each
time interval has constant values of it. In order to extrapolate we consider a functional
dependence for β(t), which is chosen to be an exponential decay [26]. Throughout this
section the total population N is taken to be the entire population of each country. We
vs. ISIR (t) from
also estimate the recovery rate by fitting the experimental data dR(t)
dt
the SIR.
From the available data we set the contagion rate change in discrete time steps. For
this purpose we divide the data in intervals between 4 and 6 days, depending on which
choice does a better fitting to the data of a given country. The decrease in β as time
evolves obeys to the country contention measures, and it doesn’t assume a particular
dependence. Therefore it describes very well the measurements.
In this section we implement a SIR model with a time changing contagion rate
in order to describe the evolution of the various population compartments for the
considered countries. In the first place we take β(t) as a step function. We adjust
local exponentials to (2.20) and (2.22) to every region of constant β(t). In the next
subsection 3.3 we consider an exponential dependence, which allows to extrapolate to
the future. Through out the subsection the total population before the outbreak is
considered the country population N . We also estimate the recovery rate by fitting
the experimental data dR
vs. ISIR , notice than here R(t) has no subindices, meaning
dt
that this is the real data of recovered. It is important to say, that a similar study
with the fit of dRdtSIR vs. ISIR , as the one performed in previous section could improve
the results for the deaths estimates, however the parameter γ obtained has a different

– 12 –

interpretation than the real recovery rate.
Let us start by explaining the procedure. For all the countries studied we consider
that the total population N is the number of inhabitants of the country. The contention
measurements are then only reflected on the change of the contagion rate β(t). For
this case if no herd immunity is pursued, as S ≈ 1 we are in the linear regime of the
differential equations [26]. Meaning that the solutions of the I, R and (I + R) obey an
exponential dependence. This dependence can be explored at any time of the evolution
and in the used units gives the results in (2.8) and (2.7). Then, if after the contention
measures are implemented β(t) < γ is achieved, only a small fraction of the population
will be infected.
There are two important points to discuss about the linearity of the equations in
this regime of large N . One was noted in [26], this is that assuming a constant in time
detection rate (α) such that the real population group numbers are denoted by subindex
T OT , and the detected quantities are given by I = αIT OT , R = αRT OT , the evolution
of I, R does not change for different values of α. This point is central in our analysis.
4
This is due to the fact that the equations are linear and the initial conditions for
infected and recovered are also obtained by multiplication I0 = αI0 , R0 = αR0 . Such
that one can solve only for the detected quantities (I, R). Analogously if the population
number N is so big such that S ≈ 1 the differential equations evolution is independent
on the actual value of N . This is again due to the linearity of the equations and of
the initial conditions. We have thus solved numerically the SIR equations for a β(t)
varying in time:
dST OT
dIT OT
dRT OT
= βST OT IT OT ,
= (βST OT − γ)IT OT ,
= γIT OT , (3.9)

The initial conditions consider that at time t = 0 there are I0 detected infected persons,
and R0 detected recovered persons. The solutions of (3.9) in linear regime reduce to
solutions of the system:

As the equations are linear the substitutions IT OT → I/λ, RT OT → R/λ just change
I0 λ

the initial conditions to: I(0) = αN
= NI00 , R(0) = RαN

. This illustrates the fact
N0
4

Is important to note that for the non linear regime there is a big difference of the SIR evolution
for different values of α [26].

– 13 –

that the predictions are independent of N . Now let us consider just N 0 = N , then for
the detected populations we have the system:
dR

= γI,
dt

I0
R0
I(0) = , R(0) =

S ≈ 1,

(3.11)

Therefore in the linear regime, for a local region in time, our obtained results are
exponentials and are approximately independent of α and N . The detected populations
of recovered and infected persons can be written as:
N I = I0 exp((β − γ)t),

(3.12)

N R = (R0 − δ)exp((β − γ)t) + δ,
γI0
exp((β − γ)t) + δ.
=
β−γ
To study the evolution of the systems we first fit the values of γ by making a minsquare fit of the linear dependence dR
versus ISIR in (3.11). There is some universality
dt
in these values, however there are differences between the countries. Such differences
can be coding the fact that the recovered data are reported in different ways. In the
Table 3 we summarize the γ of the five cases studied with date till 05.06.20.

confidence intervals for various countries. To obtain β(t) the mean values of γ shown
are the ones considered. The data are obtained from 16.03.20 to 5.06.20.
Assuming the linear regime (3.12) we take into consideration that the contagion
rate varies in time. To describe the epidemia in previous times to the present we assume
a β which is changing by pieces in intervals of 4-6 days. Locally in time we make a fit

– 14 –

of the I(t) versus t data employing the linear regime solution (3.11). This is locally
we consider intervals of constant β. In the Tables 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 we summarize the
values of β, R0 and their errors for a 95% percent interval of confidence for the studied
countries, also till the date 05.06.20. In the Figures 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 we can appreciate the
changes in R0 for this model changing by pieces. Also one can observe the curves of
the populations evolution for the different countries.
We estimate the local values of β from two different formulas, which are valid only
in the linear regime. The first of them uses the data of the detected accumulated cases:
β(t) =

(I(t) + R(t))0
+ γ.
(I(t) + R(t))

(3.13)

The second uses the data for the detected active cases:
β(t) =

I(t)0
+ γ.
I(t)

(3.14)

This last one has been used in [26]. As mentioned they are equivalent to R0 in (2.20)
(2)
and R0 in (2.22). Figures 2, 3 4, 5, 6 show with blue dots and error bars the estimates
for (3.14), and with a blue line the populations obtained from evolving the SIR with
(3.14), this is done till the last data point. With green dots and error bars they show
only the estimate for (3.13) till 05.06.20. The figures are organized as follows: The
sub-figures 1,2,3 and 4 show the dependences I(t) + R(t), D(t), I(t) and R0 (t). The
quantity D(t) representing the evolution of the deaths is not considered in the equations
of the SIR model of this section. However we estimate it considering it as a proportion
of the accumulated cases C(t), this is D(t) = µC(t). To estimate it we do a linear fit of
D(t) versus C(t) taking all the data points from the 16.03.20 to the 05.06.20.
The last sub-figure of the mentioned figures denotes the step determined values
of R0 = β(t)/γ with the error bars, for the dates till 05.06.20. After 05.06.20 we
extrapolate with an exponential dependence. Both equations (3.13) and (3.14) are
approximated but exact in the linear regime N  1, however in the measurements
(3.13) has less uncertainty than (3.14). This can be seen comparing the error bars in
the plots of R0 : the green bars for (3.13) and the blue bars for (3.14). The intention
of these two approaches is to obtain independent but comparable estimates of the time
variation of the contagion rate.

Contagion rate with exponential decay in time

In this subsection we consider the future predictions of the models with variable contagion rate β(t), taking into account an exponential time dependence. This dependence
was proposed and explored for COVID-19 outbreak in [26]. In that work the curve for

the active cases of Cuba was correctly described, and the estimated peak differed only
by few days with the actual one. It has as well been explored successfully to describe
the evolution of the pandemia in Italy [27]. In the linear regime of the differential
equations the maximum of the active cases is achieved when the condition R0 = 1 is
reached. All the studied countries are still in the region R0 > 1. Here we apply the
mentioned dependence to the studied countries. However in the evolution for some
cases the exponential fit for β(t) is more appropriated, for others even-so a fit to the
exponential can be performed in a long period of time β values have not been reduced
considerably. Therefore these forecasts have to be taken with care, as they assume the
country will have in the future similar confinement measures as in the interval fitted.

The dependence for β(t) that we will fit to the data reads:
β(t) = β0 exp(−b0 t).

Analysis and Conclusions

In this work we have explored the SIR model following two different approaches. In the
first case we opted for a fixed contagion rate. The effects of contention measures are
reflected on an effective value of the total susceptible population Nef f (much smaller
than the actual country population) and incorporates an overall time delay in the
evolution of the differential equations.
In the second approach the population N was taken to be the population of the
country in consideration and the contention measures are reflected on a time varying
contagion rate β(t). This contagion rate is considered an exponential decay motivated

– 20 –

by the previous study for COVID-19 [26], and has been also considered in [27], and
it reflects the effect of the contention measures. Both of these approaches are fully
self contained, meaning that we estimate all the parameters involved. The evolutions
described are the ones of the detected populations I(t) and R(t). If one would like to
estimate the real infections is necessary to rely on the values of the detection rates α
reported in the literature [5, 12].
Both approaches can be regarded as complementary ways to tackle the same problem. In each situation and despite the specific reporting and testing conditions of each
country, we observe that both approaches lead to similar results and agree within error bars. This also highlights the versatility of the SIR model and its effectiveness in
modeling this type of situations. The agreement of the approaches comes from the
intuition that the reduced mobility of the society could be casted into the SIR model
in two different but complementary ways: either by effectively reducing in the pool of
interaction (Nef f ) or by a time decreasing contagion rate (β(t)). In section 2 we have
developed the mathematical machinery to compare between the parameters involved
in each of the approaches, we also observe a good agreement among these quantities as
can be indeed seen in Table 1.
The results of this work show the validity of the SIR model and its modified versions
in order to describe the spread of communicable diseases with reasonable accuracy, in
particular the novel coronavirus outbreak. The versatility and simplicity of the model
permits us to develop a “personalized” analysis of the different countries situations.
For some cases, we have found universality of the parameters, as in the case of the
recovery rate γ whose values coincide for most of the countries under study. We would
like to emphasize that the time dependent models considered allow us to explore the
time evolution of the pandemic, and to implement the effect of the restrictive mobility
in the set of differential equations. Similarly, the time independent model also proved
to be useful in this description. It would be interesting to contrast the time dependent
parameters with the corresponding NPIs put in place by each country over various
periods of time. Due to the comparable results obtained though these approaches it
would be interesting to explore this “complementarity” of SIR models with a time decaying contagion rate β and a large country population N and the SIR models with an
effective population Nef f . We hope to come back to these issues in a future work.
The results and observations made in this work have to be taken carefully due
to many reasons, among which one has to underline the fact that many countries are
ending their lockdown measures before the peak of active infections is reached. This
can significantly increase the number of infections and in some cases they might exceed

– 21 –

the 95% confidence levels established in this work. Also from estimates concerning the
total number of infections as well as the effective pool of susceptible Nef f , we observe
that at the end of the peak no heard immunity would be reached in any of the cases
studied. This is the way in which the epidemia has been developed in all the countries
that have control it so far. Also in our results we observe a certain variability on the
peak of active infections. Additionally a second peak of the outbreak could arise, the
eventuality of this new wave of spreading has not been contemplated in this work.
Nevertheless we consider that our analysis could contribute to those explorations.
