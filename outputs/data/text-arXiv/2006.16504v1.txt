Abstract—After the onset of the recent COVID-19 pandemic,
a number of studies reported on possible changes in electricity
consumption trends. The overall theme of these reports was that
“electricity use has decreased during the pandemic, but the power
grid is still reliable”. In this paper we analyze electricity data
upto end of May 2020, examining both electricity demand and
variables that can indicate stress on the power grid, such as
peak demand and demand ramp-rate. We limit this study to three
states in the USA: New York, California, and Florida. The results
indicate that the effect of the pandemic on electricity demand is
not a simple reduction from comparable time frames, and there
are noticeable differences among regions. The variables that can
indicate stress on the grid also conveyed mixed messages: some
indicate an increase in stress, some indicate a decrease, and some
do not indicate any clear difference. A positive message is that
some of the changes that were observed around the time stay-athome orders were issued appeared to revert back by May 2020. A
key challenge in ascribing any observed change to the pandemic is
correcting for weather. We provide a weather-correction method,
apply it to a small city-wide area, and discuss the implications
of the estimated changes in demand. The weather correction
exercise underscored that weather-correction is as challenging as
it is important.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Reliable electricity supply is a fundamental service for a
functioning society. Since a large part of the workforce is
working from home due to the COVID-19 pandemic, uninterrupted electricity supply has become even more important. The
other important service for the nation’s productivity during
these unprecedented times is internet connectivity, for which
electricity is a prerequisite. Thus, the potential impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic on electricity supply and demand is of
interest to many.
Understanding demand changes is important to balancing
authorities that are in charge of maintaining reliable operation of the power grid. The New York Independent System
Operator (NYISO) has reported large drops in electricity
demand after the pandemic, in the range of 10%, below
typical levels [1]. California ISO used a backcasting method to
account for weather, and reported a reduction of 0.5 − 12% in
hourly demand in the week after the stay-at-home order [2].
A reduction of electricity consumption to the tune of 10%

in Europe is reported in [3]. A number of media reports
have drawn from these studies [4], [5]. More recently, the
Energy Information Agency (EIA) reports that while electricity
demand seems to have reduced in many parts of the U.S.,
there are variabilities in these trends, and specifically Florida
demand trends appear not to indicate a reduction [6].
Reliability of the nation’s electricity system depends less
on electric energy consumption than on variability of demand
and generation. Large changes in demand makes it harder for
the operators of the power grids to maintain demand-supply
balance, which is critical for reliability. So far, the power
grids throughout the USA have continued to deliver electricity
reliably. Grid operators took special precautions early on to
prevent disruptions to grid operations due to the pandemic [7],
[8]. Some potential issues such as the challenges of refueling
nuclear power plants are being worked out. In contrast to
electricity demand, there is a lack of studies examining the
effect of the COVID-19 mitigation measures on the power
grid’s reliability.
Majority of the studies described above were published soon
after the stay-at-home orders were issued. Now that a few more
weeks have passed, it is useful to examine the data again to
see if the trends reported in the early studies hold.
In this paper we analyze data from U.S. Energy Information
Administration (EIA) until the end of May 2020 to examine
trends in electricity demand and indicators of stress on the
power grid. We focus on data from three states in the USA:
Florida, New York, and California. There are few reasons for
this short list. One, these three states are similar in the nominal electricity consumption but distinct in both geography,
demographics, and prevalence of COVID-19. Two, prior work
exist on NY and CA, but little on FL, except for the EIA
analysis [6] that indicated the trend in FL was distinct from
other studies.
Assessing the impact of the pandemic on electricity consumption requires correcting for weather, so that the weatherindependent part of demand can be extracted. It is not trivial
to do so even for a single consumer [9], [10]. Correcting
for weather on aggregate demand in a large geographical

area is far more challenging. The studies that corrected for
weather had to make assumptions and approximations to
handle this geographic variability [11], [3]. Our analysis of
the three large regions (NY, CA, FL) is therefore based on
the raw data to avoid the uncertainty introduced by the model
used for weather correction. In the last section of the paper
we perform weather correction of electricity demand from a
small balancing authority in Florida for which weather can
be defined clearly. In this particular area, weather corrected
demand shows an increase due to the pandemic’s mitigation
efforts. This weather correction exercise also reveals the limit
on the conclusions that can be made about the effect of the
pandemic on electricity demand.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II
analyzes electricity demand trends to identify impact of the
pandemic on demand. Section III analyzes four variables (peak
demand, demand ramp rate, forecast error and interchange) in
order to assess if the pandemic is changing the stress on the
grid. Section IV presents a weather correction method and its
application.
II. E LECTRIC ENERGY DEMAND TRENDS
The daily electricity demand trend in Florida is shown in
Figure 1. Apart from a temporary drop just before and after
the statewide stay-at-home order, daily demand has an overall
increasing trend across the two month period of March-April,
2020. The trend also does not seem to be correlated to that in
the same period in 2019. The lack of a clear trend indicates
that if the pandemic has had an impact on electricity demand, it
will only become clear after the effect of weather is accounted
for.
Figure 2 compares the daily electricity demand in California
for March-April 2020 and 2019. Electricity demand appears
to have decreased after the State of California issued the stayat-home order. This is consistent with the observations in the
report [7]. However, the demand trend in subsequent weeks,
particularly the last week of April, is not consistent with a
reduction. The 2020 demand not only appears to have reached
to pre stay-at-home order levels, but also closed the gap with
2019 demand levels.
The daily electricity demand in New York is shown in
Figure 3. At first glance it appears to be consistent with the
findings of the earlier studies [7], [3] (the latter was about
Italy). However, further analyses - which we describe below indicated that it will be inaccurate to infer from this data that
the pandemic caused the demand reduction.
First, we compared the daily electricity demand for the state
of New York from January to May for 2019 and 2020 (figure
not shown). The data shows that the electricity demand for
2020 has been consistently lower than 2019, meaning the
reduction could be due to factors other than the pandemic,
such as weather.
Second, to further assess whether these trends are significant
or not, we fitted simple linear regression models to data
from both years. The models were daily electricity demand
regressed over an array representing days passed from the

first Monday of January for each month. Both models are
significant and almost identical in parameter estimates.
Thus, comparisons with weeks immediately before and after
the stay-at-home order to identify impact of the pandemic
should be done with care. No clear change is apparent after
stay-at-home order in NY. Rather, the post-lockdown trend
seems to be a continuation of the pre-lockdown trends. The
overall conclusion about daily electricity demand is that the
effect of the pandemic, if there is an effect at all, is not easily
seen without correcting for weather.
III. A NALYSIS OF VARIABLES THAT CAN REVEAL STRESS
ON THE POWER GRID

Reliable electricity supply requires a healthy power grid,
which requires maintaining demand-supply balance at all
times. Therefore, we analyze a number of additional variables which can impact demand-supply balance directly or
indirectly, with a goal to detect changes due to the pandemic1 .
Any significant change in these variables will indicate changes
in the stress on the nation’s power grid.
In the following, dk denotes the electricity demand (MWh)
at hour (ending) k, where k = 1, . . . , 24 is an hour counter.
1) Daily peak and trough of the hourly demand, defined
as the maximum and minimum of the hourly electricity demand over a 24-hour period. A large value of
the peak demand, particularly when it is significantly
different from the base load, means additional peaker
plants have to be brought on-line. Apart from increasing
cost, reliance on peaker plants reduces reliability since
grid operation becomes sensitive to potential failure or
unavailability of these plants2 .
2) Demand ramp rate, defined as the difference between
the hourly demand in an hour and the previous hour, i.e.,
dk − dk−1 . Rapid and large changes in demand makes it
harder for grid operators to balance demand and supply
since generators are limited in their ability to increase or
decrease generation. A large demand ramp rate is, thus,
a measure of added stress on the grid.
3) Day ahead demand forecast error, defined as the difference between the actual demand in an hour and the
forecasted demand for that hour computed a day ahead.
Grid operators compute forecasts for hurly demand 24
hours in advance (among many other types of forecasts).
Many aspects of grid planning and operation, including
unit commitment, will be inadequate in case of large
forecast errors. The grid operator then has to procure
more generating resources in real time. Also, a change
in the forecast error can indicate a change in consumer
behavior, all else remaining constant.
1 Many of these variables, such as peak demand, should have the unit of
power (MW or GW), not the unit of energy (MWh or GWh). However, since
the only data we have are hourly energy data, we have defined all quantities
in terms of hourly energy use, and thus they all have the unit of energy.
2 Unavailability can occur due to various reasons, not just mechanical
problems at the plant. For instance, if the grid operator does not expect the
demand to be large it may not offer contracts ahead of time for the plants to
be ready.

4) Net interchange, defined as the electric energy exchanged between a region and its neighboring regions
every hour through the transmission network interconnecting them. It is positive if the net energy exported is
greater than that imported. A large interchange, and large
variations in interchange over time, puts more stress on
the transmission lines. Thus, changes in the trend in
interchange is also a sign of potential change in grid’s
operational condition.
A. Peak (and trough) demand
Figure 4 shows the so-called violin plots, i.e., empirical
probability density functions (pdfs) estimates of the daily peak
of the hourly demand (MWh per hour) for three states: Florida,
California and New York. Data from Jan-May of a year is used
to estimate the pdf, using the kernel density estimator with a
Gaussian kernel.

We see from the plot that both in California and New York
have lower extreme values of the peak demand in first quarter
of 2020 when compared to 2019, but the trend is the opposite
in Florida. If peak demand was the sole determinant of the
stress on the grid, we can conclude that the stress on grid
operation has reduced in California and New York, but the
opposite has happened in Florida.
To check if there is a change in the peak demand because of
the pandemic, or is the change routinely occurring throughout
January-May 2020, we also look at the data in time domain.
Figure 5 shows the daily peak and trough of the hourly
electricity demand for Florida, California and New York. In
California and Florida, both the peak and trough were greater
in March 2020 than in March 2019. Following stay-at-home
orders, both peak and trough has decreased making their
difference comparable to those observed in 2019. But then
it changed back to pre-pandemic levels in late April.

Fig. 4: Distributions of daily peak demand (of hourly energy) in three regions in the US. Data from Jan - May, during 2019
and 2020, are used to estimate the pdfs.

The trend in New York is different from those in California
and Florida. The peak and trough of hourly demand decreased
consistently through March and April, in both 2018 and 2020.
Also, it did not show the “springing back” effect seen in
Florida and California until the end of May (2020). We also
extended the analysis period to January, and a similar trend
to daily total demand was observed here. Both peak and
trough demand for 2019 and 2020 steadily declined from early
January to the late May.
B. Demand ramp rate
Figure 6 compares the empirical probability density functions (pdfs) of the hourly demand ramp rate for the three
states in 2020 (after the pandemic) and 2019 (corresponding
period). The pdfs are estimated using data for a four week
period, starting on the statewide stay-at-home order for the
corresponding state, and for the same period in 2019. In
Florida, although the pdf has changed after the stay-at-home
order compared to the same period in 2019, the frequency of

larger values did not change significantly. There is no clear
change in California. In New York, larger ramp rates are
observed less frequently after the pandemic in 2020 than in
2019, meaning hourly demand is changing more slowly. From
the point of view of grid operation, that is a positive change.
These trends have appeared after the pandemic, and are
not part of a long term change in statistics of ramp rate.
Figure 7a, which compares the pdfs in January 2020 with
those in January 2019, support this observation. Ramp rate
statistics during January 2020 are quite similar to those in
2019. Another observation is that the trends that appeared right
after the pandemic have stayed that way and have not reverted
back; see May 2020 pdfs in Figure 7b.
C. Demand forecast error
Recall that the hourly demand forecast error is dk − dˆk ,
where dˆk is the forecast of hourly demand dk computed 24
hours earlier. The time series of hourly forecast error is highly
non-stationary. So we start with the daily average of the hourly

data. Figure 8 shows the daily mean of the hourly forecast
error, for 2020 and 2019 trends, from January to April.
Figure 8 shows that in California, the mean forecast error is
considerably smaller in 2020 than in 2019. It appears that 2019
was an outlier year: the 2018 forecast errors were considerably
smaller than those in 2019 as well. This makes it impossible
to compare the statistics after the pandemic with those from
the corresponding period in 2019 in any meaningful manner.
Therefore, we ignore California in the rest of the discussion
on forecast error, although we show the plots for the sake of
completeness.
For Florida and California, the mean forecast error does not
show a clear trend that is correlated with the pandemic. We,

therefore, examine the empirical pdfs to get a more detailed
picture of the demand forecast errors. Figure 9 compares the
empirical pdfs of the hourly forecast error during a four-week
period after the stay-at-home order in 2020 with those from the
same period in 2019. There is a discernible difference between
the 2020 and 2019 statistics—forecast errors have increased
for both Florida and New York after the pandemic.
To address the question about whether these changes are
really due to the pandemic or simply a part of a long change
between 2019 and 2020 already underway, we compare the
pdfs within 2020, before and after the pandemic. It appears
that the pandemic is the likely cause, as the forecast errors in
January 2020, before the pandemic, were significantly smaller

than in March/April (Figure 10a). In addition, the forecast
errors in NY show a clear “springing back” effect, but not in
Florida (Figure 10b).
Overall, the day ahead demand forecasts have been negatively affected by the pandemic in both Florida and New York.
In New York, they have recovered to pre-pandemic levels by
May but not in Florida.
D. Total interchange
Figure 11 shows the daily average of the hourly interchange
from January-May, and compares them between 2019 and
2020. There is no discernible pattern that can be attributed
to the pandemic, or for that mater, anything else. The time
series of hourly interchange data is highly non-stationary, with
variations in both short and long time scales. We therefore do
not present histograms: a much more extensive analysis will
be required to reveal anything useful.
IV. C ONTROLLING FOR WEATHER
Methods for weather correcting energy/electricity demand
data are typically based on cooling degree day and heating
degree day. The cooling degree day of a time duration with
average temperature T is the the cooling degree T C =
max(T − Tc,stpt , 0) times the number of days that the cooling
degree is positive. The cooling setpoint Tc,stpt is an average
measure of ambient temperature above which consumers start

using space cooling3 . Heating degree day (HDD) has a similar
definition, except now the excess temperature is the heating
temperature T H := max(Th,stpt −T, 0)with where the heating
setpoint Th,stpt is an average measure of ambient temperature
below which consumers start using space heating.
In the simplest model used for weather correction, electricity
demand in a time duration with average temperature T , and
corresponding cooling degree day T C and heating degree day
T H , is modeled as d = αC T C + αH T H + b where b is the
baseload, i.e. the weather-independent part of the demand, and
αC , αC are coefficients. To perform weather correction, the
unknown constants αH , αC , b are determined from pre-event
data. Then, the demand for a time interval of equal length after
the event occurs is predicted as dˆ = αC TkC +αH TkH +b, where
TkC , TkH are now computed from mean ambient temperature
observed after the event, with αC , αH , b previously estimated.
This prediction dˆ is a counterfactual demand, the demand that

0 T (t)dt, where T (t) = max(T (t) − Tc,stpt , 0) is the time varying
cooling degree. If the integral is expressed in °F-hour (or °C-hour), we call
it a cooling degree hour (CDH). Frequently it is expressed in °F-day (or
°C-day), and we call it a cooling degree day (CDD). A hypothetical day
that is a constant 2° F hotter than the cooling setpoint throughout the day
will have a CDH of 48 °F-hour, or a CDD of 2°F-day. A day that is 2°
F hotter than the cooling setpoint for 6 hours of the day will have a CDH
of 12 °F-hour and a CDD of 0.5°F-day. A similar definition is used for
heating degree hour (HDH) or heating degree day (HDD). Heating degree
day (HDD) has a similar definition, except now the excess temperature is the
heating temperature T H (t) := max(Th,stpt − T (t), 0).

if nothing other than the weather were to change from preevent to post event. The prediction dˆ is referred to as the
weather corrected demand4
For greater resolution and accuracy, the baseline demand
can be modeled as a time varying quantity. This is what
we do in this paper, and describe next. Recall that each
hour is denoted by a discrete counter k = 1, . . . , and dk
is the electricity demand during hour k and Tk is the mean
ambient temperature during hour k. The cooling and heating
4 There are in fact many methods for weather correction of energy data,
though they almost always use concepts of cooling and heating degree days.
These methods are known to suffer from many weaknesses. An excellent
summary of the difficulties with weather correction using degree days can be
found in [10].

day definitions above are applied to hourly samples, leading
to a cooling degree TkC = max(Tk − Tc,stpt , 0) and heating
degree TkC = max(Th,stpt − Tk , 0) at hour k, etc. We use
the following model of hourly electricity demand, where hour
k = 1 corresponds to 01:00:00 of Monday (morning):
dk = αH (TkH )2 + αC (TkC )2 + bk ,

k = 1, . . . , 168(= 24 × 7)
(1)

Justification for the quadratic terms is that the data we used
(described in the next section) showed such a relationship—
when electric energy demand was plotted against cooling
and heating degrees. The quantity bk is the hourly baseline
demand, which is independent of weather. The index k in (1)
only goes up to 7 days: we have assumed that consumer

behavior that determines weather-independent electricity consumption does not change from one week to another.
If we only have one week’s worth of hourly data, there are
2+168 = 170 variables in this model, with 168 measurements
so the model is highly under-determined. Almost any week’s
data can be explained by such a model extremely well, but its
predictive power cannot be assessed since there is no data left
to be used for out-of-sample testing. We can use additional
data from other weeks which will increase the number of
equations of the form (1), while the number of parameters to
fit remain the same since we have assumed that the baseload
bk does not change from week to week. The 170 unknown
parameters can then be estimated from the data, for instance,
by ordinary least squares.
Suppose we have m weeks of data. With hourly data
collection, the sample index k goes from 1 to 168 × m. To be
able to describe the model and the data in standard regression
form, we write it as
dk = αH (TkH )2 + αC (TkC )2 + bk0 ,

k = 1, . . . , m × 168
(2)

where k 0 = k mod 168. The model (1) can be written
compactly as dk = φk θ, where the unknown parameter vector
θ is
θ = [αH , αC , b1 , . . . , b168 ]T ∈ R170

(3)

and the regressor is the row vector

where d = [d1 , d2 , . . . , dn ] ∈ R , with n = 168 × m
denoting the total number of hourly time samples, and Φ =
[φT1 , φT2 , . . . , φTn ]T ∈ Rn×170 . The ordinary least square (OLS)
estimate of the unknown parameter θ is the solution to the
normal equation5 :
(ΦT Φ)θ = ΦT d ⇒ θ̂ = (ΦT Φ)−1 ΦT d.

(6)

The weather correction method with this model is the same as
in the simpler model. Suppose the model is trained with data
from year 2019, and denote by θ̂(2019) the parameter estimate
from the training. The weather corrected demand at hour k
during 2020 is the demand predicted by the model for weather
during the same hour of week in 2020:
(2020/2019)
dˆk
= φ2020
θ̂(2019) ,

5 Technical requirements such as full column rank of Φ are satisfied by the
data we applied the method to. Ideally one should pose the model training
problem as a constrained optimization problem with the constraint that all
the unknown parameters are non negative, but OLS never returned a negative
estimate for the data we used, meaning that if a quadratic cost were used the
solution will be the same.

An example of the model’s in-sample and out-of-sample

in Section IV-A. The model was trained with 2019 March

The model (1) was trained with hourly electricity data for
GRU and weather data for Gainesville, for March 2, 2019,
to March 31, 20196 . It was then used to predict the energy
consumption for March and April 2020 by using weather
data for that time period. Temperature measurements from the
University of Florida (UF) weather station, available through
alachua.weatherstem.com was used, since the UF campus is
in the middle of GRU territory. We chose the values of the
setpoints Th,stpt , Tc,stpt to be 64, 72° F, respectively, based on
an exhaustive search that led to the smallest fitting errors.
Figure 13 (top) shows the change in daily electricity demand
during March-April of 2020 from the counterfactual demand
with 2020 weather, i.e., what should have been the demand
had there been no change in baseload demand from the same
time 2019. More precisely, it shows the difference

A. Application to GRU (Gainesville Regional Utilities)
The immediate difficulty in applying the weather correction
method described above is the ambiguity in defining the ambient temperature Tk . One can perhaps take a weighted average
over many weather stations, with measurement of a station
weighted by the number of consumers around that station etc.,
but this method introduces more design choices that affect
the model’s prediction. To avoid this, we apply the weather
correction method to Gainesville Regional Utilities (GRU).
GRU’s service area is confined to the city of Gainesville, FL,
and a small area nearby. Apart from being an electric utility,
it is also a balancing authority (BA). Because GRU is a BA,
hourly data from GRU is available from EIA.

in the daily electricity use dt as a percentage of average daily
energy use in February 2020; the index t increments by 1
every day.
It appears there is an increase of about 10% in daily
electricity demand around the stay-at-home order issued by
the Alachua city that GRU territory is within. This raises a
number of questions, which we address next.
1) Is it really a 10% increase? The mean and standard

data is 0.6% and 3.9% and similar for the out-sample
testing data from 2018; see Figure 14. Since the mean
is so small, we assume the model’s predictions are
unbiased, and use 0 as the mean error for out of sample
predictions. Thus, we can conclude that there is a 95%
probability that the change in daily demand is between

2% and 16% of the February 2020 mean7 . There is
a 99% probability the increase is between −2% and
22%. Thus, while there is a likely increase in demand,
quantifying the increase with higher confidence will
require additional modeling and analysis.
7 The 95% confidence interval is ±2σ away from the mean, and 99%
confidence interval is ±3σ, assuming the errors are Gaussian. The residual
of the trained model show Gaussian-like distribution (figure not shown).

2) Why not “improve” the model? The model only
resolves baseload demand within a week, but ignores
seasonality over longer time scales. To avoid overfitting,
we must use a sufficient number of weeks of data for
training, so that n = 168 × m  170. At the same
time, we cannot use too many weeks of data, since that
data will surely violate the assumption that weatherindependent baseload does not change from week to
week. One can allow the baseload to vary across weeks
or months, introducing additional free parameters in the
model. One can also introduce more free parameters
for holidays and special events. But doing so will soon
lead to overfitting: the model will have nearly as many
free parameters as the number of measurements used to
estimate them. There will be little data left to test for
out-of-sample prediction accuracy of the model. For the
model to be trustworthy, it is not enough for the model
to fit the training data accurately. The out-of-sample
prediction accuracy of the model also needs to be high.
Only then, we can have confidence on the underlying
assumptions of the model. Since the model is trained
for March data, its validity reduces as we go further
away from March.Therefore,we do not use it for May
and beyond.
3) Why did the demand increase before the stay-athome order? Assuming the model’s prediction of an
increase in electricity demand is correct, why did the
increase occur even before the order? In other words, can
we blame the pandemic for the increase in demand? We
believe so. Although GRU does not serve the University
of Florida campus, the majority of Gainesville residents
and, thus, GRU customers are directly or indirectly
related to the university. In an email on March 11, 2020,
the University declared that all classes will be moved
online by Monday, March 16, and recommended all
students to return to their homes. It is thus very likely
that many GRU customers started to work from home
by March 16, 2020, and did not wait until March 24,
when Alachua county issued its stay-at-home order8 .
This may be the reason for the increase seen from March
17 onwards in Figure 13.
Although we can only speculate for the reasons of the
increase in electricity consumption due to the pandemic
in GRU, it is possible that the large residential consumer
base of GRU, coupled with the lack of large industries
in its territory, plays a role. If that is the case, this is an
example in which reduction of electricity consumption
in commercial buildings after the pandemic is more than
offset by the increase in consumption in residences due
to more people staying and working from home.
V. S UMMARY AND CONCLUSION
Unlike previous analyses that were done soon after the
pandemic started, our analysis benefits from examining data
8 This

is certainty true for the authors of this paper.

over a longer period of time. We found that contrary to the
observations in the prior work, none of these three regions
analyzed (New York, California, and Florida) showed a clear
reduction in the demand that can be ascribed to the pandemic.
In both electricity demand and variables such as peak
demand that can indicate stress on the power grid, we observed
large variability from one region to another. This is consistent
with EIA’s recent analysis on electricity demand across the
USA. In addition, while some of the indicators showed a
change in their statistics around the time stay-at-home orders
were issued (compared to their values from the same period
in 2019), they seemed to revert back to their pre-pandemic
or 2019 values by May 2020. Interestingly, some indicators
of stress indicated an increase in stress while others indicated
the opposite. If these trends are correct, that would mean the
change in consumers’ behavior due to the pandemic mitigation
efforts—in so far as it affects the power grid—was temporary.
Almost all earlier studies reported a reduction in electricity
demand coincident with COVID-19 mitigation efforts. Since
the pandemic is reducing economic activity, a reduction in
energy demand is expected. When it comes to electricity, such
a conclusion is less obvious. According to the EIA, buildings
consume 75% of the electricity in the US [12]. While electricity consumption in commercial buildings (offices, schools,
retail stores, restaurants etc.) may have reduced, it is possible
that such a reduction is offset by an increase in residential
building electricity consumption since people are staying and
working from home. Resolving this question requires that
we estimate the change due to other concomitant factors,
especially weather.
The weather correction exercise for a small balancing authority in Florida indicated that the pandemic led to an increase
in electricity demand there. Our speculation for the increase
is that the more people staying home is increasing residential
electricity demand, and the reduction in commercial demand
is not enough to offset it. Whether it is going to continue, or
whether such a trend is likely in larger regions, will require
further work.
The analysis presented here is a first step. It needs to be
continued and refined as the pandemic—and the mitigation
efforts to contain it—continues to evolve, to understand the
impact on consumer behavior and electricity sector.
The weather correction exercise also indicated that the inherent prediction error of the model is only marginally smaller
than the changes predicted by the model. This makes providing quantitative estimates of the weather-corrected change
challenging. Lack of careful evaluation of a model’s predictive power can be dangerous: a modeler can be swayed by
confirmation bias.
