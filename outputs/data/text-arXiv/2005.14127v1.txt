Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic led several countries to resort to social distancing, the only known way
to slow down the spread of the virus and keep the health system under control. Here we use an
individual based model (IBM) to study how the duration, start date and intensity of quarantine
affect the height and position of the peak of the infection curve. We show that stochastic effects,
inherent to the model dynamics, lead to variable outcomes for the same set of parameters, making
it crucial to compute the probability of each result. To simplify the analysis we divide the outcomes
in only two categories, that we call best and worst scenarios. Although long and intense quarantine
is the best way to end the epidemic, it is very hard to implement in practice. Here we show
that relatively short and intense quarantine periods can also be very effective in flattening the
infection curve and even killing the virus, but the likelihood of such outcomes are low. Long
quarantines of relatively low intensity, on the other hand, can delay the infection peak and reduce
its size considerably with more than 50% probability, being a more effective policy than complete
lockdown for short periods.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The novel Coronavirus [1] pandemic has changed the lives of millions of people around
the world. The lack of effective medications or a vaccine,[2–5] has made social distancing the
only reliable way to slow down the virus transmission and prevent the collapse of the health
system.[6–9] Quarantine measures are, however, difficult to implement and have enormous
economic consequences. This is leading many communities, from cities to entire countries,
to end quarantine even before the infection curve has reached its peak.[10–12] Understanding how quarantine duration, effectiveness and starting time affect the infection curve is,
therefore, key to guide public policies.
Several approaches have been recently proposed to model the COVID-19 epidemic,[13]
including muti-layer networks,[14] the Richards growth model,[15] and many others.[16–19]
Since our interest here is to quantify the effectiveness of a non-pharmacological intervention,
we opted for a SEIR (susceptible, exposed, infected and recovered) individual based model

(IBM) and studied how different types of quarantine change the infection dynamics. Individuals are modeled as nodes of a scale-free (Barabási-Albert) network [20] that can only
infect their connected neighbors. Because the dynamics is stochastic, independent simulations with the same set of parameters can lead to quite different outcomes. Here we group
the outcomes in only two categories, that we call best and worst scenarios. Stochasticity, a
reality of the Sars-Cov-2 infection, is not captured by the mean field approximation of the
SEIR model,[21] where outcomes depend deterministically on the model parameters.
We find three types of quarantine that can be effective against the epidemic: (i) relatively
long (10 weeks) and intense (more than 80% isolation); (ii) short (8 weeks) and of intermediate intensity (around 70% isolation) and; (iii) long (12 weeks or more) with relatively low
intensity (40% isolation). The first type, which completely ends the epidemic, is clearly the
best but also the most difficult to achieve. The second type is feasible, but we find that
most of the times (in most of the simulations) they result in worst case scenarios. The third
type emerges as the most practical and easy to apply. It is not so effective as the previous
types, but does decrease the infection peak by half. Also, it falls into the best case scenario
more than 50% of the times and even in the worst scenarios the infection peak decreases.

II.

THE MODEL

We model the spread of the virus using an extension of the SEIR model (susceptible,
exposed, infected and recovered (or removed)). Exposed individuals simulate the incubation
period of the disease, when infected subjects cannot yet pass on the virus. The mean field
version of SEIR model is described by the equations
Ṡ = −βSI/N
Ė = βSI/N − σE
I˙ = σE − γI

(1)

Ṙ = γI
where N is the population size, β is the infection rate, σ the rate at which exposed become
infected and γ the recovery rate. The basic reproductive number, R0 = β/γ, gives the
number of secondary infections generated by the first infectious individual over the full
course of the epidemic in a fully susceptible population.

FIG. 1. Illustration of virus spread on the network: (a) initially only one individual is infected
(red) and all the others susceptible (green); (b) neighbors of infected might get the virus (yellow);
(c) one neighbor did get the virus and become exposed (orange); (d) neighbors of first infected
individual might still get the virus, but the orange node is still in incubation time; (e) another node
gets the virus from the first infected becoming exposed and the old exposed becomes infected; (f)
more nodes might get the virus (yellow) and; (g) some do become exposed while the first infected
becomes recovered.

In order to take into account heterogeneity in the number of contacts we use instead an
individual based model where the population is represented by a Barabási-Albert network
[20, 22, 23] with N of nodes and an average degree D. As in a deterministic SEIR model, the
nodes can be classified as susceptible, exposed, infected and recovered. Susceptible individuals
can become exposed if connected to an infected one; exposed individual i becomes infected
after a period ti of virus incubation; infected individuals can recover, and once recovered it
is considered immune and therefore cannot be infected again.
4

At the beginning of the simulation, only one node, chosen at random, is infected while
all the remaining population is susceptible. Every susceptible node connected to the infected individual becomes exposed with the transmission probability p whereas the infected node might itself recover with probability r. The probability p can be calculated
as p = R0 /(τsymp D), where τsymp is the average time duration of symptoms. We assume
that the symptoms last for a time τ distributed according to an exponential distribution
F(τ ) = λe−λτ . Once a node is exposed, it stays exposed for an incubation time ti , chosen
according to a given distribution P(ti ).[24] After this period it becomes infected and is able
to infect other nodes. It follows that r ≈ λ = 1/τsymp , for small λ. For P(ti ) we have used a
Γ(α, β) distribution, as in [25]. Fig. 1 illustrates the network of contacts, states of individuals (S, I, E, or R) and the infection dynamics. For the simulations, we fixed the number
of individuals N = 2000, the average degree D ≈ 98, mean incubation time 6.5 days with
standard deviation 2.6 days (α = 6.25 and β ≈ 0.96), R0 = 2.4 and τsymp = 14 days.[26–28]
We run the simulations until the epidemic ends and no new infection is possible.
We model quarantine periods by reducing the transmission probability p by the factor
(1 − Q), where Q represents the intensity of quarantine, varying from 0 (no quarantine) to
1 (full quarantine). Duration and starting time are specified by period [ts , ts + td ]. We shall
see that all three quarantine parameters (starting time ts , duration td and intensity Q) have
significant effects on the dynamics, particularly on the infection peak height and delay.

III.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Unlike the mean field SEIR model, Eqs.(1), the present IBM version on networks is
probabilistic and different outcomes are obtained every time the model is ran with the same
set of parameters. To obtain statistically significant data (while keeping simulation time
reasonable) we have ran the model 25 times for different quarantine duration and intensities,
beginning ts = 20, 30, and 40 days after the first infected node appears (at the beginning
of the simulation). The results were divided in two different scenarios, the best and the
worst cases. For each set of parameters, the best scenario consists of simulations where
the infection peak is lower than the average peak of the full set of simulations, whereas the
worst scenario contains the set with higher than average peaks. This approach is important
because in many cases the epidemic response to the quarantine is not satisfactory, and
5

this might be solely due to stochastic effects, a common feature of real systems. As an
example, Fig. 2 shows the evolution curves of infected plus exposed individuals for all 25
replicas for Q = 0.9 and td = 10 weeks. Since independent populations, represented by
different Barabási-Albert networks generated with the same specifications, under the same
quarantine parameters might respond drastically different to quarantine, we also need to
know the probability of each outcome.

of the highest peak of each curve. Red and green dashed lines show the average peak of worst (8
replicas) and best (17 replicas) scenarios respectively, i. e., the average peak of the curves in which
there is a second peak, after the quarantine, and the average peak of those in which there is not a
second peak. The average of all curves (black thick line) is not representative of any actual curve.
The gray shaded area indicates the quarantine period.

Figures 3, 4 and 5 show results for average peak height, time of infection peak and
fraction of recovered individuals at the end of the epidemic (i.e., all individuals that had
6

contact with the virus, as we do not take mortality into account). The results in each case
are separated into best and worst scenarios and we compute the probability that a best
scenario will happen. For example, a specific set of parameters might result in ending the
epidemic, but its probability of occurrence can be too low, excluding it as a recommended
policy. All results are displayed as heat-maps.

after the first infection (left, middle and right columns respectively). Plots in the first and second
rows show the best and worst scenarios. The third row shows the probability that a simulation
results in a best scenario. Quarantine duration is measured in weeks (from 1 to 15) and quarantine
intensity goes from 0 (no quarantine) to 1 (full individual lock-down, p = 0). Green, red and purple
ellipses highlight parameter regions of interest. White vertical and horizontal reference lines mark
Q = 70% and td = 8 weeks.

Fig. 3 shows how peak height varies with quarantine duration, intensity and start date.
This information is complemented by Fig. 4, that shows how peak center changes with
7

quarantine parameters, and Fig. 5, displaying the proportion of recovered individuals at
the end of the epidemic. The purple ellipse in Fig. 3 marks the parameter region where
quarantine is very intense and lasts for more than 8 weeks, an ideal situation that works
around 90% of the times but is very hard to enforce in practice. In this case the epidemic
stops quickly (blue areas in Fig. 4) and less than 10% of the population is infected (green
areas in Fig. 5).
The red ellipse in Fig. 3 shows a transition zone where the best scenario corresponds to
substantial curve flattening. The center of the red ellipse is at Q ≈ 0.5 for ts = 20 but shifts
to Q ≈ 0.9 for ts = 40, showing the importance of starting quarantine early. For all values
of ts the red ellipse is centered at td ≈ 6 weeks, which is a relatively short duration. Peak
center, however, is not delayed in the best case scenarios. Importantly, best case scenarios
are very unlikely in this region, occurring with probability around 20%.
Finally, the region surrounded by the green ellipse in Fig. 3 corresponds to long but
moderate intensity quarantines. For the three values of ts considered peak height was reduced
by about 50% in the best case scenarios, which happens about 50% of the times. Peak center
was not significantly delayed in the best scenarios, but was pushed forward in the worst
scenarios, where peak height was reduced to about 70% with respect to non-quarantine
height. Interestingly, in both scenarios about 70% of the population was infected at the
end of the simulation, showing that herd immunity was achieved (corresponding to the pink
areas in Fig 5).
Quarantine can also be implemented in the mean field model, Eqs. (1).[27] This is
accomplished by integrating the dynamical equations with the infection rate β0 for t ∈ [0, ts ],
with the reduced value βQ = (1 − Q)β0 during quarantine period ts < t < ts + td and again
with β0 for t > ts + td . Fig. 6 shows how results of mean field model differ from the IBM
simulations. Panel (a) shows the dynamics without quarantine according to the mean field
(thick lines) and 25 simulations with the IBM. Panel (b) shows the effects of quarantine on
the mean field model for Q = 0.35, td = 10 weeks and several starting times ts . According to
the mean field model quarantine is effective only if started later, otherwise the infection curve
peaks at high values when the quarantine is over. The right panels compare IBM simulations
(c) and mean field results (d) for ts = 30 days and td = 15 weeks for several quarantine
intensities Q. The mean field infection curves always grow to high values when quarantine
is over, whereas the IBM simulations show many examples of low peak values and total

importance of heterogeneous social interactions represented by the Barabási-Albert network
and stochastic dynamics in epidemiological modeling.

CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we considered the effects of quarantine duration, starting date and intensity
in the outcome of epidemic spreading in a population presenting heterogeneous degrees of
connections. The model is stochastic and curves representing numbers of infected individuals
vary considerably from one simulation to the other even when all model parameters are fixed.
In order to distinguish between different outcomes we have divided them into two groups
with the best and worst results based on the height of the infection peak (below or above
the average height, respectively).
We have further divided the results into four qualitative classes delimited by the three
ellipses in Fig. 3 plus the rest of the diagram. Besides the obvious region indicated by the
purple ellipse where quarantine is very intense and long, we found that short but not so

intense quarantine (red ellipse) does not work, since the probability of an outcome in the
best scenario is very low. Instead, long but average intensity quarantine is both likely to
work and flattens the infection curve by around 50%, being the best alternative given the
current assumptions. Indeed, the infection peak is considerably delayed in the region of the
green ellipse when it falls into the worst scenario, confirming it as the best bet for preventing
the health system breakdown (Fig. 4 ). The proportion of the population that had contact
with the virus at the end of the epidemic (number of recovered individuals, Fig. 5) leads
to more than 60% of the population, very close to achieving herd immunity. Comparing to
the other regions, this seems to be the best option to control the epidemics under the model
assumptions. We note, however, that the model does not account for deaths. If achieving
herd immunity implies high mortality, the best option would be long and intense quarantine
(purple ellipses in Fig. 3), the only way to avoid large number of infections and, therefore.
high mortality.
We found that differences between mean field and stochastic models are very significant
with respect to the effects of quarantine. In many cases as the former cannot control the
epidemic, as the infection peak grows again once the quarantine period is over, whereas the

latter can end the epidemic in the best case scenarios.
We recall that we used uniform decrease in infection rate as a proxy for quarantine. This
is a simplified approach and other methods could be implemented to verify the robustness
of the results. Also, different network topologies might affect the spread of the epidemics.
Random uniform (Erdos-Renyi) [22] networks should produce results similar to mean field
simulations, but small-world [22, 29] or other topologies could speed up or slow down the
spread dynamics.
Our model is particularly suited to study spread between connected cities, that can be
represented by modules of a larger network. We have also kept information about the virus
DNA and its mutations, allowing us to reconstruct the phylogeny and classify its strains as
it propagates. These results will be published in a forthcoming article.
