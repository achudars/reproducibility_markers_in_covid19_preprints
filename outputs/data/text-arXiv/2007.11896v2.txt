Abstract
In this work, we study the causal relations among German regions in terms
of the spread of Covid-19 since the beginning of the pandemic, taking
into account the restriction policies that were applied by the different
federal states. We propose and prove a new theorem for a causal feature
selection method for time series data, robust to latent confounders, which we
subsequently apply on Covid-19 case numbers. We present findings about the
spread of the virus in Germany and the causal impact of restriction measures,
discussing the role of various policies in containing the spread. Since our
results are based on rather limited target time series (only the numbers of
reported cases), care should be exercised in interpreting them. However, it is
encouraging that already such limited data seems to contain causal signals.
This suggests that as more data becomes available, our causal approach
may contribute towards meaningful causal analysis of political interventions
on the development of Covid-19, and thus also towards the development of
rational and data-driven methodologies for choosing interventions.

Introduction

The ongoing outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic has rendered the tracking of the virus spread
a problem of major importance, in order to better understand the role of the demographics
and of political measures taken to contain the virus. Until 15/5/2020, 175,699 cases and
8,001 deaths were recorded in Germany, a country with a population of 83 million people, 16
federal states with independent local governments, and 412 districts (Landkreise). In this
paper, we focus on a causal time series analysis of the Covid-19 spread in Germany, aiming
to understand the spatial spread and the causal role of the applied restriction measures.
Causal inference from time series is a fundamental problem in data science, and many papers
provide solutions for parts of the problem subject to necessary assumptions [1–6]. The main
difficulty in this research problem is the possibility of hidden confounding in the data, as it
is almost impossible in real datasets to have observed all the necessary information. Another
problem is a characteristic of the time series themselves, which create dependencies due to
connections in the past, hindering the formulation of necessary d-separation statements for
Preprint. Under review.

graphical inference [7]. Finally, many known methods cannot handle instantaneous effects
that may exist among the time series.
We consider a problem with small sample size compared to the dimension of its covariates,
yet of significant current importance: the tracking of the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic,
based only on the reported cases. Not having access to all relevant covariates and to all
interventions that were applied at different times by different regions constitutes a heavily
confounded problem, whose causal analysis requires a method which is robust to hidden
confounders. Tracking the Covid-19 spread is of interest since it may help understand and
contain the virus. There are significant efforts to understand this based on individual location
or proximity information [8]. Other efforts try to understand and quantify the importance of
applied restriction measures through modelling of the spread [9–12]. In the present work, we
focus on the causal analysis of the spread. We perform an offline causal inference analysis of
the reported daily Covid-19 case numbers in regions of Germany, in combination with the
restriction measures that were applied to contain the spread.
The most common and established approach for causal inference on time-series is Granger
causality [13–15]. In the multivariate case, we say that X j Granger-causes X k (k 6= j) if a
j
conditional dependence Xtk 6⊥
⊥ Xpast(t)
| X−j
past(t) exists (here, −j denotes all indices other
0
than j, and past(t) denotes all indices t < t). The fundamental disadvantage of this method
is its reliance on causal sufficiency: the assumption that all the common causes in the system
are observed; in other words, that no hidden confounders can exist [16]. Violations of this,
common in real world data, render Granger causality and its extensions [e.g. 17, 18] incorrect,
yielding misleading conclusions.
Below, we propose and prove a theoretical extension that relaxes the stricter assumption
of the SyPI algorithm [6], a causal feature selection method for time series with latent
confounders. We apply it on Covid-19 cases reported by German regions, with the goal to
detect which regions and which restriction policies played a causal role on the formation and
modulation of the regionally-reported daily cases. We perform this analysis on a state and on
a district level. We compare our findings with predictions of the widely used Lasso-Granger
method [19], showing that SyPI yields more meaningful results. Note that while no ground
truth exists, our detected causes tend to be neighbouring states/regions, with discrepancies
that can often plausibly be attributed to the existence of major transportation hubs.

Methods and Tasks
Causal inference on time series

Figure 1: An example full time graph of two observed (X i , X j ), one potentially hidden (Qj )
and one target (Y ) time series.
For the problem of causal feature selection on time series data, we are given observations
from a target time series Y := (Yt )t∈Z whose causes we wish to find, and observations
from a multivariate time series X := ((Xt1 , . . . , Xtd ))t∈Z of potential causes (candidate time
series). In settings were Causal sufficiency cannot be assumed, like the one we tackle here,
unobserved multivariate time series, which may act as common causes of the observed ones
also exist. An example of such a setting is given in Figure 1.

2.2

The SyPI method

Here we use and theoretically extend the SyPI method proposed by [6], as it can give
causal conclusions in large, dense graphs of time series, based solely on observational data
and without assuming causal sufficiency. According to [6], the method requires, as input,
observations from a target time series Y and from a multivariate time series (candidate
causes) X, as defined above. Moreover, it allows for unobserved multivariate time series,
which may act as hidden confounders. Under suitable assumptions discussed in Section 2.3,
the method provably detects all the direct causes of the target and some indirect ones, but
never confounded ones (its conditions are both necessary and sufficient1 ).
We now try to provide some intuition. Since it requires familiarity with (and terminology of)
causal structure learning, some readers may want to consult [6]. For each candidate causal
time series X i that has a dependency with the target Y at lag wi , the method performs
i
targeted isolation of the path Xt−1
→ Xti - -Qjt0 99K Yt+wi (where wi ∈ Z, t0 < t + wi , Qj ∈
−i
X or unobserved), that contains, for every candidate i, the current Xti and the previous
i
time step Xt−1
of the candidate causal time series, and the corresponding node of the target
time series Yt+wi .2 It does so by building a conditioning set that contains the nodes of
X−i that enter node Yt+wi −1 (temporal ancestor of the target node Yt+wi of the same time
series), including the node itself. This way, it exploits the fact that if there is a confounding
path between Xti and Yt+wi , then Xti will be a collider that will unblock the path between
i
Xt−1
and Yt+wi when we condition on it. Therefore, running SyPI boils down to testing
two conditions: condition 1 examines if Xti and Yt+wi are conditionally dependent given
i
the aforementioned conditioning set, and condition 2 examines if Xt−1
and Yt+wi become
i
conditionally independent if Xt is included in the aforementioned conditioning set. If both
conditions hold true, then SyPI identifies X i as a cause of Y [6].
2.3

Weakening SyPI’s assumptions

According to [6] SyPI is a sound and complete causal feature selection method in the presence
of latent common causes subject to certain graph restrictions. Among the most important
graphical assumptions required is that the target be a sink node (assumption 6 in [6]), i.e.,
the target has no descendants. In Theorem A below, we relax this strict assumption, proving
that it suffices that none of the (direct or indirect) descendants of the target belongs in the
pool of the candidate causes. While this relaxation is important for our application, we
prefer not to repeat all assumptions and definitions from [6]. Rather, we describe below
what needs to be adapted to handle our more general setting.
The intuition behind Theorem A is the following. The original assumption 6 ensures that
when an unconfounded path Xti → Yt+wi for some lag wi exists, the true cause X i will not
be rejected due to a parallel path Xti → Xtj0 ← Yt+wi that contains a collider Xtj0 , which
could potentially be unblocked rendering condition 2 of Theorem 2 in [6] false. Theorem 1 of
[6] remains unaffected from whether Y is a sink node or not, because in the case that it is
not, i.e., Xti ← Yt+wi , condition 2 will correctly reject Xti .
Therefore, we only need to show that Theorem 2 of [6] remains unaffected if instead of Y
being a sink node, all of its descendants do not belong in X (we write DEGY 6∈ X). In the
case that all the descendants of Y do not belong in its candidate causes X, then they will
be unobserved. Assume there is one descendant D 6∈ X of Y that is also connected with
a node Xti from X. Then D can only have incoming arrows from Xti and therefore D is
an unobserved collider (any out-coming arrow from D to X will violate the assumption
DEGY 6∈ X). Therefore any path that contains the unobserved collider D cannot be unblocked
to create any additional dependencies, because D and any of its descendants cannot belong
in the conditioning set.
1
Although SyPI’s conditions are necessary only for single-lag dependencies, the method has
provided satisfying results even with multiple lags [6]. The existence of multiple lags would only
result in fewer detected causes, without affecting the validity of the method in terms of false positives.

Theorem A (Theorems 1 and 2 from [6] still apply). Given the target time series Y
and the candidate causes X, assuming Causal Markov condition, causal faithfulness, no
backward arrows in time Xti0 6→ Xtj , ∀t0 > t, ∀i, j, stationarity of the full time graph as well as
assumption A7-A9 from [6], if the target Y is not a sink node, but, instead, none of its direct
or indirect descendants belongs in X: DEGY 6∈ X, then Theorem 1 and 2 from [6] still apply.
That means the conditions of Theorem 1 from [6] are still sufficient for identifying direct
and indirect causes, and conditions of Theorem 2 from [6] are still necessary for identifying
all the direct unconfounded causes.

We prove Theorem A in the Appendix (Section 7.2.2).
While the relaxed assumption makes the result more generally applicable, we need one
additional step to apply it to our dataset: The algorithm requires as input the candidates
and the target as two separate variables. Therefore, we need to assign one region at a time as
target. In order to comply with the aforementioned assumption, instead of directly feeding
all the remaining time series as the candidate causes of the target Y , we use as candidate
causes those other regions that have reported Covid-19 cases before the target (in
addition to the applied policies for the analysis at the federal states level). This makes it
more likely that no effects of the target exist in its candidate causes (assuming stationarity
of the graph).
SyPI assumes that the causal relations among the time series are stationary, not changing
in different time windows. However, since we do not know the ground truth, it is possible
that the policies not only cause the reported infections time series but also be caused by
it in different time windows. This possible violation of stationarity of the graph creates
problems because it also implies arrows from the target to some of the policies time series
which belong in its candidate causes. Therefore this could violate both the assumption 6 in
[6] about the target being a sink node and the relaxed proposed assumption DEGY 6∈ X. We
are aware that this could happen, which is one reason we are careful in our conclusions.
The source code for the analysis presented here can be found in the supplement.

2.4

Selection of statistical thresholds

Since the causal Markov condition and causal faithfulness are assumed (definitions 7.2.1,
7.2.1), there is an equivalence between d-separation statements in the graph and conditional
independences on the probability distributions of the variables. As [6], we use SyPI for
linear relationships only (although the theory is more general), and hence resort to partial
correlations to test the conditional dependence (condition 1) and the conditional independence (condition 2) of [6]. SyPI operates with two thresholds for those two tests: one for
rejecting conditional independencies (condition 1), and another for accepting conditional
independencies (condition 2). Since the time series of the daily reported cases since the
beginning of the pandemic in Germany include only 87 reported days, we decided to explore
the outcomes of the algorithm for stricter and looser thresholds. We thus examined values
of threshold-1 in {0.01, 0.05} and values for threshold-2 in {0.1, 0.2}. We report the causal
findings for the looser combination (0.05, 0.1) in Fig. 3a and for all four in the supplement
(Fig. 5).

Figure 2: Time series of daily reported detected Covid-19 cases in each federal state from
28/01/2020 until 15/05/2020. The blue curve represents the daily reported infections as a
function of time. In addition to the Covid-19 cases, 9 restriction measures are depicted as
indicator functions (see legend and main text). The height of the indicator functions does
not have a meaning. It is only adjusted for visibility purposes.

The data are taken from the official reports of the Robert-Koch Institute, last downloaded
on 15/05/2020 [20]. They are analysed in two steps:
Causal analysis on federal state level Figure 2 depicts daily reported Covid-19 cases
for each of the 16 German federal states, each one represented by a time series, starting
from when the first report was made (28/01/2020) until 15/05/2020. The plots are sorted
chronologically, with the top left corresponding to the Bundesland (federal state) that
reported first, and the bottom right the Bundesland that reported Covid-19 cases last. In
addition, we created indicator functions for nine restriction measures that were imposed
separately in each Bundesland, as gathered from the official German states’ websites and
from https://calc.systemli.org/u0o26ims15cr. The periods these measures were in
effect are depicted as indicator functions (vertically scaled to make sure all are visible) in the
above plots. The policies are: closing of schools, closing of universities, ban of gatherings
of more than 1000 people, ban of gatherings of more than 10 people, obligatory quarantine
of 14 days after returning from risk areas, ban of gatherings of more than 2 people, closing
restaurants, closing hotels, forbidding visits in hospitals and nursing homes. We provide
the data in the supplement and here https://owncloud.tuebingen.mpg.de/index.php/
s/r4dPdpSBAzP6Ee5. Note that not all policies were applied in all federal states, and also
that for the state of Niedersachsen, no policies are provided. We apply the algorithm for each
target state independently, keeping as candidates all the federal states that have reported
cases before the target one, as well as the nine aforementioned policies for the specific target.
Results are shown in Figure 3a.
Causal analysis on district level To get further results, we apply the modified SyPI
method on the time series of daily reported Covid-19 cases for all 412 districts of Germany.
We apply it the following way: For every district we use SyPI twice; the first time using as
candidate causes all the neighbouring districts of the target that have reported cases before,
and the second time, using the same number of districts but from random non-neighbour
(distant) locations that have also reported cases before the target. Our hope would be that
5

SyPI will identify more causes among the neighbour districts than among the non-neighbour
ones. Furthermore, we would hope that (some of) the latter could be justified by a large
airport close-by. The default thresholds of SyPI (0.01, 0.2) were used. For this analysis, we
created a matrix with all the neighbour districts of each district, as well as the location of the
largest airports (including the number of flights from the past years), which we also provide
in the supplement. Furthermore, for the largest airports in terms of number of passengers
per year, according to the German flight security organisation (DFS) (MUC, STR, TXL,
FDH, FMM, NUE, HAM, FRA, HHN, HAJ, NRN, CGN, DUC, DMT, DRS, BRE, KSF,
SCN), we check which districts are near (within 40km) each one of these. In total, 169 out
of the total 412 districts were found to be near one of the large airports. The 40km distance
was chosen as it corresponds to the diameter of a medium size German district. We then
categorise our results in four categories: 1. Detected causes among the neighbours of the
target, 2. Detected causes near (within 40km) the target, 3. Detected causes near (within
40km) a large airport, 4. Distant targets that cannot be categorised otherwise.

3.2

Comparison against Lasso-Granger

As a baseline for the modified SyPI method for the spread of Covid-19 in the German federal
states, we use Lasso-Granger [19]. Granger causality is the most widely used method for
causal time series analysis, although it assumes causal sufficiency, which we expect to be
heavily violated in real data.

4.1

Results

SyPI on Covid-19 cases and policies in the federal states

In Figure 3a, the policies and federal states that were identified as causes by SyPI are
depicted with target/color specific arrows. Fig. 3a correspond to the “looser” combination of
thresholds (0.05, 0.1). Figure 5 (supplement) provides results for all four combinations. As
we can see, the result does not change dramatically with different threshold combinations,
but as expected, more causes are detected with the “looser” combination (0.05, 0.1), as it
more easily accepts dependencies and independencies. We discuss the findings in Section 5.1.

4.2

SyPI vs Granger

Table 1 in the supplement presents all the detected causes (states and policies) of each
federal state, for the SyPI method and thresholds (0.05, 0.1), as well as for the Lasso-Granger
method. With these "loose" thresholds we expect the largest number of detected causes
with SyPI (corresponding to the bottom left map in Figure 3a). We see that Lasso-Granger
detects almost all candidates as causes. This indicates that this is a dataset with many
latent confounders, which forces Granger to give incorrect causal claims. On the other hand,
SyPI is robust against false positives due to latent common causes, and thus gives potentially
more meaningful results.

Figure 3: a) Detected causal paths of the spread of Covid-19 among the German federal
states, including causes among the restriction measures taken by each federal state. Each
colour (in arrows and policies) indicates causes of one state (see top legend). These findings
correspond to the looser of the four combinations of thresholds (0.05, 0.1) that we tested.
Results for the remaining three combinations can be found in Fig. 5 in the supplement. b)
Detected causal districts for the spread of Covid-19, for each district, using the modified
SyPI algorithm. Solid arrows depict causes that are neighbour districts (i.e., sharing a
common border). Dashed arrows depict causes that are not. The majority of the detected
non-neighbour causes are close to cities with larger airports (MUC, STR, TXL, FDH, FMM,
NUE, HAM, FRA, HHN, HAJ, NRN, CGN, DUC, DMT, DRS, BRE, KSF, SCN), and the
majority of the detected causes are neighbours to the target. Note that since the dashed
arrows are significantly longer than the solid ones, the Figure at first glance seems to show
mostly dashed arrows. This is misleading; for a numeric comparison, see Figure 4a. Blue
cycles indicate 40km radius around the largest airports. For the district-level analysis, the
default thresholds of SyPI were used (0.01, 0.2)
4.3

Enacted policies and causal roles of federal states

Here we discuss the relation between the outcome of the above causal analysis and the
applied restriction measures. This time, instead of looking for causes of Covid-19 cases in
German federal states, we look at the states that helped contain the spread of the pandemic
by not causing others. We make an observation that may serve as additional sanity check
about the causal predictions of SyPI, using its stricter thresholds results:3 states that were
not found to cause other states were those that closed schools and universities “early enough”
(meaning before 100 cases were reported): Bremen, Thüringen, Saarland, Brandenburg,
Sachsen-Anhalt and Sachsen (with the exception of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern). In addition,
the German states that were found to cause others were also those that either did not take
both measures combined (Schleswig-Holstein, Nordrhein-Westfalen, Rheinland-Pfalz 4 ), or
3
Notice that this result should be treated with caution as it depends on the correctness of the
above causal analysis and it may be confounded by the time order that the states reported causes.
4
The arrow Rheinland-Pfalz → Thüringen does not appear in the subplot of strict thresholds
because the p-value (0.011) for condition 1 was on the limit over the strict threshold 1 (0.01).

the airports by the number of detected causes.

they took them relatively late (i.e., > 100 cases) (Bayern, Baden-Württemberg, Hamburg,
Hessen).

4.4

Causal spread of Covid-19 among the German districts

Since the number of federal states is relatively small, we ran our analysis also at a finer level of
granularity, using districts rather than states. Figure 3b depicts the map of Germany with all
the detected causal districts for each district. Arrows with solid lines show neighbour causes,
while arrows with dashed lines depict causes that do not share a border with the target. We
see that for the majority of the target districts the detected causes are neighbouring districts,
and that those that are not are generally near a large airport or within 40km distance from
the target. Note that since the dashed arrows are significantly longer than the solid ones,
the Figure at first glance seems to show mostly dashed arrows. This is misleading; for a
numerical comparison, see Figure 4a. Distant causal districts often seem to be aligned with
the routes of the domestic connections with the highest traffic, as reported in the DFS’s
latest flight report [21]. These are: Berlin - Munich, Berlin - Frankfurt, Düsseldorf - Munich,
Cologne/ Bonn - Munich, Düsseldorf - Berlin, Stuttgart - Hamburg, Frankfurt - Munich,
Berlin - Stuttgart, with 1-2 million flights per year. These paths can be seen in Figure 3b,
made up of detected longer-range dashed causal arrows. Table 2 with the causal results
shown in Figure 3b can be found in the supplement.
We categorise the total number of 231 causes detected into the following four categories: 1.
Detected causes neighbouring (sharing common borders) the target district, 2. Detected
causes near (∼ 40km) to the target, 3. Detected causes close to a large airport, 4. Distant
targets that cannot be categorised otherwise. As we can see in Figure 4a, the majority
of causes are neighbour districts, and only the 12% of the causes cannot be justified by
proximity to the target or a large airport. Figure 4b shows the histogram of the detected
causes that are located close to a large airport, in cases where also the target is reachable by
another airport.

Discussion
Findings of the causal analysis

We performed a causal analysis both on a federal state/policy level, and on a more finegrained district level. We tried normalising the case numbers in different ways (e.g., dividing
by the maximum), but the results were not much affected. We decided not to normalise
the data by population, as we felt this would unduly enhance the influence of less populous
states.
For the policy analysis, we compared the findings of SyPI with the predictions of the widely
used Lasso-Granger method [19]. We did not compare with seqICP [2], which is a feature
selection method, since this method requires that no interventions are applied on the target.
In the present setting, the target always is subject to interventions. Lasso-Granger detected
almost every candidate region and distancing measure as causal, which is not surprising in a
confounded real-world dataset like the present one.
SyPI, on the other hand, yielded more meaningful results. We saw that the causes detected
by SyPI on a district level tended to be neighbouring German districts, modulo the presence
of major airports (which tend to be associated with industrial hubs). The pattern for federal
states was consistent with this, but since there are fewer federal states than districts, numbers
are small. The results in Figure 3a seem meaningful in that much of the spread is local.
In addition, Bayern and Baden-Württemberg, the federal states with the largest current
Covid-19 incidence,5 have almost no arrows coming in from other states (see also Fig. 5). In
the district-level analysis only 38 out of 167 detected causes of targets in these two federal
states belonged to another state. The majority of detected causes was due to internal mobility
(84.7% for Baden-Württemberg and 73% for Bayern). It is believed that those states (which
lie in the South) had a strong influx of cases from Italy and Austria, where the pandemic
took hold earlier.6 As a noteworthy detail, our algorithm identified Tirschenreuth (northeast
Bavaria) as the cause of all its neighbouring districts (Wunsiedel im Fichtelgebirge, Bayreuth,
Neustadt an der Waldnaab). On March 7th, a large beer festival took place in the town
of Mitterteich in the district of Tirschenreuth, with a strong subsequent local COVID-19
outbreak.7
Furthermore, we saw that for the federal states, different restriction policies were found as
causal, yet the majority agreed on the importance of closing the universities and schools.
Our findings about the causal role of banning gatherings of more than 1000 people, followed
by closing of schools and ban of meetings of more than 2 people, are also in agreement with
the modeling analysis of [9].
5.2

Validity of assumptions made

A potential issue is the time delay between the application of a restriction measure and the
observation of its effects on the target. Note that schools and universities were (often) closed
later than some other measures were taken, e.g., the ban on larger gatherings. With SyPI, it
is hard to infer which measure had the strongest effect unless we knew exactly the incubation
time of each measure and actually shift the time series of cases by a corresponding amount.
As we learn more about epidemiological parameters of Covid-19 (e.g., on the typical time
delay between infection and being tested positive), we may be able to perform the latter
analysis.
As mentioned in Section 2.3, we assume that the policies affect the target (Covid-19 cases)
and not the other way around, in order to comply with our requirement that none of the
descendants of the target belongs in its candidate causes. This may be violated if policies
were adjusted based on the observed number of positive cases. We can be sure from the
theoretical point of view that the detected causes are not confounded covariates. However,

the method will likely have failed to detect all the true causes, if the aforementioned violation
applies. With Theorem A we relaxed the strict assumption of SyPI about the target being a
sink node, by requiring only that it has no descendants among its candidates. In practice,
we try to ensure this by selecting as candidates only regions that have already reported
cases before the target. This makes it likely that no (or few) effects of the target exist in its
candidate causes.
5.3

Contributions & conclusions

Motivated by an application on Covid-19 spreading, we stated and proved a Theorem relaxing
the assumption of the causal feature selection algorithm SyPI of [6], making it applicable
to a causal analysis of daily reported Covid-19 cases of German states and districts and
state-wise social distancing measures. While ground truth is not available, our results as
discussed in Section 5.1 seem meaningful. Possibly the biggest weakness of our approach lies
in the fact that the data we used is confined: (1) we only look at case numbers, in contrast
to more sophisticated methods to track the spread of an epidemic using contact tracing
or even genetic analyses [22]. Moreover, (2) the sample size is small (the pandemic still
be relatively new), and (3) the political interventions considered are binary and thus also
provide relatively little information. It is encouraging, however, that already such limited
data seems to contain causal signals pertaining to a highly nontrivial task. This suggests that
our approach may contribute towards meaningful causal analysis of political interventions
on the spread of Covid-19 as more data becomes available.
The causal analysis proposed in this paper aims at contributing to the broader effort of
scientists to understand the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic and the causal role of political
interventions such as social distancing. The causal method being applied and assayed in
this work can provide trustworthy causal results, since it is robust against false positives
in the presence of latent confounders in time series — note that in Covid-19 data science
problems, with our limited present understanding, it is likely that relevant covariates are
unobserved, leading to confounded problems. Despite the theoretical validity of the causal
method, caution should be exercised in the interpretation of the results of the present study,
due to the limited data available for this analysis (only daily reported Covid-19 cases for
different regions, and some political interventions), and the sheer difficulty of the task.
At present, we would thus not recommend that our empirical findings be used
to guide public policy. However, we find our results encouraging, given the hardness
of causal structure learning from observational real-world data, known to practitioners in
the field [1]. We therefore believe that methods such as the one used above, and further
developments based upon it, can contribute towards rational approaches for choosing and
balancing restriction measures for pandemics such as Covid-19.

Theory

7.2.1

Definitions

Definition (Causal Faithfulness). A distribution P is faithful to a directed acyclic graph
(DAG) G if no conditional independence relations other than the ones entailed by the Markov
property are present.

Definition (Causal Markov Condition [16]). Let G be a causal graph with vertex set V
and P be a probability distribution over the vertices in V generated by the causal structure
represented by G. G and P satisfy the Causal Markov Condition if and only if for every W
in V, W is independent of V \ (Descendants(W ) ∪ Parents(W )) given Parents(W ).
Here we use the global version of the Markov condition, which reads: if X ⊥⊥G Y | Z ⇒ X ⊥⊥
Y | Z for all disjoint vertex sets X , Y, Z (where ⊥⊥G denotes d-separation, as defined above)

7.2.2

Proof of Theorem A

Proof. The proof of Theorem 1 in [6] applies without changes. Regarding Theorem 2 in [6]:
Assume that the direct path Xti → Yt+wi exists and it is unconfounded. Then, condition 1 of
Theorem 2 in [6] is true. Now assume that condition 2 of Theorem 2 in [6] does not hold.
i
This would mean that the set {S i , Xti , Yt+wi −1 } does not d-separate Xt−1
and Yt+wi . (Recall
that a path p is said to be d-separated by a set of nodes in Z if and only if p contains a chain
or a fork such that the middle node is in Z, or if p contains a collider such that neither the
middle node nor any of its descendants are in the Z.) Hence, a violation of condition 2 would
imply that (a) there is some middle node or descendant of a collider in {S i , Xti , Yt+wi −1 }
and no non-collider node in this path belongs to this set, or (b) that there is a collider-free
i
path between Xt−1
and Yt+wi that does not contain any node in {S i , Xti , Yt+wi −1 }.

(a) There is some middle node or descendant of a collider in {S i , Xti , Yt+wi −1 } and
no non-collider node in this path belongs to this set: the proof given in [6] remains
unaffected if all DEGY 6∈ X, because any collider D or descendent of collider between
some Xtj and Yt+wi will be unobserved, therefore will not be possible to belong in
the conditioning set {S i , Xti , Yt+wi −1 }.
i
(b) There is a collider-free path between Xt−1
and Yt+wi that does not contain any node
in {S i , Xti , Yt+wi −1 }: the proof given in [6] remains unaffected.

Detailed findings from comparison of modified SyPI with Lasso-Granger
of the Covid-19 spread among the German federal states.

Table 1: Detected causes for each federal German state (Bundesland), using SyPI with
the loose combination of thresholds (0.05, 0.1) (2nd column) and using Lasso-Granger (3rd
column). As expected we see that the number of detected causes by Granger is multiple
times more than those of SyPI; in most cases Granger detects as causes all the candidate
states. Without knowing the ground truth, this is an obvious indication that the dataset
includes hidden confounders, that make the federal states look all related to each other. This
violation of causal sufficiency makes Granger to fail, as expected. On the other hand, SyPI
does not suffer from such problems even when there are latent confounders.

7.4

Detailed findings from the causal analysis of the Covid-19 spread among
the German district states.

Table 2: Detected causes for each district German state, using SyPI. In the first column,
the target district state is reported. In the second column, the detected causes among the
neighbouring districts are reported. Finally, in the third column, we report the detected
distant causes. Strict thresholds (the default of SyPI method) are used for the analysis.
As explained in Section 4.4 and in Figure 4a, the majority of detected district causes are
neighbours of the targets, and the majority of the distant detected causes are located close
to a big airport.

Figure 6: Detected causal districts for the spread of Covid-19, for each district, using the
modified SyPI algorithm. Solid arrows depict causes that are neighbour districts (i.e., sharing
a common border). Dashed arrows depict causes that are not. The majority of the detected
non-neighbour causes are close to big cities with large airports (MUC, STR, TXL, FDH,
FMM, NUE, HAM, FRA, HHN, HAJ, NRN, CGN, DUC, DMT, DRS, BRE, KSF, SCN),
and the majority of the detected causes are neighbours to the target. Note that since the
dashed arrows are significantly longer than the solid ones, the Figure at first glance seems
to show mostly dashed arrows. This is misleading; for a numeric comparison, see Figure 4a.
Blue cycles indicate 40km radius around the largest airports. For the district-level analysis,
the default thresholds of SyPI were used (0.01, 0.2)
