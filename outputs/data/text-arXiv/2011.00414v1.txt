Abstract A system to model the spread of COVID-19 cases after lockdown has been
proposed in this paper, It helps to define preventive measures based on predicted
hotspots, using the graph clustering algorithm. This method allows for more lenient
measures in areas less prone to the virus spread. There exist methods to model the
spread of the virus, by predicting the number of confirmed cases. But the proposed
system focuses more on the preventive side of the solution from a geographical point
of view. The fact that the virus can only be transmitted by being in close proximity to
an already infected person, suggests that, the regions that can easily be reached from
an existing hotspot, have a higher chance of becoming a new hotspot. Moreover,
in smaller regions, even after strict provisions, positive cases have been found. So,
the geodesic between the nearest hotspots can be used as a measure of likelihood
of the region also becoming a hotspot. In this paper, a weighted graph of regions,
with weight of the nodes as the number of active cases, and the distance as edge
weights is used. The graph is connected based on a distance threshold. The nodes
are the administrative level, and the distance measure tells the possible transmission
between separate communities. Using this data, the potential regions that can become
hotspots can be predicted, and preventive measures can be devised.
Key words: graph, covid, algorithm, transmission

1 Introduction
The 2020 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 [1] [2], popularly known as COVID19 has resulted in thousands of deaths and millions being infected. It was officially
first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China [3]. In mid March the World
Health Organization declared it a pandemic, changing it’s previous designation as an
outbreak. Over 25 million have been infected and more than 800,000 dead worldwide,
as of 6th September 2020 [4].
Similar to most flu viruses, it is spread via sneeze and cough droplets [5]. Touching
the face after touching a contaminated surface may also cause infection. Those
who are asymptomatic may also spread the disease, although chances of infection
spreading this way are low. The virus is most contagious starting a few days before
the initial symptoms, and then staying the same a week or two later [7] [6].
Cough, fever, tiredness, breathing issues, are a few common symptoms. Since
this virus primarily causes pneumonia and respiratory issues, those with existing
conditions are more at risk. This is evident by the fact that almost 80% deaths in
China were aged above 60 [8], most having pre-existing health complications like
diabetes and heart diseases. The ratio of number of death to number of cases is 3.3%,
as of 6th September 2020, according John Hopkins university.
Social Distancing has been one of the best preventive measure for COVID19, accompanied by wearing face masks, maintaining personal hygiene, regularly
sanitizing one’s surroundings, and self-isolating if flu like symptoms evolve [9].
Governments have imposed lockdowns, travel-restrictions and mandatory safety
measures to control the virus spread [10].
While the above measures prove to be very effective, they are not 100% foolproof.
Restrictions should be based on local situations, rather than be imposed at a country
level. It makes no sense to restrict movement in an area that has next to none cases
[11]. A balance is required to make sure the economy does not completely destabilise,
and people not end up in a position where they are so financially unstable that they
may starve to death. At the same time people need to protected from the infection too.
A developing country like India will end up suffering from both a dying economy,
and a dying workforce, if dynamic real time decisions are not taken [12].
Most research done regarding disease epidemiology is done on factors like total
case numbers, infection rates, and primarily focus on the SEIR (susceptible - exposed
- infected - recovered) model [13]. But COVID-19 is unique in the sense that after
imposing travel restrictions on air and rail, the only way transmission is possible via
roads. This means the virus does not have much spatial transmission range, once mass
travel restrictions and lockdowns are imposed. This makes spatial epidemiology an
ideal candidate for analyzing and predicting the spread of this type of disease.
A possible model for analyzing diseases like COVID-19, post-lockdown stage, is
visualizing administrative zones as graph nodes, and the roads connecting them as
the edges. This methodology will work regardless of the administrative level to be
analyzed, as long as the zone-wise infection data is available, and has been accurately
documented.

2 Related Work
Epidemiology is generally either observational or experimental. Experimental studies follow a controlled factor based approach, while observational studies go for an
entirely natural approach, with no interference [14]. Epidemiological studies should
reveal relations with underlying health conditions. For example, it is known that
cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and other conditions, severely affect a COVID-19
patient. This paper focuses on observational studies, specifically on spatial epidemiology [15].
A lot of work has been done on spatial epidemiology research. One of them being
the mapping of diseases, allowing for better understanding of disease spread, and
assisting the government in making well informed decisions on resource allocation
[16]. There also exist methodologies, based on the geographical demographics,
including factors like race, age, etc that may influence the spread of diseases. [17].
Disease clusters, infection groups, hotspots, are also a dynamic to be analyzed.
Although there are some issues to these approaches, provided the study has been
done properly, they can be beneficial, especially for epidemics and pandemics [18].
There has also been a lot of recent research specific to COVID-19. More prominent
studies are based in China, being the origin point of the virus. For example a study
[19], explores the spatial epidemic dynamics of COVID-19 using Moran’s I spatial
statistic. This study was based in Mainland China. It concluded that in fact, there is a
spatial correlation regarding spread of COVID-19. A study specific to the difference
is spatial transmission effects due to different public transport methods also exists,
again based in China [20]. Most studies are based on the SEIR model [21], although
SEIRS [22] should have been the way to go, due to WHO stating that reinfection could
be possible. Other recent work includes using machine learning, cloud computing
and IOT for modelling the COVID-19 trend [23], estimation of the reproduction
number of 2019-ncov [24], and clustering analysis of countries for COVID-19 [25].
Studies based on the Indian scenario are more in line with the work explained
in this paper. There have been a few studies with regards to spatial transmission,
incuding multi-city modelling [26], trend analysis using a geospatial approach [27],
and spatial prediction using ARIMA [28].

3 Goals and Objectives
The objective of this paper is to the study the spatial epidemiology of diseases like
COVID-19, and devise a methodology to do so. This methodology will help predict
future disease hotspots, and help in devising preventive measures as necessary. The
modelling and prediction will be done at district level in this paper, but the same
methodology can be applied on any administrative level. Following are a few goals
of this paper:

4

Varun Nagesh Jolly Behera, Ashish Ranjan and Motahar Reza

1. Country Independent: The methodology needs to be independent of the country.
As long as the assumptions are met, the algorithm should work automatically for
any and all countries.
2. Administrative Level Independent: It also should be independent of the administration level that needs to be analyzed. This includes state, county/district,
zone, zip codes, etc. As long as both location and infection data is available, the
algorithm should run flawlessly.
3. Automatic Graph Construction: Graph for that administrative level should
be generated automatically on the fly. This includes connecting nodes using
clustering, forming edges, and assigning weight to both the nodes and edges.
4. Division Inclusive/Exclusive: Impact of a location on itself may be included or
excluded, based on user preference. This will give slightly different result in each
case.
5. Real Time Updates: The system should update periodically, preferably daily, so
that better strategies can made for disease spread prevention and control. The
result can be visualized by creating a web app dashboard.

4 Requirements and Assumptions
The algorithm defined is this paper is robust, as long as few base assumptions are
met. The reliability of this method is based on a lot of requirements and assumptions
including:
1. Restricted Travel: This means that both air and rail travel are restricted. Also
long distance travel by road is strictly monitored, making it difficult for the disease
to have a large radius of influence.
2. Data Quality: The data needs to be well defined, and properly cleaned. If the
geographical names do not match with the Map API, then the longitude and
latitude information of those locations cannot be retrieved. This means it is
necessary to make sure there are no naming discrepancies, and the data should
be modified as required, so that it’s information aligns with that of the Map API
to be used. Not checking and refining the data will result in varied amounts of
information loss.
3. Data Granularity: This model can work on various administrative levels including at the district, state and country level. Modelling can be done for a specific
political map level only if the data is available for it. Meaning, if the model is to
be defined at district level, both the Map API and the disease spread data should
have granularity till the district level. If, either the co-ordinate data or the disease
spread data of districts are missing, this model cannot be applied at that level.
4. Data Accuracy: The data needs to be accurate. If data is old or incorrect, the
predictions made by the model will be drastically affected. Accuracy of the current
number of infected is most important. This means testing more, and using better
quality tests will help this model a lot.

5. Proper Map API: Map API that gives accurate co-ordinates of the geographical
locations at the required administrative level is necessary. Only then can the graph
be created with proper weight values and connections.

5 Methodology Overview
Following is a brief overview of the workflow described in this paper. It is visually
represented in Fig.1.
1. Choosing Administrative Level: The first step is choosing the administrative
level, at which infection spread has to be analyzed and predicted. Administrative
levels including, but not limited to, countries, states, counties, districts, zones,
wards, zipcodes, can be chosen for analysis. The only limitation in choosing the
administrative level, is the unavailability of data at that level. Otherwise, any and
all administrative levels can be chosen and analyzed.
2. Data Acquisition: The reliability of the algorithm is entirely based on the ’goodness’ of data. This includes aspects like availability, accuracy, comprehensiveness,
etc. If both, infection data and location data are available and reliable, only then
can the algorithm be used. The algorithm does not have the ability to fix inaccuracies and errors in the data. It is assumed that the data is accurate enough
to be used. There exist many infection data sources, depending on the disease
whose transmission has to be studied. For the purposes of finding location data,
a satisfactorily capable Map API is used.
3. Pre-processing: The data obtained from the previous step has to be cleaned
and restructured properly. This includes dropping unnecessary columns from the
infection data, and infection count that has not been assigned to any administrative
division. It is also necessary to make sure that the latitudes and longitudes are
properly mapped with their respective divisions.
4. Graph Construction: Based on the restructured data, individual divisions are
designated as separate graph nodes. This is done to create an abstract view of the
countries administrative divisions, and how they are connected. Using a clustering
method inspired from k-means, nearest nodes for every node are evaluated. All
pairs of nearest nodes are connected to form graph edges. A distance metric is
used to define the clustering factor. Only divisions within a certain range will
be connected to each other. This distance metric has to be changed based on
the administrative level chosen, to factor in the difference in distances between
division centres.
5. Finding Danger Level: Three different measures have been defined in this paper,
to evaluate the probability of a district becoming a hotspot, termed as ’danger
level’. These measures evaluate this danger level, using different parameters,
giving different levels of importance to each parameter.
6. Predicting Potential Hotspots: The danger level value obtained can be easily
color coded. The color green shall represent a division having low risk of becoming a hotspot anytime soon. Orange signifies that the division is near a few

6

existing hotspots, and if precautions are not taken, may become one itself. Red
marks regions that either already have, or will very soon become major hotspots,
unless strict measures are not taken.

6 Data Acquisition
This model requires primarily two types of datasets. First is information regarding the
current number of infections at the desired administrative level. This paper explores
the models robustness at district level, but as mentioned before, this model can be
used at any administrative level. Second is the information regarding the co-ordinates
of various locations at same administrative level. This information can be extracted
efficiently using a Map API.

6.1 Infection Data
This is the data of the total number of active infections, at the required administration level. Varied number of sources exist, depending on the disease that needs to be
studied. Some prominent datasets include the Malaria Atlas Project [29], and Scientific Data for Dengue [30], Leishmania [31] and Ebola [32]. This paper explores
the impact of COVID-19 in the Indian scenario. Some datasets currently available
for it are nCoV-2019 [33], CORD-19 [35], Lancet Dashboard [34] and Coronavirus
Twitter Dataset [36]. Since this paper explores the Indian scenario at district level,
the dataset chosen is from covid19india.org [37], a crowd-sourced dataset, as seen
in Fig.2. This dataset is highly accurate and is updated daily, sourced both from official government sources and media. There also exists an official Indian Government
Dataset that may be used for state level analysis.

6.2 Location Data
This is the data of the administrative division location at the required administrative
level. This data can be obtained using a Map API, in the form of latitudes and
longitudes. The Map API will take the location string as input and give co-ordinates
as output, as shown in Algo. 1 and Fig.3. For the case of districts, the upper level
will be state. The most popular Map APIs are the Bing Maps API and the Google
Maps Geocoding API.

end
end

6.2.1 Bing Maps API
There are two ways to find longitudes and latitudes using the Bing Maps API.
First is using the ’Find location by address method’. In this method we use
a specific URL template to obtain longitudes and latitudes. This is done by filling
various parameters in the template URL, like locality, postal code, and street address.
To use the API a Bing Maps key is required. Requesting a location using the URL
template returns a response containing location data like latitudes and longitudes,
location type, and the geographical area that contains the location. The API may
be accessed using both HTTP and HTTPS protocols. Information for a location can
be obtained by setting either one or more parameters. The output can be obtained
either as an XML or JSON response. Both responses will give central latitude and
longitude, as well as latitudes and longitudes of the bounding box for that location.
The second is using the ’Find a location by query’ method. This method gives
longitudes and latitudes, based on a given query. This method is more akin to
generally how Map Applications are interacted with generally. The query can be sent
as a structured URL or as an unstructured query string. User Context Parameters may
be used for better accuracy. The output is similar to the previous method, although
more than one output may be received due to ambiguity. It also likewise supports
both HTTP and HTTPS.

6.2.2 Google Geocoding
A part of the Google Maps Platform, subset to the Google Cloud Platform, this
API is similar to the second Bing Maps API method. This API service can be
directly accessed using an HTTP request. An API key has to be obtained from the
Google Cloud Platform to use the Geocoding API. Google’s API also gives output
in JSON or XML as needed. Input can be either a string, containing the address, or
as components with their corresponding values. The output will include both, the
central latitude and longitude and the bounding box latitudes and longitudes. The

10

benefit of using Google Geocoding is the support for upto 5 administrative levels
within a country. Districts are at the administrative area level 2 as per the API.

Graph Clustering for Transmission Prediction of COVID-19

11

7 Pre-processing
The model requires administrative division location with its corresponding active
number of cases. Before this can be done, co-ordinates i.e. latitudes and longitudes
for every division has to be found. The infection data too needs to be cleaned.
This includes dropping unnecessary columns and removing rows with undefined
divisions. After that both datasets need to be mapped to give the required restructured
data. Since this paper focuses on the district level, mapping will be done at that level,
as shown in Fig.4.

7.1 Co-ordinate Mapping
This paper explores using the Google Geocoding API for finding latitudes and longitudes of administrative divisions at the required level. The ’googlemaps’ package
is used, accompanied with the Geocoding API client key. For every district-state
pair in the infection data, a query is formed as ’District, State’. For each such query,
a corresponding latitude-longitude pair is obtained. All of these obtained locationcoordinate pairs are properly stored.

7.2 Data Cleaning
The data obtained from covid19india.org contains a lot of information, most of
which is not required for the study done in this paper. This includes attributes like
State Code, Confirmed cases, Recovered cases, etc. The attributes required are State,
District, Active cases, and Change in Active cases. Change in Active cases is the
increase in the number of active cases from the previous day. This is because a
district with higher number of currently active cases will have a more severe impact
on its neighbouring districts. The use of each of these parameters are mentioned later
in this paper.

7.3 Restructuring Data
After data has been cleaned, the geolocation data obtained from the Map API is
merged with this cleaned data. The final data will contain District, State, Active
Cases, Change in Active Cases, Latitude and Longitude values for every District.

8 Graph Construction
The next step is to construct the graph using the newly restructured data. Each of
the divisions/districts shall be considered as a vertex, and few of its connections
will be edges. The main aim of creating a graph is to form a high-level view of a
country’s transport system, or specifically, it’s road connections. So, the vertices are
the districts, and the edges are the shortest paths between neighbouring districts,
as shown in Fig.5 and Algo.2. Cases are the vertex weights, shortest distances are
the edge weights, and the dotted line represents the threshold boundary. This entire
process is accomplished using ’networkx’ package.

Fig. 5: Sample Graph

14

8.1 Vertices
For constructing the graph, the district locations are considered as the vertices.
The weight for each vertex is the corresponding number of active cases. If any
other administrative level is to be considered, the respective division locations are
considered as vertices. Accordingly the vertex weight for each division will be
number of active cases for that division.

8.2 Edges
Edges for the graph are the connections between only some specific pairs of vertices.
This is because, districts nearby each other are easier to travel to and from, due to air
and rail travel restrictions. Also, even if all pairs are considered, the impact from a
district very far away, even with high number of cases, will be negligible. It will only
result cause more computational complexity. These pairs can be obtained by using
some clustering methodology. After that, the weight for an edge can be defined by
the distance between its two vertices.

8.2.1 Clustering
The simplest and most logical approach to find appropriate pairs is to take inspiration
from something like k-means of fuzzy c-means clustering [38]. Basically, for every
vertex in the graph, if another vertex is within some threshold range of that vertex,
then they are connected. Each vertex is its own cluster centre, and cluster centres are
not updated. Nearest vertices are identified in a single pass, and a vertex can be in
multiple clusters. Every administrative division becomes its own cluster centre.

8.2.2 Threshold Value
Two vertices should only be connected based on the above mentioned threshold
value. The threshold value is actually the maximum shortest distance between two
districts, so that they may be considered as neighbours. This threshold distance needs
to be appropriate and has to be set manually. A reasonably large value is chosen for
threshold, for a balanced number of connections between districts.

8.3 Visualization
Once the edges are defined, and both nodes and edges have their weights assigned,
the graph construction is complete. Now, it can be visualized in the graph, that the

G.addEdge(i, j, distance(i, j))
end
end
end
end

nodes are the administrative division centres, and the edges are the shortest paths
between nearby divisions.

9 Impact Measures and Danger Level
To find the danger level of each individual division, three measures have been defined.
Each measure takes into account different factors, so results may be slightly different.
These measures give a danger value, that may be color coded for better visualization.

9.1 Nearest without Self
In this measure, the impact of all other cluster members, except for the cluster centre
itself, on the cluster centre, is taken into consideration. This danger level is defined
as
Í𝑁
𝑗 𝑖𝑚 𝑝𝑎𝑐𝑡 (𝑖, 𝑗)
𝐷 𝑁 𝑊 𝑂𝑆 (𝑖) =
(1)
𝑁
here 𝑖 identifies the division whose danger level needs to be evaluated, 𝑗 is any
division adjacent to division 𝑖 i.e. 𝑖 𝑗 ∈ 𝐸, and 𝑁 is the number of such pairs, where
𝑖𝑚 𝑝𝑎𝑐𝑡 (𝑖, 𝑗) =

𝑉𝑠𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑒𝑑 ( 𝑗)
𝐸 𝑠𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑒𝑑 (𝑖, 𝑗)

(2)

16

Varun Nagesh Jolly Behera, Ashish Ranjan and Motahar Reza

Fig. 6: Constructed Graph

is the impact factor of 𝑗 division on 𝑖, and the scaled vertex weights and edge
weights are
𝑉𝑠𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑒𝑑 ( 𝑗) = 𝑉 ( 𝑗)/𝑚𝑎𝑥(𝑉)

(3)

𝐸 𝑠𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑒𝑑 ( 𝑗) = 𝐸 ( 𝑗)/𝑚𝑎𝑥(𝐸)

(4)

9.2 Nearest with Self
In this measure, the impact of all cluster members, including the cluster centre on
itself, is taken into consideration. This danger level is defined as

Graph Clustering for Transmission Prediction of COVID-19

Í𝑁
𝐷 𝑁 𝑊 𝑆 (𝑖) =

𝑗

17

𝑖𝑚 𝑝𝑎𝑐𝑡 (𝑖, 𝑗) + 𝑖𝑚 𝑝𝑎𝑐𝑡 𝑠𝑒𝑙 𝑓 (𝑖)

(5)
𝑁 +1
here 𝑖 identifies the division whose danger level needs to be evaluated, 𝑗 is any
division adjacent to division 𝑖 i.e. 𝑖 𝑗 ∈ 𝐸, and 𝑁 is the number of such pairs, where
𝑖𝑚 𝑝𝑎𝑐𝑡 (𝑖, 𝑗) is the same as Eq.2, and
𝑖𝑚 𝑝𝑎𝑐𝑡 𝑠𝑒𝑙 𝑓 (𝑖) = 𝑉𝑠𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑒𝑑 (𝑖) × (1 + 4𝑉 (𝑖)/𝑉 (𝑖))

(6)

is the impact factor of division 𝑖 on itself, and the scaled vertex weights and edge
weights are same as Eq.3 and 4. If 𝑉 (𝑖) is zero, then self impact will also be zero.

9.3 Inverse-square Law
In this measure, the impact of all cluster members, including the cluster centre on
itself, is taken into consideration. It is similar to Coulomb’s Law and Newton’s
Gravitational Law. This danger level is defined as
Í𝑁
𝑗 𝑖𝑚 𝑝𝑎𝑐𝑡 (𝑖, 𝑗)
(7)
𝐷 𝐼 𝑆𝐿 (𝑖) =
𝑁
here 𝑖 identifies the division whose danger level needs to be evaluated, 𝑗 is any
division adjacent to division 𝑖 i.e. 𝑖 𝑗 ∈ 𝐸, and 𝑁 is the number of such pairs, where
𝑖𝑚 𝑝𝑎𝑐𝑡 𝐼 𝑆𝐿 (𝑖, 𝑗) =

𝑉𝑠𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑒𝑑 (𝑖) × 𝑉𝑠𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑒𝑑 ( 𝑗)
2
𝐸 𝑠𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑒𝑑
(𝑖, 𝑗)

(8)

is the impact factor of 𝑗 division on 𝑖, and the scaled vertex weights and edge
weights are same as Eq.3 and 4.

10 Predicting Potential Hotspots
Using any of the three measures, the danger level value can be easily color coded.
This will allow for ease in visualisation, as the various colors will represent different
danger levels, in a gradient manner. Three colours are used, namely green, orange
and red. Here red represents the division that is most severely affected, or about
to be severely affected, very soon. This division is either already a hotspot, or will
become one in a few days. Orange represents divisions that either are moderately
affected, or will soon be, if correct precautions are not taken. This is the best stage
to impose restrictions, so as to make sure it does not become a red zone i.e. a future
disease hotspot. An orange zone may also signify that some of the nearby divisions
may already red zones, solidifying the need for major precautions. Finally, green
represents a comparatively safe zone, where, as long as there are restrictions on

18

Varun Nagesh Jolly Behera, Ashish Ranjan and Motahar Reza

travelling in and out of that zone, lenient rules may be applied, making sure that
people’s lives and their livelihood both are not affected.
Since a few highly infected areas may be deemed outliers, a normal distribution
is instead used, considering only the second and third quartile. After this, according
to danger values, colours are assigned, with the lower danger values getting assigned
green, and higher ones as red. The color gradient then helps in easily understanding
the spatial situation and dynamically choosing the rules based on the zone.

11 Experimental Results
Data acquisition, pre-processing, graph construction, and the algorithm implementation, were all done in Python 3, using the Google Collaboratory platform. Experimental evaluation was done using an Intel Xeon 2vCPU @ 2.3GHz and more than
12 GB of RAM. Infection data was acquired from covid19india.org, while Location
Data was obtained using the Google Maps Geocoding API.
With a threshold distance value of 1.3 degrees, a graph was generated (Visualized
in Figures.7-10). This value was found to be large enough to connect all appropriate
nodes while being computationally efficient.
To take care of very huge number of active cases that act as outliers, it was
assumed that every node with a danger value of 0.3 and above be equal. The danger
value was scaled to a value between 0 and 1. These values were mapped to a colour
gradient map and the final map visualization of the country was generated. All three
measures were used and compared.
The entire system has been converted to a real time web-app where the computation is scheduled daily and the final visualized map is shown on a dashboard. It is
available at https://research.jamlab.in/covid .

12 Conclusion
A system was proposed to model the spread of COVID-19 cases after lockdown,
to define new preventive measures based on hotspots, using the graph clustering
algorithm. The system works on any administrative level given that data is available
at that level. A graph was constructed to model the virus’ spread and danger values
were calculated to assign the danger level of each district. This was visualised using
a color map.
Although this system was tested on the COVID-19 India data, it should work on
dataset for any disease, provided all assumptions that are mentioned are met. There
is a lot of scope for this methodology, which will be explored in future work .

13 Future Work
A lot of improvements can be made to this methodology. This includes addition of a
time dimension, so as prediction can be made for a defined period of time. A pseudo
geospatial time series analysis may be possibly used for this. Also instead of using
a rough geodesic graph, an exact graph based n the actual road network can also be
explored.
