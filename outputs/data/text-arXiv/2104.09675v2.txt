Abstract
We studied the COVID-19 pandemic evolution in selected African countries.
For each country considered, we modeled simultaneously the data of the active,
recovered and death cases. In this study, we used a year of data since the
first cases were reported. We estimated the time-dependent basic reproduction
numbers, R0 , and the fractions of infected but unaffected populations, to offer
insights into containment and vaccine strategies in African countries. We found
that R0 ‚â§ 4 at the start of the pandemic but has since fallen to R0 ‚àº 1. The
unaffected fractions of the populations studied vary between 1 ‚àí 10% of the

1. Introduction
SARS-CoV-2 is the virus responsible for COVID-19, a coronavirus disease that
has caused a worldwide pandemic [1]. Infected persons may show symptoms of
respiratory illnesses and most people recover without serious medical interventions. However, complications and risk of death may occur in older folks and
those with pre-existing medical conditions [2]. SARS-CoV-2 spreads through
oral or nasal discharges from infected persons. Worldwide, upwards of a hundred
million confirmed cases and over two million deaths have been registered [3]. To
reduce transmissions, hygienic measures, social distancing and quarantines have
been adopted and travel restrictions imposed, with severe impacts on the world
economies [2]. Africa has had over three million and a half cases of COVID-19
with about ninety thousand deaths‚Äîwith close to fifty percent of the cases in
South Africa [4].
In the current uncertain situation, we have carried out a mathematical modeling of COVID-19 data from Africa countries to estimate their time-dependent
basic reproduction numbers. The current study is based on COVID-19 data of
nine African countries, namely Cameroon, Ghana, Kenya, Madagascar, Mozambique, Rwanda, South Africa, Togo, and Zambia. The data used cover periods
of twelve months from the first cases of COVID-19 in the countries considered.
The study presented here is an extension of an earlier one done on the first few
months of the COVID-19 pandemic [5].
We used the SIDARTHE model [6] to study the evolution of the COVID-19
pandemic in the aforementioned countries and estimated their time-dependent
R0 ‚Äîan epidemiological parameter often used to gauge the evolution of a pandemic. Estimation of R0 considers various biological, socio-economic, environmental and behavioral factors [6]; however, it is model dependent. The R0 may

2

be used to estimate the fraction of a population to vaccinate. A number of vaccines have been developed, offering hope to bring the pandemic under control.
However, emergence of new strains‚Äîbecause of mutations of the virus‚Äîmight
reduce effectiveness of the vaccines [7].
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we discuss the SIDARTHE
model and briefly review the basic reproduction number in Section 3. In Section 4, we present the analysis and results. In Section 5, we discuss the implications of the results, and we offer concluding remarks in Section 6.

2. SIDARTHE Model Formulation
The SIDARTHE model considers eight stages of pandemic evolution, namely
S, susceptible (uninfected); I, infected (asymptomatic or pauci-symptomatic
infected, undetected); D, diagnosed (asymptomatic infected, detected); A, ailing (symptomatic infected, undetected); R, recognized (symptomatic infected,
detected); T , threatened (infected with life-threatening symptoms, detected);
H, healed (recovered) and E, extinct (dead) [6]. For detailed derivation of the
SIDARTHE model, refer to Ref. [6]. Graphical representations of the stages of
pandemic evolution in the SIDARTHE model are shown in Refs [5, 6]; the model
proposes the following system of ordinary differential equations to describe the

3

time evolution of a pandemic [6].

In Equation 1, the expression for the healed population, HÃá(t), contains the
term ŒªI(t): this is the fraction of the population that recovered from the infected category, I(t), without symptoms nor diagnosis‚Äîwe denote this term,
ŒªI(t), the ‚Äùunaffected population‚Äù. The modeling of the recovered population
contains the unaffected population; however, as discussed later in Sections 4
and 5, the collected data do not account for the unaffected categories. This is
an important feature of the model. A large value of the ‚Äùunaffected population‚Äù
will demonstrate the lack of testing.
3. Basic Reproduction number
The basic reproduction number plays an important role in mathematical epidemiology; it is the average number of secondary cases produced by an infected
individual in a population where everyone is susceptible [8]. In the SIDARTHE
model, R0 can be derived as:
R0 =

Œ≤
Œ¥ŒΩ
Œ¥Œ∂Œ∏
Œ±
+
+
+
r2
r1 r2
r1 r2 r4
r1 r3 r4
4

(2)

where r1 =  + Œ∂ + Œª, r2 = Œ∑ + œÅ, r3 = Œ∏ + ¬µ + Œ∫, r4 = ŒΩ + Œæ. Ref. [6] shows
details on the R0 derivation. As shown in Equation 1, R0 depends on the model
parameters that affect pandemic evolution. The aim of this analysis was to
estimate R0 with model parameters that describe the real data. Therefore, it
is important to understand the model parameters and to make sure they are
extracted correctly.

4. Analysis of COVID-19 Data
In this section, we discuss the analysis strategy. For each country, we modeled
the three datasets of active, recovered and death cases by finding the SIDARTHE
model parameters that best match the time-evolution of the data. Then, the
basic reproduction number is computed with the best-matched parameters using Equation 2. Depending on the evolution of the pandemic and the response
measures applied, the best-matched parameters may change over time, thus
providing an evolution of the basic reproduction number as a function of time.
We propagated to the R0 estimates of the statistical uncertainties related to the
numbers of tests done and cases identified. We also applied a systematic uncertainty to the R0 estimates based on the fraction of the infected but unaffected
population; this fraction is predicted by the model; however, it not accounted
for in the data. In the following subsections, we discuss the data analysis and
results for each country studied.
4.1. Analysis of COVID-19 data of South Africa
The National Institute for Communicable Diseases confirmed the first COVID19 case on March 5, 2020, which arose due to a returning traveler from Italy [9].
By March 13, 2021, South Africa had a total of 1528414 COVID-19 cases, making it the African country with the highest number of COVID-19 infections [10].
Over the course of the first wave, the South African government implemented
five different levels of respective lockdown regulations with alert level one being
the most relaxed and alert level five the strictest [11]. Table 1 shows a summary
of the lockdown levels with their periods of implementation.

control measures such as social distancing, mask wearing and hand sanitizing.
Until March 29, 2020, in terms of the SIDARTHE model, the unaffected and
recovered fraction of population were comparable as seen in Figure 1, bottom
right. There is a correlation between the basic reproduction number and the
implementation of the various lockdown levels.
Around the start of lockdown level 1, from September 15 to about beginning of October, R0 > 1. From the end of October to beginning of November,

the beginning of December 1. On December 3, the region of Nelson Mandela
Bay was put under stricter lockdown rules, including a ban in alcohol sales and
tighter restrictions on gatherings‚Äîsuch as funerals and prohibition of the reopening of schools. Nonetheless, the spread of the virus increased sharply. This
second wave was accompanied by the emergence of the new variant, 501Y.V2,
in South Africa [13].
On December 29, the whole country went back to an ‚Äùadjusted‚Äù alert level 3.
The number of daily confirmed cases kept rising until January 11, 2021‚Äîaround
when the second wave peaked. Thereafter, the number of cases started to decrease and R0 ‚àº 1.
4.2. Analysis of COVID-19 data of Ghana
The first two imported cases of COVID-19 in Ghana were announced on March
12, 2020. Four days later, a total of six cases were identified. Contact tracing led to 143 suspected cases on March 17 and triggered the deployment of
preventive measures [14, 15]. With immediate effect, the government enacted
a ban on public gatherings and discouraged airlines to accept travelers from
countries with more than 200 cases. The government ordered a series of market
disinfection exercises. The first phase was carried out in March while the second and third phases were performed in July and November 2020 respectively.
From March 23, the Ghanaian authorities closed borders with the neighboring
countries. Furthermore, some local cities were subjected to a partial lockdown
until April 19. Local organizations, companies, businesses, and generous citizens
supported the containment measures with gifts of locally-designed reusable or
medical face masks, veronica buckets, hand sanitizers, and other hygienic items.
On May 1, 2020‚Äîfifty days since the start of the outbreak in Ghana‚Äîthere
were 2074 confirmed cases, with 200 recoveries and 17 deaths. The top-left plot
of Figure 2 shows the modeling of the Ghanaian data; in the bottom-left plot
of Figure 2, we see an increase in R0 from 0.91 to 1.28 on day 50, followed by
a fall on May 14. This reduction in the cases resulted from measures imposed

in March and April, 2020. By May, more than 80% of Ghanaian regions reported their first cases although the total confirmed cases was less than 0.02%
of the population and the country had seen two waves of the pandemic. Meanwhile, the restrictions on bars and restaurants were lifted and this resulted in
an increase in R0 to 1.12 at the end of May. By June 9, all the 16 regions
had registered their first cases. Since the beginning of the epidemic, the Ghana
Health Service has implemented a discharging protocol that declared recovered
a suspected COVID-19 patient who tested negative two consecutive times. However, from June 18, there was a change in policy: asymptomatic infected, and

9

symptomatic infected persons whose symptoms were mitigated by treatment,
were discharged. The new protocol was adopted to relieve the health system
and comply with new directives from the WHO. This led to a rapid increase
in the recovered cases, from 4548 to 10074 as shown in Figure 2, top-left plot.
The sudden increase in the number of recovered cases was not a reflection of the
pandemic evolution; therefore, we modeled two datasets. In the first model, we
considered the data from March to June 17; in the second modeling, the data
from June 18 was used. By the end of July, 2020, the total cases increased from
19388 to 37812. It was the first time the monthly increase fell below a 100% in
Ghana. R0 fluctuated around one from June to the beginning of October, suggesting that the situation in Ghana was stabilizing steadily. However, a surge
in new cases during the second half of October increased the R0 from 1.03 to
1.46‚Äîthis increase could be related to the re-opening of air borders and schools;
in November, R0 fell again to 0.31. Two subsequent waves occurred towards the
ends of November and December and R0 increased from 0.31 to 1.81 and 0.71
to 1.56 respectively. By February 12, 2021, the total number of cases was 77046
with 7778 active cases, 68713 recovered cases and 555 deaths. The top-right plot
of Figure 2 shows the validation of the modeling of the COVID-19 of Ghana in
a ratio of data to model expectations as function of time. We also estimated
the fraction of the population that was infected but unaffected; this is shown in
bottom-right plot of Figure 2.
4.3. Analysis of COVID-19 data of Kenya
The first case was reported on March 12, 2020. It was a young lady who had
traveled back to the country from the US via London. The second case was a
friend of Patient Zero and the third case was one of the passengers sitting next
to Patient Zero on the flight from London to Nairobi. Two weeks after the first
case was reported, a cessation of movement from the country‚Äôs two largest cities,
Nairobi and Mombasa, was introduced to curb the spread of the virus from the
two cities which were slowly emerging as hot spots. Other measures taken by
the Kenyan government were: 1) the country went into a partial lockdown; 2)
10

both international and local flights were suspended; 3) schools were closed; 4)
night curfews were introduced and are still in place; 5) social distancing was
required in restaurants and other social places; 6) social gatherings were limited
to a maximum of 50 people; and lastly, 7) people were encouraged to work from
home where possible between the months of April-August 2020 [16]. As shown in

Figure 3: COVID-19 data and model of Kenya. Active, recovered, death and total cases are
shown in the top-left plot. Day 0 is March 12, 2020. The error bars show the statistical
errors between the Model and the Kenya C0VID-19 data. The bottom-left plot shows the
time-dependent basic reproduction number and the error band includes systematic uncertainty
from the infected but unaffected population not included in the data. The top-right plot shows
the goodness-of-fit which is given by the ratio of the data over the model. The uncertainty
ban contains the statistical uncertainty in the data and the systematic uncertainty on the
modeling. The model prediction of the recovered population is shown in the bottom-right
plot; also shown, is the undiagnosed fraction of the people that were infected and recovered
without symptoms. This fraction, called the unaffected cases, is not measured or included in
the data.

11

the top-left plots of Figure 3, numbers of cases rose steeply in the first month of
the pandemic and slowed down for the next three months as the infection rates
fell. The flattening of the curve was achieved around the month of July. Five
months after the first case was reported, the total recovered cases surpassed the
total active cases as the number of infections continued to fall. The fatality rate
was at ‚àº1.5%. The top-right plot of Figure 3 shows how well the Kenyan data
is modeled. An estimate of the unaffected fraction of the Kenyan population is
shown in bottom-right plot of Figure 3.
At the beginning, R0 = 2.4 as the pandemic was growing from the first imported cases, and the government had not yet introduced any control measures.
However, R0 drastically fell after the second week as shown in the bottom-left
plot of Figure 3. A month after the first case was reported, R0 ‚â§ 1 and remained
below one indicating that the number of new infections was decreasing. This
can be attributed to the closure of entry points, i.e. suspension of international
flights, which eliminated imported cases. The gradual decline in the R0 implied
that the control measures introduced were effective in curbing the spread of the
virus in those earlier days. However, as shown in Figure 3, bottom-left plot,
R0 periodically rose and fell due to a number of reasons such as the increased
testing capacity and relapses in adherence to the control measures.
Since January 2021, normalcy has resumed; however, people are encouraged
to wear masks in public places and observe social distancing. Schools have
reopened and international and domestic flights resumed.
4.4. Analysis of COVID-19 data of Madagascar
On March 13, 2020, 117 days after the first case of COVID-19 appeared in
Wuhan, China, Madagascar identified its first three confirmed cases in the capital city of Antananarivo. From that date until February 23, 2021, 119608 tests
have been conducted resulting in 19831 confirmed cases. At the time of writing,
two hundred and thirty eight cases were still active and under treatment, while
19296 recovered with a death toll of 297 [17, 18]. The modeling of the Malagasy
COVID-19 and the R0 are shown in the right plots of Figure 4, the validation

the crisis in four major steps. First, since the economy of Madagascar relies
heavily on tourism industries, the government decided not to close the borders.
Approximately three weeks after the first cases, confirmed positive cases rose
to fifty seven. The second step was initiated because of the increase in cases
and a better understanding of the disease based on WHO recommendations; the
government initiated a lockdown of the country by suspending all international
flights for thirty days during the month of April 2020. The majority of the
13

cases were identified in the two major cities of the country [19]. At fifteen-day
increments, local lockdowns were enforced within these two cities and all regional flights were suspended as well. Masks were required and enforced heavily
by local forces. Drastic sanctions against non-mask wearers were put in place.
At the same time, a newly developed herbal tea called Covidorganics was distributed for free. These measures mitigated the transmission of the disease; by
the end of the second fifteen-day incremental lockdown, the number of cases
was 132, with only 36 active cases under treatment. Madagascar started free
testing and put in place several new sites to conduct data collection of infected
peoples. Meanwhile, the fragile economy started to crumble under the heavy
lockdown measures; therefore, sanctions were loosened and population mobility resumed; as a result, the number COVID-19 cases increased. By the end
of May 2020, 771 cases were confirmed, with the first recorded death. In the
following months, six additional deaths, caused by COVID-19, occurred. The
third step was a full lockdown of the country, which was difficult to enforce
since local economy in micro and small enterprises is at the core of the Malagasy culture [20]. The confirmed cases then rose to 10890 by the end of July
2020 with 106 deaths. The government provided a stimulus package and social
programs to support the population, but at the cost of large gatherings to receive the government assistance. The number of cases were also affected by a
large repatriation of Malagasy nationals from Europe. When the fourth step
started in August 2020, the number of new cases kept decreasing from 1522 in
September to 380 in December 2020 [17, 18]. All international flights were still
suspended, local lockdowns were lifted and case reporting changed from daily
to weekly. At the time of writing, the authorities were evaluating the evolution
of COVID-19 abroad, and if the situation continued to improve, international
flights might resume.
4.5. Analysis of COVID-19 data of Cameroon
The first case of COVID-19 in Cameroon was announced on March 6, 2020 and
the government implemented containment measures described in Ref. [21]. The

left plots of Figure 5 show the modeling of the COVID-19 data of Cameroon and
the estimate of the basic reproduction number. In top-right plot of Figure 5,
we show how well the data is modeled. The fraction of the population that is
infected but unaffected by COVID-19 is shown in the bottom-right plot of Figure 5. The government advised the public not to panic, but to show discipline,

solidarity and a sense of responsibility. These measures helped reduce the rate
15

of pandemic evolution until the government eased the measures on October 15,
2020. From then, there was a sharp rise in the number of new COVID-19 cases
as shown in Figure 5.
The government increased awareness campaign at the community level, through
the media and social networks [22]. Following the 2020 African Nations Championship soccer tournament, hosted in Cameroon, there was a resurgence of
COVID-19 cases and hospitalization rates increased from 0.5% to 5% [23].
4.6. Analysis of COVID-19 data of Mozambique
References [24, 25, 5] describe the first few months of the COVID-19 evolution
in Mozambique since the first case was identified on March 22, 2020. On May
12, they suspended international flights until May 30, except for humanitarian,
cargo or state flights. However, universities and schools reopened with social
distancing, hand washing and mask wearing required. Masks were mandatory
in public spaces and private businesses, and enforced in public transportation
and hospitals; bars and museums remained closed. We show in the top-left plot
of Figure SM1 the modeling of the COVID-19 data of Mozambique. In the
top-right plot of Figure SM1, we compare the modeling results to the data, and
an estimate of the unaffected population is presented in the bottom-right plot.
The council of ministers approved a decree, ‚ÄúSituation of Public Disaster
and Activated Red Alert‚Äù, which came into effect on September 7 [26]; noncompliance was punishable with fines up to five minimum wages. Among the
measures imposed in the decree, prevention and containment measures stood
out: usage of masks, frequent hand washing, social distancing, usage cough
etiquette and no sharing personal utensils. Passenger transport flights to certain
countries resumed, on a reciprocal basis. On October 1, 2020, schools resumed
for the twelfth grade education, with contingency plans. For public services and
religious celebrations, the number of participants had to be ‚â§ 50% the venue
capacity, with a cap at a hundred and fifty people. There were also restrictions
on public transports [27].
There were many violations of the containment measures during the festive
16

season, in December 2020, because of parties, gatherings and concerts with
greater than capacity, where social distancing was not observed; this led to an
increase in the confirmed cases as shown in Figure SM1, top plot. In response,
the government implemented a new decree in January 2021, namely COVID-19
screening test before entering or leaving the country; stay at home order for
people with symptoms of fever and flu; restriction in the opening hours of all
commercial activities, to 6pm; closing of all booths selling alcoholic beverages;
suspension cultural activities. These measures entered into force on January 15
for 21 days [28]. However, the number of cases continued to grow, and by the
end of January 2021, the number of active cases doubled‚Äîuntil December 31,
2020 they had a total of 18642 confirmed cases and on January 31, 2021, it was
38654. Additional and more restrictive measures were imposed in early February
2021: no religious ceremonies or public services; interdiction of social and private
gatherings, except weddings with no more than twenty people; prohibition of
sales of alcoholic beverages; closure of schools; limitation to one person-visit per
month to penitentiary establishments [29].
We see good agreement between the modeling and the data for the dead,
recovered and active cases of the population, as shown in Figures SM1. As a
result, the total cases are also well modeled. The estimated R0 remains below
two for the entire period shown in bottom-left plot of Figure SM1. The R0 for
Mozambique fluctuated over time: between days 29 to 39, 54 to 62, 145 to 154,
162 to 166, it dropped significantly. In days 3 to 29, 75 to 112, 116 to 135 it
stays slightly above one.
4.7. Analysis of COVID-19 data of Rwanda
We described the first few months of the COVID-19 pandemic‚Äîsince the first
case was detected on March 14, 2020‚Äîin Ref. [5]. Testing of symptomatic
cases started right away before the first case was identified, especially those
coming from outside [30]. Contact tracing and testing of asymptomatic cases
started after April 7; the Rwandan government used contact tracing by testing
all individuals ‚Äîwhether they show symptoms or not‚Äîwho came in contact
17

with an infected person [30].
The data and model results are shown in the top-left plot of Figure SM2;
the estimated R0 is shown in the bottom-left plot. In the top-right plot, we
present the validation of the modeling; the fraction of the Rwandan population
unaffected by COVID-19 is shown in the bottom-right plot of Figure SM2. On
January 18, 2021, Rwanda imposed a further lockdown in the city of Kigali
because of a resurgence of COVID-19 cases with increased transmission and
death rates. The government informed the public that all movements outside
residential homes required authorization except for essential services. Movements between districts/provinces were prohibited except for tourism and essential services; however, tourists were required to show a negative COVID-19
test certificate. Public transport was also prohibited and all employees worked
from home, except those who provided essential services. Places of worship and
learning institutions remained closed until further notice; night curfew started
at 18:00 until 4:00 local time [30].
4.8. Analysis of COVID-19 data of Togo
In Ref. [5], we summarized the first three months of the pandemic; the first case
was confirmed on March 6, 2020 [31, 32]. From mid-June until October, examination classes resumed for students. Also, on August 1, 2020, international
flights restarted. From mid-September, most cases were detected in travelers [32].
The modeling, validation and the unaffected fraction of the Togolese population are shown in Figure SM3. In November 2020, both primary and high
schools resumed with all the measures‚Äîsuch as hand washing and wearing of
masks‚Äîin effect. At the time of writing, only a few infections were detected in
pupils [31]. During the 2020 end of the year holiday season, curfew was imposed
from 10:00pm to 6:00am. Despite the curfew and all the preventive measures,
the number of cases increased substantially in the northern region of the country
from January 15, 2021, as shown in Figure SM3, top-left plot. This was because
of violations of the preventive and social distancing measures [33, 32]. As a
18

result, from January 17, 2020, the government implemented a new lockdown in
the regions with increased infection rates, for a period of three weeks. A curfew
from 8:00pm to 5:00am was also imposed.
4.9. Analysis of COVID-19 data of Zambia
The first three months of COVID-19 are described in Refs. [5, 34] since the first
two cases of COVID-19 on March 18, 2020. The top-left plot of Figure SM4
shows the COVID-19 data of Zambia and its SIDARTHE modeling. The validation of the modeling for Zambia, and the unaffected fraction of the Zambian
population are shown in right plots of Figure SM4.
As shown the bottom-left plot of Figure SM4, the R0 value around day
90 reflected a gradual relaxation of physical distancing measures in May and
June 2020. However, the R0 remained below 2 for all the dates, apart from
around day 130; this increase is due to an increase in testing. Some reports
suggested that the number of COVID-19 infections is likely to be higher than
the confirmed case counts because numerous infected people have moderate or
no symptoms, and limitations exist concerning testing capacity and surveillance
systems in Zambia [35].

5. Discussion
In our earlier studies, reported in Ref. [5], we concentrated on the first three
months of COVID-19 data. The studies presented in this paper are an extension of the earlier ones with more countries included and data up to twelve
months. We estimated the basic reproduction numbers by simultaneous fits of
the SIDARTHE model to the data of infected, recovered and dead cases. The
modeling followed the major changes in the data patterns that could be linked to
the pandemic evolution and the response measures applied. We note cyclic rises
and falls in the R0 as a function of time. Where no correlations between the R0
and the control measures can be made, other less obvious effects‚Äîsuch as difficulties to adhere to government directives or porous regional borders‚Äîmight
account for the observed patterns.
19

In many of the cases studied, the numbers of tests done were comparatively
small given the population sizes. We estimated the statistical uncertainties in
the data and propagated these to the uncertainties on R0 . At the start of the
pandemic when the data was small, estimates of R0 had large uncertainties.
These uncertainties reduced as the number of tests increased, thus the statistical uncertainty on R0 diminished. The systematic uncertainties have different
sources such as the methods of testing and data collections, and modeling errors.
In the current studies, we only estimated one source of systematic uncertainty
in the modeling: the SIDARTHE model of the healed population includes the
fraction of the infected people that are unaffected by the virus. However, the
data does not measure this fraction. We estimated this fraction as a systematic
uncertainty in the modeling and we combined it in quadrature with the statistical uncertainty to obtain the total uncertainties on the R0 estimates. The
experimental systematic uncertainties require further inputs from the methods
of testing and data collections, and these are beyond the scope of the current
studies.
It is important to consider why the data does not show a similar severity
of the disease in Africa as compared to Europe, America and some countries
in South America [36]. This is despite earlier studies predicting especially dire
scenarios for the course of the pandemic for Africa. Many hypotheses for this
have been presented, and we comment on this in the light of our own analyses. Consider a snapshot from Our World in Data, Statistics and Research,
Coronavirus (COVID-19) Cases, expressed as the 7-day average of daily new
confirmed COVID-19 cases (deaths) per million people [37]. On March 7, 2021,
there were the following results: Africa 7.12 (0.21), South Africa 18.59 (1.65),
Europe 187.05 (4.17), United States 179.85 (5.09). This puts the clinical prevalence for Africa at 51 (44) times lower than the average of the United states
and Europe, and for South Africa those numbers are 20 (5.6). The numbers
for South Africa are singled out as it is the country which has had the highest
clinical prevalence in Africa.
A recent study of seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among
20

blood donors in several provinces of South Africa was conducted in January
2021. At the time of writing, this research was a preprint [38]. It studied 4858
donors and found that the weighted estimates of prevalence by province, in
the age range of 15-69 year old, vary from 32 to 63% compared to clinicallyconfirmed cases in mid-January 2021 of 2.2 to 2.8%. The sampled group would
be a mixture of the susceptible and healed groups in the SIDARTHE model.
This indicates that the ratio of total infected to clinically-confirmed cases would
be at least an order of magnitude. This study would need to be validated and
also taken further. However, even if the data in Africa are considerably underrepresentative of the true prevalence, we would still conclude the incidence of the
disease in Africa has not been as severe as in the two wealthy regions considered
here.
The reasons for this large disparity which have been presented so far come
in two categories. Either the situation in Africa is dramatically under-reported,
or, indeed, the progression of the disease is less severe in Africa. Included in the
former category are some or all of the following reasons: cases going unreported
by not being presented at hospitals or clinics, insufficient testing facilities and
national testing program, and insufficient systems for contact tracing. Included
in the latter category have been the following reasons: the African national government systematic planned interventions have been effective, the population of
Africa is relatively young (lower mortality), the climate is on average warmer
(outdoor lifestyles and or lower infectiousness), cross-immunity conferred by the
some of the higher disease burden of Africa, benefits derived from other vaccinations (BCG for tuberculosis), the use of antimalarial drugs and the genetic
polymorphism of the angiotens in-converting enzyme 2 receptor [36].
We also note that in our discussion of the trajectory of the disease, we
could correlate changes of the basic reproduction number to government planned
interventions, in terms of enforced social distancing, encouraging safe social
behavior and restricting travel, externally and and internally. These correlations
argue that African governments indeed acted to influence the progression of
these disease, and that these actions had an observable effect. Also, in South
21

Africa, there is a well-established infrastructure in cities and rural areas, at
hospitals and clinics, with respect to treatment of HIV, tuberculosis and other
similar diseases. This means that contact tracing is already established. This
infrastructure was re-purposed for use in fighting the corona virus pandemic.
Similar situations pertain in other African countries. Although there is some
under-reporting of the course of the COVID-19 disease in Africa, the last two
observations make it unlikely that this is the only reason that the case load is
lower. Accordingly, we must consider that Africa has experienced a less severe
form of the pandemic, and consider the reasons why this could be so.

6. Conclusions
We analyzed twelve months of COVID-19 data of Cameroon, Ghana, Kenya,
Madagascar, Mozambique, Rwanda, South Africa, Togo and Zambia. For each
country, we estimated the time-dependent basic reproduction number, R0 . At
the onset of the pandemic, R0 was above one in all the cases studied. Over time,
the basic reproduction numbers followed the fluctuation patters reflected in the
data. The fluctuations were correlated with the control measures imposed and
the emergence of new cases. Approximately twelve months since the first cases
were detected in the countries studied, all the R0 were about or below one,
suggesting that the pandemic had slowed in these countries. However, because
the virus may mutate and new waves are likely to occur, we suggest to maintain
the control measures until enough vaccines have been administered to reach herd
immunity [39]. Our studies also estimated the fractions of the population that
were infected and not diagnosed but recovered without symptoms; in general,
we find that these fractions are between 1 ‚àí 10% of the recovered cases. The
modeling of vaccination campaigns and impact of SARS-CoV-2 variants are
beyond the scope of this work [40].
