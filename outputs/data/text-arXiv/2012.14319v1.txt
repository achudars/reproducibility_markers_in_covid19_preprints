Abstract
The COVID-19 disease has forced countries to make a considerable collaborative effort between scientists and
governments to provide indicators to suitable follow-up the pandemic’s consequences. Mathematical modeling
plays a crucial role in quantifying indicators describing diverse aspects of the pandemic. Consequently, this
work aims to develop a clear, efficient, and reproducible methodology for parameter optimization, whose implementation is illustrated using data from three representative regions from Chile and a suitable generalized SIR
model together with a fitted positivity rate. Our results reproduce the general trend of the infected’s curve,
distinguishing the reported and real cases. Finally, our methodology is robust, and it allows us to forecast
a second outbreak of COVID-19 and the infection fatality rate of COVID-19 qualitatively according to the
reported dead cases.
Highlights
• We developed a clear, efficient, and reproducible methodology for parameter optimization to calibrate real
data.
• We also provided a suitable generalized SIR model, including a fitted positivity rate.
• Our methodology reproduces the general trend of the infected’ curve for both the reported and the real
cases.
• It can also forecast different scenarios of the spreading and the infection fatality rate of COVID-19 qualitatively.

1. Introduction
From the early stage of the pandemic, the Chilean government has strengthened the health system by increasing
the number of intensive care unit beds and mechanical ventilation devices for critically ill patients. Currently,
the government is enhancing tools for tracing capture on cases and contacts of confirmed COVID-19 patients.
A collaborative effort among the main universities, the ministries of health and science, technology, knowledge,
and innovation produced a web platform for data analysis. The site provides key indicators to represent the
state and evolution of the pandemic. These indicators are meant to provide timely and clear information to
the authorities, communication media, citizenship, and the scientific community to understand the pandemic
evolution and improve decision-making.
Mathematical modeling plays a crucial role in quantifying indicators describing diverse aspects of the pandemic.
Many research groups in Chile have developed mathematical models, and providing a comprehensive review
would ask for much unnecessary effort. Therefore, we selected some that have produced periodic reports on
COVID-19, which we comment on next and partly use ideas. It is worth noting that, in general, these works
do not provide details on the methodology, which would be desirable to reproduce results scientifically.
The Center for Mathematical Modeling (CMM) group provided mainly simulations, not predictions. Their
results aimed to estimate the maximum capacity required for intensive care unit beds and simulate different
opening scenarios (for teaching and economic activities). They developed complex modeling based on a generalization of the SEIR compartmental model, including variables for hospitalized, separating those requiring
critical services, and even age structures, and containing several parameters making it difficult to deal with in
the sense of forecasting; see the website. [1].
The COVID-19 University of Concepción (UdeC) group provided simulations and predictions. Their results
aim to predict the curve of real infected for different datasets encompassing the Ñuble, Bı́o-Bı́o regions, and the
entire country and simulate different scenarios with or without confinements. They developed a variant of the
SEIR compartmental model, adding a fraction to account for the proportion of real infected observed by the
RT-PCR tests and carrying out parameter estimation to calibrate each dataset. In our work, we used some of
their ideas and compared some of our results of calibration for the Ñuble region; see the website [2].
We want to note that the research group of the previous paragraph and other manuscripts [3] support their ideas
in the fact that there are unreported cases or that only a fraction of the real infected is observed. Indeed, data
is measured with great uncertainty, as we explain in Section 2, and consequently has been reviewed and changed
retrospectively. In this sense, we aim to obtain a suitable model that fits the data and forecast the general
trend of the real infected’ curve, despite the uncertainty in data. We believe that the way is not constructing
a complex model. In that case, the parameter estimation required to make the model calibration becomes very
difficult or even impossible to do in real-time or does not necessarily provide suitable results. Concerning this,
we cite the work [4] that used a complex generalization of the SEIR model proposed in [5], and applied it
Chilean data until April 14, 2020, obtained that the peak of infected would occur between April and May, an
unsuitable prediction that may be explained because data were near to its zero equilibrium, as we will discuss
in Section 4.
Parameter estimation involves solving an inverse problem: given a model and measurements of some state or
output variables, the parameters that characterize the system, i.e., those producing a good fit of the model
2

with the data, need to be identified [6, 7]. This problem is difficult since no unique analytical or numerical
solution is usually available [6, 7]. Even if a unique solution was available, suitable initial guesses are required by
optimization solvers to compute suitable parameter estimates [6, 7]. From the previous discussion, the main goal
of the present study was to describe a hybrid approach [8], i.e., a methodology that holistically mixes mathematical modeling and experimental design, which is required, as shown in the literature, for better understanding
the studied system by fitting parameters of a given model with a specific scenario and for obtaining models
with predictive capability. In particular, we aim to develop a clear, efficient, and reproducible methodology for
optimization parameters, whose implementation is illustrated by using data from three representative regions
from Chile and a suitable generalized SIR model. The methodology relies on a numeric procedure called the
Trust-Region-Reflective optimization algorithm. Simultaneously, we computed the model’s predictive power
using goodness-of-fit criteria and assessed parameter uncertainty through sensitivities that yield the standard
errors.

2. A generalized SIR model with constant time delays and fitted positivity rate
The classical SIR model’s main assumptions are that the mean infection and recovery rates are positive constants
over time, which is not necessarily realistic for a given disease. In COVID-19, when a susceptible has just been
infected does not instantaneously show symptoms. There should be a time-delay period due to the SARS-CoV2 incubation. Similarly, the infected subjects are not recovered or dead instantaneously, but this would occur
within a time-delay period. Indeed, these time-delay periods for both phenomena, incubation, and removed (by
recovery or dead), are well documented and reported, e.g., in [9].
In this work, we consider the following generalization of the classical SIR model (adapted from the model from
Book by Hairer et al. [10] p. 295; [11]), which we will call generalized SIR model with constant time delays:
dS
(t) =
dt
dI
(t) =
dt
dR
(t) =
dt

β(t)
S(t)I(t − τ1 ),
N
β(t)
S(t)I(t − τ1 ) − γI(t − τ2 ),
N

−

γI(t − τ2 ).

(1a)
(1b)
(1c)

The parameters of the model (1) are β(t) that corresponds to the average number of contacts per person per
time, multiplied by the probability of disease transmission in exposure between a susceptible and an infectious
subject (see first report at the web site [1]), or more simply, β(t) is the mean rate of disease transmission; γ is
the mean removal rate, which in the classical SIR model represents the average time of infection duration; τ1 is
the mean incubation time of disease; τ2 is the median time from onset to clinical recovery or death caused by
disease, or the duration time of disease until recovery or death.
Parameter β(t) depends essentially on two factors: the disease characteristics and the contact rate within the
population [12]. Since we cannot modify the disease characteristics, authorities can foster or even impose
incentives to each individual to reduce his/her contact rate with other individuals in the population, causing a
decrease in β(t). Consequently, we consider β(t) variable in time to consider mitigation strategies dynamics of
COVID-19 such as scenarios confinement and opening at different periods.
The variables of model (1) are:
3

1. S, the number of susceptible individuals;
2. I, the number of infectious individuals;
3. R, the number of removed (and immune), or deceased individuals.
The initial conditions have to satisfy S(t0 ) + I(t0 ) + R(t0 ) = N , where N is the size of the population under
study for a closed system and taking into account that (S + I + R)′ (t) = 0 for all t > 0, and where t0 is a
day chosen suitably after the pandemic began, and which varies for every studied population (in Chile, the first
infected subject was detected on March 02, 2020). We remark that the model (1) considers the symptomatic
and presymptomatic subjects since the term I(t − τ1 ) at the right-hand side of the equation (1a) represents the
number of infected cases that do not manifest symptoms yet since the infection is under incubation.
The solution of model (1) will be defined in [t0 , T [, where T is defined as the first time at which the infected
number becomes zero, i.e., I(T ) = 0. From equation (1b), we have that for every t ∈ [t0 , T [, I ′ (t) > 0 if and
only if
β(t)
S(t)I(t − τ1 ) − γI(t − τ2 ) > 0,
N
or equivalently
Re (t) := ReSIR (t)RI (t) > 1,

where

ReSIR (t) :=

β(t)S(t)
γN

and RI (t) :=

I(t − τ1 )
.
I(t − τ2 )

(2)

In equation (2), Re (t) is the effective reproductive number of the generalized SIR model with constant time
delays (1), ReSIR (t) is the effective reproductive number in the classical SIR model, and RI (t) is the infected
ratio of the latent over the removed infected.
It is worth to note that the generalized SIR model with constant time delays can generate a complex dynamics
since, as we will see in Section 4, by contrast to the classical SIR model, it can simulate more than one local
maximum, providing thus a way to explain a COVID-19 second-outbreak, as already observed in some European
countries.
We assume that infectious subjects are detected only when RT-PCR tests are applied to them, and their results
are positive. Therefore the observation of this variable is equivalent to the number of positive RT-PCR tests.
In this sense, the number of asymptomatic subjects in the population is underestimated, given that they are
difficult to detect. Therefore this variable is difficult to observe with accuracy, so we did not consider it in our
modeling.
Remark. The generalized SIR model with constant time delays would produce better prediction results than
the classical SEIR model since no observation of the exposed population is available. This is because, similarly
to the asymptomatic population, the exposed are difficult to observe. Indeed, the Chilean government database
[13, 15], apart from the symptomatic cases, counts the asymptomatic cases, and there is no way to know how
many become symptomatic ones.
By contrast, the symptomatic cases are detected as symptoms manifest themselves, and the RT-PCR test
confirms the infection. Therefore, this variable is relatively well-observed, provided that the RT-PCR tests
are reliable and enough are available. Taking this into account, we assume that the daily number of infected
with symptoms reported by the ministry of health, denoted by Ir (t), is underestimated since it depends on

4

the availability and proper application of RT-PCR tests; see the presentation on COVID-19 in Chile in [14].
Consequently, we assume that Ir (t) is a fraction of the actual number of infected cases I(t), i.e.,
Ir (t) = f (t)I(t).

(3)

In equation (3) above, f (t) is the ratio between positive RT-PCR tests number and the real infected cases in
day t, which accounts for the real positivity rate. We modeled f (t) in the same way as Cabrera-Vives et al.; see
the first report in [2]. That is to say, f (t) is an inverted Sigmoid-type function such that if I(t) is small enough,
which occurred during the beginning of the outbreak, then an important fraction of the real infected cases are
detected (Ir (t) ≈ I(t)). On the contrary, when I(t) is large enough, which occurred just before the quarantines
were imposed, then only a small fraction 0 < a < 1 of the real infected cases are detected (Ir (t) ≈ aI(t)).
Precisely, f (t) is defined as
f (t) = 1 +

a−1
1 + e−k(I(t)−Im )

(4)

whose parameters are a, k and Im , where a and k represent the minimum and the decay rate of f (t), respectively.
On the other hand, the measure of how large/small is I(t) is given by a threshold Im such that I(t) ≪ Im implies
f (t) ≈ 1, and I(t) ≫ Im implies f (t) ≈ a.

3. Material and methods
This section describes the data and the methodology used for estimating the optimal parameters that produce
the model’ fit to the data.
The data corresponds to the reported Chilean government’s daily official cases at the regional level in the current
year, which we used to predict the COVID-19 spreading. We chose data from some representative regions of
the north, south, and central zones. Specifically, we worked with the Antofagasta, the Metropolitan, and the
Ñuble regions, where the Metropolitan Region is the most populous and which capital is Santiago of Chile, the
country’s capital. The data we used is available from the web site [15]; also, the countrywide level data is at
[13]. The data in [15] contains not only the number of confirmed cases but also the size of targeted populations
(N ) and the periods of quarantines per commune.
3.1. Scenarios for the fittings and forecastings
We fitted the model (1) to each dataset by taking into account different scenarios that encompass, at least,
three phases of the pandemic spreading: an early stage characterized by low dissemination and levels of daily
new infected cases relatively low, followed by a fast-propagation under quarantine, a measure taken by the
ministry of health as a reaction to the first phase in a selective way by sectors that may encompass several
communes of the region at different periods, characterized by a fast increasing of daily new infected cases and
finally, a spreading slowdown stage where the quarantine is relaxed. In a general way, to account for the phases
described, we modeled the mean rate of COVID-19 transmission β(t) by a piecewise constant function as
β(t) =

n
X

βi 1[ti−1 , ti [ (t)

for every t ∈ [t0 , T [ .

(5)

i=1

In the equation (5) above, βi denotes the mean rate of transmission for every scenario i = 1, · · · , n, n ≥ 3 is the
number of scenarios, 1[ti−1 ,ti [ (t) stands for the indicator (or characteristic) function of the time interval [ti−1 , ti [
5

that corresponds to the i−th scenario, t0 is the initial time, and T is the maximal time of existence of model
solutions, defined in Section 2. For the three datasets considered, the initial condition was imposed at a day t0
chosen with respect to day 1 that corresponds to March 03, 2020, when it began to measure the infected in the
three targeted regions.
From the definition (5) above, we denote the model parameters as the vector
θ = (β1 , β2 , · · · , βn , γ, τ1 , τ2 , a, k, Im ) ∈ Rn+6 , where n = 3 is the minimum of scenarios to calibrate the
model (1) to the data. In our computations, for the Antofagasta Region dataset, we split the second phase into
two to capture the real behavior of COVID-19 expansion more accurately due to two differentiated periods of
quarantine in that region, taking n = 4 in that case.
Finally, we simulated a possible change of scenario, which was evaluated by computing the relative errors
predicting data after the final calibration time. To do that, we solved the model (1) by taking a mean rate of
transmission β(t), as in (5), adding one more scenario to the n computed from the calibration, and letting vary
βn+1 to verify the value that forecasts the best possible the data after the calibration. To be precise, we solved
the model (1) by redefining β(t) as
β(t) =

n
X

β̂i 1[ti−1 , ti [ (t) + βn+1 1[tn , tn+1 [ (t)

for every t ∈ [t0 , T [ ,

where (β̂1 , β̂2 , · · · , β̂n ) ∈ Rn denotes the parameters estimated for the fitting of every dataset (computed
together with (γ̂, τ̂1 , τ̂2 , â, k̂, Iˆm )), the time tn represents a new change of scenario, tn+1 extends until the last
predicted datum, and βn+1 describes the value of the mean rate of transmission after the time tn (βn+1 = β̂n
means no change of scenario).
3.2. Identifiability analysis of model’ parameters
In this section, we explain in detail the methodology to conduct the identifiability analysis of model’ parameters,
i.e., finding the parameters of the generalized SIR model with constant time delays (1) that best fit to the every
dataset.
3.2.1. Direct and inverse problem
Given a parameters vector θ ∈ Rn+6 , the direct problem consists of finding the (unique) solution (S, I, R)(t, θ)
of model (1) with initial condition imposed at a suitable initial time, after the pandemic began. The solution to
the direct problem is required to solve the inverse problem. The present study aimed to forecast and simulate
different scenarios of COVID-19 expansion in Chile, for which we developed a clear, efficient, and reproducible
methodology to solve the parameter identification problem. This procedure is referred to as the inverse problem,
i.e., given data that provides observations of the variable I(t), namely Ir (t), for some time points t to identify the
parameters vector θ ∈ Rn+6 such that the mathematical model (1) fits the data in the sense of the least-squares.
More precisely, to solve the inverse problem of parameter estimation, we have to find the vector θ ∈ Rn+6 that
minimizes the sum of squares
S(θ) =

M

(Ir )j − f (j, θ2 )I(j, θ1 ) .

N j=1

The objective function defined in (7) corresponds to the sum of squares of the absolute errors

(7)
(Ir )j −f (j,θ2 )I(j,θ1 )
N

relative to the size of the targeted population N , i.e., of the differences between the daily number of infected
6

reported with symptoms, (Ir )j , and the theoretical daily symptomatic infected f (j, θ2 )I(j, θ1 ), which is a fraction
of the real symptomatic infected I(j, θ1 ), corresponding to the model solution evaluated at (j, θ1 ) at days
j = 1, · · · , M , for a given value of the parameters vector θ, and where M is the size of each dataset. The
variable I(t, θ1 ) depends on t and θ1 = (β1 , β2 , · · · , βn , γ, τ1 , τ2 ) ∈ Rn+3 , while the fraction f (t, θ2 ) depends
on t and θ2 = (a, k, Im ) ∈ R3 , with θ = (θ1 , θ2 ) ∈ Rn+6 .
The minimum of the sum of squares S(θ) is designated as θ̂ for every dataset. The vector θ̂ is called the nonlinear
least-squares estimator denoted as nonlinear LSE hereafter. To minimize S(θ), we applied the Trust-Region
Interior Reflective (TIR) method implemented in Matlab© as the subroutine lsqnonlin, specially adapted for
solving nonlinear least-squares minimization problems.
Below, we describe the entire methodology extensively. In Subsection 3.2.2, we provide details on the implementation of the lsqnonlin solver, specifically on the procedure to assess the quality of the optimal solution θ̂, and on
the stopping criterion associated with the algorithm, both concerning the convergence. Also, we computed the
fit performance by some goodness-of-fit criteria and represented graphically the traditional sensitivity functions
associated with the nonlinear LSE to assess parameter uncertainty, as explained in subsection 3.2.3.
3.2.2. Parameter estimation
Convergence of TIR method, as described in [16], is theoretically achieved under general conditions. However, in
practice, the convergence depends strongly on the initial parameter estimations, which has to be relatively close
to the optimal solution. We were able to efficiently minimize the objective function by a trial and error process,
by executing the codes hundreds of times, to guess the suitable initial parameters vector that is different for
every dataset [6, 7]. It is worth noting that the initial parameters that mostly influence the fitting results are
(β1 , β2 , · · · , βn ) that describe the mean rate of COVID-19 transmission, according to the scenarios of expansion.
As usual, there is a tradeoff among how well the model outputs fit the empirical data, the number of parameters
(increasing n), and the risk of overfitting. Moreover, there is the human factor involved in selecting the n time
intervals associated with each parameter β, although changes in lockdown policies determine reasonable interval
boundaries. We will estimate parameters using hand-picked intervals to address this issue, justifying our choices
in Section 4. In subsection 4.4, we will explore our results’ robustness using equal length intervals and varying
values of n.
To evaluate the objective function S(θ), we numerically solved the model (1) at days j = 1, · · · , M for different
parameters vectors θ depending on every dataset by applying a Rung-Kutta type formulae [17]. We invoked the
subroutine dde23 implemented in Matlab© , designed for solving delay differential equations (DDE) systems
with constant time delays. In addition, we had to reconstruct the function of history for the model (1) by
interpolating the daily reported data of infected with symptoms, recovered and dead considered for every dataset.
The interpolation used is a shape-preserving piecewise cubic as devised by the interp1 Matlab subroutine with
the option pchip.
As for the options chosen for the lsqnonlin solver, we first choose the TIR method as the optimization algorithm,
which is the default. Secondly, the maximum number of iterations was set at 1,000, while the maximum number
of function evaluations was set at 20,000. Finally, the function tolerance was set at 1.0e − 17, whereas the norm
of step tolerance, denoted by tol, was set variable between 1.0e − 14 and 1.0e − 08, depending on the targeted

7

(p)

dataset. The norm of the step δθ

> 0 measures the change between two successive iterates θ(p) and θ(p+1) ,

which is defined as:
(p)

δθ
On the other hand,

δS =

|S(θ(p) ) − S(θ(p+1) )|

(9)

is the relative change in the sum of squares. The stopping criterion for our algorithm is defined as:
(p)

(p)

δS < 1.0e − 17 or δθ

< tol.

(10)

When the previous condition is met, the algorithm stops at iteration p + 1 and returns an approximation of
the nonlinear LSE θ̂ = θ(p+1) , as well as an approximation of the Jacobian matrix χ evaluated at (j, θ̂) for
every dataset; see Subsection 3.2.3 for details. To check the convergence of the algorithm, we also provided
the first-order optimality measure, which measures how close the approximation is to the actual minimum of
the sum of squares under the criterion of first-order partial derivatives. The first-order optimality measure is
defined as the infinity norm of the gradient of the objective function evaluated at the nonlinear LSE θ̂, i.e., the
maximum absolute value of the partial derivatives of the objective function with respect to the θ variables:
k∇S(θ̂)k∞ =

max

ℓ=1,··· ,n+6

∂S
(θ̂) .
∂θℓ

(11)

(p)

Other metrics that quantify convergence are the norm of the step δθ , the relative change in the sum of squares
(p)

δS

(see equations (8)-(9)), and the number of iterations p + 1. Optionally, lsqnonlin displays the metrics of

convergence at the end of its execution.
We computed the model parameters θ = (β1 , β2 , · · · , βn , γ, τ1 , τ2 , a, k, Im ) ∈ Rn+6 within the following
bounds: 1 ≤ τ1 ≤ 14, 7 ≤ τ2 ≤ 56 days (the average for the time of incubation and removal, by recovery or
death, is 5 and 14 days respectively; see [9]), 0 ≤ a ≤ 1, min{Ir (t)} ≤ Im ≤ max{Ir (t)} in the time interval
considered, and all the rest of parameters are positive (i.e., between 0 and +∞).
3.2.3. Goodness-of-fit criteria and parameter uncertainty
We used statistical methods (from the context of nonlinear least-squares regression) to quantify the fit performance of the model to the data. More precisely, once estimating the nonlinear LSE θ̂, one may compute several
goodness-of-fit criteria, which evaluate how well the model (1) fits each dataset. We calculated σ̂ 2 and σ̂, the
unbiased variance of the residuals, and the root mean square error (RMSE) defined respectively in [18, 19] as

If the residuals

The matrix χ is called the traditional sensitivity function, and it quantifies the variation of the state variable
f (t, θ2 )I(t, θ1 ) with respect to changes in the parameters vector components θ = (θ1 , θ2 ) ∈ Rn+6 . Sensitivity
analysis can provide information about the relevance of data measurements to identify parameters; it then yields
the basis for new tools to design inverse problem studies; see [20] for details. By using the covariance matrix
given in (13), we can compute the standard error, se, and the normalized standard errors, nse, associated to
the nonlinear LSE θ̂ from which we could quantify the accuracy of the parameter estimate. Both quantities are
defined by

The quantities defined by (13)-(16) are asymptotic, i.e., they are valid only if each dataset size M is sufficiently

large because the nonlinear least-squares estimators are asymptotically normally distributed [18, 19]. We did
not provide the nse but plotted the sensitivities of parameters θl with a nse bigger than 100%; see (15).

4. Results and discussion
In this section, we show and discuss the numerical results obtained according to the generalized SIR model
with constant time delays (1), for each dataset corresponding to the selected regions of Chile for performing
the calibration and prediction. We start by describing how we chose the different scenarios, followed by the
fitting and prediction by using a figure that depicts the actual and calibrated infected, I(t) and f (t)I(t),
respectively, computed according to our model. Next, we discuss parameter estimation’s reliability by depicting
the traditional sensitivity functions for those parameters having a nse bigger than 100% if it applies; see (15)(16). A table follows that shows quantitative measures to verify the convergence of the optimization algorithm.
Concretely, the table shows the number of iterations made by the optimization solver to meet the stopping
criterion, the sum of squares’ optimal value, the RMSE, the first-order optimality measure, the norm of step,
and the estimated parameters’ values. Finally, we show numerical results to simulate an eventual change of
scenario, which effect we measured by computing the relative errors for predicted data after the final time of
calibration and discussing the number of infected’ curve’s long-time behavior.
We should warn that the actual values would depend on people behavior and of the measures taken by sanitary
authorities of the state. Therefore, the results of the article should consider as a general trend on curves’
behavior at simulation’ conditions.
4.1. Results for the Antofagasta Region
Next, we show and discuss fitting and forecasting results for the Antofagasta Region, whose capital is Antofagasta, located 1093 km. to the North of Santiago of Chile straight line. The region has N = 691, 854 inhabitants,
and it is representative of the country by its important ore activity. We fitted data starting from day 36 up to
day 201, corresponding to April 7 and September 19, respectively (dataset size M = 165). We chose April 7 as
the initial time because the number of active accumulated cases was 69.
The region had four of nine communes under confinement (Antofagasta, Mejillones, Calama, and Tocopilla) in
the following periods. Antofagasta and Mejillones from May 5 to May 29, and from June 23 to September 28;
Calama from June 9 to September 21, and Tocopilla from June 23 to August 9. On average and taking into
account the population density, we defined four scenarios for Antofagasta region as follows: [t0 , t1 [= [36, 64[
9

for the early expansion free of quarantine (between April 7 and May 5); [t1 , t2 [= [64, 84[ for the phase of fast
propagation under the first quarantine (between May 5 and May 29); [t2 , t3 [= [84, 113[ for a phase of quarantine’
relaxation with relatively fast propagation (between May 29 and June 23); and [t3 , t4 [= [113, 201[ for a phase
of slowdown expansion under the second quarantine (between June 23 and September 19).
Figure 1 depicts the model fitted to the Antofagasta Region dataset, plotting them each four-time points.

Figure 1: Calibration for the Antofagasta Region dataset from April 7 up to September 19

Figure 1 shows that the calibrated and actual curves of infected are very different from each other, except
in scenario 1 and near the end of scenario 4 of the pandemic. We expected this result since a few infected
people would be almost all detected, so the calibrated and actual curves would coincide. On the other hand, we
observe that the calibrated curve of infected fits quite well the data (infected reported Ir (t)). Indeed, since the
dataset is large enough and encompasses the four stages of the pandemic, we estimated the parameters reliably.
Only parameter k̂, corresponding to the decay rate of fraction f (t) (see (4)), has a nse bigger than 100%.
Its sensitivity function varies in the interval [-1.2e-05, 7.8e-06] for all t within the time interval of calibration;
therefore, its estimate is unreliable. However, all the rest of the parameters have a nse less than 100%, so fitting
is relatively reliable. Indeed, from Table 1, one can observe that the overall fitting is suitable since the error is
quite low (sum of squares and RMSE).

Table 1: Fit performance for the Antofagasta Region dataset from April 7 up to September 19

The trend for the mean transmission rates is realistic. Indeed, β̂1 is the largest for scenario 1 (free of quarantine),
followed by β̂2 for scenario 2 (with quarantine), followed by β̂3 for scenario 3 (free of quarantine), and finally
β̂4 is the least of the four for scenario 4 (with quarantine). The same trend is observed for the fittings of the
other datasets.
As explained in subsection 3.1, we will show different predictions assuming that β(t) may vary after September
19. Concretely, we run simulations by considering a mean transmission rate β(t) defined by (6) taking n = 4.
The predicted data (not fitted) encompasses September 20 to October 05, t5 = 217 that corresponds to this

Table 2: Predictions of the infected curve under different scenarios for the Antofagasta Region

From Table 2, we observe that β5 = 2β̂4 yields the least relative error mean, which implies that after the
11

quarantine finished on September 28, the mean rate of transmission doubled, producing a negative change of
scenario. Our model forecasts that, if these conditions kept, a COVID-19 second-outbreak would occur in the
Antofagasta Region. The peak of this new outbreak would occur around January 24, 2021, with an estimate of
102,154 real infected and 23,703 daily reported infected.
4.2. Results for the Metropolitan Region
Next, we show and discuss the results of fitting and forecasting for the Metropolitan Region (RM), whose capital
is Santiago of Chile, also the capital of Chile. We fitted data starting from day 15 until day 203 corresponding
to March 17 and September 21, respectively (dataset size M =189). We chose March 17 as the starting day
because the number of newly infected with symptoms was 29, with 152 active accumulated cases.
The region has N = 8, 125, 072 inhabitants (around 41.76% of the total inhabitants of Chile) and 52 communes.
From these, 47 communes have been under selective quarantine at different periods (few of which are yet),
the most of which on average between May 7 and June 30. Therefore, we defined the three scenarios for MR
as follows: [t0 , t1 [= [15, 66[ for the first stage that encompasses the period from March 17 to May 7 (early
expansion free of quarantine on average); [t1 , t2 [= [66, 120[ for the second phase that ranges from May 7 to June
30 (fast propagation under quarantine); and [t2 , t3 [= [120, 203[ for the third step that goes from June 30 up to
September 21 (slowdown expansion with relaxation of quarantine on average).
Figure 2 depicts the model fitted to the MR dataset, plotting them each four-time points.

Figure 2: Calibration for MR dataset from March 17 up to September 21

Figure 2 shows that curves of calibrated and actual infected are very different from each other. On the other
hand, we observe a good calibration of the model to the data since the computed curve of infected, f (t)I(t),
fits quite well the daily reported infected, Ir (t). Indeed, since the dataset is large enough and encompasses
the three stages of the pandemic, we estimated the parameters reliably, which is reinforced by the fact that
the maximum nse is 4.4e − 04%, meaning very accurate calibration results. To further appreciate the suitable
fitting of the model, Table 3 presents its performance.

Table 4: Predictions of the infected curve under different scenarios for the MR

From Table 4, we observe that β4 = 1.125β̂3 yields the least relative error (minimum and mean), which reinforces
the assumption that the quarantine is valid for the MR between May 7 and June 30, on average, and that there
was a little change of scenario from August 31 until September 28. Our model forecasts that, if these conditions
kept, a COVID-19 second-outbreak would occur in the MR. The peak of this new outbreak would occur around
February 27, 2021, with an estimate of 154,698 real infected and 42,086 daily reported infected.

4.3. Results for the Ñuble Region
Next, we show and discuss fitting and forecasting results for the Ñuble Region, located 403.8 km. to the south of
Santiago of Chile, and whose capital city is Chillán (population N = 511, 551). On September 21, Chillán was
the fourth city with more active infected per 100,000 inhabitants (407 cases). The three scenarios considered
here are more easily identifiable than for the MR and the Antofagasta Region since the quarantines in the Ñuble
Region were imposed mostly in Chillán at a single date within the time interval of calibration.
We split the results into two parts; first, we did the fitting for the data from March 21 to April 27 and next
from March 21 to September 02. Therefore, the scenarios are the following: [t0 , t1 [= [19, 28[ for the first stage
that encompasses the period from March 21 up to March 30 (early expansion); [t1 , t2 [= [28, 52[ for the second
phase that ranges from March 30 up to April 23 (fast propagation under quarantine); and [t2 , t3 [ where t2 = 52
and t3 = 57 or t3 = 184 for the third step that goes from April 23 to April 27 and to September 2 (slowdown
expansion, free of quarantine), corresponding to the first and second result, respectively.
4.3.1. Results for fitting until April 27
To compare with the only quantitative results we know of for the fitting of data from the Ñuble Region (see the
first report by Cabrera-Vives et al. [2]), we did the fitting starting from day 19 (March 21) until day 57 (April
27) (dataset size M = 39), when the accumulated infected at the Ñuble Region were 58. It is worth noting that,
because of the small number of data points, the third scenario does not represent a spreading’s slowdown. We
performed this fitting only to compare our results with that of Cabrera-Vives and collaborators’ first report.
Figure 3 depicts the model fitted to the dataset for the Ñuble Region, plotting the data each two-time points.

Figure 3: Calibration for the Ñuble Region dataset from March 21 up to April 27

From Figure 3, we observe that the calibrated curve of infected does not fit suitably the data, despite that
the optimization solver converged (the last change in the relative sum of squares is less than the value of the
function tolerance). Indeed, the calibrated curve does not represent the trend of not fitted data from April 28
to May 02 (not reported here). Following the findings in [20], the explanation is that the data used to make the

14

fitting is close to the zero equilibrium (the early stage of the pandemic), suggesting limited ability to determine
some parameters reliably. This is related to the traditional sensitivity functions, depicted in Figure 4, for the
parameters estimated with a nse bigger than 100%; see (15)-(16).

Figure 4: Sensitivity functions for parameters estimated with a nse bigger than 100%

From Figure 4(right), we observe that parameters k̂ and Iˆm (see equation (4)) have the smallest sensitivities
(very near to zero for every t), which implies that their estimations are not reliable. By contrast, Figure 4(left)
shows that parameter γ̂ has the largest sensitivity, which means that its estimate is relatively better than the
other parameters having a nse bigger than 100%. In the case of parameters (β̂1 , β̂2 , β̂3 ), Sβ̂1 (t) and Sβ̂3 (t) are
small in the regions of scenarios 1 and 3, where β̂1 and β̂3 represent the mean rates of transmission, respectively;
by contrast, Sβ̂2 (t) is large enough in the region of scenario 2, where β̂2 describes the mean rate of transmission.
Consequently, the estimation of β̂2 is relatively better than those of β̂1 and β̂3 . We will see that fitting the data
in the three phases of the pandemic provides better results.

The results are comparable with that from the first report by Cabrera-Vives et al. [2] (a similar RMSE),
15

although we did the fitting by using the real date at which the authorities imposed the quarantine. Our model
also forecasts that, if the same conditions of the third scenario kept, the outbreak’s peak would occur around
February 20, 2021, that qualitatively coincides with the prediction obtained by Cabrera-Vives et al. [2]; see the
bottom of Figure 1 from the first report. However, according to the previous discussion, the fitting obtained
from data near an equilibrium point produces wrong prediction results [20, 21].
4.3.2. Results until September 2
Now, we show the results of fitting and predictions for the data from Ñuble Region, widening the time window
from March 12 to September 02 (dataset size M = 175), considering the same constraints as before (quarantine
from March 30 to April 23), but now t3 = 184 instead of 57 (day 184 corresponds to September 2). Figure 5

Table 6: Fit performance for the Ñuble Region dataset from 12 March to 02 September

Consistently with the results obtained fitting the dataset until April 27, our model forecasts that, if the same
conditions of the third scenario kept, the outbreak’s peak would occur around March 02, 2021. However, we
would expect a change of scenario since September 2 because authorities re-imposed confinement in Chillán due
to the high increase in daily new cases.
As explained in subsection 3.1, we will show different predictions assuming that β(t) may vary after September
2 due to the confinement (helpful or counterproductive measure depending on people behavior). Concretely,
we run simulations by defining β(t) as in (6) (with n = 3) to predict the data (not fitted) between September
3 and September 22 (data number = 20), and putting t3 = 184 and t4 = 204 that correspond to September 2
17

and 22, respectively. Table 7 shows the range (minimum and maximum) and the average of the relative errors
of the model’ forecasting for different values of β4 .

Table 7: Predictions of the infected curve under different scenarios for the Ñuble Region

From Table 7, we observe that β4 = 0.75β̂3 yields the least relative error maximum and mean. The interpretation
is that quarantine effectively reduced the transmission rate, and therefore there was a positive change of scenario
since September 2. Our model forecasts that, if these conditions kept, a COVID-19 second-outbreak would not
occur in the Ñuble Region.
Finally, Figure 7 depicts the calibrated and real curves of infected for the Ñuble Region until September 25, by
taking β4 = 0.75β̂3 as before. The third peak corresponds to September 2, the final calibration date.

18

date; see [22].
4.4. On the robustness of the optimization algorithm and the estimation of the infection fatality rate
To assess the robustness of the β parameter estimations we repeated the fitting processed we described in
Subsection 4.2 after modifying some assumtions. Instead of assuming that β(t) is piecewise constant and
defining the three scenarios based on actual policy changes, here we considered β(t) to be piecewise linear with
n − 1 equal length time intervals. More formally we replaced equation 5 with
β(t) =

n
X

βi Ti (t)

(17)

i=1

where Ti is the tent function with value of one at ti and tapers off to zero at ti−1 and ti+1 . Thus, we determine
n values for the β̂i ’s. We tried 5 values for n and we summarize the results in Table 8.

Table 8: Estimators for β(t) using n − 1 segments piecewise linear functions.

The results in Table 8 are, up to a point, compatible with the values shown in Table 3. For example, we can see
that for values of i ≈ n/2 the β̂i ’s are in the [0.13, 0.19] range consistently for β̂2 from Table 3. Moreover, for
n = 4 and n = 5 the same trend follows as in Table 3, i.e., the values for β̂i are relatively large for both small
and large i’s (first and last scenario). We already stated in Section 4 that this was a consequence of the different
scenarios considered for each dataset. The same trend is not seen if n = 7. This is natural, as having many time
intervals, and therefore many β̂i ’s parameters to adjust will tend to cause overfitting. Indeed, we observe across
rows of Table 8 a relatively large variability (range [0.13, 0.75]) among the β̂1 ’s. The same can be said about the
values for β̂n (range [0.09, 0.42]). One consequence of this observation is that predictions are likely to be very
inaccurate if we simply assume that β̂n will hold during an extrapolation beyond the last data point after trying
the fitting with a single n. Nonetheless, we can use the ranges the β̂n ’s lie on for a scenario analysis as we did in
Section 4 (tables 2, 4 and 7). Another consequence is the difficulty to estimate precisely the effectiveness of the
quarantine procedures. This follows from the variability within each row of Table 8. In principle, quarantines
should lower the values for β. However, because of the inherent inaccuracy of the estimation during the initial
disease propagation, and the enforcement of quarantines as soon as the cases multiply (and thus the estimation
becomes reliable), computing the temporal changes in β accurately is more than challenging. Yet, for small
values of n (say 4 or 5), the qualitative behavior of the βi ’s we expect is observed.
Furthermore, it is of practical interest to estimate the lethality of a disease. The infection fatality rate (IFR), the
probability of dying for an infected person, is computed as the ratio of dead subjects to the number of infected
people for the targeted population [23]. However, according to our model, there is a time delay between that
an infected person recovers or dies (τ2 ), and therefore to compute the IFR at a given day t, we divided D(t)
19

(the number of death at t) into the number of infected at time t − τ2 . To exemplify the model’s usefulness, we
will show IFR estimations computed for each dataset by combining empirical data and model outputs. To do
that, we will use τ2 from Tables 1, 3 and 6, D(t) the confirmed number of deaths for each region reported in
[15], and the actual number of infected I(t) computed from the outputs of model 1. As usual, we divided the
process into the scenarios, as described in Section 4, plus the pandemic’s entire period used in the calibration.
Table 9 shows the IFR medians in percentage.

Table 9: IFR median estimation for each dataset

We computed the median since it is more appropriate for skewed distribution, such as the confirmed number of
deaths, D(t), which are raw data. We did not plot the IFR since it presents many oscillations and a few outlier
values because of uncertainty in data and the numerical error of calibration results. The values of Table 9 are
consistent with the recent results in [23], where the author claims that IFR ∈ [0%, 1.54%], which implies that
the curve of real infected provided by the model is accurate since it yields a realistic value for the IFR’s median
in the case of MR. By contrast, for the Ñuble and Antofagasta Regions, the confirmed death cases are not large
enough to yield an accurate IFR’s estimation (for neither mean nor median).

5. Conclusions
We described and successfully implemented a clear, efficient, and reproducible parameter estimation methodology to a generalized SIR model with constant time delays that can reproduce complex dynamics for COVID19. We illustrated our methodology and modeling by carrying out parameter estimation for three datasets
corresponding to Chile’s three representative regions, although this can be applied to any country. From a
methodological viewpoint, we assessed the reliability of estimated parameters and shown that when the data
are located in the transition from the zero to the non-zero equilibria (encompassing all the stages of pandemic
spread), the parameters are reliably estimated. Also, we verified our optimization methodology’s robustness by
considering an arbitrary number of n scenarios.
The numerical results allow us to forecast the general trend of the infected’ curve, the calibrated and the
real, and provide some predictions that allow us to prognosticate a possible COVID-19 second-outbreak. This
prognosis is valid only if the conditions that allowed arrive at the estimated mean transmission rate are kept.
In the absence of an effective vaccine or drug, these conditions are essentially translated into self-care. Finally,
we showed that our model is precise enough to reproduce the infection fatality rate fairly accurately, according
to the reported dead cases.
There are two lines of research that we would like to tackle. First, we expect to apply our model and methodology
to other regions/communes in Chile. Because of the heterogeneity among their socio-economic conditions, the
pandemic has affected them differently. On the other hand, we intend to calibrate our model to the reported dead

20

to estimate more accurately and quantitatively the infection fatality rate of COVID-19, including structures of
age and the dynamics of interactions among individuals of diverse age groups.
