Abstract
A primary quantity of interest in the study of infectious diseases is the average number of new infections that an infected person produces. This so-called
reproduction number has significant implications for the disease progression.
There has been increasing literature suggesting that superspreading, the significant variability in number of new infections caused by individuals, plays an
important role in the spread of SARS-CoV-2. In this paper, we consider the
effect that such superspreading has on the estimation of the reproduction number and subsequent estimates of future cases. Accordingly, we employ a simple
extension to models currently used in the literature to estimate the reproduction
number and present a case-study of the progression of COVID-19 in Austria.
Our models demonstrate that the estimation uncertainty of the reproduction
number increases with superspreading and that this improves the performance
of prediction intervals. Of independent interest is the derivation of a transparent formula that connects the extent of superspreading to the width of credible
intervals for the reproduction number. This serves as a valuable heuristic for
understanding the uncertainty surrounding diseases with superspreading.

1. Introduction
The reproduction number, Rt ≡ R, gives the average number of new infections caused by a single infected person throughout the infectious period. In
contrast to the basic reproduction number R0 , which describes the reproduction
of the virus in a naı̈ve, unmitigated population, R (sometimes called the effective reproduction number) varies through time as the epidemic develops and the
opportunities for transmission change due to, for example, behavioral response,
seasonality, and changes in the relative size of the susceptible population. In
every population, some individuals will cause considerably more infections than
others - a phenomenon known as superspreading. It can be quantified using a
framework provided by Lloyd-Smith et al. [13]. In this paper, we extend the
model of Cori et al. [4] to include the phenomenon of superspreading. Our goal
is to better quantify the uncertainty inherent in this type of estimate of R, not
to derive a more accurate estimate.
Ultimately we are interested in the estimation of R and specifically the question whether, given current case numbers, we can claim with statistical guarantees that R ≤ 1 or R > 1. Given the growing body of evidence about the
existence and importance of superspreaders [2, 12], we incorporate this feature
into our models. We observe two important effects: first, it becomes increasingly difficult to accurately estimate the reproduction number R in the presence

of superspreading; second, models with superspreading produce prediction intervals for new cases that have improved coverage compared to those without
superpreading. Both of these are demonstrated in our Austrian case-study in
Section 3. In particular, it becomes infeasible even in early May to support the
claim that R < 1 using our methods. This is a critical period of time as it
coincides with the removal of lockdown restrictions in Austria.
In particular, the width of a credible interval for R should decrease as a
function of total number of cases used during estimation and increase with the
extent of superspreading. Let S be the set of days used to estimate R in the
nowcasting framework presented in Section 1.1 and assume that the (average)
reproduction number does not change over time. One would then expect that
a (1 − α)% credible interval to have width approximately equal to
2z1−α/2
p P
,
k s∈S Is

(1.1)

where z1−α/2 is the (1 − α/2) quantile of the standard normal distribution and
for values of dispersion parameter k much smaller than 1, which corresponds to
scenarios with high superspreading. We derive this exact functional form in a
simplified model introduced in Section 2.2.
1.1. Nowcasting
The goal of nowcasting is to get accurate estimates of the current state of
an epidemic. Given that our observed infections are random observations from
an underlying process, our goal is to understand the parameters of that process,
particularly with respect to the reproduction number. In addition, we define
a time-varying parameter we call the “momentum” of an epidemic, which is a
random realization of population infectiousness at a time-point which accounts
for superspreading. This is introduced formally in Section 2.1.
Benchmark methods for estimating the reproduction number R include those
of Cori et al. [4] and Wallinga and Teunis [20]. The method of Cori et al. [4]
provides near real-time estimation of R and is implemented in the R software
package ‘EpiEstim’. An improvement of this framework is given in Thompson et al. [18] which accounts for variability in the generation interval (defined
below). A substantial extension of the EpiEstim-package (‘EpiNow’) was developed by a group of researchers at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical
Medicine [1]. The method of Wallinga and Teunis [20] provides an alternate
estimate for historical values of R. Contrary to the methods discussed in this
paper, it requires observations from both before and after the time point at
which an estimate for R is desired. An important overview of other estimation
methods and challenges due to COVID-19 is given in Gostic et al. [9] and a
comparative analysis of statistical methods to estimate R is given in O’Driscoll
et al. [16]. If the epidemic is at an early stage, the reproduction number R
and the rate of exponential growth are connected by the Euler-Lotka equation
[19, 15].

As we follow the framework of Cori et al. [4], we briefly describe their basic
model. Let I0 be the number of initial infections and I1 , I2 , . . . be the number of
new infections on days 1, 2, . . .. By (wn )n≥1 we denote the generation interval
distribution. If Jm denotes the number of people infected by a specific person
on the m-th day after this person got infected, then we have for m ∈ N
E[Jm ]
.
wm = P∞
l=1 E[Jl ]
We assume that a newly infected individual does not cause secondary cases
on the same day, corresponding to w0 = 0. The generation interval can be
interpreted as the infectiousness profile of infected persons.
The basic model of Cori et al. [4] assumes that the stochastic process of total
new infections on day t, (It )t∈N , satisfies
!
t
X
It ∼ Poisson Rt
It−m wm ,
(1.2)
m=1

for a sequence of numbers Rt , t ∈ N. In practice it is often assumed that the
generation interval distribution is given as a Gamma distribution that has been
discretized in such a way that wm = 0 for all m larger than some cut-off number
ν [9]. As a result, the sum in (1.2) will only have ν ∈ N summands, and to make
assertions about It we only have to consider the case numbers It−ν , . . . , It−1 .
As ν is a parameter that can vary between diseases, this term is kept and used
throughout our model description in Section 2.1.
When estimating the time-varying reproduction number, Cori et al. [4] assume that the reproduction number has stayed constant over a window of τ
days. In this case, for s ∈ (t − τ + 1, . . . , t), equation (1.2) simplifies to
!
ν
X
Is ∼ Poisson R
Is−m wm .
(1.3)
m=1

In order to treat R as fixed in the above expression, it is necessary to only
explicitly model a subset of time points, lest R be assumed constant over all
time points.
Note that the reproduction number in the sense of (1.3) does not denote
the number of people that actually have been infected by a given individual,
but rather describes what one would expect in an “average” evolution of the
epidemic. Furthermore, while R = Rt is assumed to be constant over the window
of width τ , as this window moves through time the method produces estimates
of R that slowly vary over time.
1.2. Heterogeneity in Reproduction Numbers
The motivation for our hierarchical Bayesian approach follows the framework
of superspreading provided in Lloyd-Smith et al. [13]. Even if the reproduction
number R is constant over a small window of time, it might vary between
4

individuals. We consider the reproduction number of a specific person with
index x to be drawn randomly as
rx ∼ Gamma(k, rate = k/R).

(1.4)

This distribution has mean R and variance R2 /k. Note that the above gamma
distribution will also be referred to as having dispersion parameter k. The degenerate case k = ∞ corresponds to the deterministic case where rx = R for all
individuals and leads to the model in (1.3). Given rx = r, this person causes
Poisson(r) new infections. If one integrates out the Poisson parameter r, one is
left with the unconditional number of descendants which follows a negative binomial distribution with mean R and variance R+R2 /k. This negative binomial
model is further analyzed in Section 2.2.
A basic extension of (1.3) that follows the concept of random individual
reproduction numbers in the sense of Lloyd-Smith et al. [13] is to assign, on day
t, the individual reproduction numbers r1t , . . . , rItt to the It individuals that got
infected on this day. This leads to the recursion


It−m

(1.5)

x=1

where the individual reproduction numbers rxm are drawn i.i.d. according to
(1.4). Note that for the degenerate case k = ∞, (1.5) recovers (1.3). This forms
the foundation of the model explained in detail in Section 2.1.
The theme of the present paper is close to that of Donnat and Holmes
[5], in which heterogeneity in R between groups is explicitly modeled. While
the high-level descriptions of these models sound nearly identical, those models
are relevantly different than ours. In particular, Donnat and Holmes [5] are
interested in estimating group-specific or time-varying reproduction numbers
for different geographical regions and age groups. On one hand, with sufficient
group-specific data, this provides tools of a much broader scope than we present
here; on the other hand, it is assumed that within-group variability is negligibly
small. Instead, we focus on aggregate data from a single geographical region but
do not assume that individual variability is negligible. Rather, this is precisely
the variability we are interested in modeling. Furthermore, our critiques of the
estimability of the reproduction number transfers to their setting as well: if
within-group variability exists, group-specific reproduction numbers are more
difficult to estimate than previously acknowledged.
2. Methods
This section introduces two methods. First, the “momentum” model formulates the estimation problem as a Bayesian Poisson regression. Second, the
“generation” model is a simplification which provides a fast approximation to
the momentum model as well as an explicit formula for dependence of credible
interval width on k. Both are of interest beyond COVID modeling and aim to
5

address different goals: precise estimation (momentum) and valuable speed and
heuristics (generation).
2.1. The “Momentum” Model
As mentioned in the introduction, we identify an unobserved random variable
which we term the “momentum” of the epidemic. This follows from a simple
notational change in (1.5) according to the observation that a sum of i.i.d.
Gamma random variables is also Gamma distributed with the same dispersion
parameter. We rewrite (1.5) as

where
θt =

rxt ∼ Gamma(It k, rate = k/R).

(2.2)

x=1

The terms (θt )t≥0 are collectively referred to as the “momentum” of the disease.
They will be treated as a set of nuisance parameters of the offspring distribution, as our primary interest lies in estimating the reproduction number R. In
our Bayesian framework introduced below, R is a hyperparameter of the prior
distribution for (θt )t≥0 . Equation (2.1) describes the distribution of It conditioned on its whole past, i.e., Is , θs , s < t. Analogously, equation (2.2) describes
θs given its history. The difference in what we understand as the relative past
originates from θt being conceptually determined “after” It .
For increased clarity of the form of the model and the estimation methods
required, we recast our model as a Bayesian Poisson regression using vector
notation. This is made painfully explicit by using an arrow as in I~ for vectors.
Following Cori et al. [4], we estimate R by explicitly modeling a set of τ days
over which we assume R to be constant. We specify the regression function for
each observation in this estimation window. To condense notation, we use [l],
for l ∈ N, to be the vector (1, 2, . . . , l). Similarly, [l, m] for l, m ∈ N is shorthand
for the vector (l, l + 1, . . . , m), i.e., [l] = [1, l]. This notation will primarily be
used for vector indices. Furthermore, the indices of our vectors increase in time.
As such, our generation interval truncated to ν days can be condensely written
as w
~ [ν] = (w1 , . . . , wν ). Similarly, the τ observations we model are given by
I~[t−τ +1, t] = (It−τ +1 , . . . , It ).
As a regression model for I~[t−τ +1, t] , equation (2.1) can be written as
I~[t−τ +1,t] ∼ Poisson(W θ~[t−ν−τ +1,t−1] ) where

In the above expression, we have a fixed covariate matrix W which is a function
of the generation interval w[ν] . The momentum parameters θ~[t−ν+τ −1,t−1] are
seen to be the regression parameters to be estimated. Note that the expressions
in the previous display suppress the notation for conditioning on all observations
before time t − τ + 1. Furthermore, given θ~[t−1] , It is independent of I~[t−1] .
We place a prior distribution on θ~ which depends on R as in equation (2.2), as
well as a hyperprior on R to account for the previously identified uncertainty in
the distribution of R as reported in Abbott et al. [1]. As we have parameterized
the gamma prior on θt to have mean It R, the conjugate hyperprior for R is the
inverse-gamma distribution. This is transparent in the posterior distribution
given by equation (2.4) below. Hence we use an inverse-gamma hyperprior on
R, where these hyperparameters are set to match the results of Abbott et al.
[1]. As such, we assume that R has mean 2.6 and standard deviation 2, yielding
shape parameter 3.69 and rate parameter 6.994:
R ∼ Inv-Gamma(3.69, rate = 6.994).
An a priori distribution for R is itself uncertain and one could theoretically place
additional hyperpriors on the parameters of this inverse-gamma distribution.
That being said, the change would increase computational complexity while
introducing hyper-hyperparameters that would be difficult to estimate. Hence,
this proposal distribution for R is treated as fixed.
This regression formulation is important as it highlights the latent variables
θ~ that are required to fully determine the generative model. It also focuses
attention on which observations are conditioned upon and which are treated as
random, i.e., the τ observations to which we fit the model are treated as random.
This is relevant as more than τ nuisance parameters are present, namely ν+τ −1.
Observe that the earliest data point is It−τ +1 , which itself requires a history of
ν momentum values of θ~ to determine.
While we also think of individual reproduction numbers as changing over
time due to factors such as changes in social restrictions, the assumption of
constant R over a period renders this moot. Likewise, we set k to be a constant
for the results presented in Section 3, as k is best estimated with contact tracing
data instead of case count data. We set k = 0.072, in line with the results
of Laxminarayan et al. [11], which estimated the extent of superspreading for
COVID-19 from Indian data. This is also within the range of parameter values
identified in Endo et al. [6].
Alternatively, it is possible to consider an independently estimated distribution for k. To estimate the momentum model with random k, one can merely
draw k from a proposal distribution and estimate the momentum model with
this fixed value. This process is repeated for many sampled values of k, and
the posterior samples for R and It from all k are combined. This follows the
same methodology as Thompson et al. [18], where the generation interval was
estimated with a separate data set before fitting model (1.3) without superspreading. Brief results for this case are presented in Appendix B as none of
the results change significantly. The joint estimation of k and R within the
7

momentum model appears infeasible as k is the dispersion parameter of the
nuisance parameter distribution. This makes learning about k using this data
highly challenging.
A full derivation of the posterior distribution of the pair R, θ~[t] given I~[t] is
given in Appendix A. We obtain as posterior
p(R, θ~[t−τ −ν+1, t−1] |I~[t−τ −ν+1, t] )
∝ p(I~[t−τ +1, t] , θ~[t−τ +1, t−1] |θ~[t−τ −ν+1, t−τ ] , I~[t−τ −ν+1, t−τ ] , R)p(θ~[t−τ ] , R|I~[t−τ ] )

The first line of (2.4) specifies the distribution of the observations given all
other parameters, and the third line gives the inverse-gamma prior for R. The
~ and we have explicitly partitioned the
second line describes the distribution of θ,
indices into two sets. The values θs in the first index set [t − τ + 1, t − 1] require
no special discussion as they depend on values Is which are being explicitly
modeled. The values of θs in the second index set [t − ν − τ + 1, t − τ ], however,
treat the corresponding Is values as fixed and constant. This is done so that we
do not need to specify further nuisance parameters before time t − τ − ν + 1.
Doing so would create an infinite recursion in historical observations, requiring
us to treat Rt as fixed for all t. Hence we need not only a prior for R, but also
for θ~[t−τ −ν+1, t−τ ] . More details are provided in Appendix A.
In order to condense notation for summations in exponents, let S be the
index set for the second product; i.e., S = {t − ν − τ + 1, t − ν − τ + 2, . . . , t − 1}.
The additional shorthand below drops “s ∈” from s ∈ S. With this notation,
the posterior distribution of R given θ~ and I~ is

which is Inv-Gamma(k S Is + 3.69, k S θs + 6.994). A perhaps counterintuitive observation is that the posterior distribution of R does not depend
on the generation interval w
~ [ν] . This is the result of conditioning on θ~ versus
integrating it out as done in Lloyd-Smith et al. [13]. In our case, it is infeasible
to integrate out θ~ as the dependence is too complex. If we truly know population
infectiousness, i.e., the epidemic momentum at all points in time, then w
~ [ν] is
irrelevant for estimating R, because w
~ [ν] just determines how we learn about θ~
~
via (2.3). More concretely, there are no terms in (2.4) that include all of R, θ,
and w[ν] .

The denominator of the variance picks up an additional k term, making
credible intervals wider when k is small. The dependence on θ~ is difficult to
remove in this general setting. Section 2.2 considers a simpler setting in which
θ~ can be integrated out in order to derive a transparent function for credible
interval width.
To estimate this model, we alternate between a Gibbs-step to sample R and

reasonable starting values for θ using various values of R such that we require
little burn-in. We find total chain length to be the more important tuning
parameter for valid prediction and credible intervals. In all models presented in
this paper, we set ν = τ = 13 to make valid comparisons with results from the
EpiEstim framework [4]. We set w
~ [ν] to be a discretized gamma distribution
with mean 4.46 and standard deviation 2.63 per the results of Richter et al. [17]
for Austria, which are similar to values determined elsewhere [10, 7]. Inference
is conducted using the 106 samples that remain after a burn-in of 1,000 and
thinning by 5.
While the majority of the model validation and supporting graphs is relegated to Appendix B, we address here the particular concern that we have 25
nuisance parameters in θ~ for modeling 13 observations. Our simulation evidence
indicates that all nuisance parameters are well-estimated, even those far in the
past: coverage of θ~ by credible intervals in simulated data is nearly exact. Furthermore, we see approximate coverage when predicting new cases in Section
3. As such, we do not believe that we are over-fitting the data with a larger
number of nuisance parameters. This is in part due to the role of the prior
distribution for θs . For example, the first nuisance parameter θt−ν−τ +1 only
appears in a single observation term in the posterior (2.4): the distribution of
It−τ +1 . Similarly, θt−ν−τ +2 only appears in two, etc. The prior therefore plays
a larger role in determining the values of these parameters.
2.2. Generation Model
In order to directly relate the dispersion parameter k to the width of the
credible interval and to provide a fast approximation to the momentum model,
we consider the trivial generation interval in which an infected person is only
infectious for a single day. For real data, this assumption is obviously inaccurate.
Therefore, we switch to modeling infections per generation instead of infections
per day. While we model generations spanning multiple days, we estimate and
forecast cases for conventional days.
When the generation interval w is of this form, w
~ [1] = (1), the model is
purely Markovian and the data follow a Galton-Watson process. Recall that a
9

Poisson(λ)-distributed random variable Y , where λ is distributed according to
Gamma(α, β), follows a negative binomial distribution [13]:

In Appendix C, we reparameterize this model in terms of R+k

that s=t−τ +1 Is and k s=t−τ Is are of this approximate ratio: the terms in
these two sums almost entirely overlap. Furthermore, while the hyperparameters

ratio. This yields the following simplification of the variance of the normal

It is clear that the assumption ν = 1 is highly unrealistic for COVID-19
and most other diseases. In order to bridge this gap, we estimate the model
for non-overlapping generations instead of conventional days. The length of a
generation is set equal to the mean of the generation interval, i.e.,
Dg :=

ν
X

Given the modeling assumptions we have made for COVID-19, a generation
comprises approximately 4.87 conventional days. The first 4.87 days after infection also accounts for 64% of the assumed infectiousness given by the generation
interval. This helps explain why partitioning the data into generations produces
reasonable results. When a model is defined over generations, setting ν = 1 is
equivalent to assuming that someone is equally infectious over Dg days. The
negative binomial model estimated using generations is approximately equivalent to the momentum model estimated using conventional days.
In order to account for non-integer-valued generations, consider Dg = bDg c+
Df rac , where Df rac ∈ [0, 1). For simplicity, we assume that new infections
are uniformly distributed during the day so that we may use standard data
with records of new daily cases. In order to not confuse subscripts indexing
days and generations, times in the generation model will be indicated by t̃
instead of t. Lastly, as we are interested in using the most recent data, we care
about matching the right endpoint of our time series. As such, we compute the
generations backwards from a reference day t.
Let day t be the maximal day in our data set. We define the corresponding
generation incidence, I˜t̃ , to be
bDg c−1

I˜t̃ =

X

It−s + Df rac · It−bDg c .

s=0

This is merely the sum over bDg c full days, and a proportion of the remaining
day. Infections for previous generations then sum similarly over the historical
data such that the generations form a partition of days in our data set.
As before, some mathematical details are moved to Appendix C. With
simple notational changes, however, we derive a model for generations which
looks functionally identical to (2.6), i.e.,


R
.
I˜t̃ |R, I˜t̃−1 ∼ N B I˜t̃−1 k,
k+R
This formula can then be used to forecast the cumulative incidence over several
generations as described in Appendix C. This yields a simple, closed form
approximation of the momentum model without resorting to costly Bayesian
computation methods.
3. Results
This section focuses on understanding the evolution of the reproduction number in Austria between April 1 and October 31, 2020. As the momentum model
effectively needs τ + ν observations to be fit, this is approximately as early as
estimates can be provided for Austria. Our goals are three-fold: to demonstrate
the increase in estimated variability of R due to superspreading, to provide valid
prediction intervals for new cases, and to compare to similar models without superspreading. Some results will be shown for Croatia and Czechia as well to
11

help establish the validity of our method, but the focus in on Austrian data.
Other supporting graphs for Croatia and Czechia are given in Appendix D.
An important component of estimating the reproduction number on a given
date is to account for the delay distribution between date of infection and date
of confirmation as discussed in Gostic et al. [9]. If a delay of length d occurs
between infection and confirmation, then an infection observed at time t actually
occurred on day t − d. In this case, we have a “true infection history” that is
distinct from the reported case numbers. In reality, the delay d is random.
Abbott et al. [1] estimate and sample true potential infection histories given
observed case numbers by sampling possible delays d. As our primary goal is
to understand the uncertainty in estimating R as opposed to providing best in
class predictions of R for a given date, we ignore this complication. This allows
us to take as model input the historical 7-day moving average of reported cases
and to compare methods with simple, transparent input. As a result, however,
we are not attempting to predict the number of true infections on a given date.
Instead, we are predicting the number of reported or confirmed cases on this
date. In order to highlight this, axes are explicitly labeled with “Reported
Cases” and “Confirmation Date”.
Data on the progression of COVID-19 in Austria is shown in Figure 1. This
graph includes curves for the raw infection data as reported by the European
Center for Disease Prevention and Control (Raw), the 7-day moving average
of Raw (Raw (MA)), each sampled infection history (Sampled Inf.), and the
daily median of the sampled infection histories (Sampled Inf. (M)). Observe
that the boundary of the “band” created by the sampled infection histories is
not smooth, as it is created from 1,000 distinct faded lines. Note that using
sampled infection histories effectively shifts the time series backward in time.
In order for the infection histories to approximately match the reported case
numbers, we have aligned them in time.
As mentioned in Section 2.1, we sample one million total samples of R and

of parameters and run the momentum model for a specified period of time. Our
graphs show results for the average number of new cases over the following week.
As such, they are on the scale of daily reported cases. There is no additional
smoothing of the raw data or predictions. As our input is the 7-day moving
average, our prediction is the 7-day-ahead forecast of this moving average.
In all of the following graphs, we plot predictions and intervals from three
models: the momentum model with k = 0.072, the generation model of Section
2.2 with k = 0.072, and the EpiEstim model of Cori et al. [4]. As mentioned
previously and visible in Appendix D, treating k as random within a relevant
region does not alter our results. We label the EpiEstim model “Epi*”, as
the estimates are produced directly via equation (3.1) below instead of using
the EpiEstim R package. As in Cori et al. [4], we fix a generation interval, as
opposed to taking samples of a generation interval estimated from a separate
data source as in Thompson et al. [18]. As a result, we are not comparing to the
best in class model within the EpiEstim/EpiNow framework, but with a model
of corresponding complexity to the momentum model. Other improvements to

moving average of Raw (Raw (MA)), each sampled infection history (Sampled Inf.), and the

the modeling framework could then be built on top of the momentum model as
they have been for the model of Cori et al. [4].
To estimate the model of Cori et al. [4], we estimate the parameters of the
Cori et al. [4] posterior distribution directly from the infection data:

p(Rt |I[t] ) = Gamma a +

where a and b are the shape and rate parameter of the gamma prior distribution
on R. We estimate this posterior distribution, draw one million samples for R,
and run the corresponding data generating process (1.2) for the required number
of days.
Figure 2 shows the difference between models with and without superspreading on Austrian data. In order to show a long time period, the data must be
plotted on a logarithmic scale such that the low cases in the summer months are
visible. As this distorts the plotting of prediction intervals in the same graph,
the comparison of prediction intervals is given separately by focusing attention
on the summer months between the effective end of COVID restrictions and the
start of the school year.
For reference, we marked the dates of important changes in COVID-19 restrictions in Austria as vertical, dashed lines. A complete list is available at
https://regiowiki.at (in German). The events are described in Table 1. When
comparing the events to both reported cases and the estimated reproduction

given as vertical, dashed lines and are described in Table 1. The Epi* predictions consistently
lag behind the observed values, whereas the other methods overshoot in the peaks due to
momentum. Models with superspreading produce predictions intervals 2-3 times as wide as
those without and achieve better coverage.

number in Figure 3, it is necessary to keep the delay distribution in mind; i.e.,
the effect of an intervention will not be visible in confirmed cases and thereby
the estimated reproduction number for roughly two weeks [1]. Prior to the
removal of any lockdown restrictions, reported case numbers were decaying exponentially. This is visible as a linear decrease given the logarithmic scaling of
the y-axis. The slope of this line changed substantially around the time that
Austria began to reopen in May and June. From approximately July through
the end of October, case numbers fluctuate between growing exponentially and
brief periods of relative stability. These fluctuations are not modeled and reflect both noise as well as features which we do not include in our analysis, e.g.,
common holiday periods, changes in testing, etc. Throughout this period, some
restrictions are brought back into effect without apparent substantial impact.
Lockdown measures were reinstated at the end of the plotted window of time.
While all of the prediction curves track the observed cases, there are subtle
but significant differences in behavior. If one looks closely, one can see that the
Epi* model predictions lag behind the observed 7-day moving average: it fails
to accurately estimate the rapid changes in case numbers. On the other hand,
the momentum and generation model predictions “overshoot” the peaks in the
time series. As the name suggests, there appears to be excess “momentum”
in the process around these change points, and the model anticipates cases to
continue rising as in the previous days.
The various models produce prediction intervals with drastically different
widths. Most notably, the intervals for the momentum model with k = 0.072
are much wider than those of Epi*. The generation variant of this model produces intervals which are wider still. The momentum intervals are, on average,
approximately three times as wide as those of Epi*. While the generation model
provides a computationally cheap and fast estimate, it is clear that it suffers relative to the momentum model in terms of interval length. The ratio between the
prediction interval lengths visible during the summer months is approximately
the same throughout the entire prediction period.
To assess the validity of the prediction intervals, Table 2 shows, for each
method, the proportion of true weekly new cases that fall within the prediction intervals over the prediction period. Coverage is shown for the 50% and
90% prediction intervals for the raw infection data. When cases are steadily
increasing (or decreasing) prediction intervals become narrower, and when the
behavior changes they become considerably wider. The prediction intervals of
the momentum model cover the true values during periods of growth, while
those of Epi* often fail to do so over the entire growth period. Clearly coverage
is still not exact, and all models perform worse on the Czech data (see Appendix
D). It is still notable that the momentum models provide approximate coverage
in these cases even with the inherent messiness of the COVID-19 case data.
For example, Czechia had a much higher test positivity rate than Austria and
Croatia during the majority of the prediction period, which is ignored in our
model.
As the reproduction number is unobserved, we are unable to compare our
predictions within a supervised setting as we compared our model forecasts.

Given the previous discussion though, we see that the additional variability
provided by the momentum model is needed to provide prediction intervals
with approximate coverage. Figure 3 shows the median predictions and 90%
credible intervals for R given by the momentum, generation, and Epi* models.
Intervals are, in general, asymmetric, and skewed toward higher values. The
figure clearly demonstrates that the intervals for R are drastically different:
with superspreading, intervals for R are roughly 2-3 times as wide as those
without. This could have potentially large implications for policy making as we
know that relatively small changes in the size of R can lead to large differences
in the number of new cases if the disease is allowed to progress unchecked.
Near the beginning of our estimation period and around the time when restrictions were being relaxed in Austria, it quickly becomes infeasible to claim
that the reproduction number is below 1; i.e., the credible intervals estimated
during May and June include the value 1. Beginning in July and August, however, we observe long periods with reproduction numbers significantly greater
than 1, even with our comparatively wide credible intervals. As before, there is
a delay of approximately two weeks between when these interventions occur and
any change in reproduction number could be observed. Hence any discussion of
dates should be interpreted loosely.
As we see a clear improvement in coverage for switching to a model with
superspreading, it is useful to have a clearer understanding of the degree of
heterogeneity implied by our models. To do so, we consider the posterior samples
of R from October 31, 2020. According to equation (1.4), each individual has
a separate reproduction number, rx , given the population reproduction number
R. For each posterior sample of R, we therefore draw an individual rx and
secondary infections Ix . The Epi* models of Cori et al. [4] set rx = R for all
individuals. Hence, it is possible to compare the degree of heterogeneity by
considering a Lorenz curve of the population of values of rx or Ix [14].

16

Figure 3: Credible intervals for R in Austria. The momentum and generation model predictions are consistently slightly higher than those of Epi*. They also produce credible intervals
that are 2-3 times as wide. Relevant event dates are given as vertical, dashed lines and are
described in Table 1. Observe that R becomes indistinguishable from 1 using our models
around the time when lockdown restrictions begin to be removed.

The Lorenz curve is typically used to demonstrate income inequality by
showing the proportion of overall income or wealth held by the bottom x% of the
people. Here we consider this to be “infectiousness inequality”. The distribution
of R estimated for October 31, 2020 as well as the implied Lorenz curve are
shown in Figure 4. The Lorenz curve is a representation of the cumulative
distribution function of the number of new expected infections. It allows us to
visualize the degree of heterogeneity by seeing which proportion of individuals
contribute to new infections. One can draw the Lorenz curve with Ix instead of
rx , which only results in a slightly rougher image with no qualitative differences.
While the population reproduction number is moderately high, this is largely
driven by superspreading. The momentum model implies that the top 10% of
individuals contribute 84.6% of new infections, while the top 20% contribute
98%. The usefulness of Figure 4b is that is shows this entire distribution instead
of these two common quantiles. We can clearly see that essentially no new cases
are produced by nearly 75% of infected individuals. These statistics match
quite closely the observed values reported in Arinaminpathy et al. [3]. The
figures can also be drawn for the estimation setting in which k is assumed to be
randomly drawn from an appropriate gamma distribution. The resulting graphs
look essentially identical. As such, treating k as fixed at 0.072 or fluctuating
in the approximate range [.04, .2] makes little difference in the infectiousness
inequality implied by the momentum model.

4. Conclusion
In this paper, we provide a simple extension of the Cori et al. [4] model to
account for superspreading. While we explicitly use this to model the COVID19 pandemic, the methods are easily adaptable to other diseases where superspreading is present. This “momentum” model incorporates unobserved random
variables which drive the process of new infections. Even if case numbers and
R are relatively small, the presence of superspreaders can increase the momentum of the disease beyond what would be expected if all individuals have the
same infectiousness. We observe that this appears necessary to properly track
the steep increases or decreases in reported COVID-19 cases. The momentum
model produces credible intervals and posterior predictive intervals that are approximately 2-3 times as wide as those that neglect superspreading. We find
that these wider intervals significantly improve the coverage of the prediction
intervals. The heterogeneity in infectiousness implied by the momentum model
is extremely high: 10% of individuals contribute approximately 84.6% of new
infections.
As Bayesian models are time and resource intensive to estimate, we also
derive a simplified model in which infected individuals are only infectious for a
single day. In order to improve the fit to real data, we partition disease incidence
into generations, each of which spans multiple days. The length of each generation corresponds to the generation time of the disease, and within this period
an infected person is assumed to be equally infectious. This yields two main
benefits. First, estimation of R and predictions of new cases are immediately
available through an explicit approximation of the posterior distribution of R.
Second, this model allows us to derive a simple equation to relate the width
of credible intervals to the degree of superspreading. Hence, we have rigorous
18

analysis which supports the heuristic that the approximate length of a credible
interval for R behaves like
2z1−α/2
q P
,
t
k s=t−τ +1 Is
where z1−α/2 is the (1 − α/2) quantile of the standard normal distribution and
for values of dispersion parameter k much smaller than 1, which corresponds
to scenarios with high superspreading. The model assumes that R has been
constant for the preceding τ days.

Appendix A. Likelihood Derivation
This appendix derives the posterior distribution of R and θ~[t−τ −ν+1,t−1]
given the relevant observable past, i.e., I~[t−τ −ν+1,t] . We briefly restate some
basic properties and definitions of our model.
Let wi denote the expected proportion of future infections caused by an
infected person which occur on day i after infection. Let ν denote the length
of infectiousness, i.e., wν+k = 0 for all k > 0. Lastly, τ denotes the number of
days over which we assume R is constant.
Our distributional assumptions are as follows:

We want to calculate the joint distribution:
p(θ~[t−τ −ν+1,t−1] , R|I~[t−τ −ν+1,t] )
= p(θ~[t−τ −ν+1,t−1] , R|I~[t−τ −ν+1,t−τ ] , I~[t−τ +1,t] )
∝ p(I~[t−τ +1,t] |I~[t−τ −ν+1,t−τ ] , θ~[t−τ −ν+1,t−1] , R)p(θ~[t−τ −ν+1,t−1] , R|I~[t−τ −ν+1,t−τ ] )
= p(I~[t−τ +1,t] , θ~[t−τ −ν+1,t−1] , R|I~[t−τ −ν+1,t−τ ] )
= p(It , θt−1 |I~[t−τ −ν+1,t−1] , θ~[t−τ −ν+1,t−2] , R)
·p(I~[t−τ +1,t−1] , θ~[t−τ −ν+1,t−2] , R|I~[t−τ −ν+1,t−τ ] )

In the last step we used the conditional independence properties for It and
θt−1 , respectively. Repeating this process to separate I[t−τ +2,t] and θ[t−τ +1,t−1]
from the rest yields:

become problematic. Knowledge of the terms Im for m > s certainly should
shed some insight on the value of θs ; however, it is not clear how this can be
feasibly handled. It is not possible to prevent the occurrence of such terms
due to the hierarchical nature of this model: the distribution of Is requires
previous θ values, which in return demand the inclusion of previous I values ad
infinitum. This problem could be avoided by modeling all data from the start
of the epidemic, at which point we could confidently set all values of I and θ
corresponding to times prior to the onset of the epidemic to 0. This, however,
would require treating the value of R as fixed for the entire epidemic, rendering
our approach irrelevant as this assumption is clearly false.
As a solution, we propose putting a prior distribution on these problematic
θs such that p(θs |I~[t−τ −ν+1,t−τ ] , R) ∼ Γ(Is k, k/R), essentially disregarding the
additional information provided by future observations. Using a different prior,
such as setting p(θs |I~[t−τ −ν+1,t−τ ] , R) = δRIs —which has the appeal of creating
terms such as those in Cori et al. [4]—is statistically unsound, as we would draw
different θs from different types of distributions.
All this taken together yields:
p(θ~[t−τ −ν+1,t−1] , R|I~[t−τ −ν+1,t] )

Here we summarize estimation results for simulated data in order to more
precisely show the effect of superspreading in a setting in which true parameters
are known. The coverage and length of intervals are shown in Figure B.5. All

order to asses coverage probabilities.
Of greatest initial import is verifying that the 90% credible intervals for R
indeed cover the true value with approximately nominal probability. The case
R = 1 is of primary importance, as it represents the bright-line between the
epidemic growing or shrinking. That we have nearly exact coverage in this
setting is indication that our credible intervals do not achieve coverage merely
by being extremely wide. Furthermore, the intervals for θ~ also cover the true
values with the specified probability when R = 1 or R = 1.5. With our initial
sequence of cases and R = .7, the epidemic sometimes dies out, which can be
missed by the model. As such, coverage somewhat worse in this case.
After establishing coverage, our motivation for modeling superspreading is
verified by looking at the lengths of the credible intervals: for k small, our intervals need to be extremely wide. In fact, the interval for k = .1 is approximately
2.5 times longer than the interval for k = 10 for both R = .7 and R = 1. For
R = 1.5, the estimation problem becomes relatively easy as case numbers grow
substantially. This leads to very small credible intervals.
As the explicit conditional distribution of the momentum parameters θ~ is
intractable, we present a summary of the samples observed through the MCMC
simulation in Figure B.6. This includes all 25 momentum parameters required
when τ = ν = 13 as well as R. As R = 1.5 in this setting, one can observe
that the scale increases for θs as s increases. It is clear that the parameters
vary widely through MCMC estimation, even though the are initialized at the
marginal MLE: θ̂s = Is R̂. Multiple chains are run, each with a separate initial
value for R̂. When k is small, variability in θ~ is large, requiring both tuning of
the proposal distribution and long chains to be simulated in order to overcome

high auto-correlation in the MCMC draws of θ.

to demonstrate that there is insufficient information to estimate the full set
of parameters. One can also see how quickly the parameter estimates from
different chains converge even when started a significantly different—and in
some cases completely incorrect—starting values. Depending on the value of k,
the variance of the proposal distribution for θ~ must be set in order to allow θ
to move slowly. If the variance is too high, then the acceptance proportion of
proposed parameters is extremely low. This is due to the vector jumping to a
nonsensical configuration, even if each individual θi is plausible in isolation.
As a final model validation, we consider k being drawn from a suitable
distribution instead of being fixed. By using k ∼ Gamma(6, rate=55) we achieve
approximately the same 2.5%, 50%, and 97.5% quantiles of the distribution of
k given in Endo et al. [6]. For reference, these are .04, .1, and .2, respectively.
Figure B.8 shows credible intervals for R and prediction interval lengths for the
momentum model with k = 0.072 and k random as above. Only these summary
graphs are shown because no differences are visible in the missing figures. The
only notable difference in the estimation of the reproduction number occurs
when observed cases are very low. In this region, treating k as random yields
slightly larger estimates for R as well as wider confidence intervals. Lastly,
we note that the intervals for R are not as symmetric as for the k-fixed case
as they are skewed slightly left. Furthermore, there is less heterogeneity in
infectiousness. Our models estimate that 10% of infected individuals contribute
81% of new infections while 20% contribute 95% of new infections.
Appendix C. Generation Model Derivations
Appendix C.1. Normal Approximation
This appendix derives the normal approximation to the posterior distribution p(R|I~[t] , k) used in Section 2.2. As we can iteratively condition on previous
values, the joint distribution of I~[t−τ +1,t] |I~t−τ , R, k decomposes into a product
of factors of the form (2.7). We have
p(I~[t−τ +1,t] |I~[t−τ ] , R, k) =

The structure of this likelihood suggests estimating R/(R + k) instead of R.

Given this functional form, it is natural to put a beta prior on R/(R +
k) to maintain conjugacy. For small k, as shown in Figure C.9, this corresponds to putting an appropriate inverse-gamma prior on R, while for larger
k this would correspond to a gamma prior. Therefore, to mimic the R ∼
Inv-Gamma(3.69, rate = 6.994) prior distribution used in Section 2.1, we can
use a Beta(α̃ = 98.82, β̃ = 3.74) prior on R/(R + k). The posterior distribution
of R/(R + k) then has a Beta distribution with parameters

While the hyperparameter values are not so small as to be uninformative, they
are easily outweighed by the data in most settings. By a change of variables
from R/(R + k) back to R, we derive the posterior distribution of R to be

Appendix C.2. Generation Model
It is easiest to represent the process of infections per generation if we allow
the indices of the summation notation to be real numbers (hence treating the
summation as integration) via

of infections per generation is then given simply by

We assume R is constant for τ days in the generation model as in the
momentum model. The corresponding parameter in the generation model is
τg := τ /Dg , where we account for non-integer values as before by summing
fractional daily infections. Estimating parameters and producing forecasts requires similar modifications for non-integer values. Conceptually, however, these
correspond to the same sums as before, just over generations instead of conventional days. This can be represented concisely in the notation for real-valued
summation as

In the case study of Section 3, we forecast the total weekly cases, i.e., T = 7.
Observe that this equates to merely forecasting sufficient generations to cover
the desired time period, then taking the appropriate proportion of the final
forecasted generation to match the desired time window T.
Appendix D. Results for Croatia and Czechia
As further demonstration of the momentum model, Figures D.10 and D.11
show the same prediction and estimation results as seen in Section 3 but for
Croatia and Czechia. The disease progression in Czechia is similar to that
of Austria over the shown period. Croatia is a common Austrian and Czech
29

tourist destination and the disease progression is markedly different there than
in Austria. The estimated coverage probabilities of the prediction intervals are
also shown in Table 2. The story remains the same as before: coverage is
far better for the momentum model with superpreading than without (Epi*).
Similarly, Epi* appears shifted relative to the observed cases, particularly for
the Czech data. Here we see that the momentum model performs better than
the generation model, particularly around peaks in the time series.
Figure D.11 contains results on the estimation of R for Croatia and Czechia.
The results are qualitatively the same, in that the momentum model with superspreading produces much wider credible intervals. One obvious feature of
the Croatian data, however, is a steep decline and subsequent steep increase
in June. This corresponds to a large increase and plateau in cases as seen in
Figure D.10. The Epi* model estimates that R increases to well over 2 within
a short period of time before decreasing again to previous levels. Alternatively,
in the same period, the momentum model provides a noticeably lower median
estimate but with an incredibly wide interval. Further exploration of the feature
is warranted, though it is reasonable that such a large deviation over a small
window of time should produce significantly more uncertainty in the value of
the underlying parameter, particularly when the model is estimated under the
assumption that R is constant over τ = 13 days. Within the momentum model,
such short-term deviations can be captured by an increase or decrease in disease
momentum instead of just an increase in R. On the other hand, this feature
appears to show a flaw within the generation model, as both the estimated R
and interval estimate have extreme spikes. This is likely due to the short-term
nature of the case increase and the generation model only using roughly three
generations for estimation.
