Social isolation is one of the negative consequences of a pandemic like COVID-19. Being
socially isolated and the experience of loneliness is not only experienced by older adults, but
also by younger people who live alone and cannot communicate with others or get involved
in social situations as they used to. In the absence of ‘face-to-face’ contact with a human
companion, there is a potential for robotic companions to reduce loneliness. Here, we present
results from an online study showing that a change caused by COVID-19 has affected people’s
perception of social robots, as companions, and that the feeling of loneliness can drive the
purchase of a social robot.

Social isolation is a common issue among older adults, especially those with disabilities,
and can affect health and quality of life. Lack of social support can lead to loneliness, which is
a significant public health issue 13 and is associated with multiple negative health outcomes, such
as depression

?, 15

, anxiety

16

, and an increase in cardiovascular risk

17

. While social isolation

is more common among older adults, pandemics such as COVID-19 can lead to an increase in
social isolation not only in older adults

11

, but among adults of all ages
1

7, 10

. Social isolation is

an important consequence of COVID-19, along with many other problems 10 such as an increase
in family violence 9 . As concluded by Van Bavel et al. 8 , action is required to mitigate these
devastating effects.

Since the outbreak of COVID-19, many researchers have emphasized different benefits of
using robotics and artificially intelligent systems on mitigating the associated risks. These applications included using robots for medical education 4 , managing the spread of COVID-19 in public
areas by reducing human contact, disinfecting areas, providing security

3, 6

, and helping children

to stay connected with each other 12 . We believe that another important application area is to use
social robots as human companions during a pandemic such as COVID-19. Social robots have
the potential to act as companions and reduce social isolation, and have been successful in providing care and support in many domains, such as by improving older adults’ mood

18, 19

, reducing

depression 24 , and even reducing use of medication 23 .

However, perception of the social robots has not always been positive. It might be also hard
to perceive their benefits properly, especially by those who do not have an experience of or know
anyone who has experienced loneliness and social isolation. One of the common concerns raised
by many researchers and participants alike is that social robots may replace human companions.
While this might be a valid concern, social robots can be highly beneficial if such human interaction
is prohibited, for example during COVID-19, or for older adults who might be socially isolated,
e.g., due to disabilities. In these situations the presence of social robots can be positive and effective
in reducing their loneliness and improving society’s mental wellbeing.

2

While companion robots can be beneficial to reduce loneliness, they can only succeed if
society has a positive attitude towards them. Specifically, people need to perceive the benefits of
social robots and be willing to adopt them. It is previously shown that lower social support can
increase older adults’ acceptance of social robots that are less intuitive to use. But, a lower level
of psychological well-being, such as emotional loneliness, life satisfaction, and depressive mood
can reduce acceptance, depending on the robot and how intuitive it was to use

14

. We believe

that the shift caused by COVID-19 has resulted in a higher level of attention to the consequences
of social isolation, which could have emphasized the benefits of having a companion robot (for
self or loved ones), and changed society’s perception of them. Therefore, here, we studied how
experience of social isolation due to COVID-19 has affected perception of benefits of companion
robots, and whether loneliness can affect the tendency to purchase a social robot (as an indicator
of participants’ intention to use it).

Social Robots on the Rise Post COVID-19

A questionnaire was designed and administered online during the period of social isolation of
COVID-19. The questionnaire measured different aspects of people’s experience of COVID-19
(e.g., feeling of loneliness 1 , how stressed they were, how much they followed rules, and effect of
COVID-19 on their lives), as well as their attitude towards social robots (e.g., whether their perception of social robots has changed as a result of COVID-19, their likelihood of buying social robots,
etc). Also, there is some evidence to suggest that there is a relationship between loneliness and Big
5 personality traits. Specifically, a recent meta-analysis showed a positive relationship between

3

neuroticism and loneliness, and negative relationships between loneliness and agreeableness, extroversion, conscientiousness, and openness 21 . For this reason, we also included a standard Big 5
personality assessment 2 in our questionnaire. Final data included 102 participants from Canada1
who responded to the questionnaire on Amazon Mechanical Turk and passed all the designed attention and sanity checks. The study received full Ethics clearance from the University of Waterloo’s
Research Ethics Committees.

Experiencing a change in lifestyle as a result of the pandemic (whether positive or negative)
led to a change in the perception of benefits of companion robots. This change was significantly
higher than the change reported by those whose lives were not affected by COVID-19 (see Fig. 1).
The emotional stability aspect of participants’ personality (Big 5 personality) was also a significant
predictor of the perception change, suggesting that those with a higher emotional stability score
stated a significantly larger positive shift in perception of the benefits of the companion robots
(t = 2.196, p < .05). This change in perception also significantly affected the reported likelihood
of purchasing a social robot (t = 3.945, p < .001).

Further, the experience of loneliness, along with a change in perception of the benefits of
social robots due to COVID-19, significantly and positively affected the likelihood of purchasing
a companion robot (see Table 1 and Fig. 2).

Accepting social robots as companions might also depend on their capabilities and the tasks

Participation was limited to Canada, where rules on social distancing were precisely defined and followed by the

majority of people.

ing people about tasks, events, etc. were considered as the most preferred tasks for a companion
robot, while “dancing” was preferred the least. When asked about the capabilities of the robots,
we found “not requiring any maintenance” to be one of the important elements for social robots,
and, interestingly, social capabilities such as “recognizing you”, “ability to show emotions”, and
“having a specific behaviour that one prefers” to be considered even more important than technical
soundness, such as “not making mistakes”. Thus, it indicates that participants prefer a social robot
that is robust but do not necessarily require an advanced level of rational behaviour.

Personality Traits and Adopting to COVID-19

Aside from the effects of the personality traits on perception of the companion robots, Big 5 traits
affected participants’ general attitude towards the pandemic. Extroversion significantly increased

6

being stressed as a result of COVID-19 (t = 2.519, p = .013), as reported by the participants,
while emotional stability significantly decreased participants’ stress (t = −2.369, p = .020). Interestingly, we found no effect of conscientiousness on being stressed (t = −0.117, p = .907).
Furthermore, extroversion significantly and negatively affected following the social isolation rules
(t = −2.935, p = .004), while agreeableness significantly increased following the rules (t =
3.560, p < .001). Similar to being stressed, conscientiousness did not affect how well people
follow the social isolation rules (t = 0.051, p = .959).

We also observed similar effects of Big 5 traits on participants’ loneliness level as was reported by Buecker et el. 21 : extroversion, agreeableness, and emotional stability significantly decreased loneliness. In addition, participants who had an experience similar to immigration (e.g.,
being an immigrant or having lived in another country for a long period and for a purpose other
than vacation) had a significantly higher level of loneliness.

Concluding Remarks

There has always been a debate on the benefits of using companion robots. While they are shown to
be effective in reducing loneliness, concerns such as using companion robots may lead to neglect
from family members and reduce human interactions have negatively affected society’s attitude
towards the companion robots, especially among the older adults 5 . Our results provided evidence
about a change of perception of the benefits of social robots, and suggested that any change experienced during COVID-19 (negative or positive) affected perception of companion robots, as well

7

as the likelihood of buying a companion robot. Loneliness was another important factor, which
also increased the likelihood of buying a companion robot.

It is important to emphasize that it is not our intention to promote the replacement of human
contact with social robots, but as the current pandemic is showing, social robots might play an
important part in situations where direct human contact is prohibited (e.g., during pandemics)
or impossible (e.g., for socially isolated older adults). While it was not the focus of our study,
in addition to providing social communication and assistance, robots could even provide tactile
contact for therapeutic purposes, which (while still mechanical in nature and lacking the nature of
touching a biological, sentient being) has been shown to be beneficial 22 .
