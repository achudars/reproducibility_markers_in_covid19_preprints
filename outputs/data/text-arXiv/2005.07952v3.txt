Abstract—Understanding the characteristics of public attention and sentiment is an essential
prerequisite for appropriate crisis management during adverse health events. This is even more
crucial during a pandemic such as COVID-19, as primary responsibility of risk management is
not centralized to a single institution, but distributed across society. While numerous studies
utilize Twitter data in descriptive or predictive context during COVID-19 pandemic, causal
modeling of public attention has not been investigated. In this study, we propose a causal
inference approach to discover and quantify causal relationships between pandemic
characteristics (e.g. number of infections and deaths) and Twitter activity as well as public
sentiment. Our results show that the proposed method can successfully capture the
epidemiological domain knowledge and identify variables that affect public attention and
sentiment. We believe our work contributes to the field of infodemiology by distinguishing
events that correlate with public attention from events that cause public attention.

O N 11 March 2020, Coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) was declared a pandemic by the
World Health Organization [1] and more than
30 million people have been infected by it as
of 19 September 2020 [2]. During such crises,
capturing the dissemination of information, monitoring public opinion, observing compliance to
measures, preventing disinformation, and relaying
timely information is crucial for risk communication and decision-making about public health
[3]. Previous national and global adverse health
events show that social media surveillance can be
utilized successfully for systematic monitoring of
public perception in real-time due to its instantaneous global coverage [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9].
Due to its large number of users, Twitter has
been the primary social media platform for acquiring, sharing, and spreading information during global adverse events, including the COVID19 pandemic [10]. Especially during the early

stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, millions of
posts have been tweeted in a span of couple of
weeks by users, i.e., citizens, politicians, corporations, and governmental institutions [11], [12],
[13], [14]. Consequently, numerous studies proposed and utilized Twitter as a data source for
extracting insights on public health as well as
insights on public attention during the COVID19 pandemic. Focus of these studies include content analysis [15], topic modeling [16], sentiment
analysis [17], nowcasting or forecasting of the
disease [18], early detection of the outbreak [19],
quantifying and detecting misinformation, disinformation, or conspiracies [20], and measuring
public attitude towards relevant health concepts
(e.g. social distancing or working from home)
[21].
Despite such abundance of studies on manual
or automatic analysis of social media data during
COVID-19, causal modeling of relationships be-

1

tween characteristics of the pandemic and social
media activity has not been investigated at all, as
of September 2020. While descriptive statistical
analysis (e.g. correlation, cluster, or exploratory
analysis) is beneficial for pattern and hypothesis
discovery, and standard machine learning methods are effective in predictive modeling of those
patterns, causal inference of relevant phenomena
will not be possible without causal computational modeling. Causal modeling in the context
of social media and pandemic can enable the
optimization of onset of risk communication interventions to increase dissemination of accurate
information. Similarly, it can be utilized to prevent acute propagation of negative sentiment with
timely interventions. Consequently, such causal
modeling can help risk communication policies
to shift from alerting people to reassuring them.
Furthermore, causal modeling enables simulation
of what-if scenarios to enhance disaster preparedness. Therefore, as public decision-making can
benefit from adequate assessment of public attention and correct understanding of underlying
causes affecting it, we hereby propose causal
modeling of Twitter activity.
We hypothesize that daily Twitter activity and
sentiment during the COVID-19 pandemic has a
causal relationship with the characteristics of the
pandemic as well as with certain country statistics. We propose a structural causal modeling
approach for discovering causal relationships and
quantifying likelihood of events under various
conditions (i.e. causal queries). To validate our
approach, we collect close to 1 million tweets
with location information spanning 57 days and
identify several attributes of COVID-19 pandemic
that might affect Twitter activity. We first employ
a structure learning method to automatically construct a graphical causal structure in a data-driven
manner. Then, we utilize Bayesian Networks
(BNs) to learn conditional probability distributions of daily Twitter activity (number of daily
tweets) and average public sentiment with respect
to several pandemic characteristics such as total
number of deaths and number of new infections.
Our results show that the proposed structure
discovery method can successfully capture the
epidemiological domain knowledge. Furthermore,
causal inference of daily Twitter activity with

2

cross-validation across 12 countries show that our
approach provides accurate predictions of Twitter
activity with interpretable and intuitive results.

We believe our study contributes to the field of
infodemiology by proposing causal modeling of
public attention during the crisis of COVID-19
pandemic.

GOING BEYOND CORRELATIONS
Use of observational data from social media
was proven to be beneficial in systematic monitoring of public opinion during adverse health
events [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9]. Such utilization
of large, publicly available data becomes even
more relevant during a global pandemic such as
COVID-19, as neither enough time nor a practical
way to run variety of randomized control trials
for quantifying public opinion exist. Furthermore,
as disease containment measures (e.g. lockdowns,
quarantines, and curfews), associated financial
issues (e.g. due to inability to work), and changes
in social dynamics may impact mental health
negatively [22], [23], [24], opinion surveillance
methods that do not carry the risk of further
stressing of the participants are pertinent.
Themes of previous studies that focus on
exploration of, description of, correlation of, or
predictive modeling with Twitter data during
COVID-19 pandemic include sentiment analysis
[17], [25], [26], [27], [28], public attitude/interest
measurement [21], [29], [30], [31], content analysis [32], [33], [15], [34], [35], [36], topic modeling [37], [16], [38], [39], [40], [26], [27], analysis
of misinformation, disinformation, or conspiracies [41], [20], [42], [43], [44], [45], [46], outbreak detection or disease nowcasting/forecasting
[19], [18], and more [47], [48], [49], [50], [51],
[52]. Similarly, data from other social media
channels (e.g. Weibo, Reddit, Facebook) or search
engine statistics are utilized for parallel analyses
related to COVID-19 pandemic as well [53], [54],
[55], [56], [57], [58], [59], [60], [61], [62], [63],
[64], [65], [66], [67], [68], [69]. While these
studies reveal important information and patterns,
they do not attempt to uncover or model causal
relationships between the attributes of COVID-19

pandemic and social media activity. As correlation does not imply causation (e.g. spurious correlations), the ability to identify truly causal relationships between pandemic characteristics and
public behaviour (online or not) remains crucial
for devising public policies that are more impactful. Without causal understanding, our efforts and
decisions on risk communication, public health
engagement, health intervention timing, and adjustment of resources for fighting disinformation,
fearmongering, and alarmism will stay subpar.
The task of forging causal models comes
with numerous challenges in various domains
because, typically, domain knowledge and significant amount of time from the experts is required.
For substantially complex phenomena such as
a pandemic due to a novel virus, diagnosing
causal attributions becomes even harder. Therefore, learning causal relationships automatically
from observational data has been studied in machine learning. One of the primary challenges for
this pursuit is that numerous latent variables that
we can not observe exist in real world problems.
In fact, numerous other latent variables that we
are not even aware of may exist as well. As
latent variables can induce statistical correlations
between observed variables that do not have
a causal relationship, confounding factors arise.
While this phenomenon may not exhibit a considerable problem in standard probabilistic models,
causal modeling suffers from it immensely.
Several machine learning methods are proposed for learning causal structures from observational data and some allow combination of
statistical information (learned from the data) and
domain expertise [70], [71]. Bayesian networks
are frequently utilized frameworks for learning
models once the causal structure is fixed. As
probabilistic graphical models, BNs flexibly unify
graphical models, structural equations, and counterfactual logic [72], [73], [71], [74]. A causal
BN consists of a directed acyclic graph (DAG)
in which nodes correspond to random variables
and edges correspond to direct causal influence
of one node on another [71]. This compact representation of high-dimensional probability spaces
(e.g. joint probability distributions) provides intuitive and explainable models for us. In addition,
BNs allow not only straightforward observational
computations (e.g. calculation of marginal prob-

abilities) but also interventional ones (e.g. docalculus), enabling simulations of various what-if
scenarios.

METHODS
Data

We primarily utilized two data sources for
our study, i.e., daily number of officially reported
COVID-19 infections and deaths from “COVID19 Data Repository” by the Center for Systems
Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University [2] and daily count of COVID-19 related tweets from Twitter [75]. A 57 day period
between 22 January-18 March 2020 is chosen
for this study to represent the early stages of
the pandemic when disease characteristics are
less known and public panic is elevated. We
collected 954,902 tweets that have location information from Twitter by searching for #covid19
and #coronavirus hashtags. Similar to other studies [18], [46], [20], geolocation of the tweets
is inferred either by using user geo-tagging or
geo-coding the information available in users’
profiles. Timeline of daily log-distribution of collected tweet counts among 177 countries can be
examined from Figure 1. The trend shows an
increasing prevalence of high daily number of
tweets as the pandemic spreads across the globe
with time.
We select the following 12 countries for our
causal modeling analysis: Italy, Spain, Germany,
France, Switzerland, United Kingdom, Netherlands, Norway, Austria, Belgium, Sweden, and
Denmark. These are the countries with substantial
number of reported COVID-19 cases (listed in
descending order) in Europe as of 18 March 2020,
yet still exhibiting a high diversity in terms of
the timeline of the pandemic. For instance, while
Italy located further in the pandemic timeline
due to being hit first in Europe, United Kingdom
could be considered in the very initial stages of
it for the analysis period of our study. Figure 2
depicts the cumulative number of tweet counts
alongside with that of reported infections and
deaths for the selected countries. Evident correlations between these variables can be noticed. A
sharp increase in Twitter activity is observed after
28-29 February, which corresponds to the period
of each country having at least one confirmed

Feature Selection and Engineering

In order to characterize the pandemic straightforwardly, we calculate the following six features
(attributes) from the official COVID-19 incident
statistics for each day for 12 selected countries:
(1) total number of infections up to that day (normalized by the country’s population), (2) number
of new infections (normalized by the country’s
population), (3) percentage increase in infections
(with respect to previous day), and the same three
statistics for deaths (4-5-6).
Recent epidemiological studies on COVID19 reveal the following: people over the age 65
are the primary risk group both for infection
and mortality [76], [77], [78], [79] and human-

4

to-human transmission of the virus is largely
occurring among family members or among people who co-reside [80], [81], [77]. In order to
be able to test whether our approach can capture this scientific domain knowledge or not,
we collect the following two features for each
country: (7) percentage of population over the
age of 65 [82] and (8) percentage of singleperson households [83]. Finally, as we know
that popularity of Twitter in a country and announcement of national lockdown (e.g. closing
of schools, banning of gatherings) unequivocally
affect the Twitter activity in that country, we add
(9) percentage of population using Twitter [84]
and (10) is lockdown announced? (3 day period
is encoded as Yes if government restriction is
announced [85], No otherwise) features as well.

We represent Twitter activity by simply counting
the (11) number of daily tweets (normalized by
the country’s population). We also calculate the
(12) average daily sentiment (in range [-1, 1])
of English tweets (corresponding to over 80% of
all tweets) by utilizing a pre-trained sentiment
classifier (DistilBERT [86]). We treat each day as
an observation and represent each day with these
12 attributes (n = 12) for structure learning, resulting in a feature matrix of dimensions 684×12.
684 observations come from 12 countries times
57 days.
For the purpose of increasing interpretability,
we discretize the daily numerical features by
mapping them to 2 categorical levels, namely
High or Low. Features related to the pandemic
(infections and deaths) and Twitter activity employ a cut-off value of 75th percentile and remaining numerical features employ a cut-off value
of 50th percentile (corresponding to median).
Such categorization, for instance, turns the numerical value of “population-normalized increase
in deaths of 1.7325 × 10−7 ” into a relatively
calculated category of High for a given day. Sentiment scores are mapped to Positive (≥ 0) or
Negative (< 0) as well.
Structure Learning and Causal Inference

In structure learning we would like to learn
a directed acyclic graph, G, that describes the
conditional dependencies between variables in a
given data matrix. A typical formulation of this
problem is a structural equation model (more
generally a generalized linear model) in which a
weighted adjacency matrix, W ∈ Rn×n , defines
the graph. This is essentially a parametric model
that enables operations on the continuous space of
n×n matrices instead of discrete space of DAGs.
Such formulation enables a score-based learning
of DAGs, i.e.,

min L(W )

W ∈Rn×n

subject to G(W ) ∈ DAGs

(1)

where G(W ) is the n-node graph induced by
the weighted adjacency matrix, W , and L is the
score/loss function to be minimized. Even though
the loss function is continuous, solving Equation
1 is still a non-convex, combinatorial optimization
problem as the acyclicity constraint is discrete

May/June 2020

and difficult to enforce. Note that acyclicity is
a strict requirement for causal graphs. In order
to tackle this problem efficiently, we utilize the
recently proposed NOTEARS (corresponding to
Non-combinatorial Optimization via Trace Exponential and Augmented lagRangian for Structure
learning) algorithm for structure learning [87].
NOTEARS algorithm discovers a directed
acyclic graph from the observational data by reformulating the structure learning problem as a
purely continuous optimization. This approach
differs significantly from existing work in the
field which predominantly operates on discrete
space of graphs. Re-formulation is achieved by
introducing a continuous measure of “DAGness”, h(W ), which quantifies the severity of
violations from acyclicity as W changes. Consequently, the problem formulation becomes

min L(W )

W ∈Rn×n

(2)

subject to h(W ) = 0
which enables utilization of standard numerical
solving methods and scales cubically, O(n3 ),
with the number of variables instead of exponentially as in other structure learning methods.
We have chosen the score to be the least squared
loss (can be any smooth loss function) with l1 regularization term to discover a sparse DAG and
use a gradient-based minimizer to solve Equation
2. In our context, we discover such an adjacency
matrix that the graph it defines encodes the dependencies between our features in a close-tooptimal manner (finding the global optimum is
NP-hard [88], [89]) and is a DAG. Efficiency
of this approach enables structure learning in a
scalable manner.
As NOTEARS algorithm allows incorporation of expert knowledge, we also put certain
constraints on the structure in our experiment.
These constraints correspond to prohibited causal
attributions based on simple logical assumptions,
e.g. Twitter activity on a given day can not have a
causal effect on number of deaths from COVID19 on that day. Once the structure is learned
(both by data and logical constraints), we treat
it as a causal model and learn the parameters of
a Bayesian network on it with the training data
in order to capture the conditional dependencies
between variables. During inference on test data,

probabilities of each possible state of a node with
respect to the given input data is computed from
the conditional probability distributions.
Our approach allows straightforward querying
of the model with varying observations. For instance for a given day, the probability of Twitter
activity being High, when total number of infections are Low and new deaths are High, i.e.,

Pr(Twitter Activity = H |
Total Infections = H, New Deaths = L),
(3)
can be computed by propagating the impact of
these queries through the nodes of interest. By
utilizing this property of our approach, we compute marginal probabilities for gaining further
insights on likelihoods of various events.
Essentially, we expect two observations from
our experiment. First, we expect the structure
learning algorithm to discover the causal relations
verified by domain/expert knowledge (e.g. % of
single-person households and % of 65+ people affecting infections) and common sense/elementary
algebra (e.g. new deaths affecting percentage
change in deaths). Second, we expect the calculated likelihoods from the Bayesian network
are in parallel with domain knowledge as well,
e.g. high % of people over 65 increasing the
marginal likelihood of deaths instead of decreas-

6

ing it or high % of single households (better social
isolation) decreasing the marginal likelihood of
infections instead of increasing it. Realization of
these expectations will show that the proposed
method can indeed capture causal relationships
and will increase our confidence in discovered
relationships between the pandemic attributes and
Twitter activity as well as confidence in corresponding likelihoods.
Evaluation

We validate our approach first by inspecting
whether the expected causal relationships (e.g.
domain knowledge on COVID-19) are captured
or not. Then, we infer the Twitter activity of
each day from the learned Bayesian Network.
Essentially, this corresponds to a binary classification task, i.e., predicting the Twitter activity as High or Low from the rest of the
variables. We utilize a Leave-One-Country-Out
(LOCO) cross-validation scheme in which each
fold consists of training set from 11 countries
(627 samples) and test set (57 samples) from the
remaining country. We do not perform standard kfold cross-validation as we would like to measure
the generalization performance across countries
and prevent overly optimistic results. Therefore,
we ensure that the observations from the same
country fall in the same set (either training or
test) for every fold. We evaluate the perfor-

Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic
curve (AUROC) of the cross-validation runs. For
quantifying the causal effect of characteristics
of pandemic and relevant country statistics on
Twitter activity, we report likelihoods from the
model by querying various conditions.

RESULTS
The jointly (with statistical learning from data
and user-defined logical constraints) discovered
causal model by the structure learning algorithm
can be examined from Figure 3. Different families
of attributes are colored differently for ease of
inspection: blue for COVID-19 pandemic related
variables, yellow for country-specific statistics,
green for government interventions, and red for
representing variables related to public attention
and sentiment in Twitter. Daily Twitter activity
is affected by 4 variables, namely Twitter usage
statistics of that country, new infections on that
day, new deaths on that day, and whether national lockdown is announced or not. Similarly,
4 variables affecting the average daily sentiment
in Twitter are new infections on that day, new
deaths on that day, total deaths up to that day, and
again lockdown announcements. Total number
of infections did not show any causal effect on

May/June 2020

Twitter activity or on average public sentiment.
Leave-One-Country-Out cross-validation results in terms of AUROCs can be seen in Table
1. Each row in the table corresponds to a crossvalidation fold in which the Twitter activity in that
particular country was tried to be predicted. The
Bayesian network model achieves an average AUROC score of 0.833 across countries when trying
to infer the Twitter activity from the rest of the
variables for a given day. Daily Twitter patterns
of Germany, Italy, and Sweden show very high
predictability with AUROC scores above 0.97.
United Kingdom shows the worst predictability
with an AUROC of 0.68.
Calculation of marginal probabilities for several queries are presented in Table 2. Public
attention and sentiment-related target variables
and states are set to High Twitter Activity and
Negative Sentiment.

DISCUSSION
By analyzing observational data, we attempt
to discover causal associations between national
COVID-19 patterns and Twitter activity as well
as public sentiment during the early stages of
the pandemic. Some of our findings are expected
associations such as popularity of Twitter in a
country (Twitter usage) affecting Twitter activity.

Other expected causal relationships were new
deaths affecting change in deaths and new infections affecting change in infections, due to trivial
mathematical definitions. These were captured
successfully as well. It is important to note that
no causal relationship between infection statistics
and death statistics was discovered which might
seem against intuition. This is because in this
study we treat each day as an observation in our
modeling and do not create time-lagged version
of variables. While some of our results imply
expected associations, we also observe more interesting implications that are in alignment with
recent scientific literature on COVID-19. For in-

8

stance, percentage of single-person households
affects the total number of COVID-19 infections.
Similarly, percentage of 65+ population affects
the percentage change in deaths (essentially corresponding to rate of deaths). When the queries
regarding domain knowledge are examined, we
see that low percentage of single-person households (less social isolation) and high percentage
of 65+ population increases the probability of
total infections being high when compared to
the opposite settings. This is in line with recent
scientific literature on COVID-19 transmission
characteristics [76], [80], [81], [77], [78], [79].
By inferring Twitter activity, we show the
generalization ability of causal inference across
12 countries with reasonable accuracy. Factors affecting Twitter activity and sentiment are
discussion-worthy as well. By observing correlations, Wong et al. hints that there may be a
link between announcement of new infections
and Twitter activity [17]. Our results in Figure
3 and Table 2 suggest the same with a causal
point of view. Similarly, our finding of negative
impact of declaration of government measures on
public sentiment is also in parallel with recent
research. By analyzing Chinese social media, Li
et al. show that official declaration of COVID-19
(epidemic at that time) correlates with increased
negative emotions such as anxiety, depression,
and indignation [56]. When new infections, new
deaths, total deaths are high and an announcement
of lockdown is made, Twitter activity on that day
becomes more than 6 times more likely than when
the situation is opposite (probabilities of 0.8 vs.
0.12). High number of new deaths for a given day
causes the sentiment to be much more negative
than low number of new deaths (probabilities of
0.624 vs. 0.277). Similarly, an announcement of
lockdown is causally associated with an increase
in negative sentiment in Twitter (probabilities of
0.501 vs. 0.286).
As it is important to observe the countries
that are ahead in terms of pandemic timeline
and learn the behaviour of the pandemic, it is
equally important to understand also the public
attention and sentiment characteristics from those
countries. Wise et al. show that risk perception
of people and their frequency of engagement
in protective behaviour change during the early
stages of the pandemic [90]. Inference of such

patterns in a causal manner from social media
can aid us in the pursuit of timely decisions and
suitable policy-making, and consequently, high
public engagement. After all, primary responsibility of risk management during a global pandemic is not centralized to a single institution, but
distributed across society. For example, Zhong et
al. shows that people’s adherence to COVID-19
control measures is affected by their knowledge
and attitudes towards it [91]. In that regard,
computational methods such as causal inference
and causal reasoning can help us disentangle
correlations and causation between the observed
variables of the adverse phenomenon.
In real-world scenarios, it is virtually impossible to correctly identify all the causal associations
due to presence of numerous confounding factors.
As in with all methods in machine learning,
a trade-off between false positive associations
and false negative ones exists in our approach
as well. While we rely on official COVID-19
statistics, testing and reporting methodologies as
well as policies can change during the course
of the pandemic. Furthermore, in the context of
this study, ground truth causal associations do
not exist even for a few variables, preventing
the direct measurement of performance of causal
discovery methods. We would like to emphasize
that we acknowledge these and other relevant
limitations of our study. Our study has further
limitations regarding the simplifications on our
problem formulation and data. For instance, we
do not attempt to model temporal causal relationships in this study, e.g., high deaths numbers
having an impact on the public sentiment possibly
for several following days. We have not taken into
account remarks by famous politicians, public
figures, or celebrities which may indeed impact
social media discussions. We have not incorporated “retweets” or “likes” into our models either.
We would also like emphasize that with this
study we wanted to introduce an uncomplicated
example of causal modeling perspective to social
media analysis during COVID-19.
Future work includes investigating the effect
of dynamics of the pandemic on the spreading
mechanisms of information, including relevant
health topics in Twitter and other social media.
As social media can be exploited for deliberately
creating panic and confusion [92], causal infer-

May/June 2020

ence on patterns of misinformation and disinformation propagation in Twitter will be studied as
well. Finally, country-specific models with more
granular statistics of the country and time-delayed
variables will be investigated for a longer analysis
period.

CONCLUSION
Distinguishing epidemiological events that
correlate with public attention from epidemiological events that cause public attention is crucial
for constructing impactful public health policies.
Similarly, monitoring fluctuations of public opinion becomes actionable only if causal relationships are identified. We hope our study serves
as a first example of causal inference on social
media data for increasing our understanding of
factors affecting public attention and sentiment
during COVID-19 pandemic.
