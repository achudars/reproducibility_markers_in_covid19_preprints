Abstract
The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has spread rapidly across
the world in a short period of time and with a heterogeneous pattern. Understanding the underlying temporal and spatial dynamics in the spread
of COVID-19 can result in informed and timely public health policies. In
this paper, we use a spatio-temporal stochastic model to explain the temporal and spatial variations in the daily number of new confirmed cases
in Spain, Italy and Germany from late February to mid September 2020.
Using a hierarchical Bayesian framework, we found that the temporal
trend of the epidemic in the three countries rapidly reached their peaks
and slowly started to decline at the beginning of April and then increased
and reached their second maximum in August. However decline and increase of the temporal trend seems to be sharper in Spain and smoother
in Germany. The spatial heterogeneity of the relative risk of COVID-19
in Spain is also more pronounced than Italy and Germany.

Introduction

Started from Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province, China in December 2019,
the outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has spread rapidly
across more than 200 countries, areas or territories in a short period of time
with so far over 4.4 million confirmed cases and 296 thousand confirmed deaths
(World Health Organization, 2020).
The spread of COVID-19 across and within countries has not followed a homogeneous pattern (Giuliani et al., 2020). The causes of this heterogeneity are
1

not yet clearly identified, but different countries have different levels of national
capacity based on their abilities in prevention, detection, response strategies,
enabling function, and operational readiness (Kandel et al., 2020). Besides, different countries have implemented different levels of rigorous quarantine and
control measures to prevent and contain the epidemic, which affect the population movement and hence the spread pattern of COVID-19. Given the highly
contagious nature of COVID-19, the spatial pattern of the spread of the disease
changes rapidly over time. Thus, understanding the spatio-temporal dynamics
of the spread of COVID-19 in different countries is undoubtedly critical.
The spatial or geographical distribution of relative location of incidence (new
cases) of COVID-19 in a country is important in the analyses of the disease risk
across the country. In disease mapping studies, the spatial domain of interest
is partitioned into a number of contiguous smaller areas, usually defined by
administrative divisions such as provinces, counties, municipalities, towns or
census tracts, and the aim of the study is to estimate the relative risk of each
area at different times (Lee, 2011; Lawson, 2018). Spatio-temporal models are
then required to explain and predict the evolution of incidence and risk of the
disease in both space and time simultaneously (Anderson and Ryan, 2017).
Estimation of area-specific risks over time provides information on the disease burden in specific areas and identifies areas with elevated risk levels (hot
spots). In addition, identifying the changes in the spatial patterns of the disease risk over time may result in detecting either regional or global trends,
and contributes to make informed and timely public health resource allocation
(Wakefield, 2007).
To account for the underlying temporal and spatial autocorrelation structure
in the spread of COVID-19, available data on the daily number of new cases and
deaths in different countries/regions have already been analyzed in a considerable number of studies. For example, Kang et al. (2020) used Moran’s I spatial
statistic with various definitions of neighbors and observed a significant spatial
association of COVID-19 in daily number of new cases in provinces of mainland China. Gayawan et al. (2020) used a zero-inflated Poisson model for the
daily number of new COVID-19 cases in the African continent and found that
the pandemic varies geographically across Africa with notable high incidence
in neighboring countries. Briz-Redón and Serrano-Aroca (2020) conducted a
spatio-temporal analysis for exploring the effect of daily temperature on the accumulated number of COVID-19 cases in the provinces of Spain. They found no
evidence suggesting a relationship between the temperature and the prevalence
of COVID-19 in Spain. Gross et al. (2020) studied the spatio-temporal spread of
COVID-19 in China and compare it to other global regions and concluded that
human mobility/migration from Hubei and the spread of COVID-19 are highly
related. Danon et al. (2020) combined 2011 census data to capture population
sizes and population movement in England and Wales with parameter estimates
from the outbreak in China and found that the COVID-19 outbreak is going to
peak around 4 months after the start of person-to-person transmission. Using
linear regression, multilayer perceptron and vector autoregression, Sujath et al.
(2020) modeled and forecasted the spread of COVID-19 cases in India.

As pointed out in Alamo et al. (2020), there are many national and international organizations that provide open data on the number of confirmed cases
and deaths. However, these data often suffer from incompleteness and inaccuracy, which are considerable limitations for any analyses and modeling conducted on the available data on COVID-19 (Langousis and Carsteanu, 2020).
We highlight that we are yet in the center of the pandemic crisis and due to the
public health problem, and also to the severe economical situation, we do not
have access to all sources of data. Thus reseachers know only a portion of all the
elements related to COVID-19. In addition, data on many relevant variables
such as population movement and interaction and the impact of quarantine and
social distancing policies are not either available or accurately measured. Combined with the unknown nature of the new COVID-19 virus, any analysis such
as the present study only provides an approximate and imprecise description of
the underlying spatio-temporal dynamic of the pandemic. Nevertheless, having
a vague idea is better than having no idea, and the results should be interpreted
with caution.
Currently, a wealth of studies have appeared in the very recent literature.
Many of them follow the compartmental models in epidemiology, partition the
population into subpopulations (compartments) of susceptible (S), exposed (E),
infectious (I) and recovered (R), and fit several variations of the classical deterministic SIR and SEIR epidemiological models (Peng et al., 2020; Roda et al.,
2020; Bastos and Cajueiro, 2020). We believe that considering stochastic components is important, if not essential, to explain the complexity and heterogeneity
of the spread of COVID-19 over time and space. For this reason, in the present
work we propose a spatio-temporal stochastic modeling approach that is able to
account for the spatial, temporal and interactions effects, together with possible
deterministic covariates.
We acknowledge that the proposed model in its current form requires development and refinements as more information becomes available, but at the stage
of the pandemic we are now, it can provide a reasonable modeling framework
for the spatio-temporal spread of COVID-19. This is illustrated by modeling
the daily number of new confirmed cases in Spain, Italy and Germany from
late February to mid August 2020. The R code for implementing the proposed
model can be made available upon request. We also provide a Shiny web application (Chang et al., 2020) based on the model discussed in this paper at
https://ajalilian.shinyapps.io/shinyapp/.
The structure of the paper is the following. The open data resources used in
this study are introduced in Section 2. A model for the daily number of regional
cases is considered in Section 3. As described in Section 4, this model explains
the spatio-temporal variations in the relative risk of each country in terms of a
number of temporal, spatial and spatio-temporal random effects. The results of
fitting the considered model to the number of daily confirmed cases in Spain,
Italy and Germany are given in Section 5. The paper concludes in Section 6
with a few last remarks.

Data on the daily number of COVID-19 cases

Governmental and non-governmental organizations across the world are collecting and reporting regional, national and global data on the daily number of
confirmed cases, deaths and recovered patients and provide open data resources.
Incompleteness, inconsistency, inaccuracy and ambiguity of these open data are
among limitations of any analysis, modeling and forecasting based on the data
(Alamo et al., 2020). Particularly, the number of cases mainly consist of cases
confirmed by a laboratory test and do not include infected asymptomatic cases
and infected symptomatic cases without a positive laboratory test.
In this study, we focus on the daily number of confirmed cases in Spain, Italy
and Germany and used the following open data resources.
Spain: DATADISTA, a Spanish digital communication medium that extracts
the data on confirmed cases (PCR and antibody test) registered by the Autonomous Communities of Spain and published by the Ministry of Health
and the Carlos III Health Institute. DATADISTA makes the data available
in an accessible format at the GitHub repository https://github.com/
datadista/datasets/tree/master/COVID%2019. The daily accumulated
number of total confirmed cases registered in the 19 Autonomous Communities of Spain are updated by DATADISTA on a daily bases.
Italy: Data on the daily accumulated number of confirmed cases in the 20
regions of Italy are reported by the Civil Protection Department (Dipartimento della Protezione Civile), a national organization in Italy that deals
with the prediction, prevention and management of emergency events.
These data are available at the GitHub repository https://github.com/
pcm-dpc/COVID-19 and are being constantly updated every day at 18:00.
Germany: The Robert Koch Institute, a federal government agency and research institute responsible for disease control and prevention, collects
data and publishes official daily situation reports on COVID-19 in Germany. Data on the daily accumulated number of confirmed cases in the
16 federal states of Germany extracted from the situation reports of the
Robert Koch Institute are available at the GitHub repository https:
//github.com/jgehrcke/covid-19-germany-gae and are being updated
on a daily basis.
Table 1 summarizes the number of regions, study period and country-wide
daily incidence rate of the data for each country.
Data on distribution population of the considered countries are extracted
from the Gridded Population of the World, Version 4 (GPWv4), which provides estimates of the number of persons per pixel (1 degree resolution) for the
year 2020 (Center International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN)
Columbia University, 2018). These data are consistent with national censuses
and population registers.

Modeling daily regional counts

Suppose that a country, the spatial domain of interest, is partitioned into regions A1 , . . . , Am , defined by administrative divisions such as states, provinces,
counties, etc (see Table 1). Let Yit denote the number of new COVID-19 cases
in region Ai , i = 1, . . . , m, at time (day) t = 1, . . . , T and Eit = E[Yit ] be the
expected number of new COVID-19 cases in region Ai at time t.

3.1

The null model of homogeneous incidence rates

The expected number of new cases is given by Eit = Pi %it , where Pi is the
population of region Ai and %it is the incidence rate of COVID-19 in region Ai
at time t. Under the null model of spatial and temporal homogeneity of the
incidence rate %it = %0 and
bit = Pi %b0 ,
E
(1)
provides an estimate for Eit , where
%b0 =

T Pm
1 X i=1 Yit
Pm
T t=1
i=1 Pi

is an estimate of the country-wide homogeneous daily incidence rate (Waller
et al., 1997). The estimated daily incidence rate per million population (106 %b0 )
so far is around 68, 46 and 29 for Spain, Italy and Germany, respectively (see
Table 1).

3.2

Distribution of daily regional counts

Consul and Jain (1973) introduced a generalization of the Poisson distribution,
which is a suitable model to most unimodal or reverse J-shaped counting distributions. Given nonnegative random rates Λit , i = 1, . . . , m, t = 1, . . . , T , we
assume that Yit ’s are independent random variables following the generalized
Poisson distribution with
P(Yit = yit |Λit , ϕ, α) = exp (−Ωit − Ψit yit )

.

Thus ϕ is the dispersion parameter and the case ϕ = 0 represents the ordinary
Poisson distribution (no dispersion) with
P (Yit = yit |Λit ) = exp (−Λit )

Λyitit

yit !

yit = 0, 1, . . . .

Here, parameter α controls the shape (power) of the relation between the conditional variance of Yit |Λit and its conditional mean. For example, the relation
between Var(Yit |Λit ) and E[Yit |Λit ] is linear if α = 1 and cubic if α = 2 (Zamani
and Ismail, 2012).

Modeling relative risks

The underlying random rates Λit , i = 1, . . . , m, t = 1, . . . , T , account for the
extra variability (overdispersion), which may represent unmeasured confounders
and model misspecification (Wakefield, 2007). Variations of the random rate Λit
relative to the expected number of cases Eit provide useful information about
the spatio-temporal risk of COVID-19 in the whole spatial domain of interest
during the study period.

4.1

Relative risks

In disease mapping literature, the nonnegative random quantities
θit =

E[Yit |Λit ]
Λit
=
,
E[Yit ]
Eit

i = 1, . . . , m,

are called the area-specific relative risks at time t (Lawson, 2018, Section 5.1.4).
Obviously Eθit = 1 and
Cov(θit , θi0 t0 ) =

Cov(Λit , Λi0 t0 )
,
Eit Ei0 t0

which means that the temporal and spatial correlation structure of the underlying random rates Λit determine the spatio-temporal correlations between θit ’s.

By ignoring these correlations, the standardized incidence ratio θbit = Yit /E
provides a naive estimate for the relative risks (Lee, 2011). However, in a
model-based approach the variations of the relative risks are often related to
regional and/or temporal observed covariates and the correlation between θit ’s
are explained in terms of regional and/or temporal random effects using, for
example, a log linear model (Wakefield, 2007; Lee, 2011; Lawson, 2018).

4.2

A model for relative risks

In the present study, we consider the log linear model
θit = exp (µ + βdi + ηit ) ,

(2)

where µ is the intercept and di is the population density of region Ai , i.e. the
population of Ai , Pi , divided by the area of Ai . The population density is
standardized to have mean 0 and variance 1 and β is its regression coefficient.
Moreover, ηit is a zero mean random effect which represents spatio-temporal
variations in relative risks due to temporal and spatial trend and correlation.
Among many different possibilities, we assume that ηit takes the additive form
ηit = δt + εt + ζi + ξi

(3)

where δi represents the temporal trend, εt accounts for temporal correlation and
ζi and ξi explain spatial correlation due to spatial distance and neighborhood
relations among regions A1 , . . . , Am , respectively (see Table 2).
The latent (stochastic) temporal trend δt is expected to be a smooth function
of t. Since the second order random walk (RW2) model is appropriate for
representing smooth curves (Fahrmeir and Kneib, 2008), δ = (δ1 , . . . , δT ) is
assumed to follow a RW2 model, i.e.,
∆2 δt+1 = δt+1 − 2δt + δt−1 = t ,

t = 2, . . . , T − 1,

where 2 , . . . , T −1 are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) zero mean
Gaussian random variables with variance 1/τδ . Here the precision parameter
τδ > 0 acts as a smoothing parameter enforcing small or allowing for large
variations in δt (Fahrmeir and Kneib, 2008).
To account for temporal correlation, we assume that εt follows a stationary
autoregressive model of order 2, AR(2); i.e.,
εt = ψ1 (1 − ψ2 )εt−1 + ψ2 εt−2 + 0t ,
7

t = 2, . . . , T,

where −1 < ψ1 < 1 and −1 < ψ2 < 1 are the first and second partial autocorrelations of εt and 02 , . . . , 0T are i.i.d. zero mean Gaussian random variables with
variance 1/τε .
On the other hand, to account for spatial correlation, we assume that ζ =
(ζ1 , . . . , ζm ) follows a Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF). More specifically,
we assume that ζ is a zero mean Gaussian random vector with the structured
covariance matrix

where Im is the m × m identity matrix, 0 ≤ ω < 1 and emax is the largest
eigenvalue of the m × m symmetric positive definite matrix C = [Cii0 ]. The
entry Cii0 of matrix C represents to what extend the regions Ai and Ai0 are
interconnected. For example, Cii0 can be related to a data on commuting or
population movement between regions Ai and Ai0 . In absence of most recent
and reliable movement data between the regions of Spain, Italy and Germany,
we set Cii0 to be the Euclidean distance between the centroids of Ai and Ai0 .
In addition to interconnectivity and correlations due to spatial distance, the
neighbourhood structure of regions A1 , . . . , Am may induce spatial correlation
among relative risks of regions because neighbouring regions often tend to have
similar relative risks. To include spatial correlation due to neighborhood structure of regions in the model, we assume that ξ = (ξ1 , . . . , ξm ) follows a scaled
version of the Besag-York-Mollié (BYM) model (Besag et al., 1991); i.e., ξ is a
zero mean Gaussian random vector with (Riebler et al., 2016)

Prior specification and implementation

In a Bayesian framework, it is necessary to specify prior distributions for all unknown parameters of the considered model. The Gaussian prior with mean zero
and variance 106 is considered as a non-informative prior for the dispersion parameter of generalized Poisson distribution, log ϕ, and for the parameters of the

Since all random effects of the model are Gaussian, the integrated nested
Laplace approximation (INLA) method (Rue et al., 2009) can be used for deterministic fast approximation of posterior probability distributions of the model
parameters and latent random effects (Martins et al., 2013; Lindgren et al.,
2015). The R-INLA package, an R interface to the INLA program and available
at www.r-inla.org, is used for the implementation of the Bayesian computations in the present work. The R code can be made available upon request. The
initial values for all parameters in the INLA numerical computations are set to
be the mean of their corresponding prior distribution. The initial value of α is
chosen to be one (see Table 3).

4.4

Bayesian model posterior predictive checks

For count data Yit and in a Bayesian framework, a probabilistic forecast is a
posterior predictive distribution on Z+ . It is expected to generate values that
are consistent with the observations (calibration) and concentrated around their
means (sharpness) as much as possible (Czado et al., 2009). Following a leave-

be the event of observing all count values except the one for region Ai at time t.
Dawid (1984) proposed the cross-validated probability integral transform (PIT)

PITit (yit ) = P Yit ≤ yit B−(it)
for calibration checks. Thus, PITit is simply the value that the predictive distribution function of Yit attains at the observation point yit . The conditional
predictive ordinate (CPO)

CPOit (yit ) = P Yit = yit B−(it)
is another Bayesian model diagnostic. Small values of CPOit (yit ) indicate possible outliers, high-leverage and influential observations (Pettit, 1990).
For count data, Czado et al. (2009) suggested a nonrandomized yet uniform
version of the PIT with


tendencies of the predictive distributions are biased, the histograms are skewed.

Results

Table 4 presents the Bayesian estimates (posterior means) for every parameter
of the considered model fitted to the daily number of new COVID-19 cases in
Spain, Italy and Germany. The corresponding 95% credible intervals of the
model parameters are also reported in parentheses.
Comparing the estimated parameters among different countries, it can be
seen that the dispersion parameter ϕ of the generalized Poisson distribution for
Italy is higher than Spain and Germany, but its shape parameter α is around 1.5
for the three countries, which implies that the variance of the daily counts in each
region is approximately a quadratic function of their mean. The coefficient of
the population density is not significantly different from zero for Spain and Italy,
but is positive for Germany which indicates that regions with higher population

11

density have larger relative risks.
The precision parameters of the temporal random effects imply that the
temporal trend δt has at least 35 times larger contribution (smaller precision)
than εt which represents temporal correlation. The opposite signs of ψ1 and
ψ2 indicate rough oscillations in εt . The spatial random effect ζi has larger
contribution (smaller precision) than ξi in the total variations of the relative
risks only in Spain, while for Italy and Germany it is the opposite. This could
be a result of large Euclidean distance between Spain continental European
territory from two archipelagos territories, which is affecting the considered
covariance structure of ζi .
In summary, the higher contribution (lower precision) in the total variations
of the relative risks for Spain, Italy and Germany is due to the temporal trend,
spatial correlation and finally temporal correlation, respectively. This may hint
that spatial correlations have a greater impact on the relative risks of COVID-19
than temporal correlations.
The Bayesian estimates and 95% credible intervals for the temporal trend
δt , t = 1, . . . , T , are shown in Figure 1. These plots can be interpreted as a
smoothed temporal trend of the relative risk in the whole country. In fact,
Figure 1 suggests that the COVID-19 epidemic in all three countries rapidly
reached their peaks and slowly started to decline at the beginning of April and
then increased and reached its maximum in August. In addition, the second
wave of the epidemic seems to be stronger in Spain and Germany shows a more
smoother trend during the study period.
Figure 2 shows the the posterior means of the spatial random effects ζi
and ξi , i = 1, . . . , m, on the corresponding map of each country. The plot
illustrates spatial heterogeneity of the relative risk of COVID-19 across regions
in each country, particularly in Spain. Regions with positive (negative) ζi + ξi
values are expected to have elevated (lower) relative risks than the the baseline
country-wide risk during the study period.
In order to see how the estimated relative risks under the fitted model are
in agreement with the observed
data, Figure 3 shows the spatially accumulated

country.
Finally, histograms of the normalized PIT values described in Section 4.4
are obtained using J = 20 from the fitted models and plotted in Figure 4.
The normalized PIT values for the fitted models to data do not show a clear
visible pattern and the histograms seems to be close to the standard uniform
distribution.

the fitted model are also provided in an interactive Shiny web application at

Concluding remarks

There are some limitations in the analyses and modeling of data on the number of new cases of COVID-19, including data incompleteness and inaccuracy,
unavailability or inaccuracy of relevant variables such as population movement
and interaction, as well as the unknown nature of the new COVID-19 virus.
Nevertheless, understanding the underlying spatial and temporal dynamics of
the spread of COVID-19 can result in detecting regional or global trends and
to further make informed and timely public health policies such as resource
allocation.
In this study, we used a spatio-temporal model to explain the spatial and
temporal variations of the relative risk of the disease in Spain, Italy and Germany. Despite data limitations and the complexity and uncertainty in the spread
of COVID-19, the model was able to grasp the temporal and spatial trends in the
data. However, the posterior predictive checks using the normalized probability
integral transform (PIT) showed that there is room for the model improvements.
Obliviously, there are many relevant information and covariates that can be
considered in our modeling framework and improve the model’s predictive capabilities. One good possibility would be considering most recent and accurate
human mobility amongst regions. We would expect our model would benefit
from this information, which right now can not be accessed. Moreover, the
considered spatio-temporal model in this paper is one instance among many
possibilities. For example, one possibility is to include a random effect term in
the model that represents variations due to joint spatio-temporal correlations;
e.g., a separable sptaio-temporal covariance structure. However, the considered model was adequate and no joint spatio-temporal random effect term was
considered to avoid increasing the model’s complexity.
We focused here on a stochastic spatio-temporal model as a good alternative
to existing deterministic compartmental models in epidemiology to explain the
spatio-temporal dynamics in the spread of COVID-19. However, it should be
emphasized that one step forward would be considering a combination of a
deterministic compartmental model in terms of differential equations for the
number of susceptible, exposed, infectious and recovered cases with our sort of
stochastic modeling approach. This is a clear novelty and a direction for future
research.
