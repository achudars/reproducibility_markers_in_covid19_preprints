Abstraction
Purpose: Early detection and diagnosis of Covid-19 and accurate separation of patients with
non-Covid-19 cases at the lowest cost and in the early stages of the disease is one of the main
challenges in the epidemic of Covid-19. Concerning the novelty of the disease, the diagnostic
methods based on radiological images suffer shortcomings despite their many uses in diagnostic
centers. Accordingly, medical and computer researchers tended to use machine-learning models
to analyze radiology images.

Methods: Present systematic review was conducted by searching three databases of PubMed,
Scopus, and Web of Science from November 1, 2019, to July 20, 2020 Based on a search strategy,
the keywords was “Covid-19, “Deep learning”, “Diagnosis”, and “Detection” leading to the
extraction of 168 articles that ultimately, 37 articles were selected as the research population by
applying inclusion and exclusion criteria.

Result: This review study provides an overview of the current state of all models for the detection
and diagnosis of Covid-19 through radiology modalities and their processing based on deep
learning. According to the finding, Deep learning Based models have an extraordinary capacity to
achieve an accurate and efficient system for the detection and diagnosis of Covid-19, which using
of them in the processing of CT-Scan and X-Ray images, would lead to a significant increase in
sensitivity and specificity values.

Conclusion:The Application of Deep Learning (DL) in the field of Covid-19 radiologic images
processing leads to the reduction of false-positive and negative errors in the detection and
diagnosis of this disease and provides an optimal opportunity to provide fast, cheap, and safe
diagnostic services to patients.

1. Introduction
With the outbreak of an unknown disease in late 2019 in China, some people became infected with the
disease in a local market. Patients were admitted to hospitals with abnormal symptoms, such as fever above
38 degrees, infection, dizziness, muscle aches, and shortness of breath, and cough. Due to respiratory
problems and low blood oxygen levels, these people were transferred to intensive care units and many of
them lost their lives. The disease was initially completely unknown, but specialists diagnosed the symptoms
of the disease as something similar to those of Corona and the flu. The specific cause of this widespread
disease was initially unknown, but after laboratory examination and analysis of positive sputum by RealTime PCR test, viral infection was confirmed and was eventually named Covid-19 by the recommendation
of the World Health Organization. This disease was named Covid-2019 with regard to the family of Corona
diseases and the year 2019 [1,2] Over a short period, the Covid-19 epidemic crossed geographical
boundaries with a devastating effect on the health, economy, and welfare of the global population.
According to the reports of the World Health Organization, Covid-19 showed its severity in 16 to 21% of
the patients with 2 to 3% of death [3]. Local statistics in many countries indicate a high mortality rate among
patients, and some studies have calculated the mortality rate at 4% [4]. Concerning the novelty of the
disease, ways to fight it were not known in the early days, but researchers consider screening and rapid
diagnosis of infected patients and their separation from the community of healthy people as an important
step in fighting against this disease. Clinical features of Covid-19 include respiratory symptoms, fever,
cough, shortness of breath, and pneumonia. However, these symptoms do not always indicate Covid-19
and are observed in many cases of pneumonia, leading to diagnostic problems for physicians [5, 6].
According to the latest protocol for the diagnosis and treatment of pneumonia infections caused by Covid19 (Sixth Edition) published by the Government of China, the main screening method used to diagnose
Covid-19 cases is the reverse transcriptional polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test that can distinguish
Covid-19 from respiratory diseases and other lung infections [7]. While the RT-PCR test is the gold
standard for diagnosing Covid-19, it has limiting aspects with special features that make it difficult to
diagnose the diseases. RT-PCR is a very time consuming and complex manual process and Covid-19
diagnosis processes through this method are very costly and time-consuming. The use of diagnostic test
requires equipped facilities and laboratories that do not exist even in many developed countries. One of the
drawbacks of this method is the need for a laboratory kit, that the provision of which is difficult and
impossible for many countries during crises and epidemics. Besides, the provision of diagnostic kits is
difficult and impossible for many countries, because it imposes a huge financial burden on their health
systems. Like all diagnostic and laboratory methods in health care systems, this method is not error-free
and has bias and error. This diagnostic method requires an expert laboratory technician to sample the nasal
and throat mucosa which is a painful method and many people refuse to do nasal swap sampling for this
reason [8-11]. Most importantly, many studies indicated the low rate of the sensitivity of the RT-PCR test,
and a number of studies have reported the sensitivity of this method of diagnosis between 30% to 60%,
indicating a decrease in the accuracy of the diagnosis of Covid-19 in many cases. Several study these studies
pointed to the false-negative rate and contradictory results of this diagnostic test [11-14].

1.1.

Detection and Diagnosis of Covid-19 Using Radiology Modality
2

One of the most important ways to diagnose Covid-19 is to use radiological images. X-ray imaging and
CT-Scan are the main screening methods for identification of Covid-19. Radiologists look for visual
indicators of lung infection by examining the images. Chest imaging is a quick and easy procedure
recommended by medical and health protocols. Chest imaging has been mentioned in several texts as the
first tool in screening for disease in epidemics [3, 6, 15].
CT-Scan images compared to RT-PCR have high sensitivity in diagnosing and detecting cases with Covid19, however, its specificity is less [16]. This means that CT-Scan is more accurate in cases of Covid-19,
but less accurate in cases of non-viral pneumonia. In most recorded cases, the sensitivity and specificity of
the CT-Scan test in diagnosing Covid-19 are higher than 94% and less than 60%, respectively, which can
lead to problems in diagnosing Covid-19. A study conducted on the diagnosis of patients in Wuhan, China
showed that consolidation and ground-glass opacities (GGO) were not observed in CT-Scan imaging in
14% of the images, meaning that 14% of the definitive cases of Covid-19 were misdiagnosed as completely
healthy and normal based on their CT-Scan tests. Out of 18 patients with Covid-19 who had GGO with
Consolidation, only 12 had GGO and as a result, no consolidation and disease were observed. Despite the
presence of consolidation without the advent of GGO in many cases, it was difficult and almost impossible
to detect Covid-19. All these cases indicated a defect in the diagnosis of Covid-9 using CT-Scan. [16-20].
The American College of Radiology recommends that CT-Scans should not be used as the first line of
diagnosis. Problems such as the risk of transmission of the disease while using a CT-Scan device and its
high cost can cause serious complications for the patient and health care systems, so it recommends that in
the first step if medical imaging is needed, replace the CT-Scan with CXR radiography [21]. One of the
methods of imaging diseases is CXR. Various studies have indicated the failure of CXR imaging to
diagnosing Covid-19 and differentiating it from other types of pneumonia. The radiologist cannot use Xrays to detect pleural effusion and determine the volume involved [20]. However, regardless of the low
accuracy of X-ray diagnosing Covid-19, it has some positive points:
X-ray imaging is much more extensive and cost-effective than conventional diagnostic tests. Transmission
of an X-ray digital image does not require transferring from the access point to the analysis point, so it
performs the diagnostic process very quickly. Chest radiography is convenient and fast for medical triage
of patients [20]. Unlike CT-Scans, X-ray imaging requires less additional Scarce and valuable equipment,
so significant savings can be made in the running costs. Furthermore, portable CXR devices can be used in
isolated rooms, to reduce the risk of infection resulted from the use of these devices in hospitals [13, 20].
To overcome the limitations of Covid-19 diagnostic tests using radiological images, various studies have
been performed on the use of machine learning and computer-Based methods in the analysis of radiological
images. Due to the existing problems in diagnosis and interpreting of radiological images of Covid-19,
numerous studies have focused on the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning in the interpretation
of radiological images. Machine learning methods, although successful in processing disease data, have
their drawbacks in diagnosing diseases through images. One of these drawbacks was the selection and
extraction of features by users and their suggested methods. In which a number of features were ignoring
or many effective features were in the detection process less involving.
Artificial Intelligence includes random forest methods, support vector machine, nearest neighborhood, and
artificial neural network, all of which use computational methods and artificial intelligence to select the
features.
In the case of images dealing with large volumes of data, the usual methods of artificial intelligence do
not have the necessary efficiency because the input of images is applied to the pixel by pixel, an increase
in the number of pixels, its parameters significantly increase, which would impose problems, such as
3

over-fitting, pre-processing and reduction of networks speed in processing [22, 23]. Therefore, traditional
machine learning methods were not efficient in diagnosing Covid-19 by radiological images.

1.2. Deep Learning
In 2006, Hinton and Salkhudinoy published an article in Science Journal that was a gateway to the age of
deep learning. Hinton showed that the neural network with hidden layers played a great role in increasing
the learning power of features. Therefore, these algorithms are able to increase the accuracy of classifying
different types of data. Therefore, this field of artificial intelligence has achieved extraordinary success in
medical image processing [23, 24]. Deep learning covered the disadvantages of conventional machine
learning methods and revolutionized the selection and extraction of features. One of the major applications
of deep learning in radiology practices was the detection of tissue-skeletal abnormalities and the
classification of diseases. The Convolutional neural network has proven to be one of the most important
deep learning algorithms as the most effective technique in detecting abnormalities and pathology of chest
radiographs [25-27]. Since the outbreak of Covid-19, much research has been conducted on processing the
related data to deep learning algorithms, especially CNN. Using different algorithms and deep learning
architectures, these studies have embarked on the identification and differential diagnosis of Covid-19. In
this study, these studies have been systematically analyzed.

2. Methodology
This study was accomplished by a structured review method to identify studies related to the
identification and diagnosis of Covid-19. A Systematic search strategy was performed by using previous
studies and the author’s opinions.

2.1. Search Criteria
1) To what extent has the use of deep learning been able to improve the usual methods of diagnosing
Covid-19?
2) What modalities can be used to help identify and diagnose Covid-19 by using deep learning?
3) Has deep learning been able to cover the shortcomings of diagnostic modalities?
4) What is the efficacy of different types of deep learning and its architectures in promoting the diagnosis
of Covid-19 compared to each other?
The researchers reviewed the electronic databases to identify studies on medicine and computer sciences
and concluded that PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases have the highest number of
publications related to the current study. The following key terms were used as the search strategy:
“Covid-19”, “diagnosis”, “detection” and “deep learning” from November 1, 2019, to July 20, 2020, and
related published studies were extracted from the three databases. The EMBASE and IEEE databases
were removed from the search domain due to the proximity of their publications.

3.1) Purpose of Deep learning in
analysis Radiology Images about
Covid-19

Image-based diagnostic methods in epidemics play a key role in the screening of affected cases. CXR and
CT-Scan are among the main radiology modalities in the detection and diagnosis of Covid-19. In all the
studies reviewed in this study, radiological images have been analyzed to diagnose Covid-19 with deep
learning. This study has been conducted around two common terms, i.e. “detection” and “diagnosis” to
characterize the presence of Covid-19. Collins Dictionary defines the terms “detection” and “diagnosis”
differently from the medical point of view. However, in the field of medical image analysis, these two terms
have been used repeatedly for the same purpose. By examining the existing texts and dictionaries and
seeking advice from radiologists and epidemiologists, detection is part of the real entity that can be seen or
its existence can be proved or disproved.
In medical texts, detection is considered as a prelude to diagnosis. Similarly, in the case of Covid-19, many
studies have used these two words interchangeably, which are clinically different from each other. By
distinguishing between these two terms in this study, detection has been considered as the distinguishing
cases infected with Covid-19 from non-Covid-19. This means that no information is available on the type

of the disease in non-Covid-19 patients, and this group can have different types of bacterial pneumonia,
viral, or other groups of coronavirus diseases with the exception of Covid-19. We also considered diagnosis
as a term to distinguish Covid-19 from other infectious lung diseases such as different types of pneumonia.
Diagnosis is meaningful in categories where the rest of the diseases, not infected with Covid-19, are well
specified, and Covid-19 can be distinguished with certainty from types of pneumonia or other
coronaviruses. In this regard, by examining the articles extracted in this study, it was found that 15 articles
had used deep learning to detect (identify)
Covid-19 [28-42]. On the other hand,
many articles have diagnosed Covid-19
with deep learning algorithms [43-59]. In
these cases, Covid-19 was accurately
diagnosed among the different types of
pneumonia. Some studies have analyzed
radiology modalities to detect and
diagnose it simultaneously [39, 60].
Figure (2) shows studies on the detection
and diagnosis of Covid-19.
Figure 2: Research methods for detection and diagnosis of Covid-19 by means of deep learning

It has already been said that one of the
diagnostic disadvantages of CT-Scan images in identification cases of Covid-19 its low specificity.
Accordingly, the investigation has shown many studies conducted to improve these methods in the analysis
of CT-Scan images with deep learning techniques [28, 29, 33-35, 40, 46, 49, 50, 52, 61-65]. Apparently,
these methods owe their success in finding pulmonary lesion caused by Covid-19 to the extraction and
selection of features hidden in the images. Despite the improvement in the detection and diagnosis of Covid19 by deep learning algorithms, one of the biggest drawbacks of this modality in the diagnosis of Covid-19
was the lack of this equipment in all medical and diagnostic centers. Furthermore, many patients with
Covid-19 required multiple chest images using CT-Scans. Exposure to radiation during CT-Scans causes
serious problems for patients Moreover, there is a danger of transmission of the Covid-19 virus from one
patient to other people due to CT-Scan tunnel contamination.
Therefore, many researchers and physicians have resorted to plain radiographic images or X-rays to
diagnose Covid-19. However, these images do not have the resolution and accuracy in diagnosing Covid19 from the beginning and have many disadvantages in this regard. Therefore, artificial intelligence
researchers rushed to the help of clinical experts and used deep learning as a powerful tool to improve the
accuracy of the diagnosis of Covdi-19 with X-ray images [22]. Due to the nature of deep learning in the
extraction of image features, this technology is capable of detecting patients with Covid-19 and extracting
infectious lung tissue, so many studies embarked on a variety of deep learning algorithms to analyze these
images [30-32, 36-39, 41, 42, 53, 58-60, 66-71]. In the early days of the Covid-19 outbreak, CT-Scans were
more common in diagnosing it, but over time, X-rays also became common. Therefore, research also shifted
from CT-Scan image analysis to radiographic image analysis. Figure (3) shows the amount of analysis of
the two modalities used to detect and diagnose Covid-19.

One of the main features of deep neural networks,
in terms of its efficacy, is its employed
architecture. Deep neural network architectures
demonstrate an extraordinary ability to perform a
variety of functions for a variety of data types.
Different studies have been performed on Covid19 with different deep learning architectures. In a
number of these studies, their diagnosis rate was
compared in the detection of Covid-19 by using
different types of architectures [28, 33]. The
frequency of CNN architectures used in the
Figure 3: rate of using different radiological modalities in processing of
present study can be seen in Figure (4). The
Covid-19 with deep learning
architectures presented in this figure represent a
family of the same architectures or different
editions of that architecture. In the texts reviewed, the ResNet architecture enjoyed the most efficacy.
However, some of the studies with ResNet 50 architecture achieved the best efficacy in detecting and
diagnosing Covid-19, and others used other ResNet editions to maximize efficacy in analyzing radiological
images for the diagnosis of Covid-19. It was found
that newer and more developed architectures were
more efficient in diagnosing Covid-19.

3.2 Deep learning techniques in
Detection and Diagnosis of Covid-19
Studies suggest that different deep learning
techniques have been used to detect, diagnose,
classify, predict, and prognosis of Covid-19.
Domestic datasets (including CT and X-ray
images) or public datasets have been used in some

used to teach and validate the methods. Criteria for
measuring the efficiency of methods used in community studies include sensitivity, specificity, and
accuracy. However, in many research, AUC has also been used to determine the efficiency of the method
used to diagnose Covid-19.
In a number of studies, the proposed method has been implemented based on well-known or state of the art
architectures. However, some studies have also presented their own customized algorithm and architecture,
independent of well-known architectures.

4: Discussion
This systematic study evaluated 37 studies that work to assist researchers to explore and develop
knowledge-based systems based on artificial intelligence in the detection and diagnosis of Covid-19. To
improve our knowledge, the current review, which uses a variety of deep learning methods to analyze
radiological images, is one of the most comprehensive studies in diagnosis and detection Covid-19. The
current review provided up-to-date information on deep learning algorithms and their application as an
expression of radiographic imaging analysis of Covid-19. Many studies have shown that the use of deep
learning algorithms can improve the rate of metric features of CT-Scan images and increase the sensitivity
and specificity of radiographic images compared to the radiologist's diagnosis; therefore, the use of this
cheap and affordable modality should be considered as a reliable method for the diagnosis of Covid-9. By
reviewing 23 research papers on the application of X-ray in the diagnosis of Covid-19 by using deep
learning methods, the current modality can be introduced to the scientific and medical community in the
field of early and faster diagnosis of Covid-19. By improving imaging methods through artificial
intelligence technologies, we can point to the cheapest and safest imaging methods to prevent the
transmission of Covid-19. A review of published studies showed that the diagnosis of Covid-19 by deep
learning algorithms under the supervision of a radiologist led to an improved efficacy and reduced
diagnostic errors in various cases of pneumonia, especially Covid-19. Mean diagnosis of all the studies
performed through X-ray modality had a sensitivity with an average higher than 95% and a specificity of
higher than 91%, which had a higher rate of diagnosis than that of Covid-19 in traditional texts and methods.
It can also be concluded from the studies that the specificity in CT-Scan images obtained by deep learning
method in case of contracting Covid-19 was on average higher than 92%, which in many cases, compared
to previous texts, has a higher efficiency in terms of the specificity; the sensitivity of deep learning methods
in CT-Scan images of Covid-19 was also higher than or equal to the usual diagnostic methods in many
cases. It is thought that due to the over-similarity of the effects of Covid-19 on lung tissue with different
types of bacterial and viral pneumonia, the diagnosis of these diseases through unsupervised methods is
very difficult and complicated. The examination of the algorithms and deep learning architectures revealed
that almost all studies have used the CNN algorithm; of course, other algorithms have been used along with
the CNN algorithm in other studies. The CNN architectures used in these studies all have special features
in image analysis, and without adjusting their parameters, it is not possible to have access to the ability of
these architectures to detect and diagnose Covid-19.

5. Conclusion and Future work
As discussed in this review research, the early detection and diagnosis of Covid-19, by deep learning
techniques and with the least cost and complications are the basic steps in preventing the disease and the
progression of the pandemic. In the near future, with the incorporation of deep learning algorithms in the
equipment of radiology centers, it will be possible to achieve a faster, cheaper, and safer diagnosis of Covid19. The use of these techniques in rapid diagnostic decision-making of Covid-19 can be a powerful tool for
a radiologist to reduce human error and assist them to make decisions in critical conditions and the peak of
the disease. This research supports the idea that deep learning algorithms are a promising way of optimizing
health care and improving the results of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. Although deep learning is
one of the most powerful computing tools in diagnosis pneumonia, especially Covid-19, developers should
be careful to avoid overfitting and to maximize the generalizability and usefulness of Covid-19 deep
learning diagnostic models; these models must be trained on large, heterogeneous datasets to cover all
available data space.
