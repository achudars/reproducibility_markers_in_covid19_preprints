Abstract
The race to meet the challenges of the global pandemic has served as a reminder that
the existing drug discovery process is expensive, inefficient and slow. There is a major
bottleneck screening the vast number of potential small molecules to shortlist lead
compounds for antiviral drug development. New opportunities to accelerate drug
1

discovery lie at the interface between machine learning methods, in this case developed
for linear accelerators, and physics-based methods. The two in silico methods, each
have their own advantages and limitations which, interestingly, complement each other.
Here, we present an innovative method that combines both approaches to accelerate
drug discovery. The scale of the resulting workflow is such that it is dependent on high
performance computing. We have demonstrated the applicability of this workflow on
four COVID-19 target proteins and our ability to perform the required large-scale
calculations to identify lead compounds on a variety of supercomputers.
1. Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic has shaken the world, and the scale and rapidity of the crisis
have also challenged existing methods of doing research, not least the current drug
design process, which takes about 10 years and $1-3 billion to develop a single
marketable drug molecule [1,2]. The disease is caused by the novel severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a member of the coronavirus
family, which was first identified in the mid-1960s at the Common Cold Unit in
Wiltshire, England [3]. Discovering how to combat the pandemic rests on
understanding recent outbreaks, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
(SARS-CoV), which has the most closely-related genome, and middle east respiratory
syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and taking advantage of the explosion of research
in 2020 on various aspects of SARS-CoV-2 biology, from transmission to life cycle.
Based on this research, notably experimentally-derived structures for the various viral
target proteins, several drug repositioning and drug designing studies have been
conducted using in silico computer-based modelling technologies [4–6]. However, the
identification of conclusive drug molecules has been hampered by the huge chemical
space that needs to be explored.
Because of the vast number of potential ligands (ranging from a few hundred million
to billions), it is clearly not possible to synthesize them in wet labs, nor is it desirable
given that most of them are not going to bind with SARS-CoV-2 proteins at all. This is
where in silico methods can play an important role in screening the binding affinity of
ligands with SARS-CoV-2 proteins to identify and rank potential drug candidates.
There is an increasingly large number of in silico methods available to screen candidate
ligands. The two most popular categories are physics-based (PB) techniques including
molecular dynamics (MD) based methods, and machine learning (ML) techniques.
However, both have inevitable limitations and, even after months of research there is a
disappointing lack of potential drug candidates for COVID-19 given that so many lives
are at stake. There is an urgent need to accelerate the current drug design process and
the work presented here is a step in the direction.
PB techniques involve ab initio as well as semi-empirical methods which are fully or
partially derived from firm theoretical foundations [7–10]. For example, MD is a
popular approach for conformational sampling which is derived from Newtonian
equations of motion and the concepts of statistical thermodynamics. MD-based free
energy calculation methods have been widely applied for predicting protein-ligand
binding affinities and subject to extensive experimental validation [11,12,21,22,13–20].
There are many such free energy methods, some “approximate”; others more
“accurate”.

2

In the last decade or so, ensemble simulation based methods have been proposed which
overcome the issue of variability in predictions from MD-based methods due to their
extreme sensitivity to simulation initial conditions [13,19–23] which leads to chaotic
behaviour, and non-Gaussian statistics [24,25]. In particular, two methods named
Enhanced Sampling of Molecular Dynamics with Approximation of Continuum
Solvent (ESMACS) [13,14,17,26] and Thermodynamic Integration with Enhanced
Sampling (TIES) [19–22] have been shown to deliver accurate, precise and
reproducible binding affinity predictions within a few hours. Their excellent scalability
allows them to calculate binding affinities for a large number of protein-ligand
complexes in parallel, utilizing the large size and multiple cores of current
supercomputers.
Another important factor affecting the reliability of results is the extent of
conformational sampling achieved by MD simulations. Thus, several enhanced
methods have also been developed to better sample the phase space [27]. However,
even such enhanced sampling is prone to variability in results due to extreme sensitivity
to initial conditions. Once again, ensemble simulations are required to control
uncertainties in predictions [20–22].
However, these in silico methods are computationally demanding and are unable to
explore the extensive chemical space relevant for drug molecule generation. To focus
the hunt, they require extensive consultation with chemists to suggest structural features
or specific functional groups that may improve a ligand’s interaction with the target
protein, based on the chemical environment of the binding pocket. Drawing on human
intelligence and insights takes time and slows the process of drug discovery by delaying
the pipeline of candidate ligands to wet labs for testing. Even if this step is accelerated,
another bottleneck in drug design looms because there is a limit to the number of
compounds that can be studied experimentally.
To overcome the limitations of PB methods, ML methods can be employed. Prediction
of binding affinities using a deep neural network has been an active area of research
over the past few years. ML represents a set of techniques that rely on inferring complex
relationships from big data and applications include diverse fields such as robotics,
gaming, language processing and chemoinformatics. Some examples include
classifying kinase conformations [28], predicting antimicrobial resistance [29],
modelling quantitative structure-activity relationships [30], and predicting contact
maps in protein folding [31], with AlphaFold making important progress in protein
structure prediction [32].
In the field of drug discovery, ML, specifically deep learning (DL), allows us to
generate novel drug-like molecules by sampling a significant subset of the chemical
space of relevance. DL techniques are computationally much cheaper and enable quick
turnaround of results which allows millions to billions of compounds to be handled
[33]. Recent developments in DL allow generation of novel drug-like molecules in
silico by sampling a large fraction of the chemical space of relevance (estimated to be
about 1068 compounds). However, the accuracy of ML/DL methods is very much
dependent on the training data. Their predictive capability can be improved by
providing them with reliable data and by curating them with theoretical understanding

3

[34], neither of which may always be available. This restricts their applicability in the
drug discovery domain.
ML and PB methods have their own advantages and limitations. Fortunately, their
strengths and weaknesses complement each other and so it makes sense to couple them
in drug discovery. ML/DL techniques can be employed to augment human intelligence
(HI) with artificial intelligence (AI) for exploring the large chemical space to predict
“useful” ligand molecules. This substantially speeds up the process of ligand discovery.
On the other hand, reliable PB free energy methods can rank the ligands on the basis of
their binding affinities and ground the simulations on theoretical understanding. These
binding affinities can then be fed back into the DL algorithm to augment its knowledge
base and hone predictions. Such a combination can be an effective tool for drug design
and can prove useful in prospective drug design projects. Robust predictive mechanistic
models are of particular value for constraining ML when dealing with sparse data,
exploring vast design spaces to seek correlations and, most importantly, testing if
correlations are causal [35].
It is well accepted that drug targets can undergo significant conformational changes
during their biological activity. Some of these changes may involve large-scale
rearrangements, such as a domain motion over a hinge region, while some others may
be more limited in size, such as the short-lived opening of a mostly hydrophobic cryptic
site. The interesting point is that they can involve targetable structures that might
otherwise remain hidden to experimental structural determination. Although the
physics-based models, such as MD simulations, can explore conformational space to
some extent, they can hardly achieve ergodicity, resulting in some of the potential new
target structures remaining hidden. Here DL approaches are envisaged to explore
whether a short stretch of a MD trajectory may exhibit the hallmarks of potentially
biologically relevant structural transitions, even though such transitions are not
observed in the trajectory itself.
Not only will exploitation of AI ensure that the best use is made of medicinal chemists
for drug discovery, it also helps counter chemists’ bias during exploration of the
chemical space. Carefully trained DL algorithms may be expected to reach regions of
the extensive chemical space that may remain untouched by humans.
In this work, we present a novel in silico method for drug design by coupling ML with
PB methods. Rather than performing only blind ML/DL, we couple them with accurate
PB methods to make them “smarter”. Potential candidates are selected from the output
of a DL algorithm and they are scored using PB methods to calculate binding free
energies. This information is then fed back to the DL algorithm to refine its predictive
capability. This loop proceeds iteratively involving a variety of PB scoring methods
with increasing level of accuracies at each step ensuring that the DL algorithm gets
progressively more “intelligent”. We posit that our innovative integration of PB and
ML-based methods can substantially reduce the throughput time for exploring a huge
chemical space and improve the efficacy of exploration of chemical libraries for lead
discovery.
Given the large-scale supercomputing infrastructure available to us, we are able to scale
to the vast number of calculations required to provide input to the ML models. Equally
important, our methods are designed to provide key uncertainty quantification, a feature

4

vital to our goal of using active learning to optimise campaigns of simulations to
maximise the chance that predictive ML models will find promising drug candidates.
2. Methods
No single algorithm or method can achieve the necessary accuracy with required
efficiency to sample the huge chemical space inhabited by lead compounds for drug
discovery. We innovated by combining multiple algorithms into a single unified
pipeline (Figure 1), using an interactive and iterative methodology, allowing both
upstream and downstream feedback to overcome the limitations of classical in silico
drug design as described above.

We first describe the different components of our workflow, notably their standalone
strengths and weaknesses, then show how we couple them constructively in the
workflow such that the sum is greater than the parts.
a) High-throughput Docking
Protein-ligand docking involves ligand 3D structure (conformer) enumeration,
exhaustive docking and scoring, and pose scoring. The input requires a protein structure
with a designed binding region, or a crystallized ligand from which a region can be
inferred, as well as a database of small molecules to dock, where the chemical structure
is represented in the SMILES format.
Conversion of the
performed through
that also includes
stereochemistry is

2D structures into 3D structures ready for structural docking is
proteinisation and conformer generation using Omega-Tautomers
enumeration of enantiomers prior to conformer generation if
not specified [37]. Conformer generation is performed on the
5

ensemble of structures, typically generating 200-800 3D conformers for every
enantiomer.
Each of the 3D structures so generated is docked against the protein binding pocket and
scored. The best scoring pose is returned along with its ChemGauss4 score from
exhaustive rigid docking [38]. The ranking obtained using such docking scores are
useful in the initial hit identification stage of the drug discovery pipeline.
As a consequence, the outputs of docking runs include a 3D protein (receptor) structure
with the docked ligand in its binding site. The docking score (evaluated by the scoring
function specific to a docking protocol) provides a qualitative measure of the intrinsic
complementarity between a given ligand and protein binding site. While docking
protocols are generally good at estimating the binding poses (i.e., 3D conformation) of
ligands within a binding site, the energetics of interaction can be challenging to
determine and are a function of how a specific scoring function is implemented. This
is why we employ MD-based binding affinity prediction methods for more accurate
ranking of the available compounds on the top ranked compounds based on their
docking scores.
Furthermore, there is a need to account for the intrinsic flexibility of the protein in
response to the ligand (which may also induce conformational changes) that needs to
be accounted for in the energetics of how ligands/proteins interact. For this purpose,
extensive conformational sampling is often necessary. The enhanced/adaptive sampling
techniques described below can help addressing some intrinsic limitations of these
techniques.
b) ML-based Conformation Transition Classifier
In order to investigate the conformational transitions during MD simulations, we used
two 10 s trajectories, made available by D.E. Shaw Research [39], of the SARS-CoV2 spike glycoprotein starting from two main different conformations (i.e., 6VYB and
6VXX, partially open and closed states, respectively). The dictionary of secondary
structure of proteins (DSSP) [40] is used to classify each residue according to its
secondary structure in all the frames of the trajectory. A total of 8334 frames are
extracted from the 10 μs simulations of the spike glycoprotein. The data used for the
analysis consist of the atomic coordinates of the protein’s C atoms and secondary
structures of the protein residues, according to DSSP. To analyse the conformations,
we adapted the ML-based Anomaly Detection techniques previously designed and
employed at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) for scientific
and medical linear accelerators [41]. We predicted the probability of a local protein
conformational change based on transitions occurring in individual trajectories.
The trajectory of each C in class-space is followed in time until a change of class is
observed at time ta, with a running over the number of atoms in the simulation. From
that time on, the transitions between different classes, if any, are tracked for 100
subsequent frames, forming a corresponding set of stochastic transitions matrices,
whose elements Tkl represent the transition frequency from class k to class l, where
k,l={0..7} (cf. Table 1). Only a few transitions out of the possible 64 are effectively
observed within the examined dataset. The most frequently observed are the transitions
between identical or structurally adjacent classes.

The stochastic transition matrices are then turned into heat maps and fed into a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The neural network was a 2-layer CNN, trained
using the Reptile meta-learning algorithm [42]. The input layer has a single channel of
8 by 8 pixels. It uses Keras implementation of the relu activation function, the Sparse
Categorical Cross Entropy Loss Function and the Adam optimizer. The transition-based
classification is used to predict the probability of belonging to a class, and of the class
that the selected residue might land at a future time, typically after 1500 frames since
the initial class change. We compared the prediction with the frequency of belonging
to each class, as observed throughout the simulation that was not used for training, i.e.
that starting from the 6VXX structure. The similarity between the different distributions
was evaluated via the Jensen-Shannon divergence [43]. Our preliminary results, shown
in Table 2, are encouraging, although subject to a number of caveats. First and foremost,
the training and the validation data set (70:30) pertain to a single trajectory, which
implies that some transitions are trained on a very small number of events. Hence,
multi-trajectory data are needed to consolidate these preliminary results. Using more
data would also allow to introduce additional classes, thus obtaining a more precise
estimation of residues’ behaviour. This is currently the subject of an on-going research.

presented in decreasing order of similarity. The labels code for the initial and final class.
When they are identical, it means that after some oscillation, the residue goes back to
the initial class.

c) ML-driven Enhanced Sampling
DL methods have been widely applied to understand protein conformational dynamics,
and a number of methods have been proposed to enhance sampling of conformational
landscapes using adaptive sampling strategies that include DL methods in their
workflows. One such approach, namely DeepDriveMD, uses variational autoencoders
to cluster high dimensional data on conformations from multiple MD trajectories into
a more manageable low dimensional manifold from which ‘novel’ conformations can
be selected, based on certain reaction coordinates (RCs) or collective variables (CVs)
and new simulations can be instantiated from such conformations [44]. This approach
has been demonstrated for protein folding trajectories, offering at least 2x speedup
compared to traditional conformational sampling methods, and in a recent application,
DeepDriveMD was able to enhance sampling by nearly 25% with just 12% of compute
time for studying conformational transitions of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein bound
to the ACE2 receptor [45]. Thus, DeepDriveMD offers a way forward in sampling
conformational events, providing a framework to extend its functionality to account for
studying protein-ligand interactions.
Ligands bound to the protein target of interest induce specific conformational changes;
some ligands may induce changes that are local to the binding site, whereas others may
induce changes farther away from the binding site. We posit that even with reasonably
short time-scale simulations, our variational autoencoder can cluster protein-ligand
interaction landscapes based on such conformational differences and provide a
quantitative way to extract ligand-specific protein conformational signatures that could
help bound the uncertainty in binding affinity calculations. To this effect, we extracted
the contact maps between the protein C-atoms (defined at an 8 Å cut-off) and analysed
them with our variational autoencoder. Optimal hyperparameters were determined as
described previously [46] and the resulting latent space embedding was visualized
using t-Stochastic neighbourhood embedding (t-SNE) approach. In our analysis, we
observe clear separation between protein-ligand complexes as well as the fact that some
ligands induce more conformational changes than others.
d) MD-based Binding Affinity Prediction
Hit-to-Lead (H2L) is a step in the drug discovery process where promising lead
compounds are identified from initial hits – small molecules which have the desired
activity – generated during preceding stages. After evaluation of initial hits,
optimization of promising compounds is carried out to achieve nanomolar affinities.
The change in free energy between free and bound states of protein and ligand, also
known as binding affinity, is a promising measure of the binding potency of a molecule
and is used as a parameter for evaluating and optimising hits at the H2L stage.
A protocol known as ESMACS [13,17] was used to estimate binding affinities of
protein-ligand complexes. It involves performing an ensemble of MD simulations
followed by free energy estimation using a semi-empirical method called molecular
mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MMPBSA). The free energies for the

8

ensemble of conformations are analysed in a statistically robust manner, yielding
precise free energy predictions for any given complex.
The use of ensembles is particularly important because the usual practice of performing
MMPBSA calculations on conformations generated using a single MD simulation does
not give reliable binding affinities [47]. Consequently, ESMACS predictions can be
used to rank a large number of hits based on their binding affinities. ESMACS is able
to handle large variations in ligand structures and hence is very suitable for H2L stage
where hits have been picked out after covering a substantial region of chemical space.
The ensemble of conformations for the protein-ligand complex generated using MD
simulations are also analysed using the variational autoencoder technique described
above to get insights into favourable as well as unfavourable interactions of different
functional groups in a molecule with the target protein. This knowledge is helpful in
performing further optimization of the lead structures. The information and data
generated with ESMACS is additionally used to train our ML model (described below)
to improve its predictive capability.
Lead Optimization (LO) is the final step of pre-clinical drug discovery. It involves
altering the structures of selected lead compounds in order to improve properties, such
as selectivity, potency and pharmacokinetic parameters. Binding affinity is a useful
parameter to make in silico predictions about the effects of any chemical alteration in a
lead molecule. However, LO requires theoretically more accurate (without much/any
approximations) methods to make predictions with high confidence. In addition,
relative binding affinity of pairs of compounds which are structurally similar are of
interest, rendering ESMACS unsuitable for LO.
Because of these issues, we employ thermodynamic integration with enhanced
sampling (TIES) [19–21], which is based on an alchemical free energy method called
thermodynamic integration (TI) [48]. Alchemical methods involve calculating free
energy along a non-physical thermodynamic pathway to get relative free energy
between the two end-points. Usually, the alchemical pathway corresponds to
transformation of one chemical species into another defined with a coupling parameter
(𝜆), ranging between 0 and 1. TIES involves performing an ensemble simulation at each
𝜆 value to generate the ensemble of conformations to be used for calculating relative
free energy. It also involves performing a robust error analysis to yield relative binding
affinities with statistically meaningful error bars. The parameters such as the size of the
ensemble and the length of simulations are determined keeping in mind the desired
level of precision in the results [19].
e) ML-based Model to Predict Useful Ligands
In our drug discovery workflow, ML is used to gather and accumulate information from
all the other PB components described above so as to quickly locate the most interesting
region(s) in the chemical space in terms of the potential of a lead compound to bind
strongly. We have created a ML surrogate model using a simple featurisation method,
namely 2D image depictions, as it does not require complicated architectures such as
graph convolution networks, while demonstrating good prediction. We obtain these
image depictions from the nCov-Group Data Repository [49] that contains various
descriptors for 4.2 billion molecules generated on HPC systems with Parsl [50]. By

9

using 2D images, we are able to initialise our models with pre-trained weights that are
typically scale and rotation invariant under image classification. This model is used to
generate ligand molecules that can be analysed using the PB methods described above.
We train our ML model using data from both docking as well as MD based binding
affinity predictions so as to enable it to actively relate structural/chemical features with
corresponding binding potencies. This allows our ML model to progressively make
more accurate predictions of ligand structures that can be classified as initial hits. The
predicted structures are then fed into the PB pipeline to filter them, first using docking
and then by ESMACS and TIES, to finally select those that bind most effectively. This
is repeated with the ML model getting better after each iteration. Thus, we provide
reliable training data to our ML models whereas potentially good initial structures are
identified for our PB methods. In this way, our workflow couples ML and MD such
that each compensates for the weaknesses in the other method. It is our expectation that,
together, they are more effective.
3. Workflow management
Our workflow (Figure 1) integrates different methods and dynamically selects active
ligands for progressively computationally expensive methods. At each stage, only the
most promising candidates advance to the next stage, yielding a pipeline in which each
downstream stage is computationally more expensive, but also more accurate, than
upstream stages. Execution of such a complicated workflow requires scalable tools with
advanced resource management, task-placement and adaptive execution capabilities, in
this case RADICAL-Cybertools (RCT) [51] middleware.
RCT executes tasks concurrently or sequentially, depending on their arbitrary priority
relation. Tasks are grouped into stages and stages into pipelines, depending on the
priority relation among tasks. Tasks without reciprocal priority relation can be grouped
into the same stage, tasks that need to be executed before other tasks have to be grouped
into different stages. Stages are then grouped into pipelines and, in turn, multiple
pipelines can be executed either concurrently or sequentially. RCT uses RADICALPilot (RP) [52] to execute tasks on HPC resources, allowing the execution of workflows
with heterogeneous tasks.
RCT middleware has been used in two ways:
Scalable concurrent multi-stage task-execution: A work around was required to use the
middleware on one of Europe’s largest supercomputers, SuperMUC-NG. As
RADICAL-Cybertools depend on 3rd party software modules, the virtual environment
required by RP couldn't be created on SuperMUC-NG because access is granted only
to allowed IP addresses. Thus, we prepared RCT’s virtual environment outside of the
system and then moved it to SuperMUC-NG login node. In this way, RCT could be
launched from a login node via the pre-set environment, without the need for outbound
internet access. RCT uses MongoDB and RabbitMQ as communication services. These
services need to be accessible from both login and compute nodes. On SuperMUC-NG,
we automated the launching of both services on a dedicated compute node, which was
provided by a special service queue with unlimited walltime, while the workers for RP
were provided by the regular batch system.

10

Concurrent Multiple Workflow Execution: RCT’s fine-level task-placement feature
allows the concurrent use of both CPUs and GPUs on supercomputer nodes. That is
achieved by employing RADICAL-Pilot’s unique capability of concurrently executing
heterogeneous tasks on CPU cores and GPUs as an integrated hybrid workflow. This
allows the concurrent execution and interleaving of different workflows, making better
use of compute resources. RP places tasks on specific compute nodes, cores and GPU
[53]. When scheduling tasks that require different amounts of cores and/or GPUs, RP
keeps tracks of the available slots on each compute node of its pilot. Depending on
availability, RP schedules CPU tasks (e.g., MPI) within and across compute nodes and
reserves a CPU core for each GPU task. This results in efficient placement of
heterogeneous tasks on heterogeneous resources.
Leveraging aforementioned RP's heterogeneous task placement capabilities, we merge
ESMACS and TIES into an integrated hybrid workflow with heterogeneous tasks that
utilise CPU and GPU concurrently. Running these two calculations concurrently
reduces the total execution time, substantially saving computational cost, thereby
improving resource utilisation at scale.
4. High performance computing resources
Our workflow is by design based on high throughput computational (HTC)
calculations. Even though, it reduces the overall number of necessary computations
tremendously, an acceptable time to solution is only achievable on HPC resources. To
illustrate the impact of our workflow, we applied it to four target proteins of SARSCoV-2 in this work, namely 3C like protease (3CLPro), papain-like protease (PLPro),
ADP-ribose phosphatase (ADRP), and non-structural protein 15 (NSP15) (Figure 2).
These proteins have diverse functions for the replication and transcription of the
coronavirus, and are important targets for pharmaceutical drug design and discovery.
For this, docking calculations were performed on thousands of ML-model-generated
ligand conformations, leading to a ranking of candidates with corresponding ligand
structures. Afterwards, we conducted several hundred ESMACS calculations on the top
ranked ligands based on their docking and 19 TIES calculations on a selection of ligand
pairs. Note that the ML-based generation of ligand structures accelerated the whole
HTC process significantly.

All calculations were performed on a variety of supercomputers including Leibniz
Rechenzentrum’s SuperMUC-NG, Hartree Centre’s ScafellPike, Oak Ridge National
Laboratory’s Summit and Texas Advanced Computing Center’s Frontera. Table 2
summarizes performance and cost numbers for the calculations on Summit to
understand the overall cost of the presented pipeline. Note that the ESMACS
calculations were accelerated with OpenMM as MD engine on GPUs. TIES required
longer wall-clock times as only CPUs were employed.

5. ESMACS and TIES applied to COVID-19 on high end resources
a) ESMACS findings
ESMACS is used at the hit identification and H2L stage of the drug discovery. The DLbased surrogate model was used to screen the small molecules in the Zinc database, a
collection of commercially available chemical compounds. A high-throughput docking
study was then performed to generate binding poses of the compounds to the 4 COVID19 proteins (Figure 2). While docking programs are generally good at pose prediction,
they are less effective in predicting binding free energy of the compounds to the target
proteins. To better rank the binding potentials of the compounds, we performed
ESMACS simulations for the top 100 compounds for each of the selected proteins. The
compounds were chosen from 10,000 docked small molecules, based on their docking
scores from the high throughput docking study.
Preparation and setup of the simulations were implemented using binding affinity
calculator (BAC), including parametrization of the compounds, building simulationready topologies and structures of the complexes, and generating configurations files
for the simulations. MD simulations were performed using two MD engines, NAMD
and OpenMM, on three machines, Frontera, Summit and SuperMUC-NG. For each
replica, energy minimisations were first performed, followed by 2 ns equilibration.
Finally, 10 ns production simulations were run for each replica. MMPBSA calculations
were then performed for all of the 1000 frames from the 10 ns production runs, while
configurational entropies were calculated using NMODE on 48 or 56 frames for each
replica, depending on the number of cores per node on the computers used for NMODE
calculations.
12

For most of the molecular systems studied, about 4-19% of the compounds show
promising binding affinities (cf. Table 3), with free energies more negative than -8.24
kcal/mol (corresponding to a KD value on the nanomolar scale). Although the
distributions of predicted free energies from independent simulations are non-normal
[24,25], the ensemble-based ESMACS predictions are highly reproducible,
independent of which MD code is used, or on which supercomputer the simulations are
performed. As stated above, the docking scores are not a good indicator for binding
affinities; the free energies from ESMACS calculations only show weak correlations
with the docking scores (Figure 3). The inclusion of configurational entropy has a
negligible impact on the ranking of the binding free energies. The ESMACS study
shows that the most promising compounds can be selected more reliably using the
ESMACS prediction than the docking scores.
Table 3: Number of the most promising compounds for each of the 4 proteins
investigated. For each protein, the top 100 compounds, chosen from 10,000 docked
small molecules, are evaluated by ESMACS approach. The number of compounds are
listed, which have the most favourable binding free energies, in the ranges
corresponding to KD values of 10 nM (-10.98 kcal/mol), 100 nM (-9.61 kcal/mol), 1
M (-8.24 kcal/mol).

respectively.

b) TIES findings
TIES is used at the LO stage of drug discovery to hone interactions between protein
and ligand so to enhance the binding potency of selected lead compounds. To
demonstrate this capability, we performed TIES on a set of 19 compound
transformations (that is chemically mutating the “original” compound into a “new”
compound) to study the effect of small structural changes on a compound’s binding
potency with ADRP. The calculated free energy differences show a non-normal nature,
as we have recently reported [24,25]. The ensemble-based TIES approach ensures high
precision predictions, with uncertainties less than 0.82 kcal/mol for all but one of the
calculations (cf. Table 4). The relative binding affinities (ΔΔ𝐺) predicted by TIES for

13

these transformations fall between -0.55 to +4.62 kcal/mol (cf. Table 4). A positive
value indicates a diminished relative binding potency for the “new” compound, whereas
a negative value means that the transformation studied is favourable. 12 out of the 19
transformations studied have ΔΔ𝐺 > +1 suggesting that they all correspond to
unfavourable structural changes. The remaining seven transformations have
statistically zero value for ΔΔ𝐺, which implies that the corresponding structural
modifications do not affect the binding. It is difficult to predict what structural changes
will improve the binding. Thus, the knowledge of both “useful” as well as “rubbish”
transformations is of much value at the LO stage so as to make informed structural
changes. TIES provides us an excellent tool to do so with confidence. Such information
then informs our ML predictive model about the desirable as well as undesirable
chemical modifications to be introduced into the selected lead compounds. In this way,
it improves the predictive accuracy of the ML models, progressively leading to quicker
convergence towards the region of our interest in the huge chemical space.
Table 4: Results from TIES calculations on a set of ligand transformations studied for ADRP.
ΔΔ𝑮 is the relative binding affinity for a transformation, that is the change in binding affinity
on morphing one ligand into the other. 𝝈 corresponds to the uncertainty associated with the

6. Conclusions
We describe an innovative, iterative and interactive heterogenous workflow that has the
potential to accelerate the existing drug discovery process substantially by coupling
machine learning with physics-based methods such that each compensates for the
weaknesses of the other. This workflow requires high-throughput screening of a large
number of small molecules based on their binding potencies evaluated using various
types of methods. Molecules filtered at one stage are advanced to the next to be filtered

14

once again using a more accurate and computationally intensive method. A refined set
of lead compounds emerges at the end of this multistage process for wet lab studies.
With information relating structural features to energetics and binding potencies being
fed into the ML model at each stage, it learns how to improve the prediction of the next
set of compounds. This iterative process, along with the upstream and downstream flow
of information, allows it to accelerate the sampling of relevant chemical space much
faster than traditional methods. We have demonstrated the application of our workflow
on four SARS-CoV-2 target proteins. The workflow requires HPC resources for
efficient implementation and a dedicated workflow manager to handle the large number
of heterogenous computational tasks on a multitude of supercomputers. We believe that
this hybrid ML-PB approach offers the potential in the long term – with the rise of
exascale, quantum and analogue processing – to deliver novel pandemic drugs at
pandemic speed.
