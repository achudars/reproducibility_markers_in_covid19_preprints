Abstract
This paper introduces new methods for analysing the extreme and erratic behaviour of time series to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on cryptocurrency
market dynamics. Across 51 cryptocurrencies, we examine extreme behaviour
through a study of distribution extremities, and erratic behaviour through structural breaks. First, we analyse the structure of the market as a whole and observe
a reduction in self-similarity as a result of COVID-19, particularly with respect
to structural breaks in variance. Second, we compare and contrast these two
behaviours, and identify individual anomalous cryptocurrencies. Tether (USDT)
and TrueUSD (TUSD) are consistent outliers with respect to their returns, while
Holo (HOT), NEXO (NEXO), Maker (MKR) and NEM (XEM) are frequently
observed as anomalous with respect to both behaviours and time. Even among a
market known as consistently volatile, this identifies individual cryptocurrencies
that behave most irregularly in their extreme and erratic behaviour and shows
these were more affected during the COVID-19 market crisis.

1. Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic has had significant impacts on society, and prompted
a substantial amount of attention and research. In epidemiology, studies have
focused on the spread of COVID-19 and potential measures of containment
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], while clinical research has explored potential treatments for the
disease [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], including a vaccine [13]. Researchers in nonlinear
dynamics have used a wide range of new techniques to analyse and predict the
spread of COVID-19 cases and deaths [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19].
By contrast, most research studying the impact of COVID-19 on financial
markets has used traditional statistical methods such as parametric models
[20, 21, 22, 23]. For example, [24, 25] use dynamic conditional correlations

between stock returns and hedging costs to study financial contagion and safe
asset classes. Similarly, [26] studies financial contagion via cross-correlation
analysis, [27] uses a GARCH(1,1) model, while [28] is a qualitative overview of
financial contagion. [29, 30] use a value at risk measure to study safe havens
in the cryptocurrency market. [31] uses existing metrics and tests (such as
approximate entropy, Lyapunov Exponents, t-tests and F-tests) to study the
predictability of price fluctuations. All these methods are well-studied in the
existing finance literature. Notably, [32] proposes new methods to detect asset
tail risk and determine if such risk can be reduced with safe asset classes.
Since their inception, cryptocurrencies have been of great interest to researchers in dynamical systems and econophysics. There has been substantial
research on individual cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin [33, 34, 35, 36, 37] and the
disorder and fractal behaviour within cryptocurrencies in general [38, 39, 40, 41].
Notably, Drozdz and coauthors have analysed several quantitative aspects of the
cryptocurrency market closely, including cross-correlations, auto-correlations and
scaling effects. Across three papers [42, 43, 44] they have proposed significant
evidence that the cryptocurrency market has become an independent regular
market decoupled from and resembling foreign exchange. Structural breaks of
cryptocurrencies have been analysed by [45, 46], who imply, but do not explicitly
state, that these points in time where statistical properties change herald erratic
and unpredictable behaviour.
The goal of this paper is to extend the study of the nonlinear dynamics of
cryptocurrencies and introduce new methods to analyse their extreme and erratic
behaviour, before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Extreme behaviour is
analysed via restricted distributions that capture the extreme values of the log
returns and Parkinson variance time series; erratic behaviour is analysed via
structural breaks. We build on the existing literature in several ways. The theory
of extreme events has been studied in [47] and [48, 49] where machine learning
methods have been used to predict extreme events and detect outliers, respectively.
While [29] and [23] study the impact of COVID-19 on 3 and 5 cryptocurrencies,
respectively, and [45] studies the structural breaks of 7 cryptocurrencies, we
analyse the impact of COVID-19 on the extreme behaviour and structural breaks
of 51 cryptocurrencies. While [24, 25, 26, 27, 29, 30, 31] have studied the
financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic with existing techniques, all our
techniques are new. Finally, we develop a more general framework than that
proposed by [32]. We determine changes due to market dynamics in general,
and identify several specific cryptocurrencies that are anomalous with respect to
returns or variance. Further, we develop new inconsistency matrices to compare
the relationship between extreme and erratic behaviours before and after the
emergence of COVID-19.
In Section 2, we describe our methodology to analyse extreme and erratic
behaviour of an arbitrary collection of time series. The methods therein may be
applied more generally than in the instance of this paper. In Section 3, we apply
our methods to the log returns and Parkinson variance [50] time series for 51
cryptocurrencies. We conclude in Section 4.

2. Methodology
In this paper, the most general object of study is a collection of real-valued
(i)
time series Xt , i = 1, ..., n over a time interval t = 1, ..., T . We analyse four
such collections: the log returns and Parkinson variance of 51 cryptocurrencies
before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Let Pt , Ht , Lt be the closing price,
the daily high, and the daily low, respectively, of a financial instrument at time t.
Let Rt and σt2 be the log returns and Parkinson variance time series, respectively,
defined as follows:


Pt
Rt = log
,
(1)
Pt−1
(log Ht − log Lt )2
.
(2)
σt2 =
4 log 2
The Parkinson variance σt2 defined above is a measure of the instantaneous
price variance of a financial asset based on its intra-day volatility [50]. This
gives a time-dependent variance rather than a scalar value through the standard
deviation computation. The time series Rt takes both positive and negative
values, while σt2 is non-negative everywhere, a distinction that is necessary in
Section 2.1. The precise methodology that we describe below is not exhaustive.
Below we outline the detailed implementation to model the erratic and extreme
behaviour of cryptocurrencies. Modifications may be made for other contexts.
2.1. Distance between distribution extremities
In this section, we describe how we extract and measure the distance between
the extreme values of various time series. Let µ be a probability distribution
that records the values of a time series Xt . For full generality, suppose µ is a
continuous probability measure of the form µ = f (x)dx, where dx is Lebesgue
measure, and f (x) a probability density function. As such, f (x) is non-negative
everywhere with integral 1.
For the log return time series Rt , we extract the points of density 5% and
95%, respectively, by the equations
Z s
f (x)dx = 0.05
(3)
−∞
Z ∞
f (x)dx = 0.05
(4)
t

The range x ≤ s gives the left extremal 5% of the distribution, while the range
x ≥ t gives the right extremal 5%. Next, we define the restricted function by


f (x), x ≤ s
g(x) = f (x)1{x≤s}∪{x≥t} = 0, s < x < t
(5)


f (x), x ≥ t.

3

Above, 1 denotes an indicator function of a set; this construction essentially truncates f only in its tail range. Next, we form the associated measure ν = g(x)dx,
where dx is Lebesgue measure. This construction is common in probability
theory [51].
For the Parkinson variance time series σt2 , the associated function f is
supported on (0, ∞). In this case, we extract the point of density 90% by
Z ∞
f (x)dx = 0.10.
(6)
l

In this instance, we truncate f only in its extremal positive range by defining
(
f (x), x ≥ l
h(x) = f (x)1{x≥l} =
0, x < l.
Again, we form the associated measure η = h(x)dx where dx is Lebesgue measure.
In both cases, this procedure works even more simply for a discrete distribution
given by a finite data set. For the log returns, we form the empirical distribution
function, then remove the middle 90% of the values by order; for the Parkinson
variance, we remove the bottom 90% of the values.
(i)
Now suppose we are given n time series Xt , i = 1, ..., n. We form n associated
probability measures µ1 , ..., µn and then the restricted measures ν1 , ..., νn for the
log returns and η1 , ..., ηn for the Parkinson variance. All these restricted measures
have total measure equal to 0.1 so we may compute the L1 -Wasserstein metric d1
[52] between them. Also known as the Earth-mover’s distance, this is a common
metric between two measures with the same total mass. The construction
of the “associated measure” of ν and η is a technical step from probability
theory [51] that means the Wasserstein metric can compute distance between
two distribution functions by transforming them into measures. We conclude
by forming a matrix between the distribution extremities of the time series.
ER
Let Dij
= d1 (νi , νj ) be the matrix between the log return distributions, and
EV
Dij = d1 (ηi , ηj ) be the matrix between the Parkinson variance distributions.
In Section 3, we will consider the means E(νi ) of the restricted distributions
associated to the log returns. Individually, E(νi ) > 0 if the corresponding
cryptocurrency has greater extreme positive than negative returns, on average.
Collectively, they will offer us insight into the market as a whole.
Altogether, studying the log returns, Parkinson variance time series and
their tail ends gives us insight into not only the mean and standard deviation of
the cryptocurrencies but also higher moments from studying the tail behaviour.
In particular, applying our method to the time-dependent Parkinson variance
allows us to study extremities in variance in detail.
2.2. Distance between erratic behaviour profiles
Let Xt be a time series, t = 1, ..., T . We apply the two-phase change point
detection algorithm described by [53] to obtain a set of structural breaks, also
4

known as change points. These are points in time where the statistical properties
of the time series change, as detected by a particular algorithm. Applied to a
(i)
collection Xt , i = 1, ..., n, t = 1, ..., T of time series, this produces a collection
of finite sets S1 , ..., Sn , each a subset of {1, ..., T }. Further details are given in
Appendix B. This describes a specific change point detection algorithm. Our
methodology is flexible and may build off any such algorithm.
Next, we measure appropriate distances between the sets Si . Traditional
metrics such as the Hausdorff distance are unsuitable, being too sensitive to
outliers [54] so we adopt and modify the semi-metrics developed in [46] between
the sets of structural breaks Si . We define a normalised distance as follows:
!
P
P
1
b∈Sj d(b, Si )
a∈Si d(a, Sj )
D(Si , Sj ) =
+
,
(7)
2T
|Sj |
|Si |
where d(b, Si ) is the minimal distance from b ∈ Sj to the set Si . The expression
above is a L1 norm average of all minimal distances from elements of S1 to S2
and vice versa, normalised by both the size of the sets and the length of the time
series. As in Section 2.1, we form a matrix between the sets of structural breaks,
B
Dij
= D(Si , Sj ). Let DBR and DBV be the matrices between sets of structural
breaks for the log return and Parkinson variance time series, respectively.
2.3. Time-varying dynamics of the cryptocurrency market
In this section, we describe how we analyse the dynamics of returns and
variance across the entire cryptocurrency market, before and after COVID-19.
Let the Frobenius norm of a vector v ∈ Rn and an n × n matrix D be defined as
P
1

Pn
n
2
2 2
||v|| =
and ||D|| =
, respectively. Let Rt and Σt be
i=1 |vi |
i,j=1 |dij |
(i)

the length n vectors of all log returns (Rt ) and Parkinson variances ((σt2 )(i) ) at
time t, respectively. The values ||Rt || and ||Σt || give the magnitude of the first two
distribution moments across the market, and represent its volatility as a whole.
The Frobenius norm of an n × n distance matrix D represents the total size of all
distances within a collection of n elements. A greater Frobenius norm indicates
less self-similarity in the collection. Having studied overall market dynamics, we
next seek to understand the changing relationships between cryptocurrencies.
For this purpose, we study four different time series consisting of the log returns
and Parkinson variance over two different periods, and compare the distance
matrices we have defined, pertaining to return extremes, variance extremes,
return breaks and variance breaks. We compute the respective matrix norms
before and after the emergence of COVID-19 to understand the pandemic’s
impact on the similarity and dynamics of the cryptocurrency market. Our
periods of analysis are 30-06-2018 to 31-12-2019 as “pre-COVID,” which we
denote with the subscript “pre” and 1-1-2020 to 24-06-2020 as “post-COVID,”
which we denote with the subscript “post.” Our methods may appropriately
compare periods of different length as all matrices are appropriately normalised.
Thus, we have eight different distance matrices:
5

ER
BR
• For the log returns pre-COVID time series, we have Dpre
and Dpre
;
EV
BV
• For the Parkinson variance pre-COVID time series, have Dpre
and Dpre
;
ER
BR
• For the log returns post-COVID time series, have Dpost
and Dpost
;
EV
BV
• For the Parkinson variance post-COVID time series, have Dpost
and Dpost
.

We compute the Frobenius norms for these eight matrices in Section 3.
2.4. Inconsistency analysis
In this section, we describe how we measure the consistency between the
extreme and erratic behaviours of cryptocurrencies. To do so, we introduce a
new method of comparing distance matrices and apply this to compare DB and
DE for both the log return and Parkinson variance time series.
Given an n × n distance matrix A, the affinity matrix is defined as
Aij = 1 −

Dij
.
max {D}

(8)

All elements of these affinity matrices lie in [0, 1], so it is appropriate to compare
them directly by taking their difference. Let the affinity matrices associated to
DER , DEV , defined in Section 2.1, and DBR , DBV , defined in Section 2.2, be
AER , AEV , ABR and ABV respectively. We define the behaviour inconsistency
matrix between extreme and erratic behaviour be defined as follows, for log
returns and Parkinson variance, respectively:
INCR,EB = AER − ABR
INC

V,EB

=A

EV

−A

BV

.

(10)

As described in Section 2.3, we analyse the log returns and Parkinson variances
over two distinct periods (pre- and post-COVID), so we have four different
pre,V
post,R
behaviour inconsistency matrices INCpre,R
and INCpost,V
bhvr , INCbhvr , INCbhvr
bhvr .
Finally, we can also define time inconsistency matrices. By comparing corresponding distances matrices, extreme or erratic, over time, we can continue the
goal of Section 2.3 and identify individual cryptocurrencies that have significantly
changed with respect to their similarity with others. We define four inconsistency
matrices with respect to time as follows:
ER
ER
INCER
time = Apre − Apost

(14)

Thus, we have defined eight different inconsistency matrices above. Four,
pre,V
post,R
INCpre,R
and INCpost,V
bhvr , INCbhvr , INCbhvr
bhvr , we refer to as behaviour inconEV
BR
BR
sistency matrices; the other four, INCER
time , INCtime , INCtime and INCtime , we
6

refer to as time inconsistency matrices. The behaviour inconsistency matrices
reveal cryptocurrencies that are irregular with respect to the rest of the market
in the comparison between extreme and erratic behaviour. This may pertain
to the returns or variance, pre- or post-COVID, depending on which of the
four behaviour inconsistency matrices we examine. As a shorthand, we will
say such cryptocurrencies are inconsistent with respect to behaviour. The time
inconsistency matrices reveal cryptocurrencies that have been anomalously impacted by the emergence of COVID-19. This may pertain to its extreme or
erratic behaviour of its log returns or variance, depending on which of the four
time inconsistency matrices we examine. We will say such cryptocurrencies are
inconsistent with respect to time.
We reveal inconsistent cryptocurrencies as follows. Assume the cryptocurrencies are given some ordering j = 1, ..., n. Given any inconsistency matrix
INC of the
Pneight above, define the anomaly score of the j-th cryptocurrency
as aj = j=1 |INCij |. Larger values indicate cryptocurrencies that are more
anomalous between the two affinity matrices under consideration (recall that
every inconsistency matrix is the difference of two affinity matrices). In Section
3, we highlight the top 3 cryptocurrencies across a range of these inconsistency
matrices to determine the most prominent anomalies. We have chosen to list the
top 3 for ease of interpreting the results, and to point out that examining the
most inconsistent cryptocurrencies reveals a considerable number of repetitions that is, certain cryptocurrencies that are inconsistent in one regard frequently
are inconsistent in other regards.
3. Experimental results and discussion
We draw data from Coinmarketcap. Of the cryptocurrencies with price
histories that go as far back as 30-06-2018, we analyse the 51 largest by market
capitalisation. These are all detailed in Table A.3, ordered by decreasing market
capitalisation. For each cryptocurrency, we draw closing price, daily high, and
daily low, and first calculate the log returns and Parkinson variance as defined
in (1) and (2). In the proceeding sections, we report a broad range of findings on
the contrasting impact COVID-19 has had on the extreme and erratic behaviour
of cryptocurrency returns and variance, and the identification of inconsistencies
in various cryptocurrency behaviours. We refer to the period from 30-06-2018
to 31-12-2019 as “pre-COVID” and the period from 1-1-2020 to 24-06-2020 as
“post-COVID.”
We have chosen these periods deliberately to study the impact of the COVID19 epidemiological crisis on financial assets, specifically on the cryptocurrency
market. The post-COVID period can be characterised as a systemic crisis
across all asset classes, while the pre-COVID period was relatively stable, with
consistently positive returns across equity markets in 2019. Market crises refer
to market crashes that impact all asset classes rather than individual drops in
assets, even if they are precipitous.
This is not to say that there was not some drawdown within the cryptocurrency market during 2019, nor that all volatility during the post-COVID period
7

can be explained by the pandemic. Indeed, the crash of the BitMEX exchange
market crash in March 2020 caused profound losses in Bitcoin [55]. However, the
pre-COVID and post-COVID periods are distinct in nature - the latter is characterised by the emergence of COVID-19 around the world and with subsequent
crises in various equities and economic measures. Generally speaking, we are
interested in studying the impact of broader financial crises on cryptocurrencies.
The periods are of different length, however this is appropriate given that
all constructions in Section 2 are normalised with respect to time. Moreover,
such a difference in lengths between crisis and non-crisis periods is inevitable.
Historically, financial markets have exhibited a tendency for collective asset prices
to rise slowly during “bull” markets and drop more quickly during “bear” markets.
For example, The Dow Jones Industrial Average exhibited losses of -22.61% on
19-10-1987 (Black Monday), -7.87% on 15-10-2008 (the Global Financial Crisis),
and -9.99% on 12-03-2020 (Black Thursday) [56]. Accordingly, we have chosen
to study a shorter period of time as our crisis period to more accurately reflect
the market dynamics during the crash.
3.1. COVID-19 impact on market dynamics
In this first section, we study the cryptocurrency market dynamics over
time as a whole, without reference to the internal similarity between distinct
cryptocurrencies. We use the same 51 cryptocurrencies as elsewhere in the paper,
listed in Table A.3. In Figures 1a and 1b, we depict the Frobenius norms ||Rt ||
and ||Σt ||, respectively, defined in Section 2.3. Larger magnitudes indicate more
unstable market dynamics, characterised by greater total returns and variance,
regardless of direction. These figures reveal several insights: first, during 2018
and 2019, the Parkinson variance exhibits less regular peaks than the log returns,
but relative to the baseline these peaks are more significant. These peaks also
appear to occur more periodically than that of returns, with our measure possibly
highlighting some latent volatility clustering. Second, the sharpest peak of each
figure is coincident: anomalously large changes in returns are accompanied by
proportionally large changes in variance at the same time. The day of greatest
changes in returns and volatility is 12 March, 2020. Known as Black Thursday
[56], this was the worst crash of the Dow Jones since 1987, and caused substantial
drops across all sectors. On the exact same day, the cryptocurrency exchange
BitMEX crashed, causing a substantial drop in the price of Bitcoin. After this
greatest spike, both measures drop to levels below their 30-month average. That
is, after this point, the volatility of the market is in fact reduced relative to the
previous year.
3.2. Changing dynamics of extreme and erratic behaviour
In this section, we analyse the distance matrices between distribution extremities and structural breaks for the four time series under consideration, that is,
log returns and Parkinson variance before and after the emergence of COVID-19.
Specifically, we examine the Frobenius norms, defined in Section 2.3, of the
eight distance matrices defined in the same section. Greater Frobenius norms

indicate greater overall distances and hence less self-similarity among a collection
of cryptocurrencies. This reveals several insights:
First, both before and during COVID-19, the behaviour of cryptocurrencies is
more self-similar (measured by Frobenius matrix norms) with respect to variance
than returns. This is true for both distribution extremities and structural breaks,
heralding extreme and erratic behaviour, respectively. This can be seen in the
consistently smaller values in Tables 1 and 2, where Frobenius norms, defined
in Section 2.3, are computed. All distances in question, and hence the matrix
norms, are normalised, so this comparison is appropriate when comparing either
distribution extremities or structural breaks among themselves.
Next, the post-COVID period generally exhibits less similarity (measured
by the Frobenius norms) in the cryptocurrency market than before COVID-19.
Comparing distribution extremities and structural breaks with respect to the
log returns and variance time series, three of these distance matrices exhibit
greater Frobenius norm for the post-COVID period. Only the structural breaks
in returns observe a slight decrease in Frobenius norm, implying greater selfsimilarity with respect to structural breaks of returns, in the post-COVID period.
By contrast, the Frobenius norm for structural breaks in variance has increased
almost threefold. Indeed, this is reflected in Figure 2. As we will discuss further
in Section 3.3, Figure 2a shows essentially one cluster, broad self-similarity and
no outlier elements between structural breaks with respect to variance, while
Figure 2b has less self-similarity - rather, several anomalous elements are visible
in the dendrogram.
On the other hand, for the Frobenius norms of distribution extremities, a
moderate and similar increase was observed for both returns and variance. That
is, the total similarity (measured by Frobenius norms) in return and variance
extremes decreased by a similar amount due to COVID-19. The slight increase
in Frobenius norm for distribution extremities of variance contrasts with the
large increase in the case of structural breaks; while the increase in norms for
log returns contrasts with the decrease in the case of breaks.

10

3.3. Structural breaks with respect to Parkinson variance
In this section, we take a closer look at the structure of the cryptocurrency
market with respect to structural breaks in Parkinson variance. In Figure 2, we
depict the results of hierarchical clustering of the corresponding affinity matrices
BV
ABV
pre and Apost . This supports our analysis in the preceding section. There are
two types of hierarchical clustering: agglomerative (bottom-up) and divisive
(top-down) clustering. The former starts with each object defined as a single
element cluster and sequentially combines the most similar clusters into a larger
cluster, until there is only one cluster. The latter works by sequentially splitting
the most heterogeneous cluster in two, until each cluster contains only a single
element. Our experiments apply agglomerative hierarchical clustering. Unlike
K-means clustering, hierarchical clustering does not require a specific number
of clusters k to be set, and the procedure generates an image of the cluster
structure. Tree colors are determined by the dendrogram, which computes the
optimal trade-off between the number of clusters and total error. An ideal fit
would have fewer clusters and smaller error. More details are provided in [57, 58].
Figure 2a exhibits essentially one amorphous cluster lacking any visible
structure, with no notable outliers and a high degree of self-similarity. The
complete lack of subclusters represents the significant risk for investors in the
cryptocurrency market even during normal times. Indeed, there is really no way
to diversify against erratic behaviour in volatility, as all cryptocurrencies have
highly similar structural breaks, and this exposes investors to simultaneous drawdown risk among any held collection of cryptocurrencies. After the emergence of
COVID-19, we see a considerable change in market structure, displayed in Figure
2b. There, two primary clusters of cryptocurrencies are observed. Within the
smaller cluster, a subcluster of high similarity emerges containing cryptocurrencies such as Chainlink (LINK) and Tezos (XTZ). Several slight outliers emerge:
Maker (MKR), Tether (USDT) and Zcash (ZEC). All cryptocurrency tickers
are indexed in Table A.3. That is, the emergence of COVID-19 has significantly
altered the market structure with respect to structural breaks in variance, from
one highly homogeneous cluster with no outliers, to two clusters with some
subcluster structure and slight outliers.
3.4. Distribution extremities with respect to log returns
In this section, we analyse the impact of COVID-19 on the distribution
extremities of the log returns. Analysis of the corresponding affinity matrices
ER
AER
pre and Apost reveals more pronounced structure after the emergence of COVID19. Hierarchical clustering of these matrices is displayed in Figures 3a and 3b.
These dendrograms each highlight two outliers, Tether (USDT) and TrueUSD
(TUSD), consistent before and during COVID-19. Both these cryptocurrencies
are highly anomalous with respect to their log returns distribution extremities,
which is likely due to their low volume of trading and their being pegged to the
US dollar in a one-to-one ratio.
Indeed, in Figure 4, we depict the distribution extremities of their log returns
alongside two cryptocurrencies in the majority cluster, Bitcoin (BTC) and

Ethereum (ETH). Comparing Figures 4a and 4b with Figures 4c and 4d, we see
almost a tenfold difference in scale in the log returns. Similar behaviour occurs
after the emergence of COVID-19 in Figures 4e, 4f, 4g and 4h. Moreover, USDT
and TUSD’s distributions in 4e and 4f, respectively, lack the asymmetry and
negative skew observed for BTC and ETH in 4g and 4h. The distributions of
BTC and ETH, which are representative of the extreme return behaviours of
most cryptocurrencies, highlight the negative skew securities usually experience
during times of market crisis.
We note that USDT and TUSD did not stand out as clear outliers, nor did
they cluster together, in Figure 2, the focus of Section 3.3. Although USDT
and TUSD’s price movements are highly anomalous and similar to each other
in scale, which distinguishes them as outliers in their distribution extremities,
the same does not hold for their structural breaks. Indeed, most change point
algorithms, including the one that we implement, are independent of scale. They
seek to identify points at which the properties of a given time series change. We
apply the same change point algorithm independently to each cryptocurrency,
so there is no reason that the two cryptocurrencies with the narrowest scale
should have similar structural breaks. This shows that TUSD and USDT, while
moving much more narrowly than other currencies and hence exhibiting much
less extreme behaviour, do not necessarily exhibit similar erratic behaviour.
Next, we treat USDT and TUSD as outliers and analyse the collection after
removing them, displaying this subset in Figures 5a and 5b. Figure 5a determines
four distinct clusters, two of which contain the majority of cryptocurrencies. In
Figure 5b, which depicts the post-COVID period, all but two cryptocurrencies,
Aave (LEND) and DigiByte (DGB), belong to one dominant cluster, which
contains several subclusters of high similarity. The difference in the number of
clusters and structure of these dendrograms highlights the significant impact
COVID-19 has had on extreme return behaviours.
Next, we take a closer look at the cluster structure of the return extremes.
First we note that USDT and TUSD were removed from the collection due to their
considerably lesser scale in distribution extremities. Statistically, this reflects
their much smaller variance and kurtosis than all other cryptocurrencies. To
study the remainder of the collection, which have similar scale in their distribution
extremities, we use the mean of these restricted distributions instead, as defined
in Section 2.1. We see that the means have a significant relationship with the
cluster structure of the sub-collection in both periods:
1. Before COVID-19, Figure 5a identifies four distinct clusters. After inspection of the dendrogram and Figure 3a, we see that these four naturally fit
into two larger clusters: one containing BTC and ETH among others, and
one containing HOT and LEND, among others. Computing the means of
these two clusters reveals a relationship: the four largest values of E(νi )
all lie in the second cluster, and the average of the means Ei E(νi ) is
greater than the mean of the first cluster under a simple statistical test,
with p < 0.05. Such measures of statistical significance are not necessarily
dispositive of a meaningful relationship [59], but ordering the means of
16

the restricted distributions shows that the latter cluster contains more
restricted distributions with positive mean, including the greatest four.
2. During COVID-19, excluding outliers USDT and TUSD, the two anomalous
cryptocurrencies LEND and DGB have the two greatest means E(νi ) of
the entire post-COVID collection. That is, the mean E(νi ) is once again
significantly related to the cluster structure.
3. Before COVID-19, 88% of cryptocurrencies had an negative value of E(νi ).
After the emergence of COVID-19, just 37% of cryptocurrencies had a
negative mean. That is, a majority of post-COVID return extremes had
a positive mean. This is an unexpected result and demonstrates that
although there was a sharp initial drop in returns due to COVID-19, this
behaviour was anomalous relative to the rest of the post-COVID period.
3.5. Identification of cryptocurrency anomalies
In this section, we focus on identifying two types of anomalies within the
cryptocurrency market - cryptocurrencies that are inconsistent between extreme
and erratic behaviour, or inconsistent with respect to time. As defined in Section 2.4, we use the shorthand inconsistent with respect to behaviour to mean
that a cryptocurrency is irregular with respect to the rest of the market in the
comparison between extreme and erratic behaviour, and detect this through our
behaviour inconsistency matrices, also defined in Section 2.4. Similarly, we have
the shorthand inconsistent with respect to time, which describes cryptocurrencies
whose behaviour changed significantly in the period of COVID-19. Each inconsistency matrix assigns anomaly scores, which can rank the most inconsistent
cryptocurrencies in either regard. We list the top 3 most inconsistent cryptocurrencies pertaining to a range of inconsistency matrices. We have chosen to list
the top 3 for ease of interpreting the results, and to point out that examining the
most inconsistent cryptocurrencies reveals a considerable number of repetitions that is, certain cryptocurrencies that are inconsistent in one regard frequently
are inconsistent in other regards.
pre,V
First, we study the behaviour inconsistency matrices INCpre,R
bhvr , INCbhvr ,
post,V
INCpost,R
bhvr , INCbhvr . We implement hierarchical clustering in Figures 6 and
7 to highlight clusters in returns and variance, and compute anomaly scores.
The behaviour inconsistency dendrogram for pre-COVID returns is displayed in
Figure 6a and reveals a separate cluster of Holo (HOT), 0x (ZRX) and Aave
(LEND). Computing anomaly scores reveals that the top 3 most inconsistent
cryptocurrencies with respect to differing behaviour are HOT, ZRX and Maker
(MKR) - LEND is fourth. The anomaly scores may give slightly different
results than the hierarchical clustering because the anomaly scores feature
absolute values to calculate absolute differences with other elements, while the
dendrograms cluster based on the positive or negative values of the inconsistency
matrix. Rows or columns with negative entries may indicate cryptocurrencies of
similar behaviour that should be clustered together, but might not necessarily
distinguish the most absolutely inconsistent entries of the collection. The
17

behaviour inconsistency matrix with respect to post-COVID returns is clustered
in Figure 6b. NEXO (NEXO), USDT and TUSD form their own cluster; the
top 3 anomaly scores are of NEXO, THETA (THETA) and MKR.
When analysing inconsistency matrices between extreme and erratic behaviour
of variance, we observe the repetition of inconsistent cryptocurrencies - the top
3 anomaly scores for the pre-COVID variance behaviour inconsistency matrix
are of NEM (XEM), NEXO and MKR, while MonaCoin (MONA), Ravencoin
(RVN) and Bitcoin Diamond (BCD) form a separate cluster. Observing the
dendrograms in Figures 7a and 7b side by side, slightly more structure is observed
in the post-COVID period, with a growth in the total number of clusters. USDT
and TUSD emerge as inconsistent in their behaviour after the emergence of
COVID-19. Indeed, before COVID-19, both their distribution extremities and
structural breaks are outliers, leading to relative consistency between the two
behaviours, while during COVID-19, their structural breaks in variance become
similar to the rest of the market.
Time inconsistency matrices are clustered in Figures 8 and 9 and anomaly
scores computed again. Dendrograms for returns and variance extremes, displayed in Figures 8a and 8b, are dominated by one cluster - with each inconsistency matrix producing one clearly anomalous cryptocurrency, DigiByte (DGBP
and BCD respectively. The top 3 anomaly scorers for these inconsistency matrices are DGB, RVN and HOT, and BCD, MKR and DGB, respectively. We see
the repetition of inconsistent cryptocurrencies from prior experiments. This is
also the case for structural breaks: the top 3 anomalies for structural breaks in
returns are USDT, TUSD and HOT, while NEXO and XEM are the second and
third most inconsistent cryptocurrencies across time with respect to structural
breaks in variance. That is, we see consistent repetition in the cryptocurrencies
that are inconsistent between extreme and erratic behaviours and those which
were most affected across time by COVID-19.
4. Conclusion
In this paper, we have developed new methods for the study of extreme and
erratic behaviours of time series, both individually and in collections. Our work
extends the new distance measures between finite sets proposed in [46]. We
introduce inconsistency matrices and anomaly scores for identification of elements
that are inconsistent with respect to behaviour and time. Such methodology
to study extreme behaviour complements the work of [47, 48, 49], who have
developed machine learning methods in other applications.
Applied to the cryptocurrency market, we have uncovered several insights
and dissimilarities when studying the behaviour patterns of returns and variance.
In general, cryptocurrency behaviour is more self-similar in variance than returns,
both before and during the pandemic. Before COVID-19, the cryptocurrency
market exhibited considerable homogeneity with respect to the structural breaks
in variance. This was disrupted by the pandemic, with a reduction in selfsimilarity, reflected in the comparison of Frobenius norms and the emergence of
outliers in hierarchical clustering. COVID-19 also had an impact on the return

extremes, with an unexpected shift towards positive average means among the
distribution extremities. Relatively little impact on the structural breaks in
returns was observed.
Our analysis highlights several anomalies in extreme and erratic behaviour
over time, most notably, USDT and TUSD. Both cryptocurrencies exhibit
unusually docile profiles for extreme behaviours, likely due to their thin trading
structure and lack of market liquidity. Excluding these, several cryptocurrencies
repeatedly appeared to be inconsistent between extreme and erratic behaviour
and inconsistent over time, namely HOT, NEXO, MKR and XEM, each of which
features in the top 3 anomaly scores for at least one inconsistency matrix with
respect to time and behaviour.
The precise methodology and applications described in this paper are not an
exhaustive representation of the utility of this method. These methods could be
used to study structure and identify anomalies among collections of time series
in other applications within nonlinear dynamics and with respect to aspects of
nonlinearity other than extreme and erratic behaviour.

Appendix B. Change point detection algorithm
In this section, we provide an outline of change point detection algorithms, and
describe the specific algorithm that we implement. Many statistical modelling
problems require the identification of change points in sequential data. By
definition, these are points in time at which the statistical properties of a time
series change. The general setup for this problem is the following: a sequence
of observations x1 , x2 , ..., xn are drawn from random variables X1 , X2 , ..., Xn
and undergo an unknown number of changes in distribution at points τ1 , ..., τm .
One assumes observations are independent and identically distributed between
change points, that is, between each change points a random sampling of the
distribution is occurring. Following Ross [53], we notate this as follows:

F0 if i ≤ τ1



F if τ < i ≤ τ
1
1
2
Xi ∼

F
if
τ
<
i
≤
τ
2
2
3,



...
While this requirement of independence may appear restrictive, dependence can
generally be accounted for by modelling the underlying dynamics or drift process,
then applying a change point algorithm to the model residuals or one-step-ahead
prediction errors, as described by Gustafsson [60]. The change point models
applied in this paper follow Ross [53].

25

Appendix B.1. Batch change detection (Phase I)
This phase of change point detection is retrospective. We are given a fixed
length sequence of observations x1 , . . . , xn from random variables X1 , . . . , Xn .
For simplicity, assume at most one change point exists. If a change point exists
at time k, observations have a distribution of F0 prior to the change point, and
a distribution of F1 proceeding the change point, where F0 6= F1 . That is, one
must test between the following two hypotheses for each k:
H0 : Xi ∼ F0 , i = 1, ..., n
(
F0 i = 1, 2, ..., k
H1 : Xi ∼
F1 , i = k + 1, k + 2, ..., n
and end with the choice of the most suitable k.
One proceeds with a two-sample hypothesis test, where the choice of test
is dependent on the assumptions about the underlying distributions. To avoid
distributional assumptions, non-parametric tests can be used. Then one appropriately chooses a two-sample test statistic Dk,n and a threshold hk,n . If
Dk,n > hk,n then the null hypothesis is rejected and we provisionally assume that
a change point has occurred after xk . These test statistics Dk,n are normalised
to have mean 0 and variance 1 and evaluated at all values 1 < k < n, and the
largest value is assumed to be coincident with the existence of our sole change
point. That is, the test statistic is then
Dn =

max

k=2,...,n−1

Dk,n =

max

k=2,...,n−1

D̃k,n − µD̃k,n
σD̃k,n

where D̃k,n were our unnormalised statistics. This test statistic is known as the
Mann-Whitney test [53].
The null hypothesis of no change is then rejected if Dn > hn for some
appropriately chosen threshold hn . In this circumstance, we conclude that a
(unique) change point has occurred and its location is the value of k which
maximises Dk,n . That is,
τ̂ = argmax Dk,n .
k

This threshold hn is chosen to bound the Type 1 error rate as is standard in
statistical hypothesis testing. First, one specifies an acceptable level α for the
proportion of false positives, that is, the probability of falsely declaring that a
change has occurred if in fact no change has occurred. Then, hn should be chosen
as the upper α quantile of the distribution of Dn under the null hypothesis. For
the details of computation of this distribution, see [53]. Computation can often
be made easier by taking appropriate choice and storage of the Dk,n .

26

Appendix B.2. Sequential change detection (Phase II)
In this case, the sequence (xt )t≥1 does not have a fixed length. New observations are received over time, and multiple change points may be present.
Assuming no change point exists so far, this approach treats x1 , ..., xt as a fixed
length sequence and computes Dt as in phase I. A change is then flagged if
Dt > ht for some appropriately chosen threshold. If no change is detected, the
next observation xt+1 is brought into the sequence. If a change is detected, the
process restarts from the following observation in the sequence. The procedure
therefore consists of a repeated sequence of hypothesis tests.
In this sequential setting, ht is chosen so that the probability of incurring
a Type 1 error is constant over time, so that under the null hypothesis of no
change, the following holds:
P (D1 > h1 ) = α,
P (Dt > ht |Dt−1 ≤ ht−1 , ..., D1 ≤ h1 ) = α, t > 1.
In this case, assuming that no change occurs, the average number of observations
received before a false positive detection occurs is equal to α1 . This quantity
is referred to as the average run length, or ARL0. Once again, there are
computational difficulties with this conditional distribution and the appropriate
values of ht , as detailed in Ross [53].
