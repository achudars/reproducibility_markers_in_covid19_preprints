The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) began as an outbreak from epicentre Wuhan, People’s Republic of China in late December 2019, and till June 27, 2020 it caused 9,904,906 infections
and 496,866 deaths worldwide. The world health organization (WHO) already declared this disease a
pandemic. Researchers from various domains are putting their efforts to curb the spread of coronavirus
via means of medical treatment and data analytics. In recent years, several research articles have been
published in the field of coronavirus caused diseases like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS),
middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) and COVID-19. In the presence of numerous research
articles, extracting best-suited articles is time-consuming and manually impractical. The objective of
this paper is to extract the activity and trends of coronavirus related research articles using machine
learning approaches to help the research community for future exploration concerning COVID-19
prevention and treatment techniques. The COVID-19 open research dataset (CORD-19) is used for
experiments, whereas several target-tasks along with explanations are defined for classification, based
on domain knowledge. Clustering techniques are used to create the different clusters of available articles, and later the task assignment is performed using parallel one-class support vector machines
(OCSVMs). These defined tasks describes the behaviour of clusters to accomplish target-class guided
mining. Experiments with original and reduced features validate the performance of the approach. It
is evident that the k-means clustering algorithm, followed by parallel OCSVMs, outperforms other
methods for both original and reduced feature space.

1. Introduction
Coronaviruses are a large family of deadly viruses that
may cause critical respiratory diseases to the human being.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is the first known
life-threatening epidemic, occurred in 2003, whereas the second outbreak reported in 2012 in Saudi Arabia with the middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS). The current outbreak
is reported in Wuhan, China during late December 2019 [41].
On January 30, 2020, the world health organization (WHO)
declared it a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) as it had spread to more than 18 countries [44]
and on Feb 11, 2020, WHO named this “COVID-19”. On
March 11, 2020, as the number of COVID-19 cases reaches
to 118,000 in 114 countries and over 4,000 deaths, WHO
declared this a pandemic.
Several research articles have been published on coronavirus caused diseases after 2003 till date. These articles belong to diverse domains like medicine and healthcare, data
mining, pattern recognition, machine learning, etc. Manual
extraction of the research papers of an individualâĂŹs interest is a time consuming and impractical task in the presence of enormous research articles. More specifically, a researcher looks for a target class guided solution, i.e., the
researcher seeks for a cluster of research articles meeting
his/her area of interest. To accomplish this task, this paper proposes a cluster-based parallel OCSVM [40] approach.

The cluster techniques are used to group the articles properly so that the articles in the same group are more similar to
each other than to those in other clusters, whereas multiple
OCSVMs are trained using individual cluster information.
For experiments, a set of target-tasks is defined from the domain knowledge to generalize the nature of all articles, and
these tasks will become the cluster representatives. To assign the target-tasks to the clusters, OCSVM plays a decisive
role.
The clustering and classification problems are essential
and admired topics of research in the area of pattern recognition and data mining. The conventional binary and multiclass classifiers are surely not suitable for this target-task
mining task because, in this unsupervised learning mode,
it is always possible that some of the clusters may not be
assigned with any target-class, whereas an increase in the
number of target-tasks to solve this problem leads to generation of duplicate information. These conventional classifiers work fine in the presence of at least two well-defined
classes but may become biased, if the dataset suffers from
data irregularity problems (imbalanced classes, small disjunct, skewed class distribution, missing values, etc.). Specially, when a class is ill-defined, the classifier may give biased outcome. Firstly, Minter [34] observed this problem
and termed it “single-class classification”, and later, Koch
et al. [22] named this fact “one-class classification” (OCC).
Subsequently, researchers used different terms based on the
application domain to which one-class classification was applied, like “outlier detection” [37], “novelty detection” [5]
and “concept learning” [16]. In OCC problems, the target
class samples are well-defined and the outliers are poorly

defined which make decision boundary detection a difficult
problem.
For OCC, many machine-learning algorithms have been
proposed like: one-class random forest (OCRF), one-class
deep neural network (OCDNN), one-class nearest neighbours
(OCNN), one-class support vector classifiers (OCSVCs), etc.
[29], [36], [19], [7], [1], [2]. The benifit of OCSVCs over
other state-of-the-art OCC techniques is its work-ability with
only positive class samples whereas the other methods need
negative class samples too for smooth operation, hence the
OCSVCs are found more suitable for this research. Based on
extensive literature review, it is evident that OCSVMs (a type
of OCSVC) are mostly used for novelty/anomaly detection
in various application domains such as intrusion detection
[20], [27], fraud detection [15], [10] disease diagnosis [43],
[8] novelty detection [46] and document classification [28].
These assorted applicability make OCSVMs very interesting and important. Though many research articles have been
published concerning OCSVM during the last two decades,
still, it is not applied and tested for research article mining
task. In this paper, OCSVM is used along with clustering
techniques for article categorization, and results show that
this approach gives promising performance.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: section
2 discusses the related work in this field and details of the
dataset used. The proposed model is discussed in section 3
and section 4 briefs the experimental setup and results. Finally, the conclusion is discussed in section 5.

2. Related Work
Document classification is an admired area of research
in pattern recognition and data mining. In the present era,
the presence of massive online research repositories makes
the search of research articles of a user’s interest, a timeconsuming process. Several web search engines [39] are
available to search keywords related documents on the web.
It is observed that, still, the target class guided information
retrieval from the internet is a challenging task. Specifically, for a researcher, it is a very difficult task to extract only
the related articles satisfying or meeting his/her objectives.
This paper proposes a novel cluster-based parallel one-class
classification model to assign the most promising tasks to a
group of relevant articles in available repository. The experiments have been performed with original and reduced features to justify the computational benefit of low-dimensional
features. This section briefs the relevant background of datapreprocessing, clustering, one-class classification, and dimensionality reduction techniques, along with the published
papers related to COVID-19 for research article mining techniques using CORD-19 dataset.

2.1. Data-preprocessing for text mining
Document embeddings help to extract richer semantic
content for document classification in text mining applications [13], [9]. Numeric representation of text documents
is a challenging task in various applications such as document retrieval, web search, spam filtering, topic modeling,
SK Sonbhadra et al.: Preprint submitted to Elsevier

etc. In 1972, Jones [38] proposed a technique known as
term frequency-inverse document frequency (Tf-idf). Tfidf is a technique of information retrieval and text mining
that uses a weight, which is a statistical measure to calculate the importance of a word within a document corpus. It
is a frequency-based measure, and its significance increases
proportionally as the frequency of the word in the corpus increases. Later, Bengio et al. [3] proposed a feed-forward
neural network language model for word embedding. Later,
a simpler and more effective neural architecture was developed to learn word vectors, word2vec by Mikolov et al. [33],
where the objective functions produce high-quality vectors.
Recently, doc2vec as an extension of word2vec has been provided by Mikolov et al. [32] to implement document-level
embeddings. This technique is designed to work with the
different granularity of the word sequences such as word ngram, sentence, paragraph or document level. Avinash et al.
[17] performed intensive experiments on multiple datasets
and observed that doc2vec method performs better than TFidf. In this paper, doc2vec is used to generate features of the
research documents and defined tasks. The generated features are further used in other components of the proposed
model for clustering and classification.

2.2. Clustering techniques
Clustering is an unsupervised learning approach used iteratively to create groups of relatively similar samples from
the population. In this research, following three clustering
techniques have been used to create the clusters of the available samples (research articles):
• k-means
• Density-based spatial clustering of applications with
noise (DBSCAN)
• Hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC)
The k-means algorithm is a popular clustering technique
that aims to divide the data samples into k pre-defined distinct non-overlapping subgroups, where each data point belongs to only one group. It keeps inter-cluster data points
similar to each other and also tries to maximize the distance
between two clusters [6]. DBSCAN is a data clustering algorithm proposed by Martin et al. [12]. It is a non-parametric
algorithm based on the concept of the nearest neighbour. It
considers a set of points in some space and identifies groups
of close data points as nearest neighbours and also identifies outliers to the points which are away from their neighbors. HAC [35] is a “bottom-up” approach in which each
data point is initially considered as a single-element cluster.
Later, in the next steps, the two similar clusters are merged
to form a bigger cluster, and subsequently, converges to a
single cluster. Experiments have been performed on CORD19 dataset using above mentioned clustering algorithms, and
the objective is to find the best cluster representation of the
whole sample space.

A test sample 𝑥 is classified as an outlier if the description value is not smaller than 𝐶. SVDD can also be expanded
using kernels. Thus, the problem can be formulated as follows:
(3)

‖𝜑(𝑥) − 𝑎‖2 ≤ 𝑅2
The output of the SVDD can be calculated as follows:

(4)

𝑅2 − ‖𝜑(𝑥) − 𝑎‖2
Figure 1: Support Vector Data Description (SVDD).

2.3. One-class classification
One-class classification (OCC) algorithms are suitable
when the negative class is either absent, poorly sampled or
ill-defined. The objective of OCC is to maximize the learning ability using only the target class samples. The conventional classifiers need at least two well-defined classes for
healthy operation but give biased results, if the test sample is an outlier. As a solution to this problem, the oneclass classification techniques are used, majorly applicable
for outliers/novelty detection and concept learning [18]. In
this research, parallel one-class support vector machines are
used for target-tasks assignment.
Tax et al. [42] solved the OCC problem by separating
the target class objects from other samples in sample space,
and proposed a model called support vector data description
(SVDD), where target class samples are enclosed by a hypersphere, where the data points at decision boundary are
treated as support vectors. The SVDD rejects a test sample
as an outlier, if it falls outside of the hypersphere; otherwise
accepts it as a target class sample, as shown in Fig. 1. The
objective function of SVDD is defined as:
∑
∑
𝛼𝑖 {𝑅2 + 𝜉𝑖
𝜉𝑖 −
𝐿(𝑅, 𝑎, 𝛼𝑖 , 𝛾𝑖 , 𝜉𝑖 ) = 𝑅2 + 𝐶

subject to: ∥ 𝑥𝑖 − 𝑎 ∥2 ≤ 𝑅2 + 𝜉𝑖 , 𝑤ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒 𝜉𝑖 ≥ 0 ∀ i

In Eq. 4, the output is positive if the sample is inside the
boundary, whereas for an outlier the output becomes negative.
Schlökopf et al. [40] proposed an alternative approach
(named one-class support vector machine (OCSVM)) to SVDD
by separating the target class samples from outliers using a
hyperplane instead of creating hypersphere (Fig. 2). In this
approach, the target class samples are separated by a hyperplane with the maximal margin from the origin and all negative class samples are assumed to fall on the subspace of the
origin. This algorithm returns value +1 for target class region and -1 elsewhere. Following quadratic equation 5 must
be solved to separate the target class samples from the origin:

where 𝜙 represents a point 𝑥𝑖 in feature space and 𝜉𝑖 is the
slack variable to penalize the outlier. The objective is to find
a hyperplane characterized by 𝜔 and 𝜌 to separate the target
data points from the origin with maximum margin. Lower
bound on the number of support vectors and upper bound on
the fraction of outliers are set by 𝜐 𝜖 (0,1]. Experimental results of this research ensures that for OCSVM, the Gaussian
kernel outperforms other kernels.
The dual optimization problem of Eq. 5 is defined as follows:
1 ∑∑
𝛼 𝛼 𝐾(𝑥𝑖 , 𝑥𝑗 )
2 𝑖=1 𝑗=1 𝑖 𝑗

where 𝑅 is the radius of the hypersphere (objective is to
minimize the radius), data point 𝑥𝑖 is an outlier, a is center
of hypersphere, samples at decision boundary are support
vectors, the parameter C controls the trade-off between the
volume and the errors, and 𝜉 is the slack variable to penalize
the outlier. With the Lagrange multipliers 𝛼𝑖 ≥ 0, 𝛾𝑖 ≥ 0
and 𝑖 = 1, 2, … , 𝑁, the purpose is to minimize the hypersphereâĂŹs volume by minimizing 𝑅 to cover all target class
samples with the penalty of slack variables for outliers. By
setting partial derivatives to zero and substituting those constraints into Eq. 1,following is obtained:

Finally, the test instance 𝑥 can be labelled as follows:

where 𝑠𝑖𝑔𝑛(.) is sign function.
Both these breakthrough approaches for OCC (SVDD
and OCSVM) perform equally with Gaussian kernel and origin plays a decisive role where all the negative class data
points are pre-assumed to lie on the origin. In unit norm feature space, the margin of a hyperplane of OCSVM is equal to
the norm of the centre of SVDD is [21] as shown in Fig. 3(a).
SVDD can be reformulated by a hyperplane equation as follows:

Because data examples exist on the surface of a unit hypersphere, the sample margin has ‘0’ as the minimum value and
‘1’ as the maximum, i.e.
0 ≤ 𝛾(𝑥) ≤ 1

Also, sample margins of unbounded support vectors 𝑥𝑈 𝑆𝑉

𝛾(𝑥𝑈 𝑆𝑉 ) = 𝛾𝑂𝐶𝑆𝑉 𝑀 =

(16)
(17)

Sample margin represents the distribution of samples in
feature space. Fig. 3(c) shows the distribution of sample
margin of training data and hyperplane of OCSVM in feature space. It is also evident that the SVDD and OCSVM
perform equally with RBF kernel. In the present research
work, OCSVM is used for experiments.

2.4. Dimensionality reduction
∥ 𝜙(𝑥) − 𝑎 ∥2 ≤ 𝑅2 ⇔ 𝑤𝑆𝑉 𝐷𝐷 .𝜙(𝑥) − 𝜌𝑆𝑉 𝐷𝐷 ≥ 0 (11)
where a is the centre of SVDD hypersphere. The normal

defined as below:
𝑤𝑆𝑉 𝐷𝐷 =

𝑎
,
∥𝑎∥

𝜌𝑆𝑉 𝐷𝐷 =∥ 𝑎 ∥

(12)

In feature space, the virtual hyperplane passes through
the origin and the sample margin is defined by its distance
from the image of the data x as shown in Fig. 3(b). The
sample margin in SVDD can be defined as below:
𝛾𝑆𝑉 𝐷𝐷 (𝑥) =

𝑎.𝜙(𝑥)
∥𝑎∥

(13)

where 𝑎 is the centre of SVDDâĂŹs hypersphere and y(x) is
the image of data x in feature space. In OCSVM, the sample
margin is defined as follows:

The research articles are associated with massive features and all are not equally important that leads to the curse
of dimensionality. In this paper, doc2vec technique is used
to generate features for experiments. Reduced features obtained by applying the following dimensionality reduction
(DR) techniques are also used for experiments aiming to reduce the computation cost without affecting the performance:
• Principal component analysis (PCA)
• Isometric Mapping (ISOMAP)
• t-distributed stochastic neighbor (t-SNE)
• Uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP)
Principal component analysis [45] is a linear DR technique
that extracts the dominant features from the data. PCA generates a lower-dimensional representation of the data and describes the maximum variance in the data as possible. This is
done by finding a linear basis of reduced dimensionality for
the data, in which the amount of variance in the data is maximal. ISOMAP is a nonlinear DR technique for manifold
learning that uses geodesic distances to generate features by
using transformation from a larger to smaller metric space
[4].

t-SNE works as an unsupervised, non-linear technique
mainly supports data exploration and visualization in a highdimensional space. It calculates a similarity count between
pairs of instances in the high dimensional and low dimensional space and then optimizes these two similarity counts
using a cost function [26]. Whereas, UMAP supports effective data visualization based on Riemannian geometry and
algebraic topology with excellent run time performance as
compared to other techniques [30].

2.5. Recent researches on CORD-19 dataset
The COVID-19 open research dataset (CORD-19) [23]
is prepared by White House in partnership with leading research groups characterizing the wide range of literature related to coronavirus. It consists of 45,000 scholarly articles, within 33,000 articles are full text about various categories of coronavirus. The dataset is a collection of commercial, noncommercial, custom licensed and bioRxiv/medRxiv
subsets of documents from multiple repositories contributed
by various research groups all over the world. The CORD19 dataset is hosted by kaggle, consists of a set of useful
questions about disease spread in order to find out information regarding its origin, causes, transmission, diagnostic, etc. These questions can motivate researchers to explore preceding epidemiological studies to have better planning of preventive measures under present circumstances of
COVID-19 disease outbreak. This dataset is aimed to cater
the global research community, an opportunity to perform
machine learning, data mining and natural language processing tasks to explore the hidden insights within it and utilize
the knowledge to tackle this pandemic worldwide. Thus,
there is an utmost need to explore the literature with minimum time and effort so that all possible solutions related to
the worldwide pandemic could be achieved.
In a research initiative, Wang et al. [31] generated a
named entity recognition (NER) based dataset from CORD19 corpus (2020-03-13). This derived CORD-19-NER dataset
consists of 75 categories of entities extracted from 4 different
data sources. The data generation method is a weakly supervised method and useful for text mining in both biomedical
as well as societal applications. Later, Han et al. [14] in their
research work, focused on the impact of outdoor air pollution on the immune system. The research work highlighted
that increased air pollution causes respiratory virus infection, but during the lock-down, along with social distancing and home isolation measures, air pollution gets reduced.
This research work utilizes daily confirmed COVID-19 cases
in selected cities of China, air pollution, meteorology data,
intra/inter city level movements, etc. They proposed a regression model to establish the relationship between the infection rate and other surrounding factors.
Since the entire world is suffering from the severity of
the novel coronavirus outbreak, researchers are keen to learn
more and more about coronavirus. In a research work, Dong
et al. [11] proposed a latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) based
topic modeling approach using CORD-19 dataset. This article highlights the areas with limited research; therefore,
SK Sonbhadra et al.: Preprint submitted to Elsevier

future research activities can be planned accordingly. The
corona outbreak pandemic situation demands extensive research on the corona vaccine so that we can control this outbreak. Manual methods of exploring the available literature
are time-consuming; therefore, Joshi et al. [17], proposed
deep learning-based automatic literature mining for summarization of research articles for faster access.
It is observed that mining scholarly articles is a promising area of research when enormous papers are available
concerning COVID-19. Search engines may give unrelated
articles, and therefore the overall search process becomes ineffective and time-consuming. As the overall analysis is supposed to perform in unlabeled data, the clustering technique
helps to group the related articles in an optimized way. It is
obvious that the search query is always task specific, hence
the target-tasks are defined with domain knowledge. Conventional classifiers (binary or multi-class) may give biased
results and never ensure task-specific classification, thus parallel one-class SVMs are used for target-task assignment to
clusters. This method helps the researchers to instantly find
the desired research articles more precisely. For experiments,
the CORD-19 dataset is used to validate the performance of
the proposed approach.

3. Proposed Methodology
This research work offers a bottom-up approach to mine
the COVID-19 articles concerning the target-tasks. These
tasks are defined and prepared by domain knowledge to answer all possible queries of coronavirus related research articles. In this paper, instead of associating the articles to
address the target-tasks, the intention is to map the defined
tasks to the cluster of similar articles. The overall approach
is divided into several components, such as document embedding (DE), articles clustering (AC), dimensionality reduction (DR) and visualization, and one-class classifier (OCC)
as shown in Fig. 4
Since the abstract of a scholarly article represents the
semantic meaning of the whole article, this along with the
target-tasks are mapped onto the numeric data represented
in multi-dimensional vector space using the state-of-the-art
natural language processing (NLP) document embedding techniques such as doc2vec [24] based on distributed memory
version of paragraph vector (PV-DM) [25]. The generated
Page 5 of 12

vector spaces of the article’s abstracts are utilized to generate segregated clusters of related articles. The extensive
trials are conducted with varying clustering approaches like
k-means [6], DBSCAN [12] and HAC [35], to generate an
appropriate number of segregated clusters. The generated
clusters are also analyzed with the two-dimensional visual
representation via dimensionality reduction techniques such
as PCA [45], ISO- MAP [4], t-SNE [26], and UMAP [30].
Each of the generated clusters are parallely trained on oneclass support vector machines (OCSVM) separately. The
trained models are then utilized to associate the most appropriate articles for the concerned required information (targettask). Furthermore, these generated results are statistically
compared in contrast to the computational effective approach
(CEA), where in CEA, the OCSVM models are trained on
reduced clusters feature set generated using above discussed
dimensionality reduction techniques. Algorithm 1 presents
the complete process of the proposed approach.

4. Experimentation
The proposed methodology is trained and evaluated on
CORD-19 [23] dataset, retrieved on April 4, 2020. After extensive study, the articles and the target domain comprising
nine target-tasks as shown in Table 1 [23]. The details of
these tasks (not included in this article because of length)
are later explored to generate features for further processing.
These task descriptions are embedded in a high dimensional
vector space using doc2vec approach. After extensive trials it is evident that 150 features are sufficient for optimized
performance.
The doc2vec implementation is based on the PV-DM
model that is analogous to the continuous bag of words (CBOW)
approach of word2vec [25] with just an additional feature
vector representing the full article. The PV-DM model obtains the document vector by training a neural network to
predict the words from the context of vocabulary or word
vector and full doc-vector, represented as W and D [25].
Following this, the word model is trained on words 𝑤1 , 𝑤2 ,
. . . , 𝑤𝑇 , with the objective to maximize the log likelihood as
given in Eq 18. The word is predicted with probability distribution obtained using softmax activation function provided
in Eq 19. The Eq 20 indicates the hypothesis (𝑦𝑖 ) associated
with each output word (𝑖).

This approach is utilized to embed the target-tasks and
corpus of COVID-19 articles into high dimensional vector
space. Due to the small corpus of targets, instead of directly
generating the target vector space, each target query is elaborated to emphasize on the expected type of articles by adding
the appropriate semantic meaning.
The generated document vector space of the articles is
utilized by clustering approaches; k-means, DBSCAN, and
HAC. In k-means and HAC, the appropri- ate number of
clusters are set by computing the sum of squared error for
the number of clusters varying from 2 to 35. As shown in
Fig. 5(a) and 5(b), the elbow point indicates that there are
14 and 15 favourable numbers of clusters that can represent
the most related articles. Whereas DBSCAN approach considers groups of close data points (minimum sample points)
in a defined space (epsilon) as nearest neighbours without
specifying the number of clusters. Fig. 5(c) illustrates the
sum of squared error for the generated clusters with varying
epsilon value. The epsilon is kept as 2.5 due to the sudden
increase in the sum of squared error for higher values which
resulted in skewed 16 clusters of articles.
Fig. 6 presents the number of articles constituting each
cluster generated from the above discussed clustering algorithm out of which DBSCAN performs the worst due to the
sparse mapping of the articles in the cluster.
Since these clusters are featured in high dimensional space,
visualizing them in two dimensional space requires dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA, ISOMAP, etc. Later,
these reduced feature-sets are also utilized to train the OCSVMs
in order to compare the results in presence of original feature space. The clusters are visualized with the principal
components displaying highest variance. Fig. 7 illustrates
the two dimensional cluster representation from the multidimensional feature vector of subsample of articles for each
possible combination of the discussed clustering and dimensionality reduction approaches. It is evident that from the
SK Sonbhadra et al.: Preprint submitted to Elsevier

visualization shown in Fig. 7, among the utilized clustering
approaches, k-means is able to generate the meaningful clusters with better segregation and aggregation of COVID-19
articles.
There are 14, 15 and 16 numbers of clusters generated
from HAC, k-means, and DBSCAN respectively. For each
of the generated clusters, dedicated OCSVMs are trained
parallely where each OCSVM learns to confine a cluster on
the positive side of the hyperplane with a maximum margin
from the origin. The trained models are utilized to predict
the most related target queries concerning a cluster as per
Eq. 21.

𝑂𝑡 (𝑇𝑡 ) =

𝑆(𝑃 , 𝑇 ) =

(22)

where 𝑃 and 𝑇 indicate any vector space. where 𝑂𝑖 indicates the 𝑖𝑡ℎ OCSVM trained on 𝐶𝑖 cluster, and 𝑇𝑡 indicates
the target-task for which to identify the related articles. Each
predicted target domain is verified using the cosine similarity metric as given in Eq. 22 in contrast to the assigned
clusters of articles. The metric value ranges between 0 and
1, with the meaning of articles being totally different and
same respectively. Finally, the articles are sorted in the order of most relevance based on the highest cosine score. The
Table 2 presents the top five related articles and the corresponding similarity score along with the total number of articles found with the cosine score greater than 0.1, using the
OCSVMs trained on the clusters generated via k-means approach. It is also observed that the inter-cluster similarity is
always less that 0.1 that plays a significant role in target class
classification of COVID-19 based research articles.

erage performance of the trained OCSVMs by using the clusters generated from k-means, DBSCAN, and HAC in original feature space. It shows that the false negative rate is almost negligible, and ensures the robustness of the approach.
Results show that among all three clustering techniques DBSCAN sounds most promising, however due to its heavily
skewed distribution of articles in the clusters it is not a robust technique for this problem, hence k-means is observed
most suitable clustering technique to work along with parallel OCSVMs.
Furthermore, the complete procedure was repeated with
the dimensionally reduced embedding of the articles with the
concern to achieve similar or better results with less computational cost. Table 4 describes the target mapping results
on the articles vector space whose embedded feature set is
reduced from 150 to 2 dimensions. The performance of the
proposed approach is analysed in the presence of reduced
features as shown in Table 5. The results exhibit that in presSK Sonbhadra et al.: Preprint submitted to Elsevier

6. Conclusion
The pandemic environment of COVID-19 has brought
attention to the research community. Many research articles
have been published concerning the novel coronavirus. The
CORD initiative has developed a repository to record the
published COVID-19 articles with the update frequency of
a day. This article proposed a novel bottom-up target guided
approach for mining of COVID-19 articles using parallel
one-class support vector machines which are trained on the
clusters of related articles generated with the help of clustering approaches such as k-means, DBSCAN, and HAC from
the embedded vector space of COVID-19 articles generated
by doc2vec approach. With extensive trials, it was observed
that the proposed approach with reduced features produced
