Abstract
In March of 2020, many U.S. state governments encouraged or mandated restrictions on social
interactions to slow the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus SARSCoV-2 that has spread to nearly 180 countries. Estimating the effectiveness of these socialdistancing strategies is challenging because surveillance of COVID-19 has been limited, with
tests generally being prioritized for high-risk or hospitalized cases according to temporally and
regionally varying criteria. Here we show that reductions in mobility across U.S. counties with
at least 100 confirmed cases of COVID-19 led to reductions in fever incidences, as captured by
smart thermometers, after a mean lag of 6.5 days (90% within 3–10 days) that is consistent with
the incubation period of COVID-19. Furthermore, counties with larger decreases in mobility
subsequently achieved greater reductions in fevers (p < 0.01), with the notable exception of New
York City and its immediate vicinity. These results indicate that social distancing has reduced

Introduction

A new betacoronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, was identified in the city of Wuhan in China’s Hubei
Province in December, 2019 [50]. Despite efforts to contain it, the disease caused by this virus,
COVID-19, spread rapidly across Chinese provinces in January of 2020 and around the world in
February and March. As of April 19, 2020, more than 2 million confirmed cases of COVID-19
have led to over 150,000 deaths [44], with the United States (U.S.) accounting for a plurality of
both.
In the absence of an effective vaccine against the virus or a reliable treatment for COVID-19,
the primary public health strategy for slowing transmission has been to encourage or mandate
the minimization of all but essential face-to-face human interactions, known as social distancing. Such interventions seek to limit opportunities for transmission by reducing the number of
individuals exposed by each newly infected individual. That is, social distancing is intended to
decrease the reproductive number of COVID-19 [24, 26]. Implemented social distancing policies
in the United States have included closing businesses, restricting large gatherings, and encouraging or requiring residents to stay at home unless undertaking essential tasks [11]. These
strategies complement other non-pharmaceutical interventions such as contact tracing and isolation or quarantine of individuals suspected to be infected with COVID-19 [11, 13, 46].
Reliable metrics for the impact of social distancing measures on COVID-19 transmission
would be useful for informing which are most effective and when and how they should be deployed. Studies of COVID-19 spread in China [5, 17, 20], Italy [35], and globally [13] have relied
upon confirmed case statistics to evaluate the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions
in slowing the spread of the disease. Confirmed COVID-19 case counts are difficult to interpret, however, owing to uncertainties associated with what fraction of cases are captured in test
statistics [15, 43] and high false-negative rates associated with tests [52]. Furthermore, case

2

reports inevitably lag the onset of illness [48]. Other studies have used deaths from COVID-19,
which are more likely to be recorded than infections, but these represent a small portion of the
population and lag disease transmission by two or more weeks [53].
Numerous decentralized data sources informing the health and behavior of millions of individuals have become available over the last decade, motivating the development of new methodologies intended to track and ultimately limit the spread of diseases at the population level [37].
To estimate disease activity, these approaches have exploited near real-time data from internet search engines [12, 40, 51], clinicians search engines [39], news reports [1], crowd-sourced
participatory disease surveillance systems [33, 42], Twitter micro-blogs [34], electronic health
records [38, 47], Wikipedia traffic [10], wearable monitoring devices [36], satellite images [31],
and smartphone-based digital thermometers [27]. These new sources of data suggest the potential to achieve near real-time monitoring that is sufficiently complete to infer representative
population-wide characteristics and disease trends. In exchange, control over sampling protocols and participant behavior is typically lost, risking the introduction of systematic bias and
requiring care in interpretation.
In this study we use daily estimates of travel distances from cell-phone data and the incidences of fever from a network of smart thermometers across the U.S. to investigate whether
the adoption of social distancing practices has slowed the transmission of communicable fevercausing illnesses, including COVID-19. It should be emphasized that the use of novel data to
inquire into the dynamics of a novel disease in response to unprecedented changes in social
behavior is liable to lead to bias and misinterpretation. By way of example, attempts to predict seasonal influenza from Google search patterns appeared skillful over multiple seasons, but
failed to forecast the 2009 H1N1 (“Swine Flu”) pandemic and overestimated the spread of the
2013 seasonal influenza in the United States by a factor of nearly two [2, 6, 22, 40]. Our aim,
therefore, is not to establish the response of COVID-19 to doses of social distancing, but to
investigate whether two decentralized data sets may be leveraged to identify patterns consistent
with the dynamics of COVID-19.

Data and methods

Aggregated mobility data are provided by the location analytics company Cuebiq through its
Data for Good program. Cuebiq collects first-party location information from smartphone
users who opted in to anonymously provide their data through a GDPR-compliant framework.
Location data are aggregated into an index, M , defined as the base-10 logarithm of median
distance traveled per user on each day. For users traversing county borders, their movement is
recorded as belonging to the county in which they spend the most time on a given day. In order
to better focus our analysis on COVID-19, only counties having at least 100 confirmed cases of
COVID-19 as of April 10 are included, giving a total of 368 counties.
We quantify decreases in mobility between March 5 and April 15 using the range in mobility
divided by its maximum value, δM = 100 × (Mmax − Mmin )/Mmax , where the factor of 100
corresponds to reporting δM as a percentage. M is first smoothed with a 7-day moving average
to eliminate a weekly cycle associated with reduced commuting during weekends. Although, in
principle, δM could be ambiguous with respect to increasing or decreasing values of mobility,
in practice, all smoothed mobility data show a clear structure of nearly stable values followed
by a marked decline. If δM was computed between January 1 and March 4 it would average
only 10%, whereas in our selected March 5 to April 15 window δM averages 54%, with 95%
of counties having values between 21% and 96%. These major decreases in mobility coincide
with the voluntary and enforced restrictions on movement and business activity introduced in
mid-March in many U.S. states [11].
Fever incidence data comes from a network of smart-phone connected personal thermometers
managed by Kinsa, Inc. [4]. Kinsa began monitoring fevers in 2013, and the results of their
distributed thermometer network correlate closely with reported ILI cases from the U.S. Centers
for Disease Control (CDC) across regions and age groups in previous years [27]. Aggregated and
anonymized fever incidence is reported daily at the level of counties for the contiguous 48 states.
Daily fever rates in a given county are calculated as the number of fevers reported divided by the
number of unique users within the last year, where a fever is defined as a persistent temperature

4

above 37.7◦ C. Despite having more than a million users across the U.S., Kinsa finds it necessary
to drop estimates in certain counties whose user base is too small, based upon comparison
of their fever tracking against CDC ILI estimates [3], and instead reports values interpolated
from neighboring counties. At the time of writing, we do not know which county estimates are
from thermometer data versus being interpolated, and we instead attempt to control for this
effect through spatial averaging. Finally, a linear calibration is applied to the fraction of users
experiencing fevers that is determined at the national level in comparison to CDC ILI estimates
between August 2016 through August 2019.
For purposes of analysing whether reductions in mobility are associated with reductions
in fevers, we compute a percentage decrease in fevers from Kinsa data similar to that used for
mobility, δF = 100×(F1 −F2 )/F1 . In this case, F1 and F2 represent the average fever incidence,
respectively, over the ten days before a drop in mobility and from ten to twenty days afterwards.
The ten-day interval between the end of F1 and beginning of F2 is introduced to account for
the time required for a reduction in transmission to manifest as a change in fevers. The drop in
mobility is defined as occurring on the day at which the smoothed mobility signal decreases to
halfway between its maximum and minimum values.
Limitations. There are several sources of uncertainty in assessing the degree to which
changes in mobility are responsible for changes in fever incidence, foremost that mobility and
fever incidence are proxies for the actual variables of interest. The distance traveled by smartphone users does not, for example, account for the fact that walking on a crowded street involves
greater likelihood of close human contact than does driving on an open highway. Similarly, fever
data do not distinguish between cases arising from COVID-19, influenza, or any other illness
that causes fever. Furthermore, the contribution of COVID-19 is difficult to estimate using fever
statistics from previous years because mobility changes are expected to influence transmission
of most febrile respiratory infections. The signal of COVID-19 in fever data is also expected to
under-represent its actual spread in the population because only approximately 40% of COVID19 cases manifest with fevers [30]. An additional source of uncertainty arises from seasonality.

5

ILI is strongly seasonal, decreasing through March and April in most years regardless of changes
in mobility [28], and COVID-19 dynamics may also be found to be seasonal, albeit to an unknown extent [29]. These factors inform our decision to focus on county-level patterns in the
rates of fractional fever reduction as opposed to the absolute magnitude of fever declines.

Results

Our analysis is divided into three sections. We first examine the relative timing of reductions
in mobility and fevers (Figure 1), and next the magnitude of reductions in fevers relative to
changes in mobility (Figures 2 and 3). Whereas most counties apparently follow a relationship
whereby greater mobility reductions lead to greater reduction in fevers (Figure 3a), counties in
the vicinity of New York City follow a distinct pattern (Figure 3b) that we discuss in a final
section.

3.1

Timing of reductions in mobility and fevers

We first inquire as to the plausibility of a causal relationship between changes in fevers and
mobility. Specifically, a mobility-induced change in fever incidence should lag the change of
mobility by a time equal to or longer than the incubation period of COVID-19. We estimate
the lead or lag between reductions of mobility and reduction in fevers as the time shift that
minimizes their mean-squared difference. The lead-lag analysis is computed using time-series
of F and M as defined in the methods section, from March 5th, selected for being prior to
systematic changes in mobility, to April 15, representing the most current data at the time of
our analysis. On average, changes in fevers are found to lag changes in mobility by 6.5 days,
with 95% of the 368 counties included in the analysis having lags between 3 and 10 days (Figures
1 and S1). This lag agrees with independent estimates of the incubation period of COVID-19
as averaging 6 days and ranging between 2 and 14 days [19, 21, 23, 25]. Observed lags are
also consistent with estimates for negative growth rates of COVID-19 cases occurring 8 to 12
days after nation-wide restriction in travel in China [18], once accounting for the fact that an

6

additional lag averaging 4.8 days arises between the onset of symptoms, such as fever, and the
confirmation of a COVID-19 infection.
Despite consistency with COVID-19 epidemiology, a range of lagged responses to reductions
in mobility are expected to be present within our analysis of fevers. Incubation times for various
human-to-human communicable and fever-causing diseases range from as short as 1 to 2 days
for influenza to several weeks or longer for other diseases [41]. Although not undertaken herein,
more detailed analysis of the relative contributions of COVID-19, influenza, and other illnesses
to the fever signal might permit for distinguishing the degree to which close agreement of the
observed lag with the COVID-19 incubation period is indicative of COVID-19 prevalence or,
instead, arises from a combination of diseases.

3.2

Magnitudes of reductions in mobility and fevers

We next consider whether the magnitude of mobility reductions are predictive of the magnitude
of the subsequent fever reductions, examining the 368 counties that each have more than 100
confirmed COVID-19 cases. An overall decrease is anticipated solely on the basis of seasonal declines in ILI, but the average seasonally-attributable δF , as reported by Kinsa, is only expected
to average 28%. In contrast, the observed decline in fevers in 2020 is more than double the expected value with an average δF of 79%. The anomalously large reduction in fevers is consistent
with the twin effects of an excess of fevers increasing F1 to 31% above its seasonally-expected
value and social distancing subsequently reducing F2 to 63% below its expected value.
Ordinary least-squares regression of δF against δM indicates a 0.81 ± 0.28% decline in fever
incidence with each 10% reduction in mobility (p < 0.01, Figure 3a). Two potential concerns
with such a simple regression are that the p-value is estimated assuming that counties are
independent, and that noise in the predictor values causes regression dilution [9] that biases
results toward a shallower slope. A second regression is, therefore, performed after spatially
averaging mobility and fever reductions into 5◦ latitude by 5◦ longitude bins such that data from
368 counties are represented by 34 grid boxes that are expected to have greater independence

7

and less noise. Regression at this 5◦ by 5◦ scale gives a steeper slope indicating a 2.1 ± 0.6%
reduction in fever incidence per 10% reduction in mobility (p < 0.01) that we consider to be
more accurate (Figure S3).
It is useful to briefly review the patterns of mobility and fever reduction across the U.S.
that underlie our regression results (Figure 2). The 24 counties in Washington and California
with the largest decreases in mobility (δM > 90%) experienced an average reduction in fever
incidences of 90% (range of 85–93%). Estimated incidences in these counties all decreased to
less then 0.7% of the population after mobility reduction, whereas they averaged 4.8% prior to
the change in mobility. More moderate reductions in fever incidence are found in counties with
smaller mobility reductions. Counties having δM less than 25%, for example, are all located in
South Carolina, Florida, Tennessee, Alabama, Missouri, or Georgia, and are associated with an
average reduction in fevers of 80% (range of 67–89%).
The fact that the y-intercept of our regression of δF onto δM is 72 ± 4%, using the spatiallyaveraged data, indicates that there are factors acting to reduce fever incidence nationwide irrespective of changes in mobility. Such a relationship is expected, as noted, on the basis of the
seasonality associated with influenza [28], although seasonality is only expected to account for
approximately one-third of the intercept value. A greater-than-expected y-intercept may arise
if COVID-19 also responds to seasonal changes in environmental conditions, although whether
such a sensitivity exists is presently unclear [29]. Additional factors may include broad adoption
of behaviors that limit disease transmission but may not influence travel distances – such as
individuals remaining more dispersed in public, regularly disinfecting surfaces, and more frequently washing their hands – as well as an approximately 60% decline in U.S. air travel in
March and April relative to 2019 [32].
The other major feature associated with the regression is a cluster of outliers that share the
distinction of being near New York City (Figure 3a), and which are treated separately in the
following subsection. Omitting counties within 500 km of New York City gives a higher countylevel regression slope of a 1.6 ± 0.13% decrease in fevers for each 10% reduction in mobility

8

(p < 0.01, Figure 3a). At the 5◦ by 5◦ degree grid level, again omitting counties within New
York City’s sphere of influence, the slope is 2.0 ± 0.4% for each 10% reduction in mobility
(p < 0.01; Figure S3). Thus, we find a significant regression relationship between mobility and
fever reduction whose magnitude is consistent with the latter estimate of 2.0±0.4% for plausible
choices regarding averaging and omission of outliers.

3.3

New York City and neighboring counties

As of mid-April, New York City had the highest rate of confirmed COVID-19 infections of
any region, accounting for over 30% of the nation’s confirmed cases. Changes in fevers in
the five boroughs comprising New York City are, however, not explained by their changes in
mobility (Figure 3). Although New York City has achieved amongst the highest levels of mobility
reduction, with its five boroughs averaging a δM of 81% and Manhattan having a δM of 95%,
the city’s fever reductions are amongst the smallest in the country with a δF of only 53%.
Fever reductions have been more successful further from New York City. A regression of
δF against distance from Central Park in Manhattan for counties up to 500 km away indicates
that δF increases by 7% per additional 100 km distance from Manhattan (r = 0.87, p < 0.01).
Reductions in mobility, δM , are greatest in the immediate vicinity of New York City, resulting
in a weak regional anti-correlation with δF (r = −0.45). County-level population density also
weakly corresponds with δF such that higher population density is associated with less reduction
in fever (r = −0.38), as expected [7]. Multiple linear regression using δM , population density,
and distance from New York City to predict δF , however, indicates that only distance makes
a statistically significant contribution. These results may expose the limitations of our using a
single quantification of human mobility as a proxy for human-to-human contact in that it does
not capture, for example, if individuals move from more highly infected regions elsewhere.
As has been found to be generally possible in hierarchical metapopulation models [49], we
suggest that counties within 500 km of New York City continue to experience relatively high
rates of fevers – despite substantially reducing their local mobility – because no strict travel

9

restrictions were imposed to protect them from the city’s high infection rates. In contrast with
China’s restrictions on travel to and from Wuhan that appear to have dramatically reduced the
city’s ability to seed new outbreaks elsewhere [5, 18], New York City opted instead to focus on
local social-distancing efforts [11]. The outstanding question for this region then appears to be
why rates of fever have remained relatively high in New York City despite its massive reduction
in mobility, with possibilities including that the city is more densely populated than any other
in the U.S. [7, 45] and that it may have experienced substantial community spread of COVID-19
prior to the implementation of social-distancing rules [14].

4

Further discussion and conclusion

In agreement with foregoing studies [5, 13, 18, 20], our results indicate that social distancing
has limited the spread of COVID-19. Many U.S. counties with large reductions in mobility
achieve near-zero fever incidences by early April, indicating that severe curtailment of mobility
is effective in reducing disease transmission. Some counties in Midwestern states, however,
achieve similar outcomes with more moderate mobility reductions, and New York City has only
partially reduced fevers despite strong decreases in mobility. These counter-examples highlight
that regional disparities in demographics, climate, or the delay before implementing mobility
restrictions are also potentially of first-order importance for explaining and predicting the spread
of COVID-19.
The corollary to social distancing being effective is the question of the optimal degree of
mobility restriction for purposes of controlling the spread of COVID-19. Foregoing studies
have generally drawn inferences from confirmed case statistics [5, 13, 18, 20], but these lag
actual infections by up to several weeks and are subject to heterogeneous and potentially biased
reporting, making it challenging to infer causality in case growth rates and possibly allowing
outbreaks to spread through communities before a response can be mounted. Our combining cellphone mobility insights with smart-thermometer fever data permits for more rapidly assessing
the timing and rates of change in illness incidence. By leveraging existing data sources for

10

disease surveillance, approaches like the one we have employed may enable timely monitoring
of the effectiveness of mobility restrictions and, thereby, support efforts to contain emerging
outbreaks [8]. The importance of such capabilities is underscored by the possibility that COVID19 outbreaks will recur seasonally and require prolonged or intermittent social distancing [16].

Figure 1: Variations in mobility, fever incidence, and confirmed COVID-19 cases for an example county in each of 45 U.S. states. Each
panel shows a mobility index (green), the estimated percentage of individuals experiencing fevers (black), and new daily COVID-19 cases
(gray shading). The midpoint of mobility reductions (green dot) is used to define an early fever interval, corresponding to F1 , over the
preceding 10 days (red line), and a later fever interval, F2 , between 10 to 20 days afterwards (purple line). COVID-19 cases are normalized
such that their maximum value aligns with the upper limit of the y-axis, and the mobility index is centered such that its maximum value
equals the average fever incidence during F1 . Both COVID-19 cases and mobility are smoothed using a seven-day moving average. Panel
labels indicate two-letter state abbreviations and county FIPS code (see Table S1). Omitted states have no county with more than 100
confirmed COVID-19 cases as of April 10, 2020.

Figure 2: Average reductions in mobility and fevers for U.S. counties. (a) Fractional reductions
in mobility, δM , are computed as the range in mobility divided by maximum mobility between
March 5th and April 15th, δM = (Mmax − Mmin )/Mmax (b) Fractional reduction in fever, δF ,
computed as the change in fevers across the drop in mobility divided by fevers prior to the drop in
mobility, δF = (F1 − F2 )/F1 (see Figure 1). Counties having more than 100 confirmed COVID-19
cases as of April 10, 2020 (indicated by cross marks) are included in regression analyses shown in
Figure 3.

Figure 3: Relationship between reductions in mobility and fever across the 368 U.S. counties having more then 100 confirmed COVID-19
cases. (a) Regression of reductions in fevers, δF , against reductions in mobility, δM , gives a slope of 0.81 ± 0.28% reduction in fevers per
10% reduction in mobility (black line and shading). Excluding New York City and counties within 500 km leads to a steeper regression
relationship of 1.6 ± 0.13% reduction in fevers per 10% reduction in mobility (green line and shading). (b) Fractional reduction in fevers,
δF , in counties within 500 km of New York City. Numbering is provided for counties within 200 km of New York City and corresponds
to that in panel (a).

Figure S2: Reduction in fever incidences, δF , for 299 counties that are centered less than 500
km from Manhattan in New York City. Within this region, a county’s distance from New York
City is strongly correlated with the extent to which its fevers are reduced over a thirty day period
(r = 0.87, p < 0.01).

Figure S3: Relationship between reduction in fevers and reduction in mobility after spatially averaging counties having more than 100 confirmed COVID-19 cases into 5◦ latitude by 5◦ longitude
bins. The regression indicates a 2.1 ± 0.6% reduction in fevers for every 10% reduction in mobility
(black markers, line, and shading). If excluding counties within 500 km of New York City, the regression slope is 2.0 ± 0.4% reduction in fevers for every 10% reduction in mobility (green markers,
line, and shading) and the r2 increases from 0.27 to 0.42.
