Abstract
To reduce the impact of COVID-19 pandemic most countries have implemented several counter-measures to control the virus spread including school
and border closing, shutting down public transport and workplace and restrictions on gathering. In this research work, we propose a deep-learning
prediction model for evaluating and predicting the impact of various lockdown policies on daily COVID-19 cases. This is achieved by first clustering
countries having similar lockdown policies, then training a prediction model
based on the daily cases of the countries in each cluster along with the data
describing their lockdown policies. Once the model is trained, it can used
to evaluate several scenarios associated to lockdown policies and investigate
their impact on the predicted COVID cases. Our evaluation experiments,
conducted on Qatar as a use case, shows that the proposed approach achieved
competitive prediction accuracy. Additionally, our findings highlighted that
lifting restrictions particularly on schools and border opening would result
in significant increase in the number of cases during the study period.

1. Introduction
A new coronavirus (COVID-19) [1, 2]has emerged from Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province in central China in December 2019. The World Health
Organization has classified the virus as a global pandemic on March 11 2020
Preprint submitted to Journal Name

September 14, 2020

[3], with more than 280k cases and more than 4000 deaths worldwide. Several
research works and effort have been conducted in order to get better insights
about the virus and the factors affecting its fast spread while the world is
racing against the clock to develop an effective vaccine. Sun et al. [4] investigated the correlation between geographic information (latitude, longitude,
altitude) and the cumulative infected population under the lockdown policy
during the period from December 8, 2019 till April 8, 2020. The authors
discovered a negative correlation between the cumulative cases per province
and the latitude/longitude. The findings also showed population density is
not an important factor in the virus outbreak under strict lockdown measures. Sardar et al. [5] assessed the implication of lockdown in some indian
states and overall india. A new mathematical model is presented that incorporates lockdown measures and used to estimate new cases from May 17 to
31, 2020. In addition, authors conducted a sensitivity analysis by studying
the correlation analysis of two epidemological parameters with the lockdown
measures and the basic reproduction number R0 . The findings also showed
that lockdown is indeed effective in locations with high infection rate. A lift
of lockdown restriction after May 17 would result in high spike of number
of cases. In the study of Atalan [6], analysis of the effect of the number of
lockdown days on the spread of COVID-19 is presented. The study showed
evidence that the pandemic can be suppressed by effective lockdown measures. Thee author argue also that these measures are also effective from
psychological, environmental and economical perspectives. Vinceti et al. [7]
analyzed mobility restriction in the three most affected Italian regions, Lombardy, Veneto and Emilia-Romagna, from February 1 through April 6, 2020.
Results showed that the daily number of cases is inversely correlated to mobility restriction after the second lockdown policy. The peak is witnessed
14 to 18 days from imposing the lockdown. A study of the epidemiological
situation in the french region of Île de France is presented in [8]. The authors
a stochastic age-structured transmission model that includes age profiles and
social contacts in the area of study. This model is used to evaluate the lockdown policy. The simulated scenarios are integrated by introducing changes
to the contact matrices. The lockdown information is derived from mobility
data provided by mobile phone. Simulation scenarios are established includig
testing with different types and duration of social distancing. Results showed
that the prior to lockdown, the estimated reproduction number is 3.18. It
falls to 0.68 during lockdown thanks to 81% reduction in number of contacts.
Although great research efforts have been dedicated to investigate the im2

pact of restriction measures on the spread of the pandemic, to the best of
our knowledge, no reported work has investigate the impact of multiple restrictions measures e.g. school closing, restriction on gathering, workplace
closing, travel restriction, public transport shutdown, and how any change
in the restriction would affect the pandemic situation. In this work, we proposed a deep learning based approach that enables stakeholders and decision
makers to establish several scenarios related to restriction measures and investigate their impact. In addition, the proposed solution is versatile, in the
sense that it is applicable for any country. In addition, the proposed method
considers countries sharing similar restrictions and lockdown policies to analyze establish the simulated scenarios and assess their implications, rather
than analyzing each country separately
2. What If analysis
Our objective is to propose a solution to assist decision makers to establish multiple scenarios related to restrictions imposed to control the spread
of COVID-19. In the followings, we present an overview of the proposed
approach and its technical details.

Fig. 1 illustrates the proposed framework. First, we analyze the lockdown
strategy of each country in terms of:
• How fast the country reacted to the spread of the virus: this is assessed
in terms of difference in days between the first case is reported and the
day the following restrictions are imposed: school closing, restriction on
gatherings, border closing, public transport shutdown and workplace
closing.
• Efficiency of the lockdown policy: we propose to assess the efficiency
in terms of reproduction number. This specific number is the main
concern of all health authorities and decision makers. Indeed, a value
greater than 1 indicates that the virus is spreading while a value less
than 1 indicates that the virus spread is being controlled. We propose
to calculate this number for reach country and averaged every two
weeks.
This set of extracted features are intended to be clustered in order to determine countries sharing similar lockdown and restriction policies. For this, we
use the well-known K-Means algorithm which requires the number of clusters
as input paramter. Hence, we use Elbow method to determine the optimal
number of cluster. For a given country we intend to analyze, we use its daily
reported cases as well as to the daily reported cases of the countries belonging to the same cluster. These data combined with the lockdown measures
are used to train a deep learning model to predict the next day number of
COVID-19 cases. Once trained, this learning model is queried with data
reflecting a lockdown scneario. In other words, we are ”asking” the model to
predict the next day number of cases if, for example, schoolo are open and/or
restriction on gathering is restricted while other measures remain effective.
In the following, we present the technical details of the reproduction number
calculation, Elbow method, K-Means clustering and the deep learning-based
prediction model.
2.2. Reproduction number
Bettencourt et al. [9] proposed a Bayesian approach to estimate the
reproduction number in real time Rt . This value depends on the value of the
previous day Rt−1 and the all the previous m values Rt−m . Using Bayesian
modelling, the belief about the true value Rt is updated based on how many

4

reported cases each day:
P (Rt |k) =

P (kt |Rt )P (Rt )
P (kt )

(1)

where P (Rt ) is the prior belief about Rt without data, P (k|Rt ) is the conditional probability of having k cases given Rt and P (k) is the probability of
having k cases. By using the posterior of the previous day P (Rt−1 |kt−1 ) as
today prior P (Rt ), then we can write
P (Rt |kt ) ∝ P (kt |Rt )P (Rt−1 |kt−1 )

(2)

By iterating across all periods, we obtain:
P (Rt |kt ) ∝ P (R0 )

T
Y

P (kt |Rt )

(3)

t=0

Assuming a uniform prior P (R0 ), we have:
P (Rt |kt ) ∝

T
Y

P (kt |Rt )

(4)

t=0

However, as emphasized by [9], for Rt that remains greater than 1 for a long
period and then becomes less than 1, the posterior gets stuck. In other words,
the posterior cannot forget about long period of times for which Rt > 1. In
his study of reproduction number for United States, Kevin Systrom [10]
suggested including into the posterior only the previous m days. Hence, the
prior is derived using information from the recent past rather than the entire
history. Thus, we can write:
P (Rt |kt ) ∝

T
Y

P (kt |Rt )

(5)

t=T −m

2.3. Identifying countries with common lockdown policy
The objective to group and identify countries having similar lockdown
policy. The intuitive idea is that COVID-19 would impact these countries
the same way. To achieve this goal, we apply the Elbow method to determine
the optimal number of clusters. This optimal number is used as input parameter for the K-Means clustering algorithm. In the following, we present
the technical details of each step.
5

2.3.1. Elbow method
Let X = {x1 , x2 , ..., xn } be n of d-dimensional points to be clustered into
K clusters, i.e. assigning each xi , i = 1, ..., n to a cluster ck , k = 1, ..., K.
K-Means partitions the data by minimizing the squared error between the
mean of a cluster and the data points, members of the clusters. Let mk be
the mean of cluster ck . The squared error between a cluster center and its
members is defined as:
X
J(ck ) =
||xi − mk ||2
(6)
xi ∈ck

K-Means seeks to minimize the sum of the squared errors:
J(C) =

K X
X

||xi − mk ||2

(7)

k=1 xi ∈ck

Where C is the set of clusters. To minimize Eq. 7, the following steps are
applied:
1. Randomly assign K cluster centers and repeat step 2 and 3.
2. Assign each data point to the closest cluster center.
3. Calculate the new cluster centers.
The number of cluster K is an input parameter for K-Means. Hence, we use
the Elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters for which the
obtained partition is compact, i.e. low J(C). By adding more clusters would
result in even more compact partition which leads to over-fitting. Hence,
the variation of J(C) with respect to K would exhibit first a fast decrease
followed by a slow one. The Elbow method recommends to select the number
of cluster that corresponds to the elbow of the curve J(C) vs K.
2.4. Prediction model
To conduct the ’What if’ analysis for a specific country, the cluster to
which the contry belongs is idenfied. Then, the daily COVID-19 cases of these
countries are collected in addition to data related to lockdown measures. In
the followings, we detail characteristics of data and prediction model trained
on both daily COVID-19 and lockdown data.

6

2.4.1. Data description
The temporal characteristic is a critical component of the data as data
are collected on daily basis. Hence, it can be seen as multivariate time series
and consists of:
• Daily COVID-19 cases. These data are provided by government agencies It can be collected through several APIs for this information. We
collect data from February 15th to July 31st.
• School closing, where 0 indicates no measures are taken, 1- recommend
closing, 2- require closing (only some levels or categories, e.g. just high
school, or just public schools) and 3- require closing all levels.
• Workplace closing, where 0 indicates no measures are taken, 1- recommend closing (or recommend work from home), 2- require closing (or
work from home) for some sectors or categories of workers and 3- require closing (or work from home) for all-but-essential workplaces (e.g.
grocery stores, doctors).
• Restrictions on gatherings: where 0 indicates no restrictions are imposed, 1- restrictions on very large gatherings (the limit is above 1000
people), 2- restrictions on gatherings between 101-1000 people, 3- restrictions on gatherings between 11-100 people, 4- restrictions on gatherings of 10 people or less.
• Public transport shutdown where 0 indicates no measures are taken,
1- recommend closing (or significantly reduce volume/route/means of
transport available) and 2- require closing (or prohibit most citizens
from using it)
• International travel controls where 0 indicates no restrictions are taken,1screening arrivals, 2- quarantine arrivals from some or all regions, 3ban arrivals from some regions and 4- ban on all regions or total border
closure.
2.4.2. Two-pathway model
Fig. 2 depicts the general architecture of the proposed daily COVID-19
forecasting model. It is characterized by two pathways: one pathway dedicated to daily COVID-19 time series data while the other pathway is fed with
multivariate time series of lockdown measures. The first pathway is consists
7

of a stack of two Bidirectional LSTM layers followed by a dense layer. The
second pathway is a stack of two LSTM layers followed by a dense layer. On
top of these pathways, a merge layer is added where concatenation of the two
dense layers is performed. The merge layer is followed by two dense layers.
Th model outputs the prediction of the next day number of cases.

In the followings, we present the technical details of the LSTM and Bidirectional LSTM layers.
• LSTM layer: An LSTM layer consists of a sequence of LSTM cells and
the sequence data are fed in a forward way. The LSTM cell depicted
in Fig. 3. Given the current value xt , the previous hidden state ht−1
and the previous state Ct−1 , the following transformations are applied:

• Bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM): Bi-LSTM includes another LSTM
layer for which the data is fed in backward way as depicted in Fig. 4.
3. Experimental results
In this section, we focus on Qatar as a use-case. First, we assess the
proposed method by assessing the prediction accuracy, i.e. the error between
the actual and predicted daily COVID-19 cases in Qatar. We compare our
proposed solution with two other approaches: same model trained without
lockdown data and model trained on data of Qatar daily COVID-19 cases
only. Then, we investigate the model outcome while changing several input
parameters associated to the lockdown measures.

3.1. prediction of daily COVID-19 cases
Fig. 5 illustrated the Elbow method results. Results show that the optimal number of clusters correspond to K = 10 with a distortion score = 1324.
This number is used as input parameter to K-Means algorithm. Clustering
results shows that Qatar belongs to a cluster with other countries including Azerbaijan, Benin, Bahrain, Georgia, Croatia, Indonesia, Italy, Kuwait,
Lebanon, Mexico, Mozambique, Norway, Oman, Pakistan, Romania, Seychelles. These countries share similar characteristics in terms of how fast
they reacted to the first reported cases and the evolution of the reproduction
number Rt . They are characterized by an average Rt = 1.1 meaning that
the the virus spread is almost contained.
Fig. 6 shows Qatar daily cases during the month of August in addition to
three model predicted cases starting from August 15th. These findings prove
the improtance of including lockdown information to predict the daily cases.
Indeed, when trained without lockdown data, the model predict continuous
decrease of number of cases. When trained on Qatar data only, the model exhibits sharp fluctuation of number of cases. The proposed approach achieves
the best prediction performance and able to provide prediction which is close
to the actual daily cases. Table 3.1 details results of quantitative evaluation of the prediction accuracy by calculating the Root Mean Square Error
(RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE of the three models. Results confirm that the proposed approach achieves significant better performance with
the lowest RMSE and MAE.

3.2. Effect of lockdown policy changes on daily COVID-19 cases
In this section, we use the proposed model as a baseline to assess Qatar
lockdown policy during the first week of September. The proposed model
can be used to investigate the effect of changing the lockdown policy on the
evolution of COVID-19 cases. On September 1st, Qatar entered the 4th
phase of its lockdown policy which consists of: partially lifting restrictions
on gathering, partially opening public transport and educational institutions.
Workplace are opened with 80% capacity. Travelers entering Qatar from low
risk countries are still required to self-quarantine at home for one week. For

other countries, passengers must be quarantined at hotels for 15 days. In
this section, we analyze how lifting all restrictions on school, public transport and workplace and border opening would impact the number of cases
in Qatar during the first week of September 2020. We establish multiple
scenarios in which we hypothetically completely lift restriction on one sector
while keeping all other sectors under their actual policy and investigate the
model outcome.
Fig. 7 illustrates how lifting all restrictions on school and educational institutions would impact the daily cases in Qatar starting from 1st of September.
Results show that the proposed model predicts a fluctuating numbers till 3rd
of September then a continuous alarming increase is witness starting from
4th of September. The actual number of cases is almost stable. During
the period of this analysis, school and educational institution policy mandates a partial opening. Indeed, at Qatar University for example, most of
12

the lectures are conducted online for this period. Fig. 8 shows the evolu400

number of cases if restriction on workplace is completely lifted. We notice
fluctuating number of cases close to the actual numbers which suggest that
lifting restriction on workplace while keeping all other restrictions would not
affect COVID-19 cases. Effect of lifting all restrictions on borders is detailed
in Fig. 11. Results show dramatic implication of such decision. Indeed,
an exponential growth of number of cases would occur with more than 350
cases expected with difference of more than 100 cases compared to the actual
number. During the period of this analysis, passengers countries identified as
low risk are required to quarantine for one week while passengers from other
countries must quarantine at hotels for two weeks. Our analysis has identified
school, educational institution and border restrictions as key factors affecting
the daily COVID-19 cases. When restrictions are fully lifted, the proposed
model predicted a sudden increase in number of cases indicating that taking
such decisions would lead to dramatic consequences. The propose model did
not detect any significant changes in number of cases if restriction is fully
lifted on gathering, workplace and public transport.

4. Conclusion
We proposed a data driven approach aiming at predicting the daily COVID19 cases which allows also testing several scenarios related to lockdown policy.
The proposed model considered both lockdown information and daily cases
of countries having similar lockdown policy and showed same response to
the outbreak of the virus. We focused in our experiments on Qatar as a
use case and showed that the proposed model achieved better prediction by
including lockdown information and training model on data of countries with
similar policies. Our analysis also showed that completely lifting restrictions
on schools and borders would contribute to sudden increase of number of
cases in Qatar.
