Abstract
Physical distancing, as a measure to contain the spreading of Covid-19, is defining a “new normal”. Unless belonging to a family,
pedestrians in shared spaces are asked to observe a minimal (country-dependent) pairwise distance. Coherently, managers of
public spaces may be tasked with the enforcement or monitoring of this constraint. As privacy-respectful real-time tracking of
pedestrian dynamics in public spaces is a growing reality, it is natural to leverage on these tools to analyze the adherence to physical
distancing and compare the effectiveness of crowd management measurements. Typical questions are: “in which conditions nonfamily members infringed social distancing?”, “Are there repeated offenders?”, and “How are new crowd management measures
performing?”. Notably, dealing with large crowds, e.g. in train stations, gets rapidly computationally challenging.
In this work we have a two-fold aim: first, we propose an efficient and scalable analysis framework to process, offline or in realtime, pedestrian tracking data via a sparse graph. The framework tackles efficiently all the questions mentioned above, representing
pedestrian-pedestrian interactions via vector-weighted graph connections. On this basis, we can disentangle distance offenders
and family members in a privacy-compliant way. Second, we present a thorough analysis of mutual distances and exposure-times
in a Dutch train platform, comparing pre-Covid and current data via physics observables as Radial Distribution Functions. The
versatility and simplicity of this approach, developed to analyze crowd management measures in public transport facilities, enable
to tackle issues beyond physical distancing, for instance the privacy-respectful detection of groups and the analysis of their motion
patterns.

1. Introduction
Crowd management is a challenging scientific topic directly impacting on the functioning of trafficked urban infrastructures such as, e.g., train or metro stations. Even more so, in
time of Covid-19 pandemic, after an initial lock-down period,
communities are still wondering how to resume a “new normal” life, while the virus is still circulating among the population. One of the key control measures has been to maintain a
minimal physical distance (often also called “social distance”)
between any two individuals not belonging to the same family [1]. This distance is country-specific and it ranges from
1 m (e.g. China and France), as recommended by WHO, up to
2 m (e.g. UK and Canada), being 1.5 m in the Netherlands and
in some countries it is even adjusted over time. As there is a
rather widespread suspicion that we may have to live with such
requirements of physical distancing for months to come, it is
therefore natural that this is becoming a design requirement for
public infrastructures (e.g. [2, 3, 4, 5]).
There are however several challenges associated to the automated monitoring of physical distancing in crowds. First, in

order to respect individual privacy one needs to employ sensors and techniques that ensure privacy by design while, at the
same time, providing accurate space-time information on individual positions with sub-meter accuracy.
Secondarily, one needs to develop algorithms that, while
preserving privacy, are capable to autonomously discern, with
a good degree of accuracy, families and family members from
strangers. This identification should be performed in real-time,
raising a number of non-trivial technical challenges.
Additionally, in recent months a number of countries have
developed contact tracing apps that allow to receive an alert
when somebody has been in “close” contact with somebody
that, later on, will turn out to be positive to the Covid-19 [6].
Countries are developing apps based on different alert thresholds, typically a combination of having been closer than a given
distance, for a time longer than an established reference. These
thresholds, again, are country specific. In Italy and Germany
the national apps alert for contacts longer than 15 minutes at
a distance below 2 meters. The proper balance of these two
aspects, distance and time, is key to avoid too many false positives or false negatives due to e.g. to low or high risk exposures
as well as to the inaccuracy of distance estimation via the intensity of Bluetooth signals. It is therefore extremely interestJuly 15, 2020

ing to be able to analyze, in a number of key urban settings,
the combination of contact times for given distances between
two persons. This knowledge may provide key information for
the calibration of contact tracing apps in different context.
In this paper we employ data from commercial pedestrian
tracking sensors placed overhead at Platform 3 in Utrecht central train station (The Netherlands), in order to develop an efficient algorithm, capable of running in real-time, and able to
distinguish infringements of the physical distancing rule from
the behaviour of family members, that are allowed not to respect such a rule. We introduce the concept of “Corona event”,
to indicate events when two people, not belonging to the same
family, get closer than a threshold distance D.
We focus on contact times and mutual distances considering statistical observables as the radial distribution functions
(RDFs), which can conveniently be employed to quantify average exposure times. This enables a two-fold task: automatizing the definition of families and groups (from now on named
family-groups) and characterizing the statistical distribution of
violations, which we compare with analogous pre-Covid measurements. Based on the space-time dynamics of groups, we
try to identify family members as those individuals that consistently stay closer than a given threshold distance for sufficiently long time. This, in turn, allows us to define physical
distance violators as those individuals that only occasionally
(i.e. inconsistently) yield Corona events infringing the minimal distance rule.
This paper is structured as follows: in Section 2, we survey
the pedestrian dynamics literature and computer science methods in connection with group-dynamics and mutual distances.
We outline both fundamental outstanding questions and existent analysis methods. In Section 3, we describe the location
and measurement setup at Utrecht Central train station used to
acquire the analyzed pedestrian data. In Section 4 we review
the concept and basic properties of Radial Distribution Functions, extensively leveraged on by our method. In Section 5 we
present our method and possible variations, that we employ to
analyze mutual distancing data in Section 6. A final discussion
in Section 7 closes the paper.

via models or in laboratory settings extensively, first quantitative studies in pedestrian dynamics driven by real-life big
experimental datasets are relatively recent (see, e.g., [16, 17,
18, 19]). Large-volumes of experimental data, in the order of
hundred of thousands real-life trajectories, are indeed essential in order to analyze quantitatively and systematically the
physics of pedestrian motion, disentangling the high variations
in individual behaviors from average patterns, and characterizing typical fluctuations and universal features [19, 20]. This
relative delay in performing high-statistics based analyses of
pedestrian motion (especially in comparison with other “active matter” physical systems [21]), is most likely due to the
complex technical challenge of achieving accurate, privacypreserving, individual tracking in real-life conditions (see, e.g.,
[20, 22, 23], or [24] for approaches targeting even higher resolution). Market solutions, as the one considered in this paper,
are also becoming accessible, offering various trade-offs between accuracy and costs (see, e.g., [25]).
On top of automated tracking, higher-level automated understanding of individual behaviors – a concept also known in
computer science as trajectory pattern mining [26, 27] – remains also outstanding in many aspects. The automated identification of pedestrian groups, or pedestrian “group mining”,
is a notable example in this context. On one side, in current pedestrian dynamics research, the definition and classification of groups and social structures in experimental data
has been manual, i.e. based on labor-intensive visual inspection (e.g. [28]). While this ensures high-quality validated measurements, it limits the possibility to establish vast statistical datasets towards data-driven characterizations of averages
and fluctuations in the dynamics. On the other side, automatic strategies to identify groups have been proposed by the
data mining community. These approaches primarily hinge on
analyzing (instantaneous) spatial clusters of pedestrians and
the consistency with which these adhere over time to some
group semantics (flocking, convoying, aggregation/ desegregation, see [27, 29, 30, 31] and references within).
Here we pursue distance analyses and family-group identification via discretized mutual pairwise distance distributions
– represented in physics terms via Radial Distribution Functions among relevant pedestrian pairs (the concept of RDF is
further reviewed in Section 4). We accumulate information on
a “social” interaction graph with vector edge weights. This
data structure holds all the relevant contact times and distance
statistics; besides, family-groups emerge as incremental features queryable by a space-time distance semantics. Graphs
are classic tools in discrete mathematics to represent networks
of interactions, or connections between entities (e.g. [32]). Formally speaking, a graph H is a set of nodes, H = {pi }, endowed
with edges, say e = (pi , p j ), connecting node pairs. Providing
a weight function, w(e), defined on the edges, makes the graph
“weighted”. In our case, nodes are in 1:1 correspondence with
observed pedestrians, whereas edges underlie distance-based
interactions, that are characterized by a weight function with
values in a real vector space of pre-fixed dimension. Graphs
have been often used for data-driven studies on social behavior both of humans, e.g. to analyze social networks [33], GPS-

2. Related works: (social) distance in pedestrian dynamics
The analysis of pairwise distances and the automated identification of family-groups triggered by the Covid-19 pandemics
connect with outstanding technological and fundamental issues in the broader field of crowd dynamics. Crowd dynamics is a multidisciplinary research area aiming at understanding and modeling the motion of pedestrians in crowds (see,
e.g., [7, 8, 9], for introductory references). Outstanding questions specifically connected to mutual distances and groups
are, e.g.: “what is the impact of the group on the individual
dynamics observables such as position and velocity?” “How
do people in social groups interact?”, “How does information propagates throughout groups?” (see e.g. [10, 11, 12, 13,
14] and e.g. [15] for a group-psychology review). Although
these questions are longstanding, and have been investigated

3. Pedestrian tracking setup at Utrecht Central Station

In theoretical physics and molecular dynamics, the radial
distribution function, g(r) (RDF), and the radial cumulative
distribution function (RCDF), G(r), are established tools to
characterize the distribution of pairwise distances between particles (see e.g. [38]), i.e., in our case, pedestrians.
By definition of RCDF, for a crowd with uniform spatial
density ρ, on average, i.e. in the mean-field of many realizations, the number of people, Nρ (r), at a distance up to r from a
generic individual satisfies

4. Pedestrian radial distribution functions

We benchmark our approach considering pedestrian tracking data acquired on platform 3 at Utrecht Central station, The
Netherlands (cf. Figure 1). Utrecht Central, with roughly 57
million annual users, is the nation-wide busiest railway station.
Since 2017, platform 3 has been equipped with 19 commercial
pedestrian tracking sensors, each of which captures 3D stereo
images at f = 10 frames per second and processes them to
deliver individual tracking data in a privacy-friendly manner
(cf. sketch in Figure 1). The sensor view-cones are in partial
overlap, which enables the sensor network to stitch together
trajectory pieces acquired by the single devices. The total area
covered by the set of sensors consist of the full platform width
(about 3 m) for 120 linear meters next to track 5, plus the area
underneath escalators and staircases connecting the platform
to the central hall. This yields a covered area of approximately
450 m2 . Track 5 is among Utrecht’s busiest tracks and is primarily utilized by trains heading to Amsterdam Central Station and Schiphol Airport. The complex and multi-directional
crowd flows on the platform are recorded with high space- and
time-resolution 24/7 since March 2017 (localization precision:
O(5−10) cm, similar technology to what employed in [25]). In
normal operation conditions, the system would capture about
100.000 trajectories per day while, on average, only 16.000
trajectories per day were observed in the two months after the
Covid-19 outbreak (see pre- and during- Covid-19 crowd distribution example in Figure 1 and crowd density histograms
in Figure 2). This unique measurement setup gives us not only
the possibility of developing and testing our approach in meaningful real-life conditions, but also to compare relevant statis-

therefore, g(r) = ∂r G(r) holds. Thus, the functions g(r), G(r)
(and derived quantities) do not carry any space/time specific
information, rather they relate to average properties, depending only on mutual distances.
For instance, in unconfined space, G(r) grows as the circle
area, i.e.
Nρuncon f (r) = πr2 ρ.
(2)
In our train platform, such a ∼r2 growth ratio is possible only
when r is sufficiently smaller than the platform width. Else,
we expect a ∼r1 (linear) trend, as the area growth is bound to
the platform length only. This holds until platform finite size
effects come into play. In Figure 3 we compare the RDF and
RCDF for the two density levels highlighted in Figure 2. We
notice a depletion in the radial distribution functions at short
distances when comparing with the situation pre-outbreak. As
a partial anticipation of the results of this paper, in the figure
we report also the RDF discounted of short-distance familygroup interactions (such interactions are allowed by present

Covid-19 pandemic (27th of May 2020, red triangles). Prior to the Covid-19 outbreak, densities in excess of 1 ped/m2 occurred daily. One year later, during the
Covid-19 pandemic, the maximum crowd density recorded is only about 0.3 ped/m2 . We compare measurements acquired at similar density levels, i.e. where the
average available space per person is comparable. We focus on two density levels: 40-50 passengers (purple band, cf. Figures 3(a,c) and 6(a)) and 70-80 passengers
(green band, cf. Figures 1, 3(b,d) and 6(b)).

age, our identification of family-groups relies only on mutual
proximity and its time-consistency. Whenever two or more
pedestrians maintain a mutual short distance consistently throughout a sufficient fraction of their trajectory, they should automatically emerge as belonging to the same family-group. Additionally, we deem implementation simplicity, while maintaining efficiency and sufficient accuracy in identifying familygroups relations, possibly in real-time, and without complex/costly
data-searches. Hence, our approach is “additive” (or “incremental”) and RDF-like information is increased, on the go, in
a graph data structure (at minimal memory costs), and, without computationally-costly searches in stored records, familygroups and offenders remain identified immediately. In other
words, by additivity, we stress that our data structure is built
online and usable after only one time-forward pass of the trajectory data.

regulations). As expected, this yields a further depletion of the
RDF in the region r / 1.5 m. In the figure, we additionally report the aforementioned analytic trends and the R(C)DF functions obtained through Monte Carlo numerical simulations in
a rectangular domain with the same size as the platform. We
specifically consider an ensemble of simulated crowds of N
pedestrians; individuals have a random spatial distribution satisfying a minimal mutual distance of 0.2 m. The figure reports
ensemble-averaged RDFs and RCDFs which thus include smallrange quadratic growth, platform-width-bound linear growth
and finite size effect. Measurements well-conform with simulations.
Short mutual distances over extended time duration are
known to increase the contagion probability: RDF and RCDF
can be used to evaluate the average exposure time. A pedestrian that was on the platform for a time interval ∆T , was exposed, on average, for a time
T rc = ∆T ρG(rc ),

In conceptual terms, we represent the pedestrian trajectories as individual nodes of a graph H. Each node includes
information specific to the trajectories, such as overall observation time, τ, source and destination. These three quantities
are incremental as, respectively, τ scales with the number of
frames a pedestrian is observed, the source point is the initial point of a trajectory while the destination gets constantly
updated with the current position until a pedestrian leaves the
measurement area. Whenever two pedestrians, say p1 and p2 ,
are observed simultaneously (i.e. in the same frame) and their

5.2. Approximation of the short-range RDF as edge average
The graph is a collection of RDFs functions restricted to
pairs of pedestrians. As such, within the limits of the quantization, it is richer in information than the “global” RDF (Eq. (1)).
The latter, in fact, can be recovered by averaging the edge
weights over the entire graph, i.e. by combining each pairwise
contribution. Restricting to a graph describing conditions with
equal density, the global RDF can be approximated as

distance offenders.

we consider p1 and p2 as belonging to the same family-group.
We set λ(1) = 40%, λ(2) = 90% which, in words, translates
to people who have a pairwise distance of less than 1.5 m for
90% percent of the time and are within 1 m for 40% percent
of the time. The rationale being that pedestrians who followed the same trajectory, thereby being in mutual close proximity for the major part of their persistence time, and who
are comfortable for extended periods in each other’s private
space (r ≤ 1 m) most likely belong to the same family-group.

6. Physical distancing at Utrecht Central Station,

In this section we employ the graph H to analyze trajectory
data collected in Utrecht station (see Section 3) and we compare statistics from before and during the Covid-19 pandemic.

Analogously, we can consider a RCDF discounted of familygroup contributions, say G f (r) (cf. Eqs. (1), (3)), such that
T rf c = ∆T ρG f (rc )

Typical graphs and qualitative aspects. In Figure 4b, we report examples of the graphs acquired during a typical morning
(time interval 4AM - 8.30AM). Train arrivals are the most critical conditions when it comes to respecting physical distancing, thus we create a new graph two minutes after each train
departure, when the platform is almost empty (this step is not
strictly necessary, but increases computational efficiency). In
the figure, nodes size and color follows the node degree, i.e.
the number of first neighbors and, thus, the distance offenses
committed by that node.
As a qualitative example of the capability of the method to
extract relevant data, we showcase two antipodal conditions in
Figure 5. In the first case (left panel), we report two pedestrians in a family-group relation that remain together throughout
their entire trajectories: from the escalators to the boarding. In
the second case, we have a repeated offender: the associated
node exhibits 28 first-neighbor connections. Interestingly, a
significant part of the offenses happens while the pedestrian
waits in proximity of the escalator. This, therefore, rather
marks a waiting area to be disallowed, than a willing offender.

(12)

is the total exposure time with non-family individuals and up to
a spatial threshold rc . By differentiation (as in Eq. (1)), we can
similarly define the RDF g f (r) discounted by family-groups.
Family sub-graph transitive closure. The relation “∼” can be
non-transitive, i.e. p1 ∼p2 , p2 ∼p3 do not imply p1 ∼p3 . One
may thus consider the transitive closure of “∼”, say “∼¯ 00 which
is defined as p1 and p3 belong to the same family-group (p1 ∼p
¯ 3)
either if p1 ∼ p3 or if they have common family-group members.
In the data we analyze in Section 6, we do not consider
such transitive closure. In other words, family-group relations
are exclusively defined by Relation (10). On one hand, we
deem rare the event that a family remains not represented by a
clique. Even in this case, we expect contributions to the overall
RDF statistics be minimal. On the other hand, in real-life data
collected with sensors similar to ours, short/broken trajectories may appear. We observed that these, in combination with
Relation (10) would unrealistically increase the probability of
observing large family-groups. Hence, to avoid excessive and
unjustified complications in the heuristics we restrict to Relation (10).

Family-group discounted RDFs. In Figures 3 and 6 we report
RDFs prior and after excluding family-group interactions. The
RDFs for r < D are non-vanishing, even after discounting the
contributions of family-groups, most significant in the weekends (when the presence of workers and commuters is lower;
cf. short-distance “bump” in Figure 6). We expect these remaining contributions at r < D to be to Corona events by distance offenders. Notably, once removed of family-groups contributions, the RDFs at small r values recover a linear growth
rate, as expected by a random spatial distribution of passengers
(scaling as the derivative of Eq. (2)).

Relevant interactions, family-discounted graph and offenders.
Combining the previous elements we can now identify distance offenders as those pedestrians that violate physical distancing while not being part of a family. We consider the
sub-graph H 0 ⊂ H obtained after pruning H of family-group
edges. The connections left in H 0 must indicate sporadic (i.e.
not time-consistent) distance infringements.
As exposure time is deemed a critical parameter for contagion [41], we apply a further time requirement to discriminate
actual offenders. Specifically, we introduce the set P0α defined
as
d
P0α = {p ∈ H 0 : T p,
(13)
f > α};

Exposure time, node degree and evolution through the pandemics. In Figure 7a we report, week-by-week, the average
edge weight as introduced in Eq. (6), pruned of family-group
contributions and scaled by the sampling frequency. This provides an approximation of how the (family-discounted) average individual exposure time has been changing over time
(weeks 17 to 26 in 2020). As the usage of the platform grew
after a drop at the beginning of the outbreak, so did the exposure time for distances between 0.5 m and 2.5 m, especially
until week 22. On the opposite, the amount of time, per person, spent with a peer within 0.5 m has remained constant and
within fractions of a second. A new operation schedule at week
23, with increased train frequency throughout the day, allowed

in words, elements of P0α are pedestrians who violated physical distancing with non-family members for an overall time
longer than α. The number of first neighbors of a node in P0α
identifies how many contacts such pedestrian had: we label as
repeated offenders those with more than 10 first neighbors (i.e.
pedestrians that violated physical distancing with more than
10 different people and for an overall time larger than α). We
remark that this classification can be run in real-time as all

Figure 8: (a) Distribution of node-pedestrian degree per day as a percentage of the total number of passengers. The degree of a node counts the number of people
encountered with a mutual distance smaller than 1.5 m (hence, degree 0 means that a person did not have any Corona event). We observe that high-degree nodes,
i.e. repeated distance offenders, increased steadily until the train schedule change (e.g. nodes with 10+ contacts grew from ≈1% to ≈10%). The schedule change
yielded a temporary drop in the offender percentage after which it started increasing again. This can be a sign of warning towards the relaxation in the compliance

of physical distancing rules. (b) Probability density function of the individual exposure time discounted of families, T p,

(Eq. (9)). Exposure times show a power-law behavior. The PDF depletion after T = 5 minutes is most likely due to the time windowing that we operate around each
train arrival (cf. Figure 4b). This yields a data cut-off for large times.

by the fact that we limit our graphs to time intervals of about
10-15 minutes around each train arrival. This reduces our resolution at large time scales and thus yields the exponential-like
drop in the distribution tails.

a temporary reduction of the load on the platform, making easier to respect physical distancing. From week 24 onward, individual exposure times showed again a growing trend. To
render the data comparable, we consider also exposure times
compensated for the new train schedule (Figure 7a, only for
the case r ≈ D) , i.e. corrected by a factor
γ=

# daily trains with new schedule
≈ 1.7.
# daily trains with old schedule

Crowd density: incidence of family-groups and effective offenders. The passenger density on the platform has an influence on the offenses: the higher the density the easier it gets to
violate physical distancing. In Figure 9a we report for a sample
day (12th of June 2020), how the percentage of “family” nodes
and offenders scales with the density within the global density
interval [0, 0.5] ped/m2 . As in Eq. (13), we also include minimum contact time thresholds, α, for tagging offenders. We observe that the percentage of nodes belonging to family-groups
remains stationary (value ≈11%, a detailed breakdown of the
clique size is in Figure 9b). Up to 80% of the pedestrians at the
maximum density level committed offenses assuming no minimum time threshold (α = 0). This percentage slightly diminishes to 60% restricting to a minimum contact time α = 5 s.
Interestingly, the percentage shows a non-linear dependency
on the density when α = 30 s. In particular, such percentage
remains stationary (value ≈ 11%) until 0.2 ped/m2 and then
suddenly increases. This can suggest an increase in difficulty
in following distancing rules around this density level. We report the coefficients of the linear fitting of such data in Table 1.

(14)

This shows a more stable growth pattern and an increase of
factor 3.5 between weeks 17 and 26 (the factor γ is an estimate, considering the presence of trains of different kind and
lengths). Scaling the corrected exposure times with the number of passengers, which is itself growing, we additionally notice, that the former is growing faster (i.e. exposure time grow
super-linearly with respect to the passengers). This suggests a
possible relaxation or an increased difficulty in following physical distancing regulations.
We report in Figure 8a an in-depth breakdown of the distribution of node degrees, i.e. the number of first neighbors of
each node and thus the number of contacts with different individuals the node had (including both offenses and families).
Consistently with our previous observations, the fraction of
high degree nodes (5+ or 10+), i.e. repeated offenders, has also
been growing steadily, but a temporary drop following the train
schedule change. In Figure 8b we display the distribution of individual exposure times pruned of family contributions, and up
d
to the distance thresholds rd (Eq. (5)), i.e. the pdfs of T p,
f (cf.
Eq. (11)). Similarly to what discussed in [42], and consistently
with the model in [43], we observe a power-law distribution in
the exposure times (exponent p < −2), which emerges as a robust feature of random encounter dynamics. Additionally, we
notice that the distance threshold plays a strong multiplicative
effect and, possibly, it also weakly influences the exponent. It
is worth remarking that our largest observation times are bound

7. Discussion
We have presented an highly efficient and accurate approach
to the problem of studying, in real-time, the distance-time encounter patterns in a crowd of individuals. Our approach allows us to identify social groups, such as families, by imposing
thresholds on the distance-time contact patterns. In the context
of the currently ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, we demonstrate
this as an effective and promising tool to monitor, in a full

Figure 9: (a) Percentage of pedestrian nodes exposed to contacts as a function of the global density on the platform (density calculated as number of people in a
frame divided by the total sensor area, 450 m2 , discounted of the danger zone, 96 m2 ). Exposed nodes that have at least one contact, of any duration, with another
pedestrian (within or outside their family-group or not) are in blue. This percentage if further broken down into nodes part of a family group (red) and actual distance
offenders (green). The purple and orange lines restrict, respectively, to nodes with a minimum exposure time of 10 s and 30 s. Linear fitting parameters are reported
in Table 1. (b) Distribution of individuals and cliques day-by-day as a percentage of the total number of nodes. Between 80% and 85% of the nodes do not belong
to cliques, i.e. they travel alone and their contacts are all distance infringements. Family-groups of two people cover about 12% − 15% of the remaining nodes;
family-groups of three and more provide a minimal ≈3% contribution.

Table 1: Linear fit parameters for the node classification (percentage data) in
Figure 9a. As a measurement unit for the pedestrian density we employ tenths
of pedestrians per square meter: δ = 10−1 ped/m2 . Thus the fitting intercept
is at δ = 0 while the increments (slopes) are reported as percent variations per
δ unit. As an example, pedestrians that do not belong to a family-group and
are in contact with someone else grow about 13% when the density increases
between 0.2 and 0.3 ped/m2 and similarly between 0.3 and 0.4 and so on. We
do not report linear fitting parameters for the case α = 30 s as the growth is
non-linear.

privacy respectful way, the observation of physical distancing.
The outcome of the analysis can provide early warnings in respect to an average relaxation towards the compliance of physical distance rules, can allow to identify spots where physical
distancing most frequently is violated and it may, as well, allow to identify in real-time the presence of distance offenders.
We observed, besides, a super-linear dependence between contact times and passenger number. This can be caused both by a
reduction of attention towards social distancing rules but also
to an intrinsic increase in difficulty in complying to regulations. The investigation of this aspect is left to future research.
The proposed algorithm is simple and can be easily implemented using existent graph code libraries. In our case, we
could process a day of data in few minutes using the python
NetworkX library [44]. Libraries sporting higher performance
and/or scalability exist in case of even more demanding situations.
It is worth mentioning that the approach here proposed can
be applied to any type of tracing trajectories and possibly to
