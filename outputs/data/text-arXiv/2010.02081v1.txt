Abstract:
While the pathophysiology underlying the COVID-19 infection remains incompletely understood, there is growing
evidence to indicate that it is closely correlated to hypercoagulation among severely ill patients. Doctors may choose
for use anti-coagulation doses to treat the patients at intensive care units. A rapid, easy, and low-cost solution to
monitor the coagulation status at the point-of-care may help with treatment by enabling the administration of
controlled doses of medication to patients and to understand the disease’s underlying pathophysiology.
Thromboelastography, the clinical standard is accurate; it suffers from limited portability and low sensitivity when
miniaturized to handheld form factor. In the article, we summarize research helping to advance towards an
integrated optofluidic device combining microfluidics and photonic sensor technology. Microfluidics are used to
perform blood pre-processing, and a photonic sensor measures blood coagulation status in real time readout on the
device itself. These techniques make it portable and scalable, potentially serving as technology foundation for the
development of a disposable sensor for point-of-care diagnostics in COVID-19 patients and coagulopathy in general.

1. Introduction
The rapid spread of COVID-19 has resulted in a global pandemic with very high rates of morbidity and
mortality. As of May 22, 2020, it has infected more than 5 million people in different parts of the world.
Various disease models have estimated the overall mortality rate to be between 4.3% to 14.6 %. A leading
contributor to this mortality rate is the development of progressive bilateral pneumonia which leads to acute
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and eventual death. It is believed that the surface proteins of the
COVID-19 virus bind to ACE2 receptors on the host cell and subsequently invade it via clathrin-mediated
endocytosis [1,2]. ACE2 receptors are broadly expressed in the vascular endothelium, respiratory
endothelium, alveolar monocytes, and macrophages. As a result, the virus is able to effectively replicate in
the upper and lower respiratory tracts, eventually attacking target organs that express ACE2 (heart, kidney,
gastrointestinal tract). During disease progression, the exaggeration results not only from the direct viral
infection but also from the immune-mediated injury caused by COVID-19. Multiple studies have reported
two distinctive features among patients: progressive inflammation and hypercoagulation [3-8].
In a recent study, clinical researchers reported that elevated levels of fibrin degradation D-dimers were
indicative of poor prognosis of the disease [9]. Working under the hypothesis that coagulopathy is closely
correlated to the pathogenesis of COVID-19, multiple post-mortem studies have reported the presence of
drastic microvascular changes in the lungs, including disseminated micro-thrombi and hemorrhagic necrosis
[10]. Other studies suggest that COVID-19 increases the risk of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary
embolisms. Recently, Maxime et al. reported the occurrence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) among
admitted COVID-19 patients [11].
The coagulation response of the human vasculature system against external stimulus or injury is well known;
it is unclear how COVID-19 triggers this process [3]. One hypothesis is that COVID-19 prompts the release of
chemical signals from the immune cells that ramp up inflammation and blood coagulation [3,6,7].
Consequently, doctors are relying on anti-coagulative medication to increase the survival rates in admitted
cases. Paranjpe et al. published their findings on the association of treatment with anti-coagulation dose with
in-hospital survival of the patients [8]. The effect of anticoagulation treatment is more pronounced among
ventilated patients: 62.7 percent of intubated patients who were not treated with anticoagulants died as
compared to 29.1 percent for intubated patients who were treated with anticoagulants [7].
Given the critical abnormality of coagulopathy among COVID-19 patients, we believe a rapid, quantitative,
portable and low-cost device for hemostasis monitoring at the point-of-care is needed. This would enable
precise and personalized anticoagulation response monitoring among critically ill patients [12]. A bed-side
test should be minimally invasive, and require a low blood volume per test. This is especially true for patients
who are assisted by extracorporeal devices such as hemodialysis machines, membrane oxygenation systems,
and mechanical circulatory system support systems [12,14]. Those patients require monitored
anticoagulation to prevent blood clotting in the transport lines and pumps of these devices, ex vivo [14-16].
Many tests and devices have been developed to assess and monitor blood coagulation and platelet functions
[15-25]. The current standard is based on thromboelastography (TEG); TEG provides a rapid assessment of
hemostasis in the blood by measuring shear elasticity and the dynamics of clot formation [25-29]. While it
provides information on platelet function, coagulation formation, and fibrinolysis, it generally requires
expensive and large equipment to perform the tests. The method is not currently portable and cannot be
used in most point-of-care settings; this is uniquely true in resource constrained or high throughput settings
(e.g. urgent care clinics) [28,30]. Other tests and devices have also been developed to assess blood clotting

PREPRINT

in vitro, for instance, assays for bleeding time, activated clotting time, and platelet aggregometry [19-21].
But, they are unable to provide accurate predictions of thrombotic and bleeding risks. Often, they are
inaccurate and have poor sensitivity in detecting the different stages of blood coagulation cascade [ 23-25].
In this manuscript, we describe a simple optofluidic approach for real-time monitoring of coagulation status
among severely-ill COVID patients. A device based on this approach would permit rapid determination of the
effectiveness of anti-coagulant treatment and allow medical professionals to tailor dosage to meet patientspecific response. The proposed approach is minimally invasive and allows for the development of scalable
diagnostic and treatment solutions in the current pandemic. The presented optofluidic sensor module
system includes a microfluidic device that is integrated into a photonic sensor [31-33]. The microfluidic chip
performs passive separation of blood plasma, which then interacts with the sensor module in the presence
of the coagulation/anti-coagulation dose to monitor the clotting of blood. The sensor module is composed of
SiN based photonic micro-ring resonators to detect [34] and quantify the different stages of the blood
coagulation cascade. The proposed approach could be made into a low cost, rapid, and accurate device
solution.

2. Results
In general, blood is a multiphase fluid made up of different cells in plasma [35,36]. It consists of erythrocytes
(red blood cells, RBCs), leukocytes (white blood cells, WBCs), and thrombocytes. By volume (v/v %), the
composition is about 45 to 50% of red blood cells, 1% of white blood cells, <1% of platelets, and 55% of
plasma fluid [37]. The process of blood coagulation is a complex cascade that involves platelet cells, plasma
protein fibrinogen, and other clotting factors that form fibrin strands to strengthen the platelet plug [38].
Larger cells such as RBCs and WBCs are absent in this process. Moreover, they are significantly larger (about
8 to 12 µm) than platelet cells, which are involved in the coagulation cascade and can interfere with the
coagulometric detection method proposed here. It is necessary to separate the plasma before detecting the
blood coagulation cascade [39-41].
Conventionally, plasma separation is performed using a benchtop centrifuge; this is infeasible for integration
into a point of care biosensor [35]. With microfluidics, however, there are approaches to miniaturize such
traditional separation methods [42,43]. Various methods have been proposed to separate the plasma from
blood. Broadly, they can be classified as passive separation and active separation methods [35, 42-45]. To
reduce the complexity, we choose a passive approach for separating the platelet-rich plasma from blood.

blood sample is input through inlet-1 with a given flow rate. Collector channel collects the RBC rich blood component. (b)
The blood is allowed to flow through a curvature that later ends with a bifurcation. The bifurcating daughter channels are
designed in such a way that there is flow rate different in the channels. Due to the Zweifach Fung bifurcation effect
combined with the centrifugal effect, RBCs prefer flowing in the channel with a higher flow rate. (c) Plasma component of
the blood passes on to the serpentine like channel. Coagulating agent flows in through the inlet-2 and mixes with the plasma

We combine the prominent effects of Fahraeus, Zweifach Fung Bifurcation and inertia to separate larger
cells from whole blood under test [42, 45-47]. We fabricate a curved microfluidic channel with a bifurcation
which allows fluids to flow at different rates in the daughter channels. Fig. 1-a shows the schematic of the
design. Curvature in the channel results in a centrifugal force acting on the inertia-dominated red blood cells
(RBCs). The forces result in the accumulation of RBCs towards the periphery of the channel. The channel

PREPRINT

ends with a bifurcation into two channels. The dimensions of these two channels are selected to create
different flow rates. RBCs flowing through the channel accumulate towards the periphery. Experiencing the
Zweifach Fung effect at the bifurcation site, RBCs preferentially flow towards the larger collector channel
[35]. This leaves the plasma rich component in the serpentine structure, where it combines with the
coagulating agent at the sensor site. An optical sensor performs measurements on the sample and monitors
the coagulation process in real-time.
Blood is a dielectric medium which responds to an external electromagnetic field by changing the orientation
of its dipoles. The polarization in the blood sample can be orientational or deformational in nature [48-50].
Polarization changes in the optical medium are represented in terms of its refractive index ( ). We define

 as the square root of the relative dielectric of the medium . During the coagulation cascade, due to cellular
activation and molecular interactions, the dielectric constant and therefore refractive index of the blood
changes. If we model the change in the refractive index (or dielectric constant) as [50-52]

where, n plasma

as changes in resonant peaks (  ) of the optical ring resonators. The resonant wavelength for mode, m of the

3. Discussions
We first evaluate the efficacy of RBC separation from the whole blood sample. To determine the optimal flow
rate for the blood in our device, we experiment with different flow rates. The blood is purchased from
Research Blood Components, LLC, Boston, MA. Fig. 1 shows the device and representative images from the
experiments. The hematocrit concentration of blood is 38 %. It refers to the concentration of red blood cells
in the whole blood in v/v %. Fig. 1e-1j compare the device’s plasma separation ability for different flow rates.
From Fig. 1 e, it is evident that the 0.2 ml/min is not sufficient to provide the required centrifugal force and
flow rate difference to separate plasma from the blood, and we can see a significant red tinge (RBCs) in the
channel going towards the sensor. As we increase the flow rate to 0.4 ml/min and beyond, the separation

PREPRINT

efficiency increases. We can see the improved performance from the clear plasma in the sensor channel.
However, there is no significant change in separation efficiency as we go beyond 0.6 ml/min. As the flow rate
increases further, a constriction in the flow is observed (Fig. 1j), thereby reducing the separation yield.
Therefore, we select the flow rate for our sensor to 0.6 ml/min.

in resonance peak at different time stamp (TSs). (b,c,d,e) Definition of different time stamps. (f) Transient variation of ring
resonators when different concentration of Thrombin was added to the device. Higher concentration was roughly twice of
that of lower concentration.

After optimizing the flow rate of blood in the microfluidics, we perform experiments to characterize the
response of on-chip resonator cavities to coagulating blood. We use thrombin as a coagulating agent added
to the blood plasma via inlet-2 (shown in Fig. 1a). Fig. 2 shows the experimental setup used to couple in light
to the optofluidic chip through the lensed fiber tips. The inverted microscope setup assists the alignment
with a zoom lens. In general, the propagation of light energy in the photonic waveguide is accompanied by
co-propagation in the surrounding medium, labeled as evanescence, which interacts with the clotting blood
to change the effective index of the photonic waveguide. As described in equation-3, it results in a change in
the resonant peak of the ring resonators. Fig. 3-a shows the sensor response to the coagulation at different
timestamps (TS-1, 2, 3 and 4). We observe a significant redshift (shift towards higher wavelength) in the
sensor as thrombin is added. This is attributed to the fact that the addition of thrombin increases the effective
index of refraction significantly. Further, as the blood starts clotting, we observe a blue shift (shift towards
lower wavelengths) in the resonance peak. The reversal in direction of the shift could be due to the change
effective index of the medium as the cross link fibrin strands continue to grow in the clotting blood (as shown
in Fig. 3- c-e). The measurements are taken for about 3 minutes and repeated for two independent devices,
all yielding similar results. Fig. 3f shows the transient response of the sensors as the blood plasma coagulates
over time. We test it on two different devices with different Thrombin concentrations. This suggests that the
approach can be used to detect dynamic progression of blood coagulation. More controlled experiments
remain, to map different stages of blood clotting with the progressive shift in resonance peak and how it
effects its effective index.

4. Conclusion

PREPRINT

In this manuscript, we present an opto-fluidic approach for coagulation risk monitoring in COVID-19 patients
at point-of-care. With the growing pandemic of COVID-19, causing thousands of deaths worldwide, it is
customary to scale up the intensive care unit for efficient monitoring of in-hospital patients. There is
mounting evidence to show that COVID-19 viral infection leads to hypercoagulation, and thus there is a need
to perform qualitative and quantitative measurements of coagulopathy among severely ill patients. A
proposed device based on the proposed approach may offers a low cost, rapid and easy method to monitor
coagulation using a small test volume. The device combines microfluidic and photonic sensing technology.
Microfluidics performs passive separation of the platelet-rich plasma from the whole blood; the photonic
sensor detects the change in states of the clotting blood. The approach can provide real-time readouts for
representing the alterations in coagulation status ex-vivo, and is more reliable than standard clotting assays.
The existing clotting assays may distort the blood sample and can significantly affect the coagulation process.
The presented method allows us to scale a disposable technology for personalized diagnostics and treatment,
providing real-time observation of anticoagulation therapy for COVID-19 patients. Future work remains in
performing more controlled experiments to map different coagulation stages with the progressive resonant
peak shifts in the photonic sensor.

5. Methods
5.1 Fabrication
Microfluidic Chip Fabrication
Our microfluidic devices are designed on AutoCAD 2018 software (AUTODESK Incorporated., California, U.S.)
and we use an SU-8 2075 master template fabricated using standard lithography procedure. The wafers are
first cleaned using a piranha cleaning procedure. We bake the wafers at 200-degree C for at least 5 minutes
on a metal-top hot plate. Once, the wafer has roughly cooled down to room temperature, SU-8 photoresist is
spun coat on it at 2000 rpm. The wafer is baked at 65-degree C for 2 minutes and then 95-degree C for 5
minutes. Now the next step is the exposure. We use a transparency mask from Advance Reproductions
Corporation, MA, USA to pattern the SU-8. The transparency mask is printed on the high-resolution printer
(5000 dpi gives about 25-micron features). KS Aligner machine is used to expose the wafer with resist for
about 2 minutes. Once the wafer with SU-8 is exposed, we post-bake it in the following sequence. The final
step in the master mold fabrication is the development. Under hood, PM-Acetate (SU-8 developer) is poured
in the Pyrex container and the wafer is developed in the solution for about 5 minutes. With this, our SU-8
master mold is ready.
After this, we use the master mold to make our PDMS micro fluidic channel. PDMS sylgard
(Polydimethylsiloxane, Sylgard 184) is obtained from Dow Corning Incorporated. Pre-polymer components
are weighed in 10:1 ratio and mixed. SU-8 master mold wafer is placed in a petri dish and PDMS mixture is
gently poured to minimize any bubble formation in the process. Finally, the dish is placed in a convection
oven with a temperature set at 65-degree C for about 120 minutes. The PDMS is now carefully peeled from
the mold wafer and cut into smaller chips ready to use with our sensors.
As a final step, the PDMS microfluidic and the sensor chips are activated using plasma cleaner for 0.2 minutes
and are bonded together with proper alignment.
Photonic Sensor Fabrication

We fabricate the device with the process flow as shown in Fig. 3. A low pressure chemical vapor deposition
(LPCVD) system is used to deposit 400 nm thick silicon nitride (Si3N4) layer on 6-inch silicon dioxide wafer
(3-micron oxide on Si substrate). These thermal oxide wafers are procured from Wafer Pro LLC, CA. Micro
ring resonators and waveguides are designed and patterned on silicon nitride on insulator substrates via
photolithography and followed by reactive ion etching to define the geometry of the on-chip sensing
components. Fluorine chemistry with a gas mixture of CHF3 and CF4 is used in the dry etching step. Fig. 2-d
shows the SEM image of the fabricated resonators with its dimensions of the geometry of the on-chip sensing
components. Fig.3 shows the step flow of microfabrication used for the photonic sensor.
