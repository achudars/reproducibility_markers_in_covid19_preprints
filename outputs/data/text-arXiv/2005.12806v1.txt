Abstract
The move to university life is characterized by strong emotions, some of them negative, such as
loneliness, anxiety, and depression. These negative emotions are strengthened due to the
obligatory lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Previous research indicates association
among the use of social media, university satisfaction, and the aforementioned emotions. We
report findings from 248 international undergraduates in The Netherlands, all students at the
International School of Business. Our results indicate strong correlations between anxiety,
loneliness, and COVID-19-related stress with university satisfaction together with social capital.

1. Introduction
1.1. Transition to University life abroad
The transition from secondary school to a university and its academic challenge is admittedly one
of the most important moments in the development of young people (Thomas, Orme, & Kerrigan,
2020). In cases when the student decides to study abroad, the transition may be that much
harsher and more abrupt (Jackson, 2003; Rokach, 1989). Friendships or family relationships are
entering a different phase. In some cases, the transition from school to academia is more abrupt
and harsh, as students decide to study abroad. In this study, we are focusing in particular on
students we refer to as international or internationally mobile, which we define as students who
have crossed a national or territorial border for the purpose of education and are now enrolled in
institution outside their country of origin (Unesco). There is a dramatic increase in international
students enrolled in Dutch universities during the last decade. In 2018-2019 more than 85

1

thousand international students were studying in The Netherlands, representing an 11.5% of the
total number of students enrolled (nuffic.nl, 2019).
Expatriating and living abroad is accompanied by objective difficulties at all ages. Even more at
sensitive ages where psychological pressure may be greater as life experience is less (Hunt &
Eisenberg, 2010).
1.2. Psychological aspects of moving to university
In addition, this psychological pressure can be greater, as in most cases, the transition to student
life is individual, without the accompaniment of a friend or family member. That is why most
universities, recognize the importance of Introduction Weeks (Gale & Parker, 2014; Sullivan &
Kashubeck-West, 2015). Academic staff, along with psychologists and other professionals,
accompany and adapt students to the new reality, thus helping to make it easier for young people
to acclimatize and comfort the transition shock and stress (Berry, 1997; Li, Marbley, Bradley, &
Lan, 2016; Lin, 2006; Lowinger, He, Lin, & Chang, 2014).
Many times this transition is accompanied by stressful situations. Emotions become more intense
when students feel - or actually are – alone (Cacioppo, Hughes, Waite, Hawkley, & Thisted, 2006;
Richardson, Abraham, & Bond, 2012). Unfortunately, in many cases, loneliness combined with
anxiety can lead to unpleasant results.
1.2. The pandemic overturn and the COVID-19 reality
Today, stressful situations and loneliness due to the pandemic are even more intense. In
particular, in international universities where student families are often thousands of miles away
in combination with compulsory lockdown due to the pandemic, they create an explosive mix of
emotions that often leads to increased stress or even depression. The ongoing COVID-19
pandemic was confirmed to have spread to the Netherlands on 27 February 2020, when its first
COVID-19 case was confirmed. On Thursday March the 12th, the Dutch government announced
an intelligent lockdown and prohibited schools and universities to continue with face to face
education.
Research into the COVID-19 pandemic’s extensive impact - in university life in particular- is
currently in the earliest stages of development. Researchers in several branches of the physical
and social sciences are attempting to place pebbles small or large in what will eventually become
an ocean of knowledge. The present study is one such attempt, and is designed to trace the
psychological problems caused by the COVID-19 issue and will discover correlations between
2

the various emotions that an international student feels and that may be reinforced, caused or
increased by the lockdown specifically in the lived experience of international students.
2. Method
2.1. Participants
We collected data from a medium-size public university in the south central region of the
Netherlands. The research was focused on students belonging to the two international streams
of the ISB, Communication Studies (CS) and International Business (IB). Students in this specific
institution study for four years, starting with a propaedeutic year. In their third year, they study one
semester abroad at one of our partner universities worldwide followed by a mandatory internship
of one semester. IB students obtain a BSc degree, while CS students obtain a BA degree. Due
to the lockdown, surveys were only distributed online for a period of exactly one month (from 6th
of April to 5th of May). In a total of 248 valid responses, 171 were female students and 71 males,
99 students study to the CS stream, 144 in IB and 5 students are from exchange programs (i.e.
Erasmus). 105 are freshmen, 94 in their second year of study, 27 at the third, 20 at the fourth and
2 students graduated last summer. The dominant nationality is the Dutch (n=62) and Vietnamese
(n=37). We included student of Dutch nationality for two main reasons. One, the culture and
interactional environment at the university is, by design and circumstance, highly
internationalized. The lingua franca -- the primary working language -- of the university is English,
not Dutch. Two, at this university, a student with Dutch nationality would typically have been born
outside The Netherlands, likely in a former Dutch colony that before his or her birth had become
an independent nation (e.g., Aruba, St. Maarten). Such a student tends to have dual citizenship,
and therefore can claim two nationalities; and has often lived abroad for many years.

2.2 Survey design
We compiled a 98-item survey on ThesisToolPro application. The survey remained active to
accept responses for one month exactly, starting from April the 6th (reminder: the university
facilities closed due to the pandemic on the 13th of March). We collected information about
demographics, social media usage such as habits, intensity, measurable activities such as the
number of friends the university satisfaction of the students, their levels of loneliness, anxiety, and
depression as well as the psychological sense of belonging to the university community. Bridging

3

and bonding social capital were also measured, based on published scales. Scale items, survey
and relevant information can be found in Appendix A).
2.3 Scales and measures/ Internal consistency scores
Loneliness
In order to measure students’ loneliness, we used the UCLA Loneliness scale (Russell, Peplau,
& Cutrona, 1980) (see Appendix A). The Cronbach alpha for the 20-item scale was 0.9261.
Social capital
We used Ellison, Steinfield, and Lampe (2007) scales in order to measure social capital. This
scale contains items regarding the bridging the social capital and bonding social capital. The
Cronbach alpha for this scale was 0.8789.
University satisfaction
To measure the students’ experience and satisfaction from the institution we used the ThreeFactor Psychological Sense of Community scale of Jason, Stevens, and Ram (2015). Current
literature indicates that the first weeks of the new academic life of students are crucial and new
university plays a very significant role in that by welcoming, facilitating and informing the new
students (Lemma, Gelaye, Berhane, Worku, & Williams, 2012; Richardson et al., 2012). The
Cronbach alpha for the University satisfaction was 0.8588.
Social media use
In order to measure the use of social media among students, we used the social media intensity
scale from Ellison et al. (2007), the bounded self scale from Boyd and Ellison (2007) and the
liminal self scale from Kerrigan and Hart (2016). Cronbach alpha for this scale was 0.7822.
Anxiety and depression
To measure the anxiety and the depression we used the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale
(HADS; Snaith and Zigmond (2000)). The 14-item scale was divided into two 7-items scales, one
for anxiety and one for depression, obtaining a Cronbach alpha equal to 0.82 and 0.7969
respectively. The combined Cronbach alpha was 0.8604.
COVID-19
The pandemic-related scale was a rather original set of items we used based on previous
research (of course not related to COVID, since this is the first pandemic situation since 1918 and
4

the Spanish flu). In order to measure different aspects of the lockdown due to COVID-19 in
students’ life, we adapted and borrowed items from the General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7;
Spitzer, Kroenke, Williams, and Löwe (2006)), the Center of Epidemiologic Studies Depression
(LES-D; Eaton, Smith, Ybarra, Muntaner, and Tien (2004); Radloff (1991); Roberts, Andrews,
Lewinsohn, and Hops (1990)) and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R; Creamer, Bell, and
Failla (2003); Weiss (2007)) scale obtaining a Cronbach alpha equal to 0.9046.

Results
We conducted bivariate correlation analysis, obtaining some statistically significant results (Table
1). The stress, panic and anxiety from the pandemic lockdown are associated with high levels of
loneliness (c: 0.339; p: 0.01). As expected, depression is also associated with high levels of
loneliness (c: 0.410; p: 0.01). The university satisfaction is also associated with low levels of
depression (c: -0.217; p: 0.01). The lockdown experience on a student’s life is correlated to high
levels of anxiety (c: 0.710, p:0.01). This index, together with the correlation between University
satisfaction and social capital (c: 0.737; p: 0.01), represents the highest percentage of predictions
(71% and 73.7% respectively).

Regarding the COVID-19-related items, the is an apparent association, though weak, between
COVID-19 and social capital (c: -0.159; p: 0.05) and COVID-19 and University satisfaction (c: 5

0.164; p: 0.05). A possible explanation for these low indexes may be that the survey was
distributed after 23 days of lockdown where the members of the academic community had only
just begun to manage the massively unsettling changes in cognitive, emotional, and operational
functioning brought about by the surging pandemic and sudden lockdown. Many potential
respondents were benumbed, and therefore not particularly interested in completing surveys

4. Discussion
Our research interest revolves around the correlations among the psychological aspects of
international students, their satisfaction over the university, their social capital and the use of the
most dominant social media platforms. Especially for the psychological aspects, we focused on
common issues that students may confront such as anxiety, loneliness and depression.
Furthermore, the lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic crisis brought to the fore stress
issues that the students may feel, especially those living thousands of miles away from their
countries and therefore their comfort zones. Universities, as suggested by the results of this study,
can be one of the most crucial inhibitors for this category of stress or anxiety. Loneliness, anxiety,
or depression – or lately, the COVID-19-related stress psychological aspects – can be seriously
lowered down if the host institutions provide moral and psychological support to the students.
Together with that, social capital, digital friends and university colleagues can be beneficial.
What Universities can do
Surely no institution could have predicted, or been fully prepared for, a global crisis of the
coronavirus pandemic’s magnitude as it emerged in March and April of 2020. The most recent
pandemic of this scope occurred over one hundred years earlier, a world that few people alive
today can recall, characterized by sociocultural features almost wholly different from our own.
Social media have completely changed the way we act, react, study, communicate and solve
problems. Today, the entire scientific community tries to find a solution to this pandemic.
Universities have now the opportunity to create knowledge for the future. In our case, social
science universities and international schools can create infrastructures for possible future similar
crises. Our research indicates a strong connection with university satisfaction and the students’
well-being. Universities must move towards that direction and build strong relationships with the
students, in our case the international students’ community. During this crisis we learned – and
we still keep learning – to appreciate collateral values, other than the strict knowledge. We, as

6

academics, must listen to our students and create high standards regarding the connection
between them and the institution.
5. Limitations – Future implications
The problems due to the pandemic lockdown are related to time, sources and the necessity of
quick publication. We had to run the survey only for a one-month-time span sending only one
reminder to the students. This is the reason that we obtained only a 21.1% response rate (248
responses from 1150 emails). Many of the students have returned to their countries, having
limited access to the institution’s account. Furthermore, since the community needs quick results
from COVID-19-related research, we decided not to wait for a second round of responses. The
aforementioned limitations, though, can lead to future research, covering these restrictions.
Moreover, the current literature is limited and therefore, a systematic review will be necessary
and useful, in a future moment, when there will be a plethora of relevant articles. Localization of
research is another limitation we face. Further research to other international schools (outside
The Netherlands) and comparison analyses can be beneficial for science.
Finally, the present study will lead to practical implications, such as the formation of Universities
Pandemic Crisis teams all over the world with common manuals and good practices, exchanging
experience from research like the present.
