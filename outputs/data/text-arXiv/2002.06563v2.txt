ABSTRACT
The outbreak of novel coronavirus-caused pneumonia (COVID-19) in Wuhan has attracted worldwide attention. Here, we
propose a generalized SEIR model by including the self-protection and quarantine to analyze this epidemic. Based on the
public data of National Health Commission of China from Jan. 20th to Feb. 16th, 2020, we reliably estimate key epidemic
parameters and make predictions on the inflection point and possible ending time of 24 provinces in Mainland and 16 counties
in Hubei province. By an optimistic estimation, the epidemics in Beijing and Shanghai will end soon within two weeks (referring
to Feb. 16th), while for the most parts of China, including the majority of cities/counties in Hubei province, the success of
anti-epidemic will be no later than the middle of March. The situation in Wuhan is still very severe, at least based on the
public data until Feb. 16th. We expect it will end up at the beginning of April. Our predictions have been proven to be well
in agreement with the real situation. Moreover, by inverse inference, we find the outbreak of COVID-19 in Mainland, Hubei
province and Wuhan all can be dated back to the end of December 2019, and the doubling time is around two days in the early
stage.

1 Introduction
A novel coronavirus, formerly called 2019-nCoV, or SARS-CoV-2 by ICTV (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
2, by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses) caused an outbreak of atypical pneumonia, now officially called
COVID-19 by WHO (coronavirus disease 2019, by World Health Organization) first in Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei
province in December, 2019 and then rapidly spread out in the whole country of China1 . Till 24:00 Feb. 13th, 2020 (Beijing
Time), there are over 60, 000 reported cases (including more than 1, 000 death report) in China, among which, over 80% are
from Hubei province and over 50% from Wuhan city2, 3 .
To prevent the spreading of COVID-19, many cities in Hubei province have been locked down since Jan. 23rd, 2020. The
central government of China as well as all local governments, has taken a series of very strict preventive measures, such as
tracing close contacts, quarantining infected cases, promoting social consensus on self-protection like wearing face mask in
public area, etc. However, until the finishing of the first version (Feb. 17th, 2020), the epidemic is still ongoing and the daily
confirmed cases maintain at a high level.
During this anti-epidemic battle, besides medical and biological research, theoretical studies based on either statistics or
mathematical modeling may also play a non-negligible role in understanding the epidemic characteristics of the outbreak, in
forecasting the inflection point and ending time, and in deciding the actions to stop the spreading.
For this purpose, in the early stage many efforts have been devoted to estimate key epidemic parameters, such as the
basic reproduction number, doubling time and serial interval, in which the statistical models are mainly used4–9 . Due to the
limitations of detection methods and restricted diagnostic criteria, asymptomatic or mild patients are possibly excluded from
the confirmed cases. To this end, some methods have been proposed to estimate untraceable contacts10 , undetected international
cases11 , or the actual infected cases in Wuhan and Hubei province based on statistical models12 , or the epidemics outside
Hubei province and overseas6, 13–15 . With the improvement of clinic treatment of patients as well as the adoption of more strict
methods for preventing the spread, many researchers investigate the effect of such changes by statistical reasoning16, 17 and
stochastic simulations18, 19 .
Compared with statistical methods20, 21 , mathematical modeling based on dynamical equations15, 22–24 receive relatively less
attention, though they can provide more detailed insights into the dynamics of epidemic. Among them, the classic susceptible

exposed infectious recovered (SEIR) model is the most widely adopted one for characterizing the epidemic of COVID-19
outbreak in both China and other countries25 . Based on the SEIR model, one can assess the effectiveness of various measures
since the outbreak23, 24, 26–28 , which seems to be a difficult task for general statistical methods. The SEIR model is also utilized
to compare the influence of the locking-down of Hubei province on the transmission dynamics in Wuhan and Beijing29 . As the
dynamical model can reach interpretable conclusions on the outbreak, a cascade of SEIR models are developed to simulate
the processes of transmission from infection source, hosts, reservoir to human30 . There are notable generalizations of the
SEIR model for evaluation of the transmission risk and prediction on the patient number, each group of which is divided into
two subpopulations, the quarantined and non-quarantined23, 24 . The extension of the classical SEIR model with delays31, 32
is another routine to simulate the incubation period and the period before recovery. However, due to the lack of official data
and the change of diagnostic caliber during the early stage of the outbreak, most early published models were either too
complicated to avoid the overfitting problem, or the parameters were estimated based on limited and less accurate data, resulting
in questionable predictions.
In this work, we carefully collect the epidemic data from the authoritative sources: the national, provincial and municipal
Health Commissions of China (abbreviated as NHC, see e.g. http://www.nhc.gov.cn/). Then we follow the routine of dynamical
modeling and focus on the epidemics of COVID-19 inside the whole country, including 24 provinces in Mainland and 16
counties in Hubei province (with confirmed cases more than one hundred). In particular, we pay attention to the data of
Mainland excluding Hubei province (denoted as Mainland∗ ), Hubei province excluding Wuhan city (Hubei∗ ) and Wuhan. Such
a design aims to minimize the influence of Hubei province and Wuhan city on the data set due to their extremely large infected
populations compared to other regions. Without further mention, these conventions will be adopted thorough the whole paper.
By generalizing the classical SEIR model, e.g. introducing a new quarantined state and considering the effect of preventive
measures, key epidemic parameters for COVID-19, like the latent time, quarantine time and effective reproduction number
are determined in a relatively reliable way. The widely interested inflection point, ending time and total infected cases in hot
regions are predicted and validated through both direct and indirect evidences. Furthermore, by inverse inference, the starting
date of this outbreak are estimated. The analysis of overseas countries are still in progress.

2 Model and Methods
2.1 Generalized SEIR model

Figure 1. The epidemic model for COVID-19. The highlighted part shows the classical SEIR model.
To characterize the epidemic of COVID-19 which outbroke in Wuhan at the end of 2019, we generalize the classical
SEIR model23–29 by introducing seven different states, i.e. {S(t), P(t), E(t), I(t), Q(t), R(t), D(t)} denoting at time t the
respective number of the susceptible cases, insusceptible cases, exposed cases (infected but not yet be infectious, in a latent
period), infectious cases (with infectious capacity and not yet be quarantined), quarantined cases (confirmed and infected),
recovered cases and closed cases (or death). The adding of a new quarantined sate is driven by data, which together with
the recovery state takes replace of the original R state in the classical SEIR model. Their relations are given in Fig. 1 and
2/11

characterized by a group of ordinary differential equations (or difference equations if we consider discrete time, see SI).
Constant N = S + P + E + I + Q + R + D is the total population in a closed region. The coefficients {α, β , γ −1 , δ −1 , λ (t), κ(t)}
represent the protection rate, infection rate, average latent time, average quarantine time, cure rate, and mortality rate, separately.
Especially, to take the improvement of public health into account, such as encouraging wearing face masks, more effective
contact tracing and more strict locking-down of communities, we assume that the susceptible population is stably decreasing
and thus introduce a positive protection rate α into the model. In this case, the effective reproduction number becomes
ERN = β ∗ δ −1 ∗ (1 − α)T , T is the number of days since the awareness of epidemic.
It is noted that here we assume the cure rate λ and the mortality rate κ are both time dependent. As confirmed in Fig. 2a-d,
the cure rate λ (t) is gradually increasing with the time, while the mortality rate κ(t) quickly decreases to less than 1% and
becomes stabilized after Jan. 30th. This phenomenon is likely raised by the assistance of other emergency medical teams,
the application of new drugs, etc. Furthermore, the average contact number of an infectious person is calculated in Fig. 2e-f
and could provide some clues on the infection rate. It is clearly seen that the average contact number is basically stable over
time after Feb. 10th, but shows a remarkable difference between inside and outside Hubei province, which could be attributed
to different quarantine policies and implements, since a less severe region is more likely to inquiry the close contacts of a
confirmed case. A similar regional difference is observed for the severe condition rate too. In Fig. 2g-h, Hubei province
(including Wuhan) shows a much higher severe condition rate than other parts of China. Although it is generally expected that
the patients need a period of time to become infectious, to be quarantined, or to be recovered from illness, we do not find a
strong evidence for the necessity of including time delays (see SI for more details). As a result, the time-delayed equations are
not considered in the current work for simplicity.

Figure 2. (Color online) (a)-(b) The cure rate λ , (c)-(d) mortality rate κ, (e)-(f) average close contacts, and (g)-(h) severe
condition rate (see SI for their definitions) are calculated based on the public data from NHC of China from Jan. 20th to Mar.
23rd for Mainland, Mainland∗ , Hubei, Hubei∗ , Wuhan, Beijing and Shanghai separately.

2.2 Parameter estimation
According to the daily official reports of NHC of China, the cumulative numbers of quarantined cases, recovered cases and
closed cases are available in public. However, since the latter two are directly related to the first one through the time dependent
recovery rate and mortality rate, the numbers of quarantined cases Q(t) plays a key role in our modeling. Furthermore, as the
accurate numbers of exposed cases and infectious cases are very hard to determine, they will be treated as hidden variables
during the study.
Leaving alone the time dependent parameters λ (t) and κ(t), there are four unknown coefficients {α, β , γ −1 , δ −1 } and two
initial conditions {E0 , I0 } about the hidden variables (other initial conditions are known from the data) have to be extracted from
the time series data {Q(t)}. Such an optimization problem could be solved automatically by using the least-square regression
combined with the simulated annealing algorithm (see SI for details). A major difficulty is how to overcome the overfitting
problem.
To this end, we firstly prefix the latent time γ −1 in accordance with previous reports of 3-7 days5, 33, 34 . And then for each
fixed γ −1 , we explore its influence on other parameters (β = 1 nearly unchanged), initial values, as well as the population

3/11

dynamics of quarantined cases and infected cases during best fitting. From Fig. 3a-b, to produce the same outcome, the
protection rate α and the reciprocal of the quarantine time δ −1 (with an average of 4.95 days) are both decreasing with the
latent time γ −1 , which is consistent with the fact that longer latent time requires longer quarantine time. Meanwhile, the initial
values of exposed cases and infectious cases are increasing with the latent time. Since E0 and I0 include asymptomatic patients,
they both should be larger than the number of quarantined cases. Furthermore, as the time period between the starting date of
our simulation (Jan. 20th) and the initial outbreak of COVID-19 (generally believed to be earlier than Jan. 1st) is much longer
than the latent time (3-7 days), E0 and I0 have to be close to each other, which makes only their sum E0 + I0 matters during the
fitting. An additional important finding is that in all cases β is always very close to 1, which agrees with the observation that
COVID-19 has an extremely strong infectious ability. Nearly every unprotected person will be infected after a direct contact
with the COVID-19 patients5, 33, 34 . As a summary, we conclude that once the latent time γ −1 is fixed, the fitting accuracy on
the time series data {Q(t)} basically depends on the values of α, δ −1 and E0 + I0 .
2.3 Sensitivity analysis
In order to further evaluate the influence of other fitting parameters on the long-term forecast, we perform sensitivity analysis
on the data of Wuhan (results for other regions are similar and not shown) by systematically varying the values of unknown
coefficients35, 36 . As shown in Fig. 3e-f, the predicted total infected cases at the end of epidemic, as well as the the inflection
point, at which the effective reproduction number is less than 16 , both show a positive correlation with the infection rate β and
the quarantined time δ −1 and a negative correlation with the protection rate α. These facts agree with the common sense and
highlight the necessity of self-protection (increase α and decrease β ), timely disinfection (increase α and decrease β ), early
quarantine (decrease δ −1 ), etc. An exception is found for the initial total infected cases. Although a larger value of E0 + I0
could substantially increase the final total infected cases, it shows no impact on the inflection point, which could be learnt from
the previous formula of effective reproduction number.

respect to the data of Wuhan city, with reported data (red circles) obtained from NHC of China.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Interpretation of the public data
We apply our pre-described generalized SEIR model to interpret the public data on the cumulative numbers of quarantined
cases from Jan. 20th to Feb. 16th, which are published daily by NHC of China since Jan. 20th. Our study includes 24 provinces
4/11

in Mainland and 16 counties in Hubei province, whose numbers of reported confirmed cases are more than 100 at that moment.
Through extensive simulations, the optimal values for unknown model parameters and initial conditions, which best explain
the observed cumulative numbers of quarantined cases (see Figs. 4 and 5), are determined and summarized in tables in SI.
There are several remarkable facts could be immediately learnt from those tables. Firstly, the protection rate of Wuhan is
significantly lower than other regions, showing many infected cases may not yet be well quarantined until Feb. 16th (the
smaller α for Wuhan does not necessarily mean people in Wuhan pay less attention to self-protection, but more likely due
to the higher mixing ratio of susceptible cases with infectious cases). Similar lower protection rates are observed in several
other counties in Hubei province too. Secondly, a positive correlation between the quarantine time and the level of economic
development is observed. The quarantine time for Beijing, Tianjin, Shandong and Guangdong provinces are about 4 days,
which significantly increase to more than 7 days for Heilongjiang, Sichuan and Yunnan provinces. Again, the quarantine time
for Wuhan is among the longest (around 6.3 days). The short quarantine time for Hebei, Hunan, Guangxi and Hainan could be
attributed to extremely strict measures taken in these places. Finally, the estimated number of total infected cases on Jan. 20th
in all places are significantly larger than one, suggesting the COVID-19 has already spread out nationwide at that moment. We
will come back to this point in the next part.
3.2 Forecast for the epidemic of COVID-19
Most importantly, with the model and parameters in hand, we can carry out simulations for a longer time and forecast the
potential tendency of the COVID-19 epidemic. In Figs. 4 and 5, the cumulative number of quarantined cases in 24 provinces in
Mainland and 16 counties in Hubei province are predicted and compared with official data from Feb. 17th to Mar. 23rd (as
marked in red spots and taken as a direct validation). Meanwhile, the predicted cumulative number of quarantined cases and the
current number of exposed cases plus infectious cases for the Mainland∗ and Hubei∗ are summarized in Figs. 6a-b.
Overall, our forecasts show a well agreement with the validation data. And we are delighted to see the reported confirmed
cases of several provinces, like Heilongjiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Jiangsu, Hainan, Guizhou, etc., are lower than our predictions.
The real ending dates for these provinces are also earlier. Especially, the reported number of confirmed cases in Hubei∗ is
about 20% lower than our predictions (see Fig. 6b), showing the nationwide anti-epidemic measures come into play. While for
Wuhan city (and also Hubei province), due to the inclusion of suspected cases with clinical diagnosis into confirmed cases
(12364 cases for Wuhan and 968 cases for Hubei∗ on Feb. 12th) announced by NHC of China since Feb. 12th during the
preparation of our first version, there is a sudden jump in the quarantined cases. Although it to some extent offsets our original
overestimates, it also reveals the current severe situation in Wuhan city, which requires much closer attention in the future.
Towards the epidemics of COVID-19 in China, our basic predictions are summarized as follows:
1. By an optimistic estimation, the epidemics of COVID-19 in Beijing and Shanghai would soon be ended within two weeks
(from Feb. 16th). While for most parts of Mainland, the success of anti-epidemic will be no later than the middle of
March. The situation in Wuhan is still very severe, at least based on public data until Feb. 16th. We expect it will end
up at the beginning of April. Now after three months since the first version was finished, we are happy to see that our
forecasts have been proven to be well in agreement with the real situation.
2. The estimated final total infected cases (not only total quarantined cases) for Beijing and Shanghai will be around four
hundred. This number is about 13-16 thousand for Mainland∗ (exclude Hubei province), 20-26 thousand for Hubei∗
province (exclude Wuhan city) and 46-57 thousand for Wuhan city. The reported total infected cases till Apr. 30th, 2020
for Mainland∗ and Wuhan fall into our predicted regions, while that for Hubei∗ is about 20% lower than our estimation
due to the effective measures taken by the local governments of Hubei province and the powerful assistance of emergency
medical teams from other provinces of China.
3. According to the effective reproduction number shown in Fig. 6c, the inflection date for Beijing, Shanghai, Mainland∗
(exclude Hubei) is around Jan. 30th, which is close to the reported Feb. 3rd for the last one based on daily new confirmed
cases. The inflection point for Hubei∗ province (exclude Wuhan city) agrees with the reported Feb. 5th. These facts
indicate that the epidemic is now under well control in most cities in China.
4. The predicted inflection point, ending date and final number of total infected cases are summarized in Fig. 6e. In
particular, the inflection point for Wuhan city is determined as Feb. 12th (data after Feb. 9th are not included into
parameter estimation). By coincidence, on the same day, we witnessed a sudden jump in the number of confirmed
cases due to a relaxed diagnosis caliber, meaning more suspected cases will receive better medical care and have much
lower chances to spread virus. Besides, Wuhan local government announced the completion of community survey on all
confirmed cases, suspected cases and close contacts in the whole city.

there are no more new cases for 7 successive days. The table in the bottom summarizes the predicted inflection points and

Parameters are set in accordance with Table 1. (c) The effective reproduction number, (d) the estimated total infected cases at

on the estimated inflection point, ending date and total number of final infected cases in Mainland∗ , Hubei∗ , Wuhan, Beijing
and Shanghai, in comparison with the official reports.
3.3 Inverse inference on the outbreak of COVID-19
Besides the forecast, the early trajectory of the COVID-19 outbreak is also crucial for our understanding as well as for future
prevention. To this end, by adopting the shooting method, we carry out inverse inference to explore the early epidemic dynamics
of COVID-19 since its onset in Mainland∗ , Hubei∗ , and Wuhan (other regions are not considered due to their too small numbers
of confirmed cases on Jan. 20th). With respect to the parameters and initial conditions listed in tables in SI, we make an
astonishing finding that, for all three cases, the outbreaks of COVID-19 all point to 20-25 days before Jan. 20th (the starting
date for public data and our modeling). It means the epidemics of COVID-19 in these regions are no later than Jan. 1st (see Fig.
6d), in agreement with reports by Li et al.5, 33, 34 . And in this stage (from Jan. 1st to Jan. 20th), the number of total infected
cases follows a nice exponential curve with the doubling time around 2 days. This in some way explains why statistical studies
with either exponential functions or logistic models could work very well on early limited data points. Furthermore, we notice
the number of infected cases based on inverse inference is much larger than the reported confirmed cases in Wuhan city before
Jan. 20th.

4 Conclusion
In this study, we propose a generalized SEIR model to analyze the epidemic of COVID-19, which was first reported in Wuhan
last December and then quickly spread out nationwide in China. Our model properly incorporates the intrinsic impacts of
hidden exposed and infectious cases on the entire procedure of epidemic, which is difficult for traditional statistical analysis. A
new quarantined state, together with the recovered state, takes replace of the original R state in the classical SEIR model and
correctly accounts for the daily reported confirmed infected cases and recovered cases.
Based on detailed analysis of the public data of NHC of China from Jan. 20th to Feb. 16th, we estimate several key
parameters for COVID-19, like the latent time, the quarantine time and the effective reproduction number in a relatively reliable
way, and predict the inflection point, possible ending time and final total infected cases for 24 provinces in Mainland and 16

8/11

counties in Hubei province. Overall, the epidemic situations for Beijing and Shanghai are optimistic, which are expected to end
up within two weeks (from Feb. 16th, 2020). Meanwhile, for most parts of Mainland including the majority of counties in
Hubei province, it will be no later than the middle of March. We should also point out that the situation in Wuhan city is still
very severe, at least based on the public data until Feb. 16th. We expect it will end up at the beginning of April. Our predictions
have been proven to be well in agreement with the real situation.
Furthermore, by inverse inference, we find that the outbreak of COVID-19 epidemics in Mainland∗ , Hubei∗ , and Wuhan
can all be dated back to 20-25 days ago with respect to Jan. 20th, in other words the end of Dec. 2019, which is consistent
with public reports. Although we lack the knowledge of the first infected case, our inverse inference may still be helpful for
understanding the epidemic of COVID-19 and preventing similar infectious diseases in the future.
