At the front lines of the world’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic are hero-clinicians facing a lack of critical supplies including protective medical grade breathing masks and filtering materials. At the same time, the general public
is now being advised to wear masks to help stop the spread. As a result, in the absence of centrally coordinated production and distribution efforts, supply chains for masks, respirators, and materials for advanced filtration technology
are immensely burdened. Here we describe experimental efforts to nondestructively quantify three vital characteristics of mask approaches: breathability, material filtration effectiveness, and sensitivity to fit. We focus on protection
against water aerosols >0.3µm using off-the-shelf particulate, flow, and pressure sensors, permitting rapid comparative
evaluation of these three properties. We present and discuss both the pressure drop and the particle transmission as a
function of flow to permit comparison of relative protection for a set of proposed filter and mask designs. The design
considerations of the testing apparatus can be reproduced by university laboratories and medical facilities and used
for rapid local quality control of respirator masks which are of uncertified origin, monitoring the long-term effects of
various disinfection schemes, and evaluating improvised products not designed or marketed for filtration.

INTRODUCTION:

SARS-CoV-2 is an infectious virus which is believed to be
transmitted via respiratory aerosols1–3 . The threat of aerosol
spreading is of such concern that the HVAC systems of hospitals are being re-engineered from their design intent so that
infected air is released from the building immediately after
potential infection in COVID wards4 . Near the peak of an
infection curve5 , the rate of infected patients can stretch the
resources of hospitals and federal regulations have been adjusted to meet the realities of scarcity in the absence of enhanced production of personal protective equipment (PPE)6 .
This situation has set the medical profession on edge, and hospital systems in the northeast have so far responded with an
all-hands-on-deck approach to the myriad challenges posed
by COVID-197–9 . Independent researchers at local universities have also heard the call and moved rapidly to help their
regional hospitals with the local problem of insufficient PPE
such as face masks, face shields, and ventilators. Of these
three vital hospital resources, face masks capable of blocking
small virus-containing droplets require the most developed
textile technology10 . Disrupted supply chains have limited access to advanced textiles such as corona-charged melt-blown
polypropylene, a material capable of supporting electrostatic
filtration11 , which provides a high-efficiency, breathable, inexpensive and accessible mask certified as N95. With supply
chains slowly recovering, the quality and safety of masks and

respirators from new suppliers is critical to address.
Dwindling supplies of PPE in clinics and hospitals12,13
combined with the concomitant emergence of appeals for the
general population to begin donning masks14 has strained the
supply chain and led to local efforts to produce new technologies, as well as many proposed do-it-yourself mask approaches, in an effort to meet these needs9,15,16 . In this environment, many claims of efficacy are made, while the data
supporting such claims are often incomplete or lacking. Even
in the case of certified respirators and surgical masks, historical variation in the testing regimes for particle filtering and
infection control has been a complicating issue17 . In addition,
issues such as the presumed higher efficacy of N95 respirators over surgical masks in ultimately preventing infection remain controversial, with critical issues of fit and compliance
likely confounding the utility of materials with ostensibly superior filtering properties18–21 . In this time of crisis, accessible methodologies are needed which can rapidly compare
novel materials and mask designs alongside currently certified materials. This document describes an experimental apparatus, devised and developed at the University of Connecticut and in collaboration with clinicians from the University of
Connecticut Health Center during a short response period in
March and April 2020. This apparatus is capable of making
comparisons of essentially any proposed mask design with respect to filtration of water aerosol particles in the <1.0µm size
range.

at fixed environmental conditions.

A.

Overview:

Our approach relies on a simulation of the clinical
situation22 , illustrated in Figure 1a. Aerosol containing virus
particles is exhaled by an infected patient (IP) into a clinical environment (CE), where it is potentially inhaled by a
medical professional (MP). Each of these abbreviated terms
corresponds to a separate chamber in our apparatus (Figure
1b). Controlled flow of aerosolized air propagates from the
IP chamber to the CE chamber and enters the MP chamber through either (a) a mask-donning dummy head or (b)
a clamped-material tester depending on the state of two ball
valves (Figure 2c). The chambers are connected sequentially IP-CE-MP with gas flow fittings and feature calibrated
sensors capable of measuring flow rate, pressure drops, and
aerosol particle distribution in different size ranges. The two
modalities of the apparatus permit assessment of (a) a mask
on a dummy head with realistic respiratory geometry or (b)
material-only properties regarding breathability and filtration
efficiency over selected sections of a mask. Each of these
modalities provide vital information to assess the practicality
and effectiveness of protection against infectious diseases like

those born by SARS-CoV-2. The apparatus (Figure 2) consists of a fiberglass glove box (Labconco 50350, Kansas City,
Missouri, USA) with a sealable load-lock chamber mounted
on a large swinging door which can be opened/closed and
sealed quickly using toggle clamps. The large chamber of
the glove box represents the CE where clinicians are exposed
to potentially infected aerosol droplets exhaled by the infected
patient (IP). A steady flow of aerosolized air flows from the IP
through the CE and enters the pumped MP load-lock chamber
through either (a) a fit tester dummy head (Laerdal Airway
Management Trainer, Stavanger, Norway) or (b) a clamp-style
materials tester based on Kwik-Flange (KF) vacuum fittings.
Identical sets of particle meters in the CE and MP chambers
monitor particulate sizes, humidity, temperature, and pressure
on each side of the mask or material. Operation of two 43 in
PVC ball valves enables either the (a) mask or (b) material
tester, permitting various tests with the same chambers and
sets of particle detectors. A gas pump, needle valve, and flow
meter control and measure the flow through the mask or material and into the MP. Steady-state air flows into the CE from
a controlled aerosolized air source, through the CE and enters
the load-lock chamber representing the MP. Aerosol particle
distributions are measured before and after the mask or the
filter material and the experiment is repeated with an open
system and a control high-performance mask (3M-1860 N95
standard) for comparison. Pressure drop is measured simultaneously using a differential pressure meter to assess breathability of masks and materials. Below we detail different components of the system following the air flow, from IP to CE to
MP chambers.

B.

Aerosol Source:

SARS-COVID-2 is a virus around 60-140nm in diameter23
and is believed to be long-lived in airborne aerosol form, particularly in droplet nuclei, the dried-out residuals of droplets
which potentially contain infectious pathogens24–26 . The halflife of SARS-CoV-2 in water aerosol is determined to be approximately 1 hour27 . While respiratory fluid is known to contain water as a dominant component, significant other constituents besides virions are common. A respiratory droplet
0.1nL in volume has a radius 2.8µm and a mass of 100ng and
can contain as much as 1ng salt and 1ng protein. We simulate
COVID-infected respiratory aerosols with a chamber where
an ultrasonic nebulizer element submersed in water produces
Faraday surface waves and cavitation28 , emitting a plume of
fine water aerosol. Much of the water evaporates and the fine
particulate matter is determined by the residual ions. The use
of water as a particulate has advantages for testing mask and
material filtration specific to COVID-19. Water does not contaminate the system, compared to choices like saline solution
aerosols, allowing for rapid screening of alternative PPE candidates, with direct comparison to desired outcome PPE, such
as N95 respirators, within hours.
The aerosol-generating subsystem used in the experiments
presented here is outlined in Figure 2a, left side. The nebulizer consists of an immersed piezoelectric element which is

FIG. 2. (a) Schematic experimental setup with material tester engaged. Clean air is filtered and aerosolized by flowing over the surface
of water containing a piezoelectric nebulizer (Neb.) element powered by 24VAC sine pulses arriving at 0.2Hz and variable duty cycle. The
aerosolized air flows into a mixing chamber and through baffles, where it is drawn through a mask-donning dummy head (disabled in figure) or
a material clamp tester and into the MP chamber. Optical and condensing particle meters measure humidity, pressure, temperature, and count

active when driven with a 60Hz 24V amplitude sine-wave. In
order to achieve fine control of aerosol content of the air flowing through the system independently of the flow dynamics
such as pressure drop and air currents, we pulse the nebulizer
around 0.2Hz and variable duty cycle. This subsystem produces a plume of fine mist into the flow stream of the air once
every five seconds, and the duration of the plume is controlled
by varying the duty cycle of the input square wave. We find
that after the mixing stage, there is no observable time structure in the aerosol content and the distribution is unaffected
by the duty cycle >1%. The measured relative humidity level
in our main chamber is determined by ambient conditions and
rarely exceeds 40% relative humidity. In this way, fine control of aerosol content of the air flowing through the system is
realized independently of the flow dynamics such as pressure
drop and air currents.
To achieve controlled 24V 60Hz pulse duration, we use
an arbitrary waveform generator (AWG; Instek 2000 series,

Taiwan) which is amplified by a waveform amplifier (Accel
TS250, USA) to increase the current supplied to drive the element. If the nebulizer is on, we find that 45 seconds of operation completely saturates the detectors in the CE (>6.5×104
particles/sec >0.3µm). We gate the AWG with a square wave
gate pulse with variable duty cycle from a function generator
(Instek 2000 series, Taiwan). Alternatively, variable duty cycle of AC power with low-cost electronics could be achieved
using a short period repeat cycle timer or a solid-state relay
operated via a low-cost function generator.
Aerosol was sampled in the CE chamber using an optical particle detector (Fluke 985 clean room particle detector,
USA) and found to have a particle distribution mostly below
1µm, consistent with prior reports on a similar device28 after
significant evaporation. Aerosol in this range is both challenging to filter using woven or common fabric materials but
also makes up the vast majority of exhaled particulates29 so is
suitable for our apparatus.

C.

Mixing chamber:

Once the aerosolized air is pushed into the CE glovebox
chamber, two DC motor fans, arranged to set up a vertical circulating flow pattern on the left end of the glovebox chamber,
rapidly mix the aerosol and prevent settling. During this mixing process, large droplets evaporate and approach an equilibrium size distribution. Applying the standard theory for settling time and terminal speed under Stokes-law drag force developed for spherical aerosol droplets in air, we estimate the
settling velocities of the 0.3 to 1µm water aerosol observed in
our chamber to be in the range 1 to 10 cm/h, which implies
that the aerosol in the chamber would stay well mixed over a
few hours, more than sufficient to reach the mask and materials testers in the CE chamber. Solutes such as NaCl or KCl
can be added to the water in the IP chamber and control the
particulate size distribution as well as concentration.
The mixed aerosol crossed through a baffle made from two
layers of steel mesh with a 3.5mm grid pattern. Using a hot
wire anemometer, the measured air speed in the mixing chamber is of order 100cm/sec but less than 1cm/sec on the downstream side of the baffles. For a circular flow pattern of the
mixing chamber has approximately 1m circumference, we estimate the chamber churns the air 5 times per aerosol pulse
delivered 5 times/sec, consistent with the lack of detectable
time structure has been observed in the CE chamber.

D.

Particle detectors:

Aerosolized air was sampled on the right side of the CE
chamber using optical particle detectors before transiting the
mask or material into the MP chamber where a matching set
of particle meters measured the aerosol distribution for comparison. Three different types of meters are employed to span
different size distribution ranges.
Fast readout particle detectors developed by PurpleAir
(Utah, USA) are based upon the PLANTOWER 5001 (Beijing
Plantower, China) optical meters. In collaboration with PurpleAir, we have gratefully acquired test software permitting
complete readout and logging of the two detectors per unit
(two units/chamber) at approximately one second intervals.
These meters have been studied under various conditions and
correlate reasonably well with higher-performing and more
costly particle meters30 . They do not work as well in high
humidity environments (>50%), are known to have lowered
efficiency ( %50) in the finest particle channel (0.3-1.0µm)
and are designed to perform well at high particle concentration levels. These meters are used during the experiment to
make decisions during data acquisition as well as in analysis.
NIST-traceable cleanroom Fluke 985 integrating and logging optical particle detectors are placed in each chamber during a typical run. These detectors are best suited for lower
particle concentrations. The devices are programmed to collect 15 seconds with 2 minute wait times between.

An apparatus for nondestructive and rapid comparison of mask approaches in defense against infected respiratory aerosols
A single P-Trak 8525 ultrafine condensing particle counter
is used to detect integrated particle count in the 0.02-1.0µm
range. This costly device consumes reagent grade isopropanol
and is placed outside the chamber and connected to a small
ball valve manifold with equal-length tubing to the CE and
MP chambers. A single condensing particle counter was also
used and a small ball valve manifold permitted fast switching
between CE and MP chambers.

of the glovebox door to present suitable and versatile mounting options. The material tester can be accessed using the
box gloves enabling rapid swapping of the material without
the need to wait for the chambers to equilibrate. The ability to
swap out masks consecutively without altering environmental conditions is helpful for direct comparison of material approaches.

Mask tester:

A dummy head was removed from a Laerdal Airway Management Trainer, designed to give an accurate representation
of human airflow pathways. The lungs were removed and
the right main bronchus was closed with a rubber stopper and
hose clamp. The left main bronchus was also hose-clamped
onto a 12 in PVC barb fitting to to 34 in NPT pipe thread, a
short segment of vinyl tubing, and another barb into a PVC
ball valve which is open when the mask tester is in use. The
valve feeds through an acrylic door to the load-lock chamber using PVC pipe fittings and seals with an o-ring. Optical breadboard sections mounted inside the door and in the
bottom of the CE chamber provide secure mounting options
for the particle sensors as well as dummy head and materials
tester.

Materials tester:

To rapidly identify whether the fit or material are the weak
link in any proposed mask design, we have enabled an option to disable the dummy head and open the CE-MP chamber connections though a dedicated materials tester. This jig is
made active by opening a PVC ball valve connecting the MP
chamber through PVC hard line or thick-wall 43 ” rubber tubing terminating in a KF25 vacuum fitting pointing upwards
and held fixed in the center of a 6”x6” polycarbonate plate
mounted to the glovebox door. Four 14 ”-20 threaded rods in
each corner of the polycarbonate plate form a materials clamp
with a matching plate above and a second KF25 fitting. In
order to access lower face velocities, we can introduce one
of two conical adapters (KF25 to KF40 or KF25 to KF50) and
matching vacuum fittings (KF40 or KF50, respectively) to distribute the flow over a larger area. Figure 3a summarizes the
parameters achievable with each of these fittings and Figure 4a
shows the transmission and pressure drops over these choices
of fitting. This configurability permits access to face velocities up to 170cm/sec at a flow 25L/min with a 17.8mm hole on
the KF25 fitting and down to the lower value of 2.9cm/sec at
5L/min flow with the 47mm hole in the KF50 fitting. Our system could be operated at higher flows with suitable replacement of mass flow meter with a high flow mass flow meter or
controller.
Both jigs were mounted inside the glovebox door as shown
in Figure 2c in order to permit short tubes in geometries which
do not move when the door is opened. To facilitate this mounting, a small strip of optical breadboard was bolted to the inside

Experiments at various conditions indicate that pure water aerosol <1µm in diameter evaporates quickly, reaching
its equilibrium size in less than one second23,29 . Figure 3b,c
show the normalized size distribution of aerosol measured in
the MP and CE chambers, showing that for tap water aerosol
source, >90% of the observed particles are in the finest size
bin 0.3-0.5µm and there is only a weak redistribution of sizes
on transit from the CE to MP. Figure 3d shows the difference
of these plots, (MP minus CE) and reveals a small but detectable redistribution of the aerosol before and after the mask
or material testers. The shape of the distribution changes no
more than 3.3% between bins and does not significantly alter
our comparative filtration measurements of masks and materials. Note that the difference depends only slightly upon flow,
with greater change occurring for lower flow as expected from
evaporation. We estimate for the slowest flow rates used here
(5L/min), aerosol is drawn from one to another in less than 3
seconds.
In addition to changes in the shape of the distribution, there
is also a flow-dependent transmission of the total number of
aerosol particles >0.3µm through an open pipe. This arises
from a well-known effect of aerosol collisions in the connecting pipe31 - the longer the aerosol spends in the pipe, the
more chance for a collision with a pipe wall and removal
from the flow stream. As expected, we observe the lowest
transmission of an empty pipe for the lower flows. To isolate the transmission of the mask or material, it is therefore
necessary to address the loss of particles in the system when
there is no mask present. For each measurement, the number of particles N are measured for the MP and CE chambers with a mask in the clamp (Nm,MP ,Nm,CE ) as well as the
same for an open pipe or dummy head (No,MP ,No,CE ). To
account for this loss, we divide the observed transmission
Nm,MP /Nm,CE of a given mask/material by a reference measurement of the open jig No,MP /No,CE at a given flow, permitting isolation of the transmission T of the mask or material: T
= 100 × Nm,MP No,CE /Nm,CE No,CE and the filtration efficiency
is f = 100 − T . We emphasize that our goal is a comparison of mask approaches to one another rather than an absolute
certification standard.

system. The gas pump is located in a separate pump room,
connected by 14 in tubing to a constrictive needle valve which
permits fine control of the flow through the system. A thermal
mass flow meter and a protective inlet filter recommended by
the manufacturer is installed upstream and sensitively reads
the mass flow with precision of 0.001L/min. Feedback mass
flow control could be introduced easily although we find the
drift in flow is quite small.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

A.

Breathing, pressure drop, flow, face velocity:

Crucial for high performance masks is that low effort is required to inhale or exhale through a mask or mask material.
This effort is typically quantified using the pressure drop at
a given flow rate. The flow requirements on breathing are
given by the situation, which for humans at rest is around 5-6
L/min on average assuming a tidal volume of 0.5L cycled 1012 times per minute. Time-resolved measurements of human
respiration give flow rates in the range 10 L/min peak exhalation, with larger inhalation flow rates of order 25L/min. Exertional breathing in healthy humans can reach peak inhalation
flow exceeding 600L/min. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) performs tests of mask
and mask materials for N95 certification at 85L/min, where
>95% of a defined distribution of NaCl particles >0.3µm are
blocked10 .
For any mask the flow Q is distributed over the active filter material area A with a mask-averaged speed called the
face velocity v = Q/A. Some standards for mask testing like
NIOSH, specify flow, while others such as FDA specify face
velocity17 . For the NIOSH test over a typical half face respi-

rator such as the 3M-1860 of area 150cm2 , the mask-averaged
face velocity is around 9.3cm/sec while the same exercise
for a surgical mask of area 2 results in a face velocity of
14.2cm/sec17 . Processes behind filtration include inertial impaction and diffusion in addition to electrostatic effects in the
case of N9510,17 and this speed of impact determines the filtration efficiency. In what follows we will express the flow
rate as well as face velocity, the latter of which permits comparison of filter measurements which used different areas. We
emphasize that use of variable size vacuum fittings permits
wide changing of the face velocity for a given flow range as
shown in Figure 3a.

B.

Pressure drop over typical filter materials:

Breathing through a mask is always more effort than breathing without one. The resistance to flow of the mask is determined by the filter material and the fit of the mask and can
be quantified by the pressure drop at a given flow. In our experiments, the pressure difference between the MP and CE
chambers is the pressure drop over either the mask or material
being tested. We measure the pressure drop using a differential pressure meter (TSI 9565, Minnesota, USA) connected to
each chamber by tubing of equal length.
Figure 4a shows the pressure drop versus flow for the
dummy head and each of the KF fittings attached to the materials clamp. These constrictions produce a measurable pressure drop much smaller than that of typical masks and materials. Figure 4b shows the pressure drop over a set of materials
with the KF40 vacuum fitting in the materials clamp. We note
in particular the spread of pressure drops among masks labelled N95 and KN95. Large pressure drops across filter material can significantly reduce the protection of a given mask,

since the required air flow is distributed over both the mask
and leaks. At a given flow, as the pressure drop across the
mask increases, the draw of contaminants through leaks and
facial fit gaps increases. We return to this point below in section III D.
C.

Filtration efficiency of filter material:

Figure 5a shows the transmission of all particles >0.3µm
versus flow rate for certified N95s and many other materials
using the KF40 materials tester attachment. The woven bandana provides very little protection from aerosol in the size
range of our experiments, around 90% of particulates counted
were in the 0.3-0.5µm range. It does however have an appreciable pressure drop, around 60% of an N95. A surgical
mask has far superior 50% filtration efficiency compared to
a bandana but is similarly breathable with similar pressure
drop at the same flow rate. Sterilization wrap has been proposed as a highly efficient filter candidate for improvised PPE
approaches32 and sterile and readily available in many clinical settings. Compared to a surgical mask, the material has
higher filtration efficiency , but it is less breathable. While a
higher filtration aid protection, a higher pressure drop means
that to sustain a given flow, the pressure across leakages and
draw across soft points in the facial seal will support more
flow which is detrimental to protection. Another class of PPE
filter materials are HEPA-type vacuum bags and electrostatic
furnace filters. These have standardized filtration rating systems of MERV and MPR and examples are shown to achieve
very good filtration and excellent low pressure drop. Multiple layers of materials in this class could give excellent filtration in an abundant material source alternative to melt-blown
polypropylene, the finest filtration component of the electrostatic N9510 .
The logarithmic scale in Figure 5b brings out the lowtransmission region of interest for comparison of N95s for

quality control and inspection of deterioration effects from
disinfection schemes on post-cleaning filtration efficiency. All
N95, most KN95s, and a high-efficiency based upon PFTEcoated PET show >95% filtration efficiency. This last material excels at filtration but is far too difficult to breath through.
Note that one uncertified mask labelled KN95 #3 performs
poorly with only 60% filtration efficiency. While this mask
has filtration performance slightly better than a surgical mask,
the pressure drop is greater which means more flow is expected through the small leaks around the mask and may not
in fact be safer in practice. This observation highlights the importance of local testing of mask and materials of uncertified
origin as well as the need to assess both filtration and pressure
drop properties of materials.

D.

Mask facial fit:

Sections III B and III C describe materials tests of pressure
drop and filtration efficiency for materials with issues of facial fit completely isolated. Inclusion of a second test channel through the dummy head permits an assessment of mask
fit and its potentially deleterious contribution to protection.
To expose this sensitivity, Figure 6 shows the transmission of
aerosol through the dummy head with a mask labelled KN95
fitted as received and with the metal nose piece pinched. The
use of a glove box is a necessary feature for making small insitu adjustments to study the facial fit sensitivity. The drastic
improvement from >50% transmission to <20% transmission
highlights the benefits of fitment. At the same time, the degree of protection is still much less than the material alone,
which transmits less than 1%. This demonstrates the apparatus ability to rapidly compare developing mask approaches but
is limited in addressing dynamic factors such as head and jaw
movement while talking as well as variation of head forms.

CONCLUSIONS:

We have demonstrated the construction and evaluation of a
fast-turnaround apparatus capable of evaluating three important characteristics of aerosol-filtering masks: breathability
quantified through pressure drop, filtration quantified through
particulate transmission, and facial fit as determined from
direct measurements on an anthropic head form. We have
demonstrated the sensitivity of the measurements and considered sources of error in the measurement. We present comparison of high-technology electrostatic filters, surgical masks,
instrument wrap fabric, and common textiles against complete
lack of protection. The glovebox-based design concept has
many advantages such as rapid screening of many masks without disrupting aerosol generation and flow. The design can
be implemented with resources common to many universities
and hospitals and can be implemented with low-cost sensors
and electronics to screen masks that may vary substantially
from dangerously poor to very high performance depending
on the quality of the materials used.

Figure 7 details the materials tester mechanism. A flowthrough clamp is based upon Kwik-Flange vacuum fittings
to create a tight and reproduceable clamp on thin pieces of
material without invasive handling or destruction of a mask
or material being tested. The clamp can be operated with
the gloves of the glovebox, permitting direct comparison of
materials with each other or with an empty holder under the
same environmental conditions. In order to ensure the mating
flanges clamp parallel to one another and form a tight uniform
seal on the material, the KF flanges are compressed between
two polycarbonate plates using 41 -20 threaded rod as shown.
Large knobs on the clamping nuts are convenient for changing masks while using the gloves. An advantage of the KF
approach is the possibility to change the filter or mask area
being probed which leads to a change in the tested face velocity range as illustrated in Figure 3a of the main text. Details
of the clamp mechanism options for the three sizes available
for the materials tester are shown in Figure 8.
Appendix B: Direct face velocity measurements

Figure 9 shows results of an experiment using a hot wire
anemometer to directly measure the face velocity across the
open weld stub where air enters the materials tester. The
lines through the points are the volumetric flow rate divided
by measured area. This plot shows that our face velocities are
as expected and that there are no significant leaks in the MP
chamber.
