ABSTRACT
The COVID-19 related lockdown measures offer a unique opportunity to understand how changes in economic activity and traffic affect ambient air quality and how much pollution reduction
potential can the society offer through digitalization and mobilitylimiting policies. In this work, we estimate pollution reduction
over the lockdown period by using the measurements from ground
air pollution monitoring stations, training a long-term prediction
model and comparing its predictions to measured values over the
lockdown month. We show that our models achieve state-of-the-art
performance on the data from air pollution measurement stations in
Switzerland, Austria and in China: evaluate up to -29.4% / +9.8% and
-22.6% / +11.5%, change in NO2 / PM10 in Eastern Switzerland and
Lower Austria respectively; -28.1%, / -10.8 % and -52.8 % / -50.0 %
in NO2 / PM2.5 in Beijing and Wuhan respectively. Our reduction
estimates are consistent with recent publications, yet in contrast to
prior works, our method takes local weather into account. What
can we learn from pollution emissions during lockdown? The lockdown period was too short to train meaningful models from scratch.
To tackle this problem, we use transfer learning to newly fit only
traffic-dependent variables. We show that the resulting models are
accurate, suitable for an analysis of the post-lockdown period and
capable of estimating the future air pollution reduction potential.

INTRODUCTION

Air quality is of vital importance to human health. Medical studies
have shown that PM2.5 (particulate matter of diameter less than
2.5 micron) can be easily absorbed by the lungs, and prolonged
exposure may lead to respiratory impairments, blood diseases and
neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism, attention deficit disorders and cognitive delays [14]. Air pollution is also found to have
a negative effect on the cognitive functions in elderly adults [51]
and is associated with increased mortality rates [9, 34]. Furthermore, air pollution leads to enormous economic losses [15] and its
reduction is particularly important in overpopulated urban areas.
In the context of current pandemic, recent studies show that
long-term exposure to PM2.5 and NO2 increases human susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 [25, 34] and contributes to higher fatality
rates [45, 67]. There is also a worrying evidence that the virus can
be found in outdoor particulate matter [60]. Although further investigations are necessary, it seems obvious that air pollution plays

an important role with regard to both transmission and severity of
this disease. Lockdown measures of varying duration and strictness
in response to COVID-19 have shown to be effective to slow down
the virus spread in winter and spring 2020 in many countries. At
the same time, reduced mobility, working from home, accelerated
digitalization and e-commerce made researchers wonder about the
pollution reduction potential also in the context of global warming
and while preserving the basic operations of cities and counties.
The 2020 lockdown provides a unique and valuable opportunity to analyze the air quality reduction patterns. Fig. 1 presents a
comparison of measured air pollution in Wuhan, China over the
same period of time in 2019 and 2020. Due to significantly reduced
human activities, such as traffic, the concentrations of NO2 drop to
low and stable levels during the lockdown compared to the same
period in 2019 as shown in Fig. 1. Similar patterns are also observed
for other pollutants, e.g., for PM2.5 in Wuhan, China.
Although numerous studies estimate pollution reduction during
lockdown in various countries [1, 24, 25, 64], the results mostly
represent aggregated differences to various baselines with no modelling of the dependency between air pollution and the local weather
conditions, time-varying and land-use information. Moreover, a
detailed analysis of the lockdown is difficult due to its short duration and, thus, scarceness of the representative data. This paper
tackles the problem by making use of the air quality and weather
data measured by public stations operated by official authorities.
We also propose a modelling framework that enables such analysis,
and give arguments for its usefulness in broader contexts.
Today, air pollution is measured by networks of governmental
stations packed with expensive analytical instruments, satellite
images [5], IoT devices equipped with low-cost sensors [59], passive
samplers, crowdsourcing campaigns [26], etc.. Real-time data from
public and private stations can often be found online, e.g., [46].
Numerous models were developed ranging from country-scale [54]
to city-scale [27, 28, 42] and aiming to predict short-term [70] and
long-term pollution exposure [4]. Although there is a large body of
literature investigating the relationship between industry, traffic
and air pollution, it is still not well understood how changes in
economic activity and traffic affect ambient air quality [65].
Challenges. The COVID-19 related lockdown measures offer a
unique chance to build more knowledge in this area. However,
there are numerous challenges to be solved. (1) Recent studies investigating the impact of the lockdown measures on air pollution
are not correcting for the influence of weather conditions on air
pollution, which can considerably distort the obtained estimates. (2)
Strict initial lockdown measures took place only for a few weeks in

countries around the world, which complicates learning a reasonable model for the lockdown period. Later lockdowns incorporated
a different set of measures and thus can not be used to enhance
the training data. Solving the first challenge helps to accurately
compute the local pollution reductions over the lockdown period
and understand their spatio-temporal variability. Solving the second challenge enables learning from the lockdown experience by
computing different scenarios, such as estimating the air pollution
reduction due to a partial back-to-normal regime or predicting
pollution patterns if the lockdown would have happened during a
different season or if its duration would have been extended.
Contributions and road-map. IIn this paper, we solve the above
challenges by building the first long-term predictive models for the
lockdown period (LD models). We use the following pipeline to
achieve the goal: Based on the historical data over the past several years before the lockdown, we train long-term interpretable
pre-lockdown (pre-LD) models based on the Generalized Additive
Models (GAMs) and show that they achieve comparable accuracy
to the long-term and short-term models described in the literature
and evaluated on the same data. The pre-LD models are used to
predict air pollution for the lockdown period while taking weather
conditions into account. The predictions are then compared to the
actually measured values over the same period. In addition, we
leverage the additive property of the GAMs and their interpretability to train weather-aware LD models using the scarce lockdown
data. Towards this end, we fix environmental dependencies in the
models and use transfer learning to compute a new fit for only
land-use and daytime dependent parameters. We show that scarce
data over only 4 weeks of lockdown are sufficient to train highquality LD models for NO2. We use both model classes to analyze
the post-lockdown data and to estimate air pollution reduction in
different scenarios. Our approach is evaluated on two public data
sets from China and Switzerland. The code of the models is publicly
shared on GitHub1 . More generally, we argue that a combination of
the model interpretability and transfer learning notably simplifies
result validation and increases their trustworthiness. Sec. 2 summarizes a rapidly growing body of related works on modelling air
pollution exposure.

RELATED WORK

Big data has a huge impact on modelling environmental processes [40, 49], including air pollution. Even though the Earth generates data at a fixed pace, which doesn’t change no matter how
1 https://github.com/johanna-einsiedler/covid-19-air-pollution

much data is collected [55], the already collected large volumes
of observational data have been successfully used for modelling
environmental processes [10, 18, 61]. Long-term environmental
predictions are, however, largely rooted in scientific theory, which
is one of the key reasons for their predictive power [55]. Below
we summarize the related works on theory-free and theory-based
data-driven models when modelling air pollution and discuss the
challenges we face when applying these to modelling air pollution
under the COVID-19 lockdown measures.
Interpretable air pollution models. Classical dispersion models [69] are still widely used for air quality mid-term and long-term
predictions and interpretable analysis. These models identify the
root cause of air pollution from chemical, emission, climatological
factors and combinations thereof. These models are described by
a numerical function of emissions from the industry, traffic, meteorology, and other factors. A fitted model can then be used to
understand the impact of each of these factors in isolation.
Among the model-based predictive environmental models,
GAMs have shown to be able to facilitate a high degree of accuracy
while retaining explainability. Thus GAMs have been frequently
used to model air pollution [6, 7, 27, 48] and run interpretability
analysis. For example, estimating the impact of traffic and weather
on PM and NO2 [7] and quantifying the impact of weather on NO2,
PM and O3 for Melbourne [48]. Belusic et al. [6] further analyze
the impact of meteorological variables numerically in a model and
explain 45% of variance in CO, 14% in SO2, 25% in NO2 and 24%
in PM10. We apply the model selection procedure for GAMs [4] to
find the best model hyper-parameters and use log-normal pollutant
values as an independent variable [36] for better prediction quality.
Moreover, we leverage the additive property of GAM models to
tackle data scarcity when training the LD model.
Short-term air pollution exposure prediction. Recent research
results on short-term air quality prediction range from a few
hours to a few days ahead and mainly rely on deep learning models. FFA [72] is one of the first model-free data-driven methods
which forecasts air quality from meteorological and weather inputs.
DeepAir [68] was proposed to learn the air pollution patterns in a
deep manner, simultaneously considering individual and holistic influences. To further improve the model capacity, GeoMAN [35] used
a three stage attention model learned from local features, global features and temporal geo-sensory time series. This approach shows
a potential to learn the dynamic spatio-temporal correlations and
to interpret the model results. Lin et al. [37] represent the spatial

Technical Report: Transferable Models to Understand the
Impact of Lockdown Measures on Local Air Quality

correlations in a graph with automatically selected important geographic features that affect PM2.5 concentrations, and use these
features to compute the adjacency graph for the model. To conquer the challenge of sample scarcity, Chen et al. [12] proposed a
multi-task approach to learn the representations from the relevant
spatial and sequential data, as well as to build the correlation between air quality and these representations. Zhang et al. [70] found
that local fine-grained weather data is helpful to predict air quality.
Their method fuses heterogeneous weather, air quality and Pointof-Interest (POI) data to learn the interactions between different
feature groups. Ensemble methods, such as the winning solution of
the air quality prediction challenge at KDD Cup 2018 [39] are also
used to further improve the accuracy of short-term air quality predictions. However, these deep learning approaches lack the ability
to interpret the prediction results and usually focus on short-time
horizons of a few hours to a few days.
Transferable models. Transfer learning [47] promises to lightretrain a model in order to adapt the parameters to a changed
setting and requires little data. Pollution models are usually very
local and not spatially transferable, e.g., across cities and countries,
because the learned dependencies are location-specific and policies
may vary substantially across distant areas. To transfer the knowledge from a city with sufficient multi-modal data and labels to a
new city with data scarcity, Wei et al. [66] propose a method to
learn semantically related dictionaries from a source domain, and
simultaneously transfer these dictionaries and labelled instances to
the target domain. Temporal transferability of learned dependencies is difficult due to environment and policy changes over time.
For example, Cheng et al. [13] applies a learning-based approach
to solve the downscaled sensor deployment problem. They try to
transfer knowledge from a historical dense deployment to current
sparse deployment setting by finding the most similar instances
to execute the model transfer. Transferring pollution models in
space or in time requires strong assumptions about the source and
the target domains, such as shared similarities and other transferable structures. Without explicit assumptions or known structural
similarities, a model should be trained from scratch, which is dataintensive.
Impact of COVID-19 on air quality. Lockdown measures in response to COVID-19 pandemic offer a unique opportunity to improve prediction of policy impacts reinforcing work-from-home
and changing to low-emission mobility vehicles such as bicycles.
The study in [41] assessed NO2 reduction based on satellite imagery
by NASA and ESA in multiple COVID-19 epicenters. A similar assessment of the impact of SARS-CoV-2 in other areas is provided in
[5]. The relationship between air pollution and lockdown measured
was studied in [64] using satellite data and ground level sensor
data. The weather adjustment is taken into account but modelled
as a simple linear dependency. A recent report [63] estimates NO2
reduction for major European cities during the lockdown when
compared to previous years. The results suggest a reduction from
16-18 % in Budapest and Berlin to over 60 % in Paris and Bucharest.
Building a good predictive model for the lockdown period is
challenging due to a short lockdown duration of only several weeks
in most countries. In contrast to all previous efforts, we are one
of a few to provide a weather and season-compensated estimate

OVERALL FRAMEWORK

We first describe the data sets used in the paper and then present
the overall modelling framework.

DATA SETS

This section describes the data sets we use to train and test the preLD and LD models for Eastern Switzerland, Lower Austria, Beijing
and Wuhan. We also shortly describe the progress and the duration
of the lockdown measures. Note that the investigated countries
implemented very different air pollution reduction policies over the
years. Also the severity of the lockdown measures varied considerably. Both facts highlight robustness of the modelling approach
presented in the paper.
Beijing and Wuhan. We collect air quality data3 , including PM2.5,
PM10, O3, NO2, CO and SO2, from 35 stations in Beijing and 10
stations in Wuhan from Jan 1, 2016 to Feb 5, 2021. Our scripts also
fetch meteorological data4 for the same station locations every
hour during the same period of time. Each record comprises the
following parameters: weather situation (sunny, cloudy, overcast,
foggy, snow, small rain, moderate rain, and heavy rain), relative
humidity, temperature, pressure, wind speed, and wind direction
data. The initial lockdown periods in Beijing and in Wuhan were
between Jan 23 and Apr 8, 2020. Further lockdowns were considerably lighter or affected only local areas. According to the local
environmental situation for each air quality station, the stations in
Beijing are categorized into four classes as shown in Table 1: Road,
Rural, Suburban and Urban.
Eastern Switzerland. Air quality data for eastern Switzerland are
published by Ostluft5 , an organisation measuring air quality in
Eastern Switzerland and the Principality of Lichtenstein. The stations measure main air pollutants along with meteorological data.

mechanism to adapt the trained pre-LD GAM models to the LD
period (in Sec. 7). We refer to the resulted models as LD models. We
leverage domain knowledge to justify the validity of the applied
knowledge transfer: the impact of weather factors on air quality
remains largely the same despite the lockdown. We therefore, fix
the pre-LD model parameters describing the weather dependency
during the transfer procedure, and only retrain the datetime parameters that represent human mobility to obtain the LD models. We
show that the sparse data collected over the lockdown is sufficient
to generate meaningful LD models for NO2 using this approach.

The set of modalities may vary from one station to another, although NO2, PM10 and O3 are measured by all stations. Stations
are spread across the area, although bigger cities including Zurich
and St. Gallen have more than one station at representative locations. We use the data from 5 stations measuring NO2, PM10, O3,
CO, relative humidity, temperature, pressure, wind speed, and wind
direction on the hourly basis from Jan 1, 2016 to Feb 5, 2021. TThe
initial lockdown in Switzerland took place between Mar 16 and
Apr 27, 2020 [8, 57] and was much stricter than later measures.
According to the traffic conditions, the stations are classified into
three classes6 : No Traffic, Low Traffic and High Traffic. The details
are summarized in Table 1.
Lower Austria. Data for Lower Austria was obtained from
’NUMBIS’ 7 . The dataset contained half-hourly observations from
1st of January 2016 to 31st of August 2020. It included 27 and 16
spatial measurement points for NO2 and PM10, respectively. The
stations were grouped together according to the type of their location in four classes as shown in Table 1: Urban, Residential, Rural
Residential and Rural. The first lockdown in Austria took place
between March 20th and Apr 27th, 2020 [31, 43].
In all considered areas the available data has hourly time resolution. However, we use daily aggregates to build and validate our
models. We also note that the lockdown severity in Wuhan was the
highest and in Switzerland the lowest.

Framework

Fig. 2 shows the overall framework of the proposed approach. We
rely on Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) due to their popularity, accurate prediction ability and model interpretability. These
are described in Sec. 5.1. We first use pre-lockdown (pre-LD) data
comprising weather parameters and datetime features (see Sec. 5.2)
to train pre-LD GAM models. As part of the training, we rely on
the model selection algorithm described in Sec. 5.3 and validate the
obtained models in Sec. 5.4. The pre-LD GAM models are then used
to analyze the pollution reductions over the lockdown (LD) period.
As next, due to data scarcity and the inherent inability to train GAM
models from scratch for the LD period, we apply transfer learning

INTERPRETABLE LONG-TERM AIR
POLLUTION PREDICTIVE MODELS

This section describes the process of training a pre-LD model to be
later used to estimate the air pollution level if no lockdown would
have happened. We require a high degree of model interpretability for the following two reasons: (1) the prediction time horizon
should cover the whole lockdown period of several weeks and thus
the models should have sufficient predictive power for long-term
predictions, and (2) model interpretability is essential to understand
the impact of mobility drop on the reduction of air pollution and to
learn from these conclusions. For these reasons, we adopt GAMs
that have been successfully used to model air pollution in the past
research [27], yet leverage additional optimizations [4, 11] and statistical tests to ensure their robustness and optimize performance
as described below. Since pollutant concentrations vary greatly
depending on location and the surroundings of the monitoring
station, a separate model was fitted for each station.

5.1

Generalized Additive Models (GAMs)

GAMs have been proposed in 1986 by Hastie and Tibshirani [29]
and blend properties of generalized linear models with additive
models. The impact of the predictive variables is captured through
non-parametric smooth functions. These are then summed up and
related to the response variable via a link function:
𝑔(𝐸 (𝑌 )) = 𝑠 1 (𝑥 1 ) + 𝑠 2 (𝑥 2 ) + ... + 𝑠𝑝 (𝑥𝑝 ),

(1)

where 𝐸 (𝑌 ) is the expected value of the dependent variable 𝑌 , 𝑔(·)
is a link function between its argument and the expected value
to the predictor variables 𝑥 1, ..., 𝑥𝑝 , and 𝑠 1 (·), ..., 𝑠𝑝 (·) denote nonparametric smooth functions. The statistical distribution of the
concentration of air pollutants, similarly to many other environmental parameters, closely follows a log-normal distribution [36].
Thus, a logarithmic link function 𝑔(·) has been chosen similarly to
[27]. The instance of our GAM model is therefore
ln(𝑌 )

=

𝑎 + 𝑠 1 (𝑥 1 ) + 𝑠 2 (𝑥 2 ) + ... + 𝑠𝑝 (𝑥𝑝 ) +

(2)

+𝑏 1 · 𝑍 1 + 𝑏 2 · 𝑍 2 + ... + 𝑏𝑞 · 𝑍𝑞 + 𝜖,
where 𝑎 is the intercept, 𝑍 1, ..., 𝑍𝑞 denote categorical variables along
with their respective weights 𝑏 1, ..., 𝑏𝑞 and 𝜖 is an error term.

5.2

Explanatory Variables

The explanatory variables we use comprise meteorological variables: wind speed (WS), wind direction (WD), precipitation (P),
temperature (T), dew point (DP) and relative humidity (RH). To
ensure an accurate feature representation of the wind direction, the

Furthermore, an additional variable is created by applying principal
component analysis (PCA) on precipitation, humidity, dew point
and temperature. PCA is a dimensionality reduction method to
reduce the mutual correlations between included variables. The
first component is added to the set of explanatory variables as ‘PCA’.
We augment the set of explanatory variables with their lagged
versions for one, two and three days. Wind speed (WS) and PCA are
augmented with their respective rolling averages over the previous
weeks. In addition, a categorical variable for month (M) and a
variable for day of the year (DY) is included to account for seasonal
patterns.

5.3

Model Selection Algorithm

For the selection of the model covariates we use a forward elimination procedure. The algorithm closely follows the framework used
in similar research designs in the environmental sciences [4, 11].
Two key indicators are used for the model selection: the Akaike
Information Criterion (AIC) [2] and the Variance Inflation Factor
(VIF) [19]. The AIC is an estimate of the in-sample prediction error
that is commonly used to compare the quality of different statistical
models for a given data set [30]. The aim of the indicator is to regularize the model by balancing the goodness-of-fit against model
complexity and thereby avoiding both underfitting and overfitting.
The AIC is calculated as follows:
𝐴𝐼𝐶 = 2𝑘 − ln(𝑙),

(4)

where 𝑘 is the number of model parameters, and 𝑙 denotes the
maximum value of the model likelihood.
The VIF measures the degree of collinearity between independent variables, i.e., if they have a close to linear relationship and
are thus not independent from each other. Collinearity may cause
problems in regression-like techniques as it inflates the variance of
regression parameters and thus may lead to wrong identification
of the relevant predictors [16]. The VIF is calculated as follows:
𝑉 𝐼 𝐹 = 1/(1 − 𝑅𝑖2 ),

(5)

where 𝑅𝑖2 is the coefficient of determination of the regression of the
𝑖-th variable with all other explanatory variables.
Model selection algorithm. Our implementation of the model
selection algorithm closely follows [4]. The algorithm executes as
follows: (1) For each explanatory variable we fit a GAM model
comprising just this single variable. The model with the lowest
AIC is selected. (2) We iteratively search for the next best variable
to be added to the existing model. Variables with 𝑉 𝐼 𝐹 > 2.5 are
filtered out. Among the constructed candidate models, the one with
the lowest AIC is chosen. The threshold of 2.5 corresponds to the
coefficient of determination 𝑅 2 = 0.6. This conservative threshold
setting was deemed appropriate taking into account the frequent
interactions, and thus collinearity, between weather variables. Scientific papers dealing with weather data often adopt the threshold
of 2.5 [4], whereas higher cut-off values, e.g., 4, 5 and 10 are found
in the literature [11, 33, 44]. Step (2) is repeated until the addition
of any other explanatory variable leads to an increase of AIC.

The results of the model selection algorithm for all stations in
China and Switzerland are displayed in Table 2. The value of each
cell represents the frequency of the corresponding explanatory variable being selected into the GAM models. Only occurrences chosen
by the model selection algorithm are listed in the table. Ultimately,
the Weekday variable (D) was explicitly added to all models where
it hasn’t been automatically selected. This decision was made to
specifically take into account weekly pollution periodicity patterns
to reflect the traffic changes during the lockdown period. This technique has been used in a similar research design to analyse the
long-term air pollution trends [4].

5.4

Model Validation

We assess the quality of the trained pre-LD models using crossvalidation. The results for NO2 and PM for Switzerland, Beijing
and Wuhan are shown in Fig. 3. Taking into account the temporal
dependencies in the air pollution data, the models for different
stations are fitted on 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months of train data prior
to a chosen date and tested on the data from the subsequent month.
The chosen cut-off date is the start of each month in the year 2019.
We observe that two years of data is necessary to train the pre-LD
GAM models of good quality. Considering more historical data does
not substantially improve the model accuracy. For this reason, all
further evaluations are based on the pre-LD models trained on two
years of data preceding the lockdown in each region.
Eastern Switzerland. For the Swiss stations the model has an
average RMSE in cross validation of 7.16 for NO2 and 4.99 for PM10.
Barmpadimos et al. [4] use GAM models fitted on detailed weather
data to analyse PM10 trends in Switzerland. Their models fitted on
16 years of data reach a RMSE between 2.2 and 3.2 for PM10 for
large test data sets, see Table 3. We thus conclude that the quality
of the obtained GAM models is comparable to published results.
Beijing. For the stations in Beijing the average RMSE for PM2.5
in cross validation is 29.41. Zhang et. al. [71] compare different
models for short-term (between 6 h and 24 h) PM2.5 predictions
in Beijing over 2016-2018. The RMSE of these short-term models
ranges between 26.9 and 44.1. Thus, our model matches well the
performance of the current state-of-the-art predictive short-term
models, while predicting a much longer time period and allowing
for an immediate analysis of the fitted dependencies. In contrast
to these short-term predictive models, however, our GAM models
need much more (two years compared to a few days) training data
to achieve acceptable accuracy. We note that historical weather
data is often publicly available, which makes model training on
large historical data sets possible.
In the next section, we use the trained pre-LD models to estimate
pollution reduction due to the COVID-19 lockdown measures.

IMPACT OF COVID19 ON AIR POLLUTION

Conceptually, estimating the impact of intervention measures on air
pollution shares similarities with evaluating the impact of medical
treatment on the disease progression [38]. Following the standard
evaluation procedure, one would have to first randomly assign days
to either the pre-lockdown or the lockdown condition and then
estimate the impact of policies by calculating the mean difference.

Obviously, random assignment of days to the condition is not feasible due to the inverse causality. Therefore, different approaches are
implemented in the literature.
The most common is based on the comparison of the measured
air pollution over the lockdown period in 2020 to the same time
interval in 2019. However, air pollution is known to depend on
weather conditions, their recent history, season as well as policy
updates that prohibit an accurate estimation of pollution reductions due to COVID-19 lockdown interventions. In this section we
provide pollution reduction estimates that take weather-related
parameters into account. In the next section, we introduce a way

to refine these estimates using the measurements during the lockdown.
Local weather highly impacts the daily change of air pollution.
In Fig. 4, we compare the weather conditions during the lockdown
period in 2020 and during the same period in 2019. We observe
that in Austria, variation of temperature was higher in 2020 than
in 2019. For Switzerland we see that the lockdown weather was
warmer, dryer, and less windy than in 2019. Similar observations
apply to Beijing and Wuhan. In addition, we notice a change in the
wind direction, which is a significant pollution predictor in these
regions due to a strong pollution transfer phenomenon [70]. The
significant role of wind in the Beijing and Wuhan models is also

reflected in Table 2 by a high number of the pre-LD GAM models
where WS, WX and WY were chosen as important explanatory
variables by the model selection algorithm.
To estimate pollution reduction during the lockdown, we leverage the pre-LD models trained on the pre-LD data as outlined in
Sec. 5, and use these to predict air pollution concentrations over
the lockdown period. We then compute the difference between
the predicted and actually measured values to estimate the impact
of the lockdown measures in each region. Overall, the estimated
pollution change over the LD period compared to the same time
period in 2019 evaluates up to -29.4% / +9.8% and -22.6% / +11.5%,
change in NO2 / PM10 in Eastern Switzerland and Lower Austria
respectively; -29.4%, / -10.8 % and -52.8 % / -50.0 % in NO2 / PM2.5
in Beijing and Wuhan
Eastern Switzerland. Since NO2 is highly impacted by traffic, we
put the obtained NO2 reduction estimates in the context of traffic
reduction reported by Apple and Google based on the observed
change in usage of their services.
The Apple Mobility Trends Report [3] publishes aggregated estimates of the changed driving behavior of their users based on
the navigation requests. The data suggests an average reduction of
driving activity in Switzerland of 40.4 % compared to the baseline
of Jan 13, 2020. As shown in Table 4, this traffic drop translated
into a reduction of NO2 between 78.4 % and 35.5 % for Low Traffic
and High Traffic stations respectively as predicted with our models,
when using the same baseline. Fig. 5 compares the output of the
pre-LD models to the observed values in 2019 and 2020 for these
classes. For the station located off the road, we find an increase of
40.8 %. In this case, the average NO2 is very low and any marginal
change results in very high percentage variations. These likely can
be attributed to weather phenomena not captured by our explanatory variables. A similar increase of 27.4 % was reported by [24] for
another rural station in Switzerland.

Counter-intuitively, we found an increase of PM10 concentrations over the lockdown period despite reduced traffic intensity.
However, an intense Sahara dust event occurred in Switzerland during the lockdown month starting on Mar 26, 2020 [56, 58]. Sahara
dust events are known to significantly increase PM concentrations
in southern and middle Europe. Studies in Greece found Sahara
dust contribution to PM2.5 of up to 82 % for severe events [52]. A
similar investigation in Turkey [32] indicates that Sahara dust is
responsible for the increase of PM10 concentrations of up to 96 %.
As can be seen in Fig. 5 the Sahara dust event in Switzerland resulted in a major increase in PM10 values which is not captured
by our explanatory variables and explains the overall increase in
PM10 despite reduced traffic.

The Google Community Mobility Report [23] offers statistics

e.g., a reduction of time spent in grocery stores of 13.1 % and a
reduction of transit of 48.8 %. Using the same baseline, our model
indicates a reduction of NO2 of 30.0,% for Low Traffic stations and
of 26.7 % for High Traffic. For the No Traffic station as well as for all

which caused unexpectedly high values in the measurements during the lockdown period in the beginning of 2020.
classes for PM10, we again observe an increase due to the reasons
explained above.
We show example predictions for Low Traffic and High Traffic
stations in Switzerland in Fig. 5. We observe that the measured
NO2 and PM10 values differ significantly from the values in 2019
for the same time period. For the majority of days, measured NO2
concentrations lie below the pre-LD model predictions. This is,
however, not the case for PM10 for the reasons given above.
Beijing and Wuhan. We estimate an average NO2 reduction of
28.1 % and 52.8 % over the whole lockdown period for Beijing and
Wuhan, respectively. A comparison of our weather-aware predictions to the published results [5] obtained based on the analysis of
the satellite images over the lockdown period (see TROPOMI [5]
and OMI [5] is shown in Table 6). These estimates are for the same
period as analysed in [5], lasting from February 11th 2020 to March
3rd 2020. Our results for NO2 reductions fall within the confidence
intervals of the satellite imagery based predictions.

Despite the estimated overall traffic reduction of 70 % for Beijing [5], the estimated PM2.5 concentrations over the lockdown
decrease only slightly decrease by 10.8% over the whole lockdown
period. Similar results were also obtained for Beijing when using
the Chemical Transport Model [69]. The explanation provided in
the research literature attributes this to the impact of high ozone
along with the considerably reduced NO2 that led to the increased
oxidation capacity in the ambient air [22, 50]. This resulted into
more intense particle formation from the agricultural emissions,
e.g., ammonia (NH3), brought into the city with the wind. Our statistical model does not model pollutant interactions and thus does
not capture these effects. Interestingly, in Wuhan there is no evidence that a similar increase of oxidation capacity occurred during
the lockdown. This observation is aligned with our predictions for
Wuhan that show an estimated reduction of PM2.5 of an average
52.2 % over the lockdown period.
The average predictions for urban and rural stations in Beijing
are exemplified in Fig. 6. Measured NO2 values are significantly

below pre-LD predictions, whereas measured PM2.5 concentrations
are very close to the predictions by the pre-LD model. For the PM2.5
predictions, both the LD and pre-LD models fail to accurately predict two spikes in the beginning of the considered period, as shown
in the green zones of Fig. 6. The reason for this is the pollution
transfer phenomenon: Air pollution is brought by the wind from
the surrounding non-lockdown cities to Beijing [17], and results
in unexpectedly high measured air pollution concentrations in the
city [72]. Our proposed method could be easily adapted to acquire
better prediction results by including prior knowledge about the
pollution propagation patterns that are specific to Beijing [73]. This
is, however, out of scope of this paper, yet would be interesting to
model as part of future work. Apart from these two spikes highlighted in the plot, our proposed LD model achieves reasonable
prediction accuracy compared to the observed ground truth values
in 2020.
Lower Austria. For Lower Austria, an overall decrease in NO2 of
22.6% has been observed over the lockdown period. This closely
matches the 23% reduction that has been estimated for the city of
Vienna in a recent study based on satellite data [63]. As Lower Austria is surrounding Vienna, this is an indication that the developed
model is in line with other research in this area. Regarding PM10,
an increase of an average 11.5% is observed during the lockdown
period. Although, this might seem counter intuitive, meteorologists
ascribe a large part of the variability of PM10 in Lower Austria to
Sahara dust events and the still high number of wood fired ovens [?
? ]. As these variables are not included in the model, this can lead
to deviations which are not explained by the model. Lockdowns
further lead to an increase in the amount of time people spend at
home which potentially led to heavier usage of wood fired ovens
and thus raised PM10 levels.
Taking a closer look at the different classes of stations, shows
that, as listed in Table 7 the NO2 reduction in rural areas amounts to
only 8% whereas the highest reduction of 33% has been observed at
stations in an urban environment. With NO2 being highly affected
by traffic volume, these results are in line with environmental theory. For PM10 the opposite holds true, an increase of 17% is observed
in rural areas whereas no change of patterns (+0.4%) occurred in
cities. This is another indicator that the overall increase in PM10

Table 7: Estimated pollution reduction in Lower Austria
can be attributed to wood fired ovens as these are more common
in less urbanized parts of the country.
We also provide the spatial distribution of the pollution reductions over the lockdown period across all stations in our data sets
in Fig. 7. When comparing major cities under analysis (Wuhan and
Beijing in China; St. Gallen and Zurich in Eastern Switzerland), we
conclude that NO2 and PM reductions were higher in cities with
stricter enforced intervention measures. Given the influence of
non-traffic related phenomena on PM2.5 and PM10 in Switzerland,
Austria and Beijing, we consider only NO2 in further modelling. We
note however that PM2.5 reduction in Wuhan was not affected by
these events and confirms our expectations. We observe an average
95.4 % reduction of PM2.5 in Wuhan when comparing our pre-LD
model predictions to measured values (see Table 6).

LEARNING LOCKDOWN MODELS

In the previous section we showed how to accurately estimate
pollution reduction with a pre-LD model by comparing the model
predictions to the actually measured values. The lockdown period
gives us the bottom-line by how much humans in different regions,
given their cultural and political differences, can reduce their activities in a fear of getting infected by a virus. Having a bottom-line is
useful when evaluating future policy changes, sector restructuring
due to technological advances, process optimizations, etc.. In this
section we describe the construction of the LD models by transfer
learning and show the value of both models in the analysis of the
developments in the post-lockdown period.
Transfer learning is a popular technique to apply the knowledge
gained by solving a particular talk to a related task [66]. Since
the lockdown period was too short to fit GAM models for this
time period, we apply transfer learning to pre-LD models to derive

models for the lockdown period. In this step we re-train the models
on the scarce lockdown data to only fit the variables where we
suspect the dependencies may have changed due to lockdown, i.e.,
the day of the week. These variables serve as proxy for the traffic
intensity. All weather dependencies in the LD model are considered
to be the same as in the pre-LD model, which is confirmed by the
domain experts. Therefore, the knowledge gained with regards to
the influence of the weather and seasonality on air pollution can
be transferred to the lockdown period. Thus, there is no need to
train the entire model from scratch.

Model Validation

Due to the scarcity of measured data over the lockdown period,
we validate the model by cross-validation using only 3 successive
days as test data. The remaining data from the lockdown period is
then used for training. This way, we get 14 estimates for the out of
sample prediction RMSE. The summary of the average RMSE values
for the lockdown model can be found in Table 3 and shows similar
or better model performance for NO2 compared to the quality of the
pre-LD models. For NO2 in Eastern Switzerland, we can clearly see
that the LD model closely matches the observed values. On average,
the LD models have a RMSE of 7.03 whereas the pre-LD models
have a RMSE of 7.16. This shows that the fine-tuned LD model
reflects well the dependency between air pollution and explanatory
variables for the short lockdown time period. For Austria the model
performance improvement is even more pronounced: The pre-LD
model reaches a RMSE of 4.5 while the LD model achieves 3.7.
Similarly, for Beijing and Wuhan we obtain errors for LD models of
13.08 and 12.26 for both cities respectively, compared to the RMSE
of the pre-LD model of 13.38 and 14.61. Model validation based on
NO2 data shows that the LD model does a good job in modelling

show that the LD model can indeed be useful to analyze the impact
of traffic reduction on air pollution.

Evaluation of the Post-Lockdown Period

We now use both models pre-LD and LD to investigate the optimal
mixture thereof capable of explaining the observed pollution values
after the lockdown period. By doing so we aim to estimate to what
extent have human mobility and the inherent traffic gone back
to normal. To run this analysis, we minimize the absolute sum of
differences between the true observations and the mixture of the

dependent variable 𝛼 shows the contribution of the LD model when
explaining the post-lockdown pollution measurements. The results
of this analysis for all areas are summarized below.
Eastern Switzerland. For Eastern Switzerland we analyze the data
after the initial lockdown, which covers the time period between
May 2020 and Feb 2021. The results in Fig. 11 show that the first
months following the initial lockdown are close to the lockdown
situation. Over summer the mobility gradually resumes back to
∼50 % normal again. However from Oct 2020 onwards, we can again
observe a considerable traffic reduction due to mobility reducing
measures put in place by the Swiss government in response to
rising numbers of COVID cases [20]. From Dec 22, 2020 until the
end of our dataset (Feb 5, 2021), Switzerland has been put under
a lockdown again [21, 62]. However, our model estimates a low
reduction this time (between 18 % and 24 %)for the traffic exposed
stations. The reason for this is only a limited decrease of traffic density: According to the mobility estimates by Apple [3], driving in
Switzerland reduced by on average 40 % throughout the initial lockdown in spring 2020, whereas during the second ongoing lockdown,
only a 15 % reduction has been observed.
Beijing. In Beijing the second lockdown was imposed between
June 15, 2020 and Sept 1, 2020. For this time period we estimate a
reduction in NO2 of 11 % for rural, 15 % for urban, 7 % for suburban
and 23 % for road stations. These comparatively small reductions
are to be expected as the second lockdown hasn’t been nearly as
strict as the first one. As shown in Fig. 12, only in October, NO2
values came back to their typical pre-COVID-19 levels in Beijing.
Since Dec 29, 2020 a light, partial lockdown has been in place in
some areas of Beijing [53] which resulted in a sudden return to

7.3

Hypothetical Year-Long Reductions

We can use the LD model to predict the impact of the hypothetical
traffic reduction policies on air quality. We demonstrate this using
the year 2019 as an example and base the LD model predictions
using weather traces from the whole year. The estimated impact
of a hypothetical year-long lockdown on NO2 reduction between
Jan 1, 2019 and Dec 31, 2019 is compared to the measured values in
2019. The results are summarized in the last column of Table 8.
Eastern Switzerland. For the no traffic station in Eastern Switzerland we only find an increase of 0.7%, which is plausible as this
station is only affected by traffic to a very small degree. For Low
Traffic and High Traffic we find an estimated reduction of 34.5 % and
29.4 %, respectively. These numbers show that also for a country
with very low air pollution levels, traffic reduction can still have a
considerable impact.
Lower Austria. For rural stations in Lower Austria reduction potential is only 11.7% which is in line with our expectations as these
stations are usually located far off big streets. The highest estimated
reduction is found for urban areas, where our model suggests a
36.4% decrease under lockdown conditions throughout 2019.
Beijing and Wuhan. For Beijing we observe an average estimated
NO2 reduction between 43.4 % and 32.6 %. This shows a huge potential the traffic drop may have in cities suffering from toxically
high air pollution such as Beijing. Also for Wuhan we estimate a
reduction potential of 60.4 % if the lockdown measures would have
been in place during the whole 2019. However, it must be taken
into account that the lockdown in Wuhan was much stricter than
in Beijing and thus overestimates the reduction potential if keeping
mobility at a reasonably low level.

by ground measurement stations. Related works base their estimates of pollution reduction by comparing the values to the same
period in 2019 or by the analysis of the satellite imagery. By contrast, our model learns a dependency between local air quality and
weather augmented by the daytime specific dynamics impacted
by the land-use and traffic. We build long-term prediction pre-LD
models using two years of historical data for the stations in Eastern
Switzerland and China and compare the respective predictions to
the measured values over the lockdown. Our analysis and findings
match recent literature and show significant decrease in NO2 in
all areas, yet a minor decrease or even an increase of PM10 and
PM2.5 concentrations over the lockdown in Eastern Switzerland
and Beijing, respectively. The reasons lead back to a major Sahara
dust event spotted in Switzerland [56, 58] over the lockdown period
and an increased oxidation capacity in Beijing [17] that caused
a higher than expected impact of the agricultural pollution from
suburban areas brought to Beijing with the wind.
Due to a short lockdown duration it is impossible to learn a
meaningful model for the lockdown period from scratch. To overcome the problem, we use transfer learning to re-train only a subset
of explanatory variables on the scarce lockdown data. The resulting
LD models provide a bottom-line for the pollution reduction in
various areas due to lockdown interventions of different strength.
Both models match the quality of the state-of-art air pollution models described in the literature and were applied to the analysis of
the post-lockdown period. We found that the society restored its
mobility patterns in urban areas up to 58 % in Eastern Switzerland
within two months following the lockdown. Mobility in Beijing
was kept low up to 94 %, whereas the strictness of the lockdown in
Wuhan was relaxed up to 65 %. These results should be interpreted
in the context of varying severity of the lockdown measured in
these areas. We also estimate a hypothetical whole-year pollution
reduction for 2019 if the lockdown interventions would have been
applied for a year. This would result in hypothetical 18.1 % and

54.2 % NO2 reduction in Eastern Switzerland and Beijing respectively. Thus, the proposed modelling framework can be used for
the analysis of future policy changes in this context.
In this paper, we show how transfer learning can be used to update air pollution models should the weather relationships, policies
or human activity change. Due to a known model structure and
interpretability, it is easier to ensure validity and trustworthiness of
such updates and support automated decision making and control.
In the future, we plan to extend the LD and pre-LD models to spatial predictions by incorporating land-use data similar to [27], and
provide a visualization tool to show the effects of various policy
measures and compare these to the lockdown baselines.
