Abstract: The sudden outbreak of the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) swept across the world in
early 2020, triggering the lockdowns of several billion people across many countries, including
China, Spain, India, the U.K., Italy, France, Germany, and most states of the U.S. The transmission
of the virus accelerated rapidly with the most confirmed cases in the U.S., and New York City
became an epicenter of the pandemic by the end of March. In response to this national and global
emergency, the NSF Spatiotemporal Innovation Center brought together a taskforce of international
researchers and assembled implemented strategies to rapidly respond to this crisis, for supporting
research, saving lives, and protecting the health of global citizens. This perspective paper presents
our collective view on the global health emergency and our effort in collecting, analyzing, and
sharing relevant data on global policy and government responses, geospatial indicators of the
outbreak and evolving forecasts; in developing research capabilities and mitigation measures with
global scientists, promoting collaborative research on outbreak dynamics, and reflecting on the
dynamic responses from human societies.

1. Introduction
In December 2019, a viral disease was transmitted in Wuhan, China. Many people showed
symptoms of coughing, sneezing, and breathing difficulties, and dozens of people with pneumonia
were treated and hospitalized in Wuhan [1]. While early announcements contended that the disease
was not contagious and many popular gatherings were held as scheduled in early January, the
disease was found to be caused by a novel coronavirus, and was confirmed later that it can spread
from person to person. Early analyses estimated the reproduction number R0 of approximately 2.0,
meaning that an infected person on average would spread the disease to two others, comparable to
SARS and MERS [2]. Consequently, Wuhan city, a metropolitan area with 11 million people, was
locked down with strict stay-at-home orders, and the shutdown quickly expanded to the entire
province of Hubei [3]. The disease later caused the lockdown of many Chinese provinces in February.
Eventually, China had to halt its economy for the entirety of February and most of March to contain
the transmission [3]. The World Health Organization (WHO) named the disease COVID-19. Despite
China’s effective and decisive efforts in containing the outbreak since late January 2020 by locking
down the most populous country and the second largest economy in the world, unfortunately, the
disease quickly spread around the world[4]. Over twenty-seven thousand people lost their lives in
Italy alone by April 28 (https://github.com/stccenter/COVID-19-Data/tree/master/Italy) and its
healthcare system almost collapsed. Ventilators had to be moved from older people to save the lives
of those younger ones [4].
The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) observed the outbreak closely and
issued emergency advice in mid-February (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/). While
only a few cases were confirmed in the U.S. in late January, the outbreak was severe in many states
by March, with hundreds of thousands of cases confirmed around the country. New York City
became the world’s epicenter in March and the White House declared a national emergency in
response to the fast and widely spreading COVID-19. Many states announced stay-at-home orders
(lockdowns) on a household basis. While the daily confirmed cases were on a declining trajectory in
20 states of the U.S. by late April, and many governors planned to reopen the economy, concerns
were aired on many different aspects:
•

The reproduction number of R0 was recalculated to be approximately 6, three times more
contagious than the initial 2.0 [5]. Many leaders around the world were unaware of this
contagious magnitude, and thus lost the best (early) time to contain the outbreak.

Fundamental questions, such as the infectious dose, remain unknown[6]. Furthermore, how
long the virus can stay alive in an environment spans a wide range from hours to 7 days,
depending on the conditions [6]. Although all evidence shows the virus is natural and
transferred from bats or possibly via an intermediate mammal species, the transferability from
species to species is unknown, especially from animals to humans [6,7].
Although most people infected will develop symptoms within 14 days, there are healthy people
carrying the COVID-19 virus who show no symptoms (asymptomatic) but are also contagious
and could become dangerously contagious sources without self-knowledge [8]. For example,
Baggett [9] reported 147 residents out of 408 (36%) residents (at a large Boston shelter) were
tested positive for COVID-19 and only a small proportion of them showed coughing (7.5%),
shortness of breath (1.4%), and fever (0.7%) among the test-positive individuals. The virus could
become deadly when spreading rapidly through these asymptomatic carriers once normal
activities resume in metropolitan areas.
Singapore, thought to be the model for containing the virus from the beginning with under 100
confirmed cases by early March, saw the outbreak resurge with over 100 confirmed cases per
day
in
late
March
and
approximately
1000
per
day
in
late
April
(https://github.com/stccenter/COVID-19-Data/tree/master/Global). While it was found to be
transmitted especially among the disadvantaged laborers in the city state, the outbreak triggered
an alarm against reopening economies around the world.
Africa is becoming an epicenter since late April, with an estimated 120 million people predicted
to be infected eventually and millions of lives to be lost [10]. The developing economic status of
these countries and the lack of health facilities and ventilators, critical life-support devices for
people with severe symptoms will make the situation in Africa much worse [11].
Most recent studies argue that the virus is not likely to disappear and will persist like HIV and
other viruses. Stay-at-home measures were suggested as regular practice until a vaccine is
developed and can be administered broadly [12].

With the novel virus found in almost every country, infecting over three million people and
taking more than two hundred thousand lives in four months (https://covid19.stcenter.net/index.php/covid19-livemap/), this global crisis triggered a pandemic declaration by
WHO on March 11, and national emergency declarations by many countries [13]. The NSF (National
Science Foundation) Spatiotemporal Innovation Center brought together a taskforce of international
researchers and assembled implementation strategies to rapidly respond to this crisis (https://covid19.stcenter.net/). The goal is to support research, save lives, and protect the health of global citizens.
This paper reports our understanding and perspectives of the disease outbreak from a spatiotemporal
perspective.
Section 2 introduces the spatiotemporal principles and foundations supporting our analyses and
understanding of the spread of COVID-19. Section 3 analyzes the spatiotemporal patterns of the
spreading of the virus around the world and in the U.S., and global and U.S. policies and
administrative measures using the Oxford stringency index [14]. It assesses the consequences of the
outbreak to the environment, economies, human mobility patterns, and societies, and to forecasting
and strategy-setting. This section reflects our efforts in dealing with a moving target, with more data
emerging daily, revealing new characteristics, and patterns of the disease. Section 4 concludes with
the spatiotemporal indicators, followed by reflections on the pandemic’s impacts on human society
and the post-pandemic world in Section 5.

2. The spatiotemporal matrix and spreading dynamics
2.1. A spatiotemporal matrix

4 of 27

COVID-19 has impacts on every aspect of human society and has produced many phenomena
that can be detected by different sensors, resulting in what has been termed big spatiotemporal data
[15], including case numbers reported in near real time by government agencies, news agencies, and
non-governmental organizations; government orders and administrative measures captured by
official documents and news reports; human activities changed and reflected by social media and
transportation activities; economic activities tumbling as reflected by stock markets around the globe;
and the Earth-observation data reflecting a changed Earth. These datasets are big by themselves, with
the five Vs intrinsically integrated (volume, variety, velocity, veracity, and value)[16]. Through an
Amazon cloud credit grant, we employed the Amazon cloud to tackle these big spatiotemporal data
challenges. The process can be represented by a spatiotemporal matrix (Figure 1):

The core is the data collected about the virus, its spreading, the responses, and their impacts as
variables.
Space, in the form of place names, refers to the two or three-dimensional spatial world.
The temporal dimension represents the fast-changing situation at the granularity of minutes,
such as the changing values of the reported cases.
The variable refers to different types of data value captured and shared (https://covid19.stcenter.net/index.php/data-access/) including (confirmed, tested, death, recovered) case
numbers, government measures, human movement, socioeconomic dynamics, air quality,
logistics supply chain, available hospital beds, and many other factors.
The core matrix supports the outer matrix belt of a variety of spatiotemporal analytics in various
research fields, domains, sectors, and the society at large in the era after COVID-19.

identified when coupling COVID-19 data with relevant research as denoted in Figure 1.
2.2. The evolution of confirmed cases & worldwide spreading

5 of 27

Since the outbreak of COVID-19 in China at the end of 2019 (Figure 2a), the disease spread
quickly from China to other countries and territories since late January (Figure 2b) and had affected
populations on every continent as of April 28, 2020. The epicenter of the outbreak shifted from China,
Central, and East Asia to Europe and North America in the past three months (Figure 2c). Confirmed
cases per 100,000 increased significantly in countries such as Japan and South Korean in addition to
China in early February. In mid-February, the epicenter shifted to the Middle East and Europe and
confirmed cases in countries such as Iran, Spain, and Italy continued to climb. The worldwide
pandemic was accelerating. Since early March, confirmed cases per 100,000 increased sharply in the
United States, making it a new epicenter of the crisis (Figure 2c). As of April 28, 2020, confirmed cases
in five countries are more than 500 per 100,000 which includes the San Marino, Holy See, Andorra,
Luxembourg and Iceland and 7 countries with over 100k confirmed cases (Figure 2d).

Figure 2. Number of confirmed cases per 100,000 across the world with animation available. (data collected
from global resources, processed, and visualized by the NSF Spatiotemporal Innovation Center).

Figure 3 shows temporal snapshots of hotspots of confirmed cases in the U.S. from January to
April and demonstrates the transmission of COVID-19 in the US and the shift of its epicenter. The
first U.S. confirmed case was reported in Snohomish County, Washington on January 19, 2020 (Figure
3a). Since then many cases have been confirmed in different states, with New York became the
world epicenter by mid-March (Figure 3c). In summary, the disease started to emerge on the east
and west coast and was then transmitted to other states in the transportation hub regions of the
country. In February and early March, epicenters were concentrated in cities such as Seattle, Los
Angeles, and Boston (Figure 3b, 3c). Since mid-March, the outbreak of COVID-19 has spread into
other cities such as New York and San Jose, and by March 17 the coronavirus was present in all states
(Figure 2c). Hot spots can be found in most states in late April. As of 04/27/2020, over one million
confirmed cases were reported in the U.S. (Figure 2d).

global resources, processed, and visualized by the NSF Spatiotemporal Innovation Center).

3. The spatiotemporal responses
3.1. The responding policies and administrative measures
The lockdown of Wuhan and China dropped the R0 from 2.x to 1.0 in February [3] and the
lockdown, which may be viewed as an effective policy, eventually helped contain the outbreak in
China. Border controls and lockdowns were adopted by many countries to control the spread of
COVID-19. These measures need to consider that people might be asymptomatic but are already
contagious during the early stages of an infection. It was also suggested to trace contacts outside of
the epicenter to limit human-to-human transmission [17]. After an initial spread and subsequent
containment which resulted in success in containing the virus, it is important to develop testing
capabilities to detect possible resurgence of the virus. The final goal would be to develop a vaccine,
which is the ultimate means to eradicate the disease. Before that, stringent stay-at-home lockdown
measures have become normal in many countries to limit the spread. The strictness of relevant
administrative orders measured using the stringency index becomes a criterion of the effectiveness
of disease control [14].

7 of 27

Figure 4. The world stringency index from January to April is increasing and correlates well with the
disease spreading with a continuous daily animation. (data collected from global resources, processed,
and visualized by the NSF Spatiotemporal Innovation Center).

The Government Response Stringency Index was first introduced by the Oxford COVID-19
Government Response Tracker [14]. It codes qualitative policies into numbers and then takes the
average of these specific policies such as school closure, business closure, public event cancellation,
as well as a generalization code to indicate the scope of the specific policy. Therefore, the index can
present a good understanding of governments’ responsiveness towards the current crisis. Figures 4
and 5 illustrate this index for countries around the world and the U.S. As shown in Figure 4a, the first
country with a policy response was Mongolia by releasing daily news to inform the public about
COVID-19. On January 22, China locked down Wuhan (Figure 4b) and issued policies included the
prohibition of large gatherings and extending the Spring Festival holiday for both schools and
organizations on January 26 (Figure 4c). On January 30, WHO declared a global health emergency,
and by February 25, COVID-19 was detected in more than 11 Asian countries (Figure 4d). After that,
more countries took action in response to WHO declaring COVID-19 “a pandemic” on March 11. As
COVID-19 started to spread across the globe and declined in China by March 17, many countries took
more serious measures while China relaxed its restrictions (Figure 4e). Italy and Spain announced a
lockdown, Canada closed its border and the U.S. President Trump declared a national emergency.
By April 7, most countries around the world had a stringency index of higher than 50, meaning they
had issued harsh restrictions such as closing schools and business (Figure 4f). The effectiveness of the
lockdown in China helped it reopen the economy and lifted its last city lockdown for Wuhan on April
7 after already reopened other cities in March.

Figure 5. The U.S. states’ stringency index increased from early March to late April and correlates well with
the disease spreading; a continuous daily animation is available. (data collected from global resources,
processed, and visualized by the NSF Spatiotemporal Innovation Center).

The U.S. took initial action on January 31, by implementing travel restrictions from China. A
further travel advisory was issued at the end of February for Italy and eventually for all of Europe.
In terms of local measures, on March 5 Maryland responded to the pandemic by declaring a state
emergency (Figure 5a), releasing an information campaign about COVID-19, and closing all K-12
schools. On March 15, 17 states issued orders in response to the pandemic, with western and
northeastern states having the highest stringency index, since they were the states with the most cases
at that time (Figure 5b). By March 21 (Figure 5c), more states issued COVID-19 related orders and the
stringency index rose with positive cases in each state. As the pandemic continued to spread across
the country and death tolls continued to rise, by March 27 there were 9 statewide and 10 regional
“Stay at Home” orders. At that point, U.S. coronavirus cases hit 100,000 (Figure 5d). In order to stop
the pandemic by reducing personal contact, 42 states had issued a statewide “Stay at Home” order
and 3 states had issued a regional one by April 7, which closed nonessential businesses and
prohibited large public gatherings (Figure 5e). Four days later, by April 11 (Figurer 5f), every state
was under a disaster declaration simultaneously for the first time in the US history as the US death
toll overtook Italy’s and reached 20,000. After several weeks of shutting down, Florida was the first
state to ease its restrictions and opened its beaches. Following that, more states planned to reopen
their businesses in May or June.
3.2. The impacts

9 of 27

One of the policies adopted by most government authorities to combat the spread of Covid-19
is the stay-at-home policy. Keeping the population home-bounded introduces many negative
impacts, particularly along the economic front. However, keeping people at home reduces the use of
automobiles, thus tremendously lowering emissions and leading to some important environmental
consequences.
3.2.1. Human movement patterns in the shadow of COVID-19
Human movement is an important driver of the dispersion of infectious diseases [18]. The
magnitude and scale of human movement are critical for the prediction of virus transmission, the
identification of risk area, and decisions about control measure [19]. Different data sources, such as
public transportation (bus, train, and flight), social-media data, and mobile-phone data, can be used
to detect such movement.

Figure 6. Global average travel distance during the weekend from 02/01/2020 to 04/26/2020, as derived
from geotagged tweets. An animation is available. (data collected from Twitter, processed, and visualized
by Z.L.)

Geotagged Twitter data have been used in human mobility studies [20-22]. Figure 6 shows the
global population flows and average travel distance derived from geotagged tweets during the
weekend (Saturday --> Sunday) from February 1, 2020, to April 26, 2020. It is clear from the map
animation and Figure 6 that the intensity of population movements declined dramatically from
February 1st (35.91 miles, Figure 6 left) to April 26th (16.99 miles, Figure 6 right), a 53 percent drop,
though it started to level off after March 29th.

10 of 27

As the COVID-19 broke out in the U.S. in mid-March, the intensity of population movement
declined dramatically from March 12 to March 24 (Figure 7). Specifically, after U.S. states issued stayat-home orders, with California taking the lead on March 19, population flows became sparse,
especially in places in the west and south coasts, such as near San Francisco, San Diego, and Miami.
Also, in Texas, there is an obvious network triangle between Dallas, Houston, and Austin before
March 18, and it became much weaker on March 24. However, for places near New York City, we
can still see strong population movements after lockdown started on March 22. These movement
changes reveal the impact of COVID-19 on people’s travel. A more comprehensive analysis and
modeling at finer spatiotemporal resolutions are needed to better understand how the movement
patterns are associated with the spread of the virus and with the implementation of policies.

Figure 7. Population movements derived from geotagged tweets before and after the lockdown in
the contiguous US. Brightness indicates movement intensity (more population flow in and out). Data
were collected with the Twitter API. (data collected from Twitter, processed, and visualized by Z.L.)

Figure 8 shows the overall flight frequency decreasing in China, and less travel in February with
many flights canceled. For example, the flight frequency on February 18 is about 31.1% lower than
that of January 1. The outbreak has a significant impact on air travel, which reflects efforts in
containing the virus spread. The inclusion in the analyses the number of passengers on each flight
will likely reveal much less travel, as news reported that many flights were almost empty after the
lockdown policy put in place.
The mobility of global communities also changed significantly as the result of a series of
measures

from

Google

(https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/) provide insights into changes in the movement trends
over time in different countries across different categories of places such as groceries and pharmacy,
parks, transit stations, retail and recreation, workplace and residential. Figure 9 shows that the visit
to public places such as parks and groceries decreased significantly as the outbreak of COVID-19
swept across the world and social distancing policies were implemented in some countries. Activities
at home increased significantly as a result of stay-at-home or work-from-home policies. The

11 of 27

spatiotemporal patterns correlate well with the spatiotemporal dynamics of the outbreak and
relevant policies.

the NSF Spatiotemporal Innovation Center).

google, processed, and visualized by the NSF Spatiotemporal Innovation Center)

3.2.2. A quieter and cleaner Earth
Due to the lockdown of many locations, and thus tremendously cut back automobile usage and
shut down factory operations, the amounts of various types of pollutants released to the environment
were significantly reduced. As a result, air quality has significantly improved since the COVID-19
outbreak [23]. The concentration of nitrogen dioxide and air quality index (AQI) are analyzed using

12 of 27

ground-based observations. Figure 10 shows the hotspot maps based on kernel density estimation of
nitrogen dioxide concentration which is the primary pollutant emitted by motor vehicles, power
plants, and industrial facilities, and the mapping bandwidth is 80 kilometers. It diminished in density
over China when most cities shut down during February compared to January and late March of
2020.

animation (ground-based data collected from China National Environmental Monitoring Center,

Figure 11. AQI before and during the pandemic in China with daily animation (ground-based data
collected from China National Environmental Monitoring Center, CNEMC, analyzed and visualized
by NSF spatiotemporal innovation center).

13 of 27

Similar phenomena are also observed with an air quality index (AQI) (Figure 11), which records
the intensity of air pollution in China by considering five main air pollutants: PM2.5, PM10, Ozone,
Nitrogen Dioxide, Sulfur Dioxide and Carbon Monoxide [24]. According to the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA, https://www3.epa.gov/ttn/oarpg/t1/memoranda/rg701.pdf), AQI is the
highest index of all the six types of pollutants using the following equation:

𝐼𝐼𝑖𝑖 = �

AQI = Max (𝐼𝐼𝑖𝑖 ), {i = 1,2,3,4,5,6}

𝐼𝐼𝑖𝑖,ℎ𝑖𝑖 − 𝐼𝐼𝑖𝑖,𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙
� �𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖,𝑃𝑃 − 𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝑖𝑖,𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 � + 𝐼𝐼𝑖𝑖,𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙
𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝑖𝑖,ℎ𝑖𝑖 − 𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝑖𝑖,𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙

where 𝐼𝐼𝑖𝑖 is the index of one type of pollutant ; 𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖,𝑃𝑃 is the rounded concentration of pollutant i;
𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝑖𝑖,ℎ𝑖𝑖 is the breakpoint greater or equal to 𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖,𝑃𝑃 ; 𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝑖𝑖,𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 is the breakpoint less than or equal to

𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖,𝑃𝑃 ; 𝐼𝐼𝑖𝑖,ℎ𝑖𝑖 is the AQI corresponding to 𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝑖𝑖,ℎ𝑖𝑖 ; 𝐼𝐼𝑖𝑖,𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 is the AQI corresponding to 𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝑖𝑖,𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 .

The AQI values decreased during February of 2020. The reduction of air pollution was first

shown near Wuhan and then extended to most parts of China. These changes were due to the
quarantine and shutdown policies which limited the usage of motor vehicles and industrial

productions.
Figure 12 shows the Night-Time Light (NTL) changes of Hubei Province before (a) and during
(b) the lockdown. Commercial and business centers are shown to be dimmer in February than in
January because of the spreading of the virus and the social distancing policies. People stopped
working, getting together or congregating outside, and instead stayed at home. Light pollution is
reduced during the COVID-19 crisis. Light pollution from some of the highways between cities is less
intense during the pandemic due to the shutdown of cities and cut off of transportation.

collected from NASA's LAADS DAACs, processed, and visualized by the NSF Spatiotemporal Innovation
Center).

3.2.3. The economic impacts
The global economy and stock market have also been significantly impacted. Stock markets
worldwide performed according to the timeline of the virus outbreak in each region (Figure 13). Nine
representative stock indices were selected to cover Asia’s, Europe’s, and America’s major stock
markets (Figure 13). 25 stocks were chosen to represent the global stocks traded in New York Stock
Exchange. From January to April, the global market responded dynamically with the global

14 of 27

transmission of the COVID-19. When the first cases were reported in China and Wuhan was locked
down, the Chinese Mainland SHA, SS, and HSI indices dropped significantly with SS plunged and
SHA fluctuated during the entire observed period. The global market showed a slight decrease before
mid-February. The Chinese stocks (such as Alibaba and China Netease in Figure 14) traded in NYSE
showed similar performance like HSI. After China announced that the outbreak was under control
in February, the SS and HIS showed an upwards trajectory. The global market dropped in late
February and early March with the European indices (FCHI, GDAXI, and FISE) leading the trend
when Europe became the epicenter. All indices hit the bottom and started gaining in late-March after
a global announcement of stimulus packages for COVID-19, following the U.S.

American markets (DJI, IXIC) stopped rising in mid-February and plunged until mid-March.
All representative stocks for different industry sectors, such as high-tech, aviation, medical, and food,
showed a slight drop when the first case was reported in the U.S., and plunged in March. While most
stocks did not respond much to the late January and February lockdown of China, Chinese stocks
(such as Alibaba and Ctrip) plunged for the first time in 2020. April saw a gradual increase of the
market with some sectors (e.g., Activision Blizzard, Amazon, and Medical for health and logistics)
quickly recovered, while some (e.g., Airbus and Ctrip for travels) were still at the bottom, based on
each industry’s market resilience (Figure 14).
The global market performance demonstrated a tightly coupled world village but also regional
differences and the sensitivity of the market to regional and global events. This correlates well with
the GDP announced later. For example, the Chinese GDP dropped 30% in February 2020 and Hubei
GDP in February 2020 dropped 98%. The 2020 1st Quarter GDP dropped 4.8% in the US.
3.2.4. Social implications
The coronavirus does not discriminate; however, disadvantaged and vulnerable social groups
are bearing a larger brunt of the infection and death toll [25]. China CDC reported that 89.8% of the
confirmed cases in Wuhan were between the ages of 30-79, while 88.6% of those in Hubei and 86.6%
of those in China before February 11, 2020 [26]. For mortality, most of the cases in Italy are in the age
group of 60+, and more than 50% of mortality cases in China are in the age group of 50+. Thus, older
people have a higher risk of being infected and succumbing. In addition, different races have different
risk levels and factors [27]. By April 23, 2020, African Americans’ COVID-19 mortality rate was 2.7
times higher than that of Whites, 2.5 times higher than that of Asians, and 2.4 times higher than that
of Latinos. (https://www.apmresearchlab.org/covid/deaths-by-race). At the state level in the U.S., the
death rate (based on weighted population distribution) shows different spatiotemporal patterns by
race and Hispanic origin (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/). The ratio shows in
pie chart (Figure 15) is the standardized death number by race population per capita, and the labelled
number in center of circle shows the total accumulated death cases in each state by April 28, 2020.
African Americans take the highest risk in Eastern and Southern United States and Rustbelt states,
like Louisiana, Georgia, Indiana, Michigan, Missouri, Alabama and Mississippi, while American
Indians have a relatively higher risk in Arizona (Figure 15). Hispanic or Latino take the highest risk
in Northeast and Southern part of the county, such as New York, New Jersey, Florida and Texas. In
western states, the race and Hispanic origin shows an average pattern, like California, Colorado,
Nevada and Washington.

Figure 15. Some states with more than 100 deaths as of 4/28/2020 have strong differences by race (data
provided by National Center for Health Statistics, NCHS, processed and visualized by the NSF
Spatiotemporal Innovation Center).

The socioeconomic patterns are analyzed at a finer scale using weekly confirmed cases in
Massachusetts by city/town (https://www.mass.gov/info-details/covid-19-response-reporting#covid19-cases-by-city/town-) on April 29, 2020 including 350 cities/towns and 42 of them have uncertain
numbers. Four variables, including poverty rate, educational attainment, elderly people rate, and
income, are used to analyze the socioeconomic impact. Poverty rate is measured by the percentage
of population whose income is below the poverty level; educational attainment is measured by the
percentage of population over the age of 25 with Bachelor’s degree; elderly people rate is measured
by the percentage of population over the age of 60; and income is measured by household total annual
income per 10, 000 dollars. 2017 socioeconomic data are obtained from the U.S. Bureau of the Census’
American Community Survey (ACS) at county subdivision level. We employed Spatial Lag (SL)
model [28] to assess the relationship between confirmed cases rates and each of the explanatory
variables with the following regression equation
𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖 = 𝛽𝛽0 + 𝛽𝛽1 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽2 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽3 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽4 𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝑖𝑖 + 𝜌𝜌𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖 ∙ 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖 + 𝜖𝜖𝑖𝑖

where 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖 is the COVID-19 confirmed cases rate for city/town i, POV is the poverty rate, EDU is
educational attainment, ELD is the elderly rate, 𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖 ∙ 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖 is the spatial lag, which is calculated by
weighted average of dependent variable y for city/town i, 𝜖𝜖 is the random error term, and 𝛽𝛽 and 𝜌𝜌
are the coefficients to be estimated.

Table 1 presents statistical results from SL model. The R-squared is 0.577802 and the p values

are much smaller than or around 5%, at an acceptable level. The coefficient values for elderly rate and
educational attainment are -12.6535 and -9.96245, indicating these two variables have significant and

17 of 27

negative impact on the confirmed cases rate, i.e., well-educated and elderly population have less
confirmed cases. Not surprisingly, the coefficient for poverty rate is 17.0477, representing it has a
significant and positive relationship with confirmed cases rate. However, household total income has
weak correlation with confirmed cases rate. In addition, spatial lag term is significant in the model,
suggesting that the confirmed cases rate is dependent not only on the explanatory variables within
the city/town but also on the values in adjacent city/town. Based on this preliminary study, more
spatiotemporal correlation models can be involved and compared to accommodate spatiotemporal
variations, such as GWR (Geographically Weighted Regression) [29] and GTWR (Geographical and
Temporal Weighted Regression) [30].

3.3. The forecasting and strategy battleground
With the spatiotemporal patterns detected and analyzed for COVID-19 cases and relevant
policies and consequences, it is a grand challenge to forecast the future trajectories of the outbreak,
simulate potential policy scenarios, and predict the consequences of reopening the economy.
Fortunately, several technologies have been developed in the past decades to simulate person-toperson disease transmission, outbreaks, and relevant socioeconomic impacts by considering the
transmissibility among objects with multiple factors.
Agent-based models (ABMs) are used for complex systems simulation considering individual
objects as agents [31]. Individual autonomous agents, the basic elements to form the ABMs, make
decisions under pre-configured rulesets during a simulation process to control individual behaviors,
communication among agents, and interaction between the agents and the environment [32]. Thus,
dynamic patterns could be represented by observing the ABMs as whole systems. ABMs could be
applied as standalone simulators or be integrated with models in related disciplines to help
strengthen existing studies [33]. For example, in the field of infectious disease epidemiology, ABM
played an important role in monitoring and analyzing infectious processes [34], evaluating response
policies [35], and supporting the development of containment strategies [36]. During the pandemic
of COVID-19, Stevens utilized an ABM-based simulator to evaluate if containment strategies could
help to “flatten the curve” [37] with four control-policy scenarios, and found that policies like
extensive distancing and stay-at-home orders could help significantly flatten the infection curve.
We slightly modified the epiDEM model [38], a basic ABM-SIR model powered by NetLogo [39],
to represent a similar simulation (Figure 17). This model includes three variables: S, I, and R,
representing the number of susceptible people, infected people, and recovered people, respectively
at specific timesteps.

18 of 27

Figure 17. Initial ABM-SIR model simulation; an animation is available.

In addition to considering epidemiological models and policy factors, there are many other types
of pandemic-effective factors, such as public-health factors (including the social and economic
environment, human characteristics and behaviors, social activities, and transportation patterns)[40]
and environmental factors (including temperature, humidity, and air quality)[41,42].
In previous epidemiological studies, ABMs have been used to simulate and predict the
effectiveness of containment strategies under different policies [36], the time and space of outbreaks
[43], medical resource deficiencies (Nap) [44] and impacts on logistics systems [45]. However, studies
applying ABM coupled with multivariate impact factors, such as spatiotemporal distributions of
viruses, human migration and activities, climate conditions and environmental factors, and
containment strategies and policies, to reveal and predict the pandemic pattern of COVID-19 have
not been developed. These factors are critical for setting up the behaviors and attributes of each
individual agent and a variety of complex dynamic environments. Such criteria should consider the
transmissibility (such as R0), the agent contact mode, temperature, humidity, air quality, night light,
and UVs, as shown in Figure 18:
•

The temperature and humidity have a strong correlation with outbreak (Figure 18a).

•

The absolute humidity has a close correlation with R0 (Figure 18c).

•

The night pollution has a strong correlation with economical GDP (Figure 18b).

•

The outbreak spreading has a strong response to policy (Figure 18d)

However, more accurate quantitative studies are needed to mine the relationships for feeding into
the overall ABM.

19 of 27

Figure 18. Potential relationships between the outbreak of COVID-19 and (a) temperature and
humidity, (b) night-time light and the economy, (c) humidity and mean of R0 [42], and (d) control
policies [38]

Statistical methods (e.g., linear regression and feature selection) can discover the relationships
between impact factors (e.g., environmental factors, social-economic factors) and the outbreak of
COVID-19; meanwhile, data mining methods (e.g. clustering and anomaly detection) can be utilized
to mine hidden patterns (e.g., older people are more susceptible to infection; people with blood type
O are less susceptible to infection) from COVID-19 related data. The learned knowledge will serve as
valuable input to the ABM for simulation optimization. Figure 18 shows our initial attempts to
quantitatively measure potential factors, i.e., relative humidity, average temperature, and lockdown
policy, using statistical methods. Take one finding, the relative humidity (RH) was largely in the
range of 45-85% in affected areas, for example, relative humidity can be set into this range in the ABM
for simulation of COVID-19. We are conducting quantitative analytics to extract the relationships
between COVID-19 outbreak and its socioeconomic impacts and a variety of relevant factors as a
fashion appropriate to big spatiotemporal data event extraction fashion (Figure 18)[46], such as
economic conditions, temperature and humidity, air quality and UV index, etc., using machine
learning, clustering and regression, feature selection, anomaly detection, as well as nonlinear
extensions via techniques such as generalized additive models and deep-learning methods.
Currently, we are developing and integrating a comprehensive ABM-based simulator to
replicate the COVID-19 outbreak at different scales, such as the county level, state level, nation, and
even global levels. We plan to calibrate our model and build region-based transition rules with
multiple potential impact factors and existing COVID-19 records, by mining the possible correlation
between them to find out why the COVID-19 outbreak was particularly severe in some places such
as Wuhan, New York City, and northern Italy. An accuracy assessment will be conducted to verify
the simulation confidence by comparing the simulated results with COVID-19 records. We can then

20 of 27

apply our simulation model to describe the multi-scale COVID-19 outbreak patterns with certain
confidence levels as well as to predict the possibility of outbreaks in some places like India and South
Africa, which may help mitigate the pandemic and save lives in those areas not yet hit by an outbreak,
or a resurgence in reopened areas. The model will also be expanded to produce other impact factors
such as economic output (18b).
4. Conclusion: A collective spatiotemporal perspective
The analytics reported in previous sections indicate the spatiotemporal patterns of a variety of
variables:
•
Disease transmission patterns: The disease transmission is fast (Section 2.2) with the epicenter
moving from Wuhan to Iran, Italy/Europe in late February, and New York/U.S. in late March.
The early policy and administrative orders put in place played a big role in containing the
outbreak (Section 3.1). For example, China quickly controlled the spreading and reopened the
economy and Singapore contained the spreading at the beginning. The opening of the economy
also brought some resurgence from place to place. For example, the outbreak in Suifenhe, a small
border city in northeastern China next to Russia, with 80 confirmed cases and 124 asymptomatic
carriers in mid-April, demonstrated the uncertainties and difficulties in containing the disease.
•
Social-economic disparity and vulnerability: While the outbreak reached almost everywhere
human movement occurs, its severity and human vulnerability are quite different among
different communities with different socioeconomic backgrounds, e.g., countries with stricter
rules would find it easier to slow the outbreak while countries with more freedom in principle
find it harder to impose strict lockdown orders (Section 3.2.4). This even triggered a worry that
the virus may undermine freedom and democracy [47]. People with less access to information
and with lower income are more vulnerable because of the lack of information and knowledge,
difficulty in putting orders to actions, lack of means to maintain basic livelihood without going
to work, and lack of preparedness in the community to respond to the outbreak.
•
Mobility and social distancing: Social distancing is important and stay at home orders are key to
controlling the outbreak (Section 3.1). The worldwide collective efforts of limiting travels are
reflected in the maps of intensive population movement and average travel distance (Section
3.2.3). Most early-outbreak states in the U.S. with strict social distancing in place are
subsequently seeing a drop in confirmed cases on a daily basis, while many southeastern states
with a big number of confirmed cases could control the spreading if they applied strict rules of
social distancing and lockdowns. This is also confirmed in the correlation between outbreak and
human mobility in relation to the stringency index (Section 3.1). CDC reported that the selective
border control did not work well because many cases were transmitted to the U.S. from Europe
and other Asian countries while the transmission from China was controlled by stopping over
86% of the flights (https://www.businessinsider.com/cdc-official-says-us-missed-chances-tostop-the-coronavirus-2020-5).
•
The availability of healthcare facilities, such as hospital ICUs and ventilators, is also very
dynamic. The outbreak in New York was predicted early to be needing more facilities, but later
turned out to be sufficient, while many southern states without any obvious need for equipment
early on turned out to be needing more later. This is based on the economic development status
of specific regions, policies in place, and the absolute number of facilities. More quantitative
estimation of the demand for and allocation of health facilities, supply-demand prediction, and
optimization would be very helpful. Especially, more in-depth research is much needed at the
current stage with an interdisciplinary approach in a spatiotemporal framework (Section 3 and
especially Section 3.2.4).
•
Climate has some relationship to the disease outbreak as witnessed by the similar climate zone
of the outbreak cities and regions from Wuhan, Iran, and Italy to Seattle and New York (Section
3.2). This is confirmed through early studies and leads to the belief that the increase of

21 of 27

•

•

•

temperature and humidity would help slow down the transmission [48] while other scholars
argue that this may not be true (Section 3.3)[49].
Economic issues, such as shifting consumer needs, interruption of supply chain,
(un)employment patterns, etc., are greatly impacted by the outbreak as evidenced by the sharp
stock market drop (Section 3.2.2), the national unemployment rate increase, and the almost
stopped GDP in Hubei Province (with Wuhan as its capital), China for February.
Relationships between policy, news or social sentiment changes, and outbreak severity are key
to the longer-term control and constraining of the virus, and for human societies to manage to
live with the virus, as many studies show that the virus will not be gone until a vaccine is
developed to control the spreading [50]. These relationships are also critical for predicting the
next wave of the outbreak and its epicenters as well as estimating risks for reopening the
economy.
Balancing the open data and privacy protection policies: Obtaining data is still quite challenging
both nationally and internationally even NSF and the White House has issued open data policy
with requirements for data management plan from funded projects [51]. More so for the
pandemic research that engages a variety of geospatial location data from twitter location,
location-based service and even medical records. These datasets involve strong privacy elements
and should be protected while being used for research to fight against COVID-19 [52]. A
platform, such as Geospatial Virtual Data Enclave (GVDE) [53], that can enable the sharing but
at the same time protect the privacy is critical to safely archive, access, share, analyze, and use
confidential geospatial data in COVID-19 research and other public health programs [53,54].

5. Discussion: Reflections regarding the impact on human society
The outbreak of COVID-19 reveals that humankind is not ready for a global pandemic and didn’t
learn enough from the outbreaks of SARS and MERS in past decades [13]. This pandemic drives us
to prepare from many aspects, from psychological maturity for universal precautions, government
bodies, employment and education, as well as nutrition, to improving our facilities and health-care
infrastructure to become ready for the next emergency crises [55]. Even more challenging after the
COVID -19 outbreak will be the reshaping of various aspects of human society.
5.1. The responding policies and administrative measures
The COVID-19 triggered responses from many different domains and called for collaboration
among all sectors to participate in research, engineering, production, delivery, and care, for rapid
response to save lives and prepare communities. This outbreak also calls for a systematic study of the
spatiotemporal topics in a controlled environment at a grand scale, such as pollution control, urban
functions, global supply chains, and regional service location-allocation [55]. Such a cross-sector and
all disciplinary mobilization calls for the whole human kind to fight against one enemy-the covid-19
disease, and is costing the world economy more than most regional wars or other natural disasters
of the past century [56]. A collaboration based on global debates among different regions is needed
and will be needed even more so after the fight against COVID-19. A cohesive and flexible framework
with both spatial and temporal perspective in integrative fashion [57] will be a principal key to bridge
interdisciplinary

collaboration,

cross-sector

integration,

and

cross-region

dialogues

[58].

Spatiotemporal readiness for the next emergency is critical as evidenced by the promising signs and
exposed weakness of the current status, such as many grassroot efforts, or the lack of standards and
coordination.
5.2. Life on Earth

22 of 27

Few events could have an impact on lives from around the globe at this scale. The pandemic is
changing human lives and affecting many other species and ecosystems. Time will be needed to reach
another equilibrium or relatively stable states in politics, culture, economics, and ecology. The
lockdowns, closure of campuses, and stay-at-home orders while fighting against the pandemic also
pose great and long-term challenges to education and impact the mental health of students and
academic faculty and staff [59]. The consumption and working habits of many citizens have changed
due to the stay-at-home policies. More and more people have become used to and are willing to
purchase on-line and work from home. These phenomena will periodically or even permanently
influence the economic structure and usage of public resources.
5.3. The resilience of a natural and artificial world
The origin of the virus and whether it was leaked from a lab is a heated debate among many
countries [60] and it brought a broader concern about how the artificial world should be in alliance
with the natural world [61], so that scientists behind advanced research are equipped with
humanitarian thinking and priority in mind when conducting any type of research [62]. The evolution
of human knowledge and the advancement of technologies will put a lot of tools in the hands of
decision makers, such as driverless cars, robotic personal service, and automatic battle machines. A
debate is more pertinent on how to use such power to protect humankind. There are many ethical
questions that remain unanswered as human beings seek answers to scientific questions, exploring
and altering the micro and macro environments, and expanding our footprint not only on Earth but
also in outer space.
5.4. Politics, humanity, and rapid response to global emergency
It is a delicate balance in governance between saving lives and maintaining livelihood under the
threat of this pandemic. The various response measures imposed by different countries have also
generated heated debate on the effectiveness of governance models and organizational structures.
Humanitarian activities in response to emergencies sometimes clash with the need for protecting
sensitive information, privacy protection, and information classification. The existing political
framework and communication channels may have to be reshaped if this global pandemic will be
prolonged. Some argue that protecting human lives is more important than protecting human rights.
Others urge for relaxing privacy protection in order to enable research, especially when there is an
urgent need for fighting a global crisis and where individuals’ locations are part of the critical data.
Spatiotemporal and geospatial technology may provide a balanced solution for enabling effective use
of location-based data while protecting citizen’s privacy. For example, while using mobile phone data
to track human movement sparks privacy concerns [63], developing novel spatiotemporal computing
and aggregation algorithms could enable us to efficiently extract needed population flows from less
sensitive but noisier social-media data.
5.5. An open world and global village
The global village notion captured the rapid spreading and movement of the epicenter from
Wuhan to Iran, Italy, Europe, New York, and now with significant outbreaks in Africa. The disease
quickly spread across Africa and the time is limited for global leaders to control the transmission in
Africa and back to other continents. The global framework of human societies is being tested and will
very possibly be evaluated after the COVID-19 pandemic [8]. Haass [64] argued that the global

23 of 27

pandemic may push world collaboration and contest back to the level of World War I or II, with
greater disparities, though the advancement of human technologies and collaboration agreements
have gone far beyond that of a century ago. While more discussions were towards a more transparent
governance process, a more decisive mechanism for global emergency response may be formed, the
deliberation and the process for moving ahead along those directions will probably be a compromise
among different countries, cultures, and organizations. For sure it will take a long term to settle on a
more effective mechanism for combating global disasters causing health crises such as COVID-19,
natural disasters such as super typhoons or hurricanes [20], earthquakes [65], and tsunamis [66], as
well as outer-space threats to our home planet [67]. Whatever the eventual outcome of this pandemic,
it is clear that the world will be changed, and many relationships will be reshaped.
