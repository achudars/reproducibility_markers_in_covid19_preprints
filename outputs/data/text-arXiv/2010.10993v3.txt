Abstract
Covid-19 has had a disastrous economic impact on countries and industries as countries
have gone through the lockdown process to reduce the health impact of Covid-19. As
countries have started lifting Covid-19 related restrictions, businesses have been allowed
to again have on-site customers. However, just a limited number of people are being
allowed on-site as long as social distancing measures are being followed. This has
resulted in heavy burdens on businesses as their number of customers have decreased
substantially. In this study, we propose a model to minimize the economic impact of
Covid-19 for businesses that have implemented social distancing measures, as well as
to minimize the health impact of Covid-19 for their customers and employees. We
introduce the quantity Spread in which minimizing Spread gives the optimum number and
arrangement of people at a given site while applying social distancing measures. We
apply our model to a real-world scenario and optimize the number of passengers and
their arrangements under a social distancing measure for two different popular aircraft
seat layouts using the Annealing Monte Carlo technique. We obtain the optimal numbers
and optimal arrangements of passengers considering both family groups and individual
passengers for the social distancing measure. The obtained optimal arrangements of
passengers show complex patterns with groups and individual passengers mixed in
complex and non-trivial ways. This demonstrates the necessity of using our model or its
variants to find these optimal arrangements. In addition, we show that any other
arrangements of passengers with the same number of passengers is a suboptimal
arrangement with higher health risks as a result of less distance between passengers.
Our model could be implemented for other social situations such as sports events,
theaters, medical centers, etc.

Introduction
Simultaneously minimizing the health and economic impacts of Covid-19 is the biggest
challenge for countries and industries as the lockdown has become the first line of
defense against Covid-19 and many countries have gone through the lockdown phase
[1-4]. As the economic damages of Covid-19 have become unbearable as a result of
lockdown, countries have begun the reopening phases and have allowed their businesses
to reopen to avoid the catastrophic economic effects of Covid-19 [5,6]. In the reopening
phases many businesses and countries have implemented restrictive measures including
social distancing measures as it has been strongly argued to be the most effective nonpharmacological way to reduce the health impact of Covid-19 [7-10]. Complementary
methods such as washing hands and using masks have been also recommended strongly
or enforced by businesses and governments [11,12]. Also, many studies have been done
to either introduce strategies to optimize the current restrictive methods or to investigate
the health and economic impacts of current restrictions on people [13-28]. Additionally,
many new products such as physical barriers, covers and protocols have been introduced
to the market to help different businesses implement social distancing measures more
rigorously and reduce the health risk of Covid-19 for their on-site employees and
customers. However, the main way of applying the social distancing measures has been
through leaving empty spaces between people using signages on floors and seats. These
signages have been installed in simple ways such as leaving empty rows or columns of
seats between people to create social distancing (usually 6 feet). To the best of our
knowledge, it seems that none of the businesses and industries have used modeling and
optimization methods to maximize the number of people on-site and their distances,
under a social distancing constraint, to decrease the health and economic impacts of
Covid-19. Our modeling and optimization methods could be applied to a variety of
settings, such as classrooms, restaurants, theaters, medical centers and etc.
In this paper we report the results of optimizing the number of passengers and their
arrangements under a social distancing measure for the airline industry by introducing a
model. In our model we introduce the quantity Spread and by applying simulated
Annealing Monte Carlo we minimize Spread to obtain the optimum number and
arrangement of passengers for two types of single and twin aisle aircraft layouts under a
social distancing measure. We show that our obtained optimal arrangements have higher
distance between passengers as compared to any suboptimal arrangements with the
same number of passengers. Our results suggest that it is necessary to use modeling
methods to minimize the health and economic impacts of Covid-19 under social
distancing measures.

Results
Model
We introduce our model based on the observed facts about spreading the SARS-CoV-2
virus as well as the social distancing measures that have been suggested by health
experts and enforced or recommended by businesses and governments. Social
distancing is the physical distance between two people and has been recommended to
2

be 6 feet. In this model, family groups, or people who live together, do not need to follow
the social distancing measure. However, individuals and groups that do not live together
do need to follow the social distancing measure. Based on these facts, we introduce the
below model with a quantity that we name Spread, and we minimize Spread to obtain the
optimum number of passengers and their arrangements. We assume that we have a twodimensional problem with all people being assigned a position in an xy plane. Based on
these facts we define the Spread for person i (𝑠𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑑𝑖 ) as follows:
∑𝑖≠𝑗(𝑟𝑖𝑗 − 1)

2

𝑖𝑓 𝑟𝑖𝑗 ≤ 1, 𝑖 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑗 𝑎𝑟𝑒 𝑖𝑛 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑠𝑎𝑚𝑒 𝑔𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑝

∑𝑖≠𝑗 2(𝑠𝑑 − 1)2
𝑖𝑓 𝑟𝑖𝑗 < 𝑠𝑑, 𝑖 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑗 𝑎𝑟𝑒 𝑛𝑜𝑡 𝑖𝑛 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑠𝑎𝑚𝑒 𝑔𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑝

𝑠𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑑𝑖 =

𝛿
𝑟𝑖𝑗 2

(1)

𝑖𝑓 𝑟𝑖𝑗 ≥ 𝑠𝑑, 𝑖 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑗 𝑎𝑟𝑒 𝑛𝑜𝑡 𝑖𝑛 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑠𝑎𝑚𝑒 𝑔𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑝

where 𝑟𝑖𝑗 and 𝑦𝑖 − 𝑦𝑗 are, respectively, the distance and the distance in the y direction
between individuals i and j, sd is the minimum social distancing that should be followed
by individuals, 𝛿 = 1 and its unit is [𝑟𝑖𝑗 4 ] .
Eq. 1 has four terms. The first and second terms keep the family members close to each
other. Term (𝑦𝑖 − 𝑦𝑗 )2 in the second equation dictates that the members of a family group
sit close to each other on the same row and term (𝑟 − 2)2 dictates that the members of
the same family group stay as close as possible to each other. We should note that other
terms such as (𝑟 − 𝑛)2 , where n = 3, 4, …, might be added to the second term if it is
desirable to keep big family groups close to each other. The third equation in our model
is the penalty for not following the social distancing measure for people that do not belong
to the same family group. The fourth equation keeps people who are not in the same
family group as far as possible from each other and it acts as a repulsion force. We define
the total Spread as sum of the individual Spreads as follows:
𝑆𝑡𝑜𝑡 = ∑𝑖 𝑠𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑑𝑖

(2)

Where sum is over all on-site people and our goal is to minimize 𝑆𝑡𝑜𝑡 to obtain the
maximum distance between non-group individuals who follow the social distancing
measure. Since the number of passengers under the social distancing is less than the
𝑛
number of seats, the number of possible arrangements of passengers is ( ), where 𝑛
𝑚
and 𝑚 are the number of seats and the number of passengers, respectively. The number
of possible arrangements can grow exponentially; for instance, for a half-filled aircraft
with 96 seats, the number of possible arrangements is ~ 296 ~ 8 × 1028 . Hence, we use
the simulated Annealing Monte Carlo [29, 30] approaches to minimize 𝑆𝑡𝑜𝑡 and obtain
the optimal arrangements and number of passengers.

Seat Layouts and Parameters
In this work we consider two popular seat layouts in aircrafts, namely, single (Fig. 1a) and
twin (Fig. 1b) aisles cabin layouts for the economy class. The same model could be
applied to the business class. The single aisle layout has 16 rows, with 6 seats in each
row, separated evenly by an aisle, making a total of 96 seats (Fig 1a). The twin aisle
layout has 17 rows, with 7 seats in each row, 2 seats on either side and 3 seats in the
center, making a total of 119 seats (Fig. 1b). These single and twin aisle layouts
correspond to popular seat layouts in Boeing 737-800 and Boeing 767, respectively.
There are, however, variations of these layouts. In both of these layouts, we consider that
the distance between two adjacent seats is one unit, the distance between a seat and its
front and back seat is 1.8 units, and the width of the aisle is one unit as well (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1. The arrangement of seats and the unit distance we used in our models for single aisle (a)
and twin aisle (b) seat layouts. We assume that the distance between adjacent seats in one row
is one unit and the distance of a front and back seat in the same column is 1.8 units.

We use Spread, the quantity that we introduced in the Model section and minimize Spread
to obtain the arrangement that maximizes the distance between passengers. As we
explained in the Model section, we use the simulated Annealing Monte Carlo (AMC) to
find the minimum Spread. In the Method section we discuss in detail the Algorithm that
we use to minimize Spread.

Passengers Arrangements for Single Aisle Layout
We begin with cases in which the passengers are a combination of individual passengers
and family groups with different number of members and the social distancing guideline
of 2.25 units, where unit is defined in the Seat Layouts and Parameters section.
Throughout the rest of the paper and in the figures, we show the individual passengers
with white masks and family groups with the same color masks. We consider three
different cases of passengers as follows: (a) one four-member, two three-member, and
four two-member family groups (b) three four-member, one three-member, and five two4

member family groups and, (c) four three-member and five two-member family groups in
a single layout aircraft. For each of these cases, we maximized the number of individual
passengers that can be fitted to the seats under the social distancing measure (2.25
units). In Fig. 2, we show the optimal arrangements of passengers for the mentioned three
cases under the social distancing measure.

Fig. 2. The optimal arrangements of passengers for (a) one four-member, two three-member, four
two-member family groups and eighteen individual passengers (b) three four-member, one threemember, five two-member family groups and thirteen individual passengers (c) four three-member
and five two-member family groups and fourteen individual passengers. The arrangements of
family groups and individual passengers are determined by the model such that it maximizes the
distance between non family group members. Therefore, the location of family groups changes
based on the number of family groups and individual passengers.

Our results show that the maximum number of individual passengers that can be fitted to
the seats for cases (a), (b) and (c) are eighteen, thirteen, and fourteen, respectively. We
observe that, in all these arrangements, family group members are correctly located close
to each other and in the same row, when possible, and individual passengers and groups
members who do not belong to the same family group follow the social distancing
measure. Moreover, when possible, our model keeps the family members as close as
possible to each other. This can be seen clearly in the family group with pink masks in
Fig. 2b in which the fourth group member is seated in the middle seat close to all the three
5

family members in the back seats. When it is not possible to keep the family members as
close as possible, our model correctly shifts a family member to another seat (groups with
blue masks in Figures. 2a and 2b) to maximize the number of passengers. Also, in these
arrangements, family groups and individual passengers are spread without any specific
pattern as the model maximizes the distance between passengers that do not belong to
a family group. For example, In Fig. 2a, two of the two-member family groups in rows 12
and 16 are separated by three rows and two of them with one row (seated in rows 1 and
3) as opposed to Fig. 2c where all two-member family groups are separated, one after
the other, by one row (rows 8, 10, 12, 14), with one two-member family group located in
the top left seats (row 16). We can observe the same behaviors for three-member and
four-member family groups in Figures 2a, 2b and 2c. We should also note that there are
a large number of arrangements in which only two passengers don’t follow the social
distancing guidelines (not shown here). In some of these arrangements, all the
passengers need to be rearranged to find the optimal arrangement in which passengers
follow the social distancing guidelines. Our model, along with simulated Annealing Monte
Carlo, is clearly able to distinguish these arrangements from the optimal arrangement that
follows the social distancing measures. Moreover, in many cases, there are arrangements
that have the same number of passengers with the same number of groups and individual
passengers as the optimal arrangement, with passengers following the social distancing
measures as well, however, the distances between passengers are not maximized. We
refer to these arrangements as suboptimal arrangements, and in the next section we
discuss them in detail. Our model is clearly able to distinguish between these suboptimal
arrangements and the optimal arrangement and find the optimal arrangement.

Optimal vs Suboptimal Arrangements
We have done extensive simulations for different cases of groups and individual
passengers to find the optimal arrangements and number of passengers and then
compare them with suboptimal arrangements. In Fig. 3, we show our results for the
average total distance between non family passengers per passenger for these cases for
a single aisle layout. These results demonstrate that the average total distance could be
increased by more than 10% in the optimal arrangements as compared to suboptimal
arrangements. We also find that some of the arrangements do not have suboptimal
arrangements or, in some cases, suboptimal arrangements have an average total
distance which is very close to the optimal arrangements. We should note that finding the
optimal number and arrangements of passengers is almost impossible by trial and error.
To investigate the optimal and suboptimal arrangements in more detail, we discuss one
case with two four-member, three three-member, and five two-member family groups for
single and twin aisles layouts. We begin with the single aisle layout and find that the
maximum number of individual passengers that can be fitted with these groups is eleven
6

passengers. In Fig. 4a, we demonstrate the optimal arrangement of passengers for the
groups along with eleven individual passengers. In Fig. 4b, we show a suboptimal
arrangement, which, as we defined, has the same numbers of groups and individual
passengers as the optimal arrangement, and passengers follow the social distancing
measure. To compare the difference between these two arrangements, in Figures 5a and
5b, we, respectively, plot the distance of passengers from other passengers for the
optimal and suboptimal arrangements corresponding to the seat arrangement in Figures
4a and 4b. For clarity in the colorbar, we not only show the distance but also the
percentage that each color occupies in the plots. From these plots, we see that the red
area in the optimal arrangement occupies less area than in the suboptimal arrangement.
This demonstrates that, in the optimal arrangement, the overall distance between
passengers is higher although the number of passengers in both arrangements is the
same, and, in both arrangements, the social distancing measure is followed.

Fig. 3. The average total distance between non family passengers per passenger for some
optimal arrangements versus suboptimal arrangements. The optimal arrangements are shown by
full blue circles and suboptimal arrangements by orange stars. There might be more than one
suboptimal arrangement for each optimal arrangement. The number of groups and individuals are
shown in x-axis as tuples with the following structure (Number of four-member family group,
Number of three-member family group, Number of two-member family group, Number of
individual passengers). Some of the suboptimal arrangements have a closer average total
distance as compared to others, depending on the number of groups, number of members in
groups, and number of individual passengers. Also, the number of suboptimal arrangements
7

changes from case to case, depending on the number of groups, number of members in groups
and number of individual passengers. In some cases, suboptimal arrangements are very close to
optimal arrangements.

8

we see that the suboptimal arrangement has a higher red area than blue, which means that the
distance of passengers is higher in the optimal arrangement than the suboptimal arrangement. In
the colorbar we show the percentage that each color occupies in the plots.

Since passengers who are close to each other have higher health impacts on each other
𝑗

we define quantity 𝑑𝑒𝑓𝑓 =

1
,
∑𝑖 1/𝑟𝑖𝑗

to measure the health impact of close non family

passengers to a passenger (passenger 𝑗) with the assumption that this impact decreases
with the inverse of distance between passengers (1/𝑟𝑖𝑗 ). In this equation 𝑟𝑖𝑗 is the distance
between passenger 𝑖 and 𝑗 and the sum is over all the non family groups that are in the
𝑗

range of 4.3 units distance from passenger 𝑗. 𝑑𝑒𝑓𝑓 has the dimension of distance and we
refer to it as effective distance throughout the rest of this paper, and it decreases as the
distance between passenger 𝑗 and other non family passengers who are in their vicinity
of 4.3 units decreases. We use 4.3 units to only consider the health effects up to three
possible nearest passengers. In Figures 6a and 6b we respectively plot effective distance
for the two arrangements corresponding to Figures 4a and 4b and in the colorbar we not
only show the color related to each effective distance but also the percentage that each
color occupies in the arrangement.

and suboptimal (b) arrangements corresponding to the passengers' arrangements in Figures 4a
and 4b, respectively. For clarity, we show the percentage that each color occupies in each plot in
the corresponding colorbars. Although a few passengers in the suboptimal arrangement have
higher effective distance as compared to others, this is at the cost of all other passengers sitting
closer to each other. Overall, in the optimal arrangement, passengers have higher effective
distance from each other as compared to the suboptimal arrangement.
9

Interestingly, from the first look it seems that in the suboptimal arrangement the dark
green seats, which corresponds to highest effective distance, occupy 5.3% as compared
to the optimal arrangement in which they occupy 2.6%. However, looking more closely
we observe that in the optimal case the percentage of passengers that have the closest
effective distance (violet color) is 23.7% as compared to 36.8% for the suboptimal
arrangement. In addition, gold and light green seats in the optimal case occupy 55.3%
and 18.4%, respectively, as compared to the suboptimal arrangement in which gold and
light green seats occupy 42.1% and 15.8%. Therefore, in the optimal arrangement, the
overall effective distance between passengers is maximized as opposed to the
suboptimal arrangement in which a few passengers are seated farther away from others
at the cost of making all other passengers seated closer to each other. We should add
that seats with higher effective distances can be assigned to passengers that are more
vulnerable to Covid-19.

Passengers Arrangements for Twin Aisle Layout
For the second case, we consider a twin aisle layout with the same number of family
groups as the single aisle layout and find the optimum number of individual passengers
that can be fitted to the seats. Our results show that the optimal number of individual
passengers that can be fitted to the seats with the groups is nineteen. In Fig. 7a we
demonstrate the optimal arrangement and, similarly to the single aisle case, we show the
results of a suboptimal arrangement with the same number of groups and individual
passengers (Fig. 7b). To compare these two arrangements, in Figures 8a and 8b we show
the distance of each passenger from other passengers corresponding to the
arrangements in Figures 7a and 7b. The bigger red area for the suboptimal arrangements
clearly shows that in the optimal arrangement the distance between passengers is higher
than in the suboptimal arrangement. In Figures 9a and 9b, we, respectively, plot the
effective distance (defined in the previous section) of each passenger from other
passengers corresponding to the passenger arrangements in Figures 7a and 7b. From
these two plots we clearly see that, overall, the passengers in the optimal arrangements
have a higher effective distance than suboptimal arrangement. This could be seen more
clearly from the percentage of area that each color occupies (shown in the colorbar).
Unlike the single aisle case, in this case, we observe that in the optimal arrangement the
dark green area occupies 8.7% of the seats as compared to 4.3% for the suboptimal
arrangement. This shows that, in some cases, our model not only maximizes the overall
distance between passengers but also creates more seats that have the highest distance
from other seats as compared to suboptimal cases. We should also add that, in the
optimal arrangement, the light green, gold and violet seats occupy 13.0%, 32.6%, and
45.7% of seats, respectively, as compared to the suboptimal case, in which light green,
gold, and violet occupy 13%, 19.6%, and 63.0% of seats, respectively.

Conclusion
Social distancing measures, which have been imposed by governments to reduce the
health impacts of Covid-19, have had a big impact on businesses that have on-site
customers as they have had to limit their on-site capacity. These businesses have mostly
implemented social distancing by installing signages that block some spaces and guide
customers to keep the recommended distance from other customers. However, to the
best of our knowledge, they have not used modeling and optimization methods to
optimize the number of people and their arrangements on their sites. In this study, we
introduced a model with quantity Spread, and we proposed that by minimizing Spread, it
is possible to maximize the number of people and their distances for social distancing
measures on a site. To illustrate this, we studied a real-world case from the airline industry
and optimized the number of passengers and the arrangements of passengers for the
single and twin aisles aircraft layouts using AMC method. We showed that our model
correctly arranges the family members groups close to each other and maximizes the
distance between non family members. Moreover, we demonstrated that our obtained
arrangements of passengers have higher distance between passengers than any
12

suboptimal arrangement with the same number of passengers and a social distancing
measure. The optimal arrangements of passengers have complex patterns, which depend
on the number of groups, the number of members in each group, and the number of
individual passengers. Our results clearly show that the optimal arrangements of
passengers minimize the health and economic impacts of Covid-19 by maximizing the
number of passengers and their distances under a social distancing measure. Moreover,
we demonstrated that among the seats that are allocated to passengers, some seats
have higher effective distances from other seats. These seats could be assigned to
passengers who are more vulnerable to Covid-19 to reduce the health impact of Covid19. These results clearly show that our model or its variants, along with optimization
methods such as Annealing Monte Carlo method, must be utilized to minimize the health
and economic impacts of Covid-19 for businesses that have on-site employees and
customers. Our model could be applied to various organizations and companies with onsite people such as classrooms, theaters, restaurants, sporting events, waiting rooms,
medical centers, etc.

Methods
Monte Carlo Simulations. As it was discussed in the Model section our aim is to find the
positions of family groups and individual passengers by minimizing Spread (𝑆𝑡𝑜𝑡 ) using
Annealing Monte Carlo simulation. Below we use the terms individual and individuals as
a replacement for person and people.
We start the simulation by assigning a random position to all individuals as the first AMC
step. In each AMC step, we apply Monte Carlo simulation to find the local minimum of
Spread for individuals. In every MC step, each individual (i) is allowed to minimize their
own Spread by moving one step in a direction based on the Metropolis Hastings Algorithm
[31]: 𝑝 = 𝑚𝑖𝑛{1, exp (−(𝑠𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑑𝑛𝑒𝑤𝑖 − 𝑠𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑑𝑜𝑙𝑑𝑖 )/𝑇)}. If the Spread of the individual
cannot be accepted, the individual does not move. At each AMC step, we decrease T and
change the position of an individual randomly. Then we allow all individuals to find their
optimum positions based on the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. This algorithm is
“capitalistic” in nature, as each individual lowers only their own Spread. This does not
automatically mean that 𝑆𝑡𝑜𝑡 finds its global minimum.
The algorithm used in our code can be described in more details as below:
•Start.
Get initial individual positions randomly as trial positions.
𝑜𝑙𝑑
• According to Eq. 2, calculate 𝑆𝑡𝑜𝑡

• Start AMC with high temperature (𝑇 = 2.3 × 109 , 𝑇1 = 𝑇 and j = 1).
