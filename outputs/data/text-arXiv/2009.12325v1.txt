Abstract
• Background: To assist policy makers in taking adequate decisions to
stop the spread of COVID-19 pandemic, accurate forecasting of the disease
propagation is of paramount importance.
• Materials and Methods: This paper presents a deep learning approach
to forecast the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases using Bidirectional
Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) network applied to multivariate
time series. Unlike other forecasting techniques, our proposed approach
first groups the countries having similar demographic and socioeconomic
aspects and health sector indicators using K-Means clustering algorithm.
The cumulative cases data for each clustered countries enriched with data
related to the lockdown measures are fed to the Bidirectional LSTM to
train the forecasting model.
• Results: We validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach by studying the disease outbreak in Qatar. Quantitative evaluation, using multiple
evaluation metrics, shows that the proposed technique outperforms stateof-art forecasting approaches.
• Conclusion: Using data of multiple countries in addition to lockdown
measures improve accuracy of the forecast of daily cumulative COVID-19
cases.

Introduction
In December 2019, Wuhan, the capital of Central China’s Hubei province,
with 11 millions population, has witnessed the outbreak of a new coronavirus
(COVID-19) [1, 2]. The virus has propagated in China then all over the world.
On the 11th March 2020, with more than 280k cases and more than 4000 deaths
worldwide, it has been declared as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) [3]. Within few months, the number of cases has exponentially
grown to more than 17 millions and more than 670k deaths by end of July 2020.
Various research works have been conducted to get better insights about the
propagation of the virus and the evolution of number of cases and deaths while
racing against the time to develop an effective vaccine. These works can be
categorized into machine learning based and mathematical modeling-based.
Saba et al. [4] studied the propagation of COVID-19 in Egypt and applied a
nonlinear autoregressive artificial neural network to forecast the virus prevalence. The authors modeled the confirmed cases as time series and compared
their approach against Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)
model. Both approaches are used to forecast the cumulative COVID-19 cases
for ten days (1 to 10 April 2020) using the confirmed cases reported on March.
In [5], the authors applied exponential smoothing approach and conducted five
rounds of forecast of cumulative confirmed cases globally starting from the 1th
February till 21th March 2020. The authors emphasized that forecasts related
to the virus outbreak must be an integral part of any decision-making process
particularly in high risk cases. Indeed, this enables authorities to explore various ’what if’ scenarios in order to assess the implication of any decision. Ahmar
et al. [6] proposed to apply a variety of ARIMA, called SutteARIMA, for shortterm forecast of COVID-19 cases in Spain and the impact on the Spanish Market
Index (IBEX). Data from February 12 till April 2 are used to train the model
to forecast the data from April 3 to 9. The Mean Absolute Percentage Error

2

(MAPE) metric is calculated to assess the fitting accuracy. The findings showed
that SutteARIMA outperformed ARIMA model. In [7], the authors compared
six prediction techniques to forecast the cumulative cases in ten Brazilian states:
ARIMA, cubist regression, random forest, ridge regression, support vector regression, and stacking-ensemble learning. The prediction is conducted for multiple time horizons: one day, three days and six days ahead. Chimula et. [8]
studied the propagation of the virus in Canada using Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) neural network, known to be efficient with sequential data. The results
show that Canada had a linear growth of number of cases until March 16, 2020
followed by an exponential growth. It has been estimated that the ending point
of the outbreak is around June. Maleki et al. [9] applied TP-SMN-AR, a variation of autoregressive models to forecast the confirmed and recovered number
of cases worldwide. This prediction is conducted for the period between April
21 till April 30.
Mathematical models of infectious disease have been also applied in attempt to
obtain better insight about the virus outbreak. Kuniya [10] applied the SEIR
model to predict the epidemic peak in Japan from 15 January to 29 February. SEIR provides a mathematical formulation to describe the transmission of
a disease from an individual to another. These individuals pass through four
states: susceptible (S), exposed (E), infectious (I) and recover (R). The study
showed that the basic reproduction number R0 - ”the average number of secondary infections produced by a typical case of an infection in a population
where everyone is susceptible” [11]- is 2.6 with a 95% Confidence Interval 2.42.8. The SEIR model also showed that the peak will occur on early-middle
summer 2020. Furthermore, some epidemiological conclusions are drawn: the
intervention has great implication on delaying the epidemic peak. It also must
be conducted over a long period to ensure effective reduction of the epidemic
size. In [12], the authors applied SIR model to predict the daily cases in Algeria. SIR takes into account the number of susceptible cases (S), the number of
infected cases (I) and the number of Recovered cases (R). The model showed
that the peak is expected on July 24 at worst and that the disease will disappear
3

between September and November. Roosa et al. [13] used three phenomenological models: the generalized logistic growth model [14], the Richards model [15]
and a sub-epidemic wave model [16] for real-time forecasts of the COVID-19 cumulative number of confirmed reported cases in Hubei province, China. These
models were previously applied to forecast several infectious diseases including
Ebola, SARS, pandemic Influenza, and Dengue. Authors in [17] studied the effect of weather on the spread of COVID-19. Using the daily cases in 50 US states
between January 1 and April 9 in addition to temperature and absolute humidity information, the authors identified the vulnerable narrow absolute humidity
range. States with absolute humidity between 4 and 6 g/m3 have significant
spread with more than ten thousands cases. The findings are used to determine
the Indian regions with potential vulnerability to weather based spread.
It is widely known that lockdown measures, e.g. restriction on gathering, school
and workplace closing, public transport shutdown and international travel controls, are needed for halting the spread of the virus. Atalan et al [18] conducted a
data analysis and showed evidence that lockdown can contribute in suppressing
COVID-19 pandemic. Dawoud [19] emphasized on the importance of preventive
measures including social distancing and mask usage for efficient lockdown exit
strategy. Sahoo et al [20] conducted a data-driven approach to analyze the effect of lockdown in India. The authors showed that after six weeks of lockdown,
the infection rate reached three times lower compared to the initial one. Hence,
the lockdown measures are quintessential to manage such pandemic. However,
these measures are rarely considered when forecasting COVID-19 daily or cumulative cases. Furthermore, most COVID forecast methods typically rely on
limited data of a single country. Yet countries having common demographic and
socio-economic properties and similar health sector indicators can exhibit similar
pandemic patterns. Our contribution consists of first grouping countries having
similar demographic and socio-economic properties and health sector indicators
then using COVID-19 data from each cluster to build the prediction model. This
yields a richer dataset for training. Furthermore, we propose a deep learning
based forecasting approach using a Bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM). This type
4

of neural network not only relies on the past data to predict the future, but
it also enables learning from the future to predict the past. By adopting such
learning framework, Bi-LSTM provides better understanding of the learning
context [21]. Additionally, to train our Bi-LSTM-based model, we use multivariate time series consisting of the daily cumulative number of cases and time
series describing the lockdown measures: the school closing, workspace closing, restriction on gathering, public transport closing and international travel
controls. The proposed Bi-LSTM on multivariate time series allows multiple
dependent time series to be modelled together to account for the correlations
cross and within the series capturing variables changing simultaneously over
time.

Materials and Methods
We depict in Fig. 1 the overall approach to predict the daily cumulative
cases of COVID-19. First, we collect data describing the demographic and
socioeconomic properties and health sector of countries of the world. These data
are clustered to identify group countries that have similar properties. We first
apply the Elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters to pass as
an input parameter for the K-Means algorithm. Next, given a particular country,
we identify its cluster. Multivariate time series are then constructed consisting
of daily cumulative cases of all countries belonging to the cluster in addition to
time series describing the level of lockdown measures associated to travel control
(border closing), school closing, workplace closing, public transport shutdown
and public gathering ban. The multivariate time series is used to train a deep
learning Bi-LSTM network to forecast future cumulative number of cases. It
is worthwhile to mention that this approach is applicable for any country to
forecast its daily cumulative COVID-19 cases.

Clustering countries based on demographic, socioeconomic and health
sector indicators
We describe in this section the demographic, socioeconomic and health sector
indicators used to cluster countries. Then we present the approach used to
cluster countries having similar properties. This yields a richer dataset for
training COVID-19 cumulative cases prediction model per countries cluster.
Demographic, socioeconomic and health sector indicators data
These data have been collected from the Department of Economic and Social
Affairs of the United Nations and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation
and Development. The data include:
• Median age per country.
• Population percentage of age groups per 4 years interval e.g. 4-9 year,
10-14 years etc.
• Country population and density.
• The percentage of urban population.
• Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita.
• The number of hospitals per 1000 people.
• Death rate from lung diseases per 100k people for female and male.
Countries clustering
To discover countries having similar characteristics we applied K-Means clustering algorithm [22, 23] to identify similar members among the data points. Let
X = {x1 , x2 , ..., xn } be the set of d-dimensional points we seek to cluster into K
clusters. In other words, we attempt to assign each xi , i = 1, ..., n to a cluster
ck , k = 1, ..., K. K-Means partitions the data such that the squared error between the mean of a cluster and the data points, members of the clusters, is as

6

low as possible. Let mk be the mean of cluster ck . The squared error between
a cluster center and its members is defined as:
J(ck ) =

X

||xi − mk ||2

(1)

xi ∈ck

K-Means seeks to minimize the sum of the squared errors:
J(C) =

K X
X

||xi − mk ||2

(2)

k=1 xi ∈ck

Where C is the set of clusters. To minimize Eq. 2, the following algorithm is
applied:
1. Randomly assign K cluster centers and repeat step 2 and 3.
2. Assign each data point to the closest cluster center.
3. Calculate the new cluster centers.
However, K-Means requires the number of clusters to be known. Hence, we
applied the Elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters for
which the obtained partition is compact, i.e. low J(C). Naturally, adding more
clusters would result in even more compact partition which may lead to overfitting. Hence, the variation of J(C) with respect to K would exhibit first a
sharp decrease followed by a slow one. The Elbow method recommends to select
the number of cluster corresponding to the elbow of the curve J(C) vs K.
Bi-LSTM for COVID-19 cumulative cases prediction
After K-Means is applied to group countries, we collect the multivariate time
series data for the countries of each cluster to train a prediction model using a
Bi-LSTM deep neural network. The motivation is to strengthen the prediction
accuracy by forcing the network to train not only on past data to predict the
future but also to train it on the future data to predict the past.
Multivariate time series data
The multivariate time series has more than one time-dependent variable.
Intrinsically, these variables are also dependent on each others. Indeed, it is
7

confirmed that lockdown measures have significant impact on the evolution of
the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases. Our times series consists of:
• Cumulative COVID-19 cases per day. These data are widely available
and several APIs provided by government agencies can be queried for this
information. We collect data from February 15th to July 31st.
• School closing: This time series describes the level of lockdown imposed
on schools where 0 indicates no measures,1- recommend closing, 2- require
closing (only some levels or categories, e.g. just high school, or just public
schools) and 3- require closing all levels.
• Workplace closing, where 0 indicates no measures,1- recommend closing
(or recommend work from home), 2- require closing (or work from home)
for some sectors or categories of workers and 3- require closing (or work
from home) for all-but-essential workplaces (e.g. grocery stores, doctors).
• Restrictions on gatherings: where 0 indicates no restrictions, 1- restrictions
on very large gatherings (the limit is above 1000 people), 2- restrictions on
gatherings between 101-1000 people, 3- restrictions on gatherings between
11-100 people, 4- restrictions on gatherings of 10 people or less.
• Public transport shutdown where 0 indicates no measures, 1- recommend
closing (or significantly reduce volume/route/means of transport available) and 2- require closing (or prohibit most citizens from using it)
• International travel controls where 0 indicates no restrictions,1- screening
arrivals, 2- quarantine arrivals from some or all regions, 3- ban arrivals
from some regions and 4- ban on all regions or total border closure.
Training the prediction model for COVID-19 cumulative cases
The building block of the network is the LSTM cell depicted in Fig. 3. Given
the current value xt , the previous hidden state ht−1 and the previous state Ct−1 ,
the following transformations are applied:


ft = σ Wf · [ht−1 , xt ] + bf
8

(3)



it = σ Wi [ht−1 , xt ] + bi


Ĉt = tanh WC [ht−1 , xt ] + bc

(4)

Ct = ft ∗ Ct−1 + it ∗ Ĉt


ot = σ Wo [ht−1 , xt ] + bo

(6)

ht = ot ∗ tanh(Ct )

(8)

(5)

(7)

Where σ and tanh are the sigmoid and hyperbolic tangent function respectively.
ft is the forget gate, it is the input gate and ot is the output gate. W and b are
the weight matrix and bias vector respectively. [·] is the concatenation operator
and ∗ is the dot product. Hence, an LSTM layer consists of a sequence of
LSTM cells and the sequence data are fed in a forward way. Bi-LSTM includes
another LSTM layer for which the data is fed in backward way as depicted in
Fig. 4. By stacking multiple Bi-LSTM layers, i.e. the output of one layer is
fed to another one, a deep neural network can be trained to forecast the next
day cumulative number of cases. The network is trained using backpropagation
[24] [25] algorithm to minimize the mean squared error between the actual daily
cumulative cases and the value predicted by the network.

Experiments
The proposed technique is versatile. Indeed, the forecast can be applied for
any country. In our experiment, We aim at using information from the previous
6 days to predict the next day cumulative cases. We focus on Qatar as a use-case
and we analyze and assess the forecast performance of the proposed technique
and compare against multiple techniques with multiple scenarios.
Evaluation approach
We analyze the performance by:
• Comparing the prediction performance of the proposed approach against
LSTM model. We show the benefit of: 1- Training the learning models

9

on data from all countries in the same cluster. 2- Including lockdown
information in the training data.
• Comparing against state-of-art techniques including ARIMA, Simple Moving Average with 6-day window and Double Exponential Moving Average.
• Evaluating the prediction accuracy by reporting the Root Mean Square
Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Coefficient of Residual Mass
(CRM) and the Determination Coefficient R2 where:

Where xi , yi , x̂ and ŷ are the actual reported cumulative cases, predicted cumulative cases, average reported cumulative cases and average predicted cumulative
cases respectively. The best prediction is the one achieving the lowest RMSE,
MAE, the highest R2 and the closest CRM value to zero.
COVID-19 in Qatar
We illustrate in Fig. 2 the evolution of the daily cumulative cases in Qatar
from March 10 to July 31. Till end of March, the cumulative cases evolved in a
linear trend. Then, numbers have started to grow exponentially till mid June.
By mid June, the growth of number of cases has started to slow down. The first
confirmed case has been reported on February 29. By July 31, 235 cases have
been reported. All lockdown measures have been imposed on March. School

10

were all closed on March 10. Then, all public transport services have been shutdown on March 15. Borders have been closed on March 17 and quarantine is
required on arrivals from all regions for nationals. Workplace have been also
closed for some sectors on March 18 and public gathering for more than 10 persons has been prohibited on March 22. By July 31, the total cumulative cases
reached 110460.

Data clustering
By clustering the socioeconomic and demographic properties data and the
health sector indicators data, we intend to discover countries having similar
properties. For the Elbow method, we use the distortion, i.e. the mean squared
distances to the cluster centers, as a metric. Results are depicted in Fig. 5.
The findings suggest that K = 43 corresponds to the Elbow and is the optimal
number of clusters. Clustering results using K-Means show that Qatar shares
similar properties as Oman, Bahrain and United Arab Emirates (UAE). Our
findings also show that for example, Belgium, Canada, Finland, Sweden and
United Kingdom are in the same group.
Fig. 6 shows the cumulative cases of Qatar, Oman, Bahrain and UAE. We
notice that Qatar exhibits the most severe growth in number of cases, with
exponential-like shape. UAE exhibits two linear trends. The first one, witnessed till end of March, is linear with slow growth. Then, we notice a second
linear trend with sharper growth in number of cases. For Bahrain, the increase
is less severe compared to the two other countries. Oman initially had a linear
increase of number of case. However, a sharper increase is witnessed starting
from June. We illustrate in Fig. 7 the actual growth of number of cases for Qatar
and the forecasting results for LSTM and Bi-LSTM with and without lockdown
information. Models are trained on data of all countries in the cluster. For
illustration purposes, we show data from June 15 to July 31. The findings show
deep learning techniques succeeded in capturing the trend of cumulative cases in
Qatar. The predictions curves are similar to the actual cumulative cases data.
11

To further assess the prediction performance, we conduct quantitative analysis,
detailed in Table. . Results show that Bi-LSTM with lockdown information
results in the lowest RMSE, MAE, the highest R2 score and the closest CRM
value to zero while the best performance is achieved when the model is trained
on all data of the cluster to which Qatar belongs rather than Qatar data only.
In fact, this is confirmed by both the RMSE and CRM values comparison. Results also allow us to confirm the importance of including lockdown information
as they improved the performance of both LSTM and Bi-LSTM models. We
further compare the proposed approach against state-of-art time series forecasting approaches including ARIMA, Simple Moving Average with 6-day window
(SMA-6) and Double Exponential Moving Average (D-EXP-EMA) . Fig. 8 illustrates the forecasting results. It clearly shows how the proposed technique
outperformed other approaches. Infact, SMA-6 and ARIMA tend to underestimate the total number of cases, while D-EMA over-estimates the number of
cases. This performance is quantitatively confirmed by the evaluation metrics
detailed in Table .2

Discussion
Predicting cumulative COVID-19 cases is a challenging task as it depends
on several complex and highly dependable parameters. The disease outbreak
depends on the lockdown measures and how fast they are imposed. In our
proposed approach, we aimed at incorporating several parameters to achieve
accurate forecast by: 1- maximizing the data used to train a forecasting model
by grouping countries having similar properties: 2- using a Bi-LSTM model
trained on both number of cases and lockdown measures. It has been confirmed
that rushing towards easing lockdown measures has contributed in an increase
of number of cases. This has been the case of Florida and Texas, USA. In fact,
Florida reopened certain business on May 4 and Florida Keys businesses were
allowed to reopen to visitors on June 1. In Texas, school districts were allowed
to open. Both states witnessed significant growth in number of cases. The

12

proposed solution may assist decision-makers to put short-term future plans to
overcome the epidemic and to carefully choose the opening strategy.

Conclusion
We proposed a deep learning based solution to forecast the daily cumulative
COVID-19 cases. The proposed approach grouped countries having similar
demographic socioeconomic and health sector properties in order to train the
forecasting model on data associated to the cluster rather than data of each
country separately. By using Bi-LSTM and including lockdown information in
the forecasting data, the proposed approach achieved significant improvement
in the prediction performance compared to state-of-art techniques with Qatar
as a use case. In future, work, we will establish lockdown easing scenario and
investigate the forecasting results in order to analyze the impact of the easing
on the increase/decrease of number of cumulative cases.
