Abstract
In this paper, we have applied the logistic growth regression model and genetic algorithm to
predict the number of coronavirus infected cases that can be expected in upcoming days in India
and also estimated the final size and its peak time of the coronavirus epidemic in India.
1. Introduction
The epidemic of person-to-person transmissible pneumonia caused by the severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2, also known as COVID-19) has sparked a
global alarm. The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge
from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes. As of 23rd March 2020, there have
been around 294,110 confirmed cases reported, with 12,944 deaths all around the world,
affecting around 177 countries and territories. Milan Batista [1] used the logistic model in
estimation of the final size and its peak time of the coronavirus epidemic in China, South Korea,
and the rest of the World, which gave a reasonable description of the epidemic in those places. In
this paper, we try to estimate the final size of the epidemic for India and also do daily
predictions, that is predicting the expected number of infected cases in upcoming days using the
logistic model and genetic algorithm with the data compiled by the Johns Hopkins University
Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CCSE) from various sources including the
World Health Organization (WHO).

2. Estimations for India
Based On the available data as of 24th March 2020, the predicted final size of coronavirus
epidemic in India using the logistic model and genetic algorithm is approximately 111185 cases
and the peak of the epidemic will be on 18-Apr-2020. The estimated initial doubling time (time
required for the number of cases to double) is 3.6 days.

Short term forecasting is given in Table 2, which gives the predictions made for number of cases
expected in upcoming days in India. We can see that the error percentages for predictions of the
last 3 days lies within 5%, but the error percentages of initial predictions are relatively high.

3. Logistic growth model and Genetic algorithm
In the field of mathematical epidemiology, where we use mathematical models to study how
infectious disease progress and show the likely outcome of an epidemic, one can use the
Phenomenological model, which will describe the empirical relationship of different phenomena
associated with the disease epidemic. Using the phenomenological approach, the epidemic
dynamics can be described by the following variant of the logistic growth model [2-5]

dC

Where C is an accumulated number of cases, r  0 infection rate, and K  0 is the final epidemic
size. If C(0) = C0  0 is the initial number of cases, then the solution of (1) is

C (t ) 

And we have the limiting condition

K

(2)

lim C (t )  K which (2) follows, where K is the final size
t 

of the epidemic which has to be estimated.
There are three parameters in the logistic model (2): K, r, and A which should be calculated by
least-square fit using the MATLAB function lsqcurvefit. Starting with initial guess of parameters
K0, r0, and A0, lsqcurvefit finds the final parameters Kn, rn, and An to best fit the nonlinear
function (2) (solution of the logistic growth function) in accordance to our dataset. lsqcurvefit
finds any optimal coefficient x in accordance to the given data by solving the following
optimization problem:

min  F ( x, xdata)  ydata 22  min   F  x, xdatai   ydatai 
x

x

(14)

Where F(x, xdata) is the prediction made by the nonlinear function for xdata, with respect to
coefficient x. And ydata is the actual data.
The initial guess of the parameters K0, r0, and A0 and the prediction of final epidemic size using
iterated Shanks transformation [6], can be done following the similar procedure in the paper by
Milan Batista [1].
Once we obtained the final parameters Kn, rn, and An using least-square fit, we can further reestimate the parameters by doing a least absolute value fit, by applying Genetic algorithm search
with a constraint that the values of the parameter can vary up to 10%. Genetic algorithm searches
for the parameters which minimizes the absolute value of difference between actual and
predicted values, obeying given the constraints. Genetic algorithm is available in Global
optimization tool box in MATLAB.
4. Conclusion
Based On the available data as of 24th March 2020, the predicted final size of coronavirus
epidemic in India using the logistic model and genetic algorithm search is approximately 111185
cases. Regression convergence depends significantly on the initial guess of parameters K, r and
A, and it may fail to converge for small data set or when initial guess of parameters are randomly
assigned. We intend to further improve our model by collecting more data from upcoming days.
