Abstract
In a previous note we made an analysis of the spreading of the COVID
disease in Italy. We used a model based on the logistic and Hubbert
functions, the analysis we exploited has shown limited usefulness in terms
of predictions and failed in fixing fundamental indications like the point of
inflection of the disease growth. In this note we elaborate on the previous
model, using multi-logistic models and attempt a more realistic analysis.

Introduction

The Covid-19 pandemic disease is bringing elements of novelty baffling for politicians, M D’s and epidemic analyzers.
It has already been stressed that, in absence of any anti-viral strategy, the
only defense towards the spreading of the illness is the Nation lockdown, a policy difficult to implement in Italy. It has undergone different phases and lack
of effective decisions, while the infection was raging in Italy and attacking the
rest of Europe.
The public health structures have suffered from an un-precedent stress in
terms of people to care and of casualties. Regarding this last point, in Italy the
percentage of deaths seems to be larger than abroad, but this might be result
of absence of an accurate sampling of the positive cases.

The lack of informations on the infecting capabilities of the virus and other
uncertainties associated with a clear understanding of how the infection developed during the early stages of its spreading and a poor knowledge on the real
entity of the “submerged” cases as well, made any attempt to fix the peak of
the distribution of the infected/day denied by the facts themselves.
In a previous note, by the present group of Authors [1], two paradigmatic
tools have been exploited to study the evolution of the illness:
A) The logistic function [2, 3, 4] (LF ) (Fig. 1) describing the evolution of a
given population N (τ ) of N0 individuals at τ = 0 (in the present case infected
people) in an environment with carrying capacity K and growth rate r, is

namely the saturation of the infection by the end of April, the peak of infection

The officially presented data on March 20 upset this “reassuring” scenario
and modified Fig. 4a as reported in Fig. 4b. The latter being characterized by
an apparently anomalous behavior, dominated by an increase which mocks any
every forecast based on a simple logistic model.

As already stressed in Ref. [1], the analysis of the data at national territory
level had been developed with the bias that the barycenter of illness was shifted
towards the north of Italy. What was going to happen in those days has been
that the cases from the rest of Italy were surpassing those in Lombardia (see
Fig. 5). This imposes a new scenario in terms of statistical analysis as discussed
in the forthcoming sections.

Covid Bi-Logistic Models

In Ref. [1] we underscored the possibility that the logistic model might be not
suitable for a description at national level in view of various in-homogeneities of
the distribution of the infection and for the delay in the propagation, presumably also mediated by the massive transfer of people from north to south of Italy.
Before considering a more elaborated point of view, we consider the data from
“Regione Lombardia” only, where we have reported the relevant logistic curve
(Fig. 6). It should be noted that the curves are relevant to sum of casualties
and infected.

The fit of the Hubbert with 95% of confidence band is given in Fig. 7,
which displays three possible scenarios for the behavior of the infected and deceased/day. According to the previous forecasting, the peak should be reached
in the next days. The lower curve predicts a peak by the end of march.

In order to extend the analysis to the national territory, we have elaborated
a different strategy using the bi-logistic analysis. We have therefore considered
the incoherent sum of two logistics [6, 7]. They are characterized by different
growth rates and carrying capacities. The time differences τ2 − τ1 represents
the time lag between the starting point of the two evolutions

In Fig. 8 we have reported the results of a 6 parameters fit (N0,i , ri , τi ), i = 1, 2,
and assuming a lag time of 31 days, corresponding to the difference in time
between the (official) start of the disease and the crossing time between the two
curves in Fig. 5.

The fit displays almost equivalent N0 and K, but different growth rates.
Regarding the associated Hubbert curve we obtain a plot exhibiting two peaks,
with a delay between the two. This is a possible scenario, albeit questionable
since it assumes that the rest of Italy starts to contribute to the counting after
a significant time lag.
An alternative strategy is that summarized in Figs. 9 and 10, in which
we have treated Lombardia and the rest of Italy as separated entities. The fit
has been done using two independent logistics which have been summed “incoherently”, thus getting two distinct Hubbert curves and the relevant sum,
exhibiting the peak in the next few days.

Final Comments

In this follow up we have exploited a larger number of data on Covid spreading
and evolution in Italy, to gain a more accurate scenario on the present status
and how it may evolve.
Regarding this last point, many caveats are in order mainly with the understanding of the consistency of the submerged positives and how they may

evolve in the next days. At moment it is not possible to have a clear understanding of the impact of the restrictions on the evolution of the illness diffusion.
The data from the single Italian regions may be, within this respect, instructive.
In Figs. 11-12-13 we have reported the Hubbert curves of a selected sample of
regions1 . The plots display an almost coherent scenario with a slow decrease of
the emergency in the next months (May). It is worth noting that regarding some
regions (for example Basilicata and Sicilia) the situation is still evolving. The
available data do not allow a reliable analysis in terms of Logistic and Hubbert
curves (the 95% confidence interval is extremely wide) and no peak emergency
can be foreseen. This forecast may be even optimistic and new outbreak of
infections, which may spontaneously germinate if restrictions are not properly
followed or if not surveyed cases will emerge as acute diseases.

A final element of discussion comes from Fig. 14 where we have reported the
worldwide and Italian evolution of the Covid cases/day2 , a kind of bi-logistic
pattern is evident, which supports the ideas put forward in this and in the previous note.
What we have attempted here is a little more than the picture of the situation, the lesson we may learn from the present pandemia is important but will
be completely understood when not only Italian but the worldwide pattern will
be clarified. Probably long time after the end of emergency.
