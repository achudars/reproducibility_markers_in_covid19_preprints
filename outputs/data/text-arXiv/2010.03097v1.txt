A generalisation of the Susceptible-Infectious model is made to include a time-dependent transmission rate, which leads to a close analytical expression in terms of a logistic function. The solution
can be applied to any continuous function chosen to describe the evolution of the transmission rate
with time. Taking inspiration from real data of the Covid-19, for the case of cumulative confirmed
positives and deaths, we propose an exponentially decaying transmission rate with two free parameters, one for its initial amplitude and another one for its decaying rate. The resultant time-dependent
SI model, which under extra conditions recovers the standard Gompertz functional form, is then
compared with data from selected countries and its parameters fit using Bayesian inference. We
make predictions about the asymptotic number of confirmed positives and deaths, and discuss the
possible evolution of the disease in each country in terms of our parametrisation of the transmission
rate.

INTRODUCTION

The epidemics of Covid-19 has prompted a lot of researchers from different fields to use their diverse expertise to understand the nature of the Sars-Cov-2 virus and
its spreading worldwide. In particular, out of the medical
sciences, the epidemics has revealed a rich ground where
physicists, mathematicians and statisticians are eager to
apply their knowledge and contribute to its ameriolation
and containment at the local and global stages.
From the formal point of view, there has been a lot
of research in the so-called epidemic models and their
mathematical properties, see for instance [1, 2], being the
compartmental models the most widely used and studied. The models in general consider the classification of
a given population in some parts: Susceptible (S), Infective (I), Recovered (R), among others, and are then
dubbed in terms of which of them they consider for the
dynamics of the disease: SIR, SEIR, etc. There is historical evidence that such models are in good agreement
with the dynamics of past epidemics [1], and such past
successes have triggered its use in the present crisis, see
for instance [3–11].
However, there is an inherent difficulty in studying the
Covid-19 epidemics in real time: that data collection is
not perfect, and in most cases is certainly incomplete
and not very useful to fully characterize the evolution of
the epidemics [12, 13]. One then must question whether
the use of very complex models is convenient, given the
scarcity and flaws of the data series. Actually, it seems
that simple models are sufficient to understand the epidemics [14, 15].
Given the above considerations, here we study the simplest of compartmental models and use it for the description of the current epidemics in different countries. The

∗

model only accounts for two parts of the population: Susceptibles and Infectives, and is known as the SI model.
The infectives in the model are not supposed to recover,
and then its number is an ever increasing function of
time, which is what one sees in the daily reports of cumulative infectives released by health authorities worldwide.
In this respect, the SI model seems to be a convenient one
to follow the evolution of the real data at hand.
However, the original SI model has one free parameter, the transmission rate, which is assumed to be a
constant parameter, but this seems to be an oversimplification that is not in agreement with real data. This
has inspired the use of time-dependent transmission rates
which expand the capabilities of the compartmental models to encompass hidden complexities of the data compilations. Here we take this point of view and consider a
time-dependent transmission rate in terms of an exponentially decreasing function, as it was done first in [16],
and also in [17] (see also [18, 19] for other examples).
Additionally, we also take into account the data series
of cumulative deaths, by means of simple assumptions
withouth extending the SI model, which are thought to
be at least as reliable of those of cumulative infectives,
and probably a better representation of the epidemics
course [14].
A summary of the paper is as follows. In Sec. II,
we present the mathematical description of the standard
SI model, which we call the time-independent version
and give a brief account of its main properties. We
then explain its generalization to accommodate a timedependent transmission rate and find the analytical solution in terms of a logistic function for the general case.
It is argued that, because of the time-dependence of the
transmission rate, the total population number can be
freely choose and there is a simpler, approximated solution of the time-dependent SI system in the limit of
a large population number in the form of a Gompertz
function [20, 21]. Using real data, we look for evidence
of a time-dependent transmission rate in terms of its def-

2
inition within the SI system, and then we propose an
exponential-like parametrisation of the transmission rate.
In Sec. III we use the time-dependent models of Sec. II
and use them to make a fitting of their free parameters
to data from some chosen countries. The fit is made by
means of the Bayesian inference, and the results are giving an interpretation in terms of characteristic quantities
and times that are intrinsic to our parametrised transmission rate. Finally, the main conclusions of our study
and future perspectives are summarized in Sec. IV.

(5)

In other words, the saturation value of the infectious people is the whole of the available population. If N is a very
large number, and for the same Ii , the only change is the
position of the inflection point t0 , which just shifts to
larger values.

MATHEMATICAL BACKGROUND
B.

Here we present the main mathematical expressions for
the time-dependent epidemic model, based on the known
compartmental model SI.

A.

Time-independent SI

The SI model is represented by the following set of
equations,
I
Ṡ = −βS ,
N

I
I˙ = βS ,
N

(1)

Time-dependent SI system

Let us now consider the case of a time-dependent infection rate, that is, β = β(t). Notice that we do not
need to change the nature of the original SI system (1),
and then we can use again Eq. (2) to find a solution of
a time-dependent SI system. It can be readily shown
that the solution can be written as a generalized logistic
function [21, 23] (see also [24]),
I(t) =

N
,
1 + eu0 −u

Z
with

u(t) =

t

β(x) dx .

(6a)

0

Here, S (I) is the number of susceptible (infectious) people, the total population is N = S + I, β is the infection
rate (ie the probability per unit time that an individual
contracts the disease), and a dot means derivative with
respect to time.1
Because of the conservation equation, the SI system is
truly one-dimensional and represented by the equation,

where u0 is an integration constant. Notice that Eq. (6a)
is again the sigmoid function but only now in terms of a
new variable u. The initial and asymptotic values of the
infected people are given by

I˙ = β (1 − I/N ) I .

Here, u∞ = u(t → ∞), which may or may not be a finite
value, and this depends on the chosen function β, see
Eq. (6a).
Notice that the second derivative of Eq. (2) for a timedependent transmission rate is

(2)

If β is a constant parameter, the solution of Eq. (2) is
the sigmoid, also known as the logistic function [22],
I=

N
,
1 + eβ(t0 −t)

(4)

Then, there is a maximum of the first derivative at
t = t0 , that also corresponds to an inflection point of the
logistic function (I¨ = 0) at which I = N/2. As for the

1 + eu0

I∞ =

where t0 is an integration constant.
From the second derivative of Eq. (3) (the first derivative of Eq. (2)),
I¨ = β I˙ (1 − 2I/N ) .

Ii =

It is possible to define new normalized variables in the form Ŝ =
βS/N and Iˆ = βI/N , and then Eqs. (1) are simply written as
˙
˙
ˆ The constraint equation also becomes
Ŝ = −Ŝ Iˆ and Iˆ = Ŝ I.
ˆ
Ŝ + I = β, and then the transmission rate only appears for the
initial conditions.

˙
I=I
+ β (1 − 2I/N ) .
β

(6c)

Hence, the true inflection point I¨ = 0 does not correspond to I = N/2 anymore as it was in the timeindependent case. However, it can be shown that the
time-independent SI solution (3) is a particular case of
the time-dependent one (6a). In the case β = const.,
one readily obtains that u(t) = βt, and then Eq. (3) is
recovered if also u0 = βt0 .
The exact solution (6a) opens up the possibility to consider the evolution of a disease in which the transmission
rate is changing, whether by natural means or by human intervention. This is a more realistic approach, and
it has the advantage that we can continue dealing with
the accumulated numbers reported by the health systems
worldwide.

C.

The large N limit

In the time-independent SI system, the constant of integration is fixed by the initial conditions and the total
population number, namely eβt0 = N/Ii − 1, and then
the asymptotic value of the infectives is the total population, see Eqs. (5). However, in the time-dependent
case the asymptotic value of infectives also depends on
the asymptotic value u∞ , which means that not all the
population will get infected, that is I∞ < N .
The ratio between the total and the initial number of
infectives can be written as
I∞
1 + eu0
.
=
Ii
1 + Ceu0 −u∞

(I∞ /Ii )eu0
.
1 + eu0 − (I∞ /Ii )

D.

(7)

Here, u∞ is an independent constant, and then one can
obtain the same ratio by adjusting accordingly the values
of u0 and u∞ . In this sense, there is a new degeneracy in
the time-dependent system as the total number of infectives is not uniquely determined by the total population
number N . Explicitly, the degeneracy reads
eu ∞ =

the inflection point t0 in the evolution curve of infectives
is given by the solution of the equation (β̇ + β 2 )(t0 ) = 0.
There is a small warning here about the parametrisation of β. If we assume that the transmission rate is given
by β = β(t, k` ), where k` are in general constant parameters, one must be aware that their values will depend
on N , and then the values obtained from Eq. (11a) are
not the same as those from Eq. (10). They will, in both
cases, deliver the same values of Ii and I∞ , but the evolution profile I(t) will have some differences in the two
cases.

(8)

One important question is whether real data suggests a
complex evolution of the Covid-19 disease, for which the
simple time-independent SI system would be insufficient
to describe it. To get an answer directly from the data
available, we make use here of an analytical result that
can be derived from the general case (6a).
First, we write down the following expression to define
the time-dependent function Γ(t),
Γ(t) ≡

If we keep the ratio (I∞ /Ii ) fixed, we obtain that
lim eu∞ =

u0 →∞

I∞
.
Ii

(9)

The final ratio of infectives, in this limit, can be calculated directly from the asymptotic value of the variable
u. Given that eu0 = N/Ii − 1, we call this the large N
limit.
Actually, one can do the same exercise in the general
expression of infectives. If we write Eq. (6a) (see also
Eq. (6b)) in the form,
I(t) =

1 + eu 0
Ii eu ,
eu + eu 0

Time-dependent β from real data

(10)

I˙
β(t)
=
,
I(1 − I/I∞ )
1 − eu−u∞

which is valid for any form of β and is directly derived
from Eqs. (6); it is also valid for the large N approximation (11a). In the time-independent case, for which
I∞ = N , we readily obtain Γ(t) = β = const. But in the
general case we find at t = 0 that
Γ(0) =

0

The evolution of the disease is simply driven by the transmission rate, and then the asymptotic limit is obtained
if the integral on the rhs of (11a) converges for t → ∞.
Actually, the ratio between the asymptotic and initial
values of infectives is
Z ∞

I∞
' eu∞ = exp
β(x) dx ,
(11b)
Ii
0
which is in turn the same result as in Eq. (9) above.
The expression (11a) gives a simplified evolution of the
disease. For instance, the first derivative is just I˙ = βI,
whereas the second derivative is I¨ = (β̇ + β 2 )I, and then

β(0)
.
1 − e−u∞

(12b)

Another characteristic value is found at late times, as
u → u∞ . In this case, we use the approximation 1 −
eu−u∞ ' u − u∞ , and then from Eq. (6a) we obtain that


we find that for large enough values of u0 , ie N → ∞,
the function of infectives can be approximated as

if such limit exists.
Thus, the function Γ(t) can help us to decide whether
to use the time-independent or the time-dependent SI
system, as the expression (12a) can be easily calculated
from data in countries that already show an asymptotic
value of infectives. In Fig. 1 we show data from Mexico2 ,
which is one of the countries that comply with the foregoing condition, as seen on the left panel for the number
of positives normalized to the latest reported value (the
first day in the time series is that of the first registered
death). Shown also is the evolution of reported deaths,

2

4
which is too normalized to the value of the latest reported
value.
On the right panel of Fig. 1 we see the daily new cases
(with the same aforementioned normalization) divided
by different combinations of accumulated numbers. In
the plots P (D) refers to confirmed positives (deaths).
Notice that the combinations in the plot represent the
function (12a), and then data seems to indicate that Γ(t)
is a decreasing function that approaches a constant value
at late times. In contrast, when we use the expression
˙
I/I,
the ratio goes to zero. Our interpretation is that
data suggest a time-dependent transmission rate β, particularly one that decays with time. Although we only
show the case of Mexico, we have found the same trend
in all cases in which data already shows an asymptotic
value of accumulated positives (eg, Germany, France, and
others).
It is clearly seen that β is in general a decaying function
as time proceeds, which in our opinion is a manifestation
of governmental intervention to slow the spread of the
disease. Although there is not a unique function, given
the profile suggested in Fig. 1, we will consider an exponentially decaying function as an approximation to the
evolution of β. That is, we write it explicitly as
β(t) = k0 e−k1 t ,

(13a)

where k0 , k1 are constant parameters. The corresponding
time variable in Eq. (6a) is

instead write an expression for the time at which the infected population I(t50 ) is one half (50%) of the asymptotic value, ie I(t50 ) = I∞ /2. After some straightforward
algebra using Eqs. (6), we find in general for the generalized time variable that

u50 = u0 − ln 1 + 2eu0 −u∞ .
(15a)
Hence, from the particular parametrisation (13a) we finally obtain


t50 =

.
(15b)
k1
k0 /k1 − u50
We will use t50 as a point of reference in the time series of the different data in our analysis below, similar
to the inflection point of the standard sigmoid function.
Another useful point is that at which the number of infectives is 90% of the asymptotical value, I(t90 ) = 0.9I∞ , as
it can be considered as a reference for the upcoming end
of the infection period. Following the same calculations
that led to Eqs. (15), we find


u90 = u0 − ln 1/9 + (10/9)eu0 −u∞ ,
(16a)
and its corresponding time, again for the particular
parametrisation (13a), is

(13b)

and then for this case we see that u∞ = k0 /k1 .
In the limit k1 t  1 we obtain that u(t) ' k0 t, which
is the expected behavior in the time-independent case.
Then, k0 determines the initial growth of the epidemics,
whereas k1 gives the decay time of the transmission rate,
with a half-life time given by t1/2 = ln 2/k1 .
Likewise, the asymptotic value of the infectives is
I∞ = Ii ek0 /k1 , see Eqs. (9) and (11b), and then the ratio
between the asymptotic and initial values will depend on
the ratio k0 /k1 . Here we see the importance of k1 : the
smaller its value, the larger it takes for the epidemics to
fade away and the larger the asymptotic value of total
infectives.
As for the time-dependent function Γ(t) defined in
Eq. (12a), after using Eqs. (13) we find that
Γ(0) =

1
ln
=
k1

(14)

Notice that Eq. (14) is also in agreement with the expectation from data in Fig. 1: there are well definite values
of Γ(t) at early and late times at late times, where the
value at late times will give us an indication of decay
time of the transmission rate β.
We mentioned before that it is not possible to have an
analytical expression for the inflection time of the sigmoid function (6a) for a general β(t). However, one can

III.

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS AND RESULTS

Our main assumption is that the time series of both
confirmed positives and deaths have a common origin
from the total number of infected people I(t). Formally
speaking, we are assuming that
P (t) = rP I(t) ,

D(t) = rD I(t − tD ) ,

(17)

where rP is the fraction of infected people that is tested
and confirmed as positive, whereas rD is the fraction of
infected people that is confirmed positive and eventually
pass away. Notice that we consider that D(t) evolve with
a time delay tD with respect to I(t) (and also to P (t)).
Such delay is difficult to measure reliably and here we
will report the values suggested by the data itself.
In the following sections we do the fitting to data using two different models. The first one, which we call
model A, considers the generalized logistic function (6a)
and the parametrisation (13a) of the transmission rate.
The second one, which we dub model B, uses the large
N approximation represented by Eq. (11a) and the same
parametrisation of the transmission rate. As discussed
previously in Sec. II D, data seems to discard the timeindependent SI system, but for completeness we also report its fitting to data in Appendix C.

FIG. 1. (Left) Data from Mexico showing the evolution of accumulated confirmed positives and deaths, the time series start
at the date of the first registered death (from March 22 until October 5). The values in the plot are normalized with their
respective last data point. It can be noticed that both quantities seem to have reached an asymptotic final value. (Right)
The estimated evolution of function Γ(t), see Eq. (12a), according to data of new daily cases for both confirmed positives
and deaths. Shown are three different combinations of each data compilation, where P∞ and D∞ are the last data points in
the corresponding time series. The trends of the three cases suggest a decreasing of the transmission rate β with time. The
orange-shaded horizontal region (with vertical range 0.05 − 0.07) is just shown for reference. See Sec. II D and the text for more
details.

A.

Model A and fitting to data

We will consider the following parametrization of the
logistic function of the confirmed positive people, in cumulative numbers,
P (t) = Pi

1 + eu0
.
1 + eu0 −u(t)

(18a)

Following the discussion at the beginning of this section,
we will also consider the reports of accumulated deaths,
which we assume to follow a similar logistic function as
those of the confirmed positive, except for a different amplitude and inflection point,
D(t) = Di

1 + eû0
,
1 + eû0 −u(t−tD )

(18b)

Our model then has seven free parameters: P0 , D0 , tD ,
u0 , û0 , k0 and k1 , and then one does not hope for tight
constraints on them given the scarcity of data about
Covid-19 infections in general. Additionally, one must
remember that data is not generated in a systematic way
as in a laboratory experiment, and there may be many
sources of error in the data management and processing
of new cases.
We will assume that the data provided follows the
trend of the real number of infected people and deaths,
and that both of these numbers will eventually reach a
saturation value in the near future, as it has happened in
past diseases. Moreover, as we do not know the systematic errors in the processing of the data, we will assume
some level of intrinsic error by using a Poisson distribution. To ease the fitting of data from different countries
we normalize the data so that the first point in the time
series is of order of unity. Given this, we consider flat pri-

ors in the form: 0 < Pi < 10, 0 < Di < 10, 0 < tD < 100,
0 < u0 , û0 < 30, and 0 < k0 , k1 < 3.
To fit the data, we will use the EMCEE algorithm by
means of a Python script, using 100 chains with 30000
steps in each one. The results are shown in Fig. 2 for the
free parameters of our model. A common feature of all
the countries we considered, not just the one shown in
Fig. 2, is that the values of Pi , Di , t0 , k0 , k1 , u0 and û0 ,
are all well constrained by the data, which is consistent
with our assumption that both confirmed positives and
deaths follow the same trend of evolution.
We have applied our model to the data of 9 other
countries, which at the moment of writing are the countries with the highest number in cumulative positives and
deaths in terms of their population size, and the fitting
results are summarized in Table I. As said before, P∞
and D∞ are the expected final numbers for the cumulative positives and deaths in each case, even for countries
that have not yet reached an asymptotic value.
The delay time between positives and deaths, tD , is for
all cases lower than 20 days, which is consistent with the
general fact that all deaths were first confirmed as positive, and then tD will represent the delay time between
a positive test and the occurrence of death.
Next are the parameters of the transmission rate β,
where we note a strong similarity in the values of the
different countries. First, we recall that β(0) = k0 , and
then this parameter is the value of the transmission rate
at the start of the time series. Likewise, parameter k1
is the decay rate of the transmission rate. The last two
columns in Table I show the values of the integration
constants u0 and û0 , which are directly related to the
total population number N .
Other quantities of interest, which are derived from the
basic parameters in Table I, are also shown in Table II.

FIG. 2. Triangle plot of the fitting to data from Mexico (see also Fig. 1) of the parameters Pi , Di , tD , , k0 , k1 , u0 and û0 of
model A described in Sec. III A. In general, all parameters are well constrained by the combination of accumulated confirmed
positives and deaths. See the text for more details.

The first one is the total population number N , which
within model A is understood to be the total population
in susceptible form for the spreading of the disease. We
can see that this number is less than the total population
in the case of countries that seem to have the epidemics
under control, but in some others it can be much larger
than the whole world population. This only signals the
lack of convergence of model A for the parameters u0

and û0 , whose fitted values are close to the upper limit
in their priors.
More meaningful is the half-lifetime of the transmission rate represented by t1/2 , which is directly calculated
from parameter k1 . The lowest value corresponds to Belgium with the disease decreasing by half every 15.09 days,
whereas the highest corresponds to Chile for which the
disease decreases by half every 115.51 days. It is interest-

ing to note the relation between t1/2 and the measures
taken to control the epidemics, as the lower values are
for countries with the strictest lockdown measurements.
Almost as meaningful as t1/2 are the values of the halfcrossing times t50 and tD 50 , calculated from Eq. (15b).
The lowest values correspond to Belgium, for which the
half-crossing occurred just 38 and 35 days after the report
of the first deaths. The largest values are for Brazil,
resulting in 157 and 124 days, respectively.
In the top and middle panels of Fig. 3 we show the
comparison of data with the estimated evolution curves
from our fitting, where the latter are represented by
500 instances of the model using a sample of values
around those of maximum likelihood. We see in general a very good agreement with the data, which suggests that Eqs. (18) represent well the evolution of real
data. For reference in the plots, we also show the times
at half-crossing, around which the number of confirmed
positives and deaths were half the asymptotic values P∞
and D∞ , respectively.
Also, in the bottom panel of Fig. 3 we show the time
evolution of the transmission rate β(t) and its comparision with data, represented here by the new daily cases of
both confirmed positives and deaths. We see a very good
agreement with the combination of data that in principle represents the transmission rate. Likewise, there
is good agreement with the combination that represents
the parameter k1 , which in the plot is represented by the
horizontal red-shaded region.
As an extra comparison with data, we show in Fig. 4
the derivative of both confirmed positives and deaths as
obtained from the fitting to data and using the analytical
formula (2) for each case. It must be recalled that the
trend of new cases was not used for the fitting to data,
and then the aforementioned comparison is useful as an
extra validation of the fitting, even if it does not appear
to be as good as for the cumulative cases in Fig. 3. Additionally, the results show that the derivative of the model
can follow the daily evolution of the disease and not just
the global trend.
As a last feature, we show in Fig. 4 the time of halfcrossing with a vertical blue-shaded region, which indi-

Model B and fitting to data

As explained before, for model B we will consider
the following parametrisation of confirmed positives and
deaths, in cumulative numbers,
P (t) = Pi eu ,

D(t) = Di eu(t−tD ) ,

(19)

where the variable u has the same form as in Eq. (13b).
For this parametrisation, we obtain directly that Ṗ /P =
β and Ḋ/D = βek1 tD , and also obtain the same limit
results as in Eqs. (14). Explicitly, the functional form of
model B (19) is

F (t) = Fi exp

(20)

which is no other but the Gompertz function [20, 21, 25].
In this way one can see that there is a direct connnection
between the SI model and the Gompertz function, mediated by an exponentially decaying transmission rate and
what we called the large-N limit.
As said before for this simplified model, see Sec. II C
above, one can find analytical expressions for different
quantities of interest, which are actually the same one
obtains from the Gompertz function (20) [21]. The first
ones are the asymptotic values at t → ∞, which are given
by P∞ = Pi ek0 /k1 and D∞ = Di ek0 /k1 , for confirmed
positives and deaths, respectively.
Another analytical result is the time for the inflection
of the curve, that we denote by t0 following the nomenklature of the time-independent SI system. The expression

where we have included the time shift tD of the function
D(t). Likewise, the numbers of confirmed positives and
deaths at the inflection time are
P0 = Pi ek0 /k1 −1 ,

D0 = Di ek0 /k1 −1 ,

(21b)

which is the same functional form for both of them. One
can easily see that P0 = P∞ /e and D0 = D∞ /e.
The inflection point also corresponds to a maximum in
the derivative of Eqs. (19), and then we find
Ṗ0 = k1 Pi ek0 /k1 −1 ,

Ḋ0 = k1 Di ek0 /k1 −1 .

(21c)

This time the model has five free parameters: Pi , Di ,
tD , k0 and k1 , and as in model A the last two of them
are common to both confirmed positives and deaths. We
will again assume some level of intrinsic error by using a
Poisson distribution and the same normalization of the
data so that the first point is of order of unity. Given
this, we consider flat priors in the form: 0 < Pi < 10,
0 < Di < 10, 0 < tD < 100 and 0 < k0 , k1 < 3.
We again took the EMCEE algorithm by means of a
Python script, using 100 chains with 20,000 steps in each
one. The results are shown in Fig. 5 for the free parameters of our model. As happened before in model A, the
values of P0 , D0 , t0 , k0 , and k1 , are well constrained by
the data and their values are similar and of the same order of magnitude as those of model A. This is seen from
a quick comparison of the common parameters in Figs.
2 and 5.
The fitting values of the parameters of model B, for
the same countries as in model A, are shown in Table III.
Firstly, we notice again that the asymptotic values P∞
and D∞ are quite similar to those obtained for model
A . This indicates that model B, although simpler than
model A, is also a good model to follow the evolution
of the cumulative cases. Secondly, the similarity in the
results extends to the other common parameters between
the models, as is the case of tD , k0 and k1 , which again
supports the validity of model B to fit the data under
simpler assumptions.

The same happens when one compares the fitting results of the half-lifetime t1/2 with those in Table II, they
are very similar one to each other for the respective countries. The similarity extends for the case of the inflection
times t0 and tD0 , which are lower than the half-crossing
times of model A. This is as expected, given that in model
A the half-crossing should happen after the inflection of
the resultant evolution curve. As in Table II, we find
that the lowest characteristic times correspond to Belgium, whereas the highest correspond to Bolivia.
We repeated the comparisons between the data and
model B in the same form as in Fig. 3, the new results
are shown in Fig. 6. As anticipated in Sec. II D, model
B is also good at following the trend of the data and the
only changes are in values of the fitted parameters, which
also result in changes of the final quantities P∞ and D∞ ,
although the obtained values are consistent one to each
other in their order of magnitude in the two models.
Finally, in Fig. 7 we show the comparison of the derivatives of model B for both the confirmed positives and
deaths with their corresponding data. We also see a good
agreement in both the time profile and the location and
height of the maximum points in the two plots. This
time model B is more easily manageable, and we show
the maximum daily new cases as expected from the theoretical expectations. Notice that the time at the location
of the maximum is the same as that of the inflection time
t0 in the evolution of the cumulative cases, see Fig. 6.

FINAL COMMENTS

We have presented a generalization of the well-known
SI system to include the possibility of a time-dependent
transmission rate, and used a particular exponential-like
parametrisation of it to fit and describe the evolution of
real data for the epidemics of Covid-19.
Although the use of time-dependent transmission rates
is not new in the literature of epidemic models, this is the
first time that such approach have been applied to the
SI system, for which there exists an analytical form of

the general solution. The latter is the standard logistic
function but now with a generalized time variable that
results from the direct integration of the transmission
rate. These features simplifies the handling of the model
and eases its comparison with data.
For the functional form of the time-dependent transmission rate we chose a decaying exponential with two
free parameters, the first one for the initial value of the
transmission rate and the second one for its decay rate.
In this form, our generalized model has the enough complexity to fit the data reliably, whereas at the same time
provides meaningful quantities to describe the evolution
of cumulative positives and deaths.
One of those meaningful quantities is the decay rate,
and the related one the half-lifetime of the transmission
rate. It was clear from our results that the half-lifetime
is shorter for countries that have taken the strictest measures of public containment. Other countries seem to
have an almost three times larger half-lifetime, which
means that it will take longer for them to tame the epidemics. Even though in medical terms one may wish
to have a slow epidemics to avoid saturation of hospital
services, this also means that containment measures will
have to take place for longer too, which may result in a
general public tired of the governmental intervention.

Our model also suggest an interesting correlation between the initial value of the transmission rate and its
decay rate: countries that experienced a faster dissemination at the beginning are the ones that report a larger
decay rate, as is the case of Belgium and the United
Kingdom. Likewise, countries with a slow initial spreading seem to be the ones with also a lower decay rate.
These last countries were not hit as badly as others at
the start of their epidemics, but all so far indicates, according to our models, that they will have some of the
highest death tolls in the world.
A surprising result was the connection of the SI system
with the Gompertz function. As explained in the text,
such connection requires some assumptions in between,
mainly that the transmission rate is time-dependent with
an exponential form, and that we consider a large susceptible population. Although the Gompertz function is
quite useful for a plethora of growth phenomena, ours
is the first study that shows a derivation of it from a
infectious model.
One final note on the fittings we obtained for the models. The Bayesian inference is an appropriate method
to fit data if one faces a unique realization of the natural phenomenon under study, which is the case of the
present epidemics of Covid-19, as the data reported by
each country is not at al the result of repeated experiments under controled conditions. In this respect, the
Bayesian analysis allows us to do a sampling of values of
the free parameters around the point of maximum likelihood. This does not mean that one finds the best and
only fitting to data, but the best possible fit given the
proposed model. This helps to explain the well defined
confidence regions in the triangle plots of the fitted parameters, even though the resultant curves may not even
look good by eye when compared to data (see for instance
model C in the Appendix C).
The numbers reported here are not definitive, and they

Notice that ξ(t → −∞) = −β and ξ(t → ∞) = 0,
and in this sense ξ(t) can be considered a kind of timedependent transmission rate, in which the time dependence is clearly inherited from the evolution of the factor
S(t)/N . Actually, the solutions obtained from Eqs. (B1)
are

i−1
Ii 1 + eβt0
S(t) h
β(t−t0 )
, (B4)
= 1+e
, I(t) =
N
1 + e−β(t−t0 )
and then one can also see, after a quick comparison with
Eq. (3), that N = Ii (1 + eβt0 ).
The inflection point t∗ in the evolution of infectives
¨ ∗ ) = 0, which explicitly
is found from the condition I(t
reads


= 0.
(B5)
ξ˙ + ξ 2
t∗

We can see that a necessary condition to satisfy the foregoing equation is ξ˙ < 0, ie, that ξ is a decaying function
of time.
Another property of the general solution (B1a) is that
N , the total population number, is a free parameter. This
is quite convenient, as it means that

FIG. 7. The derivatives Ṗ and Ḋ for positives (top panel)
and deaths (bottom panel), respectively, obtained from the
data of new daily cases and from the analytical expression of
model B, see Eq. (19), with the parameters fitted to the data,
see Fig. 5. Even though the new daily cases were not used
for the fitting, we see a consistent agreement with the results.
The blue-shaded vertical regions mark the inflection time in
each case as in Fig. 6, whereas the blue-shaded horizontal
regions mark the maximum values of each case. See the text
for more details.

whereas that of susceptibles, from the direct integration
of the equation Ṡ = −ξ(t)I(t), is
S(t) = Si + Ii − I(t) .

(B1b)

Equation (B1b) clearly shows the consistency of the solution as from it one recovers the constraint equation
S + I = Si + Ii = N .
For the case in which β = const., the evolution equation for the susceptibles becomes a constraint equation
for the functional form of ξ(t), namely,
Z t



ξ(x) dx
,
(B2)
ξ(t) = β 1 −

The exact solution of Eq. (B2) exists, and can be obtained from the exact solution of the SI system, see
˙
Eq. (2). Hence, we find from ξ(t) = I/I,
or from a direct
substitution in Eq. (B2), that
h

ξ(t) = β 1 + eβ(t−t0 )

except for the case β = const., for which

(B7)

The reason behind these results is the mechanism that
puts an end to the epidemics. In the case β = const. the
epidemics ends because of the exhaustion of the susceptible population, whereas in any other time-dependent
case it ends because the transmission rate decays. In
the first case we then need to know the total population
beforehand, whereas in the second one that number is
irrelevant as long as I(t) < N .
Moreover, we can calculate the equivalent timedependent transmission rate as
ξ(t) = β(t)S(t)/N = β(t)(1 − I(t)/N ) ,

(B8)

and then ξ(t) → β(t) in the limit N → ∞. Thus, the
solution of the infected population in the same limit can
simply be written as
Z t

I(t) = Ii exp
β(x) dx ,

which is the same functional form as model B in
Sec. III B, see also Eq. (11b).
Appendix C: Fitting to data with the
time-independent SI system

For completeness, we show in this appendix the fitting
to data using the time-independent logistic function (3).

We use the data from Mexico, for a easy comparison with
the results of model A and B in the main text.

deaths are

Figure 8 is a compilation of all results related to model
C. The triangle plot (top left panel) shows the confidence
regions for the free parameters in the model, namely P0 ,
D0 , t0 and tD0 . All parameters are well constrained and
their confidence regions are well defined too. However,
when model C itself is compared directly with data, in
the top right and middle left panels of Fig. 8, we see that
the agreement is not good enough, as in both cases of

cumulative positives and deaths the asymptotic values
are lower than the value of the last data point.
Likewise, in the comparison with new daily cases, in
the middle right panel of Fig. 8, we see that the fit is
not good either, which confirms again that a constant
transmission rate is not appropriate for the complexity
of the data.
Finally, in the bottom panels of Fig. 8 we also compare
the derivative of model C for a direct comparison with
new daily cases. Here we see a clear offset of the predicted
maximum with respect to that of the data, which leads
us to conclude, with all results together, that the simple
logistic function (3) is not appropriate to describe the
evolution of real data from the epidemics of Covid-19.

FIG. 8. (Top left panel) Triangle plot of the fitting to data from Mexico of the parameters P0 , D0 , tP tD and k0 of model C.
All parameters are well constrained by the combination of accumulated confirmed positives and deaths. The resultant evolution
curves of cumulative confirmed positives (top right panel) and deaths (middle left panel), according to model C with the values
of its parameters as shown in the triangle plot. Shown in the figures are the obtained asymptotic values P∞ and D∞ in the top
blue-shaded horizontal regions. The vertical blue-shaded regions mark the inflection time in each case, tP and tD , respectively;
the region for P (tP ) and D(tD ) are also shown for reference. (Middle right panel) The resultant transmission rate β and its
comparison with data. The horizontal red-shaded region represents the obtained value of k0 . (Bottom) The derivatives Ṗ and
Ḋ for positives (left panel) and deaths (right panel), respectively, obtained from the data of new daily cases and from the
analytical expression (2) using the parameters fitted in the triangle plot. The blue-shaded vertical regions mark the inflection
time in each case as in Fig. 8. See the text for more details.
