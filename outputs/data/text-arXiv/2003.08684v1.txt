Abstract
We employ methods largely exploited in Physics, in the analysis of
the evolution of dynamical systems, to study the pattern of the Covid19 infection in Italy. The techniques we employ are based on the use
of logistic function and of its derivative, namely the Hubbert function.
The latter is exploited to give a prediction on the number of infected
per day. We also mention the possibility of taking advantage from other
mathematical tools based e.g. on the Gompertz equation and make some
comparison on the different predictive capabilities.

Introduction

The Covid-19 Pandemia, which is worldwide raging, does not allow the development of multiple strategic defensive scenarios. Viruses are entering the human body, cause an infection and there is no available anti-virus drugs to contrast Covid-19.
The restriction of social contacts is therefore the only (hopefully) efficient
mean to slow down the diffusion of the infectious disease, thus allowing the sanitary structures to operate without the pressure of an emergency stress.
We have therefore asked ourselves whether tools, borrowed from other disciplines, may be exploited as a predictive mean to understand how the number
of Covid-19 infections increases with time, what is the maximum number of
expected infections and when the rate of infections is expected to decrease.
In recent times the point of view, we are going to propose has been exploited
for the understanding of bacterial growth [1] or of other mechanisms mediated

by bacterial growth, such as global biogeochemical cycles [2], human gut health
[3], wastewater treatment [4] or in totally different fields like cancer growth and
metastsys dissemination [5] and in the physics of Free Elecron Laser [6] as well.
In the following we will make use of the logistic function [7] and of its variants [8], to get a reasonable fit of the data provided by the Italian Department of
health1 and develop some previsions. Before getting into the specific details of
the discussion, we give a short resume of the mathematical tools we will employ.

where œÑ is the time, measured in some units to be specified. Furthermore r and
K accounts for the growth rate and the carrying capacity respectively. Regarding bacteria or viruses, K represents the maximum number of individuals
which can be infected. In absence of an ad hoc developed infectious model it
cannot be easily specified (see the concluding section for further comments), it
(and r as well) will be inferred from the ‚Äúexperimental data‚Äù.
The logistic equation provides a good model for the exponential growth and
it does include the so called saturation mechanism leading to the equilibrium,
where the population saturates. It is the solution of the first order non- linear
equation [9]

towards larger œÑ values. We have fixed a threshold value the maximum rate

Logistic Model and Covid-19 Data in Italy

In this section we apply the formalism of the previous section to the analysis of
the behavior of the viral infection in Italy.
The starting point is the number of infected individuals per day, provided
by the Italian Ministry of Health2 . The data are reported in Fig. 4, with the
inclusion of the forecasting of the future trend, which foresees the saturation by
the end of April.
It is evident that the plot in Fig. 4 is essentially the Hubbert curve and
can be derived by a corresponding Logistic curve, as it shown in Figs. 5 where
we have reported the number of infected/day. In 5a we make the comparison
between the present model and that in Fig. 4. To make a correct comparison
we have fitted the logistic function parameter using the data of the first 12 days.

The fit of the logistic function with the available data yields the plot in Fig.
6. It displays the evolution of the infection (number of positive individuals to
Covid 19) vs. the number of days during which the morbidity has developed.
? The zero day, coincides with that in which the number of positive cases
has been started to be officially communicated.
? The green dotted curve represents the evolution of the infected according to the official data, while he red continuous is the logistic fit. The
agreement looks satisfactory.

N0 = 294,

r = 0.2264,

K = 50346.

The conclusions we may draw are that, if we trust this model, the peak of
the number of infected per day should be reached in the next few days and that
a substantive decline could be experienced at the end of April.
It should be noted that being the baricenter of the data shifted towards those
of ‚ÄúRegione Lombardia‚Äù, the extension of the previous conclusions to the rest
of the Nation is not fully justified. In the next days we will presumably observe
the impact of the lockdown restriction and have a better picture of its role on
parameters like the growth rate r.
For further comments see the concluding section.

will be given in the forthcoming section.

Final Comments

The model we have exploited is a simplification in many sense. It does not
include all the elements of the SIR epidemic models of infections [11]. We
considered infected only and we did not include the evolution of healed and
mortality.
The logistic model seems to work in a reasonable way and, if further refined,
may become a predictive tool. We must however underline that a sigmoid
evolution curve and a bell shaped Hubbert form can be derived within different
analytical frameworks. The most attractive alternative is the so called Gompertz
model [8], based on the evolution curve
‚àíŒ≥œÑ

G(œÑ ) = Œ±e‚àíŒ≤ e

.

(9)

The analytical dependence on time is interesting for our purposes because it
displays an exponential term, which simultaneously includes the growth rate
and the saturation. Regarding the meaning of the parameters we note that
G0 = G(0) = Œ±e‚àíŒ≤ ,

lim = Œ±.

œÑ ‚Üí‚àû

(10)

We recognize Œ± as the carrying capacity so that

Œ± = K,

Œ≤ = ‚àí ln

and eventually, with N0 = G0 , we can write Eq. (9) as

N (œÑ ) = G(œÑ ) = K

e‚àíŒ≥œÑ
(12)

If we keep N0 and K the same as those predicted by the Logistic model and
derive Œ≥ from the data, we can evaluate the corresponding Hubbert curve, as
reported in Figs. 6 in which we have made a comparison with the logistic case.
The most remarkable difference is that the Gompertz-Hubbert curve is more
asymmetric and wider than the Logistic counterpart, this behavior seems more
similar to the case reported in Fig. 4 (which is also the result of a computational
model). The drawback is that the two models predict different values of the
peaks which, by using parametrs from Eq. (8), in the case of the logistic is
max(N 0 (œÑ )) = 2850

The conclusions we can draw confirm essentially what we have underscored
in the previous section, with the caveat that the data are referring to the whole
national territory, in which the infection is proceeding in a non homogeneous
way.
Our analysis is strongly influenced by the growth of the disease in Lombardia
(and more in general in the north of Italy). The evolution in the national territory might qualitatively reproduce that reported in Fig. 9, which refers to the
world- wide landscape. The growth of the disease in other regions, owing to the
lockdown, may follow a different pattern. We can foresee a kind of saturation
and then a resurgence at lower increasing rate, if the government prescription
are duly observed. In qualitative terms we may observe the same bi-logistic behavior [12], with China replacing the north of Italy and the superimposed plot
8

yielding the diffusion in the rest of Italy. In a forthcoming note we will analyze
the evolution per individual region.
We must finally stress that the spatial diffusion of the disease, not contained
in the present analysis, requires the use of models including non-linear Fisher
type evolution equations [13, 14], which will be touched in forthcoming studies.

Figure 9: World wide evolution of the disease. The pedestal of the evolution is a logistic
type curve, representing the spread in China. After a certain time lag the epidemy has
propagated in the rest of the world, starting a second logistic behavior (data from Johns
Hopkins CSSE,WHO, CDC, NHC and DINGXIANGYUAN).
