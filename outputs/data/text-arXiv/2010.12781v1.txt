Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic infectious respiratory disease with high mortality and infectiousness. This paper investigates respiratory droplet transmission, which is critical to understanding, modeling and controlling
epidemics. In the present work, we implemented flow visualization, particle image velocimetry (PIV) and particle shadow tracking velocimetry (PSTV) to measure the velocity
of the airflow and droplets involved in coughing and then constructed a physical model
considering the evaporation effect to predict the motion of droplets under different weather
conditions. The experimental results indicate that the convection velocity of cough airflow
presents the relationship t −0.7 with time; hence, the distance from the cougher increases by
t 0.3 in the range of our measurement domain. Substituting these experimental results into
the physical model reveals that the small droplets (initial diameter D ≤ 100 µm) evaporate
to droplet nuclei and that the large droplets with D ≥ 500 µm and initial velocity u0 ≥ 5
m/s travel more than 2 m. Winter conditions of low temperature and high relative humidity
can cause more droplets to settle to the ground, which may be a possible driver of a second
pandemic wave in the autumn and winter seasons.

INTRODUCTION
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has

become a global pandemic infectious respiratory disease. According to the coronavirus resource
center at Johns Hopkins University, more than 30 million people worldwide have been confirmed
to have COVID-19, and there have been more than 1,000,000 deaths globally. Other infectious
respiratory diseases such as flu, tuberculosis, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) still threaten people’s health and life. Understanding the
transmission of pathogens is critical to modelling and controlling epidemics (Bourouiba, Dehandschoewercker, and Bush, 2014). In general, virion-laden respiratory fluid droplets are released
into the environment by infected people through expiratory events such as talking, coughing and
sneezing. There are three possible transmission pathways between infectious and susceptible individuals (Bourouiba, Dehandschoewercker, and Bush, 2014; Huang et al., 2020; Mittal, Ni, and
Seo, 2020): large droplet transmission, contact transmission and airborne transmission. In the
first two pathways, healthy people can be infected by physically inhaling droplets or contacting
contaminated surfaces within close proximity. These two pathways are termed direct short-range
routes of pathogen transmission, as stated by Bourouiba, Dehandschoewercker, and Bush (2014).
Airborne transmission has been suggested to be an additional and important route for respiratory
diseases (Morawska and Milton, 2020; Liu et al., 2020). The microdroplet (or droplet nuclei) generated via small droplet evaporation can travel a very long distance within ambient air (Matthews
et al., 1989; Dbouk and Drikakis, 2020a). Liu et al. (2020) investigated the aerodynamic nature
of SARS-CoV-2 by measuring the viral ribose nucleic acid (RNA) in aerosols in different areas of
two Wuhan hospitals during the outbreak of COVID-19. The aerosols concentrations of SARSCoV-2 were much higher in the toilet used by patients with COVID-19 and in areas where crowds
that included infected individuals gathered. They proposed that SARS-CoV-2 may be transmitted
through aerosols.
Coughing, which can generate droplets and droplet nuclei, is a typical symptom of COVID19. These virion-laden respiratory fluid droplets are expelled into the environment by powerful
air flow during coughing. Measuring the air velocity, droplet number density, velocity and size
distribution are critical to understanding and modeling virus transmission. Zhu, Kato, and Yang
(2006) investigated the transport characteristics of saliva droplets produced by coughing in a calm
2

indoor environment via particle image velocimetry (PIV) experiments and numerical simulation.
The PIV results indicated that the initial velocity of cough airflow is as high as 22 m/s with an
average velocity of 11.2 m/s. Numerical analyses that did not consider evaporation indicated that
droplets smaller than 30 µm in diameter are mostly transported with the airflow, droplets with
diameters of 50-200 µm are significantly affected by gravity, and droplets of 300 µm or larger
are mostly affected by inertia. Gupta, Lin, and Chen (2009) measured the flow rate, flow direction and mouth opening area for 25 human subjects and found that the flow rate of a cough as
a function of time can be defined as a combination of gamma-probability-distribution functions.
Xie et al. (2009) carried out a series of experiments to measure the number and size of respiratory
droplets produced by talking and coughing. The distribution of the droplet diameter at the origin
was given in their paper. To predict the trajectory and settling speed of droplets, a discrete fallout
model and a continuous fallout model were developed based on the theory of multiphase turbulent
buoyant clouds by Bourouiba, Dehandschoewercker, and Bush (2014). These models can be used
with clinical data to yield better estimations of the range of airborne respiratory disease transmission. The influence of environmental conditions on droplet transmission was investigated using a
three-dimensional numerical simulation by Dbouk and Drikakis (2020a). It was found that saliva
droplets can travel up to 6 m, which is much further than the 2 m social distance metric, when the
wind speed varies from 4 km/h to 15 km/h.
Wearing face masks is a fundamental and efficient protection against virus transmission. The
Schlieren optical method was applied to visualize cough airflow with and without standard surgical and N95 masks (Tang et al., 2009). The results indicated that human coughing produces a
rapid turbulent jet into the surrounding air and that a mask can block the formation of this jet.
David et al. (2012) used flow visualization to investigate the expelled air dispersion distances
during coughing with a human patient simulator with and without a surgical mask or N95 mask
in a negative pressure isolation room. The turbulent jet caused by coughing without a mask can
propagate close to 0.7 m, while the air dispersion distance is approximately 0.15 m with an N95
mask. To clarify whether masks can offer effective protection against droplet infection, Kähler
and Hain (2020) conducted three experiments of fluid mechanics to analyze the blockage caused
by masks, to determine the effectiveness of different filter materials and masks, and to verify the
effects of leakage flows at the edges of masks. The effectiveness and leakage of face masks were
qualitatively visualized by Verma, Dhanak, and Frankenfield (2020) using smoke. Wearing masks
can significantly curtail the speed and range of respiratory jets. Dbouk and Drikakis (2020b) used
3

multiphase computational fluid dynamics in a fully coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian framework to
investigate the droplet dynamics of mild coughing. This numerical results showed that a mask can
reduce airborne droplet transmission. However, some droplets still spread around and away from
the mask.
As stated by Asadi et al. (2020), virologists and epidemiologists are racing to understand
COVID-19 and how best to treat it. Many unknowns remain, but one thing is eminently clear:
COVID-19 is both deadly and highly transmissible. In addition to direct large droplet transmission and contact transmission, airborne transmission is a potential important pathway, especially
in an enclosed small space (Asadi et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020). Therefore, investigation of the
generation and evolution of expiratory activities such as breathing, talking, coughing and sneezing,
which can produce virion-laden droplets and aerosols traveling with the airflow, is very significant
(Mittal, Ni, and Seo, 2020). Regarding coughing, which is the main symptom of COVID-19, most
studies include qualitative visualization without dynamic analysis. In the present work, we use a
high-speed PIV system to capture the spatial-temporal evolution of coughing (He, Rubinstein, and
Wang, 2002; Zhao and He, 2009; He, Jin, and Yang, 2017). We carried out three optics-based
fluid experiments. First, we analyzed large-scale visualization images generated using cigarette
smoke Gupta, Lin, and Chen (2009). Second, we used the PIV technique to calculate the airflow
velocity near the mouth and analyzed the time-resolved flow fields. Third, we used particle shadow
velocimetry (Estevadeordal and Goss; Hessenkemper and Ziegenhein (2018), PSV) to track the
trajectories of large droplets and analyzed the velocity distribution of the droplets. Finally, we
constructed a model to consider the evaporation and motion of a droplet and analyzed the influence of weather conditions on droplet transmission. The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
In Sec. II, we first introduce the experimental facility, setup and data processing methods used in
this work. In Sec. III, we present the results and discussion in accordance with these experiments.
Finally, we offer conclusions in Sec. IV.

shared opening of 60 mm × 60 mm was mounted at the end of the tube to block the laser and
protect the volunteers. The length, width and height of the tube were 1000 mm, 300 mm and
300 mm, respectively. When conducting the experiment, volunteers were asked to sit in front
of the opaque plate and place their mouths as close as possible to the opening, and the exhaled
airflow or droplets passed into the testing room through this opening. Additionally, volunteers
were asked to wear safety goggles to protect their eyes. As stated in the introduction section, three
kinds of experiments for different objectives were performed in this work. Each experiment was
carried out by four healthy male volunteers, and each volunteer repeated three times. The detailed
experimental configurations are listed in Tab. I and are introduced in the next sections.

Coughing visualization
The coughing was visualized using cigarette smoke recorded by a high-speed Photron camera

(FastcamSA2/86K-M3). The volunteer drew heavily on his cigarette and coughed out a cloud of
smoke as naturally as possible. The diameters of cigarette smoke particles are mostly distributed
in the submicron size range, i.e., 0.01–1 µm, as reported by Sahu et al. (2013). A continuous laser
sheet with a thickness of approximately 1 mm at a power of 9 W was used to illuminate the smoke.
Images with a resolution of 1280×1024 pixels2 were recorded at 1000 frames per second (fps). A
high-speed camera with a 50 mm F1.4 lens was placed approximately 1 m from the measurement
domain, and this configuration yielded a field of view (FOV) of approximately 0.32×0.26 m2 .

C.

Particle image velocimetry
The velocity field near the mouth was estimated using the PIV technique. We still used a con-

tinuous laser sheet at a power of 9 W to illuminate the cigarette smoke exhaled during coughing.
Different from the coughing visualization, the smoke images were acquired at a very high sampling frequency of 10000 Hz due to the high velocity of the flow near the mouth. Limited by the
transfer bandwidth of the camera, the image resolution was reduced to 320×256 pixels2 . The distance of the camera from the measurement domain was approximately 1.0 m, and a 50 mm F1.4
camera lens was used in this experiment. The size of the FOV was approximately 0.08×0.06 m2 .
The velocity fields were estimated using in-house PIV software with a three-pass window deformation iterative multigrid scheme (WIDIM) (Scarano, 2002). Before the velocity estimation,
the particle images were preprocessed using a Gaussian filter for image denoising. The interrogation window (IW) size used for the first pass was 48×48 pixels2 , and the IW size of the final
pass was set to 32×32 pixels2 . The interval of the adjacent vectors was set to 2 pixels to increase
the number of vectors. The cross-correlation map was calculated using a fast Fourier transform
(FFT)-based approach, and the subpixel displacement was obtained by three-point Gaussian fitting. Outliers in the PIV fields were detected using the normalized median test proposed by Westerweel and Scarano (2005), and the missing vectors were filled using linear interpolation. The
final velocity fields were smoothed by average filtering with dimensions of 3×3 to further reduce
the measurement noise.

Particle shadow tracking velocimetry

This experiment was performed to investigate the velocity of saliva droplets during coughing.
To capture a clear droplet shape and track the trajectories, the PSV method was adopted. The
flow region was illuminated using a high-power LED backlight, as shown in Fig. 1, instead of the
laser sheet used in the smoke visualization and velocimetry. Additionally, a small depth of focus
(DoF) corresponding to a small value of lens aperture was used to generate a thin volume where
the droplets can be clearly identified. There were no droplets captured by our camera for dry
coughing; therefore, the volunteer drank some water to moisten their throat and kept little water
in their mouth. The remaining water in their mouth was driven by the pressure of coughing and
generated many droplets due to hydrodynamic instability (Scharfman et al., 2016; Mittal, Ni, and
Seo, 2020). A camera with a 105 mm F2.4 lens was placed 0.4 m from the measurement domain.
Images with a resolution of 800×400 pixels2 were recorded at a frequency of 5000 Hz, and the
exposure time was 1/8000 seconds. The FOV size was 0.028×0.014 m2 .
Many droplets of different sizes were ejected from the volunteer’s mouth during coughing,
and only the droplets located in the region of the DoF were in focus in the images. To estimate
a droplet’s velocity, the location of the droplet had to be detected first. Segmentation methods
based on a gray-level or gradient threshold are not appropriate for the droplets because of the
intensity variation with the size of the droplets and the refraction of irregular shapes. Additionally,
the presence of blurred droplets can locally modify the background around the in-focus droplets
(Castanet et al., 2013). In the present work, the processes for droplet detection are given in Fig.
2 as follows. First, the original image (Fig. 2 (a)) was processed using the Laplacian of the
Gaussian (LoG) method to obtain the intermediate image L (Fig. 2 (b)) as proposed by Castanet
et al. (2013). The droplet is in the region where the Laplacian is negative. The Gaussian filter
size is 7×7 pixels2 . Second, the connected regions of image L were computed, corresponding
to L ≤ Lmax . To accurately determine the edges of the droplets, pixels with a negative Laplacian
value (−0.5 was adopted in practice considering image noise) were connected with the region of
L ≤ Lmax to generate a complete droplet. The value of Lmax was set to −10 in this study, and then
regions that were too large or too small were excluded. Figure 2 (c) shows the resulting region of
connection. Third, a contour operation was applied to the binary image of the connected regions
to find the edge of the droplets (Castanet et al., 2013), and the geometric center of this region was
calculated as the location of the droplet. As shown in Fig. 2 (d), the gray contour lines present

good agreement with the edges of droplets, and the red dots represent the locations of the droplets.
Note that a few droplets present a crescent shape due to light refraction.
After droplet detection, the velocity of the droplets is determined using the noniterative doubleframe particle tracking velocimetry (PTV) proposed by Fuchs, Hain, and Kähler (2017). The combination of particle shadow images and PTV is referred to as particle shadow tracking velocimetry
(PSTV) (Hessenkemper and Ziegenhein, 2018). We did not track the trajectories of the droplets
because the measurement domain in the x direction is as short as 400 pixels. Figure 3 gives an
example of the velocity vectors of the droplets obtained using PSTV; the minimum and maximum
droplet velocities are 5.0 m/s and 10.0 m/s, respectively.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Convection velocity from visualization

The coughing process is visualized by the expelling of smoke. Figure 4 shows the evolution of
a cough at a time interval of 0.02 s. The onset of coughing is determined by visually inspecting
the image sequence. The red rectangles indicate regions with high gray levels, corresponding to
concentrated smoke. The distance s is defined as the distance from the left origin to the right
border of the rectangle, and w denotes the width of the rectangles. At the beginning of coughing,
the ejected smoke presents a cone-like shape and a high concentration and then rapidly transitions
into turbulence. With the entraining of the ambient quiescent air, the cough smoke is gradually

decelerated and reaches the right border of the FOV (approximately 0.3 m) at approximately 0.1
s.
The convection velocity Uc and distance s as a function of time t averaged over 11 cases (one
case is excluded because of unreliable data) are presented in Fig. 5. In this work, the convection
velocity is defined as Uc = ds/dt and computed using a central difference. The open gray squares,
dashed lines and solid lines represent the original experimental data, smoothed data and fitted
data, respectively. The convection velocity Uc presents a peak value of approximately 6 m/s at t p
= 0.0124 s. To fit the curve of s, we consider Uc to be a piecewise function: Uc holds a constant
value of 6.48 m/s for t < t p and then decreases as Uc = 0.3t −0.7 for t ≥ t p . The distance s can be
integrated as s =

Rt

0 Uc dt;

hence, s ∼ t 0.3 at t ≥ t p . This result is different from that of Bourouiba,

Dehandschoewercker, and Bush (2014), who stated that s is related to t by s ∼ t 0.5 in the first
phase, which is dominated by jet-like dynamics. We believe that s varies as t 0.3 because a cough is
a pluse-like jet and not a continuous jet. In accordance with the fitting functions, the relationship
between Uc and s can be expressed as:

Uc =

This equation is used to model the motion of cough airflow in Sec. III D. If we do not consider the
temperature of the exhaled airflow and we assume that the indoor airflow velocity is approximately

FIG. 4. Convection of smoke expelled by coughing. The image sequence shows a cough at intervals of 0.02
s. The red rectangles indicate the regions with higher gray levels, corresponding to concentrated smoke.
The distance s is defined as the distance from the left origin to the right border of the rectangle, and w is the
width of the box, as shown in the image of t=0.041 s.

0.3 m/s on average (Gong et al., 2006), the airflow exhaled by coughing can be calculated to travel
approximately 0.8 m from the mouth by substituting 0.3 m/s into the formulas in Fig. 5. Wearing
masks and maintaining social distance are important for preventing airborne transmission.
The dependence of the width w on the distance s is illustrated in Fig. 5 (b). It can be seen from
this figure that w increases linearly as s increases. The fitted function is written as w = αs + β ,
where α = 0.523 and β = 0.0088. The α reported by Bourouiba, Dehandschoewercker, and Bush
(2014) is 0.22, which is much smaller than the value obtained from our experiments. The linear
relationship between s and w implies the self-similar growth of the cough jet.

B.

Flow dynamics of the airflow
The near-mouth velocity fields were estimated from the smoke cough using PIV. All 12 cases

are averaged corresponding to the time to remove outliers and noise. The time t = 0 s is assigned to
when the smoke has just moved into the measurement domain. Only 800 velocity fields (approx10

imately 0.08 s) are considered because the smoke gradually diffuses to a low gray level. Figure 6
shows the averaged velocity fields from t = 0 s to 0.01 s at a time interval of 0.002 s. The origin of
the coordinates is adjusted in accordance with the position of the mouth. At t = 0 s, the velocity
of released smoke u0 is approximately 4.0 m/s. Gupta, Lin, and Chen (2009) experimentally estimated that the mouth opening area of male subjects is approximately 4.00±0.95 cm2 . Therefore,
the Reynolds number Re = u0 d/ν is approximately 5757, where d = 0.023 m represents the diameter of the mouth when coughing and ν is the kinematic viscosity of air at a temperature of 30◦ C.
From the visual inspection of the velocity fields and the smoke images, the axis evolution of the
cough jet presents strong turbulence characteristics due to entrainment and diffusion.
The velocity at position (x, y) = (0.02, 0) as a function of time is presented in Fig. 7 (a). The
initial velocity at t = 0 s is approximately 4.0 m/s and then rapidly increases to 15.0 m/s at t =
0.03 s. The velocity gradually reduces to 4.0 m/s at time t = 0.08 s. The variation in the velocity
qualitatively agrees with the results given by Gupta, Lin, and Chen (2009), Dudalski et al. (2020)
and Kwon et al. (2012). However, Dudalski et al. (2020) reported that the peak velocity value
is approximately 22.0 m/s at t = 0.068 s, which is different from the present result. A potential
reason for the difference is that the position of the mouth and the onset time of coughing are
slightly different among the volunteers in our experiments. These uncertainties are difficult to
avoid under the current experimental conditions.

distance corresponding to half of umax (Krishnan and Mohseni, 2010; Xu, Feng, and Wang, 2013;
Xu et al., 2018). In this figure, a hyperbolic cosine function u/umax = cosh−2 (y/b1/2 ) that is used
to describe the velocity profiles of synthetic jets (Zhang and Wang, 2007; Xu, Feng, and Wang,
2013; Xu et al., 2018) is given for comparison. The normalized velocity profiles agree well with
the blue curve when y/b1/2 ≤ 0, while velocity when y/b1/2 > 0 is higher than the blue curve.
This asymmetric axial velocity profile may be due to two possible reasons. First, the temperature
of the expelled airflow is higher than that of the outside environment, which can cause the airflow
to be driven by buoyancy (Bourouiba, Dehandschoewercker, and Bush, 2014). In our opinion, this
is the primary reason. Second, the number of samples is still not high enough to obtain converged
results.
The cough jet interacts with the surrounding air via flow entrainment, which can be viewed as
a combination of small-scale nibbling plus a large-scale engulfment and induced inflow (Philip
and Marusic, 2012). The entrainment of a cough is qualitatively stronger than that of a continuous
turbulent jet or synthetic jet because of the variation in the mouth position and flow direction.
Figure 8 (a) shows the flow rate Q as a function of time t and axial position x. The flow rate Q is
roughly estimated as:
Z +∞

Q=π

u|r|dr,

−∞

where we assume that the cough jet is axisymmetric and |r| is the absolute value of the radial
location. The white triangle in the lower right of this figure indicates that the jet spreads from x
= 0.02 m to x = 0.0635 m within 0.007 s, implying that the initial convection velocity is approximately 6.2 m/s. This value agrees with the result in Fig. 5 obtained using flow visualization (6.48
m/s). Taking the axial location x = 0.04 m as an example, the flow rate Q first increases and then
decreases with time t. This trend qualitatively agrees with the typical flow generated from a cough
over time given by Gupta, Lin, and Chen (2009). The time-averaged Q from t = 0.01 s to 0.07
s is presented in Fig. 8 (b). It is obvious that the flow rate Q increases with the axial position.
The entrainment can be estimated from the axial derivative of Q as dQ/dx, and the increase in Q
implies that the jet can entrain the ambient air. However, it is difficult to quantize the entrainment
effect of coughing in the limited measurement domain of the data.

Velocity of the large droplets
As introduced in Sec. II D, the velocity of saliva droplets is estimated using PSTV. There are 12

cases overall. The onset of coughing is visually determined as when the droplets just begin to enter
the measurement domain. Because the domain is as small as approximately 1.4 cm × 2.8 cm, the
velocity of the droplets is averaged over the domain and cases, and the result is presented in Fig.
9 (a). At the beginning (t = 0 s), the velocity of the droplets is approximately 9.0 m/s; the velocity
has reduced to 6.2 m/s at t = 0.005 s. After t = 0.005 s, the velocity of the droplets presents
large fluctuations around the mean value of 6.2 m/s. This large deviation may be caused by an
insufficient number of particles, as shown in Fig. 9 (b). Because the camera used cannot resolve
smaller droplets, the maximum number of detected droplets in the domain is approximately 15
and decreases to approximately 3 droplets after t = 0.01 s.
We also consider the joint probability density function (PDF) of the droplet velocity and diameter, as shown in Fig. 10. This joint PDF is counted over t = 0 s to t = 0.02 s for all cases. The
droplet diameter is estimated from the equivalent area of the identified droplets. The minimum
diameter is approximately 250 µm, which is 7 pixels in accordance with the image resolution of
34.6 µm/pixel. Therefore, we only measure the velocities of the large droplets. Most of the droplet
velocities are distributed in the range of 4-8 m/s. The width of the velocity distribution increases

the airflow. The velocity of the larger droplets is approximately 6.0 m/s.

Physical model of the droplet movement
We consider a saliva droplet as a pure water sphere with diameter D. According to Newton’s

second law of motion, the evolution of the saliva droplet’s velocity can be calculated as:
md

dud
= Fg + Fa ,
dt

(3)

where md and ud are the mass and velocity vectors of the droplet, respectively. The mass md is

denotes the air drag force. In the CFD analysis of Zhu, Kato, and Yang (2006), the pressure force

is also considered. However, this term is ignored in Eq. 3 because an accurate pressure field is
difficult to obtain in our experiments. The forces Fg and Fa are given as:

where µa is the dynamic viscosity of the air. If the location of the droplet is in the region of the
cough airflow, the velocity ua is given as Eq. 1. Otherwise, the velocity ua is set to zero for still
ambient air. Eqs. 4, 5, 6 and 1 are substituted into Eq. 3 to calculate the velocity and trajectory of
the droplets.
When a respiratory droplet is expelled into the air, the physical processes of mass transfer and
heat transfer are simultaneously generated at the droplet surface (Kukkonen, Vesala, and Kulmala,
1989; Xie et al., 2007). Mass reduction due to evaporation has a significant influence on the
velocity and trajectory of small droplets. The rate of decrease in the diameter D of a spherical
drop in air due to evaporation is expressed as (Kukkonen, Vesala, and Kulmala, 1989; Holterman,

800 µm (a) without considering the cough airflow and evaporation effect, (b) considering the cough airflow
and the evaporation effect.

The estimation of D∞ , Tw and psat and the validation of this model are given in detail in Sec. A of
the appendix. In the present work, the temperature and relative humidity of the cough airflow are
Tcough = 34◦ C and RHcough = 85%, and these values for ambient air are Tair = 23◦ C and RHair =
50% (Bourouiba, Dehandschoewercker, and Bush, 2014). The height of mouth from the ground is
set to 1.8 m. The calculation is performed until the diameter is less than 5 µm. The temperature
variation of the droplet is neglected in this work.
Figure 11 displays the trajectories of droplets at the five different diameters of D = 30 µm, 80
µm, 200 µm, 400 µm, 800 µm. The simulated results considering the cough airflow and evaporation are shown in Fig. 11 (b). For comparison, only gravity and the drag force are considered
in Fig. 11 (a). The initial horizontal velocity of the droplets is 6 m/s. It can be seen from Fig. 11
(a) that the horizontal velocity rapidly decreases to zero for the small droplet due to its relatively
high viscosity. All the droplets fall to the ground, and the distance from the cougher at which this
occurs x increases with increasing diameter. However, considering the real physical process, there
are three different types of trajectories, as shown in Fig. 11 (b). First, the trajectory for a droplet
of D = 30 µm stops in the region of the cough airflow, which is denoted region A. The diameter
of this droplet deceases to 5 µm due to evaporation. Second, the trajectory for a droplet of D =
80 µm stops in the region of ambient air, which is denoted region B. Third, droplets with larger
diameters of D = 200 µm, 400 µm and 800 µm fall to the ground before evaporating to droplet
nuclei. Moreover, the droplets in Fig. 11 (b) travel longer distances than those in Fig. 11 (a).
17

Taking D = 200 µm as an example, the cough airflow can increase the distance from 0.25 m to 0.7
m.
The evaporation time and falling time as a function of the droplet diameter and initial velocity
are presented in Fig. 12 (a). There are two dashed lines in this figure: the black line represents the
dividing line between droplets that fall to the ground and those that evaporate to droplet nuclei, and
the red line represents the dividing line between the droplets that evaporate in region A and those
that evaporate in region B. With our parameter settings, droplets larger than the critical droplet
size D ≈ 100 µm are deposited on the ground before evaporating to a small droplet of D = 5 µm.
This critical droplet size is consistent with the results given by Wells (1955) and Xie et al. (2007).
The second critical size indicated by the red dashed line is approximately 50 µm, where droplets
smaller than this size evaporate to droplet nuclei in region A (cough airflow). The droplets with
diameters of 50 ∼ 100 µm evaporate in region B (ambient air). These droplet nuclei are suspended
in the air and travel with the movement of the air. In particular, the droplets in region A are easier
for people of the same height to inhale; therefore, these droplets pose a higher probability of
infection. Moreover, the initial velocity of the droplets u0 has a negligible influence on the time.
The horizontal distance covered as a droplet evaporates to a small droplet or falls to the ground
is displayed in Fig. 12 (b). The contour line of x = 2 m is indicated by a black arrow. The
contour map above the black dashed line represents the distance at which the droplet falls to the
ground, and the contour map lower the back dashed line represents the distance traveled before
evaporation. The practical distance of the droplets with D ≤ 100 µm is hard to predict because of
the long-range airborne transmission. In addition to the small droplets, the droplets with D ≥ 500
µm and u0 ≥ 5 m/s can travel further than 2 m, as shown in Fig. 12 (b). A social distance of 2
m cannot completely eliminate the possibility of infection; thus, wearing a mask is a simple and
direct way to stop the spread of droplets.
With this model, we can investigate the effects of weather conditions on the evaporation of
coughed droplets. Measurements including the seasonal variations in the temperature and relative
humidity of indoor and outdoor conditions are given by Frankel et al. (2012). The median values
of the temperature and relative humidity measured during summer and winter are listed in Tab. II.
Substituting these parameters into our model, we can obtain the evaporation-falling time curves of
the droplets under different weather conditions. The results for an initial droplet velocity of 6 m/s
are shown in Fig. 13. The curves of the summer-outdoor, summer-indoor and winter-indoor areas
almost overlap each other due to their similar temperatures and relative humidities. However, for

between the droplets that evaporate in region A and those that evaporate in region B is denoted by a red

winter-outdoor conditions, droplets with initial diameters larger than 50 µm evaporate slowly and
deposit on the ground before drying. Additionally, the settling time of droplets with diameters of
50 ∼ 100 µm is much longer than those of the other three cases. If we consider the effect of condensation in winter, more large droplets are slowly settling to the ground in these conditions. This
finding indicates that low temperature and high relative humidity may significantly increase the
possibility of large droplet transmission and contact transmission, which may be a potential reason
for a second pandemic wave in the autumn and winter seasons (Dbouk and Drikakis, 2020c).

CONCLUSIONS
In the present work, the motion of saliva droplets produced by coughing was investigated

through experiments and theoretical analysis.
Three different types of experiments, including flow visualization, PIV and PSTV, were performed to experimentally investigate the transport characteristics of coughing. For the flow visualization and PIV, image sequences of cigarette smoke expelled by healthy adult male volunteers
were recorded using a high-speed camera. For the PSTV, large droplets were recorded using a
shadow imaging technique, and the velocity and diameter of these droplets were extracted from
the images by tracking the motion of the droplets. Our key findings from the experiments are as
follows. First, the visualization shows that the cough jet interacts with the ambient air via flow
entrainment, which leads to increasing size and decreasing velocity with increasing distance from
the cougher (Bourouiba, Dehandschoewercker, and Bush, 2014). Further quantitative analysis indicates that the convection velocity of the cough airflow presents the relationship t −0.7 with time;
hence, the distance from the cougher increases as t 0.3 in the range of our measurement domain.
The dependence of the distance s on time t is different from the relationship s ∼ t 0.5 that was obtained by considering a cough as a continuous jet by Bourouiba, Dehandschoewercker, and Bush
(2014). The width of the cough airflow evolves linearly as the distance increases. Second, the normalized mean velocity profiles agrees well with that of a synthetic jet in the region y/b1/2 ≤ 0 and
is higher than that of a synthetic jet in the region y/b1/2 > 0, mainly due to the buoyancy driven by
the relatively high temperature of a cough. The maximum airflow can reach 15.0 m/s. Third, the
20

measured minimum diameter is approximately 250 µm due to the limitations of our experimental
hardware. The mean velocity of the droplets is approximately 6.0 m/s, and smaller droplets are
more susceptible to cough airflow.
With these experimental results, a physical model considering the evaporation effect was built
to predict the movement of droplets under different environmental conditions (temperature and
relative humidity). Our findings indicate that there are two critical sizes for the expelled droplets.
The first critical droplet size, where droplets larger than this size fall to the ground or otherwise
evaporate to droplet nuclei, is approximately 100 µm. The second critical droplet size, which
distinguishes droplet evaporation in the region of cough airflow from that in the region of ambient
air, is approximately 50 µm. Droplets smaller than 50 µm are easier for people of the same height
to inhale, resulting in a higher probability of infection. Additionally, both the small droplets (initial
diameter D ≤ 100 µm) evaporating to droplet nuclei and the large droplets with D ≥ 500 µm and
initial velocity u0 ≥ 5 m/s can travel more than the social distance of 2 m. With this model, we
also investigated the effects of weather conditions on the evaporation of cough droplets. Winter
conditions, with low temperature and high relative humidity, can result in more droplets settling to
the ground, which may be a possible driver of a second pandemic wave in the autumn and winter
seasons.
Our study visualizes and analyzes the cough process using techniques of experimental fluid
mechanics, and the theoretical results reinforce the importance of maintaining social distance and
wearing masks to stem the spread of viruses. We should take precautions against a second COVID19 wave due to the winter conditions of low temperature and high relative humidity. A potential
future study is to build a relationship between pandemic evolution and the motion of respiratory
droplets to accurately predict the infection rate and range for the population.

Appendix A: The evaporation model
A schematic representation of droplet evaporation is shown in Fig. 14. In this figure, the open
and solid circles represent air and vapor, respectively. The ambient air temperature and relative
humidity are denoted by T∞ and RH, respectively. The molecules in the droplet are bound to their
neighbors by intermolecular forces; however, the liquid molecules at the interface are more weakly
bounded to their neighbors than those inside the liquid due to having fewer adjacent molecules
(Holterman, 2003). Therefore, some molecules with relatively high kinetic energy escape from
the droplet into the air, and a very thin evaporating film with a saturated vapor is generated at the
interface between the droplet and air. Because escaped molecules can absorb heat, the droplet’s
temperature Tw is lower than the temperature of the ambient air T∞ . In this work, we ignore the
variation in the temperature of the droplet and assume that the final droplet temperature is the
22

wet-bulb temperature, which can be described by a linear relation with T∞ and quadratic relation
with relative humidity RH as (Holterman, 2003):


Tw = T∞ − (a0 + a1 T∞ ) + (b0 + b1 T∞ ) RH + (c0 + c1 T∞ ) RH 2 ,
a0 = 5.1055

a1 = 0.4295,

b0 = −0.04703

(A1)

b1 = −0.005951,

c0 = −4.005 × 10−5

c1 = 1.660 × 10−5 .

At 100% relative humidity, the wet-bulb temperature Tw is equal to the air temperature T∞ (drybulb temperature).
If the air is saturated with the water vapor, the partial vapor pressure is defined as the saturated
vapor pressure psat . psat is strongly dependent on the temperature, and an empirical equation is
given as (Holterman, 2003):
psat = 610.7 × 107.5T /(T +237.3) .

(A2)

The above equation is valid for temperatures of 0◦ C up to approximately 100◦ C.
The dependence of the diffusion coefficient D∞ of water in air on the temperature is given by
Holterman (2003) as:
D∞ = 21.2 × 10−6 (1 + 0.0071T∞ ).

(A3)

The validity of the present model is first examined by comparing the diameter evolution of
motionless droplets with the experimental results given by Chaudhuri et al. (2020) (Fig. 15 (a)).
A motionless droplet is allowed to evaporate under ambient conditions at T∞ = 30◦ C and RH =
50%. The diameter variations as a function of time for two different initial diameters D0 are
shown in Fig. 15 (a). The solid curves estimated by the present model qualitatively agree with the
experimental results. We also compare the evaporation-falling time of the present model with the
result extracted from the paper by Xie et al. (2007). The droplet is released at a height of 2 m, and
the ambient temperature T∞ and relative humidity RH are 18◦ C and 0%, respectively. As shown
in Fig. 15 (b), the curve estimated by the present model agrees well with the result of Xie et al.
(2007). Droplets smaller than 125 µm totally evaporate before reaching the ground. With these
comparisons, we can conclude that the model used in this work can describe the evaporation and
motion of a droplet.
