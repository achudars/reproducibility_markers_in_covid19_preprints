Abstract
Background: COVID-19 has affected more than 200 countries and territories worldwide. It
poses an extraordinary challenge for public health systems, because screening and surveillance
capacity—especially during the beginning of the outbreak—is often severely limited, fueling the
outbreak as many patients unknowingly infect others.
Objective: We present an effort to collect and analyze COVID-19 related posts on the popular
Twitter-like social media site in China, Weibo. To our knowledge, this infoveillance study
employs the largest, most comprehensive and fine-grained social media data to date to predict
COVID-19 case counts in mainland China.
Methods: We built a Weibo user pool of 250 million, approximately half of the entire monthly
active Weibo user population. Using a comprehensive list of 167 keywords, we retrieved and
analyzed around 15 million COVID-19 related posts from our user pool, from November 1, 2019
to March 31, 2020. We developed a machine learning classifier to identify “sick posts,” which
are reports of one’s own and other people’s symptoms and diagnosis related to COVID-19.
Using officially reported case counts as the outcome, we then estimated the Granger causality of
sick posts and other COVID-19 posts on daily case counts. For a subset of geotagged posts
(3.10% of all retrieved posts), we also ran separate predictive models for Hubei province, the
epicenter of the initial outbreak, and the rest of mainland China.
Results: We found that reports of symptoms and diagnosis of COVID-19 significantly predicted
daily case counts, up to 14 days ahead of official statistics. But other COVID-19 posts did not

2
have similar predictive power. For the subset of geotagged posts, we found that the predictive
pattern held true for both Hubei province and the rest of mainland China, regardless of unequal
distribution of healthcare resources and outbreak timeline.
Conclusions: Public social media data can be usefully harnessed to predict infection cases and
inform timely responses. Researchers and disease control agencies should pay close attention to
the social media infosphere regarding COVID-19. On top of monitoring overall search and
posting activities, leveraging machine learning approaches and theoretical understandings of
information sharing behaviors to identify true disease signals is a promising approach to
improve the effectiveness of infoveillance.

Introduction
Since the outbreak of COVID-19 in December, 2019, in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China
[1, 2], the novel coronavirus has already affected more than 200 countries and territories
worldwide. As of May 16, 2020, there were more than 4 million confirmed cases and over
300,000 deaths [3]. Amid many unknowns, severe lack of laboratory testing capacity, delays in
case reports, variations in local COVID-19 responses, and uncoordinated communication pose
tremendous challenges for monitoring the epidemic dynamics and developing policies and
targeted interventions for resource allocation.
When conventional disease surveillance capacity is limited, publicly available social
media and Internet data can play a crucial role in uncovering hidden dynamics of an emerging
outbreak [4]. Research in digital disease surveillance, also referred to as infoveillance or
infodemiology, has shown great promise that Internet data can be usefully employed to track the
real-time development of public attention, sentiment and health [5-8]. Specifically, data based on
Internet searches and social media activities could nowcast and forecast disease prevalence as a
supplement to conventional surveillance methods for various infectious diseases [5-7, 9-14].
One of the most well-known examples of digital disease surveillance is the case of
Google Flu Trends, which used real-time Google search terms to predict clinical incidence rates
of influenza with great initial success [13, 14]. Social media data such as Twitter were also
shown to be effective in predicting and tracking various epidemics, such as influenza [10, 12]
and Zika [15], with varying degrees of success. Yet, digital surveillance data also present unique
challenges. For example, after its release in 2008, Google Flu Trends became less accurate over
time, consistently overestimating flu prevalence during 2011-2013. The prediction error was
partially attributed to people’s changing search behaviors as well as increased public attention to
the epidemic itself, which fueled awareness-related search queries with little to do with disease
incidence [7, 16]. Compared to aggregated search queries, user-generated social media data have
the advantage of being more direct and granular, allowing researchers to mine specific content to
reflect actual illness. Still, media attention to emerging diseases can fuel social media activities,
resulting in a deluge of discussions that dilute true disease signals on actual infection cases,
making predictions less accurate [12].
The unprecedented magnitude and transmission speed of COVID-19 brought about
massive social media activities as people isolate in their homes to break the infection chains [17].
Massive social media data inevitably contain massive noise (e.g., public reactions and awareness
of the disease), which can be counterproductive for disease forecasting. A few early
infoveillance studies have tracked public discussion of COVID-19 and patient characteristics on
Weibo, the most popular public social media site in China [18-21]. Two studies suggest that
COVID-19 related Weibo posts and search queries can be used to predict disease prevalence [19,
22]. However, they relied upon coarse-grained social media data and/or query data based on a

4
few keywords with a short time window at the onset of the outbreak [19, 22]. As such, these
studies’ predictive accuracy and result interpretability are limited by the same pitfalls of
infoveillance studies mentioned above. There are many reasons to search and discuss COVID-19
on social media, especially as the disease received substantial media coverage and most of the
country was under mandatory lockdown. To more accurately predict infection cases and inform a
rapid response, it is therefore critical to use granular and specific social media data to identify
reliable disease signals (i.e., sick posts reporting symptoms and diagnosis).
Here we present an infoveillance effort to collect and analyze COVID-19 related posts on
Weibo, and to identify specific type of Weibo posts that can predict COVID-19 case counts in
mainland China. To our knowledge, this study collects the largest, most comprehensive and
granular social media data related to COVID-19 in the Chinese language, far exceeding the scale,
granularity and time span of similar studies [19, 22]. We built a Weibo user pool of 250 million,
approximately half of the active Weibo user population [23]. Using a comprehensive list of 167
keywords associated with COVID-19, we retrieved around 15 million social media posts from
November 1st, 2019 to March 31st, 2020. With much increased data granularity, we developed a
supervised machine-learning classifier to distinguish “sick posts,” which are reports of own and
others’ symptoms or diagnosis, from other COVID-19 related posts that could dilute disease
signals from the data stream. Using the officially reported case accounts as the outcome, we
compared the predictive power of sick posts versus other COVID-19 posts. We show evidence
that sick posts predicted China CDC’s daily cases up to 14 days in advance, while other COVID19 related posts have much weaker predictive power. For the subset of geotagged posts, we
found that the predictive pattern held true for both Hubei province and the rest of mainland
China. Our work demonstrates one viable way to identify disease signals through reports of
symptoms or diagnosis, rather than relying upon general discussion of COVID-19. It achieves a
high level of prediction efficacy without sacrificing ease of interpretation, bringing significant
contributions to the literature of infoveillance.
Methods
Data Collection
Social media data used in this study were collected from a popular Chinese microblog
platform, Weibo, which had over 516 million monthly active users at the end of 2019 [23].
Weibo is very similar to Twitter, the access to which is blocked in mainland China. Unlike
Twitter, Weibo does not provide large-scale public API access to its database. Keywords-based
advanced search of Weibo posts is allowed via its web interface; however, the output of such
search is limited to 50 pages (or around 1,000 posts) as per Weibo policy, making large-scale
public data access notoriously difficult.

5
To bypass these limitations, we employed a Weibo user pool originally built in 2018,
which started from 5 million active Weibo users obtained in our previous research unrelated to
COVID-19 [24, 25]. We then retrieved the initial 5 million users’ followers and followees (2nd
degree users), the followers and followees of the 2nd degree users (3rd degree users), and so
forth, until no new users were found. This snowball process resulted in a pool of 250 million
users (with bots filtered out), which are approximately 48.4% of all monthly active Weibo users
in 2019 and similar to the population of Weibo users in terms of self-reported sex and age
distribution [26] (see Figure 1).

Figure 1 Demographic composition of our Weibo user pool with 2018 Annual Sina Weibo user
report
COVID-19 Posts
Following the best practices in content retrieval and analysis [27], we generated a
comprehensive list of keywords related to COVID-19 through a close observation of Weibo
posts daily from late January to early March 2020. We then retrieved COVID-19 posts by
searching through all posts by users in the user pool, with these 167 keywords covering general
terms related to epidemic, such as coronavirus and pneumonia, as well as specific locations (e.g.,
“Wuhan”), drugs (e.g., “remdesivir”), preventive measures (e.g., “mask”), among others (for a
complete keyword list, see Multimedia Appendix: Table A).

6
After removing duplicates (i.e., reposts of original posts), we retained 14,983,647 posts
sent between November 1st, 2019 (i.e., 30 days before the first confirmed cases) and March 31st,
2020.
A fraction of these posts (3.10%; N = 464,111) were tagged with geographic information.
We distinguished between posts sent within Hubei province (i.e., the epicenter; N = 169,340,
36.49%) and those from elsewhere in mainland China (N = 294,771, 63.51%).
Sick Posts
We conceptually define “sick posts” as posts that report any symptoms and/or diagnoses
that are likely related to COVID-19, based on published research and news reports from medical
social media site DXY.cn [28]. We collected a broad list of symptoms, including common
symptoms such as cough and shortness of breath, and uncommon symptoms such as diarrhea.
Sick posts can be further categorized into “ingroup sick posts,” which we define as posts that
disclose one's own or immediate family members' symptoms or diagnoses, and “outgroup sick
posts” which report those from other people not in one’s immediate family. The reason for the a
priori categorization is that people tend to have first-hand and more accurate information about
their own or immediate family members’ medical conditions, while people have much less
reliable information about those outside of their household, especially during a national
lockdown. All other posts that do not fall into these categories are classified as “other COVID-19
posts.” We list one example of “ingroup sick post” and one for “outgroup sick post” below
(translated and edited for brevity):
Ingroup sick post: “During the SARS epidemic in 2003, I got pneumonia with symptoms
of fever and cough, was suspected of being infected with SARS, and ended up being
hospitalized for more than a month. Now we got COVID-19 in 2020 and I started
coughing again, which has lasted for more than a month. What a mess <Face Palm>”
(posted at 10:23 p.m., January 29th, 2020)
Outgroup sick post: “One man in another village drank too much. He said he felt sick and
had cold symptoms. His brother measured his temperature which turned out to be 38
Celsius. His brother called 120 and sent him to hospital. The whole village was shocked
and everyone was afraid to go outside. “(posted at 10:14 p.m., January 29th, 2020)
We used supervised machine learning algorithms to identify sick posts from the keywordretrieved COVID-19 posts. We first sampled 11,575 posts in proportion to the retrieved posts
across 5 months of data collection. Next, 11 human judges annotated whether a post was an
“ingroup sick post,” “outgroup sick post,” or “other COVID-19 post.” The judges independently
annotated a subset of 138 posts and achieved high agreement (Krippendorff’s α = 0.945) before
they divided and annotated the remaining posts. Then, the annotated posts were used to train
machine learning models with various algorithms. Based on the classification performance (see

7
Table 1), we selected the model using the random forest algorithm (F1 score = .880). The model
classified all COVID-19 posts into 394,658 (2.63%) “ingroup sick posts,” 97,635 (0.65%)
“outgroup sick posts,” and 14,491,354 (96.71%) “other COVID-19 posts.” Because of the
scarcity of outgroup sick posts, we combined ingroup and outgroup sick posts in subsequent
analyses.

Among the subset of geotagged COVID-19 posts (3.10% of all retrieved posts), 5,650
sick posts and 163,690 other COVID-19 posts were tagged in Hubei, and 26,488 sick posts and
268,283 other COVID-19 posts were from elsewhere in mainland China. These post counts were
then aggregated by days. To control for the day-to-day fluctuations of Weibo posts, we further
normalized these numbers against the daily counts of all Weibo posts generated by our user pool.
The normalized sick post and other COVID-19 post counts can be interpreted as counts per 1million posts. Figure 2 summarizes our data collection and classification process.

Figure 2. Weibo data collection and classification procedure
COVID-19 Daily Case Counts
We collected daily new case counts in mainland China from China CDC on May 8th,
2020. China CDC’s official website started collating data on January 16th, 2020. Earlier counts
were obtained from Huang et al. [1] and validated against relevant briefings from the National
Health Commission. The final case data cover the same period from November 1st, 2019, to
March 31st, 2020, within which the first reported COVID-19 clinical case dates back to
December 1st, 2019. We also distinguished between the cases within and outside of Hubei (see
Figure 3).
It is noteworthy that China CDC released seven editions of diagnostic criteria throughout
the course covered in this study and thus introduced systematic changes to the case counts.

9
Particularly, on February 12th, 2020, Hubei province started to implement the fifth edition
released on February 4th. This led to a temporary surge of new cases [29]. The incident’s impact
was controlled for in our analyses, as discussed in the section below. After close inspection, we
concluded that the changes among other editions of the diagnostic criteria were relatively minor
and their release dates did not appear to be associated with abrupt changes of the case counts;
therefore, we did not further control for them.

31st, 2020

Statistical Analysis
We performed Granger causality tests [30] to discover if the increase of sick posts
forecasts the increase of new cases, as formulated in the following linear model:
𝑚

𝑚

𝛥𝐶𝑡 = 𝑎0 + ∑ 𝑎𝑖 ∆𝐶𝑡−𝑖 + ∑ 𝑏𝑗 𝛥𝑆𝑡−𝑖 + 𝑐1 𝐼𝑡 + 𝜀𝑡
𝑖=1

𝑗=1

where Ct is the difference of new case counts at day t from day t-1, St-i is the difference of sick
post counts (normalized) at day t from day t-1, and It is a time-varying binary variable that equals
1 on February 12th, 2020, on which day Hubei adopted the 5th edition of diagnostic criteria. This

10
binary variable controls for the exogenous pulse of case counts [31]. Since Weibo posts were
collected from as early as November 1st, 2019, 30 days before the first reported case on
December 1st, 2019, we were able to test up to 29 lags of such posts (i.e., m ≤ 29). The model is
further explained as follows.
First, difference scores instead of raw new case counts are used because Dickey-Fuller
tests for the raw counts could not reject non-stationarity (i.e., the presence of a unit root) for lag
3–29 at 5% CL (confidence level; see Multimedia Appendix: Table B). Both stationarity and the
inclusion of autoregressive terms are required by Granger causality. In contrast, the Dicky-Fuller
tests suggest the difference scores of case counts are stationary: The non-stationarity is rejected
for lag 1–12 at 1% CL, and it is rejected for lag 13–29 at 5% CL (see Multimedia Appendix:
Table B). The Dickey-Fuller tests also reached the same conclusion for the stationarities of the
sick post counts and their difference scores (see Multimedia Appendix: Table B). We thus also
used the difference scores instead of the raw counts to reduce correlations among lag terms of
sick post counts. This helps to better identify their independent effects on case counts. In short,
these difference scores can be interpreted as “daily-additional” cases or Weibo posts beyond the
counts from the previous day.
Second, to determine the number of lag terms to include (i.e., m), we compared model fit
statistics while iteratively adding lag terms. The model comparison suggests the inclusion of
more lags continuously improves model fit till the maximum lags (i.e., 29; see Multimedia
Appendix: Table C). However, the parameter estimates do not change qualitatively after
including more than 20 lags (see Multimedia Appendix: Tables D & E). For parsimony and
statistical power, we settled at 20 lags for the following analyses.
Finally, we included a binary variable to control for the change of diagnosis criteria on
Feb 12th, 2020, following the procedure of intervention analysis [32]. Because this change is
unlikely to induce permanent change to case counts, an instant pulse function is applied at the
date of change. We also tested models that allow the effect to linearly decay in 2, 3, 4, or 5 days,
and these models fit the data worse than the model with an instant pulse (see Multimedia
Appendix: Table F).
Results
Ordinary least square regressions with robust standard errors were used to estimate the
final models. With 20 lag terms in the model, the dataset includes daily-additional new COVID19 cases from December 1st, 2019 to March 31, 2020, and daily-additional counts of sick posts
and other COVID-19 posts from November 10th, 2019 to March 11, 2020 (N = 122).
Figure 4(A) summarizes the estimates of Granger causality for sick posts predicting new
COVID-19 cases with standardized regression coefficients (see Multimedia Appendix: Table G

11
for all estimated parameters). Particularly, one standard deviation of increase in the dailyadditional sick posts (1 sick post per 1-million posts) predicted 0.133 (95% CI: 0.065, 0.201) to
0.275 (95% CI: 0.134, 0.416) standard deviation of increase in the daily-additional new cases, 1
to 14 days in advance. After including the 20 lags of sick posts, the model’s adjusted R2
increases by 0.128, suggesting that sick posts could explain an additional 12.8% of the variance
of daily-additional new cases beyond the autoregressive terms and intervention effects.

Figure 4. Standardized estimates of Granger causality for time-lagged, daily-additional Weibo
posts (sick posts and other COVID-19 posts) predicting daily-additional cases.
Furthermore, we tested the relationship between daily-additional new cases and other
COVID-19 post counts, using the same linear model. Figure 4(A) further illustrates the
standardized coefficient estimates. Compared with sick posts, other COVID-19 posts were
weaker signals of future case counts, as demonstrated by smaller standard regression
coefficients. It means that Weibo posts that discuss some aspect of COVID-19 but did not report
explicitly anyone’s symptoms or diagnosis had a smaller forecasting power, compared with that
of sick posts.

12
To corroborate the above results, we tested sick posts’ Granger causality on cases within
Hubei and outside of Hubei (see Multimedia Appendix: Table H). Within Hubei, the results
generally agree with the national pattern mentioned above. Daily-additional sick posts predicted
daily-additional new cases within Hubei up to 19 days in advance, as illustrated in Figure 4(B).
In contrast, other COVID-19 posts had fewer lag terms that could forecast new cases. Outside of
Hubei, sick posts’ predictive pattern was similar to the national pattern, but with a limited time
range: sick posts could forecast new cases 2 to 8 days in advance (see Figure 4(C)).
Discussion
The novel coronavirus causing COVID-19 is a pathogen new to the human reservoir. It
poses an extraordinary challenge for public health systems worldwide, because screening and
diagnostic tests have to be developed from scratch. Even when such tests eventually become
available, testing capacity is often severely limited, fueling the outbreak as many patients
unknowingly infect others. Based on approximately 15 million COVID-19-related Weibo posts
between November 1st, 2019 and March 31st, 2020, we developed a supervised machine learning
classifier to identify “sick posts,” which are reports of one’s own and other people’s symptoms
and diagnosis of COVID-19. Using the officially reported daily case counts as the outcome, our
work shows that sick posts significantly predict daily cases, up to 14 days ahead of official
statistics. This finding confirms prior research that social media data can be usefully applied to
nowcasting and forecasting emerging infectious diseases such as COVID-19 [22, 33].
One of the biggest challenges of digital disease surveillance is to identify useful disease
signals, especially when facing a deluge of social media activities as a result of COVID-19
mitigation measures [12, 33-35]. Our finding that sick posts have a greater predictive power than
other COVID-19 posts shows that not all social media data are equally informative. Specifically,
COVID-19 has dramatically disrupted everyday life, resulting in people sheltering in place and
increasingly communicating with others via social media. As shown in prior work [18] as well as
in our dataset, the majority of COVID-19 chatter on Weibo was due to public awareness of
COVID-19, rather than actual symptom reports. Most previous work took rather coarse-grained
approaches, relying primarily on either aggregated search query data or social media data
retrieved from limited keyword searches [19, 22]. Our work collects the largest, most
comprehensive and granular social media data related to COVID-19 in the Chinese language.
More importantly, it demonstrates one viable way to identify valid signals from noise through
reports of symptoms and diagnosis, bringing significant contributions to the literature on digital
surveillance.
Another important finding is that the predictive power of sick posts on daily case counts
holds true for both Hubei and non-Hubei regions, but the effect sizes vary. Being the epicenter of
the outbreak, Hubei province experienced extreme testing shortages during the early stage of the
study period. As a result, many Hubei residents turned to social media sites such as Weibo to

13
seek help for testing and medical care. By contrast, social media help-seeking activities were
uncommon in other parts of China where testing and healthcare resources were much more
adequate. With such regional variations, we still observed predictive signals of sick posts on case
counts, suggesting that predictive power of sick posts was robust against testing delays. Further,
the variations in the effect estimates show that social media data’s predictive power may vary
across different geographic areas, with different levels of preparedness, and at different stages of
the outbreak. Future studies based on longer periods of data monitoring could explore in more
depth the temporal and spatial variations of COVID-19 social media surveillance efficacy.
Our work has broad public health implications. The high speed and low cost of social
media surveillance can be especially useful at the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak, to
inform containment and mitigation efforts when they are most cost-effective. For countries and
regions where public health infrastructures do not allow for widespread screening and diagnostic
tests, social media disease surveillance provides much needed information for public health
agencies to model the trajectories of the outbreak, and make swift decisions about resource
allocation, such as hospital beds, ventilators, and personal protective equipment.
Another advantage of social media surveillance is that it can be done from afar. As
COVID-19 continues to spread across the globe, countries lacking testing and screening
infrastructures will become “dark spots,” endangering their own people as well as the entire
world. It is imperative that international organizations such as the World Health Organization
integrate such data into their outbreak forecasting management practices, in order to mobilize
and coordinate relief efforts to help combat COVID-19.
This study has several limitations. First, Weibo posts were retrieved retrospectively,
rather than in real-time, which means deleted or censored posts were absent from our dataset.
However, we have no reason to believe that deletion or censorship favored “sick posts” in
measurable ways. In fact, a recent study on Weibo censorship during December 2019 to
February 2020 shows that only 1.7 per 1000 Weibo posts were censored, and these censored
posts were generally about the government’s missteps in its COVID-19 response, not individual
reports of symptoms and diagnoses [36]. Therefore, our results should be unaffected by
censorship omissions. Second, as some studies suggest [37-39], confirmed COVID-19 case
counts published by China CDC may be a significant underestimation of the actual counts, due in
part to limits in testing capacity and the existence of asymptomatic carriers. Still, the data here
represents the best-known data of confirmed case counts. Third, it is important to acknowledge
that “sick posts,” as disease signals, are not without noises, because 1) Weibo users who reported
COVID-19 symptoms did not necessarily have COVID-19 clinically, 2) Weibo users may not
speak the truth, and 3) Weibo users may “overreport” (posting about their symptoms or
diagnoses multiple times) or “underreport” (not posting despite their symptoms or diagnoses) for
a variety of reasons. Such inaccuracies are inherent in user-generated social media data, and
widely exist in all infoveillance studies. However, it should be noted that the goal of

14
infoveillance has never been to achieve one-for-one match between social media posts and
clinical cases. Rather, infoveillance approaches strive to mine useful, early signals from social
media and Internet data as a supplement to conventional surveillance efforts. Despite such
noises, we still found these sick posts reliably predicted COVID-19 case counts, indicating the
signal’s validity in reflecting disease spread in the population.
The threats of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases are likely to recur in the future.
Reports of symptoms and diagnosis on social media during emerging disease outbreaks send
invaluable warning signals to the public. Researchers and disease control agencies should pay
close attention to the social media infosphere. On top of monitoring overall search and posting
activities, it is crucial to sift through the contents and efficiently identify true signals from noise.
Our main findings highlight the importance of using rigorous procedures and understanding
information sharing behaviors to obtain quality signals to quantify sickness reports. Future
studies based on longer periods of data monitoring could explore in more depth the time and
spatial diffusion of COVID-19. More detailed examination of post contents reporting restraints
in information or medical resources will be helpful in developing local outbreak responses.

Table F. Model comparisons for sick posts or other COVID-19 posts (difference scores) predicting new cases
(difference scores) in mainland China with varying linear decay rates of the effect of the changed diagnostic
criteria on February 12th, 2020 (N = 122)
Hubei province adopted the fifth edition of the diagnostic criteria on Feb. 12th, 2020. We compared models with
different decay functions of this change’s intervention effects, including an “instant pulse” on Feb. 12th (the
indicator was coded as 1 at February 12 and 0 elsewhere), and linear decays in 2 days (the indicator was coded as 1
and 0.5 at February 12th and 13th), 3 days (the indicator was coded as 1, 0.667, and 0.333 at February 12 th, 13th, and
14th), 4 days (the indicator was coded as 1, 0.75, 0.5, and 0.25 from February 12 th to 15th), or days 5 days (the
indicator variable was coded as 1, 0.8, 0.6, 0.4, .2 from February 12 th to 16th).
