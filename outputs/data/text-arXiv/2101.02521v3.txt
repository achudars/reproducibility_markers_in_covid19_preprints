Abstract
In response to the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), governments have introduced severe
policy measures with substantial effects on human behavior. Here, we perform a large-scale,
spatio-temporal analysis of human mobility during the COVID-19 epidemic. We derive human mobility from anonymized, aggregated telecommunication data in a nationwide setting
(Switzerland; February 10–April 26, 2020), consisting of ∼1.5 billion trips. In comparison to
the same time period from 2019, human movement in Switzerland dropped by 49.1 %. The
strongest reduction is linked to bans on gatherings of more than 5 people, which is estimated to
have decreased mobility by 24.9 %, followed by venue closures (stores, restaurants, and bars)
and school closures. As such, human mobility at a given day predicts reported cases 7–13 days
ahead. A 1 % reduction in human mobility predicts a 0.88–1.11 % reduction in daily reported
COVID-19 cases. When managing epidemics, monitoring human mobility via telecommunication data can support public decision-makers in two ways. First, it helps in assessing policy
impact; second, it provides a scalable tool for near real-time epidemic surveillance, thereby
enabling evidence-based policies.

Introduction

The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has evolved into a global pandemic, which, as of December 15, 2020, has been responsible for more than 70 million reported cases1 . In response,
governments around the world have put policy measures into effect with the aim of reducing transmission rates2–6 . Examples of policy measures are border closures, school closures, venue closures,
and bans on gatherings.
Prior literature has suggested the use of human mobility data to model the COVID-19 epidemic7 . Mobility patterns have been inferred from point-of-interest (POI) check-ins8–12 and from
location logs of smartphone apps13–25 . Other works have used telecommunication data to model
spreading patterns26, 27 and for exploratory analysis of mobility patterns28–30 but none have yet empirically explored the link between mobility and policy measures. Establishing such a link would
provide a scalable tool for near real-time disease surveillance under policy measures and, in particular, enable evidence-based policies. Previously, the value of telecommunication data for disease surveillance has been studied in the context of malaria31, 32 , influenza33 , and other infectious
diseases34–36 , where the objective was to make spatio-temporal forecasts. In contrast, this paper
demonstrates the utility of telecommunication data for near real-time assessments of COVID-19
policies. In fact, nationwide data from mobile telecommunication networks has been used by governments during the first wave of COVID-1937 . However, to the best of our knowledge, empirical
evidence regarding the effectiveness of telecommunication data for epidemic surveillance in the
context of COVID-19 is absent.
In this paper, we analyze human mobility during the COVID-19 epidemic. Our analysis is
based on large-scale, granular data of human movements (anonymized and aggregated) consisting
of ∼1.5 billion trips in Switzerland during the first COVID-19 wave (February 10–April 26, 2020)
derived from telecommunication data. Using regression models, we estimate the (1) impact of policy measures on human mobility, and (2) how mobility predicts the growth in reported COVID-19

2

cases. By establishing that policy measures reduce mobility and that mobility predicts reported
cases, mobility insights can be used to inform when to implement policy measures. The findings are therefore of direct value to public decision-makers: monitoring human mobility through
telecommunication data provides an effective and scalable tool for near real-time epidemiology
and thus, management of the COVID-19 epidemic.
To establish the ability of telecommunication data for near real-time monitoring of the COVID19 epidemic, we follow a two-stage approach (see Methods). We first study the reduction in
mobility due to 5 different policy measures (bans on gatherings of more than 100 people, bans
on gatherings of more than 5 people, school closures, venue closures, and border closures). We
then estimate to what extent the reduction in mobility predicts decreases in reported case growth.
Here, we compare the predictive ability over a forecast window from 7 to 13 days. Taken together,
the results confirm the effectiveness of policy measures for reducing human mobility and, in turn,
human mobility as a predictor of reported cases by a lead time of approx. 7–13 days. The twostage approach is repeated for total trips; 3 different modes of mobility (train, road, highway); and
2 different purposes for mobility (commuters vs. non-commuters). In an extended analysis, we
further perform a mediation analysis. Here, we decompose the reduction in new reported cases due
to the policy measures into (a) the part that is only explained by reductions in mobility and (b) the
part that is explained by other behavioral adaptations.

Results
Human mobility derived from nationwide telecommunication data
We analyze large-scale data on human mobility during February 10–April 26, 2020 from Switzerland. For this, human movements were derived from telecommunication data (see Methods).
Telecommunication data provide more reliable and extensive information on mobility compared

3

to alternative data sources (check-ins or location logs from smartphone apps)7, 38, 39 . In particular, our telecommunication data represents routine signal exchanges (“pings”) exchanged between
mobile devices and network antennas. These were recorded for all mobile devices in Switzerland regardless of the mobile service provider. Based on the telecommunication data, granular
locations (longitude, latitude) of individuals carrying a mobile device were inferred. This yields
data on micro-level movements from all mobile devices in a nationwide setting. Altogether, the
nationwide mobility for a population of ∼8.6 million people was estimated.
For the analysis, the telecommunication data were then processed to compute the number of
trips between posts codes per day and canton. All trips were further classified according to the
mode of mobility (“train”, “highway”, and other “road” movements) and purpose (“commuting”
vs. “non-commuting”). For the time period of this study (February 10–April 26, 2020), our data
include a total of ∼1.5 billion trips. Details are reported in Methods.
We further collected data on the use of policy measures in Switzerland. Switzerland comprises 26 member states at the sub-national level (called “cantons”), each with a large degree of
sovereignty. As a result, the use of policy measures varies across cantons with respect to their order
and timing in a way that is similar to the variation among other European countries. Some cantons
(e. g., Ticino at the border to Italy and Geneva at the border to France) showed epidemiological
dynamics with large numbers of reported cases and responded with comparatively stringent policy
measures during the first wave of COVID-19. Other cantons had lower case numbers and put policy
measures in effect during a later phase of the epidemic. We followed a systematic procedure (see
Supplement A) based on which we encoded policy measures according to five categories: bans
on gatherings (> 100 people), bans on gatherings (> 5 people), school closures, venue closures
(stores, restaurants, bars), and border closures. The implementation dates of the chosen policy
measures varied greatly across cantons (but then remained in effect for the complete study period,
i. e., until April 10).
The spatio-temporal patterns of human movements in our data are as follows. Overall, we
4

recorded ∼95 million trips in the first week (February 24–March 1, 2020), during which all five
policy measures were in effect in all 26 cantons. In comparison, the same time period in 2019 (as
a reference period) registered ∼186 million trips. This amounts to a reduction of 49.1 %. The
reduction occurred in all cantons (Figure 1a,b). The highest decline was observed in Ticino and
Geneva, which are located at the borders with Italy and France, respectively. Both cantons also
reported the highest number of COVID-19 cases.
The largest mobility reduction compared to 2019 occurred on Sunday, March 22, 2020 (Figure 1c). In comparison to Sunday, March 24, 2019, the reduction in trip counts ranged between
49.3 % and 77.0 % across the 26 cantons (mean: 61.6 % reduction per canton). Overall, the
reduction in mobility is of similar magnitude for both rural (e. g., canton of Valais) and urban regions (e. g., cantons of Basel-City and Zurich). Furthermore, movements declined for all modes
of mobility (Figure 1d) and for all purposes (Figure 1e). After the implementation of the policy
measures, trips by train remained low for the rest of the study period, while highway traffic was
on an upward trend (Figure 1d). Similarly, trips by commuters remained at a low level after the
implementation of the policy measures, whereas trips not for commuting (i. e., personal purposes)
started increasing in early April (Figure 1e).

Figure 1: Nationwide human mobility in Switzerland during the first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic. Mobility is
quantified by movements (“trips”) between different post code areas. (a) Total number of trips per canton for the first
week after all policy measures were put in effect in all cantons (March 25–April 1, 2020). (b) Total number of trips for
the same week in 2019 (i. e., as reference year). For this week, the total number of trips dropped from ∼186 million (in
2019) to ∼95 million (in 2020), i. e., a reduction of 49.1 %. (c) Percentage change in total trips across 26 sub-national
levels (cantons) for 2020 vs. 2019 (when aligned for day-of-week patterns). The reason for the comparison to 2019
is to show the reduction in mobility relative to a reference year, while accounting for seasonal changes in mobility. A
higher reduction in mobility is observed for cantons that also reported a high number of COVID-19 cases (i. e., Ticino
and Geneva). (d) Reduction in trip count by mode of mobility. (e) Reduction in trip count by purpose of mobility.
Annotations show nationwide implementation dates of policy measures (implementation dates at cantonal level are
reported in Supplement A).

Estimating the reduction in human mobility due to policy measures
We estimate the reduction in mobility due to the policy measures with a regression model. The
estimates are identified via a difference-in-difference analysis and may thus be given a causal
interpretation under certain assumptions (see Supplement B.1).
The most effective policies for reducing trip counts are as follows (Figure 2a). Based on our
model, bans on gatherings of more than 5 people reduced total trips by 24.9 % (95 % credible
interval [CrI]: 22.1–27.6 %), venue closures reduced total trips by 22.3 % (95 % CrI: 15.6–29.0 %),
and school closures reduced total trips by 21.6 % (95 % CrI: 17.9–25.0 %). For a precise ranking,
the width of the credible intervals must be considered. Here, the aforementioned policy measures
appear more effective at reducing total trips than the other two policy measures (i. e., bans on
gatherings of more than 100 and border closures). In particular, bans on gatherings of more than
100 people are linked to a comparatively smaller change in total trips than bans on gatherings of
more than 5 people (i. e., the 95 % CrIs of the estimates are disjoint). For border closures, the
credible interval includes zero. Overall, policy measures are important determinants of mobility
reductions during the COVID-19 epidemic.
The estimated mobility reduction depends on the underlying mode (Figure 2b). Across all policy measures, the mobility reduction is more pronounced for highways than for road movements.
This observation is to be expected. Highways are often used for long-distance travel, which is
more likely to be suspended during an epidemic, while roads also include movements within close
proximity and are more likely to correspond to routine or essential activities (e. g., grocery shopping). For the ban on gatherings and school closures, the largest reduction is seen in trips by train,
which can be explained by the widespread use of public transportation in Switzerland. Finally,
we observe a wide credible interval for the estimated effect of venue closures on trips by train. A
potential reason for this is that the use of trains (e. g., for visiting stores) varies across cantons,
as some cantons (e. g., Zurich) have a high population density with extensive shopping infrastructure, while others (e. g., Appenzell Innerrhoden) have only a few stores due to their low population
7

density, resulting in the need for travel to visit stores.
The estimated effect sizes are fairly similar for trips made for commuting versus noncommuting (Figure 2c). This is interesting considering that no policy measure in Switzerland
directly prohibited movement to and from work. The efficacy of border closures is uncertain since
the credible interval for its estimated effect includes zero. In contrast, a negative effect is observed
for commuting. Here, one potential reason is that border closures have reduced the number of
cross-border commuters.
The findings are robust to alternative model specifications (see the robustness checks in Supplement D). Specifically, changing the specification of time-related control variables still gives
parameter estimates for the policy measures that imply decreases in mobility.

on (a) the total number of trips, (b) trips by mode, and (c) trips by purpose. The dots in (a)–
(c) show posterior means; the thick and thin bars represent the 80 % and 95 % credible intervals,
respectively. Policy measures are arranged from top to bottom in the order in which they were
implemented (cf. Supplement A).

Estimating the relationship between mobility and COVID-19 cases
The epidemic dynamics during the first wave of COVID-19 in Switzerland are as follows. The
initial exponential growth rates exhibit considerable heterogeneity across cantons (Figure 3a). The
strongest initial growth is observed for the cantons Ticino and Geneva, resulting in the largest
8

number of cases towards the end of the sample. Moreover, the number of reported cases at the dates
that policy measures were implemented varies greatly across cantons (Figure 3b). This reflects
different responses among cantons to local infection dynamics.
We use regression models to estimate the extent to which decreases in mobility predict future
reductions in the reported number of new cases (Figure 3c). The predicted decrease is studied with
a forecast window over 7–13 days. The forecast window is set analogous to previous research25 ,
and so that it covers variations in incubation time combined with reporting delay.
We find that decreases in mobility at a given day predict decreases in reported new cases 7
to 13 days later. For a 7-day ahead forecast, we find that a 1 % decrease in the total number of
trips predicts a 0.88 % (95 % CrI: 0.7–1.1 %) reduction in the reported number of new cases. For a
13-day ahead forecast, a 1 % decrease in the total number of trips predicts a 1.11 % (95 % CrI: 0.9–
1.6 %) reduction in the reported number of new cases. Overall, mobility predicts decreases in the
reported number of new cases over the whole forecast horizon. The predicted decrease is larger
for longer forecasts. This result is to be expected, as a longer time window accommodates the
full distribution of incubation periods (plus reporting delays). Altogether, the regression analysis
provides evidence of that mobility predicts epidemic dynamics.
Our analysis also shows that the predicted change in the reported number of new cases varies
across the mode and purpose of trips. In terms of mode, decreases in trips by highway and train
predict reductions in the reported number of new cases of similar magnitude (Figure 3d). Their
estimates have comparatively narrow credible intervals, reflecting a higher degree of certainty.
Trips are also categorized according to their purpose, namely commuting vs. non-commuting. The
results show that decreases in trips for commuting predict smaller reductions in the number of reported new cases compared to decreases in non-commuting trips (Figure 3e). Predicted reductions
are nonetheless found for both modes of mobility (i. e., commuting vs. non-commuting), all categories of purpose (i. e., highway, road, and train), and for the whole 7–13 day forecast window.
Again, a larger reduction is predicted for longer forecasts.
9

The predictive ability of mobility for reported new cases holds with alternative model specifications (see the robustness checks in Supplement D). For most of the 7–13 day forecasts, changing
how we control for time-related factors still results in a predicted decrease in reported cases given
decreases in mobility.

Estimating the mediating role of mobility
In an extended analysis, we study how decreases in reported case growth is explained by reductions
in mobility due to policy measures versus other behavioral changes due to policy measures. The
estimates are obtained from a mediation analysis that decomposes the total effects of the policy
measures on reported case growth into (1) their direct effects not explained by changes in mobility
and (2) their indirect effects through mobility. The mediation analysis is performed by combining
our two regression models into a structural equation model (see Supplement F for details). Results
from mediation analysis are reported for the total number of trips.
The mediation analysis shows a large direct effect for bans on gatherings of more than 5 people,
bans on gatherings of more than 100 people, and school closures (4). Pronounced indirect effects
are found for all policy measures. In particular, the indirect effect of venue closures makes up about
a third of their total effect at several lags. Moreover, border closures are estimated to only have
reduced the reported number of new cases indirectly through mobility. The results are discussed in
further detail in Supplement F. In summary, the results show that mobility is an important mediator:
the studied policy measures operate – to a large degree – through mobility. Thus, policy measures
aimed at reducing mobility appear to be effective for reducing COVID-19 case growth.

Discussion
This study shows the ability of telecommunication data for near real-time monitoring of the
COVID-19 epidemic. Our analysis is based on nationwide telecommunication data during February 10–April 26, 2020 from Switzerland, which were used to infer nationwide mobility patterns.
12

This supports monitoring of the COVID-19 epidemic as follows: (1) We first studied the link between policy measures and human mobility. In particular, we performed a difference-in-difference
quantifying how mobility was reduced due to 5 different policy measures (bans on gatherings,
school closures, venue closures, and border closures). The largest reduction in total trips was
linked to bans on gatherings of more than 5 people, followed by venue closures and school closures. Overall, the policy measures resulted in substantial reductions of human mobility. (2) We
then studied the link between human mobility and reported COVID-19 cases. Reductions in mobility predicted decreases in the number of reported new cases. Specifically, a reduction in human
movement by 1 % predicted a 0.88–1.11 % reduction in the daily number of new cases of COVID19 over a forecast horizon of 7 days to 13 days. Our modeling approach with telecommunication
data therefore provides near real-time insights for disease surveillance. Taken together, the findings enable quantitative comparisons of the extent to which policy measures reduce mobility and,
subsequently, reduce reported cases of COVID-19.
The use of telecommunication data for nationwide monitoring has several benefits7, 40 . First,
telecommunication data from mobile networks provide comprehensive coverage. Specifically,
such data capture all movements of individuals carrying mobile devices without explicit user interaction, including those from non-residential and even foreign individuals. Mobile devices routinely exchange information when searching for signals from adjacent antennas; hence, metadata
are retrieved regardless of the underlying mobile service provider. Second, such metadata can be
collected in an anonymized manner that is compatible with data privacy laws. Third, movements at
a micro-level (e. g., trips to other households, school, and work) can be inferred. Thus, compared
to alternative sources of mobility information such as check-ins or smartphone apps, telecommunication data are considered to be more complete7, 38, 39 . Fourth, unlike smartphone apps, telecommunication data are also available in low-income countries41 . Finally, telecommunication data
are measured with high frequency (e. g., daily), thereby enabling regularly updated monitoring as
needed by decision-makers. Based on these benefits, telecommunication data appear to be highly
13

effective for policy monitoring during the COVID-19 epidemic.
This work is subject to the typical limitations of observational studies. First, the findings depend on the accuracy of the data on COVID-19 cases. Second, our models are informed by recommendations for COVID-19 modeling42 and, therefore, follow parsimonious specifications to isolate
features of the epidemic for policy-relevant insights. We cannot, however, rule out the possibility that there exist external factors beyond those that are captured by the spatially and temporally
varying variables in the models. To address this, we use flexible models and conduct extensive
robustness checks (Supplement D). Third, the model linking policy measures to mobility estimates
effects, while the model linking mobility to cases is predictive. The different objectives of the
models address the needs of public decision-makers: the former serves policy assessments and the
latter epidemiological forecasting, respectively. Therefore, the estimates from the former are identified with a difference-in-difference analysis and may thus warrant causal interpretations under
certain assumptions (see Supplement B.1). On the other hand, the estimates from the latter are
conditional associations since the model does not control for that policy measures reduce both mobility and cases. Therefore, the latter model predicts decreases in reported cases from reductions in
mobility when both reductions are driven by policy measures (see Supplement B.2 for a discussion
of this approach). Fourth, our findings are limited to our study setting, that is, the first wave in
Switzerland. Future research may confirm the external validity of our findings by analyzing other
countries or time periods.
Inferring mobility patterns from telecommunication data is inherently coupled to the coverage
of such data and our definition of trips. Only movements for individuals who carry a mobile device with a SIM card are included. In particular, trips are not included for individuals who do not
carry SIM cards. Similarly, trips may be counted several times if an individual carries several SIM
cards (e. g., when carrying both a phone and a SIM-based tablet). It is also possible that trips by
children, elderly, or other parts of the population with less phone usage are underrepresented in
the data. Furthermore, micro-level movements are not observed but recovered via triangulation
14

between antennas through the use of a positioning algorithm achieving state-of-the-art accuracy.
In spite of these limitations, telecommunication data are considered to be scalable and, in particular, more complete for inferring mobility patterns compared to alternative data sources7, 38, 39 .
Moreover, our objective is not to obtain accurate estimates of mobility in itself, but to evaluate
the predictive ability of telecommunication data for reported case growth. Our analysis confirms
telecommunication data as such a monitoring tool.
Our findings are of direct value for public decision-makers. Nationwide mobility data from
mobile telecommunication networks can be leveraged for the management of epidemics. Thereby,
we fill a previously noted void in the case of COVID-1938, 39, 43 . Specifically, monitoring mobility supports public decision-makers when managing the COVID-19 epidemic in two ways. First,
it helps public decision-makers in assessing the impact of policy measures targeted at mobility
behavior. Second, by predicting epidemic growth, it provides a scalable tool for near real-time epidemic surveillance. Such tools are relevant for evidence-based policy-making of public authorities
in the current COVID-19 epidemic.

Methods
The aim of this study is to make population inference from nationwide telecommunication data. In
our study, telecommunication data are collected from routine signal exchanges (i. e., pings) with
antennas, regardless of the actual service provider. Based on the telecommunication data, mobility
estimates are inferred as follows (Fig. 5): (1) Telecommunication data are collected at the level
of antenna. (2) Telecommunication data at antenna level are used to infer micro-level movements
of individuals via triangulation. (3) Data on micro-level movements are used to count movements
between postal codes (named “trips”) over time. This procedure is performed to capture mobility
levels in the population. (4) The data are further aggregated at the cantonal level per day in order
to link them to policy measures and COVID-19 case numbers. The procedure is detailed in the

COVID-19 epidemic.

Nationwide telecommunication data
Telecommunication data are routinely collected from signal exchanges (i. e., pings) between mobile devices and adjacent antennas. Such signal exchanges occur for all SIM-based mobile devices
(e. g., mobile phones, smartphones), regardless of the actual service provider. In particular, our

16

data also include movements of people with a foreign SIM card and, hence, represents nationwide
telecommunication. A network event between a mobile device and mobile network compromises
metadata as follows: the IMSI number of the SIM card, the date and time the SIM card connected
to the mobile network, and the ID of the mobile antenna to which the SIM card was connected.
The IMSI number is available for all SIM cards and thus represents a unique identifier, independent of the actual service provider. The events from mobile networks are extracted from the mobile
communications systems every night, and thus the mobile data is available the following day. In
our analysis, we use telecommunication metadata collected according to the above description by
Swisscom44 . Swisscom also ensured that IMSI numbers are stored in an anonymized format (see
Ref.44 for details).
Telecommunication data hold advantages over alternative data sources for the purpose of measuring human mobility. The advantages become especially clear in comparison to location data
from check-ins8–12 or location logs from smartphone apps13–20, 45 . First, compared to smartphone
applications, SIM-based devices are fairly ubiquitous. This holds for both high-income countries (such as Switzerland) and low-income countries. Second, the use of telecommunication
data ensures coverage for large parts of society. Specifically, it reduce the risk of an age bias
(e. g., check-ins are known to be more frequent among younger, technology-savvy people). Third,
telecommunication data avoid the need for user interaction with a device. Hence, many microlevel movements are captured (e. g., school visits, commuting to work, grocery shopping) that
would otherwise not be subject to monitoring.
The telecommunication infrastructure operated by Swisscom has wide coverage44 . Specifically,
it covers 99.9% of the geographic area in Switzerland. The infrastructure records telecommunication metadata via almost 30,000 antennas. Hence, there are multiple antenna per postal code.
In particular, approx. 7,000 of the antennas are of the GSM type, 11,000 of the UMTS type, and
12,000 of the LTE type46–48 .
The frequency of pings is determined by the mobile device, occurring every time a mobile
17

phone connects to a new antenna or, if in between two antennas, every ∼5 minutes. Hence, the
ping frequency produces data of higher temporal resolution than the data we later use for the
analysis. An internal algorithm by Swisscom ensures that bouncing (i. e., when a phone bounces
between antenna) is correctly addressed and attributed to a single antenna. The telecommunication
metadata are then used to infer actual locations over time via triangulation (see next section).

Inferring positions of SIM cards via triangulation
The locations of SIM cards within antenna areas are determined via triangulation between antennas through the use of a positioning algorithm49 . A high-level description of the algorithm is as
follows. Every signal from a SIM card in the telecommunication data is associated with a probability distribution over locations that represents the uncertainty of its actual location in a given
antenna area at the time. The location is estimated from two random variables: the radius R, given
by the distance of the signal from the origin of the antenna area, and its angle Θ to the antenna
azimuth. Here, R is Gaussian distributed with empirical mean and variance estimated via maximum likelihood, and Θ follows a multinomial distribution depending only on the antenna azimuth
and its bandwidth. The inferred locations are subject to a delay between signals between antennas
and SIM cards. To address this, the location at a given point in time is estimated by marginalizing
the probability distribution of the radius over the empirical distribution of signal delays estimated
from all observations. Details are available in49 . In sum, by tracking the location of SIM cards
over time, we are able to capture micro-level movements of individuals.
The accuracy of the positioning algorithm has been empirically validated49 . The median positioning error is 132 meters, making it highly accurate compared to state-of-the art methods50 . The
accuracy was determined by comparing the algorithm’s predicted positions to self-reported actual
positions for more than 6,000 trips with over 12,000 end-points49 .

Deriving mobility estimates from telecommunication data
Mobility has been frequently found to be helpful for understanding urban phenomena51, 52 . In this
study, we derive mobility estimates from nationwide telecommunication data.
Trips are computed as follows. A single trip is defined as the movement of a SIM card between
two different post code areas after the location has been static for 20 minutes. The trip is then
counted for both post codes. Similarly, trips that cross midnight are counted for both days.
Post codes were chosen to define trips as they represent the smallest spatial unit that is officially defined by the federal government. Switzerland has 3,196 post code areas with high spatial
granularity. The exact size varies between urban and rural regions, but, on average, a post code
area in Switzerland covers merely 12.9 km2 . Moreover, 71 % of the Swiss working population
commute between different post codes for work and oftentimes even between cantons (https:
//www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/en/home/statistics/mobility-transport/
passenger-transport/commuting.html).

The average (one-way) travel distance

to work is 15.0 km (see previous URL), and, the average daily travel distance for leisure
activities is 36.8 km (https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/en/home/statistics/
mobility-transport/passenger-transport/travel-behaviour.html).

For

both work and leisure activities, travel routinely spans several postal code areas. Hence, the use of
nationwide telecommunication data combined with our definition of trips provides comparatively
large-scale estimates of aggregate mobility.
For the analysis, daily trips were further aggregated as follows. First, each trip between post
codes was mapped onto cantons at the sub-national level. Here, we used cantonal shape files from
the Swiss government and aggregated all daily trips within each canton. Note that the number of
trips into and out of cantons are captured with this aggregation due to the attribution of trips to
both the departure and arrival post codes. The result of the aggregation is a panel (longitudinal)
dataset of trip counts across cantons.
The reason for the aggregation to the cantonal level per day is twofold. First, policy measures
19

are implemented within cantons, and, second, COVID-19 case data are only published per day at
the cantonal level. Therefore, data on policy measures and case number are not available on a more
granular level.
Trips were further labeled according to both mode and purpose.

The mode of trips

was differentiated based on estimating the location of SIM cards with the positioning algorithm and the position of antennas along train, highway, and road networks.

If sev-

eral modes of mobility were used in the same trip, the mode with the longest leg was
chosen.

For comparison, public transport through train is an important mode of trans-

portation in Switzerland (https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/en/home/statistics/
mobility-transport/passenger-transport/travel-behaviour.html) that is
relevant for explaining the results. The purpose of mobility was classified based on trips to/from
work (called “commuting”) and all other trips (called “non-commuting”). This differentiation was
based on the home and work locations of individuals (i. e., postal code area). These locations
were derived from the most frequent geographic location of individuals between 8 pm–8 am for
home locations and 8 am–5 pm for work locations. Afterwards, both home and work location were
matched against the departure and arrival (postal code area) of a trip to determine whether the trip
was to/from work, and hence labeled “commuting”. The classification or trips into mode of transport is highly accurate. A validation against self-reported data was performed, showing that 90 %
of all trips were correctly classified49 .

Modeling overview
In this section, we present the regression models used to estimate the relationship between (1) policy measures and mobility and (2) mobility and reported cases. Here, the first model estimates the
reduction in mobility due to policy measures. The estimates are identified with a difference-indifference analysis and may therefore be given a causal interpretation under certain assumptions
(see Supplement B.1). The second model, in turn, estimates the extent to which reductions in
20

mobility predict decreases in the reported number of new cases as policy measures are being implemented.
The models have parsimonious specifications recommended for isolating policy-relevant insights42 and are informed by epidemiology. In particular, they are formalized as Bayesian hierarchical negative binomial regression models. Rather than modeling the disease dynamics themselves (as with a compartment model), our focus is on estimating the relative effect of other determinants, namely, policy measures and mobility. The use of negative binomial distributions is
common in epidemiological modeling, as it allows for overdispersion in dependent variable (i. e.,
the number of trips and the reported number of new cases). Furthermore, each model uses a loglink between the dependent and explanatory variables. For the model of the reported number of
new cases, it enables us to capture the exponential growth in cases during the initial stages of an
epidemic, also observed in our data. For the model of mobility, it makes the estimates relative to
the observed levels of mobility. Both dependent variables were found to follow negative binomial
distributions (with overdispersion). See Appendix C.4 for an analysis of overdispersion.
The models include further controls for (1) population size per canton, (2) unobserved heterogeneity between cantons, and (3) time effects as follows. (1) We control for differences in
population size among cantons with an offset term. This is motivated by the fact that the magnitude of the estimated effects depend on the population size. Hence, the model estimates are relative
to the number of inhabitants per canton. (2) Unobserved heterogeneity is estimated with a canton
random effect. We thereby account for unobserved factors that affect both policy measures and
mobility (for the former model) and mobility and cases (for the latter model). (3) Time effects are
modeled in two ways. On the one hand, we include weekday fixed effects to control for variations
in the implementation of policy measures, levels of mobility, and reporting/testing across weekdays (e. g., mobility is higher on weekdays, whereas testing is lower on weekends; thus, reported
cases are lower on weekends and tests conducted on weekends may be reported on Mondays or
Tuesdays). On the other hand, we incorporate a trend variable that controls for changes in case
21

dynamics or behavioral adaptations towards social distancing that occur over time since a canton
first reported a case. This could for instance occur due to unobserved changes in adherence to
other policy measures (e. g., wearing masks and keeping physical distance of at least 1.5 meters)
over time. Here, we model the variation in when cantons reported their first case as potentially
dependent on the unobserved canton heterogeneity.
The results with additional controls (e. g., test frequency, spatial correlation between cantons,
and dependence between the different trip variables) are part of the robustness checks.

Model for estimating the reduction in human mobility due to policy measures
A multiple time period, multiple group difference-in-difference (DiD) analysis53 is conducted to
estimate the effect of each policy measure on mobility. We restrict the analysis to the time period
between February 24 and April 5, 2020; that is, starting before the first reported COVID-19 case
in Switzerland and ending prior to Easter holidays. With this time period, the initial observations
act as a control group in which mobility is at the baseline level (as individuals may not yet have
voluntarily reduced their mobility as a response to reported cases). Furthermore, by ending at
April 5, there can be no confounding of the effects of policy measures due to Easter holidays. Such
confounding would be caused by that during holidays, mobility generally changes from regular
levels and, as a consequence, policy measures are more or less likely to be implemented relative
non-holidays.
Let Mitk denote the trip count on mobility variable k = 1, 2, . . . , K (i. e., total trips, road trips,
train trips, etc.) in canton i = 1, 2, . . . , N on day t = 1, 2, . . . , T . The variable Mitk is derived as
explained in the previous section and represents the dependent variable in regression model k for
the DiD analysis. The values of the model parameters depend on which mobility variable is the
dependent variable of the regression; hence, we index all model parameters with k.

22

We model Mitk to follow a negative binomial distribution with conditional mean function

(k)

E[Mitk | ηit , Ei ] = µ(Mitk ) = Ei exp ηit

(k)

where Ei denotes the population size of canton i. Then, exp ηit = (µ(Mitk ))/Ei is the expected
number of daily trips per inhabitant in canton i. The estimates of this model are therefore adjusted
(k)

according the variation in canton population sizes. The term ηit is the linear predictor, specified
in hierarchical form as

whose variables and parameters are explained in the following.
(k)

The first term αi

(k)

is a time-invariant effect specific to canton i. We model αi

as a function

of several variables that vary across cantons; see Equation (3). Here, α(k) is the intercept among
all cantons, which represents the overall baseline relative mobility on Mondays before any policy
(k)

measure was implemented and any COVID-19 cases were reported. The term θi

is a random

effect that captures unobserved time-invariant factors for canton i (e. g., population density) that
Ę
confound the effect of policy measures on mobility. The final variable log
zi is discussed in detail below. The subscript B on the associaed parameter denotes that it measures between-canton
effects; that is, the parameter only measures the effect of increases in the variable across cantons.
The variable ditl is a dummy variable that takes a value of 1 if policy measure l ∈ {1, 2, . . . , L}
(k)

is implemented by canton i at day t and 0 otherwise. Hence, exp(βl ) measures the multiplicative
effect of policy measure l on the expected number of daily trips on mobility variable k per canton
inhabitant. Note that all policy measure variables are included in (2). Hence, the effect of each
policy measure is conditional on the other policy measures being held fixed. Figure 1c shows that

23

the reduction in mobility is similar across cantons; therefore, we do not estimate the heterogeneity
in the effect of the policy measures on mobility across cantons.
(k)

The term δw(t) represents the fixed effect of weekday w on the relative (log-transformed) mobility compared to the reference weekday (here: Monday). The term controls for the confounding
factor that aggregate mobility and the probability of implementing a policy measure is likely higher
on, e. g., Mondays than Sundays.
The variable zit captures other sources of time-related confounding and is derived as follows.
Let qit be the number of days since the first reported COVID-19 case in canton i. The variable is
calculated as

qit =




t − t0 ,

if t > t0i ,



0,

if t ≤ t0i ,

i

(4)

where t0i is the date the first case was reported in canton i. Since the logarithm of zero is undefined,
we then set zit = qit + 1 and include the logarithm of zit in the model. The associated parameter
γ (k) is therefore interpreted as the percentage increase in relative mobility given a 1 % increase
in the number of days since a canton first reported a case. The rationale for including zit is that
individuals may adapt their mobility behavior over time irrespective of social distancing policies.
Therefore, the variable captures how mobility would trend over time even if the policy measures
were not implemented.
P
Ę
The variable log
zi = T −1 Tt=1 log zit is the time average of log zit in canton i. The bar
over the expression denotes an average value. The variable is included in the model to allow the
(k)

canton-specific effect θi

to be correlated with log zit over the cantons. Such correlation would,

for instance, arise if the date that the first COVID-19 case is reported in each canton depends
on the unobserved canton-specific factors. As an example, the date the first case is reported in
a canton could depend on the (unobserved) adherence of inhabitants to social distancing recom-

24

mendations. If such correlation exists but is ignored, it would instead enter the error term of the
model, leading to a violation of the exogeneity assumption and incorrect parameter estimates. By
(k)

Ę
including log
zi , we essentially make θi

a Mundlak-type correlated random effect54 . The benefit

of correlated random effects over fixed effects or standard random effects is that they use only
the within-unit variation to estimate parameters (and, hence, give identical estimates to those of
fixed effects models) while also having the random effects property of estimating the variation in
the unobserved heterogeneity via partial pooling. Note that time averages of the policy measure
variables or weekday effects are not included in the model since those are exogenously determined
and, therefore, uncorrelated with the model errors. We refer to55 for a detailed discussion of the
underlying benefits of this approach relative to fixed effects.
By substituting the linear predictor (2) into the conditional mean function (1) and expanding
(k)

αi , the full model of mobility variable k becomes

where ζ (k,M ) is the overdispersion parameter (the superscript M distinguishes the overdispersion

We specify one regression equation in the form of (5) for each mobility variable and estimate
them separately. Each regression has the same explanatory variables but a different mobility variable as the dependent variable (i. e., total trips or one of the mobility variables based on mode or
purpose).

25

Model for estimating the relationship between mobility and COVID-19 cases
The model for estimating the relationship between mobility and reported COVID-19 cases is similar in structure to the model used to link policy measures to mobility. To accommodate the forecast
horizon, we lag the mobility variables to estimate how a decrease in mobility at a given day predicts reductions on the reported number of new cases at a later day. This enables forecasting of
future reported case growth by evaluating the model at daily observed mobility levels.
Let Cit denote the cumulative number of reported cases in canton i = 1, 2, . . . , N until and
including day t = 1, 2, . . . , Ti . Then, Yit = Cit − Ci,t−1 is the number of new cases that are
reported in canton i on day t. Note that the time frame (i. e., total number of days Ti ) varies across
cantons i = 1, . . . , N . The reason for this is that the dependent variable of this regression model
is the reported number of new cases, and as such we restrict the data to start at the date of each
cantons first reported case. Hence, the data for this model starts between February 24 and March 16
(depending on the canton) and ends at April 5 (for all cantons). Our modeling approach accounts
for the resulting unbalanced number of observations per canton.
We model Yit as following a negative binomial distribution with a conditional mean function
(k,s)

E[Yit | ηit

ber of reported positive cases in canton i on day t relative to the canton population size (sometimes

where ζ (k,s,Y ) is the overdispersion parameter.
For simplicity, we use the same notation for variables and parameters in this model as in the
model used for the effect of policy measures on mobility (but the estimated parameters have, of
course, a different interpretation and values). The superscript (k, s) is attached to parameters to
indicate that their values depend on the choice of mobility variable k and its lag s.
The parameter of interest is ξks . It measures the expected percentage change in the reported
number of new cases per canton inhabitant s days after a 1 % increase in mobility variable k.
Hence, the parameter shows how the relative growth rate in reported cases changes as a function of
lagged mobility, after adjusting for relevant factors but where mobility varies according to which
policy measures are implemented. Note that we intentionally include only a single lag s (and
then refit the model for different lags) rather than including multiple lags at the same time. We
follow this approach because infection disease dynamics imply that there are carry-on effects in
infection rates between consecutive days that would be modeled as being fixed if several lags are
included, resulting in biased estimates. We also only include only a single lagged mobility variable
k. The reason is that every trip by mode or reason contributes to the total number of trips; hence,
to avoid counting single trips several times, both the variable for the total number of trips and any
variable for trips by mode or reason should not be included in the same model. Moreover, since

27

trips by mode or purpose are different subsets of total trips, every trip by one mode must be a trip
of one purpose (e. g., a train trip is either made for the purpose of commuting or non-commuting);
hence, for the same reason, the model should not include mobility variables for both a mode and a
purpose. Supplement B.2 further explains our rationale.
The intercept α(k,s) gives the baseline number of reported cases relative to the canton population
for Mondays.
(k,s)

The parameter δw(t) is the effect of weekday w relative to the Monday effect. By including
weekday effects in the model, we control for confounding differences in the number of trips and
the number of reported COVID-19 cases between weekdays that would bias the parameter estimate
on the lagged mobility variable. For instance, people travel to schools and work primarily on
weekdays and, similarly, there are fewer COVID-19 tests on weekends and thus fewer reported
cases on Monday/Tuesday (due to reporting delays).
The variable log zit is also included in this model. It now controls for the fact that mobility and
the reported case growth both depend on when the first case was reported in a canton.
(k,s)

The Mundlak-style random effects θi

estimate the impact of unobserved canton-specific

factors that may be correlated with both the variation in mobility across cantons and the logarithm of the number of days since the first case was reported in each canton. We achieve this
Ğ
by including variables of the time averages of log zit and lagged mobility, that is, log
mik =
P
T −1 t−s log mi,t−s,k . Then, any potential cross-canton correlation between the random effect
and log mi,t−s,k or log zit via the models error term is controlled for.
The above regression model is fitted separately for each (k, s), that is, each pair of mobility
variable and lag. This allows us to investigate to what extent different lags of each mobility variable
predict the number of reported cases.

28

Estimation details
We estimate our models in a fully Bayesian framework. We run 4 Markov chains for every model,
each with 2000 warm-up samples and another 2000 samples from the posterior distributions. Since
our models are fitted with a log-link, we transform the posterior parameter samples so that they
give estimates for the original scale of the dependent variable. For each parameter, we report
in our plots the posterior mean and the associated 80 % and 95 % credible intervals (CrI) of the
transformed posterior distribution.
The software used for estimation is the R package brms58, 59 version 2.11.1 built upon the
statistical modeling platform Stan60 . Parameter estimates are obtained by Markov chain Monte
Carlo sampling in Stan version 2.19.2 using the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm61, 62 and the
No-U-Turn sampler (NUTS)63 .
Table 1 presents our choices of priors for the variables in the models. We use weakly informative priors to stabilize the computations and provide some regularization. Our prior on each
βl reflects that we expect each policy measure to reduce the logarithm of expected mobility with
25 %, on average, but that effects between 0–50 % are relatively probable. The prior on each ξks
implies that we expect that a 1 % decrease in the lagged mobility variable predicts a 1 % decrease
in reported cases for each of the considered lags, with negative effect sizes or effect sizes exceeding
2 % being unlikely. The prior on γ implies that we expect the relative outcome to increase with 1 %
for each 1 % increase in the number of days since the first reported case. The intercept, overdispersion parameter, and standard deviation of the canton random effects are given weakly informative
priors. The prior on δw(t) states that the effect of a given weekday that is not Monday should
fall within 50–150 % of the Monday effect. The parameters for the variables of between-canton
averages are assigned vague priors since we have no a priori belief of their effects.

Table 1: Choice of priors

Model diagnostics
We followed common practice for model diagnostics of Bayesian models64 . For each of the models, we inspected (1) posterior predictive checks, (2) divergent transitions, (3) effective sample
size and convergence of the Markov chains, (4) overdispersion in the dependent variables, (5) influential observations, and (6) correlation between the policy parameters. All model diagnostics
indicate a good fit. Details are provided in Supplement C.

Robustness checks
First, we checked the robustness of the model estimates against alternative specifications of time
effects: (a) A model specified as in the main paper but where the logarithmic trend is replaced
with corresponding linear and quadratic trends (of the number of days since the first reported case
30

in each canton) to capture nonlinearities in both the reported case dynamics and general behavior
towards social distancing. (b) A model with additional week fixed effects (i. e., a weekday fixed
effect, a week fixed effect, and a trend variable in logarithmic form). This model allows us to
control for weekly exogenous shocks (e. g., media reports about the shortage of critical care in
Italy) but acknowledge that such fixed effects would be unknown at the time of forecasting and,
therefore, cannot be used to predict reported case growth at a future date. All models yield similar
estimates and hence confirm the explanatory power of the mobility variables (see Appendix D.1).
Second, the number of reported cases could potentially depend on the number of conducted
tests per canton and day. When controlling for this, we obtain similar estimates (Appendix D.2).
Third, we extend the models by including a spatial random effect, as commonly used in the
spatial epidemiology and disease mapping literature65, 66 . This approach allows us to account for
the spatial dependence in mobility between neighbouring cantons. We find that the spatial dependence is low and retrieve estimated effects of policy measures that are practically identical to those
of the main analysis (see Appendix E.1).
Fourth, we account for a potential dependence between different mobility variables and thus
develop an estimation procedure for fitting their models jointly (that is, by modeling the covariance
of the canton random effects for the different mobility variables). This model yields slightly narrower credible intervals but almost identical point estimates for the effects of the policy measures
(see Appendix E.2).

Data

A.1

Policy measures

We collected data on policy measures implemented at both national level directly from the official resources of the federal government in Switzerland (www.admin.ch). Implementations of
policy measures at sub-national (cantonal) level were collected from official resources of the cantonal authorities (e. g., www4.ti.ch, www.ge.ch). These policy measures were implemented
throughout the complete canton (i. e., there is no “partial” implementation). We then checked
our data on policy measures against benchmark datasets, namely the government response event
dataset CoronaNet67 , the Government Response Tracker68 and the Swiss National COVID-19 Science Task Force (https://ncs-tf.ch/en/situation-report). As our goal is to study
the response and impact of mobility, we excluded policy measures that were primarily used to
target physical distance and not mobility. Examples of such policy measures is the requirement
to wear a mask or the recommendation to keep a physical distance of at least 1.5 meters between
people.
The policy measures were encoded as follows. We encoded “school closures” such that the
closure falls on a weekday. That is, when school closures were put into effect on a Saturday, we
encoded “school closures” as being closed from Monday onwards. The reason is that both primary
and secondary schools are, by default, closed on weekends and, hence, movements from/to school
can only be in effect on the next weekday. Different from other countries, schools were closed not
“partially”, e. g., for specific age groups, but for all. We encoded “closed border” such that this
policy measure is in effect when any side of the border is closed. As an example, when Italy closed
its border, we encoded the borders for the adjacent cantons as closed. The rationale is that trips will

43

be cancelled if people cannot return. For all cantons without borders to other countries, we encoded
“border closures” as implemented when the national government decided put travel restrictions in
place. Consider Zurich as an example. The cantonal government of Zurich did not put travel
restrictions into effect, and, hence, we set “border closures” for the canton of Zurich to March 25,
2020, which is the date when the national government enforced travel restrictions. Before that
date, travel into the canton was possible through Zurich airport and it was only restricted from
March 25, 2020 onward due to the national (and not the cantonal) government.
The resulting list of policy measures is shown in Table 2. All of these policy measures remained in effect from the day of their implementation until the end of our study period (i. e.,
through April 26, 2020). Furthermore, note the cross-canton variation in implementation dates for
some of the policy measures. The difference in timing for a given policy measure is one of the
aspects that enables us identify the effects of the policy measures with the difference-in-difference
analysis. These comparisons better approximate differences between a treatment and control group
when the cantons are comparable by having similar values on unobservable and included control
variables in the regression model (see Model for estimating the reduction in human mobility due
to policy measures). An example of a comparable difference is that between St. Gallen (SG) and
Lucerne (LU). These cantons are similar in geographical size, population size, and population density, but whereas SG implemented border closures on March 14, LU was not affected by border
closures until March 25 (Table 2). Hence, between these dates, LU provide control observations
for SG that enable us to identify the effect of borders closures in the whole country.

Variation in timing of policy measures across cantons

We summarize the spatio-temporal heterogeneity across cantons of when policy measures were
put into effect. For this, we first study the difference in days between cantons of when any pair of
two policy measures were implemented. We take the absolute value of the difference in days as
the difference should not depend on which canton implemented a policy measure first. We then
calculate the mean and median of the absolute differences to obtain easily interpretable summary
statistics of the variation in timing. Table 3 shows that the policy measures are rarely implemented
close in time; instead, there is a substantial delay between implementation dates across cantons.
This variation among policy measures between cantons enables us to disentangle the effects of the
different policy measures and affects the precision of their estimated effects. See Appendix C.6

Identification strategy

This section explains how the model estimates are identified from the data. In doing so we also
explain the assumptions underlying the modeling.

B.1

Estimating the reduction in human mobility due to policy measures
through a a difference-in-difference analysis

The parameter estimates for the policy measures can be interpreted as causal effects under the following standard assumptions for difference-in-difference (DiD) analysis: (1) the policy measures
were implemented (a) “as if” independently of the level of mobility or, (b) in the absence of any
policy measure, all cantons would have parallel trends in mobility; (2) the canton population distributions were stable over time; and (3) the implementation of each policy measure in any canton
did not affect the mobility in any other canton.
Assumption (1a) implies that there are no omitted confounders of the relation between policy measures and mobility. This seems credible conditional on unobserved canton-specific and
weekday-specific factors, the time since the a canton’s first reported case, and a canton’s population size. We therefore adjust for these factors in our model. Note that assumption 1a is stronger
than assumption 1b but that both are sufficient for the causal interpretation together with assumption (2) and (3). Hence if assumption (1a) does not hold, the DiD estimates can still be interpreted
as causal effects under assumptions (1b), (2), and (3) together. In our context, assumption 1b implies that, if no policy measures was implemented, mobility would trend (or not trend) in the same
way for all cantons. Then for a given day, the cantons that have not yet implemented a policy measure provide valid control observations for the cantons that have implemented the policy measure.
This assumption is inherently untestable, but likely holds since the cantons had parallel levels of
mobility prior to the policy measures (see Fig. 1 in the main paper).
Assumptions (2) and (3) are together known as the stable unit treatment value assumption69, 70 ,
47

which is a standard assumption in the causal inference literature and for difference-in-difference
analysis. Assumption 2 seems plausible given the official recommendations to limit long-distance
travel, the lockdown of many European countries at the time, and that our data cover close to the
whole Swiss population. The credibility of Assumption (3) is debatable since some people may,
for precautionary reasons, reduce their mobility when a policy measure that is not yet implemented
in their canton is implemented in another canton. The assumption could be relaxed by estimating
effects of the policy measures across cantons, but this would increase the modeling complexity
substantially and lead to more difficult interpretation of the results. Note that even if the above
assumptions for causality do not hold, the estimates from the DiD analysis are still useful as they
then give the conditional association between mobility and policy measures.
The analysis also requires the variables to follow a specific measurement order in time. To
measure the effect of policy measures on mobility within days, they must – for each day – be
implemented earlier than mobility is measured. This holds true in our study. The policy measures
were put into effect at midnight at their date of implementation in Switzerland, while movements
were then collected for subsequent days. Recall that, for each mobility variable, we calculate the
number of trips by aggregating the total number over the full day. Hence, the measurement order
is such that the policy measures precede mobility.
Altogether, the above elaboration points to assumptions under which the estimations can be
interpreted to be causal effects.

Estimating how reductions in mobility predict COVID-19 cases

We estimate the conditional relationship between lagged mobility and the reported number of
COVID-19 cases using a regression model. We control for variables that confound the relationship
between mobility and reported cases but let the policy measures vary. The regression thereby
identifies the extent to which the level of mobility at a given day predicts the number of new cases
reported in a later day when both depend on policy measures. By lagging mobility, we rule out
48

the possibility that the parameter estimates for mobility are biased by simultaneity or reversed
causality, meaning that there are feedback loops between mobility and reported cases or that the
number of reported cases affect mobility.
Two factors determine the delay of mobility in predicting the reported number of new cases:
(1) the incubation period, and (2) the reporting delay. Previously, the mean incubation period
was estimated to 5.1 days, while 97.5 % of infected people had symptoms within 11.5 days after
exposure71 . Adding a 2 day reporting delay (cf. the case data from the Federal Office of Public
Health of the Swiss Confederation; BAG) leads to the chosen lags of mobility of 7–13 days.
We fit the regression model separately for each lag and mobility variable. It would also be
possible to fit the regression with all lags of one mobility variable included. However, this approach
was discarded because of the following reason. Infection dynamics imply that the growth rate in
reported cases at a given day depends on earlier growth rates. Hence, the relationship between
mobility and the reported number of new cases at a given date is partially an outcome of their
relationship at an earlier date. Including all lags of a mobility variable in the model would restrict
this dependence. The parameter estimate associated with each lag of mobility would then reflect
how mobility at a given day predicts the number of cases reported in the number of days ahead
given by the lag, after the predicted change of the other lags of mobility has been removed. To
address this concern, our model specification includes only a single lag.
For a similar reason as above, the regression model was specified to include only a single
mobility variable (and not all mobility variables at the same time). Here the rationale is as follows.
Trips by mode and purpose are different subsets of total trips. A trip of one purpose is therefore
also a trip of one mode. For instance, every trip by train is either a commuter trip or non-commuter
trip. Including all mobility variables in the same regression would artificially hold the variables in
the subsets fixed against each other, resulting in incorrect estimates. This is ruled out in our model
specification where a only single mobility variable is included but where the model is re-estimated
for different ones.

Model diagnostics

This section presents an analysis of model diagnostics. For reasons of brevity, we only show
diagnostics for the models with the total trips variable. The diagnostics for the models of trips by
each mode and purpose also showed good fit.
The R package loo72 version 2.3.1 is used to estimate the Pareto tail shape parameter and,
based on it, check for influential observations. The other diagnostic plots are obtained with the R
package bayesplot73, 74 version 1.7.2.

C.1

Checking posterior predictive ability

We assess model fit through posterior predictive checks. For each model, we simulate 10 draws
from its posterior predictive distributions with the same values of the explanatory variables as those
used to fit the model, resulting in simulated replicates of the response variable. Consistent with
the notation in64 we denote these yrep . Figure 6 and Figure 7 shows kernel density estimates of
the replicated responses and the observed responses for the models of mobility and cases. The
replicated response densities fit the observed response density well, indicating good model fit.

C.2

Checking for divergent transitions

Figure 8 shows Kernel density and time series of the MCMC samples of the parameters for the
mobility model. Figure 11 shows the autocorrelation among the MCMC samples of the same
parameters. Figure 9 and Figure 11 shows the same information for the models with cases as
dependent variables. For brevity we omit the corresponding plots for control variables, intercepts
and random and fixed effects. For each lag of total trips, the posterior density of the parameter
is approximately Gaussian and that their chains have good mixing with no signs of divergence or
substantial autocorrelation.

50

C.3

Checking the effective sample size and convergence of Markov chains

Figure 12 and Figure 14 shows ratios of effective sample size to total sample size (n̂eff /N ) and
R̂ values, respectively, for the MCMC samples of all parameters in the regression models. The
corresponding plots for the models of cases are available in Figure 13 and Figure 15. The ratio
of effective sample size to total sample size is between around 0.4 and 1 for most parameters,
indicating a sufficient number of independent draws from the posterior distributions64 . The R̂
values are close to 1 for all parameters and models. Hence, this indicates convergence of the
Markov chains.

C.4

Checking for overdispersion

The estimated overdispersion parameter (for the models with total trips) is as follows:
• The first model (for estimating the reduction in human mobility due to policy measures) has
an estimated overdispersion parameter of 51.33 (95 % CrI: 47.02–55.88).
• The second model (for estimating the relationship between mobility and cases) has an estimated overdispersion parameter of 3.43 (95 % CrI: 2.92–3.99) at a lag of 7 days. The
parameter estimate amounts to 3.95 (95 % CrI: 3.34–4.65) at a lag of 13 days.
• In the mediation analysis, the estimated overdispersion parameter of the mediation model
amounts to 54.40 (95 % CrI: 49.49–59.54) for a lag of 7 days. The estimate increases to
61.83 (95 % CrI: 56.14–67.71) for a lag of 13 days. For the outcome model, the estimated
overdispersion parameter increases from 4.29 (95 % CrI: 3.60–5.06) at a lag 7 to an estimate
of 5.42 (95 % CrI: 4.48–6.49) at lag 13.
Overall, there is substantial overdispersion in the dependent variables. Because this, the use of a
negative binomial distribution for the dependent variables is recommended.

51

C.5

Checking for influential observations

Influential observations can have a negative effect on model fit. To check for the presence of
influential observations, we plot the Pareto tail shape parameter k against the observation indices
for each of the models. The results for the model of total trips are shown in Figure 16 while the
results for the model of cases on total trips are available in Figure 17. A value of k less than 0.5
is generally considered good whereas a value between 0.5–0.7 is considered okay75, 76 . No model
has many observations with an estimated value of k above 0.5.

C.6

Checking for correlations between parameters

A similar timing of the policy measures across cantons could make it difficult to distinguish their
individual effects. To investigate this issue, Figure 18 depicts scatterplots of the pairwise bivariate
posterior distributions of the policy measure parameters. There is a negative correlation between
the posterior samples of the parameters for some of the NPI pairs, reflecting a difficulty to distinguish the effects of the two policy measures if they are introduced close in time. It seems to be
somewhat difficult to distinguish between the effects of the ban on gatherings and school closures,
as they were implemented close in time in many cantons (Table 3). The same holds for the bans of
gatherings of more than five people and border closures. In contrast, the effects of border closures,
school closures, and venue closures can be distinguished, as judged by the even spread of their
pairwise scatters (Figure 18).

Robustness checks

In this section, we test the robustness of our model estimates against alternative specifications.

D.1

Alternative specifications of time effects

Because the data cover daily observations over a relatively long time period, there are many possible ways of controlling for different time effects. We therefore perform a robustness check of our
estimates by re-fitting the models with two alternative specifications of time effects.
Table 4 summarises how the main and alternative model specifications differ. Like the main
models, both alternative specifications include weekday fixed effects. The alternative specification (a) uses trend variables of the non-transformed and squared number of days since the first case
in each canton was reported (the main specification instead uses the logarithm). Compared to the
main specification, it simply postulates a linear and quadratic effect of the number of days since
the first case. The alternative specification (b) adds week fixed-effects to the main specification.
Thus, it also controls heterogeneity between weeks.
A prior of N(0, 1) is assigned to the parameters for the linear and quadratic time trends in the
second alternative specification. The week fixed-effects in the third alternative specification are
assigned a weakly informative prior of Half-t(3, 0, 2.5). All other priors are the same as in the
main specification.
The model with the first alternative specification of time effects needed 6000 iterations during
MCMC estimation to converge (3000 for samples for warm-up and 3000 samples from its posterior
distributions).

included in the model.

The models of mobility with alternative specifications of time effects give similar estimates
as the main specification (Figure 19). Specifically, replacing the logarithmic trend variable with
the corresponding linear and squared trends leaves the effects of the policy measures intact (Figure 19a). As expected, adding week fixed effects to the main specification reduces the estimated
effects of some policy measures. It also widens the credible intervals for school closures (Figure 19b). Apart from this the estimates are very similar to those of the main model specification.
Hence, the estimated policy effects are robust against a range of alternative controls for time effects.

for three alternative model specifications: (a) weekday fixed effects and linear and quadratic trend
of the number of days since the first reported case in each canton, and (b) weekday fixed effects,
week fixed effects, and a trend trend of the log number of days since the first reported case in each
canton. Posterior means are shown as dots, while 80 % and 95 % credible intervals are shown as
thick and thin bars, respectively. Policy measures are arranged in the order in which they were
implemented, shown in Appendix A.

The alternative specifications of time effects are also applied to the model of the reported
number of new cases on lagged mobility. Figure 20 shows their predictions of the percentage
change in the reported number of new cases given a 1 % decrease in mobility lagged by 7–13
days. Replacing the logarithmic trend variable with linear and quadratic trends does not alter
the estimated relationship between the mobility variables and reported case growth substantially
(Figure 20a). The predicted reduction in case growth given decrease in total trips is stronger than

68

in the main specification whereas the predicted reduction given decreases in commuter trips is
slightly weaker. Adding week fixed-effects to the main specification leads to a smaller predicted
change in reported case growth given reductions in mobility (Figure 20b). For some lags of the
mobility variables is the predicted reduction not statistically distinguishable from zero. However,
decreases in mobility still predicts reductions in reported case growth for the larger lags.
Altogether, the robustness checks show that the predicted reductions in reported cases given
decreases in mobility are robust to alternative specifications of time effects.

D.2

Controlling for the number of tests

The number of positive reported cases depends on the number of tests performed, which can vary
over the course of the pandemic. We therefore re-estimate our models of the reported number of
new cases on lagged mobility while controlling for the number of tests performed every day. This
is based on the assumption that cantons might not conduct equally many tests each day. Instead,
the number of tests that each cantons carry out might be determined by their population size and
other relevant risk factors in their population. Since test availability determines the number of
positive tests that can be detected, we extend the model of the relation between mobility and the
reported case growth with the number of daily tests per canton.
To the best of our knowledge, there exists no data on the number of tests conducted per day in
each canton of Switzerland but only in the country as a whole. We therefore estimate the number
of daily tests conducted per canton with the the number of daily tests in the whole of Switzerland
standardized to the canton population shares. That is, we divide the number of daily tests in
Switzerland as a whole with each cantons population share.
Formally, let uit be the true unknown number of tests reported in canton i in day t and let
PN
ut =
i=1 uit be the total and observed number of reported tests in the country in day t. We
estimate the number of tests in canton i in day t with
Ei
ûit = ut × PN

i=1

where Ei is the population in canton i, and

PN

i=1

Ei

,

(12)

Ei is the population in the country. The estimate

ûit thereby approximates the number of COVID-19 tests conducted in each canton and day under
the assumption that the number of daily tests per canton is proportionate to the share of the population that lives in each canton. We include the logarithm of ûit in the model so that it estimates
the percentage change in the reported number of new cases when the estimated number of daily
tests increases by 1 %. We assign the log-transformed variable a prior of N(1, 1), meaning that we
70

expect the effect size to be 1 % on average, but likely not negative or larger than 2 %.
After controlling for the number of daily tests per canton, decreases in mobility lagged by 10–
13 days still predict reductions in the reported number of new cases. Our findings are therefore
qualitatively the same for the majority of lags. However, the above analysis should be interpreted
with caution as it may be subject to post-treatment bias. The reason is as follows. Given an
increase in mobility, hospitals may in anticipation of a growth in cases in the near future start to
carry out more tests. Then, for a given day, the number of tests is (partially) an outcome of previous
levels of mobility. As a consequence, variation in the reported number of new cases that should be
attributed to changes in mobility gets incorrectly attributed to changes in the number of tests. As a
consequence, the parameter estimate for lagged mobility is biased. Such post-treatment bias might
explain the near-zero and positive estimates observed for some lags of mobility after controlling
for the number of tests.

Modeling extensions

This section includes extensions of the models featured in the paper. Estimation details are in
Appendix G.

E.1

Accounting for the spatial dependence in mobility among neighboring
cantons

Our main models treat mobility as being independent across cantons. Modeling cross-sectional
units as independent is a conventional approach in panel and longitudinal data analysis. However,
one would reasonably expect that the level of mobility is similar for neighboring cantons but not
so similar for geographically distant cantons. If a dependence in mobility between cantons is not
modeled, it will enter the error term, violating the assumption that error terms are independent
across cantons. For this purpose, we extend the mobility model with a spatial random effect that
captures the similarity in mobility among neighboring cantons prior to any policy measure.
(k)

Let φi

be a spatial random effect for canton i that has an additive effect on mobility variable

k on the log scale. The model for the effect of the policy measure on mobility variable k is then

(13)
The spatially-extended model may be viewed as a longitudinal version of the Besag-York-Mollié
(BYM) model65 commonly used for disease mapping applications in epidemiology. The term
“disease mapping” refers to statistical methods that estimates the spatial correlation between observations and where interest lies in the distribution of a disease over geographical units. The BYM
model, in turn, is a Bayesian hierarchical Poisson regression model with two types of random ef-

72

fects: (1) random effects that capture spatial correlation between units, and (2) random effects
that captures unobserved heterogeneity between units66 . Our spatially extended model adapts the
original BYM model with the use of a negative binomial distribution to account for the overdispersion in the trip counts. It also adapts the original BYM model by treating the random effects
for unobserved heterogeneity as Mundlak-style correlated random effects. This enables us to get
correct inference even if the date that each cantons first case is reported depends on unobserved
canton-specific factors.
As the original BYM model, we use an intrinsic conditional auto-regressive (ICAR) model as
a prior on the spatial random effect φi . The ICAR model of the conditional distribution of each φi
is
1
1 X
φj ,
|Ni | j∈N
τ |Ni |

φi | {φj : j ∈ Ni } ∼ N

!
,

(14)

i

where Ni is the set of neighbors of canton i, meaning the cantons that share a border with the
canton, and |Ni | denotes the cardinality of Ni , that is, its number of neighbours. For practical
implementation, the sets of neighbors can be constructed by defining a symmetric N ×N adjacency
matrix whose element in row i and column j equals 1 if cantons i and j share a common border,
and 0 otherwise.
The ICAR model states that each φi is conditionally Gaussian with mean equal to the average
of its neighbors spatial random effects and a variance that decreases with more neighbors. The
term τ is a hyperparameter for the variance of the composite random effect υi = θi + φi , where θi
is the random effect for unobserved heterogeneity. Based on derivations in77 , the joint distribution
of φ = (φ1 , . . . , φN ) is proportional to a particular pairwise difference form:

The pairwise difference form (15) shows that the ICAR model penalises large differences in the
values of neighboring cantons spatial random effects. Hence, finding the values of {φi }N
i=1 that
minimize these differences leads to local spatial smoothing78 . However, the distributions in (14)
and (15) are improper priors since they define the value of each cantons spatial effect relative to its
neighbors. As a consequence, the priors do not identify the overall mean among {φi }N
i=1 . To solve
P
this, the soft constraint N −1 N
i=1 φi ∼ N(0, 0.001) is used.
Another problem is that the random effects φi and θi cannot be separately identified. Thus,
heterogeneity across cantons that should be attributed to θ will be modeled as spatial correlation
by φ even when no spatial dependence is present. To solve this issue, we use the reformulated
BYM2 model56 . It involves a scaling79 and reparameterization80 of υ = θ + φ, explained next.
√
Let φ∗i := φi / κ be the spatial random effect for canton i after scaling. The scaling factor κ
is calculated from the neighborhood structure over all cantons and ensures that V[φ∗i ] ≈ V[θi ] ≈ 1
for each canton i. The scaled reparameterization of υi = θi + φi is

Here, Q−
∗ is the generalized inverse of the scaled precision matrix Q∗ , ϕ ∈ [0, 1] is a mixing pa74

rameter, and 1/τ is the marginal variance of log relative mobility that is explained by the combined
random effect υ. The fraction of this variance explained by the canton random effect θ and the
scaled spatial random effect φ∗ are (1 − ϕ) and ϕ, respectively79 .
Summarizing, the random effect θ for between-canton heterogeneity has prior distribution
MVN(0, I) and the spatial random effects φ has prior marginal distribution MVN(0, Q−
∗ ) and
prior conditional distribution given by (14) for each φi . See Riebler et al.56 for details. Replacing
υi = θi + φi in (13) with (16) gives the explicit equation for the model of mobility variable k with
the BYM2 spatial random effect.
Accounting for potential spatial dependence in mobility among neighboring cantons does not
alter the estimates of the policies (Figure 21). In other words, the spatial dependence in baseline
mobility is low. We therefore do not include the BYM2 spatial random effect in our main models.

E.2

Accounting for the dependence between the mobility variables

The variables for trips by mode or reason are different subsets of the total trips. As a result,
the trip variables are dependent on each other. One way in which this dependence could arise
is through the variation in baseline trip counts across cantons prior to any reported COVID-19
75

case and policy measure. As an example, we would expect the cross-canton variation in baseline
commuting trips to be correlated with the cross-canton variation in baseline non-commuting trips.

Since each regression equation’s canton random effect θ (k) = (θ1 , θ2 , . . . , θN ) gives the crosscanton variation in mobility variable k at baseline, we can estimate the dependence between the
mobility variables at baseline with the correlation coefficient between the canton random effects.
To do so, we model θ (1) , θ (2) , . . . , θ (K) as jointly multivariate Gaussian distributed:

where σθ2(k) is the variance of θ (k) = (θ1 , θ2 , . . . , θN ) of regression equation k = 1, 2, . . . , K,
the term σθ(k) θ(p) is the corresponding covariance between θ (k) and θ (p) from regressions equations
k and p, respectively, and the K ×K covariance matrix ΣM contains these variance and covariance
terms. Moreover, I is an N × N identity matrix and the symbol ⊗ denotes the Kronecker product.
We then obtain the correlations between all pairs of canton random effects for each pair of

ρθ(k) θ(p) = q θ θ

(19)

The correlation coefficients are collected as off-diagonal elements in the K × K correlation matrix
RM corresponding to ΣM and can be interpreted as summaries of the dependence between the
mobility variables’ baseline relative trip counts across cantons in the absence of any policy measure
and reported COVID-19 case. By modeling this dependence, we obtain more precise estimates
of uncertainty in parameter values than estimating each mobility variable’s regression equation
separately. The approach is analogous to that of seemingly unrelated regressions81 , except that
76

each regression model is a negative binomial generalized mixed model with a log-link.
Figure 22 shows estimates of the effect of the policy measures on mobility from the multivariate
model (Figure 22a) against the estimates from the separate regressions per mobility variables for
which the correlation between their canton random effects is not modeled (Figure 22b). Comparing the multivariate and separate regressions, we find that the point estimates given by the posterior
means are practically identical. There is a small tendency of the credible intervals in the multivariate model to be tighter. Note that estimating the multivariate model requires considerably more
computational runtime.

Mediation analysis of the role of mobility in the effect of policy measures on reported cases

We perform a mediation analysis to decompose the effects of policy measures on reported COVID19 cases into (1) their direct effects, meaning the part of their effects that is due to behavioral
adaptions not related to mobility, and (2) their indirect effects, meaning the part of their effects that
is explained by changes in mobility. The mediation analysis is performed by combining our two
regression models into a structural equation model. Estimation details are provided in Appendix G.

(23)

Here, ζ (k,s,M ) and ζ (k,s,Y ) is the overdispersion parameter from the mediation model and outcome
model, respectively, in which mobility variable k is lagged by s days.
The mediation model is identical to the model that links policy measures to mobility, but has
lagged values of all time-varying variables since their effects on the reported number of new cases
are delayed. The outcome model is the same as the model that links mobility to reported cases, but
now also includes the policy measures. The reason for this is that the structural equation model
shall estimate (1) the effects of mobility conditional on the policy measures, and (2) the effects of
the policy measures conditional on mobility. Here, (1) gives the mediation effect of mobility that
enables us to estimate the indirect effect of policy measures via mobility, and (2) gives the direct
effect of policy measures that explained by other behavioral adaptions. The added superscripts
m and y signifies that the parameters generally take different values in the mediation model and
outcome model.
To facilitate the interpretation of our results, we state how the parameters of interest shall be
interpreted in the mediation analysis:
(k,s)

• βl

is the effect of policy measure l on the log expected number of trips on mobility

80

variable k.
(k,s)

• λl

is the direct effect of policy measure l lagged by s days on the log expected number

of reported cases, conditional on mobility variable k lagged by s days and the other policy
measures lagged by s days . Formally, this is the change that would occur in the reported
number of new cases if (lagged) policy measure l would have been implemented but mobility
would not have changed as a consequence of policy measure l.
• ψks is the expected percentage change in the reported number of new cases as the number
of trips on mobility variable k lagged by s days increases by 1 %, conditional on all policy
measures lagged by s days being held fixed.
(k,s)

• βl

× ψks is the indirect effect of policy measure l via mobility variable k, both lagged

by s days, on the log expected reported number of new cases. The indirect effect gives the
expected change that would occur in the reported number of new cases if policy measure l
lagged by s days would always have been implemented but mobility variable k lagged by s
days would have changed as if the policy measure would vary as in the data.
(k,s)

• λl

(k,s)

+βl

×ψks is the total effect of policy measure l lagged by s days on the log expected

number of reported cases. It is the effect of policy measure l with the mobility variable k
changing as a consequence of implementing the policy measure. Hence, the total effect gives
the change in the reported number of new cases due to any behavioral adaption.
As shown in the above, we compute the indirect effect using the product method82 and sum
the direct and indirect effect to obtain the total effect. This is applicable to linear Bayesian multilevel models with random intercepts and no mediator-treatment interaction83 (i. e., no treatmentmoderated mediation), as the models of this study.
We check the assumption of no treatment-mediator interaction by, for every lag of 7–13 days,
re-estimating the outcome model (21) with an interaction term between each policy measure and
81

the mobility variable. We find that the parameters of the interaction terms have point estimates
close to zero with some of the credible intervals covering zero. We take this as sufficient evidence
of no treatment-mediator interaction and, therefore, proceed with the outcome model without such
terms.
The directed acyclic graph in Figure 23 visualises the relationships between the variables in the
structural equation model at a given day. For simplicity, we denote weekday, time and unobserved
canton factors lagged by s days with the vector Xi,t−s . The structural relationships among the
variables are as follows: At day t, the weekday, the number of days that has passed since the
first case was reported in the canton, and unobserved canton-specific factors jointly determine
the number of trips in the canton on each mobility variable and whether each policy measure is
implemented in the canton that day. The weekday, number of days that has passed since the first
reported case, and unobserved canton-specific factors also determine the reported number of new
cases, but with a lag of s days due to incubation periods and reporting delay. Whether a policy
measure is implemented in a canton at day t affects the trip count on each mobility variable in
(k,s)

same the canton that day (path βl

). Given the implementation of policy measures at day t, the

level of mobility affects the number of reported cases s days later (path ψks ). Hence, each policy
measure has an immediate effect on mobility, which is transferred into a delayed indirect effect
(k,s)

on the reported number of new cases through mobility (the product of paths βl

and ψks ). Each

policy measures also has a direct effect on the number of reported cases via behavioral adaptions
(k,s)

not related to mobility. This effect is also subject to a lag of s days (path λl

82

).

The vector Xi,t−s denotes the weekday, time, and canton effects in the models.

Note that every time-varying variable in the mediation model is lagged by s days, but that in the
outcome model, only the mobility variable and the policy measures are subject to this lag. With
this specification, we estimate how the instantaneous effect of the policy measures on mobility
variable k in day t − s affect the number of reported new cases in day t directly and indirectly via
mobility.

σθ(k,s,Y ) θ(k,s,M ) I
σθ1(k,s,Y ) I
(24)

Here, σθ2(k,s,M ) and σθ2(k,s,Y ) is the cross-canton variance of the random effect of the mediation model
and outcome model (k, s), respectively, and the off-diagonal term is the cross-canton covariance
between the models’ respective random effects. The 2 × 2 covariance matrix ΣM,Y contains these
variance and covariance terms. Computing the Pearson correlation coefficient
σ (k,s,M ) θ(k,s,Y )
ρθ(k,s,M ) θ(k,s,Y ) = q θ
σθ2(k,s,M ) σθ2(k,s,Y )

(25)

then gives the correlation between the random effects of mediation model and outcome model
(k, s). The correlation coefficient is in turn the off-diagonal element in the 2 × 2 correlation matrix
RM,Y that corresponds to the covariance matrix ΣM,Y .
We estimate the structural equation model separately for mobility and the policy measures
lagged by 7–13 days to see how the direct, indirect and total effects vary across the delay of the
effects. To save space, however, we only estimate the models with the total trips mobility variable
as a mediator.

F.2

Identification

We now state the identification conditions and assumptions required for the mediation analysis.
Imai et al.84, 85 propose a “sequential ignorability” assumption under which the direct and indirect
effects are identified if the structural equation model is linear and contains no treatment-mediator
interaction. The assumption consist of two parts. In the setting of this study, the assumptions are:

84

(1) each policy measure is implemented independently of mobility and the reported number of new
cases, and (2) within observations with the same status on the policy measures, the number of trips
on the mobility variable is independent of the potential number of reported cases. The first part
of the assumption means that the control variables, the fixed effects, and the random effects in the
models are sufficient to remove any confounding in the relationships between the policy measures
and mobility as well as any confounding in the relationships between policy measures and the
reported number of new cases. The second part of the assumption implies that, if we also condition
on the policy measures, there is no confounding of the relationship between mobility and the
reported number of new cases. This is a stronger assumption since it must hold for every observed
combination of the policy measures in the data. Another assumption necessary for identifying
indirect effects is that the mediator is measured without error. Since our data cover every trip made
with a mobile device the assumption likely holds in this study.

F.3

Results of mediation analysis

The results from the mediation analysis with total trips as a mediator are shown in Figure 24.
Direct effects. The ban on gatherings of more than 5 people has the strongest estimated direct
effect on the reduction in the reported number of new cases. Its estimated 95 % credible intervals
range between a reduction of 18.8–38.7 % (at a lag of 13 days) to a reduction of 35.9–50.5 % (at
a lag of 8 days). The credible interval of the direct effect of bans on gatherings of more than
100 people includes zero for lags 7–8 days. Hence, bans on larger gatherings may have a longer
delayed direct effects than bans on smaller gatherings. Border closures do not appear to have
directly reduced the reported number of new cases.
Indirect effects. The estimated indirect effects show that mobility mediates the effects of
policy measures on the reported number of new cases. The largest indirect effects are found for
venue closures and bans on gatherings of more than 5 people. Both policy measures are estimated
to have reduced the reported case growth with around 6–8 % at the higher order lags indirectly
85

via mobility. Of particular interest is the estimated indirect effect for border closures. Recall that
the estimated direct effects of border closures include zero. Hence, this implies that the effect of
border closures occurs exclusively through mobility. This is to be expected considering that border
closures may not affect other types of behavior than mobility.
Total effects. Combining the direct effects and indirect effects gives the total effects. Again,
bans on gatherings of more than 5 people, bans on gatherings of more than 100 people, and school
closures have the largest estimated total effects, in part due to their pronounced indirect effects.
For any of the days that schools were closed, the estimates imply that there would on average be
21.2 % (95 % CrI: 9.48–32.3 %) more reported cases at the 10th day ahead and 34.1 % (95 % CrI:
24.3–42.9 %) more reported cases at the 13th day ahead if schools would instead have remained
open. Note that for several lags, the indirect effect of venue closures makes up more than a third
of its total effect.
Overall, the mediation analysis demonstrates that the effects of social distancing policies operate – to a large degree – through mobility. Hence, telecommunication data provides valuable
information for estimating effects of policy measures aimed at reducing mobility.

Sensitivity analysis for the assumption of no unmeasured confounding

The mediation analysis rests on the sequential ignorability assumption of no unmeasured confounding in both the mediation model and the outcome model. Now, if there exists unobserved
confounders that affect both the mediator and the outcome, then those variables will be part of

87

both models’ error terms. Hence, under the assumption of no unmeasured confounding, there
should be no correlation between the models’ respective errors. Based on this observation, Imai
et al.85 propose a sensitivity analysis based on the correlation between the residuals in the two
models.
To conduct the sensitivity analysis, we draw 4000 samples (e. g., as many as the length of the
parameters’ Markov chains, including the warm-up) from the models’ predictive posterior distributions, each of the same size as the number of observations in the data. For each of the models,
we subtract these values from the observed responses to get posterior samples of the model’s predictive errors. We then compute the Pearson correlation coefficient between the mediation model’s
predictive errors and the outcome model’s predictive errors for each of the 4000 posterior error
samples.
Figure 25 shows kernel density estimates of the Pearson correlation coefficient distributions.
The mean correlation coefficient is for each lag close to zero with the 95 % credible intervals
covering zero. Hence, the sensitivity analysis suggests that there is no unmeasured confounding in
the mediation analysis.

Estimation details for modeling extensions and mediation
analysis

Table 5 shows our choices of prior distributions for the parameters in the extended models. The
new parameters are (1) the parameters for the direct effects in the mediation analysis, (2) the
ICAR parameters in the spatial model, (3) the correlation coefficients for the dependence between
the canton random effects in the outcome model and mediation model, and (4) the correlation
coefficients for the dependence between the canton random effects in the multivariate mobility
model. Below we explain the priors for the new parameters. The remaining priors are explained in
Section 1.
As in the main paper, the prior on βl reflects that we expect each policy measure to reduce
log expected trips by on average 25 %. The prior on the direct effect parameter λl means that we
expect each policy measure to reduce the log expected number of reported cases with on average
25 % conditional on mobility, with a variance such that increases in reported cases due to the policy
measures are unlikely. Moreover, the prior on the mean and variance of ψks implies that we expect
mobility to predict half as large reduction in cases once we condition on the policy measures,
but that negative parameter estimates are still unlikely. Note that in the spatially extended model,
the canton random effects are assigned a prior of N(0, 1) due to the BYM2 reparametrization and
scaling of the combined canton and spatial random effects. Moreover, the prior on the spatial
random effects is technically on its conditional distribution given its neighbouring cantons spatial
random effects, not its marginal distribution as it is for simplicity written in Table 5. The ICAR
parameters are assigned priors according to the recommendations by Morris77 and Gelman et al.86 .
The prior on the canton random effects correlations is, per the standard procedure in Stan, assigned
on the Cholesky factor of the correlation matrix. We assign a LKJ correlation distribution with a
shape parameter of 2 which makes extreme correlations less likely. All variables that are also
included in the non-extended models are given the same priors as in those models, see Table 1 in
90

the paper. The ICAR model is estimated via the implementation available in the brms package.
See78 for details.
