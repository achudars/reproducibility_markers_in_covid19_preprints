Abstract
A translational knowledge map of COVID-19, based on the analysis of scientific
papers and networks citation concurrence of terms and keywords of the terms: covid19, 2019-ncov and sars-cov-2 in leading databases (MEDLINE, web of Science and
Scopus), was constructed. Some fields of the research on covid-19 are connected
together, differing in structure, content and evolution.

Introduction
COVID-19 epidemic is an emergent infectious disease caused by respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 and has been named SARS-CoV-2 (formerly 2019-nCoV)
and COVID-19 disease (1-8). Coronaviruses were first described in 1965 (1) by
Tyrell and Bynoe, who cultured the viruses from patients with what was thought
common colds symptoms (2,3). The term “Coronavirus,” which described the
characteristic microscopic morphology of these viruses, was officially coined in 1968
(3). SARS CoV-2 belongs to the B-lineage of beta-coronaviruses and is closely
related to the SARS-CoV virus. Currently, the suspicion of infection with 2019-nCoV
requires two elements as indicators of the case: presence of fever and symptoms of
respiratory disease. SARS-CoV-2 apparently managed to make its transition from
animals to humans at the seafood market in Wuhan, China (4,5). Wuhan, is the
same place where one of the largest biosafety level 4 (BSL-4) Asia´s laboratories is
located, where European, Canadian and American experts collaborate. The initial
clinical sign of COVID-19-related disease that allowed detection was pneumonia.
Observations so far suggest an incubation average period of five days.

The literature on the medical, virology and epidemiology aspects of the COVID-19
emergency are beginning to abound, revealing important pieces of data towards the
understanding and possible solutions of this global problem (4-8). However, very
scarce studies are yet available on the analysis of the conceptual mapping of
coronaviruses, in terms of the relationships among all the data produced in the last
25 years in this area. Accordingly, this present investigation shows an analysis of

the published documents of COVID-19 in reliable sources, including Medline, Web
of Science and Scopus, and the results of the mentioned bases were integrated into
a comprehensive bibliometric analysis, including not only basic and applied
research, but also how this knowledge begins to involve intellectual property (11).

Methodology

The software package Mendeley, a recognized references manager, was employed
to collect 547 items of different databases such as Medline, Web of Science and
Scopus. To map the knowledge translation of COVID-19, we used the statistical
indicator R and graphics, networks and histograms through the software package
"Bibliometrix".

This methodology has proven very insightful to the knowledge

structure of complex diseases cases such as cancer (9) and ebola (10). Figure 1
shows schematically the analytical methodology we have employed (9-10).

Data was extracted from different scientific and medical databases to analyze the
different and relevant concepts that revolve around COVID-19, including 2019-nCoV
and SARS-CoV-2. Then, a data framework from different articles was created, along
with a structure of the involved knowledge, that allows to understand the
relationships among the different variables. Thus, results from the different Medline,
Web of Science and Scopus databases can be appreciated unified and not
separated from each other, as there is the case of the few studies available, which
present relevant data, although disconnected and somehow incoherent. Therefore,

to estimate the relative risk of transmission of COVID-19, we considered the most
relevant scientific databases to estimate the risk of using a single analysis.

Results and discussion

We analyzed 547 articles from the information contained in different scientific
databases, based on the key terms, so the statistical applications determine the
behavior of the variables, as summarized in Table 1.

Table 1.-Contents of the Data Bases

To create a conceptual structure of COVID-19 one requires not only to properly
identify the relevant concepts involved, but also their time and geographical
evolution. This allows to identify that 2020 has been the year with the highest number
of scientific articles, as shown in Table 2. This would be an obvious result, given the
current worldwide concern on this disease. However, the time evolution of the
knowledge related to associated keywords reveals interesting facts.

The origin of the references is very important, to identify the interest and influence
of various geographical locations, as well as the disciplines which were first attracted
to this phenomenon, as observed in Table 1, which provides a first clue that, despite
representing an area of scientific interest and public health danges, coronavirus has
been basically a set of isolated efforts, localized in few authors and institutions who
focused on this subject, with a relatively low Collaboration Index. Certainly, there
are are few single-autored papers, but the great percentage correspond to teams
working consistently in the area for nearly 20 years. The most relevant and most
cited sources are summarized in Table 3.

Figure 2 allows to better visualize the time evolution of the knowledge generated
around coronavirus. Interestingly, and despite that the first reports, published in top
journals, date back to the 1960´s (1-3), only in the very recent past a clear increase
in the production of knowledge can be appreciated, coinciding with the first claim of
novelty in 2014, which has resulted in a patent granted in 2018 (11).

Figure 2. Time evolution of sources

It is also interesting to analyze the most relevant authors in what now is known as
COVID-19, not only by names, but also from their professional associations. Thence,
we find Y. Wang with 21 publications, X. Li with 17 posts, W. Wang with 15 articles,
Y. Yang with 15 papers, among others, as shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3. Production by main authors

Then, the constructed database was filtered by keyword layers: Abstracts, Titles and
Author's keywords, as shown in Figures 4, 5 and 6. Notice that, despite that China
was officially the origin of COVID-19, in the keyword layers the term “China” is not
among the most relevant ones, except when comes to authors. “Coronavirus”,
“Patients” and “Humans” are the leading terms in the literature. The term “COVID”
is also among the most important indicators.

When Centrality is analyzed, Table 5, the term “Humans” is the most important one,
followed by “China” nd “Coronavirus infections”, with the rest of the nodes having
very little contribution. This allows to quantify the influence of those particular nodes
within the network of knowledge formed by all the articles and patents.

Table 5. Centrality of terms

As it could be expected, COVID-19 involves a wide variety of terms, concepts,
references, citations and actions which, at first thought, could seem impossibly to
clasify or organize in a coherent way, given the multidisciplinary character of the
problem. However, as it can be appreciated in Figure 8, it is possible to structure all
the information available into few conceptual clusters, which can be, in turn,
summarized by basically 3 concepts, namely “China”, “Coronavirus” and “Disease
outbrake”. This has been consistent in the last 17 years,which allows to understand
why it not should be surprising that a “Coronavirus outbrake took place in China”.

Figure 8. Conceptual structure of COVID-19

Finally, if we redraw that data of Figure 8 into a conceptual map, Figure 9, which
corresponds to the actual Conceptual Map of COVID-19, which allows to identify the
modularity of the nodes that represent the entire database built from the scientific
information available.

Figure 9. Conceptual Map of COVID-19

Figure 9. Collaboration of the authors.
A knowledge cluster is centered at the origin (SARS coronavirus), while the other
focus on the causes (epidemic) symptoms-free (infant and child), creation of
scenarios (mathematical models) and on the fibal consequences (coronavirus
infections). A translation process of the knowledge in research through a set of items
that link the infection by covid-19 with pneumonia via high degree of infection and
transmission in humans, was found.

Concluding remarks

A translational knowledge map of COVID-19 was constructed from the available
literature data on articles, reports and patents, aiming to provide a relevant vision of

the current stage and an overview of the knowledge structure of COVID-19.
Furthermore, this methodology has the potential to become a useful assessment tool
for monitoring the evolution of knowledge on various emerging disease such as
COVID-19. Finally, it should be mentioned that, despite that the fundamental
scientific fact is that COVID-19 outbreak began affecting China, and therefore these
terms are at the center of the conceptual structure, there exist less visible nodes
identified by terms such as: "war", "biotechnology", "fear", "economic" and
"economy", which appear related to patents (11).
