Summary
Spatiotemporal modelling of infectious diseases such as COVID-19 involves using a variety of
epidemiological metrics such as regional proportion of cases or regional positivity rates. Although
observing their changes over time is critical to estimate the regional disease burden, the
dynamical properties of these measures as well as cross-relationships are not systematically
explained. Here we provide a spatiotemporal framework composed of six commonly used and
newly constructed epidemiological metrics and conduct a case study evaluation. We introduce a
refined risk model that is biased neither by the differences in population sizes nor by the spatial
heterogeneity of testing. In particular, the proposed methodology is useful for the unbiased
identification of time periods with elevated COVID-19 risk, without sensitivity to spatial
heterogeneity of neither population nor testing. We offer a case study in Poland that shows
improvement over the bias of currently used methods and we believe our method can be
implemented in other areas of the world. Our results also provide insights regarding regional
prioritization of testing and the consequences of potential synchronization of epidemics between
regions.

Main Text
Introduction
COVID-19 disease is caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 which was first discovered in
late 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. The main signs of infection include respiratory
symptoms, fever, cough and breathing difficulties [1]. Spatiotemporal analysis plays a critical role
in estimating the disease burden in specific regions [2], and it has been studied in many
countries, including China [3,4], Spain [5], Italy [6,7], Sweden [8], Israel [9], Brazil [10] and United
States [11,12]. It is important to note that comparisons between regions may be challenging, and
this is not only because of differences in population sizes but also differences in health policies
(e.g. testing regimes) that can change over time [11]. For example, one of the most common
limitations raised when using spatiotemporal approaches relates to the lack of incorporation of the
spatial heterogeneity of testing [13‚Äì15]. This omission may be misleading to public health officials
in terms of an adequate public health response in regions with relatively high or low testing
capabilities. From among many measures applicable in the spatiotemporal modelling of the
COVID-19 disease, the following attracted the greatest attention: local [6] and global [16]
cumulative number of cases, different versions of population-based relative risk (observed
cases/expected cases) [14,17], testing rates (tests/population) [18], local [18] and global [16]
positivity rates (confirmed cases/tests) [18,19] and population-based positivity (confirmed
cases/population) [15,19]. Although potentially useful, the above measures were not investigated
for their suitability in dynamical modelling of infectious disease. In particular, to the best of our
knowledge, their dynamical properties and cross-relationships were not systematically explained.
However, this has crucial importance for guiding the public health response: for example, it may
be decided that an uninterrupted increase in cumulative version of population-based relative risk
[14] entails the introduction of specific non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) [20] in specific
regions. Moreover, from the definition of these measures it follows that all of them are sensitive to
spatial heterogeneity of either population or testing or both in their identification of elevated
COVID-19, leading to bias.

This study is intended to offer a systematic contribution regarding a variety of spatiotemporal
epidemiological measures independently used in both comparative [14,18,19] and noncomparative [16] contexts. We reveal dynamical properties and prove relationships between the
commonly used and newly constructed epidemiological metrics with a case study application. The
proposed methodology has the potential to enhance the framework of infectious disease
modelling and provides insights into how a more harmonized management of the crisis can be
achieved.

Simultaneous standardisation with respect to population and testing

The notion of relative risk is often used to investigate the spatial distribution of cases [17,21,22]
and is inherently related to the concept of indirect standardisation [22]. It involves calculating the
standardised incidence ratio (SIR) which accounts for the differences in population sizes among
regions. Typically, this value depends on individual daily infection rates and is calculated as the
ratio between the observed number of cases (infections) in a region and the expected number of
cases based on the regional population. Values greater than one suggest an elevated risk
compared to the population average which may indicate infection clusters or a greater number of
vulnerable groups [17]. To alleviate the impact of daily fluctuations and create a framework for
comparing the present state with historical reference, a cumulative model can be applied [14],
which we refer to as the cumulative standardised incidence ratio (CSIR). It is calculated for a
specific day ùë° as the ratio of the confirmed number of cases since the outbreak of the pandemic,
including day ùë°, to the expected cumulative number of cases on day ùë°. We mathematically show
that from a dynamical viewpoint it is equivalent to the regional cumulative proportion of cases;
that is, for a specific day ùë° and region ùëñ, it may decrease or increase depending on whether the
proportion of cases for ùëñ on day ùë° is lower or greater than the cumulative proportion for ùëñ on day
ùë° ‚àí 1. The limitation of using this risk estimate to compare regions is that it is only unbiased if
there is spatial homogeneity regarding testing intensity. To overcome this problem, we first
applied an analogous procedure for the data related to regional testing. Namely, we calculated a

4

quantity that we refer to as the cumulative standardised testability ratio (CSTR). It is calculated as
the proportion of observed tests to expected tests in a given region. It is important to note that the
resulting value can be interpreted as an estimate of the relative safety. This is because the
greater the quantity is, the more efficiently NPIs can be applied. We then divided the CSIR by the
CSTR to get a refined estimate of the relative risk, which we call the weighted cumulative
standardized incidence ratio (WCSIR). It follows that the WCSIR remains unchanged from the
CSIR only if the CSTR is equal to one, that is, the number of tests is equal to the expected
number of tests. Otherwise, the relative risk increases or decreases depending on whether the
CSTR is smaller than or greater than one, respectively. The resulting risk estimate is therefore
biased neither by differences in population sizes nor by differences in amount of testing in specific
regions. In other words, the WCSIR measure allows testing intensity to be heterogeneous and it
captures the change in relative risk by honouring the following expectations:

1) For a specific region, a risk measure should decrease/increase if the regional
infection rate (regional infected/global infected) decreases/increases and the
analogous test rate (regional tests/global tests) increases/decreases.
2)

For a specific region, a risk measure should decrease/increase if the cumulative
global positivity rate (GPR) (cumulative positive/cumulative tests)
increases/decreases, while the analogous local positivity rate (LPR)
decreases/increases.

Alternatively, but equivalently (Theorem 2, Supplementary Materials), the WCSIR could be
conceptualized as the ratio of LPR to GPR for a given region. Therefore, WCSIR equals one only
if LPR=GPR, otherwise the relative risk increases or decreases depending on whether the LPR is
greater than or less than GPR, respectively. As such, we anticipate our study to be a starting
point for considering more sophisticated models of relative risk. For example, even if the
dynamics of the regional proportion of cases show a positive trend for a given region, our
methodology can classify this region as one with decreasing risk if the local and global positivity
ratios are in opposite directions (i.e. are decreasing and increasing respectively).

Case study motivation

On March 4th, 2020, the first confirmed case was registered in Poland [23]. Four days later, cases
were identified in the densely populated Silesian region [24]. As of August 17, 2020, 57,286
cases were verified in Poland, with 18,874 cases (34.8%) attributed to the Silesian region [25].
The core of the Silesian region is referred to as the Katowice conurbation, a polycentric area
consisting of 16 towns and approximately 2 million people with a population density of 1,485 per
km2 (24). The largest urban centre is Katowice with 280 thousand inhabitants [26]. The
concentration of public health efforts in Silesia follows from its large proportion of the population
employed in industry (28.7%), compared to the mean-country value of 20.6%. Of those employed
in industry in the area, 16.7% are employed in mining and exploration, which is also the largest
value in Poland (mean-country value of 4.6 %) [27].

After the first case in Poland was identified, NPIs were introduced, including cancelling mass
events and closing borders, schools, and universities among other measures [28,29]. These
interventions helped flatten the curve of total infected individuals and delayed the peak of the
disease burden (Fig. S1). However, the lockdown measures applied were ultimately insufficient in
terms of containing the spread of the disease in the densely populated and relatively industrially
oriented Silesian region. Because it is difficult to apply social distancing recommendations [1] in
crowded mine shafts, it is hypothesized that the spread of COVID-19 in the Silesian region was
facilitated by miners who might have acted as asymptomatic carriers. This has critical importance
as it has been demonstrated that asymptomatic carriers play a vital role in the spread of the novel
coronavirus [30] and undocumented infectious cases can facilitate rapid dissemination [31].
Indeed, according to partial results related to 50,053 screening tests within a group of mines
conducted between May 7, 2020 and June 25, 2020 as a proxy for the whole mining population,
nearly 98 percent of the infected mine employees did not indicate any symptoms [32,33]. As of
August 11, 7,934 miners were tested positive for COVID-19 which yields nearly 44% of infections
in Silesian region [34]. Although the time period related to screening tests in mines resulted in

6

greater population-based relative risk for Silesia, two major problems remain: 1) whether the
decision on screening tests was a result of an already deteriorating epidemiological situation in
Silesia ‚Äì with the beginning of this deterioration being unknown and 2) whether in other regions
with relatively low testing capabilities the risk related to COVID-19 disease exists but is
undetected.

We evaluated the proposed methodology on infection and testing rates that were provided by
Ministry of Health in Poland: between March 4 and August 17 (infections) as well as between May
11 and August 17 (tests). The data were provided for 16 administrative regions of Poland
(abbreviations presented in Fig. S2) that span the area of 312,696 km2. Because the official
testing rates were published on a weekly basis, to estimate the testing rates for individual days,
we used interpolation. Other official reports supplemented by reports from news sources (as of
March 26) were also used to perform interpolation for individual days between March 26 and May
11. Complete details regarding interpolation are available in the Methods.

Methods

Materials
We collected daily data on infections in Poland starting March 4, 2020 until August 17, 2020 from
the Ministry of Health in Poland. From a technical viewpoint, the data are stored in a data frame in
which columns represent days, while rows are administrative regions. A limitation of using this
data is that reporting inaccuracies were not always adequately described. Although we applied 18
corrections, sometimes the dates corresponding to false positive cases or detected duplicates of
confirmed cases were not provided. The inaccuracies and the corresponding metadata including
dates of errors and applied corrections are summarised in Table S1.
The data on regional testing are available for the time period between March 26, 2020 and
August 17, 2020. The reports from May 11, 2020 onward were provided by the Ministry of Health
in Poland on a weekly basis in the form of cumulative number of tests conducted for every region.
It should be noted, however, that these cumulative data do not include the full day of publishing
but are restricted to a specific hour of the day. For example, cumulative regional data on testing
published on August 17 cover the time period between March 4 and August 17, 1:00 p.m. We
also used official fragmentary reports as well as an unofficial incomplete report for March 26,
2020 from a news source (Table S2). For days preceding March 26, 2020 no data on regional
testing are publicly available, therefore we excluded this period from the analysis. There is
concern about limited reliability of testing data for Kielce region for which about 241 000 tests
were erroneously registered [54]. Although the correction was applied on August 8 [54], the
historical data were not officially corrected. We therefore subtracted the superfluous number of
tests evenly throughout the time period for the Kielce region. Population census data were
obtained from the official repository Demographic Yearbook of Poland [55].

Estimating relative risk

8

To estimate the relative risk in regions of interest we used the concept of indirect standardisation
ùëÇ

[21,22]. The general formula for estimating the relative risk can be written as follows: , where
ùê∏

ùëÇ and ùê∏ denote the observed and the expected number of cases respectively. Given a specific
region ùëñ, to obtain ùê∏ùëñ it is first necessary to calculate a global ratio ùëü =

‚àëùëñ ùëÇùëñ
‚àëùëñ ùëÉùëñ

, where ‚àëùëñ ùëÉùëñ denotes

the total population. It is then straightforward to calculate ùê∏ùëñ as ùëÉùëñ ùëü, with ùëÉùëñ being the population in
region ùëñ. For example, if the proportion of cases in Poland is 2%, then the expected number of
cases in Silesia would be 2% of the population of Silesia, which assumes a spatially homogenous
distribution of cases [21]. We must now differentiate between two versions of calculating the
relative risks in our study: Standardised Incidence Ratio (SIR), Cumulative Standardised
Incidence Ratio (CSIR) and Weighted Cumulative Standardised Incidence Ratio (WCSIR) based
on Cumulative Standardised Testability Ratio (CSTR).
For the SIR, the totals of observed number of cases and the expected number of cases ùê∏ùëñ refer to
the daily number of cases. If we denote ùë•ùëñ,ùë° as the observed number of cases on day ùë°, and ùê∏ùëñ,ùë° as
the expected number of cases on day ùë°, we can write the following formula:
ùëÜùêºùëÖùëñ (ùë°) =

ùë•ùëñ,ùë°
ùê∏ùëñ,ùë°

=

ùë•ùëñ,ùë°
ùëÉùëñ ùëüùë°

=

ùë•ùëñ,ùë°
‚àëùëñ ùë•ùëñ,ùë°
ùëñ ùëÉùëñ

(1)

ùëÉùëñ ‚àë

For the CSIR, we assume that, for a specific day ùë°, the observed number of cases in region ùëñ is
the sum of the observed number of cases in ùëñ for days ùëó ‚àà [1, ùë°]. Similarly, to calculate the
corresponding ratio we assume that the observed number of cases is the sum of all cases that
were confirmed in Poland for days ùëó ‚àà [1, ùë°]. Then, the ratio is multiplied by the population size in ùëñ
to get the expected number of cases. The CSIR is then calculated as the proportion between the
observed and expected number of cases. If we denote ùëÇùëñ,ùë°‚àí1 = ‚àëùë°‚àí1
ùëó=1 ùë•ùëñ,ùëó as the cumulative
number of cases for region ùëñ up to day ùë° ‚àí 1, and ùê∏ùëñ,1:ùë° as the expected cumulative number of
cases for ùëñ on day ùë°, then the formula for CSIR can be written as follows:
ùê∂ùëÜùêºùëÖùëñ (ùë°) =

ùëÇùëñ,ùë°‚àí1 +ùë•ùëñ,ùë°
ùê∏ùëñ,1:ùë°

=
ùëÉùëñ

ùëÇùëñ,ùë°‚àí1 +ùë•ùëñ,ùë°
‚àëùëñ(ùëÇùëñ,ùë°‚àí1 +ùë•ùëñ,ùë° )
‚àëùëñ ùëÉùëñ

(2)

9

From this it follows that the current value of CSIR is to a large extent governed by the past
(cumulative cases from days 1 up to ùë° ‚àí 1) and the contribution of present day ùë° weakens with
time. This explains why the curves are smooth: the present has a smaller effect than the past. To
sum up, the past contributes primarily to the present state and, with time, its role in shaping the
present increases.
Similarly, the information on the number of tests conducted for each region can be employed to
estimate the relative safety (not to be confused with the safety perspective presented in Fig. S11).
The corresponding Cumulative Standardised Testability Ratio (CSTR) was calculated in an
analogous procedure to that of the CSIR. If we denote ùëáùëñ,ùë°‚àí1 as the cumulative number of tests
conducted for region ùëñ up to day ùë° ‚àí 1, ùë¶ùëñ,ùë° as the number of tests conducted for ùëñ on day ùë° and
ùëáùê∏ùëñ,1:ùë° as the cumulative expected number of tests for ùëñ on day ùë°, then the formula for CSTR can
be written as follows:
ùê∂ùëÜùëáùëÖùëñ (ùë°) =

ùëáùëñ,ùë°‚àí1 +ùë¶ùëñ,ùë°
ùëáùê∏ùëñ,1:ùë°

=

ùëáùëñ,ùë°‚àí1 +ùë¶ùëñ,ùë°
‚àëùëñ(ùëáùëñ,ùë°‚àí1 +ùë¶ùëñ,ùë° )
ùëÉùëñ
‚àëùëñ ùëÉùëñ

(3)

The interpolation procedure was conducted as follows. We first used interpolate_tests
function to estimate the cumulative number of tests for individual days assuming a constant
intercept: for example, if the cumulative number of tests for region ùëñ were 1000 and 8000 on May
11 and May 18 respectively, then the intercept for every day related to this time window is equal
to

8000‚àí1000
7

=

7000
7

= 1000. Then, to obtain the approximate value of CSTRs for individual days,

relrisk function was used. We note that the assumption of constant intercept may not be
realistic but we are not ready to commit to the idea of the best interpolation method in case of
differences in temporal resolution between data on infections and testing. To avoid edge-effects
that are inherent for the interpolation method, statistical approaches including best-fitting curves
could be employed. However, the main disadvantage of the statistical procedure is that one
cannot expect that the official data of cumulative number of tests will be honoured at nodes.

10

The interpolation enabled the weighted model to be obtained through the division of data frames
corresponding to data on infections and testing. The corresponding equation of the resulting
WCSIR is as follows: (ùëÇùëèùë†ùëíùëüùë£ùëíùëë ùê∂ùëéùë†ùëíùë†/ùê∏ùë•ùëùùëíùëêùë°ùëíùëë ùê∂ùëéùë†ùëíùë†)/(ùëÇùëèùë†ùëíùëüùë£ùëíùëë ùëáùëíùë†ùë°ùë†/ùê∏ùë•ùëùùëíùëêùë°ùëíùëë ùëáùëíùë†ùë°ùë†).

From a methodological viewpoint, we note that the curves presented here could also be viewed
as a measure of relative safety in the form of

ùëüùëíùëôùëéùë°ùëñùë£ùëí ùëüùëñùë†ùëò

. This safety perspective provides a better

visualization of regions with lowest values of relative risk that in the CSIR or WCSIR models are
difficult to distinguish (Fig. S11).
Local and global positivity ratios (LPR and GPR)
Because the relationship between local and global dynamics of the cumulative proportion of
positive cases exerts influence on the dynamics of WCSIR, we provide formulas for these
measures:
ùêøùëÉùëÖùëñ (ùë°) =

ùëÇùëñ,ùë°
ùëáùëñ,ùë°

ùê∫ùëÉùëÖ(ùë°) =

ùëÇ(ùë°)
ùëá(ùë°)

(6)

The computational objectives corresponding to functions included in the computer code are
summarised in Table 2. We used the following R packages: dplyr [56], ggplot2 [57],
ggpubr [58], reshape2 [59], tibble [60], sf [61], tmap [62], broom [63], plotly [64]
and magrittr [65].

Results
Unweighted risk

The SIR analysis reveals that in the Silesian region (12 KAT) the relative risk values were largely
greater than one since mid-April and on five days in late April and early May this value was
greater than 3, all before the decision to screen for COVID-19 in mines (Fig. 1A). In the 28 days
after implementation of this testing policy, SIR values were always greater than 3, with maximum
value 6.92 on May 12th and fluctuations between 4 and 6. However, greater than expected
number of cases since mid-April suggest that the outbreak might have originated earlier than the
decision to test miners. Indeed, CSIR curves show a rising trend prior to the decision to
implement screening tests in mines in Silesia largely after the Easter holiday (Fig. 1B). The nearly
monotonously rising trajectory of both CSIR between mid-April and mid-June denotes the
progressive relative deterioration of the epidemiological situation in Silesia for this time period.
Weighted risk
However, as discussed above, the estimates of relative risks presented in Fig. 1 are biased by
the regional differences in testing intensity. Figure S3 shows that throughout the epidemic the
highest testing intensity was observed for the Warszawa region (7 WAR), with lowest positions
occupied by the Opole (8 OPO) and Rzesz√≥w (9 RZE) regions.
According to the WCSIR model (Fig. 2; Fig. 3 ‚Äì lowest part) the Opole region (8 OPO) was the
least safe region during the height of the epidemic in Poland (11 April-18 May), and at the end of
the study period occupies second position, with a significant distance to the third ranked Rzesz√≥w
region (9 RZE). Although positive differences between CSIR and WCSIR for both Silesia (12
KAT) and Opole (8 OPO) can be observed (Figs. 2, 3), for the Silesia region this difference is
smaller and the corresponding curves are more or less parallel (Fig. 2). This is not the case for
the Opole region, whose CSIR and WCSIR curves show a greater difference and a diverging

12

pattern in mid-May: while the WCSIR was increasing during May 13-18 with a simultaneous
decrease in CSTR, an increase in CSIR was observed only between May 15-17. This means that
the weighted risk estimate may increase even if the unweighted risk decreases.
Dynamical patterns
A more comprehensive analysis of the relationship between cumulative measures (CSTR, CSIR,
WCSIR and the LPR-GPR tandem (Fig. S4)) can be conducted by plotting daily values of two
selected measures on a Cartesian plane (Figs. 4, S5-S10). In summary of all sixteen regions, we
highlighted six potentially distinct trajectories that emerged. Fig. 4A shows the ideal situation
when CSIR and WCSIR decrease together throughout the period, as exemplified by the Wroc≈Çaw
region (1 WRO). This pattern can be summarised that although sometimes CSTR is increasing,
the CSIR is decreasing (Fig. S5A). The second pattern for Warszawa (7 WAR) region shows that
the decreasing value of CSIR is associated with an increasing value of WCSIR and LPR (Figs.
4B, S6B). The trajectory of the Opole region (8 OPO) region represents the third pattern: while
the CSIR was approximately constant, the WCSIR was rising fast (Fig. 4C), confirming the
divergent pattern in mid-May observed in Figure 2. We note however that the LPR and WCSIR
show a decreasing trend since June (Figs. 4C, S6C) in Opole region. Figure 4D shows the fourth
pattern with an undesireable change of the trajectory of the relationship, as typified by the
Rzesz√≥w region (9 RZE) since mid-June. For Silesia (12 KAT) (Fig. 4E) we observe the fifth
pattern of a plateau in the relationship after initial growth of CSIR and WCSIR. This may be due
to largely decreasing LPR since June when it reached a maximum value of 10.25% (Fig. S4). The
last pattern, exemplified by the Pozna≈Ñ (15 POZ) region (Figs. S5F, Figs. S8-S9F), shows a
change in direction of CSTR trajectory that started to decrease in mid-June. Although at the
beginning of this change LPR was still decreasing, within a month from this change it started to
increase (Fig. S10F) with undulating CSIR and WCSIR (Figs. 4F, S5F).

Discussion
In this article, we highlighted the properties and relationships between commonly used and newly
constructed epidemiological measures applicable in spatiotemporal infectious disease relative
risk modelling. We stressed the role of including information on testing intensity in estimating the
relative risks of COVID-19 infection, with a case study in Poland. The weighted approach is
particularly useful when spatial homogeneity in testing intensity cannot be assumed, which was
the case in our example. For instance, as of August 17, the Warszawa region was tested nearly
4.5 times more intensely (CSTR=1.66) than the Rzesz√≥w region (CSTR=0.37). Given these
disproportions, inferring the epidemic dynamics from the confirmed number of cases is not
justified [35]. We also show the official statements regarding the Silesia region as the most tested
(CSTR never greater than 1, as of August 17) [36], the epidemiologically safest region [37], or
epidemiologically unexceptional (both CSIR and WCSIR>1) [38] to be false.
The refined results could be utilized by authorities and health crisis managers to introduce more
integrated NPI policies for adjacent regions that can be epidemiologically synchronized [39,40]. In
our case, the similarity between WCSIR values and relatively high positivity rates throughout the
study period suggest that this synchronization may be the case for the Opole and Silesia regions.
As of now in these regions, differences in organising public gatherings remain: for example in the
Opole region, church authorities allowed the organisation of city-wide processions at the Feast of
Corpus Christi (June 11) [41], whereas in Silesia mass gatherings of this kind were forbidden [42].
Because public gatherings played a vital role in the spread of the 1918 influenza pandemic
[20,43], it is now necessary to stress the significance of the joint effect of testing and infection
rates to prevent downplaying the epidemiological risk in poorly tested regions.
We moreover illustrated that incorporating the historical data for calculating the relative risk can
be beneficial to better identify time periods related to investigated trends. Using a cumulative
model of relative risk, we demonstrate that systematic growth in infections already started in midApril, three weeks before the decision to implement screening tests in mines in Silesia. This is
particularly concerning as the lack of screening tests at the time of potentially greater, yet

14

unknown, mobility corresponding to Easter may have facilitated the local spread of the disease
among these mostly asymptomatic and thus undetected carriers. We note however that the
epidemiological deterioration did not affect all mines equally and it was highly variable throughout
the study period: while at the end of June the positivity ratio calculated for a group of several
mines did not exceed 4% (1,862 confirmed cases/50,053 tests) [33], one month later a screening
test conducted for one mine from this group revealed about 35% population-based positivity (156
confirmed cases/452 employees) [44]. Surprisingly, the systematic deterioration and highest
positivity ratio in May for Silesia coincides with a temporal concentration of increase in one
particular mine in which the population-based positivity increased from about 5% (245/4,982
employees, as of May 14) to 28% (as of May 24), to 33% (as of July 29).
The investigation of COVID-19 spread in similar conditions was already carried out in the densely
populated region of Buenos Aires with 13 million inhabitants in 41 districts [45]. This research was
based on analysing anonymized mobile phones and it revealed that the spread of the disease
was radial in nature: from the central city of Buenos Aires, through the suburban districts, to the
neighbouring regions. There are however two major differences underlying the spread of the
disease in Buenos Aires versus the Silesian region. While the first difference is related to a very
specific spatial structure of the Silesian region, the second points at the greater role of industry
rather than population density in the spread of the disease. Other studies have likewise shown
that population density [15,46], age structure [15], and socioeconomic status [11,19,47] among
other variables affect COVID-19 transmission patterns, but this study adds knowledge regarding
how the area‚Äôs relative dominance in an economic sector can play a role in the transmission. We
note however that the mining industry should be only regarded as a proxy of the infectious
potential of large industrial plants and indeed similar events were registered in other regions (e.g.
in 15 POZ region in meat-processing company in early August ‚Äì 313 confirmed cases/800
employees) [48]. Given these plants may attract employees from more distant localities, they
have the potential to synchronize the epidemics at the sub-regional level, sometimes trespassing

15

the administrative borders of a higher level [40]. Therefore, particular attention should be paid if
this synchronization may be the case for administrative regions with different testing capabilities.
The main limitation of this study follows from the incompleteness of official data related to testing
data that are publicly available only since May 11th (see details in Methods). For the time period
between March 26 and May 11, the results of weighting approaches and positivity ratios are
estimated with greater uncertainty and we urge more caution in interpreting estimates at the
beginning of the time period. The confirmed yet unexplained underreporting for Silesia resulting in
about an 8% (as of July 9) underestimate of cases as well as limited reliability of testing data for
Kielce region [49] poses additional interpretation difficulties [50]. An additional limitation is that
there may be other unknown differences in testing regimes influencing the results. For example,
poorly tested regions may decide that only very suspicious cases will be tested which will result in
a relatively high positivity ratio [16]. We also did not include information on recovered individuals,
defined as those with two subsequent negative tests [51] which underestimates the positivity
ratios for the time period in which the number of recovered increases. It should also be stressed
that the theorem regarding the dynamics of WCSIR has the form of an implication, so one is not
allowed to establish a causal relationship between a decrease of WCSIR and either of the
alternatives in the implication given. We stress that the WCSIR can be thought of in two
alternative ways (CSIR/CSTR or LPR/GPR, Observation 1 in Theorem 2). This flexibility affords
opportunities overcome potential difficulties with obtaining population data, which may be the
case if a testing site cannot be easily split into regions with known population.
Because testing capabilities are always limited, the obtained results after weighting could also be
used to consider regional prioritization in the availability of tests. For example, from Table 1 it
could be inferred that the following regions are in particular need for increasing the intensity of
testing: Opole (8 OPO: + 170.53%) and Rzesz√≥w (9 RZE: + 171.41%). A more meaningful
analysis of testing capabilities should however always involve the temporal aspect (Fig. S3) and
the relationship between the epidemiological indices that we proposed and developed throughout
time (Figs. 4, S5-S10). Therefore, we support calls for the radical increase in the identification of

16

positive cases and accompanying isolation as well as encourage behavioural changes and
increase awareness of the disease to help reduce the spread of COVID-19 [31,52,53]. We also
believe that this method holds promise to guide efforts in countries without a robust health care
infrastructure and to counter a misinterpretation of the perception of a high relative risk in densely
tested areas compared to areas with low apparent relative risk due to limited testing availability,
when in fact a high risk of COVID-19 may simply be undetected.

Theorem 1. For a specific region ùëñ, the ùê∂ùëÜùêºùëÖ on day ùë° will decrease if the proportion of new cases
for this region on day ùë° will be not greater than the proportion of all cases for this region on day
ùë° ‚àí 1.
Proof.
Let ùëñ be a specific region and ùê∂ùëÜùêºùëÖùëñ (ùë° ‚àí 1) = ùëÇùëñ,ùë°‚àí1 /ùê∏ùëñ,1:(ùë°‚àí1) and ùê∂ùëÜùêºùëÖùëñ (ùë°) = (ùëÇùëñ,ùë°‚àí1 + ùë•ùëñ,ùë° )/ùê∏ùëñ,1:ùë° be
the cumulative estimates of relative risks for region ùëñ on days ùë° ‚àí 1 and ùë°, respectively, where
ùëÇùëñ,ùë°‚àí1 denotes the total (historical) sum of observed number of cases for ùëñ registered on day ùë° ‚àí 1,
ùë•ùëñ,ùë° denotes new cases for ùëñ confirmed on day ùë°, and ùê∏ùëñ,1:(ùë°‚àí1) and ùê∏ùëñ,1:ùë° denote the expected
cumulative number of cases for ùëñ on days ùë° ‚àí 1 and ùë°, respectively. The decrease in ùê∂ùëÜùêºùëÖ
between days ùë° ‚àí 1 and ùë° may be written in the form of an inequality:

Theorem 2. The WCSIR will decrease if either of the two following conditions in the form of
conjuctions are met (we note that an analogous theorem can be formulated for an increasing
WCSIR):
(i)

The CSIR is decreasing (proportion of infected for region ùëñ on day ùë° is not greater
than the cumulative proportion of infected for region ùëñ on day ùë° ‚àí 1 ) and the CSTR is
increasing (proportion of tests in region ùëñ on day ùë° is not smaller than the cumulative
proportion of tests on day ùë° ‚àí 1.)

(ii)

LPR is decreasing (the ratio of positive cases for region ùëñ on day ùë° is not greater than
the cumulative ratio of positive cases on day ùë° ‚àí 1) and GPR is increasing (the ratio
of positive cases for the whole country on day ùë° is not smaller than the cumulative
ratio for the whole country of positive cases on day ùë° ‚àí 1).

Proof.
(i)
If ùê∂ùëÜùêºùëÖùëñ (ùë°) ‚â§ ùê∂ùëÜùêºùëÖùëñ (ùë° ‚àí 1) and ùê∂ùëÜùëáùëÖùëñ (ùë°) ‚â• ùê∂ùëÜùëáùëÖùëñ (ùë° ‚àí 1), then

= ùëäùê∂ùëÜùêºùëÖùëñ (ùë° ‚àí 1).

(ii)
Let us first prove a following observation.
Observation 1. ùëäùê∂ùëÜùêºùëÖùëñ (ùë°) =

ùêøùëÉùëÖùëñ (ùë°)
