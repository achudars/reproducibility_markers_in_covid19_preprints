Abstract
Mexico, like the rest of the world, is currently facing the The COVID-19 pandemic. Given the size of its territory, the efforts to contain the disease have
involved both national and regional measures. For this work, the curves of daily
new cases of each municipality reported by the federal government were compared. We found that 114 municipalities form a large network of statistically
dependent epidemic phenomena. Based on the network’s modular structure,
these 114 municipalities can be split into four distinct communities of coordinated epidemic phenomena. These clusters are not limited by geographical
proximity. These findings can be helpful for public health officials for the evaluation of past strategies and the development of new directed interventions.

Introduction

Mexico reported its first imported case of COVID-19 in late February [1]. Since
then, COVID-19 has extended throughout the Mexican territory, with over
90,000 accumulated cases and over 10,000 confirmed deaths by June 2020 [2]
The federal government reported a major re-conversion project to increase
its hospital capacity [3]. Due to the lack of pharmacological treatments against
SARS-CoV-2, Mexico, like the rest of the world, resorted to the use of Non
Pharmacological Interventions (NPI) to manage the spread of the disease; these
efforts were branded as the ”National Period of Healthy Distance” (”Jornada
Nacional de Sana Distancia,” JNSD), originally planned to last from March 23rd
to April 30th, and then extended through May 30th [4].
An important aspect of Mexico’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic is
that social distancing was not enforced at the individual level. Instead, social

1

distancing was promoted through the closing of non-essential economic activities. At the end of the JNSD, a transition strategy for the gradual reactivation
of economic activities was presented, which is to be evaluated at the state level.
This regionalization of the COVID-19 response makes sense given the size of
the mexican territory and the heterogenous distribution of its population. With
this in mind, thinking of the epidemic as a single phenomenon throughout the
Mexican territory may not be as adequate as thinking about many parallel epidemic processes, some of which can be interconnected through complex social
dynamics. Strategies such as metapopulation models [5] attempt to reconstruct
these large-scale epidemiological networks at a global scale; however, the detailed description that these require is not readily available for the Mexican
territory.
In this work, a data-driven approach is used to extract this latent structure of interdependences between epidemic processes at the municipal level. An
information-theoretic measure of statistical dependence is used to reconstruct a
network connecting municipalities with similar behaviours in terms of their daily
new cases counts. We identify that 114 municipalities are part of an interconnected network of epidemic dynamics. Furthermore, this network is composed
of four modules with higher within-connectivity. Importantly, these clusters are
not necessarily connected through geographical proximity, indicating that there
are perhaps other sociodemographic and behavioural processes that guide these
epidemic phenomena.

Methods
Data acquisition

Data used for this work is obtained from the Mexican federal government open
data platform [6]; Data was accessed on 2020/06/18.
Daily new cases were counted for each municipality (based on the patient’s
residence), considering the reported symptom onset day. Only confirmed cases
were considered for this analysis. Since there is a documented delay in case
reporting due to the long chain of data capture [7], this analysis was limited
to the dates between 2020/03/01 and 2020/05/31 (the end of the JNSD). For
comparison purposes, daily new case counts were normalized over the total population of each municipality (based on the 2015 inter-census count) [8].

Mutual information calculation

For this work, the time series of normalized daily new cases associated to each
municipality was used. To evaluate the statistical dependence between each
new cases curve, mutual information (MI) was used as a similarity measure [9].
Time series were discretized and MI values were calculated using the infotheo
package for R [10].

2.3

Network construction and analysis

Having the complete set of MI values for each municipality pair, a network was
constructed by connecting those municipalities that have an MI value equal or
higher to a threshold of 0.55. The resulting network was analyzed using the
igraph R package [11]. In particular, module (also known as community) detection was done using the Louvain community detection algorithm [12].

Results and discussion
114 municipalities form a network of coexisting epidemic phenomena

The federal government database contains records of 125577 new cases in the
time period studied, distributed in 1623 municipalities. This curve is a reflection
of the underlying epidemic process occurring within the community. Therefore,
similarity between epidemic processes may be captured by the statistical similarity of these curves. In figure 1, the distribution of MI values is shown using
a heatmap. We can observe that statistical dependence between municipalities
is relatively rare.

These observations are transformed into a network, using a conservative MI
threshold of 0.55 to consider a link between municipalities. Analyzing the component distribution of the network, we find that at this level of significance,
114 municipalities are part of the only connected component, while the rest of
the municipalities do not exhibit statistical dependence with any other. Table
1 contains basic network descriptors of the main component; a visualization of
this network is found in figure 2.

We identify that the 10 highest ranked municipalities by degree include five
boroughs of Mexico City, Ecatepec and Toluca in the State of Mexico, and
the ports of Veracruz, Lázaro Cárdenas, and Acapulco. Although seven of this
municipalities are in the Mexican Altiplano, it is interesting to find three port
5

cities that are not geographically nearby: two in the Pacific Coast, and one in
the Gulf of Mexico.

The network modular structure reveals 4 distinct coordinated dynamics

The 114 municipalities in the main component of the network contain 97926 of
the total cases recorded in the studied period. Using the Louvain community
detection algorithm, we identified that these network has a modular structure,
shown in Figure 3. A possible interpretation of this is that each of these modules has some underlying social, demographic and environmental properties that
somehow coordinate the epidemic dynamic within these municipalities. Interestingly enough, these interdependencies are not limited to contiguous zones; in
fact, geographically adjacent municipalities can belong to different clusters; such
is the case of the boroughs of Mexico City. In what follows, a brief description
of each of these modules is provided.

Module One

Figure 4: Subnetwork of municipalities belonging to Module One

Module One is comprised of 41 municipalities distributed in 22 states (as
seen in table 3). These municipalities concentrate 24304 cases of COVID-19.
It is interesting to note that, although this is the largest module in terms of
represented municipalities, it does not contain any of the boroughs of Mexico City. It does include, however, the capital cities of the states of Chiapas,
Durango, Hidalgo, Jalisco, the State of Mexico, Nuevo Leon, Oaxaca, Puebla,
Querétaro, San Luis Potosı́, Sonora, Tlaxcala, and Veracruz. In fact, in Figure
4, it can be appreciated that the municipalities that comprise this module are
geographically distant.

Module Three is comprised of 34 municipalities distributed in 13 states (as
seen in table 5). These municipalities concentrate 43421 cases of COVID-19,
making it the module that concentrates the largest number of cases. This module contains 6 boroughs of Mexico City, 13 municipalities in the State of Mexico,
the municipalities of Cuautla and Cuernavaca in Morelos, the border cities of
Tijuana, Mexicali, and Juarez, the capital cities of the western states of Nayarit
and Sinaloa, and the the largest cities in the Yucatan Peninsula: Mérida and
Cancún.

Module Four

Figure 7: Subnetwork of municipalities belonging to Module Four

Module Four is the smallest of the network’s partitions. It is composed
of only four municipalities in the states of Chiapas, Guerrero, Michoacán and
Morelos, spread across the Mexican south. Interesingly, these four municipalities
are bound together through the port of Lázaro Cárdenas, Michoacán; previously
mentioned as one of the most connected nodes in the network.

Conclusions

Through this network exploratory analysis of the COVID-19 cases reported by
the Mexican government, we are able to identify patterns of epidemic phenomena behaving in a somewhat coordinated fashion. It is shown that these correlations in the daily cases are not mediated solely by geographical effects, with
connections spanning the length of the Mexican republic. We can hypothesize
that these connections can reflect similarities in the heterogeneous transmission
dynamics occurring in each locality [13]. As such, an argument can be made
that the underlying mechanisms that drive this coordination can be a combination of societal, demographic, economic, and other phenomena with subtle, yet
intricate connections.
It is important to mention the widely discussed limitations in terms of the
COVID-19 Mexican open datasets. The reporting delay has been already addressed and was accounted for in the initial selection of the time period for
the analysis. Another known limitation is that confirmatory testing is heavily
biased towards symptomatic cases that match an ”operative definition” [14].
However, since the data aggregation is mediated by the federal government,
there is some methodological consistency that allows for somewhat fair comparisons between geographical locations; something that is not possible in countries
where such centralized mechanisms are not in place; or for general comparison
between nation states in in which confounding factors abound, making it unfeasible [15]. However, it is expected that logistical limitations may skew detection
of cases toward larger urban areas; such bias correction is currently outside the
scope of this work.
This manuscript provides evidence that the complex system that is the
COVID-19 epidemic in Mexico can be described as several coexisting epidemics,
which may exhibit similarity to other concurrent epidemic phenomena regardless of geographical distance. As an exploratory analysis, providing mechanistic explanations of these observations is currently beyond the scope of this
work. However, an appeal is made to both policy makers and the general public
of consider a much more granular approach to both mitigation and reopening
strategies, as well as to personal risk assessment.
