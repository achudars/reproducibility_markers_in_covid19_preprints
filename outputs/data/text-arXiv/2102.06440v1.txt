Abstract
Many centralized matching markets are preceded by interviews between
the participants. We study the impact on the final match of an increase to
the number of interviews one side of the market can participate in. Our
motivation is the match between residents and hospitals where, due to the
COVID-19 pandemic, interviews for the 2020-21 season of the NRMP match
have switched to a virtual format. This has drastically reduced the cost to
applicants of accepting interview offers. However, the reduction in cost is not
symmetric since applicants, not programs, bore most of the costs of in-person
interviews. We show that if doctors are willing to accept more interviews but
the hospitals do not increase the number of interviews they offer, no doctor
will be better off and potentially many doctors will be harmed. This adverse
consequence results from a mechanism we describe as interview hoarding.
We prove this analytically and characterize optimal mitigation strategies for
special cases. We use simulations to extend the insights from our analytical
results to more general settings.

Introduction

Perhaps the most well known application of matching theory is the entry-level labor
market for physicians. In 2020, 37,256 positions were matched through the Na* We thank Anna Sorensen and Alkas Baybas for asking us the question that sparked this paper.

tional Resident Matching Program (NRMP). The matching process consists of two
steps. First, each physician interviews with a set of residency programs. Second,
programs and physicians submit rank-order lists—of only those they interview—
to a centralized clearinghouse. This clearinghouse, run by the NRMP, matches
physicians to residency programs using a version of Gale and Shapley (1962)’s
Deferred Acceptance algorithm (Roth and Peranson, 1999).
In practice, both programs and applicants are constrained in the number of
interviews they can take part in. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020-21,
interviews were done in person. These interviews were particularly costly for
physicians since they not only had to bear travel expenses but had to use scarce
vacation days. The cost to programs was mainly in terms of the time it takes.
For the 2020-21 matching season, interviews were conducted virtually. While this
dramatically decreased the cost of interviews for physicians, it did not change the
costs much for the programs. We are interested in the implications of this change
on the eventual match.
We focus our study particularly on the effects of doctors accepting more interview invitations without a corresponding increase to the number of invitations
extended by programs. If some doctors accept more interviews and if the total
number of invitations extended does not change, then some of the doctors necessarily receive fewer invitations. It seems natural to intuit that at least doctors
with more interviews benefit from the lower costs even if those with fewer interviews are harmed. However, we show a surprising result: No physician is better
off when more interviews can be accepted than under the previous arrangement.
We prove this for a starting arrangement where the final matching is stable. We
view stability as an equilibrium concept that describes a steady state of a market.
The intuition for this result is as follows. Consider a highly sought after physician; one who is offered interviews at the leading programs and who ultimately is
matched with her favorite program. When interviews becomes cheaper, she will
accept more interviews. However, as she would already have matched with her
favorite program, the interviews she accepts are from inferior programs. These
interviews do not help her: she ultimately matches with the same program as
before. The interviews are, in effect, wasted. We refer to this as interview hoarding. Interview hoarding has a cascading affect. The physicians who otherwise
would have filled these wasted interview slots now interview with programs they
consider inferior. These physicians may have more interviews, but they do not
have better interviews in a precise sense: every new interview a doctor has, she
rates worse than the program she matched with before. Physicians are ultimately
divided into three categories: physicians who hoard interview worse than their
2

eventual match; physicians who receive more but worse interviews; and physicians who receive fewer and worse interviews. The first category is indifferent
between the new costs and the old. The latter two categories are harmed under
the new cost. Thus, when physicians accept more interviews but programs do not
react, the ultimate match is Pareto inferior from the physicians’ perspective.1
Having shown that increases to doctors’ abilities to accept interviews has adverse consequences, we turn to mitigation policies. We consider policies that limit
the numbers of interviews that programs can offer and candidates can accept.
Though there are, essentially, no such policies that always (for every preference
profile) yield a stable final matching (Proposition 1), we characterize such policies
for “common preferences” (Proposition 2). These are salient preference profiles
where every doctor ranks the programs the same way and every program ranks
the doctors the same way. The policies we characterize are such that there is a
common cap on the number of interviews any program can offer or candidate can
accept. We also show that if the programs interview capacities are fixed, say at l ,
then the number of blocking pairs increases and the match rate decreases as the
doctors’ interview cap gets further away from l (Proposition 3).
Our analytical results are suggestive of policies for more general settings where
preferences are not quite common, but have a common component. We use simulations to show that the lessons from our analytical results hold up under weaker
assumptions. Though the optimal cap on doctors’ interview capacities depends
on the parameters of the model—and in practice would have to be determined
empirically—our simulations indicate that it is no higher than the number of interviews that the programs offer.2
Clearly, the main purpose of interviews is information acquisition. Through
this channel, having more interviews can benefit a physician. For example, a
physician benefits if by participating in more interviews she learns that a program
whose interview she previously would have rejected is actually her favorite program. However, our aim is to isolate the effect of congestion in the interview step.
We therefore assume that all agents have perfect information regarding their preferences.We show that an increase in this congestion can have an adverse impact
on performance of the match itself unless either the residency programs or the
NRMP reacts.
1 The

motivating example in Section 1.2 demonstrates that there need not exist a Pareto ranking
from the programs’ perspective.
2 This is true whether we define optimality of a policy as maximizing the average proportion of
positions that are filled or minimizing the average number of blocking pairs.

Related Literature

While there is a large literature on the post-interview NRMP match,3 there are
relatively few papers that incorporate the pre-match interview process. One of
the first to explicitly model interviews in the classic one-to-one matching model is
Lee and Schwarz (2017). In their model, before participating in a centralized, twosided match, firms learn their preferences over workers by first engaging in costly
interviews. They show that even if firms and workers interview with exactly the
same number of agents, the extent of unemployment in the final match depends
critically on the overlap between the sets of workers firms interview. Three other
recent papers that incorporate pre-match interviews are Kadam (2015), Beyhaghi
(2019), and Echenique et al. (2020).
Like us, Kadam (2015) considers the implications of loosened interview constraints for doctors. However, the focus is on strategic allocating scarce interview
slots. For the sake of tractability, the analysis is for a stylized model of large markets. Under the assumption of common preferences, he shows that increasing
student capacities may increase total surplus, but not in a Pareto-improving way.
Moreover, match rate decreases. He also highlights that when preferences are not
necessarily common, the effect is ambiguous since increased interview capacities
dilutes doctors’ signaling ability.
Beyhaghi (2019) also performs a strategic analysis of a stylized large market
model. However, she considers a slightly different set up with application caps
for doctors and interview caps for programs. While similar, application caps are
not exactly the same as interview caps: they constrain the number of programs a
doctor can express interest in at the outset of the interview matching phase, but
not the number of interviews she can accept at the end. In her model, inequity in
the application caps decreases expected total surplus. Moreover, when interview
capacity is low, low application caps are socially desirable.
In our model, the agents do not choose interviews strategically. Determining
the optimal set of interviews is closely related to the portfolio choice problem considered by Chade and Smith (2006). They solve for the optimal portfolio when
an agent chooses a portfolio of costly, stochastic options, but ultimately may only
accept one of the options. If one were to apply the optimal solution to the interview scheduling problem, one would have to pin down precisely the probability of
any given pair matching. This is what makes strategic analysis of the problem
intractable without severe simplifying assumptions (such as those in the papers
we have mentioned above).

The analysis of Echenique et al. (2020) is methodologically closest to ours.
They explain a puzzling empirical pattern resulting from the NRMP match: 46.3%
of the physicians were matched to their favorite residency programs and 71.1%
where matched to one of their favorite three programs. These statistics seem to
contradict surveys indicating that many doctors have similar preferences over residency programs. They provide an explanation for this phenomenon by pointing
out the importance of the interviewing process that precedes the match. Roughly
speaking, the pre-match interviewing process truncates the preferences that the
physicians submit to the actual NRMP clearinghouse. Therefore, a proper interpretation is not that the physicians matched with their most preferred programs
but rather that they matched with their most preferred programs among those they
interviewed with.
Our work is complementary with these works in the sense that they highlight
the importance of understanding the prematch interviews to properly evaluating
the NRMP match itself.

Motivating Example

We present the intuition behind the welfare loss from increased interview capacity
for doctors with a simple example. Consider a market with four doctors {d1 , ... , d4 }
and four hospitals {h1 , ... , h4 }. The agents’ preferences are as follows:
d1
h1
h2
h4
h3

d2
h2
h3
h1
h4

d3
h2
h1
h3
h4

h1
d1
d2
d3
d4

d4
h1
h2
h3
h4

h2
d1
d2
d4
d3

h3
d2
d1
d3
d4

h4
d1
d4
d3
d2

Suppose that the interview capacities of the doctors and hospitals are:
d1
1

d2
2

d3
1

d4
1

h1
1

h2
1

h3
2

h4
2

Interviews are initially offered by hospitals: h1 invites d1 , h2 invites d1 , h3 invites
d2 and d1 , and h4 invites d1 and d4 . As d1 can accept only one invitation, she
rejects h2 , h3 , and h4 . Doctors d2 and d4 do not reject their invitations from h3
and h4 , respectively. Hospitals h2 , h3 , and h4 then offer interviews to d1 , d3 , and
d3 , respectively. Doctor d3 rejects h4 ’s invitation. After h4 invites and is rejected
by d2 , the final interviews are:
5

d1
h1

d2
d3
,
h
h
{h2 3 }
3

d4
h4

The final matching is computed by applying the doctor-proposing Deferred Acceptance algorithm to the agent preferences (restricted to agents they interview
with). The outcome is therefore:
d1
h1

d2
h2

d3
h3

d4
h4

The interview schedule is well functioning in the sense that the ultimate outcome
is stable with regards to the actual (as opposed to restricted) preferences.
Now suppose doctor 1 is able to accept an additional interview (and all other interview capacities remain the same). Doctor 1 now accepts h2 ’s invitation. Doctor
2 eventually accepts hospital 4’s invitation, and the interview schedule is:
d1
{h1 , h2 }

d2
d3
{h3 , h4 } h3

d4
h4

This leads to the final matching:
d1
h1

d2
h3

d3

d4
h4

Doctor d1 does not benefit from the additional interview. Since the original matching was stable, the interview she adds is with a hospital that she finds worse than
her original match. However, her acceptance of hospital 2’s invitation comes at
the expense of both doctors 2 and 3: both now receive worse assignments. In
fact, the final matching is no longer stable. That none of the doctors are better off
is not special to this example—we show that this is generally true (Theorem 1).
The programs, however, are not unanimously better or worse off: h3 is better off
while h2 is worse off.

The Model

A market consists of a triple (D, H, P), where: D is a finite set of doctors; H is
a finite set of hospitals; and P is a profile of strict preferences for the doctors
and hospitals. We assume that there are at least two doctors and two hospitals:
|D | ≥ 2 and |H | ≥ 2. For each h ∈ H , Ph is the set of strict preferences over D ∪ {h },

6

and for each d ∈ D , Pd is the set of strict preferences over H ∪ {d }. The set of
preference profiles is P ≡ ×i ∈H ∪D Pi .
Like Echenique et al. (2020), we combine an interview phase with a matching
phase. The former involves many-to-many matching while the latter is a standard
one-to-one matching problem (Roth and Sotomayor, 1990). A matching is a function µ : H ∪ D → H ∪ D such that µ(h ) ∈ D ∪ {h }, µ(d ) ∈ H ∪ {d }, and µ(d ) = h if and
only if µ(h ) = d . We say that (d , h ) are a blocking pair to matching µ if h Pd µ(d )
and d Ph µ(h ). A matching is stable if it does not have a blocking pair.
A many-to-many matching is a function ν : H ∪ D → 2H ∪D such that ν(d ) ⊆ H ,
ν(h ) ⊆ D , and h ∈ ν(d ) if and only if d ∈ ν(h ).
For each h ∈ H , let ιh ∈ N be h’s interview capacity. Similarly, for each d ∈ D ,
let κd ∈ N be d’s interview capacity. We call the profile (ι, κ) = ((ιh )h ∈H (κd )d ∈D )
the interview arrangement. An interview matching is a many-to-many matching
ν such that for every doctor d , |ν(d )| ≤ κd and for every hospital h , |ν(h )| ≤ ιh .
An interview matching ν is pairwise stable if there is no doctor-hospital pair
(d , h ) such that h < ν(d ) but:
• either |ν(h )| < ιh or there exists a d 0 ∈ ν(h ) such that d Ph d 0 , and
• either |ν(d )| < κd or there exists a h 0 ∈ ν(d ) such that h Pd h 0 .
Two-step process: Given (ι, κ), we call the final matching, which is the culmination of the following two step process, the (ι, κ)-matching . In the first step, where
hospitals interview doctors, we ignore the informational effects and focus solely
on congestion. Given P ∈ P :
Step 1: Interview matching ν is the hospital-optimal many-to-many stable matching
where the capacities of the hospitals and doctors are given by ι and κ respectively. This can be computed by applying the hospital-proposing DA:
each h ∈ H is matched with up to ιh doctors and each d ∈ D is matched
with up to κd hospitals. Since we ignore the informational aspect of the
problem, the input to DA is a choice function for each agent that is responsive to her preference relation and constrained by her interview capacity.4
Hospital-proposing DA is an approximation of the decentralized process by
which hospitals invite doctors in rounds, extending invitations to further doctors when invitations are declined.
4 For

the sake of completeness, we define in Appendix A the acceptant and responsive choice
functions that we appeal to while running DA to compute the interview matching.

7

Step 2: The (ι, κ)-matching is chosen by doctor-proposing DA. The input to DA is the
true preference profile restricted to the interview match, (Pi |ν(i ) )i ∈D ∪H .
Given P ∈ P , we say that (ι, κ) is adequate if the (ι, κ)-matching at P is stable.
If κ is adequate at each P ∈ P , then we say that it is globally adequate. We
interpret (ι, κ) being adequate at a profile P as a sign that the market is functioning
well. Otherwise, a blocking pair could alter their behavior to improve their lot. In
other words, using stability as our notion of equilibrium, (ι, κ) being adequate is
equivalent to the market being in equilibrium.
Finally, we define a welfare comparison between matchings. Given a pair of
matchings µ and µ0 , we say that no doctor prefers µ0 to µ if, for each d ∈ D ,
µ(d ) Rd µ0 (d ).

Welfare Impact of Increased Interviews

Our aim is to study how a change in the cost of interviewing impacts a market.
The starting point is a market that is at equilibrium. Starting from such an equilibrium, the goal is to understand the welfare consequences of a shock that permits
doctors to accept more interviews. That is, starting with P ∈ P and (ι, κ) that is
adequate at P , we consider an increase to the doctors’ interview capacities to κ0
and compare the (ι, κ)-matching to the (ι, κ0 )-matching.
The doctor who accepted more interviews in our example in Section 1.2 did
not benefit from it. Our main result shows that this is true in general.
Theorem 1. Starting at an adequate arrangement, doctors do not benefit from
increases to their interview capacities. That is, if (ι, κ) is adequate at P and κ0 is
such that, for each d ∈ D , κd0 ≥ κd , then the no doctor prefers the (ι, κ0 )-matching
to the (ι, κ)-matching.
Proof. Let ν and µ be the interview and final matchings respectively, under (ι, κ).
Similarly, let ν 0 and µ0 be the interview and final matchings under (ι, κ0 ). We frame
the temporal language below in reference to a hypothetical change in doctors’
interview capacities from κ (“before”) to κ0 (“after”).
We first establish a number of properties of the outcome from the interview
step. The intuition for these results comes from one of the classical results in twosided matching theory: When the set of men increases, no man benefits from this
increased competition while no woman is harmed.5 In our setting, an increase in
5 See

Theorem 2.25 of Roth and Sotomayor (1990).

8

the number of interviews a doctor can participate in plays the role of additional
men participating in the market.
Lemma 1. No doctor rejects a hospital it previously interviewed with.
Proof. Suppose not. In the interview matching step (under capacities κ0 ), let d
be the first doctor to reject a hospital h that she interviewed with under capacities
κ. As d has at least as much interview capacity, she must have received a new
proposal from some hospital h 0 . As h 0 did not propose to d before, it must have
been rejected by some doctor d 0 ∈ ν(h ), a doctor it previously interviewed. But
this contradicts d being the first doctor to reject a hospital it previously interviewed
with.
We cannot say whether a doctor prefers her interviews under κ versus κ0 as
we only have a doctor’s preferences over individual hospitals and not sets of hospitals. However, we show—in a specific sense—that while a doctor may get new
interviews, she does not get better interviews.
Lemma 2. No doctor has a new interview better than her previous matching: if
h ∈ ν 0 (d ) \ ν(d ), then µ(d ) Pd h .
Proof. Suppose not. Let d be the first doctor when DA is run during the interview
step under capacities κ0 to receive a proposal from a hospital h < ν(d ) such that
h Pd µ(d ). As h did not previously propose to d , h must have been rejected by a
doctor that it previously interviewed. This contradicts Lemma 1.
In the classical result, no man benefits from the increased competition due to
additional men and also no woman is harmed. An analogous result holds in our
framework. A hospital either has the same set of interviews; additional interviews;
or she interviews new doctors who she prefers to her previous interviews. In any
scenario, the hospital’s set of interviews (weakly) improves.
Lemma 3. Suppose a hospital h interviews a doctor d under κ0 . If h previously
interviewed d 0 and prefers d 0 to d , then h continues to interview d 0 : if d ∈ ν 0 (h ),
d 0 ∈ ν(h ), and d 0 Ph d , then d 0 ∈ ν 0 (h ).
Proof. As d 0 Ph d , h proposes to d 0 before it proposes to d when DA is run in the
interview step under κ0 . By Lemma 1, h is not rejected by any doctor it previously
interviewed. As h proposes to d under κ0 , it must have already proposed but not
be rejected by d 0 . Therefore, h continues to interview d 0 .

9

To complete the proof of Theorem 1, we show that if a doctor is rejected by a
hospital during the matching step under κ, then she is not matched to that hospital
under κ0 . We proceed by induction on the round (of DA in the interview step under
κ) in which the doctor was rejected, and our inductive hypothesis is that if doctor d
was rejected by hospital h in round k under κ, then under κ0 , either she no longer
interviews with h or she is rejected in round k or earlier.
For the base step, consider a doctor d that was rejected by hospital h in the
first round under κ, and let d 0 be the doctor h tentatively accepts. If d no longer
interviews with h (d < ν 0 (h )), then we are done. Therefore, suppose d ∈ ν 0 (h ).
By Lemma 3, since h prefers d 0 to d and it interviews d , it also interviews d 0
(d 0 ∈ ν 0 (h )). Doctor d 0 does not have any new interviews with a hospital it prefers
to h since h Rd 0 µ(d 0 ) and by Lemma 2 she does not get a new interview with a
hospital she prefers to µ(d 0 ). Therefore, d 0 continues to propose to h in the first
round even under the new capacities and d continues to be rejected by h in favor
of d 0 or possibly a doctor h prefers even more.
To complete the inductive argument, suppose that doctor d was rejected by
hospital h in favor of doctor d 0 in round k under κ. If h < ν 0 (d ), then we are done.
Otherwise, again by Lemma 3, d 0 ∈ ν 0 (h ). Under κ, d 0 proposes to h in round
k or earlier. Therefore, d 0 was rejected by all hospitals she interviewed with and
prefers to h in an earlier round. By the inductive hypothesis, for any hospital h 0
that rejected d 0 under κ, either d 0 no longer interviews with h 0 or h 0 has already
rejected d 0 by round k under κ0 . Therefore, under κ0 , either d 0 proposes to h in
round k or in a previous round. In either case, by round k , under κ0 , h has already
received a proposal it prefers to d . Therefore, doctor d will be rejected by hospital
h under κ0 in round k or earlier.
This shows that if d was rejected by hospital h under the old capacities, then d
is not matched to h under the new capacities. Note that d has no new interviews
with a hospital she prefers to µ(d ). Therefore, if h Pd µ(d ) and h ∈ ν 0 (d ), then
h ∈ ν(d ) and h rejected d in some round under the old capacities. Therefore, h
also rejects d under the new capacities. In particular, under the new capacities, d
is not matched to a hospital she prefers to µ(d ).
Theorem 1 tells us that doctors increasing the number of interviews they accept will either have no impact on the resulting matching or will make the new
matching Pareto worse from the doctors’ perspective. The example in Section 1.2
illustrates that there are instances where increasing the interview capacity does
result in a Pareto inferior outcome. Note that this example is not pathological.
Lemmas 1 and 2 demonstrate the root cause of the inferior match. Doctors at the
“top” of the market—those that are highly sought after—add interviews but every
10

new interview they accept is with a hospital that is worse than the one they will
eventually be assigned to. This is what we refer to as interview hoarding. A poor
final matching occurs when a hospital’s interviews are all accepted by doctors who
will eventually reject it.
Our conclusion from Theorem 1 is that the impact of virtual interviews for the
2020-21 season of the NRMP, if the residency programs do not react sufficiently,
will be a lower match rate. We expect the most highly sought after physicians to
have more interviews than usual while less demanded physicians will have few or
no interviews. It is essential that residency programs either increase the number
of interviews they conduct or rethink their strategies for offering interviews.

Adequate Arrangements

Theorem 1 assumes that the initial profile of interviews was adequate in the sense
that the outcome of the two-step process is a stable matching. We interpret this
assumption as a characteristic of a well-functioning market in steady state equilibrium. A natural question is how many interviews need to take place and what
does the distribution of interviews need to be in order for an interview profile to be
adequate. Of course, in general, the answer will depend on characteristics of the
market such as the ratio of doctors to hospitals and how correlated or aligned preferences are. However, we are able to provide tight characterizations for certain
“end-point” cases which provide intuition for more general markets.

4.1

Globally Adequate Arrangements

In studying adequate arrangements, we first ask about worst case performance:
what arrangements are adequate for every preference profile? It turns out that
only very extreme arrangements satisfy this property. We characterize these arrangements in our next result.
Proposition 1. Arrangement (ι, κ) is globally adequate, if and only if either
1. every doctor and every hospital has only unit interview capacity—that is, for
each d ∈ D , κd = 1 and for each h ∈ H , ιh = 1—or
2. every doctor and every hospital has high interview capacity—that is, for each
d ∈ D , κd ≥ min{|D |, |H |} and for each h ∈ H , ιh ≥ min{|D |, |H |}.

11

Proof. We first prove necessity. Suppose that (ι, κ) is globally adequate.
We start by establishing that if one doctor or hospital has greater than unit
interview capacity, then every doctor and hospital has interview capacity of at
least two. Stated differently, if any doctor or hospital has unit capacity, then all
doctors and hospitals have unit capacity. We denote by ν the interview matching
and by µ the (ι, κ)-matching.
Claim 1.
1. If there is d ∈ D such that κd > 1, then for each d 0 ∈ D , κd ≥ 2 and
for each h ∈ H , ιh ≥ 2, and
2. If there is h ∈ H such that ιh > 1, then for each h 0 ∈ H , ιh ≥ 2 and for each
d ∈ D , κd ≥ 2.
Proof. We prove only the first statement as the proof of the second statement is
analogous—it requires only a reversal of the roles of doctors and hospitals.
Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, there is a globally adequate (ι, κ) where
there exists a d1 ∈ D such that κd1 > 1 and a h2 ∈ H such that ιh2 = 1. Let
h1 ∈ H \ {h2 } and d2 ∈ D \ {d1 }. Consider P ∈ P where each doctor ranks h1 first
and h2 second, and each hospital ranks d1 first and d2 second. All hospitals offer
an interview to d1 and as κd1 > 1, d1 accepts interviews from at least h1 and h2 .
Since h2 = 1, h2 only interviews d1 . Let µ be the (ι, κ)-matching. Since (ι, κ) is
adequate, µ is stable, so µ(d1 ) = h1 , as h1 and d1 are mutual favorites. Therefore,
µ(h2 ) = h2 as h2 only interviews d1 . Note that (d2 , h2 ) forms a blocking pair of µ
as h2 Pd2 µ(d2 ), since µ(d2 ) < {h1 , h2 }, and d2 Ph2 h2 . This contradicts the stability
of µ and thus the assumption that (ι, κ) is globally adequate. We have therefore
established that if there is d ∈ D such that κd > 1, then for each h ∈ H , ιh ≥ 2.
We now prove that if there d1 ∈ D such that κd1 > 1, then for each d ∈ D , κd ≥ 2.
Suppose for the sake of contradiction, that there is d2 ∈ D such that κd2 = 1. Let
h1 , h2 ∈ H . Consider P ∈ P such that each doctor ranks h1 first and h2 second, and
each hospital ranks d1 first and d2 second. As we have shown above, ιh1 , ιh2 ≥ 2,
so both h1 and h2 offer interviews to both d1 and d2 . Since h1 is her favorite
hospital, d2 accepts its offer. Thus, ν(d2 ) = {h1 }. However, µ(d1 ) = h1 since d1 and
h1 are mutual favorites, so µ(d2 ) = d2 . This means that (d2 , h2 ) form a blocking
pair of µ as the only hospital d2 prefers to h2 is h1 . This contradicts the stability of
µ and thus the assumption that (ι, κ) is globally adequate.
We complete the proof of necessity by showing neither a doctor nor a hospital
can have an intermediate capacity.
Claim 2. There is no d ∈ D such that 1 < κd < min{|D |, |H |}, and there is no hospital
h such that 1 < ιh < min{|D |, |H |}.
12

Proof. We prove this statement for the case where |D | ≤ |H |. The proof when
|H | < |D | is symmetric.
Suppose for contradiction that d1 ∈ D is such that κd1 = k where 1 < k < |D |.
Let P ∈ P be such that for i from 1 through k + 1:
Pd1
Phi
Ph1
Phi

: h2 , h3 , ... , hk +1 , h1 , ...
: hi , h1 , ... , hi −1 , hi +1 , ...
: d1 , d2 , ...
: di , d1 , ... , di −1 , di +1 , ...

We have constructed the preference profile P such that:
• For each i from 1 through k +1, di and hi are matched in every stable matching.
• Each of the k + 1 hospitals h1 , ... , hk +1 offers d1 an interview.
• Doctor d1 accepts interview offers from hospitals h2 , ... , hk +1 , but not from h1 .
The first and third points are immediate consequences of the preferences. The
second is a consequence of the first part of Claim 1: since κd1 > 1, every hospital
has interview capacity of at least two and d2 is its second favorite doctor. However,
this contradicts the definition of µ as the (ι, κ)-matching, since h1 < ν(d1 ) yet by
stability, h1 = µ(d1 ).
A similar construction shows that there is no h ∈ H such that 1 < ιh < |D |.
Suppose for contradiction that h1 ∈ H is such that ιh1 = l where 1 < l < |D |. Let
P ∈ P be such that for i from 1 through l + 1:

: di , d1 , ... , di −1 , di +1 , ...

By the second part of Claim 1, since ιh1 > 1, every doctor has capacity of at least
two. Therefore:
• For each i from 1 through l + 1, di and hi are matched in every stable matching.
• Each of the l doctors d2 , ... , dk +1 accepts an interview from h1 an interview.
13

• Hospital h1 does not offer d1 an interview.
Thus, h1 < ν(d1 ), so h1 , µ(d1 ). This contradicts the stability of µ, the (ι, κ)matching, and in turn the assumption that (ι, κ) is globally adequate.
We now turn to sufficiency. If every agent has an interview capacity of one,
then the interview matching is actually a matching. Moreover, it is a stable matching. So, suppose that each agent has an interview capacity of at least min{|D |, |H |}.
If |D | = |H |, then the interview matching involves an interview between every mutually acceptable doctor-hospital pair. This means that the (ι, κ)-matching is the
doctor optimal stable matching under the unrestricted preferences, which is stable. We now show, that even if |D | < |H | or |D | > |H |, the (ι, κ)-matching, µ, is
stable. Suppose the doctor-hospital pair (d , h ) blocks µ. By defintion of µ as the
(ι, κ)-matching, if h Pd µ(d ) and d Ph µ(h ), then h < ν(d ).
Suppose |D | < |H |. Since ιh ≥ |D |, h would have offered an interview to d
and have been rejected during the interview matching step, so ν(d ) contains κd
hospitals that d prefers to h . Since h Pd µ(d ), and µ(d ) ∈ ν(d ) ∪ {d }, this means
µ(d ) = d . Then, d is rejected by every hospital in ν(d ) during the application of
DA in the second step. However, |ν(d )| = κd ≥ |D | and since d is acceptable to
every hospital in ν(d ), she is only rejected when another doctor applies. However,
this implies that when DA terminates in the second step, every hospital in ν(d ) has
tentatively accepted some doctor other than d , which is a contradiction—there are
not enough such doctors.
Suppose |H | < |D |. Since κd ≥ |H |, d does not reject any interviews she is
offered. Since h < ν(d ), h offers interviews to and has them accepted by ιh ≥ |H |
doctors whom it prefers to d . Since d Ph µ(h ), h does not receive a proposal from
any d 0 ∈ ν(h ) during the application of DA in the second step since it finds all such
d 0 better than d . This implies that each d 0 ∈ ν(h ) is tentatively accepted by some
hospital other than h when DA terminates, which is a contradiction—there are not
enough such hospitals.
Proposition 1 highlights a previously overlooked role that the interview step
plays in determining whether or not the ultimate NRMP match is stable. While interviews are necessary for agents to gain information, we learn from Proposition 1
that interviews can also act as a bottleneck. Even with complete information, once
any agent is capable of participating in more than one interview, all agents must
interview with essentially the entire market to be certain that the ultimate match is
stable.

4.2

Homogeneous Arrangements

The distribution of interviews is an essential factor in the stability of the NRMP
match. So, it is natural to consider market interventions when the interview step
is out of balance. Our motivating question is what happens when there is an
increase to the number of interviews doctors can accept. The most straightforward
intervention is to cap the number of interviews an agent can participate it. Here
we consider a homogeneous arrangement: all doctors face the same cap and
all hospitals face the same cap, but we allow the doctor and hospital caps to
potentially differ. In other words, the arrangement would be described by two
numbers: an interview capacity l ∈ N for hospitals and an interview capacity k ∈ N
for doctors. The pair (l , k ) corresponds to the arrangement (ι, κ) where for each
h ∈ H , ιh = l and for each d ∈ D , κd = k .
By Proposition 1 a homogenous arrangement (l , k ) can only be globally adequate if l = k = 1 or l , k ≥ min{|D |, |H |}. Nonetheless, (l , k ) may be adequate for a
specific profile of preferences. One might ask whether, starting at a profile P ∈ P
and arrangement (l , k ) that is adequate at P , if the comparative statics with respect to l and k are consistent. The following examples demonstrate that this is
not so. It may be that, depending on P , increasing k by 1 renders a previously
adequate arrangement inadequate, or the opposite. In other words, the effect of
the increase to k is specific to P . Similarly for l .
Example 1. Either incrementing or decrementing l or k can render an adequate
arrangement inadequate.
Suppose |D | = |H | = 3 and consider P ∈ P such that for each i = 1, 2, 3,6

For P , (2, 2) is adequate: the interview matching is ν such that ν(h1 ) = ν(h2 ) =
{d1 , d2 } and ν(h3 ) = {d3 }. So, the (l , k )-matching is µ such that for each i = 1, 2, 3,
µ(hi ) = di , which is the unique stable matching.
We now observe that if we increment or decrement either l or k by one, the
arrangement is no longer adequate for P . In other words, none of (1, 2), (3, 2), (2, 1),

can be embedded into a larger problem instance.

All four of the final matchings are unstable.

The mechanics of Example 1 are robust and it is not by accident that (2, 2) is
adequate to start with. The preferences in the example have a particular salient
configuration, which we focus on here. A profile P ∈ P has common preferences
if all doctors rank the hospitals in the same way, and all hospitals rank the doctors
in the same way. To further restrict the definition, we also require that each doctor
finds each hospital acceptable and each hospital finds each doctor acceptable.
That is, for each pair d , d 0 ∈ D and each pair h , h 0 ∈ H , Pd |H = Pd 0 |H , Ph |D = Ph 0 |D ,
d Ph h , and h Pd d .7
As we see from Example 1, a result like Proposition 1 does not hold if we
restrict ourselves to common preferences. Our next result is a characterization of
homogeneous arrangements that are adequate for common preferences.8
Proposition 2. Under common preferences, a homogeneous arrangement (l , k )
is adequate if and only if l = k or l , k ≥ min{|D |, |H |}.
|D |

Proof. Let P ∈ P be such that there are common preferences. Let {dt }t=1 and
|H |
{ht }t=1 be enumerations of D and H respectively such that every hospital prefers
dt to dt+1 and every doctor prefers ht to ht+1 . Let m = min{|D |, |H |}. There is a
unique stable matching µ∗ , such that for each t = 1, ... , m, µ∗ (ht ) = dt .
Let ν be the interview matching under (l , k ) and µ be the (l , k )-matching.
First, we show that (l , k ) is adequate for P only if l = k or l , k ≥ min{|D |, |H |}.
Suppose l , k . If l < k and l < min{|D |, |H |}, then for each t = 1, ... , k , ν(ht ) =
{d1 , ... , dl }. In particular, dk < ν(hk ) so µ(hk ) , dk . On the other hand, if l > k
and k < min{|D |, |H |}, then for each t = 1, ... , l , ν(dt ) = {h1 , ... , hk }. In particular,
7 Under

common preferences there is, obviously, a unique stable matching.
characterization of Proposition 2 does not hold for arrangements that are not homogeneous. For a counterexample, suppose |D | = 4, |H | = 3, there is d ∈ D such that κd = 3, for each
d 0 ∈ D \ {d }, κd 0 = 2, there is h ∈ H such that ιh = 4, and for each h 0 ∈ H \ {h }, ιh 0 = 2. For any
common preferences, (ι, κ) is adequate.
8 The

16

hl < ν(dl ) so µ(dl ) , hl . In either case, the (l , k )-matching is not stable so (l , k ) is
not adequate.
Now, we show that if l = k ≤ m, then (l , k ) is adequate. For each t = 1, ... , m, let
t = b t−1
l c. Then, for each t = 1, ... , i , ν(ht ) = {dt+1 , ... , dt+l } and ν(dt ) = {dt+1 , ... , dt+l }.
Thus, for each t = 1, ... , m, µ(ht ) = dt . So (l , k ) is adequate at P .
Finally, if l , k ≥ m, then for each t = 1, ... , m, ν(dt ) ⊇ {h1 , ... , hm }. Since ht ∈ ν(dt ),
ht = µ(dt ). So (l , k ) is adequate at P .
If the hospitals’ interview capacity is fixed at some specific l , an important
policy decision is where to set the doctors’ interview cap, k . Proposition 2 says
that the optimal value for k is exactly at l whether the objective is to minimize the
number of blocking pairs or to maximize the match rate (the proportion of positions
that are filled). Our next result sheds light on this objective.
Proposition 3. Fix the hospitals’ interview capacity at l and consider k and k 0
such that either k 0 < k ≤ l or l ≤ k < k 0 . Suppose P ∈ P has common preferences.
The (l , k 0 )-matching has more blocking pairs and a lower match rate than the (l , k )matching.
|D |

Proof. Let P ∈ P be such that there are common preferences. Let {dt }t=1 and
|H |
{ht }t=1 be enumerations of D and H respectively such that every hospital prefers
dt to dt+1 and every
j |D | ko prefers ht to ht+1 .

Let m = min k , l . The interview matching is such that for each dt , if

and if (m + 1)n < t, ν(dt ) = ∅.
We first consider the case where when k > l and show that the number of
matched hospitals is decreasing in k and that the number of blocking pairs is
increasing in k .
Given P and its restriction to ν, the (l , k )-matching, µ, at P is such that for each
dt , if t ≤ ml ,
µ(dt ) = h(n−1)k +(t mod l ) , where n is such that (n − 1)l < t ≤ nl ,

and if (m + 1)l < t, µ(dt ) = dt .
Let n = min{|H | − mk , |D | − ml }. Given the (l , k )-matching above, the set of
matched hospitals is
{hik +s : i = 0, ... , m − 1, s = 1 ... , l } ∪ {ht : t = mk + 1, ... , mk + n}.
Therefore, the number of matched hospitals is ml + n. Holding l fixed, this is
decreasing in k .
The (l , k )-matching, is blocked by all pairs consisting of an unmatched hospital
and any doctor with a higher index. That is, (ht , dt 0 ) such that t ≤ mk , t −1 mod k ≥

Now, we consider the case where k < l and show that the number of matched

Given P and its restriction to ν, the (l , k )-matching at P is such that for each ht ,
if t ≤ mk ,
µ(ht ) = d(n−1)l +(t mod k ) , where n is such that (n − 1)l < t ≤ nl ,
if mk < t ≤ (m + 1)k ,

µ(ht ) =

and if (m + 1)k < t, µ(ht ) = ht .
Let n = min{|H | − mk , |D | − ml }. Given (l , k )-matching above, the set of matched
hospitals is {ht : t ≤ mk +n. Therefore, the number of matched hospitals is mk +n.
Since k < l , this is weakly increasing in k .
The (l , k )-matching, is blocked by all pairs consisting of an unmatched doctor
and any hospital with a higher index. That is, (dt , ht 0 ) such that t ≤ ml , t −1 mod l ≥

Simulations

Our analytical results are of two sorts. On one hand, Theorem 1 applies without
restrictions on preferences. However, it only has something to say about doctors’
welfare and only in regards to perturbations to an equilibrium arrangement. On
the other hand, when we focus on common preferences, Proposition 2 and Proposition 3 deliver a clearcut policy prescription. In this section, we use simulations to
bridge the gap. This allows us to consider how changes in the doctors’ interview
capacities affect hospitals’ welfare, match rates, stability, and so on, in a more
general setting.
While there is evidence that preferences do indeed have a common component
(Agarwal, 2015; Rees-Jones, 2018), agents care about “fit” as well. Moreover, an
idiosyncratic component is to be expected. We adopt the random utility model
of Ashlagi et al. (2017).9 Each hospital h ∈ H has a common component to its
quality, xhC and a “fit” component, xhF . Similarly, each doctor d ∈ D has a common
component to her quality, xdC and a fit component, xdF . The utilities that h and d
enjoy from being matched to one another are

2
uh (d ) = βxdC − γ xhF − xdF + εhd
and

2
C
ud (h ) = βxh − γ xhF − xdF + εdh
respectively, where εhd and εdh are drawn independently from the standard logistic distribution. Each xhC , xhF , xdC , and xdF is drawn independently from the uniform
distribution over [0, 1]. The coefficients β and γ weight the common and fit components respectively. When β and γ are both zero, preferences are drawn uniformly
at random. As β → ∞, these approach common preferences. As γ increases,
preferences become more “aligned”: the fit, which is orthogonal to the common
component, becomes more important.
9 This,

in turn, is adapted from Hitsch et al. (2010).

lowest at k = 7 (13, 169.59 pairs).

Figure 1: We vary k from 1 to 100 with l fixed at 25.
Our simulated market has 400 hospitals.10 We have chosen the number of
doctors to be 470.11 The parameters for the random utility model are β = 40
and γ = 20. Since our interest is in the effects of changes to doctors’ interview
capacities, we fix hospital interview capacities at l = 25.
Our first simulation results involve varying k from 1 to 100.12 Figure 1a shows
that the match rate increases and then decreases. On the other hand, Figure 1b
shows that the number of blocking pairs decreases and then increase. These
results are consistent with what we learn from Proposition 3. However, since preferences are not common, the match rate does not reach 100% and the number of
blocking pairs remains positive even at the optimal k —that is, the arrangement is
not adequate. Moreover, the optimal k does not equal to l .
Our next set of results evaluate a hypothetical policy of restricting doctors to a
maximum of 7 interviews. We choose this as a candidate policy as it is optimal in
10 The

NRMP match is broken down into smaller matches by specialty. In 2020, among 50
specialties for PGY-1 programs, the largest had 8,697 positions, 10th largest had 849 positions,
the 25th largest had 38 positions, the 49th largest had one position and the smallest had no
positions. This data is available from the NRMP. Our chosen number of hospitals is comparable to
the 70th percentile among specialties.
11 There were, on average, 0.85 PGY-1 positions per applicant in the 2020. Our chosen number
of students reflects this ratio.
12 We have chosen this upper bound to be high enough that further increases have little effect.
Thus, we interpret this as doctors being essentially unconstrained in how many interviews they
can accept.

20

terms of maximizing the match rate (Figure 1b). We compare this policy with the
benchmark of no intervention where doctors are completely unconstrained.
Figure 2a shows the distribution of the number of doctors who prefer their
match under the optimal k over the benchmark as well as the distribution of those
with the opposite preference. We see that the former is considerably far to the
right of the latter. Though Theorem 1 applies only to when the starting arrangement is adequate, Figure 2a shows that the lesson from that result does extend
beyond. Figure 2b shows the same distributions, except for hospitals. Despite
the fact that Theorem 1 does not address hospitals’ welfare, our simulations show
that more hospitals prefer the optimal k than leaving the doctors unconstrained.
The policy also has the benefit of drastically decreasing the number of blocking
pairs. Figure 2c shows the distribution of excess blocking pairs when we compare
the matching under k = 7 to the benchmark matching where doctors are unconstrained. Finally, we compare the distribution of interviews among the doctors
between the two arrangements in Figure 2d. The constraint limiting doctors to
k = 7 interviews binds for many doctors. An implication of this is that significantly
more doctors receive zero interviews when doctors are unconstrained. This is
consistent with the intuition that if interviews were costless for doctors, then highly
sought after doctors would hoard interviews and others would be left with nothing.
We end this section with comparisons of the proposed intervention (k = 7) to a
hypothetical “ideal” world where there is no interview stage and the final match is
based on actual preferences. Figure 3a displays the distributions of the numbers
of doctors who prefer the match under the intervention as well as the numbers
with the opposite preference. Figure 3b displays the analogous distributions for
hospitals. Though the hospitals are typically worse off, the match under interview
constraints and the intervention is not Pareto dominated by the “ideal” match:
typically, many doctors are better off.
Finally, we consider the possibility that the NRMP could set not only a cap on
interviews that doctors can accept, but can also control the number of interviews
that hospitals offer. From Proposition 2, we know that if preferences are common,
the match rate would be maximized where l = k . Figure 4 shows that, even when
preferences are not exactly common, there are still optimal combinations of l and
k , but they typically involve l > k .

Conclusion

The 2020-21 global pandemic has had a significant impact on the way interviews
are conducted. We anticipate that it will also impact the number of interviews
doctors participate in. Through our simulations and theoretical results, we predict
that unless hospitals also increase the number of interviews they offer, the 2021
NRMP match will result in a lower percentage of positions being filled and a less
stable matching.
In future years, the NRMP should consider policies to mitigate these effects.
Our analysis supports the idea of interview caps and our simulations provide evidence that such a policy would reduce the bottleneck created by the interview
step. Such caps can be implemented with very limited centralization, for instance,
using a ticket system.
Even if such interventions are not possible in the very short run, our policy
prescription is that residency programs should be advised to increase the number
of candidates they interview relative to previous years.
Design of a fully centralized clearinghouse, is an area that remains open. As
earlier work on the interview pre-markets have shown, strategic analysis has only
been tractable under very stringent assumptions (Kadam, 2015; Lee and Schwarz,
23

Figure 4: Match rate as a function of l and k

24

2017; Beyhaghi, 2019). Nonetheless, the current paper adds to the evidence
(along with Echenique et al. (2020)) that a more holistic approach that includes
the interview stage is critical.
This interview driven bottleneck is likely a factor other matching contexts as
well, including fully decentralized labor markets. For example, we expect it to
affect the junior market for economists. This labor market typically consists of
short interviews followed by on-campus visits. Physical constraints typically limit
both the number of short interviews and on-campus visits a candidate is able
to accept. With virtual interviews and virtual “fly-outs”, we expect candidates to
accept more of both than they would otherwise. As a result, we could expect the
same bottleneck in the economics job market as in the NRMP match.

Choice Functions for Interview Step

In the interview step, we compute a many-to-many matching. However, each
doctor and each hospital only ultimately matches to at most one other partner,
and each has strict preferences over partners. This necessitates the definition of
a choice function over sets of partners. For our analytical results, we focus on
acceptant choice functions that are responsive to preferences over partners and
constrained by interview capacity. That is, given P ∈ P ,
