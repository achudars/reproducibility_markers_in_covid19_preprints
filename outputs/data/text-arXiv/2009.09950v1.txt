Interactions between COVID-19 and other pathogens may change their
dynamics. Specifically, this may hinder the modelling of empirical data when
the symptoms of both infections are hard to distinguish. We introduce a model
coupling the dynamics of COVID-19 and seasonal influenza, simulating
cooperation, competition and asymmetric interactions. We find that the
coupling synchronizes both infections, with a strong influence on the
dynamics of influenza, reducing its time extent to a half.
The COVID-19 outbreak, declared as a pandemic on March 11, 2020 by the
World Health Organization, is challenging the scientific community, from the forecast
and design of non-pharmaceutical interventions to the fast development of efficient
treatments and vaccines. In fact, at the end of July 2020, there were more than 17
million confirmed cases around the world, which has led to more than 0.6 million
deaths, according to the global data platform developed by John Hopkins University.
One of the uncertainties about COVID-19 is how this infection interacts with
other infections in the hosts. Interactions can be neutral, such that the infections are
independent and they do not modify mutually their behaviours, competitive or
cooperative. Competitive interactions are typically associated with cross-immunity,
such that one individual that has been infected with one disease has a lower
infection rate for the other, although they can be related with non-pharmaceutical
interventions such as isolation. In contrast, cooperative effects represent the
weakening of individuals, such that they are more likely to acquire secondary
infections, commonly known as co-infection; this is something that can also happen
when the symptoms of both infections are hard to distinguish and the patients share
space at the hospitals.
Several mathematical models analyse the effects of interactions between
pairs of infections [1,2]. In these models, individuals that have been infected by one
disease display a modified infection rate with respect to the other disease, such that
the infection rates of infected or recovered individuals are different from those of
susceptible individuals. In fact, interactions between infections have been reported
for pairs such as leprosy-tuberculosis [3], tuberculosis-HIV [4], hepatitis-HIV [5], or
zika and dengue [6].

We model the interaction between the spreading processes of COVID-19 and
seasonal influenza. The independent COVID-19 infection is modelled as a SEIR
(Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered) dynamics, such that susceptible
individuals in contact with infected individuals become exposed with a rate β​c​,
spontaneously become infected with a rate 1/τ​Ec and recover from the infected state
with a rate 1/τ​c . The dynamics of independently spreading influenza is described by
the SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) model, analogous to that of COVID-19 but
without the exposed state, with an infection rate β​i and a recovery rate 1/τ​i . We
consider the deterministic mean-field equations describing these processes,
extracting the parameters from the literature (Table I, [7,8]). The interaction implies
that individuals that are not susceptible to COVID-19 (influenza) become infected
with influenza (COVID-19) with a rate k​i ​β​i (k​c β​c ) (Fig. 1). Values of k​i and k​c higher
than 1 represent a cooperative interaction (known as co-infection), while values that
are lower than 1 describe competitive interactions, typically introduced as
cross-immunity, although this can also illustrate the non-pharmaceutical intervention
of keeping infected individuals in quarantine and, hence, isolating them from the
other pathogen.
The dynamics describing the temporal evolution of the 12 states introduced in
Fig. 1 is simplified in the dynamics of 8 variables: s = [S], e​c = [E​c ]+[E​c I​i​]+[E​c R​i​], q​c =
[I​c ]+[I​c I​i​]+[I​c R​i​], t​c = [E​c​]+[I​c ]+[R​c​], f​c = [R​c​]+[R​c I​i​]+[R​c R​i​], q​i = [I​i​]+[E​c I​i​]+[I​c I​i​]+[R​c I​i​], t​i
= [I​i​]+[R​i​], and f​i = [R​i​]+[E​c R​i​]+[I​c R​i​]+[R​c R​i​], where the brackets indicate the density
of individuals in that state. These variables evolve according to the following system
of ordinary differential equations:

We numerically integrate the equations describing this dynamics, starting from
the initial condition s(t=0) = 1−ϵ, q​c (t = 0) = t​c (t = 0) = q​i (t = 0) = t​i (t = 0) = ϵ/2, e​c (t =
0) = f​c​ (t = 0) = f​i​ (t = 0) = 0, with ϵ = 0.01.
First, we analyse the non-interacting scenario (k​i = k​c = 1), observing that the
dynamics of COVID-19 reaches a higher peak before the peak of influenza (Fig. 2).
Specifically, it takes influenza twice the time that it takes COVID-19 to reach its peak,
with the prevalence at the peak of COVID-19 being 5 times higher than that
displayed at the peak of influenza. We observe that, under this mean-field dynamics,

the COVID-19 reaches all the population along with this infection wave (cumulative
prevalence f​c higher than 98%), while influenza reaches a cumulative prevalence f​i of
44% (see Supplementary Text 1, Fig. 2 inset), such that under the mean-field
well-mixed assumption, the cumulative prevalence of people with both infections
approaches f​i . The simplification of our model of 12 states into a set of 8 differential
equations does not allow us to isolate the number of individuals affected by at least
one active infection, but we approximate it by Q = q​c + q​i , which is a maximum
bound of it and a good estimator as far as [I​c I​i ] is low. This parameter reaches its
peak close to the peak of COVID-19, and displays a long tail due to the slower
spreading of influenza (Fig. 2).
In the interactive scenarios, the COVID-19 infection dominates the dynamics,
and its prevalence curve does not change considerably due to the interactions, but it
influences that of influenza (Fig. 3). Specifically, when the interaction is competitive
for the infection of COVID-19 (k​c < 1), the time at which the maximum prevalence of
COVID-19 is reached does not significantly change (variations smaller than 0.2
days), and it has a slightly lower prevalence (relative decrease in 2% of k​i​=0.5 and
4% for k​i​=2, Fig. 3a,b), with the opposite behaviour for cooperative infections
(relative increase in 2% for k​i​=0.5 and 3% for k​i​=2, Fig. 3c,d), but without
experiencing major changes in the peak prevalence. In contrast, competitive
interactions in the influenza infection (k​i < 1) considerably reduce the peak (relative
decrease in 68% for both k​c​=0.5 and k​c​=2) and the time taken to reach it (from 41.60
days to 15.40 and 15.15 days for k​c​=0.5 and k​c​=2, respectively, Fig. 3a,c), because
as the COVID-19 infection initially grows faster than the influenza infection, the
competitive interaction flattens the prevalence curve of influenza. The cooperative
interaction for influenza infection (k​i > 1) also reduces the time taken to reach its
maximum prevalence (28.91 and 28.68 days for k​c​=0.5 and k​c​=2, respectively) but
increases the height of this peak (relative increases in 500% and 509% for k​c​=0.5
and k​c​=2, respectively, Fig. 3b,d). When we consider the variable Q = q​c + q​i , which
is a good estimator of the demand in the health care centres, we realize that first, the
temporal extent of the dynamics is halved, from approximately 100 to 50 days, and
that this demand is affected by k​i​, such that k​i = 0.5 slightly reduces the peak
demand and k​i​ = 2 increases it in a factor 1.5 (Fig. 3 insets).
Interaction between the infections of COVID-19 and influenza is translated
into a synchronization of their temporal behaviours, driven by the COVID-19
infection, which initially grows faster (Fig. 2). We explore the prevalence at the peaks
q​M and their arrival times T​M in two cases: an asymmetric interaction (k​c = 1, k​i
variable), and a symmetric interaction (k​c = k​i variable). In the asymmetric scenario,
any interaction (k​i > 1), decreases the arrival time of the influenza peak (Fig. 4a).
Interestingly, this interaction makes the prevalence of influenza higher than that of
COVID-19, and it reaches a maximum for k​i = 5.8, with also the influenza peak
arriving earlier than that of COVID-19, such that the influenza prevalence curve
could be interpreted as an early-warning of the COVID-19 curve, arriving later due to

the exposure period. In the symmetric interaction, we find a similar behaviour for
influenza, while COVID-19 does not substantially modify the arrival time of its peak,
and there is more variation on its peak intensity, even if the change of values is
much lower than the observed for influenza (Fig. 4b). We observe an optimal value
for the interaction parameter k​i in both cases such that the peak of influenza displays
a maximum prevalence, interpreted as a resonance between both infection
processes, such that if k​i is higher, the peak of influenza will occur earlier, but in a
moment where the fraction of exposed individuals to COVID-19 is not maximum yet.
Mathematical modelling of infectious diseases is becoming a fundamental tool
for forecasting and policy-making, leading to a remarkable effort for revealing the
statistical properties of the models of spreading dynamics [9]. In fact, the interaction
between multiple infections represents an additional degree of complexity. Our
model illustrates the interaction between two infections described by different
dynamics in their independent spread. We recognize that this work has some
limitations. First, it considers a mean-field dynamics without focusing on the
interaction network, with details leading to a rich dynamics in the frame of interactive
infections in static complex networks [10] or temporal networks [11]. Additionally, we
consider that the interaction modifies the infection rates, while an extended model
would include the effects of the interaction in recovery rates, as observations reflect
that coinfection of SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogens leads to longer lengths of the
hospitalary stays [12].
Research on the interactions of COVID-19 with other infections is still
ongoing. Indeed, the competitive process due to the cross-immunity is controversial,
as the immune system displays different response pathways to COVID-19 and
influenza [13], in contrast to recent reports that revealed that T cells related to the
immune response to common cold coronaviruses react against SARS-CoV-2 [14,15].
Regarding coinfection of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory pathogens, empirical
observations reported a reduced frequency of other pathogens in individuals that
were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (20.7%) in contrast to the frequency in those
tested negative (26.7%) [16], while other observations reported even lower
frequencies of other respiratory pathogens, represented by 2.99% for individuals
tested positive and 13.1% for individuals tested negative [17].
Apart from the biomedical interpretation of the interactions, our well-mixed
framework may include the effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions, leading to a
reduced prevalence of other diseases, such as influenza, due to the preventive
lockdown against the spreading of COVID-19 [18,19], the slowing down of
vaccination campaigns against other infections, thus facilitating their spread [20], or
the disruption on treatment and preventive actions against HIV [21].
We have shown a synchronization process between COVID-19 and influenza.
In fact, correlations between the empirical number of positive-tested patients of
COVID-19 and excess influenza-like illness cases have been reported [22,23], which
could emerge either from considering non-positive COVID-19 patients within those

cases or from the synchronization between COVID-19 and influenza-like illness
outbreaks. Our results reveal how the prevalence information from other infections
may inform us about the evolution of COVID-19 outbreaks and, at the same time,
facilitate the inference of the prevalence curve when the reporting managers are not
able to distinguish between the symptoms of the considered interacting infections.

leads to s​p = 1/βτ, where the subindex p indicates the value at the peak. Considering
