Mobile sensing has played a key role in providing digital solutions to aid with COVID-19 containment
policies. These solutions include, among other efforts, enforcing social distancing and monitoring crowd
movements in indoor spaces. However, such solutions may not be effective without mass adoption. As more
and more countries reopen from lockdowns, there remains a pressing need to minimize crowd movements and
interactions, particularly in enclosed spaces. This paper conjectures that analyzing user occupancy and mobility
via deployed WiFi infrastructure can help institutions monitor and maintain safety compliance according to
the public health guidelines. Using smartphones as a proxy for user location, our analysis demonstrates how
coarse-grained WiFi data can sufficiently reflect indoor occupancy spectrum when different COVID-19 policies
were enacted. Our work analyzes staff and students’ mobility data from three different university campuses.
Two of these campuses are in Singapore, and the third is in the Northeastern United States. Our results show
that online learning, split-team, and other space management policies effectively lower occupancy. However,
they do not change the mobility for individuals transitioning between spaces. We demonstrate how this data
source can be put to practical application for institutional crowd control and discuss the implications of our
findings for policy-making.

pandemic responses, including assisting in contact tracing and guiding social distancing policies
[37, 49, 50]. As our understanding of COVID-19 constantly expands, data-driven analytics have
paved the way to guide safe management measures by governments worldwide [7, 39]. Overall, these
efforts have aided in revising health guidelines and even re-openings to crowds [5]. Unfortunately,
monitoring safety compliance of these policies can be a struggle for agencies, organizations, and
institutions as they rapidly change with new findings.
Sensing location information is a fundamental component in digital solutions responding to
COVID-19. For example, users’ current location while within communal spaces infers crowd density,
allowing operations management to mobilize social distancing measures. Their location histories
help identify places at risk of virus exposure in contact tracing procedures. Much research analyzing location data to combat COVID-19 has been conducted over this short term. Badr et al.
analyzed mobile phone signals from cell towers in 25 U.S. counties and found that mobility patterns
are strongly correlated with the virus spread [2]. Positioning systems using Bluetooth and GPS
immediately became pivotal in tracking human mobility in indoor and outdoor environments [5].
However, relying on Bluetooth sensor data may challenge immediate and mass user adoption due
to the lack of operational readiness. Users must often install a dedicated mobile application or allow
appropriate device permissions. Likewise, GPS continues to struggle with indoor positioning from
receiving inaccurate satellite signals. For these reasons, Bluetooth and GPS-based solutions can
remain challenging to scale. Countries that have made these apps mandatory for their citizens still
struggle with high churn rates, and imposing mandatory mobile sensing solutions would eventually
face pushback in more democratic countries [19]. The ideal is a scalable solution deployed efficiently
without additional hardware or dedicated application installation.
This paper seeks to investigate if location data that is passively sensed from existing WiFi
infrastructure can show the effects of various COVID-19 policies on institutions. Our goal is to
show that coarse-grained WiFi data can sufficiently reflect the spectrum in crowd change when
different policies are implemented over time; thus, passive WiFi-sensing can be conveniently leveraged
by institutions themselves to monitor safety compliance following current public health guidelines.
Particularly, we present findings from analyzing anonymized and aggregated students and staff’s
location data through collecting WiFi logs directly from deployed campus WiFi infrastructures
across three universities1 . Two of these campuses are in Singapore, and one is in the northeastern
part of the United States of America. We employ two key measures, 1) occupancy – the number
of users, represented by unique smartphone device counts, in each building and 2) mobility – the
order of buildings visited by the user.
This analysis comprises data during the initial phases of COVID-19 for all universities in both
countries. Our results show occupancy and mobility changing with different levels of restrictions.
For example, we observe a reduction in occupancy during the period where online learning was
gradually introduced to some undergraduate classes. However, for staff and students who were
on-campus, their mobility rate remained high. In contrast, a significant decrease in mobility rate is
observed during the remote learning period. It is important to emphasize that this work is neither
solving a prediction problem nor proposing an alternative to digital contact tracing. Rather, our
findings show the efficacy of WiFi-sensing technique in regulating institutional compliance. The
coarse-grained data analysis prevails as a data-driven approach to minimize congregation, moderate
building occupancy and crowd movement at an aggregated scale, preserving user privacy. Overall,
this paper makes the following contributions:

and mobility metrics change across all three campuses as COVID-19 quarantine policies, of
increasing severity, are enacted.

using WiFi data could be useful to administrators in deciding the appropriate safe distancing
measures for similar disease outbreaks.

MOTIVATION

Our work’s motivation is to investigate if anonymous location data from production WiFi networks
can show the effect of various COVID-19 related policies, thereby facilitating institutional safety
compliance.
2.1

Background

Close contact and congregations are highly discouraged during the pandemic outbreak since
COVID-19 can spread from person-to-person through respiratory droplets or by breathing in
contaminated air. Some studies have reported that the virus can remain airborne over longer
time periods, especially in indoor spaces where it may be likely to have reduced ventilation [9].
The virus poses a direct threat to high population density areas, particularly work and education
environments. Now, more than ever, precise indoor positioning capabilities are necessitated in
these environments to model human mobility and identify areas at risk of disease spread.
College Outbreak. One of the earliest virus outbreaks among college students was determined in
March 2020, when 64 students were diagnosed positive with COVID-19 as they returned to the United
States from their Spring break [20]. This outbreak was effectively controlled with swift cooperation
and compliance between the university and public health officials. However, by July 2020, it was
reported that 6,600 COVID-19 cases linked to 270 colleges nationwide had begun to spread even
before the Fall semester – proving university campuses as highly vulnerable to the disease outbreak
[43]. As universities scrambled for campus closure, they were simultaneously pressured to respond
to new public health strategies and requirements [47], ranging from implementing restrictions
on population movement to creating makeshift quarantine sites [33]. More recently, the New
York Times reported on the success of major Singapore universities preventing the spread of
COVID-19. Specifically, the Singapore universities developed monitoring systems to help residents
comply with zone restrictions and other safety measures [44]. Simultaneously, the US Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has provided several revisions on guidelines with
which educational institutions must comply to reopen safely [8]. Among these operation plans
are decreasing occupancy in areas with limited indoor ventilation, staggering use, and restricting
occupancy rate in shared spaces. The complexity of adapting rapidly changing rules and monitoring
institutional compliance offers unprecedented mobile sensing opportunities to aid universities in
making more informed decisions.
2.2

Digital Technologies for Monitoring COVID-19

The public health response to COVID-19 since its outbreak has quickly tapped into digital solutions
to support various use-cases from public awareness to management protocols for different end-user
groups such as the general public, facility administrators, and case investigators, respectively.
Fundamentally, these efforts rely on localization and tracking methods to reduce the virus spread.
This is particularly important as different countries, states, and even organizations enact a slew of
policies they believe are best for them [34].
Several COVID-19 trackers are available online, showing the number of infections per country
[3, 10, 35, 51], the spread rate [41], and possible ways to exit lockdown across the world [52]. At

present, many crowd surveillance solutions used to support COVID-19 safety compliance leverage
video, footfall counter, and a combination of IoT sensors to measure crowd density, monitor crowd
movement and the usage rate of facilities [1]. Real-time crowd density apps utilizing occupancy
sensors, cameras, and ticket validations are also piloted in European cities to help commuters make
well-informed decisions on the best travel routes and times [6].
Location and Mobile Sensing. One of the earliest analyses using mainly location data from the
user’s smartphone investigated the cluster of COVID-19 cases in an office block in South Korea
[37]. Confirmed case-patients supplied their GPS information and were notified of the nearest
screening center to get tested. Mobile phones quickly became key for exposure notifications and
safety guidelines [2, 5, 19]. Simultaneously, Singapore mandated mobile check-ins at public spaces
[49]. It also released the first nationwide Bluetooth-enabled app in the world for its government
to trace users near a case-patient within indoor and outdoor spaces [50]. The biggest concern
with mandating any client-centric sensing solution for COVID-19 surveillance is that urgent and
mass user adoption will be critical to ensure data reliability and effectiveness are on par. Instead,
these applications are more likely to receive strong pushback among democratic communities
over privacy concerns [19]. It remains necessary to discover approaches that bypass client-side
installation to accommodate large-scale sensing without compromising user privacy.
2.3

Why WiFi?

This analysis is inspired by prior work that leverages a network-centric sensing approach, specifically
collecting data directly from the WiFi infrastructure to analyze and understand different settings.
These works include analyzing the flow of people through buildings [45], how people move in
groups [16, 40], shopper behavior [13], and even the psychological state of individuals [53]. In what
follows, we describe our design considerations to adopt a similar technique.
Design Rationale. Mobile phones have become ubiquitous in our daily lives, presenting many
opportunities for behavioral sensing. Prior studies on using the “phone as a sensor” have gained
new behavioral data [12, 36, 48]. For example, smartphone use is prevalent among university students constituting the largest demographic of smartphone users [4]. At the same time, WiFi-based
networks have achieved near-ubiquitous coverage in campus buildings and outdoor spaces, accommodating to increasing student demands for learning and leisure activities [23]. The ubiquitous
availability of “phone as a sensor” for user behavior and WiFi-based networks as the sensing
medium provides an ideal technology platform for our work.
Mobile phone sensing comes in two forms: client-based and network-based. In client-based
approaches, sensing is performed directly from the phone. Such sensing requires either OS support or
a client-side mobile app (running continuously in the background) to perform sensing measurements.
GPS is an example of a client-side sensing method using the OS (and GPS chip) to localize the
phone. Bluetooth operates in similar ways and has been used for proximity sensing in digital
contact tracing tools during the COVID-19 pandemic. Network-based phone sensing, on the other
hand, involves using the wireless network for sensing measurements. Many of these approaches
are passive – which means they do not require active user involvement and can be performed via
passive observations of the device. Network approaches have been used for indoor positioning
systems (IPS) where multiple WiFi access points (APs) within range of the phone can “triangulate”
the phones location [15].
As we will discuss in Section 3.2, the ability to use WiFi as a network-side positioning system
is a key technology enabler for our research. Specifically, when a (user’s) smartphone connects
to an access point, it follows that its current location is within the vicinity of a nearby AP. Since
enterprise WiFi networks log each connection made by mobile devices to each of their APs, this

log can be analyzed to infer crowd movement patterns across campus and the occupancy levels in
different buildings (based on the number of smartphones connecting to each AP).
Table 1 summarizes the comparison between Bluetooth/GPS-based sensing (client-centric), more
commonly adopted by present solutions, and WiFi-based sensing (network-centric) technique. Our
choice for sensing must be straightforward in overcoming the key adoption challenges faced by
existing client-centric applications. Specifically, the sensing approach must:
(1) Take The Path Of Least Resistance: Users need not install a dedicated mobile application
or allow device permissions, such as what is required for Bluetooth or GPS-based sensing
applications. Without any explicit user interaction, our technique can automatically discover
and scan connected devices, making it much easier to deploy at scale.
(2) Bypass User Device for Data Collection: In the same way that no user action is required
above, no user device will be accessed for data collection. Instead, WiFi network events,
such as “syslog” and ”RTLS events” will be collected directly from the WiFi infrastructure.
These events are already commonly used by many enterprise networks for IT security and
performance monitoring.
(3) Immediately Operate in Enclosed Areas: Operability, especially in indoor spaces, remains
a challenge by GPS-based techniques due to inaccurate satellite signals. Bluetooth-based
applications heavily depend on setting up BLE beacons within the vicinity. In contrast,
wireless networks are increasingly popular and available, specifically in work and education
environments. Sensing location, however, is limited to users within the target environment.
Challenges. WiFi-based sensing is not without several challenges. A key assumption of our work is
ubiquitous phone availability, in that every campus user has a smartphone with them at all times.
This directly implies that our sensing mechanism will overlook a user with no phone. Nevertheless,
much research has argued for a high percentage of smartphone users, particularly on college
campuses [4]. A second assumption is ubiquitous network coverage, in that WiFi coverage is present
in all spaces where mobile sensing needs to be performed. With increasing and improving WiFi
deployments on college campuses to meet student demands [23], it is reasonable to assume a
near-universal WiFi coverage inside campus buildings. However, WiFi availability outdoors can
vary with AP placements that are typically indoors. It is important to note that our goal is to

monitor safety compliance following current public health guidelines, specifically in enclosed areas
where COVID-19 spread will pose more risk to occupants.
Smartphone users utilizing cellular data will present as unconnected mobile devices in our approach.
Despite widely available cellular data coverage, the WiFi network is still a preferred alternative
provisioned for many online activities that demand low latency and high bandwidth networks. These
activities include video/ music streaming and online gaming, which are enthusiastically engaged
by students. A different source of unconnected mobile devices is visitors. While visitors of the
university may not utilize the campus WiFi, their device remains visible to the WiFi network. This is
because both iOS and Android devices are set to scan for available WiFi networks periodically (even
though no connection is established), albeit with an anonymous MAC address. Logs of unconnected
devices make precise monitoring challenging, but these records can still present as coarse-grained
information approximating visitor occupants. Nonetheless, a natural course of handling crises such
as COVID-19 is clamping down on visitors (e.g., cancel open-houses and conferences) to prevent
the spread outside the population. Our work proceeds to manage the occupancy and mobility of
university residents who must resume their day-to-day work/school practices. Note that moving
forward, we refer to unconnected devices as ‘unassociated devices.’
A final challenge is coarse-grained positioning because WiFi networks can only yield positions at
the granularity of AP location. While precise location (and proximity) information is important
for digital contact tracing, this requirement is not necessary to achieve our goal. Our focus is
on analyzing aggregated occupancy trends and the overall mobility patterns across the campus
environment, to which coarse-grained position information is more than adequate.
2.4

Privacy and Ethical Considerations

Despite the noble intentions of combating COVID-19, most digital solutions present the challenges
of user privacy. WiFi-based sensing is no different, particularly since users’ WiFi network data will
automatically be collected and analyzed when they are within the vicinity. Unlike most mobile
sensing efforts for COVID-19, we hope to determine WiFi-based sensing as a feasible way for
institutions to monitor and maintain compliance with current public health standards – this
monitoring is accomplished at an aggregated scale and does not require identifying individual
users occupying the facility. All identifiable information of users is anonymized and cannot be
reverse-engineered. The main data source for our analysis, at present, is already being collected by
network security administrators. Nonetheless, several privacy safeguards already exist to be put
into practice. They are:
(1) No access to user device: Many users are likely unaware of the types and frequency of
data being collected from their mobile devices. Indeed, no data will be transmitted directly
from the user’s device through WiFi-sensing. Instead, our analysis will strictly utilize WiFi
network data that is already collected by deployed wireless infrastructures. The frequency
of data collection is constrained to the time users are within the vicinity. All identifiable
information in the WiFi network data, particularly the MAC ID and username (if any), is
anonymized using the SHA-2 hash.
(2) Established network security protocol: As recommended by the National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST), enterprise network security analysis is the best practice
to build strong cybersecurity and protect an organization. Indeed, a variety of security logs,
including WiFi network data, are already being used for auditing, supporting investigations,
and identifying operational trends [17]. The need for this security protocol has led to laws
and regulations compelling organizations to protect user privacy. Utilizing the same data
source for COVID-19 safety compliance will follow the same established security standards.

(3) Emergency use authorization: It is important to note that our analysis, purposed for
institutional safety compliance, is presented at an aggregated scale and does not include
pinpointed behaviors. However, this information may be deemed critical to further a contact
tracing investigation. In such an event, emergency disclosures will be handled by an authorized official. We believe a formal operational protocol to assess risk variations must be in
place before any information disclosure. Only when an individual is identified as at-risk can
a public health case investigator obtain a de-anonymized copy of the information.
Data Ethics. All data used in this paper was obtained directly from the campus infrastructure
and bounded by the computing agreements agreed to by each WiFi user when they received
their WiFi credentials. These agreements allowed us to use their data for aggregate analysis as
long as individual identifiers were not used. As such, every MAC address obtained from the WiFi
infrastructure was hashed using a consistent 1-way hash function, and no specific user details (e.g.,
login IDs) were used. All of the analysis used by this paper focuses on large aggregates with no
analysis of specific individuals performed.

DATA COLLECTION AND METHODOLOGY

Our approach is using WiFi data to infer occupancy and mobility. In what follows, we state our
assumptions and pre-processing steps, prior to clarifying the key measures.
3.1

Data Collection

Our data sets were collected directly from the production WiFi networks of three different university
campuses. Two of these campuses (𝑆𝑀𝑈 and 𝑁𝑈 𝑆) are in Singapore, and the last one (𝑈 𝑀𝐴𝑆𝑆) is
in the Northeastern portion of the United States of America. Two campuses are full-sized residential
campuses with over 200 buildings each and ≈40K to 50K students and staff while the last university
is a small non-residential establishment with ≈ 10,000 students and staff spread across seven
buildings.

All three universities run Aruba-equipment supplied WiFi networks with one university also
running a Cisco-equipment supplied WiFi network in addition to an Aruba network. For the Aruba
networks, we pulled the WiFi data directly from the infrastructure using either real-time location
services (RTLS) APIs [32] or by reading the system logs directly. For the Cisco network, we pulled
WiFi data directly from the network using the Cisco Connected Devices (CMX) Location API v3 [42]
(recently rebranded as Cisco DNA Spaces). In all cases, we obtained the following information: for
all associated WiFi devices, the timestamp when the associated device was seen, the BSSID of the
Access Point (AP) that saw the device, and the hashed client MAC address of the associated device.
For two of the campuses, we can also obtain the same information (time seen, BSSID that saw the
device, and hashed client MAC) for unassociated devices as well – i.e., devices with WiFi on that
are just scanning.
For all three campuses, we have associated device data from Feb 2020 onwards. This allows us
to have a very clear view of campus occupancy and mobility patterns across campus both before,

during, and after COVID-19 related measures were implemented. Table 2 provides details of each of
the three campuses as well as the data collected.
3.2

Using WiFi Positioning System

Key Assumptions. As described in Section 2.3, our analysis is based on the key assumption that most
of our users frequently utilize campus WiFi on their own smartphones. A separate analysis on our
US campus, 𝑈 𝑀𝐴𝑆𝑆, reported approximately 90% university residents carrying a smartphone with
them at all times; specifically, our WiFi network events revealed 30,084 users comprising 24,791
student users and 5293 staff/faculty [redacted]. The remaining 10% neither owned a smartphone
nor chose to use the campus WiFi. Like COVID-19 digital contact-tracing apps, a critical obstacle in
enabling an effective crowd monitoring solution is mass user adoption. While our key assumption
naturally disregards a small percentage of users, the approach can achieve a critical mass of data
and ascertain some occupancy and mobility measures among smartphone users. In what follows,
we describe how different mobile users can be tracked.
Pre-processing. We maintain similar pre-processing steps to extract information on human mobility
for all campuses. For all WiFi enterprise networks deployed in the three universities, each AP on
the network internally keeps a log of association, disassociation, authorization, and un-authorization
activities with the devices that help us compute occupancy at various locations. An AP system log
or “syslog” comprises a sequence of timestamped events. Each of these events follows the format:
hh:mm:ss <controller_name> <process_id> <event_subtype> <MAC_addr> <event_body>
For each event in syslog, an event_subtype representing the network event type is specified.
This code can be recorded as six event types. They are association, disassociation, re-association,
authentication, deauthentication, and drift events. Based on time (i.e., timestamp) and AP location,
defined by controller_name and event_body, we can compute connection sessions per device across
all APs [45]. For each device, we create a timestamp indexed sequence of sessions to acquire device
trajectories. Combining these data sets helps us to characteristically produce user-profiles (e.g.,
authenticated users as university residents) and activities (i.e., occupancy at a dedicated location or
transitioning between locations). Note that MAC_addr is anonymized, as described in Section 2.4.
On-campus Deployment. We illustrate how network events (when the smartphone is connected to
the campus WiFi) will produce time-based traces in Figure 1. A deployment of an enterprise WiFi
network consists of many access points (AP), optimally spread across buildings and floors.

When a user, situated in Building 2, first utilizes the campus WiFi network on their own smartphone, authentication will occur (through their student ID and password), resulting in an authentication and deauthentication log messages. Note, however, student identification is hashed to preserve
user privacy (see Section 2.4). Simultaneously, this action triggers the device to connect with the
nearest AP, generating association log messages. The device continues to stay connected to the AP
until the user moves; in this case, the connection switches to the next nearest AP to where the user
is now situated. Accordingly, disassociation, re-association, and drift log messages will be generated
when the user’s device moves out of range, reconnects from ‘sleeping.’ Throughout the whole time,
the user maintains the same network connection to the campus WiFi, only switching APs.
In Section 2.3, we discuss the challenges of accounting for unconnected devices, specifically
devices that remain connected to their personal cellular network. This group of users will still be
accounted for as long as their devices are scanning for WiFi network (i.e., unassociated devices). It
is important to note, however, our main analysis only consists of associated devices, representing
university staff and students. There are two other sources of error from utilizing this technique.
First, a smartphone may maintain its existing connection to an AP due to good signal strength even
though the user has moved. This error makes no impact on occupancy since we are counting on per
floor/building basis, but will produce small errors on mobility. Second, a user may connect multiple
devices (e.g. smartphone, laptop, wearable) to an AP at once. However, duplicated events can be
removed [46], while device types can be further filtered to only collect one specific type if needed.
This methodology has been validated by others [13, 21, 46, 53] and used for similar applications of
mall analytic and queue management [15].
3.3

Inferring Occupancy and Mobility Using WiFi Logs

A campus network comprises several user types such as faculty, staff, students, on-campus student residents, and visitors. The syslog authentication event consists of login types, thus helps
differentiate a faculty/staff from a student. We further subdivide user groups based on the following rules. Students who spend more than 5 hours at an on-campus residential dormitory will be
classified as on-campus student residents. Visitors are classified in several ways. First, records of
anonymous MAC addresses are regarded as visitors (see Section 2.3). Second, users recorded with
only a one-time login or devices with only several days of login over the course of the semester are
most likely visitors. This heuristic is necessary to filter out users attending one-time events such as
hack-a-thons, open houses, and conferences held on campus.

on associated devices (line) and unassociated devices (dashed line) on school days prior to the COVID-19
outbreak. Both areas are located in the same building within the 𝑆𝑀𝑈 campus.

Zakaria, et al.

We determine occupancy as the average number of people in a dedicated area every hour. It
also refers to the occupancy density or population density. By taking the average per hour, our
features avoid the problem of missing data, common in longitudinal data collection procedures.
The number of people is defined by the number of unique device counts (smartphones) logged in
our WiFi network records. Occupancy can be measured at a building or room-level, based on the
desired granularity.
Figure 2 plots the daily occupancy of two areas in 𝑆𝑀𝑈 , 1) the concourse (a pathway that
connects all seven university buildings from the underground) and 2) the campus dining hall,
between January 6 to January 16, 2020. Note that the period selected is before the first COVID-19
case was reported in Singapore to show the expected occupancy during a normal semester. The
graph further separates occupancy by university residents and visitors.
On a different scale, occupancy reveals cues about the clusters across spaces on each floor per
building. Figure 3 depicts a floor map in Building 2 at two time periods, one in the early morning
and the other during school hours. By directly pulling network event logs of the AP nearest to Study
Area 1, we can determine 2 unique devices connected between 3:00 AM - 4:00 AM, indicating low
building occupancy. In contrast, logs between 1:00 PM - 2:00 PM on a Monday show the expected
high occupancy (e.g., 73 device connections at Study Area 1) from students engaging in seminars
and studying activities throughout the hour.

Fig. 3. Heat map of a floor in Building 2 within the 𝑆𝑀𝑈 campus. The left map displays occupancy density
in the early morning, while the right map displays occupancy during a regular school hour. Note that AP
representation is not to its precise placement.

Mobility is defined as the average number of areas visited by a user per hour; once again, it can be
measured at a building or room-level. Figure 4 shows the floor map of a campus building in 𝑈 𝑀𝐴𝑆𝑆,
comprising individual office units, classroom, and open space. As a user moves around the floor
through each AP 1 to 5 - indicated by the red arrow line in figure 4(a), we observe changing network
events from the device, generating association and disassociation events across different APs. For
this experiment the user stayed under each of the marked AP for 15 minutes. The comparison

APs are close to each other. For movements from AP 2 onwards, we observe that the connection
(of the phone) hops instantly as the user moves to the new AP. We recognize the tendency of our
approach to overlook quick transitions when AP switching occurs in less than 3 minutes. We have
determined that this behavior is most likely due to different settings for roaming aggressiveness
in the device model/OS/version, making some phones hop between APs more than others. While
roaming aggressiveness and AP closeness might result in errors at a room-level analysis, our
approach remains applicable for capturing building-level transitions.

259 device transitions were made from Building 2 alone. It is important to note that Building 7

distributed across buildings between 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM. For example, occupants recorded to be

in Building 2 during that hour had visited Building 7 (288), 5 (170), and 6 (64 devices) before their
transition.
Conclusively, understanding occupancy and mobility differences between different time periods
could conceivably pinpoint the respective university administrations to buildings (or even floors
of buildings) that receive high foot traffic. In the next section, we investigate the adequacy of
WiFi data in revealing occupancy and mobility changes when safety measures were enforced upon
universities.

effectiveness of various safety measures put in place at significant times points of COVID-19. These
time points are summarised in Table 3.

policies to prevent high infection rates of COVID-19 while minimizing significant disruptions to
the daily routines of its residents. The first case of COVID-19 in Singapore was reported on 22nd
January, and more cases started appearing over the next few days. As shown in the subsequent
phases (𝑃𝑆 1 to 𝑃𝑆 4), Singapore’s MOH took increasingly strong measures to contain the spread
of infection. These measures included mandatory stay-at-home quarantine orders for visitors,
moving all academic programs online, to enforcing country-wide stay-at-home orders. Additionally,
numerous facilities across Singapore were re-purposed as quarantine centres. For this analysis,
several dormitory blocks at the 𝑁𝑈 𝑆 campus were re-purposed for this use in early May 2020 [38].
4.2

Impact of Different Policies on Occupancy

We first computed the drop in campus occupancy in Singapore as each phase of COVID-19 related
policies were enacted. Figure 6 plots the unique device counts for one building within the Singapore
universities, 𝑆𝑀𝑈 and 𝑁𝑈 𝑆, over the COVID-19 phases, 𝑃𝑆 𝑂 to 𝑃𝑆 4. We observed there was a
more than 90% percentage drop from phase 𝑃𝑆 0 to 𝑃𝑆 3 and beyond for 𝑆𝑀𝑈 when the university
implemented an almost full work-from-home policy (𝑃𝑆 3) followed by the nationwide lockdown
(𝑃𝑆 4). Despite taking the same set of measures, 𝑁𝑈 𝑆 was successful in reducing occupancy to
only 75% at 𝑃𝑆 3, and 98% by the lockdown. For 𝑆𝑀𝑈 , the drop was almost 100% by Phase 4 (𝑃𝑆 4)
as nobody, except for security staff, was allowed onto campus whereas 𝑁𝑈 𝑆 still allowed a few
thousand students to stay in the dorms.

Fig. 6. Space occupancy for one school building for each university, 𝑆𝑀𝑈 (blue) and 𝑁𝑈 𝑆 (orange), plotted
from 𝑃𝑆 0 to 𝑃𝑆 4.

To understand this change of occupancy in more detail, Figure 7 shows the percentage change
in space occupancy for different types of areas – in particular, areas used for recreation (e.g. indoor
gym, outdoor spaces), studying (e.g. library), and dining (e.g. food courts). The values for 𝑆𝑀𝑈 are
shown in the left figure, while the values for 𝑁𝑈 𝑆 are shown in the right figure. The absolute count
for each percentage is listed inside each area (e.g. The absolute count for 𝑆𝑀𝑈 _Food for 𝑆𝑀𝑈 in
𝑃𝑆 4 is 22 people comprising about 40% of the total occupancy).
There were differences in the space utilization between the two campuses. For example, 𝑆𝑀𝑈
closed all recreational facilities in 𝑃𝑆 2 onwards, and this is reflected in the noticeable percentage
drop. The on-campus dining facilities were also mostly closed from 𝑃𝑆 2 onwards.
As 𝑁𝑈 𝑆 has a large number of students staying on campus in dorms (𝑆𝑀𝑈 does not have dorms
on campus), even in 𝑃𝑆 4, the occupancy of recreational spaces was relatively high (and higher

percentage-wise than earlier phases). This result is likely because students staying in dorms did not
want to stay in their rooms all day long and decided to go out to these recreational spaces (which
is technically a violation of the quarantine rules in effect).
Such occurrences raise concerns that these recreational spaces would have larger than optimal
occupancy densities and undesirable mixing students from different dorms that would compromise
measures designed to contain the spread of infection.
4.3

Impact of Various Policies on Mobility

Next, we sought to determine how various social mobility control measures influenced mobility
patterns across both universities. First, looking at 𝑆𝑀𝑈 , Figure 8 charts the average transitions
made on a per-building level over a day in each phase, from one building (called 𝑆𝑀𝑈 _building1),
to five other 𝑆𝑀𝑈 buildings. The transition count indicates the number of times a person moved
from 𝑆𝑀𝑈 _building1 to the indicated building on that day.
The results showed an expected decrease in the overall numbers as each phase was introduced,
beginning with the university’s decision to conduct online learning for its students at phase 𝑃𝑆 1. In
phase 𝑃𝑆 2, 𝑆𝑀𝑈 introduced full A/B schedules where only half the student and staff population

remained the same on the overall despite noticeable reduction in the number of transitions over time.

could physically be on campus at any one time. This step reduced the overall occupancy (as shown
in Figure 6 and decreasing Transition count for 𝑃𝑆 2 in Figure 8).
However, the actual mobility rate has not decreased as, even though the total number of people
on campus had decreased, the number of buildings that each person visited had not. This is
understandable as the work that each person on campus had to do remained the same – requiring
them to visit the same set of buildings they had previously. 𝑆𝑀𝑈 reduced the campus occupancy to
almost 0 in Phases 𝑃𝑆 3 onwards, and this naturally reduced the mobility rate.
We next looked at data from 𝑁𝑈 𝑆 to understand if these changes in mobility patterns were
consistent. Figure 9 shows the absolute number of transitions (numbers within each bar) along with
the percentage of transitions from one 𝑁𝑈 𝑆 academic building to three other academic buildings.
Similar to 𝑆𝑀𝑈 , even though the total occupancy of the campus decreased due to the measures
enacted in 𝑃𝑆 2, the mobility rate (amongst those staff and students still on campus) remained high
until more complete lockdown policies were enacted in 𝑃𝑆 3 onwards.
4.4

On-campus Living

The previous analysis focused mostly on academic buildings. However, 𝑁𝑈 𝑆, unlike 𝑆𝑀𝑈 , has a
significant student population still residing in on-campus dormitories even during the full lockdown
phase 𝑃𝑆 4. We decided to dig deeper and understand the behaviour of these students living in these
𝑁𝑈 𝑆 dorms.
Figure 10 plots the daily activity trend of one dormitory location (called 𝑁𝑈 𝑆_𝐷𝑜𝑟𝑚 ) over
phases 𝑃𝑆 0 and 𝑃𝑆 4. Overall, we observed the same daily occupancy levels (approximately 700) for
this dorm across all phases – indicating that the population of the dorm had not changed between
phases.
However, our analysis of mobility patterns amongst students staying in the dorms revealed some
interesting findings. In particular, we found that even during lockdown periods (𝑃𝑆 4), a significant
number of people were moving actively across campus – which is technically a violation of the
lockdown rules.
Figure 11 presents the mobility analysis of 200 randomly selected individuals staying in 𝑁𝑈 𝑆_𝐷𝑜𝑟𝑚.
We found that their mobility rate increased during 𝑃𝑆 3 and 𝑃𝑆 4 compared to 𝑃𝑆 2. Each occupant was
making at least three transitions on average in phase 𝑃𝑆 2, which doubled to about six transitions in
𝑃𝑆 3 onwards.

Fig. 10. The hourly trend of occupancy for 𝑁𝑈 𝑆_𝐷𝑜𝑟𝑚 plotted before (𝑃𝑆 0) and during full lockdown (𝑃𝑆 4).

While the numbers seem surprisingly high at first glance, we discovered that the increases in
mobility were due to individuals moving between buildings in the same dorm (to visit the dining
and recreational facilities) and visiting bus stops more often (to head to other dining and grocery
areas). These were all shorter length transitions compared to earlier phases – in earlier phases, the
transitions had long durations as the individuals were going to academic buildings for coursework
reasons.

Main Takeaways

From the analysis of 𝑆𝑀𝑈 and 𝑁𝑈 𝑆, the main takeaway we derive is that policies that allow
telecommuting and split-team load balancing are excellent for reducing the people density on
campus. However, the staff and students that do work on campus are more likely to continue
visiting the same set of places they utilized, thus, can lead to serious issues if an outbreak occurs –
as the COVID-19 can be easily spread to all the other people visiting those areas. Thus, to avoid
uncontrolled outbreaks, it may be necessary to limit the mobility of individuals and the only policy
that was successful at this (from the many policies that were tried in Singapore) is a full lockdown
where everyone is given stay-at-home orders.
In addition, the mobility analysis of dorm occupants at 𝑁𝑈 𝑆 suggests that reducing mobility
will require providing everything occupants need at their premises itself. Otherwise, the mobility
rate could go up (even if the actual length of the transitions are shorter in duration) as individuals
travel to other places to procure food and other essential items needed during a lockdown.

MOBILITY AND OCCUPANCY ANALYSIS FOR US UNIVERSITY

Unlike Singapore, the US state our campus (𝑈 𝑀𝐴𝑆𝑆) was located in only had a single response – the
state went from business as usual to a stay-at-home order with shutdowns of many businesses [18]2 .

types over ten days for each of the two phases. The areas picked were “Recreational” (e.g. gym),

Overall, we observed a more than 90% decrease in occupancy between phases 𝑃𝑈 0 (business as

usual) 𝑃𝑈 1 (full stay-at-home orders). In addition, we observed that the quarantine policies had
naturally shifted the occupancy rates with the dormitories becoming the most occupied locations
during 𝑃𝑈 1, and consequently reducing the occupancy of the previously busy library areas.

time (𝑃𝑈 0 the blue line on the right) to the current quarantine phase (𝑃𝑈 1 the red line on the left). At least
50% of the occupants had reduced their transitions from approximately 10 unique locations to 5.

We next investigated if similar changes to the mobility rate had occurred due to the quarantine
policy. Figure 13 plots the CDF of the number of other places visited by the occupants of one
particular 𝑈 𝑀𝐴𝑆𝑆 dorm (called 𝑈 𝑀𝐴𝑆𝑆_𝐷𝑜𝑟𝑚) in each phase. We observed that the number of
visits had reduced with the 50𝑡ℎ percentile reducing by slightly more than half (about ten visits in
𝑃𝑈 0 versus less than five visits in 𝑃𝑈 1) and the 90𝑡ℎ percentile decreasing from about 17 visits to
about nine visits. This reduction in mobility behavior is consistent with [2], which found that the
change in mobility patterns using cell mobile data to reduce by approximately 50% with state-level
policy enforcement.

in 𝑃𝑈 0 were to dining and recreational locations. However, in 𝑃𝑈 1, most of the visits were made to

another on-campus dorm. We believe this was attributed to the students availing themselves of the
dining and recreational facilities as certain previously-popular places on campus had been closed
in 𝑃𝑈 1.

POLICY IMPACT

In this section, we discuss the impact of the policy decisions on disease spreading amongst the
campus community. In particular, we looked at two different modes by which the virus could
spread: 1) spreading amongst the people who are in the same place as where you are located. We
call this vector local spread. 2) spreading amongst people that you meet as you travel to and spend
time at places other than your primary location. We call this vector mobility spread. Controlling
each of these vectors requires different approaches.
Controlling local spread requires reducing the density of people in the same location. On the
other hand, controlling mobility spread requires reducing the amount of movement outside one’s
primary location. Reducing the density of people, in general, can reduce mobility spread as well.
Note: both these approaches can apply in both cases except with different intensities. For example,
limiting the movement one does in one’s primary location can control local spread but this may not
always be practical.
6.1

Controlling Local Spread Across Campus

From the results presented in Sections 4 and 5, we note that quarantine policies were very effective
in removing people from their workplaces. The policies immediately removed one primary source
of local spread (i.e., spreading a virus amongst co-workers).
However, this quarantine policy resulted in higher densities being observed in the student
dormitories, as shown in Figure 12 where the occupancy in dorms increased after the initial
quarantine measures were imposed. This was “solved” by the universities asking students to vacate
the dorms and return home. This reduced the density of the dormitories as shown by our results,
but it moved the problem elsewhere. In particular, we believe that many home residences would
have seen much higher population densities as a result of these quarantine policies as the entire
country (Singapore) and state (in the US) population was asked to stay at home for extended periods
of time. This could make it easier for residents to fall sick if someone in their vicinity had the virus.
Indeed, Singapore experienced this first-hand as the second wave of COVID-19 outbreak in
Singapore occurred in the dormitories used by foreign workers. The population densities at these
dormitories were very high, and the first cases of COVID-19 were reported on April 1st 2020 [29].
This spread grew very fast and resulted in thousands of infections within the dormitories within
just a few weeks [27]. Fortunately, the strict quarantine policies, enacted just a few days (on 7th
April, 2020) after the first dorm infection (on 1st April, 2020) when the authorities realized the
potential for the spread to grow out of control, ensured that the virus was contained within the
dormitories. For example, while the infection rate remains high in the worker dormitories, the
number of cases in the rest of Singapore is almost non-existent – on May 15th, 2020, 791 new
infection cases were discovered in the worker dorms with just one other case discovered across the
rest of Singapore [26]. Thus, while quarantine policies can lead to higher local transmission rates,
the significantly reduced mobility stops the virus from spreading beyond the local area.
6.2

Controlling Mobility Spread

The second mode of virus propagation is where an infected individual travels to another place
and infects someone there. We call this mobility spread. This vector is particularly dangerous as it
can allow the virus to spread to formally safe areas very quickly. Indeed, it was this vector that
, Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: February 2021.

20

Zakaria, et al.

was responsible for spreading COVID-19 throughout the world – carried by infected individuals
travelling between countries.
We see from the results in Section 4 that only a strict quarantine was effective in reducing
mobility patterns. In particular, the split team and other approaches used in phases 𝑃𝑆 1 and 𝑃𝑆 2
did not have a significant impact on the mobility patterns of individuals (defined as the number of
unique places visited by an individual in a day). However, when strict quarantine policies were
enacted, starting in 𝑃𝑆 3 and fully enacted in 𝑃𝑆 4, we note that the amount of individual mobility
has significantly reduced. Also, when people were mobile, they spent significantly lower amounts
of time at each place visited.
This data backs up the policy decisions in both Singapore and the US state to enact a strict
quarantine as the impact on individual mobility is very clear. Such measures, in turn, dramatically
reduce the probability that COVID-19 can spread beyond a local area. However, as stated previously,
reducing mobility comes at the expense of increasing the population density of homes, dormitories,
and other residential areas. Hence, there could be a higher probability of local infections as a result
of a strict quarantine (as demonstrated by the worker dormitories outbreak in Singapore).

PRACTICAL APPLICATION FOR INSTITUTIONAL CROWD CONTROL

Our analysis in this paper can be realized as an analytics tool. We have since developed an opensourced monitoring platform (link is redacted) to monitor safety compliance with public health
guidelines. In what follows, we describe its use and potential benefits.

Fig. 15. A dashboard of an open-source platform developed to assist institutions with monitoring buildings’
safety compliance with public health guidelines.

designed for authorized officials as the primary user. The occupancy dashboard displays occupancy
percentages derived by each AP on each floor per building.
An authorized official can select a building and its respective floor to narrow down monitoring to
a specific zone or a collection of rooms (see Filter 1 and 2 under COVID-19: Building/Floor Selector
pane). As explained in Section 3.3, we used the number of unique MAC addresses seen by our WiFi
network (devices) to calculate occupancy percentages. The visualization is split into ‘device-normal’
and ‘device-target’. ‘device-normal’ denotes the actual occupancy percentage for a dedicated area,
and ‘device-target’ plots the occupancy exceeding a restricted capacity (i.e., to be determined by
safety compliance guidelines). The middle panes display occupancy percentage for each floor per
building, while the bottom panes displays occupancy per AP. The ability to refine our monitoring
results from building to floor to AP helps an authorized official to determine areas corresponding
to the AP that may violate zone restrictions.

COVID-19 response compliance management. As institutions seek to re-open in the coming semesters,
they must fully implement the required COVID-19 protocol and maintain campus operations with
as much safety as possible for staff and students. Recall, our tool plots occupancy density exceeding
a restricted capacity, which ideally must be up-to-date with current safety compliance guidelines.
Once the occupancy threshold is determined, authorized officials can swiftly filter buildings and
floors to single out high foot traffic areas. Figure 16 is a sample dashboard, displaying all relevant
information to the target location (nearby APs define the target location). Occupancy density is
visualized in the form of a heatmap, with red shade indicating occupancy density over the restricted
threshold.
At the present day, our three universities have dedicated efforts to employ the WiFi network
for COVID-19. Figure 17 presents an online dashboard for 𝑁𝑈 𝑆, centering on all its on-campus
dormitories. Having monitoring capabilities on these facilities is especially critical since several
dormitory blocks (D1-D3) were repurposed for quarantine use. As reported in Section 4.4, our
analysis found the daily occupancy level in dormitories to be approximately 700 every day during
the COVID-19 phases. Unexpected occupancy surges in dorms D5 to D10, for example, is when an
on-site inspection by safety personnel is warranted.

Similarly, Figure 18 shows an online dashboard for the 𝑆𝑀𝑈 campus. This visualization is
presented to the room detail, concentrating on specific areas of a floor plan. In this example, we
show Basement 1 (B1) of Building 7. Note we mentioned in Section 3.3 that Building 7 typically
receives high foot traffic as B1 (specifically Area K) is where the main university dining hall is
situated. We would expect close to no movements in the building with Area K closed during the
lockdown period. However, we can determine a nearby area, Area T (at 9:12 AM), to receive high foot
traffic. A fundamental step in preventing COVID-19 is the act of social distancing. Our information
can help institutions make more informed decisions, particularly in operations scheduling, to
deploy social distancing officers to appropriate zones.
Privacy Safeguards. Refer to Figure 16, note that users’ information connected to the AP is available
(bottom left pane); however, these users are anonymized from hashing. We had discussed in Section
2.4 of the privacy safeguards in the event an area is determined to be at high-risk of COVID-19
spread, and digital contract tracing may need to be performed. One viable safeguard is implementing

authorization to export the anonymized user list in a .CSV file. Another possibility is to perform
de-anonymization separately from the platform, nevertheless requiring appropriate permissions.
Overall, we believe passive WiFi-sensing is a promising technique to pursue COVID-19 response
on a larger scale. We are already providing updates at 𝑆𝑀𝑈 to the campus facilities managers and
the deans of students at 𝑁𝑈 𝑆 regarding the occupancy and mobility levels across the buildings and
dorms at each campus.

CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK

In the midst of this pandemic, we can anticipate increasingly vulnerable situations to arise as
individuals congregate in groups. In this paper, we present results from two campuses in Singapore
and one in the North-Eastern portion of the United States of America, demonstrating how WiFi
network information alone could reveal occupancy and mobility spectrum between floors in
buildings and between buildings within the campus, changing with different containment policies.
Indeed, augmenting WiFi data can assist institutions with managing safety compliance as we get
through the crisis. Our open-source COVID-19 monitoring tool is available: [redacted link].
This study is not without limitations. First, the data was only collected from WiFi-enabled
devices that were associated with the campus WiFi networks. This can result in under-counting
if individuals do not enable or carry a WiFi device or are not connected to the campus network.
Second, our data comes from two countries with contrasting COVID-19 policies. While we have
observed similar results, local factors may prevent specific results from applying to other regions. As
COVID-19 continues to spread, our efforts progress towards deeper and broader analyses addressing
these shortfalls.
Data-driven analytics utilizing passive WiFi-sensing is a promising technique, and we have since
developed an open-source monitoring tool at (redacted link) for public use. We hope our efforts
can help institutions monitor and manage safety compliance appropriate to changing COVID-19
guidelines. This step is essential, especially when lockdowns are lifted and classes resume for the
semester.
