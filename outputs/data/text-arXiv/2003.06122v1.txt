Abstract

The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, the etiologic agent responsible for COVID-19 coronavirus
disease, is a global threat. To better understand viral tropism, we assessed the RNA
expression of the coronavirus receptor, ACE2, as well as the viral S protein priming

protease TMPRSS2 thought to govern viral entry in single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNAseq) datasets from healthy individuals generated by the Human Cell Atlas consortium.
We found that ACE2, as well as the protease TMPRSS2, are differentially expressed in
respiratory and gut epithelial cells. In-depth analysis of epithelial cells in the respiratory
tree reveals that nasal epithelial cells, specifically goblet/secretory cells and ciliated cells,
display the highest ACE2 expression of all the epithelial cells analyzed. The skewed
expression of viral receptors/entry-associated proteins towards the upper airway may be
correlated with enhanced transmissivity. Finally, we showed that many of the top genes
associated with ACE2 airway epithelial expression are innate immune-associated,
antiviral genes, highly enriched in the nasal epithelial cells. This association with immune
pathways might have clinical implications for the course of infection and viral pathology,
and highlights the specific significance of nasal epithelia in viral infection. Our findings
underscore the importance of the availability of the Human Cell Atlas as a reference
dataset. In this instance, analysis of the compendium of data points to a particularly
relevant role for nasal goblet and ciliated cells as early viral targets and potential
reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This, in turn, serves as a biological framework for
dissecting viral transmission and developing clinical strategies for prevention and
therapy.

Introduction

In December 2019, a cluster of atypical pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus
was detected in Wuhan, China1. This coronavirus disease, termed COVID-19, was caused
by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; previously termed
2019-nCoV)2. The virus has since spread worldwide, emerging as a serious global health
concern in early 20203,4. Human-to-human transmission of the virus has been reported in
several instances5-7 and is thought to have occurred since mid-December 20198. As of
early March 2020, there were more than 100,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases4.

Patients with suspected COVID-19 have been treated in the Wuhan Jin Yintan Hospital
since Dec 31st, 20199. In a meta-analysis of 50,466 hospitalized patients with COVID-19
from 10 studies, most patients were from China and the average age in the included
studies ranged from 41 to 56 years old10. The prevalence rates of fever, cough, and
muscle soreness or fatigue were 89.1%, 72.2%, and 42.5%. Critical illness requiring
admission to an intensive care unit occurred in 18.1% of patients, and 14.8% developed
acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)10. Acute renal injury and septic shock have
been observed in 4% and 5% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19, respectively1,9.
Chest imaging demonstrated bilateral pneumonia involvement in more than 80% of
cases1,9,11. Ground-glass opacities were the most common radiologic finding on chest
computed tomography (CT)11,12. Abnormalities on CT were also observed preceding
symptom onset in patients exposed to infected individuals, with an incidence of 93%10,11.

Pathological evaluation of a patient who died of severe disease revealed diffuse alveolar
damage consistent with ARDS13. Currently, the estimated mortality rate is 3.4%14. These
clinical data underscore the severity of this infection. The involvement of both lungs in
most of the cases suggests viral dissemination after initial infection.

Viral RNA was detected in the upper airways from symptomatic patients, with higher viral
loads observed in nasal swabs compared to those obtained from the throat15. Similar
viral loads were observed in an asymptomatic patient15, indicating that the nasal
epithelium is an important portal for initial infection, and may serve as a key reservoir for
viral spread across the respiratory mucosa and an important locus mediating viral
transmission. Identification of the cells hosting viral entry and permitting viral replication
as well as those contributing to inflammation and disease pathology is essential to
improve diagnostic and therapeutic interventions.

Cellular entry of coronaviruses depends on the binding of the spike (S) protein to a
specific cellular receptor and subsequent S protein priming by cellular proteases. Similar
to severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV)16,17, the SARSCoV-2 employs angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) as a receptor for cellular entry.
In addition, studies have shown that the serine protease TMPRSS2 can prime S
protein15,18 although other proteases like cathepsin B/L can also be involved18. For SARS,

the binding affinity between the S protein and the ACE2 receptor was found to be a
major determinant of viral replication rates and disease severity19. The SARS-CoV-2 has
been shown to infect and replicate in Vero cells, a Cercopithecus aethiops (old world
monkey) kidney epithelial cell line, and huh7 cells, a human hepatocarcinoma cell line15.
The BHK21 cell line has been shown to facilitate viral entry by the SARS-CoV-2 S protein
only when engineered to express the ACE2 receptor ectopically18. In addition, viral entry
was found to depend on TMPRSS2 activity, although cathepsin B/L activity might
substitute for the loss of TMPRSS218. The in vivo expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 (as
well as other candidate proteases) by cells of the upper and lower airways and alveoli
must be defined.

Previously, gene expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 has been reported to occur largely
in type-2 alveolar (AT-2) epithelial cells15, which are central to SARS-CoV pathogenesis.
A study reported that ACE2 expression is absent from the upper airways20. The rapid
spread of the SARS-CoV-2 suggests efficient human-to-human transmission which
would, in turn, seem to supersede the odds of dependency on alveolar epithelial cells
as the primary point of entry and viral replication8,21,22. Indeed, protein expression, based
on immunohistochemistry, of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 has been reported in both nasal and
bronchial epithelium23. To clarify the expression patterns of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and
analyze the expression of the other potential genes associated with SARS-CoV-2

pathogens at cellular resolution, we interrogated single-cell transcriptome expression
data from published scRNA-seq datasets from healthy donors generated by the Human
Cell Atlas consortium24.

Results
ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are enriched in nasal tissues and enterocytes

We investigated the gene expression of ACE2 in multiple scRNA-seq datasets from
different tissues, including those of the respiratory tree25, ileum26, colon27, liver28,
placenta/decidua29, kidney30, testis31, pancreas32, and prostate gland33. While scRNA-seq
is a comprehensive assay, we note that some studies may still miss specific cell types,
due to either their rarity, challenges associated with their isolation, or analysis
methodology that was used. Thus, while positive (presence) results are highly reliable,
absence should be interpreted with care.

The expression of ACE2, in general, is relatively low in all of the datasets analyzed.
Consistent with independent analyses34, we found that ACE2 is expressed in lung,
airways, ileum, colon, and kidney (Fig. 1a; first column). It is worth noting that TMPRSS2,
the primary protease important for viral entry, is highly expressed with a broader
distribution (Fig. 1a; second column), suggesting that ACE2, rather than TMPRSS2, may
be a limiting factor for viral entry at the initial stage of infection. When taking into account

the expression of both genes, the cells found in mucosal epithelia in the respiratory tree,
ileum, and colon are ACE2+ (Fig. 1a; third column), consistent with viral transmission by
respiratory droplets, and the potential of fecal-oral transmission35. We also assessed
ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression in developmental datasets from fetal liver, fetal thymus,
fetal skin, fetal bone marrow and fetal yolk sac36,37 and found little to no expression of
ACE2 with no co-expression with TMPRSS2 (data not shown) even if single ACE2
expression is noticeable in certain cell types in placenta/decidua (Fig. 1a). While we
cannot rule out the possibility that the virus uses alternative proteases for entry in such
contexts, or that lung fetal tissue expresses the relevant genes, these results are at least
consistent with early reports that fail to detect evidence of intrauterine infection through
vertical transmission in women who develop COVID-19 pneumonia in late pregnancy38.
If future epidemiologic data are consistent with a lack vertical viral transmission, these
findings may form the basis of an explanatory model for the clinical finding. However, if
future evidence for vertical transmission emerges, additional scRNA-seq data can be
collected and further scrutinized for the presence of rare co-expressers or alternative
receptors or proteases.

Nasal goblet and ciliated cells display the highest expression of ACE2 within the larger
population of respiratory epithelial cells

To further characterize specific epithelial cell types expressing ACE2, we evaluated the
expression of ACE2 within lung/airway epithelia from a previous study25. We found that,
despite a low level of expression overall, ACE2 is expressed in multiple epithelial cell
types across the airway, as well as in AT-2 cells in the parenchyma, consistent with
previous studies20,39. Importantly, nasal epithelial cells, including previously described
two clusters of goblet cells and one cluster of ciliated cells, have the highest expression
among all investigated cells in the respiratory tree (Fig. 1b; left panel). We confirmed
enriched ACE2 expression in nasal epithelial cells from a second scRNA-seq study,
which, in addition to nasal brushing samples seen in the earlier dataset, included nasal
biopsies40. The results were consistent: we found the highest expression of ACE2 in nasal
secretory cells (equivalent to the two goblet cell clusters in the previous dataset) and
ciliated cells (Fig. 1b; right panel).

In addition, scRNA-seq data from an in vitro 3D epithelial regeneration system from nasal
epithelial cells41 corroborated the expression of ACE2 in goblet/secretory cells and
ciliated cells in these air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures (Extended Data Fig. 1). Of note,
the differentiating cells in ALI acquire progressively more ACE2 and, unlike their
corresponding progenitors, they have large luminal surfaces in the mature differentiated
epithelium where viral entry is likely to occur (Extended Data Fig. 1). These results also

suggest that such in vitro culture system is biologically relevant to the study of viral
pathogenesis.

We also investigated the expression of known proteases associated with the entry of
SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. TMPRSS2, which was shown to be important for SARSCoV/SARS-CoV-2 viral entry and SARS-CoV transmission,16-18 is expressed in a subset of
ACE2+ cells (Extended Data Fig. 2), suggesting that the virus might use alternative
pathways for entry. In fact, it was previously shown that SARS-CoV-2 could enter
TMPRSS2- cells using cathepsin B/L18. Indeed, we found that they are much more
promiscuously expressed than TMPRSS2, especially cathepsin B, which is expressed in
more than 70%-90% of ACE2+ cells (Extended Data Fig. 2). However, whether cathepsin
B/L can functionally replace TMPRSS2 has not been empirically determined. In the case
of SARS-CoV, TMPRSS2 activity is documented to be important for viral transmission42,43.

Respiratory expression of viral receptor/entry-associated genes and implications for
viral transmissivity

We next asked whether the enriched expression of viral receptors and entry-associated
molecules in the nasal region/upper airway could be relevant to viral transmissivity. Here,
we assessed the expression of viral receptor genes that are used by other coronaviruses
and influenza viruses, including ANPEP (used by HCoV-22944) and DPP4 (used by MERS-

CoV45), as well as the enzymes ST6GAL1 and ST3GAL4 in the lung epithelial cell datasets.
The latter genes are enzymes which are important for the synthesis of viral receptors
used by influenza viruses: α(2,6)-linked sialic acid and α(2,3)-linked sialic acid46. Notably,
the distribution of receptor/receptor-associated enzymes appears to coincide with viral
transmissivity patterns based on a comparison to the basic reproduction number (R0),
which estimates the number of people who can get infected from a single infected
person; and the infection will be able to start spreading in a population when R0 > 1. The
skewed distribution of the receptors/enzymes towards the upper airway is observed in
viruses with relatively higher R0/infectivity, including those of SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2 (R0
~ 1.4-5.08,21,22), influenza (mean R0 ~1.347) and HCoV-229E (unidentified R0; associated
with common cold48). This distribution is in distinct contrast with that of DPP4, the
receptor for MERS-CoV (R0 ~0.3-0.8), a coronavirus with limited human-to-human
transmission49, with the skewed expression towards lower airway/lung parenchyma (Fig.
2a). Therefore, our data highlight the possibility that viral transmissivity is dependent on

receptor accessibility based on spatial distribution along the respiratory tract.

Expression of genes associated with ACE2 expression: innate immunity and
carbohydrate metabolism

To gain more insight into the expression patterns of genes associated with ACE2, we
performed Spearman correlation analysis with Benjamini-Hochberg-adjusted p-values on

genes associated with ACE2 across all cells within the lung epithelial cell dataset25. While
the correlation coefficients are relatively low (< 0.11), likely due to low expression of
ACE2, the expression pattern of the top 50 ACE2-correlated genes (all with adjusted pvalue close to 0; ranked by correlation coefficients) across the respiratory tree is similar
to that of ACE2, with a skewed expression toward upper airway (Fig. 2b). To our surprise,
while some of the genes are associated with carbohydrate metabolism (possibly due to
the role of goblet cells in mucin synthesis), a number of genes associated with immune
functions including innate and antiviral immune functions, are over-represented in the
rank list, including IDO1, IRAK3, NOS2, TNFSF10, OAS1, and MX1 (Fig. 2b and
Supplementary Table 1). These genes have the highest expression in nasal goblet 2 cells

(Fig. 2b), consistent with the phenotype previously described25. Nonetheless, nasal
goblet 1 and nasal ciliated 2 cells also significantly express these genes, but less so
elsewhere (Fig. 2b). Given their environmental exposure and the high expression of
receptor/receptor-associated enzymes (Fig. 2a), it is plausible that the nasal epithelial
cells were conditioned and primed to express these immune-associated genes to
prevent viral susceptibility. This association with innate immune pathways not only
highlights the importance of host-microbe dynamics in nasal epithelia, but it may also
have

implications for

protection/pathology.

Discussion

In this study, we explored multiple scRNA-seq datasets generated within the HCA
consortium, and found that SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor ACE2 is more highly expressed
(and co-expressed with viral entry-associated protease TMPRSS2) in nasal epithelial cells,
specifically goblet and ciliated cells. This finding implicates these cells as loci of original
infection and possible reservoirs for dissemination within a given patient and from person
to person. Importantly, viral infection itself could drastically change the gene expression
landscape in the nose and other tissues later on.

The up-regulation of innate immune genes, in association with ACE2, in highly-exposed
nasal epithelial cells could be the result of their responsiveness to persistent
environmental challenges, including viral infection. It would be of great interest to further
investigate how other genetic, demographic, and environmental factors might affect this
poised state in these cells and whether such state could influence the susceptibility to
infection due to its association with viral receptor expression. Future meta-analysis of
HCA data can help further assess some of these aspects.

All in all, our findings may have significant implications for understanding viral
transmissivity, considering that the primary viral transmission is through respiratory
droplets. Moreover, as SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped virus, its release does not require

cell lysis. Thus, the virus might exploit existing secretory pathways in nasal goblet cells
for low-level, continuous-release at the early stage with no overt pathology. These
discoveries could have clinical implications with respect to targeting nasal epithelial cells,
especially nasal goblet cells, beyond the current usage of face masks, providing a
candidate clinical option for transmission prevention and/or early-stage intervention.

Finally, it is worth highlighting that this is the first collaborative effort by a Human Cell
Atlas Biological Network (the Lung), and illustrates the opportunities from integrative
analyses of Human Cell Atlas data, with future examples of consortium work expected
soon.

Methods

The datasets were retrieved from existing sources based on previously published data
as specifically specified in the reference. We retained the cell clustering when available
or reprocessed using scanpy50 and harmony51, and annotated the clusters with marker
genes and cell type nomenclature based on the respective studies. Illustration of the
results was generated using scanpy50 and Seurat52.

epithelial cells. a, RNA expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor ACE2 (first column), entry-associated
protease TMPRSS2 (second column), and their co-expression (third column) from multiple published
scRNA-seq datasets. Raw expression values were normalized, log transformed and summarized by
published cell clustering where available, or reproduced clustering annotated using marker genes and cell
type nomenclature from the respective studies. The size of the dots indicates the proportion of cells in the
respective cell type having greater-than-zero expression of ACE2 (first column), TMPRSS2 (second column)
or both (third column), while the colour indicates the mean expression of ACE2 (first and third columns) or
TMPRSS2 (second column). b, Schematic illustration depicts the major anatomical regions in the human
respiratory tree demonstrated in this study: nasal, lower airway, and lung parenchyma (left panel).
Expression of ACE2 is from airway epithelial cell datasets: Vieira Braga, Kar et al. 2019 (middle panel) and
Deprez et al. 2019 (right panel). The datasets were retrieved from existing sources, and the cell clustering
and nomenclature were retained based on the respective studies. For gene expression results in the dot
plots: the dot size represents the proportion of cells within the respective cell type expressing the gene
and the dot color represents the average gene expression level within the particular cell type.

Fig. 2| Respiratory expression of viral receptor/entry-associated genes and implications for viral
transmissivity and genes associated with ACE2 expression. a, Expression of ACE2 (an entry receptor
for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2), ANPEP (an entry receptor for HCoV-229E), ST6GAL1/ST3GAL4 (enzymes
important for synthesis of influenza entry receptors), and DPP4 (an entry receptor for MERS-CoV) from the
airway epithelial datasets: Vieira Braga, Kar et al. 2019 (left panel) and Deprez et al. 2019 (right panel). The
basic reproductive number (R0) for respective viruses, if available, are shown. b, Respiratory epithelial
expression of the top 50 genes correlated with ACE2 expression based on Spearman correlation analysis
(with Benjamini-Hochberg-adjusted p-values) on genes associated with ACE2 across all cells within the Vieira
Braga, Kar et al. lung epithelial dataset. The colored gene names represent genes that are immune-associated
(GO:0002376: immune system process or GO:0002526: acute inflammatory response). For gene expression
results in the dot plots: the dot size represents the proportion of cells within the respective cell type expressing
the gene and the color represents the average gene expression level within the particular cell type.
