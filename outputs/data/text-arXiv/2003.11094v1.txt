Abstract
In the wake of the COVID-19 virus outbreak, a brief phenomenological (descriptive, comparative) analysis
of the dynamics of the disease spread among different countries is presented. Results indicate that the
infection spread dynamics is currently the most pronounced in the USA (confirmed cases are currently
doubling every 2.16 days, with a decreasing doubling time tendency), while other countries with the most
confirmed cases show different values, and tendencies. The reported number of deaths is currently
doubled every 2.28 days in Germany, 2.56 days in France, 2.57 days in Switzerland, 2.59 days in France,
and 2.62 days in USA, while only France and USA are currently exhibiting further acceleration (diminishing
doubling time).

Introduction
The COVID-19 virus has been spreading at an alarming rate over the world over the last few months, and
it has been officially declared a pandemic by World Health Organization on March 11, 2020 [1]. Emerging
in China, and initially being mostly contained in that country, as of recently the COVID-19 virus has been
spreading worldwide. This dispersion has invoked stringent protective measures against its spread in most
countries in the world, which have been taking place mainly over the last weeks, ranging from selfisolation [2] to curfews [3].
The current situation is precarious: different countries are implementing different measures to mitigate
the propagation of the virus, but the outcome of the effectiveness of these diverse measures remains to
be seen. With the aim of providing a comparative assessment of the virus spread dynamics in different
countries, in this work the data provided by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and
Engineering [4] is used.
A purely phenomenological approach is adopted, without considering different measures implemented
by individual countries to contain the virus spread. As more data becomes available with the progress of
the pandemic, results stemming from such phenomenological studies should provide a basis for a more
thorough assessment of different countries’ response measures, and their comparative evaluation, in the
direction of establishing the best practice guidelines.

Data and methodological approach
As already mentioned, the data used in this work were provided by the Johns Hopkins University Center
for Systems Science and Engineering [4]. In Fig.1 the number of confirmed cases, number of deaths, and
number of recovered cases, are shown as a function of time between January 22 and March 20, 2020 on
semi-logarithmic scale, for the nine countries with the most confirmed cases. Linear behavior observed in

different segments of these plots corresponds to an exponential growth of the corresponding variable,
which may be formulated as
𝑁(𝑡) = 𝑁0 2𝑡/𝑇𝑑 ,
(1)
where 𝑁0 is the number of cases at the beginning of the observed period, 𝑡 is the time (in days), and 𝑇𝑑 is
the doubling time: the time in which the corresponding variable 𝑁(𝑡) attains double the initial value 𝑁0 .
It can be seen from Fig. 1 that most countries go through a two stage process: after the initial spread, the
number of confirmed cases saturates, and then after a given threshold (typically between 10 and a 100
confirmed cases) it starts to grow in exponential fashion (linear behavior on the plots). Linear tendency in
different time segments is also observed for the other two variables, the number of deaths, and the
number of recovered cases.

Figure 2. Number of confirmed cases (left) and confirmed cases per capita (right) over the last ten days,
for the nine most affected countries.

The absolute number of confirmed cases, and the number of confirmed cases per capita, for the nine most
affected countries, for the last ten days, are shown on Fig. 2. While the ranking of countries by the
absolute number of confirmed cases is seen on the legend of Fig.2, this order is radically changed if one
considers the population of these countries. As seen on the right panel of Fig. 2, the country with the
largest number of confirmed cases per capita is currently Italy, followed by Switzerland, Spain, Germany,
Iran, France, South Korea, USA and China.
Rather than attempt to devise a full-fledged functional model to describe the behavior of the variables in
the phenomenological plots of Fig. 1, one may resort to piecewise exponential modeling: on each day, for
every country, we may look at a window of size 𝑤 (the current day together with 𝑤 − 1 previous days),
and perform least squares regression to obtain the evolution of the doubling time 𝑇𝑑 . The choice of 𝑤
influences the results: small 𝑤 values result in large fluctuations of the doubling time estimate, while large
values yield smoother results, but introduce latency in the estimates. To demonstrate this effect, in Fig. 3
results are shown for doubling time estimates, for number of confirmed cases in Italy, from March 1 to
March 23, for different window sizes 2 ≤ 𝑤 ≤ 10.

Figure 3. Doubling time estimate for Italy, for different choices of window size 𝑤.

It is seen on Fig. 3 that a choice of small 𝑤 values indeed leads to large fluctuations (indeed, for 𝑤 = 2
there is a missing point for March 12, as the number of confirmed cases was 12462 for both March 11
and 12, yielding infinite doubling time). As the doubling time estimates for different countries assume a
rather large range of values, henceforth the choice of 𝑤 = 10 is made, although a lag of nine days is thus
introduced that could obscure abrupt changes

Results and discussion
The confirmed cases doubling time estimates with 𝑤 = 10, for the nine most affected countries is shown
in Fig. 4.

most affected countries, on double logarithmic scale. In the right panel, the same data are zoomed-in to
the scale 1000-40000 confirmed cases on semi-logarithmic scale, to emphasize current tendencies.
From the results displayed in Fig. 4 it follows that Italy and USA have surpassed the growth rate of
(attained lower doubling times than) China, at the similar level of confirmed cases, while all the other
countries still retain higher doubling time levels. Perhaps the most attention should be drawn to the
tendency observed for USA, where the doubling time has yet to assume a systematic upward trend. By
far the best scenario is observed in South Korea, followed by Iran. Although Spain has previously reached
doubling times lower than USA, Germany, France and Switzerland, the recent rapid doubling time increase
indicates that the situation in that country is improving.
As seen on Fig.1, the death rates also follow exponential growth. The results of piecewise exponential
modeling for doubling time dynamics for the nine most affected countries, are shown in Fig. 5.

The death doubling time appears to be worst (lowest) in Spain, followed by Italy, and Iran - all three being
below the death doubling time in China at similar reported levels. Death doubling time in France and USA

has been decreasing over the last days, and at current levels has also shown to be below those reported
in China. Perhaps this doubling time decay shall reach a minimum, and be followed by doubling time
growth, as observed in the curves of Italy and Iran, but this development remains to be seen over the next
days.

Finally, in Fig. 6 the number of confirmed cases on March 22, 2020 is shown on a scatterplot as a function
of latitude. It is seen that the most prevalent cases are found on the north hemisphere, between 20 o and
60o latitude. While one may hope that summer temperatures may alleviate the burden of the virus spread,
some high level occurrences in countries south of the Equator where the summer is currently at its height,
tend to diminish this hope.
Conclusions
The current study aims to provide a contribution to the assessment of the current observational data on
the COVID-19 virus outbreak, from the purely phenomenological point of view. While the current picture
is extremely volatile and may change from day to day, here an attempt is made to contribute to a better
understanding of the tendencies observed in the data compiled daily by the Johns Hopkins University
Center for Systems Science and Engineering [4].
