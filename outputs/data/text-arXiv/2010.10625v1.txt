ABSTRACT
In this paper it is demonstrated that the application of principal components analysis for regional
cluster modelling and analysis is essential in the situations where there is significant
multicollinearity among several parameters, especially when the dimensionality of regional data
is measured in tens.
The proposed principal components model allows for same-quality representation of the clustering
of regions. In fact, the clusters become more distinctive and the apparent outliers become either
more pronounced with the component model clustering or are alleviated with the respective
hierarchical cluster. Thus, a five-component model was obtained and validated upon 85 regions of
Russian Federation and 19 socio-economic parameters. The principal components allowed to
describe approximately 75% of the initial parameters variation and enable further simulations upon
the studied variables.
The cluster analysis upon the principal components modelling enabled better exposure of regional
structure and disparity in economic development in Russian Federation, consisting of four main
clusters: the few-numbered highest development regions, the clusters with mid-to-high and low
economic development, and the ‘poorest’ regions. It is observable that the development in most
regions relies upon resource economy, and the industrial potential as well as inter-regional
infrastructural potential are not realized to their fullest, while only the wealthiest regions show
highly developed economy, while the industry in other regions shows signs of stagnation which is
scaled further due to the conditions entailed by economic sanctions and the recent Covid-19
pandemic. Most Russian regions are in need of additional public support and industrial
development, as their capital assets potential is hampered and, while having sufficient labor
resources, their donorship will increase.

Introduction

The social differentiation and disparity, as well as interregional disparity, is one of the
central problems of the developed modern society. Of the development goals set by the United
Nations Organization that must be achieved until 2030, we should point out the “Reduction of
inequality within and between countries” [1].
It is hardly arguable that socio-economic disparity is one of the sources of instability of the
territorial development of a country, and is one of the struggles to achieve sustainable development
of its economy. The President of Russia, V.V. Putin, has stated in his message to the Federal
Assembly in 2018: “a person, his present and future, is the main meaning and goal of our
development”, which then further resulted in the May Decree to preserve and increase the human

capital. The Decree specifies a goal of reducing the poverty level in the Russian Federation by
half, which, in the opinion of V.V. Putin, could enable a breakthrough in the development of the
country and improve the life quality of its citizens.
It therefore becomes necessary to perform in-depth exploration of regional data to expose
the possible problems in socio-economic development and disparity in regional development, and
to improve the decisions on both local and federal level.
The regional modelling and forecasting is, evidently, one of the primary foci of efficient
modern governing and decision-making for public organizations and the government in overall. It
is essential for the government to provide integral infrastructure and innovative development with
collaborating regions, putting geographic adjacency to good use in economic and financial
development, being able to adequately assess and forecast the economic situation among regions.
Considering the Russian Federation territorial diversity and spatiality, it would be necessary to
apply a whole variety of economic characteristics in a model while attempting to simulate the
regional development as a system, to highlight and play to its strengths and determine the points
of growth.
In author’s opinion, the relevance of dimensionality reduction modelling methods in this
situation becomes most apparent, as a large variety of economic characteristics of regional
development and the number and diversity of Russian regions would produce mixed results in
clustering and cluster modelling methods of analysis. It appears that the principal component
modelling would be a very appropriate method to simulate the economic regional development, as
the principal components would allow to achieve the following theoretical and practical purposes:
- reveal the cluster structure of regions in the dissection of economic development and the
disparity existing among the regions;
- highlight the main factors influencing the interregional variation of sustainable growth
characteristics;
- allow to obtain a model of behavior of the regional characteristics of their socio-economic
development, to forecast their development;
- gain insight into the disparity causes among the regions in terms of sustainable economic
growth and draw the possible suggestions to certain aspects that require tackling.

The initial data were aggregated from official sources by Rosstat, while the missing values
for certain regions replaced by variable mean levels, and the dataset was subsequently normalized
for purposes of principal component modelling by means of the R package.
In its own term, the principal component modelling can be considered in the following
stages.
1) Understanding the structure of the data and the variables;
2) Obtaining the component model and determining its parameters;
3) Evaluating the quality of the model and interpreting it.
The parallel coordinates plot (Fig. 1) and the heatmap (Fig.2) allow to state the following

- the structure of variables has clear clusterization, while the clusters of regions themselves have
somewhat mixed and unclear composition in their correspondence to the variables behavior; thus,
heuristic methods of cluster searching by density would not produce meaningful results;
- there exists strong multicollinearity among arrays of variables;
- a more detailed analysis of variables clustering by applying the complete linkage algorithm
determines and confirms four distinctive groups of parameters (Fig.3).

The subsequent stage would be to perform the principal components modelling. Let us
remind that the essence of the principal components is to reduce the dimensionality of the initial
dataset to a new set of variables, each being a linear function of the initial parameters, with the
following properties, essential to the goal of the present task:
- the principal components are uncorrelated and represent a coordinate system of orthogonal axes;
- the principal components describe the behavior of the initial variables, rather than individual
observations;
- the principal components factor loadings are the correlations with the initial variables which are
considered as the effect of these higher-order factors; thus, principal components are interpreted
upon the factor loadings.

Having performed the principal component analysis, it was necessary to decide upon the
number of principal components to be considered, which has been done upon the scree criterion
(Fig. 4) and the eigenvalues / explained variance percentage (Table 2). For principal components
modelling the general guideline is to select the ones with eigenvalues higher than 1, while at the
same time considering the scree plot inclination. Thus, five principal components were selected,
describing 75,18% of behavior of the initial variables (see Table 2).

In order to validate the principal components model, the comparative hierarchical
clustering procedure has been performed upon the initial dataset and the factor coordinates of
observations (regions) in the obtained principal axes system. The complete linkage algorithm was
applied with normal Euclidean distance as the metric (Fig. 7). It is readily observable that the
cluster structure of the dataset has been preserved in the component modelling with minor
differences, with clusters being somewhat more pronounced and alleviated.
The principal components axes can therefore be possibly interpreted as follows:
f1 – capital investments potential;
f2 – demographic load;
f3 – economic ability of population;
f4 – demographic capacity;
f5 – labor resources and labor reward (negative).

Figure 7: Hierarchical clusterization upon initial variables (a) and principal component scores (b)

The performed cluster analysis enables to identify four clusters among the regions of
Russian Federation. Upon the regional clusterization, the structural and descriptive statistical
analysis has been performed.
The first cluster is composed of the regions of Russia with the worst economic development
and least provided population: The Republic of Dagestan, The Republic of Ingushetia, KabardinoBalkar Republic, Karachay-Cherkess Republic, Chechen Republic, Altai Republic, and Tyva
Republic. For these regions, the average per-capita cash income was 19864,86 rub., which is 42%
below the country average. These regions are also characterized by the astoundingly small Gross
Regional Product per capita and the volume of investments in fixed assets, which are 93,9% and
90,6% below the country average, respectively, and the highest proportions of population with
cash incomes below subsistence level (24,44%). In terms of principal components analysis, these
regions have the lowest capital investments potential (1,47 times below the country average), and
the economic status of the population (1,2 times below the country average), as well as 2,96 and
2,4 times worse demographic situation and production capacity. However, these regions display
certain availability of labor resources and their supplication, but are unable to effectively apply
them, as the unemployment rate in these regions is 3 to 5 times greater than in other clusters (Table
4).

The second cluster is composed of the regions of Russia with the highest economic
development, including the regions of Moscow city, Tyumen region, Khanty-Mansi Autonomous
District, and Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous District. These regions have ample economic potential
by resource extraction (such as gold, coal, oil and gas), while Moscow city is the capital of Russian
Federation. These regions are characterized by the GRP per capita 2.18 times and the investments
in fixed assets 2.21 times greater than the country level; the average cash income per capita among
these regions is 56915.75 rub. which is 64% above the country average and the highest among the
four clusters. These regions also share the highest Gini coefficients in the country, the cluster
average being 41%. The proportion of population below subsistence level in these regions is
relatively small, amounting to 9.12% which is 39% below the country average. These regions are
characterized with the highest production capacity and the highest labor reward (Table 5).

The third cluster is constituted by the regions with high and mid-to-high economic
development, and includes, notably, the Moscow Region, the St.Petersburg city and region, the
Republic of Tatarstan, the Rostov region, the Samara region, the Republic of Sakha and some
other. These regions have the Gini coefficient of 39%, the average cash income per capita being
35974.97 which is approximately at the country average level (4% higher). These regions,
however, share smaller GRP per capita and smaller fixed capital investments (approximately
below 50% of the country average). In terms of principal factors analysis, the economic ability
among these regions is therefore better than average, but lower demographic capacity and labor
rewards (the value of these principal factors is about 3 times lower than the country level).
It is worth noting that the regions in this cluster also share the highest skewness of fixed
capital investments and the average cash income, as most people in these regions are characterized
by below-cluster-average income levels (Table 6)

The fourth cluster includes the regions with mid and low-to-mid economic development,
and includes the regions: Bryansk Region, Vladimir Region, Ivanovo Region, Kostroma Region,
Kursk Region, Oryol Region, Ryazan District, Smolensk Region, Tver Region, Tula Region and
others. The regions in this cluster are characterized by 25% below country average personal cash
income (25915.36 rub.), and 15% population share with cash income below subsistence level
which corresponds to the country average. The GRP per capita in these regions and the volume of

investments in capital assets are 75% and 80% lower than country average, as well as lower
demographic and labor resources capacity principal factors by 3.2 and 3.4 times. Within this
cluster, the population income distribution is similar, as Gini coefficient equals to 36% among
them and is slightly below the country average level (Table 7).

Conclusions

The results of analysis enable to state the following. The Russian Federation regions share
distinctively non-uniform socio-economic development, and while the cluster structure is mixed
due to high variation of the ‘raw’ parameters of territorial economic level, it is exposed better in
performing the principal components analysis while maintaining the same cluster structure. The
wealthiest regions of Russian Federation remain its capital and central ones, as well as the regions
with core resources extraction industries (such as Moscow, St. Petersburg, Yamalo-Nenets,
Tyumen, Chukotka Autonomous Districts). These regions share above-average population income
and high capital investments, labor market competition is high within their territories and these
regions are the general ‘acceptors’ of labor force.
The results of principal component modelling of Russian Federation regions by a set of 19
socio-economic parameters have enabled higher prominence of the cluster structure while
allowing some space for certain variation of regional economic activity parameters. In conclusion,
the proposed principal component model and the PCA procedure in general can be applied as a
routine for cluster modelling of regional development.
Generalizing the results of the principal components modelling, makes it additionally
possible to formulate the following conclusions: the other clusters aside from the afore-mentioned
ones tend to be distinctively different from the highest-performing ones, lacking capital investment
potential, the industrial growth points in them do not appear to have recovered from economic
impacts that started between 2008 and 2015, including the sanctions that followed in 2014 and
2015, and while being competitive in terms of labor resources the economic potential in them
shows signs of stagnation, and we are unlikely to see any economic improvement within them up
until 2022-2025. The Covid-19 pandemic has further impacted the economic disparity existing
within and among the regions of Russian Federation, and this poses further tasks for the
government to alleviate its effects as well.

The income differentiation in the wealthiest regions is also likely to continue increasing;
these regions are accumulating more wealth and the concentration of monetary and financial
assets.
In addition upon the cluster analysis and the principal components analysis results it is
possible to be observed that the Russian regions lack inter-territorial infrastructural integrity, as
the neighbouring regions do not tend to achieve any synergic effect from being co-located and are
diverse in terms of industrial areas.
The cluster analysis and regression modelling are heavily dependent upon exact similarities
and differences by several parameters among the observations, which in certain occurrences may
produce ambiguous or uncertain results when obtaining the regional cluster structure. This
problem is even more evident where there exists the multicollinearity, while the initial parameters
are numerous and their variation is distributed evenly among the studied regions.
