ABSTRACT
The e-commerce delivery demand has grown rapidly in the past two decades and such trend has
accelerated tremendously due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. Given the situation, the need
for predicting e-commerce delivery demand and evaluating relevant logistics solutions is
increasing. However, the existing simulation models for e-commerce delivery demand are still
limited and do not consider the delivery options and their attributes that shoppers face on ecommerce order placements. We propose a novel modeling framework which jointly predicts the
average total value of e-commerce purchase, the purchase amount per transaction, and delivery
option choices. The proposed framework can simulate the changes in e-commerce delivery
demand attributable to the changes in delivery options. We assume the model parameters based on
various sources of relevant information and conduct a demonstrative sensitivity analysis.
Furthermore, we have applied the model to the simulation for the Auto-Innovative Prototype city.
While the calibration of the model using real-world survey data is required, the result of the
analysis highlights the applicability of the proposed framework.

INTRODUCTION
E-commerce deliveries has been growing worldwide for the past two decades. In the United States,
the share of e-commerce sales for the fourth quarter of 2019 was 11.4%, which was only around
4% in 2009 (U.S. Department of Commerce, 2020). Furthermore, the coronavirus pandemic in
2020 triggered a demand jump for e-commerce deliveries (Fortune, 2020). To cater to the demand
increase, a large investment has been made by major e-commerce vendors such as Amazon (The
New York Times, 2020). Along with the demand growth, there have been growing discussions
among transportation researchers and practitioners on the measures to handle the increasing parcel
deliveries to residential locations. Logistics solutions such as last-mile consolidations, collection
points/drop zones, cargo cycles, crowdshipping, drones, and delivery robots have been proposed
and discussed (e.g., Allen et al., 2018). Furthermore, the relationship between delivery service
characteristics and consumers’ purchase decisions has been studied from the e-commerce vendors’
perspective, including services such as free shipping and same-day deliveries (Nguyen et al.,
2019). It should be emphasized that the delivery service options to be offered to e-commerce
consumers (called “delivery options” hereafter) rely on transportation network/systems and the
both are expected to evolve even more rapidly than before, due to the changes in shopper’s
preferences toward e-commerce triggered by the pandemic.
Despite its importance for evaluating the impacts of logistics solutions to e-commerce
delivery demand, there is a lack of a modeling framework that considers the sensitivity of delivery
demand to delivery options, specifically, delivery fee, speed, and time slot, which depends on the
performance of transportation systems. Such a framework should also be capable of measuring the
impacts of vendor’s policies such as free shipping, which is offered typically when the order value
exceeds a pre-defined threshold (e.g. $25). The past studies on e-commerce demand models mainly
focus on the characteristics of individuals and households but not those of delivery options. This
is a critical research gap, as, for example, the delivery fee is known to have significant influence
on e-commerce purchases (Lewis et al, 2006; Lepthien and Clement, 2019). Our aim is to develop
a modeling framework to answer the question: “how will a consumer react to e-commerce vendor’s
policy on delivery service options?”. In this research, we propose a theoretical demand model
framework that predicts e-commerce delivery demand (i.e. frequency, order size, and delivery
option choices) given the household characteristics and the offer of delivery options. The proposed
framework is expected to be used for simulating e-commerce delivery demand to evaluate the
followings from the public policy maker’s perspective:
• Impacts of the increase in the purchase share on online shopping against in-store shopping
• Impacts of new delivery options made available by novel transportation modes
• Impacts of the increase/reduction in delivery costs due to transportation system’s performance
The fragmentation of commodity flows (i.e. the shift from Business-to-Business (B-to-B)
to Business-to-Consumer (B-to-C) flows) is considered to cause more congestion and
environmental impacts (Morganti et al., 2014). Thus, the public sector might consider internalizing
the externalities by using policy tools such as delivery tax and congestion pricing. The householdbased e-commerce demand model is proposed to enhance the urban freight model of an agentbased urban simulation platform named SimMobility (Sakai et al. 2020).
The rest of the paper is organized as follows; a literature review that covers existing ecommerce delivery demand models and the studies on the consumer preferences to delivery
options; a description of the proposed modeling framework for e-commerce demand; assumptions

on the model parameters, which are set preliminarily, and sensitivity analysis; the demonstrative
application of the model to the urban freight simulation as a part of SimMobility; and conclusions.
LITERATURE REVIEW
There are increasingly more studies that estimate e-commerce delivery demand models, while they
are still limited to demand simulation. Here, we focus on the research on demand modeling for
city-wide demand simulations. Some studies estimate the models to shed light on the interactions
between online and in-store shopping (e.g. Shi et al., 2019; Xi et al., 2020; Suel et al., 2018), which
we do not discuss here. A boarder review of online shopping models is available in the literature,
for example, Suel and Polak (2018).
As one of the earliest studies focusing on the freight traffic demand estimation, Wang and
Zhou (2015) develop a binary choice model and a right-censored negative binomial model to
predict delivery frequency, using individual, household, and urban characteristics as independent
variables. Their model was estimated using the U.S. National Household Travel Survey (NHTS)
data. The studies that follow assume the substitutability between shopping trips and deliveries.
Stinson et al. (2019) develop a household-level e-commerce model, which predicts the
participation in e-commerce and the ratio of delivery to on-site shopping. They use household
characteristics and accessibilities as independent variables. Stinson et al. (2020), using the model
in Stinson et al. (2019), estimate parcel delivery truck tours for POLARIS, an agent-based
transportation model (Auld et al., 2016). Jaller and Pahwa (2020) develop a multinomial logit
model that predicts a shopping decision in each day. Alternatives include “no shopping”, “in-store”,
“online” and “both”. The 2016 American Time Use Survey (ATUS) was used for model estimation.
The independent variables include, gender, age, education level, employment status, family
income, mobility-related difficulty, region, the size of the Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA)
and season. Also, Comi and Nuzzolo (2016) propose a probability model considering the four
alternatives for weekly purchases similar to those in Jaller and Pahwa. The existing e-commerce
demand models for freight traffic demand estimations consider primarily consumer’s
characteristics, and the offers on delivery options presented by e-commerce vendors are not taken
into account.
On the other hand, the consumer’s preference for delivery options has been studied mainly
in market research. Among them, those estimating choice models relevant to freight demand
analysis are below. Regarding the delivery option choice, Nguyen et al. (2019) conduct a conjoint
analysis focusing on three product types – a personal care item, a pair of jeans, and a digital camera
- and estimate a discrete choice model considering delivery option attributes including delivery
speed, time slot, day/evening delivery, delivery date and delivery fee. Gawor and Hoberg (2018)
also conduct a choice-based conjoint analysis asking delivery preferences for a digital camera, a
laptop, and a smartphone to online shoppers in the US. Similarly, Autry et al. (2011) conduct an
adaptive choice-based conjoint analysis, using the data from the students in a university market
research class. The attributes such as price, delivery speed, the availabilities of tracking,
guaranteed delivery time, insurance, and shipping company are considered. Wilson-Jeanselme and
Reynolds (2006) estimate a model with the focus on online grocery shopping.
While several delivery option studies consider the effect of delivery fees among others, the
studies on the relationship between the delivery fee and order size are limited. Lewis et al. (2006)
is one of a few exceptions. They develop an ordered logit model for order value at online shopping
considering the variables such as market and household-level variables and the delivery fee. They
use the data from an online retailer specializing in nonperishable grocery and drugstore items.
4

Sakai et al.

Furthermore, Lewis (2006) also develop an OLS regression model to predict an average order size
(i.e. expenditure) using the same data. Lepthien and Clement (2019) develop another OLS
regression model of the order size considering delivery fee. They use data of an online retailer for
streetwear and sportswear with the research interest on return behavior. The studies discussed
above focus on only a single aspect of e-commerce delivery demand independently from the others.
For example, a delivery option selection model does not consider order size decisions. Considering
the fact that “free shipping” service is widely offered at present and that the order size is often
influential to the delivery fee, those two decisions (“delivery option selection” and “order size
selection”) are related to each other in the real world.
PROPOSED MODEL SPECIFICATION
Overview
We propose a model specification which considers the inter-relations among the decisions on (i)
the average total value of e-commerce purchase (“total value”) per week, (ii) the purchase amount
per transaction (“order value”), and (iii) delivery option (“delivery option”). This is a householdbased model and a decision-maker in the model represents her/his household (this “decision maker”
could consist of more than one individual online shopper who belongs to a single household). The
total value divided by order value gives the delivery frequency. We assume it is critical to consider
these three decisions in a joint manner (i.e. a sequential model is not appropriate), because the
relationship between delivery options and order and total values is bi-directional:
•
•

The characteristics of delivery options, especially delivery fee, affects the total value and
order value; and
Delivery options’ characteristics depend typically on order value, due to free shipping
service or other marketing tactics used by e-commerce vendors.

The proposed multi-level model uses a random utility-based estimation framework; the
first level is delivery option, the second level is order value, and the third level is total value. On
the second and third levels, the expected utility from the lower level is considered through logterm measures (Figure 1). It should be noted that the proposed modeling framework does not
directly consider weight (i.e. kg) of each order and the potential generation of multiple package
deliveries for an order. As for the former, the subsequent use of a value-to-size conversion model
is required; as for the latter, the number of packages per order is assumed, while the future
enhancement is necessary, taking into account vendors’ logistics capabilities (e.g. whether vendors
are able to send goods from a single fulfillment center or not).

The model specification of each level is as follows.
Delivery Option
A multinomial logit (MNL) model is used for the delivery option choice. The model considers the
situation that a decision maker is solicited to select one option from multiple delivery options (i.e.
alternatives) which differ in in terms of speed, slot, time, day, and fee, given the order value. The
example of the alternatives is shown in Table 1.

The set of alternatives 𝐷𝑂𝑛|𝑜𝑣 (∋ 𝑑𝑜) is conditional to 𝑜𝑣 (e.g. free shipping for the
standard delivery). Equation (1) is the same with the model specification proposed by Nguyen et
al. (2019) except that delivery fee is considered as a continuous variable, instead of a dummy
variable.
Order Value
A MNL model is used for the order value choice. The set of alternatives includes integer values in
US$, from $10 to $300. The systematic utility of order value (𝑜𝑣) given total value (𝑡𝑣) is:
2

𝑡𝑣
𝑜𝑣
𝑉𝑛,𝑜𝑣|𝑡𝑣 = 𝛽𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑠𝑢𝑚𝑑𝑜 ∙ 𝑜𝑣 ∙ ln ∑𝑑𝑜∈𝐷𝑂𝑛|𝑜𝑣 exp ( 𝑉̃𝑛,𝑑𝑜|𝑜𝑣 ) + 𝛽𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑎𝑙 ∙ ( 𝑡v ) + 𝛽𝑠𝑡𝑜𝑟𝑎𝑔𝑒 ∙ 𝑜𝑣

(2)

The first term captures the effect of the total expected utility from the delivery options
(frequency per week multiplied by the log-sum measure from the delivery option choice). The
second term captures the effect of the interval between orders (i.e. the penalty for long order
intervals); it is assumed that the longer interval is associated with the greater depreciation, the
mismatch between purchased items and the future consumption need, and the inventory cost. The
third term captures the effect of the storage cost, which is linear to the order value.
Total Value
Again, a MNL model is used for the total value choice, considering integer values in US$, from
$1 to $600 per week, as the set of alternatives. The systematic utility of total value (𝑡𝑣) is defined
as follows:
𝑉𝑛,𝑡𝑣 = 𝛽𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑠𝑢𝑚𝑜𝑣 ∙ 𝑙𝑛 ∑𝑜𝑣 exp(𝑉̂𝑛,𝑜𝑣|𝑡𝑣 ) + 𝛽ℎℎ𝑠 (𝛼 ∙ ℎℎ𝑠𝑛 − 𝑡𝑣)2
where:
ℎℎ𝑠𝑛

Number of people in household n.

The first term is the effect of the log-sum measure from the order value choice. The second
term captures the “gap” between the household size; the model parameter 𝛼 indicates the scale of
per-household member e-commerce purchase need.
The modeling framework consisting of the above three levels allows the e-commerce
delivery demand prediction to be sensitive to delivery options’ attributes on multiple dimensions,
i.e. frequency, size, and delivery requirements (e.g. standard or express delivery). Ideally, the
model parameters would be calibrated for the three levels simultaneously; however, there is no
real-world data available for us to estimate model parameters altogether. It must be noted that the
data collection effort is on-going by the authors to collect the online and offline shopping
information jointly with the daily activity records using the enhanced Future Mobility Sensing
(FMS) (Zhao et al., 2015), called FMS E-Commerce.

ASSUMPTIONS ON MODEL PARAMETERS AND SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
In this section, we assume model parameters based on the past studies and/or synthetic data
(instead of using the real-world data for the full model estimation) and use them for the
demonstrative sensitivity analysis. While we attempt to use realistic model parameters, we do not
claim the model parameters and simulation results represent any real-world circumstances. Our
claimed research contribution is conceptual only and this section is to demonstrate the practicality
of the proposed framework. Further calibration is required for using the models for predicting the
real-world e-commerce delivery demand.
Assumptions
Model parameters are set based on information from various sources. The summary of assumed
model parameters is shown in Table 2. The belief explanation of the parameter setting for each
level is as follows:
Delivery Option: The parameters are taken from the estimated model in Nguyen et al.
(2019). They conducted a conjoint analysis to estimate the part-worth utilities for the delivery
option choice. Their analysis used the data from 1012 respondents in the Netherlands, who
expressed delivery option preferences for the purchase of personal care item (representing
Convenience Goods), a pair of jeans (representing Shopping Goods), and a digital camera
(representing Specialty Goods). We use the parameters estimated for personal care item while we
make changes on the delivery fee term. In the original model, the delivery fee is treated as a
categorical variable (i.e. €0, €2.5, €4, €7.5 or €17.5). We replace this with a function that treats the
delivery fee as a continuous variable as shown in Equation (1); the coefficient for the delivery fee
is calibrated to replicate the part-worth utility in the original model and the unit of currency is
converted from € to US$.
Order Value: The available data/models which capture the relationship between the order
value and delivery option characteristics, especially the delivery fee, are limited. We rely on Lewis
et al. (2006) to generate synthetic data for parameter estimation. Lewis et al. (2006) estimated an
ordered logit model to predict order size, using the data from an online retailer specializing in nonperishable grocery and drugstore items. The data collection year and location are not disclosed
but supposedly the data is from the US in 2003 or earlier. We generate the data using their model,
which consider the relationship between delivery fee and order size. To generate the data, we
assume four fee structures for small ($0-$50), medium ($50-$75) and large ($75-) order size (i.e.
$5/$7/$0, $5/$7/$9, $3/$5/$5, and $6/$8/$10). Since the responses by Lewis et al. (2006) model
are categorical ($0-$50, $50-$75, $75-), randomly selected continuous values are assigned instead
of categorical values. To estimate the model parameters for Equation (2), we use the model
parameters of the Delivery Option model shown in Table 2.
Total Value: We use the household survey from 2019 Puget Sound Regional Travel Study
(RSG, 2020). The study collected the data of no. of packages delivered in a day for each household
member for a week. We compute the number of package deliveries for the survey week for each
household and, assuming each delivery order generates three packages on average (this assumption
leads to 0.5 order/week/adult on average; Amazon prime members placed 24 orders per year in
2018 (Statista, 2020a)), generate the order frequency data. Then, we assign order values to each
household using the order value – frequency bivariate distribution from the aforementioned
synthetic data for the Order Value model estimation, compute the total value for each household,
and further adjust these values by multiplying a factor to make an average household-level total

8

Sakai et al.

demand $50 per week (this is set referring to the data of Amazon Prime members; average spend
by an Amazon Prime member (i.e. individual) in the US is $1.4 thousand per year and $27 per
week (Statista, 2020b)).
To estimate the model parameters for the Total Value model (Equation (3)), we use the
parameters of the Delivery Option and Order Value models estimated earlier, as shown in Table 2.
It is also assumed that households face the three delivery options with varying delivery fees by
order size shown in Table 3.

Sensitivity Analysis
Using the assumed model parameters listed in Table 2, we conduct a sensitivity analysis. As
mentioned earlier, this analysis is for the demonstrative purpose only, highlighting the way the
proposed model specification makes the demand characteristics, i.e. e-commerce order size, order
frequency and delivery option choice, sensitive to the delivery options, specifically delivery fees,
offered by e-commerce vendors. We use the household size data generated based on the household
data from 2019 Puget Sound Regional Travel Study (933 households that received packages at
least once during the survey period). It should be noted that the information used is only the
household size (i.e., no. of individuals in each household), which is an independent variable in
Equation 3.
We set four delivery option scenarios as shown in Table 4. In each scenario, the same set
of delivery options is assumed for all households. S1 is the scenario with free shipping service;
when the order size exceeds $25, the delivery fee of DO1 (2-5 days) is zero. S2 is the scenario
without such a free shipping service; a shopper needs to pay delivery fee even if the order size is
greater than $25. S3 and S4 are also the scenarios with and without free shipping service,
respectively. The difference between S1 & S2 and S3 & S4 are the delivery fee for the express
deliveries (i.e. one day and same day deliveries); 30% less express delivery fee is assumed for S3
& S4, compared with S1 & S2.

The simulation result is shown in Figure 2 and 3 and Table 5. Figure 2 shows the
cumulative density distribution of total value per week. The differences between S1 and S3 and
between S2 and S4 are limited, indicating that the effect of the express delivery fee reduction is
limited in the assumed setting. A clearer difference is observed between S1 and S2 (or S3 and S4).
The suspension of free shipping service leads to about 6% reduction in the total value. Figure 5
shows the cumulative density distribution of the order value. The figure highlights a remarkable
difference between the scenarios with free shipping and those without free shipping; delivery
frequency is about 36% less in S2 compared with S1. The model describes shoppers’ preference
to reduce the delivery fee by increasing order size and decreasing order frequency.
Table 5 summarizes the result including the share of deliveries by delivery speed. The
result shows that, when comparing the scenarios with and without free delivery service, the
reduction of 2-5 days delivery is much greater when express delivery fee is cheaper. (The
difference between S3 and S4 is 50.2% while that between S1 and S2 is 42.5%.) While the
plausibility of these simulated sensitivities is still required to be examined, the analysis shows the
modeling framework can describe the intended demand sensitivities.

APPLICATION FOR AUTO-INNOVATIVE CITY
Despite the rapid increase in e-commerce deliveries in the recent years, the significance of B-to-C
e-commerce deliveries to urban traffic, compared against other freight traffic, is not well-known.
One of the reasons for this is that the widely used surveys for classified traffic counts cannot
differentiate goods vehicles for e-commerce deliveries and those for other purposes. As another
demonstrative analysis, we use SimMobility Freight enhanced with the proposed e-commerce
model, which are calibrated based on the available statistics, to obtain the estimation of ecommerce traffic in a metropolitan area. We use the Auto-Innovative prototype city (Boston as an
archetype) for this analysis. The prototype city is a model of a class (or typology) of cities. The
Auto-Innovative Prototype represents a dense auto-dependent North American city with high
transit mode share and population density (Oke et al., 2019; Oke et al., 2020). The synthetic
household and establishment data developed for the Auto-Innovative prototype city are used as
inputs; the establishments also include distribution facilities for e-commerce deliveries.
Simulation Flow
The flow of the e-commerce demand simulation is shown in Figure 4. The households is the main
input for the simulation. The e-commerce adoption rates were set as 0.12, 0.30 and 0.50 for each
of groceries, household goods & medicines, and other packages, considering the information from
various sources (for example, Etumnu and Widmar (2020)). The “adoption” is defined here the
placement of at least one order in a random month. These adoption rates were finalized after the
calibration process described later. The households were randomly selected based on the adoption
rate for each item category and the household-based e-commerce demand model is applied to the
selected households. The e-commerce orders are converted to packages and, for each e-commerce
package, a distribution facility is assigned using a discrete choice model (the model used in
Supplier Selection Module of SimMobility Freight (Sakai et al., 2020)). The output, e-commerce
shipments, was put together with B-to-B shipments, and used as the input for Pre-day Logistics
Planning in SimMobility Freight.
Calibration
The key information on the model calibration for B-to-B shipments, e-commerce shipments, and
the associated vehicle operation planning are as follows:
B-to-B shipments: The initial model parameters were estimated using the data from 2013 Tokyo
Metropolitan Freight Survey, which has large sample size and detailed information of shipments,
including shipper and receiver information. The detailed information of the data and parameters is
available in Sakai et al. (2020). We re-calibrated the model parameters based on the 2012
Commodity Flow Survey – Public Use Microdata (2012 PUM) (U.S. Census Bureau, 2012). The
shipment records with shipper industry type and commodity type information are available from
2012 PUM but the data is mainly for manufacturers and wholesalers; therefore, we used Freight
Analysis Framework (FAF4) data, which provide aggregate OD flow, to complement 2012 PUM.
Models were calibrated so that aggregate freight generation matches the survey data. Furthermore,
shipment size model parameters were calibrated for shipments from manufacturing and wholesale
industries for each commodity type.

E-commerce orders: Initial model parameters are those described in the previous section. We
further adjusted the parameters, mainly those relevant to 𝛼 in Equation (3) (the scales of per-HH
member e-commerce purchase need, 𝛽𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑎𝑙 and 𝛽𝑠𝑡𝑜𝑟𝑎𝑔𝑒 in Equation (2) for each of item
categories. Such adjustment was made so that the number of deliveries and average monthly ecommerce expenditures match the reference values computed based on available statistics
(Holguin-Veras and Wang, 2020; The Atlantic, 2019; U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics; 2019). The
figures used as reference are shown in Table 6.

Vehicle operation planning: Various parameters were set in the vehicle operations planning
module. The two key settings are as follows:
o Dwell time: Average dwell time per parcel was set as 2.3 mins. (Allen et al. (2018) report that
the mean parking time per parcel is 2.3 minutes based on a survey in London.)
o Vehicle capacity: The vehicle volume capacity and the weight-to-volume conversion is set so
that average number of parcel deliveries per tour becomes around 18 for groceries and 44 for
non-grocery items.
Result
Figure 5 shows the number of deliveries per driver-day. As a rough indication, Kuo (2018) reported
that an average FedEx driver can delivery around 75-125 packages per day while the average of
the home delivery industry is 15-35 packages per day (Jaller and Pahwa, 2020). The result is more
or less consistent with this anecdotal evidence.
Figure 6 shows the number of vehicles under operation by time of day. The contribution of ecommerce delivery vehicles is significantly high; about 20-30% of goods vehicles under operation
during the daytime is those for e-commerce deliveries. While the validation using the traffic count
data is required in the future, this result, which is calibrated at the shipment level using the
available data, indicates that e-commerce-driven traffic demand has grown to the level which is
no longer negligible. It must be noted that the household-based e-commerce demand model was
calibrated against the pre-Covid-19 pandemic standard.

CONCLUSIONS
This research proposes an innovative modeling framework for e-commerce delivery demand. The
proposed framework jointly predicts the average total value of e-commerce purchase, the purchase
amount per transaction, and delivery option choices. In the framework, the demand is sensitive to
delivery option attributes, which is of critical importance to evaluate the impacts of novel urban
logistics solutions that affect delivery speeds and costs. Using the assumed model parameters, we
demonstrate how the model performs. In the simulations using the model, the changes in delivery
fee for different delivery speeds affect the three dimensions of e-commerce delivery demand. We
also integrate the model to SimMobility and applied to the traffic analysis for Auto-Innovative
prototype city.
Clearly, this research contributes only to the first step in developing a comprehensive
modeling framework of the e-commerce delivery simulation. The expected next step of the work
presented in this paper includes the full calibration of the model using real-world data. As for the
proposed framework, there is room for incorporating heterogeneity attributable to household
characteristics, commodity types and the different order situations (e.g. a shopper who requires
some specific item immediately vs. a shopper who places recurring orders). Furthermore,
developments on supply-side simulations are required to rigorously evaluate the impacts of supply
improvement. Moreover, the interaction between e-commerce and in-store shopping is, as
identified in other studies (Suel and Polak, 2018), important for comprehensively evaluating the
traffic impacts of the growth in e-commerce.
