Abstract

The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in over 200,000 cases in
India. Thus far, India has implemented lockdown measures to curb disease transmission.
However, commercial sex work in red-light areas (RLAs) has potential to lead to COVID-19
resurgence after lockdown. We developed a model of COVID-19 transmission in RLAs,
evaluating the impact of extended RLA closure compared with RLA reopening on cases,
hospitalizations, and mortality rates within the RLAs of five major Indian cities, within the cities,
and across India. Closure lowered transmission at all scales. More than 90% of cumulative cases
and deaths among RLA residents of Kolkata, Pune, and Nagpur could be averted by the time the
epidemic would peak under a re-opening scenario. Across India, extended closure of RLAs
would benefit the population at large, delaying the peak of COVID-19 cases by 8–23 days, and
avert 32–60.2.% of cumulative cases and 43–67.6% of cumulative deaths at the peak of the
epidemic. Extended closure of RLAs until better prevention and treatment strategies are
developed would benefit public health in India.

Introduction
The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the severe acute
respiratory syndrome–coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus, has resulted in millions of cases,
hundreds of thousands of deaths, and a negative economic impact worldwide. India, a country
with over 1.3 billion people across metropolitan areas and rural villages and an underdeveloped
medical infrastructure​1​, could be particularly hard hit with the unmitigated spread of
COVID-19​2​. To address this challenge, India has implemented widespread lockdown measures,
including social distancing and travel restrictions​3,4​. On March 24, India first announced
nationwide lockdown for three weeks, effectively home quarantining everyone in the country to
curb the pandemic growth. The lockdown in India was subsequently extended three times, first to
May 3, then to May 17, and currently to May 31​5​. Evidence from both India and abroad
demonstrates that social distancing is essential to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and reduce
mortality​1,6–10​, especially until a vaccine is developed. Nevertheless, several countries, including
India, are now cautiously beginning to lift some restrictions in hopes of restarting the economy
and preventing economic distress.
The government of India has categorized districts of India into three zones based on the
COVID-19 risks. The hotspots of transmission, categorized as “red zones,” are identified based
on total active cases, doubling rate of confirmed cases, extent of testing, and district feedback.
Areas with declining or stable numbers of cases are classified as “orange zones” and areas with
no reported cases for a significant number of days are classified as “green zones”​11,12​. While
nationwide lockdown continues until May 31, considerable relaxations for economic and public

3

service activities are now being allowed in lower-risk districts marked as green and orange
zones. During the first phase of reopening of the country—starting June 1—intra-state and
inter-state travel will gradually be allowed without need of prior permission from the
government. Similarly, places of worship, hotels, restaurants, malls and other hospitality services
would resume operation from June 8​13​. As restrictions are eased within specific zones, attention
should be directed to geographic hot spots that may disproportionately exacerbate the spread of
COVID-19​14​.
Red light areas (RLAs), where thousands of sex workers typically live and work​15​, are
one area of concern for rapid transmission of COVID-19. By design, these areas have high
contact rates between sex workers and clients, and sex acts are not amenable to social distancing.
Sex workers are vulnerable to high rates of infectious diseases​16,17​, experiencing particularly high
rates of asymptomatic transmission of infections—a notable component of COVID-19
epidemiology. Moreover, visitors to RLAs include many truck drivers and migrant workers​18​,
who not only live locally but travel long-distances and can potentially spread the virus more
broadly, including to green and orange zones. The combined features of a high volume of
visitors, high contact rates, potential higher infectivity of sex workers, and long-distance travel of
clients across India may make the reopening of RLAs a risk to increasing COVID-19
transmission, health care utilization, and death. Therefore, the impact of COVID-19 within
RLAs, on the cities in which they reside, and on the Indian populace requires critical evaluation.
An analysis in Japan has demonstrated a surge of COVID-19 cases transmitted in RLAs—cases
that have overwhelmed local hospitals​19​. Considering the high risk of COVID-19 transmission,
other countries, such as the Netherlands​20​, Germany​21​, and Australia​22​, have identified brothels as

4

the last enterprises to reopen. In Australia, brothels and strip clubs are the only businesses to be
designated as indefinitely closed.
Prior studies have evaluated the benefits of lockdown in India for slowing COVID-19
transmission​1,23,24​. However, no previous analysis has examined the effect that the reopening of
RLAs would have on the spread of COVID-19 in India, or whether keeping them closed would
lead to a reduction of cases, reduced health care utilization, and improved mortality rates. Such
an analysis would be helpful to the national and local governments to make targeted decisions
about when, where, and how to ease lockdown measures in the best interest of public health, the
health care system, and the economy.
To understand the potential impact of extended closure of RLAs on COVID-19 in India, we
developed a model that quantifies the effects of re-opening RLAs after the end of the lockdown.
We estimated the change in the time to reach peak COVID-19 cases: the change in cases,
hospitalization rates, and mortality rates; and the spread of COVID-19 within RLAs at both the
national level and among some of the largest cities in India that have been designated within the
red zones​11​.
Results
Study population
Data collected on RLAs (​Table 1​) facilitated model parameterization. Closure of RLAs
after lockdown significantly delayed the spread of COVID-19 in all cities and nationally,
including reduced numbers of cases and deaths (​Fig. 2–3​). The magnitude of these effects varied

5

with greater infectiousness (increasing ​R0​​ ; ​Appendix Tables 3–4​) and increased with a greater
resident population of RLAs relative to the general population of the city and with a greater
contact rate between the general population of the city and residents of the RLA (​Fig. 3;
Table 1​).
Delay of the peak of cases
The initial nationwide lockdown is projected to substantially delay the peak of the
epidemic for each city considered and India (​Fig. 2, Appendix Table 3).​ Extended closure of
RLA after the lockdown is lifted can further delay the epidemic peak further by at least 8 days
and up to 23 days with an ​R​0​ of 1.75–2.25 in India (​Appendix Table 3)​. There was variation
between peak delays among cities. The smallest delay in the peak of cases with an extended
closure of the RLA in Mumbai was a 9-day delay using ​R​0 ​= 2.25 (a 114-day delay to a 123-day
delay; ​Appendix Table 3​). The largest delay in the peak of cases with an extended closure of the
RLA in Kolkata was 117 days—close to the delay that was produced by lockdown alone—using
R0​ =
​ 1.75 (a 126-day delay to a 243-day delay; ​Appendix Table 3​).

Reduction in cases and deaths
We found that an extended closure of RLAs after the initial lockdown period would avert
32% to 60.2% of cumulative cases and 43% to 67.6% of cumulative deaths across India when
compared at the date of the peak of epidemic under re-opening of RLAs (​Fig. 3, Appendix
Table 4​). ​Among cities, these reductions of COVID-19 cases and deaths were at least 49.7% and
59.2% respectively for ​R0​​ = 2 (​Fig. 3​). In Kolkata, Pune, and Nagpur, reductions in cumulative

6

cases and deaths at the date of this peak were more than 90% for all ​R​0 considered
(​Appendix
​
Table 4​).

Cases, hospitalization, and mortality within RLAs
Extended closure of RLAs after the initial lockdown reduced cases, hospitalizations, and
mortality within RLAs in accordance with potential ​R0​ values for COVID-19. With re-opening of
the RLAs, 32.5% (207,408) to 44.9% (285,908) of all RLA residents were projected to be
infected by COVID-19 by the peak of the epidemic in India (​Appendix Table 5​). By the same
date under a scenario of extended closure of the RLA, the proportion of RLA residents infected
would be between 12.9% to 30.5%. For ​R​0 = 2, the maximum reduction in cumulative cases at
the peak of epidemic occurs within the RLA of Kolkata (from 8,436 cases to 42 cases; ​Appendix
Table 5​) and the minimum reduction occurs within RLA of Mumbai (from 2195 cases to 1104
cases; ​Appendix Table 5​).
The cumulative number of hospitalizations and deaths in RLAs would be substantially
reduced with extended closure of the RLAs. Across all RLAs in India, at least 39.2% of
cumulative hospitalizations, 39.9% of cumulative ICU admissions, and 42.9% of cumulative
deaths could be averted by the date of the peak of epidemic if the RLAs remain closed
(​Fig. 4A–C, Appendix Table 6–8​). ​By staying closed after lockdown, RLAs located in Kolkata,
Pune and Nagpur could avert all ICU admissions and at least 94.6% of their cumulative
hospitalizations and at least 92.9% of cumulative deaths by the date of the epidemic peak under a
scenario of RLA re-opening (​Fig. 4A–C, Appendix Table 6–8​). Impact of extended closure of

7

the RLA in Mumbai resembled the national trend with a reduction of 55.9% in cumulative
hospitalization, 50% in cumulative ICU admissions, and 58.8% reduction in cumulative deaths
for ​R0​​ = 2 (​Fig. 4A–C)​.
Burden on hospital capacity
India has approximately 1.9 million hospital beds, 95 thousand ICU beds, and 48
thousand ventilators. Most of the beds and ventilators in India are concentrated in seven
states—Uttar Pradesh (14.8%), Karnataka (13.8%), Maharashtra (12.2%), Tamil Nadu (8.1%),
West Bengal (5.9%), Telangana (5.2%), and Kerala (5.2%)​25​. As a result of extended closure of
RLAs after the initial lockdown, current hospital capacity would be reached on October 26 rather
than October 15 2020 ​(Fig. 5)​. Moreover, at the projected November 19 peak of cases, India
would need 10 times more hospital capacity than current capacity, while under extended closure
of RLAs, required hospital capacity would be 5.8 times higher (​Fig. 5)​.
Indian central and state governments are adding additional beds on a daily basis to
ramp-up the healthcare capacity. Under the scenario in which closure of RLAs is not extended,
the high number of imminent cases and consequent demand for hospitalization/ICU admission
and ventilator use rates will likely surpass India’s peak medical resource capacity, especially in
the vulnerable zones—leading to a higher mortality rate ​(Fig. 5).

Discussion
Our study demonstrates a beneficial impact of extended closure of RLAs in India compared
with their re-opening on COVID-19 cases, hospitalization and mortality. Extended closure
would delay the peak number of cases by 8–23 days and result in a 32.0–60.2% reduction in the
cumulative number of COVID-19 cases nationally, when compared at the date of the epidemic
peak under a scenario of re-opening the RLAs. There would also be a 43–67.6% reduction in the
cumulative number of COVID-19-related deaths nationally. These benefits of extended closure
of RLAs, including a delayed peak in cases, a reduced increase in cases, and a reduction in
deaths were demonstrated in Mumbai, New Delhi, Pune, Nagpur, and Kolkata, as well as across
India. Mumbai and Kolkata (at the two extremes of ​R0​ considered) produced the most disparate
results across cities—a difference that can be attributed to the size of the resident populations of
the RLAs relative to the general population of the city and to the contact rates between the
general population of the city and residents of the RLA.
The lockdown, contact tracing, and other post-lockdown government interventions 26,27
​
can
continue to suppress transmission and flatten the curve, but it is unlikely for the pandemic to be
resolved until there is a vaccine for the population​28​. Vaccine development and widespread
distribution throughout India may take at least 18 more months​29​. In the absence of efficacious
treatments or vaccines for COVID-19, there are limited public health interventions that can
substantially reduce COVID-19 cases and deaths when re-opening a country as large and diverse
as India​30,31​. Extended closure of RLAs in India may be one of these interventions—and it is
feasible. Given the disproportionate impact of RLAs on COVID-19 transmission and the
increase of mortality associated with its spread, extension of closure is essential to the protection

9

of sex workers; their clients; the people who interact closely with sex workers and those close to
RLAs, including local businesses, police personnel, NGO workers, and the local community; and
the population of India at large. In addition to the lower immediate cases, hospitalizations, and
deaths, extended closure confers additional time for the nation to plan and execute measures to
protect public health and the economy, and to exchange public health and medical advances with
the rest of the world. Similar to decisions to close cinema halls, gyms, and large public
gatherings, RLAs should be critically evaluated for their ongoing potential to accelerate
COVID-19 transmission and spread.
The outcomes of our model are supported by the experiences of other countries with
COVID-19 and RLAs. In Japan, for example, medical facilities were overwhelmed by a surge of
cases linked to an RLA​19,32,33​. The sharp increase in cases manifested among sex workers and
their clients, and was largely contained within that sector only because of targeted and robust
public health interventions. Japanese medical institutes have placed sex workers in the highest
risk category for contracting the virus—the only profession in that classification not related to
the medical field​34​. In Germany and Australia, brothels remain indefinitely closed, with some
politicians calling for their permanent closure in Germany​35​. Due to concern regarding
COVID-19 transmission, sole-operator sex workers and strip clubs have also been banned in
Australia​21,22​. The diversity of businesses that function to enable commercial sex work or other
activities involving close physical proximity as part of the nature of service share many of the
same risk factors as the sex workers. These other businesses include strip clubs, ladies’ bars,
hotels that also commerce in sexual services, private sex-work establishments, spas, and massage
parlors.

10

There are many social, economic, and health challenges, alongside the spread of
COVID-19, that sex workers and their families will face under extended closure. Residents of
RLAs typically live in confined, communal living spaces. Without sex work, they have very
limited access to food and other vital living supplies. Furthermore, many sex workers lack
government-approved documentation and thus are unable to benefit from the government’s
financial relief packages​36,37​. Toward this end, government action to extend closure of RLAs
should be matched with commensurate programs that 1) extend payments to sex workers as part
of the government’s financial relief scheme for low-income individuals during the COVID-19
crisis, 2) ensure sex workers have access to additional resources via robust financial institutions
that visibly offer better alternatives to high-interest lending schemes that entrap them in debt
bondage, and 3) provide opportunities for sex workers to gain skills that facilitate their
empowerment and adoption of lower-risk occupations. Over the longer term, educational and
reintegration expenditures could be offset by profits generated via the redevelopment of RLAs.
The COVID-19 crisis highlights the oft-neglected plight of sex workers and the global health
burden that the RLAs impose in the context of infectious diseases. These global health burdens
are also associated with extensive socioeconomic tolls. With regard to averting the public health
and socioeconomic burdens, it would be beneficial ​for RLAs to remain closed until COVID-19
prevention and treatment strategies are developed and distributed.
Our findings are directly applicable to the five cities examined and to India as a nation. The
Indian states that have the largest number of sex workers—Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka,
Telangana, West Bengal, Maharashtra, New Delhi, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Uttar
Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Kerala—are also those most affected by the current COVID-19

11

outbreak, which makes these findings especially pertinent to those locations​38​. Although we have
not quantified the effect of extended closure in other localities within India, there is little reason
to believe that RLAs or concentrated sex work will have qualitatively different effects in other
locales. Considering the potential risk of COVID-19 transmission and spread to sex workers,
their clients, and the broader community, policymakers in other countries that have large
numbers of sex workers in RLAs—such as Nepal, Bangladesh, Brazil, the Democratic Republic
of Congo, Cambodia, and Thailand—could also benefit via an extended closure of RLAs to
prevent extensive, distributed transmission of COVID-19 and to preserve public health.

Conclusion
Our study predicts a significant increase in the surge in COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations,
and deaths in India if RLAs are not closed post-lockdown, which could overwhelm the medical
system, economy, and country. Compared with re-opening RLAs, extended closure of RLAs
could reduce COVID-19 cases by 32–60.2% percent in cumulative cases and reduce cumulative
COVID-19 deaths by 44–67.6% at the peak of epidemic. Moreover, extension of closure of
RLAs after lockdown could delay the peak of COVID-19 cases in India by 8–23 days. With
inevitable improvements over time in the implementation of contact tracing and testing—and
eventually, the development of effective treatments and vaccination—this gained time would
save many lives. ​These saved lives are a powerful argument for keeping RLAs closed in India
until better prevention and treatment strategies for COVID-19 are available.

Methods
We developed an age-structured dynamic ordinary differential equation model for
COVID-19 transmission that quantifies the contribution of RLAs towards the COVID-19 burden
in India. Specifically, we assessed the impact of extended closure of RLAs after an initial
country-wide lockdown in five cities of India (Mumbai, Nagpur, Delhi, Kolkata, and Pune) and
nationally. A primary lockdown period lasted 3 weeks from 24 March 2020 to 14 April 2020,
with subsequent continuations to 1 May 2020, 17 May 2020, and then to 31 May 2020​5​. The
population of each location considered was compartmentalized into RLA residents and the
general population. RLA residents included sex workers and non-sex workers including brothel
managers, security, and support staff. Both populations were stratified into four age groups:
0–19 y, 20–49 y, 50–64 y, and ≥65 y. Age-distribution of each location was based on the most
recent census​39​, adjusted to current population estimates for five major cities and the RLAs
within them, as well as the country of India. The general population and RLAs were further
compartmentalized (​Fig. 1; Appendix Table 1​) based on the known natural history of
COVID-19 disease as well as hospitalization and provision of intensive care units (ICUs).
In our model, a susceptible individual ( ) that acquired infection remained in an
incubation period (
become infectious

) for an average of

= 5.2 days (​Appendix Table 2​). Individuals

= 2.3 days prior to symptom onset​40​, moving to a pre-symptomatic

infectious compartment (

) for that duration. Following this incubation period, an infected

individual either remained asymptomatic (

) were either hospitalized (

The spread of infection within each population depended on the prevalence of infection at
the given time, age-specific contact patterns, and the per-contact transmission rate of the virus. In
this model, the force of infection

where

is a matrix representing the probability of infection given contact within the general

population and the RLA as well as the probability of infection given contact between the two
subpopulations. Probability of infection within the RLA or within in the general population,

,

was calibrated to the basic reproduction number (​Appendix Table 2​). The probability of
infection given a contact between a client from the general population and a resident of an RLA
was assumed to be one, if the resident was a sex-worker, and

, if the resident was a non-sex

worker. As non-sex workers account for five times more interactions with clients than
sex-workers, we calculated the probability of infection given a contact between a client from the
general population and any resident of the red-light area as the weighted average of these two
probabilities,

14

Thus,

The interactions between the general population and the RLA occurring via clients were
defined by the connectivity matrix

where

is the contact rate between the two communities. This contact rate was calculated as the

per-capita daily clients from the general population who visit the red-light area.
We used social contact matrices estimated for India overall and within specific locations
such as households​41​ to construct contact patterns between age-groups based on whether
individuals are quarantined in their home or not. The contact patterns between age-groups were
captured by two matrices:

15

when individuals are not isolated / quarantined in their home (

when they are (

,

,

), and

) to match contact patterns at the household level​41​.

Red-light areas in India are densely populated and have a high number of interactions
when they are open. Therefore, for interactions between the general population and red-light area
residents, we scaled up all entries in the contact matrix

by a scaling factor

, calculated as

the ratio of the average number of interactions that a client has per visit to the RLA (​Table 1) to
the average number of interactions in the contact matrix

.

We specified that individuals with asymptomatic and mild infections are only 50%
infectious compared to severe infections (​Appendix Table 2​).
Model fitting
To generate epidemic projections, we first estimated the initial prevalence of COVID-19 at
the beginning of lockdown by calibrating our model to the cumulative number of symptomatic
cases during the week of April 22 to 28, 2020​42,43 and a range of plausible reproduction numbers
for India (​Appendix Table 2) ​using the least-squares method. ​Using our calibrated model, we

16

generated results under scenarios of no initial lockdown, initial lockdown followed by return to
status quo, and initial lockdown followed by extended closure of the RLA.
Implementation of initial lockdown
To implement the 68-day national lockdown in our model, we specified that everyone
remained at home, and their contact patterns were informed by the household matrix
duration of lockdown. Moreover, we set the interaction rate

for the

between the general population

and the RLA at zero during this period.
Post-lockdown
After the initial lockdown period, contact patterns were informed by the overall contact
matrix

, and it was assumed that as a result of improved contact-tracing capacity achieved

during lockdown, 50% of symptomatic cases were isolated after the lockdown period​10​. For the
scenario of extended closure of the RLA after lockdown, we maintained the contact rate

;

with no extended closure, it returned to its original value.
Range of R0​ ​ Values
The basic reproduction number, ​R​0​, is the expected number of cases directly generated by
an infected person in a completely susceptible population early in an epidemic, without public
health intervention. For example, if early in an outbreak, a single individual typically develops
the infection and passes it to 2 people, the ​R​0 is 2. If ​R0​ > 1, there will be an exponential spread
of the infection. If ​R0​ < 1, the rate of infection spread will be lower and eventually stop.

17

Epidemics grow faster with higher ​R0​ .​ In this study, we show a range of results based on ​R​0
values of 1.75 to 2.25 calculated in recent research on the COVID-19 pandemic 10,44,45​
​
.
Data collection
To obtain current estimates of city-level population data, we applied population growth rate
reported by the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs​46 to the population
size estimates for each city from latest census data (2011) 39​
​ . For RLAs, extensive review and
evaluation of research articles (including published reports, books, journals, research papers,
program agendas/assessments/summaries), press releases, and credible media reports​38,47–50 was
conducted for ascertaining accurate estimates for number of sex workers, number of brothels,
and the number of sex workers per brothel.
We acquired primary data to complement estimates from the literature and acquire
information on the number of non-sex workers per brothel, ​number of clients per sex worker per
day, ​number of sex workers crossed on the way to a brothel in the RLA per visit, number of
brothel workers met inside brothels on an average red-light visit by a client per visit, total
interaction with sex workers and staff by a client per visit, and sex-worker interaction with other
sex workers per day. Respondents were identified and selected based on their work experience in
RLAs and continued access/exposure to the primary sampling units that comprised of
active/former sex workers, ​brothel managers, security, support staff and communities inhabiting
in and around RLAs. The work experience/access/exposure to RLAs for the respondents ranged
from a minimum of one year to 15 years. The respondents were identified based on their close
engagement with RLA residents, local police, the city’s municipal corporation, NGOs
specifically working in the particular RLA, NGOs addressing broad issues relating to RLA,

18

counselors, health service providers, worker’s association active in RLA, local business, and
shop owners.
Cumulatively, among all 5 RLAs, 552 individuals were approached: 147 sex workers, 87
brothel managers, 143 clients, 33 social workers/researchers, 103 community members, and 39
local business owners. Among these individuals, 180 completed follow-up in-depth face to face
interviews at 5 RLAs conducted in local languages resulting in a 32.6% overall response rate.
The primary sample units include 48 sex workers, 31 brothel managers, 43 clients, 14 social
workers/researchers, 24 community members, 20 local business owners. Trained field data
collectors conducted confidential in-depth interviews with the sex workers after obtaining
consent to share information. To estimate the population working in RLAs, non-sex-workers in
RLAs were oriented to work as survey enumerators. The survey included demographic details,
indicators of mobility, socio-economic vulnerability, engagement with clients, and routine
activity patterns. The respondents’ identities were kept confidential for safety reasons.
For national-level data, the number of sex workers, brothels, and client visits was
determined from secondary sources​51,52​. Exhaustive face validation with subject experts was
conducted for the dynamic data sets pertaining to the movement of sex / non-sex workers,
clients, and their interaction within the brothels due to the high volatility of movement patterns
of primary respondents at any given time-space in RLAs. Where more general secondary sources
exhibited discrepancies with the specific RLA surveys, the more specific estimates from the five
RLA surveys were used to compose final data at the national level.
