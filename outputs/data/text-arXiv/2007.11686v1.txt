Abstract
This is a report on the PLDI 2020 conference, for which I was general chair, which was held virtually
for the first time as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The report contains: my personal reflections
on the positive and negative aspects of the event; a description of the format of the event and
associated logistical details; and data (with some analysis) on attendees’ views on the conference
format, the extent to which attendees engaged with the conference, attendees’ views on virtual vs.
physical conferences (with a focus on PLDI specifically) and the diversity of conference registrants. I
hope that the report will be a useful resource for organizers of upcoming virtual conferences, and
generally interesting to the Programming Languages community and beyond.

1. Introduction
The 41st ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation (PLDI
2020) was due to be held in London at the Royal Geographical Society during 15-20 June 2020. Due
to the COVID-19 pandemic, a decision was made in March 2020 to cancel the physical event and to
run a virtual conference instead - the first virtual edition of PLDI.
In this report I provide an overview of the format of the virtual PLDI 2020 conference, for which I
was general chair. I also present an analysis of various data sources related to the conference,
including: an extensive post-conference questionnaire; data on demographics gathered at
registration time and via the post-conference questionnaire; and data extracted from YouTube and
Slack (two of the services used to run the conference) that provide quantitative insights into the
extent to which people engaged with the conference. The report also includes logistical details
about how my team and I ran the conference, which may be informative for organisers of future
virtual conferences.
The report is long due to the amount of data that was available for presentation and discussion. I
hope that it will be interesting for members of the community to skim, and for organisers of other
virtual conferences to digest in detail.

1.1. Report structure
I start, in Section 2, by giving my personal reflections about the positive and negative aspects of
virtual PLDI, based both on my own experience of organizing and attending the event, and also on
my interpretation of the data that backs the rest of this report.
In Section 3 I describe the format of the virtual conference, discussing relevant logistical details, and
present survey results on what attendees thought about this format.
Section 4 studies the extent to which conference attendees and external viewers engaged with the
conference. This is based on an analysis of quantitative data taken from the tools that were used to
run the conference (e.g., view time associated with the ACM SIGPLAN YouTube channel during the
conference), and analysis of engagement-related questions from the post-conference survey.
Section 5 is entirely based on post-conference survey data, homing on in questions that compare
virtual PLDI to physical PLDI, and that assess attitudes about virtual vs. physical conferences in
general.
In Section 6 I present data related to diversity and inclusion at PLDI 2020. This is based on
demographic data (a) obtained from YouTube, (b) gathered at registration time and (c) gathered via
the post-conference survey. The section also presents the results of conference surveys related to
time zones, which pose a difficult challenge for virtual conferences.
Finally, in Section 7 I acknowledge the huge amount of support I received from key people when
putting virtual PLDI together, and various sources of advice about virtual conferencing that were
useful.
Appendix A contains free-text answers to various questions from the post-conference survey. I
decided to include all such answers as they contain a lot of ideas that should be useful for other

conference organizers. Each sub-appendix is referenced from an appropriate section of the report,
except for Appendix A.13, which contains answers to a final survey question asking for any additional
feedback.
In addition to this report, I have made available a set of documents related to the logistics of running
the virtual conference, including the instructions that were given to student volunteers, authors and
session chairs.

1.2. Other articles about virtual PLDI
I am aware of (and grateful for) the following write-ups related to PLDI 2020, and have read them in
varying levels of detail:

Lessons learned for virtual conferencing at PLDI 2020: Curated by Benjamin Pierce, this
document summarises discussions on a channel of the PLDI Slack workspace devoted to
collecting attendees’ thoughts about what could be improved in future virtual conferences
based on PLDI 2020 (as well as aspects of PLDI 2020 that should be kept).
A Summary of Discussions on Virtual Conferences: This blog post by William Bowman
summarises a lengthy Twitter conversation on the pros and cons of virtual conferences that
started during PLDI.
PLDI 2020 Conference Report: In this blog post, Neel Krishnaswami reports that “for me, the
online conference experience was a complete waste of time”, and argues that for the
(currently uncertain) period of time where physical conferences cannot take place “it would
be better to simply convert our PL conferences fully into journals, and look for other ways to
make online networking happen”.
What I Learned from My First PLDI Experience: a blog post from Yunjeong Lee about their
PLDI experience.
Day 1 of PLDI2020: a blog post from Jianyi Cheng about the first day of PLDI, mainly delving
into technical details of what was presented (rather than focusing on the specifics of the
conference being virtual).

In this report I have not attempted to analyse the contents of these write-ups, focusing instead
mainly on the post-conference survey results.

2. Personal reflections on virtual PLDI
My view is based on a mixture of things – my experience putting the conference together, my
personal experience of attending the event, the direct feedback I have received from many people,
the results of the post-conference questionnaire, and the numeric data extracted from the various
tools that were used to run the conference.

2.1. Positives
Reach. PLDI 2020 reached a lot of people, many of whom could not have attended under normal
circumstances. A typical PLDI attracts around 450 participants; in contrast more than 2,800 users
joined the PLDI 2020 Slack workspace (see Section 4.1). The conference was live streamed via the
ACM SIGPLAN YouTube channel. YouTube analytics report a total view time for this channel of
16,773 hours during the week of PLDI. In contrast the view time for the channel for the entire year
preceding PLDI was 6,591 hours (see Section 4.2). Demographic information from YouTube and
gathered via the post-conference survey shows that participants came from a wide range of
countries. More than 59% of post-conference survey respondents stated that they would have been

unlikely to have attended the event if it had been held physically under normal (non-COVID-19)
circumstances, and financial cost was flagged up as the main reason for this.
Enjoyment. The drawbacks and challenges of virtual conferences are evident, and you can search
for PLDI on Twitter or look at the survey results discussed later in the document for a clear message
that virtual conferences are not for everyone and that some people would simply rather not attend
them. However, I thoroughly enjoyed both organizing and attending virtual PLDI and I received
numerous personal messages from attendees saying that they had enjoyed the conference. A
number of these people told me they had initially been sceptical about how well a virtual event
would work, but that it had substantially exceeded their expectations. Look at Appendix A.13 for a
lot of evidence of enjoyment. If you are an organiser of an upcoming conference that has been
forced to run virtually due to COVID-19, if you’re feeling daunted by the prospect, and if you are
wondering “Is this actually worth doing?”, I can assure you with confidence that the answer is:
“Yes!”
Engagement. Although a huge number of people had registered for PLDI, I was still concerned that a
very small fraction would actually sign up to the conference’s Slack workspace and get involved in
discussions and Q&A. In this new and un-tested format, I was worried that there would not be
enough questions for authors of papers or for our Ask Me Anything guests to make for a lively event.
A much larger proportion of registered participants engaged in the event than I had expected, and
there was no shortage of questions. In brief (and in full knowledge that statistics like this say
nothing about depth of engagement):
•
•

4,297 people registered for PLDI and 2,851 people joined the Slack workspace
More than 32,000 messages were sent on Slack overall, by 1,083 distinct users

Slack-based Q&A. As described in Section 3.1, Q&A for all conference tracks involved attendees
posting questions on Slack, which were then answered live by authors and presenters. There were a
good number of questions for all PLDI research papers and Ask Me Anything guests, and Q&A at the
co-located events was lively too. I got the impression that many attendees felt more comfortable
submitting questions in text form than they would be standing up in an auditorium and asking a
question at a microphone. The ability of authors to follow up for more in-depth discussion, or to
answer questions that could not be asked live due to lack of time, was great. Some physical
conferences already do offer this option for Q&A, and I think it would be good for more physical
conferences to follow suit. I don’t have any particular preference for Slack – I think any platform
that allows questions to be posted in text form and facilitates following up offline via a discussion
thread would work well.
The Ask Me Anything track. From the feedback I have received, the Ask Me Anything (AMA) track
(see Section 3.4) was one of the things people liked the most about PLDI. I found it really exciting
watching the conversations between guests and hosts, and being able to see, live, the questions that
the audience were queuing up as candidates to be asked next. I think AMAs could become a nice
feature at physical conferences, but in my view they worked particularly well in the virtual
environment of PLDI: to me they felt intimate, because all I could see on my screen was the guest
and host chatting, and at the same time inclusive – the questions coming from a wide range of
attendees, each of whom the host named before asking the question to the guest, led to a “whole
conference” feeling.
The #mentoring channel. A dedicated Slack channel was used for members of the community to
offer their services for mentoring (see Section 3.6). The survey results suggest that at least 100

mentoring sessions took place. I personally provided six individual mentoring sessions, and I found
the process of responding to a Slack message requesting a session, setting up something quickly
using a Clowdr video chat room (also see Section 3.6), and holding the session in peace without
needing to find a physically isolated corner of a conference venue, to be an advantage of the virtual
setting.
Hallway track experiments. As discussed under “negatives” below, the hallway track of PLDI did not
work all that well. However, it did work to a degree, and I personally enjoyed having many
impromptu conversations with old friends and new acquaintances using Gather and Clowdr.

2.2. Negatives
Packed schedule. The combination of the busy PLDI Research Papers track and the Ask Me Anything
track that filled almost all gaps between research paper tracks meant that there was something
technical going on almost all the time. This is in part due to me planning the Ask Me Anything track
after the schedule for the Research Papers track had already been set in stone, and partly due to me
wanting to ensure that the conference was an intense experience with lots of material to consume.
In hindsight it was too packed and did not leave enough time for people to experiment with the
hallway track features that were available. I think that having at least two separate 1-hour gaps per
day (in addition to a series of shorter gaps) would have been better, even if this had required
double-track sessions.
Lack of scheduled social time. As described in Section 3.6, the conferenced use two platforms –
Gather and Clowdr – to facilitate hallway interactions. However, I decided deliberately not to
schedule any specific times where it was recommended to go to Gather to meet other attendees
(e.g. for virtual social events), and I did not propose a plan for Clowdr video chat rooms on particular
topics. This was in part due to the packed nature of the schedule (see above), and in part because I
was worried that there would not be an appetite for organized virtual social events – I thought that
attendees would prefer to have these platforms available to be used in an organic fashion. I was
also worried that the platforms we were using might not scale to the number of people actively
participating in the conference. The post-conference survey results make it clear that many
attendees would have appreciated some planned periods of time where socialising via Gather or
Clowdr was recommended, as well as some more direction in general about how to use these
platforms and the etiquette associated with their use.
Lack of support for newcomers. I was delighted that a very large number of people participated in
PLDI, including many for whom this PLDI was their first. I regret not doing more to actively welcome
these participants and give them opportunities to engage with the PLDI community. Something that
would have been very easy to set up, for example, would have been an #i-am-new channel on which
newcomers to PLDI could have been encouraged to post a “Hello, world!” message, and attendees in
general encouraged to reply to newcomers and set up short Clowdr video chats get to know them.
Another easy thing would have been to set up a number of ~10-person video meetings and have e.g.
8 newcomers and 2 more established members of the PLDI community sign up to join each. These
meetings could have involved a round of brief introductions, after which the established community
members could have given the newcomers advice on the best sessions to attend and the most
relevant PLDI regulars to contact, based on mutual research interests. I encourage organisers of
future conferences to brainstorm lightweight ideas such as these to ensure that their conference is
as welcoming as possible.
Time zones. The 5am-5pm PDT time zone during which the conference ran covered a lot of bases
but was pretty terrible for participants in 1/3 of the world, particularly in East Asia and Oceania. I

don’t have good suggestions for how to solve this. Survey feedback on time zones is the subject of
Section 6.3.
There are some things you just can’t recreate at a virtual conference. An obvious negative that
isn’t surprising or specific to PLDI is that many of the things that are great about physical
conferences – long conversations over dinner, excursions, and other social and networking
opportunities – are almost impossible to recreate in a virtual environment. On the other hand,
those experiences – which I admit to missing just as much as anyone – are only available to among
the most privileged people in the world. If we can learn to do a really good job of facilitating social
interaction at virtual conferences, we may gain exposure to a wider and much more diverse network
of peers.

3. Format and logistics of Virtual PLDI
Sections 3.1-3.6 give an overview of the format of the conference, including relevant logistical
details. Section 3.7 provides details on additional logistical matters. Section 3.8 presents an analysis
of post-conference survey data for questions related to the format of the conference.

3.1. Overarching format
Registration for PLDI was free of charge – the costs of the virtual conference were covered by the
sponsors acknowledged in Section 7. Despite the conference being free, attendees were required to
register in order to gain access to the conference’s Slack workspace. A welcome email provided
instructions on how to join the Slack workspace. All other information on how to access the
conference content was communicated via the #announcements channel in the Slack workspace. 1
Requiring registration and linking access to Slack to a participant’s registration record ensured gave
me confidence that the workspace would not be subject to inappropriate behaviour by anonymous
users.2 Restricting information about how to access conference content to the Slack workspace was
deliberate: I wanted to maximise the amount of Q&A that would take place during the conference,
thus I wanted to incentivise signing up for Slack, which was the tool that we used for Q&A.
The main PLDI conference tracks and every co-located event used the same overarching format:
•
•
•

•
•

•

1

The track/event was run as a Zoom webinar.
The track/event had a dedicated Slack channel on which attendees could post questions to
be answered by presenters.
The track/event organisers, presenting authors, session chairs and student volunteers joined
this webinar as panellists (in the Zoom webinar technical sense of the word). This meant
that they could share their video, audio and screens to the webinar as needed.
The webinar was live streamed to YouTube.
All conference participants were expected to view the content via the YouTube live stream,
unless YouTube was not available in their country of residence; I believe this applied
exclusively to participants in China.
Participants for whom YouTube was not available were invited to join the webinar directly as
attendees, with view-only privileges, giving them a similar experience to that of those
watching via YouTube.

YouTube live stream links were also advertised on Twitter, but not until after live streams had started. Slack
was the place to gain early notice of where to find conference content.
2
That said, there was nothing to stop someone registering for the conference using fake details and using this
as a route to gain access to Slack.

•

Both YouTube comments and in-webinar chat and Q&A were disabled, (a) to encourage the
use of Slack as the single place for questions and discussion, (b) to minimise the difference in
experience between participants viewing the YouTube live stream and participants joining
the webinar directly, and (c) to minimise the number of communication channels that the
organizing team would need to monitor for inappropriate behaviour.

If YouTube were universally available, it would not have been necessary to use Zoom webinars.
Instead, each track/event could have operated via a Zoom meeting, inhabited by key participants
and live streamed to YouTube.

3.2. Absence of keynote speakers
PLDI 2020 did not feature keynote speakers. While Emina Torlak (the Program Chair) and I were
confident that regular conference tracks would work reasonably well virtually, we did not think that
virtual keynotes would have anything like the same feelings of excitement and togetherness
associated with physical keynotes. We gave the speakers who we had already invited when planning
physical PLDI the option to present at virtual PLDI or defer to a future physical version of the
conference and they chose the latter options.
In place of keynotes I put together the Ask Me Anything track, discussed in Section 3.4.

3.3. Research Papers track
Starting at 1:22, the “How Virtual PLDI Will Work” promotional video gives an overview of the
format used for PLDI Research Papers, showing slack-based Q&A in action.
The Research Papers track for the main PLDI 2020 conference ran as a single track, 5am-5pm PDT
during 17, 18 and 19 June 2020. The Research Papers track is usually double tracked at physical PLDI
and compressed into a shorter number of hours per day. Emina Torlak and I opted for a single track
stretched over a longer time period to make at least some live conference material available in more
time zones at a reasonable hour.
The track was divided into sessions of 3-4 papers. Each paper was allocated a 20-minute slot, so that
a session was 1h or 1h20m in duration.
The #pldi-research-papers channel on Slack was used to collect questions about each paper. One
thread per paper was created by the organisers before the conference started.
The authors of PLDI papers prepared pre-recorded videos of their conference presentations in
advance. The videos were required to be between 12 and 17 minutes in length, with 14-15 minutes
recommended. At least one author per paper was required to join the Research Papers webinar as a
panellist in order to answer questions live. A session chair also joined the webinar live for the
duration of each session, to field Slack-posted questions to the authors. Two student volunteers
were responsible broadcasting talk videos and monitoring the #pldi-research-papers channel during
a session.
A session ran as follows (also see Instructions for Authors and Session Chair Duties for more intricate
details):
•
•
•

The session chair introduced the session and the first paper’s video.
A student volunteer broadcast the pre-recorded video for the paper.
Another student volunteer posted a message to the #pldi-research-papers channel with a
link to the current paper’s thread, encouraging participants to post questions to that thread.

•

After the video, the session chair used the 20-|length-of-video| minutes of remaining time
to read questions from the paper’s thread to the available authors for them to answer live.

After the session, the paper authors were free to continue answering questions about their paper
via messages on the paper’s thread.
The motivation for pre-recorded videos of talks being broadcast, as opposed to having authors
present live, was to avoid the conference schedule slipping due to technical difficulties and
bandwidth problems.
See Instructions for Student Volunteers for more details on what the Student Volunteer roles
entailed.

3.4. Ask Me Anything track
Instead of keynote presentations, I put together an “Ask Me Anything” (AMA) program where 15
well-known members of the programming languages community agreed to participate in live
streamed Q&A. This worked as follows (see Notes for Ask Me Anything Guests and Hosts for more
details):
•
•
•
•

Each guest’s AMA session was advertised in advance in the PLDI program
A #pldi-ask-me-anything Slack channel was populated with one thread per guest
Attendees posted questions they would like the guests to answer on the appropriate
threads, either before or during an AMA session.
The guest and a host (also from the programming languages community) joined a Zoom
webinar, during which the host introduced the guest and then read them selected questions
from the associated Slack thread.

As an example, check out this AMA with Işıl Dillig, hosted by Emina Torlak.
The AMAs were scheduled to take place during gaps in the PLDI Research Papers track. Because
most gaps were 20 minutes in length, most AMAs were formally scheduled to be 20 minutes long.
However, they operated via a separate webinar and live stream so that they could overrun if there
were enough questions from the audience (which – for every guest – there were).

3.5. Co-located events
As usual, PLDI featured a number of co-located tutorials and workshops, the ISMM conference. Each
of these events ran using the overall format described at the start of this section, with its own Slack
channel and live-streamed Zoom webinar. I encouraged workshops and tutorials to run live, rather
than to take the PLDI Research Papers route of broadcasting pre-recorded videos, if their schedule
could tolerate some slippage or reorganisation in the event of technical problems, and I believe they
did all take a live approach. ISMM – which, like PLDI, had a busy schedule, took the pre-recorded
approach.
The Student Research Competition featured a poster session in the conference’s Gather space (see
Section 3.6), followed by live presentations during a section of the main conference’s webinar.
A drawback of making registration for PLDI free of charge was that a large number of attendees
expressed a wish to attend all or nearly all of the co-located events. This made it hard to estimate
how many people would actually engage with each event until the conference commenced, and is in
part the reason why every event used the overarching format of a live-streamed webinar described
in Section 3.1 A tighter estimate on numbers would have allowed some of the smaller events to
have operated more intimately as Zoom meetings.

3.6. Hallway track, posters and mentoring
The “Hallway Interaction at PLDI 2020” promotional video showcases the Gather and Clowdr
features that are discussed below.
To facilitate socialising and informal conversations, PLDI 2020 featured:
•

•

Gather, a virtual space where, as a user, you are represented by a 2D avatar that wanders
around a virtual world. When you get close to another user’s avatar you can see and hear
that user via their webcam and microphone. The idea is that this allows drifting in and out
of conversations. Figure 1 shows a screenshot of me and Nadia Polikarpova chatting in
Gather, and is taken from this example video that we shot to promote the hallway track of
the virtual conference.
Clowdr, an environment for virtual conferencing that was in early stages of development
while I was putting PLDI together. Jonathan Bell, one of the main developers of Clowdr,
integrated one of Clowdr’s main features – video chat rooms – into the PLDI Slack
workspace. From anywhere in Slack one could type /video room-name to create a video
chat room with the given name or join an existing chat room with that name. Chat rooms
could be of varying sizes and could be public (visible to anyone who queried the current live
chat rooms) or private (so that the room creator could explicitly invite selected users to
join). A Clowdr video chat room is similar in nature to a meeting in Zoom, Microsoft Teams
or Google Meet. To me, the attractive feature about Clowdr for a virtual conference was the
ability to create a chat room very quickly on demand, without leaving the conference’s Slack
workspace.

Figure 1 A screenshot of the PLDI 2020 Gather space

The conference’s Gather space featured around 50 poster booths, with posters from some PLDI,
ISMM and MAPL authors, and the Student Research Competition posters. In Gather you could walk
up to a poster board and press a key to interact with the poster; this allowed you to zoom in on the
poster content and scroll around the poster. I encouraged poster authors to include their Slack
handles on their posters so that other attendees interested in discussing their poster with them
could direct-message them on Slack to arrange a meeting.
There was a formal Student Research Competition poster session, but there was no formal session
for the rest of the posters.
Via a #mentoring channel in Slack, conference attendees advertised their willingness to provide
mentoring to other attendees, the idea being that someone interested in receiving a mentoring

session could direct-message any of these mentors to arrange a suitable time, with Clowdr being
available as a convenient option for having a video chat. Anyone was free to put themselves
forward as a mentor – I and some members of the PLMW organizing committee posted messages
offering our services as mentors, and then I posted a message to the #announcements asking others
to follow suit. The etiquette was that any attendee should feel free to send a direct message to
anyone who had posted on the #mentoring channel to ask for a session. This scaled well – virtually
no organization was required beyond setting up the channel.

3.7. Additional format and logistical details
3.7.1. Promoting the virtual conference
To make a strong statement that virtual PLDI was really going to take place, and our intent for it to
be a proper conference, John Wickerson (the Publicity Chair) had the idea of making a promotional
music video featuring several members of our conference’s community. We used the resulting song,
“This is Still PLDI” – to the tune of “Always On My Mind” (by Wayne Carson, Johnny Christopher and
Mark James), featuring alternative lyrics by John Wickerson – to promote the conference on social
media and encourage people to register.
I don’t necessarily encourage every conference to make a music video. However, there are many
different levels of intensity with which virtual conferences can be run. If you are aiming for a
relatively intense event – as I was with PLDI – then it could be worth making some kind of publicity
statement to that effect as a means for increasing engagement.
To help conference attendees understand in advance how the format of the conference would work,
I recorded two further promotional videos:
•
•

A video showing how the format of live-streamed talk recordings with Slack-based questions
answered live by authors would work (link to full video, link to short version of video)
A video showcasing the “hallway” features of PLDI 2020 – Gather and Clowdr (link to video)

My hope is that – as with the song – these videos helped to make it clear that PLDI was indeed going
ahead, and that my team and I were doing our best to provide an interactive experience. Other than
YouTube views (around 2K for the short and long version of the “format” video combined, and also
around 2K for the “hallway” video), I don’t have a sense for how useful these videos were to people
in practice.

3.7.2. Collecting videos from authors
PLDI Research Paper authors were asked to submit lightning videos and full talk recording videos in
MP4 format with 16:9 aspect ratio.
A DropBox Professional account was purchased, providing a facility for authors to drop off video
files. The drop-off facility is anonymous (authors receive a link that they can use to drop files but
cannot access files that others have dropped), and versioned (authors can update the file they have
dropped off, and in the receiving folder multiple versions of a file are disambiguated via a time
stamp).
Authors also had to submit a video release form, giving permission for their talk recording video to
be broadcast during the conference, and optionally for their lightning/talk recording videos to be
hosted on YouTube and ultimately in the ACM Digital Library.
We set two deadlines: an early deadline for receiving the lightning video and a single release form
covering both lightning and talk recording videos, and a later deadline for receiving the talk

recording videos. We still set the latter deadline to be two weeks before the start of the conference,
to allow plenty of time for videos to be checked in case of technical problems. Requesting release
forms at the earlier deadline worked well as it allowed plenty of time for late form submissions to be
chased.
Our team of Student Volunteers took care of checking lightning and talk recording videos for quality,
checking that release forms had been appropriately completed, and editing lighting videos together
into lighting session videos that were used to promote each session. Here are the instructions with
which the Student Volunteers were provided in relation to checking and editing lighting videos.

3.7.3. Accounting for aspect ratio when broadcasting videos
During the PLDI Research Papers rehearsal (see Section 3.7.4) we found that a 16:9 video does not
look right if broadcast from a machine with a display that uses a different aspect ratio. The Student
Volunteer Responsibilities document has guidelines on how to work around this, including using the
IINA media player on MacOS.
As a side note, we also found that not all author-submitted videos worked with all media players –
e.g. there were problems with the Windows default player. VLC proved to be a very reliable option.

3.7.4. PLDI Research Papers rehearsal
We gave authors and session chairs the opportunity to take part in a PLDI Research Papers rehearsal
one week before the conference. The main points of doing this were (a) to give our Student
Volunteers a chance to practice their duties – in particular to practice the various Zoom controls they
needed to use; (b) to eliminate any technical problems that authors and session chairs would face
when trying Zoom and Slack for the first time, for example: not being familiar enough with Slack to
identify the Slack thread for a paper; not being able to sign in to Zoom; finding that audio / video
didn’t work with Zoom; finding that one’s Zoom client was too old; and (c) to ensure that all
participants were comfortable with the conference format.
We set aside three 2-hour blocks of time on the day of the rehearsal: a Europe-friendly block, a USAfriendly block, and another block that was relatively friendly to East Asia and Australasia.
We used a Google form to ask authors and session chairs whether they wanted to take part in the
rehearsal and to specify which 2-hour block they would prefer, making it clear that they would not
be required to participate for the entire block.
We then put together a dummy schedule based on author and session chair availability – each
session chair was assigned to a fake session consisting of three random papers; the only tie between
the session chair and papers was that they had all specified a mutually convenient time block. We
gave each paper around 6 minutes of time during the rehearsal, allowing the session chair to
practice making an introduction to a presentation, the Student Volunteers a chance to try
broadcasting a few minutes of a talk recording video, the session chair a chance to try reading out
some questions from Slack (dummy questions posted by myself or the Student Volunteers), and the
authors a chance to check that their audio and video was working when answering these questions.
The rehearsal was very chaotic: it successfully identified many technical problems on the parts of
authors, session chairs and Student Volunteers that they could address in time for the real
conference. It made it clear that not all authors and session chairs had yet understood the intended
format of the conference. It also informed me that many authors had not received Zoom webinar
invitations, I think due to institutional spam filtering.

The real conference ran smoothly, and I think that this was in part due to the problems solved via
the rehearsal and the double-checking I put in place (see Section 3.7.5).

3.7.5. Sheets for author and session chair sign-off
During the rehearsal it became clear that multiple authors had not received the Zoom webinar
invitations that had been sent for the rehearsal sessions, and that several authors and session chairs
were not that familiar with the planned format for how the conference would work. For the
duration of the rehearsals myself and Dan Iorga (Student Volunteer Captaion) were bombarded with
emails and Slack messages related to problems faced by authors and session chairs, and I was
concerned that the real conference would also be dominated by this.
To guard against these problems I put in place a session chair confirmation sheet (real session chair
names removed in this example) and an author confirmation sheet. I was then able to chase up
those session chairs and authors who did not check off their paper / session, and help them resolve
any questions or technical problems – e.g. in some cases it was necessary to send Zoom webinar
invitations manually to authors due to institutional spam-filtering of emails sent directly by Zoom.

3.7.6. Onboarding registered users to Slack and authenticating users to Gather
Slack (or at least, not the free Slack plan), does not provide an “import from CSV” option to massregister users. To work around this, Dan Iorga (Student Volunteer Captain), the Elmer van Chastelet
and Danny Groenewegen from researchr and Mike Moshell from Registration Systems Lab worked
together to put in place a system whereby anyone could request an invitation to the PLDI Slack
workspace via the PLDI website, but such that an invitation would only be sent if the requester’s
email address was known to the PLDI registration database.
Similarly, anyone could attempt to create an account with Gather to access the PLDI Gather space,
but this would only succeed if the email address used for the account was known to the PLDI
registration database, and an email confirmation was required for account creation to succeed.

3.7.7. Business meeting and awards
We held the PLDI Business Meeting as a live-streamed Zoom webinar – temporarily hijacking the Ask
Me Anything track’s webinar. A number of awards are traditionally presented over lunch at PLDI,
and we decided to have these awards presented during the Business Meeting. This worked
reasonably well but was a little underwhelming as I believe many attendees did not realise that the
Business Meeting would feature awards. For future conferences I recommend thinking creatively
about award sessions – e.g. having award winners take part in short interviews on the topic related
to the achievement being recognised by the award, perhaps with Q&A from the audience.

3.8. Survey feedback related to the format of virtu0al PLDI
I now present results from questions in the post-conference survey that relate to the format of the
event.
Question: Which meeting mode do you think would have been best for the PLDI Research Papers
track?
The options were:
•
•

[The PLDI 2020 approach] Broadcast mode: Attendees watch via a broadcast (e.g. YouTube
live stream or webinar) and do not have video or audio, but can type questions for Q&A
Meeting mode: Attendees join a large meeting and have video and audio for Q&A. The
meeting size is capped at 300 concurrent participants, admitted in a first-come-first-served

•
•

manner. A broadcast is available to attendees for whom there is no space in the meeting,
and those attendees can type questions for Q&A.
Asynchronous mode: pre-recorded videos are available, and a text-based platform is
available for Q&A. There are no live sessions.

The overwhelming feedback is that attendees favoured the format used by PLDI compared with the
asynchronous format that some recent conferences have used, or idea of using a large interactive
meeting.
Several respondents provided alternative suggestions, which are presented in Appendix A.1.
Multiple respondents make the point that providing pre-recorded videos ahead of time could
alleviate the problem of time zones to some degree – members in incompatible time zones could
watch a presentation in advance and post questions via Slack for the authors to answer during the
live session.

Again, the overwhelming response is that the PLDI format was appropriate for AMA sessions. The
asynchronous option received even less support than in the above question about the Research
Papers track, while the “large meeting” mode received more support.
Free text responses providing alternative options are presented in Appendix A.2.

Paper presentations at PLDI were between 12 and 17 minutes in length. The results suggest that this
is acceptable, but that slightly longer presentations would also be welcome.

present the paper live, or to submit a pre-recorded talk?

The above results are across all conference attendees. I thought it would be interesting to see the
results restricted to respondents who answered “Yes” to the question “Are you an author of any
material that was presented at PLDI or one of the co-located meetings?”. The responses have a
similar shape.

Question: Please share your thoughts on how well the Q&A process of Slack-based questions
answered live by authors / guests worked.
This open question received a large number of responses which are given in Appendix A.3. The
consensus appears to be that this approach worked well. There are some remarks that the Slack
specifically has shortcomings that alternatives may have, and some objection to Slack being non-free
software. Here are a few responses that I found insightful:
•

•

•

•

•

“It was pretty good. I find the fact that co-authors can answer live on Slack a benefit, which
I've seen work in other, physical, conferences too. I also like having questions moderated and
relayed by session chairs. I think that really helps avoid grandstanding by big names.”
[This respondent is saying that they preferred the Slido-based Q&A process used by PLMW
to the Slack-based process of PLDI.] “I liked the Q&A process of PLMW, where questions
could be upvoted. In this way, the questions got answered that most people were interested
in, and not the questions that came in first.”
“I liked it better than live conferences. Far more effective medium for asking questions (no
waiting in line, no worrying about how loud to speak, confusion over accents, etc.) And, easy
to spawn followup discussion.”
“I liked the Q&A process a lot. I didn't ask questions, but I found the interaction mode, where
moderators fielded the questions, simple and efficient. The one issue I saw was that some
moderators are better than others at this process. Some just went from the top to the
bottom, which is not great because it advantages people who ask questions many hours
before the talk even happens and takes neither continuity nor general interest in a question
into account. Others tried to ask the most popular questions and perhaps group those with a
similar theme, both of which are nice approaches.”
“It worked really, really well. In some cases, for example, clarifying questions or statements
were provided in Slack, based on answers, and were picked up by the moderator. It yielded a
really effective back & forth. In some cases, moderators simply read questions from the top,
which was a little less interesting. Effective moderators grouped questions together to forms
themes that directed the arc of the Q&A or AMA. Some clarity around voting for questions
may have helped weaker moderators pick more interesting questions.”

Question: Please indicate how strongly you agree or disagree with the following statement: “I
recommend that future virtual conferences make Gather available for social interaction”

Results (494 responses):

Overall, respondents seem ambivalent about Gather, leaning towards being positive about it. As
discussed in Section 4.4, a lot of survey respondents did not actually try Gather.
Question: Please indicate how strongly you agree or disagree with the following statement: “I
recommend that future virtual conferences make Clowdr video chat rooms available for social

Ambivalence towards Clowdr is higher than for Gather, but there is still a positive lean overall. As
discussed in Section 4.4, relatively few survey respondents tried Clowdr.
Question: Do you have suggestions for ways to provide more social interactions, networking or
mentoring opportunities at a virtual conference?
There were a very large number of insightful responses to this free-text question. They are
presented in Appendix A.4 and I strongly encourage organizers of future virtual conferences to read
them. Here is a selection of responses that I found noteworthy and that are illustrative of the
variety of responses to this question:
•
•

•

“Offer routine group video meetings for the audience following a session, as an automatic
follow-on from the presentation platform.”
[This respondent is referring to a series of “coffee hour” Zoom meetings that conference
participants set up.] “More meetings of the Zoom coffee hour style, where conversations are
small (roughly 5 people), time-limited, and randomized. In my experience, these events were
orders of magnitude better at encouraging participation and interaction than any of the
other platforms”
“I think PLDI did tremendously well with trying to establish social interactions. However, I
think if you are not already in the "in-group" (I'm more in the SE community,
ICSE/FSE/OOPSLA), it's very hard to initiate the same levels of interaction.”

•

“The mentoring channel was fantastic and I think that worked probably even better than it
would have in person (I had 5 mentoring conversations that I think would not have
happened in London).”
“During IEEE S&P there was a slack bot called Donuts that was starting a private chat with a
random member of the audience twice a day. This helped (and strongly invited) to connect
with people as there was no need for initiating the chat (as was necessary with gather)”
“Arrange for small groups of people to meet on Gather. At POPL 2020, there were mentoring
breakfasts with about 5-6 people per table. Similar events can be held over Gather, we just
need some rules on how to make them work.”
“Accessibility is important. Not having meals together was a major bummer. That is usually
when I meet most people at conferences. I think some kind of shared online activity that is
not a meal would help with that, like an online game.”
“One idea I had was to have some sort of [speed-networking] online for new
students/researchers. I found it a little intimidating to use the software for social interaction
given that I am a young researcher who does not know many people. It would be nice for
social interactions to be quickly formed in this way (preferably near the beginning of the
conference)”

The post-conference survey also featured open questions on suggestions for specifically improving
Gather and Clowdr which I have passed on to the developers of those platforms.

4. Engagement with the virtual conference
Several sources of data on engagement were available. I discuss the number of registrants for the
conference and for Slack (Section 4.1), statistics provided by YouTube (Section 4.2), statistics on
usage provided by Slack (Section 4.3), and results from questions in the post-conference survey
related to engagement (Section 4.4).

4.1. Registrations, Slack sign-ups and active Slack users
Table 1 summarises the number of people who registered for PLDI, the number of Slack workspace
users and the number of those users who posted at least one message.
Table 1 Engagement with PLDI measured by number of registrations, Slack sign-ups, and active Slack users

Total Slack users

1,083

Of the 4,297 people who registered for PLDI, 2,685 joined the PLDI Slack workspace using the same
email address used for registration. A further 166 users were added manually to the workspace
using an email address that did not match any registered participant. This was done in order to add
our student volunteers (who needed access to the workspace before it had been opened to
registered participants), representatives from our Gold and Platinum sponsors, and various authors
who had forgotten to register in advance.
The number of registrants for a typical edition of physical PLDI is around 450 – substantially lower
than the number of PLDI 2020 participants who engaged with the conference by posting at least one
Slack message. Thus, if measured by number of active Slack users, engagement with PLDI was higher
than usual. But, of course, sending even a moderate number of Slack messages does not imply that

a participant engaged with PLDI in a deep manner. Furthermore, many participants may have
engaged deeply with the PLDI content despite sending no messages: we have no way of knowing
how many of the remaining Slack users participated as silent observers of the conference live
streams and Slack activity vs.; likewise, we cannot know how many of the registrants who did not
join the Slack workspace lost interest in attending, vs. found out that the conference was being live
streamed and decided to watch the conference content via that route without feeling the need to
interact via Slack.3

4.2. YouTube statistics
The live streams for PLDI and co-located events were made available via the ACM SIGPLAN YouTube
channel. Table 2 presents overall analytics for the channel for the year immediately preceding the
conference, the week immediately preceding the conference, the week of the conference, and the
week after the conference.

I find the figures for watch time particularly striking: the watch time for the SIGPLAN YouTube
channel during the week of PLDI was more than 16K hours, which is more than 2.5 times the watch
time for the preceding year. The number of unique viewers during PLDI – more than 20K – shows
that the virtual conference material reached a very large audience, but that on average an individual
viewer watched conference material for less than 1 hour in total during the event. This supports the
hypothesis that the virtual conference reached a wide audience, but that engagement was not as
deep as with a physical event.
The average view time during PLDI of 16:30 minutes is also much higher than the view times
associated with the year and week preceding the conference, and a lot higher than the view time for
the week following.
Table 3 shows the watch time during the week of PLDI associated with live stream videos for the
Research Papers and Ask Me Anything tracks of PLDI, for the Programming Languages Mentoring
Workshop (PLMW) – the co-located event with the highest watch time – and for other co-located
events. The “Total” column shows that the watch time associated with PLDI-related live streams
accounts for nearly all of the watch time for the SIGPLAN YouTube channel for the week of PLDI.

Two registered participants did get in touch to tell me that they specifically would not join Slack, in one case
because they do not like Slack, and in the other case because they are not willing to use software that is not
free and open-source.

4.3. Slack activity
Reports from Slack downloaded at the end of the conference state that 32,618 messages were
posted in total (this includes some messages posted in the run-up to the conference, including
during a rehearsal with authors).
Table 4 shows details of activity on the conference’s public Slack channels, showing the number of
messages posted in total, the number of members subscribed to each channel, and the number of
those members who posted messages. The sum total of these message is much less than the total
number of messages posted during the conference – i.e., the vast majority of messages exchanged
were private.

Figure 2 illustrates the distribution of active Slack users according to the number of messages they
posted. Inactive users – who posted zero messages – are not included. To make the figure readable,
data for myself and the Student Volunteer Captain (Dan Iorga) are also excluded, as we each posted
in excess of 1000 messages. The figure shows that most active participants posted a small number
of messages, with a long tail of more active participants.

The results for this and the previous question appear to support the hypothesis that while the virtual
conference reached a very large audience, engagement with conference material on a per-attendee
basis was lower than it would be at a physical conference.

These results match the trend shown in Figure 2 – just as that figure showed that most active Slack
users posted a small number of messages with a small number being significantly more active, we
see that most users who participated in Q&A asked a small number of questions, with some users
being much more active in Q&A.

Question: If you answered “Yes”, how many mentoring sessions did you provide?
Results (31 responses), presented as raw numbers rather than percentages to facilitate estimating a
lower bound on sessions delivered by mentors, and filtered to only include responses where the
respondent had answered “Yes” to the previous question (a lot of respondents selected “No” to the
previous question and opted to answer this question with “None” rather than leaving it unanswered):

Counting each “2-5” entry as 3.5 and each “>5” entry as 6, 109 seems like a reasonable estimate for
a lower bound on the number of mentoring sessions that these respondents provided.

Question: If you answered “Yes”, how many mentoring sessions did you receive?
Results (45 responses), presented as raw numbers rather than percentages to facilitate estimating a

Again, counting each “2-5” entry as 3.5 and each “>5” entry as 6, 116 seems like a reasonable
estimate for a lower bound on the number of mentoring sessions that these respondents received.
There appears to be little overlap between mentors and mentees. Three respondents report having
offered their services as a mentor and also approached other attendees about receiving mentorship;
in all cases the respondents reported taking part in mentoring sessions both as mentor and mentee.

The majority of respondents did not try Gather at all. This tallies with the somewhat ambivalent
response to whether future conferences should use Gather (see Section 3.7), and I think reinforces a
negative about PLDI: that not enough time was specifically earmarked for social interaction using
this platform (see “Negatives about virtual PLDI” in Section 2).
Question: How many hours total did you spend in Clowdr video chat rooms (accessed via the /video
command from Slack)?

Only 26% of respondents tried Clowdr, tallying with the ambivalent response to whether future
conferences should use Clowdr (see Section 3.7). Again, this reinforces the fact that attendees were
not sufficiently incentivised to use this feature; I believe a carefully crafted and well-advertised
series of chat rooms would have been useful here.
Question: How did you use Clowdr video chat rooms? (Respondents were invited to select multiple
options if applicable.)
Results (137 responses) – absolute counts are shown, not percentages, since respondents could
select multiple options:

Guy Steele pointed out a bug in the responses offered for this question and the similar question for Clowdr:
they do not allow one to specify that one spend 1 hour in Gather.

5. Survey feedback related to virtual vs. physical PLDI
This section is purely based on post-conference survey results, focusing on those questions that
relate to comparing virtual and physical conferences, with a focus on PLDI.
Question: In what ways did PLDI 2020 fall short of a physical conference?
This free-text question received a large number of responses which are presented in Appendix A.5.
Unsurprisingly, the dominant answer relates to lack of effective substitutes for physical interaction.
There are also many comments relating to the difficulties posted by time zones, and the challenge of
attending a virtual conference while in one’s regular environment, with normal life going on at the
same time. Here are some illustrative examples:
•

•
•

•

•

“No easy way to have serendipitous interactions in the hallway. I just wasn't interested in
pushing an icon around on a screen like in a video game so I didn't. I just didn't spend much
time at PLDI so I didn't get nearly as much out of it as if I had travelled to London.”
“People not being in the same time zone. Many "social" things in the late evening for Europe,
where the conference was expected to be located.”
“The physical conference provides a way to stay on the periphery and still make new
contacts. Further, the multiple tracks of the physical conference forced me to prioritize the
talks I wanted to see in person (this PLDI was intense when I tried to go to all the talks, and I
entered brain-dead state a little earlier).”
“Gathering enough momentum to be able to block hours of online PLDI time for attendees. It
is very hard to spend anywhere near the same amount of time connected with fellow
participants when sitting or standing at a computer desk anyway (or any connected
environment, really).”
“It felt like there is a bunch of high-profile people+cohorts that all know each others and
enjoy connecting with their buddies, and newcomers/outsiders/introverts may have a hard
time finding a way in or feeling to belong in the community/event. This is probably true for
physical conferences too, but online makes it much more easy to lurk and to ignore who you

•

don't know (they are just absorbed by the huge contact list and you end up searching for who
you know)”
“Colleagues and family did not understand that I was at a conference and thus do not reduce
the expectations during this period. It makes it difficult to have time to read the articles and
follow the talks. Social interaction and technical discussions are also much more difficult.”

Question: In what ways did PLDI 2020 exceed your expectations?
This free-text question received a large number of responses which are presented in Appendix A.6.
Common positive theme is the Slack-based Q&A model, the ability to catch up on material after the
event at 1.5x speed, and the clarity associated with pre-recorded talks. Here are some illustrative
examples:
•

•

•
•

•

•

“I think combining a core of proven technology (Youtube, Slack, and to some extent Zoom)
with younger experimental services like gather and clowdr was bold and effective - certainly
much better than another virtual conference I attended. The organisers clearly put a lot of
work and passion into pulling off the conference in difficult circumstances which I think was
key to making it work this well.”
“The Zoom coffee hour, mentoring channel, and AMAs really exceeded my expectations. The
most significant value of attending PLDI seemed to be the encouraged interaction with other
researchers in the community, since the majority of papers and talks now are published after
the conference anyway (not to say these aren't valuable, but the social interaction is hard to
obtain any other way), and all three of these provided a fantastic and welcoming platform to
meet and learn from both other students and senior members of the community.”
“The talks are extremely clear. Asking a question is now very easy as well as following it up in
the slack thread is very very helpful/productive.”
“The Slack seemed more bubbling and engaged than the virtual ASPLOS Slack. AMA sessions
were great and super interesting to watch as a junior researcher. Moderated Q & A seemed
to improve question quality, fewer "it's more of a comment than a question" type responses.
Mostly single-track made it easier to watch all the talks I wanted to see live. Video abstracts
were awesome, great to be able to get high-level overviews of lots of talks before seeing the
whole thing.”
“Probably better attendance than a physical conference, and probably slightly more polished
talks. Talk Q/A also worked well, maybe better than a physical conference, since overflow
questions could easily be answered electronically. Easier to attend the subset of talks I'm
really interested in.”
“The asynchronous question mechanism was amazing, I got a lot more discussion on my
paper than in many regular conferences. It was also great to be able to rewind/pause the
talks on youtube, and even to cook dinner while watching talks, etc. The slack workspace was
very active, and the ask-me-anything sessions were particularly valuable.”

Question: How does the amount of time that you spent watching the virtual conference compare
with what you might have spent, had the conference been physical, occurring under normal (nonCOVID) circumstances:

I had been expecting more disagreement here from respondents who had attended PLDI before.
The large number of first-time PLDI attendees again demonstrates the extended reach of the virtual
event.
Question: Compared to a physical conference, we did not have a hallway for informal conversations,
social interactions, and mentoring. Instead we had Gather, Clowdr, and Slack, including channels for
discussion and mentoring. For the purpose of social interaction, how did these virtual options
compare to a physical conference?

The results show that a significant number of respondents would not have attended PLDI if it had
been held physically under normal circumstances, but that most previous attendees of PLDI would
have been likely to have attended physically.

this? (Respondents were invited to select multiple options if applicable.)

While the survey results overall show a mixed appetite for virtual conferences in general, these
results show that the vast majority of respondents would attend another virtual PLDI, regardless of
whether PLDI 2020 was their first time attending the conference.

virtual?

The results make it clear that there is little appetite from the respondents for virtual conferences as
the default format for PLDI, but a lot of enthusiasm for hybrid events that combine a physical
meeting with a significant virtual component. My concern about this is that I believe a hybrid
conference may be much harder to run successfully than a fully physical or fully virtual conference,
due to the disparity between attendees who are / are not physically present.
Question: What is the maximum registration fee you estimate that you, or your employer or
institution, would have been willing to pay in order for you to attend virtual PLDI 2020, if you had
known in advance what the conference would offer?
In the results, “Nothing” is short for “Nothing: I would only have attended if there was no fee”, and
“Typical SIGPLAN” is short for “I think it would be reasonable to charge the fees associated with a
typical SIGPLAN conference”.
Results, shown with respect to:

The results suggest that charging up to 50 USD for registration would deter a substantial, but
perhaps not insurmountable, number of attendees. Most attendees who would be unwilling to pay
to attend PLDI were first-time attendees.

6. Diversity and inclusion
I present demographic data obtained from YouTube related to viewers of the conference material
(Section 6.1), and demographic data obtained during conference registration and via the postconference survey (Section 6.2). I present the data as is and have refrained from discussing it in
depth; I believe it is valuable to make this data available to the community to inform initiatives that
aim to increase diversity, yet analysis of demographic data is not within my area of expertise. I then
give details of post-conference survey results related to time-zones (Section 6.3).

6.1. Demographic data from YouTube
Recall from Section 4.2 that, during the week of PLDI 2020, the ACM SIGPLAN YouTube channel saw
a great deal of activity, principally due to the live streaming of PLDI events.
YouTube provides analytics data on the age, gender and country associated with viewers. According
to the “Audience” section of this page on YouTube Studio analytics basics, age and gender “is based
on signed in viewers across all devices”, while country “is based on IP address”. The page also states

the following caveat, which should be borne in mind when interpreting these results: “Note that you
may only see demographics data for a subset of your viewers. The data may not represent the overall
composition of your traffic.”

percentages associated with Female and Male in Figure 3 do correspond roughly to the percentages
associated with identifying as Female and identifying as Male in the data on gender identity
collected during conference registration and via the post-conference survey (see Section 6.2).
However, the data cannot be directly compared because gender and gender identity are not the
same thing.

6.2. Demographic data collected at registration and via the post-conference survey
The PLDI 2020 registration form featured a set of demographic-related questions that were used
during POPL 2020 registration, and that I presume evolved via their use during registration for other
ACM SIGPLAN conferences. I used the POPL 2020 questions except that I added more options to the
question about ethnicity. I repeated these questions verbatim in the post-conference questionnaire
to allow comparing registration results with post-conference results.
I present results for registration-gathered data over: the whole data set (called “Registered” in the
charts below); the data set restricted to those registrants who subsequently joined the conference’s
Slack workspace (called “On Slack” below); and the data set restricted to those registrants who
posted at least one message on the Slack workspace (called “Active on Slack” below). I felt this was
important because the very large number of overall registrants might give an inaccurate impression
of diversity at PLDI given that we do not know whether a large proportion of those registrants – the
ones who did not join Slack – engaged further.
Results for respondents of the post-conference survey are labelled “Post-conference” in the charts
below.
Question: To which gender identity do you most identify?
Results, with numbers of responses as follows:
• Registered: 3817 responses
• On Slack: 2431 responses

Because respondents could select more than one option, the percentages associated with each data
set sum to slightly more than 100%. I still felt that it made sense to present percentages rather than

raw numbers because I wanted to compare the “Registered”, “On Slack”, “Active on Slack” and
“Post-conference” data sets, which have different sizes. Data labels next to bars are omitted as they

attributed to a drop-off in numbers from China.

6.3. Time zones
The survey included questions to understand the distribution of time zones inhabited by attendees,
attendees’ attitudes towards taking time zones into account to make virtual conferences more
inclusive, and attendees’ views on a number of potential approaches.

Question: Ways to mitigate the effects of time zones include spreading out the schedule and
mirroring key events such as Q&A 12 hours later (so that regardless of time zone, one or other edition
of the event will be accessible at a reasonable time). Assuming roughly 8 hours of content per day,
which of the following approaches to handling time zones would you prefer organisers to take for
future virtual conferences of a similar size to PLDI? Respondents were allowed to select multiple
options and were asked to select the options they thought were strongly preferable.

Unfortunately, the somewhat uniform distribution of responses does not give a strong steer. The
most popular option – “Spread live activities over 12 hours (5am-5pm), without parallel tracks and

with short breaks.” – is the model used for PLDI. It should be borne in mind, though, that most
survey respondents were in time zones for which the PLDI model proved to be convenient.
Many ideas for ways to mitigate the effects of time zones were provided as free-text answers; they
are included in Appendix A.12.

7. Acknowledgements
I am grateful to Dan Grossman and Michelle Strout for their feedback on an earlier draft of this
report.
Many of the questions for the post-conference survey used for PLDI 2020 were inspired questions
asked in the post-conference survey for the recent EDBT/ICDT virtual event (Bonifati, et al., 2020).
Thanks to Dan Grossman, Jeff Foster, Benjamin Pierce, Emina Torlak, Stephanie Weirich and John
Wickerson for providing feedback on the survey questions.
The “Guide to Best Practices for Virtual Conferences” from the ACM Presidential Task Force on What
Conferences Can Do to Replace Face-to-Face Meetings was an extremely valuable resource in the
design of virtual PLDI (ACM Presidential Task Force on What Conferences Can Do to Replace Face to
Face Meetings, 2020), as was this report on the ASPLOS 2020 virtual conference.
I received a lot of advice and encouragement from Crista Lopes and Benjamin Pierce on virtual
conferences, including useful details of the pros and cons of the various tools that are available. I
benefited from several discussions with Milind Kulkarni, who was setting up a virtual version of
PLMW to run in the same week as PLDI, related to virtual conferencing technology. Jonathan Bell
put an enormous amount of effort into getting an early version of Clowdr ready for PLDI so that we
could benefit from video chatrooms. Jonathan also provided invaluable advice related to technical
aspects of Slack.
I am extremely grateful to the PLDI 2020 Organizing Committee for the hard work they put in to
make the conference a success. Extra special thanks are due to: Dan Iorga (Student Volunteer
Captain), who helped me figure out every logistically aspect of the virtual conference, including the
intricacies of Zoom, Slack and YouTube live streaming, and who worked tirelessly to make sure we
had every base covered; John Wilkerson (Publicity Chair), who, as well as doing a brilliant job of all
aspects of publicity, was a constant source of advice and a willing sounding board for my thoughts
on how the virtual conference would work; Emina Torlak (Program Chair), who – in addition to doing
an outstanding job of all the standard duties of a Program Chair – worked with me to figure out a
suitable program for the virtual event, and took care of communicating the many details of how the
virtual conference would work with paper authors and session chairs; Annabel Satin (Conference
Manager), for support throughout the organization of PLDI, and in particular for taking care of the
steps necessary to cancel the physical meeting; Stefan Marr (Workshops and Tutorials Chair), who
worked with the organizers of the many co-located events to figure out a suitable format via which
they could run virtually; Manu Sridharan (Sponsorship co-chair), for liaising with the corporate
sponsors of PLDI 2020 to work out suitable alternative sponsor perks when we moved to a virtual
conference format; and Na Meng (Web chair), for putting in a lot of extra hours in relation to the
website changes that were necessitated by moving from physical to virtual PLDI.
Special thanks also to Mike Moshell at Registration Systems Labs for extra work relating to the
unexpected registration needs of the virtual event; J.C. Peeples at ACM for support with setting up
contract related to the virtual event at short notice; and Elmer van Chastelet and Danny
Groenewegen from researchr for integrating a Slack sign-up system with the registration system.

Appendix: responses to free-text questions

A.1. Responses to “Which meeting mode do you think would have been best for the
PLDI Research Papers track?”
PLDI 2020 *but* speakers get some visible feed
of audience. Speaking to dead air is tough.
A mix between broadcast and async: i.e., prerecorded videos available far in advance (even
1+ week; this is to alleviate time-zone issues,
too) coupled with live re-broadcast combined
with live Q&A sessions.
Just like PLDI, but with an option to drop into
an extended discussion with the authors
(including audio / video?) either after the talk
or after the session
Combination of asynchronous for longer
presentations and broadcast for short
presentations.

I cant decide between option [broadcast] and
[asynchronous]. Maybe next time we should try
[asynchronous], just to get the difference to
[broadcast]?
Prerecorded talks but live Q&A with typed
questions
Meeting mode, but with a smaller live
audience, make talks more interactive
pre-recorded video, but a live session for each
paper Q&A as well as asynchronous Q&A
messages.
Stick with the PLDI 2020 approach *but make
pre-recorded videos available earlier*. That is,
be primarily synchronous, but allow people
who cannot be awake during the main session

preview the talk so they can ask questions in
advance.
Asynchronous videos available a week before
the conference, then a one day meeting that is
synchronous with live Q&A
I like broadcast, but missed all the papers I
wanted because of time zones & conflicts. Need
both broadcast and live.
I think videos should always be pre-recorded
and available, regardless of the approach. Q&A
seems to be better if it is done live.
Meeting mode + a text-based platform for Q&A
of virtual attenders
Broadcast via PeerTube (rather than YouTube)
followed by live questions on Jitsi (rather than
Zoom)
Again: the presentations should be available at
the beginning of the entire PLDI event (since
they are recorded anyway). Only discussion
gains something from being live. There should
be no cap on number of participants - that is
ridiculous. Asking questions in text worked fine.
broadcast mode but with a better app for
questions, with up votes and the like
The PLDI mode, but enhanced somehow for the
audience to make their presence and their
feelings more manifest. Eg, a bar with the name
and photo of each participant. And the
participant should have gestures, eg "clap",
"laugh" as in Teams. And the discussion should
be organised as a tree, so that participants can
ask follow-up questions, or refine another
participant's questions.
Asynchronous, but with opportunities to meet
virtually for Q&A and networking.
A number of attendees should be present in the
Zoom meeting, with the others watching the
live stream and asking questions in text format.

PLDI mode but with pre-recorded videos
available, if for some reason broadcasting the
recording doesn't work or if the timezone is not
compatible
See the idea I wrote on the previous page.
Failing that, probably broadcast mode, or
asynchronous but with live Q&A at designated
times.
I like things that are live -- not only QA but also
the talk. So I'd prefer authors to give live talks.
QA should also be live but it's okay there is no
video (slack/slido works well for me, if not
better).
Asynchronous mode as described above, but
additionally with a live session for Q&A for each
paper. Every 20min, a new live Q&A session
would start, but if people want, they can
continue a Q&A session for as long as they
want, while the next Q&A sessions already are
happening in a different room
Asynchronous long talks, synchronous lightning
talks, live Q&A.
make all talks prerecorded, broadcast them on
a central channel (like TV). All Q&A async
online via a forum with text questions and
responses (though encourage the author to
promptly answer questions after their talk is
broadcast). The session chair could read out
interesting questions and answers after a
broadcast if they wanted. The broadcast could
replay a talk multiple times during a
conferences for international people.
Live sessions but made the talks available
earlier

A.2. Responses to “Which meeting mode do you think would have been best for the
PLDI Ask Me Anything track?”
PLDI 2020 approach *followed by* a social
session in a tool like gather or clowdr
Same as previous question (so, PLDI 2020 with
some audience to look at)
Broadcast mode, but with no interviewer.
Hybrid of Asynch and Broadcast: use a textbased platform to pre-queue questions that can

be "upvoted" by the community (akin to how
AMAs are done on Reddit), which the guests
then answer via broadcast. The difference here
from plain Broadcast is opening up questions
early, which also allows guests to come up with
more thorough answers ahead of time.
Meeting mode, but with a smaller live audience

I like the broadcast mode, because it removes
the risk of AMA attendess playing the "here is a
statement of my opinions disguised as a
question" trick, or taking too long to get to the
point of their question.
1st option, but the Q&A should be integrated
with the broadcasting platform
Did not attend
Did not attend this track
It was good as it was run
The Simon P-J AMA began in PLDI2020 mode,
and moved to a more informal chat on Crowdr
after a while. This worked well, and might be
worth repeating (a PLDI2020, more formal
segment to start, moving to a more informal
"meeting mode")

Asking questions in text, and having them read
out loud by a moderator, seems fine. ***As
long as the moderator is reading questions
from the audience***; not having his own
conversation with the guest.
broadcast mode but with a better app for
questions, with up votes and the like
The PLDI mode, again, but with the
enhancements I proposed for Research Papers.
asynchronous mode (pre-registered talks), with
authors available in a large meeting session
(e.g. zoom with 300 participants), so that one
or more authors can have live Q&A
A number of attendees should be present in the

live stream and asking questions in text format.

A.3. Responses to “Please share your thoughts on how well the Q&A process of
Slack-based questions answered live by authors / guests worked.”
The AMAs were so great!
I found that one strength was that slack
provided a natural place to continue a
discussion with others after the end of the
formal Q&A.
The interactions went pretty well. However, the
slack UI is inconvenient for live Q&A. I would
prefer a platform with permanent links, multitab browsing, powerful searching and low
resource consumption. Presumably some
Hacker News/Reddit-like/forum-style UI but
with live comments/posts updating.
It was pretty good. I find the fact that coauthors can answer live on Slack a benefit,
which I've seen work in other, physical,
conferences too. I also like having questions
moderated and relayed by session chairs. I
think that really helps avoid grandstanding by
big names.
I thought this process worked incredibly well! I
would highly recommend using this same
message in future years.
This seemed to work pretty decently. It was
nice to have the opportunity for authors to
answer more questions than time permitted in
the actual session in the Slack.
I thought we could have more freedom on
Slack. For example in research paper sessions,

Q&A were restricted in each thread, but
discussing on a thread is difficult. Discussing on
the main channel (out of threads) would
practically work for non-parallel sessions. I
annually attend a local symposium in Japan,
where people talk on IRC-based chat in parallel
to the presentation. A single channel is working
fine there. We might want to have more
asynchronous discussions on Slack, not just for
posting questions for each presentation,
because we had timezone differences.
Q&A was typically too brief, but I appreciate
some talks attracted less questions and so it
depended heavily on the level of interest
expressed.
I liked the Q&A process of PLMW, where
questions could be upvoted. In this way, the
questions got answered that most people were
interested in, and not the questions that came
in first.
I enjoyed the Q&A sessions. Text-based
questions forced the "askers" to be very concise
and the host was able to relay questions in a
way that connected different topics well.
I liked it better than live conferences. Far more
effective medium for asking questions (no
waiting in line, no worrying about how loud to
speak, confusion over accents, etc.) And, easy
to spawn followup discussion.

Barring one, all my questions were asked. I
especially liked the way some of the session
chairs of AMA sessions grouped the questions
and paraphrased them (sometimes) to maintain
the flow of the interview.
I think one-channel-per-paper from past
conferences fits better the Slack interface, and I
remember no complaints about that interface.
Channels are easier to find, navigate, and
subscribe to, and still allow posting questions in
advance, while threads can only use a small
right column and lack subthreads (which would
have been sometimes sensible!).
They worked very nicely especially given that
the authors are monitoring their threads.
Given the learning hurdle that the use of
separate question threads had I think it went
really well. I think having separate rooms or
channels for each Q&A would have worked less
well
I don't think Slack is the right tool for this kind
of a process. The questions were suppose to be
posted into threads, and Slack is terrible when
it comes to thread-based discussion.
I appreciate the questions being repeated by
the chairs (it's much smoother than waiting for
the question-askers to check their mics, volume
levels, synchronization, etc.) -- keep up the
good work! I think that it may be fine to extend
the Q&A though (as some of the sessions ran
out of time).
Worked really well.
I thought the Q&A process of Slack-based
questions read by a moderator and answered
live was excellent. I adored the "Ask Me
Anything" sessions and was very happy that you
let most of them run long. (45 minutes seemed
about right for most of them.)
Decently, but ideally one would have a
dedicated solution for this where questions can
be up/downvoted, discussion threads organized
and moderated around questions with all paper
authors able to thoroughly address questions
asynchronously instead of improvising during a
live talk.
It went well.
It worked great! It could be improved by
finding a way to facilitate more interactive Q&A
outside the official slot (as suggested above)

I think it worked at least as well as live. I'm not
sure whether meeting mode and occasional
back and forth might have made things more
interesting, but it was fine as is. The improved
overflow question handling and ability to defer
answers is a significant advantage over live.
I liked the Q&A process a lot. I didn't ask
questions, but I found the interaction mode,
where moderators fielded the questions, simple
and efficient. The one issue I saw was that
some moderators are better than others at this
process. Some just went from the top to the
bottom, which is not great because it
advantages people who ask questions many
hours before the talk even happens and takes
neither continuity nor general interest in a
question into account. Others tried to ask the
most popular questions and perhaps group
those with a similar theme, both of which are
nice approaches. This is a bit harder with Slack
though since it does not sort based on likes or
something like that. On the other hand, having
everything centralized in the same service and
saved for posterity is a big win. Perhaps there is
a way to integrate something like Sli.do and
Slack, which seems to combine the best of both
worlds?
Very well
Slack is a mess. Many people and conferences
like it, but it does not make any sense to me.
The format was great. The asynchronicity of it
allowed questions to continue indefinitely as
well as to have several questions immediately
at the end of the talk. The only thing that might
be improved is to have the talk videos available
sooner so that interested parties may be able
to ask well-formed/thought out questions in
advance (to be answered at the end of the talk,
live) allowing follow up questions to their
original questions.
A sli.do solution may have been better: gives
people upvotes to make the interesting
questions bubble up to the top.
Fine
Worked great.
It worked really, really well. In some cases, for
example, clarifying questions or statements
were provided in Slack, based on answers, and
were picked up by the moderator. It yielded a

really effective back & forth. In some cases,
moderators simply read questions from the
top, which was a little less interesting. Effective
moderators grouped questions together to
forms themes that directed the arc of the Q&A
or AMA. Some clarity around voting for
questions may have helped weaker moderators
pick more interesting questions.
It worked out well.
I think that it worked very well. In the papers it
may have been better for the moderator to pick
and choose questions instead of just asking
them in the order that they came in, since that
may just focus on questions from earlier in the
presentation
It is fantastic, the actual Q&A discussion can go
on without stop after the designated Q&A
session, which is roughly 3-5 minutes.
Pretty good. In the AMA's it was very smooth
with the interviewer picking up one question
after another and if he knew about the topic as
well, sometimes even improving on the
question through formulation or explanation.
Instead of asking a new question, one can also
upvote another. It was good that QA could
continue after the session.
It worked very well, save for too little time to
answer all the questions.
Mostly very well, to the point that I think I
would actually prefer asking questions using
Slack at live conferences over queuing at a mic.
I quickly learned that I should put questions in
the Slack as I encountered them, rather than
trying to save them for the end of the talk. This
risks some redundancy in questions with the
talk content, though.
From my experience, it was superior to QA on a
physical conference. There wasn't any problem
with not being able to hear questions properly,
it was easier to ask questions (in particular for
introvert people), it was possible to ask and
answer more questions. I don't think that the
Slack-interface was ideal through (in particular
with respect of threading) and I think that it is a
shame that QAs are not persistently available.
It worked fairly well in my tutorial where a
couple my students helped to moderate the
questions, and directly answered some
questions directly. Something like that can also
be done by author teams.

I think Slack works very well. (I was GC of ICFP
2017, which I think was the first SIGPLAN
conference to commit to livestreaming talks.
We used Slack there too.)
Extremely well! One of the strong aspects of a
virtual conference.
I think it was the same quality as or even better
than the Q&A process of a physical conference.
Worked well, it was nice that speakers
continued answering remaining questions after
the time scheduled for questions on video ran
out.
I think most authors only answered about 2-3
questions from slack live, but most answered
the remaining questions afterwards. If we do
have a more spread out schedule, it might be
possible to give authors more time for Q&A
(say 10 minutes?) but this time is specially
demarcated so their talks can't spill into it.
Prefer not to submit
It worked pretty well.
I did not quite understand how it worked. The
instructions for all of the different online
platforms were a bit confusing.
I don't think that it worked at all well, because I
don't find that slack is a very useful platform.
I only asked questions at AMAs. That was
great! The moderators did an excellent job, as
did the AMA-ers themselves of course.
I think it worked fairly well. I like the fact that
there is a host moderating / asking questions
and interacting with the speaker. I think having
a large meeting session with some capped
virtual attendees can work as well, but will still
need some host moderating so that not
everyone speak at once. The only main
advantage of the virtual attendees with audio is
that once a question is asked, there can be
more smooth back and forth between the
speaker and the person asking the question
clarifying. However, depending on the size of
the meeting, there may be network bandwidth
issue and fairness issue (who to let in and
should it always be first come first serve?)
I really liked it as one can ask questions in the
relevant channel and/or relevant paper.
I thought it worked well. I liked that people
used thumbs-up to elevate common questions.

I sort of like the idea of people asking questions
on video, if possible, but that may be tough to
sort out.
no difference from physical conference
Need more time for questions! I only had time
to answer one question. I also didn't like the
thread thingy. People should have been
allowed to ask questions on: youtube live chat,
slack by flagging the @author or even twitter
by using a special hashtag. The latter in my
opinion is a missed opportunity.
I was a co-author. The Q&A process worked
well. It is possible to get overwhelmed since
there is no physical world-based rate limiting. I
believe we spent about 2 hours handling
questions, post-talk. But we were very pleased
with them.
It was okay
It worked really well I think! In the PLMW sli.do
was used, which also allowed Polls for the
viewers and upvoting of questions, which
worked really well too. I think a little bit more
sophistication for the Q&A process could help,
but it definitely worked well in my experience!
I'm not sure if the host is needed to go through
the questions. Paper authors should be able to
read questions in Slack even faster than the
host. Maybe even during the video since they
are not actually presenting anything.
N/A
As I already mentioned above, I think it worked
pretty well and I hope it stays also in the future.
It was OK. But allowing questions to "bubble
up" when upvoted, and removing questions
that have been answered (as done by Sli.do)
would have helped.
Very well. The thumbs up / voting system that
naturally formed was also useful.
I feel like this process did a good job!
I like it a lot, much better than people getting
up to ask questions. Questions can be a lot
more crisply formulated, over an extended
period of time. Chairs/speakers can choose
good questions rather than wasting space on
prominent audience members asking silly
questions. Discussion can (and did) continue
after the session. It's inevitable that some
speakers don't get a good Q&A afterwards, and

it also happens in a physical conference, it's just
a little less noticeable because it doesn't leave a
written trace. (I was a big fan of Slack-based
questions used in physical conferences in the
last few years.) That said, we should reconsider the use of Slack. I think open-source
tools like Zulip are now as competitive as Slack.
It was very confusing to see different tracks
using different ways to handle Q&A (external
service, pinned message threads in slack, real
time post in slack, etc)
When the chair selected and asked the
questions it was great. When authors/guests
read questions themselves it was a bit
awkward.
Pretty well. I think in a physical conference,
many times questions time is over and then the
question is never made. Here the questions can
be made even after the session continued or it
was even over. I think this was a huge plus
I loved the fact that, if not all questions could
be answered during the live session, the
authors could still engage virtually and answer
all questions anyway.
It worked very well! Thanks to the slack
threads, many more questions than physically
could be answered by authors in a way that is
visible to everyone.
I think it was excellent. In fact better than a
conference because all questions were at one
place and the authors could respond to them in
detail.
Overall good
Some moderators asked the questions in linear
order until time was up. There were some
cases when it might have been better for the
moderator to choose questions further down in
the list. Overall, that part was better than at a
physical conference, because the authors
typically answered the remaining questions via
responding in the Slack channel. Thus, more
questions were posed, and more were
answered overall. If one had a hybrid
conference, that aspect would very likely be
lost (assuming that speakers were physically at
the conference, there might be distractions to
getting answers to all questions posed on
Slack). It would have been more convenient if
Slack would have supplied Name + Affiliation,
rather than just the Name. It was a minor

nuisance to have to remember to always
provide one's affiliation.
One thread per presentation is not desirable. It
is difficult to find the questions, or add to a
given question, or for the speaker to answer
offline - Questions should be handled in the
slack channel, allowing threads for each
question
It worked quite well. One suggestion: it would
be nice if questions could be upvoted (similar to
Slido) such that the best questions got asked in
person. I found often interesting questions with
many likes got skipped over in favor of less
interesting questions simply due to the order in
which they were asked.
It's better: q&a is recorded; and the authors
have time to prepare for answers.
It was great. Pretty smooth.
I think it was okay, but one impedance
mismatch is that it's hard to map Slack channel
questions to the video, time-stamp wise.
PLDI's live Q&A session where the author
speaks is critically important, and contributed a
lot. Text-only Q&A (in the style of ASPLOS) is
just not an acceptable substitute. The one
downside is that the full videos were not
posted in advance, and the audience was not
encouraged to ask questions in advance. It
would be better if PLDI encouraged some
people to ask questions in advance (like ISCA).
It worked amazingly. I think it's one the mostimproved features in comparison to live events.
Right questions were askes, with good
reponses.
Right questions were asked, with good
responses
Slack Q&A + live answer session was excellent.
Great
My Q didn't get answered, but I totally loved
the AMA interviewees, and their answers.
Slack worked reasonably well and can also
allow typing in questions while the talk is going
on.
Seemed fine. Would be nice if the platform
allowed threads-within-threads, so questions
could be grouped with answers.
It didn't work very well.

I think Q&A was one of the highlights of PLDI. I
think I attended those sessions more than
anything else. One improvement could be to
take questions on an asynchronous platform
such as a Discourse forum so that the guest's
responses to those questions are later
available. Think of Reddit AMA, for example.
That discussion holds far too much value for
posterity to be lost in the walled garden of
Slack.
worked well
This worked great! I do not think I have seen
anything like this and I think the organizers
figure this one out really well. As I wrote
before, if researchr program and slack threads
were one thing, that might be a bit simpler for
everyone.
The Q&A format on Slack worked really well for
the AMAs.

for me. I mostly ended up chatting privately

It worked great
I loved it!
I thought it worked really well. It also
contributed to the feeling participating in a
communal event.
It worked okay, but there's room for
improvement, e.g. one thread per presentation
was difficult to navigate. As an alternative, Slido
worked better for seeing which questions had
most votes or were already answered, but
doesn't offer a good story for authors later
answering additional questions in chat.
It was surprisingly good. For AMA slido-like
voting might have been more appropriate, but
if sessions are allowed to run long, Slack is ok.
And people organized to like questions, which
was nice. Regular talks worked just great, and
authors followed up on most questions
It worked fine, although the interaction feels
weak
my main issue was with the slack interface and
timing of pinned threads. I mentioned my
issues in the #lessons-learned channel. Basically
slack is not ideal for this, and would have been
better to have a channel per video. Zulip

provides the ability to associate messages with
distinct topics that might help with the UX. A
reddit like interface too would be interesting to
consider, however having all the textual
communication via a single app would be good.
It was very nice to have written questions
visible by all and also reponses from authors. I
did not found how to same them during the
conference. It's a pitty.

I think the Q&A via Slack worked well. The

ahead of their answer. There are much less
miscommunication issues.

Overall, much better than in Iive conferences,
because the questions, being written, were

expressed better. But sometimes the chairs did
not apply judgment when picking questions,
and just asked them in sequence.
It happened 1 or 2 times that there's no
question at slack at the moment the
presentation ended because youtube live
streaming have some time gap with zoom. this
isn't a big deal since they could still answer
those questions on slack.
For the talks, I thought it worked great -- my
only complaint was that I wished the question
sessions were longer! The AmA sessions were
very good because the interviewer could stand
in for the audience. Really requires that both
interviewer and guest have good mics and fast
internet connections though!
I thought it worked very well. I was a session
chair and was very pleased with the quality and
depth of questions. It allowed me to batch
multiple questions together, encouraged a
broader range of questioners, and gave the
authors a chance to answer all questions, even
if only on Slack later. If anything, given the
amount of questions, I'd argue to make the
talks a couple minutes shorter and provide
*more* time for questions.
It seemed to work fairly well, although it wasn't
transparent what would make a session chair
choose to read out one question from Slack vs.
another. This is of course similar in a physical
conference, but could be biased in different
ways: the question is known beforehand, and
some names are hard to pronounce. I liked how
even if your question wasn't asked live, the
authors would typically have time to answer
your question later on Slack, which is easier on
the part of the questioner than at a physical
conference.

Generally good; would be better if more

very well. but I would use a channel per session
instead of a thread, just to allow for more
complex interactions
Q&A + Slack was great, and could even be used
for physical conference to keep track of
questions and answers that the author did not
have time to give at the end of talk.
It seemed to work very well.
Very well. I do think the quality of the AMAs
depended a lot on the moderator, best ones
were the ones where the questions were
weaved into a narrative (e.g., Cook's, Lattner's).
I liked it a lot more than normal QA. Adding a
mechanism to upvote a question might be a
good addition.
I read some Q&A on slack and they are helpful
to me
It worked really well. I liked the slack-based
management of questions: they remains in the
thread and could get answered later fostering
discussions. Moreover questions more
interesting gets more feedback and could be
preferred to those less interesting for the
community, when there is short time. Cool.
It worked reasonably well, but the Slack
interface is not optimized for such as format.
Perhaps one channel per talk would have been
a better organization.
The idea of bundling the questions in a
threadbased system like Slack is great, but the
problem seem to be that Slack threads are
linear, with the Reponses from the author it
often became quite messy. Something with
nested reply (reddit style) would make more
sense to me.
It was okay, but the Q&A interface within a
Slack thread was somewhat inconvenient. The
linear structure stifled conversations. Ideally,
one would have some specialized tool.
It did work quite well, and it definitely saved
the time that would be required for getting
asking people properly unmuted.
this mostly worked - though the opportunity for
followup and post-talk hallway track discussion

needs very serious attention. And Q&A time
was often cut short
The Q&A worked really well, especially since it
allowed extra questions to be asked even if the
time runs out, and the answers to the questions
are available publicly for anyone interested to
see as well.
Some questions seemed to missed. The fact
that authors/presenters can go back to the
slack thread is a good point.
Slack is very linear, and scrolling backwards at
least in the Linux app is not easy. So it was hard
to find the links for the paper discussion
channels, since they were all entered at once
before the conference and other
announcements came after them. Switching
back and forth between the program to find
out what is going on and the slack to find the
youtube link was also inconvenient.
Good
This worked reasonably well.
In some cases, it was harder for the speaker to
understand what the question was about. It
would have been better if there could have
been a direct communication, such that the
person who asked the question could clarify
what they meant.
I think it worked reasonably well considering
the circumstances
Reasonably well.
Given the limitations of Slack I think it would be
better to have one post (with attendant thread)
per question rather than one per paper. That
probably requires one slack channel per session
to avoid getting out of hand; but maybe that's
ok. It's important to be able to easily find
questions from earlier talks for followup, and
slack isn't good for this unless you post
"following" in every one you want to check
back on, which should certainly not be
encouraged. Also, given that there's been quite
a bit of subsequent discussion for some of the
papers, I think it works better if the authors
also post their answers afterwards -- some did
(AFAICR) and that made things easier when
checking back later.
Love it! I think Slack definitely works. I actually
find it better than the physical QA. I also like
Slido.

It worked well. More interactions between the
authors and the audiences would be better.
Several research managed to answer many
questions quite effectively which was amazing.
I think this is a great way to moderate
questions and hopefully similar strategy can be
used in the future.
should put the authors after the talks in gather
to answer further questions and mimic physical
conferences
The live questions went well, though I cannot
comment on the follow-up Q&A on Slack. This
would be very important (to take the place of
the after-track conversations at a physical
conference).
It was perfect!
kind of ok, but we should have 1 channel per
paper rather than 1 thread
I really liked it. I especially appreciated getting
to read and consider the questions while my
talk was playing.
It worked well, though Slack's interface is
inconvenient for this: would be good to have
permalinks from outside, without need for
scrolling. It was very nice to get to see answers
to _everyone's questions.
I think it worked fine. However, at times there
was not much time for answering many
questions.
it worked very well I think; having a single
channel with a thread for each paper worked
perfectly with slack
Good
QA worked perfectly
Worked fairly well. One nicer feature would
have been to enable separate private channels
for each paper that anyone can request to join.
Essentially it would enable multiple threads for
different topics. I found answering questions to
be slightly hectic.
slido is better, but the Q&A in slack is definitely
better than what zoom offers. The key better
features in slido are that questions can be
moderated, questions can be sorted by how
upvoted they are, and questions indicated as
answered are removed from the "live" list.

I think answering questions live was not very
helpful, but the slack was good and allowed for
many questions and good discussions.

think an archive of all the questions will be
quite valuable in the future.

I very much liked being able to queue
questions, which the authors can then come

A.4. Responses to “Do you have suggestions for ways to provide more social
interactions, networking or mentoring opportunities at a virtual conference?”
More breaks in the schedule with an explicit
call to meet up and chat.
See above re clowdr. Offer routine group video
meetings for the audience following a session,
as an automatic follow-on from the
presentation platform. Possibly even with
automated subgroup partitioning (although one
might want some opportunity to feed in private
preferences: if there's a space with X, I would
like to talk with them; please don't drop me in a
group with Y).
More meetings of the Zoom coffee hour style,
where conversations are small (roughly 5
people), time-limited, and randomized. In my
experience, these events were orders of
magnitude better at encouraging participation
and interaction than any of the other platforms
despite significant effort to take advantage of
the other platforms, and provided many of the
most valuable experiences from the
conference. The other incredibly value tool was
the #mentoring channel: having mentors
introduce themselves and explicitly state that
they are available for mentoring made them
much more approachable, and I had multiple
incredibly rewarding interactions with
researchers I've looked up to for many years
because of this channel
The unofficially organized Zoom virtual coffee
hours that Rachit and Irene put together
seemed to work the best of the available
options. Gather seems like a really nice idea,
but would definitely need a lot of work on
reliability before it could really be useful.
I think PLDI did tremendously well with trying
to establish social interactions. However, I think
if you are not already in the "in-group" (I'm
more in the SE community, ICSE/FSE/OOPSLA),
it's very hard to initiate the same levels of
interaction. The mentoring channel was
fantastic and I think that worked probably even
better than it would have in person (I had 5

mentoring conversations that I think would not
have happened in London). Final 2ct: I think
virtual conferences have their place and we
should continue trying to innovate. But I still
would like to see at least 1 larger in-person
community gathering per year.
Start asynchronous communications (e.g. Slack)
enough earlier (e.g. ~2 wk) than the virtual
conference.
Schedule time for social interaction. The PLDI
programme was too full, so it wasn't clear when
people would likely be on gather.
The list of attendees is not known. I mostly
tried to look up (in Slack DM) the names of the
people I thought are attending. This means I
could be missing a ton of other people.
During IEEE S&P there was a slack bot called
Donuts that was starting a private chat with a
random member of the audience twice a day.
This helped (and strongly invited) to connect
with people as there was no need for initiating
the chat (as was necessary with gather)
It would be nice to know the topic of discussion
before joining a group.
Consider non-video-centric social interaction
(including text chat, audio-only).
More scheduled short breaks where video
interactions can happen. Potentially,
conference official "coffee breaks" where
people are semi-randomly or by topic assigned
to rooms of 5-10.
I think I need to become accustomed to these
kinds of social interactions. In person, I can
remain on the periphery until some strong
personality pulls me in, or until I feel
comfortable speaking up. It's more difficult for
me to speak up in these virtual spaces, or even
to reach out to one or two people I don't know,
when everyone could be watching.
Zoom Video Chat Rooms functionality for every
participant

no there was good effort in the slack channels
I think PLDI'20 did an amazing job with social
interactions, all things considered! One other
possibility would be randomized breakout
rooms within Zoom, to really mix things up and
encourage people to meet new people. This
could replace the somewhat limited
randomness of sitting next to someone new at
lunch at a physical conference.
Not specifically. I think PLDI did an amazing job
and I would not mind having every future
conference be virtual if they worked similarly.
The organizers did a truly wonderful job. This is
a first of a kind, nearly all possible options to
create a great online PLDI experience have
been offered. Of course, this is only a first of a
kind. But I don't have concrete suggestions at
this point.
Keep the mentoring and recruiting channels!
Have more topic-focused chat rooms baked
into the platform, for instance, right after a
session. Have dedicated slots for socializing.
Let's brainstorm more creatively to
accommodate different time zones.
I think this PLDI is the greatest example of how
should we achieve this goal.
Mentoring sounds like a formal and difficult
process. I guess thats not what they meant, the
mentioning of job offers discouraged me from
talking to them, as I am not looking for a job,
currently. I would not know about what, how or
why I should talk to them. I would appreciate
the ability to ask people what they are working
on. I really missed the ability to walk around a
poster room with people standing nearby.
Although the interesting posters are often
occupied, the last time real life time I have
been in a poster session, there has always been
someone free and empty, that you can get into
an in-depth talk on what, why and how they are
working.
Pick one platform and stick with it. Was I
supposed to be on Zoom? Slack? Cloudr?
Gather? Youtube? It was too technologically
fragmented.
Arrange for small groups of people to meet on
Gather. At POPL 2020, there were mentoring
breakfasts with about 5-6 people per table.
Similar events can be held over Gather, we just
need some rules on how to make them work.

Have a designated "social time" that specifies
gathering in one of the gathering spaces (there
were three if you include Slack).
I suggest sticking to exactly 1 social platform
that supports both text and video. I am hopeful
that we will have better options available for
the next conference!
Clearly specify times when people should
gather and have a single platform for
interactions and make the user experience
smoother (minimize possible technical issues,
improve user interface, etc.). See my comments
to Gather for more specific suggestions.
Make talks live and interactive. The content of
the research is what brings us together and
provides a starting point for a conversation,
also for new people in the field. The online
environment provides new opportunities for
having conversations around paper
presentations.
If this isn't entirely hopeless, maybe BoF
sessions (where people sign up in advance and
then show up in a virtual room to discuss a
specific topic they all care about) would be the
best idea.
I initiated a clowdr room right after the session
that had my paper in it, and invited the other
authors from that session along with anyone
interested. This worked well, and we had
interests in common. I think it would be good
to have designated post-session gather/clowdr
times.
Maybe a signup form for people where people
are matched into random groups so they can

Prefer not to submit
Accessibility is important. Not having meals
together was a major bummer. That is usually
when I meet most people at conferences. I
think some kind of shared online activity that is
not a meal would help with that, like an online
game.
A help or overview of the different features
would have been great--Gather, Clowdr, Slack,
Zoom, and Youtube were all in play, but I
wasn't sure where to go for what or when.
However, I wasn't able to take time off to
virtually attend PLDI, so maybe this was more
obvious to people with more time to devote to
it. But I really appreciated being able to attend

remotely and casually, as I wouldn't have been
able to attend at all otherwise.
It is necessary that every tool given is accessible
by Free and open source software. That's the
only way to make independent and sovereign
research.
I think a Clowdr/Slack integration might have
been helpful. On Slack, I got notifications when
somebody sent me a message. Having a
#lobby channel might have done the trick.
Have less options and more clear instructions
so that it's easy to find the information.
Move to a more asynchronous model perhaps
and promote further interaction in the days
before and after the conference.
The mentoring 1:1 meetings worked really well.
As someone who's had to extensively work
remotely with frequent travel (literally
travelling every 5 days for over half a year), I
found prep work to be the most effective way
to make meetings more impactful. Having said
that: the social interactions should be held at
least once BEFORE the conference. Live stream
the rundown of papers to be presented or
demoed, and then have available presenters
answer questions from a chat. Basically building
hype via marketing. The easiest way to do this
would be in small multiple sessions, like a
company demo day. The idea is you only get 5
minutes to present your work (so keep it high
level), and 5 minutes for Q/A (expect to explain
scope of work). The result will then be people
scheduling sessions with intent. If presenters
aren't able to make the conference for what
ever reason, they still got to put their work out
in to the wild. If the conference organizers
wants to have more new blood show their
work, use these pre-conference livestreams to
showcase grad student work from the same
lab/group. (again 5 minutes, but since the work
might be early / preliminary and they might not
have submitted in the actual conference: no
Q/A) --- Almost all the papers I've read of my
own accord (not because I was expected to)
caught my eye via youtube demo videos. I
suspect this is the main reason I've
disproportionately read SIGGraph papers. Just
because they do a sleek preview of the
conference papers by concatenating a bunch of
video demos. Gets me to search the authors up.

Every time. Also, now days a lot of these
conferences are showing up on Hacker news.
So multiple pre-conference livestreams would
garner more interest while nudging authors to
get their talks/demos/sessions ready early.
More casual interaction
No, but if you gather good suggestions please
make them public
Esp. for junior folks, it might be interesting to
have a chatroulette-style random meeting with
someone else attending the conference.
More is not better. Slack felt a bit overkill for
announcements and questions in threads in the
"official" channels. There didn't seem to be a
lot organic conversation in Slack. The /video
and Gather thing seemed a bit overlapping and,
being video+audio, very hard to be in both.
I think there were people organizing
spontaneous "coffee break" or "join me for a
drink" ... I did not join any but I think this could
be a nice way for people to interact
Using open standards. Slack is not open-source
and thus lacks a lot of inter-operability features.
Youtube is neither open-source not free and
provides a very poor platform to browse across
videos. These platforms are very poor
compared to, for instance, all the activity-pub
platforms (Peertube, Plemora, etc.). In the
future, please use open-source, free, and
federated platforms.
Some way that makes meeting new people
natural, maybe blocking out time for a virtual
social gathering or something like that.
It will be great to have a dedicated virtual space
for video chatting with mentors!
One idea I had was to have some sort of speeddating online for new students/researchers. I
found it a little intimidating to use the software
for social interaction given that I am a young
researcher who does not know many people. It
would be nice for social interactions to be
quickly formed in this way (preferably near the
beginning of the conference)
I would feel comfortable with fixed slots in time
in which mentors are available to chat. Similar
to AMA but not facilitated/organized.
There should be more organization in virtual
space. First, we need thematic video rooms (I
guess, they can be setup on Clowdr). E.g. rooms
attached to sessions and meant to be used to

discuss presentation from different sessions. So
like-minded people with close interests are
more likely to find each other. Also, thematic
rooms suggest more research-oriented
conversations than e.g. in Gather. Second, we
need carousel-like timed breakout rooms for
socializing especially getting to know new
people (as opposed to chatting about technical
stuff relating to the presentations; although this
is not banned, just the emphasis is different). I
participated in one in a series of such events on
Zoom during this PLDI. It worked much better
than Gather. But Zoom doesn't support
randomization natively. I heard PLMW used
more well-suited tool called Disco
(https://disco.programming.systems/) but I
haven't tried it. It'd be nice to have more time
to socialize in between sessions. 20 mins for a
break is not enough. A virtual conference
should be more time zone neutral. One idea:
create two streaming+Live Q&A sessions per
one actual conference session in two vastly
different time zones. Another idea: radically
smaller time span for streaming+Q&A per day,
aiming left-over time for socializing and sleep.

recommend a discussion system that is ongoing
even outside of the conference (the slack is a
good start).

I really liked the 1-on-1 meeting sessions that
ISMM did, where they assigned people
randomly for 1-on-1 meetings. I had a chance
to talk to a lot of people who I may not have
otherwise talked to. ISMM only matched up
students with mentors, but I think it would
have been interesting to talk to a few students
as well. I actually would love to see something
similar in a physical conference as well. The
only improvement would be to make it clear
that the assignments are random, because I
had a few people who thought I had specifically
picked them.
Yes: we should not have virtual conferences.
For the duration of COVID-19, we should switch
to a journal format and try to find online native
social interaction mechanisms (a SIGPLAN
forum or chat?) instead. The virtual conference
experience was horrible, and much worse than
simply blocking off time to read the papers. We
should never do it again.
Last year I met a bunch of people at (a) the
conference lunch, because you tend to end up
sitting with at least some random people; and
(b) at the pool hall night. Gather gives a little bit
of (a) but it's not the same -- someone
proposed setting up random discussion rooms
and I think that's a good idea. It would also be
good to have some kind of explicit social hour
like the pool hall night -- not sure what but
basically something fun people can do while
talking and mixing, that doesn't take that much
attention but enough to serve sometimes as a
starting point for conversation. Few computer
games are suitable, unfortunately. Also
whatever it is would want to be stuffed into
Gather and/or Clowdr, which makes it all a
pretty tall order... sorry I have no specific ideas.
These activities should be available not only
during the conference, but also circa one week
before and after the conference, making more
people from different timezone to meet and
have deeper communication. During the
conference, I am more preferred to participant

the conference sessions and have little time for
social.
Something like /gather for random 3, 4 people
chats, but with **text** chats.
Many students asked the same question.
Having combined sessions would be better. E.g.
a virtual round table (like gather), where a
mentor announces that (s)he would be
available.
CAV used to do pre-conference pairing of
students who are attending first time with
other students or mentors
It would be nice if there is someway to really
encourage everyone to use gather at the same
time. It's much easier to initiate an interaction
if there are a lot of people there.
Creating focused "virtual coffee" meeting to
meet people I didn't already know was super
useful.
I'd like to approach a mentor but I got too shy
for this :(
Better UIs, fewer registration hoops. For
instance, in order to get into the
https://gather.town/ space, you need to jump
through ~7 UIs: regmaster.com -> slackinvite ->
slack -> type magic `/gather` command -> get
gather.town link -> register there -> login there,
and those who forgot the register on
regmaster.com in advance (at least 2 people I
know) didn't manage to access it
As much as possible, have a _single_ modality
(as opposed to four: Slack, YouTube, Gather,
Clowdr). Make sure there are "locations" that
sort by interest/topic, and make it accessible
from researchr.
I think it is harder to rely on accidental
encounters. Therefore efforts to allow people
to discover others who share interests before
the conference would be advisable. Efforts to
match people based on predefined interests
would make a lot of sense. I also found it really
hard to interact with authors of papers
Have clearly scheduled socialization breaks;
probably half of the program time
Make the (initial) list of mentors available
before the conference
I was nervous about providing mentoring,
because I did not want to get inundated. Some
limit on this would have been good.
Still an open question.

Responses to “In what ways did PLDI 2020 fall short of a physical conference?”

It lacks some of the natural socialising
mechanisms, such as lunches and dinners, that
make even reticent attendees socialise. That
said, I think the organisers of physical
conferences often don't realise that there is a
long-tail of participants who don't actually
interact much during events.
social mingling
Informal interactions with other members of
the community proved nearly impossible.
No easy way to have serendipitous interactions
in the hallway. I just wasn't interested in
pushing an icon around on a screen like in a
video game so I didn't. I just didn't spend much
time at PLDI so I didn't get nearly as much out
of it as if I had travelled to London.
People not being in the same time zone. Many
"social" things in the late evening for Europe,
where the conference was expected to be
located.
More spontaneous social interaction, the ability
of people I know introducing me to other
people without me asking (the online setting
doesn't really allow for that), and the last big
one: ATTENTION. If I'm home, there are a
hundred other things to do. I cannot dedicate
all my attention to the conference and the
interactions therein.
I wish there was more interaction on Slack.
There could have been more informal spaces to
discuss talks via text and meet people rather
than the video chat options being the main
choice. I appreciated the PLMW channel for
this.
Generally speaking it is easier to talk to people
in a physical conference.
Social interactions were hard, especially for
outsiders (I haven't been active in the
community in ~8 years).
Virtual PLDI was much less immersive and much
more distracting.
Difficult to meet people that you didn't already
know.
Hallway interaction, dinners and social
activities.
Peoples times were out of sync, leading to less
incidental meetings and discussions.

I still prefer physical meetings for small groups.
Lack of meaningful interactions. You can't really
replicate going for a dinner or beer with a
group of people, or having lunch with random
people.
Social interactions, although it is admittedly a
genuinely hard problem.
- Harder to pay attention in the virtual setting. Fewer instances of serendipitously meeting
new people, in hallway interactions and at
meals, going out for drinks, etc. - Occasional
technology blips like video cutting out made
conversations a little less smooth when they
did happen. - I liked the AMA sessions, but
missed having more visionary, big-picture type
keynote talks. - Co-located events were not all
as well-organized as the main PLDI.
Social interactions
The physical conference provides a way to stay
on the periphery and still make new contacts.
Further, the multiple tracks of the physical
conference forced me to prioritize the talks I
wanted to see in person (this PLDI was intense
when I tried to go to all the talks, and I entered
brain-dead state a little earlier).
- Social interaction - Adjustment to local time
not getting to meet the attendees...
human interaction is best in person
It felt very hard to get involved. Being at home,
I had many things distracting me. In person, I
am committed to the conference. The fact that
it was free and I paid nothing for travel meant
that I had "no skin in the game".
Very hard to carve out time for the conference
when I am still sitting at home with other
obligations.
Many fewer random meetings with colleagues.
Exploring a new interesting locale and its food
and beverage scene with new friends is an
advantage of physical conferences that I don't
think would be replicable for virtual
conferences.
Gathering enough momentum to be able to
block hours of online PLDI time for attendees. It

is very hard to spend anywhere near the same
amount of time connected with fellow
participants when sitting or standing at a
computer desk anyway (or any connected
environment, really).
The social aspect fell short of course, but all
things considered it was a good first attempt.
It felt like there is a bunch of high-profile
people+cohorts that all know each others and
enjoy connecting with their buddies, and
newcomers/outsiders/introverts may have a
hard time finding a way in or feeling to belong
in the community/event. This is probably true
for physical conferences too, but online makes
it much more easy to lurk and to ignore who
you don't know (they are just absorbed by the
huge contact list and you end up searching for
who you know)
It’s hard to reserve time for a virtual event.
time zone
Lack of long conversations over dinners with
new and old colleagues. But this is quite
obvious. Virtual PLDI 2020 was mostly amazing!
Listening to talks on youtube is suboptimal.
Impromptu Interactions were limited. It was
difficult to meet senior folks. People were
primarily chatting with their cliques.
No outside-of-conference kind of interactions:
Dinner, running groups, etc
perhaps the small talk during breaks was the
major things I missed, otherwise, I believe it
worked even better than a physical conference!
I didn't get to talk to people physically.
See also other free-form text-fields...
Regarding the scheduling below. I want to
stress that a conference should similar to a
normal working day be limited to an 8h span
per day max, counting breaks, so actually
conference time more like 7h, as to help worklife balance. 8h work per day and then END. I
don't care whether that is at night or at day for
me, because I can just sleep at day and wake at
night, which would normally occur because of
travel jet lag anyway, online time should be
limited to 8h max. If someone would
hypothetically require you to work longer than
8h a day for a whole week that would be
unethical, and although we did not require this,

we should give the impression that we
encourage this through the way we structure
our meetings, allowing attendants to impose
this onto themselves. In addition to that, some
talks happen simultaneously like a normal
conference would make it obvious that not
every talk needs to be watched. Finally, inside
the 8h should an offline break time in the
middle, so one get / make something to eat
outside of the conference, stand up and walk
around, e.g., a time where no talk / AMA /
sponsor-event is happening and one can leave
the computer. Finally, we need official
designated times with no conflicting other
events, where people who want to talk to
someone, can stand next to their poster, such
that other people who want to talk to
someone, can look at the posters and talk to
those people that have a poster whose content
looks like something one might know
something about.
Watching recorded talk is too much of a strain
It's harder to have "hallway" discussions, the
discussion in Slack is slower but often harder to
keep up with due to much higher number of
participants.
Informal interactions with other people -online mechanisms seem a bit forced Ability to
dedicate time for the conference while working
from home Inconvenient times Uncomfortable
to attend a conference for an extended time in
front of a screen
None that I think of except maybe I did not get
the chance to meet the speakers.
Obviously interactions. Gather had a very small
crowd. Also, for me a big part of interactions at
conferences was about lunches/dinners, coffee
breaks, drinks. All of these were lost.
Colleagues and family did not understand that I
was at a conference and thus do not reduce the
expectations during this period. It makes it
difficult to have time to read the articles and
follow the talks. Social interaction and technical
discussions are also much more difficult.
Accents are also much more difficult to
understand remotely than in person.
I found the virtual social interactions somewhat
frustrating, and definitely nowhere near what
I'd get at a normal PLDI.

1) Tools for live interactions were not mature
and because of my lack of experience with such
virtual events, I wasn't able to make an optimal
use of it. I expect my experience would improve
over a time. 2) Timezones. 3) Screen time. This
was a big major problem for me. On a physical
conference, one can walk a bit between talks,
grab a coffee or a tea and meet people when
doing this. On a virtual conference, one has to
stay in front of a computer to be able to
interact with others. I found this exhausting in a
longer term. And it is even more noticeable for
lunch breaks. 4) The lack of social events. Social
events (dinners, tours over a conference place)
are good opportunities to meet people and
again, it can be quite exhausting to have these
conversations in front of a computer. 5) I
believe that a virtual communication will
always be (more or less) inferior to a physical
one. One the other side, no communication is
inferior to a virtual communication and a virtual
conference makes it possible for more people
to communicate. And of course being in a bad
timezone amplifies 3), 4), and 5). In my
opinion, many of this can be solved and a
virtual conference experience can be close to a
physical conference (or even better) in many
aspects. On the other side, I don't think it can
match for a physical conference in all the
aspects so I think that alternating a physical and
a virtual format is the best solution.
I did not get to meet people. The prerecorded
presentations of the main program were not
engaging. (But often I also have a hard time
following talks at physical conferences.)
I miss seeing people in person. And I miss being
forced to leave my home environment, with all
its distractions.
Near-zero social interactions. Near-zero
synchronization with others. Maybe it's just me,
but I had a very limited attention span for
papers. Once I got the idea, I knew that I could
watch the talk whenever, so I just tuned out. In
the end, I felt that compared to a physical
conference: - I learned much less about what
everyone else is doing. - I met near-zero new
people - I left the conference with no extra
inspiration (whereas beginning-of-summer
conferences are usually a big source of
inspiration for me) - I learned nearly nothing
on the technical front. - I didn't meet "my

tribe", reconnect with old friends, or otherwise
enjoy myself.
I was not able to adjust my working hours to
that of the conference time zone, which I
expected to be the timezone of England.
spontaneity of social interactions
I did not have my full time allocated to PLDI, so
did not interact as much as I would have
otherwise. Also, my attention span was divided
between PLDI and other activities. But without
virtual PLDI I would not have seem any of it.
I didn't meet as many people as I would have:
the schedule for each day was very long, and I
had a lot of screen fatigue and didn't have the
energy after the sessions to spend more time
on gather/clowdr. If it's anyway virtual, I think
the sessions could be spread out over more
days, and grouped around fields. Then on days
when I'm not interested in the talks I can make
more use of the interactions. Lastly, I have to
say I did miss the fun of evening social events
(dinners/drinks) that would have happened in a
physical conference. :)
Felt difficult to meet people
The immediacy of "being there" vs. just another
thing I can tune in.
It manly lacked informal discussions that we
were possible in person.
It was still a bit difficult to interact with people.
There is no question about it. It was my first
PLDI and I also got to present my 1st paper. If it
was physical, my advisor would introduce me to
a bunch of people there that they already
know. But that was not easy in a virtual setting.
hard to meet new people! hard to focus on
talks!
I think there is no way to replicate the social
experience of an in-person conference online.
PLDI 2020 came closer than I expected, but it is
just not possible. Moving conferences to be
fully virtual would be taking away one of the
key benefits to younger students and replacing
it with something strongly inferior. Maybe once
we have perfect virtual reality, but until then, it
only makes sense during a pandemic.
Not forcing me to relocate away from my
normal duties meant that I did not care out the
time to actually attend the sessions.

I wasn't able to meet new people/renew
connections with acquaintances as strongly as
in person.
Coming on the heels of a difficult spring,
spending many more hours on Youtube is hard.
Because I was physically in my home during the
conference, it was difficult to shut off all the
usual "at-home" interruptions. I like being
away from home for a conference because I can
devote 100% of my attention to the
conference. I could never devote sufficient
concentration to the talks or to the
socialization.
Honestly, I think the committee did an excellent
job making this virtual conference happen and I
applaud them for it. I still miss some things
about the physical conference --- I still would
have had more conversations with people /
hangout with people more if the conference
were physical (just because I still feel more
comfortable chatting with people in person
than over video, especially with people that I
am not familiar with). However, I also see
benefits in having virtual conferences (lower
carbon footprint, lower cost, and the recording
may allow wider audience to the recorded
sessions).
The 12 hours were more biases towards US
attendance. It would be good to be more
inclusive of all timezones. This can be done by
having 3 different regions where papers get
presented during the normal time in those
timezones. There have also been suggestions
of having a second Q&A session at a different
time so that other people can ask questions.
I only tuned in for a few hours. Had I attended
the conference, I would have spent more time.
See this Tweet
(https://twitter.com/hgoldstein95/status/1274
355407138557952?s=20) and the related
threads. On a high level, I think virtual
conferences make it harder for junior
researchers to form their network/community.
They are also *much* less fun, which while I
think counts for something. In general, I think
doing away with physical conferences would do
a huge disservice to anyone who doesn't
already have an established network in our
community.
Same timezone.

lack of attention listening alone at home. Lack
of communication with other people.
Lack of physical presence led to zero random
interactions. Hallway track was nonexistent
It's not the same thing. We should have
optimized further for a virtual medium, e.g.
more time for questions, more use of slack.
Unclear social components, especially for folks
who are visiting this community. Inability to
see someplace new - different pixels on a
monitor do not constitute someplace new.
Also, virtual is a pathetic reward for students
who worked hard on papers, etc.
Hard to interact with other attendees in
different time zones.
Hard to attend all talks due to timezone
differences, little less possibility for "hallway
meetings" (but gather & slack helped A LOT!),
but I think this can be 'learned' over time!
I felt that I missed out on the social factor. I
think the conference were probably split
between too many medias.
Talking to other attendees. But I think
something as simple as forming groups with
different backgrounds to rate how crossfunctional a talk was would remedy the
situation. (i.e. you would have to discuss and
explain how things are in your field for the
others to understand)
Casual interaction and easy signposting
Nothing, except the lack of pressure for
introverts to get out of their comfort zone and
interact socially.
- I missed socializing, though /gather helped. - I
missed, more, chatting about research ideas
with experts in an uninterruptible fashion. Not
comfortable enough yet to do that; don't know
the virtual social cues. - Hard to get focused on
the event, when not away from my normal
situation.
Not everyone is forced to be in the conference
space / gather. So the number of people you
accidentally bump into is a smaller fraction of
the people who would be attending the talks
and other events. Also not much of a chance to
hang out with conference attendees for social
events outside of the conference.
1) It was hard to pay the conference much
attention. It just becomes another part of the
continuous data stream of Slack, Twitter,

YouTube etc 2) It is pretty much impossible for
young researchers who do not already have a
network to make new connections in this
setting. I don’t feel I’m part of a community of
researchers if I’m passively hanging out in a
Slack channel and occasionally watch a
YouTube video.
Networking ("hallway track", and evening social
activities). It was also more difficult to
disengage with local activities, since attending
PLDI didn't really take me away from my dayto-day job.
No chance for social interaction with the
authors/speakers you do not know right after
the talks.
The social aspect did not work at all for me. This
may well be my own fault. I was very much less
fully engaged than I would have been at a real
conference. It is very easy to just do stuff on
the side and forget about the conference.
Time zone. I completely skip the last sessions
Time zone. I wonder who thought that using
Pacific Time would be a good idea for London. I
only see that as another attempt to centralise
Computer Science around the USA, despite all
the criticisms that has been expressed in the
previous years against this centralisation.
It was hard to meet people "by chance".
Randomly (or not) running into people; being in
the same timezone as the conference (many
events were inaccessible due to their hour);
being able to fully focus on the conference
Only thing that was really missing was city
exploration and getting meals with friends. I did
not find online PLDI to be bad in any other way
to be honest. Organizers did a fantastic job of
making it excellent.
Physical interaction; time zone issue; Hard to
fully concentrate due to your regular day.
It was challenging to meet people. I had only a
couple of exchanges of messages, whereas at a
physical conference I probably interact with 40
people over the three days.
It's hard to match the impact of a physical
presence on the environment.
1) Social interactions were really lacking as
compared to a physical conference, especially
for myself as a younger researcher. 2) It was

harder to devote time purely to the conference
given the distractions of home.
Screens being involved made participating for
an extended period of time tiresome
No means to escape any ongoing obligations.
Between children, research, meetings and
teaching there was very little time for the
conference. Social participation was nearly
impossible.
It fun, just technical stuff around interactions
have to be polished.
- difficult to travel - difficult to waste the time
for travel - difficult to approach people with
flexibility
Absence of the workshops
absence of the workshops
A physical conference forces you to make being
at the conference your primary activity. With a
virtual conference it was too easy to let the
conference become secondary to all the normal
demands/meetings of my "real job" and just
watch the 15 or so talks that I was interested in
seeing and interact with a few close friends.
Social interaction (going for dinner, having
drinks, etc.) Experience giving a live
presentation. Distraction when listening to
video talks.
face to face meeting
In every way. Virtual is okay for established
people who already know each other. My
students attended virtually (all of them, since it
was free) and they were totally disoriented and
they said they didn't meet anyone new. I didn't
talk to anyone that I didn't know already either.
I was exhausted with the number of talks I was
interested in watching. Plus given it was virtual,
I couldn't really take time off work so it was
intermingled throughout the days. It was easier
in the physical conference to just join a group
going for dinner for example. It takes more
initiative to join a social group in the virtual
space.
There's an inherent tradeoff between it being
easier and cheaper to attend, vs. having the
discipline to fully commit to the conference for
3+ days.
I was still in my apartment with distractions
around and thus participated less than I would

have otherwise. But I can imagine on another
occasion isolating myself better.
I think it would have been easier to network at
a physical conference
It was very hard to initiate actual stimulating
conversations on various ideas. Even on gather,
the few times something started one would
quickly get interrupted. It is really hard to be
motivated to watch a video talk.
It was too overwhelming and too many people
online virtually for me to make meaningful
interactions with people

what was going on when and how I get there.
The Slack pinned messages and announcement
channel did not compensate for this.
Unfortunately, attending PLDI 2020 felt more
like having an additional social network for a
week than attending a conference with a clear
timetable and events happening.
It is difficult to work and follow the conference
at the same time
Timezone differences. Some of the sessions
happen in weird time for some people

social interaction, catching up with friends

Less interaction with colleagues. Harder to find
time to attend talks (particularly due to
timezone differences). No change of scenery.
I got into fewer random hallway conversations
(but at least some).
Social interactions, and too much screen time
per day.
social interaction as well as the primary
attendance interface: I spend nearly 15 minutes
switching between Slack and the website just to
find the youtube link. And I'm not the only one I
knew to have this problem.
Even though the organizers did a fantastic job,
it is pretty difficult having many social
interactions in a virtual conference since it is
very easy for people to just tune out right after
the talks.
Personal interactions are too weak, and I can't
focus my attention during talks
For me the main issue was the timing, as having
children meant that the majority of the evening
sessions were not ideal and alternate
arrangements were not available.
Social interaction and my full availability to
concentrate on this while being at home.
Social interaction, face-to-face, for obvious
reasons.

The social aspect is much worse comparing to a
physical conference.
Feeding question to authors through a
moderated Slack channel worked remarkably
well under the circumstances. The one thing
missing, I think, compared to a questioner
standing at a microphone was the inability for a
questioner to ask an immediate follow-up
question. So some interactivity was lost.
People did not walk up and sit next to me. This
is how I normally interact at conferences.
People would quickly enter Gather then leave--I
certainly did. I would look at the list of people
to see if there was anyone I wanted to talk to,
then leave if none were there.
Social interaction
Unfortunately, I was very much disappointed by
my experience attending virtual PLDI 2020. I
found Slack a completely inadequate platform
for running the entire conference. Focusing on
Slack resulted in a lack of clear information
about the timetable (what is happening now,
next?) and where to find the video streams for
the talks. The entire experience felt very
unstructured. The PLDI website which had a
much better way to show the time table was
completely unused - e.g. there were no links to
where to see the streams on the website. I
found the Slack interface for threads is terrible
to use. The mixture between some threaded
and some unthreaded conversations just adds
to the confusion. That Slack allows to write the
/video and /gather commands in any channel
and they appear as messages that only you can
see is a terrible confusing interface. Overall I
was missing a webpage that clearly explained

Talking to people

Gather is not well advertised
Harder to interact with other people.
Not traveling did mean a time zone difference,
but being able to rewatch the past YouTube
streams helped to mitigate that.
Social interaction, keynotes

I interacted with way fewer people
meaningfully and only met a single new person
that I didn't know before.
In my limited experience of attending physical
conferences, interactions with other research
groups at large specially at dinners is something
that virtual conference cannot replicate.
Difficult to reconcile time zone of talks with my
own time zone
Gather < Hallway
Random interactions, sequestration -- A virtual
conference overlaps the rest of my life, and has
to compete with everything else. When I
attend a physical conference in person, I'm
committed.
I think the main reason why I had difficulty
socialising was that all the socialising happened
when I was asleep due to time zones. Also, like
every conference I have attended so far, I was
surprised at the low quality of the talks.
the "hallway track"; part of which is
"synchronized breaks" and bumping into
people, but I'm *very* optimistic this can be
improved in future iterations.
Interaction, inspiration, discipline to attend
most of the talks, research-inspired
international travelling
Meeting people
Social interaction (but if many more people had
used Gather or similar, would have been closer)
Interaction
To meet people in person and talk about your
work to make a real connection. It’s not the
same in a virtual chat, they serve different
purposes in my opinion. So I’ll have the
conference physically and keep the virtual chat
going.
No comments
I think it was harder to informally interact.
I did not have chats with other participants.
This tends to happen naturally by 'bumping'
into other people. This may be because I felt an
inhibition to use gather/clowdr, whereas it is
hard to not meet people at a physical
conference.
Face to face interaction and socializing,
opportunity to travel

I refuse to run proprietary software on my
machine, so I could not participate in
discussions (because of the use of Slack)
sometimes the social interaction can be good at
a physical conference
Social opportunities are poorer
It is much harder to have informal chats,
dinners with people, etc. My experience of
conferences is that they feature an awful lot of
peer-to-peer learning, as well as being
something of an "immersive research retreat"
for those travelling. PLDI online struggled with
both of those things.
Lack of engagement since it is virtual
being able to focus on the conference, on the
other hand, it is not my main community
People not being in the same timezone
fundamentally limits interaction opportunities
(which, honestly, are the main point of the
conference; i.e. talks are mostly conversationstarters, not the main attraction)
wifi sometimes not stable
The primary benefit of in-person meetings is
serendipity. That kind of fun, accidental
discovery usually happens in hallways and over
dinner. While I completely understand and
support the organizing committee's decision to
cancel the in-person meeting, I was very
disappointed that we had to go virtual.
hallway conversations, hard to justify schedule
changes at home or work for a virtual
conference
Not being in the same time zone as the event is
a disadvantage. Going out together for dinner
and drinks in another city was missing. By not
traveling and taking time off for the conference
it was hard to balance the normal work week
with attending the conference effectively.
physical appearance of a speaker was missing in
virtual conference
There is a strange difference between the
questions that are asked live, and those
answered on slack. The former feels more
satisfying, for some reason.
Spontaneous interactions with new people was
almost impossible
being at home is impossible to engage full time
with the conference

Not being fully emerged into the conference;
Fewer social interactions; Time zones limit who
you can realistically meet (which may have a
strong negative effect on research in the longterm)
Interaction with other participants is still not as
good as in physical conferences (partially due to
not everyone using gather/slack)
Serendipitous interaction with a broad swath of
the community.
The timezone difference made things very
difficult -- existing in 2 timezones 5 hours apart
at the same time just doesn't work that well.
A physical conference is a "festival" of the
discipline, so has relaxing moments and aspects
of leisure as well as work. Lack of physical
presence makes attending virtually -- like Zoom
meetings etc. -- inherently fatiguing, at least to
my brain
Somewhat lack of immediate interactions.
Don't know; this was my first conference.
Self explanatory
social interaction, and too many distractions
from home
Gather / Clowdr isn't as good as physical
walking around.
time zone was one issue with virtual PLDI
It was difficult to structure my own time
without the strong signals of "session is starting
now... now it's lunchtime... etc." And it was
MUCH more difficult to find people.
From my perspective it was better (timeconstrained industry person - I probably
wouldn't have come across/found the time to
read the papers, but the fact the conference
was happening at a specific time meant I took
the time to watch the 20 min presentations,
and this enabled me to quickly find the subset
of relevant papers) but I know I am not your
core audience!
No physical distance from normal day-to-day
work. No physical meetings with others (which
is very humanizing and cannot be replaced by
current technology). There is not much
opportunity to meet people who are normally
in very different timezones.
Social interaction. Poor fit with local time zone.

Social interaction
The largest problem was the time zone. I
couldn't attend half of the events that I wanted
to, because they were throughout my night.
And this cannot be avoided for people from
certain countries if they are attending from
their own time zones (though the OC should
perhaps consider changing the times a bit in
future virtual conferences based on analyzing
the stats about number of participants from
different countries).
As an introvert who hesitates in approaching
people, I did not take part in any person-toperson conversation. While in any physical
conference, being surrounded by people takes
away some of hesitation and I usually talk to
some people. But this is something I should
work on
Not at all
normally, I really enjoy chatting at poster
sessions and conference dinners/social events.
Other than that, attending talks via Zoom is
absolutely OK, and sometimes even better.
Participants are in different time zones.
It was too hard to separate being at conference
from normal life/work
I did not talk to anyone. I was not forced to do
that. I am very uncomfortable at normal
conferences and always need a week to recover
afterwards, but, because my institution spent
money on it, I do my best to make it count.
With purely virtual setting, I can hide behind
my screen and avoid talking to people. I can
also make excuses that I have to get work done
instead of participating. Not great for perhaps
"socially awkward" people like me.
Gather is cool but will never match actual
hallway meetings.
I find it hard to focus on a prerecorded talk,
unless it is very close to my area. Also You don't
get to travel
Social interactions.
I found interaction harder to get started. This
may be because it is new.
Of course, missing hallway chats is a pity.
everything is on in the middle of the night

Social events live. A community needs to share
real live, occasionally.
Despite the great efforts to virtualize the
hallway track to me it is not the same and did
introduce new hurdles to speak to people. Also
attending the conference from home did not
help in my discipline to really attend the
sessions.
"Coffee breaks" should be synchronised, so
more people would be on Gather at the same
time.
Lack of networking, but this was well
compensated by (1) the comfort of not having
to travel and (2) the slack channels, which
should imho remain active in perpetuity after
the conference in some form or another. I
really hope you will save the contents and make
it available to the community.
I felt I did not connect to as many people as
during a physical conference. The schedule was
also clearly arranged to accommodate
American / European time zones. In Australia it
was a struggle to attend the sessions live.
Not enough social interaction
No "chance" interactions. Significantly fewer
opportunities to interact with junior
researchers, PhDs.
Not much interaction with other people
It could not force people into the same time
zone, making social interactions between
groups of people from widely different time
zones much more difficult.
The Gather space did not fully fill the void of an
actual hallway that you can talk to people in. I
generally found that the gather space was
mostly empty (or filled with people with video
& audio disabled). I also missed not having a
dedicated time for posters: I spent a few hours
around my poster to see if anyone would come
over to look at it but only had 1 person visit it.
Almost no interaction with other participants
other than speakers. The conference has to
interleave with other obligations, which is
stressful. It is harder to concentrate on a video
talk than a live one.
Timezones
PLDI 2020 failed at the fundamental purpose of
a conference: it was super hard to find anyone
to talk to.

I think there is a risk that people do not pay so
much attention and work on their own projects
during a virtual conference, as they know that
everything will be recorded and they can watch
the talks when they have time. Physical
conferences don't offer this possibility, so they
require us to be more focused on the talks and
on social interactions during the conference.
In-person interaction, odd timing
Everything that needs engagement. The talks I
watched were quite good, but I watched a lot
fewer because of the missing "well, I'm already
here"-effect. The social aspect also fell very
short. Partly that's because of my time zone
(Central Europe), so I usually was in bed for any
virtual post-conference activities. Partly also
because I felt quite uncomfortable approaching
people on Slack - Gather might have worked
better, if it had been used more.
Lack of interactions, networking. The tools
made available were reasonable, but still not
ideal and anyway interacting on a computer is
rather annoying. We are also probably tired
after being confined to this way of interacting
for so many months.
Much harder to engage speakers after their
talks. The social tools are not (yet?) an
adequate substitute, even though they do have
certain pluses, and note that Friday was much
better than Wednesday which was also much
better than Monday, as more people figured
out how to use the tools and they started to
gain critical mass. Also it's much easier to
accidentally miss talks while in the hallway,
because there isn't the effect of everyone
getting up and going in. And then, unrelatedly,
I've found it's much harder to concentrate on
dull talks by livestream, even though I carry
most of the same distractions with me in
person. Not sure why this is. (And some talks
will inevitably be dull for some people, that part
can't be helped). Also I found the constant
alternation between talks and AMA draining -maybe the answer is to skip more of them but
that doesn't feel like the _right_ answer. I think
there should be more time periods that are just
breaks or specifically tagged for socializing -there were a few but not enough. Even
inserting five minutes at a time here and there

to get up and make coffee and hit the restroom
would be useful.
I think it's pretty cool actually! I wasn't as
focused as in a physical conference though,
because if I attended a physical conference,
somehow I am "forced" to attend talks or talk
to people but if it's virtual, I may alternatively
choose to work on stuff or do something else.
This may be due to the fact I personally prefer
things that are more live -- since PLDI 2020 only
offers recorded talks, I found that less
attractive (but I enjoyed live QA, PLMW, and
AMA very much!!)
It is not very friendly for people from some
timezones (e.g. in UTC+8, we have to stay up
very late if we want to participate the
afternoon sessions)
ability to socialize with friends. But may be we
should have other venues (such as workshops)
for this.
For me it was better than the physical
experience. Getting acclimatized to the
atmosphere and food habits of a different
country takes some effort for me.
I know the organizer tries really hard to
improve this, but the virtual PLDI still lacks the
atmosphere of social interaction. And since we
are all at home, it is somewhat difficult to focus
on listening to talks and sometimes distracted
from other business.
some of the talks are not clear, perhaps the
authors should upload better videos.
Social interaction, inherent "push" to engage
with talks and ask questions
Fewer hallway track conversations and meeting
people I don't already know.
I was distracted by the rest of my life, since I
wasn't at the venue
fewer spontaneous interactions, inability to do
necessities such as walking, eating, waiting, etc
together with other attendees
In virtually every way
Very few accidental interactions. I can't get
drinks with my friends. It's very easy to skip
talks. I don't normally have my partner and
child with me. It's harder to beg off other work
obligations when you're not physically away.
Informal personal communication with
attendees during lunches, dinners, and coffee
breaks.

I think that the hallway chatting was much
worse. I think that pushing events into gather
or clowdr to force people to be present for
those kinds of events might have made people
stick around. e.g. people could have asked
questions for the ama in some area of gather,
then after the talks they would have already
been present there and likely continued
chatting. Maybe also having something like
voice chat rooms like on discord could be a way
to improve this
Time zone. I had to sleep when most the
conference was going on. I find it strange that
the conference was tied to a that specific time
zone, when events could have been staggered
throughout the 24 cycle. Accidental encounters
were gone. I also found it very hard to discover
work outside of my immediate interests
Social /gather and /video is not the same as in
a physical conference
no convenient excuse of eating for socialization
Socialization
The social interaction was really lacking.
Social interaction
Social and networking
I would prefer live talks to pre-recorded talks
(although I understand that the latter are safer)
Not everyone was in the same timezone. Also,
it would have been better if there was a video
conference with chat setup for people who
wanted to continue talking about the last paper
being presented.
Hallway track leaves much to be desiredspontaneous meetings are nearly impossible.
Dinner/tourism is a big part of PLDI that can't
be replicated
In physical conference, you are more like to
interact with people.
I think part of the value of a physical
conference is blocking out time to attend an
event; it's hard to do that virtually.
social aspect
Social interactions
There was a lot of content at the conference
itself, and as I had to actively initiate social
interaction (e.g. by actively deciding to go to

Gather or a video room), I ended up forgetting
that in favor of following the presentations.

Responses to “In what ways did PLDI 2020 exceed your expectations?”

I think combining a core of proven technology
(Youtube, Slack, and to some extent Zoom) with
younger experimental services like gather and
clowdr was bold and effective - certainly much
better than another virtual conference I
attended. The organisers clearly put a lot of
work and passion into pulling off the
conference in difficult circumstances which I
think was key to making it work this well.
own-timed viewing of talks
The Q&As are more accessible. The perpresentation offline discussions continued
easily without time limit.
The Zoom coffee hour, mentoring channel, and
AMAs really exceeded my expectations. The
most significant value of attending PLDI seemed
to be the encouraged interaction with other
researchers in the community, since the
majority of papers and talks now are published
after the conference anyway (not to say these
aren't valuable, but the social interaction is
hard to obtain any other way), and all three of
these provided a fantastic and welcoming
platform to meet and learn from both other
students and senior members of the
community.
The paper presentations were very polished,
and the Q&A format worked well. The AMA
sessions were also quite nice.
Mentoring worked extremely well - keep doing
that!
It was extremely well-organized!
I think the team did very well putting things
online on short notice.
I got more chances to talk to professors and
other senior researchers. In a physical
conference, students usually spend most of
their social time with other students. The AKA
sessions are great.
The slack channels for questions were far better
than my experience of live conference
questions. Also, the control over my schedule
for watching videos was really nice. I think

gather was really promising, just not quite
there yet.
Very accessible. Nice with the slack channels for
questions. Easy to just take part in the pieces I
was interested in, without having to spend a lot
of time travelling. Great to be able to listen to
talks at higher speed to get an overview, and to
skip things I was not so interested in.
Loved the AMA sessions!
The talks are extremely clear. Asking a question
is now very easy as well as following it up in the
slack thread is very very helpful/productive.
The talks generally went very smoothly. It was
very easy to attend the sessions or catch up
when one was late. Both session questions and
Q&A's worked really well.
The possibility of re-attending talks allowed me
to attend most of the seminars I was interested
in. I also hope they will be kept online in the
future, so it will be possible to re-watch them.
I enjoyed the Zoom meetings run by Rachit.
I liked the fact that when I felt like it, I could
have tuned in and watched a talk from my
couch.
Interaction with the authors,
academic/professional interaction, *excellent*
organizationally-wise (thanks to the efforts of
organizers and student volunteers it was really
easy to find out "what's going on right now",
including active sessions, Q&As, events).
- The Slack seemed more bubbling and engaged
than the virtual ASPLOS Slack. - AMA sessions
were great and super interesting to watch as a
junior researcher. - Moderated Q & A seemed
to improve question quality, fewer "it's more of
a comment than a question" type responses. Mostly single-track made it easier to watch all
the talks I wanted to see live. - Video abstracts
were awesome, great to be able to get highlevel overviews of lots of talks before seeing
the whole thing.
The Slack worked really well. I like that you can
go back and look at questions that people

asked. I think it works better to ask questions in
text than orally.
It was also really nice not to have to decide
which talks to have to miss, it was *amazing* to
be able to catch up on talks I had missed due to
outside issues, and I loved being able to catch
up on a talk on slightly faster speed when I was
having difficulty following the normal speed of
the talk. I also adored being able to scan
backwards immediately when I missed a key
point and then to catch up again to the live
version on 2x speed.
Slack interaction was easier and more social
than expected
- High exposure to many listeners for my paper
- I expected things to not work well, but
everything was very well organized. Chapeau
(hats off) to the organizers...
In all. This was my best virtual conference
experience so far.
AMA sessions were very good.
people making the effort to proceed as if it
were in person
The papers presented were incredibly complex
and advanced.
Fantastic Q&A on talks, really liked talking to
students who approached me via #mentoring
Probably better attendance than a physical
conference, and probably slightly more
polished talks. Talk Q/A also worked well,
maybe better than a physical conference, since
overflow questions could easily be answered
electronically. Easier to attend the subset of
talks I'm really interested in.
In pretty much every way. I was very leery of
how talks, questions, and social interaction
would work and I think they were all stellar.
Quickly moving to a virtual format has surely
been not easy, and the outcome could have
been really unsatisfactory. It was, instead,
excellent! The organizers did a majestic job, and
I want to thank them all.
Truly amazing effort, I did not expect the means
for interaction would be so effective and
diverse.
Recorded talks were of higher quality in my
opinion. Having the high-quality recordings
available later is a big win as well. I think livestreaming them was effective as well.

Resources were immediately open and free to
use. Streams were on Youtube which allowed
easy and convenient rewind, watching anything
you missed, or speed up. Volunteers/organizers
coordinated everything well and were well
prepared.
I thought the organisers really did everything in
their power and beyond to make it work and
try new things. Really impressive dedication.
There were lots of people interacting.
The availability for casual talks and gathering
I was surprised by how intense the whole week
was and by the number of interactions I was
able to have.
Discussions happening in Slack were
interesting, but didn’t distract from speakers’
response to questions. It was fantastic to see
speakers following up on Slack, and to see all
questions asked even if there wasn’t time to
answer them. ISMM running repeat sessions
was exceptionally useful, since I could pick a
schedule that worked for me. LCTES chose to
simply provide pre-recorded talks on YouTube,
which is fantastically convenient for viewing on
my own time.
The various media to make interaction better
was just excellent.
I think the sessions ran smoothly. Asking
questions on slack was easy.
I think that the pre-recorded paper
presentations were of higher quality, since the
presenters were able to edit, etc.
in every possible way to be honest! you folks
did an amazing job!
The opportunities to reach out to senior
professors/scientists.
It was super cool to be able to attend ask
questions over slack and slido and have them
answered, while not having to travel anywhere,
less effort, less cost, less carbon footprint, etc.
Also the Q/A were very smooth with selecting
written questions. The ability to look at
recordings within a 4h time-shift when you are
fed up with viewing something and want a
break, and to view stuff in double speed to
catch up. Clowdr and gather were nice
experiments and I like experiments. The one
person that I tried speaking with on gather was
ok. Seeing the lively feedback on #lessons-

learned. Seeing the business-meeting to figure
out what PLDI actually is, and where it will be
moving. All very good.
I got a chance to listen to all the talks if so I
wish - I no longer have to choose between 2
parallel talks I like AMA sessions a lot
The lineup of speakers and events was above
any prize!
The one-on-one meetups were great.
Variety of communication channels AMA
sessions Mentoring talks
The organization of events were good
presentations and Q&A sessions were strong,
personally I preferred this style of presentation
to being crammed into a room.
I was impressed by the effort put by the
organizers. Gather was working better than
expected even if I was not able to meet people
that I have hopping to interact with.
- The ability to watch a presentation without
distractions, rewind, pause, go back. Significantly lower barrier to
questions/responses. I could just put the
question on the slack channel.
The technical tracks went very smoothly, and I
liked that the tracks were at non-overlapping
times and that I could catch up on the
livestream if I missed talks due to scheduling
etc.
I wouldn't be able to attend PLDI if it wouldn't
be virtual and there were many advantages of
attending it virtually compared to only be able
to read proceedings or watch recorded talks. In
particular: 1) I found great to be able to ask
questions during the talks virtually. From my
experience, QA for talks were better than in the
case of a physical conference. No problems
with people speaking not loud enough, easier
to ask questions for introvert people, possible
to ask and answer questions before (in
particular in the case of pre-recorded talks) /
after the QA session. It is a bit shame that Slack
QA are not accessible persistently. 2) It was
great that all the talks were recorded and thus
accessible for everyone (this is already the case
for many physical conferences though). 3) It is
great to have an opportunity to interact with
people (gather). I think that there is a big room
for improvement both in terms of tooling and

people learning how to deal with online
interactions. 4) It makes the conference
accessible to much more people (including
people with a handicap of some sort). 5)
Eliminating travel makes the conference much
more environment friendly. Indeed, large
physical conferences as a way to spreading a
knowledge and enabling (non-obvious)
collaborations are probably not sustainable. I
think that 1) and 2) should be integrated to
physical conferences. Since from my
perspective, the biggest point of physical
conferences is to have non-virtual contact with
people, I don't think that trying to integrate 3)
to physical conferences is a good idea.
Extremely well organized. I felt a bit confused
at first but it surpassed my expectations
The AMA sessions were great. My tutorial had
a much larger audience (by far) than I would
have expected in the physical conference,
reaching many people who would not have
attended otherwise. The live interaction on
Zoom and Slack was excellent.
It's fantastic that it was free to register! It made
it viable to attend only a fraction of it, which is
not normally tenable.
The organizers did an amazing job to make this
feel like a real conference. I think the
shortcomings may be inherent to the format. I
also liked the Q&A for papers. Slack was a good
medium for that. And certainly I liked the
convenience of not having to leave my
home/office, tuning in whenever I wanted
without disrupting my work flow, being able to
watch asynchronously. And one can't beat the
cost. I found there were several ways in which
a virtual conference is superior to a physical
one: - 1.25x speed for talk playback. Handy. Time-shifting talks, pausing them. - Being able
to let sessions run longer. E.g., AMAs. - Slack
for questions, so that many more can be
answered. (Though I would *not* mix physical
questions with slack, though--the slack channel
should be strictly for asynchronous questions if
there is a real, physical questions track.) - No
multi-track conflicts of interesting talks.
Free online attendance was great, and I
managed to join a couple of the talks that I
found interesting (in the early hours)
Live streaming out to YouTube live was an
excellent feature, since they were recorded.

This allowed me to get on with my day job,
occasionally stepping away from PLDI talks, to
watch them in the evening at my leisure. I did
this for many talks. In that sense, I probably
watched *more* talks than if I had been at PLDI
physically, since urgent work matters
sometimes gets in the way of focus and
attention at conferences.
Ease of asking questions
Very easy to make connections and chat with
people!
It was easy to see other people's reactions to
presentation and then look at them at a later
time.
The asynchronous question mechanism was
amazing, I got a lot more discussion on my
paper than in many regular conferences. It was
also great to be able to rewind/pause the talks
on youtube, and even to cook dinner while
watching talks, etc. The slack workspace was
very active, and the ask-me-anything sessions
were particularly valuable.
the format for presenting papers (recorded
video with q&a afterwards) was great.
Having youtube streams made it very easy to
watch presentations in my own time, and to
share interesting talks with colleagues.
It was available to without any cost and we
could attend/watch the videos even after we
couldn't attend them in real-time (due to time
zone differences).
It was still very well organized. Also it was
awesome that a lot more people got to watch
the presentations since it was free and on
Youtube.
i like how we immediately have access to talks
via recordings, this gives much flexibility when
it comes to finding talks one wants to attend
It was free and easy to attend a little bit while
working on other things. That was nice. I'd
prefer all future conferences to have just as
strong of an in-person component, but also
offer a free virtual component for the sake of
affordability for people with less funding and to
respect the time constraints of people with
conflicting deadlines or with children.
There seemed to be a lot of people engaged!
The organizers were enthusiastic and did a
great job given the circumstances.

Many speakers were extremely inventive in
taking advantage of the opportunity to prerecord their talks. Examples: the Armada talk,
with its costume changes, and the French guy
who put the transcript of his talk in a sidebar,
thus avoiding pronunciation difficulties. Also, I
was able to rewind to repeat something I
missed, or time-shift the talks, etc.
The sessions were well organized. I do like the
concept of gather even though I didn't utilize it
much. I also like the fact that things were
recorded, and I can watch them later if I
happen to miss them in real time.
Having access to all recordings of presentations,
to be able to replay them as didn't get to watch
many live (due to timezone issues). The Slack
channel for questions worked really well, I got
to interact with people just as if at the
conference in person.
The "Ask Me Anything" sessions were a great
addition.
The talks were extremely high quality, which
seems to be related to their pre-recorded
nature. Also, the ability to tune in and out of
talks, pause them, speed them up, etc, was
quite a nice way to interact. Also, far more
researchers were able to attend this conference
than would have been able to attend physically,
which is a wonderful thing.
If it was not virtual this year, I would not haven
joined it. Since it is virtual and free, I was able
to join a tutorial about quantum computing I
liked! I do appreciate everything is recorded
and available online for free! That can be
recommended when physical conference is
possible too.
Free? I guess.
I like the fact I can see all the videos online,
rewind, ask questions later, etc! All of these
things should be retained for a hybrid physical
conference too.
Slack questions seemed to work very well. In
some ways, for our paper, it was even better
than the usual in-person Q&A. A lot more
work, but also more rewarding. Presentation
quality was generally pretty high.
Low effort participation. Accessibility to a wide
audience.
AMAs were really awesome, video streams
worked really well.

Readiness to answer all the questions even way
after the talk
The production value of the talks were much
better than previous years. I think this can be
attributed to the talks being prerecorded. I
think this would be a great idea in the future,
even if the conference stops being virtual.
Never had expectations, but The fact that I
stopped watching live streams only to return to
7 hour long uploaded videos should say
something. (I watched almost every
talk/session. Really loved the the probabilistic
programming portion. Good to see Neil
Toronto's work wasn't a "shot in the dark" )
Speakers so willing to discuss and answer
questions
I really liked the use of Slack for asking
questions and continuing the discussions after
the talks. I hope this stays, even for non-virtual
events.
- I like the Youtube stream coupled with Slack
questions (why not Sli.do?). Nice to be able to
rewind the stream, or pause, when you get
distracted. - I am glad for the single track over a
longer day; being able to watch talks whenever
helped deal with timezones/day-length. - AMA
sessions were great. - Slack-based
communication was more informative/useful
than I expected it to be.
Much more accessible. I wouldn't have been
able to attend this year if it was not virtual. The
YouTube streaming feature allowed me to
attend talks whenever I wanted. Chatting with
folks over slack was easy and I could find
whoever I wanted to just by name rather than
walk around a large building for hours.
The organisation was really good. I'm really
impressed by how the organising committee(s)
rose up to this challenge, despite really not
having signed up for a challenge of this scale.

No technical difficulties at all, the talks were
interesting and well presented (maybe even
more than in a physical conference)
Being able to attend "lightly" without
committing a full week+travel was nice
Very organized and strong presence on the
Slack, it was very easy to get information when
needed.
On YouTube live, I can catch up the sessions
though I missed them.
The Q&A over slack was incredible. Infact this
could be a feature worth keeping even if we go
back to physical conferences. The AMAs were
outstanding.
I happened to listen to more talks than I usually
would.
I was impressed by the number of people who
participated. If I had been better at using the
tools provided, I believe that there was a great
opportunity to interact with people who might
not otherwise have attended a physical
meeting. But I have to say that even for basic
things like getting to the correct YouTube
channel and thread of the Slack channel, it was
a bit confusing until Day 3 of PLDI.
love the youtube -can start late, variable speed,
and rewind if needed and end on time for the
live Q&A
Felt inclusive
1) The slack channel worked really well for
question-answer. 2) The AMA sessions were
great! 3) Many more people watched the
average research talk than I have seen at past
in-person conferences.
Unexpectedly smooth in operation.
Not in any way.

It was more engaging, especially Q&As than I'd
expect from a virtual event.
It was a good organization and mostly
It was organised very well
worldwide.
The AMA were fantastic. I think most of the
it was a good organization and mostly
papers got more questions (and thus more

The slack Q&A sessions were excellent. Far

The video talks were nice. Some researchers did conference. We should definitely try to
preserve this when we get back to mostly

physical conferences.
themselves.

Super easy to approach people. You don't have
to hunt down somebody in the hallway.
Speakers answered to the questions much
better than physical conferences. Even after the
talk ended, they answered with Slack.
I absolutely liked the AMA sessions.
it didn't

I was able to attend many session that I
couldn't have attend otherwise. It was great.
How smooth it went, and the preparation that
facilitated that
The AMA track was awesome & a good use of
virtual-ness
AME

If there was not time for an author to answer
all questions, the questions nevertheless had
been captured in the Slack channel, and in
some cases authors took the trouble to answer
such questions on the Slack channel a bit later.

The talks and Slack for questions worked quite
well. The gather was OK.
The ability to watch presentations at a slightly
later time or rewind sections was good
compared to a physical conference, but there
was still a lot of synchronous communication
that you don't get when just reading papers or
watching talks on YouTube. Good combination!
Videos with talks were often better than real
talks in rooms with small screens and/or bad
aqustics. Q&A in Slack were awesome -- plenty
of questions and detailed answers helped me
learn a lot. Social interactions were not as bad
as I expected. I wish I had more time to talk to
mentors and other attendees.
super accessible from anywhere on the earth.
Also the ability to rewind/replay the (live
stream) video instantly really helps
I felt many people open to discussion and
conversations in the slack channels.
I thought that there would be no social
interaction at all, but the organizers did a great
job with Gather and the mentoring sessions.
The organizers tried really hard to bring back
the hallway interactions
The Slack channel allowed unfettered access to
many well-known people in the community in a
way that allowed both parties to communicate
on their own terms and outwith physical
constraints that would at a physical conference.
The live streams and AMA were useful as well.
Virtual talks are much better than in person
talks. I think that asking for a prepared video
even for a normal event and letting only
questions during the meeting is better.

Talks seemed a little more polished.

Excellent people all around. Super nice talks.

It was _really_ nice to pause/play @ 2x speed
the talks.
Very few hiccups in streaming and the
scheduling of all events.
The mentoring channel and the AMA sessions
were both excellent ideas that should be kept!

during presentation, I can roll back a little bit to
the point that I missed
Very well organized! Much more interaction
over Slack (especially Q&A) than I expected.
Mentoring/job adverts channels were useful

That I was able to participate in conversation in
a more democratic manner in the medium of
chat on Slack and taking my own time to do it. I
find it much harder to interject if senior people
are talking and I don't have anything
worthwhile to add in the moment.
There was an actual community participating
and working hard to mimic the conference
experience. It really was impressive, far
exceeding most people's expectations! I think
some of that was from coronavirus -- many of
us wanted a conference and were eager to
contribute to making a virtual one succeed.
And the conference leadership was
stupendous.
The sessions worked very smoothly. It was easy
to follow the actual talks that had essentially
perfect video and audio (and even subtitles in
some cases!) It was much much less stressful
to have it virtually and much less time wasted
on things having nothing to do with science
(like getting visa, boarding airplane), let alone
all the cost and environmental benefits.
I really liked the Q/A on slack, the mentoring
sessions, and gather (even though it had
shortcomings).
1 on 1 mentoring sessions were actually better
this way
Watching talks online from home is nice.

and should be replicated for physical
conferences.
I enjoyed getting to see a lot of research and
presentations that I otherwise wouldn't have
been able to justify traveling for.
Slack questions, Ask Me Anything session
Gather was actually fun and entertaining, for
catching up with people you already know.
I honestly did not think I would be able to
attend so many parallel talks and still get a
reasonable gist of what's going on. Replaying
the talks to catch up on things was very helpful.
On a different note, the virtual 1-1 interactions
lessened my social anxiety of the researcher I
wanted to talk to. The mentoring sessions by
Alastair Donaldson and multiple other panelists
including the session chaired by Nadia were
very nicely planned and helped me find a new
direction in tackling research and pressure.
Ability to watch any talk I wanted to at my own
pace, albeit without interactivity
Ask Me Any Thing
Zoom, YouTube, and Slack interoperated better
than I expected. We'll get better at this with
time.
The Q&A during talks was amazing, students
found it easier to approach people, overall I
was much more EXCITED during this PLDI than I
have been at others in the past, probably
because I was not EXHAUSTED from travel,
could quickly pop out to hug my kids, could
rewind and fast forward talks that I'd missed,
could ping people on slack instead of running
about a stuffy hotel looking for them, the food
was better etc etc etc. In brief the elimination
of the substantial travel cost and the
organizers' METICULOUS attention to detail,
putting together such an exciting program has
made me EXTREMELY bullish about inevitable
virtual conference future.
Great online set up that we can go back to in
order to relearn although I'm not %100 sure we
will, let's hope the best!
Pre-recorded videos worked well
Large, diverse participation. Ask Me Anything
sessions.
Everything recorded and easily accessible.

Watch live videos on YouTube of the
presentations was a great idea! We should
always do that!!
I wish I could attend the physical conference
that'll be better for me to gather more
knowledge.
I was surprised by how clear to understand the
talks were — as an undergrad I thought it
would be opaque to me. I was surprised by how
friendly everyone seemed on slack :).
1:1 meetings, Ask Me Anything, Replaying so
that my time scheduling became pretty flexible
free, more inclusive
I felt the 'conference atmosphere'. I like that a
virtual conference is integrated more
seamlessly with other aspects of life (the other
duties of an academic, private life at home),
whereas a physical conference means a
'rupture' (for the better or worse).
Ease of interacting with authors via questions
on Slack
This was so much better than a physical
conference. I was able to attend my talks of
choice and use the remainder of my time for
other purposes. I didn't have to waste a whole
week in miserable airports, planes, hotels and
conference venues.
Quality of the AMAs
The slack channels for discussing papers were
excellent, encouraged more discussion in a
shared forum than often happens, and allowed
real time "what did that notation mean"
discussions. I felt much more empowered to
add a question to the slack channel --- which is
async, and unintrusive to people not interested
in --- than I ever would have in a normal
conference (and to my pleasant surprise, my
questions do not appear to have been a waste
of time for anyone.)
it went very smoothly and Slack was very
active!
The mentoring channel on Slack was amazing
(I'm a first year grad student); I'd strongly
encourage future conference organisers (even
for physical conferences) to adopt something
like that
great flexibility

Talks were better than usual, I think because
authors were given a way to control the final
product a little more precisely. In a way, this
was a big improvement over typical talks.
REMS/DeepSpec had great content
Because it was free and virtual, I was able to
attend without asking my advisor for funding
etc. The mentoring channel was a great
resource! I was able to have some unplanned
conversations on gather and clowdr which I did
not expect from a virtual conference.
AMA part is very interesting
Authors answer questions on slack, which is
easier than the time constraints in physical
meeting.
Having questions answered through Slack after
talks was nice
the AMAs sessions were fantastic! and Gather
is really fun
Gather at least partially mimicked the real
hallway track (module time zones and nb of
people who actually used it)
Gather/clowdr/slack far exceeded my
expectations in terms of interactions with other
researchers. PLDI was a far better experience
than other virtual conferences I attended.
I loved the AMA sessions
The talks were better than I anticipated. The
AMA sessions were universally awesome.
Mediated Q&A was more useful than
traditional in-person Q&A.
I was really impressed with the virtual
"physical" meeting space!
Integration between Slack, Gather, researchr,
YouTube and Clowdr was better than I
expected. The YouTube live streams did achieve
a greater sense of "presence" than I expected.
I can switch between sessions to listen to what I
was interested in.
talking to mentors and AMA sessions have been
very useful (I'm starting my PhD in CS soon, so I
got many useful tips and advice; was able to
talk to these professors whom otherwise, I
would not have a chance to talk to).
online access
there was great mood of mutual support.
quality of talks was superb. the discussions on
slack simultaneously to the talks, and the fact

that the questions were _written_ and thus
better thought out, made the talks much more
useful.
nice tutorials
Gather!!!
very well
Such a relief not to have to fly across the ocean!
And I did have several random / unexpected
interactions with people I had not met before.
Tools: Slack was great, Gather/CLOWDR show
potential -- I'm eager to see how they develop
in the coming months.
The youtube-streamed presentations were
great because of the features: a) rewind when
you missed what the speaker just said b) pause
to go make some coffee c) watch later
(timezone issues). The presentations on zoom
disappointingly lacked these features!
It was very well organised, with many creative
ideas for making the most of the conference
being online. I experienced no technical
problems at all in attending talks! There were
various opportunities to meet other attendees
during breaks. Attention to mentoring, AMAs,
and the channel for SIGPLAN CARES were very
nice. Despite the high influx of people (because
online, and free), the conference had a
pleasant, positive atmosphere.
Social interaction
I hadn't expected it to be so great in a virtual
manner to be honest. Kudos!
Much better organized that I expected from a
virtual conference
Watching talks from my office made it easier to
take notes, look up references.
Being virtual, allow me to take part in PLDI,
which is somewhat outside my main research
area.
I was happy I could attend great talks even
during these difficult times, so the PLDI
organizers did an excellent job
I liked the lack of parallel tracks.
AMA were fantastic, Q&A through slack are
much easier to follow than IRL (both as an
author answering and as someone asking), they
also let you ask/answer more questions if
you're interested.

It was very well organized and of high quality. It
helps to have material positioned in a way that
is easily visible and explorable. All the slack
channels, Ask Me Anything, and talks were very
well managed by the hosts. The conference
website was also very impressive, that made it
easy to follow.
Quality of the workshops I attended, talk Q&As,
AMAs.
Being able to go back to talks that I missed and
the questions on slack. Being able to catch up
on talk at 1.5x speed. Being able to find people
on slack to talk to. My own food, not crappy
hotel food. The AMAs were great. I could
watch talks from workshops that conflicted
with workshops I went to.
I can repeat the talks anytime I want and
discuss with the authors via slack anytime also.
These two points are very helpful for people
cannot afford to travel to PLDI.
Organization of session is perfect. Slack
channels and threads for questions worked like
a charm. Discussions remains in the chats and
questions get answered offline in a much more
solid way. This is even better than live
conference.
The number of participants (=reach) was
amazing.
Lost of opportunities to connect with people,
reduced communication barrier, very well
structured Q&A sessions.
The interaction (through slack, sli.do for plmw)
was very good. Questions on slack
The organisation was well prepared for the
virtual aspect. They picked decent tools for the
job and made sure that everything went great.
There also seemed to be a great group
mentality in the Slack workspace
The sessions and Q&A worked quite well.
Questions were nice and the talks too.
Overall, tech worked surprisingly well, without
major breakdowns or delays in the program,
that's awesome work by the organizers!
It has been organized really well. Everything
worked most of the time.
Things ran smoothly for the most part. I also
really liked being able to roll-back a livestream
and watch something I may have missed. I also
think that the Slack was good for getting more

interaction after research paper presentations:
I received more questions than last year and
had an easier chance to discuss them.
The 20-minute session per paper were great! It
was possible to understand the work well in
each talk, and thus there were good discussions
afterwards. The AMAs were also a bonus as
compared to a live conference.
Gather is really promising
The videos were online sooner, but in all other
ways it was worse.
The "Ask me anything" sessions were great.
Also the mentoring channel.
It was nice to be able to get in touch with paper
authors themselves even after they finished
Talk qualities, AMAs
I expected the social tools to be much worse
(particularly gather, which seemed totally
unpromising at first)... also you can't beat the
registration fee :-)
In a lot of ways! I didn't expect that it runs so
smoothly! I believe many people worked very
hard to make all this happen. I really
appreciated that. I think many people can feel
more free to answer questions than in a
physical conference. Another good thing is that
it may be easier to find certain people to talk
to, because in a physical conference, you need
to first find them but in a virtual conference, I
can always find them in the slack channel.
The slack platform is a good way for people to
interactive with the authors.
YES
Makes future interactions with fellow
researchers easier. Saved on travel effort. Talks
are available for viewing later.
The publicity of the work because there are a
large amount of people registered, and there
are a lot more questions on Slack compared to
a normal QA session so it is nice. Also, I really
like the "Ask me anything" session and it is
really inspiring.
I can talk to many people.
Surprisingly accessible, especially Gather. The
ability to watch talks in convenient times for my
time zone was great!
Better talks and answering questions. AMA was
the clear winner of the conference.

Quality of presenters, quality of audio/video

None

Everyone's so nice =)

The quality of the presentations.

not really, unfortunately, but I realized that
slack discussions for each paper *could* be
pretty good, they could go on for all three days,
and even result into spontaneously scheduled
small video calls, which would have exceeded
expectations and also what's possible in a
physical conference, but I think much less
happened there than what could have
happened, probably because only one "thread"
instead of one "channel" per paper was
available, and because it was declared as being
"only" for questions, and the threads were very
hard to find
It was extremely well run given the limitations
of it being virtual.
Strong organization on a short timeline. Talk
quality was higher than usual (thanks, prerecording!), as was Q&A.
All the talks were streaming and recorded. It
enables us to check some talks back
immediately as needed. It allows me to easily
catch up talks (even in the presence of
language barriers) and to have short breaks
safely even within a session.
I think that the workshops were better than
usual. The number of people that were
streaming the workshops significantly
increased. It is probably easier to get everyone
who is interested in a topic on a chat channel
rather than just those who managed to find
time to go to the conference. In other words, I
think that traditionally small events (<30 ppl)
should move online and large ones (>100) are
better in the real world

question-answers
Virtual worked better than I expected
Organizations went better than expected,
nothing major went wrong at all.
Already had high expectations that were met
I saw people interacting on /gather.
People interactions feel to have been enhanced
by the virtual nature of the conference. Easier
to talk to a "stranger" on slack or gather than
approaching them in person.
The AMA sessions were thoroughly enjoyable.
It was really nice not needing to travel and
being able to partake in what I wanted to.
The amount of interaction was better than I
expected- though still very lacking.
I really enjoyed the AMA.
Relative lack of tech issues for presentations
great interaction, everyone can know clearly
about others' questions after a talk
The infrastructure prepared was very well
explained and didn't seem to lack anything in
particular.
I think the entire virtual aspect was much
better handled than I expected. Granted, I
originally envisioned just zoom sessions and
slack when I heard the term "virtual
conference."
Well organized

Avoiding travel (even with an emissions-free
option)
getting required corporate approval

VISA issue: have difficulty returning back to U.S.

Probably, that I did not submit a paper? Also I
dislike traveling.

Insufficient interest

I don't enjoy being around other people

I didn't have a paper published at PLDI, so I
probably wouldn't bother to go.

In the end my physical attendance would have
depended on whether travel cost + conference
fee would have fit in my company’s Training

Too many overseas conferences, flying out of
Australia is expense and time consuming. I can
only limit attendance to a few conferences each

Getting management buy-in

I did not know about PLDI

I'd rather spend my company education credit
on a more practical (i.e. Pycon, Scala,

Continuing studies or Coursera classes. Goes a
lot further.
Not an author, so no grant money to cover
expenses.

Ridiculously low quality reviews that I saw at
PLDI this year
Conflict with some of my original travel plan

WAY Too much travel this year.
I am part-time student and hence getting the
necessary funding/permissions is always a
hassle. Further I would be treated as an
industrial participant blowing up the cost.
I would probably have agreed because I do
*love* London, but I would have hated all the
travel and cost and being away from my kids.

Topics not sufficiently relevant to my research
I’m an undergrad and wouldn’t have felt
qualified to go.
No paper and networking is only reason for
travel
No justification for reimbursement.

relevance
As an interested observer from industry, only a
small part of the conference was relevant to
me. The virtual setup made it easy to attend
the subset of interest. (My company would
have been much less happy if I wanted to take
the whole week to physically attend!)
As an industry programmer, I only make time
for one academic conference per year. This
year I would have attended ICFP or one of its
colocated events.
Not from PLDI research areas

A.8. Responses associated with “I prefer to self-describe” for the question “To
which gender identity do you most identify?”
I find this question offensive and I'm ashamed
of my research community to find it here. I am
male, that is my sex, and it would be great for
PLDI to record this legally protected
characteristics. Gender is not my identity:
gender is the collection of stereotypes and
biases imposed on people for their sex; gender
identity is its introjected self-imposition. People
should not be asked to identify into their
oppression. Please, listen to some of the groups
of women, and especially lesbians, campaigning
against the degrading impact of gender identity
theory. And, if you want to address
discrimination, ask about sex.

A.12. Suggestions for ways to mitigate the effects of time zones
Prerecorded videos but with live discussion
sessions led by session chairs and nominal
video watching times signalled in the schedule
to encourage watching the videos in advance
while allowing attendees to rearrange their
time.
I select the "one time zone" option, but I think
it's also reasonable for that zone to be
uninhabited: mid-atlantic or mid-pacific, for
example, give reasonable reachability from
(parts of) two continents.
Live activities, but more efforts spent on free
asynchronous communications. E.g. everyone
can create (public) channels and promote
online discussions there. If the discussion gain
attitude, attendees can create a room for video
chatting.
Have all slides available to review a day before.
Maybe a combination of focused and
asynchronous: the talks could be prerecorded
and the Q&A asynchronous, but the social
gatherings should be focused and not spread,
otherwise people would not have a clear idea
when is a good time to tune in.
It could be interesting to try to rotate the live
activities within a conference. E.g., picking

three nearby timezones to target, 10 hours on,
16-18 hours off, 10 hours on, etc.
Hybrid conferences will likely be the norm for
many years to come. Live presentations should
be partitioned into remote and physical ones
(e.g., alternating remote and physical sessions),
with all questions being channelled through a
Q&A channel. Moderators will decide which
questions get answered live, others may be
answered asynchronously. The Q&A channel
may include A/V recordings of questions.
Maybe experience will tell recorded material
may use a full 20-30mn slot, while live
presentations may be shorter.
I appreciate the paper presentation videos
being available after the conference.
Focus 8h, with parallel tracks, breaks, and
official online poster session, plus an official
offline break ("cook your dinner" or "family") in
the middle ;;;; Another alternative could be
8h per day, but instead of alternating yearly the
timezone, every second day could use the other
timezone.
Spread, but replicated at staggered hours other
than 12 hours (8 or 16); alternately, pre-commit
attendees for talks, giving their time zone,

which may reduce the overhead for talks with
lower time zone spread
I think that it is hard to say without trying it out.
Focussed seems to facilitate more live
interactions, on the other side, spreading the
even could make it less exhausting (screen time
problem) provided that one would manage to
not work during the pauses :)
make talks live with extended time for
discussions, perhaps repeat talks in multiple
time slots, do more in parallel
Haven't thought about this much. Don't want to
offer uneducated opinions.
Spread as it was, but improve experience for
asynchronous out-of-timezone watchers by
providing individual videos after the live
session, instead of having to search through
hours of livestream that happened while you
were sleeping to find the talks that you want to
catch up on.
Focussed, but each day based in a different
time zone
There is no good answer to this question, which
is why I don't think that a virtual conference is a
good idea.
Given that the presentations are taped, I don't
think replication is that important.
Present the paper talks at allocated times in
each timezone followed by questions. Then
have question time replicated in other
timezones. This would work well for papers
with authors in different timezones. So could
be an optional Q&A session.
Make the live portions short so that many time
zones can be accommodated. Videos provided
in advance.
Spread conferences over a longer period of
time, keeping talks and events within a time
frame that works reasonably well for everyone.
similar to the first option but the Q&A should
be scheduled in a time for real communication,
as well as asynchronous message Q&A.
More asynchronous communication
no live sessions for paper presentation is
actually needed unless one wants to verify the
author identity. Making prerecorded videos
available beforehand allows for better
questions. Live steaming of question answering
limits quality of the answers. Regarding nonpaper live activities like workshops or Q&A I

would say that Q&A can be split into two
streams 12h apart (but shortened twice) and
workshops can be focussed on one time zone
with resulting materials available at least until
the conference ends
Do a demo day live (5 minute presentation + 5
min Q/A). Then do the full sessions spread out
over 24 hours. The times should be set by a
survey after the live demo event. Basically only
what gets the most interest + Timezone
cohesion gets a replicate live full talk/session
(assuming presenter is up for it). Everything
else is uploaded as a video at the start/end of
the conference.
Separate chat rooms for each sessions, to be
able to very quickly find the interesting
discussion.
If the conference cannot be held physically,
then just cancel the whole thing and go back to
ACM journals.
stop having conferences and go full journal.
That really is the only option. Virtual
conference doesn't work at all.
This problem is no worse than with physical
conferences vis a vis jetlag. Rotation is good,
etc. but it's odd to think this problem is worse
for virtual conferences.
Let speakers indicate their preferred zones and
apply a scheduling algorithm. Make text
discussions more visible and longer lasting.
Parallel tracks spread over 12 hours. Each
paper has its own session that can go over in
case of many questions.
Make presentations available at the start, but
schedule live video Q&A sessions (two for each
presentation, 12h apart)
Spread the conference across more days, with
less screen time per day. Make regular videos
available a bit in advance, repeat Q&A twice.
Schedule multiple social interactions across 24
hours to accommodate more people. Make
things like AMA or keynotes run live times but
in different times, so that everybody could
watch something live, but maybe not all of it.
Recorded video released early, online Q&A
twice, 12 hours apart

focus on the time zones harboring the most
attendees

I think it will be difficult to predict which
options are good, without actually trying them
out.
ISMM's strategy worked well: record the talks;
repeat the live Q&A sessions.
Honestly I just want the US to be
inconvenienced for once.
All talks at beginning. Extended interactive Q/a
and tool demos if possible.
Make all recorded presentations available at
the beginning of the entire event. Schedule 2
live discussions (e.g. Q&A) for each
presentation, 12 hours apart (or something).
Good work!
I think that live activities should focus on AMAs,
mentoring, networking, .. but not pre-recorded
talks.
ISCA 2020 global hours for keynotes
But keep the slack conversion and video, and
chance for asking question virtually.
I don't understand what you mean with
"replicated", but the youtube recording
available after event is closed works quite well.
I was able to watch later all the events I lost
due to timezone issues.
It is good to space out as much as possible,
because most people cannot spend 8 hours
straight staring at a computer screen.
Virtual pre-recorded talk presentations in
virtual spaces on a repeating schedule, so that
people can gather, watch and discuss them.
Probably combined with async Q&A.
less than 8 hours per day
Having the presentations available up-front
would allow more flexibility in allowing people
to watch them. But I don't think the entire
conference should become fully async, some
events should be scheduled, spread between
timezones to allow people from multiple
timezones to participate (e.g. have an event
that is in the morning for US and afternoon for
EU, so people from both regions can interact
with each other).
I thought the schedule was perfect. I can
accept not being able to participate in

everything if I get a lot out of what I can
participate in. I appreciated the lack of parallel
tracks. Video conferences are stressful and
parallel tracks add to the stress.
Spreading things out makes conferences worse
at their most important purpose, which is
bringing people together to talk. We either
have to commit to being present at the same
time, or use asynchronous modes of
communication.
Maybe make the videos available at the
beginning, but make the Q&A sessions live (and
two each 12 hours apart)...? Also, in that
environment it might be interesting to set up
chat rooms to watch talks or groups of talks
with smaller groups of people and then maybe
discuss afterwards. Might make some talks
visibly more popular than others, which is
probably bad, but I think it would improve the
engagement with the talks, which is somewhat
difficult with prerecorded streams.
Some sort of replication so that everyone can
engage at some level
Uniform spread may not be the way to go.
Maybe allow authors to choose their slots?
There is a risk that the distribution of
author/attendee timezones differ...
async Q&A with authors via some actual forum
(not slack threads)
I know it should be up to the participants to
organise, but I think your lack of official events
meant there was a lack of unofficial events
outside US time. Having something outside of a
narrow timeslot would give participant
something to organise around
Have live QnA and live videos but also post
videos in advance
Use sli.do or some other app that enables
moderation and better sorts upvoted
questions. When doing the live Q&A twice,
alternate which 12 hour time frame goes first
and then use some of the most voted for
questions from the first time frame in the 2nd
Q&A instance.
make pre-recorded talks available all the time,
have live Q&A

A.13. Responses to “Finally, if there is anything else you would like to share regarding
PLDI 2020 then please do so here”
It was hard to find information about papers,
and I think a separate channel per pub makes a
lot of sense. It worked well at ICLR, I thought it
worked well for the tutorials at PLDI, and
keeping everything to a single thread doesn't
lend itself well to branching conversations.
Hugely impressive effort, great work by the
team.
Re the survey question about time-zones ... The
UTC+12 time-zone didn't include Auckland ...
probably the largest city by far :)
Thank you very much for giving us the
opportunity to attend PLDI 2020 virtually for
free!
Amazing work!
Great first conference for me. :) As someone
with fatigue issues, I was able to enjoy a lot
more of the talks than my normal energy level
would've allowed had it been in person.
Thank you so much for making this available to
the broader community and for doing such a
fantastic job, under the circumstances.
Huge shoutout to Ally and co for organizing
such a magnificent virtual conference! This was
my first PL conference and I enjoyed it,
especially the AMA and mentoring sessions. I
think I am gonna frequently visit PL conferences
from now on to meet more cool PL folks!
Thanks
Thank you to everyone involved!
I completely enjoyed the full virtual conference.
The fact that I can also watch the parallel tracks
later made me more comfortable about
replaying something before I ask a question. It
also provided me access to some great
mentoring sessions with seniors researchers
like Appel that I may have hesitated to ping
otherwise.
Thanks for the great conference!
Big thanks for the effort in organizing
everything.
Thank you for the *excellent* organization of
the conference! This was a tour de force
demonstrating how we can move to virtual
conferencing and must have taken an

impressive amount of effort (including the
student volunteers), for which I'm extremely
grateful as an attendee!
I am curious as to how many side-bar
conversations people felt they engaged in via
the virtual PLDI or afterwards as compared to
the physical PLDI.
Fantastic job by the organisers! Thank you very
much!
I appreciate the amazing amount of work the
organizers put in to make a virtual PLDI a great
experience!
I just want to say that y'all did an absolutely
amazing job! I was deeply surprised to learn
that we are already at a point where fully
virtual conferences can be this phenomenal. I
now believe that basically all conferences
should be virtual. Nice work!
Thank you!!
Where are the videos?? I missed most of the
conference and am trying to watch afterward.
Please post them. Thanks.
I want to thank the organisers for all the work
they have put in to pivot from a physical to a
virtual conference in such short notice. At the
same time, it's quite sad that it has to come to
a global pandemic for us to be experimenting
with all of these solutions when they have been
deeply needed for YEARS to tackle climate
change.
Given the circumstances you did a great job
Overall, a surprisingly smooth and rewarding
experience!
YouTube streaming of Zoom meetings seems to
have caused delays and a sense of
unsynchronized video and audio. I guess that
streaming directly to YouTube, not through
Zoom, could have avoided that.
Excellent job by the General Chair Ally, Dan,
and the entire crew in pulling it together.
Thanks folks for pulling this off! It was clear
how much time and effort you've all put into
organizing the conference once it went virtual
(and probably even more work planning it
when it was supposed to be physical). This was

by far one of my most enjoyable conference
experiences ever (physical or not)!
I wish to thank all the organizing members and
student volunteers for the great event, as well
as anyone who participated. I enjoyed the
event very very much.
It was nice, looking forward to next PLDI!
I will be so glad to join the 2021 edition of the
great conference
Thank you to PLDI organizers
Congratulations on a fantastically organized
event! I think virtual conferences have a bright
future. One thing I noticed was significantly
more attendance in some talks and
presentations that in a physical version of the
conference may not have been as well
attended. That is a positive sign for authors
whose work may, otherwise, have gone largely
unnoticed.
Thanks a lot for organizing virtual PLDI! This
was my first virtual conference. As a Ph.D.
student and a postdoc, I attended physical
conferences. I now work in an industry and
although I still work in on PL (static analysis), I
am no longer able to attend physical
conferences with few exceptions (because of
my employer - cost, family - three small
children, and remote geographical location). I
think that both formats have their own
(dis)advantages. I have to say that I benefit
from the online format a lot in my current
situation, but I think I would benefit from it
even as a Ph.D. student / a postdoc as I would
be able to attend major PL conferences more
often (from big conferences, I attended only FM
once and ECOOP once during my Ph.D. studies)
and thus better connect with other PL
researchers. Ignoring impact on the
environment, cost, family situation, and the
fact that I would be never able to attend major
PL conferences as often as I wanted if they
wouldn't be virtual, I would personally currently
still (strictly) prefer to attend a conference
physically. This might change when virtual
conference tooling would be more mature
though. Also, knowing that virtual conferencing
is possible, I have to say that I would be
uncomfortable supporting a physical format
knowing that it excludes many people and
harms environment. I strongly believe, that a

physical communication is superior to a virtual
communication. But a virtual communication is
strongly superior to no communication and
many (in fact most of the) people are excluded
from communication when the conference is
physical. That being said, I suggest to alternate
physical and virtual edition of PLDI. Assuming
that this would happen to other major PL
conferences and there would be some
coordination, there would be enough physical
and virtual PL conferences each year. For sure,
there are things from virtual conferences that
could be integrated to physical conferences
(streaming / recording of talks, making it
possible to ask and answer questions virtually,
making QA persistent and linked with the
paper), but I think that it is better to alternate
physical and virtual conferences than trying to
make "hybrid" conferences (for example trying
to incorporate online gathering to physical
conferences). I hope that there will emerge a
good platform for virtual conferencing, ideally
open and shared by other conferences. Thanks
again for organizing virtual PLDI!
Thanks for organizing it! This was a good
attempt. But there are still things we can learn.
I think Ally, John, and crew did an awesome job.
I like the idea of supporting antipodeans by
replicating live sessions (eg Q&A) at times that
work for them. But how would that work, if the
authors of a paper are all in one timezone, 12
hours away? There are lots of EU-only papers;
for them to have a Q&A that works for an NZ
audience, all the Q&As will have to be crammed
into narrow windows around 9am and 9pm.
Similarly for US East Coast papers and SE Asian
audiences, and vice versa.
The timezone problem was the major hurdle for
me. I expected a London timezone when I
signed up (as PLDI was supposed to be in
London), but understand how it might have
been adapted to speakers/attendants. I don’t
think the approach change particularly, but the
timezone should rotate over the years.
Brilliantly organised, thank you very much for
putting so much energy into this. Long may
virtual conferences continue. It very much
levels of the playing field, democratising the
conference experience for junior researchers,
PhD students, and those normally unable to

attend e.g. because of health or child care
issues.
Thank you for the great work!
It was a great success to adapt the PLDI
conference to circumstances as you did. Being
virtual (and free), it is accessible to many more
people than a physical conference. I would not
have seen any of it if it were physical. There is
absolute value in a physical conference, but it
also makes it exclusive. So for future
conferences a hybrid approach makes a lot of
sense.
Big thank you to all the work put in to make an
amazing conference happen online with mostly
no glitches during such a crazy time!
I'm not an academic and a lot of the presented
material wasn't accessible to me - I'd
understand with preparation, but I couldn't
follow some talks live. But that's fine! Because
the pre-recorded videos were available, all I
missed if I didn't follow was the Q&A, and I
wouldn't have asked questions anyway. It
worked out.
One thing that should be greatly improved is
the quality of audio for talks. Too many talks
had poor audio quality, which can be a pain for
the attendees. I guess one way to solve this
problem would be that the people who give the
talks could hear their own audio, which they
can do if the talks are pre-recorded.
Thank you very much for making it virtual and
available free of cost. Otherwise, at least I could
not have attended and benefited from it.
Thanks again.
Excellent event for this pandemic time, but
would always prefer a physical conference.
The video talks were so good that I think, even
at in-person conferences, there should be an
option to submit a YouTube video ahead of
time and just play it instead of giving a live talk.
This would also help people with visa issues or
children at home give talks at conferences. I
really think we still want (in non-pandemic
days) several hundred people (at least)
attending in person, because in person
attendance is amazing, is just super fun and a
great way to make lifelong connections. But
adding some kind of online option to
complement that seems like a strict victory. For
future online conferences (really all

conferences), I think you should hire someone
to do live captioning and to caption talks. I have
a lot of trouble understanding audio over video,
and despite really enjoying the few talks I tried
to watch, found it so tiring to try to follow the
audio that I watched only a few. This matches
my experiences at in-person conferences when
captions are not present; I usually just ignore
most of the talks and spend the conference
talking to people and making connections.
While I think in-person interaction is strictly
better than online interaction, I did find it very
nice to be able to see who was in a room before
walking around. This meant that it was easy to
avoid people in the community who had hurt
me, which made me feel much safer.
This attempt at a virtual conference has
convinced me that the idea of a virtual
conference does not work. For me, the point of
a conference is to move my physically out of my
normal environment so that I can spend 16+
hours a day interacting with my peers. This is
just not going to happen at a virtual
conference, when I'm inevitably going to be
trying to juggle all of my normal responsibilities,
and will be in the wrong time zone.
Thank you so much for all the work that went
into making PLDI virtual! I wouldn't have been
able to attend this year otherwise, regardless of
COVID-19, and I really enjoyed the parts I could
attend.
I just want to say a big "Thanks!" to the
committee on the work and thoughts that they
put in in making a virtual PLDI 2020 a success!
My responses here were fairly critical in nature
because I do feel that virtual conferences will
never be as useful as physical ones for some
purposes. That said, I think the PLDI organizers
did an *incredible* job, and that the
conference was quite amazing all things
considered. Fantastic job, keep up the good
work.
Thank you for organizing, this was an excellent
conference!
Thanks for organizing, it worked really well!
Also the non-existent entrance fee made this
event attendable for me, which I think was
really helpful for me (currently a PhD student).
Thank you! :)
Information about going from paid to free Slack
plan should have been shown in red

everywhere way before the conference since it
resulted in unavailability of search through the
messages. Being a novice in Slack I didn't e.g.
save the threads for two interesting papers to
go through the post-session questions and now
am unable to find them anymore
- Do demo day style pre-conference live
streams to deal with timezones. - Use surveys
to decide which talks/sessions get a livestream
during the conference and when. Everyone
should regardless submit a video upload of
their full talks - Have small groups formed
before the conference based on background
diversity to rate (as a group, not individually)
how cross functional the talks are. The group
would necessarily have to discuss or
communicate their own POV and experience
resulting in more attendee
intercommunication. The ratings them selves
could be another award category, or could be
meaningless and a necessary lie to get
attendees to talk with their fellow attendees.
Very well done! We can improve, but the whole
virtual conference idea still has a way to go in
general; much to learn. The organizers did a
great job for a first go-round at short notice.
This survey asks for ethnicity as part of the
demographics questions. The classification of
ethnicity is very US-centric. For an
international, conference, this is not ideal.
It was a pleasure to be able to attend PLDI for
the first time, given the circumstances. I think
the live presentations were good and
conducted to a high standard, with panels well
organised with the use of Sldio for questions.
The capability to watch presentations
asynchronously, and rewind if necessary, is
great to follow in-depth technical material. I
wish physical conferences could also provide
this option to attendees.
Thanks a lot for the awesome job in running
PLDI online!
1) Maybe it's time to ditch the conference
presentations (also in the physical conference).
The virtual conference for just highlighted that
they don't serve any use for me, and probably
others. 2) Please don't roll over recording and
editing responsibilities to authors. Authors end
up spending so much time on questionablyuseful activities. If we do go ahead with virtual,
pre-recorded presentations, consider adding

recording and video editing as services included
in the conference fees. If you think doing so is
prohibitively expensive, then re-think the
previous paragraph: it is at least this cost that
you are rolling over the community, who is
definitely less qualified to deliver it than what
organiser would be able to provide. If
community members feel that these videos
serve a real purpose for them, there's nothing
stopping them from investing the time and
effort involved in generating those videos,
putting them up on a streaming platform, and
linking to them from their own webpages. I just
don't buy it that producing videos is something
we should mandate.
Thanks for organizing it!
I think there were two key factors in the
succeed of PLDI 2020 1) professionalism for
part of the organizers 2) "charisma",
"coolness", "engagement" (not really sure
which word describe this better) of the
organizers The first point includes that I did not
experience any technical difficulties during the
conferences. The second point includes e.g.
that the organizers thought about gather to
mimic social interaction or the PC chair posting
very often in slack like "come and join me for a
drink" or "come and join in the mentoring
channel". While I think 1) has been and will be
achieved by many conferences, none of the
others two virtual conferences I attended so far
achieved 2)
Job well done :)
A lot of confusion ensued every time I had to
find the right YouTube link for a session. The
AM/PM split was a bad idea given that it was
attached to some timezone but not the one my
program was shown in (which I set to mine). It
also took me a bit to realize that AMAs had
their own stream. The slack channel topic
should link to some document that collects
*all* stream links, and it should always link to
the stream(s) that are live right now. That way
it is always clear where to get the current
stream links. > UTC+01:00 (Berlin, Rome, Paris,
Madrid, Warsaw, Lagos, Kinshasa, Algiers,
Casablanca) Berlin is in UTC+2 in the summer
(as in, right now), so this option is confusing.
Great conference! Thank you to the organizers
for doing such an incredible job

It is overall a very good experience, thank you
all for making this happen!
Thanks for all the effort that went into
converting the conference into a virtual event!!
Although I would have preferred to have been
in London, it was definitely worthwhile. I also
think that the pre-recorded talks and slackchannel record of answers to questions means
that these artifacts are *better* than what we
would have had from a physical meeting.
Great job PLDI 20!!
As a junior researcher, I am worried that
physical conferences will become a thing of the
past. I really hope that hybrid conferences can
become a nice middle ground, giving younger
researchers a chance to build relationships
while still remaining accessible to many
through the online component.
Thank you for much for organizing such a
wonderful event in a difficult time.
Live Q&A where remote participants can type
questions to be read by a session chair is
definitely the way to go. Slack unfortunately
doesn't encourage a way to sort questions by
votes. It would be better if there was more
encouragement to submit questions in advance
and people had time to consider and upvote
the best questions, and the session chairs were
encouraged to priortize the best questions
(combining popularity and their judgement on
what questions would yield the most insightful
discussion).
If the conference cannot be held physically,
then just cancel the whole thing and let's go
back to publishing in journals. There's no
reason to have arbitrary deadlines without a
physical conference.
Huge thanks, friends! I'm happy this happened
(in a sense, I think COVID too!).
Please keep the AMA sessions in the future
edition of PLDI. They were so great and useful!
Thank you so much for the great conference, it
was my first time attending, i hope it will not be
my last. I learned so much from researchers
and experts.
Thank you so much for this great conference, it

PLDI exceeded my expectation as a virtual
conference, but in the long run I think only
virtual conferences will weaken our
community. We need to get together physically
at least once or twice a year for all the informal
social interactions that really make the
community strong. There's no replacement for
the experiences, mentoring, and community
growth that are fostered by all the dinners, long
evenings at the hotel bars, etc. with diverse
mixes of new and established researchers that
can happen when we physically meet.
I think that PLDI 2020 was organized
fantastically! Especially given no prior
experience with virtual conferences and the
limited time to prepare. Thanks!
Virtual conference really reduces the barrier to
entry - my area is only tangentially related, but
had this been a costly (in terms of money and
time) event, I would not have attended. But the
flip side is that I'm also less committed, I can
pick and choose events and intersperse things
through my normal day, as opposed to doing
nothing but conference activities.
This was the 3rd major virtual conference that I
attended since the beginning of COVID. I
attended EuroSys which used the DISCORD
system for "meetings" and that was as much as
disaster as PLDI. Didn't talk to a single new
person, it was just groups of people who knew
each other already doing Google Meet chats on
the side. I also attended IEEE Security and
Privacy and that worked A LOT better. They
used a totally integrated solution with a paid
Zoom account that allowed 1000 simultaneous
attendees, and they had a nice web based
platform that tied it all together. It also wasn't
free - and IEEE apparently paid $65,000 for the
three day technical setup. But the attendee
experience was so many leaps and bounds
above the two other conferences that it is
probably worth it.
Thanks for all the hard work! Given the limited
time you all had, it was very well executed, we
all learned a lot.
Congratulations for making this happen! This
was really impressive. Even if in principle
ASPLOS slack-only mode with videos may seem
to offer similar functionality, I believe that
having scheduled video streams and questions
makes a difference.

Ally did a great job

questions, I felt like the mentoring
opportunities were very oriented towards
people already/still in academia. The only
people talking about their experience in
industry seemed to be talking about it coming
from academic research, not the other way
around. (And I also think that's fine; not every
event has to cater to my personal situation, but
thought I'd mention it.)
when a conference is virtual, going overtime is
very disturbing
It was an amazing effort to pull of a virtual
conference in such a short time. I still feel like I
got way less than a physical conference, but it
was way, way better than I had originally
anticipated.
Thanks for organising this conference,
especially during such difficult circumstances!
The registration process is somewhat
complicated.
We'll need to work on the tech to make it
easier for the organizers, more seamless for the
participants, and of more consistently high
quality (for some of the talks, video was too
fuzzy to read slides).
I would have appreciated a clearly labelled
informal chat
Congratulations on a job fantastically well
done!
Great job!
Please add extended poster session for each
presented paper. It is a great fit for virtual
conference. It creates more interactions
between the authors of a paper and other
attendees of the conference.
Congratulations to all organisers! It’s a massive
effort to put a conference like that together,
specially during this unprecedented time.
I would like to thanks PLDI organizing
committee for organize PLDI every year. for this
we learned many things & enlarged our
knowledge.
Thank you! I thought it was great. I think it
would be nice if future conferences had some
small virtual component for people who
otherwise wouldn’t have attended.
Please keep 1:1 Meeting and ask me anything! I
really really enjoyed them!
Thank you very much for organising an
excellent virtual conference! I particularly liked

that no fees were charged so that attendees
without a budgets (e.g., from developing
countries) were on equal footing with those
who have the privilege of a travel and
conference budget.
Please don't impose the use of proprietary
software on the participants
While I thought this was well run overall, I felt
documentation was either lacking or hard to
find. I struggled to find the right video feed, saw
something about /video but could never figure
out what that was, am still not sure whether
watching over the youtube link is what I was
supposed to do, etc. Admittedly, I didn't watch
the "how PLDI will work" video, so it's probably
my fault. But I can't stand watching videos to
find things like URLs and commands.
It was very well run! The videos prerecorded
explaining the conference were fantastic!
The ability to pause, rewind, and then catch-up
by playing at 1.5x in YouTube was incredibly
useful for paper comprehension, and
dangerously addictive as a way of watching...
It was a very nice chance to explore the
community of PLDI as someone from a different
community. As I only had limited time available
during the week I was glad that I could watch
the talks on the go through Youtube. At the
same time, there were several main track talks
which I could not watch in my timezone.
Otherwise: Thanks for making this possible!
Actually, next time I would save more time in
my schedule for a virtual PLDI
Special mention for Jay Lorch, who changed
costumes throughout his recorded
presentation. It was hilarious. :)
great event! a BIG thank you to all the
organizers
I think the community pulled it together in a
positive way, and I think we should all be proud
of this. But when we can resume in-person
meetings we should do so.
I was a presenter at one of the PLDI co-located
events, and the presentation was scheduled at
4:00 am in my timezone. Fortunately I was able
to submit a pre-recorded presentation video,
but it was a shame that I had to stay up late to
attend the live Q&A session. It would have been
better if the chairs had considered authors'
time zone when scheduling the sessions. Still, I
had a wonderful experience attending these

events and I'm very grateful for all the people
who made this conference possible in this hard
time!!
Thank you for all your work! And also for
collecting this data and making sure other
conferences can profit from the PLDI lessons
learned :)
I find almost all PLDI research track
presentations too hard to follow; for most of
them, I don't even get what problem that paper
is trying to address.
Congratulations to transitioning so efficiently to
a remote conference
under normal circumstances (ie with child
care!) I would have engaged much more with
the virtual conference. it worked out amazingly
well. congrats!
Thanks for organizing virtual PLDI, which - given
the circumstances - has been a great event!
Given the situation, PLDI’s organization was
great! Thanks to Aly and everyone else involved
Links to video streamings and other contents
are not clearly exposed, so I've lost time trying
to find the correct stream or I couldn't find it in
slack channels.
A big THANKS to the organizers, it was great :)
I’m a fan of various proposals knocking around
to center SIGPLAN in-person events on one big
event per year, with more virtual events
throughout the year to complement.
Thanks for virtual pldi, I love pldi
Thanks! I think this was very well executed. I
didn't spend as much time as I would've liked to
"at" the conference, since I was also existing in
my own timezone and still had
meetings/work/etc. But, I was really impressed
with the amount of engagement. The
mentoring channel was great, too.
Virtual environments have a huge potential to
be immersive in a way that streaming video,
Slack and even Gather-style video chats are not.
Twenty years ago I played networked Quake
over a 56K modem, and while the latency was
awful, it had an immediacy and sense of
"sharing a space" that our virtual conferences
would do well to capture using today's more
capacious technology. Much hard work and
hard funding needed of course....

I was not able to register a Zoom account in
order to join the meeting and I did not know
how to log into Slack properly; after all, I did
not know to whom I can turn for help.
Thank you. It was amazing!!
*** THANK YOU to Ally, James, Crista,
Benjamin, Jens and all the others, you have
worked wonders ***
Fantastic job by all the organizers, but very
especially Ally!!
This is more a personal observation, but one
challenge I had during the week was balancing
PLDI with other commitments (work, family,
etc). It's not like a physical conference where it
is easy to detach from everything else for a
couple days. More focussed times with clear
break times may have helped. Parallel tracks
would probably have been fine to help with
this. Thanks for putting this on -- it was a huge
effort on short notice and serves as a model of
how we can continue to work as a community
moving forward. Thanks!
Well done on this first online edition of PLDI. I
was pleasantly surprised by how well it was
organised. Don't keep this experience just
within your group of people. Write up what you
did, what considerations were made, etc. and
publish it online! I'm sure very many other
conferences would benefit from having an
experience report / guide to online conferences
to read.
This was my first PLDI, if it were hosted in
london I most likely wouldn't have been able to
attend. I was really surprised with how caring
people were to me as a student. If possible I
will definitely try to attend future editions!
I paid for proceedings at registration but
haven’t seen anything; this process seems
broken. Also: slight condescending attitude in
some sessions towards industry.
Thanks a lot for a superbly-organized
conference!
Your effort to take things virtual were
absolutely excellent!
Virtual conferences are good, useful, and help a
lot of people. Except myself. I feel
disadvantaged by them. Timing: I have a hard
time justifying to myself attending a virtual
event. Social interactions: I hate Zoom etc on a
good day, and can't bring myself to interact

with people virtually. In a physical setting, I am
forced to do it, which is much better for myself.
So, yeah, I would like to have physical
conference from time to time still.
My research group would have been able to
pay for me if we had to, but if PLDI stays virtual,
I think it should be a priority to try and keep it
also free, because everyone is not lucky to be
able to pay several hundred dollars for that
kind of events, and it's a great way to open up
the PL community
Due to my other responsibilities I could not
watch everything I wanted to yet. I fully intend
to watch more and ever rewatch some. I have.
Thus, the amount of material I consumed is
understated in this survey. I also shared this
material with many of my students and
colleagues. I think a great resource has
emerged via this virtual conference. Much
appreciated.
Great efforts, enormous thanks for putting on
such a Great show!
Amazing job. Went so smoothly that it was not
until business meeting that I realised what you
had all been up against. Superheroes!
I enjoyed tutorial on Spoofax
Many thanks to the organizers and all who
helped this to happen. This is fantastic.
It was not obvious that things were going so
well and surely required a lot of hard work
behind the scene, which often can be
underestimated. Thank you for the really good
organization of the virtual conference, I
enjoyed it.
Overall, great job given the time y'all had to
prepare. In my view, a virtual conference does
not have the same appeal as a in-person
meeting. However, it has the advantage of
being more inclusive than a physical meeting.
Ally, John, Emina, and the student volunteers
did a fantastic job organising this first-of-its
kind virtual event. I think you already know it,
but I feel like it couldn't be stressed enough. :)
I am planning on watching some of the records
later (I hope they remain available), as the
previous week has been a busy time for me at
university.
I thank organizers for all the efforts.

(a) I would have liked a dedicated poster
session/timeslot (b) I believe that the remote
format hurt PhD students, who had the least
opportunity for exposure to more "senior"
people (as in physical conferences)
Much of the mentoring was US/North America
related, while I would have appreciated to
know more about European academics (I don't
plan on having a career in NA)
Thanks to the organizers, you made a very good
thing from a very difficult situation!
I felt that more information should be given out
before the start of PLDI20, it felt that things
were given out piecemeal at times which led to
some confusion
Thanks!
This was obviously a huge amount of work to
put on, and I am afraid I would have gotten a
lot more value out of blocking out the same
amount of time to simply read PLDI papers.
Thanks a lot for all the time and effort you put
into organizing virtual PLDI. Under the
circumstances of a global pandemic, I think it
was a great conference!
It felt like a great job for a virtual conference,
and it was a lot better than I thought it would
be. That being said, I still strongly prefer nonvirtual conferences, though I see that with
climate change we might not want to do these
that often. Maybe a rotation model among the
four big SIGPLAN conferences would be good,
with two of them each year live (pandemic
permitting) and the other two virtual (to save
on CO2). As for one last problem with virtual
conferences that I may have not been asked
about because I didn't give a talk at PLDI, but
personally, I feel the connection to the
audience is missing both via Zoom and
obviously when recording a video (also,
recording a video is a lot more effort).
Congratulations on holding a pretty good event
in really adverse circumstances.
A huge thank you to the organizers who are the
heroes of PLDI.
Great Job Organizers - Hope you all get an
award
Thank you making it available to everyone. It
was a nice learning experience attending PLDI
2020. The mentoring sessions in PLMW were

outstanding. Thanks to all the researchers,
participant and especially to the organizers.
Overall I think this year PLDI is great and well
organized.
the survey is way too longer than I expected,
would you please make it shorter (next time)?
This was the first international conference I
attended and it was amazing. I feel really
inspired now!
The goal of a virtual conference should not be
to reproduce a physical one as closely as
possible, this can only fail. Rather, the goal
should be to identify what works *better*
virtually than physically, and change the format
to take advantage of this.
Great job in a tight spot!
Overall, PLDI 2020 has gone virtual successfully.
Given how quickly this was put together, I think
that this conference worked well. I think that
youtube live streams are a good approach to
broadcasting. I think something other than
slack should be used (presumably most of the
messages are going to disappear once someone
stops paying for the premium account)
This was my first PLDI and found it amazing!
The talks that I've seen live were incredible
pieces of work. I hope that next PLDIs were online or have such streaming in order to allow
people unable to attend due to financial
reasons.
Thank you very much for giving me the
opportunity to participate !!!
I look forward to seeing you in person
Thanks everyone

Make it so AMA people can respond in text to
individual questions later. I didn't see how to do
that.
Very good conference given the unfortunate
circumstances.
As a member of the ICFP OC, I learned a lot
from this virtual PLDI. Huge thanks to the
organizers, as well as the contributors of the
PLDI song!
Great Conference Installation
I really liked the ability to role back in the live
feeds and to play those feeds at a faster pace to
in some cases "catch up". Being able to pause
was also quite helpful since we were at home
and family interruptions are inevitable. I am
super impressed overall with how well Ally and
his crew handled the switch to online including
giving keynote speakers the opportunity to opt
for 2021, the AMA sessions, the incredible
advertising of PLDI on twitter, the slack
presence of organizers, and the clear
information to authors. Well done!!!!!
Thank you for all the organization, it was a
complete success!
Great job, thanks!
being able to replay talks with different
playback speeds is very useful. Using @here in
slack so often meant i just ignored the slack
notifications most of the time
Great job!
One advantage of virtual PLDI is that I can
watch some video after the talk for more than
one time. It would be great if PLDI could
provide presentation videos online in the
future. Thanks.
It was a nice experience, and I hope virtual
conferences continue. Thanks for setting it up!
