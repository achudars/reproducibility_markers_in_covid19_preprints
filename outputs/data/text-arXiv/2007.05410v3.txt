General Idea: Health threat from SARS-CoV-2 airborne infection has become a public emergency of
international concern. During the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, people have been advised by the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to maintain social distancing of at least 2 m to limit the
risk of exposure to the coronavirus. Experimental data, however, show that infected aerosols and
droplets trapped inside a turbulent puff cloud can travel 7 to 8 m. We carry out a physics modeling
study for SARS-CoV-2 transport in air.
Methodology: We propose a nuclear physics analogy-based modeling of the complex gas cloud and
its payload of pathogen-virions. The cloud is modeled as a spherical puff of hot moist air (with
mucosalivary filaments), which remains coherent in a volume that varies from 0.00025 to 0.0025 m3 .
The puff propagates scattering off the air molecules. We estimate the puff effective stopping range
adapting the high-energy physics model that describes the slow down of α-particles (in matter) via
interactions with the electron cloud.
Research Findings: We show that the stopping range is proportional to the product of the puff’s diameter
and its density. We use our puff model to determine the average density of the buoyant fluid in the
turbulent cloud. A fit to the experimental data yields 1.8 < ρP /ρair < 4.0, where ρP and ρair are the
average density of the puff and the air. We demonstrate that temperature variation could cause an
O(±8%) effect in the puff stopping range for extreme ambient cold or warmth. We also demonstrate
that aerosols and droplets can remain suspended for hours in the air. Therefore, once the puff slows
down sufficiently, and its coherence is lost, the eventual spreading of the infected aerosols becomes
dependent on the ambient air currents and turbulence.
Practical Implications: Viral transmission pathways have profound implications for public safety. Our
study forewarns a health threat of SARS-CoV-2 airborne infection in indoor spaces. We argue in favor
of implementing additional precautions to the recommended 2 m social distancing, e.g. wearing a
face mask when we are out in public.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The current outbreak of the respiratory disease identified as COVID-19 is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, shortened to SARS-CoV2 [1–4]. The outbreak was first reported in December
2019, and has become a worldwide pandemic with over
10 million cases as of 1 July 2020. SARS-CoV-2 have been
confirmed worldwide and so the outbreak has been declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization. The pandemic has spread around the globe to
almost every region, with only a handful of the World
Health Organization’s member states not yet reporting
cases. Most of these states are small island nations in the
Pacific Ocean, including Vanuatu, Tuvalu, Samoa, and
Palau.
The coronavirus can spread from person-to-person in
an efficient and sustained way by coughing and sneezing. The virus can spread from seemingly healthy carriers or people who had not yet developed symptoms [5].

To understand and prevent the spread of the virus, it is
important to estimate the probability of airborne transmission as aerosolization with particles potentially containing the virus. Before proceeding, we pause to note
that herein we follow the convention of the World Health
Organization and refer to particles which are & 5 µm
diameter as droplets and those . 5 µm as aerosols or
droplet nuclei [6].
There are various experimental measurements suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may have the potential to be
transmitted through aerosols; see e.g. [7–11]. Indeed,
laboratory-generated aerosols with SARS-CoV-2 were
found to keep a replicable virus in cell culture throughout the 3 hours of aerosol testing [12]. Of course these
laboratory-generated aerosols may not be exactly analogous to human exhaled droplet nuclei, but they helped
in establishing that the survival times of SARS-CoV-2 depend on its environment, including survival times of: up
to 72 hours on plastics, up to 48 hours on stainless steel,
up to 24 hours on cardboard, up to 4 hours on copper,
and in air for 3 to 4 hours [12]. On first glimpse this finding is surprising, as one would expect that the properties
of air that degrade the SARS-CoV-2 exterior should abate
at roughly half that time if it were adhered to a surface
(i.e. at least half the solid angle is mostly exposed to
air). However, the laboratory-generated aerosols have

2
shown that a precise description of SARS-CoV-2 main
characteristics requires more complex systems in which
the virus would be chemisorbed by some surfaces and
repelled by the others. More concretely, the survival
probability of the virus is associated with the surface energies of the various materials that can reduce the solid
angle exposed to air molecule collisions. These properties can lead to remarkable differences , for example that
between copper and stainless steel. Despite the fact both
are metals, copper causes destruction of the virus much
more rapidly than does stainless steel.
The number of virions needed for infection is yet unknown. However, it is known that viral load differs
considerably between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 [13].
A study of the variance of viral loads in patients of different ages found no significant difference between any
pair of age categories including children [14].
Beyond a shadow of a doubt, a major question of this
pandemic has been how far would be far enough to elude
droplets and to diffuse droplet nuclei if a person nearby
is coughing or sneezing. The rule of thumb for this pandemic has been a 2 m separation. Nevertheless, this has
never been a magic number that guarantees complete
protection. Indeed, experiment shows that: (i) respiratory particles emitted during a sneeze or cough are
initially transported as a turbulent cloud that consists of
hot and moist exhaled air and mucosalivary filaments;
(ii) aerosols and small droplets trapped in the turbulent
puff cloud could propagate 7 to 8 m [15–18]. Moreover,
once the cloud slows down sufficiently, and its coherence
is lost, the eventual spreading of the infected aerosols
becomes dependent on the ambient air currents and turbulence [19]. In this paper we provide new guidance to
address this question by introducing a physics model for
SARS-CoV-2 transport in air.
To develop some sense for the orders of magnitude
involved, we begin by reviewing the experimental data.
A survey of 26 analyses reporting particle sizes generated from breathing, coughing, sneezing and talking indicates that healthy individuals generate particles with
sizes in the range 0.01 . DV /µm . 500, whereas individuals with infections produce particles in the range
0.05 . DV /µm . 500, where DV is the diameter of
a respiratory particle (droplet or droplet nucleus) containing the virus [20]. The majority of the particles
containing the virus have outlet velocities in the range
10 . vV,0 /(m/s) . 30 [18, 21, 22]. Up to 104.6 particles are
expelled at an initial velocity of 30 m/s during a sneeze,
and a cough can generate approximately 103.5 particles
with outlet velocities of 20 m/s [23]. 97% of coughed particles have sizes 0.5 . DV /µm . 12, and the primary size
distribution is within the range 1 . DV /µm . 2 [24, 25].
The evaporation rate of the respiratory particles depends
on the exposed surface area, A ∼ πD2V , while the particle’s volume scales as V ∼ πD3V /6. Therefore, the ratio
of area to volume is A/V ∝ 1/DV , and it is the smallest
droplets that will live the longest.
The layout of the paper is as follows. In Sec. II we

review the generalities of aerodynamic drag force and
estimate the terminal speed of aerosols and droplets. In
Sec. III we model the elastic scattering of the turbulent
cloud with the air molecules and estimate the puff stopping range assuming standard ambient temperature and
pressure conditions. After that, we use our puff model
to determine the average density of the buoyant fluid
in the turbulent cloud. The paper wraps up with some
conclusions presented in Sec. IV.
II.

TERMINAL SPEED

When a particle propagates through the air, the surrounding air molecules have a tendency to resist its motion. This resisting force is known as the aerodynamic
drag force. For a spherical particle, the aerodynamic
drag force is given by
Fd = 3π ηair DV vV

1
.
κ

(1)

where ηair ' 1.8×10−5 kg/(m · s) is the dynamic viscosity
of air and vV is the virus velocity vector. Eq.(1) is the wellknown Stokes’ law, with the Cunningham slip correction
factor κ; see Appendix for details. Stokes’ law assumes
that the relative velocity of a carrier gas at a particle’s
surface is zero; this assumption does not hold for small
particles. The slip correction factor should be applied to
Stokes’ law for particles smaller than 10 µm.
The particle Reynolds number,
R=

DV vV ρair
,
ηair

(2)

is a dimensionless quantity which represents the ratio of
inertial forces to viscous forces, where ρair ' 1.2 kg/m3
is the air density at a temperature of 20◦ C (293 K). For
R < 1, the inertial forces can be neglected. The drag
calculated by Eq.(1) has an error of about 12% at R ≈ 1.
The error decreases with decreasing particle Reynolds
number.
For the case at hand, R > 1. In the vertical direction,
the upward component of the aerodynamic drag force
Fd,⊥ is counterbalanced by the excess of the gravitational
attraction over the air buoyancy force
Fg =

1
π D3V (ρH2 O − ρair ) g ,
6

(3)

where ρH2 O ' 997 kg/m3 and g ' 9.8 m/s2 is the acceleration of gravity. Since ρair  ρH2 O the air buoyancy force becomes negligible, and so F g ≈ MV g, with
MV the aerosol mass. When the upward aerodynamic
drag force equals the gravitational attraction the droplet
reaches mechanical equilibrium and starts falling with a
terminal speed

The terminal speed is ∝ D2V (due to the diameter dependence of the mass), and hence larger droplets would have
larger terminal velocities thereby reaching the ground
faster. The terminal speed for various particle sizes is
given in Table I. The time t f it will take the virus to fall to
the ground is simply given by the distance to the ground
divided by vV, f,⊥ . For an initial height, h ∼ 2 m, we find
that for DV = 2 µm,
tf =

The time scale as a function of the droplet size and heigth
is shown in Fig. 1.
The aerodynamic drag force holds for rigid spherical
particles moving at constant velocity relative to the gas
flow. To determine the stopping range, in the next section we model the elastic scattering of the turbulent puff
cloud with the air molecules.

III.

STOPPING RANGE

Respiratory particles of saliva and mucus are expelled
together with a warm and humid air, which generates
a convective current. The aerosols and droplets are initially transported as part of a coherent gas puff of buoyant fluid. The ejected puff of air remains coherent in
a volume that varies from 0.00025 to 0.0025 m3 [26].
This corresponds to a puff size 0.78 . DP /m . 1.68,
where follwoing [26] we have taken an entrainment
coefficient [27] of α = 0.1. The puff is ejected with
1 . vV,0,k /(m/s) . 10 [26]. The turbulent puff cloud
consists of an admixture of moist exhaled air and mucosalivary filaments. Next, in line with our stated plan,
we use the experimental data to calculate the range of
the average density of the buoyant fluid in the turbulent
cloud.
The mass ratio of the average air molecule compared
to the aerosol, mair /MV , is roughly 10−12 (since the size of

the aerosol and the mass for its chief constituent, H2 O,
compared to the air molecule are 104 and 103 ), though
there is an obvious variation with aerosol size at constant
density. If we consider instead the mass inside the puff
MP the ratio R ≡ mair /MP is even smaller. Due to the
enormous mass ratio, the virions inside the puff will not
undergo large angular deflections, so we will treat the
virions as having the same direction for its initial and
final velocities (since we are looking at a stopping distance, this is a reasonable assumption). Starting with the
non-relativistic one-dimensional equation for the virus
velocity β we have in the lowest nontrivial order (in

with β0 = vV,0,k , and vair,0 and vair, f the initial and final
velocities of the air molecule, respectively. As the velocity β falls with each interaction, the velocity loss remains
constant; the target particle is a new air molecule at each
interaction.
Though individual air molecules are traveling at an
average speed of a few hundred meters per second,
throughout we assume the medium to be stationary. In
analogy with the description of the slowing down of
alpha particles in matter (which assumes the electronic
cloud is at rest), we can describe the scattering of the
puff in the frame in which the air molecule is at rest, i.e.,

4
vair,0 = 0 (in essence, adopting a stationary medium on
average). The stopping power is given by the velocityloss equation

with β f ≡ vV, f,k . Note that L/λV
is not only the number
mfp
of mean free paths traversed by the fiducial virus, but
is also the number of interactions of the virus with air
molecules; of course, there is a one-to-one correlation
between the number of mean free paths traveled and
interactions.
Since β is homogeneous and the mass ratio R is a constant for a given puff size DP , we have the above simple
equation. The mass ratio R is very small, and (2R)−1
is correspondingly very large. There are a tremendous
number of mean free paths/interactions involved as the
virions bowling ball rolls over the air molecule.
Finally, we must calculate λV
= 1/(nair σ). The air
mfp
molecules act collectively as a fluid, so the volume V
over the air density is given by the ideal gas law as kB T/P,
where P is the pressure, T the temperature, and kB is the
Boltzmann constant. We assume a contact interaction
equal to the cross-sectional hard-sphere size of the puff,
i.e. σ = π(DP /2)2 . Substituting into Eq.(9) we obtain the
final result for the stopping distance

We take the sneeze or cough which causes the droplets
expulsion to be at a standard ambient air pressure of P =
101 kPa and a temperature of T ∼ 293 K. It is important to
stress that temperature variation could cause an O(. ±8%)
effect in L for extreme ambient cold or warmth. We now
proceed to fit the experimental data. For L ∼ 8 m and
taking vV, f,k ∼ 3 mm/s [16], we obtain 1.8 < ρP /ρair < 4.0
for 0.78 . DP /m . 1.68, where ρP is the average density
of the fluid in the puff.
A point worth noting at this juncture is that our model
provides an effective description of the turbulent puff
cloud. Note that independently of their size and their
initial velocity all respiratory particles in the cloud experience both gravitational settling and evaporation.
Aerosols and droplets of all sizes are subject to continuous settling, but those with settling speed smaller than
the fluctuating velocity of the surrounding puff would
remain trapped longer within the puff. Actually, because
of evaporation the water content of the respiratory particles is monotonically decreasing. At the point of almost
complete evaporation the settling velocity of the aerosols
is sufficiently small that they can remain trapped in the

puff and get advected by ambient air currents and dispersed by ambient turbulence. The size of the puff then
continuously grows in time [26]. Our result can equivalently be interpreted in terms of the effective coherence
length of the turbulent cloud assuming ρP ∼ ρair . The
effective size of the puff and its effective density are entangled in Eq. (10). Numerical simulations show that
during propagation the puff edge grows ∝ t1/4 [16]. After a 100 s the puff would grow by a factor of 3 (see Fig. 7
in [26]), in agreement with our analytical estimates. In
closing, we note that if we ignore the motion of the air
puff carrying the aerosols, as in the analysis of [28], it is
straightforward to see substituting R by mair /MV ∼ 10−12
into Eq. (10) that the individual aerosols would not travel
more than a few cm away from the exhaler, even under
conditions of fast ejections, such as in a sneeze. This
emphasizes the relevance of incorporating the complete
multiphase flow physics in the modeling of respiratory
emissions when ascertaining the risk of SARS-CoV-2 airborne infection.
IV.

CONCLUSIONS

We have carried out a physics modeling study for
SARS-CoV-2 transport in air. We have developed a nuclear physics analogy-based modeling of the complex
gas cloud and its payload of pathogen-virions. Using our
puff model we estimated the average density of the fluid
in the turbulent cloud is in the range 1.8 < ρP /ρair < 4.0.
We have also shown that aerosols and droplets can remain suspended for hours in the air. Therefore, once the
puff slows down sufficiently, and its coherence is lost,
the eventual spreading of the infected aerosols becomes
dependent on the ambient air currents and turbulence.
De facto, as it was first pointed out in [19] and later developed in [29, 30] airflow conditions strongly influence
the distribution of viral particles in indoor spaces, cultivating a health threat from COVID-19 airborne infection.
Altogether, it seems reasonable to adopt additional
infection-control measures for airborne transmission in
high-risk settings, such as the use of face masks when
in public. If the results of this study - t f of O(hr) for
aerosols, for example - are borne out by experiment, then
these findings should be taken into account in policy
decisions going forward as we continue to grapple with
this pandemic.
Appendix

There are important considerations in the development of Stokes’ law, including the hypothesis that the
gas at particle surface has zero velocity relative to the
particle. This hypothesis holds well when the diameter
of the particle is much larger than the mean free path
of gas molecules. The mean free path λair
is the avmfp
erage distance traveled by a gas molecule between two

5
successive collisions. In analyses of the interaction between gas molecules and particles, it is convenient to use
the Knudsen number Kn = 2λair
/DV , a dimensionless
mfp
number defined as the ratio of the mean free path to particle radius. For Kn & 1, the drag force is smaller than
predicted by Stokes’ law. Conventionally this condition
is described as a result of slip on the particle surface. The
so-called slip correction is estimated to be [31]
