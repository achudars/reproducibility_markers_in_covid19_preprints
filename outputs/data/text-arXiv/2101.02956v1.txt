Abstract
Content alignment in news media was an observable information effect of Covid-19’s initial phase.
During the first half of 2020, legacy news media became ‘corona news’ following national outbreak
and crises management patterns. While news media are neither unbiased nor infallible as sources of
events, they do provide a window into socio-cultural responses to events. In this paper, we use legacy
print media from Denmark to empirically derive the principle News Information Decoupling (NID)
that functions as an information signature of culturally significant catastrophic event. Formally, NID
provides input to change detection algorithms and points to several unsolved research problems in
the intersection of information theory and media studies.

Introduction
As the first wave of Covid-19 virus spread across the world, content alignment of news stories could be observed both within and between media sources. During December 2019 and
February 2020, Covid-19 news stories were, outside China, interspersed with news coverage
of other events (e.g., Hong Kong protests, Iranian–American confrontation, Trump impeachment). As the virus spread across Europe and America, news media front pages focused almost
exclusively on the pandemic, all news sections (politics, business, sports, and arts) related to
Covid-19, and breaking news became corona news in continuously updated media. From the
perspective of cultural dynamics, the Covid-19 pandemic provides a natural experiment that
allows us to study the effect of a global catastrophe on the the dynamics of news media’s

information. While news media are neither unbiased nor infallible as sources of events, they
do reflect preferences, values, and desires of a wide socio-cultural and political user spectrum.
As such, news media coverage of Covid-19 functions as a proxy for how cultural information
systems respond to unexpected and dangerous events.
Previous studies have shown that variation in newspapers’ word usage is sensitive to the
dynamics of socio-cultural events [1, 2, 3], can detect event-driven shifts [4], and accurately
can model effects of change in comprehensive collections of newspapers [5]. Furthermore,
the co-occurrence structure of newspapers has been shown to accurately capture thematic
development [6], and, when modelled dynamically, is indicative of the evolution of cultural
values and biases [2, 7]. Adaptive smoothing and fractal analysis of word frequencies over time
have been used to identify distinct domains of newspaper content (e.g., advertisements vs.
articles) [8] and to discriminate between different classes of catastrophic events that display
class-specific fractal signatures in, among other things, word usage in newspapers [9]. Several
studies have shown that measures of (relative) entropy can detect fundamental conceptual
differences between distinct periods [1], concurrent normative and ideological movements [10],
and even, development of ideational factors (e.g., creative expression) in temporally dependent
writings [11, 12, 13]. More specifically, a set of methodologically related studies studies have
applied windowed relative entropy to thematic text representations to generate signals that
capture information novelty as a reliable content difference from the past and resonance as
the degree to which future information conforms to said novelty [10, 11]. Two recent studies
have found that successful social media content show a strong association between novelty and
resonance [14], and that variation in the novelty-resonance association can predict significant
change points in historical data [15].
In this study we expand upon studies of novelty and resonance in cultural dynamics by
modeling change in printed news media during the initial phase of Covid-19. Specifically, we
propose the empirically derived principle of News Information Decoupling, which explains how
the information flow in legacy media responds to catastrophic events.

panel are estimated using a nonlinear adaptive filter, see appendix A.

Results
The reported results are based on a sample of fours national newspapers in Denmark that
collectively represents moderate-left (Politiken) and moderate-right (Berlingske), and left (Information) and right-wing political observation (Ekstrabladet). This paper focuses on moderate
newspapers during phase 1 of Covid-19, but all results have been confirmed for the full political spectrum as well as all national newspapers in Denmark (see Appendix A for details on
methods and data).
To establish a baseline for novelty and resonance, we computed the pr. newspaper linear
slope for resonance on novelty (N × R) from December 01, 2019 to February 26, 2020 (the first
case of Covid-19 in Denmark was registered on February 27, 2020). As can be observed from
Figure 1, the slopes are remarkably similar, indicating a medium to strong association between
novelty and resonance (M = 0.56, SD = 0.06) before the national outbreak of Covid-19. In
the normal state of affairs, novelty and resonance therefore seems to be coupled such that
novel news items tend to resonate more than overused and repetitive items and vice versa.
This general news dynamic confirms the intuition that news media, all things being equal,
maintain their relevance by propagating news.
The normal state of affairs was however severely disrupted by the rapid spread of Covid-19
and following lockdown on March 13. For Politiken in Figure 2 it is apparent that between the
first case (‘Virus’) and the ‘Lockdown’ there is a non-linear decrease in novelty (upper panel)
which is countered by an inverted resonance response (middle panel). This initial decoupling

of novelty and resonance does, in other words, coincide with the catastrophic Covid-19 event.
While slightly less pronounced, the same decoupling patterns can be observed in Berlingske,
see Figure 3. In fact, decoupling of novelty and resonance can be observed in all national
broadsheet newspapers irrespective of political observation and rare news phenomena where
all news items are concerned with one event for an extended period of time (> 3 weeks).
An interesting contrast that may be politically motivated can be observed around the phase
1 ‘Opening’ at April 15. While the center-left newspaper Politiken was quite fast at reestablishing an almost normal state of affairs, the center-right Berlingske showed a delayed
linear novelty response for the remainder of the first phase. This is likely to reflect the level
of support for the center-left government’s decision making regarding lockdown and opening.
The center-right newspaper seems to retain the decoupling for longer as they continue to focus
on the economic and societal consequences of the government’s Covid-19 policies.
The N × R computed on event-defined windows, e.g., ‘Lockdown → Opening’, can be used
for simple change detection technique, see Figures 2 and 3 lower panels. As phase 1 unfolds, the
decoupling is observed as loss of association between novelty and resonance. In the ‘V irus →
Lockdown’ window (middle plot in lower panel), the slope approaches zero (for Politiken
the slope is actually negative), when the decoupling is most pronounced. The partial return
to normal can be observed in the (dis-)similarity between ‘→ W uhan’ and ‘Opening →’
(Politiken: 0.65 → 0.6, and Berlingske: 0.48 → 0.36).

Concluding Remarks
In conclusion we propose the empirically-derived News Information Decoupling (NID) principle, which states that in response to unexpected and dangerous temporally extended events, the
ordinary information dynamics of news media are (initially) decoupled such that the content
novelty decreases as media focus monotonically on the catastrophic event, but the resonant
property of said content increases as its continued relevance propagate throughout the news
information system. As such, NID behavior of the news information flow is a signature of
catastrophes. At the level of methodology, this paper has illustrated how NID behavior of
legacy media can be identified using non-linear adaptive filtering and windowed linear fits for
resonance and novelty, and function provide input for change point detection algorithms.
There are multiple research paths that could contribute further to our understanding of NID.
First, the predictive value of NID should be validated in terms of crisis management; second
evaluation of NID’s event scope is necessary, for instance, does NID only apply to a small
set of negative events or does it generalize to a substantially larger set of significant events
(e.g., moon landing, fall of the Berlin wall); third, comparisons of information micro-behavior
as a function of newspaper values, for instance, left vs. right-wing newspapers or tabloid vs.
broadsheet newspapers; and finally, multilingual validation of NID.

A. Methods
Data and Normalization
The data set consists of all linguistic content (title and body text) from front pages of four
Danish national newspapers Politiken, Berlingske, Information and Ekstrabladet. The newspapers were sampled during December 1, 2019 to June 1 2020. Content not produced by the
newspaper, e.g., advertisements, was excluded from the sample. In order to normalize linguistic content, numerals and highly frequent function words were removed, and the remaining
data were lemmatized and casefolded. Subsequently, the data were represented as a bag-ofwords (BoW) model using latent Dirichlet allocation in order to generate a dense low-rank
representation of each article. Note that with a few modifications to equations (4) and (5), the
approach works for any probabilistic or geometric vector-representation of documents. Novelty
and resonance were estimated for in windows of one week (w = 7).

Novelty and Resonance
Two related information signals were extracted from the temporally sorted BoW model: Novelty as an article s(j) ’s reliable difference from past articles s(j−1) , s(j−2) , . . . , s(j−w) in window
w:

Nw (j) =

and resonance as the degree to which future articles s(j+1) , s(j+2) , . . . , s(j+w) conforms to
article s(j) ’s novelty:

where T is the transience of s(j) :

Nonlinear Adaptive Filtering
To model global trends in the novelty and resonance signals, we apply a nonlinear adaptive
multi-scale decomposition algorithm [16]. First, the signal is partitioned into overlapping
segments of length w = 2n + 1, where neighboring segments overlap by n + 1 points. In
each segment, the signal is fitted with the best polynomial of order M , obtained by using
the standard least-squares regression; the fitted polynomials in overlapped regions are then
combined to yield a single global smooth trend. Denoting the fitted polynomials for the i − th
and (i + 1) − th segments by y i (l1 ) and y (i+1) (l2 ), respectively, where l1 , l2 = 1, · · · , 2n + 1, we
define the fitting for the overlapped region as
y (c) (l) = w1 y (i) (l + n) + w2 y (i+1) (l), l = 1, 2, · · · , n + 1
(6)
(︁
)︁
and w2 = l−1
where w1 = 1 − l−1
n
n can be written as (1 − dj /n) for j = 1, 2, and where dj
denotes the distances between the point and the centers of y (i) and y (i+1) , respectively. Note
that the weights decrease linearly with the distance between the point and the center of the
segment. Such a weighting is used to ensure symmetry and effectively eliminate any jumps or
discontinuities around the boundaries of neighboring segments. As a result, the global trend
is smooth at the non-boundary points, and has the right and left derivatives at the boundary
[17].
The global trend thus determined can be used to maximally suppress the effect of complex
nonlinear trends on the scaling analysis. The parameters of each local fit is determined by
maximizing the goodness of fit in each segment. The different polynomials in overlapped
part of each segment are combined using Equation 6 so that the global fit will be the best
(smoothest) fit of the overall time series. Note that, even if M = 1 is selected, i.e., the local
fits are linear, the global trend signal will still be nonlinear.
Finally, in order to describe the information states before and after an events (e.g., Lockdown,
Opening), we fit resonance on novelty to estimate the N × R slope β1 in the specific time
windows:
Ri = β0 + β1 Ni + ϵi , i = 1, . . . , n.
