Abstract
The lead-lag relationship plays a vital role in financial markets. It is the phenomenon where a
certain price-series lags behind and partially replicates the movement of leading time-series.
The present research proposes a new technique which helps better identify the lead-lag
relationship empirically. Apart from better identifying the lead-lag path, the technique also
gives a measure for adjudging closeness between financial time-series. Also, the proposed
measure is closely related to correlation, and it uses Dynamic Programming technique for
finding the optimal lead-lag path. Further, it retains most of the properties of a metric, so
much so, it is termed as ‘loose metric’. Tests are performed on Synthetic Time Series (STS)
with known lead-lag relationship and comparisons are done with other state-of-the-art models
on the basis of significance and forecastability. The proposed technique gives the best results
in both the tests. It finds paths which are all statistically significant, and its forecasts are
closest to the target values. Then, we use the measure to study the topology evolution of the
Foreign Exchange market, as the COVID-19 pandemic unfolds. Here, we study the FX
currency prices of 29 prominent countries of the world. It is observed that as the crises
unfold, all the currencies become strongly interlinked to each other. Also, USA Dollar starts
playing even more central role in the FX market. Finally, we mention several other
application areas of the proposed technique for designing intelligent systems.

1. Introduction
Information plays a critical role in our lives, specifically in financial markets. In financial
markets, any accurate information regarding future trends is very financially rewarding. It is
sometimes observed that some stock pairs may not have high Pearson correlation coefficient
between them, but they are highly correlated at certain lead-lag. Also, it is found that prices
of certain financial commodities are following the trends of some other commodity. This
phenomenon where a certain time-series replicates the movements of a leading time-series
partially at a specific time lag is called lead-lag relationship [1]. The present paper proposes
an empirical technique which better identifies the time-varying lead-lag relationship between
two time-series.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We first give a broad literature review of the
lead-lag relationship. Then, we describe the proposed methodology to determine the lead-lag
relationship. Then we test this technique to find a known lead-lag relationship in synthetic

time-series empirically. Finally, we use this methodology to decipher existing patterns or
connections between financial time-series in the FX market.

2. Literature Review
It may seem intuitive that any information like a lead-lag relationship which can be
utilized for trend discovery should be immediately utilized for making financially profitable
transactions. This is not always the case due to factors like delay in information transmission
or information arrival. This phenomenon is most phenomenally visible in the time-series of
spot and options prices of the same underlying stock or commodity. Here sometimes, it is
observed that the options-price series leads the spot-price series [2], which maybe because it
is faster to quickly assimilate any new information regarding the future trend into the option
price-series as compared to spot price-series. The lead-lag relationship can also be observed
in the spot and futures prices of a commodity. The lead-lag relationship in KOSPI200 spot
market, its futures market, and its options market are empirically examined and commented
upon in the study done by Lee et al. [2]. Tian et al. [3] investigate Taiwan financial markets
and find that index-future-prices during non-cash trading-period leads the cash-market during
its opening-period. Moews et al. [4] develop an intelligent system to better predict future
movements in financial time-series using lagged-correlations with other time-series. Hui et al.
[5] find the existence of a time-dependent lead-lag relationship between prices and volume in
mini Taiwan exchange futures.
The phenomenon of lead-lag relationship is also observed in the price-series of a commodity
being traded at different exchanges. Here, High-Frequency-Trading (HFT) is performed by
traders to quickly dissipate any price inconsistencies between two exchanges, while earning
huge profits through it. High-Frequency Data in the financial market is gathered at irregular
intervals, which makes it challenging to decipher the lead-lag relationship between two
different stocks or markets. Thus, an estimator is proposed in [6], which better estimated the
cross-covariance by avoiding imputation and using all available transaction. In the study
conducted by Robert et al. [7], certain properties of the covariance matrix of increments of
two Gaussian processes, partially correlated at some time –lag, is studied.

It may not always be possible to utilize lead-lag information profitably. Still, a lead-lag
relationship between two time-series may be indicative of casualty or strong-connection
between the two time-series.

Thermal Optimal Path (TOP), first proposed by Zhou and Sornette[8], has been used in the
past for obtaining a continuously time-varying lead-lag path between two financial
instruments. [8]–[11] are some of the papers which utilise TOP in their analysis of the
financial markets. The TOP method has been picked up from physics literature, and it uses
Euclidean distance for comparison at the most basic or micro-level. The present measure uses
correlation-based distance at micro-level. Correlation distance is more suitable for financial
data as it may indicate causality between the two time-series. Further, TOP does not
explicitly provide any measure to quantify the strength of the relationship between the two
financial time-series.
Another distance measure of significance for any general time-series data is the Dynamic
Time Warping (DTW) measure [12], [13]. DTW is generally considered as the best distance
measure for time series mining tasks across virtually all domains [14]. DTW measure is
especially of advantage in speech recognition [15] where it can decipher the sounds of
different words, even when different parts of the word have different elongations. Jin et al.
[10] used DTW measure to analyse the network structure of the Foreign Exchange market.
Zhu et al. [16] tried to reduce the time complexity of the DTW measure by approximating its
value. In work by Silva et al. [14] the effects of relaxing various constraints on the DTW
distance measures are studied.
TOP has been one of the most prominent methodologies for empirically finding the lead-lag
path. The present methodology shows superior results than TOP. TOP may be considered as a
more theoretically evolved version of DTW, as it also uses Dynamic Programming for
computation purposes.
The present methodology also improves upon DTW by subtly combining the properties of
DTW measure and correlation measure. The proposed Aligned Correlation (AC) can more
accurately determine the lead-lag relationship between time-series.

3. Proposed Measure
Empirically determination of the best lead-lag path (exact solution) between two time-series
requires exponential order of time, as explained in the next section. This is an NP-Hard
problem, and Dynamic Programming (DP) is used to obtain an approximate solution in much
lesser time. DP is generally used for solving other NP-Hard problems also [17].
The present AC measure takes motivation from the DCCT measure, described in [18]. The
AC measure does not require to choose between one of the values of a free parameter ‘p’, as
required in the DCCT measure. Further, the present work provides an in-depth theoretical
discussion on the metric properties of the AC measure. It also provides more elaborate testing
and comparisons, as compared to the work [18]. Though the DCCT measure is used for
profitable pairs trading, the AC measure has been used to study the Foreign Exchange
market.
Now, we describe the proposed AC measure in detail. Let xt , yt ( t ∈ 1,2,…,n) be two timeseries of normalised prices of two stocks. Then the AC’s computation requires the use of an
alignment path.
Alignment path is a sequence P = (P1 , P2, …Pl… , PL) with Pl = (pl , ql) ∈ [1: 𝑛]2 for 𝑙 ∈
[1: 𝐿] satisfying the following conditions:
(i)

Boundary Condition: Given a parameter psi, (say 100), then 𝑝1 ≤ 𝑝𝑠𝑖 ,

𝑞1 ≤

𝑝𝑠𝑖, 𝑝𝐿 ≥ 𝑛 − 𝑝𝑠𝑖 and 𝑞𝐿 ≥ 𝑛 − 𝑝𝑠𝑖 .
(ii)

Monotonicity Condition: 𝑝1 ≤ 𝑝2 ≤ ⋯ ≤ 𝑝𝐿 and 𝑞1 ≤ 𝑞2 ≤ ⋯ ≤ 𝑞𝐿 .

(iii)

Step size Condition: 𝑃𝑙+1 − 𝑃𝑙 ∈ {(1,0), (0,1), (1,1)} for 𝑙 ∈ [1: 𝐿 − 1].

The parameter name ‘psi’ (which stands for ‘Post Suffix Invariant’), has been inspired by
[14] where they introduced this parameter to relax the boundary condition in DTW. The
alignment path is computed using ‘Dynamic programming’ techniques as done in DTW
measure [14].
The AC measure uses the above definition in its construction. Let us denote the computation
of the alignment path by step 1.

Step 1: Computation of Alignment path
As mentioned earlier, let xt , yt ( t ∈ 1,2,…,n) be two time-series of normalised prices of two
stocks. Let rxt , ryt ( t ∈ 1,2,…,n) denote the consequent return time-series.
Let 𝐶𝑅(𝑝𝑖 , 𝑞𝑖 , 𝑝), a function over the sequence Pl = (pl ,ql), be defined as follows:
𝑟𝑥𝑝𝑗 = 𝑥𝑝𝑗+1 − 𝑥𝑝𝑗
𝑟𝑦𝑞𝑗 = 𝑦𝑞𝑗+1 − 𝑦𝑞𝑗
𝑝

∑𝑗=−𝑝(𝑟𝑥𝑝 +𝑗 )(𝑟𝑦𝑞 +𝑗 )
𝑖
𝑖

𝐶𝑅(𝑝𝑖 , 𝑞𝑖 , 𝑝) = 2 × (1 −

𝑝

𝑝

√∑𝑗=−𝑝(𝑟𝑥𝑝𝑖 +𝑗 )2 √∑𝑗=−𝑝(𝑟𝑦𝑞𝑖 +𝑗 )2

),

Here, ‘p’ is the window size parameter, which denotes the length of the window. The time𝑝

series are appended with ⌊2⌋ zeroes at both the ends, so that the above expression can be
calculated. In the present research, we use three values of parameter ‘p’ i.e., 25, 51 and 101.
Then, we find an alignment path P = (P1, P2, …Pl… , PL) which minimises the function
∑𝐿𝑖=1 𝐶𝑅(𝑝𝑖 , 𝑞𝑖 , 𝑝) given the path-constraints as mentioned earlier. This is done through
Dynamic Programming techniques as used in DTW measure. This optimization is done in
two steps:
1) First, the optimal paths are calculated for each value of the parameter p ( i.e., 25, 51
and 101), which is given by:
𝐿

PATH(p) = arg − min ∑ 𝐶𝑅(𝑝𝑖 , 𝑞𝑖 , 𝑝)
(𝑝𝑖 ,𝑞𝑖 ), 𝑖=1…𝐿

𝑖=1

This is achieved by the DTW algorithm where Euclidean distance is replaced by CR metric,
which is also the Euclidean distance between two normalized vectors.
2) Then among these paths, we finally pick the path P = {(𝑝𝑖 , 𝑞𝑖 ), 𝑖 = 1 … 𝐿}, which
minimises the following expression:

2× 1−

∑𝐿𝑖=1(𝑟𝑥𝑝𝑖 )(𝑟𝑦𝑞𝑖 )
2

(

2

√∑𝐿𝑖=1(𝑟𝑥𝑝𝑖 ) √∑𝐿𝑖=1(𝑟𝑦𝑞𝑖 )
)

Step 2: Computation of AC measure
Finally, the AC measure is the correlation-distance along the alignment path, which is
calculated as follows:

AC =

𝑃𝑎𝑡ℎ 𝑃 √ 2 × 1 −

(𝑝𝑖 ,𝑞𝑖 ), 𝑖=1…𝐿

(

∑𝐿𝑖=1(𝑟𝑥𝑝𝑖 )(𝑟𝑦𝑞𝑖 )

,

2
2
√∑𝐿𝑖=1(𝑟𝑥𝑝𝑖 ) √∑𝐿𝑖=1(𝑟𝑦𝑞𝑖 )
)

where, P is the chosen alignment path (pi, qi).
In the present experiments, the parameter ‘psi’ has been kept equal to the parameter ‘p’ just
for simplicity.
Here √2(1 − 𝜌) has been chosen as it transforms correlation measure (𝜌) into Euclidean
distance metric between two time-series with unit variance and zero-mean.

4. Elaboration of the AC measure
Francisco et al. [19] showed through their work that, in statistical significance, DTW measure
satisfies the Triangular Inequality (TI). They reached this conclusion by testing over 15
million triplets for TI, which arose from speech data of 800 time-series. AC measure can also
be termed as a ‘loose metric’ as done in [19]. This is because the AC measure is same as the
Euclidean distance between normalized time-series along the wrapping path, i.e., DTW
measure. Here, the normalizing variance is slightly different from the variance of the original
time-series. The slight difference is due to repetition and rare removal of a few terms in the
whole time-series. In fact, the AC measure is not equal to the Euclidean metric only because
of different alignment of the series along the time. The path obtained here is a valid wrapping
path from start to end. It is not the absolute optimal path which minimizes E.D., but it
additionally maximises correlation along the path. Many modifications of DTW measure
have proposed to put additional constraints on the DTW measure. This measure may also be
considered as a measure which puts some additional constraints over DTW measure.

4.1 Construction details of the AC measure
It is crucial that CR should be a metric. If we replace it with another measure, we need to
make sure that it is a metric. Also, we cannot compare the final ∑𝐿𝑖=1 𝐶𝑅(𝑝𝑖 , 𝑞𝑖 , 𝑝) values for

different parameter ‘p’ values. This value ∑𝐿𝑖=1 𝐶𝑅(𝑝𝑖 , 𝑞𝑖 , 𝑝) can be re-arranged to denote the
sum of squares of differences between certain normalized segments of the two time-series.
This expression is dependent on the parameter ‘p’, and it can not be used for comparison
across different ‘p’ values. Thus, instead, we minimize the correlation metric over the aligned
path.

4.2 Time Complexity
The number of feasible paths grows exponentially with the length of the time-series. The
number of feasible paths can be bijectively mapped to the number of paths from top left to
bottom right corner in a grid where only right and bottom moves are allowed. The number of
such paths is (2𝑛
) which is greater than 2𝑛 . Thus, it requires an exponential order of time to
𝑛
find the exact solution. Here, DP can be used to find an approximate solution quickly.
The proposed AC measure has the same order of time complexity as the DTW measure when
seen in terms of the length of the time series. Though, the AC measure has a higher constant
term, which increases with the increase in the number of window-sizes (parameter ‘p’) used
for finding the alignment path.

5. Synthetic Time-Series Experiments
Zhou and Sornette [8] while first introducing Thermal Optimal Path (TOP) [8] method for
application in economics, justified its usage with two comparative experiments on synthetic
time series data. Here, we will do very similar experiments to determine the superiority of the
AC measure path over other models. Another experiment to test self-consistency of TOP
results has been conducted earlier several times, like in [9]–[11]. This test will also be
performed to determine the validity of the proposed AC technique.
Suppose we have a synthetic time series with a time-varying lead-lag relationship. Then these
methods should be able to detect this path, even in the presence of noise experimentally. This
experiment is based on the experiments in [8].
In general, the synthetic time-series are of the form:
𝑌(𝑡1 ) = 𝑎𝑋(𝑡1 − 𝑥(𝑡1 )) + 𝜂,
where 𝑋(𝑡1 ) is generated through the following process:

𝑋(𝑡2 ) = 𝑏𝑋(𝑡2 − 1) + 𝜉,
here, the noise-terms 𝜂 and 𝜉 will be explained shortly. Now, given the two time-series
𝑌(𝑡1 ) & 𝑋(𝑡2 ) for some finite length, our aim is to empirically determine the lead-lag
structure, i.e., 𝑥(𝑡1 ).
In the present experiments, we use four different synthetic time series (STS) in two different
sets of experiments.

5.1 Significance Test
We use STS-1 and STS-2 for testing the significance of lead-lag paths obtained through
different algorithms. This test has been earlier employed in [9]–[11], for testing the
significance of TOP. The underlying logic of this test is that, if the lead-lag path (x(t)) is
significant, then these two synchronized time series, i.e., X(t – x(t)) and Y(t) should exhibit a
strong linear dependence. It leads to the following regression.
𝑌(𝑡) = 𝑐 + 𝑎𝑋(𝑡 − 〈𝑥(𝑡)〉) + 𝜀(𝑡),
In the above equation, the coefficient ‘a’ should be significantly different from ‘zero’ for
statistically significant dependence. Next we give detail of STS-1.
Synthetic Time Series 1
The STS-1 is as follows:
0.8 𝑋(𝑖) + 𝜂,
0.8𝑋(𝑖 − 5) + 𝜂,
0.8𝑋(𝑖 − 10) + 𝜂,
𝑌(𝑖) =
0.8𝑋(𝑖 + 10) + 𝜂,
0.8𝑋(𝑖 + 5) + 𝜂,
{0.8 𝑋(𝑖) + 𝜂,

1 ⩽ 𝑖 ⩽ 50,
50 ⩽ 𝑖 ⩽ 100,
101 ⩽ 𝑖 ⩽ 150,
151 ⩽ 𝑖 ⩽ 200,
201 ⩽ 𝑖 ⩽ 250,
251 ⩽ 𝑖 ⩽ 300,

where X(t) is itself a stochastic process given by:
𝑋(𝑡1 ) = 𝑏𝑋(𝑡1 − 1) + 𝜉,
where b < 1 and the noise ξ ∼ N(0, σξ) is serially uncorrelated. The factor f = ση/σξ quantifies
the amount of noise degrading the causal relationship between X(t1) and Y(t2). A small f
corresponds to a strong causal relationship. A large f implies that Y(t2) is mostly noise and
becomes unrelated to X(t1) in the limit f → ∞. Specifically,
Var[𝑋] = 𝜎𝜉2 ⁄(1 − 𝑏 2 )

and
2

Var[𝑌] = 𝑎 Var[𝑋] +

𝜎𝜂2

𝜎𝜉2 (

2
𝑎2
2 𝑎 Var[𝑋]
2
+ 𝑓 ) = 𝜎𝜉 (
+ 𝑓 2 ).
1 − 𝑏2
𝜎𝜉2

All the STS are similar processes with different parameter values.
In our simulations, we generate X and Y of first STS with parameters a = 0.8, b = 0.7, and f =
0.5.
TOP has a free variable ‘Temperature’ which needs to be fixed before finding the path. In
work by [11], it is proposed that the temperature value of 2 is generally optimal, and this
finding is asserted again in [20]. Here we perform the experiments with the temperature
values of 2, 1, 0.5 and 0.2. In the case of AC measure, we use with the following 3 values of
parameter ‘p’: 25, 51 and 101, as described earlier.

Figure-1 The Lead-lag Paths: The empirically determined path x(t) against actual
theoretical path by different techniques on STS-1. The path obtained by the AC method is
visually more closer to the actual path than other models.

As seen in Figure 1, the AC method is able to perfectly identify the lead-lag structure (x(t))
during the periods when (x(t)) remains temporarily unchanged. It only sometimes fails to
capture the path during periods of transitions or jumps. Whereas TOP shows poor
performance than AC during both the periods of transitions or no-transitions of x(t). DTW
measure has shown visibly better performance than TOP but poor performance than AC. The
same phenomenon is observed in Figures 2,3 and 4.
Next is the examination of the empirically obtained lead-lag structure on the basis of the selfconsistency test. We perform this test analogously, as described in [11]. We implement this
test in moving windows of size 100, which move forward one-time-step from beginning to
end of the time series. Thus, we obtain (300 – 100 + 1) such windows over the time series of
length 300. Within each window, the two-time-series are synchronized (or not synchronized
in the case of ‘Unsynched Path’), for estimating the significance of the coefficient ‘a’. Table
1 gives the results for this experiment. Here, we observe that among the 201 windows with
AC-synchronised time-series, all 201 windows have statistically significant coefficient ‘a’, at
a confidence level of 97.5%. In contrast, for 201 overlapping non-synchronised windows,
there are only 61 windows that pass the significant test. When, we observe the mean value of
‘a’ among windows, where it has a statistically significant non-zero value, we find that the
AC’s values are close to the actual ‘a’ values of 0.8, with smaller standard deviation. This
indicates the superiority of the AC path over other measures. The model ‘Actual Path’
denotes the hypothetical model which finds the correct lead-lag path as designed in the STS.
Again, we repeat this experiment on STS-2 and again find that AC has given the best results
as seen in Table 2.

5.2 Forecastability Test
Next, we do experiments as done in [8], to test the forecastability of the lead-lag structure.
Here, we consider the synthetic time series where X(t) leads Y(t) in general, and thus values
of X(t) can be used for predicting future values of Y(t). We use STS-3 and STS-4 for this test.
This test examines the ability to obtain correct forecasts through the lead-lag path found by
different algorithms empirically. Next, we give details of the STS used in this test.
Synthetic Time Series 3
The STS-3 is as follows:

0.8 𝑋(𝑖) + 𝜂,
0.8𝑋(𝑖 − 5) + 𝜂,
0.8𝑋(𝑖 − 10) + 𝜂,
𝑌(𝑖) =

251 ⩽ 𝑖 ⩽ 300,

where X(t) and 𝜉 are as described earlier.
𝑋(𝑡1 ) = 𝑏𝑋(𝑡1 − 1) + 𝜉,
we generate X and Y of size 300 with parameters a = 0.8, b = 0.7, and f = 0.5.
We use the present values of X(t) to forecast the future values of Y(t). That is, at each time
instance ‘i’, we perform a prediction of Y(i+1), at the time ‘i+1’, which is unknown at the
time ‘i’. We first calculate the instantaneous lead-lag time τ(i) = max{[x(i)], 0} using the
lead-lag structure x(i) determined using any of the methods. Here the operator [.], represents
the integral part of the number. Now, we obtain the prediction for Y(i+1) as
𝑌̂(𝑖 + 1) = 0.8𝑋(𝑖 + 1 − 𝜏(𝑖))
In this prediction set-up, we assume that we know the underlying model and the only
challenge is to calibrate the lag.
The predicted values 𝑌̂(𝑖 + 1) are compared to actual values Y(i+1), using Mean Absolute
Deviation (MAD) error. MAD is indicative of the maximum loss that will be obtained by
financially ‘betting’ on the predicted 𝑌̂(𝑖 + 1) values.

Table 4: MAD error of the predicted values for different models on STS 4.

Table 3 and 4 give the MAD error of the predictions 𝑌̂(𝑖 + 1) against actual values Y(i+1) for
the different models. We observe that in general, the performance of the AC method is the
best except the hypothetical ‘Actual Path’ model. Thus, though TOP gives better results than
a classic-correlation approach, as described in [8], but it performs poorly when compared
with the AC approach. Also, DTW measure shows poor performance when compared with
AC measure.

6. Network-evolution in Foreign Exchange
The present section uses the AC measure to analyse the network evolution of foreign
exchange currency as the COVID-19 outbreak unfolds.
Recently, several speculations have been raised regarding the status of the USA dollar (USD)
as the world’s reserve currency. USD is soon losing its dominance as the world’s reserve
currency. Many experts are of the view that USD may be replaced by a bucket comprising of
RUB, CNY, EUR, oil-backed OPEC currencies etc. Also, due to the recent outbreak of
COVID-19 in China, which has first and foremost severely affected the Chinese Stock
market, one is tempted to study the topology of correlation networks among major currencies
and topology evolution of Foreign Exchange (FX) market.

Topology network analysis through Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) was first introduced in
[21], to study the stock prices in financial markets. Jang et al. [22] used topology network
analysis to efficiently illustrate the structural and market properties of the financial market.
This tool has also been used for financial markets of different regions of the world [23]–[26].
The topology network analysis of the FX market is done in [27], where FX prices of 28
currencies for a period of 12 years from 1990-2002 is analysed. They conclude that USD is
the most leading currency in the world. Naylor et al. [28], also used this tool in the FX market
and used NZD and USD as numeraries. They found that South-East Asian currencies strongly
grouped together during the South-East Asian crisis period. In most of the past such analysis
of network evolution, the correlation has been chosen as the preferred metric.
Jin et al. [13] used DTW-measure for doing such analysis of foreign exchange data. DTW
measure aligns the two time-series along time, so it can also be used in cases where the two
time-series are not of the same length. Also, it is costly and difficult to obtain foreign
exchange currency prices of many countries for a long duration, due to different operating
hours of exchanges in different countries. DTW measure can be used even if the time-series
contain several missing values, without any further data pre-processing step to remove or
approximate the missing values. Thus, the DTW measure provides a good alternative to
correlation measure as well-argued in [13]. The proposed AC measure also has all these
advantages over correlation measure. Further, the AC measure is able to better incorporate
the lead-lag relationship effect into its value than DTW measure. It chooses the path along
which the correlation is maximum while incorporating any information regarding the lead-lag
relationship. As described in [29], [30], the lead-lag relationship may be existing in the
foreign exchange market too, so its effect should not be ignored entirely. The proposed AC
measure, as we shall see later in the discussion section, mostly chooses the zero-lag path for
most of the major currencies, and any deviation is very small. Thus, the proposed AC
measure maintains the interpretability of correlation measure while incorporating the effect of
any lead-lag relationship.

6.1 Data Description
The data consists of foreign exchange currency prices of 29 prominent countries of the world
against NZD (see Table 5). The data was sourced from Thomson Reuters Eikon platform. We
choose NZD as the numeraire as it was preferred in [13], [28].

Table 5: 29 prominent currencies used in the analysis of FX market.

The data which is at a frequency of 10-minute, starts at (17-12-2019 16:50) and ends at (1603-2020 21:00). The time-points which had missing values for any of the currency were
dropped from the whole data-set. This data-set can be divided into two parts based on the onset of the effect of the covid-19 pandemic on the Chinese stock market. The date 03-02-2020
marks the start of the second data-set as on this date, Chinese stocks prices fell drastically,
which lead to wiping off around 400 billion USD from the Chinese stock market. Thus, the
first part of the data is from (17-12-2019 16:50) to (23-01-2020 21:10), while the second part
of the data-set is from (03-02-2020 16:40) to (16-03-2020 21:00).

6.2 Methodology
The AC measure has been used for constructing the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST). MST
requires the distance measure to be a metric, i.e.; it should satisfy the triangular inequality. As
discussed earlier, the proposed AC is a loose-metric. The alignment path in the proposed
measure causes the final distance measure to be slightly different from the Euclidean metric
(see Section 4 ), which is not generally sufficient enough to violate the triangular inequality.
The triangular inequality is more likely to be violated if all the three points lie near to a
straight line. This is highly unlikely as the time-series are very high-dimensional points, and
further, they have been normalized to lie on the unit circle, during the calculation of the
loose-metric. Further, empirically we verify that all the triplets in the two distance matrices,
corresponding to two parts of the data, satisfy the triangular inequality. Hence, as done
similarly earlier [13], MST based network approach can still be used for the analysis.

6.3 Evaluation Criteria
Here, we describe the measures used for evaluating the MST, to study the FX market. We
will be using four measures which are as follows.
1) Mean dissimilarity measure
It is defined as
𝑁−1

𝐿MDM

2
=
∑
𝑁(𝑁 − 1)

𝑁

∑ 𝐷𝑖𝑗 ,

𝑖=1 𝑗=𝑖+1

where D is the NxN dissimilarity matrix, and N is the total number of currencies i.e., 29.
The present paper calls the proposed AC measure as a dissimilarity measure as opposed
to the term similarity measure (see [13]) as it increases with the increase in
farness/dissimilarity between the two objects.

2) Normalised Tree Length
It is given by

𝐿NTL =

1
∑ 𝐷𝑖𝑗 ,
𝑁−1
𝐷𝑖𝑗 ∈𝛩

where 𝛩 is the set of edges and it contains the edges present in the MST.
This measure has also been used in [22], to evaluate the MST.

3) Characterised Path Length
It is given by
𝐿CPL =

1
∑ 𝑙𝑖𝑗 ,
𝑁(𝑁 − 1)
𝑖,𝑗:𝑖≠𝑗

where 𝑙𝑖𝑗 is the sum of the weights in the shortest path from node i to node j.
This measure gives the average minimum path distance between any two nodes in the
MST [31].

4) Non-Leaf Nodes
It is defined as the number of non-leaf nodes present in the graph. This measure helps
to judge the loose degree of MST.

6.4 Results
Figure-5 Network 1 corresponding to data-set 1: The topological network of FX market
during the pre-crisis period:

Figure-6 Network-2 corresponding to data-set 2: The topological network of FX market
during the crisis period:

Figures 5 and 6 show the topological network of the FX market during the pre-crisis and the
crisis period, respectively. In network 1, three clusters can be seen. The cluster centred
around USD is the most prominent one. Another smaller cluster can be seen around the
Singapore Dollar (SGD). SGD is closely linked with USD and is also attached to other major
currencies like EUR, CNY, RUB, and INR. This point towards the importance of SGD. In
earlier studies too [13], SGD has been pointed to be one of the central currencies in the
world’s FX market. The third cluster is centred around Indian Rupee (INR). The cluster
contains regional Asian currencies like INR, PKR and TRY. The third cluster points towards
the emergence of INR as another currency of regional importance. India is one of the fastestgrowing major economies in the world. The democratic regime in India has been slowly but
steadily liberalizing the economy, which has eased the free flow of goods and services in the
region.
As the COVID-19 economic crises began unfolding in China, we see that USD again takes
the central role in the FX currencies network of the world. The major currencies like CNY
and INR, which were earlier linked to USD through SGD, now attach themselves directly to
USD. A tiny cluster can be seen centred around Swiss Franc (CHF) consisting of major
currencies like Euro (EUR), Japanese Yen (JPY) and Australian Dollar (AUD). CHF and
EUR remain closely linked in both the networks.

As observed earlier too [13], the mean dissimilarity measure decreases during the crisis (see
Table 6). Essentially the same phenomenon is captured by the two other measures, i.e., NTL
and CPL. This denotes that during the crises period, all currencies come closer and start
fluctuating synchronously. That is, the movements in the leading currencies are quickly
transferred to all the rest of the currencies.

Table 7(b)
Table-7(a)(b) Numerical Results: Table 7(a) abd 7(b) give certain numerical values
corresponding to topological networks of data 1 and data 2, respectively. ‘Align-Corr Loose
Metric’ gives the value of Aligned correlation loose metric or the aligned correlation
measure. Aligned correlation gives the correlation along the aligned path. This value can be
similarly interpreted as we interpret the correlation measure. Notice that its value is always
greater than the value of correlation measure, as was designed in the proposed technique.
‘Average Lead/lag’ is the average value of lead-lag along the aligned path. ‘Non-zero ratio’ is
the ratio of points along the lead-lag path which are different from zero to the total points of
the lead-lag path.

As seen in Table 7, the optimal lead-lag path is mostly equal to zero. This is clearly observed
in pairs with the lowest distance measure. The lead-lag path sometimes deviates from zero,
but the deviations are minor and very rare. In the last few pairs, though the lead-lag path is
different from zero, but the correlation values are close to zero. This supports the previous
study [30] that it is hard for any significant lead-lag relationship to exist at a frequency of 1
minute or lower in FX markets. But still, the proposed measure takes care of minor
corrections, which may have inadvertently arisen into the market prices due to reasons like
delay in information-transmission or human-errors.

7. Discussion
There exist several studies that can be used for further extending the analysis of correlationbased topological networks. These studies try to overcome the drawback of MST, i.e., loss of
information. These studies include [32]–[35], which create graphs which retain more
information in them than MST. Since all these techniques employ correlation coefficient, thus
there is a possibility of extending the present research in the direction of these techniques.
Other possible areas, where this research may be useful is in the analysis of tick by tick data
like in [36]. Tick by tick data needs to be aligned in time, which is done by the proposed
measure. Specifically, in the FX market, where there is a vast difference in the liquidity and
volumes of different currencies, this time alignment becomes very important. Also, the leadlag relationship exists substantially in tick-by-tick data. Thus, it will be interesting to see how
this research extends on tick-by-tick data.
The proposed technique can also be used in the analysis of the lead-lag relationship of certain
other important time-series like done in [10], [11], [20]. The proposed technique, which helps
identify the lead-lag relationship, may be extended to help in profitable pairs-trading like
successfully accomplished in [37], [38]. It can be used for improving systems which use leadlag information to achieve better forecasts like [39], [40].
DP is a good tool to solve computationally demanding problems [17]. DP based algorithms
are embedded in the chips of computers for computation purposes [41]. Thus, much effort has
been put in to reduce the time-complexity of this algorithm further, and now an algorithm is

available, which can crudely approximate DTW measure in linear time [42]. The present
research can be extended to incorporate these studies.

8. Conclusion
DTW and correlation are two of the most frequently used measures in Temporal data-mining
literature, and the proposed measure combines them effectively to achieve better taskoriented results. The proposed technique better identifies the lead-lag relationship existing
between two time-series. The technique is compared to other models on synthetic time-series
data, based on significance and forecast-ability. In terms of significance, the AC measure
always finds a statistically-significant path in all the synthetic time-series. In terms of
forecast-ability, the forecasts obtained through the proposed technique are closest to the
target values. Then we use this technique to explore the topology evolution of 29 prominent
FX currencies, as the COVID-19 epidemic unfolds itself. It is observed that after the
beginning of the pandemic, USA Dollar assumes a more central position in the world FX
market. All the currencies become more closely inter-linked on an average during the crisis
period.
