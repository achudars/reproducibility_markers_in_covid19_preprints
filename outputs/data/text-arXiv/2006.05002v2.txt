Abstract
Quarantine measure is a commonly used non-pharmaceutical intervention during the outbreak of infectious diseases. A key problem for implementing quarantine measure is to determine the duration of quarantine. Different from the existing methods that determine a
constant quarantine duration for everyone, we develop an individualized quarantine rule that
suggests different quarantine durations for individuals with different characteristics. The
proposed quarantine rule is optimal in the sense that it minimizes the average quarantine
duration of uninfected people with the constraint that the probability of symptom presentation for infected people attains the given value closing to 1. The optimal solution for the
quarantine duration is obtained and estimated by some statistical methods with application
to analyzing COVID-19 data.

introduction

During the outbreak of infectious diseases (e.g. EVD, SARS, MERS and COVID-19), quarantine measures are commonly implemented to limit disease transmission and morbidity. Extensive
research has shown that quarantine is important in reducing the number of people infected and
the number of deaths [Lipsitch et al., 2003, Ferguson et al., 2006], especially when there is no
effective treatment for the disease, see Nussbaumer-Streit et al. [2020] for a recent review. To
establish a quarantine strategy, some studies use epidemic models such as SEIR type model to
determine the optimal time-varying quarantine rate by optimal control theory, see for instance
Behncke [2000], Yan and Zou [2008], Ahmad et al. [2016]. Lipsitch et al. [2003] discussed the
relationship between the quarantine fraction of each infectious cases contacts and the number of
person-days in quarantine. However, a key problem when imposing the quarantine measure is to
determine the quarantine duration. An extremely long quarantine duration makes sure that most
infected individuals would exhibit symptom under quarantine and then get further quarantine and
medical treatment. That is, a long quarantine duration can stop virus from spreading to others.
Nevertheless, this may inconvenience uninfected individuals, incur many extra financial and social
costs and even affect economic development [Reich et al., 2018]. Hence a good quarantine measure
should balance effectiveness and cost of the quarantine measure and have a proper duration.
Farewell et al. [2005] proposed to determine the quarantine duration based on the distribution of incubation period. Nishiura [2009] analyzed the apporpriate quarantine period using the
quantiles of the incubation period distribution. The existing methods do not consider the characteristics of quarantined individuals and suggest the same quarantine duration for every individual.
Nevertheless, different people may have different probability of being infected and different incubation period of a disease. Indeed, the probability of being infected for every individual is unknown.
However, some individual characteristics such as age, sex, infection rate in the region from which
the individual comes and whether an individual is a close contact, which may affect the incubation
2

period distribution or the infected probability, can be observed. Thus to guarantee the effectiveness and minimize the cost of the quarantine measure, one may intend to set a proper quarantine
duration for each potentially exposed individual based on his or her characteristics. To the best
of our knowledge, no literature addresses this issue.
In this paper, we consider the problem and develop an optimal quarantine rule. The proposed
quarantine rule implements different quarantine duration for different individual depending on his
or her characteristics. We make the rule optimal by minimizing the average quarantine duration
of uninfected people with the constraint that the probability of symptom presentation for infected
people attains any given value, which may be close to 1. We obtain the optimal solution for
the problem and estimate the optimal solution by some statistical methods. Coronavirus disease
COVID-19 pandemic is known to become a global health crisis since its emergence in Asia late
last year. Considerable attention has paid to studying the optimal prevent and control strategy
of COVID-19 and various public health measures such as testing, social distancing, lockdown and
quarantine in a macro prespective [Piguillem and Shi, 2020, Charpentier et al., 2020, Acemoglu
et al., 2020, Alvarez et al., 2020]. Quarantine is one of the key aspects of infection control during
the pandemic of COVID-19. This paper focuses on study of the optimal quarantine duration for
infectious diseases with application to data analysis of COVID-19, which is not discussed in all
the aforementioned literature. Comparing to the standard quantile methods due to Farewell et al.
[2005], Nishiura [2009] and Liu et al. [2020], the data analysis results demonstrate that our method
suggests a shorter average quarantine duration while keep the risk of virus spreading below a given
level. That is, the proposed method can keep the risk of virus spreading at the same low level
as the standard methods in addition to saving cost of days lost. After quarantine, uninfected
individuals may work and study by keeping some social distances or some other simpler measures.
Hence, this papers make significant contribution to decrease financial and social costs and impact
on economic development with the assurance of controlling the epidemic.

Optimal quarantine rule

Let X be a feature vector describing the characteristics of a potentially exposed individual. Let
X be the support of X and let I be a variable indicating whether or not the individual has been
infected (I = 1 if infected and I = 0 otherwise). Clearly, I is unobservable before quarantine. A
quarantine rule t(·) is a map from X to R+ , that is, t : X → R+ . Let Y > 0 be the incubation
period of the infectious disease for I = 1 and the incubation period is not defined for I = 0.
An infected individual has low risk of infecting others if the individual has symptom presentation
and hence is diagnosed during the quarantine. A good quarantine duration should ensure a large
enough probability that an infected individual has sympton presentation during the quarantine and
minimize the average quarantine duriation of uninfected individuals. Then the problem of finding
the optimal quarantine rule can be expressed as finding a map that minimizes the following problem
min E0 t(X) s.t. P1 (Y ≤ t(X)) ≥ 1 − ,
t

(1)

where  is a predefined small positive number (e.g. 0.05) and the subscript 0 or 1 denotes that
the expection or probability is taken conditional on I = 0 or 1. In this paper, we call E0 t(X) the
redundant length of the quarantine rule t(·) and call P1 (Y ≤ t(X)) the finding probability of the
quarantine rule t(·).
If there is no available feature X, problem [1] reduces to
min t s.t. P1 (Y ≤ t) ≥ 1 − .
t

This just defines the 1 −  quantile of incubation period distribution. In particular, this suggests
the 0.95 quantile method due to Farewell et al. [2005] when  = 0.05.
Remark 1 Suppose θ is the proportion of quarantined infected people in all the infected people

4

and R0 is the basic reproductive number of the disease. Then every infected individual who is
not quarantined or released early causes R0 infections approximately. Hence an infected individual
causes R(θ, , R0 ) = (1 − θ)R0 + θR0 infections on average. If R(θ, , R0 ) < 1, the virus spreading
can be controlled and the disease will die out exponentially. For example, suppose θ = 0.8 and
R0 = 4, then the epidemic will be controlled if we choose an  smaller than 1/16. However, the
main purpose of quarantine is to stop the spread of the virus as soon as possible, and hence we
usually take  to be a smaller constant such as 0.05.

2.1

Derivation of the optimal solution

Suppose X = (C, W ), where C is a categorical variable that takes value in {1, . . . , K} and W ∈ Rd
is a vector of continuous variables. Let µ be the product of the counting measure on {1, . . . , K}
and the Lebesgue measure on Rd . Let f1 (x) be the density function of X conditional on I = 1
w.r.t. µ and f0 (x) be the density function of X conditional on I = 0 w.r.t. µ. We use F1 (y | x)
to denote the distribution function of Y conditional on X = x and I = 1 and use f1 (y | x) to
denote the corresponding density function w.r.t. the Lebesgue measure. Then problem [1] can be
reformulated as
Z
min

t(x)f0 (x)dµ(x)

t

Z
s.t.

F1 (t(x) | x)f1 (x)dµ(x) ≥ 1 − 

This is a variation problem and not easy to solve in general. However, we find that the solution
of this problem is easy to handle under the following conditions.
Condition 1 ∀ x ∈ X , f1 (y | x) > 0 for any y > 0 and f1 (y | x) is continuous with respect to
y. Moreover, f1 (y | x) is either strictly monontonous with respect to y or unimodal and strictly
monontonous with respect to y on both of the monotone intervals.
5

Condition 2 0 < inf x P(I = 1 | X = x) ≤ supx P(I = 1 | X = x) < 1 and inf x supy f1 (y | x) > 0.
Condition 1 is a mild condition and can be satisfied by many commonly used parameterizations
of the incubation period (e.g. weibull, lognormal, gamma and Erlang distributions). Condition 2
is a mild regular condition. It is not of practical significant to consider the case where P(I = 1 |
X = x) = 0, 1. If we assume for any x, the conditional distribution f1 (y | x) = f1 (y | αx , λx ) is
weibull distribution with shape parameter αx and scale parameter λx , then a sufficient condition
for inf x supy f1 (y | x) > 0 is supx λx < ∞. By Bayes formula,
f1 (x)
1 − P(I = 1) P(I = 1 | X = x)
=
.
f0 (x)
P(I = 1) 1 − P(I = 1 | X = x)
By Condition 2, we have

Let
c∗ = inf sup

then we can establish the following theorem.
Theorem 1 For any 0 < c ≤ c∗ and x ∈ X , define tc (x) = sup{y : f1 (y | x)f1 (x)/f0 (x) ≥ c}.
Under Conditions 1 and 2, if  is small enough such that  ≤ 1−E1 [F1 (tc∗ (X) | X)], then there is a
unique constant c0 ∈ (0, c∗ ] such that E1 [F1 (tc0 (X) | X)] = 1 −  and tc0 (·) is the unique minimum
point of problem [1].
The proof of Theorem 1 is given in SI Appendix. In what follows, let us make some intuitive

6

explaination for Theorem 1. Our optimal quarantine rule is determined based on the density ratio
f1 (y | x)f1 (x)
f0 (x)
which is kind of like the likelihood ratio in hypothesis testing Lehmann [2005]. Suppose we need
to determine the quarantine duration for an individual with feature value X = x0 , then f1 (y |
x)f1 (x0 )/f0 (x0 ) is a curve of y. For a given c, we call the set
{y : f1 (y | x0 )f1 (x0 )/f0 (x0 ) ≥ c}
the high density ratio period, see the following picture for an illustration (Fig. 1).

Figure 1: An example for high density ratio period with threshold 0.02: the period between the
left and right endpoints of the gray area.
In the high density ratio period, the individual has relatively high probability density of symtom
presentation if an individual is infected. A possible quarantine policy is“release the individual
if an individual does not develop any symtom until the end of the high density ratio period”
and we denote the resulting quarantine duration by tc (x0 ). A question is how to determine the
7

threshold value c. Clearly, for every x0 , c cannot be larger than supy f1 (y|x0 )f1 (x0 )/f0 (x0 ), the
peak of the curve. This implies that c cannnot be larger than c∗ . The larger c is, the smaller
the finding probability is. If  ≤ 1 − E1 [F1 (tc∗ (X) | X)], then the finding probability at c∗
E1 [F1 (tc∗ (X) | X)] is less than or equal to 1 − . Condition 1 implies the monotonicity and
continuity of E1 [F1 (tc (X) | X)] on c. Theorem 1 states that there exists a unique constant
c0 ∈ (0, c∗ ] such that E1 [F1 (tc0 (X) | X)] = 1 −  and tc0 (·) is the optimal quarantine rule.
Remark 2 In practice, the loss of being quarantined for different individual may also be different.
We can easily adapt our framework to this scenario by extending problem [1] to a more general
form
P1 (Y ≤ t(X)) ≥ 1 − 

min E0 w(X)t(X) s.t.
t

where w(x) > 0 is a weighting function which indicates different costs of quarantine for different
individuals. In this case a modified version of Theorem 1 with f0 (x) in the definition of tc (x)
replaced by w(x)f0 (x) follows directly under Conditions 1 and 2 if 0 < inf x w(x) < supx w(x) < ∞.

2.2

Estimation

Now we propose an estimation procedure for the optimal quarantine duration for any x ∈ X . To
estimate the optimal quarantine duration given in Theorem 1, we need to estimate f1 (y | x), f1 (x)
and f0 (x). Suppose we have historical quarantine data denoted by (Y1 , X1 , I1 ), . . . , (Yn , Xn , In ).
Note that in the historical data we know whether an individual is infected. Here we define Yi = 0 for
samples with Ii = 0 for i = 1, . . . , n. Then f1 (y | x), f1 (x) and f0 (x) can be estimated consistently
by either standard parametrical or nonparametrical methods, e.g. maximum likelihood method or
kernel smooth method Hansen [2008], van der Vaart [1998]. Suppose fˆ1 (y | x), fˆ1 (x) and fˆ0 (x)
are the resulting estimators. Then c∗ can be estimated by ĉ∗ = inf x supy fˆ1 (y | x)fˆ1 (x)fˆ0 (x). Let
8

Ry

fˆ1 (s | x)ds be the estimated conditional distribution and tˆc (x) = sup{y : fˆ1 (y |
P
x)fˆ1 (x)/fˆ0 (x) ≥ c}, then c0 can be estimated by the solution of Ii =1 F̂1 (t̂c (Xi ) | Xi )/n = 1 − 

F̂1 (y | x) =

0

as an equation of c on the interval (0, ĉ∗ ], where  is a user specified positive number smaller than
P
1 − Ii =1 F̂1 (t̂ĉ∗ (Xi ) | Xi )/n. The resulting estimator of c0 is denoted by ĉ0 . Finally, the estimator
of the optimal quarantine duration is t̂opt (x) = sup{y : fˆ1 (y | x)fˆ1 (x)/fˆ0 (x) ≥ ĉ0 }.

Application to COVID-19 Data

3.1

Optimal quarantine rule using age as a feature

In this subsection, we apply our method to analyzing COVID-19 data. Demographic features
such as age, sex and comorbidities are important in analyzing epidemiological data Dowd et al.
[2020]. The incubation period data along with age information are available from the websites of
the centres of disease control, or the daily public reports on COVID-19 in 29 provinces in China
and are reported by Liu et al. [2020]. In this subsection we use this dataset to construct the
optimal quarantine rule using age as the feature X. Here we only use the information of patients
who are infected before Jan 23th to avoid the biased sampling problem disscussed in Liu et al.
[2020]. The total number of samples is 1770. We use these data to estimate f1 (x) and f1 (y | x).
In the dataset, the proportions of patients younger than 11 and patients older than 80 are very
small (1.9% and 0.6% respectively). Considering the accuracy of the estimation we focus on the
people aged between 11 and 80 and take these people as the whole population in our analysis (i.e.
X = {11, . . . , 80}). We apply the kernel method with a Gaussian associate kernel introduced in
Kokonendji and Kiesse [2011] to estimate f1 (x).
The reported integer value incubation period is regarded as the least integer greater than or
equal to the true incubation period. Let Z = dY e where d·e is the ceiling function, then the data
are regarded as i.i.d. sample from Z, X | I = 1 and denoted by (Z1 , X1 ), . . . , (Zn , Xn ). We assume

9

conditional on X = x the incubation period Y follows a weibull distribution, which is commonly
used in analyzing incubation period Lauer et al. [2020]. And we further assume the conditional
density has the form
f1 (y | x, α0 , γ0 ) =

h  y  α0 i
α0  y α0 −1
,
exp
− T
γ0T v(x) γ0T v(x)
γ0 v(x)

where v(x) = (1, x, x2 )T and α0 and γ0 = (γ10 , γ20 , γ30 )T are unknown parameters satisfying α0
and γ0T v(x) > 0. Let α > 0, γ = (γ1 , γ2 , γ3 )T and Vi = (1, Xi , Xi2 )T for i = 1, . . . , n, then the log
likelihood function Odell et al. [1992] is

and f1 (y | x) can be estimated by f1 (y | x, α̂, γ̂) where (α̂, γ̂ T )T is the maximum likelihood
estimator. Here we use a quadratic function to fit the conditional distribution based on the
exploratory data analysis. The estimated value of the parameters are listed as follow:

(9.09, -0.11, 0.0015)

Since the number of infected people in China is relative small compared to the entire population,
we use the age distribution of the entire population of China to estimate the age distribution
conditional on I = 0 and apply the kernel method with a Gaussian associate kernel to estimate
f0 (x).
In this section, we choose  = 0.05 which is sufficient to control the epidemic under the scenario
discussed in Remark 1. There are two other ways to make sure P1 (Y ≤ t(X)) ≥ 0.95. One is
10

to omit the feature and use the 0.95 sample quantile of the incubation period as the quarantine
duration for everyone Farewell et al. [2005] and another is to use the 0.95 estimated quantile
of the conditional incubation period distribution as the quarantine duration for people at the
corresponding age Liu et al. [2020]. Quarantine durations for people at different ages obtained by
the proposed method and the two quantile methods are plotted in Fig. 2.

Figure 2: Quarantine duration for people at different ages: 0.95 quantle, dashed line; 0.95 conditional quantile, dashes dotted line; optimal duration, solid line.
Figure 2 shows that the 0.95 sample quantile of incubation period is 15 days, which is one day
longer than the current quarantine duration in China. The estimated 0.95 conditional quantile
of incubation period of middle-aged people is shorter compared to the young people and the old
people. The estimated optimal quarantine duration is close to 15 days for people older than 30 and
are shorter than 15 days for people younger than 30. This is because the optimal quarantine rule
denpends on the probability that an individual is infected and young people is less likely infected
in the dataset we consider. For x ∈ X , let t̂q (x) and t̂cq (x) be the quarantine durations obtained
by 0.95 sample quantile and 0.95 estimated conditional quantile, respectively. To compare the
performance of these two methods and the optimal quarantine rule, we calculate the redundant
11

where s denote q, cq or opt respectively. Because non-integer quarantine duration is not practical,
the quarantine duration is rounded to the nearest integer in calculation. The results are listed in
Table 2.

Table 2 shows that the optimal quarantine rule has the shortest redundant length with guaranteed finding probability. The 0.95 conditional quantile and the optimal quarantine rule are
derived based on the conditional distribution model of incubation period. The reasonable finding
probabilities in Table 2 also justify our model assumption. The improvement is not great in terms
of redundant length. The reason may be that age does not provide sufficient information for obtaining a quarantine rule with good performance. Next, let us consider an example with infection
rate in the individual’s origin country observed in addition to age.

12

3.2

Optimal quarantine rule based on age and infection rate of origin
country

Travel quarantine for out-of-country travelers and residents from another country is a common
policy around the world during COVID-19 pandemic. When determining quarantine duration, the
traveller’s age and infection rate of the disease in the origin country can be observed. In this case,
infection rate in a traveller’s origin country is an important feature that reflects the probability
that the traveller is infected. For every country we can calculate a current infection index (CII):
CII = 106 ∗ a/b where a is the number of new cases in the country during the last two weeks and
b is the total population of the country. Here we multiply the rate by a constant 106 to avoid this
index being too small. We only consider the number of infections in the last two weeks because the
number of infections before two weeks provide little information about the infection probability
of current traveller. We divide the countries with different CII into three groups because many
countries have similar infection rates. Countries with CII larger than 300 are divided into the high
risk group, countries with 50 < CII ≤ 300 are divided into the medium risk group and countries
with CII ≤ 50 are divided into the low risk group. Besides age, we take the risk level of the
traveller’s origin country as a feature.
In this subsection, we obtain the optimal quarantine rule using information from multiple
datasets. We consider 79 countries in our model since their data are relatively complete in all the
data sources. The number of confirmed cases of each country is reported by the Center for Systems
Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University (JHU). We use the number of cases
confirmed between May 1st to May 14th in each country to calculate the current infection index.
SI Appendix, Table S1, shows countries with different risk levels.
As in the previous subsection, we focus on the people aged between 11 and 80. We approximate
the feature distribution of uninfected people by the distribution of the entire population (people
in the 79 countries) and estimate f0 (x) by the kernel method with a Gaussian associate kernel
13

Kokonendji and Kiesse [2011] using data from the website of United Nations. Data of 5008 COVID19 patients from Xu et al. [2020] are used to estimate f1 (x). However, we take the proportion of
confirmed cases from different countries reported by CSSE at JHU instead of that in the dataset
of Xu et al. [2020] since the proportion reported by CSSE at JHU are regarded more exact.
The dataset of Xu et al. [2020] does not contain incubation period of the patients. To overcome
this difficulty, we assume that the distribution of incubation period for patients at the same age are
the same across countries at different risk levels. Thus we can use the conditional distribution model
of incubation period fitted in the previous subsection to impute the missing incubation period.
Then we can estimate the three individualized quarantine durations using the imputed dataset.
Here we employ the mutiple imputation method which is standard in missing data literature Little
and Rubin [2019]. We impute the dataset for ten times and average the resulting estimators
over different imputed datasets. Quarantine durations obtained by the sample 0.95 quantile, the
estimated 0.95 conditional quantile and the optimal quarantine rule are plotted in Fig. 3.

Figure 3: Quarantine durations for people at different ages: 0.95 quantile, dashed line; conditional
quantile, dashed dotted line; optimal quarantine duration for travellers from high risk countries,
dotted line; optimal quarantine duration for travellers from medium risk countries, short dashed
line; optimal quarantine durationfor travellers from low risk countries, solid line.

14

It can be seen that the optimal quarantine rule gives a much longer duration to travellers from
the high risk countries, a duration slightly longer than the 0.95 quantile to travellers from the
medium risk countries and a very short duration to travellers from the low risk countries. Optimal
quarantine durations for travellers from high, medium and low risk countries shows different trends
on age. The trend of high and medium risk countries is consistent with the trend of the conditional
quantile curve. This may be because if the infection rate is relatively high, optimal quarantine
duration mainly depends on the incubation period. For travellers from low risk countries, the
optimal quarantine rule gives shorter quarantine duration for young people compared to old people.
The reason may be that in the low risk countries, infection rate of young people is relatively low.
The sample 0.95 quantile and the estimated 0.95 conditional quantile methods give quarantine
durations that are not dependent on the risk level of the orgin country since the these two methods
are independent of the national infected rate by definition.
We calculate the reduncant length and the finding probability for the three methods by a
similar procedure as in the previous subsection. The results are reported in Table 3.

age and the risk level of the traveller’s origin country as features

Table 3 shows that our optimal quarantine rule shorten the average quarantine duration of
uninfected people greatly with the guaranteed probability of finding infected individual. Comparing the results in Table 2 and 3, we can see that it is significant to add the risk level of the
traveller’s origin country as a feature for the optimal rule. If one can collect other features which
are associated with the incubation period or the probability that an individual is infected, the

15

optimal quarantine rule may perform even better.

Discussion

Although we apply our method to analyzing the COVID-19 data, our method is general and can be
applied to establishing optimal quarantine rule for any infectious disease as long as some historical
quarantine data are available. Clearly, the conception “optimal” depends on the available features.
As mentioned before, if there is no available feature, then our optimal quarantine duration reduces
to the 1 −  quantile of the incubation peiod. There may be some other features that are useful
to determine the quarantine duration. For example, a test result for the pathogen can serve as
an important feature even though sensitivity and specificity of the test are not that high. It is of
great importance to select features which are useful to determine the quarantine duration. This
may be an interesting topic for future works.
