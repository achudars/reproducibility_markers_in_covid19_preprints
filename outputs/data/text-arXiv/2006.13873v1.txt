Abstract
Background and Objective: Currently, the whole world is facing a pandemic disease, novel Coronavirus also known as COVID-19, which spread in
more than 200 countries with around 3.3 million active cases and 4.4 lakh
deaths approximately. Due to rapid increase in number of cases and limited
supply of testing kits, availability of alternative diagnostic method is necessary
for containing the spread of COVID-19 cases at an early stage and reducing
the death count. For making available an alternative diagnostic method, we
proposed a deep neural network based diagnostic method which can be easily
integrated with mobile devices for detection of COVID-19 and viral pneumonia
using Chest X-rays (CXR) images.
Methods: In this study, we have proposed a method named COVIDLite,
which is a combination of white balance followed by Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) and depth-wise separable convolutional
neural network (DSCNN). In this method, white balance followed by CLAHE is
used as an image preprocessing step for enhancing the visibility of CXR images
and DSCNN trained using sparse cross entropy is used for image classification
with lesser parameters and significantly lighter in size, i.e., 8.4 MB without
quantization.
Results: The proposed COVIDLite method resulted in improved performance in comparison to vanilla DSCNN with no pre-processing. The proposed
method achieved higher accuracy of 99.58% for binary classification, whereas
96.43% for multi-class classification and out-performed various state-of-the-art
methods.
Conclusion: Our proposed method, COVIDLite achieved exceptional re1 manusiddhartha.dml11@iiitb.net

sults on various performance metrics. With detailed model interpretations,
COVIDLite can assist radiologists in detecting COVID-19 patients from CXR
images and can reduce the diagnosis time significantly.

1. Introduction
COVID-19 started to spread since December 2019, when a large number of
pneumonia cases of unknown cause occurred in Wuhan, Hubei, China, whose
clinical characteristics much resembled with viral pneumonia. Detailed analysis
by observing samples indicated a novel virus named as coronavirus or COVID19. Since then, the number of cases increased extremely fast, with death count
increased at an alarming rate. The critical observation in casualty cases from
COVID-19 was that all the patients had developed into severe pneumonia. The
primary strategy for containing its spread and reducing the death count is
early diagnosis of COVID-19 cases so that patients can be timely quarantined,
which prevents them from spreading the virus to others [1]. The first and the
most common diagnostic test for diagnosing COVID-19 is a real-time reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). However, the RT-PCR test
has three significant issues. First, it is a time-consuming process [2]; second,
it has lower sensitivity of 60%–70%, [3], i.e., around 30% of the cases where
the test diagnosed negative to actual positive cases is a critical issue; third, it
requires the availability of commercial kits [3]. However, in those misdiagnosed
cases, symptoms can be detected when examined through radiological images
[4] [5]. So, other alternative diagnostic tests that are relatively accurate with
higher sensitivity and faster in terms of test results are significant in the early
diagnosis of COVID-19 patients. According to some of the researchers, combined features of radiological images with other laboratory tests may help in
early-stage identification of COVID-19 [6] [7] [8] [9] [10]. In some of the
studies, researchers found a useful pattern in chest CT and CXR images, which
were very crucial in the identification of COVID-19 [6] [9] [11]. Chest CT is
more sensitive to COVID-19, but we have employed CXR in this research due
to its easier availability, lower cost, and lesser waiting time for results.
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have recently shown to exceed the
medical practitioner’s performance in diagnosing pneumonia from CXR images
due to advancements in processing power and the availability of large image
datasets. In [12], researchers have used seven layers of deep convolutional neural
networks (DCNNs) for detecting pneumonia from CXR images. In this method,
they have employed the ReLU activation function between hidden layers and
a sigmoid activation function for performing the classification task. They have
achieved higher validation accuracy for the image size of 200 x 200. In [13], a
DCNN with transfer learning used to detect pneumonia from CXR images. In
this method, researchers have used advanced image processing techniques such

2

as gamma correction, equalization, filtering, and compression to enhance image
quality, which improved the overall performance of their model.
Recently, a significant amount of research was conducted for diagnosing
COVID-19 from CXR images using DCNNs, and have shown exceptional results. [14] have used a transfer learning approach for detecting COVID-19
from CXR images. They have employed Support Vector Machine for extracting deep features, and pre-trained network ResNet-50 for classification, resulting in higher mean accuracy of 95.33%. In another study [15], researchers
have used generative adversarial network (GAN) to increase training images of
four class types COVID-19, normal, viral pneumonia, and bacterial pneumonia, whereas pre-trained networks such as Alexnet, Googlenet, and Restnet18
used for the classification task. They have increased the size of their existing
dataset to 30 times, which resulted in higher accuracy and sensitivity of the
models. [16] proposed a new framework named COVID X-Net capable of detecting COVID-19 from CXR images using seven pre-trained networks namely,
VGG19, DenseNet121, ResNetV2, InceptionV3, InceptionResNetV2, Xception
and MobileNetV2.
In this paper, we have developed a hybrid method comprising a deep CNN
model based on depth-wise separable convolutions and white balance followed
by CLAHE for image enhancement as a data preprocessing step. In previous
studies, different novel data preprocessing techniques proved useful in many
applications such as hand gesture recognition using radar systems [17], hand
gesture recognition using ultrasound imaging and speech recognition [18] among
others. DSCNNs first used in Xception Net has shown exceptional results in the
classification task of natural images. However, in the case of medical images,
much adjustment is required as medical images can be available in 3 dimensions
RGB, 4 dimensions, or 2-dimensions with grayscale, whereas natural images are
mostly available in 2-dimensional RGB formats. The other major difference
is in terms of intensity variations, furthermore natural images are generally
recognized by edges, basic shape, correlation among neighboring pixels etc.,
whereas each pixel intensity or brightness level are not relevant feature for their
recognition. However, in the case of medical images, specifically CXR images,
each pixel intensity is essential in locating affected regions within the image,
which is significantly crucial for detecting abnormalities within CXR images.
Thus, proper image preprocessing is essential for building a robust and accurate
model for detecting abnormalities in medical images.
1.1. Contributions and Outline
The contribution of this study can be summarized as follows:
1. A novel approach comprising of white balance with CLAHE followed by
novel DSCNN model is proposed for the detection of COVID-19 from CXR
images,
2. The proposed method is shown to outperform traditional DSCNN without preprocessing and other recent state-of-the-art methods in terms of

3

accuracy in detecting COVID-19 in both 2-class and 3-class classification
tasks,
3. The proposed method is significantly lighter in terms of model size making
it favorable for deploying as a web app for generating real-time diagnosis
of COVID-19 in inaccessible areas,
4. We analyze the intepretability of the proposed model using Grad-CAM,
LIME, and saliency maps, which in turn can provide key insights to radiologists for accurate diagnosis of COVID-19.

separable CNNs and the method employed in this research. Further, we also

the dataset utilized in this research, along with performance measures used for
evaluating our method. In section 4, we have presented our results with a visual
interpretation of our model’s prediction and discussed the previous method used
for the detection of COVID-19 and their comparison with the proposed method.
Section 5 provides the conclusion of this research.
2. Methodology
2.1. Depth-wise separable CNN (DSCNN)
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) inspired from the working of human
brain’s visual cortex. One of the key reason for the success of CNN is the availability of large training dataset, also their ability to learn distinctive features
implicitly from the input image. However, deep CNNs come with the drawback
of large memory size and compute requirements, which can be deterrent for
real-time applications such as on embedded platform or web application. Further, DCNNs with large parameters require large dataset to avoid overfitting,
which is a problem for medical imaging, where datasets are limited. One of the
solution for the above problem is depth-wise separable convolution (DSC) first
proposed by Chollet [19], which divides the regular convolution operation into
two separate operations depth-wise or spatial convolution and sequential pointwise convolution, as shown in Fig. 1. The depth-wise convolution operation
applies a 2D filter to each input channel. Since a single filter is applied to each
input channel, it reduces the number of computations significantly as only the
input channel corresponding to each filter is computed. Further, 1 × 1 convolution or point-wise convolution is used to aggregate the results of depth-wise
convolution for creating a new feature map, as shown in Fig. 1(b). Thus resulting in significant reduction in parameters and computation cost, making them
favorable candidate for real-time inference on mobile and embedded platforms.
The standard convolution is defined as
(W ∗ y)i, j =

K X
L X
M
X
k=1 l=1 m=1

Wk,l,m . yi+k, j+l,m

(1)

where W is the weight kernel, y is the input feature map, i, j, m are the height,
width and channel dimension, and ∗ denotes the standard convolution operation.
The point-wise ∗P W , depth-wise ∗DW and depth separable convolution
DSC(W p , W d , y) are defined as follows
(W ∗P W y)i, j =

M
X

Wk,l,m

yi+k, j+l,m

(3)

m=1

(W ∗DW y)i, j =

Wk,l

k=1 l=1
DSC(W p , W d , y)i, j = (W p ∗P W

yi+k, j+l

(W d ∗DW y)i, j )i, j

(4)

where W p and W d represents the different weights for point-wise and depth-wise
convolution, and represents element-wise multiplication.
The depth seperable convolution drastically reduces the number of parameters compared to regular convolution as

Pconv

= dk × dk × M × N

PDSC = M × (dk × dk ) + M × N

(5)

where M denotes number of input channels, N denotes number of output channels and dk represents kernel size. For e.g., if we have 48 input channels (M), 96
output channels (N) and kernel of size 3 (dk ) this would result in 41,472 parameters for regular convolution compared to only 5040 parameters for depth-wise
separable convolution, meaning 87.84% reduction in parameters.
2.2. Proposed Method
The methodology proposed in this study for detection of COVID-19 pneumonia from CXR images is depicted in Fig. 2.
As shown in Fig. 2, the overall methodology for training and evaluating the
proposed method (COVIDLite) are described in the following steps Step 1: Collected the labeled image dataset from different sources and imported them for further pre-processing.
Step 2: In this step image pre-processing performed using white balance
followed by Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) technique. The White balance and CLAHE method are described below.
White Balance: White Balance is the image processing operation applied
to adjust proper color fidelity in a digital image. Due to low lighting conditions
in medical images, some of the parts of the image appeared dark and the image capturing equipment does not detect light precisely as the human eye does.
Due to this, image processing or correction help to ensure that the final image
represents the colors of the natural image. The objective of this operation is to
enhance the visibility of the image so that DCNNs could extract useful features
from the image. The white balance algorithm adjusts the colors of the active

layers of the image by stretching red, green, and blue channels independently.
For doing this, pixel colors discarded, which are at the end of the three channels and are used by only 0.05% of the pixels in the image, while stretching
is performed for the remaining color range. After this operation, pixel colors

6

infrequently present at the end of the channel could not negatively influence the
upper and lower bound values while stretching [20] [21]. In this solution, we
have implemented a white balance algorithm in python language using NumPy
and OpenCV library.
The steps of the White balance algorithm can be summarized as

Ma = P100−0.05 (C)



(6)

where Pi (C) represents the taking the ith percentile of channel C, and
Clip(., min, max) operation depicts performing saturation operation within min
and max values. C, Cupd denotes the input and updated channels pixel values
after the operation respectively.
CLAHE: is an effective contrast enhancement method that effectively increases the contrast of the image. CLAHE is an improved version of the adaptive
histogram equation (AHE). Histogram equalization is the simple method for enhancing the contrast of the image by spreading out the intensity range of the
image or stretching out the most frequent intensity value of the image. Stretching the intensity values changes the natural brightness of the input image and
introduces some undesirable noise in the image [22]. In AHE, the input image split into several small images, also known as tiles. In this method, the
histogram of each tile computed, which corresponds to different sections of the
image and uses them to derive intensity remapping function for each tile. This
method introduces noise in the image due to over amplification. CLAHE works
precisely the same as AHE, but it clips the histogram at specific values for limiting the amplification before computing the cumulative distributive function.
The overamplified part of the histogram is further redistributed over the histogram as shown in Fig. 3 [22]. In one of the previous studies [23], CLAHE
showed exceptional results in enhancing chest CT images and considered useful
in examining a wide variety of medical images. The computation of CLAHE
[24] is performed as
p = (pmax − pmin ) ∗ P (f ) + pmin

(7)

where, p represents pixel value after applying CLAHE, pmax , pmin represents
maximum and minimum pixel value of an image respectively and P (f ) represents cumulative probability distribution function.
The preprocessed images are presented in Fig. 4, which depicts that white
balance and CLAHE have significantly enhanced the clarity of the image and
better represented the medical CXR images, which otherwise were not well
represented in the original images.
Step 3: This step performs image normalization followed by the resizing of
the image. Normalization is an important step that ensures that each pixel
in the image has a uniform distribution. It helps in faster convergence while

training a deep neural network. In this step, the image pixels are normalized by
255, which scales the pixel values between (0,1). Further, the image is re-sized
to 224 × 224 pixels before feeding the image to the input layer of DCNN.
Step 4: The dataset is split in the ratio of 80%-20% for training and testing
respectively.
Step 5: The proposed DSC network comprising of 2 convolution layers and
12 depth-wise separable convolution layers is trained. Each convolution layer
followed by a max-pooling layer, whereas the depth-wise convolution layer followed by batch normalization and max-pooling layer. In the end fully connected
dense layers followed by softmax layer and output layer.
Step 6: K-fold cross-validation of DCNN performed with 100 epochs for each
fold. The training set is divided into k folds, and the network trained on k-1
parts while validation performed on the remaining 1 part. This step is repeated
k times (5 in our case), and the network performance reported by taking the
average of k fold predictions.
Step 7: Test the network on test data by performing network evaluation using different performance metrics such as plotting confusion matrix, calculating
accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, F1-score, and average area under the
curve (AUC) for each class type. Furthermore, the t-SNE of the images and the
saliency maps of the images are performed for interpretability of the NN.
2.3. Architecture of proposed COVIDLite
The proposed network of COVIDLite, comprises of a combination of two
separate convolution blocks. The input of the network is a 224 × 224 × 3 channel
CXR image, followed by 18 convolution layers. The size of the kernel used
in the network chosen to be small, i.e. 3 × 3. The kernel size of 3 × 3 also
proposed in XceptionNet architecture, [19], which resulted in higher accuracy
than InceptionV3 network [25] when tested on large image classification dataset,
ImageNet dataset [26], comprising 350 million images and 17,000 classes. In
the first block, two convolution layers followed by a max-pooling layer of size
2 × 2. In the second convolution block, two convolution layers are followed
by batch normalization, further followed by a max-pooling layer of size 2 × 2.
The problem of traditional deep neural networks with high learning rate results
in the gradient that may explode or vanish or may stuck in sub-optimal local
minima [27] . One of the significant problems with the deep neural net is the
problem of overfitting. We have solved the problem of overfitting by employing
dropout layers proposed in [28] . We have solved the problem of overfitting
by employing dropout layers. We have employed dropout layers after sixth
separable convolution layer with dropout ratio of 0.2, which further increased in
the range of (0.7 to 0.2) is fully connected dense layers. The detailed architecture
of the deep CNN model used in the proposed method shown in Tab. 1.
2.3.1. Activation function
The selection of activation function plays a key role in convergence of the
deep neural network. In our proposed solution, we have used ReLU activation

x < 0, whereas outputs linear function when x ≥ 0. In the last layer of the
deep CNN model, softmax function is used for classification. Softmax maps the
output of the last layer of the network to the normalized probability distribution
over the predicted output classes. Softmax function is defined as

where K defines the number of classes to be predicted.
2.3.2. Loss function
As we have multi-class classification problem and the labels are mutually
exclusive i.e., each sample belongs to only one class at a time so we have used
sparse categorical cross entropy loss function. It is a variant of cross entropy loss
function. The basic difference between two loss function is in terms of practical
implementation. In case of sparse categorical cross entropy loss function integer
labels are used for calculating loss against ground truth unlike one-hot encoded
10

vectors in case of categorical cross entropy loss function which makes them
memory efficient by saving lots of computation in terms of log operation and
results in faster execution. The sparse categorical cross entropy loss function is
defined as
M

J(θ) = −

where, θ represents model parameters, yi denotes true labels in integers, ŷi (θ)
denotes predicted value by model and M denotes the total number of classes
3. Dataset and Performance Measures
3.1. Dataset
The dataset used in this study consists of 1823 images of an annotated poster
anterior(PA) view of CXR images. Labeled Optical Coherence Tomography
(OCT) and CXR Images [29] used for viral pneumonia and non-pneumonia
or normal cases, whereas three different datasets [30, 31, 32] used for viral
pneumonia and non-pneumonia or normal cases, whereas three different datasets
used for COVID-19 cases. The dataset consists of 536 images of COVID-19,
619 images of viral pneumonia, and 668 images of normal cases. The age range
of COVID-19 cases in the dataset is 18-75 years—the detailed specification of
images used in the dataset depicted in Tab. 2. As shown in Tab. 2, COVID19 images have a considerable variation in height and width with maximum
height and maximum width compared to other class of images. Figure 5 shows
the sample images of normal, viral pneumonia, and COVID-19 cases. As per
Fig. 5, the normal CXR image depicts clear lungs without any area of abnormal
opacification or pattern in the image, viral pneumonia (middle) manifests with a
more diffuse ”interstitial” pattern in both lungs and COVID-19 (extreme right)
depicts ground-glass opacification and consolidation in the right upper lobe and
left lower lobe. For training deep CNN model, the dataset divided into a ratio of
80-20, where 80% of the dataset used for training the model while 20% used for
testing the model. The distribution of images in the training and test set shown
in Tab. 3. For the analysis of CXR images, all CXR images initially screened
for quality control by filtering all low quality or unreadable scans for building
efficient deep learning models.

3.2. Performance Measures
For evaluating the performance of the proposed solution, several performance
metrics are chosen, i.e., sensitivity, specificity, precision, F1-score, accuracy, an
average area under the curve (AUC), and cohen’s kappa score. First, confusion
matrix plotted based on the proposed model’s predictions to assess the number
of instances correctly classified and misclassified by the model. The confusion
matrix consists of true positives (TP), true negatives (TN), false positives (FP)
and false negatives (FN). True positives (TP) are the number of disease cases
correctly classified by the model, true negatives (TN) are actual number of
normal cases correctly classified as normal. False positives (FP) are the actual
number of normal cases misclassified as a disease. False negatives (FN) are the
number of disease cases misclassified as normal. The definitions of sensitivity,
specificity, precision, F1-score, and accuracy are as follows TP
TP + FN
TN
Specificity =
TN + FP
TP
Precision =
TP + FP
Precision × Recall
F1 = 2 ×
Precision + Recall
TP + TN
Accuracy =
TP + TN + FP + FN

Cohen’s kappa score =

Sensitvitiy =

where, po represents relative observed agreement between ground truth and
the model, pe represents expected agreement between ground truth and the
model which determines superiority of the model in comparison to simple random guess based on distribution of each class.
The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve is the graph plotted between True Positive Rate (TPR) and False Positive Rate (FPR). TPR and FPR
are defined as
TP
TP + FN
FP
False Positive Rate (FPR) =
FP + TN
True Positive Rate (TPR) =

(11)

Average Area Under the ROC curve (AUC) measures the two-dimensional
area under the ROC curve from point (0,0) to (1,1). For multi-class problem,
AUC is computed as an extension of multi-class AUC as proposed in [33].
Furthermore, Grad-CAM maps, and Locally model-agnostic explanations
visualization methods are used for interpretability of the trained neural network
and gain insights of the featuers the neural network is basing its decisions on.

followed by CLAHE for both 2-class and 3-class scenario. As per the table proposed method with pre-processing resulted in improved performance of approx
1% in accuracy, precision and F1-score, and approx 2% improvement observed
in cohen’s kappa score for the 3-class problem. In comparison, for binary classification, approx 1% improvement observed in accuracy, precision, specificity, and
approx 2% increase observed in terms of cohen’s kappa score. In both the binary
and multi-class problem significant increase observed in performance measures

Figure 7 demonstrates the confusion matrix based on the classification result
of the model’s prediction for binary class and multi-class problems. In a multiclass problem, the model predicted 4 False positives out of which one belongs to
COVID-19, and three belongs to viral pneumonia. Due to overlapping patterns
exist between COVID-19 and viral pneumonia, the model predicted 3 COVID19 cases as viral pneumonia, whereas one viral pneumonia case predicted as
COVID-19. Further, in the case of viral pneumonia, the model predicted 5 False
negatives in which five viral pneumonia cases predicted as normal while 1 case
predicted as COVID-19. In the case of COVID-19, the model predicted three
false negatives, and all the three COVID cases predicted as viral pneumonia.
In binary classification, the model has predicted only 1 False negative, which
showed that the model is highly sensitive, precise, and specific in predicting
COVID cases.
In Fig. 8, we presented the ROC curve for both binary classification and
multi-class classification problem. In multi-class problem the average area under
the curve (AUC) for class 0 i.e., normal cases is 0.99, for class 1 i.e., COVID-19
class is 1.0 and for class 2 i.e., viral pneumonia is 0.99. However, in case of binary

Further, we have shown the LIME [34] maps, saliency maps and Grad-CAM
[35] visualization of misclassified instances of COVIDLite without pre-processing
for viral and COVID-19 patients in Figure 9 and correctly classified instances of
COVIDLite with pre-processing (White Balance + CLAHE) in Figure 10. For
detecting COVID-19 from CXR images the most common findings include lung
consolidation and ground glass opacities [36] . Apart from that, COVID-19
and other viral pneumonia typically cause lung opacities in more than one lobe
[36] . Earlier researchers noted that patients suffering from COVID-19 include
air-space disease which involve bilateral lower lung distribution [37] .
16

As shown in Figure 9, without pre-processing model considered noisy features for prediction of viral and COVID-19 induced pneumonia and wrongly
predicted both the cases as normal. Figure 9 1a) and Fig. 9 2a) demonstrates
the LIME map of the model’s prediction outlining localized regions in CXR
images while Fig.9 1c) and Fig. 9 2c) demonstrate the Grad-CAM heatmap
highlighting the upper region of the CXR. The saliency map highlighting the
lower and upper right corner of CXR in Fig.9 1b) and highlighting the upper
right corner of CXR in Fig.9 2b) instead of focusing on ground glass opacity
and pneumonia involving the lower lung zones bilaterally on CXR in COVID-19
case and on diffuse interstitial pattern showing lung inflammation in right lung
in viral pneumonia case. Thus, the model without pre-processing was unable
to detect core features for classifying viral and COVID-19 pneumonia resulted
in incorrect prediction whereas model with pre-processing, i.e., White balance
followed by CLAHE correctly highlighted region affected with pneumonia, i.e.,
left lung inflammation as shown in Figure Fig. 10 1a), Fig. 10 1b) and Fig. 10
1c) and accurately highlighted peripheral left mid to lower lung opacities and
ground glass opacity (generally visible in chest CT) in COVID-19 case as shown
in Fig.10 2a), Fig. 10 2b) and Fig.10 2c) respectively.

5. Discussion
This section illustrates the comparison of proposed method with recent stateof-the-art methods applied for detection of COVID-19 using radiology images
i.e., CXR and chest CT. In most of the studies researchers used Dr Cohen’s image collection dataset [30]. This was the first open source dataset available for
researchers to extract useful patterns from CXR and chest CT images for detection of COVID-19. [38] proposed transfer learning based pre-trained network
VGG19 for detecting COVID-19 from CXR images. In this study researchers
have used 224 CXR images of COVID-19, 700 images of viral pneumonia and 504
images of normal or healthy cases. Their model achieved an accuracy of 93.48%
for 3-class problem. [39] used light-weight deep learning architecture named as
COVID-Net. They have used 13,975 CXR images across 13,870 patients and
achieved a test accuracy of 93.3%. In this study researchers have employed
projection-expansion-projection-extension (PEPX) design pattern comprising 1
x1 convolution at beginning and end of architecture while depth-wise convolutions at the middle. Xu et al. [40] proposed combination of pre-trained network ResNet and Location Attention method. They have achieved an accuracy
of 86.7% with 219 COVID-19, 224 viral pneumonia and 175 normal chest CT
images. [41] developed deep CNN model named DarkCovidNet for detection
of COVID-19 from CXR images. They have used DarkNet-19 [42] architecture for building the model and achieved an accuracy of 87.02% for multi-class

18

and 98.08% for 2-class problem. [43] proposed class decomposition mechanism
named DeTraC for investigating class boundaries with ResNet18 pre-trained
network for detection of COVID-19 from 196 CXR images. Further they have
used PCA for feature space dimensionality reduction resulted in achieving higher
accuracy of 95.12%. [44] proposed two variants of EfficientNet deep learning
model i.e., hierarchical and Flat. In hierarchical model researchers used one
classifier at root node of the tree for classifying Normal and viral pneumonia
cases and the second classifier at higher level to further classify COVID-19 and
viral Pneumonia cases. This approach resulted in lower accuracy of 93.50% in
comparison to Flat model which attain overall test accuracy of 93.9%. Both flat
efficient net B0 and hierarchical efficientnetB3 are larger in terms of size and
total parameters having total parameters 5,330,564 (21 MB) and 12,320,528 (48
MB) respectively.
In case of binary classification problem, researchers have used different combination of transfer learning approaches. [45] employed three pre-trained networks (ResNet50, InceptionV3, and InceptionResNetV2) in which ResNet50
outperformed other variants by achieving a higher accuracy of 98%. In this
study, researchers used 50 CXR images of COVID-19 positive patients and 50
images of COVID-19 negative images. [14] used ResNet50 in combination with
support vector machines (SVM) for extracting deep features. However, in this
study researchers have used a very small dataset of 50 CXR images comprising 25 COVID-19 images and 25 COVID-19 negative images. [46] employed a
combination of Attention and Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) to extract top
K features of chest CT images using deep ResNet pre-trained network. In this
study, they have achieved an accuracy of 86% with 777 COVID-19 images and
708 healthy images. [47] proposed a modified Inception network (M-Inception)
to detect COVID-19 from chest CT images with an accuracy of 82.90%. [48]
developed a 3 dimensional CNN model with pre-trained network U-Net using
313 chest CT images of COVID-19 and 229 images of healthy cases. They have
reported an accuracy of 90.8%. [49] concatenated pre-trained network Xception
and ResNet50 V2 for detection of COVID-19 and viral pneumonia using 15085
CXR images. As they have combined two complex architecture for the task the
resulting model was computationally intensive with model size of 560 MB which
makes it unfavorable in terms of practical implementation for real time predictions. Finally, [50] proposed a deep CNN model named CoroNet which uses
local receptive field and sharing of weight for better performance. They have
attained an overall test accuracy of 95% for 3-class classification task. Their
proposed CNN model was significantly deeper having large number of trainable
parameters i.e., 33,915,436 due to which their model size also increased making
their method unfavorable for practical implementation in terms of mobile based
web app for real time predictions.
In this research, we have developed a deep CNN model for the detection of
COVID-19 induced pneumonia using 1823 CXR images. The proposed method
named COVIDLite is significantly lighter, with 1019330 total trainable parameters and 8.4 MB in size, making it favorable to be integrated with mobile devices
for real-time predictions. Our method has attained an accuracy of 99.58% for bi19

nary classification and 96.43% for multi-class classification. In this research, we
have found that our proposed COVIDLite method outperformed recent state-ofthe-art methods employed for the detection of COVID-19 from radiology images
in terms of accuracy, as shown in Table 7.

6. Conclusion
In this paper, we demonstrated an effective deep learning model for detecting COVID-19 from CXR images with higher accuracy. Our proposed method

20

performs both binary and multi-class classification with an accuracy of 99.58%
and 96.43%, respectively. The proposed method captures low-level feature maps
by enhancing the visibility of CXR images with advanced preprocessing techniques, which facilitates recognizing intricate patterns from medical images at a
level comparable with experienced radiologists. As future work, we will further
enhance our method’s performance by including the lateral view of CXR images
in our training data, as in some of the cases, frontal view of CXR images does
not give a clear idea in diagnosing pneumonia cases. Further, similar proposed
preprocessing with the DSCNN method can be extenedd to detect more critical
diseases such as lung cancer, fibrosis, tuberculosis, and pnemo-thorax, which in
turn can assist the radiologists in the remotest parts of the world, where medical
resources are limited.
