Abstract

community with unprecedented opportunities to study and
better understand the spread of diseases. However, this burst
of information has posed significant challenges to the traditional data analysis and visualization techniques. Traditional
infographics, such as Venn diagrams which are still widely
used to compare and contrast set of symptoms, fail to aid
practitioners in analyzing large set of symptoms. Thus, tools
that can effectively employ the techniques in other scientific
communities to facilitate this process are of great value.
In this article, we rely on concepts from Topological
Data Analysis and propose a pipeline to automatically extract candidate pathways associated with COVID-19 from
clinical notes. Our pipeline which is based on the notion
of Redescriptions (Parida and Ramakrishnan 2005; Mullins
et al. 2006; Platt et al. 2016) consists of three steps: 1) preprocessing the notes and identifying the candidate symptoms, 2) mapping the symptoms to the space of the patients,
and finally, 3) extracting the topological properties and their
visualization. We have evaluated our pipeline in a publicly
available dataset of COVID-19 clinical notes. The results
show that our model is able to extract meaningful pathways.
For example, in Section 6.1 we demonstrate that there are
potentially distinctive pathways between coughers and noncoughers.
The remainder of this article is organized as follows: in
Section 2 we provide an overview of the concepts that we
use. In Section 3 we present our pipeline and in Section 4 we
discuss the implementation detail. In Section 5 we explain
the detail of our experiments and in Section 6 we present
and discuss the results. Finally, in Section 7 we conclude the
article.

COVID-19 has caused thousands of deaths around the world
and also resulted in a large international economic disruption. Identifying the pathways associated with this illness can
help medical researchers to better understand the properties
of the condition. This process can be carried out by analyzing
the medical records. It is crucial to develop tools and models
that can aid researchers with this process in a timely manner. However, medical records are often unstructured clinical notes, and this poses significant challenges to developing
the automated systems. In this article, we propose a pipeline
to aid practitioners in analyzing clinical notes and revealing
the pathways associated with this disease. Our pipeline relies
on topological properties and consists of three steps: 1) preprocessing the clinical notes to extract the salient concepts,
2) constructing a feature space of the patients to characterize
the extracted concepts, and finally, 3) leveraging the topological properties to distill the available knowledge and visualize
the result. Our experiments on a publicly available dataset of
COVID-19 clinical notes testify that our pipeline can indeed
extract meaningful pathways.

Introduction

Since the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, the scientific community has made tremendous effort to address the
clinical course of the virus. However, there is still a lot to reveal about COVID-19. For instance, most people who contract COVID-19 develop mild to moderate symptoms (WHO
2020), some may show no symptoms, while for others the
disease can be fatal. To better understand different strains
of COVID-19 one approach is to study the underlying pathways. The aim of this study is to investigate the application of topological properties in automatically inferring candidate pathways. We use unstructured clinical notes as the
source of information to automatically extract phenotypes to
be used in our topological model. Phenotypes are the symptoms and signs that reflect the presence of a disease–in the
follows, we refer to them as symptoms.
Advancement in technology has helped scientists to garner large amount of biomedical data. This has provided the

Background

In this section, we review the concepts used in the remainder
of the paper.

2.1

Redescriptions

Redescriptions are used to identify the phenomena that occur in different ways. The concept was first introduced in
(Ramakrishnan et al. 2004), and later in (Parida and Ramakrishnan 2005) was generalized to a framework called
redescription mining, for which the authors present some applications in Genome Ontology database.

Redescriptions are mathematically formalized using
Boolean algebra, which is also used to model the causeeffect relationship among the symptoms. Two different sets
of symptoms which correspond to the same group of patients
is an example of redescriptions. More specifically, suppose
s1 , s2 are two symptoms, and P1 , P2 their respective set of
patients. If the presence of symptom s1 implies the presence
of symptom s2 , then P1 ⊆ P2 . If we consider the combination of the symptoms (i.e. s1 ∧ s2 ), then the group of the
patients who experience both symptoms is P1 ∩ P2 = P1 ,
which is the same group of patients that we obtain by considering only the symptom s1 . Redescriptions–the combination
of symptoms that give rise to the same group of patients–
can reveal logical associations among symptoms. They can
highlight the underlying pathways and are commonly used
to derive rules in the pathways (Mullins et al. 2006).

2.2

Topological Data Analysis

Over the past two decades, Topological Data Analysis
(TDA), raised from Algebraic Topology, has found its way
in the real-world applications. In (Dagliati et al. 2019), TDA
is used to model disease progression by inferring temporal
phenotypes. More recently (Wang et al. 2020) use TDA and
machine learning techniques to investigate genome mutation
of SARS-COV-2. Some other examples in biology include
analysis of brain neural activities (Dabaghian et al. 2012;
Nasrin et al. 2019), and cancer genomics (Nicolau, Levine,
and Carlsson 2011; Rabadán et al. 2020). In this section, we
aim to provide a brief overview of the primary TDA concept,
i.e., the persistent homology. We avoid the mathematical detail which is beyond the scope of this article. For a thorough
description see (Edelsbrunner and Harer 2008; Wasserman
2018).
Let M be a continuous space equipped with a metric δ,
the topological invariants of M are defined as the properties
that do not change under continuous deformation (i.e. twisting but not tearing). The invariants in M for lower dimensions are usually referred to as the connected components,
the holes, and the void spaces, respectively in dimension 0,
1 and 2; in the higher dimensions, they are understood as
k-dimensional holes. The number of k-dimensional holes in
M are called the k-th betti numbers.
Given data points X and a distance function δ—X represents as the points sampled from M —the goal is to compute
the topological invariants of the underlying structure of X
(i.e. space M ). A common approach to accomplish this is
by constructing k-simplexes over X. Intuitively, one could
think of a k-simplex as the smallest convex hull of k + 1
points. A collection of k-simplexes glued together is called
a simplicial complex (satisfying some conditions). Since it
is not reasonable to begin with all the possible k-simplexes
over the data points in X; the technique is to add the simplexes in a sequence of steps. First, a parameter is selected
and the initial simplicial complex S, is set to be the collection of points in X as the 0-simplexes; then the parameter
is increased such that at each step just a specific set of simplexes, that satisfy some conditions, could be added to S;
this procedure creates a filtration of simplicial complexes on
X, which then is analyzed. The conditions to select a sub-

set of simplexes at each step, give rise to different types of
simplicial complexes.

Figure 1: Recovering topological properties using simplicial complexes

An example of a simplicial complex is Čech complex.
Figure 1 shows a simple illustrative example. The goal is to
recover the topological invariants of the space in Figure 1(a).
It is clear that the 0-betti number is one, since there is only
one connected component; and the 1-betti number is two,
since there are two holes; the higher dimensional betti numbers are zero. The dataset X is given by the six sampled
points in Figure 1(b). To construct the Čech complex over
X, we begin with the points in X as 0-simplexes. In order to
construct the higher dimensional simplexes, we start growing a ball at each point, as in Figure 1(c); at this state, the
0-betti number is six, and 1-betti number is zero. By increasing the radius, some of the balls start to overlap each others;
for each k + 1 overlapped balls we insert a k-simplex. Figure 1(d) shows a collection of 1-simplexes, line segments
joining the two points, created by the pairwise overlap of
their corresponding balls; what can be clearly seen in this
simplicial complex is that it recovers the topological properties of the underlying structure in Figure 1(a). If we increase
the radius further, the three balls at the top begin to overlap each others, hence we can add a 2-simplex—a filled in
triangle—as in Figure 1(e). Therefore, the hole which was
created at Figure 1(d) disappeared by increasing the radius
at Figure 1(e), as a result that topological property is lost;
this could eventually happen for the second hole as we continue to increase the radius and add more simplexes. It is
important to notice that the topological properties that persist for a longer period, before they disappear, best represent
the properties of the underlying structure. This characteristic is the basic principle of the persistent homology method,
which was first formalized in (Edelsbrunner, Letscher, and
Zomorodian 2002).
A diagram known as Barcode is commonly used to keep
track of the lifetime of topological properties. In the barcode, each topological property is represented as a horizontal line segment. The line segments span the period that the
corresponding topological properties exist, along the parameter axis (i.e. radius). We use the barcode in Section 6.1 (see
Figure 2).

Proposed Pipeline

In this section, we introduce our pipeline. The first step is to
extract structured data—the set of symptoms and their corresponding patients—from the unstructured clinical records.
Next step is to define the feature space, the sampling strategy, and the metric to measure the similarity between the

data points. Finally, the topological properties are extracted
and are visualized.
Concept extraction: We carry out the concept extraction in
three steps: 1) We parse the clinical notes and map the biological terms to the concepts in a medical ontology. 2) Since
the clinical notes have informal language model their parsing can be noisy. Thus we ask the user to cure the candidate relations and resolve the inconsistencies. 3) We use the
health records to construct an association matrix between the
patients and the extracted concepts.
Natural language processing techniques are widely used
to analyze biomedical documents (Demner-Fushman, Chapman, and McDonald 2009; Koleck et al. 2019). Despite the
significant advances in neural text processing over the last
decade, we found that the existing methods are not adequate
to effectively parse the medical records. Thus, to reduce the
noise and ensure that the extracted terms are indeed valid
medical concepts we use manual supervision to validate the
automatic process.
Feature space construction: In our model, features correspond to the patients, and the data points correspond to the
combination of concepts–we call them patterns. Given a feature vector–i.e., a data point–a feature is set to 1 if the corresponding patient shows all the symptoms associated with
the data point. Thus, a data point is understood as a cluster of
patients, who share the same set of symptoms–i.e., pattern.
As mentioned in Section 2.1, pathways can be inferred
by identifying the redescriptions—i.e., patterns that have the
same group of patients. However, in order to make inference
about the underlying pathways, it is important to analyze the
patterns whose clusters are statistically significant.
Since tests such as Binomial are not successful in separating higher-order correlations, which can distinguish groups
of patients that identify disease processes from the impact
of pair-wise correlations, we use cumulant correlation expansions. In quantum field theory, they emerge as connected
Feynman diagrams (1-particle irreducible). These are multivariate moments related to cumulants appearing in statistics.
In that context, their generating functions factor according
to partitions of sets.
Let G• represent
P the moments in moment generating
functions E [exp ( i xi Ji )] where the Ji ’s are the conjugate
variables, and Γ• represent the higher dimensional cumulants, e.g. for the symptoms xi , xj , xk then Gij = E(xi xj )
and Gijkk = E(xi xj x2k ), and Γij and Γijkk are the corresponding cummulants. The factorizations are as follows.

where A is nominally 1, seen by setting the Ji = 0.
The power series in the Ji ’s then require
Gk = Γk
Gkk0 = Γkk0 + Γk Γk0
Gkk0 k00 = Γkk0 k00 + Γk Γk0 k00 + Γk0 Γk00 k + Γk00 Γkk0 + Γk Γk0 Γk00

2Γk0 Γk00 Γkk000 + 2Γk000 Γk00 Γkk0 + Γk Γk0 Γk00 Γk000

We apply the above factorization to the clusters, and shuffle the symptoms to test significance by constructing variances and null hypotheses.
To search for the redescriptions, we need to investigate
the cause–effect relationships among the selected patterns.
However, often due to the misclassifications of patients, e.g.,
caused by wrong diagnosis, the set inclusion property does
not hold in the data. Therefore, the exact equality of sets
should be estimated. This estimation can be done by Jaccard
distance, which measures the dissimilarity between sets. For
the two sets A and B, Jaccard distance is defined by,
d(A, B) = 1 −

For the example in Section 2.1, when P1 ⊆ P2 , then the
Jaccard distance d(P1 ∩ P2 , P1 ) = 0, otherwise if P1 6⊆ P2
then 0 < d(P1 ∩ P2 , P1 ) ≤ 1, which can be interpreted as
the probability that subjects picked from the two sets are not
shared.
Hence, we consider Jaccard distance to measure the distances between the sampled data points.
Topological analysis and visualization: To explore the
structure of the space created in the previous step, Vietoris–Rips (VR) complexes are employed to construct the
filtration. The VR complex is an abstract simplicial complex with 0-simplexes as the data points, and k-simplexes
are created for any k + 1 points whose pairwise distances
are at most 2r, while r is fixed.
The initial simplicial complex is a collection of 0simplexes which correspond to the sampled data points–i.e.,
the clusters of patients selected from the previous step–and
Jaccard distance is used as the filtration parameter to construct the VR complexes. Finally, the barcode is generated
and representative cycles of the bars are retrieved for further
analysis.

Implementation Details

To parse the clinical notes and extract the biomedical terms
we used Amazon Comprehend Medical (ACM)1 , an online proprietary NLP programming interface to analyze the
unstructured clinical notes. For technical details regarding
ACM see (Jin et al. 2018; Bhatia, Busra Celikkaya, and
1

https://aws.amazon.com/comprehend/medical/

Khalilia 2020). We also used the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10CM)2 to select the concepts, which
are mapped by ACM to the extracted terms. ICD is a medical ontology, published by the World Health Organization to
classify diseases, symptoms, and other medical conditions.
In the TDA step, we used Dionysus3 package for the construction of simplicial complexes and visualization. We also
incorporated the Cyclonysus4 implementation to retrieve the
representative cycles of the 1-dimensional topological properties.

Experimental Details

We begin this section by describing the dataset, then we discuss the steps of the experiment.

5.1

Dataset

We used the dataset introduced in (Xu et al. 2020)5 . The
dataset is continually updated with the available records of
confirmed COVID-19 patients. We used the version published on June 8, 2020. Among the available records in the
data set we retained all the records that their “symptom”
field was non-empty, this amounted to 1,545 patients. This
field, which is a textual feature, is a clinical note describing
the patient’s medical state.

5.2

Experimental Setup

ACM associates a list of ICD-10CM codes to each extracted
medical condition, ordered by their confidence scores, hence
we retained a code with the highest confidence score. We
only considered medical conditions that at least 0.3 percent of patients experienced. If the ICD-10CM codes associated to a medical condition were at the same level of
the hierarchical ontology and ACM was assigning high confidence scores to all of them, we considered them as one
class. An example of that includes R53. = {R53.1 :
Weakness, R53.81 : Malaise, R53.83 : Other fatigue}.
We retained the data corresponded to thirty-one ICD-10CM
codes. Based on the data Fever, Cough and Fatigue are the
most common symptoms among the COVID-19 patients.
Table 1 presents the list of selected classes and their number of patients, and Table 2 provides the number of patients
who experienced k medical conditions.
In the second step of the pipeline, we selected 632 data
points with patterns corresponded to the subsets of the thirtyone ICD-10CM codes. To construct the VR filtration, we set
the threshold of the filtration parameter to 0.5.

Main Result

We obtained topological properties of dimensions 0 and 1;
there was no topological property of higher dimensions. We
report an important 1-dimensional property which is striking.
As mentioned in Section 3, we used Jaccard distance.
Therefore, at any two data points, the lower the distance, the
more similar their sets of patients are. Following from this,
the topological properties whose 1-simplexes corresponded
to low distances were of interest.
Figure 2 shows the barcode of the 1-dimensional topological properties, whose lifetime is within the interval (0,
0.5). The horizontal axis corresponds to the parameter of
the filtration—Jaccard distance—and the vertical axis corresponds to the number of properties. With respect to the
previous paragraph, what stands out in the diagram is the
first bar annotated by the circled line, which spans between
0.23 and 0.34.

cycle generating the annotated bar is shown in Figure 3.
Data points are illustrated by their associated combination
of ICD-10CM codes along with the number of patients
who experienced them, and the 1-simplexes joining the data
points are labeled by the Jaccard distance between the respective sets of patients. Therefore, as an example, the label

experienced both Cough and Abnormal sputum. The low

values of the Jaccard distances imply stronger associations
among the respective clusters, which are important to identify the redescriptions. In particular, this cycle suggests that
among the subjects in R09.3–Abnormal sputum–it appears
that there is not a particular interaction between subjects in
R05–Cough–with subjects in R50.9–Fever. This opens the
question if there is a distinctive signature showing alternative pathways to disease among non-coughers compared to
coughers.

6.2

Discussion

To interpret the relationships between the symptoms in Figure 3 we rely on Jaccard distance. Since the equivalence of
sets of subjects matching different patterns produces logical constraints determined by biological processes, multiple
pathways connecting phenotypes to disease may yield information about multigenic complex diseases marked by multiple pathways leading to disease. However, phenotype definitions are prone to misclassification for numbers of reasons.
Therefore, equivalence may be meaningfully characterized
by based on the chances that a subject in one or the other of
two phenotype clusters is not in both of them, which is the
Jaccard distance, described above.

In the case of Figure 3, there are two paths leading
from R09.3 (abnormal sputum) to R05 ∩ R09.3 ∩ R50.9,
one passing through R09.3 ∩ R50.9 and the other through
R05 ∩ R09.3, where R05 is cough, and R50.9 is fever. In
both pathways, the distances between sputum and cough is
larger than that between sputum and fever. So coughing is
not as strong an association as fever for abnormal sputum
production. In this case, the relationship between sputum
and fever is independent of coughing, since the cycle appears to be a parallelogram. So a coughing symptom is independent of fever among sputum productive subjects. This
suggests the paths are independent predictors of severe disease.

Conclusions and Future Work

In this study we investigated the application of topological
properties in extracting the candidate COVID-19 pathways
from the clinical notes. We also proposed a pipeline to preprocess the data, extract the salient concepts, construct a
feature space, and visualize the results. We evaluated our
pipeline on a set of 1,545 patients and showed that it can extract meaningful associations between symptoms, and reveal
intriguing candidate pathways.
One limitation of our study is the reliance on human validation. As we mentioned in Section 3, the available text processing tools were not able to effectively parse and extract
the relevant medical concepts. To resolve this shortcoming
we plan to exploit the available structured data accompanied
by the medical records to cluster the patients and automatically filter out the improbable associations.
