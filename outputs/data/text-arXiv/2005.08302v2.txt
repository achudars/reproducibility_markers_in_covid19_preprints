Clinical Predictive Models for COVID-19:
Systematic Study

Index Terms— SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Interpretability

I. I NTRODUCTION
ORONAVIRUS Disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first discovered in December 2019 in China, and has since
rapidly spread to over 200 countries [1]. The COVID-19
pandemic challenges healthcare systems worldwide as a high
peak capacity for testing and hospitalisation is necessary to
diagnose and treat affected patients, particularly if the spread
of SARS-CoV-2 is not mitigated. To avoid exceeding the
available healthcare capacities, many countries have adopted
social distancing policies, imposed travel restrictions, and
postponed non-essential care and surgeries in order to reduce
peak demand on their healthcare systems [2], [3], [4].

Abstract— Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a
rapidly emerging respiratory disease caused by the severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Due to the rapid human-to-human transmission of SARSCoV-2, many healthcare systems are at risk of exceeding
their healthcare capacities, in particular in terms of SARSCoV-2 tests, hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) beds and
mechanical ventilators. Predictive algorithms could potentially ease the strain on healthcare systems by identifying
those who are most likely to receive a positive SARS-CoV-2
test, be hospitalised or admitted to the ICU. Here, we study
clinical predictive models that estimate, using machine
learning and based on routinely collected clinical data,
which patients are likely to receive a positive SARS-CoV-2
test, require hospitalisation or intensive care. To evaluate
the predictive performance of our models, we perform a
retrospective evaluation on clinical and blood analysis data
from a cohort of 5644 patients. Our experimental results
indicate that our predictive models identify (i) patients that
test positive for SARS-CoV-2 a priori at a sensitivity of 75%
(95% CI: 67%, 81%) and a specificity of 49% (95% CI: 46%,
51%), (ii) SARS-CoV-2 positive patients that require hospitalisation with 0.92 AUC (95% CI: 0.81, 0.98), and (iii) SARSCoV-2 positive patients that require critical care with 0.98
AUC (95% CI: 0.95, 1.00). In addition, we determine which
clinical features are predictive to what degree for each of
the aforementioned clinical tasks. Our results indicate that
predictive models trained on routinely collected clinical
data could be used to predict clinical pathways for COVID19, and therefore help inform care and prioritise resources.

Fig. 1: We study the use of predictive models (light purple)
to estimate whether patients are likely (i) to be SARS-CoV-2
positive, and whether SARS-CoV-2 positive patients are likely
(ii) to be admitted to the hospital and (iii) to require critical
care based on clinical, demographic and blood analysis data.
Accurate clinical predictive models stratify patients according
to individual risk, and, in this manner, help prioritise healthcare
resources, such as testing, hospital and critical care capacity.

The adoption of clinical predictive models that accurately
predict who is likely to require testing, hospitalisation and
intensive care from routinely collected clinical data could
potentially further reduce peak demand by ensuring resources
are prioritised to those individuals with the highest risk (Figure
1). For example, a clinical predictive model that accurately
identifies patients that are likely to test positive for SARSCoV-2 a priori could help prioritise limited SARS-CoV-2 testing capacity. However, developing accurate clinical prediction
models for SARS-CoV-2 is difficult as relationships between
clinical data, hospitalisation, and intensive care unit (ICU)
admission have not yet been established conclusively due to
the recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2.
In this systematic study, we develop and evaluate clinical
predictive models that use routinely collected clinical data to
identify (i) patients that are likely to receive a positive SARSCoV-2 test, (ii) SARS-CoV-2 positive patients that are likely to
require hospitalisation, and (iii) SARS-CoV-2 positive patients
that are likely to require intensive care. Using the developed
predictive models, we additionally determine which clinical
features are most predictive for each of the aforementioned
clinical tasks. Our results indicate that predictive models
could be used to predict clinical pathways for COVID-19
patients. Such predictive models may be of significant utility
for healthcare systems as preserving healthcare capacity has
been linked to successfully combating SARS-CoV-2 [5], [6].

II. R ELATED W ORK
A substantial body of work is dedicated to the study,
validation and implementation of predictive models for clinical
tasks. Clinical predictive models have, for example, been used
to predict risk of septic shock [7], [8], risk of heart failure
[9], readmission following heart failure [10], [11], [12], false
alarms in critical care [13], risk scores [14], outcomes [15]
and mortality in pneumonia [16], [17], and mortality risk
in critical care [18], [19], [20]. Predicting clinical outcomes
for individual patients is difficult because a large number
of confounding factors may influence patient outcomes, and
collecting and accounting for these factors in an unbiased
way remains an open challenge in clinical practice [21].
Systematic studies, such as the one presented in this work,
enable medical practitioners to better understand, assess and
potentially overcome these issues by systematically evaluating
generalisation ability, expected predictive performance, and
influential predictors of various clinical predictive models.
Beyond the need for systematic evaluation, missingness [22],
[23], [24], [25], noise [26], [27], multivariate input data [13],
[28], [29], [30], and the need for interpretability [31], [32],
[33], [34] have been highlighted as particularly important
considerations in healthcare settings. In this work, we build on
recent methodological advances to develop and systematically
study clinical predictive models that may aid in prioritising
healthcare resources [35] for COVID-19, and thereby help prevent a potential overextension of healthcare system capacity.
A. Clinical Predictive Models for COVID-19
Several clinical predictive models have recently been proposed for COVID-19, for example, for predicting potential
COVID-19 diagnoses using data from emergency care admission exams [36] and chest imaging data [37], [38], [39], [40],
[41], [42], for predicting COVID-19 related mortality from
clinical risk factors [43], [44], and for predicting which patients will develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
from patients’ clinical characteristics [45]. [46] presented a
review of epidemiology and clinical features associated with
COVID-19, and [47] a critical review that assessed limitations
and risk of bias in diagnostic and prognostic models for
COVID-19. In addition, [48] performed a cohort study for
clinical and laboratory predictors of COVID-19 related inhospital mortality that identified baseline neutrophil count, age

and several other clinical features as top predictors of mortality. Beyond prediction, [49] have argued for the responsible
use of data in tackling the challenges posed by SARS-CoV-2.
Owing to the recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2, there currently exists, to the best of our knowledge, no prior systematic
study on clinical predictive models that predict likelihood of
a positive SARS-CoV-2 test, hospital and intensive care unit
admission from clinical, demographic and blood analysis data
that accounts for the missingness that is characteristic for the
clinical setting. We additionally assess the influence of various
clinical, demographic, and blood analysis measurements on the
predictions of the developed clinical predictive models.
III. M ETHODS AND M ATERIALS
1) Problem Setting: In the given setting, we are given 106
routine clinical, laboratory and demographic measurements,
or features, xi ∈ x for presenting patients. Features may be
discrete or continuous, and some features may be missing
as not all tests are necessarily performed on all patients.
The clinical predictive tasks consist of utilising the routine
clinical features xi to predict, for a newly presenting patient,
(i) the likelihood ŷSARS-CoV-2 of receiving a positive SARSCoV-2 test result, (ii) the likelihood ŷadmission of requiring
hospital admission, and the (iii) likelihood ŷICU of requiring
intensive care. In addition, we are given a development dataset
consisting of N patients, their corresponding observed routine
clinical features xi , SARS-CoV-2 test results ySARS-CoV-2 ∈
{0, 1}, hospital admissions yadmission ∈ {0, 1}, and ICU admissions yICU ∈ {0, 1}, where 1 indicates the presence of an
outcome. Using this development dataset, our goal is to derive
clinical predictive models fˆSARS-CoV-2 , fˆadmission and fˆICU for
the respective before-mentioned tasks in order to inform care
and help prioritise scarce healthcare resources.

2) Methodology: To derive the clinical predictive models
fˆSARS-CoV-2 , fˆadmission and fˆICU from the given development
dataset, we set up a systematic model development, validation,
and evaluation pipeline (Fig. 2). To evaluate the generalisation ability of the developed clinical predictive models and

SCHWAB et al.: CLINICAL PREDICTIVE MODELS FOR COVID-19: SYSTEMATIC STUDY (2020)

to rule out overfitting to patients in the evaluation cohort,
the development data is initially split into independent and
stratified training, validation, and test folds without any patient
overlap. Concretely, the multistage pipeline consists of (i)
preprocessing, (ii) model development, (iii) model selection,
and (iv) model evaluation stages. For preprocessing and model
development, only the training fold is used, and only the
validation and test folds of the development data are used for
model selection and model evaluation, respectively. We outline
the pipeline stages in detail in the following paragraphs.
3) Preprocessing: In the preprocessing stage, we first drop
all input features that are missing for more than 99.8% of all
training set patients to ensure we have a minimal amount of
data for each feature. This removes a total of 9 features from
the original 106 routine clinical, laboratory and demographic
features. We then transform all discrete features for each
patient into their one-hot encoded representation with one out
of p indicator variables set to 1 to indicate the discrete value
for this patient, and all others set to 0 with p being the number
of unique values for the discrete feature. We defined those
features as discrete that have fewer than 6 unique values across
all patients in the training fold. For discrete features, missing
features were counted as a separate category in the one hot
representation. Next, we standardised all continuous features
to have zero mean and unit standard deviation across the
training fold data. Lastly, we performed multiple imputation
by chained equations (MICE) to impute all missing values
of every continuous feature from the respective other features
in an iterative fashion [50]. We additionally added a missing
indicator that indicates 1 if the feature was imputed by
MICE and 0 if it was originally present in order to preserve
missingness information in the data after imputation. After the
preprocessing stage, continuous input features are standardised
and fully imputed, and discrete input features are one-hot
encoded. All preprocessing operations are derived only from
the training fold, and naïvely applied without adjustment to
validation and test folds in order to avoid information leakage.
4) Model Development: In the model development stage, we
train candidate clinical predictive models fˆSARS-CoV-2 , fˆadmission
and fˆICU using supervised learning on the training fold of the
preprocessed data. To derive the models from the preprocessed
training fold data, we optimise various types of predictive
models, and perform a hyperparameter search with m runs
for each of them. The model development process yields m
candidate models with different hyperparameter choices and
predictive performances for each model category.
5) Model Selection: In order to select the best model
amongst the set of candidate models, we evaluate their predictive performance against the held-out validation fold that
had not been used for model development. We choose the
top candidate model by ranking all models by their evaluated
predictive performance. The model selection stage using the
independent validation fold enables us to optimise hyperparameters without utilising test fold data.
6) Model Evaluation: In the model evaluation stage, we
evaluate the selected best clinical predictive model against
the held-out test fold that had not been used neither for
training nor model selection in order to estimate the expected

generalisation error of the models on previously unseen data.
Using this approach, every selected best model from the model
selection stage is evaluated exactly once against the test fold.
Using the presented standardised model development, selection and evaluation pipeline, we compare various types
of clinical predictive models in the same test setting, with
exactly the same amount of hyperparameter optimisation and
input features against the same test fold. This process enables
us to systematically study the expected generalisation ability,
predictive performance and influential features of clinical
predictive models for predicting SARS-CoV-2 test results,
hospital admission for SARS-CoV-2 positive patients, and ICU
admission for SARS-CoV-2 positive patients.
IV. E XPERIMENTS
We conducted retrospective experiments to evaluate the
predictive performance of a number of clinical predictive
models on each of the presented clinical prediction tasks
using the standardised development, validation and evaluation
pipeline. Concretely, our experiments aimed to answer the
following questions:
1 What is the expected predictive performance of the various clinical predictive models in predicting (i) SARSCoV-2 test results for presenting patients, (ii) hospital
admission for SARS-CoV-2 positive patients, and (iii)
ICU admission for SARS-CoV-2 positive patients?
2 Which clinical, demographic and blood analysis features
were most important for the respective best encountered
predictive models for each clinical prediction task?
The following subsections describe the conducted experimental evaluation in detail.
A. Dataset and Study Cohort
We used anonymised data from a cohort of 5644 patients
seen at the Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein in São Paulo,

B. Models
Using the presented systematic evaluation methodology, we
trained five different model types: Logistic Regression (LR),
Neural Network (NN), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector
Machine (SVM), and Gradient Boosting (XGB) [52]. The NN
was a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) consisting of L hidden
layers with N hidden units each followed by a non-linear
activation function (ReLU [53], SELU [54], or ELU [55]) and
batch normalisation [56], and was trained using the Adam
optimiser [57] for up to 300 epochs with an early stopping
patience of 12 epochs on the validation set loss.

Brazil in the early months of 20201 . Over the data collection
time frame, the rate of SARS-CoV-2 positive patients at the
hospital was around 10% of which around 6.5% and 2.5%
required hospitalisation and critical care, respectively (Table I).
Notably, younger patients were underrepresented in the SARSCoV-2 positive group relative to the general patient population
which may have been caused by the reportedly more severe
disease progression in older patients [51]. Information on
patient sex was not included in our dataset. We randomly
split the entire available patient cohort into training (50%),
validation (20%) and test folds (30%) within strata of patient
age, SARS-CoV-2 test result, hospital admission status, and
ICU admission status. After stratification, the three folds were
approximately balanced across the stratification dimensions.

C. Hyperparameters
We followed an unbiased, systematic approach to hyperparameter selection and optimisation. For each type of clinical
predictive model, we performed a maximum of 30 hyperparameter optimisation runs with hyperparameters chosen from
predefined ranges (Table II). The performance of each hyperparameter optimisation run was evaluated against the validation cohort. After computing the validation set performance,
we selected the best candidate predictive model across the 30
hyperparameter optimisation runs by area under the receiver
operator curve for further evaluation against the test set.
D. Metrics
1) Predictive Performance: To assess the predictive performance of each of the developed clinical predictive models,
we evaluated their performance in terms of area under the
receiver operator curve (AUC), area under the precision recall
curve (AUPR), sensitivity, specificity, and specificity at greater
than 95% sensitivity (Spec.@95%Sens.) on the held-out test
set cohorts for each task (Table I). After model development
and hyperparameter optimisation, we evaluated each model
type exactly once against the test set to calculate the final
performance metrics. Operating thresholds for each model
were the operating points on the receiver operator characteristic curve closest to the top left coordinate as calculated for
the validation cohort. We chose a variety of complementary
evaluation metrics in order to give a comprehensive picture of
1 Exact data collection dates are unknown. The dataset is available at
https://www.kaggle.com/einsteindata4u/covid19

the expected performance of each clinical predictive model on
the evaluated tasks. For each of the performance metrics, we
additionally computed 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using
bootstrap resampling with 100 bootstrap samples on the test
set cohort in order to quantify the uncertainty of our analysis
results. We also assessed whether differences between clinical
predictive models were statistically significant at significance
level α = 0.05 using pairwise t-tests with the respective best
models for each task as measured by AUC.
2) Importance of Test Types: To quantify the importance of
specific clinical, demographic and blood analysis features on
each of the predicted outcomes, we utilised causal explanation
(CXPlain) models [34]. CXPlain provides standardised relative
feature importance attributions for any predictive model by
computing the marginal contribution of each input feature
towards the predictive performance of a model [58], and is
therefore particularly well-suited for assessing feature importance in our diverse set of models. We used the test fold’s
ground truth labels to compute the exact marginal contribution
of each input feature without any estimation uncertainty.
V. R ESULTS
A. Predictive Performance
In terms of predictive performance (Table III), we found
that the overall best identified models by AUC were XGB for
predicting SARS-CoV-2 test results, RF for predicting hospital
admissions for SARS-CoV-2 positive patients, and SVM for
predicting ICU admission for SARS-CoV-2 positive patients

more difficult task for clinical predictive models than predicting hospitalisation and ICU admission. Nonetheless, the best
encountered clinical predictive model for predicting SARSCoV-2 test results (XGB) achieved a respectable sensitivity
of 75% (95% CI: 67%, 81%) and specificity of 49% (95%
CI: 46%, 51%). After fixing the operating threshold of the
model to meet a sensitivity level of at least 95% (Spec.@95%
Sens.), the best XGB model for predicting SARS-CoV-2 test
results would achieve a specificity of 23% (95% CI: 7%,
32%). We additionally found that the differences in predictive
performance between the best XGB model for predicting
SARS-CoV-2 test results and the other predictive models was
significant at a pre-specified significance level of α = 0.05 (ttest) for all but the AUPR metric, where NN achieved a significantly better AUPR of 0.22 and the difference to SVM was not
significant at the pre-specified significance level. On the task
of predicting hospital admissions for SARS-CoV-2 positive
patients, the best encountered RF model achieved a sensitivity
of 55% (95% CI: 19%, 85%), a high specificity of 96% (95%

CI: 92%, 98%), and a specificity at a fixed sensitivity of at
least 95% (Spec.@95% Sens.) of 34% (95% CI: 29%, 97%).
Owing to the lower sample size due to the smaller cohort
of SARS-CoV-2 positive patients, the performance results for
predicting hospital admission generally had wider uncertainty
bounds but were nonetheless significantly better for RF than
the other predictive models at the pre-specified significance
level of α = 0.05 (t-test) for most performance metrics with
the exception of AUC where XGB achieved an AUC of 0.91
and AUPR where LR achieved an AUPR of 0.44. On the
task of predicting ICU admission for SARS-CoV-2 positive
patients, SVM had a sensitivity of 80% (95% CI: 36%, 100%),
a specificity of 96% (95% CI: 92%, 98%), and a specificity at
a fixed sensitivity of at least 95% (Spec.@95% Sens.) of 95%
(95% CI: 91%, 100%). Due to the small percentage of around
3% of SARS-CoV-2 positive patients that were admitted to
the ICU (Table I), uncertainty bounds were wider than for
the models predicting hospital admissions, and the results of
the best encountered SVM were found to be not significantly
better than LR and RF in terms of AUC, LR and NN in terms
of sensitivity, and NN in terms of Spec.@95% Sens. at the
pre-specified significance level of α = 0.05 (t-test).

B. Feature Importance
In terms of feature importance, we found that importance
scores were distributed highly unequally, relatively uniform
and highly uniform for the best models encountered for
predicting SARS-CoV-2 test results, for predicting hospital
admissions for SARS-CoV-2 positive patients, and for predicting ICU admission, respectively (Figure 4). Most notably,
we found that 71.7% of the importance for the best XGB
model for predicting SARS-CoV-2 test results was assigned
to the missing indicator corresponding to the Arterial Lactic
Acid measurement, i.e. much of the marginal predictive performance gain of the XGB model was attributed to whether or
not the Arterial Lactic Acid test had been ordered. Beyond
Arterial Lactic Acid being missing, age, leukocyte count,
platelet count, and creatinine were implied to be associated
with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result by the best encountered predictive model, which further substantiates recent
independent reports of those factors being potentially associated with SARS-CoV-2 [59], [60], [61], [62], [48]. Similarly
to the best encountered XGB model for predicting SARSCoV-2 test results, the top encountered predictive models
for hospital admission and ICU admission for SARS-CoV-2
positive patients assigned a considerable degree of importance
to missingness patterns associated with a number of measurements. A possible explanation for missingness appearing as
a top predictor across the different tasks is that decisions
whether or not to order a certain test to be performed for
a given patient were influenced by patient characteristics that
were not captured in the set of clinical measurements that
were available to the predictive models. A controlled setting
with standardised testing guidelines would be required to
determine which confounding factors are behind the predictive
power of the missingness patterns that have been implied
to be associated with COVID-19 by the predictive models.
Beyond missingness patterns, top predictors for predicting
hospital admission were lactate dehydrogenase [63], gammaglutamyltransferase, which through abnormal liver function
has been reported to be implicated in COVID-19 severity [64],
and HCO3 [65]. For predicting ICU admission in SARS-CoV2 positive patients, pCO2 and pH [48] were top predictors.
Blood pH, and in particular respiratory alkalosis, has been
reported to be associated with severe COVID-19 [66].
VI. D ISCUSSION
We presented a systematic study of predictive models
that predict SARS-CoV-2 test results, hospital admission for
SARS-CoV-2 positive patients, and ICU admission for SARSCoV-2 positive patients using routinely collected clinical measurements. Models that predict SARS-CoV-2 test results could
help prioritise scarce testing capacity by identifying those
individuals that are more likely to receive a positive result.
Similarly, predictive models that predict which SARS-CoV2 positive patients would be most likely to require hospital
and critical care beds could help better utilise existing hospital
capacity by prioritising those patients that have the highest risk
of deterioration. Facilitating the efficient utilisation of scarce
healthcare resources is particularly important in dealing with

Fig. 3: A comparison of the top-10 features ranked by relative
feature importance scores for the best encountered model
for predicting SARS-CoV-2 test results (XGB, top), hospital
admission for SARS-CoV-2 positive patients (RF, middle),
and critical care admission for SARS-CoV-2 positive patients
(SVM, bottom), respectively. The bar length corresponds to the
relative marginal importance (in %) of the displayed features
towards the predictive performance of the respective model.
Feature names that include an all-caps "MISSING" indicate
that the given marginal contribution refers to the importance
of the absence or presence of that feature, not the feature itself.

SARS-CoV-2 as its rapid transmission significantly increases
demand for healthcare services worldwide.
The main limitation of the presented study is that its
experimental evaluation was based on data collected from a
single study site, and its results may therefore not generalise
to settings with significantly different patient populations,
admission criteria, patterns of missingness, and testing guidelines. In addition, we did not have access to mortality data
for the analysed cohort, and we were therefore not able to
correlate our predicted individual risk scores with patient
mortality, which is another related prediction task that may
be of clinical importance. Future studies should include a
broader set of clinical measurements and outcomes, cohorts
from multiple distinct geographical sites and under varying
patterns of missingness in order to determine the robustness
of the clinical predictive models to these confounding factors.
Finally, we believe that the inclusion of data from other modalities, such as genomic profiling and medical imaging, and data
on co-morbidities, symptoms and treatment histories could

VII. C ONCLUSION
We presented a systematic study in which we developed
and evaluated clinical predictive models for COVID-19 that
estimate (i) the likelihood of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test in
patients presenting at hospitals, (ii) the likelihood of hospital
admission and (iii) intensive care unit admission in SARSCoV-2 positive patients. We evaluated our developed clinical
predictive models in a retrospective evaluation using a cohort of 5644 hospital patients seen in São Paulo, Brazil. In
addition, we determined the clinical, demographic and blood
analysis measurements that were most important for accurately
predicting SARS-CoV-2 status, hospital admissions, and ICU
admissions. Our experimental results indicate that clinical
predictive models may in the future potentially be used to
inform care and help prioritise scarce healthcare resources by
assigning personalised risk scores for individual patients using
routinely collected clinical, demographic and blood analysis
data. Furthermore, our findings on the importance of routine
clinical measurements towards predicting clinical pathways
for patients increase our understanding of the interrelations
of individual risk profiles and outcomes in SARS-CoV-2.
Based on our study’s results, we conclude that healthcare
systems should explore the use of predictive models that assess
individual COVID-19 risk in order to improve healthcare
resource prioritisation and inform patient care.
