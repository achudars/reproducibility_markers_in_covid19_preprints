Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic has affected people’s lives around
the world at a unprecedented scale. To investigate the hoarding behaviors in response to the pandemic, we propose a
novel computational framework using large scale social media data. First, we collect hoarding-related tweets shortly after
the outbreak of the corona virus. Next, we analyze the hoarding and anti-hoarding patterns of over 42,000 Twitter users
in the United States from February 1 to April 30 and dissect
the hoarding-related tweets by age, gender, and geographic
location. With the proposed computational framework, we
derive significant findings, e.g. the percentage of females in
both hoarding and anti-hoarding groups is higher than that of
the general Twitter users. Furthermore, using topic modeling,
we investigate the opinions expressed about the hoarding behavior by categorizing these topics according to demographic
and geographic groups. We also calculate the anxiety scores
for the hoarding and anti-hoarding related tweets using a lexical approach. By comparing their anxiety scores with the
typical Twitter anxiety score, we reveal further insights. The
LIWC anxiety mean for the hoarding related tweets is significantly higher than the general Twitter anxiety mean. Interestingly, beer has the highest calculated anxiety score compared
to other hoarded items mentioned in the tweets.

Introduction
The study of consumer behaviors examines the processes
that individuals or groups experience when they purchase
or use products in order to meet their needs (Arndt et al.
2004). Shopping patterns, as a part of consumer behaviors,
refer to the typical way in which people buy goods or services. Historically, marketing research has relied on questionnaires and focus groups to measure or analyze shopping
patterns (Sim and Koi 2002). The COVID-19 pandemic provides a golden opportunity to study consumer behaviors during a massive crisis and discover insights that would otherwise be difficult to attain during normal times.
Past literature has primarily examined hoarding behaviors
using interviews or surveys, largely limited to small-scale
observations. The rise of social media, in contrast, provides
an opportunity to investigate hoarding behaviors at scale and
in real-time. Computational methods have become a cuttingedge way to study social science. Computer scientists use
data-driven approaches such as machine learning and natural language processing to find out what consumers are talk-

ing about on social media platforms like Twitter. It is a new
and effective window into people’s shopping behaviors since
many individuals share information about recent purchases
on Twitter1 . Meanwhile, the advances in data mining allow
us to classify consumers based on their tweets (e.g. hoarding vs. anti-hoarding consumers) and test our hypotheses at
scale and in real time.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, social media has acted
as a double-edged sword: while it is a rich source for obtaining useful information concerning the pandemic, it also
shapes the fears. For instance, when posts of panic-buying
(e.g. toilet paper, hand sanitizer) proliferate on social media
platforms, people might make panic purchases after seeing
such posts. It is unclear how hoarding behaviors expressed
on social media differ from hoarding behaviors documented
before. In addition, it is not known whether tweeted shopping behaviors adequately reflect the shift in actual panic
buying behaviors since the COVID-19 outbreak. We build
our hypotheses on the notion that panic buying behavior differs across gender, age and family status during unstable
times (Hori and Iwamoto 2014). In addition, we hypothesize that geographic location impacts what items to hoard
(e.g. urban vs. rural; coastal vs. inland states). By analyzing the emotions, attitudes, and opinions of adults within a
three-month period, we hope to have a more comprehensive
understanding of why and what consumers hoarded.
This study uses Twitter data during the COVID-19 pandemic to investigate hoarding-related tweets. To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine hoarding behaviors
using social media. In particular, this study makes several
contributions:
• We present a computational framework and describe its
components for utilizing Twitter as a novel and effective
mechanism to study consumer behaviors.
• We demonstrate that the hoarding behaviors during the
COVID-19 pandemic differ across age, gender, and geographic location.
• We further examine the anxiety scores of the tweets using a lexical approach (Pennebaker et al. 2015) and topic

modeling so that we can correlate the anxiety scores, the
topics with the COVID-19 case data.

Related Work
Hoarding was originally termed as “compulsive hoarding
behavior”. Hoarding behavior is the acquisition of and failure to discard a large number of possessions that seem to
be useless or of limited value (Frost and Hartl 1996). Researchers have applied this definition to studying hoarding
behavior over the years (Tolin et al. 2008). However, most
of the studies documented clinical hoarding behaviors. The
hoarding behavior we discuss in this paper is more related
to the behavior known as panic buying, rather than hoarding
disorder.
People have an increased drive toward hoarding behaviors
in times of crisis. Stiff, Johnson, and Tourk (1975) compared the characteristics and reasons of consumer hoarding
behaviors between an affluent society and during financial
stress or war. People hoard high priced products (e.g. precious metals, currencies, etc.) in the affluent society, while
people hoard low priced products during financial stress.
Since hoarding is rarely studied during normal times, substantial research has examined people’s panic buying behaviors during unstable economic times (e.g., epidemics, hurricanes, earthquakes, and so on). Hori and Iwamoto (2014)
documented how people changed their consumption behaviors after the 2011 Tohoku earthquake by examining 12,000
households’ purchase data two months before and after the
earthquake. They found that households with a larger family size, households in urban areas, and households with
middle-aged or older-aged housewives are more likely to engage in hoarding purchases. In addition, American families
hoarded for canned goods and bottles of water during the
Cuban missile crisis in 1962. Consumers in Taiwan hoard
seasonal fruits and vegetables every typhoon season (Zanna
and Rempel 1988).
There is also evidence that individuals’ behaviors differ
between age and geographical location. The Life Course
Theory can be used to explain age differences in hoarding
behavior. The Life Course Theory concerns the human life
history and its development over time with an emphasis on
the social and historical trajectories that impact an individual’s life cycle (Giele and Elder 1998). The life course refers
to “social patterns in the timing, duration, spacing, and order
of events and roles.” Individual time, also called ontogenetic
time, is based on an individual’s chronological age, but it
also assumes that periods of life (including childhood, adolescence, adulthood, and old age) affect the social positions,
roles, and rights of the individual (Binstock et al. 2011). The
life course perspective locates individuals in age cohorts and
thus in historical context, depicts their age-differentiated life
patterns in relation to this context, and illumines the continual interplay between the social course of lives and development (Elder Jr and Rockwell 1979). In contrast, generational time draws attention to the experiences of groups or
cohorts of people based on their age. For instance, in the
years immediately following the World War II, many countries experienced a “baby boom,” a temporary, faster-thanexpected increase in birth rates from 1946 to 1964 (Rice

et al. 2011). While the Baby Boomers’ consumer behavior
has been extensively researched over the last 70 years, scholars have paid less attention to other age groups. Other contexts addressed by the Life Course Theory that may affect
age changes and/or age differences in hoarding behaviors
are Historical Time (e.g. events that could differently affect
people of different ages, such as economic crises or wars),
Space or Geographical Location, and Linked Lives (e.g. the
interconnected relationship networks within which purchasing decisions are made). Despite the importance of time and
context on individuals’ development and their family life ,
research on consumer behavior from a life course perspective is relatively limited.
Online behaviors, such as the ones detected on Twitter
are representative of real human behaviors. Bekafigo and
McBride (2013) found that online political activists are identical to offline activists, which means that offline political
activists are frequently the ones who have high levels of political participation on Twitter. Another study conducted by
Proserpio, Counts, and Jain (2016) examined the relationship between psychological well-being and unemployment
using 1.2 billion Twitter posts concerning job loss or job
gain from 2010 to 2015. The study showed that social media
posts are better at explaining the causes and consequences
of unemployment than traditional economic models. In addition, Researchers have been studying psychological language to analyze social economic issues using Twitter. For
instance, Eichstaedt et al. (2015) conducted a study to examine the relationship between psychological language on
Twitter and heart disease mortality. The authors regressed
heart disease mortality on the dictionary and topic language
variables, holding income and education constant, and found
the correlation between psychological language and heart
disease mortality are significant.

Data Collection and Preprocessing
Twitter data is collected from Crimson Hexagon, which is a
social media analytic platform. We use hashtags (#panicbuying, #panicpurchasing, #hoarding) and keywords (“panic
buying”, “panic purchasing”, “panic hoarding”, “hoarding”, “panic-buying”, “panic-hoarding”, “panic shopping”,
“panic buy”, “panic purchase”) to extract tweets. A total of
1,569,766 tweets describing hoarding behaviors from February 1, 2020 to April 30, 2020 are successfully downloaded.
The features include the tweet ID, the screen name of the
author, tweet content, the date the tweet was posted, and the
location. There are 1,053,479 distinct Twitter users. Since
our study is focused on the consumers living in the U.S.,
we drop the data of the Twitter users who are living outside
the U.S. There are 231,569 distinct US Twitter users in the
dataset.
To characterize the Twitter users, we use the Twitter API
to obtain information from the Twitter users’ personal profiles. The Twitter user’s name, user ID, location information,
profile photo, and personal description are downloaded. As
suggested by An and Weber (2016), we apply Face++2 , an
image recognition platform, to infer attributes including the
2

number of faces, gender, and age. People may use photos
of themselves or group photos. We keep the profile images
where there is only one intelligible face. We also eliminate
the tweets not written in English. The size of this dataset is
42,839 users.
To obtain more insights into the geo-locations of the tweet
authors, we separate them according to the population density in their locations and whether they are located in coastal
or inland states. For the population density, we use a Python
package3 called uszipcode to classify the tweet author into
three groups – urban (over 3,000 people per square mile) ,
suburban (1,000 – 3,000 people per square mile), and rural
(less than 1,000 people per square area).
In the end, our dataset includes 42,839 distinct US Twitter
users with four inferred features including age, gender, population density, and whether the consumer lives in coastal or
inland states.

Analysis Results
Categorization of Groups: Mentions Hoarding
versus Anti-Hoarding
It is possible that the tweets that mentioned “hoarding” or
“panic buying” are the ones that actually ask people to stop
hoarding or panic buying. To find these tweets and their authors, we lemmatize the tweet contents and apply a simple
rule-based method. If the word “stop”, “don’t panic”, “no
need” or “no panic” is in the tweets, then this tweet and the
author are labeled as “anti-hoarding”. 10.8% of consumers
are labeled as “anti-hoarding”. To check the validity of this
method, we sample 100 tweets from the set that we label as
“anti-hoarding” and 100 tweets from the set which we label as “hoarding”, and manually label them. Of 100 tweets
that are labeled as “anti-hoarding”, 98% express the idea of
anti-hoarding, and 2% do not. Of 100 tweets that are labeled as “hoarding”, 84% do not express the idea of antihoarding while 16% do. This suggests that the method is
sufficient to find the consumers who are against hoarding.
Therefore, we separate the dataset into two groups: tweets
mentioning hoarding or panic buying (Hoarding Group, HG)
and Anti-Hoarding Group (AHG). There are 38,207 users in
HG and 4,632 users in AHG. Descriptive statistics for HG
and AHG are reported in Table 1. We perform statistical
analysis with the datasets to investigate the characteristics
of the consumers who posted tweets mentioning hoarding or
panic buying (Hoarding Group, HG) and the consumers who
posted tweets suggesting that people stop hoarding or panic
buying (Anti-Hoarding Group, AHG).

Demographic Differences of the Group
We perform a goodness-of-fit test and find sufficient evidence to conclude that the age distributions of HG and
AHG are statistically different (p < .001). The authors of
AHG are older than the authors of HG. For HG, we find
that the percentage of older hoarders (12.8%) who are more
than 55 years old is lower than the percentage of the older
3

https://pypi.org/project/uszipcode/

adults in the general twitter users (28%), while the percentage of younger hoarders (57.4%) who are between 18 and
35 years old are more than the twitter general users (35%).
As the college students fall into this group and Twitter is
heavily used by college students (Junco and Mastrodicasa
2007), this may suggest that college students actively expressed their hoarding behaviors when they stay at home after their colleges abruptly shut down since mid-March. Similarly, middle-aged adults who are between 36 and 54 years
old actively post hoarding related tweets more than usual
while they work from home. Also, we find that hoarders in
this period also exhibit the characteristics of herd behavior (Watts and Dodds 2007; Spiller and Belogolova 2017),
which means that people may hoard products because they
are affected by other people who are hoarding in the grocery
stores.
Comparing with the gender distribution of US twitter
users as of January 20204 , we find that the gender distributions of HG/AHG demonstrate a significant female bias:
The percentage of the female hoarders (54.4%) is higher
than the female authors in the general Twitter users (43.8%).
Similarly, the percentage of female anti-hoarders (54.7%)
is higher than the female authors in general Twitter users
(43.8%).
According to the reported locations of Twitter users,
we classify the consumers into three different community
groups. Most authors are from urban areas (constituting
80.5%). 10.0% are from suburban areas and 9.5% are from
rural areas. After performing the goodness-of-fit test, we
find that the population distributions are statistically different between AHG and HG (p < .001). The result is in
line with the study of Hori and Iwamoto (2014), which also
shows that a majority of hoarders are from urban areas.
In addition, we separate the consumers into coastal and
inland groups based on their self-reported locations. After
performing the proportion z test, we find that the proportion of the authors living in the coastal states of AHG is
statistically higher than that of the tweet authors living in
the inland states (p < .001). For each group, the consumers
living in the coastal states constitute the majority: there are
86.8% consumers of NHG living in the coastal states, while
that of HG is 83.8%. The consumers living in coastal states
tend to post tweets that tell people to stop hoarding or panic
buying. One possible reason is that residents of the coastal
states are relatively more affluent or educated than those
of inland states.5 There are also more online shoppers than
mall-shoppers in the coastal states.6
Therefore, consumers that live in the coastal states may
buy products online instead of going to the stores to hoard.

Tweet Content Analysis using Topic Modelling
To find out what the consumers focus on, we have used Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify probable topics
of the tweets of HG. Table 2 shows the 3 topics generated by
LDA and the top 10 keywords of each topic. We manually
assign a topic name for each topic. As we can see from the
table, the consumers of HG are mainly concerned with toilet
paper, food and shortage.
The LDA model assigns weights to the three topics of
each individual tweet. The topic with the highest weight is
the dominant topic of this tweet. To better understand the
characteristics of the consumers in HG and their opinions,
we analyze the number of the tweets of the dominant topics
across demographics and the geo-locations, and we investigate the temporal change in the proportion of the dominant topics. Figure 1 shows the smoothed temporal change
of the proportion of the dominant topics of HG. Food was
always the primary topic within HG during this time period. The proportions of the other two topics decreased as the
pandemic developed. Discussions about toilet paper were at
peak around the mid of March. This trend is consistent with
the actual purchasing behaviors documented by the news,
which states that the panic behavior moved from toilet paper
to meat starting from the mid of March7 . Another interesting
finding is that the discussions about toilet paper increased a
little after April 20 and decreased in around 10 day. This is
probably due to the restock of the toilet paper. According to
the data Reuters reported from NCSolutions, about 73 percent of US stores were out of toilet paper on April 12; the
number went down to 48 percent by April 198 .

Figure 1: Temporal change in the proportion of the dominant
topics of HG.
that the distributions of the topics of the three age groups
are statistically different (p < .001). The “18-35” age group
tends to have a more diverse distribution of topics: 56.0%
talk about food, 25.2% talk about toilet paper and 18.7%
talk about shortage. However, the topics are more consistent
in the other two age groups. 70.2% and 73.9% consumers of
the “36-55” and the “over 56” age groups, respectively, talk
about food.

Age In all three age groups, the major topic was food, suggesting that food was the priority concern of the consumers
of all ages. By performing the goodness-of-fit test, we find

Gender Food was the dominant topic across both genders. According to the goodness-of-fit test, the distributions
of topics across the gender groups are statistically different (p < .001). The distribution of topics among females
is more diverse. 58.1% females talk about food, 23.7% talk
about toilet paper, and the final 18.2% talk about shortage.
Males also pay more attention to food. 67.8% of males talk
about food, 14.4% are concerned with toilet paper. The proportion of the males that talk about shortage is only 17.8%,
which is relatively lower than that of females.

Population Density With respect to the population density, there are statistical differences (p < .001) between the
distributions of the topics of the consumers living in the urban, suburban and rural areas. However, the differences are
small. Across all three groups, the major topic is food. By

performing the goodness-of-fit test, we find there is sufficient evidence (p < .001) to conclude that the distributions
of topics of the consumers living in the coastal states and inland states are different. However, similar to the analysis of
population density, the differences are not big. Within both
groups, the major topic is food.

Sentiment Analysis using a Lexical Approach
LIWC is a lexical approach to sentiment analysis using
its internal lexicons (Pennebaker et al. 2015). LIWC has
also been applied in previous studies to conduct sentiment
analysis using social media data (Chen et al. 2020). Although LIWC has several sentiment categories, we have
selected four major sentiment categories (positive emotion, negative emotion, anger, and anxiety) for our analysis.
The LIWC2015 document guide presents the anxiety mean
score for English Twitter data calculated using six genres
of texts (Pennebaker et al. 2015)9 . We use these as a baseline to compare the linguistic and sentiment scores for each
category. We refer to the means as “LIWC Twitter mean”
and “LIWC Grand mean” in the results, respectively10 . In
addition, we have also calculated the LIWC mean for the
hoarding related tweets. We referred to this mean as “LIWC
Calculated Anxiety Hoarding Mean” and “LIWC Calculated
Anxiety Anti-Hoarding Mean” respectively11 .
Table 3 shows the summary profiles for hoarding and
anti-hoarding related tweets. T-test shows that hoarding
tweets have a significantly higher future-focused and past
focused score (p < .05) than anti-hoarding tweets (p <
.05), while anti-hoarding tweets have a significantly higher
present than hoarding tweets (p < .001). To better understand the difference, we follow Gunsch et al. (2000) to analyze four pronoun scores and time orientation scores together. The anti-hoarding tweets have more other references
(“she/he”, “they”) than hoarding tweets, while they have
fewer self-references such as “we”, we can infer that the
tweets of anti-hoarding tweets focus on past and present actions of others more than the typical tweets.
The LIWC results for positive emotion are much lower
than the LIWC means and LIWC Twitter means. As Table 3 shows, the calculated means for the negative emotions
of hoarding and anti-hoarding tweets are both much higher
than the LIWC mean and LIWC Twitter means. This sug9

of texts (Blogs, Expressive writing, Novels, Natural Speech, NY
times, Twitter).

gests that hoarding-related tweets show a higher negative
emotion level compared to the LIWC averages and LIWC
general tweets averages. As for anxiety, the sentiment scores
for both hoarding and anti-hoarding tweets are much higher
than the LIWC means. This indicates that both hoarding and
anti-hoarding tweets express a high level of anxiety, which is
in line with previous research showing that anxiety is one of
the core reasons to hoard (Darrat, Darrat, and Amyx 2016).
To cover as many food-related keywords as possible, the
Food Pyramid (of Agriculture 1992) and the What We Eat
in America (WWEIA) list (Service 2010) are used as reference lists to extract the items from the food hoarding related
tweets. We analyze the food items that are mentioned in over
100 hoarding related tweets. As can be seen from Figure 2,
we find that beer has a significantly higher calculated anxiety
score and negative emotion score than the other food items
(p < .05) using the t test . This suggests that individuals
hoarded for beer to reduce anxiety during this period of time.
The results are consistent with the study (Thomas, Randall,
and Carrigan 2003) that shows that individuals drink alcohol to relieve anxiety. In addition, we find that egg has a significantly higher positive emotion score than the other food
items (p < .05)using the t test. The word “egg” is often mentioned with the other word such as omelets and the positive
emotion score is higher.

LIWC Trend
Figure 3 shows the trend of the LIWC calculated anxiety
scores and the growth rate of COVID-19 cases in the US
from March 1 to April 30. The calculated anxiety means for
hoarding and anti-hoarding tweets are presented. It shows
that both calculated means are above the LIWC mean average for general tweets and LIWC grand mean. This suggests that anxiety levels are higher than the expected LIWC
mean. Both LIWC-calculated hoarding anxiety score and
anti-hoarding anxiety score experienced a sharp increase
from mid- to late March. Similarly, the COVID-19 5-day
infection rate followed a sharp increase and decrease in the

the tweets of the hoarding group focus on food, toilet papers and shortage to various degrees depending on the demographics. Furthermore, we analyze the sentiment of the
tweets using LIWC2015. The hoarding-related tweets show
more anxiety. Interestingly, beer has the highest calculated
anxiety score compared to other hoarded items mentioned
in tweets. In the future, we plan to build and test new consumer behavior theories using such data to better relate the
consumer behaviors online and offline.

Conclusion and Future Work
In this paper, we have presented a computational framework and more importantly, the subsequent findings using
this framework, to understand the hoarding or panic buying
behavior during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic
by analyzing the hoarding related tweets. We first apply a
rule-based method to separate the tweets and their authors
into two groups on the basis of whether the tweets indicate
hoarding behaviors or express the opinion against hoarding.
