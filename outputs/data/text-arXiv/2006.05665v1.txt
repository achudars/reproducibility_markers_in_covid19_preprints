Abstract
This article describes a simple Susceptible Infected Recovered (SIR) model fitting with COVID-19
data for the month of march 2020 in New York (NY) state. The model is a classical SIR, but is nonautonomous; the rate of susceptible people becoming infected is adjusted over time in order to fit the
available data. The death rate is also secondarily adjusted. Our fitting is made under the assumption
that due to limiting number of tests, a large part of the infected population has not been tested positive.
In the last part, we extend the model to take into account the daily fluxes between New Jersey (NJ) and
NY states and fit the data for both states. Our simple model fits the available data, and illustrates typical
dynamics of the disease: exponential increase, apex and decrease. The model highlights a decrease in
the transmission rate over the period which gives a quantitative illustration about how lockdown policies
reduce the spread of the pandemic. The coupled model with NY and NJ states shows a wave in NJ
following the NY wave, illustrating the mechanism of spread from one attractive hot spot to its neighbor.

Introduction and model

From a scientific perspective, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the crucial role of mathematical
and statistical models in providing guidance for health policies. Expressions such as ”flatten the curve”,
the ”apex”, the ”plateau” have been widely heard in medias and employed by decision makers to explain
their choices regarding rules and policies during this critical period. In this short article, we first introduce
a simple SIR model, in which we adjust a key parameter k standing for a control on the SusceptibleInfected rate, and secondarily the death rate, in order to fit the data of the pandemic in NY state in March
2020, and provide predictions for a near future. Then, we add a node in the model to take into account the
daily fluxes between NY and NJ states. Note that these two close states, are, up to the day of redaction
of this article, the more severe hit by the pandemic in United States. Of course, the coupling may be
extended to other states. However, in this article, we restrict ourselves to NY and NJ. Accordingly, the
main key points of this article are that, 1) it highlights the dynamics and epidemiological characteristics
which have been discussed in press and health policies; It highlights qualitatively how lockdown policies
have decreased the spread of the virus and provides prediction and explanation of an upcoming apex,
2) it fits real data provided for the New York state and 3) it fits the data of NJ state by considering
coupled equations taking into account the daily fluxes between NY and NJ. This provides a quantitative
visualization of how the virus may spread from an attractive hot spot (New York City in NY state)
towards close states trough the daily fluxes of commuters.
We especially focus on fitting the total number of cases tested positive for COVID-19 as well as the
number of deaths in both NY and NJ states. We also give insights in prediction of the number of people
needing hospitalization in NY state.
SIR models are very classic in literature. For some reader’s convenience, we mention here some
contextual elements and references. The simplest classical SIR model is the KermackMcKendrick (KMcK)
model which goes back to 1927, see [12, 20]. It writes

 St = −kSI
It = kIS − rI
(KM cK)
(1)

Rt = rI

1

In this original (KMcK) model, the population splits into three classes. The class S stands for susceptible,
who can catch the disease, I stands for infective, who have the disease and can transmit it and R stands
for the removed, namely, those who have or have had the disease but not transmit it anymore. Note that
our terminology is slightly different as explained below. In (1), the dynamics follow the scheme
S→I→R
with respective transfer rates between classes of k and r.
SIR type models and more generally, mathematical models of epidemics have in fact a significant
history. We refer to [20] for a textbook on these models and a brief history of epidemics. Models have
become more sophisticated and may include more compartments such as exposed, infective asymptomatic,
infective with symptoms, and also reservoirs such as bats, and include stochastic dynamics. Recently,
SIR type models have been widely used in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, to model the spread
all around the world, see for example [11, 15, 9, 13, 16, 17, 22] and reference therein cited. Here are also
some examples of references for SIR models in other epidemic diseases: Dengue [?], Chikungunya [18, 19]
and Ebola [23]. See also references therein cited.
In the present article, we first consider the following model

S
 St = −k(t) I+S+R I
S
(2)
It = k(t) I+S+R I − r(t)I − d(t)I

Rt = r(t)I
This simple model has classically three classes: S for susceptible, I for infected and R for recovered.
Specifically, the class I is intended to represent all the people who bear effectively the virus at a given
time, and can transmit it if in contact with other people. It includes all infected people with or without
symptoms, reported or not. There are some differences with equation (1). First, it includes a death rate
d(t). And even Rtough, the number of deaths does not appear explicitly as a variable, it is simply given
t
by the integral 0 d(u)I(u)du. Also note that in expression
St = −k(t)

S
I,
S+I +R

the rate of contamination from S to I is proportional to the proportion of susceptible (S) in the whole
population (S + I + R). This is a classical expression standing for the fact that the probability for each
individual in the I class to spread the virus among the class S is proportional to the portion of S in the
whole population, see for example [10, 24] and references therein cited. This rate is corrected by a crucial
coefficient k(t) which is intended to fit the real transfer rate and which contains the effects inherent to
the properties of the virus (for example change of propagation rate due to genetic mutation of the virus)
or to specific policies (like quarantine, social distancing, lockdown...). This time dependence allows to
adjust the dynamics to fit the data. This is a specificity of our model and turns it into a non-autonomous
equation. This time dependence of k is obviously relevant in our model since the rate of transfer from S to
R is the main target of health policies and is subsequently subject to vary over time. Secondarily, we also
allow the death rate to vary. Many internal or external factors may affect the death rate among which are
concomitant lethal disease, temperature, hospital conditions... More significantly, one has to note that
the rate transfers considered here are instantaneous transfer between compartments, and the function
d(t) is different from the Case Fatality Rate (CFR). Recall that the CFR is the death rate per confirmed
case over a given period of time, and is a typical indicator for death rate. In South Korea, the country
which led the highest number of tests, it has been reported to be of 1 percent, see [14]. In China as of
February 2020, this rate varied between 3.8 in the region of Wuhan and 0.7 in others regions, see [1] and
1941
' 2.3 per cent. Since
also [8]. Using tables 1 and 2 gives a CFR in NY from March 1 to April 1 of 83804
our model fits the data, by definition, it fits the CFR. At the end of the epidemic, if the whole number of
people that contracted the virus would be tested positive the CFR would provide the probability to die
for an individual who catches the virus. However, during a growing phase such as the month of March
considered here, the CFR has large variations. Moreover, there is a delay between the time a person is
tested positive and the time he dies. The time between symptom onset and death has been reported
to range from about 2 to 8 weeks, see [8]. The typical average
R t being 23 days according to [14]. One
˜ t)I(u)du to take into account these
could for example introduce a time-integral death expression 0 d(u,
informations. However, the time-window considered here is short and corresponds to the beginning of
reported cases in NY. Furthermore, in this short article, we wanted to focus on a simple model able to
fit data, highlight relevant dynamics and provide estimations. Since, a person in the I compartment, will
either recover or die, above remarks on the function d hold for the coefficient r. In the present work, for
sake of simplicity, we have set the r coefficient to the constant value 0.64. This is a simplification which
is classical in SIR models. Note that setting the coefficient r to a constant value is equivalent to assume

2

that
R t people recovering between times t − 1 and t, which is given by R(t) − R(t − 1) would also write
r t−1 I(u)du according to equations (2). A more meaningful expression for R(t) − R(t − 1) would be
Rt
r̃(u, t)I(u)du standing to the fact that people recovering between time t − 1 and t have been infected
0
fromR a period ranging from 0 to t, with a transfer rate given by r̃(u, t). This would lead to the equation
r=

t
0Rr̃(u,t)I(u)du
t
t−1 I(u)du

. Once r is set to a constant value, to fit data over a reasonable period, numerical tries

provide a unique choice for constants k and d. It was still possible to use different values of r to fit the
data. However, different values of r result in different dynamics over time, and notably different time for
apex. Our choice of r = 0.64 was made to provide dynamics that seem relevant to us regrading the timely
dynamics beyond the data. In particular, too smaller of values for r would provide dynamics with a late
apex and less relevant regarding the timely effects of the disease. Other studies have considered models
with a constant r, with different values. See for example [21] and references therein cited. Remarkably,
varying r, and make it depend on time, provides some freedom to later fit data over a longer period of
time, taking in account the end of the first wave in NY.
Upon the above discussions, our strategy is rather simple: set r to a constant value. Then choose
a constant k which fits the data of positive cases during a period of time. Next, choose a constant d
to fit deaths data for the same period of time. Note that since the parameter k has much more effect
than the small parameter d, this procedure is possible and efficient. After, repeat the procedure over a
subsequent period. The overall procedure results in a constant function r and two piecewise constant
functions k(t) and d(t). For our model and the given data, the procedure was efficient allowing to provide
these choices by successive tries. Note that this could be done automatically by cooking an algorithm to
set the parameters following these guidelines. Note finally that our assumptions do not a include birth
rate for the susceptible population but rather focus on the short time effects of the disease.

Numerical Simulations, Data and Dynamics

2.1 Fitting the total number of infected people and the number of
deaths
Data from total infected people and total number of deaths in New York state is available at the New
York times web site, see [3]. We have downloaded the data from there from March 1 to April 1, which
makes 32 days. We have reported the number of total cases in table 1 and the number of deaths in table
2.
For numerical simulations of equation (2), the parameter r was set to 0.64. Then, in order to fit the data
of the total number of infected people, we chose:


 k1 = 1.057 if 0 ≤ t < 21

Initial conditions were set to
(19453556, 5, 0),
19453556 being the number of people living in NY state in 2019 according to USA Census bureau.
Regarding reported data in tables 1 and 2, as a matter of fact, not all infected people in March 2020
were tested. To take into account this fact in our model, we adjusted the parameters to fit the quantity
0.2 × (I + R) from the model, with the total number of infected people (data in table 1) minus the total
number of deaths (data in table 2), i.e. we assume here that only 20 percent of living people that have
contracted the virus has been tested positive. Note that shortly after the first submission of this work,
NY state reported the result of a random antibody test over a sample of 3000 individuals. Statewide,
13.9 percent of people were tested positive, ranging form 21.2 percent in New York City (NYC), to 3.6
percent in upstate counties. See [6, 5]. Comparing with data from [3], this gives a ratio of approximately
10; only about 10 percent of people having caught the virus in NY would have been tested positive.
Statistical estimates of related ratio, depending on the number of estimates provide a range of [5, 3000],
see [2]. Simulation of system (2), and comparison with data resulting from tables 1 and 2 are plotted in

Table 2: Total number of deaths reported in NY state from march 1 to April 1. See [3].
Figure 1-a. In Figure 1-b, we plotted the total number of deaths from the model and compared it to the
data. In Figure 1-c, we have plotted four curves corresponding to various I(t) for different simulations of
(2).
• The curve I1 (t) in red corresponds to the simulation of (2) with k(t) = k1 = 1.057 and d(t) = d1 =
0.0016 for all time.
• The curve I2 (t) in green corresponds to the simulation of (2) with k(t) = k1 = 1.057 and d(t) =
d1 = 0.016 for 0 ≤ t ≤ 21, and k(t) = k2 = 0.9 and d(t) = d2 = 0.00232 for 21 ≤ t < 24.
• The curve I3 (t) in pink corresponds to the simulation of (2) with k(t) as given in (3), i.e. k(t) = ki
and d(t) = di , t ∈ [ti−1 , ti ), i ∈ {1, ..., 4} with t0 = 0, t1 = 21, t2 = 24, t3 = 27, t4 = 32.
This panel illustrates how the health policies flatten the curve. In Figure 1-d, we have again plotted the
solution I(t) for k(t) as in (3), for a longer period.

Fitting the total number of people at hospital

Next, we have retrieved data corresponding to the number of people being at the hospital between
March 16 and April 1. During this period, and after, NY state officially reported daily useful charts
and statistics, on the local spread. We have then computed an estimation of people being effectively
at hospital at a given date. We denote H(ti ), ti ∈ {16, 17, ..., 32} the total number of hospitalizations
at a given date. In order to fit the solution of (2) with this data, we performed a linear regression
between (I(ti )), ti ∈ {16, 17, ..., 32} and (H(ti )), ti ∈ {19, 20, ..., 32}. The coefficients a and b of the linear
regression were determined by the least-square method, leading to the formulas:
a=

< x, y > −nx̄ȳ
||x||2 − x̄2
b = ȳ − ax̄

with
x = (H(ti ), ti ∈ {16, 17, ..., 32}

Figure 1: This figure illustrates the simulation of system (2) and how it fits the data. In (a), we have plotted
the quantity 0.2 × (I + R) as a function of time in red. The blue dots correspond to the data retrieved from
Rt
[3]. Analogously, in (b), we have plotted the quantity 0 d(s)I(s)ds, which represents the total number of
deaths according with the model, as a function of time in red. The blue dots correspond to the data retrieved
from [3]. In (c), we have illustrated the quantity I(t) corresponding to different values of k(t), d(t): the curve
I1 (t) in red corresponds to the simulation of (2) with k(t) = k1 and d(t) = d1 for all time. The curve I2 (t)
in green corresponds to the simulation of (2) with k(t) = k1 and d(t) = d1 for 0 ≤ t ≤ 21, and k(t) = k2
and d(t) = d2 for t ≥ 21. The curve I3 (t) in pink corresponds to the simulation of (2) with k(t) as given in

illustrates how the health policies flatten the curve. In (d), we have again plotted the solution I(t) for k(t)
as in (3), for a longer period.

Dynamics

Summing up the equations in (2) and looking for stationary solutions yield the following theorem.
Theorem 1. We assume that initial condition of system (2) satisfies S(0) > 0, I(0) > 0 and R(0) = 0.
Then for t > 0, all variables remain bounded and positive: there exists a positive constant M < R(0)+I(0)
such that for all t > 0:
0 < S(t) < M, 0 < I(t) < M, 0 < R(t) < M
and

t

Z
S(t) + I(t) + R(t) ≤ S(0) + I(0) −

d(s)I(s)ds.
0

Non-negative stationary solutions of the system are given by (S̄, 0, R̄), with S̄ ≥ 0 and R̄ ≥ 0. Furthermore, S(t) is decreasing, R(t) is increasing and the variation of I(t) is given by the sign of
k(t)

S(t)
− r − d(t).
S(t) + I(t) + R(t)

(5)

Remark 1. It is worth noting that this theorem, which proof is relatively straightforward provides two
simple but relevant interpretations from the applicative point of view. The first thing is that the stationary
solutions are given by (S̄, 0, R̄), with S̄ ≥ 0 and R̄ ≥ 0. This means that the stationary solutions, are all
with 0 infected but may take arbitrary non-negative values (within a bounded interval) for susceptible and
recovered. This reflects the reality of the disappearance of the virus. The second thing we want to mention
is that the variation of I is given by the sign of expression (5). In particular, basically during a classical
wave, this sign will be positive before the apex and negative after.

3 Two coupled SIR systems fitting COVID-19 for NY and
NJ states
It is estimated that around 400000 people used to commute from NJ to NY before the lockdown policies
due to the pandemic. It is natural to integrate these effects in the model, since those commuters played
the role of vector for virus before the lockdown. We therefore build a small network by coupling two
nodes, representing NY (node 1) and NJ (node 2). To this end, we couple two copies of the local model
(2) to take into account the daily fluxes between those two states. This leads to the following model:

S, I and R and drop the superscripts. Furthermore, we assume c12 and c21 to be periodic of period 1
(one day), with a Gaussian profile and respective apex at 8:30 am and 6:30 pm. Not that the amplitude
c21 is multiplied by a coefficient greater than 1. in comparison with c12 to take in account the amount
of population int NY and NJ. We want to emphasize here the attractivity of NYC, and therefore assume
that the fluxes are mainly from NJ to NY in the morning and form NY to NJ in the evening. The function
l(t) integrates policies of lockdown: after March 23, in the model, the daily fluxes are divided by 1000.
Therefore, the function l(t) is a piecewise constant function given by:
(
1 if 0 ≤ t < 23
l(t) :=

if t ≥ 23.
Initial conditions were set to
(19453556, 5, 0),
for node 1 and
(8882190, 0, 0),
for node 2. Note there are no infected cases at initial time in NJ. This means that in our model, initial
spread in NJ follows from infection in NY. The same methods as in section 2 were used to fit the data
for both NY and NJ for the network model (6). Illustrations are provided in Figure 3. It shows how
the model fits the data. In Figure 3-a, we have plotted the quantity 0.2(I2 + R2 ) as a function of time
in red. Recall that, in the model I2 + R2 , represents the number of people in the population which has
been infected by the virus and are still alive. The blue dots correspond to the data retrieved from [3]
and plots the total numberR of infected minus the number of total deaths. Analogously, in Figure 3-b we
t
have plotted the quantity 0 d2 (u)I2 (u)du as a function of time, in red. The blue dots correspond to the
data retrieved from [3]. Finally, Figure 3-c illustrates I1 t) and I2 (t), which represent respectively the
infected population in NY and NJ. It shows how the curve of NJ follows the curve in NY, with a small
attenuation. An analog theoretical result as in section 2 holds for solutions of (6).
Theorem 2. We assume that initial condition of system (6) satisfies S1 (0) > 0, I1 (0) > 0, R2 (0) = 0,
S2 (0) > 0, I2 (0) = 0 and R1 (0) = 0. Then for t > 0, all variables remain bounded and positive: there
exists a positive constant M < R(0) + I(0) such that for all t > 0:
0 < Si (t) < M, 0 < Ii (t) < M, 0 < Ri (t) < M, i ∈ {1, 2}

the quantity 0.2(I2 + R2 ) as a function of time in red. Recall that, in the model I2 + R2 , represents the
number of people in the population which has been infected by the virus and are still alive. The blue dots
correspond to the data retrieved from [3] and plots the total number of infected minus the number of total
Rt
deaths. Analogously, in (b) we have plotted the quantity 0 d2(u)I2 (u)du) as a function of time in red. The
blue dots correspond to the total number of deaths in NJ according with data retrieved from [3]. Panel (c)
illustrates I1 (t) and I2 (t), which represent respectively the infected in NY and NJ.

For any non negative S1 (0), R1 (0), S2 (0), R2 (0), the following functions satisfying for t > 0
I1 (t) = I2 (t) = 0
S1 (t) + S2 (t) = S1 (0) + S2 (0)
R1 (t) + R2 (t) = R1 (0) + R2 (0) 
S1t = −S2t = l(t) c12 (t)S2 − c21 (t)S1 
R1t = −R2t = l(t) c12 (t)R2 − c21 (t)R1
are solutions of (6). Furthermore, S1 (t) + S2 (t) is decreasing, R1 (t) + R2 (t) is increasing and I1 (t) + I2 (t)
is non increasing if and only if

Remark 2. As in remark 1, we want to point out some interpretation of this theorem in the context of
the pandemic. Here, we have described some solutions with free epidemic component (I( t) = I2 (t) = 0).
Note that in this case however, Si and Ri are not constant since they vary according to the fluxes between
the two nodes. Again the last inequality, quantifies the idea that when the spread of the virus becomes
lower than the death and recovery the infected population starts to decrease. The difference here is that
we take into account the two nodes together.

Conclusion

In this article, we have considered a simple non-autonomous SIR model to fit the data of COVID-19 in
New York state. The model illustrates and quantifies how acting on the control k(t) allows to flatten
the curve of infected people over the time. From the model, using classical statistical methods, it is then
possible to provide predictions of the number of people in needs of hospitalization. Lastly, we have fitted
data from NJ state thanks to a coupled SIR model taking into account the daily fluxes between NJ and
NY. It allows to predict similar dynamics in NY and NJ, with a delay and small attenuation. Note that,
despite its simplicity, our model fits, as good as more sophisticated models, the available data during the
growing phase of March 2020. In a forthcoming work, we aim to fit data with the model over a longer
period . This would provide an accurate estimation of the different parameters.
