Abstract

1

Voting by mail has been gaining traction
for decades in the United States and has
emerged as the preferred voting method
during the COVID-19 pandemic [6, 55].
In this paper, we examine the security
of electronic systems used in the process
of voting by mail, including online voter
registration and online ballot tracking
systems. The goals of these systems, to
facilitate voter registration and increase
public confidence in elections, are laudable. They indisputably provide a critical public good. It is for these reasons
that understanding the security and privacy posture of the mail-in voting process is paramount.

In an era where COVID-19 has necessitated social distancing and an elimination of large gatherings, the logistics of
political elections in the United States
are a natural cause for concern. On
the one hand, it is important that our
democratic processes proceed as normal
and elections continue to take place; on
the other, in-person voting at centralized locations poses a potential health
threat to citizens and threatens to suppress voter turnout.

Introduction

This leaves two possibilities for remote
voting: Internet voting or voting by
mail. Voting over the Internet has repeatedly been shown to be dangerously
insecure by security researchers, leaving large-scale mail-based voting as the
only viable remote option [26, 28, 36].
Voting by mail allows citizens to exercise their right to vote from the safety
of quarantine. There are currently five
states—Colorado, Oregon, Washington,
Hawaii, and Utah—that conduct elections almost entirely by mail, and an
additional six provide a permanent mail
ballot option [11]. While only a handful of states currently vote primarily by
mail, U.S. Senators Amy Klobuchar and
Ron Wyden introduced a bill in March

We find that online voter registration
systems in some states have vulnerabilities that allow adversaries to alter or
effectively prevent a voter’s registration.
We additionally find that ballot tracking
systems raise serious privacy questions
surrounding ease of access to voter data.
While the vulnerabilities discussed here
are unlikely to enable an adversary to
modify votes, several could have the effect of disenfranchising voters and reducing voter confidence in U.S. elections

very purpose of these systems.

1.1 Existing Ballot Tracking Systems

While only five states conduct elections
entirely by mail, all states allow absentee balloting pending an acceptable excuse, and so ballot tracking systems are
used across several states and counties.
There are three ballot tracking systems
currently in common use: Ballot Scout,
BallotTRACE, and BallotTrax. By our
count, around 15 states have counties
that use at least one of these three tracking websites.

in an eligible location [32]. Eligible locations allow three possible avenues for
registering for Informed Delivery.
Two of the avenues are given online,
with the third in fine print. Upon attempting to view tracking information,
a user is prompted with the two main
signup options after account creation: a
one-time code sent to phone via SMS or
to request for a code to be mailed to the
registered address. The more convenient
method utilizes mobile account information from carriers including AT&T,
T-Mobile, Verizon, U.S. Cellular, and
other branded wireless operators within
the United States. USPS account profile
information must match with regards to
address, name, and number as information provided by the carrier before a
one-time passcode is sent [25]. For this
modality of verification, an attack would
require the account password, as well
as a phone number associated with the
correct address. There are no limits or
checks placed on changing Account Profile information after logging in, but a
temporary lockout is placed on attempting to verify by phone after 3 changes
in a day. Should an account be verified, upon changing, prior verification is
nullified and re-authentication must be
done.

Prior to early 2019, USPS Informed Delivery did not rigorously authenticate
identity before allowing users to access
the tracking service. Account creation
used a knowledge-based authentication
(KBA) scheme, using approximately 4
multiple-guess questions using information from credit-bureaus. This security scheme was woefully lacking and
led to a prolific string of stalking, credit
card fraud, and identity theft cases in
2017-2018 [16]. USPS hesitated to implement proposed security schemes, including utilizing its own postage service
to mitigate the widespread attacks for
nearly two years [17]. USPS strongly
urged users proactively make accounts
with strong passwords to counter the
fraudsters, and closing fraudulent accounts required users to send sensitive
security question information to customer support through email [16].
As of early 2019, we find that much of
the earlier concerns have largely been
addressed after several iterative failures
in addressing the weak security. Accessing Informed Delivery no longer relies solely on KBA; services associated
with Informed Delivery are now decoupled from general account privileges and
require an extra one-time two-factor authentication to access them. Per the
January 2020 USPS Informed Delivery
sign-up guide, Informed Delivery is not
available for businesses, while personal
use requires a valid address or P.O. box

From testing with a toy account, information is simply checked against the
service/billing name and address associated with the phone number for authentication. A motivated attacker could
likely change their address through their
service provider as we did using a volunteer’s Google Fi account to switch addresses and sign up for one of our parent’s residences. A screenshot from the
email associated with this toy account
of a recent Informed Delivery email is
shown below in igure 1]. The grayscale

cerns stem from its API. Ballot tracking
applications we examined do not explicitly state whether they use IV-MTRs
API to inform their mail-status updates
and announcements, so we will hit main
points of concern with IV-MTR.

The second option presented is to request for an invitation code to be sent to
the specified address by mail. For those
unable to do either, USPS also states
in fine print that they can authorize accounts by walk-in at participating locations with proper identification.

IV-MTR returns multiple file formats,
from PKG to JSON, containing parcel
location information. Although we were
unable to access the current API documentation, an older copy of the API

13 IV-servers, among other concerns [12,
30]. Later the same year, news stories
reported that the API accepted wildcard search parameters for nearly every method and did not authenticate a
queries viewing permissions before returning relevant data [18].

To briefly cover accessibility with ID,
apartment addresses within eligible zip
codes are frequently ineligible for Informed Delivery sign-up. The third authentication option, of allowing users
to authenticate their identities at select
postal service locations is likely not viable for certain zip codes, and are entirely unavailable at the time of this
writing. Vote-by-mail access has been a
concern for populations without a permanent address or P.O. box. Voter
registration and access to tracking or
registration services that require permanent addresses or a particular locality have seen poor registration and
disproportionately poorer turnout rates
among minority populations [46]. North
Dakota, a prominent and controversial
example of voting inaccessibility, agreed
to a court-order to ease registration restrictions on the basis of address after
nearly four years of litigation and only a
week prior to the writing of this section
[24].

Poignantly, a report querying “for readers who volunteered to help with this
research” was able to gain access to
“multiple accounts when those users had
more than one user signed up at the
same physical address” [18]. The security audit only occurred a few weeks before the news break, and the allowance
of unverified wildcard search queries is a
non-trivial oversight. Assuming security
vulnerabilities have been patched, the
information a ballot tracing app has access to through these APIs is not clear;
whether the app stores non-election related parcel information is also of concern.

ifornia that are planning on automatically sending all voters mail-in ballots,
this ID could be included with the ballot to enable voters to track its return
to their local election facility [7]. Voters could use this randomly assigned ID
along with typical identifying information, such as first name and last name,
to authenticate themselves to the ballot
tracking system.

The problem is fundamentally one of insufficient authentication. The system
cannot guarantee with any measure of
confidence that the user looking up a
particular voters information is truly the
voter if the only information required to
look up a voter is publicly available.

Our proposed solution is to recommend
the use of a 12-digit unique, randomized ID that is assigned to a particular ballot envelope. The concept is similar to the United States 2020 Census
use of 12-digit Census IDs, which are
included in the materials mailed to residents [1]. A state or county can provide a voter with this unique ID as part
of their paper-based or online absentee
ballot request. For states such as Cal-

common security attacks. In the ballot
tracking process, the concern is that an
adversary could create a malicious barcode and mail back an envelope with
this barcode instead of a genuine Intelligent Mail barcode. This adversarial barcode would then be scanned at
an elections facility, conceivably causing damage to election databases tracking which ballots have been returned—
and, far more consequentially, who has
already voted in the election. To mitigate potential consequences of a malicious barcode, then, the application that
takes in scanner data should validate
and sanitize all inputs, whether in text
or barcode form.

of itself, the fact that any malicious act
as a result of this information request
could be traced back to the requester
is thwarting. When methods are introduced by which to obtain this information in an anonymous way via hacking,
the privacy of the voting public is put at
greater risk.

In order to properly deliver results of
ballot tracking to a voter, ballot tracking services often require the submission
of personal data. In order to deliver updates on a voter’s ballot, Ballot Scout requires the submission of a voter’s name,
address, year of birth, and email address
or phone number. Ballot Scout notes in
their privacy policy that they ”do not
disclose any of your personal information unless required by law” [54].

The schema and means by which the information is stored is not publicly available, as these ballot tracking services
are mostly powered by private corporations. Presumably, this is intended to
ensure the confidentiality of proprietary
designs. However, this does pose the privacy concern of aggregate voter statistics. As it would be necessary to track
ones ballot, the ballot tracking services
are made aware of distinct voter actions.
These actions can be defined as but are
not limited to: whether or not the individual has voted, at what time they
voted, where they chose to deposit their
vote. While the contents of the ballot
might remain secure, the behaviors of
voters may not. Similar to Ballot Scout,
many tracking services explicitly state
that they will not give away your personal information. However, there are
no such lines in the privacy policies describing the usage or sale of aggregate
statistics obtained by tracking the voter
ballots [54].

While in many states voter information
is public, the amount of data varies between states and the means by which to
obtain the information are different as
well [39]. This is where a crucial distinction lies. It might be very possible to
obtain voter information in many states,
but there is often a process by which
one must request a list of voter information. As a result, there is a paper trail
that could pin responsibility. While that
does not directly protect privacy in and

This brings up the issue of differential
privacy: wherein, the aggregate statistics must be able to describe patterns
of groups within the dataset while withholding personally identifiable information, in this case the actions of the individual. If the company were to sell
aggregate information that could isolate
individuals, it becomes much easier for
political entities to interfere with the
mail-in voting process. This becomes
vulnerable to an attack such as a Mem-

5

Information Privacy

bership Attack in which the attacker can
determine whether or not a specific individual falls within a subset of the data.
For example, an adversary would be able
to determine, via membership attack, a
set of individuals that do not vote by
mail. In a state where vote by mail is
the only option, contextual information
such as this example becomes very powerful in determining the behavior of voters. Similarly, since party affiliation is
publicly known, with the voter actions
known of a subset of individuals, the
following scenario could occur: Time or
location data for mail-in ballots are released or sold to Party A. Party A, via
membership attack, isolates and learns
that Party B voters tend to deposit their
ballots at a certain time or location more
frequently. As a result, Party A tampers with deposit boxes in that location
for only those specific times to achieve
a maximal impact result with minimal
effort.
The problem of privacy becomes compounded when the security of said information is subjected to multiple weak
points. Ballot tracking services are not
powered entirely by the technology of
the given corporation. As a result they
are not solely responsible for all of the
potential security breaches. Trackers require the usage of third party tools in
order to deliver their end product. In
the case of Ballot Scout, to deliver its
tracking services it enlists the services
of the following services: Twilio, Amazon SES, and SmartyStreets [54]. Each
of these distinct services gain access to
different pieces of a voter’s personal information. These services similarly rely
on other 3rd party services. As a result, a chain of dependencies is created
in which a voters personal data is exposed at multiple different points.

Twilio, for example, had a breach in
2018 from one of its providers, Voxox,
that resulted in SMS message details being leaked [45]. Since Twilio is used to
power voter notifications, a hack on any
part of this pipeline could result in the
adversary being aware of where the ballot is due to these notifications. The adversary could similarly obtain authentication codes to register ballot tracking
properly. It seems imperative that there
must be accountability for the pipeline
of providers that have access to voters
personal information. Otherwise, the
public must be adequately educated on
the reach that their personal information has when being provided to a ballot
tracking service such as Ballot Scout.

Conclusion

Vote-by-mail has received increased
scrutiny during the COVID-19 pandemic, with widespread implementation
seen as a necessity given social distancing restrictions. States that have implemented no-excuse, state-wide vote-bymail have seen vast successes and with
higher voter turnout, highlighting its efficacy as an alternative to traditional onsite ballot casting.
Security concerns and lack of transparency with the chain of custody are
often cited as the primary reason for
sticking to traditional voting methods.
Voters want to ascertain their ballots
are actually counted, and for good reason as on-site voting machines already
have numerous security vulnerabilities
[22]. Attempts to rectify this have produced numerous web and mobile applications, including Ballot Scout, BallotTRACE, and BallotTrax, that provide
users with an interface to view “end-to-

end mail tracking information” [33]. Unfortunately, any technological augmentation to a paper-based voting scheme is
itself a potential security vulnerability.
