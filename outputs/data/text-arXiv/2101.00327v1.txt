Abstract
Starting on February 20, 2020, the global stock markets began to suffer the worst decline since
the Great Recession in 2008, and the COVID-19 has been widely blamed on the stock market
crashes. In this study, we applied the log-periodic power law singularity (LPPLS) methodology
based on multilevel time series to unravel the underlying mechanisms of the 2020 global stock
market crash by analyzing the trajectories of 10 major stock market indexes from both developed
and emergent stock markets, including the S&P 500, the DJIA, and the NASDAQ from the
United State, the FTSE from the United Kingdom, the DAX from Germany, the NIKKEI from
Japan, the CSI 300 from China, the HSI from Hong Kong, the BSESN from India, and the
BOVESPA from Brazil. In order to effectively distinguish between endogenous crash and
exogenous crash in stock market, we proposed using the LPPLS confidence indicator as a
classification proxy. The results show that the apparent LPPLS bubble patterns of the superexponential increase, corrected by the accelerating logarithm-periodic oscillations, have indeed
presented in the price trajectories of the seven indexes: S&P 500, DJIA, NASDAQ, DAX, CSI
300, BSESN, and BOVESPA, indicating that the large positive bubbles have formed
endogenously prior to the 2020 stock market crash, and the subsequent crashes for the seven
indexes are endogenous, stemming from the increasingly systemic instability of the stock
markets, while the well-known external shocks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the corporate
debt bubble, and the 2020 Russia–Saudi Arabia oil price war, only acted as sparks during the
2020 global stock market crash. In contrast, the obvious signatures of the LPPLS model have not
been observed in the price trajectories of the three remaining indexes: FTSE, NIKKEI, and HSI,
signifying that the crashes in these three indexes are exogenous, stemming from external shocks.
We also found that in terms of the regime changes of the stock markets, no obvious LPPLS
negative bubble pattern has been observed in the price trajectories of the 10 stock market indexes,
indicating that the regime changes from a bear market to a bull market in late March 2020 are
exogenous, stemming from external factors. The unprecedented market and economy rescue
efforts from federal reserves and central banks across the world in unison may have played a
critical role in quelling the 2020 global stock market crash in the nick of time. The novel
classification method of crash types proposed in this study, endogenous or exogenous via LPPLS
confidence indicator analyses, can also be used to analyze regime changes of any price
trajectories in global financial markets.

1. Introduction
Beginning on February 20, 2020, the global stock markets have turned the regime in unison from
a bull market to a bear market, as shown in Figure 1. In the ensuing five weeks, the three major
U.S. stock market indexes: the S&P 500, the NASDAQ composite, and the Dow Jones Industrial
Average index, have plunged dramatically, falling by 33.9%, 30.1% and 37.1%, respectively. It
is the worst decline since the Great Recession in 2008, interrupting the bull market trend of the
past 11 years from March 2009 to February 2020. During the long booming period in the U.S.
stock market since the 2008 financial crisis, the S&P 500 index has soared tremendously from
676.53 on March 9, 2009 to 3,386.15 on February 19, 2020, a four-fold increase. In the 2020
stock market crash, the level-1 trading curbs or circuit breakers due to massive panic sell-offs
have been triggered repeatedly when the S&P 500 Index dropped in the range of 7% to 13%,
resulting in 15-minute trading halts on major U.S. stock markets on 3/9/2020, 3/12/2020,
3/16/2020, and 3/18/2020, respectively. This is an extremely rare situation that the trading curb
was triggered four times within 10 days. Since the trading curb rule was instigated after the
Black Monday in 1987, the first and only other trading curb occurred on 27 October 1997, more
than 22 years ago.
The 2020 Stock market Crash from February to April 2020, also called the Coronavirus Crash,
has greatly impacted the lives and livelihoods of a multitude of people across the globe. During
the crisis, the yield on the US 10-year Treasury note -- the most popular debt instrument and
lowest-risk investment in the world backed by the full faith and credit of the United States and
serving as broader barometer for economic growth, inflation expectations and financial
conditions -- dropped by 65.4% within three weeks, falling from 1.56% on 2/19/2020 to 0.54%
on 3/9/2020, the lowest close in history (FRED, 2020). Indeed, the Treasury yield curve rates
started to inverse on 2/18/2020 with the yield on the 10-year note dropped to 1.55% while the
yield on the three-month bills rose to 1.58%. As the situation grew worse, the inversion
deteriorated steadily and the yield rate gap between the three-month bills and the 10-year note
expanded to 15 basis points on 2/24/2020. The abnormally inverted Treasury yield curve
indicated that people had lost confidence in the economic stability of the coming months or years,
signaling an impending recession. To ensure banks had enough liquidity, the Federal Reserve
revived the Quantitative Easing (QE) program on March 15, 2020 and announced to purchase
$500 billion in U.S. Treasuries and $200 billion in mortgage-backed securities. Just one week
later, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) convened an emergency meeting to
expanded the QE purchases to an unlimited amount (FED, 2020).
Although the proximal origins of typical market crashes in financial crises are so diverse, the
root cause of financial crashes can usually be divided into two types: endogenous and exogenous.
In endogenous crash, large declines in price trajectories are caused by factors within the financial
market, such as the Wall Street Crash of October 1929 and the dot.com crash of April 2000,
while in exogenous crash, large declines in price trajectories are induced by external shocks,
such as the Nazi invasion of the western Europe on May 10, 1940, and the resignation and the
subsequent controversial pardoning of President Richard Nixon due to the Watergate scandal on
Augusts 8 and September 8, 1974 (Johansen & Sornette, 2010).

Thus far, multiple external shocks have been widely blamed on the 2020 global stock market
crash. The outbreak of the novel coronavirus COVID-19 in January 2020 had attracted global
attention. On January 30, 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO)
announced that the outbreak of the COVID-19 constituted a Public Health Emergency of
International Concern (PHEIC), the highest level of alarm of the WHO. Deeply concerned about
the shocking speed of disease spread, severity, and government inaction, the WHO declared the
disease a global pandemic on March 11, 2020 (WHO, 2020). Since the 1918 flu pandemic, the
COVID-19 pandemic has been the most impactful pandemic.. Albuquerque et al. (2020) argued
that the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent lockdowns caused an external and unparalleled
shock that resulted in the 2020 global stock market crash. Hence the 2020 Global Stock Market
Crash is also called the Great Coronavirus Crash (Coy, 2020). Besides the COVID-19 pandemicinduced market instability, the mammoth nonfinancial corporate debt bulge had showed signs of
financial market stress and liquidity crisis, which was also found responsible for the economic
recession (Lynch, 2020). Further, Guardian (2020) believed that the 2020 Russia–Saudi Arabia
oil price war together with the Coronavirus outbreak had triggered the global stock market crash.
In this study, we used the Log Periodic Power Law Singularity (LPPLS) model (Drozdz et al.,
1999; Feigenbaum & Freund, 1996; Johansen et al., 2000; Johansen et al., 1999; Sornette &
Johansen, 2001; Sornette et al., 1996) to disclose the underlying mechanisms of the 2020 Stock
market Crash. The LPPLS model originates from the interface of financial economics, behavioral
finance and statistical physics by combining the economic theory of rational expectations,
behavioral finance of herding of traders, and the mathematical and statistical physics of
bifurcations and phase transitions. In the LPPLS model, a positive (negative) financial bubbles is
represented as a process of unsustainably super-exponential growth (decline) to achieve an
infinite return in finite time, forcing a short-lived correction molded according to the symmetry
of discrete scale invariance (Sornette, 1998). The correction of the price in a finite time
singularity can be a boom (or crash) as the price increase (or drop) significantly, or a change of
regime as the price change velocity increase (or decrease) dramatically in a short time scale. The
LPPLS model can capture two distinct characteristics normally observed in the regime of
bubbles, that is, faster-than-exponential growth of the price resulting from positive feedback by
imitation and herding behavior of noise traders, and the accelerating log-periodic volatility
fluctuations of the price growth from expectations of higher returns or an upcoming crash. We
found that these two significant features can be clearly observed in the 10 stock market indexes
shown in Figure 1, in which the transient super-exponential growth rates can be visually
diagnosed as an upward curvature in the linear-log plot, adorned with significant log-periodic
undulations.
In the recent years, the LPPLS model has been studied by many scholars to diagnose speculative
bubbles through analyzing the LPPLS signatures embedded in the asset price trajectories.
Filimonov and Sornette (2013) converted the LPPLS formulation to reduce the calibration
complexity by decreasing the number of nonlinear parameters from four to three. Sornette et al.
(2015) examined the real-time prediction of bubble crash in the 2015 Shanghai stock market
using the LPPLS Confidence indicator and Trust indicator. Filimonov et al. (2017) adopted the
adjusted profile likelihood inference method to calibrate the LPPLS model and to infer the
critical time. Demos and Sornette (2017) discovered that the beginning time of a bubble is much
better constrained than its end time. Demirer et al. (2019) probed the predictive power of market3

based indicators by using the LPPLS confidence multi-scale indicators and found that short
selling and liquidity both contributed to the bubble indicators. Shu and Zhu (2020b) proposed an
adaptive multilevel time series detection methodology to enable the real-time detections of
financial bubbles and crashes. In addition, the LPPLS model has been deployed to detect bubbles
and crashes in a variety of financial markets including the real estate bubbles (Zhou & Sornette,
2003, 2006, 2008), the oil market bubbles (Sornette et al., 2009), the Chinese stock market
bubbles (Jiang et al., 2010; Li, 2017; Shu, 2019; Shu & Zhu, 2019, 2020a; Sornette et al., 2015),
and the Bitcoin bubbles (Gerlach et al., 2019; Shu & Zhu, 2020b).
It should be noted that the LPPLS model could only detect the endogenous crashes but not the
exogenous crashes. This is because the LPPLS model is rooted on the faster-than-exponential
growth of the price trajectory, which is a significant feature when a financial bubble results from
the self-reinforcements of cooperative herding and imitative behaviors through interactions of
market players involving long-memory processes of an endogenous organization. In an
exogenous crash, the exogenous shocks can change an asset’s fundamental value underlying a
financial market and leave some observable signatures in the price trajectories; however, the
signature of the LPPLS model before a crash will be absent from the corresponding price
trajectories.

Figure 1. Evolution of price trajectories of the 10 major stock market indexes from January 2010
to November 2020 (The dark shadow box indicates the period of 2020 global stock market crash)

We adopted the LPPLS model in this study to investigate the 2020 global stock market crash by
analyzing the performance of the 10 major global stock market indexes from both developed and
emergent stock markets, including the S&P 500 (SP500), the Dow Jones Industrial Average
(DJIA), and the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQ) indexes for the stock market exchanges in
United State, the Financial Times Stock Exchange 100 Index (FTSE) for the London Stock
Exchange in United Kingdom, the DAX performance index (DAX) for the Frankfurt Stock

Exchange in Germany, the Nikkei Stock Average index (NIKKEI) for the Tokyo Stock
Exchange in Japan, the CSI 300 stock market index (CSI300) for the Shanghai Stock Exchange
and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange in China, the Hang Seng Index (HSI) for the Hong Kong
Stock Exchange in Hong Kong, the BSE SENSEX index (BSESN) for the Bombay Stock
Exchange in India, and the Bovespa Index (BOVESPA) for the B3 Stock Exchange in Brazil.
Figure 1 shows the evolution of price trajectories of these 10 major stock market indexes from
January 2010 to November 2020. We also proposed a novel classification method based on the
LPPLS confidence indicator to analyze crash types and regime changes of price trajectories in
stock market. In order to investigate the 2020 global stock market crash from different time
scales, the multilevel time series of price trajectories were employed in this study. The paper is
organized as the following: Section 2 presents our methodology; Section 3 discusses the analyses
and the results; and, finally, Section 4 concludes.

2. Methodology
2.1 The Log-Periodic Power Law Singularity (LPPLS) Model
Asset price trajectories in bubble regimes usually show two typical characteristics: the transient
faster-than-exponential growth decouples from the intrinsic fundamental value, and the
accelerating log-periodic volatility fluctuates near the crash points. Based on the rational
expectation bubble model (Blanchard & Watson, 1982), the LPPLS model, also known as
Johansen-Leoit-Sornette model, captures these two typical characteristics to model a financial
bubble as a process of faster-than-exponential power law growth intervened by short-lived
corrections organized according to the symmetry of discrete scale invariance (Sornette, 1998).
The LPPLS model integrates the rational expectation economic theory, the imitation and herding
behavioral finance by investors and traders, and the mathematical and statistical physics of
bifurcation and phase transitions (Yan et al., 2010). In the LPPLS model, the dynamics of the
observed asset price 𝑝(𝑡) is described as:

dp
=  (t )dt +  (t )dW − kdj
p

(1)

where 𝜇(𝑡) is the time-dependent expected return, 𝜎(𝑡) is the volatility, 𝑑𝑊 is the infinitesimal
increment of a Wiener process with zero mean and unit variance, 𝑑𝑗 represents a discontinuous
jump with value before the crash set to 0 and after the crash set to 1, while the term 𝑘 quantifies
the loss amplitude of a possible crash. The dynamics of the jumps are determined by a crash
hazard rate ℎ(𝑡), which measures the crash probability at a specified time 𝑡. Under the condition
that no jump has occurred, the expected value of 𝑑𝑗 between 𝑡 and 𝑡 + 𝑑𝑡 can be calculated as
𝐸[𝑑𝑗] = ℎ(𝑡)d𝑡. The LPPLS model considers two types of agents: (a) the rational traders with
rational expectations, and, (b) the noise traders susceptible to exhibit imitation and herding
behavior. The LPPLS model assumes that the collective behavior of noise traders can destabilize
asset prices through related transactions. The aggregate effect of noise traders can be determined
by the following dynamics of the crash hazard rate ℎ(𝑡) (Johansen et al., 2000):
ℎ(𝑡) = 𝛼(𝑡𝑐 − 𝑡)𝑚−1 (1 + 𝛽𝑐𝑜𝑠(𝜔 𝑙𝑛( 𝑡𝑐 − 𝑡) − 𝜙′))

(2)

where 𝛼, 𝛽, 𝜔, and 𝑡𝑐 are model parameters. From Equation (2), the crash risk at a specified time
𝑡 resulting from the imitation and herding behavior is a sum of the power law singularity
5

𝛼(𝑡𝑐 − 𝑡)𝑚−1 which embodies the positive feedback mechanism of the herding behaviors of the
noise traders, modulated by large-scale amplitude oscillations that are periodic in the logarithm
of the time to the critical time 𝑡𝑐 . The term cos (𝜔 ln(𝑡𝑐 − 𝑡) − 𝜙′) signifying the existence of a
possible hierarchical cascade of panic acceleration punctuating the bubble growth, results either
from a preexisting hierarchy in noise trader sizes (Sornette & Johansen, 1997) and/or from the
interplay between market price impact inertia and nonlinear fundamental value investing (Ide &
Sornette, 2002).
Given the non-arbitrage condition, the unconditional expectation 𝐸[𝑑𝑝]of the price increment
should be 0, resulting in:

µt
( )  E[

dp / dt
]no crash = kh(t )
p

(3)

Under the condition that no crash has yet occurred, the simple mathematical formulation of the
LPPLS for the expected trajectory of the log-price in a bubble regime can be achieved by solving
Equation (1) while incorporating Equations (2) and (3) (Sornette, 2003):
LPPLS(𝑡) ≡ 𝑙𝑛 𝐸 [𝑝(𝑡)] = 𝐴 + 𝐵(𝑡𝑐 − 𝑡)𝑚 + 𝐶(𝑡𝑐 − 𝑡)𝑚 𝑐𝑜𝑠[ 𝜔 𝑙𝑛( 𝑡𝑐 − 𝑡) − 𝜙] (4)
where 𝐵 = −𝑘𝛼/𝑚 and 𝐶 = −𝑘𝛼𝛽/√𝑚2 + 𝜔 2 . By expanding the term 𝐶 𝑐𝑜𝑠[. ] with two linear
parameters 𝐶1 = 𝐶𝑐𝑜𝑠𝜙 and 𝐶2 = 𝐶𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜙 to replace the linear parameter 𝐶 and the nonlinear
parameter 𝜙, the mathematical formulation of the LPPLS in Equation (4) can be rephrased as
(Filimonov & Sornette, 2013):
LPPLS(𝑡) ≡ 𝐸𝑡 [ln 𝑝(𝑡)] = 𝐴 + 𝐵(𝑡𝑐 − 𝑡)𝑚 + 𝐶1 (𝑡𝑐 − 𝑡)𝑚 cos[𝜔 𝑙𝑛(𝑡𝑐 − 𝑡)]
+𝐶2 (𝑡𝑐 − 𝑡)𝑚 sin[𝜔 𝑙𝑛(𝑡𝑐 − 𝑡)]

(5)

Here 𝐴 > 0 is the expected value of the log-price at 𝑡𝑐 . The bubble regime is usually
characterized by 0 < 𝑚 < 1 and 𝐵 < 0 ( 𝐵 > 0 ) to ensure that the price changes superexponentially as time goes towards 𝑡𝑐 . The condition of 𝑚 > 0 indicates that the price remains
finite at the 𝑡𝑐 , while 𝑚 < 1 ensures that a singularity exists. It should be noted that the critical
time 𝑡𝑐 is the most probable time for a regime change based on the asset price trajectories,
which may be either a large spike or crash, or a change of the growth rate from super-exponential
to exponential or lower growth, and the subsequent termination of the accelerated oscillations.
2.2 Calibration of the Model
The remodeled LPPLS formula in Equation (5) has 3 nonlinear parameters {t c , 𝑚, 𝜔} and 4
linear parameters {𝐴, 𝐵, 𝐶1 , 𝐶2 }. Using the 𝐿2 norm, the sum of squares of residuals of the
converted LPPLS formula can be written as:
N

F (tc , m, , A, B, C1 , C2 ) = [ln p( i ) − A − B(tc −  i ) m − C1 (tc −  i ) m cos( ln(tc −  i ))
i =1

− C2 (tc −  i ) sin( ln(tc −  i ))]
m

6

2

(6)

where 𝜏1 = 𝑡1 and 𝜏𝑁 = 𝑡2 . The cost function 𝜒 2 ( 𝑡𝑐 , 𝑚, 𝜔) can be obtained by relating the 4
linear parameters (𝐴, 𝐵, 𝐶1 , 𝐶2 ) to the 3 nonlinear parameters (𝑡𝑐 , 𝑚, 𝜔):

 2 (tc , m,  ) = F1 (tc , m,  ) = min F (tc , m, , A, B, C1 , C2 ) = F (tc , m, , Aˆ , Bˆ , Cˆ1, Cˆ 2 ) (7)
{ A, B ,C ,C }
1

2

where the hat symbol ^ represents the estimated parameters. The 4 linear parameters (𝐴, 𝐵, 𝐶1 , 𝐶2 )
can be estimated by solving the optimization equation:
(𝐴̂, 𝐵̂, 𝐶̂1 , 𝐶̂2 ) = 𝑎𝑟𝑔 min 𝐹(𝑡𝑐 , 𝑚, 𝜔, 𝐴, 𝐵, 𝐶1 , 𝐶2 )
(8)
(𝐴,𝐵, 𝐶1 ,𝐶2)

Equation (8) can be solved analytically through the following matrix equations

where 𝑓𝑖 = (𝑡𝑐 − 𝑡𝑖 )𝑚 , 𝑔𝑖 = (𝑡𝑐 − 𝑡𝑖 )𝑚 𝑐𝑜𝑠(𝜔 ln(𝑡𝑐 − 𝑡𝑖 )), and ℎ𝑖 = (𝑡𝑐 − 𝑡𝑖 )𝑚 𝑠𝑖𝑛(𝜔 ln(𝑡𝑐 −
𝑡𝑖 )).
The three nonlinear parameters { 𝑡𝑐 , 𝑚, 𝜔} can be estimated by solving the resulting nonlinear
optimization problem:
{𝑡̂c , 𝑚
̂, 𝜔
̂} = 𝑎𝑟𝑔 min 𝐹1 (𝑡c , 𝑚, 𝜔)
(10)
{𝑡𝑐 ,𝑚,𝜔}

The seven parameters (𝑡𝑐 , 𝑚, 𝜔, 𝐴, 𝐵, 𝐶1 , 𝐶2 ) in the transmuted LPPLS model can be estimated
by calibrating the model based on the price trajectory using the Ordinary Least Squares method.
The covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES) developed by Hansen et al.
(1995) is used to solve this optimization problem. The best estimation of the three nonlinear
parameters (𝑡𝑐 , 𝑚, 𝜔) can be obtained by minimizing the sum of residuals between the fitted
LPPLS model and the observed price trajectory.
2.3 LPPLS Confidence Indicator
In order to measure the sensitivity of the detected bubble pattern to the selection of the start time
𝑡1 in the fitting windows, Sornette et al. (2015) proposed the LPPLS confidence indicator which
is defined as the fraction of fitting windows where the calibrated LPPLS models meet the
specified filter conditions. Larger LPPLS confidence indicator simply means more fitting
windows having the signatures of the LPPLS model and the hence the detected LPPLS bubble
patterns are more reliable. A small value of the LPPLS confidence indicator indicates a possible
fragility because only few fitting windows would show the LPPLS bubble pattern.
For a specified data point 𝑡2 corresponding to a fictitious “present”, the LPPLS confidence
indicator can be determined in the following way: (a) create the total fitted time windows by
moving 𝑡1 toward the 𝑡2 with a step of 𝑑𝑡, (b) calibrate the LPPLS model in the specified search
space for each fitting time window, and (c) divide the number of time windows satisfying the

7

specified filter conditions by the total number of the fitting windows. It should be noted that the
LPPLS confidence indicator is causal because it is calculated based on the data prior to 𝑡2 .
Given a specified endpoint 𝑡2 , a group of time series of asset price trajectories in this study is
generated by shrinking the length of the time window (𝑡1 , 𝑡2 ) from 650 data points to 30 data
points in the step of 5 data points, thereby creating 125 fitting windows for each 𝑡2 . To ensure
model rigorousness, the search space is set to (Shu & Zhu, 2020b):
𝑡 −𝑡
𝑚|𝐵|
𝑚 ∈ [0,1], 𝜔 ∈ [1, 50], 𝑡𝑐 ∈ [𝑡2 , 𝑡2 + 2 1] ,
≥1
(11)
3
𝜔√𝐶21 +𝐶22

The condition 𝑡c ∈ [𝑡2 , 𝑡2 + (𝑡2 − 𝑡1 )/3] ensures that the critical time 𝑡c can be predicted not
only after the endpoint 𝑡2 , but also adjacent to 𝑡2 because the predictability of the LPPLS model
is degraded while moved from 𝑡2 (Jiang et al., 2010). Here the Damping parameter 𝑚|𝐵|/
(𝜔√𝐶1 2 +𝐶2 2 ) ≥ 1 indicates that the crash hazard rate ℎ(𝑡) is non-negative (Bothmer &
Meister, 2003).
To determine the valid LPPLS fits, the calibrated LPPLS model will be filtered under the
following conditions (Shu & Zhu, 2020b):
𝑡2 − 𝑡1 𝜔
𝑡𝑐 − 𝑡1
𝑚 ∈ [0.01,0.99], 𝜔 ∈ [2, 25], 𝑡𝑐 ∈ [𝑡2 , 𝑡2 +
] , ln (
) ≥ 2.5,
5

𝑡𝑐 − 𝑡2
|𝑝
̂−𝑝 |
max ( 𝑡 𝑡 ) ≤ 0.20, 𝑝𝑙𝑜𝑚𝑏 ≤ 𝛼𝑠𝑖𝑔𝑛 , ln(𝑝̂𝑡 ) − ln (𝑝𝑡 )~AR(1)
(12)
𝑝𝑡

The filter conditions are derived from empirical evidence collected from previous investigations
on financial bubbles (Jiang et al., 2010; Sornette et al., 2015). The condition of (𝜔/𝜋)ln[(𝑡𝑐 −
𝑡1 )/(𝑡c − 𝑡2 )] ≥ 2.5 is used to distinguish between genuine log-periodic signals and noisegenerated signals (Huang et al., 2000). The condition of max(|𝑝̂𝑡 − 𝑝𝑡 |/𝑝𝑡 ) ≤ 0.20 ensures that
the fitted price 𝑝̂𝑡 is close to the actual asset price 𝑝𝑡 . The condition 𝑃𝑙𝑜𝑚𝑏 ≤ 𝛼𝑠𝑖𝑔 assures the
existence of the logarithm-periodic oscillations in the fitted LPPLS model by applying the Lomb
spectral analysis to the time series of the detrended residual 𝑟(𝑡) = (𝑡𝑐 − 𝑡)−𝑚 (ln[𝑝(𝑡)] − 𝐴 −
𝐵(𝑡𝑐 − 𝑡)𝑚 ) (Sornette & Zhou, 2002). The ln(𝑝̂𝑡 ) − ln (𝑝𝑡 )~AR(1) condition implies that the
LPPLS fitting residuals can be modeled by a mean-reversal Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (O-U) process
when the logarithmic price in the bubble regime is due to a deterministic LPPLS component (Lin
et al., 2014). Only calibration results meeting the filter conditions in Equation (12) are believed
to be valid while the rest are deemed superfluous.
2.4 Classification of Crash Types
Because the LPPLS model, modeling the transient super-exponential growth of asset trajectories
resulting from self-reinforcing cooperative herding and imitative behaviors through interactions
between market participants involving long-term memory processes of an endogenous
organization, can only detect the endogenous crashes, we propose using the confidence indicator
as a classification proxy to distinguish between endogenous crash and exogenous crash in the
financial markets. In order to ensure the classification robustness of crash types and reduce the
classification errors due to model over-fitting and other potential issues in the calibration process,
a series of specified LPPLS confidence indicator values based on the LPPLS fitting windows and
8

the time series attributes of the asset price trajectory can be used as thresholds to identify the
crash types. As a rule of thumb, a value LPPLS confidence interval greater than 5% for the daily
price trajectory or 2% for weekly price trajectory, signals that the price process is unsustainable
and bears a substantial risk for an impending critical transition, thereby the value of 5% and 2%
are adopted in this study as the threshold for the daily and weekly price trajectory, respectively.
Given a specified time point, if the associated confidence indicator value exceeds the specified
threshold value, we conclude that the signatures of the LPPLS model have been identified in the
corresponding price trajectory, and the price trajectory is indeed in an endogenous bubble state
reaching a state of system instability, and thus any small disturbances would have the potential to
trigger a mature bubble to burst resulting in an endogenous crash. In contrast, if the confidence
indicator value at a given time point is lower than the specified threshold, the evidence is not
enough to conclude that the price trajectory clearly contain the signature of LPPLS model, and so
the price trajectory may not be in an endogenous bubble state. Small disturbances will not be
able to trigger the crash of a price trajectory outside a bubble status. The crash of a price
trajectory in a state of system stability can only be caused by large external shocks resulting in an
exogenous crash.

3. Empirical Analysis
3.1 Bubble Identification Based on Daily Data
In this section, we have collected the daily data of the 10 major global stock market indexes from
both developed and emergent stock markets, including S&P 500, DJIA, NASDAQ, FTSE, DAX,
NIKKEI, CSI 300, HSI, BSESN, and BOVESPA. The stock market data used in this study came
from Yahoo Finance (https://finance.yahoo.com/). To calculate the LPPLS confidence indicator,
we shrunk the length of time windows 𝑡2 − 𝑡1 from 650 trading days to 30 trading days in steps
of 5 trading days, and moved the endpoint 𝑡2 from January 2, 2019 to November 6, 2020. The
LPPLS confidence indicator for a specified time is causal because it is computed using the prior
data only. Both the positive and the negative bubbles in this study were detected based on the
daily data of the stock market indexes. The positive bubble is related to accelerating price
increase and is vulnerable to regime changes in the form of crashes or volatile sideway plateaus.
In contrast, the negative bubble is associated with accelerating price decrease, and is prone to
regime changes in the form of rallies or volatile sideway plateaus.
Figure 2 shows the LPPLS confidence indicator for positive bubbles in red and negative bubble
in green along with the index price in blue for the 10 major stock market indexes based on daily
data from January 2, 2019 to November 6, 2020. We can intuitively perceive the confidence
level of the observed LPPLS bubble patterns in Figure 2, because the sensitivity of the bubble
pattern to the start time point is measured by the LPPLS confidence indicator. The confidence
indicator can reach a high enough value, say 10%, when the LPPLS bubble patterns exist in a
substantial number of fitting windows for a specified pseudo-present time, indicating the
detected LPPLS bubble pattern is reliable and not sensitive to the choice of the start time points - thereby the price trajectory in bubble regime can be confirmed. In contrast, the confidence
indicator can be low close to zero, say 1%, when the bubble patterns are only observed in few
fitting time windows for a specified pseudo-present time, which indicates the detected LPPLS
9

bubble pattern is sensitive to the choice of the start time points and the over-fitting risk may exist
-- therefore the price trajectory is less likely to be in a bubble regime.
Figure 2 (a) shows the detected SP500 bubble status, including three obvious clusters of positive
bubbles: between December 12, 2019 and January 29, 2020, between February 10 and February
21, 2020, and between August 6 and September 4, 2020, and one subtle cluster of negative
bubble between March 17 and March 27, 2020. The positive confidence indicator reaches the
maximum value of 16% on Feb 19, 2020 in the cluster between February 10 and February 21,
2020, which means that the 20 out of 125 fitting windows can successfully pass the filter
conditions. It indicates that the detected LPPLS pattern is reliable, and the positive bubble status
on February 19, 2020, can be confirmed. It is highly possible that the accelerating increase trend
of the SP500 index is not sustainable, and the regime change of the SP500 index is prone to
occur. The prediction was confirmed by the fact that the SP500 dropped dramatically from
3,386.1 on February 19, 2020 to 2,237.4 on March 23, 2020, losing 33.9% of its value within 24
trading days. In the positive bubble cluster between August 6 and September 4, 2020, the
positive confidence indicator reaches the peak of 8.8% on September 3, 2020, corresponding to
the fact that the SP500 decreased by 9.6% from 3,580.8 on September 2, 2020 to 3,236.9 on
September 23, 2020.
During the period of the 2020 stock market crash, similar detected patterns of positive bubble
shown in Figure 2 (a) for the S&P 500 can also be found in other subfigures in Figure 2,
including: (b) DJIA, (c) NASDAQ, (e) DAX, (g) CSI300, (i) BSESN, and (j) BOVESPA. It
should be noted that a subtle cluster of positive bubble in Figure 2 (d) FTSE can be observed
from December 24, 2019 to February 13, 2020 with the peak value of 0.8%. The confidence
indicator value of 0.8% represents that only 1 out of 125 fitting windows can successfully pass
the filter conditions, indicating that the detected LPPLS positive bubble pattern is not reliable,
and the over-fitting risk may exist. The similar patterns of a hint of a positive bubble like that
shown in Figure 2 (d) can also be observed in two other subfigures, namely, Figure 2 (f) NIKKEI
and (h) HSI.
In Figure 2, we can notice that clusters of positive bubbles sometimes overlap with clusters of
negative bubbles. For example, as shown in Figure 2 (h) HSI, a subtle cluster of positive bubbles
can be observed from July 17, 2020 to September 3, 2020 with the peak confidence indicator of
1.6%, while a noticeable cluster of negative bubble exists in the same time frame with the peak
confidence indicator of 6.4%. The overlap of different types of clusters is due to the fact that an
asset price trajectory may be at a trough on a short-term time scale while approaching a peak on
a long-term scale, and vice versa.
Table 1 summarizes the statistics of positive bubble detection results for the 10 stock market
indexes based on daily data during the COVID crash from February to April 2020 and the related
information of the peaks and valleys. It can be observed that the BOVESPA index in Brazil stock
market has the largest crash size of 45.4%, followed by the DAX index in Germany stock market
with the crash size of 38.8%. Surprisingly, 8 out of 10 indexes lost more than 30% of their values
within five weeks in this crash. The CSI300 index in Chinese stock market and HSI index in
Hongkong stock market suffered relatively less loss, dropping 16.1% and 21.5%, respectively.

10

In this study, the 5% confidence indicator value based on the empirical analysis was used as the
threshold to classify crash types for short-term analysis where the bubble signals are expected to
be stronger than those in the long-term analysis. The peak confidence indicator (CI) values and
the types of crash for the 10 major stock market indexes during the 2020 global stock market
crash are listed in Table 1. Seven out of 10 indexes, including SP500, DJIA, NASDAQ, DAX,
CSI300, BSESN, and BOVESPA, have a peak confidence indicator value exceeding the 5%
threshold during the COVID crash, signifying that the price trajectories of these seven indexes
clearly feature the signatures of the LPPLS model endogenous bubble state, indicating that the
subsequent crashes in these seven indexes during the 2020 global stock market crash are
endogenous stemming from the increasingly systemic instability of the stock markets. In contrast,
the peak confidence indicator values for the remaining three indexes: FTSE, NIKKEI, and HSI,
are far less than the threshold value of 5%, indicating the absence of clear LPPLS bubble
signatures in these price trajectories, and hence the subsequent crashes are exogenous stemming
from the large external shocks, such as, the COVID-19 pandemic-induced market instability, the
mass hysteria, the corporate debt bubble, etc.

*Note: To ensure the classification robustness, the 5% confidence indicator value is used here as the threshold.

An interesting finding in Figure 2 is that most of the stock market indexes during the 2020 global
stock market crash dropped to the valley at the same day on March 23, 2020. Since then, the
price trajectories began to rise, and the global stock markets changed the regime from the bear
market to the bull market. However, most of the confidence indicator cluster of negative bubble
during this period shown in Figure 2 have peak values far less than the threshold of 5%,
indicating that there are no apparent LPPLS negative bubble pattern presented in the price
trajectories of these 10 stock market indexes and the subsequent regime changes are exogenous
resulting from external factors. On March 23, 2020, the finance ministers and central bank
executives from the world’s 20 largest economies (G20) agreed to develop a joint action plan to
address the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and to help stabilize public confidence
and the markets (Japantimes, 2020). On the same day, the Federal Reserve had committed to
using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy and announced that the FOMC would
purchase Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities in unlimited amounts to
stabilize market functioning (FED, 2020). Under the condition that assets are difficult to sell,
11

such purchases not only injected cash into the economy and helped restore normal functioning of
key market, but also conveyed that the Fed stood ready to backstop important parts of the
financial system (Ihrig et al., 2020). Other external shock events on March 23, 2020 included the
Reserve Bank of India's injection of ₹1 trillion in repo operations (RBI, 2020), and the purchase
of 800 billion yen of government bonds by the Bank of Japan on the open market (Mogi, 2020),.
The federal reserves and central banks across the world may have played a critical role in
quelling the 2020 global stock market crash, by adopting extensive measures to provide investors
and markets with unprecedented supports, such as injecting cash into the economy, cutting their
interest rates, and so forth.

Figure 2. LPPLS confidence indicator for positive bubbles is shown in red and negative bubbles
in green (right scale) along with the index price in blue (left scale), for the 10 major stock market
indexes based on daily data from January 2019 to November 2020.
3.2 Bubble Identification Based on Weekly Data
In this section, we investigated the 2020 global stock market crash based on the weekly data
from a long-term time scale. The weekly data of price trajectory was extracted in the interval of
the 5 trading days from the daily trading data. Based on the extracted weekly price trajectory, we
shrunk the length of time windows 𝑡2 − 𝑡1 from 650 data points to 30 data points in steps of 5
data points, and moved the endpoint 𝑡2 from January 8, 2019 to November 9, 2020 to calculate
the LPPLS confidence indicator. The bubble status of stock market index for a specified time
point would be detected by using the data of the previous 30 to 650 data points, which
corresponds to about 300 to 6500 calendar days, that is, about ten months to eighteen years.
15

Figure 3 shows the LPPLS confidence indicator for positive bubbles in red and negative bubble
in green along with the index price in blue for the 10 major stock market indexes based on
weekly data from January 8, 2019 to November 9, 2020. By using the previous data from about
ten months to eighteen years before a specified time point, Figure 3 provides the useful insights
into the bubble status from a long-term time scale. Figure 3 (a) presents the bubble status for the
SP500 index. An obvious cluster of positive bubbles formed between January 21, 2020 and
March 11, 2020 with the peak value of 16% on February 19, 2020 as shown in Figure 3 (a). This
demonstrates that the S&P 500 index during the 2020 stock market crash presented a significant
signature of the LPPLS model, and a positive bubble had been formed endogenously even
detectable by using the prior data from up to eighteen years before the COVID crash. We also
observed the distinct LPPLS bubble patterns in other same six subfigures in Figure 3 as in Figure
3 (a), including (b) DJIA, (c) NASDAQ, (e) DAX, (g) CSI300, (i) BSESN, and (j) BOVESPA.
Once again, the same three remaining subfigures: (d) FTSE, (f) NIKKEI, and (h) HSI, do not
show any detectable signature of the LPPLS model during the COVID crash, indicating that
there is no endogenous positive bubble present in these three price trajectories. Furthermore,
from Figure 3, we can not observe any LPPLS negative bubble pattern in the price trajectories of
the 10 indexes during the COVID crash, which represents that these price trajectories did not
present the two significant features of negative endogenous bubbles, that is, the superexponential decline and the accelerating log-periodic oscillations, and the regime changes from
the decline trend to growth trend were exogenous resulting from the external shocking events.
The above observation results are consistent with the findings in Figure 2.
It can be also observed that the positive and negative bubble status measured by the confidence
indicator in Figure 3 based on the weekly data may be significantly different from the results
shown in Figure 2 based on the daily data. For example, the positive bubble clusters of DJIA
index in Figure 3 (b) have a significantly different shape compared with the results in Figure 2
(b). The confidence indicator of positive bubble has a peak value of 21.6% in Figure 2 (b),
indicating that the 27 out of 125 fitting windows can successfully pass the filter conditions, while
this value in Figure 3 (b) is just 3.2%, that is, only the 4 out of 125 fitting have the signature of
LPPLS model. This is a reasonable phenomenon because an asset price trajectory may exhibit a
super-exponential growth in a short-term time scale, while it may present an exponential growth
in a long-term scale, and vice versa.
Table 2 summarizes the statistics of positive bubble detection results for the 10 stock market
indexes based on weekly data during 2020 global stock market crash from February to April
2020. Since the weekly price trajectory is extracted from the daily trading price trajectory, the
dates and prices of peaks and valleys during the 2020 stock market crash may be slightly
different from the corresponding values in Table 1.
Compared with a time series studied on a shorter time interval for a given trajectory, time series
on a longer-time interval has smoother shape and fewer variations, so the LPPLS confidence
indicator is more robust on the long-interval time series than that from the short-interval time
series. Therefore this study has adopted the less conservative 2% confidence indicator value as
the threshold for the weekly data to classify the type of crashes. From Table 2, the crashes in the
SP500, DJIA, NASDAQ, DAX, CSI300, BSESN, and BOVESPA are seen as endogenous, while
16

the crashes in the FTSE, NIKKEI, and HSI are exogenous. The classification results based on the
weekly data in Table 2 are consistent with those based on the daily data in Table 1.

3.3 Bubble Identification Based on Monthly Data
We adopted the monthly data in this section to investigate the 2020 global stock market crash.
To generate the monthly time series of price trajectory, we extracted the data in the interval of
the 21 trading days from the daily trading time series. To calculate the monthly confidence
indicator, the length of time windows 𝑡2 − 𝑡1 is shrunk from 650 data points to 30 data points in
steps of 5 data points based on the monthly time series, and the endpoint 𝑡2 is moved from
October 15, 2020 through January 17, 2019. The monthly confidence indicator can detect the
bubble status for a specified time point by using the previous 30 to 650 data points, which
corresponds to about three and a half years to seventy-seven years. Due to the data limitation,
most of stock markets did not exist about half a century ago; we only studied the bubble status of
the S&P 500 index.
Figure 4 presents the LPPLS confidence indicator for positive bubbles in red and negative bubble
in green along with the index price in blue for the S&P5 00 index based on monthly data from
January 17, 2019 to October 15, 2020. From Figure 4, we can see an obvious cluster of positive
bubbles between January 17, 2020 and February 19, 2020 with the peak value of 4% on February
19, 2020. This shows that, for the S&P 500 index, the LPPLS bubble patterns observed in the
2020 global stock market crash on daily and weekly scales have persisted on the monthly scale - this positive endogenous bubble can be detected even using prior data from up to seventy-seven

21

years before the 2020 stock market crash. Not surprisingly, there is no LPPLS negative bubble
pattern presented in the price trajectory of the S&P 500 index during the COVID crash.

4, Conclusions
In this study, we applied the LPPLS methodology using a multi-scale time series analysis
paradigm to disclose the underlying mechanisms of the 2020 global stock market crash by
analyzing the trajectories of 10 major stock market indexes from both developed and emergent
stock markets, including the S&P 500, the DJIA, and the NASDAQ from the United State, the
FTSE from the United Kingdom, the DAX from Germany, the NIKKEI from Japan, the CSI 300
from China, the HSI from Hong Kong, the BSESN from India, and the BOVESPA from Brazil.
In order to effectively distinguish between endogenous crash and exogenous crash in stock
market, we have proposed using the LPPLS confidence indicator as a classification proxy
because the LPPLS model, rooted on the transient super-exponential growth of asset trajectories
from self-reinforcing cooperative herding and imitative behaviors through interactions between
market participants involving long-term memory processes of an endogenous organization, can
only detect the endogenous crashes.
We investigated the 2020 global stock market crash, also referred to as the COVID crash, from
different time scales by adopting both the daily data and the weekly data, which can provide
insights into the bubble status from approximate forty days to two and a half years, and from
about ten months to eighteen years, respectively. Our results show that the distinct LPPLS
bubble patterns of the super-exponential increase corrected by the accelerating logarithmperiodic oscillations have presented clearly in the price trajectories of seven indexes: S&P500,
DJIA, NASDAQ, DAX, CSI300, BSESN, and BOVESPA -- signifying that large positive
bubbles have formed endogenously prior to the ‘COVID’ crash and the subsequent crashes for
these seven indexes are endogenous, stemming from the increasingly systemic instability of the
stock markets, while the well-known external shocks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the
corporate debt bubble, and the 2020 Russia–Saudi Arabia oil price war, only acted as sparks
during the 2020 global stock market crash. In contrast, the obvious signatures of LPPLS model
have not been observed in the price trajectories of the remaining three indexes: FTSE, NIKKEI,
and HSI, indicating that the crashes in these three indexes are exogenous caused by external
shocks such as the COVID-19 pandemic etc. – and hence perhaps only crashes in these three
markets can be truly referred to as the COVID crash.
Besides the positive bubbles, we have also tried to detect negative bubbles among the 10 stock
market indexes – but to no avail. This indicates that the regime changes from a bear market to a
bull market in late March 2020 are exogenous, stemming from external factors. The
unprecedented market and economy rescue efforts from federal reserves and central banks across
the world in unison may have played a critical role in quelling the 2020 global stock market
crash in the nick of time.
Lastly, we have used the monthly data to analyze the bubble status of the S&P 500 index based
on the prior data from about three and a half years to seventy-seven years ago. The results
indicate that the LPPLS positive bubble patterns persisted in the S&P 500 index during the 2020

22

stock market crash -- showing that the positive endogenous bubble can be detected even using
prior data from up to seventy-seven years before the ‘COVID’ crash.
In this work, we propose a novel classification method to unravel the underlying mechanisms of
a stock crash – be it endogenous or exogenous, by adapting the log-periodic power law
singularity (LPPLS) methodology. As an example, we have dissected the 2020 global stock
market crash using a multi-resolution analysis paradigm, and successfully sifted out seven less
COVID related endogenous crashes, and three more COVID related exogenous crashes. This
new classification method can also be used to analyze crash types and regime changes of price
trajectories in other financial markets and/or assets.
