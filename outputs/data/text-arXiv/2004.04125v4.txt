Abstract
During the unfolding of a crisis, it is crucial to determine its severity, yet access to
reliable data is challenging. We investigate the relation between geolocated Tweet
Intensity of initial COVID-19 related tweet at the beginning of the pandemic across
Italian, Spanish and USA regions and mortality in the region a month later. We find
significant proportionality between early social media reaction and the cumulative
number of COVID-19 deaths almost a month later. Our findings suggest that ‘the
crowds’ perceived the risk correctly. This is one of the few examples where the ‘wisdom
of crowds’ can be quantified and applied in practice. This can be used to create real-time
alert systems that could be of help for crisis-management and intervention, especially in
developing countries. Such systems could contribute to inform fast-response policy making
at early stages of a crisis.

Introduction
As of the 2nd of June 2020, a novel coronavirus pneumonia, COVID-191, has infected
an estimated total of 6,194,000 individuals across virtually all the world’s countries
with 376,000 related deaths recorded globally2.
Predicting the spread and forecasting the severity of the COVID- pandemic has
become the focus of many research teams across the globe3–6. There is a shared
agreement that forecasting the spread, growth and severity of the COVID-19
pandemic is a challenging task specially in our globally interconnected world. In this
context, reliable prediction of contagion, growth and fatalities within countries and
the regions in each country, before data is available and widely openly distributed, is
essentially impossible. Despite this challenge, it is recognised that this knowledge is
extremely useful in order to establish targeted confinement areas to contain virus
spread more effectively while reducing the economic and social disruptions due to
lockdown and social distancing strategies which in turn would also allow to allocate
resources efficiently across regions.
Although forecasting a country’s regional spread of COVID-19 severity and its
associated mortality is critical to implement operational healthcare changes and
epidemiological control measures, this is nearly impossible to achieve given the lack
of readily available data at the beginning of the emerging SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
The collective knowledge of a crowd has been used successfully in similar
challenging forecasting scenarios across social and data sciences where it has been
established that collective opinions formed by a group of individuals can sometimes
be more accurate than individual expert opinions. This has been called “the wisdom
of crowds”. As opposed to the common practice of using web-search engine queries
that only indicate seeking knowledge patterns, we focused on assessing the wisdom of
crowds as represented in the social media Twitter platform that was not available at
the time of the past SARS outbreak. We therefore aggregated social media reaction,
expressed by geolocated tweet intensity of COVID-19 related activity, from Italian,
Spanish and United States geopolitical regions at the beginning of the pandemic as
well as their regional mortality data.
To address the challenge of gaining these insights at the onset of a pandemic, when
there is a lack of widely accessible regional-level official data, in the present work we
analysed openly available data from twitter activity across different Italian, Spanish
and United States regions to estimate crowd perception of the severity of the event.
In social sciences it has been established7,8 that the collective aggregate opinion of a
large number of non-experts can, in some contexts, outperform individual experts
when the variable to be determined is not random and their individuals have some
partial information and the ability to process it 7. Social phycology studies have
described crowd wisdom, opinion dynamics and collective knowledge by studying in
which scenarios and ways crowds are wise 8. Several studies have shown that social
media wisdom of crowds, where user interactions are more frequent and opinion
dynamics are heightened, are able to solve challenging forecasting tasks. Successful
examples include improving Wikipedia articles 9; predicting publicly traded securities
stock prices10; the study of collective innovation in modern technological social
networks 11 and; election results forecasting 12 among many others showing that
crowd wisdom, opinion pooling and social media opinion dynamics constitute a
powerful tool in forecasting tasks, even beyond experts’ abilities. These methods

work well especially when groups are large and connected opinion dynamics and
communication allow crowds to process information13. Social media debate is the
result of a complex process of information filtering where individuals gauge official
information with local knowledge and confront their opinions openly. This process
can degenerate in conspiracy theories and foster fake news, but it has been observed
that on average the crowds can process information and weight reality in a rather
accurate way14. While there are some examples of the use of the wisdom of crowds to
estimate relevant variables that are otherwise hard to measure, there is no literature
reporting the use of this collective knowledge gathered from social media tweets for
assessing the spreading of mortality during an emerging pandemic. No previous study
has shown that the collective wisdom of crowds during the initial attention COVID19 social media peak, can strikingly predict the regional cumulative mortality a month
ahead when there were not readily available mortality data sources.
Here we show that such “wisdom of crowds” has been able to predict, ahead of
officially available data, COVID-19 infection severity across countries most affected
by the pandemic. Our findings could underpin the creation of real-time novelty
detection systems aimed at early reporting of SARS-like mortality and thus early
activation of control measures in future pandemics. The wisdom of crowds could also
be used to feed infection diseases explicit models with reliable data sourced locally
from the exposed population when, at the early stages of a pandemic, there are no
other sources of data available. The strength of the predictive association could be
used to inform fast-response policy making where there is lack of readily available
mortality data. As such it provides a scalable tool to increase preparedness and
resilience in similar pandemic scenarios. Furthermore, the wisdom of crowds
capability to infer the value of some variables otherwise unmeasurable can be used to
refine explicit models.
Results
Twitter activity as a proxy for crowd perception of the severity of COVID19.
We have used readily accessible data from twitter activity across different Italian,
Spanish and United States regions to estimate crowd perception of the severity of the
event while it is unfolding in its early stages. We then related the intensity of social
media reaction with the severity of the infection in the same region in terms of the
cumulative number of deaths reported the following month. Our study focuses on
Italy and Spain as these countries have been the most affected at the start of the
pandemic followed more recently by the United States.
The number of active tweet users posting on COVID-19 per day22,25, geolocated24 and
aggregated by the regions of Italy, Spain and the United States is shown in Figure 1a,
1b and 1c respectively. Country regions are coloured according to each country’s geopolitical areas. Figure 1 also shows the growth of positive SARS-CoV-2 cases
nationwide as well as the cumulative number of deaths nationwide caused by
COVID-1915–17. The cumulative mortality per geopolitical region of Italy, Spain and
the United States is shown in Figure 2a, 2b and 2c respectively.
Using the Z-score method we identified for tweet intensity peaks the period 21st to
24th February 2020 for Italy, 24th to 26th February 2020 for Spain and 3rd to 4th March
for the United States (Figure 1a, 1b, 1c). For the United States we observed a first

peak in tweet intensity with Z > 3 around the 25th of February with no apparent
endogenous cause such as change in confirmed cases or deaths (Figure 1c), it is then
followed by a second peak that corresponds to an endogenous spike when the United
States death toll starts to rise. This second United States tweet intensity peak (Figure
1c) was used for our analysis.
Note that Italian regional official data for the pandemic15 was first available on the
24th February 2020 which is after the social media reaction (Figure 1a, Figure 2a).
Moreover, at that time most Italian regions still reported no cases hindering the
possibility of forecasting from official data (Figure 2a). The crowds therefore reacted
on partial information (Figure 1a) that was not trivially obtainable from publicly
available data. We observe an initial peak in late January (Figure 1a), perhaps due to
the start of the epidemic in China, but with little differentiation between Italian
regions. We then observe a second peak of interest from social media in late February
(Figure 1a) that appears to be sparked by the endogenous growth of the infection in
Italy being measured and reported. At the time (21st to 24th February 2020) only
Italian nationwide epidemic data were available and regional or province breakdowns
were only scattered across the news (Figure 1a, Figure 2a).
In order to show whether tweet intensity is related to the severity of COVID19 we
plotted in log scale the cumulative number of deaths for each Italian (Figure 3a) and
Spanish (Figure 3b) regions on the 7th of April 2020 and for the United States regions
(Figure 3c) on the 14th of April 2020 against the mean tweet intensities at the
beginning of the epidemic perception. We used the number of deaths, instead of
population confirmed cases, as these are less dependent on the number of samples
taken for SARS-CoV-2 testing in the wider population. Using population confirmed
cases would have been highly dependent on the country testing strategies which
would require a non-trivial rescaling. In other words, the dependence on testing
strategies would have strengthened the relation with regional population spuriously.
Figure 3 shows the proportionality between the mean tweet intensity at the beginning
of the epidemic’s perception, per region, and the number of deaths approximately one
month forward. This figure demonstrates how the reaction on social media can
correctly detect and rank the epidemic’s impact on different regions one month ahead,
when no official data was available in Italy and the data was insufficient for
forecasting in other countries. This association is least noisy for Italy (Figure 3a) and
Spain (Figure 3b) as these countries were severely affected very early on before the
WHO declared the global pandemic. We note that the regions of Lombardy in Italy,
Madrid in Spain and New York in the United States have the largest initial tweets
intensity reactions and correspond to the most severely affected regions one month
later. Note that the Lazio Italian region (Figure 3a) is an outlier due to politicians and
central bodies tweeting from it as well as national geolocation defaulting to the
capital. For Spain (Figure 3b), the region of “Castilla-La Mancha” was merged with
Madrid as a large section of their population commute between the two and they are
geographically nested. For the US the “District of Columbia”, is over-represented
with tweets from Washington D.C. (Figure 3c).
To assess the strength of the observed association shown in Figure 3 and to verify that
the values of the epidemic are not trivially related to the size of the population in each
region we compared three regression models: model-1, adjusted tweet intensity vs.
log death cases; model-2, log population vs. log death cases and; model-3, adjusted
tweet intensity and log population vs. log death cases.

We log-scaled the population to allow for a fair comparison as we notice a sub-linear
relation to the number of deaths. Table 1 shows coefficients’ significance as well as
R2 for the three weighted and non-weighted regression models for the three countries
analysed in this study. From the data reported in Table 1 we observe that model-1
weighted regression is the most significant with the lowest p-values and the largest
overall R2 values for the Italy and Spain data. It has also a significant p-value and
sizable R2 for the United States. This indicates that tweet intensity is the most
significant variable for the prediction of the number of deaths for Italy and Spain. For
the United States we still observe that tweet intensity is a significant predictor for the
number of death but results from unweighted regression with model-2 and model-3
reveal that the population of the regions is a better predictor.
We further assessed the strength and significance of the relation between the tweet
intensity and the number of deaths by quantifying non-linear monotonic dependency
with Spearman’s Rho correlation (Table 2). We observe that the significance level for
Spearman’s Rho correlation for Italy is at 99% and both the United States and Spain
are significant to 95% significance level (Table 2). This confirms that there is a
significant relation between regional early tweet intensity s and the number of deaths
in the respective regions for all three countries.
Discussion
The wisdom of crowds has been used successfully to estimate relevant variables that
are otherwise hard to measure in several domains including the medical one28. Despite
this, there is no literature reporting the use of the wisdom of crowds gathered from
social media tweets for assessing the spreading of severity within an emerging
pandemic where there is no readily access to mortality data.
Our study shows statistically significant evidence that COVID-19 related mean tweet
intensity per region, at the first endogenous attention spike, is able to significantly
forecast the spreading of COVID-19 severity, as measured by number of deaths, one
month forward. In the case of Italy, the crowd’s reaction with predictive power was
recorded before any official regional contagion data was available. For Spain and the
United States, the crowd still reacted when little data was available to make any
forecast.
As the pandemic progressed, Italy, then rapidly followed by Spain, were the first
countries affected with extremely high COVID-19 associated mortality. Italy and
Spain were therefore less influenced by discussions about the general global status of
the pandemic, as less attention was present at the time. This allowed us to analyse the
reaction from social media crowds with less biases. Moreover, Italy is made up of a
good number of regions of comparable size with good social media usage as well as
good official data for social media usage.
We show that the intensity of COVID-19 related twitter activity is able to correctly
identify the localities most affected by the pandemic in each of the considered
countries. These localities are Lombardy, Madrid and New York for Italy, Spain and
the United States respectively (Figure 3). These geo-political and administrative
localities have a striking social media reaction (Figure 1, Figure 3). This suggests that
the initial reaction of users on social media had efficiently processed data scattered
throughout news channels, merged it with local information and performed an

accurate risk assessment which is observable in the social media intensity reaction.
We highlight in particular for Italy that Emilia Romagna and Veneto did not seem to
be less affected than Lombardy at the beginning of the epidemic spread, however,
nonetheless, crowd wisdom seems to have combined different information sources to
highlight the perception of a greater danger in Lombardy (Figure 2a, Figure 3a). In
Italian and Spanish regions, the crowds demonstrated a remarkable ability to predict
the severity of COVID-19 impact at regional levels before the availability of official
data. The regression results demonstrate that the intensity of COVID-19 related
tweeds is a better predictor than the population size obtaining goodness of fit R2
values that are almost twice. For the United States we also demonstrated a significant
predictability power of the tweet intensity, however in this case the regional
population size is a better regressor. We might note that spreading of the pandemic in
the United States started later when an amount of exogenous information was already
circulating in the social media, furthermore the United States have a much wider
variety of climate, culture, political guidance, population density, and total population
throughout states that leads to a more difficult detection of the phenomenon (Figure
3c).
The crowd’s reaction to COVID-19 spreading measured through tweet intensity on
regional basis is a complex quantity rich of information. People react to both official
information and to local knowledge gathered at personal level. Tweets are a process
involving both sharing and comparing such information which includes a level of
collective processing and assessing of the reliability of the source. It has been already
recognized in the literature that such a process can be in average very accurate. It
should not be therefore surprizing that the crowd interest measured through COVID19 related tweet intensity can result in an appropriate estimate of the local severity of
the epidemics.
The practical relevance of our results consists in the demonstration that tweet
intensity can be used for forecasting. At the beginning of an epidemics it is extremely
difficult to have precise information and therefore modelers and public officials are
obliged to use general statistical quantities to produce forecasts and consequently
implement decisions. Our work shows that the information locally available to the
population permeates through twitter and social media and can be made available to
modellers and policymakers at the early stages of a crisis when it is most needed.
Materials and Methods
COVID-19 and population data sources.
We obtained COVID-19 spreading and casualties time series aggregated by region
from the official department of health website or repository for Italy15 and Spain16.
For the United States we used the readily available New York Times dataset17 which
contains regional level data as well as an interactive package for live monitoring.
For Italy we obtained both population data per region18 and social media usage
statistics per region19, both updated as of 2019, from Istituto Nazionale di Statistica
(ISTAT). We obtain regional population data for Spain from Istituto Nacional de
Estadística (INE) as of 201920 and for the United States from the United States
Census Bureau21.

Social media data crawling and processing.
We obtained all twitter data from an early COVID-19 twitter data repository22
available before Twitter started providing access to its own COVID-19 dataset.
Tweets were collected from the 21st of January 2020 using Twitter’s Application
Programming Interface (API)23. The Twitter repository is updated as new meaningful
COVID-19 related words emerge 23. Using tweet unique identifiers (IDs), we
retrieved all their corresponding information (text, date, user and user data) from the
repository via the “twarc” package (https://github.com/DocNow/twarc). This process
is commonly referred to as tweet hydration. To measure the number of unique active
users per day in each of the regions of Italy, Spain and the United States, we
geolocated tweets with the HERE Geocoder service24 and obtained country and region
categorization for over 50% of the tweets. In order to facilitate dataset reading and
tabulation we used Google’s OpenRefine API25 that efficiently groups hourly tweet
data by day and convert nested dictionary type files in JavaScript Object Notation
(JSON) to simple tabular comma separated values.
We defined tweet volume as the number of unique users active in a region per day,
discussing COVID-19 related topics. This criterion is applied, rather than merely
counting tweets, in order to measure the population’s attention and news spreading in
the crowd, while correcting for overrepresented twitter activity from certain users. To
account for different sizes of regions’ populations we calculate tweet intensity by
normalizing the tweet volume by region population in the case of Spain and the
United States or by social media active population in the case of Italy. Indeed, Italy
was the only country for which we were able to obtain specific social media usage
data per region.
Identification of tweet intensity peaks
In order to identify the beginning of the social media reaction to the epidemic in each
country we computed the z-score on the tweet activity time series on two weeks
rolling window. We used Z>3 as the identifier of the social media reaction peak.
Regression analyses
Weighted and non-weighted linear regressions models were carried out using the
python package “statsmodels.api”26 (python version 3.7). The Weighted Least
Squares (WLS) function was uses for weighted linear regression (with intercept) and
the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) function was used for unweighted linear regression
(with intercept). The weighted regressions account for variability in the data by
weighting the error proportionally to the square root of region population. This
adjustment accounts for error measurements both in number of deaths and twitter
volume. Regression p-values are calculated by the “.summary()” function of the
“.fit()” method for the OLS and WLS functions. This derives from Chi Squared
survival function of “scipy.stats”27 (scipy.stats.chi2.sf()) applied to the test statistics,
which is assumed to be Chi Square distributed.
Correlation analyses
Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient was calculated using the “spearmanr”
function of “scipy.stats”27. In order to assess the strength of this correlation we

compare it with null-hypothesis correlation values for random shuffling of the data
and obtain quantile confidence intervals. We hence obtain confidence levels for
comparison with the random null model.
