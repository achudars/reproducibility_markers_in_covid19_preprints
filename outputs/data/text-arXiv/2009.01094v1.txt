Abstract:
The main reasons for the ongoing COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic are
the unavailability of recommended efficacious drugs or vaccines along with the human to
human transmission nature of SARS-CoV-2 virus. So, there is urgent need to search
appropriate therapeutic approach by repurposing approved drugs. In this communication,
molecular docking analyses of two influenza antiviral drugs baloxavir acid (BXA) and
baloxavir marboxil (BXM) were performed with the three therapeutic target proteins of severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), i.e., main protease (Mpro), papainlike protease (PLpro) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). The molecular docking
results of both the drugs BXA and BXM were analysed and compared. The investigational
drug BXA binds at the active site of Mpro and RdRp, whereas the approved drug BXM binds
only at the active site of RdRp. Also, comparison of dock score revealed that BXA is binding
more effectively at the active site of RdRp than BXM. The computational molecular docking
revealed that the drug BXA may be more effective against COVID-19 as compared to BXM.

1. Introduction
The ongoing COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic is caused by the virus
strain severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [1-3]. The virus was
detected first at Wuhan, China in December, 2019, and as of 10th July 2020, globally total
12102328 confirmed COVID-19 cases were reported with the death of 551046. Till today,
there is no recommended drugs or vaccines available to fight against the COVID-19. Therefore,
to deal with this human to human transmissible SARS-CoV-2 virus, there is an emergent need
to search potential drugs and/or phytochemicals that can be repurposed against the COVID-19
infection [4]. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drugs like
remdesivir, favipiravir and tocilizumab etc. are under clinical trials to deal with the COVID19 [5-7]. Most of the repurposing drugs are under initial phases of clinical trials and require
further studies on their effectiveness and safety in the treatment of COVID-19. Therefore, the
research work to search new potential drugs are also ongoing globally that can be repurposed
against COVID-19.
For the drug repurposing research, the computer-based molecular docking and
simulations studies were carried out to find the drug that bind effectively at the therapeutic
target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 virus. SARS-CoV-2, the positive-sense single-stranded
ribonucleic acid (ssRNA) virus is the new and seventh member of human coronaviruses
(HCoVs) that has beta-coronavirus genus like severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
(SARS-CoV, first detected in 2003) and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERSCoV, first detected in 2012), with 26 to 32 kilobases and spheroid-shaped of 50-200 nm in
diameter [8]. The virus has four important structural proteins, i.e., spike (S), membrane (M),
envelope (E) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. The proteins S, M and E create the envelope of
the SARS-CoV-2, where the club-shaped spike protein binds with the human host cells
angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and initiates the viral entry [9]. Once the virus
entered into host cells, the functional proteins like main protease (Mpro or 3CLpro), papain2

like protease (PLpro) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) play the vital role in viral
replication and transcription [10]. Therefore, the proteins like ACE2, Mpro, PLpro, RdRp and
spike glycoprotein are studied as therapeutic targets for the structure-based molecular docking
and simulations to search potential inhibitors from the databases of approved drugs and
phytochemicals.
Similar to COVID-19 symptoms, the influenza (flu) caused by influenza viruses is an
acute respiratory infectious disease. The transmission of the flu viruses also occurs by contact,
droplets and fomites. The heterotrimeric RNA polymerase of influenza virus composed of three
protein subunits, polymerase acidic protein (PA), polymerase basic protein 1 (PB1), and
polymerase basic protein 2 (PB2), that play a vital role in the viral replication. Based on a “capsnatching” mechanism, the PB2 subunit interacts with the host nascent capped transcripts and
subsequently cleaved by the cap-dependent endonuclease (CEN) present in PA subunit. The
RNA primer generated from the “cap-snatching” mechanism is utilized by RNA-dependent
RNA polymerase (RdRp) of PB1 for viral transcription [11]. The influenza antiviral drugs
baloxavir marboxil (BXM) was approved in 2018 by FDA to treat influenza (Fig. 1), which
can selectively inhibit the RNA replication activity of CEN [12,13]. The recent in vitro study
of BXM revealed that the active form baloxavir acid (BXA) inhibits the viral RNA
transcription by inhibiting the enzymatic activity of CEN selectively that ceases the viral
replication in infected cells without any cytotoxicity [14]. More recent study on the antiviral
drugs BXM and oseltamivir on influenza revealed that the BXM prevents transmission by
blocking the virus replication more effectively and completely than the oseltamivir [15].
Despite the potential inhibiting ability of BXM and BXA on influenza treatment, there are only
a few clinical trials on COVID-19 [16,17].
Considering the need of new potential drugs to repurpose against COVID-19 pandemic,
this research was carried out to investigate the effective binding of the drugs BMX and BXA
with the three functional proteins of SARS-CoV-2, i.e., Mpro, PLpro and RdRp. The molecular
3

docking of the drugs were performed with the therapeutic target proteins and their affinity of
binding at the active site was compared.

2. Experimental
The molecular docking analyses were done in AutoDock Vina [18] to screen the most
effective drugs between the BXA and BXM. The 3D structure of the drugs were downloaded
from the PubChem (https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). The crystal structures of the proteins
Mpro (PDB ID: 6LU7), PLpro (PDB ID: 4MM3) and RdRp (PDB ID: 6M71) were retrieved
from the PDB database (www.rcsb.org). These proteins were modelled by using the protein
template of pdb structure from the online server SWISS-MODEL. The proteins and drugs were
prepared for molecular docking by utilizing the AutoDock tools. The grid box dimensions
(55.59 Å × 72.96 Å × 75.01 Å) centered at (-24.839, 13.571, 58.159) for the Mpro, the grid
box dimensions (55.59 Å × 72.96 Å × 75.01 Å) centered at (-26.097, 19.781, 27.145) for the
PLpro, and the grid box dimensions (77.17 Å × 88.61 Å × 101.09 Å) centered at (120.50,
119.46, 128.42) for the RdRp were generated to cover the whole protein structure. Total ten

4

poses with the best docking score were saved and the output files were analysed using the
visualisation software BioVia Discovery Studio.

3. Results and discussion
With the advancement of computational facilities and the accuracy of the prediction,
the computer-based molecular docking gained a huge popularity in the field of drugs design
and discovery. Molecular docking can determine the binding affinity and binding poses at the
active site of the target proteins. The binding affinity referred as the dock score determine the
stability of the protein-ligand complex formed, whereas the binding poses at the active site will
provide evidence on the efficacy of the ligand to inhibit the enzymatic activity [19]. Therefore,
to provide computational evidence on the comparative potency of the two influenza antiviral
drugs BXA and BXM (Fig. 1), the molecular docking experiments were performed in
Autodock Vina with the therapeutic target proteins of SARS-CoV-2, i.e., Mpro, PLpro and
RdRp.
The blind molecular docking was performed where the grid box was selected to cover
the whole protein structure. The ten best dock score poses of the drugs BXA and BXM with
the proteins Mpro, PLpro and RdRp were saved, and the protein-ligand interaction study was
performed. The drugs BXA and BXM bind with the protein PLpro with the dock score ranging
from -8.9 to -7.2 kcal/mol and -7.0 to -6.5 kcal/mol respectively, but the in silico protein-ligand
interaction study revealed that no binding poses found at the active site consists of the three
catalytic triad (CYS112, HIS273 and ASP287) of the PLpro [20]. Therefore, the enzymatic
activity of PLpro is not inhibited by the BXA and BXM. With the Mpro, analyses of the ten
best binding poses of BXA and BXM revealed that the drug BMX with dock score ranging
from -8.3 to -6.5 kcal/mol failed to bind at the active site present at the catalytic dyad CYS145
and HIS41 [21]. In contrast, the drug BXA binds at the active site of Mpro with the estimated
dock score of -7.4 kcal/mol and therefore expected to interfere with the activity of Mpro. The
5

posing ligand BXA binds exclusively at the target chain of Mpro where the active site is located
(Fig. 2). BXA formed Van der Waals (VDW) and pi-alkyl interactions with the catalytic dyad
of Mpro HIS41 and CYS145, respectively. The effective binding between BXA and Mpro can
also be examined from the multiple non-covalent bindings with other residues at the active site
(Fig. 2a-b). BXA formed VDW bonds with the residues ASP187, HIS164, GLY143, SER144,
HIS163 and HIS172. The residues ARG188 and LEU141 are involved in the carbon hydrogen
bond. The fluorine atoms of BXA are participated in halogen bonds with the residues PHE140,
ASN142 and GLU166. The alkyl and pi-alkyl bonds are observed with the residues MET49
and MET165. In addition, the sulphur atom of BXA also participates in the non-covalent
interaction with the GLN189. Further, the 3D binding pose of BXA at the active site of Mpro
supporting the high stability of the BXA-Mpro complex (Fig. 2c). It is also important to
mention here that the binding energy of BXA is comparably higher than the drugs like
oseltamivir (-4.7 kcal/mol), ritonavir (-7.3 kcal/mol), remdesivir (-6.5 kcal/mol), ribavirin (5.6 kcal/mol), favipiravir (-5.4 kcal/mol), chloroquine (-5.1 kcal/mol) and hydroxychloroquine
(-5.3 kcal/mol) [22].

The drugs BXA and BXM bind with the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp protein with the dock
score ranging from -9.3 to -8.1 kcal/mol and -9.0 to -7.4 kcal/mol, respectively. The SARSCoV-2 RdRp plays major role in the viral transcription and replication, and therefore RdRp is
the most promising therapeutic target protein for searching repurpose drugs. The modelled
SARS-CoV-2 RdRp protein structure consists of nsp12 that bound to nsp7 and nsp8 domains.
In nsp12 [23], the RNA polymerase domain consists of a finger subdomain residues from 366
to 581 and 621 to 679, a palm subdomain residues from 582 to 620 and 680 to 815, and a thumb
subdomain residues from 816 to 920. These polymerase residues formed the catalytic pocket
of SARS‐CoV‐2 RdRp. The protein-ligand interaction study revealed that both the drugs BXA
and BXM are binding at the active site of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp protein with the dock score of 8.1 and -7.6 kcal/mol, respectively. The docking results supporting the ability of the influenza
antiviral drugs BXA and BXM to inhibit the activity of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp protein. Based on
the dock score, the effectiveness of the investigational drug BXA is comparably better than the
approved drug BXM to inhibit the activity of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. In addition, the dock score
7

of BXA and BXM at the active site of RdRp is comparably better that the antiviral drugs like
remdesivir and ribavirin [24].
The docking pose of BXA with the RdRp protein is shown in Fig. 3. BXA is forming
hydrogen bond with the residue ARG569. VDW interactions are observed with the residues
ILE589, GLY683, LYS500, TYR689, ASP684 and LYS577. Residues ALA688 and LEU576
are forming pi-alkyl interactions with BXA. BXA also formed the halogen and carbon
hydrogen bonds with the residues SER682 and ALA685, respectively. The 3D dock pose of
BXA-RdRp complex indicating that the drug BXA is well buried inside the catalytic pocket
and the complex structure is stabilized by multiple non-covalent interactions (Fig. 3b-c).
Similar to BXA, the BXM-RdRp complex structure is also stabilized by various non-covalent
bonds (Fig. 4). The residues ARG569 and GLN573 formed conventional hydrogen bonds with
BXM. The VDW interactions were observed with the residues ILE589, ASN496, ASN497,
ILE494 and ALA581. The residue TRY689 formed pi-pi interaction, whereas the pi-alkyl
interactions were observed with the residues ALA688, LEU576, ALA685 and ALA580. BXM
also formed a carbon hydrogen bond with the residue LYS577 at the active site.

Finally, we additionally performed the site-specific docking of the drugs by generating
the grid box dimensions (40 Å × 40 Å × 54 Å) centered at (-14.170, 39.730, -39.510) at active
site residue VAL557 and surrounding amino acid residues for the RdRp. The top five poses of
BXA showed the dock score of -8.2, -8.0, -7.8, -7.6 and -7.5 kcal/mol, whereas the drug BXM
showed -7.7, -7.7, -7.6. -7.6 and -7.4 kcal/mol. The dock score and the protein-ligand
interaction study of the top five poses indicating the effective binding of the drugs at the active
site of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. Also, the comparison of dock score clearly delineated that the drug
BXA is showing better binding affinity at the active site as compared to BXM.
4. Conclusions
In summary, we have performed computer-based molecular docking of the new
influenza antiviral drugs BXA and BXM with the three important therapeutic target proteins
9

of SARS-CoV-2. The investigational drug BXA binds at the active site of main protease and
RdRp, whereas the approved drug BXM binds only at the active site of RdRp. Also,
comparison of dock score revealed that BXA is binding more effectively at the active site of
RdRp than BXM. Therefore, we conclude that BXA may be more effective against COVID19 as compared to BXM. Finally, we believe the current outcomes will be useful in formulating
new therapeutic approach to fight against COVID-19.
