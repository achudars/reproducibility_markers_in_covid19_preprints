A BSTRACT
COVID-19 represents the most severe global crisis to date whose public conversation can be studied
in real time. To do so, we use a data set of over 350 million tweets and retweets posted by over 26
million English speaking Twitter users from January 13 to June 7, 2020. In characterizing the complex
retweet network, we identify several stable communities, and are able to link them to scientific expert
groups, national elites, and political actors. We find that scientific expert communities received a
disproportionate amount of attention early on during the pandemic, and were leading the discussion
at the time. However, as the pandemic unfolded, the attention shifted towards both national elites
and political actors, paralleled by the introduction of country-specific containment measures and
the growing politicization of the debate. Scientific experts remained present in the discussion, but
experienced less reach and a higher degree of segregation and isolation. Overall, the emerging
communities are characterized by an increased self-amplification and polarization. This makes it
generally harder for information from international health organizations or authorities to reach a
broad audience. These results may have implications for information dissemination in future global
crises.

Introduction

and other low-quality mis- and disinformation about the
pandemic, peaking in what the WHO now considers an
“infodemic” [17, 18]. Preliminary work focused on this
issue and used social network analysis in order to determine drivers of the conspiracy theory which claims a link
between 5G and COVID-19 [19]. Although misinformation is a major concern, more recent work suggests that
experts and authorities are being heard and have received
disproportionate attention [20], but that key specialists may
experience low reachability [21]. Moreover, other work
finds that key medical professionals and scientific experts
may experience lower “sustained amplification”, meaning
that the attention given to this group has not been constant,
and overall lower, compared to media outlets or key political figures [22]. Our work attempts to clarify the somewhat
ambiguous premises about the role of experts during the
pandemic.

Twitter has been widely used as a tool for emergency response in previous crises and disasters and a large body of
work has focused on optimizing communication in order
to adjust or nudge human behaviour under such conditions [1, 2, 3, 4]. Research finds that during a time of
crisis, when information is scarce and heavily sought after, social media enables the critical flow of information
due to its collaborative nature [5, 6]. However, the underlying network and community structure is likely to have
a significant influence over which information users are
exposed to [7, 8]. In particular, retweet interactions have
been shown to reflect real-life community structure, such
as political parties [9], and to characterize the information
sharing dynamics of different clusters of users [10]. Likewise, communities of users sharing misleading news tend
to be more connected and clustered [11].

2.2 Characterization of communities

Figure 1a shows the network of 1M users (corresponding
to 4.3% of all nodes) randomly sampled but forming a
connected component. Even if the layout algorithm has no
information about the communities we identified, it recovers a similar stratification of the nodes. We observe that
communities A and B fill a great portion of the network,
without being as densely connected as the other communities. Some communities (C, H, F, L) are more peripheral
and exhibit a neat modular structure, which implies a high
degree of internal connectivity (see also Fig S3).

In order to characterize the 15 largest communities, we

results of a Machine Learning classifier, which was trained
to predict the user category based on a user’s description

information was available for 54% of nodes in the network,
while a clear category could be assigned to 25% of considered users (Table S1). Since the diversity in nationality of
the communities is of interest, we calculate the entropy of
the distribution of countries for each community (similarly

In this section, we address these caveats. Here, we only
consider the top 1000 users for each super-community in
terms of retweets received, i.e. 4000 users receiving 55.0%
of all retweets. Furthermore, we adopt an alternative measure to characterize the attention given to users, namely a
retweet h-index, as previously introduced by [22]. Originally proposed in the context of academic citations [24],
the h-index in this case reflects that the user has received
at least h retweets on h of their original tweets.

So far, in our analysis the observed dynamics of supercommunities is a result of the average behavior across all
the users in the Twittersphere, while in reality most of
the dynamics are driven by a relatively small set of users
who receive disproportionate attention. Further, we have
focused on the number of retweets (node out-degree) as a
canonical measure of attention, but the retweet count of a

Generally, users belonging to the political supercommunity are ranked highest both in terms of retweets
and h-index, receiving most of the attention both on a punctual and an extended time scale. National elites and international experts behave very similarly: they rank medium

retweets received (low virality). Lastly, the “Other” category ranks generally lowest in h-index and intermediate in

received, in particular from non-expert communities. As
demonstrated by the high internal attention component,
international experts also shared content frequently among
themselves, possibly in an attempt to rapidly share scientific insights about the novel virus.

We study the full directed retweet network, consisting of
all retweets collected during the entire 147 day observation period (267M retweets). The nodes of the network
represent users who have at least once retweeted or have
been retweeted by another user. An edge was established
from user A to user B if B retweeted A at least once during
the whole period of data collection. Therefore, the edge
direction indicates the flow of information. We assigned
a weight to this edge equal to the number of times user B
has retweeted user A. The reconstructed (weighted and directed) network has 22.9M nodes and 177M unique edges.
In order to study the communities in this network, we consider only the largest connected component of the network,
consisting of 22.5M nodes and 176M unique edges. The
discarded components only consisted of isolated nodes or
duplets, making up 1.57% of the nodes and 0.13% of the
edges in the original network. We ran Louvain’s community detection algorithm [29], as implemented in Python’s
package Networkit [30]. The algorithm attempts to detect
clusters of nodes by recursively maximizing the network’s
modularity. Standard modularity was adopted as a scoring
function, meaning that intra-cluster edges were counted
with the same weight as inter-clusters edges. For the community detection task, we considered the network edges
as undirected in order to reduce the computational burden.
Due to the stochasticity of the clustering algorithm, we

Data collection

Twitter data was collected through the Twitter API, specifically through the filter streaming endpoint, using the
Crowdbreaks platform [28]. The data used in this
work consists of a total of 353,993,900 tweets (thereof
267,026,740 retweets) posted by 26,262,332 users in a
146 day observation period, i.e. from January 13 to June 7,
2020. These tweets have been identified by Twitter to be in
English language and match one or more of the keywords
“wuhan”, “ncov”, “coronavirus”, “covid” and “sars-cov-2”.
Note that keywords have changed over time, as the new
names for virus were introduced (for details refer to SI 1.1
and Table S2). The data is complete with respect to these
keywords, except during a period between mid-March to
mid-April when volume exceeded the 1% threshold imposed by Twitter and was subsampled by an (unknown)
degree.

ran 50 trials and assigned each node to the community it
was most frequently associated with. The identification of
largest communities was found to be stable both among
repeated runs of the algorithm (Figure S6) as well as when
comparing monthly time windows of the dataset (Figure
S7, please refer to SI 1.3 for further details). Thus, the
results of the community detection can be considered as
fairly robust. The coordinates of the network layout in
Figure 1 were processed by Gephi software [31], using the
ForceAtlas2 algorithm [32] with gravity set to 0.05 with
the “stronger gravity” option enabled.

1.1

Data collection

Collection started on January 13, 2020 a few weeks after first reports about a disease outbreak in Wuhan,
China surfaced. Throughout the collection period, the keywords were changed in order to accommodate
for the various ways the virus was referred to (see table 2). Initially the virus was referred to as ”wuhan
virus” and later as 2019-nCoV (2019 novel coronavirus). On February 11 the ICTV (International
Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses) changed the official name to sars-cov-2 and COVID-19, for the
virus and the disease respectively.
Due to the high volume of data small interruptions occurred during data collection when no data was
collected. Four interruptions were for longer than one hour, the longest being 9 hours on April 11.

1.2

Geo-localization of tweets

In order to geo-localize a tweet the following procedure was performed:
1. Geo coordinates (0̃.1% of original tweets in dataset): Tweet contains coordinates (longitude and
latitude) information.
2. Place (2.9%): Users can tag a tweet with a named place. Tweets with place indication contain
structured geo information, including a geographical bounding box.
3. Parsable user location (61.9%): We use the Python library local-geocode1 in order to parse
the user location field. This field contains unstructured text and may reference one or multiple
places and/or countries. It also sometimes contains humorous or imaginary places (e.g. ”the end
of the universe). The local-geocode library makes use of the geonames database and performs
substring matching against place names in this database in order to obtain structured geographical
information (also known as geocoding). In the matching, only places with a population larger
than 30k are considered. local-geocode has been compared against geopy2 (using the Nominatim
library), which is frequently used for this task. Visual inspections of the country-level disagreements
between both tools, indicate that local-geocode generally performs better in this task. This is
likely due to the fact that local-geocode only considers relatively well known places, therefore
ignoring imaginary names whereas geopy attempts to provide a (wrong) result in these cases.
However, human-level benchmarking would need to be conducted in order to come to a final
conclusion on the performance of both tools for Twitter user location decoding.

1.3

Network analysis

Community detection. We applied Louvain’s community detection algorithm (implemented in Python’s
Networkit package, PLM function), setting the default resolution parameter γ = 1. Since each run of
the algorithm produces different results, we run the algorithm for 50 trials and assigned each user to the
community it was mostly found into. On average, about 15 communities reached a size larger than 105
(15.42 ± 0.09) (see Supplementary Fig. 2). In order to assign each user to a community, we counted how
many times each node appeared in the same community along the 50 trials (the same community was
hypothesized to be that of maximal overlap within all trials). The ratio of times each node was found
in the same community was used as a 0-1 score (“community score”) about goodness of identification
of the community associated to each node (Supplementary Fig. 6). Furthermore, we analyzed the overlap of user IDs in communities obtained from the full network and from networks reconstructed with
data aggregated per month. Retweets posted during January and February were lower than the rest of
observational period, so we joined the two months into a single time-window. This means that four temporary networks were built aggregating the retweets sent during January-February, March, April, May
2020 separately. A fair stability over time was observed overall (see Supplementary Fig. 7). Temporal
stability was highest for the largest communities (labelled from A to H), having an average overlap of
72% (min 44%, max 94%) with the most overlapping temporary communities. Also smaller communities,
in particular L, M, and J, showed a fair temporal stability (avg. overlap 57%, min 20%, max 89%).
Top users characterization. The network’s communities are composed by users with different
roles and centrality inside the network. For a finer characterization of the authorities of this retweet

network, we selected as top users the 1000 most retweeted users for each super-community. We computed
well-known centrality measures, with the Python’s package Networkit, and show their correlation in
Supplementary Figure 9. The node betweenness centrality for each user in the network was estimated
considering the shortest paths between 100k randomly sampled nodes. Correlation between centrality
measures do not display different patterns for different super-communities. Out-degree and in-degree
have the meaning of the number of retweets respectively received and sent. The distribution of received
retweets is centered on the highest value for the Political super-community, meaning more attention
received. Clustering coefficient is centered on the lowest value for Other, meaning a sparser and less
modular community.

Figure 3: Internal and external components of the attention towards each community. Each bar represents the number of total retweets received by users in each community, divided into retweets from the
same (blue, with the percentage represented on top of each bar) and from other (orange) communities.
Community C and H, assigned to the political super-community, are the most retweeted communities,
though not the largest. The attention received by these two communities is mainly internal(more than
80%). Community B, assigned to the scientific experts super-community, is the second largest one in
terms of number of users but received few overall attention (5th most retweeted in total). Nevertheless,
it has a high level of reach, ranking 2nd on the highest external attention component.
