Abstract
Background: Facing a global epidemic of new infectious diseases such as
COVID-19, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), which reduce transmission
rates without medical actions, are being implemented around the world to
mitigate spreads. One of the problems in assessing the effects of NPIs is that
different NPIs have been implemented at different times based on the situation of
each country; therefore, few assumptions can be shared about how the
introduction of policies affects the patient population. Mathematical models can
contribute to further understanding these phenomena by obtaining analytical
solutions as well as numerical simulations.
Methods and Results: In this study, an NPI was introduced into the SIR model
for a conceptual study of infectious diseases under the condition that the
transmission rate was reduced to a fixed value only once within a finite time
duration, and its effect was analyzed numerically and theoretically. It was
analytically shown that the maximum fraction of infected individuals and the final
size could be larger if the intervention starts too early. The analytical results also
suggested that more individuals may be infected at the peak of the second wave
with a stronger intervention.
Conclusions: This study provides quantitative relationship between the strength
of a one-shot intervention and the reduction in the number of patients with no
approximation. This suggests the importance of the strength and time of NPIs,
although detailed studies are necessary for the implementation of NPIs in
complicated real-world environments as the model used in this study is based on
various simplifications.

Introduction
Because of the global spread of COVID-19, our human society is facing a major
public health crisis. The COVID-19 pandemic is caused by an emerging pathogen,
SARS-CoV-2, for which there is no immunized population, causing an overshooting
increase in the number of infected patients and depleting medical resources in many
countries. Medical institutions are facing a difficult situation in which they must
control second transmissions while treating critically ill patients, and as the number

Fujiwara et al.

of patients increases, the medical system becomes swiftly tighter. When the number
of patients exceeds the capacity, the quality of medical care deteriorates drastically,
and the number of medical devices required for life support reaches its limit. This
situation further increases the fatality rate of this infectious disease and causes
serious damage to our society.
No effective treatment for COVID-19 has been established yet as of September,
2020, and only a public health approach can function as a control measure for the
epidemic. To mitigate the spread of COVID-19, each country is implementing nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) [1] to regulate social activities. NPIs comprise
policies such as case isolation, voluntary home quarantine, closure of schools and
universities, social distancing, stopping mass gatherings, and border closure. In major European countries, these NPIs were implemented, depending on the epidemic
situation, during the first part of spring in 2020, with different timings and intensities [2, 3]. Although the first phase of the epidemic appeared to be suppressed by
these mitigation measures, the re-epidemic became clearer in almost all countries
because of deregulation after the first epidemic.
Because the control of epidemics by NPIs has caused a situation involving the
imposition of strong restrictions on human socioeconomic activities, it would be
desirable to study in advance the optimal timing, intensity, and duration of interventions that could bring about more promising results with minimal damage to
society. Regarding COVID-19, for the purpose of ex-post verification, the influence
of NPIs implemented in each country on the effective reproduction number was
estimated. In European countries, the correlation between the decay of the effective
reproduction number and the implementation of various NPIs has been verified [3].
The impact of travel limitations in China on the spread of infection has been discussed [4,5]. However, a reliable estimation of the effects of NPIs is difficult, because
the differences in NPI strategies employed by each country are strongly related to
various background factors, such as the epidemic situations, social structure, legal
systems, and culture [2].
Mathematical modelling is an important method for estimating the effect of NPIs.
In particular, the global pandemic of COVID-19 revealed that a situation in which
only NPIs are effective against an emerging infectious disease is possible in societies
in the 2020s. Such a situation had been “neglected” as a practical research target,
which enhances the importance of theoretical approaches. Recently, compartmental
models such as the SIR model [6–9] have been extended to estimate the effects of
NPIs on the number of patients [10–13]. In other settings, optimal policies where
intervention intensity can change continuously over time have been discussed in the
context of minimizing objective functions [14–17]. These solutions are very useful
if we can estimate the effect of NPIs on the change in transmission parameters
precisely.
The impacts of NPIs should be evaluated as a discontinuous change of the transmission rate in a model to represent the temporal discontinuity of intervention in
the real world. The dynamics of the number of infected patients in continuous time
in a system that includes discrete parameters, state spaces, and continuous-time dynamics can be modeled as a hybrid dynamical system [18–22]. This framework has
been applied to mathematical models of infectious diseases [23–25]. In the simplest

Fujiwara et al.

Page 3 of 28

case, the one-shot intervention model, in which the intervention is implemented
only once during the epidemic, can be used to discuss the theoretical dependence
of the effects of NPIs on the timing and intensity [26]. As the COVID-19 epidemic
continues, the accumulation of theoretical research on the effects brought about
by NPIs has become even more significant. Recently, compartmental models with
intervention have been studied both numerically [27, 28] and using some analytical
methods [29, 30] in line with the COVID-19 epidemic.
In this study, we provide exact solutions of a simple SIR model with one-shot intervention, represented by a single discrete reduction in the transmission parameter
during an epidemic. These solutions describe the dependence of the peak number of
infected patients on the reproduction number under consideration of the implementation of NPIs and intervention timing. Theoretical and numerical analyses revealed
non-trivial relations among the intensity of suppression of pandemics via NPIs, the
number of infected individuals at the peaks, and the final size of infection cases. The
methods and results shown in this study provide basic theoretical understanding in
the context of the evaluation of NPIs.

Materials and methods
In this study, we focus on the dependence of the maximum fraction of infected
individuals on the timing of the NPIs. Note that this analysis is motivated by the
COVID-19 epidemic, but we consider a hypothetical epidemic, whose properties are
not necessarily the same as that of COVID-19.
Model
We here introduce the SIR model, where the time evolution of the fraction of susceptible (s(t)), infected (i(t)), and removed (r(t)) individuals is given by the following
ordinary differential equation (ODE):

taking into account the one-shot intervention and the second wave after the intervention. For simplicity, the total population is assumed to be unity, that is,
s(t) + i(t) + r(t) = 1 holds. The summation of the right-hand sides of Eqs. (1)–(3)
vanishes, which guarantees conservation of the total population. Therefore, as seen
below, only Eqs. (1) and (2) are numerically integrated to obtain the time evolutions of s(t), i(t), and r(t). In this model, the basic reproduction number and the
effective reproduction number at time t are given by R0 = β/γ and Rt = βs(t)/γ,
respectively.
Kermack and McKendrick [6] derived the equation for the maximum fraction of
infected individuals and showed that the final size is obtained by solving a transcendental equation with a given R0 in the SIR model without any intervention [7–9].

By applying the technique they employed in the derivation, we here provide the relationship between the fractions of susceptible and removed individuals at arbitrary
times t0 and t1 , that is, s(t0 ), r(t0 ), and s(t1 ), r(t1 ) as

See Supplementary Section 1, Additional File 1 for details of the derivation. All
analytical results presented in this paper are derived based on this equality.
Non-pharmaceutical intervention
In the present framework, an NPI in an isolated population is represented by a
change in the transmission rate β. Let β = βoff (> γ) be the transmission rate without the intervention, and it is switched to βon (< βoff ) when the intervention starts
at t = ton , and restored to βoff at t = toff = ton + ∆t. Let the corresponding basic
reproduction numbers be R0,off = βoff /γ and R0,on = βon /γ, respectively. Here,
∆t denotes the duration of the intervention. In this paper, we study the effect of
one-shot intervention, one of the simplest implementation schemes, where the intervention is implemented only once. The mathematical methods employed in this
study can be applied to more complex cases, for example, where multiple interventions are implemented intermittently. If the fraction of susceptible individuals
remains large enough and the herd immunity is not achieved after the intervention,
a second wave occurs. It is thus necessary to consider this second wave to evaluate
the effect of the intervention.
The one-shot intervention setting has been numerically studied by Bootsma and
Ferguson [26], showing that the final size, which depends on the timing ton and
toff , can be smaller for weaker intervention with larger R0,on . Di Lauro et al. [28]
numerically studied the dependence of the final size and the peak fraction of infected
individuals on the timing of the intervention, where the intervention was assumed
to start when the fraction of infected and recovered individuals exceeds a threshold
value. In particular, they concluded that the onset timing should be chosen so
that the two peaks during and after the intervention are comparable. Morris et
al. [29] showed that the maximum fraction of infected individuals with one-shot
interventions can approach that achieved by the optimal intervention, which requires
an unrealistic intervention, such as R0,on = 0. Sadeghi et al. [30] also suggested the
existence of the optimal timing of the intervention based on discussion using a
linearized equation and numerical simulation.

Analysis
Equations (1) and (2) were numerically integrated using ODEPACK [31], which
consists of nine Fortran solvers for the initial value problem for ODE systems. The
time step was set to 0.001. The nonintervention transmission rate and the recovery
rate are fixed as βoff = 2/7 days−1 and γ = 1/7 day−1 , that is, R0,off = 2. The
initial condition s(0) = 1 − ǫ, i(0) = ǫ, and r(0) = 0, where ǫ = 0.001 is employed in
this study. As discussed in detail below, the system behaves qualitatively differently
for different values of R0,on . Here, we primarily focus on the cases for R0,on = 1.4
(Fig. 1) and R0,on = 0.7 (Fig. 2), corresponding to relatively weaker and stronger

Fujiwara et al.

Page 5 of 28

intervention intensities, respectively. Note that R0,on > 1 in the former case implies
that the infection may spread even in the presence of the intervention. The time
series without the intervention is shown in Figs. 1(A) and 2(A). They are identical, because R0,on does not affect the dynamics without the intervention. Figures
1(B)–(E) and 2(B)–(E) show the time series with an intervention with a constant intervention duration ∆t = 60 days. The second wave can occur if the herd immunity
is not achieved when the intervention ends (Figs. 1(C) and 2(B), (C)).

and γ = 1/7 days−1 . (A) Time series of the fraction of infected and removed individuals, i(t) in
blue and r(t) in orange, without the intervention. Time series with the intervention with

intervention is implemented for ton ≤ t ≤ toff = ton + ∆t and are represented by grey intervals in
these panels. Conditions for the peaks of the fraction of infected individuals are given by
s(t) = 1/R0,off , when the intervention is not implemented, and by s(t) = 1/R0,on during
intervention. The final size of the outbreak for each case is represented by r(∞). Panels (F) and
(G) represent the maximum fraction of infected individuals imax normalized by that without the
intervention i0max , plotted in terms of r(ton ) and ∆r = r(toff ) − r(ton ), and ton and ∆t,
respectively. Symbols (A)-(E) in panels (F) and (G) denote the intervention timings of the time
series of the corresponding panels in (A)-(E). Symbols (i)-(iv) in panel (F) denote the timing that
the maximum infected fraction is observed, as described in the main text. The boundaries between
regions shown in panel (F) are obtained analytically. See the main text for the details.

Maximum fraction of infected individuals
In addition to the numerically obtained time series, we analytically show that peaks
of the fraction of infected individuals can appear at the following four timings by
applying Eq. (4): after the intervention, during the intervention, at the onset of the
intervention, and before the intervention. Note that there can be two peaks of the
fraction of infected individuals if a second wave occurs. In such a case, the peak
with a larger fraction gives the global maximum. Let us describe the four cases with
respect to the timing of the maximum in detail.

Figure 2 Strong intervention with small R0,on = 0.7 < 1. Parameters are βoff = 2/7 days−1 and
γ = 1/7 days−1 . (A) Time series of the fraction of infected and removed individuals, i(t) in blue
and r(t) in orange, without intervention. Note that this time series is identical to that presented
in Fig. 1(A). Time series with intervention with βon = 0.7/7 days−1 and the intervention
duration ∆t = 60 days with onset times (B) ton = 12 days, (C) ton = 30.2 days, (D) ton = 42.7
days, and (E) ton = 61 days. The intervention is implemented for ton ≤ t ≤ toff = ton + ∆t and
are represented by the grey intervals. Symbols (i), (ii), and (iv) in panel (F) denote the times at
which the maximum infected fraction is observed. Region (ii) is not observed in this case.
Notations of other symbols are the same as those in Fig. 1.

• (i) The maximum appears after the intervention (Figs. 1(B), (C), 2(B), and
(C)). If the intervention ends before achieving herd immunity, a peak is observed during the second wave after the intervention. The fraction of infected
individuals for this peak gives the global maximum if it is higher than the
first peak before or during the intervention.
• (ii) The maximum appears during the intervention (Fig. 1(D)). If the effective
reproduction number Rt declines and crosses unity during the intervention,
there is a peak in this timing. The condition R0,on > 1 is necessary for the
existence of this peak, because the effective reproduction number has to be
larger than unity at the onset of the intervention. Therefore, this peak does
not appear for R0,on < 1. This peak is the global maximum if it is larger than
the second peak. The peak also appears at this timing in Fig. 1(C), but the
second peak is slightly higher than this peak.
• (iii) The maximum appears at the onset of the intervention at t = ton
(Fig. 2(D)). If Rton < 1 holds when the intervention starts, the fraction of
infected individuals decreases during the intervention, and we observe a local
peak at t = ton . There may be another peak if herd immunity is not achieved
during the intervention. If the fraction of infected individuals at the second
peak is less than at this peak, the timing of the global maximum is given at
ton . Note that this region also appears for R0,on > 1, although the time series
is not shown in Figs. 1(B)–(E).

Fujiwara et al.

• (iv) The maximum appears before the onset of the intervention (Figs. 1(E)
and 2(E)). The fraction of infected individuals reaches its maximum before the
intervention. This case implies that the intervention starts too late and fails to
mitigate outbreaks in terms of the maximum fraction of infected individuals.
The fraction of infected individuals at the peaks can be calculated analytically.
Conditions for the peaks are given in terms of the fraction of susceptible individuals
as s(t) = 1/R0,off = γ/βoff without the intervention and s(t) = 1/R0,on = γ/βon
with the intervention. The maximum fraction of infected individuals for cases (ii),
(iii), and (iv) does not depend on the fraction of removed individuals at the offset
of the intervention r(toff ), because these peaks appear before toff . For case (i), the
maximum fraction of infected individuals imax is given as

which depends on ∆r := r(toff ) − r(ton ), the difference in the fraction of removed
individuals between the onset and offset of the intervention. See Supplementary
Section 2, Additional File 1 for the explicit form of imax for all cases and its derivation.
The boundaries between regions (i) and (ii), (i) and (iii), (ii) and (iii), and (iii)
and (iv) can be obtained analytically with respect to r(ton ) and ∆r (Figs. 1(F)
and 2(F)). On the boundaries, the fraction of infected individuals at two peaks is
comparable (Figs. 1(C) and 2(C)). See Supplementary Section 3, Additional File 1
for details of the derivation.
Final size with intervention
The final size also reflects the effect of the intervention. The final size of removed
individuals r(∞) with the intervention is obtained by solving the equation
r(∞)

(6)

in a self-consistent manner [32]. Specifically, as r(∞) appears on both sides, this
equation can be solved numerically or using the Lambert W function, except for
some special cases. This equation implies that the final size depends on ∆r =
r(toff ) − r(ton ). Another important implication of this equation is that r(toff ) has
the upper bound r̃ depending on r(ton ), which is given by
r̃(r(ton ))

Using this equality, one can show that the final size in the presence of the intervention is always smaller than that without the intervention. For

one can achieve r(∞) ≈ 1 − 1/R0,off by setting ton properly, which is the smallest
prevalence to achieve herd immunity, with an intervention duration ∆t that is large
enough [32]. See Supplementary Section 5, Additional File 1 for details of the derivation. Numerical results regarding the final size are summarized in Supplementary
Section 6, Additional File 1.

Results
We report the numerical and analytical results, when the reproduction number under the intervention R0,on is large (Fig. 1) and small (Fig. 2), showing qualitatively
different behaviors.
In Figs. 1(F), (G), 2(F), and (G), the dependence of the maximum fraction of
infected individuals on the timing of the intervention is plotted. Here, imax is normalized by that in the absence of the intervention i0max (Figs. 1(A) and 2(A)). As
the maximum infected fraction drops in the presence of the intervention, imax /i0max
is less than unity and quantifies the effectiveness of the intervention in terms of the
maximum fraction of infected individuals. As this ratio decreases, the intervention
shows more success in reducing the maximum fraction.
It is difficult to obtain the time series of the SIR model analytically without any
approximations, for example, linearization, or the method presented in [6]. Therefore, imax is numerically computed with different onset and offset times for the
intervention, ton and toff (Figs. 1(G) and 2(G)). However, imax can be analytically calculated with respect to the fraction of the recovered individuals at the
onset, r(ton ), and the offset, r(toff ), of the intervention (Figs. 1(F) and 2(F)). Note
that there exists a one-to-one correspondence between {ton , toff } (panels (F)) and
{r(ton ), r(toff )} (panels (G)) in Figs. 1 and 2.
Weak intervention (large R0,on = 1.4)
In this case, the reproduction number is larger than unity even in the presence of
the intervention. Therefore, the fraction of infected individuals may increase during
the intervention period. The peaks of infected individuals can be observed during
the intervention, and the maximum infected fraction can appear at any of the four
timings (i)–(iv) classified above. Figures 1(B)–(E) show that imax is minimized
in the intermediate onset time ton near (C), where the peaks during and after
the intervention are comparable. This non-monotonic dependence on ton is clearly
visualized in Fig. 1(G). The peak of infected individuals during the intervention
is smaller than that without intervention. This intervention mitigates the second
wave.
As shown in Eq. (5) and Fig. 1(F), the maximum fraction of infected individuals
is linear in ∆r if the peak of the second wave is the maximum, that is, case (i). This
is verified by the fact that the contours lie horizontally in case (i). To clarify this
point, the contours are explicitly shown in Supplementary Section 7, Additional File
1. If the fraction of the infected individuals reaches the maximum during or at the
onset of the intervention (cases (ii) and (iii), respectively), the maximum fraction
depends only on ton , which has one-to-one correspondence to r(ton ). This is verified
in Fig. 1(F), (G), and Supplementary Section 7, Additional File 1. If the maximum
appears before the intervention, that is, case (iv), the maximum is independent of
both ton and toff .

Fujiwara et al.

Onset and offset times for the intervention with constant ∆t corresponding to
Figs. 1(A)–(E) are plotted in Figs. 1(F) and (G). As suggested by the time series,
the maximum infected fraction is smallest in the intermediate intervention onset
ton , near (C). It is clear from panel (F) that this point is located close to the
boundary between cases (i) and (ii), where peaks during and after the intervention
are comparable. In case (ii), the maximum does not depend on ∆r, which implies
that a longer intervention does not reduce the maximum. Note that the relationship
between (ton , toff ) and (r(ton ), r(toff )) is non-monotonous.
Strong intervention (small R0,on = 0.7)
When the transmission rate is small during the intervention, the maximum infected fraction is minimized in the intermediate starting time of the intervention
ton , namely, early implementation of the intervention does not necessarily minimize
the infected fraction (Figs. 2(F), (G)). This result is intuitively understood as follows. If the intervention starts too early, the infection does not spread because of
the small intervention transmission rate. Therefore, the second wave after the intervention is large, thus the early intervention is not effective. If the timing of the
intervention is characterized in terms of r(ton ) and r(toff ) (Fig. 2(F)), the maximum
of the second wave depends only on ∆r. If the maximum fraction is found during
the intervention, its value is independent of toff and r(toff ). The peak does not appear during the intervention, that is, case (ii) does not appear because Rt,on < 1
holds.
Maximum infected fraction īmax versus reproduction number under the intervention
R0,on
For each R0,on , there exist onset and offset timings of the intervention that minimize
the maximum fraction of infected individuals imax (Figs. 1(F), (G) and 2(F), (G)).
Let this value be īmax (R0,on ). Figure 3 plots the dependence of īmax on R0,on . As
seen in the figure, it is minimized at a non-trivial intermediate value of R0,on =
∗
R0,on
≈ 1.23 > 1. This implies that the maximum fraction of infected individuals is
∗
minimized for a weak intervention under the one-shot condition. For R0,on ≥ R0,on
,
īmax is achieved at the boundary between regions (i) and (ii) at ton = 0, where the
∗
peaks during and after the intervention are comparable (Fig. 1(C)). For R0,on
≥
(1)

R0,on ≥ R0,on , the boundary between regions (i) and (ii) with ton > 0 gives īmax ,
(1)

where R0,on ≈ 1.08 is the parameter value below which region (ii) does not exist. For
(1)

strong intervention R0,on ≤ R0,on , īmax is found at the boundary between regions
(i) and (iii), where the peaks of the onset and after the intervention are comparable
(Fig. 2(C)), at ton > 0. Conditions for īmax are analytically derived in all cases,
(1)
shown by the solid line in Fig. 3. The conditions for īmax for R0,on ≥ R0,on can be
(1)

explicitly solved. The condition for small R0,on ≤ R0,on cannot be solved explicitly,
and the parametric equations for īmax and R0,on are used to plot the theoretical
curve in Fig. 3. See Supplementary Section 8, Additional File 1 for details of the
derivation.

Intervention strategies
It is possile to optimize the onset and offset timings of the NPI by minimizing an
objective function under certain constraints. In the present framework, this can be

formulated as an optimization problem in a hybrid nonlinear dynamical system. The
optimal intervention strategy depends on the objective function. Here, we discuss
the following two simple scenarios to minimize imax . In general, more complex objective functions can be used for optimization. The following discussion may provide
some intuition for considering such cases, taking into account the second wave.

Minimizing imax with a constraint in the intervention duration
Let us start with a case where the intervention duration ∆t is less than a certain
value. As imax is monotonically decreasing in ∆t for a fixed ton , we can assume
that ∆t is a constant, and ton is varied. This case has been studied in Figs. 1(B)–
(E) and 2(B)–(E). This scheme fixes the intervention duration, so it is easier to
anticipate the economic impact of the intervention, which depends on the duration
of the intervention, than in the next scenario based on the fraction of recovered
individuals.
As discussed above, imax is minimized in the intermediate onset time ton , when
the first peak during the intervention and the second peak after the intervention
are comparable. For larger R0,on , ton giving the minimum imax converges to zero
for large ∆t (Fig. 1(G)), but converges to non-zero for large ∆t for smaller R0,on
(Fig. 2(G)). These results are understood as follows: for a strong intervention with
small R0,on , the intervention immediately suppresses the fraction of infected individuals. Therefore, the early onset of the intervention prevents more individuals from
achieving immunity during the intervention and eventually increases the maximum
fraction of infected individuals.

Minimizing intervention duration with a constraint in imax
Another possible constraint is to minimize the intervention duration ∆t, keeping
the maximum fraction of infected individuals imax constant. This corresponds to
choosing ton along a contour of imax , which prevents the overcapacity of medical
support. In Figs. 1(G) and 2(G), ∆t is minimized for an intermediate ton . Namely,
a contour that crosses point (C) (∆t = 60) reaches ∆t ≈ 20 if the onset time is
later than ton = 19.2 (Fig. 1(C)). As we have already discussed, the maximum
fraction depends on ∆r in region (i). It takes a shorter time to achieve the same
∆r if the intervention starts later in this case. As the maximum fraction of infected
individuals depends on r(ton ) but is independent of ∆r in cases (ii) and (iii), the
optimal r(ton ) is determined by the boundary between regions (i) and (ii) or that
between (i) and (iii) in Figs. 1(F) and 2(F). Evidently this timing is an intermediate
value of ton > 0. It may be easier to set a plan for the intervention with respect to
r(ton ) and r(toff ), rather than the timing ton and toff .
Similar optimization problems can be considered using the final size as the objective functions. These problems are discussed in Supplementary Section 9, Additional
File 1.

Conclusion
In the present study, in consideration of the actual COVID-19 situation, we studied
the situation in which the reproduction number of an infectious disease is temporarily reduced by implementing an NPI once during the epidemic, using a simple
mathematical model. The results provide theoretical implications as to how strong
NPIs should be introduced during an epidemic of an emerging infectious disease. If
the effective reproduction number during the intervention is too small, the fraction
of infected individuals at the peak in the second wave may be higher than the first
peak. It was also shown numerically and analytically that the fraction of infected
individuals can also increase if the intervention is started too early. The upper limit
of medical capacity is an essential practical constraint. In particular, for infectious
diseases such as COVID-19, which is too emergent to expect effective treatments,
it is more important to avoid exhausting the medical system. This study suggests
that it will be necessary to be alert for a larger second wave that may occur after
strong intervention in such cases.
We analytically derived the peak fractions of infected individuals in the SIR model
with the one-shot intervention. These analytical results suggest that the peak fractions can be smaller with non-trivial intervention timings. The maximum fraction
is smallest for R0,on > 1, that is, the intervention reproduction number is not in
the disease-free regime. In the literature, Bootsma and Ferguson [26] showed that
the final size can be minimized for non-trivial intervention timing and R0,on numerically. Di Lauro et al. [28] numerically showed that the peak fraction of infected
individuals also depends on the timing of the intervention. We obtained analytical
expressions for these quantities in this study. The analytical results for the final size
are presented in Supplementary Section 6, Additional File 1. It should be noted that
the formulae for the peak fraction depend on the timing of the peak, resulting in
various cases compared with the final size. Some analytical results are available for
this system. Sadeghi et al. [30] explained these non-trivial effects based on solutions

Fujiwara et al.

of the linearized equation, which exponentially grows and decays without and with
the intervention, respectively. Linearization is one of the simplest approximations
and is applicable in this case; in particular, this approximation is useful in discussions regarding timing. Conversely, linearization cannot be used to discuss the
important case where R0,on > 1, as the linearized equation cannot explain the declining number of infected individuals. The proposed method in this study provides
a unified framework, including the cases where linearization is not feasible. Morris
et al. derived [29] an equation for the peaks of the fraction of infected individuals in terms of s(ton ), s(toff ), i(ton ), and i(toff ). In this work, we further show the
peak fractions in terms of the two parameters r(ton ) and r(toff ) for a general initial
condition.
Although concrete measures and guidelines for COVID-19 are required, it is emphasized again that the results in this study were derived using a simplified model
with many assumptions. First, the results presented in this study are based on the
simplified SIR model, which takes into account neither the realistic pathology of
COVID-19 nor societal response. This model assumes uniform and random contact within a group and does not consider interactions between different subgroups
in the population. Recovered patients are assumed to have complete immunity in
this model. These assumptions are not applicable to COVID-19, where there are
still many unclear factors regarding heterogeneity in contact networks and the immune response of patients after recovery. If a society develops other public health
measures during the intervention, the basic reproduction numbers before and after the NPI may be different. Next, this study is a one-shot intervention model,
in which the transmission coefficient returns to the original value after a single
intervention. Practically, each re-pandemic requires multiple intermittent interventions [33], making the intervention process much more complex [34]. Furthermore,
the model is based on a deterministic dynamical system of an isolated population.
Therefore, important NPI measures such as border control cannot be estimated in
the present framework. The deterministic nature of the model assumes that the infectious disease cannot be eradicated, as the number of infected individuals remains
non-zero for a finite time. If the population is small enough and no imported cases
are assumed, strong and early intervention, which is not necessarily recommended
in this study, may eradicate the disease, and a second wave does not occur. Strong
intervention would be necessary in other cases, for example, when the number of
infected patients approaches the capacity of the medical system. These complex
situations may be analyzed in detail by extending the methods presented in this
study, which may lead to different conclusions from those reached in this study.
In this study, the effect of NPIs was modeled as a hybrid dynamical system, which
may further enable us to approach more refined models in future investigations. The
influence of NPIs with respect to political decisions and behavioral changes of people
can be expressed more accurately by introducing a hybrid dynamical system. In
recent years, dynamical systems theory and control theory have been developed, and
phenomena specific to hybrid systems such as Zeno solutions and sliding motions
have been discussed [18–22]. Some studies, such as [35] and [36], have proposed
control of infectious diseases using sliding mode control. The optimal policy under
NPIs can be discussed by modeling the effect of economic damages associated with

Fujiwara et al.

execution and then minimizing the cost function. Discrete changes in parameters
such as the transmission coefficient in NPI implementation are strongly linked to
the intensity of measures, suppression of economic activity, and changes in human
mobility. For example, the correlation between the decrease in human mobility with
NPIs and the effective reproduction number for the COVID-19 pandemic has been
studied [37, 38]. Such studies can contribute to modeling the costs of NPIs. The
mathematical model of the epidemic suppression effect can be constructed using a
hybrid dynamical system, taking into account the negative socioeconomic impact
of NPIs.

Derivation
Here, we derive Eqs. (S17)–(S20). The conditions for the fraction of infected individuals to be the local peak are given by s(t) = γ/βoff = 1/R0,off without the
intervention and s(t) = γ/βon = 1/R0,on with the intervention.
First, let us apply Eq. (4) until the onset time of the intervention, with β = βoff ,
t1 = ton , and t0 = 0. Using the initial condition s(0) = 1 − ǫ, i(0) = ǫ, r(0) = 0, we

Substituting Eq. (S21) into Eq. (4), one can derive the fraction of susceptible and
removed individuals during and after the intervention.
(i) Maximum fraction after the intervention
We derive the fraction of infected individuals after the intervention. Let tafter

p
be the time at which the infected fraction reaches the peak after the intervention.
The relationship between s(toff ) and r(toff ) is derived by substituting Eq. (S21) with
ǫ → 0 into Eq. (4) with t0 = ton and t1 = toff as follows:

which is equivalent to Eq. (S17) with R0,off = βoff /γ and R0,on = βon /γ. Equation
(S26) gives imax if the maximum appears after the intervention. Note that the
fraction of infected individuals depends only on the onset and offset timings as
r(toff ) − r(ton ). The later the onset or sooner the offset is, the higher the peak is.
(ii) Maximum fraction during the intervention
If the effective reproduction number at the onset of the intervention is greater than
unity, βon s(ton )/γ > 1, and that at the offset is less than unity, βon s(toff )/γ <
1, then there is a peak during the intervention. Let tduring
be the time at which
p
during
the infected fraction reaches the peak, where ton < tp

relationship between susceptible and removed individuals during the intervention

S3 Method: Derivation of boundaries between regions of different
maxima
As shown in Figs. 1(F) and 2(F) in the main text, the timing giving the maximum fraction of infected individuals switches in the (r(ton ), ∆r) plane, where
∆r = r(toff ) − r(ton ). These figures suggest possible transitions between regions
(i) and (ii), between (i) and (iii), between (ii) and (iii), and between (iii) and (iv)
listed above. At the boundaries, the peaks of the different timings are expected to
be equal. Based on this idea, we sketch the derivations of the equations for the
boundaries between these timings.

S5 Appendix: Features of the final size equation
Let us study the features of Eq. (6). Note that we assume that R0,on is fixed in this
section.
First, we show that the final size monotonically decreases with respect to r(toff )
for a fixed r(ton ). Regareing Eq. (6) as an implicit function of r(∞) and ∆r, we
obtain

herd immunity condition. Therefore,

holds. As ∆r monotonically increases with respect to toff for a fixed ton , the final size
is smaller if the intervention is longer. Equivalently, r(∞) monotonically increases
with respect to r(toff ) for a fixed r(ton ).
Note that there exists the upper bound in r(toff ). Let this upper bound be
r̃(r(ton )). It satisfies Eq. (7) in the main text:

Finally, let us discuss r(ton ) and r(toff ) which minimizes the final size with fixed
R0,on . The monotonicity of r(∞) with respect to r(toff ) implies that the lower bound
of the final size r(∞) with fixed r(ton ) is obtained if r(toff ) is replaced with r̃(r(toff )).
Therefore, we focus on the final size equation in which r(toff ) is replaced with r̃,

Interestingly, this transcendental equation has the solution r(∞) = r̃ = 1 − R0,off
if R0,on < R0,off log (R0,off ) /(R0,off − 1) (Eq. (8) in the main text). In other words,
one can achieve herd immunity with the theoretically minimal removed fraction by
intervening once if the intervention reproduction number is sufficiently small.

S6 Appendix: Numerical results for the final size
Figures 1(B)–(E) and 2(B)–(E) in the main text present the numerical results of
the final size r(∞) by varying the intervention onset time ton with the constant
basic reproduction number without the intervention R0,off = 2 and intervention
duration ∆t = 60 days. As suggested theoretically in S5 Appendix, the final size
with the interventions (Figs. 1(B)–(E), 2(B)–(E) in the main text) is smaller than
that without the intervention (Fig. 1(A) and 2(A) in the main text).
The final size is minimized in intermediate ton in both cases (Figs. 1(D) and 2(D)
in the main text). This result is intuitively understood as follows. The second wave
occurs if the intervention onset is early (Figs. 1(B) and 2(B) in the main text).
Conversely, the removed fraction is sufficiently enough before the intervention and
the second wave is not observed if the onset is late (Figs. 1(E) and 2(E) in the main
text).
For sufficiently large ∆t and small enough R0,on , the final size reaches close to
1
= 0.5, which is the lower bound of the final size necessary to achieve herd
1 − R0,off
immunity, for r(ton ) ≈ 0.295 (Fig. 2(D) in the main text), which corresponds to

in Fig. 1 in the main text. The final size of the outbreak for each case is represented by r(∞),
which is normalized by that without the intervention, r 0 (∞). Left and right figures are plotted in
terms of r(ton ) and ∆r, and ton and ∆t, respectively. Symbols (A)-(E) in the figures denote the

ton = 42.681 days. It should be noted that a maximum of ∆r = r(toff ) − r(ton ) can
be found for the intermediate r(ton ) (Figs. S4 (left) and S5 (left)). Equation (6) in
the main text (Eq. (6)) suggests that a larger ∆r yields a smaller r(∞). Because r̃
is largest at intermediate ton , the final size is smallest at intermediate ton (see S5
Appendix).
As suggested by Eq. (6), the final size depends on ∆r but is independent of r(ton )
(Figs. S4(A), S6(B), S5(A), and S7(B)).
Weak intervention (large R0,on = 1.4)
The final size can be minimized with ton = 0, the early implementation of the intervention, in this case (Fig. S4). The timing of the intervention that minimizes the
final size is different from that which minimizes the maximum fraction of infected
individuals. In general, the optimal timing of the intervention depends on the objective function to be minimized. The theoretical prediction in Eq. (6) (Eq. (6)), that
the final size depends on ∆r, is numerically verified (Fig. S4(A)). For a constant
intervention duration ∆t (Fig. S4(B)), the final size is minimized with intermediate
ton (Fig. 1(D) in the main text).
Strong intervention (small R0,on = 0.7)
The simulation results (Fig. 2(B)–(E) in the main text) suggest that the final size
is minimized with an intermediate starting time for small R0,on . Indeed, as shown
in Fig. S5, the final size can be minimized at ton 6= 0. The minimized final size

in the main text. The final size of the outbreak for each case is represented by r(∞), which is
normalized by that without the intervention, r 0 (∞). Left and right figures are plotted using

appears during or at the onset of the intervention (cases (ii) and (iii)), imax depends
on r(ton ) and does not depend on ∆r. Therefore, the contours in the (r(ton ), ∆r)
plane are the horizontal and vertical lines for the former and latter cases, respectively. To visualize them explicitly, Figs. S6(A) and S7(A) plots the five contours
for imax . As a theoretical prediction, they consist of horizontal and vertical lines.
Equation (6) theoretically predicts that the final size r(∞) with the intervention
depends on ∆r only, which implies that the contours are horizontal lines (Figs. S6(B)
and S7(B)).

S8 Appendix: Dependence of īmax on R0,on
We want to minimize the maximum fraction of infected individuals īmax for a fixed
R0,on by varying ton and toff . Note that imax is decreasing function in ∆r (Eq. (S19))
for case (i), and imax does not depend on ∆r in regions (ii) and (iii). Therefore,
for a fixed r(ton ), īmax is achieved either in region (ii) or (iii). Here, īmax can be
analytically or semi-analytically calculated by evaluating imax on the boundaries
between (i) and (ii) or between (i) and (iii). We show below that the dependence of
īmax on R0,on changes, in which the boundary gives īmax , leading to its non-trivial
dependence on R0,on .
∗
Weak intervention (R0,on ≥ R0,on
≈ 1.23)
For large R0,on , īmax is achieved at the boundary between regions (i) and (ii), where
the peaks of the infected individuals during and after the intervention are equal
(Fig. 1(F) in the main text). To discuss the parameter regions where this boundary
exists, it is necessary to take into account the upper bound of removed individuals
r̃(r(ton )). If r(toff ) = r(ton ) + ∆r at the boundary between regions (i) and (ii) given
by Eq. (S41) is larger than r̃, this boundary is not observed at ton . In particular, it
∗
should be verified whether r̃(0) is less than ∆r in Eq. (S41) for r(ton ) = 0. Let R0,on
be the value of R0,on , below which the boundary between (i) and (ii) does not exist.

For R0,on ≤ R0,on

in r(ton ) for small r(ton ).
∗
For R0,on ≥ R0,on
, where there is a boundary between regions (i) and (ii) at
ton = 0 (Fig. 1(F) in the main text), ∆r can be the largest at this boundary at
ton = 0. Equation (S17) suggests that a larger ∆r yields a smaller imax , and īmax is
given by substituting r(ton ) = 0 into Eq. (S30) as follows:

If R0,on is smaller than R0,on
, region (ii) does not give the global maximum of
the fraction of infected individuals for ton = 0. As a result, a larger ∆r, which
indicates a smaller imax , is realized for ton 6= 0. The upper bound of r(toff ) at the
boundary between regions (i) and (ii) equals r̃(r(ton )). Substituting the condition
for the boundary between (i) and (ii) (Eq. (S41)) in the limit r(toff ) → r̃ into the

In this case, the boundary between regions (i) and (iii) satisfying r(toff ) = r̃(r(ton ))
gives the condition for īmax (Fig. 2(F) in the main text). This condition cannot be
solved explicitly with respect to īmax . Therefore, we give the parametric equations

Minimizing final size with a constraint in intervention duration
Targeting the final size to be minimized, we discuss two constraints based on Figs. S4
and S5. As in the case for the minimization problem of the maximum fraction of
infected individuals, the final size is minimized at an intermediate ton with the
constraint of a constant ∆t (Figs. 1(D) and 2(D) in the main text, and Figs. S4
(right) and S5 (right)). Note that this ton is different from the one which minimizes
imax . This result is intuitively understood in the right panels of these figures. The
contour of the final size depends on ∆r. For a constant intervention duration, ∆r is
largest with intermediate r(ton ), which maximizes the final size with this constraint.
Minimizing intervention duration with a constraint on the final size
It is possible to consider this rule to minimize the intervention duration along the
contour of the final size in Figs. S4 and S5. This corresponds to intervening while
keeping ∆r constant. There exists an intermediate ton that minimizes the final size
in this setting as well.
