ABSTRACT
Objective: To introduce a method for tracking results and utilization of Artificial
Intelligence (tru-AI) in radiology. By tracking both large-scale utilization and AI results
data, the tru-AI approach is designed to calculate surrogates for measuring important
disease-related observational quantities over time, such as the prevalence of intracranial
hemorrhage during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak.
Methods: To quantitatively investigate the clinical applicability of the tru-AI approach,
we analyzed service requests for automatically identifying intracranial hemorrhage (ICH)
on head CT using a commercial AI solution. This software is typically used for AI-based
prioritization of radiologists’ reading lists for reducing turnaround times in patients with
emergent clinical findings, such as ICH or pulmonary embolism. We analyzed data of
N=9,421 emergency-setting non-contrast head CT studies at a major US healthcare
system acquired from November 1, 2019 through June 2, 2020, and compared two
observation periods, namely (i) a pre-pandemic epoch from November 1, 2019 through
February 29, 2020, and (ii) a period during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, April 1–
30, 2020.
Results: Although daily CT scan counts were significantly lower during (40.1±7.9) than
before (44.4±7.6) the COVID-19 outbreak, we found that ICH was more likely to be
observed by AI during than before the COVID-19 outbreak (p<0.05), with approximately
one daily ICH+ case more than statistically expected.
Conclusion: Our results suggest that, by tracking both large-scale utilization and AI
results data in radiology, the tru-AI approach can contribute clinical value as a versatile
exploratory tool, aiming at a better understanding of pandemic-related effects on
healthcare.

Summary Sentence: We introduce large-scale tracking of results and utilization of
Artificial Intelligence (tru-AI) in radiology as a method for estimating important diseaserelated observational quantities, such as the prevalence of intracranial hemorrhage during
the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak.
BACKGROUND
Recent publications in this journal have summarized the impact of the coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19) on the practice of clinical radiology [1], including early-stage
radiology volume effects [2] and pathways for recovery towards normal radiology
business operations [3]. These studies have demonstrated the usefulness of temporal
tracking of radiology utilization data under unusual pandemic-induced conditions. Here,
we introduce an approach that does not only track such data from a viewpoint of
radiology services utilization, but creates an opportunity for gaining radiology-based
insights into pathologic clinical findings, such as for investigating the prevalence of
observed disease entities and specific disease-related complications.
Here, as a specific example, recent observations suggest that the coronavirus disease
2019 (COVID-19) based on SARS-CoV-2 infection may increase patients’ risk for
thromboembolic disease conditions in multiple organ systems, including pulmonary
embolism [4] and ischemic stroke [5]. However, the incidence of hemorrhagic
complications remains unclear. An early case report from March 2020 described a case of
COVID-19 related acute hemorrhagic necrotizing encephalopathy in one patient [6]. A
later study from June 2020 reported COVID-19 related brain MRI lesions in a small
cohort of 37 patients, where at least a subset appeared to exhibit a hemorrhagic
component [7]. As prospective clinical studies in defined patient populations are still
lacking, any clinical observational evidence suggesting a possible causative effect of
COVID-19 on the incidence of potentially life-threatening clinical conditions, such as
intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), is of paramount importance, because adequate treatment
decisions may have a significant effect on COVID-19 mortality.
To address this challenge, we introduce large-scale tracking of results and utilization of
Artificial Intelligence (tru-AI) in radiology as a method for estimating important diseaserelated observational quantities, such as the prevalence of intracranial hemorrhage during
the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. To demonstrate the clinical applicability of the tru-AI
approach, we specifically investigate pandemic-induced effects on clinical brain imaging
using AI-based analysis of emergency-setting non-contrast head computed tomography
(CT) scans at a major US healthcare system.
MATERIAL AND METHODS AND DATA ANALYSIS
We used numbers of patients derived from service request data for automatically
identifying ICH on emergency-setting non-contrast head CT scans using a commercial AI

solution (Aidoc, Tel Aviv, Israel) from a major US healthcare system as a surrogate for
the quantity of care that the hospital system provided to patients with possible ICH. This
software is typically used to perform AI-based prioritization of radiologists’ reading work
lists with the goal to expedite timely therapeutic interventions in critical clinical
conditions by reducing radiology study turnaround time in patients with emergent clinical
findings, such as ICH or pulmonary embolism, e.g. [9]. Imaging data is anonymized and
uploaded to a cloud-based inference machine in real time, and AI-based classification
results for the presence of ICH are returned to the requesting hospital, re-combined with
patient meta-data, along with transmission of heat maps that can serve as a diagnostic aid
to radiologists by guiding them to imaging locations suggestive of ICH.
Study Design and Definition of Observation Periods: We recorded data of N = 9,421
emergency-setting non-contrast head CT studies processed with Aidoc software acquired
from November 1, 2019 through June 2, 2020. The daily counts of unique patients who
underwent imaging were recorded during two observation periods, namely (i) a period of
121 consecutive days in an ostensibly pre-pandemic epoch from November 1, 2019
through February 29, 2020, and (ii) in a period of 30 consecutive days during the
COVID-19 pandemic outbreak from April 1, 2020 through April 30, 2020.
The definition of the latter observation period was motivated by two temporally framing
key events of the COVID-19 outbreak timeline in the State of New York, namely the first
reported fatality on March 14, 2020 and the beginning of Phase 1 of the 4-phase state reopening plan on May 15, 2020, which was based on specific metrics:
• 14-day decline in hospitalizations or under 15 new hospitalizations (3-day
average)
• 14-day decline in hospitalized deaths OR under 5 new (3-day average)
• New hospitalizations — under 2 per 100,000 residents (3-day rolling average)
• Share of total beds available (threshold of 30 percent)
• Share of ICU beds available (threshold of 30 percent)
• 30 per 1,000 residents tested monthly (7-day average of new tests per day)
• 30 contact tracers per 100,000 residents or to meet current infection rate.
We chose the COVID-19 outbreak observation period to be framed by these events with a
margin of approximately two weeks from either event, see Fig. 1. The total observation
period (November 1, 2019 through June 2, 2020) was chosen to reflect an extended time
period of stable AI image analysis operation without major technical or institutional
changes, such as major software updates or a changing number of connected CT
scanners. Note that these choices for defining tracking periods were made based on the
geographical location of the observed healthcare system ([Name of institution removed
for double-blind review.]), and that such choices would have to be adjusted according to
other local COVID-19 outbreak timelines, if the proposed tru-AI approach is to be used
for other geographical locations or even multi-center observational studies.
Statistical Analysis: We recorded the daily total number Nd of AI-analyzed CT cases and
the number M of daily CT cases with positive ICH findings as rated by AI image analysis

(ICH-AI+ cases) for each day within the above tracking periods. The distributions of Nd
and M for the two periods were checked for statistically significant differences using a
Mann-Whitney U-Test with significance level p<0.05. Also, the relation between AIbased ICH detection and observation during the two tracking periods defined above,
namely prior to and after the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, was investigated using a
chi-square test of independence with significance level p<0.05, see Table 1.

Figure 1: Time course of Intra-Cranial Hemorrhage (ICH) detection by AI image analysis on
emergent non-contrast head CT scans at [Name of institution removed for double-blind review]
using the proposed tracking of results and utilization of AI (tru-AI) approach. Shown are centered
30-day moving averages of daily total numbers of AI-analyzed CT scans (blue curve) and
centered 30-day moving average ICH-AI+ ratio (orange curve). This ICH-AI+ ratio was higher
during the COVID-19 outbreak observation period when compared to a pre-pandemic baseline
observation period. ICH was more likely to be observed during the pandemic outbreak
observation period than during the pre-COVID-19 baseline observation period, as revealed by
statistical analysis, see text.

For graphical representation of the data in Fig. 1, we plotted the centered 30-day moving
average of the daily total CT numbers (blue curve) and the centered 30-day moving
average ICH-AI+ ratio (orange curve). The latter was defined as the ratio of the sum of
all detected ICH-AI+ cases during an observation period of 30 consecutive days, divided
by the sum of total daily scan numbers Nd during that 30-day observation period. Note

that the values outside the pre-COVID-19 and the pandemic outbreak observation periods
are included in Fig. 1. These observation periods are only defined for the statistical tests
comparing these two observation periods, but not for the calculation of the centered
moving averages in Fig. 1. Also, note that using the centered 30-day average can only be
plotted 15 days after the beginning and before the end of the total observation period,
(Nov. 1, 2019 – June 2, 2020), which extends beyond the plot range of Fig. 1 for that
reason.

RESULTS
Daily Total Scan Numbers and Daily ICH-AI+ Case Numbers: Out of the N = 9,421
CT studies acquired during the total observation time (November 1, 2019 through June 2,
2020), a total of K = 6,579 head CT service request cases for AI-based ICH identification
were analyzed during the specified two pre-pandemic and pandemic outbreak tracking
periods, with 5,377 cases in the tracking period prior to, and 1,202 cases in the tracking
period during the COVID-19 outbreak, with slightly higher average daily numbers Nd of
44.4 ± 7.6 during the pre-COVID-19 period when compared to 40.1 ± 7.9 cases after the
COVID-19 outbreak, respectively. Interestingly, the total numbers M of detected daily
ICH-AI+ cases were lower before (7.3 ± 3.2) than during (7.8 ± 3.3) the outbreak,
reflecting a higher daily ICH-AI+ detection rate. Differences between distributions for
daily scan numbers Nd before and after the outbreak were statistically significant
(p<0.05), but not for numbers M of daily ICH-AI+ cases.
Differences of AI-based ICH Detection Between Observation Periods: A chi-square
test of independence was performed to examine the relation between AI-based ICH
detection and observation during one of the two tracking periods defined above, namely

prior to and after the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, see Table 1. The relation between
these variables was significant, Χ ! 1, 𝑁 = 6,579 = 5.6, 𝑝 < 0.05. ICH on non-contrast
head CT scans was more likely to be observed during the pandemic outbreak observation
period than during the pre-COVID-19 baseline observation period. As can be concluded
from the data in Table 1, for the 30-day pandemic outbreak observation period, we
observed 28 more ICH+ cases than would be statistically expected, i.e., approximately
one additional ICH+ case per day.
DISCUSSION
Recent work has pointed towards the potential usefulness of automated imaging software
utilization data tracking for analyzing COVID-19 pandemic effects in a different disease
condition, namely ischemic stroke, where a drop in software utilization has been
observed during the pandemic outbreak [8], and a potential risk in care for patients with
ischemic stroke has been hypothesized. In contrast to that approach, we propose a
combination of both the analysis of software utilization and automated tracking of AIbased image analysis results for a condition presumably related to COVID-19, namely
ICH.
Our quantitative analysis based on data from a major US healthcare system revealed that
the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, on one hand, resulted in a statistically significant
reduction of emergency-setting non-contrast head CT studies for excluding ICH. On the
other hand, this trend was counterbalanced by a higher ICH-AI+ ratio observed during
the outbreak. Our results are clinically significant as they suggest that the COVID-19
outbreak increased the number of actually observed ICH cases in emergency-setting noncontrast head CT studies above the statistically expected number of ICH cases. Note that
it would not have been possible to make this observation by tracking software utilization
data only, nor by tracking of total numbers of detected ICH+ cases, but only by tracking
both large-scale utilization and AI results data based on the proposed tru-AI approach.
There are several possible explanations for our findings. Our results may reflect an actual
increase of ICH prevalence in the observed cohort. Alternatively, we may have observed
pandemic-related changes in clinical care patterns. For example, ordering providers may
have changed their CT requisition approach by streamlining patient management based
on a more conservative head CT indication towards only those patients with higher
presumed clinical probability of ICH. Finally, we may have observed effects of an
elevated ICH prevalence based on an increased usage of anticoagulation therapy,
potentially motivated by first publications on the effect of COVID-19 on thromboembolic
events, such as deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in COVID-19 patients.
Such early publications appeared during our COVID-19 outbreak observation period and
may have influenced therapeutic patient management in COVID-19 patients, e.g. [3, 11,
12].
All these possible explanations would be highly relevant with important implications for

Pre-publication version of Axel Wismüller and Larry Stockmaster, Tracking Results and
Utilization of Artificial Intelligence (tru-AI) in Radiology: Early-Stage COVID-19 Pandemic
Observations. Page 7 of 9

	  
improving clinical patient management related to the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak.
Hence, additional research opportunities encompass a thorough detailed manual
retrospective clinical review of all observed cases, including non-imaging information
retrieved from electronic medical health records; Also, large future multi-site tru-AI
studies will provide opportunities for analyzing geographic variability of pandemicinduced medical conditions, such as ICH.
Limitations
Our study has limitations, which signify traits for important additional future research
efforts. We used a surrogate for the amount of head CT imaging provided and for
estimating the prevalence of ICH, where the indication for CT scanning and the detected
ICH cases may not reflect care and observed ICH prevalence at hospitals in other US
geographic regions. Specifically, the choices for defining pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19
outbreak observation periods were made based on the geographical location of the
observed healthcare system ([Name of institution removed for double-blind review.]).
These choices would have to be adjusted according to other local COVID-19 outbreak
timelines, if the proposed tru-AI approach was to be used for other geographical locations
or even multi-center observational studies.
Also, the diagnostic accuracy of the surrogate for ICH prevalence in the examined cohort
critically depends on the quality of ICH detection using AI-based image analysis.
Previous publications using manual analysis of non-contrast head CT cases reported
sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy values of 95.0%, 96.7%, and 96.4%, respectively,
for a study of 620 cases [9] and 95.1%, 98.7%, and 97.8%, respectively, for a study of
7,112 cases [10]. Although this prior work may suggest high diagnostic accuracy, AIbased ICH detection will certainly not be perfect, and a manual review of all observed
cases as a desirable, yet cumbersome gold standard, may reveal some differences from
the results obtained by our analysis. Despite these obvious limitations of our study, by
tracking both large-scale utilization and AI results data, we expect the tru-AI approach to
contribute clinical value as a versatile exploratory tool, which may support radiologists,
hospitals, regulatory bodies, and professional societies in their efforts to gain a better
understanding of pandemic-related effects on healthcare.
TAKE-HOME POINTS
•

We introduce a method for tracking results and utilization of Artificial
Intelligence (tru-AI) in radiology. By tracking large-scale data on both utilization
and results of AI-based image analysis, the tru-AI approach can estimate
important disease-related observational quantities over time, such as the
prevalence of emergent clinical conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic
outbreak.

•

To quantitatively investigate the clinical applicability of the tru-AI approach, we

Pre-publication version of Axel Wismüller and Larry Stockmaster, Tracking Results and
Utilization of Artificial Intelligence (tru-AI) in Radiology: Early-Stage COVID-19 Pandemic

tracked utilization and AI-based image analysis results for automatically detecting
intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) on 9,421 head CT studies acquired at a major US
healthcare system before and during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak.
•

The total number of daily non-contrast head CT scans was significantly lower
during than before the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. Yet, intracranial
hemorrhage was more likely to be observed by AI-based image analysis during
the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak observation period than during a pre-COVID19 baseline observation period.

•

This difference was statistically significant: During the COVID-19 pandemic
outbreak, we observed more ICH+ cases than would be statistically expected,
with approximately one additional ICH+ case per day.

•

The comparison of both utilization and AI-derived disease prevalence data can
provide valuable insights and define important research challenges for further
evaluating clinical effects of COVID-19 on healthcare systems.
