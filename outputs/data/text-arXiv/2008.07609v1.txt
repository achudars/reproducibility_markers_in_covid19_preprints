Surveillance of COVID-19 Pandemic using Hidden Markov Model
Abstract
COVID-19 pandemic has brought the whole world to a stand-still over the last few months. In
particular the pace at which pandemic has spread has taken everybody off-guard. The
Governments across the world have responded by imposing lock-downs, stopping/restricting
travel and mandating social distancing. On the positive side there is wide availability of
information on active cases, recoveries and deaths collected daily across regions. However, what
has been particularly challenging is to track the spread of the disease by asymptomatic carriers
termed as super-spreaders. In this paper we look at applying Hidden Markov Model to get a better
assessment of extent of spread. The outcome of such analysis can be useful to Governments to
design the required interventions/responses in a calibrated manner. The data we have chosen to
analyze pertains to Indian scenario
Keywords: Pandemic, Surveillance, Hidden Markov Model, COVID-19

1. Introduction
COVID-19 is the name given by WHO to the disease caused by SARS Cov-2 virus. Whereas the
death rates of earlier SARS virus were higher than Cov-2 virus, as a pandemic COVID-19 has
spread far more speedily infecting Lakhs of people.
Over the last few decades and centuries there has been incidence of Pandemics and losses of human
lives on large scale from time to time. However, the terminology around Pandemic can be
confusing. An endemic is something that happens to a particular people or region. For example,
Malaria is endemic to certain countries. An outbreak is a greater-than-anticipated increase in the
number of endemic cases. It can also be a single case in a new area. Thus, an outbreak can happen
in regions where a given disease is endemic or in totally new regions. If it’s not quickly controlled,
an outbreak can become an epidemic. An epidemic is often localized to a region, but the number
of those infected in that region is significantly higher than normal. When an epidemic spread
world-wide due to travel or other reasons it is termed pandemic. It is the geographic spread that is
vital to spread of pandemic [1].
Naturally the first response to arrest COVID-19 spread should have been ban of travel from and
to regions where the disease was endemic. However due to complex factors which played out that
did not happen in a timely manner and the pandemic has been spreading since early January when
it was publicly acknowledged world-wide. On top of that people travelling in from only certain
countries were screened while infection had already spread to lot more countries. The travellers
who did not display symptoms were asked to be in isolation and those who displayed symptoms
were quarantined. This again did not happen to the degree that was needed.
Once an outbreak happens in a new region, expected response was to arrest further spread to more
people. This however could only be done retroactively by tracing contacts a newly detected person
may have encountered and testing them. The Governments had limited capacity to test and they

needed to manage them judiciously. This resulted in continued spread of the disease in a latent
manner. The COVID-19 spread from person to person via droplets that got dispersed when a
person was coughing, sneezing or even talking. It was also suspected that the virus spread through
surfaces and on certain surfaces the virus lasted for couple of days or more. Many of these
conclusions were based on simulation studies and not necessarily attested from field studies.
In addition to pervasive mode of spreading another challenge with COVID-19 is that many
infected people do not display any symptoms for long periods. Table 1 below compares COVID19 with other viruses [2]. You can see that COVID-19 has the longest incubation period during
which virus can be contagious i.e. even before the symptoms start. A person will continue to be
contagious with onset of symptoms and may be for some more time even after recovery.
It was also seen that those with pre-existing health problems were more vulnerable. On an average
the disease impacted the elderly lot more. In the case of any new virus, medical communities take
a few months in the least to come up with a vaccine that can build immunity among people. Further,
vaccines are of no use to people already sick. To treat them suitable antiviral drugs are needed
which can shorten the time people are unwell. They may need to be taken early on and may not
work in every case. There has been vocal community of experts urging Governments to test, test
and test. But considering the size of populations involved and the scale of effort required it has
proved impractical. At the same time, it is worthwhile to test only in regions and among
communities where there is a possible outbreak. Inviting people to common testing facilities can
itself expose them to chance of infection. Even though there has been debates about herd immunity
by allowing the virus to spread among healthier people, making such calls has been rather highly
risky. Finally, it is not health experts but the politicians and Governments who have to take
responsibility for their actions. General information on COVID-19 is presented in a lucid manner
by Robert Roy Britt [3].

Thus, when Science is found to be wanting, we should turn to Mathematics for solutions. In this
paper we propose application of Hidden Markov Model to assess the spread of infection in
communities by making use of publicly available data on active cases, recoveries and deaths. We
make use of data published by Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India.
Currently India as of early May 2020, is possibly able to flatten the curve but yet to see a dip in
infections [4]. The situation can change unpredictably as more people are allowed to travel back
to India or across India.
We hope that this work can help Governments calibrate interventions/responses using a relatively
simple model. We also outline strategies for building more complex models to deliver fine-grained
analysis.
The remaining part of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2, covers Literature Survey where
we cover literature on surveillance of past pandemics followed by literature related to COVID-19.
Section 3 covers the Proposed Methodology for COVID-19 Pandemic Surveillance using Hidden
Markov Model. Section 4 presents Results on application of the proposed methodology to Indian
context. In Section 5, we make a list of Recommendations for better surveillance of COVID-19
Pandemic in India. Section 6 concludes the paper.

2. Literature Survey
The three pandemics in the twentieth century killed between 50 and 100 million people and the
2009 H1N1 “Swine Flu” exposed vulnerabilities that we still have to influenza epidemics. David
Hutton [5] has done a review of Operations Research Tools and Techniques Used for Influenza
Pandemic Planning. He covers instances where Simulation modelling is used in as a way of
representing the real world and being able to estimate the impact of interventions and to improve
their performance.

Among the simulation models, system dynamics approach can capture how the changing level of
infection and immunity in the population affects the spread of future infections in the population.
System dynamics modelling techniques have been applied to pandemic influenza preparedness
problems as varied as social distancing, vaccination, antiviral treatment, and portfolio analysis of
interventions. Larsen [6] showed with his simple model that the people with high rates of contact
drove the initial growth of the epidemic and that targeting social distancing (reducing contact rates)
to the correct subpopulations with high contact rates can prevent the epidemic with limited
disruption to the remaining population. Nigmatulina and Larson [7] built off that simple dynamic
compartmental model of influenza to include multiple interconnected communities. Each
community has citizens that interact with each other and is connected to other communities by a
few travellers each day. This might represent towns near each other. They used this model to
compare the impact of vaccination and travel restrictions. They also find that travel restrictions
will not be effective: only a complete 100 % travel restriction would stop or significantly slow
transmission between communities. The above analysis [7] and the one by Larson alone [6] use
very simple models that can be implemented in spreadsheets, but they provide very powerful
policy insights. System Dynamics models also have been used to evaluate antiviral use [8] as well
as vaccine delivery mechanisms [9] and optimal allocation of health-care resources. Discrete event
simulations are used to manage distribution systems. Agent based models have been used where
more elaborate data is available to decide on policy choices such as who should be vaccinated first
[10]. Vaccine selection problem can be formulated as optimization problem when one has to
choose between releasing an available vaccine or waiting for better vaccine. Along the same lines,
Hutton refers to cases where decision analysis, game theory and supply chain analysis are used to
manage health-care resources.
Rath et al. [11] made use of Hidden Markov Model for automated detection of Influenza epidemic.
He builds on Serfling’s method that is commonly used for Influenza Surveillance. The method
uses cyclic regression (to address cyclical data owing to seasonality of epidemics) to model the
weekly proportion of deaths from pneumonia and influenza and to define an epidemic threshold
that is adjusted for seasonal effects. That approach however suffers from several shortcomings,
such as the need for non-epidemic data to model the baseline distribution, and the fact that
observations are treated as independent and identically distributed. This can be handled by
modeling the data as time series and use Hidden Markov Model to segment it as non-epidemic and
epidemic phases. Rath et al. in their paper have used exponential distribution for non-epidemic
phase and gaussian distribution for epidemic phase. This is a refinement over the work done by Le
Strat & Carrat [12] who made use of only Gaussian Distributions.

2.1

Literature related to COVID-19 Pandemic

COVID-19 Pandemic has been an active area of research last few months. There have also been
large number of articles in main-stream, social media and as part of professional health-care
literature. Here we cover literature related to testing procedures and pharmaceutical interventions,
non-pharmaceutical interventions followed by mathematical analysis of forecasts globally and in
India. Finally, we look at aspects related to surveillance and social implications.

Nandini Sethuraman et al. [13] emphasize on importance of timing to get the correct results in
Real Time Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) Tests that are used to
detect SARS-COV-2 RNA as illustrated in figure below. Thus, there is a very real possibility that
a sizable number of COVID-19 cases are not detected on testing.

Figure 1: Estimated Variation Over Time in Diagnostic Tests for Detection of SARS-CoV-2
Infection rrelative to Symptom Onset [13]
As shown in Figure 1 above, the negative results do not preclude SARS-CoV-2 infection. On top
of this, administering RT-PCR tests for the identification of SARS-Cov-2 RNA is complex and
needs specifically trained man-power [14]. The SARS-CoV-2 RNA is generally detectable in
respiratory specimens during the acute phase of infection. Positive results need to be clinically
correlated with patient history and other diagnostic information, after ruling out bacterial infection
or co-infection with other viruses. According to Wikramaratna et al. [15], RT-PCR tests are highly
specific and the probability of false positives is low but false negatives can also occur if the sample
contains insufficient quantities of the virus to be successfully amplified and detected. Xu et al.
[16] propose alternative diagnosis via CT scans in combination with deep learning techniques to
address relatively low positive rate of RT-PCR Tests in the early stage to determine COVID-19.
There is similar work which makes use of X-Rays and CNN [17]. Feng Shi et al. [18] made use of
random forest algorithms along with CT-Scans. They claim detection of RT-PCR Tests is only 3060 percent, requiring repeated tests. As far as other pharmaceutical interventions go, there is work
that recommends antibody-based therapies [19] and discovery of potential drugs using deep
learning methods [20]. There were studies on effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine and
azithromycin, which concluded that for serious patients they did not affect mortality outcomes
[21]. More studies may be needed here. K. Kang et al. [22] talk about repurposing existing drugs
by making use of AI to predict drug-target interactions. W, Zhang P [23] have studied herd

immunity and vaccination game. They inform that herd immunity can be achieved by voluntary,
private vaccination. As of now, research is yet to establish long-term post-infection immunity from
COVID-19 [24].
Ferguson et al. [25] from Imperial College London classified possible Non-Pharmaceutic
Interventions to tackle COVID-19 under mitigation with focus on slowing the epidemic spread
and suppression with objective of reversing the epidemic growth. Whereas mitigation included
detection, isolation and quarantine of suspect cases, suppression required lock-down of large
regions save for bare essentials. They concluded that mitigation is unlikely to be a viable option
without overwhelming healthcare systems, suppression is likely necessary in countries able to
implement the intensive controls required. Some authors [26] suggested strategies to come out of
lock-downs by combining Green Zones and allowing movements in disconnected zones. There
has been flurry of response by Mobile App developers to tackle issues related to surveillance with
privacy, health and well-being in the context of COVID-19[27]. Yanfang Ye et al. [28] worked on
risk assessment of communities by looking at combination of disease-related, demographic,
mobility and social media data. There is also research work[29] on monitoring COVID-19 social
distancing using person detection.
Kathakali Biswas and Parongama Sen [30] analyzed the space-time dependence of novel Corona
Virus outbreak using SIR model and data from China. Their research showed inverse-square law
dependence of number of cases against distance from the epicenter. Kathakali Biswas et al. [31]
also predicted exponential growth of cases based on SIR model. Their model could also predict
how long the disease may last. However. research by Anna L Ziff and Robert M Ziff [32] pointed
to exponential growth in death-rates followed by power-law behavior when epidemic peaks and
only then exponential decline in death rates. Tim K Tsang et al. [33] did a study on how changing
case definitions impacted analysis of disease spread in China, leading to overestimation of basic
reproductive numbers. Some studies [34] concluded even after the lockdown of Wuhan on January
23, 2020, the number of patients with serious COVID-19 cases continued to rise, exceeding local
hospitalization and ICU capacities for at least a month. Fotios Petropoulos et al. [35] conclude
that not only the COVID-19 numbers will grow but also uncertainty about forecasts will also grow.
PLOS Editors [36] are vocal in decrying uncertainty in predicting the manifestation of virus in
different countries and difficulties in reconciling potentially contradictory data and advice from
models and researchers in managing conflicting political, economic and health priorities. Vivek
Verma et al. [37] made use of time-to-death periods/lethal periods to predict the morality rates.
Vishwesha Guttal [38] in their paper covered risk assessment via layered mobile tracing. Eksin et
al. [39] have made modifications to standard SIR/SEIR epidemiological models to account for
social distancing to arrive at more realistic predictions.
Some countries have been more successful than others in surveillance of the pandemic. Rapid
identification and isolation of cases, quarantine of close contacts, and active monitoring of other
contacts have been effective in suppressing expansion of the outbreak in Singapore [40]. South
Korea as widely reported in the press, was successful in containing the disease by using anti-body
testing. In India however anti-body test setups imported from China failed to work reliably. The
paper [41] covered the details of French Surveillance system and early experience with COVID-

19. Kissler et al. [42] have analyzed the potential transmission dynamics through the pandemic
period and beyond. They expect the disease to be around at least till 2025 may be with a break.
There are many studies that predicted the growth of COVID-19 cases in India. The very first wellknown study [43] was published on ICMR web-site where the focus was on how to handle
imported infections. They made use of a variant of SEIR model. Rashmi Pant et al. [44] did a study
on cases in Telangana. Dudala et al. [45] applied exponential model for COVID-19 disease
progression. Sourish Das [46] applied exponential method derived by SIR model as well as
statistical learning model. He estimated that, with lock-down in place, India should in the least get
as many cases as in China. He made a study of Basic Reproduction Numbers prevailing in different
states in India at the time of his study. The R0’ ranged between 2 to 4 for states with national
average of 2.75. He particularly called out Punjab for high R0. The Hindu [47] reported that
another group of scientists advocated staggered release of lock-downs in India. Tarnjot Kaur et al.
[48] emphasized on the importance of paying heed to early warning signals. They projected the
number of cases in India to go to 135,000. Ashish Menon et al. [49] studied the cases in India and
made use of complex models that increased the number of compartments to many more compared
to basic SIR model. They projected huge numbers where deaths are in hundreds of thousands using
an overly deterministic model. One of the research opportunities is to make use of social network
models, community structures and inherent stochasticity that may temper the overly alarmist
projections for COVID-19. Zhaoyang Zhang et al.[50] propose ISIR(Improved SIR) model for
epidemics that models spreading of epidemics on Social Contact Networks. This work however
pre-dates COVID-19 outbreak.
Many researchers were particularly anguished that COVID-19 accentuated prevailing inequalities
further. They [51] make a case that the pandemic presents an opportunity for achieving greater
equity in the health care of all vulnerable populations. Similar issues prevail in India where lockdowns are much harder on daily wagers and migrant labourers. This again makes a case for
nuanced approaches to tackle epidemics than wholesale lock-downs.

3. Proposed Methodology
Hidden Markov Model has great promise in the surveillance of COVID-19 pandemic. This is
because certain transitions happening in the progression of virus in the larger society have an
association with time series data on confirmed/active cases, recoveries and deaths reported from
Hospitals.
A generic Hidden Markov model is illustrated in Figure 2, where the Xi represent the hidden state
sequence. The Markov process which is hidden behind the dashed line is determined by the current
state and state-transition probability matrix A. We are only able to observe the Oi, which are related
to the (hidden) states of the Markov process by the observation probability matrix B. Both the
matrices A and B are row-stochastic as well as π which contains initial probabilities of hidden
states. A, B and π together constitute the Hidden Markov Model.

Figure 2: Hidden Markov Model
We propose to make use of Hidden Markov Model to perform surveillance of COVID-19 spread.
In our model, with each region we associate a state. Thus, we define 4 hidden states which should
model majority of situations namely Healthy, Infected, Symptomatic and Detected. In addition,
we define 2 additional states that may seldom get used namely Catastrophe-1 and Catastrophe-2.
Table 2 below describes the hidden states.

Infected

Infected people are at different points in incubation I
phase of 2-14 period. General awareness is low and
degree of complacency prevails about the disease due to

Symptomatic

This is the state of a region when a region is clearly in S
epidemic phase and patients come to know about their
disease after onset of symptoms, typically in later part
of incubation phase.

Detected

This is the state of a region when region is in epidemic D
phase and patients come to know about their disease
before the onset of symptoms during early part of
incubation phase.

Catastrophe-1

The dynamics of spread suddenly alters due to large C1
number of outward migrations of infected people.

6

Catastrophe-2

The dynamics of spread suddenly alters due to large C2
number of deaths may be due to health sector capacity
issues.

The above states are aptly considered hidden as in the absence of exhaustive, expensive and
repeated testing it is hard to know what state a given region is in at a given point in time.

Daily reportage on COVID-19 cases in India is published by the Ministry of Health and Family
Welfare, Government of India on their website [52]. India related data is also available in greater
detail on Kaggle Platform [53]. For our work, we make use of the former, as it is adequate and
convenient. On each day, the public health authorities report aggregate information on confirmed
cases, active cases, deaths and recoveries. If we consider each new reportage as an observed
symbol comprising of any of
O = {Active(A), Recovered(R), Dead(D), Inactive(A-)}.

We consider that State/Union Territory goes through the following hidden states:
S = {Healthy(H), Infected(I), Symptomatic(S), Detected(D)}.
We track 31 States/Union Territories.
This scenario where only Observation Sequences are known, possible state values and possible
observations are known lends itself to be modeled as a learning problem. In Learning Problem,
given some training observation sequence V and general structure of HMM (number of hidden
and visible states), we need to determine HMM parameters M = (A, B, π) that best fit the training
data where A is state-transition probability matrix, B is visible symbol probability matrix and π is
probability distribution of hidden states at the initial stage.
For the COVID-19 Surveillance scenario, we propose the following alternative solution
approach to learning problem instead of standard Baum-Welch forward-backward EM algorithm.
1. Choose a vector of observation sequences catering to different region. Each region on a given
day can generate a, d, r and a- symbols in different numbers that account for change of observed
states of patients on a given day.
2. Based on the visible symbols generated above we infer state symbols for that day as follows.

3. For each region and each day generate the π, the probability distribution of hidden states at that
period.
4. For each day and for each hidden state value compute the visible symbol distribution matrix
and compute/update visible symbol probability distribution matrix.
5. Compare the state inferred for the previous day and current day for different regions and
populate the state-transition distribution matrix. Update the State Transition Probability matrix
with incremental state transitions for every day. This starts getting updated from day 2.
6. Iterate between step 1 to 4 till symbols are exhausted.
Thus, at the end of steps 1 to 6, we have a Hidden Markov Model comprising of A, B and π. The
model can then be used for Evaluation Problem and Decoding Problem. The state distributions
arrived using this model on a given day can be used by Governments to design interventions in a

calibrated manner. We can further refine the model by using numeric values for probability for B
from the model in step 2 and arrive at more refined values of A.

4. Results
We made use of the data on COVID-19 published on daily basis by the Ministry of Health and
Family Welfare [52], Government of India to train the HMM. The approach we chose was to
make reasonable assumptions about mapping between data reported by Hospitals and state of
infection in regions as shown in Table 4. Then by making use of inferred states we derive state
transitions. We followed this approach for data between 29th April and May 8th, which is detailed
in Tables 7A and 7B. Then based on the derived state transitions we arrive at State Transition
Matrix(A). The computation of which is described in Table 8. Now based on our knowledge of
States inferred, we compute the observation probability Matrix B as shown in Table 9. Thus, based
on Analysis of data between April 29th and May 8th we have a refined Model parameter B with
quantitative values compared to qualitative inferences we started with. We also have learnt the
HMM parameter A i.e State Transition Matrix. Now the model learnt is described in Table 10. To
enable regional analysis, we provide Table 11 that lists the States/UTs based on their Hidden States
and Table 12 that reports hidden state sequences for last one week for each of the states and UTs.
We have chosen to use the model in Table 10 only for prospective data (and not retrospectively).
We believe this is an appropriate decision as we are primarily looking at sequential data
Figure 3 illustrates state transitions and Figure 4 depicts corresponding mapping between
observations and inferred states. Figure 5 shows the distribution of inferred states. In all these cases
we have used our initial approach for data between April 29th and May 8th and then use the learnt
model for data between May 9th to 20th
The approach we recommend is to recompute and refine the HMM every two weeks and apply for
the prospective data.
We made use of the refined Model as of May 20th for the period May 21 to 25 and data as of June
10th. The Hidden State Sequences region-wise along with active cases all the way to June 10, 2020
are shown in Table 14.
Figures 6 to Figure 9 illustrate hidden state transition probabilities of states(regions) of concern
compared to similar states(regions). Here we assume that the transition sequence leads us towards
normalization and hence benign.
Healthy(H)->Infected(I)->Symptomatic(S)->Detected(D)->Healthy(H)
These transitions are represented clock-wise and with solid-lines. The transitions in opposite
sequence are considered as matter of concern and they are represented using dashed-lines and/or
in anti-clockwise manner. Transition back to the same state is considered benign in case of Healthy
States as well as Detected States. The latter ensures timely detection of pandemic spread.
Transition back to the same state is considered a matter of concern in case of Symptomatic as well
as Infected states. As earlier benign transitions are marked using solid lines and others using dashd
lines.

Further after a gap of a month we reviewed the data on COVID-19 spread in India on July 11th and
arrived at the hidden states with June 10th as the base date. The status of states as on July 11th is
given in Table 15. Then again, we assessed the incremental spread on July 12th relative to data on
the 11th and the inferred hidden states of different states and union territories are given in Table
16.

5. Recommendations
In this section we analyse the results we have obtained in order to make policy/process
recommendations. We can make the following observations regarding COVID-19 Pandemic
Surveillance in India. It is to be noted that because of inter-state movements of migrants there was
some impact on the COVID-19 scenario where certain states may have reported surge in the
number of cases due to influx of migrants. Here Figure 5, Table 11 and Table 12 illustrate the data
as of May 20th and Figure 6-9 illustrate the data as of June 10th
1. As shown in Figure 5, the number of healthy states has remained around the same and new
infections seem to be still breaking out. On the positive side there seems to be steady reduction
in the symptomatic states and increase in the number of detected states. This means there is
early detection of the cases to greater degree than earlier.
2. Table 11 which shows data as on May 20th, indicates that there are Healthy States such as
Punjab and Andhra Pradesh while they continue to have high cases in Hospital they are moving
towards normalcy. Then we have Infected states such as Assam, Goa and Karnataka which
have relatively smaller number of cases in the Hospital but continue to have fresh infections.
Then we have Symptomatic States namely Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Telangana and Bihar that
continue to report new cases. Then we have nine other states such as West Bengal which have
made improvement as far as detection of cases is concerned.
3. Table 12, which gives the hidden state sequence for last one week gives greater clarity. Here
Uttar Pradesh is predominantly in Detected State, once in a while moving to Symptomatic
and Infected. Andhra Pradesh and Punjab are indeed moving towards normalcy. Only some
UTs and smaller states are able to maintain the Healthy State. Rest of the states continue to be
in flux as far as coming to normalcy is concerned. They still need to do work in controlling
new infections. Here Gujarat which has seen highest mortalities is consistently showing
Detected state. This indicates more work is required on Pharmaceutical side to take care of
possibly more vulnerable patients due to comorbidities. The same can be said about West
Bengal. On the other hand, Maharashtra which has very large number of cases showing
Symptomatic State to greater measure, indicating more work required to detect cases early. In
many other states, situation is yet to stabilize.
4. Figure 6 compares Uttara Pradesh with 4,365 active cases and Maharashtra with 44,860 active
cases. Here we can clearly see that in case of Maharashtra, 91 percent of transitions are from
symptomatic state back to itself with no transition to healthy or infected state whatsoever. This
indicates huge localized spread which may be due to cases in Mumbai with exceptionally high
population density. In case of Uttar Pradesh which is most populous state in India 57 percent
of the time Healthy state reverts back to itself. This however needs to be balanced with the
observation that symptomatic state also returns back to itself. On the positive side there are

transitions between all the states giving an indication that situation may normalize sooner than
later.
Figure 7 compares state of Delhi with neighbouring state of Haryana. Delhi has 18,453 cases
and Haryana has 3,030. One can see that there continue to be outbreak of infections in Delhi
whereas Haryana never goes to infected state. Delhi in 73 percent of the cases goes back to
symptomatic state. There are direct transitions between infected and detected states, indicating
availability of adequate testing infrastructure. Delhi also stays 60 percent of the time in
Detected state further reinforcing the same observation. Overall while things continue to be of
concern in Delhi, they most probably will normalize much sooner than Maharashtra provided
new outbreaks of infection are prevented. In case of Haryana we can broadly say that 40
percent of the cases it is in healthy state and 60 percent of the cases it is in symptomatic state.
Here the focus should be on active cases and how to get them cured fast.
Figure 8 compares Gujarat and West Bengal which had high death rates compared to other
regions. As of June 10th, Gujarat had 5,336 active cases and West Bengal had 4,959 active
cases. In case of Gujarat there is no transition to infected state indicating success in separation
of infected zones from other zones. In case of West Bengal there continued be transitions to
infected zones. This may call for more action to enforce social distancing and containment. In
other respects, both the states seem to behave similarly.
Figure 9 compares state of Tamil Nadu with 16282 active cases with the neighbouring state of
Karnataka which has 3,251. Both states have similar population sizes and densities. Tamil
Nadu has no transition back into Healthy State whereas Karnataka is in Healthy State 57
percent of time. Karnataka has no activity in Infected State whereas Tamil Nadu has. In other
respects, profile of Tamil Nadu represents that of Delhi, which is discussed earlier. One reason
Karnataka to did better is the seriousness with which they administered lock-down as well as
the way they involved Medical Experts [54].
Table 15 represents inferred states as of July 11th using the data as of June 10th as the base.
Thus, these states may be considered to represent long term trend. Within a month around 25
out of 31 states are in detected state, reflecting that there is much greater proportion of cases
are detected early. Thus, greater focus is required on improving the health-care infrastructure
than restrictions such as lock-downs. Five states are showing up as infected. Among them
Karnataka has announced[55] that in couple of districts in and around Bengaluru they will be
imposing a lock-down between July 14th and 22nd. Only one state is showing up as healthy
indicating the continued challenges country as a whole face. Overall, we can say situation on
the ground corroborates with our findings.
Table 16 represents the inferred states reflecting incremental spread of epidemic on July 12th
relative to day before. This shows 4 states including Delhi under healthy category, indicating
that these states are moving towards normalcy. Among others, 5 states are showing up as
infected, 8 symptomatic and 14 detected, thereby calling for appropriate day-to-day tactical
interventions.

In summary, we make the following recommendations.
•

States/UTs/zones which predominantly maintain Healthy State, should strictly regulate
migrations in and out of the region.

•

•
•

For States/UTs/zones which show off and on, infected status, focus should be on those who
may potentially get infected. These may be health workers or people who typically interact
with large number of people or move around a lot.
For States/UTs/zones which maintain symptomatic status, the focus should be on nonpharmaceutical interventions such as social distance and containment.
State/UTs which maintain detected status yet may have high mortality the focus should
be on pharmaceutical interventions and on improving the health infrastructure.

6. Conclusions
The main issue unique to COVID-19 spread is that the infected may remain asymptomatic between
2 to 14 days i.e. through the incubation period. During that period, they may be unknowingly
spreading the disease. Some detections may also get missed if tests return false negatives. We
have proposed an approach that takes as input data reported from Hospitals in regard to active
cases, recoveries and deaths and infers the latent state of regions as far as spread of COVID-19 is
concerned. To that end we categorized regions as healthy, infected, symptomatic and detected
(before onset of symptoms). We modeled the state of regions as hidden states and reportage from
Hospitals as observations. We proposed a simpler approach to tackle the HMM learning problem
in lieu of Baum Welch EM algorithm. We have also provided a set of recommendations to better
manage the surveillance of COVID-19. We believe our approach can help Governments have a
better assessment of spread of epidemic in different regions and enable them to plan appropriate
interventions/responses.

Summary Points
•
•
•

This paper has made use of Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to assess the state of spread
COVID-19 Pandemic in regions based on reportage from hospitals.
The HMM states are categorized as Healthy, Infected, Symptomatic and Detected.
Policy recommendations suggested for each of the above states can be calibrated further
by Governments. The model can be continually refined to handle prospective and future
data. Domain Experts can contribute towards validating/refining the underlying
assumptions in this research.
