Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged authorities at different levels of government
administration around the globe. When faced with diseases of this severity, it is useful
for the authorities to have prediction tools to estimate in advance the impact on the
health system and the human, material, and economic resources that will be necessary.
In this paper, we construct an extended Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered model
that incorporates the social structure of Mar del Plata, the 4º most inhabited city in
Argentina and head of the Municipality of General Pueyrredón. Moreover, we consider
detailed partitions of infected individuals according to the illness severity, as well as data
of local health resources, to bring these predictions closer to the local reality. Tuning the
1

corresponding epidemic parameters for COVID-19, we study an alternating quarantine
strategy, in which a part of the population can circulate without restrictions at any time,
while the rest is equally divided into two groups and goes on successive periods of normal
activity and lockdown, each one with a duration of τ days. Besides, we implement a
random testing strategy over the population. We found that τ = 7 is a good choice for
the quarantine strategy since it matches with the weekly cycle as it reduces the infected
population. Focusing on the health system, projecting from the situation as of September 30,
we foresee a difficulty to avoid saturation of ICU, given the extremely low levels of mobility
that would be required. In the worst case, our model estimates that four thousand deaths
would occur, of which 30% could be avoided with proper medical attention. Nonetheless,
we found that aggressive testing would allow an increase in the percentage of people that
can circulate without restrictions, being the equipment required to deal with the additional
critical patients relatively low.

Introduction

In March 2020 the World Heath Organization (WHO) officially announced the COVID-19
(disease caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus) as a pandemic. The world was about
to witness one of the most devastating pandemics in last decades. In December 2019, a
cluster of a novel pneumonia-like illness was identified in Wuhan (China) and, without the
proper control measures, in 3 months the disease rapidly spread all over the world. The
first stages of the propagation occurred in different countries of Europe, leading to countless
human life losses and a severe economic crisis.
On March 3, the first COVID-19 patient was confirmed in Buenos Aires, Argentina. It
was an imported case, a 43-year-old man who had arrived from Milan, Italy. Following
international protocols and recommendations of local experts, educational centers of all levels
2

were closed, massive shows were suspended and international frontiers were closed. Decisively,
on March 19 and in order to restrict the spread of the new coronavirus, the national
government announced a 12 days nationwide lockdown for all citizens in the country [1].
These measures were extended progressively until nowadays with certain relaxations. Until
the middle of September, the total number of confirmed cases surpassed 750 thousand and
the number of fatalities was around 17 thousand, most of them concentrated in the Capital
Federal (CABA) and the suburbs, which form the urban conglomerate denoted by AMBA,
inhabited by 37% of the total population in Argentina.
Researchers have put a lot of effort in the study of multiple aspects of COVID-19
pandemic in several countries [2–6], at country level and at big regions with a high
concentration of people [7]. For instance, Romero et al [8] simulated an agent-based model
for COVID-19 in Argentina. The authors analyzed the evolution of four different pandemic
scenarios, with different levels of restriction in population mobility, and they found that
social isolation is the measure that has more impact in the spread of the virus. In the same
way, in [9], researchers found that early school closures effectively helped in reducing the
mortality rate in Argentina, Italy and South Korea. For its part, Torrente et al [10] showed
the psychological impacts of the pandemic and early measures implemented, in the form
of substantial anxious and depressive symptoms. Moreover, Quirós et al [11] conducted a
seroprevalence study in one of the largest slums in CABA and found, three months after
the first reported case, a prevalence of 53.4%. Mobility was also analyzed in Buenos Aires
City, as a proxy for effectiveness of lockdown measures. For instance, in [12], researchers
found a delay of 8 days between changes in mobility and reported cases, while deaths follow
cases from 16 to 19 days after.
Beyond the measures imposed by the government at a national level, each city has the
autonomy of taking different actions against the disease. Crucial factors such as hospital

3

capacity, demographic structure, and economic activities, among others, strongly vary
between cities. Therefore, local authorities must adapt national guidelines to their own
region and determine proper criteria in the decision-making process. For this reason, our
study is focused in Mar del Plata (MDP), the main city of the Municipality of General
Pueyrredón in Argentina. With this work we aim to provide a key study that will help
local governments in decision-making and implementation of mitigation strategies, as well
as estimating the medical resources required to face the consequences of such decisions.
The social and demographic structure of the population is generally reflected in heterogeneous contact patterns among individuals, where age is one of the main determinants
of these mixing patterns. For instance, children tend to spend more time with children
and members of their household; active adults mix with individuals in their workplace;
and so forth. For this reason, a disease transmission route may have mixing patterns
among individuals of different age [13]. To account for this contact structure, we use
census collected data given by national agencies [14]. We divided the population into age
groups and compute different contact matrices associated to different settings -household,
workplace, school and general community [15, 16].
Once we obtained the Mar del Plata network structure, we consider an extension of
the compartmental Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) model [17] -known as
SEIRD- to estimate the evolution of an epidemic. Here, D takes into account the individuals
that died as a consequence of the disease. Also, we differentiate between symptomatic
and asymptomatic infected individuals, considering different levels of illness severity for
symptomatic patients. As in the real-life scenario, some individuals may not require medical
attention at all (mild) and only will have to stay for a certain time at home, while others
(severe) will require hospitalization [18].
Even though the scientific community all over the world is working relentlessly in the

4

development of a vaccine, it will take several months to be applied to the majority of the
population, therefore, for now, non-pharmaceutical interventions are necessary to prevent
the spread of the virus [19–21]. Conversely, measures such as long lasting quarantines
also carry serious psychological and economic consequences, that must be considered.
Thus, assessing the severity of SARS-CoV-2 and the study of social-distance mitigation
strategies are crucial. Related to this topic, Meidan et al [22] proposed a novel alternating
quarantine strategy (AQ). In this strategy the population is separate into two groups, in
which they alternate successively between quarantine and regular activity in a bi-weekly
cycle. They found that this measure can be useful as a primary mitigation strategy, with a
comparable impact to that of a strict population-wide quarantine. Nevertheless, the weekly
relief allowing people an outlet to continue their activity for half of the time may, itself,
increase cooperation levels. Indeed, while a complete lock-down is extremely stressful for
the individual, the alternating bi-weekly quarantine routine relaxes the burden, and may
encourage compliance.
In this research, we propose a different quarantine scenario with time-windows relaxation
of activities -such as opening and closing activities by groups- and we are particularly
interested in studying the impact of the implementation of tests. In a different manner from
previous studies, in our model we use additional states to describe in more realistic way
the hospitalized cases, inasmuch as we are especially interested in estimating the medical
resources that should be allocated to sick patients. It is important to note that, even though
we chose MDP and calibrated the model for COVID-19, our study can be adapted to any
region or country where demographic information is available, and for diseases transmitted
similarly by contact.

Model

2.1

Compartments

In this work, we use an extension of the SEIR model to study the spread of COVID-19 in
MDP. In this model individuals can be assigned to four different compartments, depending
on their health status. Susceptible (S) individuals are healthy and prone to be infected,
becoming exposed (E) when this occurs. At the E stage, individuals have not developed
symptoms yet and they are not contagious. With the onset of symptoms, exposed individuals
become infected (I) and can propagate the disease. Finally, recovered (R) individuals have
acquired immunity and no longer propagate the disease. One modification we make to this
model is the addition of a compartment of deceased (D) individuals, which are usually
not distinguished from the recovered individuals. Additionally, we include a compartment
of asymptomatic (A) individuals, taking into account the infected people who show no
symptoms but can still propagate the disease (several publications [23–27] have reported
the importance of asymptomatic individuals in the transmission of COVID-19).
As we are especially interested in estimating the medical resources that should be
allocated to sick individuals, we model their evolution by recognizing different levels of
illness severity. On the one hand, some cases develop a mild (M ) version of the disease.
Thus, according to the protocol applied in Argentina, they may not require medical care,
but must remain isolated at their homes or in isolation sites prepared for this purpose, until
they recover. On the other hand, some individuals develop more serious symptoms and are
hospitalized (H) for control. Finally, we divide the hospitalized patients into four categories,
based on the fact that the evolution of each type of patient has particular characteristic
times and requires different resources from the hospital:
1. H: those in general beds who will fully recover from the disease,

6

2. H ∗ : those in the intensive care units (ICU) who will fully recover from the disease,
3. H † : those in general beds who will die,
4. H †∗ : those in the ICU who will die.
Note that we use H when referring to all compartments of hospitalized individuals together,
as a set. For the different subgroups of H, i.e, the H’s, we use a dagger (†) as a notation to
mark the compartments that evolve to the compartment D of deceased individuals, while
an asterisk (∗) denotes the compartments of individuals that make use of intensive care
units (ICU).
In Fig 1 we show a flowchart of our model. At the beginning, most of the population
starts in the S compartment. With an effective rate dependent on β, susceptible individuals
evolve to the E compartment, because of the interaction with the infected population.
The exposed population becomes infected with rate α; a fraction  develops symptoms
and progresses to the I compartment, while the remaining goes to the asymptomatic
compartment A. We consider that symptomatic individuals do not immediately become
aware of their health state, thus, we include a rate ω for the progression of symptomatic
infected (I) individuals to the M and H compartments. After this, only a fraction ζ of I
individuals are hospitalized, while the remaining are isolated at home (M compartment).
These isolated individuals fully recover from the disease with rate γ m . On the right
side of the flow chart we have the four compartments of hospitalized patients, which are
differentiated with the presence of superscripts. The population going to these compartments
is determined by the values of the corresponding fractions θ, θ∗ , θ† and θ†∗ . On the other
hand, the exit of these compartments is done with different γ-rates, in case the patients
recover, or with different δ-rates, for fatal cases. Note that patients in the ICU who will
recover, i.e., members of the H ∗ compartment, first flow to the H compartment.

7

Fig 1. Flowchart of our epidemic model. We estimate the initial values of individuals
in each compartment by adjusting the curve of deaths in the municipality. The susceptible
population S evolves to the exposed compartment E with and effective rate dependent
on β because of the interaction with symptomatic and asymptomatic infected individuals,
I and A, respectively. The exposed population becomes infected with rate α; a fraction
 develops symptoms and progresses to the I compartment, while the remaining goes to
the asymptomatic compartment A. Symptomatic infected individuals pass to one of the
compartments among the M and H with a rate ω. On the right side of the flow chart we
have the four hospitalized compartments, which are differentiated with the presence of
superscripts. Finally, individuals can end up in one of the two final states, recovered (R) or
deceased (D). Note that the gray arrow from the A to the M compartment corresponds to
the testing strategy we explain in the Asymptomatic testing subsection.

8

The choice of multiple H compartments ensures that the fractions of patients who fully
recover from the disease and those who die are consistent with the values reported in the
literature. These fractions are only determined by θ, θ∗ , θ† , and θ†∗ , and not by the output
rates. A summary of the states and parameters can be found in S1 Table and S2 Table.

2.2

System of equations

In an effort to better represent the society we are studying, we will divide the population
into age groups and incorporate contact matrices [28] to our model. These matrices indicate
the mixing patterns between individuals of the population, i.e., the frequency with which
people of a certain age interact with each other, and with people from different age groups.
This enables us to estimate better the impact over the health system, and the medical
resources that will be required. For this matter, we use the census data collected by official
organizations [14] and the inferring method developed in [16] to compute the matrices
associated with different kinds of social settings: households, workplaces, schools, and
general community. For the sake of this work being self-contained, a summary of the
inference method can be found in S1 Calculation.
Each age group has its own set of equations describing the evolution of the disease
spread, which is indicated by the subscript i. Note that some parameters are age-dependent
while others are not, indicated by the presence or absence of this subscript. The evolution
of each group is given by:

case of free propagation without intervention.

2.3

Intervention strategy

In the absence of a vaccine that would prevent the disease from spreading widely, it is of
major importance that society implements different non-medical policies to prevent and
mitigate the damages that COVID-19 may cause. Being able to estimate the amount of
resources that will be needed, as the epidemic progresses, is a key aspect that authorities
should seek in order to implement appropriate policies. In this section, we present a
10

particular intervention strategy that could be helpful in accomplishing a rather controlled
progression of COVID-19 in any population, although we focus in MDP, for which we use
its census data.
The AQ (alternating quarantine) strategy consists in dividing the population into
different groups that face alternate periods of activity/isolation, in terms of socioeconomic
activities (education, work, recreation, transportation, etc.). There is one group that it
is permanently active (labeled as q0 ). The remaining population is separated into two
equal parts (q1 and q2 ), one that is active and in contact with the q0 group, and one that
implements a strict lockdown (these isolated individuals can not propagate the disease).
After an established period of time τ , q1 and q2 switch places. This parameter will be tuned
in order to find the best possible scenario for diminishing the spread of the disease.
For this strategy, we subdivide each compartment Si , Ei , Ii and Ai into three groups
q0 , q1 , and q2 (the labels represent also the fraction of the population in each group). Thus,
adapting Eq. (12) to the case of alternating quarantine, the force of infection for each group
must be rewritten as follows:

2.4

Population-wide testing

A very important tool when facing an epidemic outbreak is the diagnostic of sick people
[29]. Identifying infected individuals is crucial to attenuate the propagation, because it
allow authorities to isolate specific carriers of the disease. Particularly, the detection of
asymptomatic infected individuals (compartment A) is a difficult task to achieve, since these
individuals do not know they are ill and, therefore, do not seek for medical attention. It is
extremely important to find and isolate them as quickly as possible. For this reason, along
with the AQ strategy, we implement the testing of a part of the asymptomatic individuals,
which then flow, with rate rtest , to the compartment M of mild patients (see Fig 1). As it
is a test without contact tracing in the population, susceptible and exposed individuals will
also be randomly tested (which will be considered with a negative result and will remain
in their compartment). In the same way, symptomatic infected individuals could also be
found, who will be admitted to the hospital or isolated, as previously explained about the
evolution of this type of individuals. Mathematically, this means replacing in Eqs. (3),
(5)-(9) ω by ω 0 = ω + rtest . As it is an expensive strategy, we consider that it ceases to be
applied when the curve of infected individuals falls below its initial value.
We expect, however, additional measures to be implemented parallel to the AQ strategy
and the asymptomatic individuals seeking, to help and reinforce the mitigation capacity
of the society against the spread of COVID-19, such as the extended use of face masks,
keeping strict hygienic regulations at the workplace, physical distancing and reduction of
social gatherings.

12

2.5

ICU capacity

In general, local and national governments make public health decisions based on the
projected availability of medical resources, such as ICU capacity, in terms of beds, ventilators,
and the specialized workers which operate the equipment and treat the patients [30, 31].
The exponential growth of COVID-19 spread may cause a quickly depletion of resources
and the saturation of the health system. As a result, an important number of people may
not have access to appropriate treatments and could die. Therefore, we consider that a
statistical study that explores the evolution of the ICU resources from the health system
is of utmost importance. For this reason, we implement a finite number of ICU resources
and consider that, when the occupation reaches this limit, the health system is saturated,
meaning that new patients that require ICU immediately evolve to the compartment D
of deceased individuals, as long as the system remains saturated. We study particularly
the consequences of an overwhelmed health system by looking to the amount of avoidable
deaths.
Despite the fact that the local authorities have not reported an official number of available
ICU beds [32], we estimate that there are roughly 180 ICU beds in the municipality, and
approximately 60 of these beds are available to accommodate COVID-19 patients [33, 34].

Results and discussion

This section will study the effect of a massive testing and AQ strategies applied since
September 30, 2020. Note that before this date, the municipality had imposed a mandatory
lock-down [35] where many non-essential stores were closed. Fitting our model (see Eqs.
(1)-(11)) to the actual data from August 18 to September 30, we obtain that in this period,
the effective reproductive number was R0 = 1.5, and the effective rate of infection was

13

β = 3.45. To fit β, we integrate our differential equations for different values of β in the
interval [2.3, 8.0] (corresponding to R0 ∈ [1.0, 3.5]), and then, we choose the optimum value
that minimizes the square distance between the predicted number of accumulated deaths
and their reported values. Note that we integrate our equations without any strategy to
fit our model to the data. The value of R0 found is notably lower than the reproductive
number R0 ≈ 2.5 (βf ree = 5.6) that was estimated in previous works [36–38] for a free
propagation without any intervention. This result indicates that the municipality’s policies
were successful in slowing down the spread of the virus but they also caused a substantial
economic cost.
We first study the effect of the AQ on the epidemic spreading for different values of
τ and q0 , without implementing the testing strategy (rtest = 0). To this end, we solve
numerically Eqs. (1)-(11) and compute the cumulative number of infected individuals at the
final state (when I ≈ 0), and the height of the peak of active cases under the AQ routine.
In Fig 2, these two quantities are plotted as a function of the period τ , which ranges from
1 to 14 days. To easily compare the curves of different values of q0 , we applied a linear
transformation on the y-axis to show the y-coordinates in the interval [0, 1]. As can be
seen, the optimal value of τ is weakly dependent of the parameter q0 , with 9 days being
the optimum for the accumulated cases (Fig 2A) and 8 days for the peak of active cases
(Fig 2B). From here on, we use τ = 7 in our simulations as it is close to optimal, and in
this way, the AQ can be in phase with the standard week. Note that for the particular case
q0 = 1, the entire population is permanently active, i.e., the AQ strategy is not applied.
In the following, we will study the joint effect of the testing and AQ strategies on the
epidemic spreading and how they reduce the pressure on the health system. In Fig 3A we
show, a heat map of the peak value of symptomatic infected individuals (I) as a function of
the fraction of the permanently active population q0 and the test rate rtest . It can be seen

final state and (B) the height of the peak of active cases as a function of τ for different
values of the parameter q0 . The values were obtained by solving numerically Eqs. (1)-(11).
that there is a region where the peak coincides with the initial value of infected individuals,
implying that the curve of infected cases declines immediately after applying both strategies.
In contrast, for higher values of q0 and lower values of rtest , the peak of infected individuals
is up to 10 times higher than the initial condition I(t = 0) = I0 . This behavior is also
shown in Fig 3B, where we plot the time evolution of infected individuals for an increasing
value of rtest and q0 = 0.7. Recall that the testing strategy is only applied while the number
of infected individuals is greater than I0 , and hence, when I(t) < I0 , a second wave may
hit the municipality. However, for all explored values of rtest and q0 , we observed that the
second wave was either absent or its peak was very close to I0 . Moreover, for large values
of rtest , I(t) has a plateau and is slowly decreasing, suggesting that the system is close to
a critical point, i.e., the effective reproductive number is R0 ≈ 1. In the supplementary
material (see S1 Fig) we present additional results for the cumulative number of infected
individuals.
To further elucidate the effect of the epidemic spreading on the health system, we will
compute the minimum number of ICU beds (Bmin ) to prevent an overwhelmed healthcare
15

Fig 3. Evolution of infected individuals. In (A) we show a heat map of the height of
the peak of symptomatic infected individuals Imax in the plane q0 -rtest . The black lines
represent isolines and the cross marks serve as a reference for (B). Recall that I0 = I(t = 0).
In panel (B), we plot the time evolution of the number of such individuals, where each
curve corresponds to a different value of the test rate rtest , with q0 = 0.7 (these values are
marked by cross symbols in panel A). The lines were obtained by solving numerically Eqs.
(1)-(11), and the error bars were estimated from 40 stochastic simulations.
system. In order to estimate this magnitude we compute the time evolution of the number
of critical patients when there is no restriction on the number of ICU beds, as shown in
Fig 4A, for the same values of q0 and rtest previously used in 3B. Note that the height of
the peak of this curve indicates the value of Bmin that prevents ICU saturation. In Fig 4B
we plot a heat map of Bmin and we obtain, as expected, that the two proposed strategies
reduce the pressure on the health system, i.e., Bmin decreases for larger values of rtest and
smaller values of q0 . Note that the region to the left side of each isoline of Bmin (solid black
lines) corresponds to the values of q0 and rtest where the demand for ICU resources does not
exceed the supply Bmin . Remarkably, we observed that each line for Bmin < 100 becomes
vertical for a given value of q0 . Therefore, above this threshold and regardless of the testing
strategy level, the demand will overwhelm the ICU supply. In the supplementary material
(see S2 Fig), we include a heat map of the period of time in which the health system is

16

overwhelmed when the number of ICU beds is 60.
In addition, it is also relevant to estimate the total number of tests Ttest that the
municipality must purchase for a given value of rtest and q0 because this magnitude can
be used to assess the budgetary impact of a massive testing strategy. To estimate this
magnitude, we accumulate from our equations, the number of tests used per unit time
for 300 days since September 30. The results of this procedure are shown in Fig. 4B as
Ttest -isolines in the plane rtest -q0 (dashed blue lines). The intersection between the left
region of a Ttest -isoline and a Bmin -isoline indicates the values of q0 and rtest that meet
the budget and ICU capacity. Notably, for a given value of q0 , the total number of tests
saturates as the testing rate rtest increases, which is observed in the figure as a vertical
Ttest -isoline.
On the other hand, since the ICU bed capacity is a critical bottleneck for the health
care system, policymakers must know the total number of deaths Dtot if the ICU capacity
is not increased, and also how many deaths would be avoided if the hospitals ensured a
minimum number of ICU beds to prevent saturation. In Fig. 4C we show a heat map of
Dtot at the final state when the number of ICU beds is 60. In the range of explored values,
we observe that decreasing the fraction of permanently active individuals (q0 ) reduces Dtot
more significantly than a higher testing rate rtest . Furthermore, the massive testing strategy
has a meaningful effect on Dtot only when q0 > 0.7. Besides, we also include in the same
figure the isolines of the number of deaths avoided (dashed blue lines) in the scenario where
the authorities extend the ICU capacity to prevent an overwhelmed health care system. It
can be seen that for the case of a weak AQ strategy (high values of q0 ) the total number of
deaths due to the lack of ICU beds ranges from 250 to 1000 people which corresponds to
up to 30% of the total number of deaths.

Conclusion

In this paper we studied a mitigation strategy for COVID-19 spread in Mar del Plata, based
on an extended SEIR model, where detected cases are confined and do not propagate the
disease. It consists in an alternating quarantine where a portion of the population remains
always active, while the rest is divided in two groups and enters a cycle of activity and
isolation with period 2τ . We found that a time-window of τ = 7 days is the best alternative
as it reduces the peak of active and cumulative cases of detected symptomatic patients
(a fraction of which eventually die), while it fits with the usual weekly cycle, being easy
to implement. Furthermore, we add a testing strategy on the general population, until
the number of confirmed cases goes under the initial level. We focused on the pressure
over the health system and the death toll that an overwhelmed system may cause. We

18

found that, given the situation in Mar del Plata as of September 30, extremely low levels of
normal circulation would be necessary in order to avoid the saturation of the health system,
regardless of the testing rate. The number of ICU beds necessary to prevent saturation
increases with the fraction of the population that remains always active, but this number
can be shortened by means of an aggressive testing strategy. In the worst case scenario, we
estimate that thousands of people may die, but would not if correctly assisted. Therefore,
we consider that implementing an alternating quarantine strategy with high testing rates
and medium-to-low levels of free circulation is fundamental in order to change the trend
of COVID-19 spread in Mar del Plata. Authorities might have to balance testing and
equipment costs with mobility levels of the population, in order to arrive at a consistent
strategy that people is able to follow, thus, ensuring compliance and reducing the economic,
social and psychological effects that long and extended - or the lack of - quarantines produce.
Finally, we emphasize the usefulness of having a model that incorporates the characteristics of society in a specific city, as a tool for local authorities to make informed
decisions. This model can be calibrated to study any disease transmitted by direct contact
and adapted to other cities using the corresponding census data.

S1 Calculation. Inference of contact matrices. In order to compute the matrix of
an arbitrary setting ∆ we assume that, for an individual k of age group i who shares a
particular setting a(k) with other people, on a regular basis, the contact frequency within
this setting is homogeneous, i.e., the probability that k contacts an individual of age group
(k)
(k)
j is proportional to the number aj of these individuals. Therefore, if we denote by v∆
(k)

(k)

as the total number of people in a(k) , we can compute this probability as aj /(v∆ − 1).
Consequently, the frequency of contacts between individuals of age groups i and j, in all
settings of type ∆, is

where Ni is the total number of individuals of age group i in the entire population, and n∆
i
is the number of individuals of age group i with nonzero contacts in the setting ∆. Note
that the Kronecker delta (δij ) in the numerator avoids counting k as a self-contact. After
computing fij∆ , the contact matrix associated with setting ∆ is given by

Performing this calculation for households, workplaces, schools and the general community,
we obtain a final expression for the contact matrix by taking the weighted sum
X

Cij =
w∆ Cij
,
∆

where the weight ω ∆ represents the proportion of transmission events that take place in
setting ∆.
In Ref. [16], the authors consider four social settings: households, workplaces, schools,
and general community, and estimate the following weights based on empirical data for
influenza-like diseases:
whouse = 0.30,
wwork = 0.19,
wschool = 0.18,
wcomm = 0.33.

20

In our model with alternating quarantine strategy, we set that the active population
has the same weights as in Ref. [16], whereas for the quarantined population we set
wwork = wschool = 0, and reduce wcomm by a 93.5%. This percentage is based on a 7-day
average as of March 29 of Google’s mobility data for transit stations and retail & recreation
which corresponds to the early stage of the COVID outbreak when the country was in strict
quarantine. Thus, the normalized weights for the quarantined population are given by:
whouse = 0.98,
wwork = 0.0,
wschool = 0.0,
wcomm = 0.02.
Similarly, based on the mobility reported by Google as of August 14 (average of 7 days),
we use the following weights to fit the curve of accumulated deaths in General Pueyrredón
from August 18 to September 30 (prior to implementing the mitigation strategies):
whouse = 0.79,
wwork = 0.13,
wschool = 0.08,
wcomm = 0.02.

†: These works report the value of R0 in the stage of free propagation, from which we
calculate βf ree using the next generation matrix method [45].
‡: We subtract two days from the time of transition E → I reported in [37, 39, 40], since
in [41] the authors estimated that patients are infectious two days before showing symptoms.
Therefore, infectious patients also stay two additional days in the community, increasing
the time of transition I → M and I → H reported in [42].
¤: Health authorities in Argentina require mild patients to remain self-isolated at home,
and these cases are reported as recovered after 14 days since their first symptoms appeared.

S1 Fig. Effect of the alternating quarantine and the massive testing strategy
on the accumulated number of positive cases. In this figure we present in panel (A)
the time evolution of the accumulated number of positive cases, and in panel (B) we show
a heat map of these cases at the end of the epidemic in the plane rtest -q0 . The parameters
values used for the curves in (A) correspond to those marked by cross marks in (B). Here we
define a positive case as either a symptomatic patient or an asymptomatic patient who has
been detected by the massive testing strategy. In panel (A) we note that different values
of rtest have little effect on the curve for the first 30 days. Similarly, we obtain that for
t → ∞ and rtest > 0, the strategy has a negligible impact on the final number of positive
cases (see panels A and B). As a consequence, these results suggest that it is difficult to
assess the impact of such a strategy on the epidemic spreading in the short and long term
if the health authorities only report the accumulated number of positive cases, and hence,
alternative measures must be considered.

S2 Fig. Number of days with an overwhelmed health system. Heat map of the
number of days in which hospitals are overwhelmed in the plane rtest − q0 when the number
of ICU beds is 60. In the upper right region, this period increases because a higher testing
rate delays the extinction of the disease by several weeks, and a weak alternating quarantine
(q0 ≈ 1) leaves a large proportion of the population exposed to COVID-19.
