Abstract. Social distancing as one of the main non-pharmaceutical interventions can help slow down the spread
of diseases, like in the COVID-19 pandemic. Effective social distancing, unless enforced as drastic
lockdowns and mandatory cordon sanitaire, requires consistent strict collective adherence. However,
it remains unknown what the determinants for the resultant compliance of social distancing and
their impact on disease mitigation are. Here, we incorporate into the epidemiological process with
an evolutionary game theory model that governs the evolution of social distancing behavior. In our
model, we assume an individual acts in their best interest and their decisions are driven by adaptive
social learning of the real-time risk of infection in comparison with the cost of social distancing.
We find interesting oscillatory dynamics of social distancing accompanied with waves of infection.
Moreover, the oscillatory dynamics are dampened with a nontrivial dependence on model parameters
governing decision-makings and gradually cease when the cumulative infections exceed the herd
immunity. Compared to the scenario without social distancing, we quantify the degree to which social
distancing mitigates the epidemic and its dependence on individuals’ responsiveness and rationality
in their behavior changes. Our work offers new insights into leveraging human behavior in support
of pandemic response.

1. Introduction. Emerging novel zoonotic diseases, such as Zika [1], Ebola [2], and the
most recently COVID-19 [3], have imposed great threats to global health and humanity [4].
Some of these new diseases are caused by respiratory viruses and highly contagious through
proximity transmissions, and may turn into an unprecedented pandemic well before effective
treatments and vaccines have been developed and widely deployed. In this case, the world
may have to resort to non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI), such as face covering and
social distancing so as to mitigate disease impact before effective pharmaceutical interventions
become available. However, the ultimate effectiveness of NPI measures is highly contingent
on compliance and adherence, since NPI is usually not a one-off measure, but rather requires
repeated, consistent adherence in order to reduce potential transmission routes of contracting
the infection. From this perspective, human behavior plays an important role in impacting
the course of a pandemic outbreak as well as the health outcome.
In recent years, there has been growing interest in understanding social factors in epidemiology (see, for example, [5] for a brief review). In the field of behavioral epidemiology, of
particular interest is the use of disease-behavior interaction models for this purpose [6]. Prior
work has extensively used this framework to study how vaccine compliance can be influenced
by a wide range of factors [7, 8, 9], ranging from vaccine scares [10] to disease awareness [11].
The feedback loop between behavioral change and disease prevalence gives rise to a variety
of interesting, nontrivial dynamics [12, 13, 14, 15], e. g. the hysteresis effect [16]. Among

others, an important approach is combining evolutionary game theory with epidemiological
models [17, 7, 18]. Evolutionary game theory provides a general mathematical framework
for modeling behavioral changes in a population driven by both social influence and self interest. In the past decades, the approach of replicator dynamics has been commonly used
to model social learning/imitation process, and particularly the spread of behavior (‘social
contagion’), in a range of important real-world problems [19], from peer punishment [20] over
cooperation [21], altruistic punishment [22], honesty [23], trust [24] and moral behavior in
general [25] to antibiotic usage [26].
Unlike vaccination, social distancing effort of an individual requires repeated decisions
whether or not to comply by evaluating the necessity of doing so throughout the epidemic,
despite public health recommendations or even mandates [27]. The cost of social distancing
is not negligible, but rather has a huge impact on the economic status and well-being of
people [28]. Previous work has modeled social distancing as a differential game [29], that is,
individuals try to maximize their payoffs by adjusting their effort in social distancing (namely,
the level of exposure to potential transmission routes) by comparing the risk of contracting
the disease with the cost of social distancing. Their numerical results show that the collective
dynamics of social distancing would approach to a steady level (i. e. a Nash equilibrium with
constant effort for social distancing) without any oscillatory dynamics [29]. While this prior
study sheds useful insights for social distancing from the game theory perspective, it remains
largely unknown how the rationality and the responsiveness of individuals in reacting to an
epidemic would impact the compliance level of social distancing.
Social distancing is costly, yet if not optimized for timing and duration and intensity, it
would lead to wasted effort [30, 31]. Combined with real data, the impact of social distancing
can also be quantitatively assessed and optimized for past pandemics like influenza [32, 33].
Noteworthy, there have been efforts to predict and quantify the effectiveness of reactive distancing on the COVID-19 pandemic, in anticipation of multiple waves of infections in the
coming years [34, 35].
Aside from individual perspective, the optimization of disease control is often studied
using optimal control theory by assuming a central social planner aiming to minimize the cost
of disease outbreak [36, 37, 38, 39]. While these results are insightful from the perspective of
population optima [40] (that is, optimized policies are complied uniformly in the population),
it is challenging to attain these goals in practice due to compliance issues.
To shed light on driving factors of compliance levels of social distancing, here we take
into account important aspects of human decision-making – bounded rationality [41] and loss
aversion [42] – which is informed by the real-time disease prevalence, and prompted by peers’
choice. We incorporate into the epidemiological process with an evolutionary game dynamics of social distancing behavior. Individuals decide on whether or not to commit to social
distancing by weighing the risk of infection with the cost of social distancing. The responsiveness parameter in our model modulates the relative time scale of individuals revisiting their
social distancing decisions, as compared to the pace of an unfolding epidemic. We introduce
bounded rationality that individuals are not necessarily using the best response but rather
with some probability of changing their behavior.
In this work, we find an interesting oscillatory tragedy of the commons in the collective
dynamics of social distancing. Individuals are inclined to social distancing when the disease

prevalence is above a threshold that depends on the transmissibility of the disease and the
relative cost of social distancing versus contracting the disease. As the epidemic curve is being flattened, individuals consequently feel more safe not to practice social distancing, thereby
causing the decline in the compliance of social distancing and further resulting in a resurgence
of disease outbreaks in the population. Even though such reactive social distancing is hardly
able to help reach the optimality of disease mitigation, it can avoid the overshooting of infected individuals which typically happens in an susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model
in the absence of any interventions. We also find nontrivial dependence of the effectiveness
of social distancing, measured by the fraction of susceptible individuals who would become
infected without social distancing, on model parameters governing individuals’ rationality and
responsiveness.
2. Model and Methods.
2.1. Model. Our model is basically a combination of the classical SIR model with the
replicator equation: In a well-mixed infinite population each individual is either susceptible,
infected or recovered. Moreover, each susceptible individual can at each time choose to either
practice social distancing or not to practice social distancing. If the individual practices social
distancing they cannot become infected. If they do not practice social distancing they become
infected in an encounter with an infected with probability β > 0. At each time an infected
recovers with probability γ > 0.

Figure 1: Schematic of our model. In contrast to the SIR model, we divide the susceptible population
in those that practice social distancing (and cannot be infected) and those that do not practice social
distancing (and can be infected). The dynamics of the amount of people practicing social distancing
is given by a replicator equation. Here as well as in later figures, we refer to those practicing social
distancing as SD and those that do not as NSD.

We denote the proportion of susceptible individuals at time t by S(t), the proportion of
infected by I(t), and the proportion of removed by R(t). Furthermore, we denote by E(t) the
proportion of susceptible individuals that practice social distancing. We denote the initial
conditions by I0 = I(0), S0 = S(0) as well as E0 = E(0). A susceptible individual determines
his strategy based on a cost-benefit analysis. Hence, by πsd we denote the payoff of social
distancing, and by πnsd the payoff of no social distancing. In our model the perceived cost of
social distancing is Csd > 0 at each time t. Thus, we have
πsd = −Csd .
πnsd depends on two factors: the perceived cost of infection that we denote by CI > 0 and the

Therefore, the payoff of not socially distancing is given by

πnsd = −CI (1 − exp −βI(t) ).
Hence, the dynamics of our model are given by the following system of ordinary differential
equations (ODEs):

Here, ω is a responsiveness parameter, determining the time scale for updating the social
distancing behavior. κ is a rationality parameter. For large κ individuals change their strategy
if the payoff of the other strategy is larger. For small κ only a fraction of the susceptible
individuals depending on the difference in payoff change their strategy. The behavior of this
model is illustrated in Figure 2 for different parameters. For this figure as well as for all other
figures, we used the MATLAB method ode23, which is an implementation of the BogackiShampine method—an explicit Runge-Kutta (2,3) pair.
2.2. Perfect Adaption. In Model (2.1) the dynamics of social distancing E change to direct the amount of infected I towards the amount where πsd = πnsd , i. e. towards I ∗ . Assuming
that this adaption works perfectly, we obtain the following model.
This model is given by the ODEs

If I > I ∗ , then E is increasing. If I < I ∗ then E is decreasing. On the other hand, if E
is sufficiently large, this causes a decrease in I and if E is sufficiently small this causes an
increase in I. If the amount of infections is high, people are more aware of the disease and
practice social distancing. As soon as the amount of infections is small again, this awareness
fades and people do not feel the need to practice social distancing anymore. As a result, more
people become infected again leading to a higher awareness and more people practicing social
distancing. We refer to this feedback loop as oscillatory tragedy of the commons. Instead
of high compliance to social distancing until the disease has died of, we find a decrease in
individuals practicing social distancing when the amount of infected is sufficiently small. This
then causes another rise of infections. We can observe this in Model (2.1) as I oscillates
around I ∗ with decreasing amplitude until the peak of the oscillations is smaller than I ∗ (see
Figure 4).
3.2. Social Distancing Saves Lives. When comparing Model (2.1) to the SIR model,
we immediately note that the total number of infections can be significantly smaller with
social distancing (see Figure 5). Essentially, this means that voluntary social distancing can
significantly reduce the total amount of infections R(∞). However, we also note that infections
after the first wave of infection only emerge due to the oscillatory tragedy of the commons. If
social distancing was practiced until I = 0, we would have a much smaller R(∞).
Perfect adaption and Model (2.1) significantly reduce the total amount of infections compared to the SIR model. This is especially apparent for small I ∗ and slow adaption, i. e. small
ω and κ. This is illustrated in Figure 6.
Essentially, the explanation for this behavior relates to herd immunity. Social distancing
flattens the curve. Instead of one large wave of infections as in the SIR model, in Model (2.1)
we can have several waves of infection with smaller peaks. An example of this is illustrated
in Figure 5. In the SIR model, herd immunity occurs if
S<

γ
.
β

Thus, I is increasing until S = βγ and then is monotonically decreasing. Even though, we have
achieved some kind of herd immunity at this point, the high number of infected I still causes a
high amount of new infections after herd immunity. Thus, the total amount of infections R(∞)
is significantly larger than needed to obtain herd immunity. In Model (2.1), the dynamics are
much more complicated. However, what remains as in the SIR model, is that as soon as (or

the peak is smaller than I ∗ . We see that the number and amplitude of oscillations depends on the
parameters ω, κ, Csd , CI as well as β and γ.

the amount of infected I is monotonically decreasing, since then

I˙ = β(1 − E)SI − γI ≤ βSI − γI < 0.
We denote the amount of infected when herd immunity is obtained by IHI . With social
distancing IHI can become significantly smaller since social distancing significantly reduces
the amount of infection. Other factors influencing the amount of new infection after herd
immunity are the amount of recovered when herd immunity is achieved (denoted by RHI ) as
well as the amount of people practicing social distancing. RHI can be much larger when social
distancing is practiced due to the spread of infections over a longer time period. People that
practice social distancing further reduce the amount of new infections.
Together, all these factors cause a significant decrease in new infections after herd immunity is achieved. Since small IHI mostly coincides with large RHI as well as high E, we focus
on IHI here. When choosing the parameters ω, κ, Csd , CI such that IHI is small, RHI and many
people practice social distancing, we can even achieve R(∞) to be near the herd immunity
threshold 1 − βγ . For an illustration of this, see Figure 7.
This also explains why perfect adaption causes larger total amounts of infections than
Model (2.1). For perfect adaption, herd immunity is obtained for t = t∗ with I = I ∗ while IHI
often is significantly smaller in Model (2.1). In particular, if we have I > I ∗ while S is close

We clearly see here that social distancing reduces the total amount of infections.

to βγ , small increases in E cause a decrease in I. Hence, IHI < I ∗ in most cases. For instance,
in Figure 7a we have I ∗ ≈ 0.00268 while IHI can be much smaller in Model (2.1). However,
we once again remember the oscillatory tragedy of the commons, i. e. that higher compliance
to social distancing when I is small could lead to much smaller R(∞).
Next, we want to analyze how the perceived cost of social distancing Csd as well as the
perceived cost of infection CI influence the total amount of infections R(∞).
3.3. Larger Cost of Infection and Smaller Cost of Social Distancing Reduce Infections.
As one might expect, if the cost of infection CI increases or the cost of social distancing Csd
decreases, this induces an increase in the amount of people practicing social distancing and
thereby a decrease in infections. This behavior becomes quite apparent in Figure 8.
We can observe a similar tendency for CI . Though, here we have larger oscillations in the
total size of infections. These oscillations decrease in their amplitude and level off at RPA (∞).
An example for this behavior can be seen in Figure 9.
An explanation for this behavior is connected to the observation made in Subsection 3.2
that is illustrated in Figure 7. To reduce R(∞), (among other factors) IHI has to be small.
One way to achieve this is to reduce I ∗ , the threshold that I oscillates around. Therefore,
smaller Csd as well as larger CI tend to cause a decrease in R(∞). However, this does not yet
explain how the oscillations occur. For this purpose, we have a look at Figure 10. Here, we
see that reducing I ∗ has two opposing effects on R(∞):

Figure 6: Comparison of the total number of infected for the SIR model, perfect adaption and Model
(2.1) with initial values I0 = 0.01, S0 = 0.99, E0 = 0.2, and (a) ω = 1.5 and κ = 0.5 respectively
ω = 2 and κ = 1, (b) ω = 1 and κ = 0.5 respectively ω = 1 and κ = 2, (c) ω = 1 and κ = 0.5
respectively ω = 1 and κ = 2. Clearly, in perfect adaption and Model (2.1) the total amount of
infections can be significantly smaller than in the SIR model. We see that also in Model (2.1) the
amount of infections tends to grow if I ∗ grows. This will be discussed in Subsection 3.3. Moreover,
small adaption parameters ω and κ in Model (2.1) can significantly reduce infections compared to
perfect adaption as well as larger adaption parameters. This will be discussed in Subsection 3.4.

(i) A decrease in I ∗ causes a decrease in the size of the waves of infections and thus a
decrease in IHI . This causes a decrease in R(∞).
(ii) When decreasing I ∗ too much, this can lead to the development of a new wave of
infections. When this occurs, we have an increase in I, before herd immunity is
obtained. This causes a larger IHI . Therefore, we have an increase in the total amount
of infections R(∞) when a new wave of infections develops.
This leads to the oscillations, that we observed in Figure 9. When reducing Csd we first
see a decrease in R(∞) (caused by smaller waves of infection and a smaller IHI ) followed by
an increase (induced by a new wave of infections that leads to an increase in IHI ).
3.4. Faster Responses and Higher Rationality Increase Infections. Two other important
factors determining R(∞) are the responsiveness ω and the rationality parameter κ. In Model
(2.1), a larger ω causes faster adaption of social distancing to the amount of infected. This
has two opposing effects.
(i) On the one hand, faster adaptions causes a decrease in the duration of the waves of
infection with smaller maxima and larger minima.

Figure 7: Occurrence of herd immunity for different parameters in Model (2.1). In both examples,
herd immunity occurs for S < βγ . However, for the parameters in (a), we have significantly less infected
at this point than in (b). In (a) the small amount IHI causes much less new infections than the larger
IHI in (b). Therefore, the total amount of infections for (a) is much smaller than for (b).

(ii) On the other hand, these smaller waves of infection can cause the development of
another wave of infection. In particular, if herd immunity is obtained before this new
wave recedes, this leads to an increase in IHI . Thus, leading to an increase of infections.
Overall, we thus have oscillations in R(∞) depending on ω. An example of this is illustrated
in Figure 11.
With increasing ω the deviations of I from I ∗ are decreasing due to faster adaption. This
leads to a decrease in the amplitude of the oscillations in R(∞) and to R(∞) leveling off
approximately at RPA (∞). As explained before, we mostly have IHI < I ∗ . Therefore, larger
deviations from perfect adaption where IHI = I ∗ cause a decrease in R(∞). An example of
this behavior is illustrated in Figure 12.
The rationality parameter κ has a nearly similar effect as ω on the dynamics of our model.
In Model (2.1), a large rationality parameter κ means that individuals change their strategy
as soon as the payoff of infection becomes larger than the payoff of social distancing and vice
versa. Therefore, large κ induce faster adaption of E and therefore smaller oscillations of I
around I ∗ . An increase in κ thus causes a decrease in the duration in the waves of infection as
well as smaller maxima and larger minima. Hence, a change in κ has a similar effect on R(∞)
as a change in ω. Here as well, we have oscillations caused by the development of new waves
of infection, that are decreasing and leveling off at RPA (∞). Thus, R(∞) tends to decrease

Figure 8: Total number of infections dependent of the cost of social distancing. We compare Model
(2.1) for different costs of social distancing. Here, we have I0 = 0.01, S0 = 0.99, E0 = 0.3. In all three
scenarios, we see that despite small oscillations in R(∞) the number of infections is overall increasing
in Csd . Moreover, we see that for large CI the total number of infections can be significantly smaller,
i. e. the tendency that higher costs of infection decrease the number of infections. Moreover, larger CI
as well as larger κ and ω cause a higher number of smaller oscillations.

for smaller κ (see Figure 13).
4. Discussion & Conclusion. Social distancing is often used in combination with other
control measures such as mask wearing, and testing and isolation. It is worthy of further
investigation to account for individual preferences in their adoption choices when multiple
interventions for disease mitigation are available. Generally speaking, individuals become less
vigilant and feel less need to follow disease intervention measures suggested by public health
officials, if the epidemic curve is being bended down, but as a result, the uptick of cases in
turn causes individuals to increase their compliance levels. The feedback loop of this sort gives
rise to an oscillatory dynamics of behavioral compliance and disease prevalence, as reported
in the present work. Similar phenomena have previously been studied in the context of ecoevolutionary dynamics where the payoff structure of individual interactions can be regulated
by the environmental feedback [43, 44, 45].
Social distancing can be regarded as an altruistic behavior that incurs a cost to oneself but
collectively benefits other community members especially these vulnerable in the population.
Thus monetary or non-monetary means can be used to incentivize non-compulsory social
distancing. For example, during the COVID-19 health crisis, governments have subsidized

different costs of social distancing (with inital values I0 = 0.01, S0 = 0.99, E0 = 0.2). R(∞) shows
oscillations with decreasing amplitude. These oscillations appear to be leveling of approximately at
RPA (∞). We see the tendency that R(∞) decreases for increasing CI . Moreover, R(∞) is smaller here

the cost of staying at home through tax reduction or other stimulus packages for both workers
and their employers [28]. Besides, an individual who opts for social distancing can create
a positive psychological reward, which in fact reduces the perceived overall cost of social
distancing. As shown in several experimental works [46, 47, 48], encouraging altruistic social
distancing, especially if people can afford to do so, through promoting a strong sense of
community, empathy and compassion [49], can lead to desired compliance of social distancing.
In this sense, promoting human cooperation in the social dilemma of disease control is a new
promising direction for future work.
While our proof-of-principle model offers enlightening insights into understanding compliance issues in the dilemma of social distancing, targeted social distancing can be investigated
by further accounting for individual heterogeneity as the attack rate and mortality rate of
infectious diseases, such as the influenza [50, 51] and the COVID-19 pandemic [52], are agedependent. Thus, extending our model with an age structure will be useful to quantify the
heterogeneity in both the risk of infections and the cost of social distancing for each age
group. This consideration parameterized using realistic contact mixing matrices in a social
network [53] as well as with an age structure (more generally, multilayer networks [54]) can
be used to optimize social network-based distancing protocol (targeted social distancing) [34].
Further work along this direction is promising and will help provide practical guidance. More-

Even though, we have a smaller I ∗ here, the third wave of infection causes an increase in overall
infections. Here, we have R(∞) ≈ 0.4442 and thus even more infections than for Csd = 1.8.

over, it appears that instead of the actual likelihood to get infected, one’s perceived likelihood
to get infected influences the decision whether to engage in social distancing and face covering [46]. Variation in individual risk assessment might therefore influence the results in our
model and be an interesting extension to the model in future work.
In sum, we analyze and characterize oscillatory dynamics in the dilemma of social distancing, which arises from the nontrivial feedback between disease prevalence and behavioral
intervention. Our results suggest an oscillatory tragedy of the commons in disease control
when individuals act in their own right without coordination or in the absence of centralized
institutions to enforce their compliance, a phenomenon that has been observed in past pandemics like the Spanish flu [55] and seems to repeat in the current COVID-19 pandemic [56].
Our work provides new insight into the dual role of human behavior that can fuel, or fight
against, the pandemic [57]. To resolve the dilemma of disease control from global pandemics to
resurgence of common diseases (like measles which has become endemic in some regions [58]),
a deep understanding of pertinent behavioral aspect in disease control and prevention, and
large-scale human cooperation in particular, is urgently needed and will help to better inform
pandemic support in the future [49].

Figure 11: Development of an oscillation in the total number of infections. In Model (2.1) with
β = 0.9, γ = 0.6, κ = 0.5, CI = 100, Csd = 1 and initial condition I0 = 0.01, E0 = 0.2, we observe
the amount of infected I. As can be seen in Figure 12, R(∞) has a local minimum in this case
approximately at ω = 5. In (a) we have ω = 5, herd immunity is achieved for t ≈ 50 and at this
time, we have IHI ≈ 0.0083. The total amount of infections is given by R(∞) ≈ 0.4316. For (b)
ω = 6 herd immunity is achieved at approximately the same time, with IIHI ≈ 0.0094 and total
amount of infections R(∞) ≈ 0.4385. For (c) ω = 7 herd immunity is achieved at approximately the
same time, with IHI ≈ 0.0106 and total amount of infections R(∞) ≈ 0.4432. Finally, for (c) ω = 8
herd immunity is achieved at approximately the same time, with IHI ≈ 0.0101 and total amount of
infections R(∞) ≈ 0.4395. For increasing ω, we observe that the first three waves of infection decrease
in duration and intensity. However, a fourth wave of infection develops. This leads to an increase in
the amount of infections when herd immunity is achieved and therefore an increase in the total amount
of infections for ω = 6 respectively ω = 7 compared to ω = 5. For ω = 8, however, herd immunity
is only obtained after the fourth wave of infection is already decreasing again. Therefore, we have a
decrease in the total amount of infections for ω = 8 compared to ω = 7. Note also that the amount of
infected when herd immunity is achieved, is in all cases smaller than I ∗ . If we have I > I ∗ while S is
close to βγ , small increases in E cause a decrease in I. Hence, I is mostly smaller than I ∗ when herd
immunity occurs. This also induces that R(∞) is mostly smaller than RPA (∞) as can also be seen in
Figure 12.

Figure 12: Total number of infections dependent of the responsiveness rate. We compare Model
(2.1) for different rationality parameters with perfect adaption. Again, we have the initial condition
I0 = 0.01, E0 = 0.2. R(∞) shows oscillations with decreasing amplitude converging to perfect adaption
here again for the same reasons as explained in Subsection 3.3. This also explains the increasing
number of oscillations for increasing κ and CI . Moreover, R(∞) appears to be increasing for increasing
ω, in particular, if κ and CI are small.
