ABSTRACT
The global COVID-19 pandemic has led to the online proliferation of health-, political-, and conspiratorial-based
misinformation. Understanding the reach and belief in this misinformation is vital to managing this crisis, as
well as future crises. The results from our global survey finds a troubling reach of and belief in COVID-related
misinformation, as well as a correlation with those that primarily consume news from social media, and, in the
United States, a strong correlation with political leaning.

Introduction
The COVID-19 global pandemic has been an ideal breeding ground for online misinformation and conspiracies:
Social-media traffic has reached an all-time record1 as people are forced to remain at home, often idle, anxious, and
hungry for information2 , while at the same time, social-media services are unable to rely on human moderators
to enforce their rules3 . The resulting spike in COVID-19 related misinformation is of grave concern to health
professionals4 .
A vaccine holds the potential to save untold lives; yet since July 2020 there has been significant growth in
anti-vaccine misinformation on social media with accounts of “anti-vaxxers" gaining at least 7.8 million followers
since 20195 . The consequences of this movement include a general erosion of trust in scientific expertise as well as
opposition to vaccination — between May and September of this year, intent to get vaccinated has declined in the
United States6, 7 . Based on the growing momentum of the anti-vaxx movement, researchers predict that, in a decade,
such anti-vaccination views will be dominant8 . As a result of this landscape, the World Health Organization has
listed the need for surveys and qualitative research about the infodemic in its top priorities to contain the pandemic9 .
A recent survey confirmed that belief in COVID-19 conspiracy theories is associated with smaller compliance
with public health directives10 . Another recent study found that political affiliation is a strong predictor of knowledge
of COVID-19 related information11 . Building on this earlier work, we launched a large-scale, multi-lingual, global
study to examine the belief in 21 prevalent COVID-19 related false statements, and 21 corresponding true statements,
Table 1 1 . We evaluate the reach and belief in these statements and correlate the results with political leaning, primary
source of media consumption, and intent to vaccinate.

Methods
A total of 2, 708 respondents were recruited from Ipsos’ online panel.2 Ipsos is a global company that specializes
in market research and public opinion. Respondents includes a diverse sample across more than 100 countries.
To ensure appropriate representation, Ipsos uses quota sampling to provide a sample that is matched to country
demographics based on age, gender, ethnicity, and geography. respondents were recruited from countries spanning
four regions of the world: Central and South America (CSA), Middle East and North Africa (MENA), United States
1 All

data will be made available in a public data repository
research was approved by UC Berkeley’s Office for Protection of Human Subjects, Protocol ID: 2019-08-12441. Respondents gave
informed consent prior to taking part.

Figure 1. Averaged across all four geographic regions (N = 2, 095), the number of false and true statements, out of
21 each, that reached respondent (they directly heard or read it), are believed by respondent, and are believed by
someone known to respondent. The black asterisks correspond to the mean, the kink in the box plot corresponds to
the median, the box plot height corresponds to the interquartile range (1st − 3rd quartile), and the dashed lines
correspond to the minimum and maximum.
(US), and Western Europe (WE) (for more details about the population and sample demographics see Table ?? in the
Supplementary Materials). Ipsos reported a 75% response rate corresponding to an AAPOR response rate of 1.
Respondents were instructed they would participate in a study evaluating COVID-19 related misinformation.
They read, one at a time, 42 statements, Table 1, half of which are true and half are not, and specify: (1) if they
had seen/heard the statement before; (2) if they believed the statement to be true; and (3) if they know someone
that believes or is likely to believe the statement. With self-censorship of personal views on the rise12 , asking
participants what they think others believe might provide a more accurate indication of regional views13 . The study
was available in six languages (Arabic, English, French, German, Italian, Spanish), and respondents selected their
preferred language.
The 42 statements were sourced from reputable fact-checking websites. To ensure a balanced design, each false
statement was matched with a similarly themed true statement. Of the originally selected statements, four of the
21 false statements and seven of the 21 true statements contained content specific to the United States, and were
only shown in this region. For the other three regions, each of these US-specific statements was replaced with a
statement consistent in theme but with content that was considered more relevant in these other regions. The 42
statements plus three attention-check questions, Table 1, were presented in a random order. After responding to all
statements, respondents were asked six questions relating to the COVID-19 crisis: their intention to get vaccinated,
perceptions of their government’s handling of the crisis, whether, globally, they believe that the situation is getting
better or worse, their own level of fear about getting the virus, and their general level of happiness. At the end of the
survey, respondents were also asked how they consume news (television, newspapers (print or online), radio, social
media, word of mouth), their political leaning (strongly left, slightly left, center, slightly right, strongly right), and
basic demographics: education-level, age, gender, and race (U.S. only). All responses were collected between July
14, 2020 and July 28, 2020, amidst the global COVID-19 crisis.
The three, obviously false, attention-check questions were used to ensure that respondents were paying attention
2/12

to the survey. A respondent’s data was discarded if they failed to correctly answer any of these attention-check
questions: in CSA 100 of the 652 responses were discarded, yielding 552 usable responses; in MENA 160 of the
676 responses were discarded, yielding 516 responses; in the US, 203 of the 721 responses were discarded, yielding
518 responses; and in WE, 150 of the 659 responses were discarded, yielding 509 responses. At the end of the study,
respondents were again informed that half of the statements they read were not true, asked to confirm that they
understood this, and were directed to several websites with accurate health information.

Results
Central and South America (CSA)
On average, 52.6% | 38.9% of true | false statements, Table 1, reached respondents, 51.0% | 21.8% of true | false
statements are believed, and 58.7% | 44.0% of true | false statements are believed by others known to the respondent.
The median number of true | false statements that reached a respondent is 11 | 8, the median number of true | false
statements believed by a respondent is 11 | 4, the median number of true | false statements believed by others known
to the respondent is 12 | 9, and 77.4% believe at least one false conspiracy (false statements 10-14 in Table 1).
The results of six negative binomial regression models reveal only small effects of respondent demographics on
the reach, belief, and belief by others in the true | false statements. The predictor variables are respondent gender,
age, education, political leaning, and main news source. Political leaning did not predict the likelihood of believing
any of the statements, and main news source influenced the likelihood of believing only 1 | 21 false statements.
Middle East and North Africa (MENA)
On average, 47.4% | 35.6% of true | false statements reached respondents, 45.2% | 20.5% of true | false statements
are believed, and 52.0% | 37.0% of the true | false statements are believed by others known to the respondent. The
median number of true | false statements that reached a respondent is 10 | 7, the median number of true | false
statements believed by a respondent is 10 | 4, the median number of true | false statements believed by others known
to the respondent is 11 | 8, and 65.9% believe at least one false conspiracy.
The results of six negative binomial regression models reveal only small effects of respondent demographics on
the reach, belief, and belief by others in the true | false statements. Political leaning did not predict the likelihood
of believing any of the statements, and main news source influenced the likelihood of believing only 1 | 21 false
statements.
United States (US)
On average, 42.3% | 27.1% of true | false statements reached respondents, 41.2% | 16.0% of true | false statements
are believed, and 49.6% | 33.7% of the true | false statements are believed by others known to the respondent.
The median number of true | false statements that reached a respondent is 9 | 6, the median number of true | false
statements believed by a respondent is 9 | 3, the median number of true | false statements believed by others known
to the respondent is 10 | 6, and 54.3% believe at least one false conspiracy.
We conducted six negative binomial regression models with six outcome variables corresponding to the reach,
belief, and belief by others in each true | false statement. Political leaning and main news source had an effect on the
likelihood of the number of false statements believed. The number of false statements believed by those on the right
of the political spectrum3 is 1.91 times greater than those on the left (95% CI [1.54, 2.37]). The number of false
statements believed by those with social media as their main source of news is 1.40 times greater than those who
cited another main news source (95% CI [1.19, 1.66]).
We next performed a binary logistic regression to evaluate how political leaning and main news source influenced
belief in each false statement. Political leaning influenced the likelihood of believing 12 | 21 false statements, and
main news source influenced the likelihood of believing 9 | 21 false statements. For 11 | 12 false statements where
there is an effect of political leaning, those on the right are more likely to believe the false information. For all 9
3 From

518 responses, 125 | 137 reported as politically left | right of center, and 256 as center. For the evaluation of the impact of political
leaning, only those reporting left | right of center were considered.

Table 1. Twenty-one false (top) and true (middle) statements and three obviously false attention-check statements.
Shown in the four right most columns is, per statement, the percentage of statements that reached (R), are believed
by (B), and are believed by others (O) in each geographical region.

4/12

false statements, where there was an effect of main news source, those with social media as a main source are more
likely to believe the false information. The four largest effects were based on political leaning, where, as compared
to those on the left, those on the right are:
• 11.87 times more likely to believe that “Gargling warm water with salt or vinegar eliminates infection from
COVID-19", 95% CI [2.68, 52.55].
• 8.21 times more likely to believe that “House Democrats included 25 million to boost their own salaries in
their proposal for the COVID-19 related stimulus package", 95% CI [4.29, 15.72].
• 7.25 times more likely to believe that “Asymptomatic carriers of COVID-19 (infected but no symptoms) who
die of other medical problems are added to the coronavirus death toll to get the numbers up to justify this
pandemic response", 95% CI [3.92, 13.39].
• 6.30 times more likely to believe that “COVID-19 was man-made in a lab and is not thought to be a natural
virus", 95% CI [3.25, 12.21].
The one false statement that those on the left are more likely to believe (4.53 times more likely, 95% CI [1.94, 10.54])
than those on the right was, “US President Donald Trump tweeted that economic stimulus checks would only go to
those who have not made negative social media comments about him",
The effects of main news source on likelihood of believing false statements is smaller than the effects of political
leaning. The two largest effects were that those with social media as their primary source are:
• 3.14 times more likely to believe that “Drinking sodium bicarbonate and lemon juice reduces the acidity of
the body and the risk of getting infected with COVID-19", 95% CI [1.49, 6.60].
• 2.97 times more likely to believe that “The COVID-19 outbreak is not actually caused by a virus, but by
5G-wireless phone technology", 95% CI [1.29, 6.83].
Western Europe (WE)
On average, 42.7% | 24.0% of true | false statements reached respondents, 43.4% | 11.7% of true | false statements
are believed, and 47.5% | 24.4% of the true | false statements are believed by others known to the respondent.
The median number of true | false statements that reached a respondent is 9 | 5, the median number of true | false
statements believed by a respondent is 9 | 2, the median number of true | false statements believed by others known
to the respondent is 10 | 4, and 55.2% believe at least one false conspiracy (see also14 ).
As before, we examined the effect of respondent demographics on the reach, belief, and belief by others in the
true | false statements. Age is the only factor that had an effect on the likelihood of the number of false statements
that are believed. The number of false statements believed by younger respondents4 is 1.36 times greater than by
older respondents (95% CI [1.15, 1.60]).
Examining the effect of political leaning and main news source on belief in each false statement revealed that
political leaning influenced the likelihood of believing 3 | 21 false statements and main news source influenced the
likelihood of believing 2 | 21 false statements. For 2 | 3 false statements where there is an effect of political leaning
those on the right are more likely to believe the false information. Specifically, as compared to those on the left,
those on the right are:
• 2.99 times more likely to believe that “COVID-19 was man-made in a lab and is not thought to be a natural
virus", 95% CI [1.66, 5.37].
• 1.89 times more likely to believe that “Asymptomatic carriers of COVID-19 (infected but no symptoms) who
die of other medical problems are added to the coronavirus death toll to get the numbers up to justify this
pandemic response", 95% CI [1.10, 3.24].
The one false statement that those on the left are more likely to believe (2.23 times more likely, 95% CI [1.21, 4.09])
than those on the right is that “In a speech, President Vladimir Putin blamed the West for the spread of COVID-19".
For both false statements where there is an effect of main news source, those with social media as a main source
are more likely to believe the false information. Specifically, those with social media as their primary source are:
4 The

younger and older age groups were created based on the median respondent age of 40.

5/12

• 2.38 times more likely to believe that “Hand sanitizer has the same ingredients as antifreeze and can be fatal
to pets if they lick your hand",95% CI [1.36, 4.15].
• 2.22 times more likely to believe that “UK’s NHS banned alcohol consumption and sales in an effort to combat
COVID-19", 95% CI [1.18, 4.17].
Vaccination
Respondents’ intent to get vaccinated is significantly lower in the US (59.3%) and WE (64.0%) than in MENA
(74.6%) or CSA (79.2%). For each region, we performed a binary logistic regression to examine whether respondent
demographics are associated with intent to get vaccinated. In US, political leaning has the largest effect: those on
the right are 3.17 times less likely to say they will get vaccinated than those on the left, 95% CI [1.83, 5.49]. In
WE there are only small effects with the most substantial being that of education: those who have completed an
undergraduate degree or higher are 1.94 times more likely to say they will get vaccinated, 95% CI [1.32, 2.85]. In
CSA and MENA, there are no reliable effects of demographics on intent to get vaccinated.

Crowd Sourcing vs. Ipsos
Because of the cost of recruiting a large representative sample, we wondered if standard crowd-sourcing surveys
could replicate our basic findings. To this end, in addition to the Ipsos samples, a total of 601, US-based respondents
were recruited from Mechanical Turk (MTurk) workers. These respondents were an opportunity sample with no
demographic quotas. The survey materials and procedure were identical to those described in the Methods section.
All responses were collected between June 5, 2020 and July 14, 2020, amidst the global COVID-19 crisis. Based on
responses to the attention-check questions, 100 of the 601 responses were discarded, yielding a total of 501 usable
responses. Respondents were paid $3.00 for their participation in the study.
The pattern of responses for the two samples (MTurk and Ipsos) differ somewhat both in terms of reach and
belief. On average, 54.6% | 35.8% of true | false statements reached MTurk respondents (cf Ipsos: 42.3% | 27.1%),
and 53.3% | 11.4% of true | false statements are believed (cf Ipsos: 41.2% | 16.0%). Generally speaking, the MTurk
respondents saw more COVID-related information, but were more likely to believe true statements and less likely to
believe false statements.
One possible explanation for these results is the demographic differences between the two samples. For example,
51% of MTurk respondents identified as left of the political center, as compared to only 24% of the Ipsos respondents;
52% of MTurk respondents completed undergraduate studies as compared to 39% of Ipsos respondents; and 16% of
the MTurk respondents were between 18 − 29 years old, as compared to 26% of the Ipsos respondents.
To examine the impact of demographic differences, we matched the MTurk and Ipsos samples based on age,
gender, education, and political affiliation. This yielded a total of 210 matched MTurk samples. Even with this
demographic matching, however, there was still a notable difference in reach and belief: 53.0% | 35.9% of true | false
statements reached MTurk respondents (cf Ipsos: 42.3% | 27.1%), and 51.6% | 13.7% of true | false statements are
believed (cf Ipsos: 41.2% | 16.0%).
These results suggest that there might be a more fundamental difference between the two samples beyond simple
demographics. If this is the case, then caution should be taken when using crowd sourcing to recruit a representative
sample (see also, for example,15 ).

Discussion
We find, what we believe to be, a troubling global reach and belief in COVID-19 misinformation and conspiracies.
Overall, the highest levels of reach and belief in false statements are in Central/South America (CSA) and the
Middle East and North Africa (MENA). The reach of and belief in false statements is lower in Western Europe
(WE) than in United States (US), yet true statements have similar reach and belief in these regions. This implies
that the differences in WE and US are not one of access to false information, but the penetration of the false
information. Belief in COVID-19 related misinformation is also more prevalent amongst respondents who consume
news primarily on social media, and this association is more pronounced in the US than in the other three regions.

Belief in misinformation is not partisan in CSA and MENA, is somewhat partisan in WE, and is extremely partisan
in US.
The problem of misinformation seems to be particularly poignant in the United States where partisanship
and news consumption on social media is leading to a particularly misinformed public. The consequences of
an ill-informed public has real-world implications in the form of compliance with health recommendations and
vaccination.
