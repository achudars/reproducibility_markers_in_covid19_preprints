Abstract:
In this work Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is employed in thirty-day windows to quantify
temporal evolution of relative pandemic mitigation inefficiency of Brazilian municipalities. For
each thirty-day window the results of inefficiency scores of over five thousand Brazilian
municipalities are displayed on maps, to address the spatial distribution of the corresponding
values. This phenomenological spatiotemporal approach reveals location of the hotspots, in terms
of relative pandemic inefficiency of the municipalities, at different points in time along the
pandemic. It is expected that the current approach may subsidize decision making through
comparative analysis of previous practice, and thus contribute to the future pandemic mitigation
efforts.

Introduction
A year into the COVID-19 pandemic, Brazil, as many other countries, is currently experiencing a
severe second wave of the disease, currently being described as the world’s epicenter of the
pandemic. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a highly contagious disease caused by severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was declared officially a pandemic by
World Health Organization on March 11, 2020 [1]. Emerging in China, and initially being mostly
contained in that country, the virus has been spreading worldwide ever since. This dispersion has
invoked stringent protective measures against the spread in most countries in the world, ranging
from self-isolation and mandatory quarantine, to curfews and travel restrictions.

The current situation remains precarious: different countries have been implementing different
measures to mitigate the propagation of the virus ever since the pandemic start, but the outcome
of the effectiveness of these diverse measures has yet to be quantified. In Brazil, a continental size
country with over two hundred million inhabitants and over five thousand municipalities, a wide
range of mitigation measures has been implemented by the local governments, at different time
frames. The overall result of these measures is currently often described in the news as disastrous,
with an overloaded health system and a large number of deaths of people waiting for a bed in
intensive care units. On the other hand, Brazil has a very high organizational vaccination capacity
through the highly organized public health system (Sistema Unico de Saude - SUS), but the world’s
capacity of vaccine production has turned insufficient to provide the number of vaccine doses
necessarily to reach collective heard immunity. This is the current problem in most countries,
indicating that a prolonged difficult period still lies ahead. Consequently, it appears paramount to
expand the analysis of the available data in different directions, in the attempt of providing
complementary insight into the phenomenon, in order to aid the policymakers in their decisions.
To this end, Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is employed in this work to quantify mitigation
inefficiency of 5442 Brazilian municipalities along the year of the pandemic, in a spatially explicit
manner. It is expected that the results of this work may aid a governor of a state, or a major of a
city, to compare their own measures, taken at different times, to those of neighboring states or
cities, and draw conclusions as to the efficiency of their own disease mitigation measures.

Data and methodology
Data
The database used in this study [2], available at https://github.com/wcota/covid19br, contains data
on 5570 Brazilian municipalities, including population size, location (latitude and longitude), and
daily numbers of confirmed cases and deaths, since February 25, 2020 (the data used in this work
are up to April 12, 2021). It was found that 128 (very small) municipalities have no reported deaths
along the period under study, and as the subsequent analysis is sensitive to outliers they were
removed from this study, which was performed with the remaining 5442 municipalities.

Data Envelopment Analysis
In what follows Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) method is used to address mitigation
inefficiency of the Brazilian municipalities. DEA was introduced in econometrics, it represents a
powerful, non-parametric method for measurement of relative production efficiency of a given set
of comparable profit organizations. The concept of DEA was originally introduced by Farrell [3],
and subsequently formulated as a Linear Programming based technique by Charnes, Cooper and
Rhodes [4] (the reader is referred to a recent textbook by Charnes et al. [5] for a comprehensive
coverage of the subject). The method is achieved by considering empirical efficiency frontiers,
spanned by such organizations (so called Decision Making Units – DMUs), which use minimal
input to produce maximal output within the observed sample. While DEA was originally
developed for comparative efficiency measurement of economic entities within a strict profit
maximization concept (banks, industries, firms, etc.), it has been subsequently applied to various
multiple input and output situations, where an input is understood as a quantity that should be
minimized, and an output as a quantity that should be maximized, in order to reach the so called
“efficiency frontier”.
The DEA method proceeds as follows. For a set of 𝐾 DMUs, 𝑗 = 1, … , 𝐾 , with 𝑁 (positive) inputs
𝑥𝑗𝑛 , 𝑛 = 1, … , 𝑁 and 𝑀 (positive) outputs 𝑦𝑗𝑚 , 𝑚 = 1, … , 𝑀 the idea of the DEA method lies in
maximizing for each of the DMUs the ratio ℎ𝑘 of the linear combination of all the outputs weighted
by positive coefficients 𝑢𝑚 and the linear combination of the inputs weighted by positive
coefficients 𝑣𝑛
𝑚𝑎𝑥𝑢,𝑣 ℎ𝑘 =

∑𝑀
𝑚=1 𝑢𝑚 𝑦𝑘𝑚

𝑢𝑚 , 𝑣𝑛 ≥ 0

𝑗 = 1, … , 𝑘, … , 𝐾

𝑚 = 1, … , 𝑀 ;

𝑛 = 1, … , 𝑁

(2)

(3)

Effectively, this represents scaling of all of the input and output variables which maximizes the
output versus input ratio of the considered DMU 𝑘, while making sure (by imposing restriction
(2)) that similar ratios (comparative efficiencies) for all of the DMUs remain bounded by unity.
The conditions (3) guarantee the required positivity of the input and output variables after scaling.
It is evident that any solution to relations (1-3), represented by sets of u’s and v’s, is invariant to
uniform scaling, achieved by multiplying all the u’s and the v’s by the same (arbitrary, positive)
constant. As this generates an infinite set of solutions, the usual approach to overcome this problem
and remove the solution degeneracy is to impose the additional constraints, either ∑𝑁
𝑛=1 𝑣𝑛 𝑥𝑗𝑛 = 1
(so called input orientation), or ∑𝑀
𝑚=1 𝑢𝑚 𝑦𝑚 = 1 (output orientation). In the case of input
orientation, the procedure is now reduced to determining
𝑀

𝑚𝑎𝑥𝑢,𝑣 ℎ𝑘 = ∑ 𝑢𝑚 𝑦𝑘𝑚

𝑢𝑚 , 𝑣𝑛 ≥ 0

𝑚 = 1, … , 𝑀 ;

𝑛 = 1, … , 𝑁

(7)

which is called input oriented DEA “multipler formulation”. Finally, it turns out that every linear
programming problem has two equivalent formulations, and that the dual formulation (so called
“envelopment form”) is numerically more advantageous (as there are more DMUs than inputs and
outputs), so the common input oriented DEA formulation found in the literature is given by
𝜃𝑘 ≡ 𝑚𝑖𝑛𝜃,𝜆 (𝜃)
subject to

𝑚 = 1, … , 𝑀

(10)

𝑗 = 1, … , 𝐾

𝜃, 𝜆𝑗 ≥ 0

Here 𝜆𝑗 are positive coefficients to be adjusted (for each DMU 𝑘) in order to minimize 𝜃𝑘 (instead
of scale factors 𝑢𝑚 and 𝑣𝑛 in the multiplier formulation (4-7)). For each DMU with efficiency
below unity, this input oriented DEA formulation indicates as a goal the reduction of inputs
necessary for reaching the efficiency frontier.
In the output oriented DEA version, by normalizing the linear combination of outputs,
relations (1-3) are transformed to yield the multiplier form
𝑁

𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑢,𝑣 𝑔𝑘 = ∑ 𝑣𝑛 𝑥𝑘𝑛

(12)

subject to

∑ 𝑢𝑚 𝑦𝑚 = 1

(14)

𝑛=1

𝑢𝑚 , 𝑣𝑛 ≥ 0

𝑚 = 1, … , 𝑀 ;

𝑛 = 1, … , 𝑁

(15)

Finally, the linear programming problem dual to relations (12-15) yields the envelopment form
𝜔𝑘 = 𝑚𝑎𝑥𝜔,𝜆 (𝜔))
subject to conditions

𝐾

𝑗 = 1, … , 𝐾

(19)

𝑗=1
𝐾

𝑥𝑘𝑛 ≥ ∑ 𝜆𝑗 𝑥𝑗𝑛
𝑗=1

𝜔, 𝜆𝑗 ≥ 0
and the efficiency of the 𝑘-th DMU is given by 𝜃𝑘 = 1/𝜔𝑘 .

Both the above versions of DEA are said to have constant returns to scale (CRS), referring to the
assumption that outputs can grow indefinitely with input increase, and approach zero as the inputs
go to zero. In order to account for possible scale effects for very small and very large DMUs,
Banker, Charnes and Cooper [6] have proposed the so called variable returns to scale (VRS)
version of DEA, which is implemented by adding a single additional constraint
𝐾

∑ 𝜆𝑗 = 1
𝑗=1

to the envelopment forms (8-11) and (16-19). All the above versions of DEA represent typical
linear programming problems, and are solved numerically.
To examine the “efficiency frontier”, in the current context of COVID 19 the numbers of
confirmed cases and deaths can be taken as an input, and municipality population as output, in
which case the so called input oriented DEA is adequate, which considers the reduction of inputs
for which the observed DMU reaches the efficiency frontier. On the other hand, if the main interest
is to identify the most inefficient municipalities (the “inefficiency frontier”), population can be
taken as input, and the numbers of confirmed cases and deaths taken as outputs: if one of two
particular municipalities, with the same population size, has more confirmed cases, and/or more
deaths, it is considered to exhibit a higher mitigation inefficiency than the other. In this case the
so called output oriented DEA is implemented, which considers the increase of the quantity of
outputs (here confirmed cases and deaths) at which the observed DMU reaches the “inefficiency
frontier”.

Inverse Distance Weighting
The spatial distribution of the values is obtained in this work by interpolation using standard
isotropic Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) technique, introduced by Shepard [7]. Interpolated
value of the quantity 𝑢(𝒙) at point 𝒙 is found from the known values 𝑢(𝒙𝒊 ) at the 𝐾 neighboring
data points 𝒙𝒊 , 𝑖 = 1, … , 𝐾, using
∑𝐾
𝑖=1 𝑤𝑖 𝑢(𝒙𝒊 )
𝑢(𝑥) =
∑𝐾
𝑖=1 𝑤𝑖

(7)

1
𝑑(𝒙, 𝒙𝒊 )𝑝

(8)

where
𝑤𝑖 =

and 𝑑(𝒙, 𝒙𝒊 ) ≠ 0 is the distance between the points 𝒙 and 𝒙𝒊 . The actual value of the parameter 𝑝
is taken to be 𝑝 = 2 throughout this work, as originally proposed by Shepard [7].

Results and discussion

confirmed cases over the period of study, confirmed percentage (number of confirmed cases per
100 inhabitants), number of deaths, deaths per 100000 inhabitants, death rate (number of deaths
per hundred confirmed cases), and the DEA scores for the efficiency and the inefficiency versions,
in both CRS and VRS versions, are presented in Tab. 1.

The range of the data of four orders of magnitude indicates use of a logarithmic scale for
adequate display of the histograms of population, number of confirmed cases, and number of
deaths, as presented in Fig 1.

Fig. 1. Histograms of the population count, total confirmed cases, and deaths in the period of
observation, on logarithmic scale.

It is seen from Tab. 1, and Fig. 1 that population, confirmed cases and number of deaths span
several orders of magnitude, suggestive of power law behavior. In fact, the validity of Zipf’s law
[8,9] (also called rank-size rule) has already been shown for Brazilian cities [10], and for COVID19 cases for a number of countries [11]. Zipf’s law holds for a given dataset if for the ordered
values 𝑍1 > 𝑍2 > ⋯ > 𝑍𝑟 > ⋯ > 𝑍𝑁 the plot of 𝑙𝑛(𝑍𝑟 ) versus 𝑙𝑛(𝑟) is linear. In the current case,
all three quantities follow the Zipf’s law for a wide range of values, with a rather similar exponent
(slope on the log-log plot), as can be seen in Fig. 2.

Fig. 2. Value versus rank of the population count, total confirmed cases and deaths, for 5442
Brazilian municipalities, in the period of observation, on double logarithmic scale. Linear behavior
in a wide range confirms validity of Zipf’s law.

The spatial distribution of population, confirmed cases and deaths over the study period is shown
in Fig. 3 (again on logarithmic scale), together with the death rate (number of deaths divided by
the number of confirmed cases, on linear scale). It is seen that the spatial distribution of confirmed
cases and deaths closely matches the municipality population size distribution, while the death rate
spatial distribution reveals a rather different pattern, that should be more scrutinized by local
governments of municipalities shown in red on Fig. 3d.

Time evolution of the percentage of population confirmed positive for coronavirus, deaths
per 100000 inhabitants, and the death rate are presented in Figs. 4, 5 and 6, respectively.
Cumulative values in twelve consecutive 30 day windows are used, from 4/4/2020 to 3/30/2021,
so that month labels in the figures correspond to predominant months of the consecutive thirtyday periods. As these variables are all scaled in terms of municipality size, linear scales are used,

with color coding adjusted in each case to emphasize the difference among the periods of
observation and the geographic regions.

windows.

Figure 5. Number of deaths per 100000 inhabitants, in consecutive 30 day windows.

Figure 6. Percentage of confirmed cases that end up in deaths, in consecutive 30 day windows.

By comparing Figs. 4 and 5, it is seen that the number of deaths per 100K inhabitants rather closely
follows the population confirmed cases percentage, both in terms of time evolution and spatial
distribution, as perhaps may be expected. On the other hand, the death rate (number of deaths per
number of confirmed cases) presented in Fig. 6 shows alarmingly high values in different regions
of the country, at different timeframes, and does not seem to be related directly with the known
peak in August 2020, and the ongoing peak since the beginning of 2021, in terms of confirmed
cases and/or deaths. It follows that this variable should be scrutinized more closely in terms of
association with individual mitigation measures taken locally by state and municipal governments.

The results of the DEA analysis, both in terms of the efficiency frontier, and the inefficiency
frontier, for both constant and variable returns to scale, is shown in Fig. 7. While inefficiency (𝐼)
may be seen as a complement of efficiency (𝐸) to unity (e.g. as 𝐼 = 1 − 𝐸), it is important to
emphasize here that the DEA method relies heavily on the concept of outliers. More precisely, if
a single municipality exhibits zero deaths and/or confirmed cases in a given time frame, it
automatically becomes part of the efficiency frontier in the input oriented DEA version, and
distorts (reduces) the efficiency scores of all the other municipalities. The output oriented
inefficiency frontier is on the other hand formed by municipalities with most confirmed cases
and/or most deaths, and is therefore less affected by the outlier influence of small municipalities.
This is the reason why the 128 very small municipalities with zero reported deaths have been
excluded from the current study, out of the total of 5570.

VRS inefficiency, along the study period. The adopted color coding displays in blue values at or
below the 1st quartile, and red for values at and above the 3rd quartile for the efficiency calculations,
and is inverted for inefficiency: red means “bad practice”, and blue means “not so bad practice”.

While the performance of Brazilian municipalities generally agrees between the two scale variants
of efficiency (Figs. 7a and 7b) with those of inefficiency (Figs. 7c and 7d) frontiers, the emphasis
in the former approach lies on highlighting small cities with few confirmed cases and deaths, and
tends to underrepresent the cities with low efficiency. By comparing the CRS with the VRS
versions (Fig. 7a with Fig. 7b, and Fig. 7c with Fig.7d) it can be concluded that taking into account
scaling effect does not bring about a significant change of the spatial distribution of results,
probably because the choice of input variables already accounts for scale in terms of population
size, for the full study period.
As already mentioned, the efficiency frontier approach is rather sensitive to presence of outliers
(small cities with zero confirmed cases and/or deaths), and it is found that it yields reasonable
results only for the whole period of study, while the time evolution in 30-day windows enhances
the outlier effect. The time evolution study is therefore implemented here only for the inefficiency
frontier, with the results displayed in Figs 8 and 9.

Figure 8. DEA CRS inefficiency, in consecutive 30 day windows.

Figure 9. DEA VRS inefficiency, in consecutive 30 day windows.
Comparing the results for individual months on Figs. 8 and 9 it can be concluded that monthly
cumulative values are not sufficient to account for scale, as the August 2020 peak and the ongoing
peak (at the time of writing this article, March-April 2021) are better emphasized in the scale
sensitive VRS approach. It should be noted here that both CRS and VRS versions demonstrate less
areas in red (high inefficiency) in February 2021 in comparison with January 2021, but from Figs.
5 and 6 it is seen that both the number of deaths and the death rate have increased from January to
February 2021 in the ongoing pandemic peak, while the confirmed cases number has not grown
considerably, as can be seen in Fig. 4. This means that the inefficiency frontier has shifted forward,
to municipalities with an increased number of deaths, but this is observed only in a subset of the
municipalities that were the most inefficient in February 2021. The DEA results presented in Figs.
8 and 9 highlight the inefficiency scores relative to the most inefficient ones in each particular
period of time, those that comprise the inefficiency frontier. Therefore, the authorities of the

municipalities that show as red in February 2021 should be even more concerned than those of the
municipalities shown as red for January, while in March 2021the situation becomes rather
uniformly alerting among most municipalities in Brazil, perhaps less so for the northeast region.

Conclusions
The current study aims to provide a contribution to the assessment of the current observational
data on the COVID-19 virus outbreak in Brazil, from a phenomenological point of view. The
current analysis of the data reveals the spatial distribution of the hotspots in this continental size
country over the entire period of the pandemic, as well as the evolution on monthly scale.
Full-fledged videos corresponding to Figs. 4, 5, 6, 8 and 9, comprised of 384 frames each (for a
total of 413 observation days from February 25, 2020 to April 12,2021, there are 384 distinct 30day overlapping timeframes) are available in the supplementary material [12]. Additional
calculation results (for these, or for different timeframes, in the form of data tables, images and/or
videos) are available from the author upon request, in the hope that such information may subsidize
decision making through comparative analysis of previous practice, and thus contribute to
pandemic mitigation efforts.
