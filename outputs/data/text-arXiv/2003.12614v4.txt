(Dated: January 8, 2021)
In confronting the global spread of the coronavirus disease COVID-19 pandemic we must have
coordinated medical, operational, and political responses. In all efforts, data is crucial. Fundamentally, and in the possible absence of a vaccine for 12 to 18 months, we need universal, well-documented
testing for both the presence of the disease as well as confirmed recovery through serological tests
for antibodies, and we need to track major socioeconomic indices. But we also need auxiliary data
of all kinds, including data related to how populations are talking about the unfolding pandemic
through news and stories. To in part help on the social media side, we curate a set of 2000 day-scale
time series of 1- and 2-grams across 24 languages on Twitter that are most ‘important’ for April
2020 with respect to April 2019. We determine importance through our allotaxonometric instrument, rank-turbulence divergence. We make some basic observations about some of the time series,
including a comparison to numbers of confirmed deaths due to COVID-19 over time. We broadly
observe across all languages a peak for the language-specific word for ‘virus’ in January 2020 followed
by a decline through February and then a surge through March and April. The world’s collective
attention dropped away while the virus spread out from China. We host the time series
on Gitlab, updating them on a daily basis while relevant. Our main intent is for other researchers
to use these time series to enhance whatever analyses that may be of use during the pandemic as
well as for retrospective investigations.

OVERVIEW

Understanding how major disasters affect the wellbeing of populations both in real time and historically is
of paramount importance. We especially need real-time
measurement to enable policy makers in health systems
and government to gauge the immediate situation and
evaluate scenarios, and for researchers to model possible
future trajectories of social systems. Researchers have
demonstrated how characterizing and tracking public discourse of the COVID-19 spread on social media [9–11] can
support local authorities’ efforts in response to the global pandemic [12, 13]. Recent studies have also investigated the impact of pre-existing political polarization on
discussions related to COVID-19 throughout Twitter’s
ecosystem [14], as well as the extent of misinformation on
social media [15–17]. Our primary aim here is to generate a particular data stream that may be of help to other
researchers: A principled set of n-gram time series across
major languages used on Twitter and news-relevant for
April, 2020. Our work is complementary to extant efforts
to enable research on the COVID-19 pandemic [1, 2] by

gathering and sharing epidemiological data [3, 4, 18–23],
economic data, and internet and social media data [5–
8, 24].
In this short piece, we describe how we select languages
and n-grams relevant to the time period of the present
COVID-19 pandemic; show example time series plots for
the word ‘virus’ (and its translations), including a visual comparison with COVID-19 confirmed case and death

numbers; and describe the data sets, figures, and visualizations for 24 languages that we share online.

II.

SELECTION OF LANGUAGES AND
n-GRAMS

We base our curation on our work in two of our previous papers [25, 26], and we draw from a database
of approximately 10% of all tweets from 2008/09/09
to present. Our process of obtaining salient n-grams
for April 2020 comprises two steps. First, we used
the language identification and detection tool FastTextLID [27, 28] to evaluate all tweets in our historical
archive, finding over 100 languages [25]. Besides analyzing all tweets (AT), we also separately process what we
call organic tweets (OT): All Twitter messages which are
original. Organic tweets exclude retweets while including all added text for quote tweets. In doing so, we are
able to carry through a measure of spreadability for all
n-grams. The key threshold we use for spreading is the
naive one from biological and social contagion models:
When an n-gram appears in more retweeted than organic material, we view it as being socially amplified. We
subsequently extracted day-scale Zipf distributions for
1-, 2-, and 3-grams along with day-scale n-gram time
series [29]. We preserve case where applicable, do not
apply any stemming. We note that the top 10 languages
on Twitter comprise 85% of all tweets. Here, we take
24 of the most commonly used languages on Twitter
in 2019, with the provision that we are able to parse
them into n-grams. For the time being, we are unable
to reliably parse continuous-based script languages such
as Japanese, Thai, and Chinese, the 2nd, 6th, and 13th
most common languages. The selected languages comprise two thirds of the daily tweets on the platform. We
exclude all tweets not assigned a language with sufficient
confidence (an effective 4th ranked collection). In other
words, we select the predicted language with the highest
confidence score. If the confidence score of our FastTextLID model is less than 25% for a given tweet, then we
label that tweet as Undefined (und). We also choose
to include Ukranian (29th) over Cebuano (28th) due to
a marginal degree of uncertainty for detecting messages
written in Cebuano [25]. We list the 24 languages by
overall usage frequency in Tab. I.
Second, we compare usage of n-grams in April of 2020
with April 2019 to determine which n-grams have become
most elevated in relative usage. We do so by using rankturbulence divergence [26], an instrument for comparing any pair of heavy-tailed size distributions of categorical data. Other well-considered divergences will produce similar lists. For each language, we take Zipf distributions for each day of April 2020, and compare them
with the Zipf distributions of 52 weeks earlier. For an
example, we show in Fig. 1 an allotaxonograph for Italian comparing 2019/04/30 and 2020/04/30. The main
plot displays a rotated 2D-histogram to avoid misinter-

pretation of causality. We bin n-grams logarithmically
such that bins located near the center vertical line indicate n-grams that are used equivalently on both days,
whereas bins on either side highlight n-grams that are
used more often on the corresponding date. We use rankturbulence divergence with the parameter α set to 1/3 as
this provides a reasonable fit to the lexical turbulence we
observe [26, 30]. Up to a normalization factor [26], we
compute rank-turbulence divergence for each n-gram τ
as follows:
R
δDα,τ
∝

1
α
rτ,t
1

−

1
α
rτ,t
2

1/(α+1)

=

1
1/3

rτ,t1

−

1
1/3

3/4

,

rτ,t2

where rτ,t1 and rτ,t2 indicate the rank of usage for τ at
time step t1 and t2 respectively. We plot contour lines to
demonstrate the scale of rank-turbulence divergence and
use divergence contributions of each n-gram to compile
an ordered set of relevant n-grams for each day (see right
panel of Fig. 1). For ease of plotting, we have further
chosen to compare the subset of words containing Latin
characters only. Words associated with the pandemic
dominate the contributions from 2020/04/30. On the
right side of the allotaxonograph, we see ‘Coronavirus’,
‘virus’, ‘quarantina’, ‘pandemia’, ‘Bergamo’, and ‘morti’.
We repeat this process for every day in April, and combine divergence contributions for all n-grams across these
days, and rank n-grams in descending order indicating
the most narratively dominate n-grams for the month of
April.

III.

DATA, VISUALIZATIONS, AND SITES

For each language, and for each of the top n-grams
we have identified, we extract three day-scale time series
starting on 2019/09/01: Daily counts, ranks, and normalized frequencies based on the Eastern Time Zone (ET).
Understandably, as the pandemic was unfolding in early
2020, most regional health organizations could not confirm the roots or exact initial date of the first COVID-19
case within their population of charge, with speculations
that the virus may have started spreading in late 2019.
Therefore, we started our data collection on September
of 2019 to cover the last quarter of 2019 and the few
months leading to the pandemic spreading worldwide.
The degree to which the pandemic is being discussed
on Twitter is of great interest in itself, and our data set
will allow for such examination.
For the n-grams our method surfaces, we observe variations in punctuation and grammatical structures. These
variants as well as non-pandemic-related elements may
be filtered out for individual languages by hand as may
suit interested researchers. We provide a cleaned version
of the data set whereby we omit links, handles, hashtags,
emojis, and punctuation. We also note that our decision to respect capitalization leads to n-grams that some
researchers may wish to collapse, and we also provide a

FIG. 1. Allotaxonograph using rank-turbulence divergence for Italian word usage on April 30, 2019 versus April 30, 2020.
For this visualization, we consider the subset of 1-grams that are formed from latin characters. The right hand sides of the
rank-rank histogram and the rank-turbulence contribution list are dominated by COVID-19 related terms. See Dodds et al. [26]
for a full explanation of our allotaxonometric instrument.

case-insensitive version of our data set. We repeat all of
the above steps for n-grams derived from organic tweets
(OT).
We share and maintain all data on Gitlab at:
https://gitlab.com/compstorylab/covid19ngrams.
We
also provide a connected website associated with our
paper at: http://compstorylab.org/covid19ngrams/. We
show tables of the leading n-grams in our data set, as well
as example ”bar chart races” for the dominant COVID19 n-grams in major languages. Our intention is to automatically update the data set on Gitlab, as soon as we
have processed all tweets for a day.
We show the resulting top 20 April-2020-specific 1grams for the 24 languages in Tabs. II and III. For display,
we use the cleaned version, omitting hashtags, handles,
emojis, numbers, and punctuation. We also removed all
variations of ‘Bomboclaat’ from Dutch. Overall, we see
that the lists are dominated by language specific words
for coronavirus virus, quarantine, pandemic, testing, and
spreading.
In the full, unfiltered data set, some 1-grams such as
punctuation represent functional changes in the use of

Twitter across languages. The white heart emoji makes
the top 20 in a few languages such as English, Arabic,
Korean and German. By contrast, and according to the
measurements we have used here, the worried face emoji,
, has become important across many languages in April
2020 relative to April 2019. It would be natural to see
this emoji as being pandemic-related but in fact, we see
from time series that the worried emoji has slowly being
increasing in usage over time for several years (determining the reasons for which we will leave for a separate line
of inquiry). All 1-grams are included in the shared raw
version of the data sets.
We emphasize that with our approach, we do not
explicitly determine whether or not an n-gram is relevant to COVID-19. While the pandemic was one of the
top stories of 2020 for the majority of countries, there
have of course been other major events and moments
in popular culture around the world. For example, in
March 2020 for the United States, the democratic primary leads to the 1-gram in English Twitter of ‘Biden’
being prominent. Similarly, we see many n-grams related
to the Big Brother Brazil show in Portuguese, and K-pop

Our intent is to capture 1-grams that are topically and culturally important during the COVID-19 pandemic. While overall, we
see pandemic-related words dominate the lists across languages, we also find considerable specific variation. Words for virus,
quarantine, protective equipment, and testing show different orderings (note that we do not employ stemming). Unrelated
1-grams but important to the time of April 2020 are in evidence; the balance of these are important for our understanding of
how much the pandemic is being talked about. To generate these lists we use the allotaxonometric method of rank-turbulence
divergence to find the most distinguishing 1-grams (see Sec. II, Fig. 1, and Dodds et al. [26]). We note that these tables are
images and cannot be copied; see the Sec. III for data download sites.

in Korean. Further, most languages have a strong degree
of geographic specificity (e.g., Finnish for Finland, Portuguese for Brazil), and we have not filtered for precise
geo-location. English, Spanish, Arabic, and French are
some of the more geographically distributed languages.

IV.

EXAMPLE TIME SERIES

We briefly consider two sets of sample time series based
on our data set. Across Figs. 2 and 3, we plot contagiograms [29] for the word ‘virus’ translated as appropriate in to each of the 24 languages. For each language,
we display the daily (Zipfian) rank for ‘virus’ in the main
panel of each plot. We add a grey background indicating the best and worst rank of each week overlaid by a
centered weekly rolling average (black). The pale disk
highlights the date of maximum observed rate. In the
secondary time series at the top of each panel, we show
the relative fraction of 1-gram contained in retweets (RT)
versus organic tweets (OT). When the RT/OT balance
exceeds 50%, we shade the background to indicate that
the 1-gram is being spread (e.g., retweeted) more than
organically tweeted. For each contagiogram, we also display a heatmap of the relative amplification of each 1gram compared to the fraction of 1-grams that are found
in RTs on that day. For each day of the week, shades
of red indicate higher social amplification, whereas gray
shows that the volume of that 1-gram is often shared
organically. See Alshaabi et al. [29] for technical details
of contagiograms, more examples of contagiograms can
also be found in Figs. A1, and A2.
Alone, the highest ranks for ‘virus’ show the
enormity of the pandemic. While a common
enough word in normal times, ‘virus’ has reached
into the top 100 ranks across many languages, a
region that we have elsewhere referred to as the
realm of lexical ultrafame [31]. Normally only the
most basic function words of a language will populate the top 100 ranks.
In the last few months,
we have seen ‘virus’ rise as high as r=24 in Indonesian (2020/01/26), r=27 in Polish (2020/03/11), r=29 in
Urdu (2020/03/22), r=44 in German (2020/03/14), and
r=83 in English (2020/03/13). In terms of the shapes
of the time series for ‘virus’, most languages show a late
January peak consistent with the news from China of
a novel coronavirus disease spreading in Wuhan. The
subsequent drop in usage rate across most of the 24 languages reflects a global decline in attention being paid to
the outbreak. The Italian time series for ‘virus’ in Fig. 2J
shows an abrupt jump about three quarters of the way
through February, strikingly just after a drop in RT/OT
balance. Persian has a similar shock jump just after midway of February (Fig. 2B). We see in Fig 3E that ‘virus’
in Catalan shows no early January peak like most of the
other 23 languages, suggesting that even the initial news
from China did not have great impact.
One of the major problems we face with the COVID-19

pandemic is the unevenness of testing across the world.
South Korea and Iceland have tested early and extensively while the United States’s testing has been uncoordinated and slow to expand. Urdu’s heightened time
series for ‘virus’ (Fig 3C) would seem especially concerning given low numbers coming out of Pakistan which, as
of 2020/03/24, had reported 1,063 cases and 8 deaths [3].
For Indonesia, where testing has also been limited [3] and
with peak attention on Twitter coming in January and
early focus on economic issues and evacuation of nationals from Wuhan, a dip in the rank of ‘virus’ in the second
half of February is also worrying (Fig 2G).
Countries around the world have adopted different
strategies and policies in response to the coronavirus pandemic. While most languages have COVID-19 related
terms across the top n-grams, some languages also have
terms related to other big events happening simultaneously. For example, we see many n-grams discussing the
democratic primary election in the US. We also find ngrams connected to the Big Brother Brazil show in Portuguese, while Korean has many K-pop references. This
in part shows that the collective attention of different
populations will, indeed, vary depending on the spread
of the virus across countries all over the globe for the
time period considered in this study. We note, however,
that n-grams related to the pandemic can still be found
in Portuguese showing the initial response to the news
about the COVID-19 outbreak as the virus started slowly spreading in Brazil.
As one very simple example of comparing our Twitter times series with pandemic-related data, in Fig. 4,
we present plots of daily reported cases and deaths
over time for 12 countries, along with time series for
10 salient 1-grams in the top spoken language for each
country. We note that the reported number of cases
and deaths are subject to under-reportings. For each
country, we use the left vertical axis to plot a weekly
rolling average of usage ranks at the day scale for 10
1-grams (gray lines) translated in the top spoken language for each country, while the black solid line shows
an average of all these 1-grams. We selected 10 1-grams
from the top of each list that are directly related to the
coronavirus pandemic to highlight the collective attention around the COVID-19 outbreak. The set of 1grams we use for each language can be found online
at: https://gitlab.com/compstorylab/covid19ngrams//blob/master/src/consts.py. Using the right vertical
axis, we display a weekly rolling average of daily new
cases (red solid-line), and reported new deaths (orange
dashed-line).
We see a global surge of attention on Twitter starting mid March through April following the state-wide
lockdowns in most countries. Some languages such as
Italian and German display a fairly steady level of attention paid to the pandemic. However, the average rank of
usage of the selected 1-grams slows down and starts to
decay across many languages in April through the summer. In fact, the average rank of usage have dropped

FIG. 2. Contagiograms for the word ‘virus’ in the top 12 of the 24 languages we study here. The major observation is that
the world’s attention peaked early in late January around the news of an outbreak of a new infectious disease
in Wuhan, declining through well into February before waking back up. The main plots in each panel show usage
ranks at the day scale (ET). The solid lines indicating smoothing with a one week average (centered). The plots along the top
of each panel show the relative fractions of each 1-gram’s daily counts indicating as to whether they appear in retweets (RT,
spreading) or organic tweets (OT, new material). The background shading shows when the balance favors spreading—story
contagion. See Fig. 3 for the next 12 languages, as well as Sec. IV for general discussion, and Alshaabi et al. [29] for technical
details of contagiograms.

of these 1-grams are socially amplified over time, while others often shared organically.

FIG. 4. Time series for daily reported case loads and death compared with a list of 10 salient 1-grams for the top language
spoken in each country. For each n-gram, we display a weekly rolling average of usage ranks at the day scale in gray overlaid by
an average of all these 1-grams in black marking their corresponding ranks using the left vertical axis. Similarly, we use the right
vertical axis to display a weekly rolling average of daily new cases (red solid-line), and reported new deaths (orange dashed-line).
We note that the reported counts are underestimates, more so for cases than deaths, and errors are unknown. We sourced
data for confirmed cases and fatalities from Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering’s COVID-19
project [3]. Starting on 2020/01/22, the project’s data has been collected from national and regional health authorities across
the world. The data is augmented by case reports from medical associations and social media posts—these later sources are
validated against official records before publication. For the present piece, we use daily summary files for case counts and
fatalities, although an API and online dashboard are available for more up-to-date reports.

an order of magnitude in Indian, Russian, Korean, and
Swedish. While the number of new daily cases and deaths
are climbing up again, we do not observe the same level
of attention reciprocated on Twitter.

CONCLUDING REMARKS

We echo our main general observation of how COVID19 has been discussed through late April 2020: After
reacting strongly in late January to the news
that a coronavirus-based disease was spreading
in China, attention across all but 2 of the 24
languages we survey dropped through February
before resurging in late February and through
March. We see abrupt shocks in time series as populations shifted rapidly to heightened levels of awareness, particularly in the Italian time series. In the time
series for ‘virus’, we see two and sometimes three peaks
of attention in the space of just a few months. Our hope
is that our collection of Twitter n-gram time series that
are especially relevant to April 2020 will be of benefit to
other researchers. The time series we share will, in part,
reflect many other aspects beyond mentions of ‘virus’,
which we have only briefly explored here.
Possible
topics to investigate include washing (including
the soap and microbe emojis), testing, serology,
vaccine, masks and protection equipment, social
and physical distancing, terms of community support versus loneliness and isolation, closures of
schools and universities, economic problems, job

loss, and food concerns.
We repeat that the lists we provide are meant to represent the important n-grams of April 2020, and we urge
a degree of caution in the use of the data set. As we have
indicated above, our lists of n-grams contain some peculiarities that will not be directly relevant to COVID-19.
Entertainment (e.g., movies, celebrities, and K-pop) and
sports (football along with sports in the United States)
are standard fare on Twitter when no major events are
taking place in the world. The extent to which these
aspects of Twitter are submerged as pandemic related
n-grams rise is of interest.
Finally, while we have been able to identify languages
well, geolocation is coarse and at best will be at the level
of countries. The strength of geolocation for our time
series will depend on the degree of localization of a given
language as well as Twitter user demographics. We leave
producing n-grams with serviceable physical location as
a separate project.
