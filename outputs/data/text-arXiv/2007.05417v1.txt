Abstract
Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, almost all non-essential activities in Morocco have been halted
since March 15, 2020. In this sense, several measures have been taken to mitigate the effects of
this pandemic. Morocco has been on lockdown since March 20, 2020. The main objective of this
paper is to study the effects of the lockdown measures on air quality, by presenting the spatiotemporal evolution of PM2,5 and NO2 pollutants, based on satellite data from Sentinel 5P and
MERRA. Then, these results are compared to the data predicted by the Copernicus Atmosphere
Monitoring Service (CAMS). Results show that, on one hand, Morocco has experienced an
improvement in air quality by a significant reduction in NO2 and a relative reduction in PM2,5. On
the other hand, we demonstrate that the particulate pollution in Morocco is partly due to synoptic
weather patterns, and that a significant part of NO2 emissions is incoming mainly from the
outside northern borders of Morocco. Finally we show that PM2.5 CAMS global forecasts
underestimate the observed MERRA data.

1. Introduction

The new SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus was first discovered in China at its epicenter Wuhan. On
March 02, 2020, Morocco announced the first confirmed case of Covid-19. Since that day, to limit
the spread of this pandemic, Moroccan authorities have taken several measures and proactive
decisions. On March 11, 2020, Morocco created an Economic Vigilance Committee and then
informed the public by all possible media about the preventive measures to limit the spread of the
virus. The declaration of "state of health emergency" was announced for the first time on March
20, 2020, for a period of one month, and then it was extended three times until July 10, 2020.

The main objective of the present paper is to study the effects of Covid-19 induced lockdown on
air quality by presenting the spatio-temporal evolution of PM2,5 and NO2 pollutants as indicators
of air quality, using data from MERRA-2 and the sentinel 5P satellites. Then, these results were
compared to data predicted by the CAMS global forecasts data.

This paper is structured as follows. Section 2 present the international and national experiences of
covid-19 lockdown and air pollution, section 3 describes the data used, the period, and the study
area. In section 4, we present the results of the spatio-temporal evolution of PM2.5 and NO2
concentrations as well as the comparison of MERRA PM2.5 data and that predicted by CAMS
global forecasts. In section 5, we present the conclusion and the recommendations of the authors.

2. Covid-19 pandemic and air pollution

Since the declaration of the Covid-19 epidemic as a Public health emergency of international
concern by the World Health Organization (WHO) (Sohrabi et al., 2020) several countries have
implemented flight restrictions and preventive measures(Anderson et al., 2020). Morocco took
the initiative to control citizens from countries affected by Covid-19 and then suspended the
majority of industrial and commercial activities. In addition, the transportation and movement of
citizens were limited only to necessary needs of work, medical consultations and purchases of
food needs, or other compulsory necessities. In the same way, all social activities that result in
mass gathering such as ceremonies, educational establishments, religious festivals, sports
competitions were prohibited (P, 2020).

At the international level, thanks to the reduction in activities (traffic and industrial activities)
during the Covid-19 lockdown, several studies have reported a reduction in air pollution. Starting
with China, in Wuhan (Isaifan, 2020) and in 44 cities in northern China, both studies recorded an
improvement in the air quality index (Baldasano, 2020). Similar results have been reported in
Italy, France, Spain, Germany, Bangladeshl and the USA (LARNAUD, 2020; Adoo-kissi-debrah,
2020; Baldasano, 2020;Ogen, 2020 ;Roy et al., 2020; Berman and Ebisu, 2020). This was also
observed in the most polluted cities in the world, notably Bangalore, Beijing , Bangkok, Delhi
and Nanjing, as well as in the main shopping centers of the world, notably New York, London,
Paris, Seoul, Sydney and Tokyo (Sharma et al., 2020).

Another study compared the state of air quality before the crisis with the current situation
showing that blocking forced and industrial activities of Covid-19 may have saved more lives by
3

preventing ambient air pollution than by preventing infection. On the one hand, in 2016, at the
global level, the death rate caused by ambient air pollution contributed to 7.6% of all deaths, on
the other hand the death rate from this infection did not exceed 3, 4% worldwide (Isaifan, 2020).

At the national level, a study carried out during this pandemic estimated that the concentrations
of PM10, SO2 and NO2 will continue to decrease and remain at a minimum level during the
lockdown period and they concluded that the reduction in the concentrations of these pollutants can be
mainly attributed to drastic measures limiting human movement and industrial activities (Otmani et al.,

2020).

On the other hand, In China, a study has shown that serious episodes of air pollution are not
avoided by reducing activities (traffic and industrial activities) during Covid-19, especially when
the weather is unfavorable (Wang et al., 2020). More we must know the sustainability of the
benefits of reducing air pollution thanks to Covid-19 by looking at the situation after the crisis of
this pandemic (Isaifan, 2020).

3. Data and methods

3.1. Sentinel 5P
Sentinel 5p is the first Copernicus mission satellite devoted to monitoring the atmosphere, it was
launched on October 13, 2017 (Shikwambana et al., 2020). For this paper, the TROPOMI Offline
of daily NO2 concentration in the processing level 2 datasets were used for the period from
January 22, 2020 to April 22, 2020 for the Moroccan area and its surroundings.

4

Several studies have used the sentinel 5P source for the observation of NO2 during the period of
the Covid-19 pandemic, for example in South Africa (Shikwambana et al., 2020) and in 66
administrative regions of Italy, Spain, France and Germany (Ogen, 2020).
3.2. Modern-era retrospective analysis for research and applications version 2
(MERRA-2)

MERRA-2 provides atmospheric data dating back from 1980 to date. It is the first long-term
global reanalysis to assimilate space-based observations of aerosols and represent their
interactions with other physical processes in the climate system (Pawson, 2019). The MERRA-2
is a National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) atmospheric reanalysis for the
satellite era using the Goddard Earth Observing System Model, Version 5 (GEOS-5) with its
Atmospheric Data Assimilation System (ADAS), version 5.12.4 (Gelaro et al., 2017).

The MERRA-2 data used in this paper relates to particulate matter less than 2,5 µm from
February 20, 2020 to April 20, 2020 in Morocco with a Spatial resolution of 0.5 x 0.625 °.

The choice of monitoring PM 2.5 concentrations in this study is based on its environmental and
especially health impact, and on the study which indicates that long-term exposure to this
pollutant may be one of the most important contributors to the deaths exacerbated by the Covid19

virus and possibly worldwide (Xiao Wu et al., 2020).

3.3. Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) global forecasts

5

CAMS which is implemented by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather
Forecasts (ECMWF), is a component of the European Earth Observation programme Copernicus.
CAMS global near-real time (NRT) service provides daily analyses and forecasts of reactive trace
gases, greenhouse gases and aerosol concentrations (ECMWF COPERNICUS, 2012). The
predicted data used in this study concern the PM2,5 concentration at the surface level.

3.4. ERA5

ERA5 provides hourly estimates of a large number of atmospheric, land and oceanic climate
variables. It includes information about uncertainties for all variables at reduced spatial and
temporal resolutions. The data cover the Earth on a 30km grid and resolve the atmosphere using
137 levels from the surface up to a height of 80km (ECMWF COPERNICUS, n.d.).

ERA5 data was used to acquire the mean sea level pressure on March 20, 2020.

4. Results and discussion

4.1. Spatio-temporal evolution of PM2,5 and NO2

In this part, we have chosen the presentation of the spatio-temporal evolution of two pollutants
indicative of air quality which are PM2,5 and NO2. This presentation runs from a period before the
appearance of the first confirmed case of Covid-19 in Morocco (from January for PM2.5 and
February for NO2) until April 2020.

6

4.1.1. PM2,5

Regarding PM2.5, the data used come from the MERRA-2 project and the duration of the study
extends from February 20 to April 20, 2020. Figure 1 clearly shows that we have a flow of
particles from the south and south-eastern of Morocco.
In general, the maps show a relative decrease in PM2.5 concentrations thanks to the reduction of
industrial activities and transport during the lockdown period in Morocco.

4.1.2. NO2

7

For nitrogen dioxide, we used Sentinel 5P data. Figure 2 illustrates the spatio-temporal evolution
of the NO2 concentration from January 22 to April 22, 2020. These maps show a significant
decrease in NO2 concentrations and give a vision of the contribution of emissions from the
external borders of northern Morocco, Which confirms the study highlighting the predominant
influence of transboundary pollution on the air quality of the northern cities of
Morocco (Benchrif et al., 2018).

4.2. Comparison of observed and predicted data

Figure 3 shows the concentrations of PM2.5 forecasts data from CAMS during the lockdown
period. The difference between the map of February 20, 2020 and that of April 20, 2020 shows a
decrease in the concentration of PM2.5. However the map of March 20, 2020 shows a situation of

8

stagnation of dust because of the high pressure in the north of morocco which is illustrated in
figure 4.

We conclude from the comparison of data predicted by CAMS (Figure 3) and that observed by
MERRA (Figure 1), that the data predicted underestimates the observed MERRA data.

4.3. Improvement in air quality during the Covid-19 lockdown

The results of this study showed a significant reduction in air pollution, which remains relative to
the state of each city. This result goes in the same direction with the study concluded that the
reduction of air pollution in Morocco is relative for each city according to the sources of emission,
and therefore it is necessary to study each city in isolation in order to improve air quality
(Croitoru and Sarraf, 2017).

On the other hand, this improvement in air quality remains to be seen if the lockout is extended.
However, these reductions are expected to be temporary as levels should rise once the situation
returns to normal(Sharma et al., 2020).

5. Conclusion

In conclusion, in Morocco, the Covid-19 lockdown has a positive effect on air quality. The
reduction in PM2.5 and NO2 concentrations during the lockdown period can be mainly attributed
to measures taken by the Moroccan state by limiting human activities, namely transport and
10

industrial activities. This could be a lesson in order to strengthen national and international
environmental strategies and adopt new attitudes.

The authors show that the particulate pollution in Morocco is partly due to the synoptic weather
factors, and that a significant part of the NO2 emissions is mainly incoming from the northern
borders of Morocco. The authors also showed that the PM2.5 concentration predicted by CAMS
underestimates that observed by MERRA.

In order to remedy this situation and improve air quality, the authors recommend on the one
hand, the establishment of a remote work integration plan in the private sector and the state to
minimize transportation, the encouragement of the use of electronic vehicles, and the
enhancement and encouragement of the use of adequate public transport. On the other hand, the
encouragement of companies to convert their work remotely as possible, also the increase of the
number of event days (day without car, bike day, ...) must be taken into account as well as more
funds should be provided to scientific research, specifically that related to air quality.
