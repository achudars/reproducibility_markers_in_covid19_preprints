In severe viral pneumonia, including Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the viral replication
phase is often followed by hyperinflammation, which can lead to acute respiratory distress
syndrome, multi-organ failure, and death. We previously demonstrated that alpha-1 adrenergic
receptor (⍺1-AR) antagonists can prevent hyperinflammation (cytokine storm syndrome) in mice.
Here, we conducted retrospective analyses in two cohorts of patients with acute respiratory
distress (ARD, n=18,547) and three cohorts with pneumonia (n=400,907). Federated across two
ARD cohorts, we find that patients exposed to ⍺1-AR antagonists, as compared to unexposed
patients, had a 34% relative risk reduction for mechanical ventilation and death (OR=0.70,
p=0.021). We replicated these methods on three pneumonia cohorts, all with similar effects on
both outcomes. All results were robust to sensitivity analyses. These results highlight the urgent
need for prospective trials testing whether prophylactic use of ⍺1-AR antagonists ameliorates
lower respiratory tract infection-associated cytokine storm syndrome, as observed in COVID-19.

1. Introduction
Each year, approximately 300 million people develop pneumonia [1], which usually results in
appropriate, self-limiting immune responses and clearance of the bacterial or viral pathogen. In
some cases (Figure 1), the pathogen overwhelms host defenses, causing massive lung damage
and compromising other organs. In other patients, however, pathological immune activation
(‘hyperinflammation') occurs in the lungs and systemically [2], resulting in immune-mediated endorgan damage that can compromise gas exchange. Dysregulated immune responses may lead
to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), need for mechanical ventilation, and failure of
other organ systems, contributing to the global pneumonia death toll of 3 million per year [3]. The
clinical picture is similar in Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2;
hyperinflammation compromises organ function in the lungs and systemically, causing high
morbidity and mortality [4–7].

Figure 1. Model of clinical progression of respiratory dysfunction from local infection to systemic hyperinflammation
(“cytokine storm”). The timing and relation of hyperinflammation to specific organ manifestations of severe acute
respiratory distress syndrome are areas of uncertainty and investigation.

Disease-modifying strategies for COVID-19 include targeting the virus and treating (or ideally
preventing) secondary hyperinflammation with immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive drugs.
Here, we propose an approach using the latter strategy of hyperinflammation prevention [8,9].
Immune cells communicate with each other by secreting peptides called cytokines and
chemokines, which initially amplify the response and later restore homeostasis after the threat
has receded. However, in hyperinflammation, production of cytokines is dysregulated, forming a
‘cytokine storm’ that can damage healthy tissue and overwhelm the host.
Cytokine storm syndrome (CSS) in COVID-19 is characterized by profound elevation of many
pro-inflammatory cytokines [5,7,10–13]. Several immunosuppressive treatment approaches have
been proposed to ameliorate CSS in patients who have already developed severe complications
of COVID-19, including blocking specific cytokine signaling axes (e.g., IL-6, IL-1, or TNF-alpha)
and broader immunosuppressive approaches (e.g., dexamethasone) [14–16]. IL-6 levels predict
COVID-19 severity and in-hospital mortality [4,13,17], and monoclonal antibodies against IL-6

2

and its receptor are being investigated in clinical trials for COVID-19 (https://www.covidtrials.org/). However, the utility of these approaches is likely to be restricted by their prohibitive
costs (e.g., biologics) and the risks of suppressing beneficial antiviral host responses.
Dexamethasone has shown a mortality benefit in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who require
oxygen or mechanical ventilation, but glucocorticoids may not be beneficial - and may even be
harmful - when given earlier in the disease course [18,19].
Another potential target for preventing hyperinflammation is the catecholamine pathway, which
beyond its role in neurotransmission and endocrine signaling, is involved in immunomodulation
of innate and adaptive immune cells. In mice, catecholamine release coincides with
hyperinflammation and enhances inflammatory injury by augmenting cytokine production via a
self-amplifying process that requires alpha-1 adrenergic receptor (⍺1-AR) signaling [20].
Catecholamine synthesis inhibition reduces cytokine responses and dramatically increases
survival after inflammatory stimuli. The ⍺1-AR antagonist prazosin (at clinically prescribed
dosages)—but not beta-adrenergic receptor (β-AR) antagonists—offers similar protection,
providing in vivo evidence that this drug class can prevent CSS [20]. These preclinical findings
provide a rationale for clinical studies that assess whether ⍺1-AR antagonists can prevent
hyperinflammation and its sequelae associated with severe infection.
To date, no controlled trials have studied whether ⍺1-AR antagonism improves clinical outcomes
in patients with lower respiratory tract infection (pneumonia, acute respiratory distress
(syndrome), or COVID-19). Replicated retrospective cohort studies offer the highest level of
evidence prior to prospective studies [21]. We thus conducted a series of five retrospective cohort
studies, spanning different populations, age groups, demographics, and countries.
Our primary research question is whether ⍺1-AR antagonists can mitigate disease and prevent
mortality through modulation of hyperinflammation. We operationalized this research question by
testing the statistical hypothesis that patients exposed to ⍺1-AR antagonists, as compared to
unexposed patients, have a reduced risk of adverse outcomes in lower respiratory tract infection.
We considered two outcomes (mechanical ventilation, and mechanical ventilation followed by
death), and three exposures (any ⍺1-AR antagonist, tamsulosin specifically, and doxazosin
specifically). Tamsulosin is the most commonly used ⍺1-AR antagonist in the United States and
demonstrates a ‘uroselective’ binding pattern (predominantly inhibits ⍺1A- and ⍺1D-AR subtypes).
In contrast, doxazosin is a non-selective ⍺1-AR antagonist that demonstrates clinically significant
inhibition of all three known ⍺1-AR subtypes, including antagonism on the ⍺1B-AR. This
antagonism of ⍺1B-AR expressed in the peripheral vasculature is thought to mediate the
antihypertensive effects of doxazosin and related drugs. Importantly, all three ⍺1-AR subtypes
have been implicated in catecholamine signaling on immune cells, and signaling redundancy
suggests a theoretical benefit for pan-⍺1-AR antagonists (e.g., doxazosin) in preventing

3

catecholamine signaling and hyperinflammation. Relatively few patients in our samples are
prescribed doxazosin, so we are only able to study this drug in our much larger pneumonia cohorts
(since there is insufficient statistical power to analyze the drug in ARD cohorts).
2. Results
The statistical analysis plan described in Materials and Methods was fixed across all cohorts (to
the extent possible) to limit researcher degrees of freedom and to emulate a prospective trial [22].
We computed the probabilities of outcomes, relative risk reductions (RRR), odds ratios (OR),
confidence intervals (CI), and p-values (p) using an unadjusted model as well as adjusted and
matched modeling approaches that account for demographic and health-related confounders. We
focus our discussion of reported results on the adjusted model comparing patients exposed to ⍺1AR antagonists to unexposed patients. The adjusted model is an inverse propensity-weighted
regression on a reduced sample satisfying propensity overlap; see Materials and Methods for
details.
2.1 Participants
We studied two cohorts of patients who were diagnostically coded with acute respiratory distress
(ARD, a surrogate precursor state to ARDS) from two de-identified databases: the IBM®
MarketScan® Research Database (which we refer to as MarketScan) and Optum’s
Clinformatics® Data Mart Database (OptumInsight, Eden Prairie, MN), a commercial and
Medicare Advantage claims database (which we refer to as Optum). We further studied three
cohorts of patients with pneumonia from the MarketScan, Optum, and Swedish National Patient
Register [23] databases. ICD codes were used to identify the first instance of inpatient admission
for each patient in each cohort (see Materials and Methods for details). Our main analysis
employed federated analyses on the ARD cohort using pooled MarketScan and Optum results.
We limit the study to older men because of the widespread use in the United States of ⍺1-AR
antagonists as a treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), a diagnosis clinically unrelated
to the respiratory system or immune disorders. Focusing on men over the age of 45 facilitated
examining a patient population in which a large portion of the exposed group faced similar risks
of poor outcomes from respiratory conditions as the unexposed group, thus mitigating
confounding by indication.
We allowed a maximum age of 85 years to reflect the ongoing clinical trials investigating these
interventions [24]. Figure 2 shows the CONSORT flow diagram for selecting patients from the four
claims datasets (with slight modifications in the Swedish National Patient Register analysis to
reflect different practices in that population); see Materials and Methods for details. Focusing this
study exclusively on older men limits the study’s internal validity to older men, and it would take

4

additional assumptions to justify external validity claims including excluded demographic groups
(e.g., women and younger patients). We nevertheless note that there is an important literature on
demographic fairness with regard to clinical studies [25,26].

Figure 2. CONSORT flow diagram for four claims datasets where M represents MarketScan and O represents Optum.
Note that patients are considered exposed to ⍺1-AR antagonists if they have a medication possession ratio ≥ 50% in

5

the prior year, and are considered unexposed if they have not taken any amount of ⍺1-AR antagonists in the prior year.
ARD inpatient visits are not considered between 2017-2018 as ARD ICD-9 codes were being phased out while ICD-10
codes for ARD were not yet commonly used.

2.2 Cohort-Specific Results
We conducted the same statistical analysis in each of the five cohorts. In each cohort, we
measured incidence and odds ratios (OR) for patients exposed to any ⍺1-AR antagonist, or
tamsulosin specifically, as compared to unexposed patients, for each outcome. In the two largest
pneumonia cohorts, we additionally consider doxazosin exposure. Our main analysis, described
in the following section, involves pooling the results from individual cohorts. For the sake of
completion, Supplementary Figures 6-10 show results for each of the five individual cohorts. We
generally found a positive RRR given any combination of exposure and outcome, and found that
the adjusted model yielded ORs consistently less than 1. In all cohorts, the OR point estimates
were robust to model changes, including other doubly robust approaches [27] such as causal
forests [28], each of which yielded similar results to those presented here.
2.3 Federated Results
We employed federated causal methods to enable combining patient-level results while
maintaining patient privacy and data usage agreement constraints; see Materials and Methods
for details. We pooled results across MarketScan and Optum for each of the ARD and pneumonia
cohorts (the Swedish dataset used a different outcome because ventilation was not reliably
coded, so we did not pool these results). For ARD patients (n=18,547) exposed to any ⍺1-AR
antagonist, as compared to unexposed ARD patients, we found for ventilation and death: RRR =
34%, OR = 0.70, 95% CI (0.49-0.99), p = 0.021; for PNA patients (n=338,674) we found: RRR =
8%, OR = 0.86, 95% CI (0.82-0.91), p < 0.001 (Figure 3). The treatment effect was similar across
the outcome of ventilation only, exposure to tamsulosin only, and other analysis methods
(unadjusted and matched), with ORs consistently less than 1. Doxazosin, a non-selective ⍺1-AR
antagonist hypothesized to have a greater efficacy than other ⍺1-AR antagonists, demonstrated
a two-fold stronger effect than tamsulosin, which blocks fewer ⍺1-adrenoreceptors.

pneumonia in bottom row) were pooled using federated causal learning techniques described in Materials and Methods.
In each quadrant, we show: (left) plotted odds ratios (OR) with confidence intervals (CI), and (right) values for relative
risk reductions (RRR), OR, CI, p-values (p), and sample sizes (n) for unadjusted, adjusted, and matched models,
including any ⍺1-AR antagonists or specifically tamsulosin or doxazosin. We only study exposure to doxazosin in the
pneumonia cohorts since there is insufficient statistical power to analyze the drug in ARD cohorts. Results are shown
for outcomes of mechanical ventilation (left column) and mechanical ventilation leading to death (right column). In
general, ⍺1-AR antagonists were associated with reducing risk of adverse events across exposures, outcomes, and
modeling approaches. Each federated analysis yielded an OR point estimate below 1.

3. Discussion
The results of this retrospective clinical study extend preclinical findings to support the hypothesis
that ⍺1-AR antagonists may reduce morbidity and mortality in patients at risk of hyperinflammation
[16]. A challenge resolved by our retrospective analysis is that patients exposed to ⍺1-AR
antagonists may differ from unexposed patients in ways that might also affect their outcomes from
respiratory diseases. Individuals are often prescribed ⍺1-AR antagonists for chronic problems,
and we consider only patients who used the medications for at least six months in the year prior
(i.e., for a medical possession ratio of at least 50%) to the index hospital admission for pneumonia
or ARDS where we measure patient outcomes. This makes it less likely that the unmeasured
severity of respiratory illness at time of admission for our patient population differs substantially
between exposed and unexposed groups; however, we cannot rule out such differences. We refer
to confounders as factors that vary between patients exposed and unexposed to ⍺1-AR
antagonists and also relate to patient outcomes. One important confounder is age, which in turn
is related to other health conditions. For this reason, our research design (outlined in more detail
in the Materials and Methods section) includes several approaches to adjusting for observed
demographic and health-related confounders.

7

Given that older men were generally using ⍺1-AR antagonists for reasons unrelated to ARDS, it
was feasible to balance the exposed and unexposed groups on a large set of prognostically
important covariates, reducing concerns that differences in outcomes might be due to
confounding. Nonetheless, there is an urgent need for randomized prospective trials to further
test this hypothesis in patients with COVID-19. In such trials, early administration of ⍺1-AR
antagonists prior to development of severe symptoms is preferred because the goal is to prevent,
rather than treat, hyperinflammation. While this study could only examine medications received
outside the inpatient environment due to dataset limitations, future work should attempt to address
whether continued use of ⍺1-AR antagonists by hospitalized patients is important for preventing
severe symptoms.
⍺1-AR antagonists with various receptor subtype characteristics have been used to treat millions
of patients with BPH, hypertension, and other disorders. This history supports their safety profile
[29], although caution is warranted in using any medication for the first time in a new disease such
as COVID-19. Given the poorly understood relationship between COVID-19 severity and
hypertension [16], it is important to note that nonselective (⍺1A=⍺1B=⍺1D) ⍺1-ARs (e.g., prazosin
and doxazosin) are often primarily used to reduce blood pressure, whereas subtype-selective
(⍺1A=⍺1D>⍺1B) ⍺1-ARs (e.g., tamsulosin) have fewer hemodynamic effects. However, given the
known redundancy of catecholamine signaling [30], we expect ⍺1-AR antagonists that inhibit all
three ⍺1-AR subtypes (e.g., prazosin and doxazosin) to be more efficacious in the prevention of
hyperinflammation.
⍺1-AR antagonists are inexpensive and administered orally, enabling widespread use if
prospective trials support their efficacy and safety. Beyond COVID-19 and other lower respiratory
tract infections, ⍺1-AR antagonists may also reduce hyperinflammation and their sequelae in
adoptive cell therapy (“cytokine release syndrome”) and autoimmune rheumatic disease.
4. Materials and Methods
4.1 Study Definitions
Patients were considered exposed if they were users of ⍺1-AR antagonists (doxazosin, alfuzosin,
prazosin, silodosin, terazosin, or tamsulosin). ⍺1-AR antagonist usage is defined by having a
medication possession ratio ≥ 50% (i.e., a minimum prescribed supply covering six of the last 12
months) for a qualifying drug in the year prior to the first inpatient admission date for ARD or
pneumonia. In additional analyses we used the same definition to consider exposed patients who
were taking tamsulosin or doxazosin. Patients are considered unexposed if they have never been
prescribed the relevant drug class or drug within the year prior to the admission date. We exclude
patients having a medical possession ratio between 0% and 50% of the relevant drug class or
drug. While all patients from the MarketScan, Optum, and Swedish National Patient Register [23]

8

databases were restricted to a 45-85 year age range, the MarketScan database only includes
patients up to age 65 due to Medicare exclusion; we adjust for age in our analyses. The data used
in this study do not include ⍺1-AR antagonist usage during the ARD or pneumonia admission.
The first instances of ARD or pneumonia inpatient admissions for each patient were identified
using ICD codes. Because the MarketScan database only includes United States patient data
through fiscal year 2016, we only used ICD-9 codes to identify diagnoses from this database. The
Optum database includes United States patient data from fiscal year 2004 through 2019, allowing
for use of both ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes to identify diagnoses. The Swedish data contained only
ICD-10 codes. To identify ARD, we used the ICD-9 code 518.82 and the ensuing ICD-10 code of
R.0603, noting that the latter code was only available from 2018 onwards; hence, the Optum ARD
cohort included only patients identified by their first inpatient admission for an ARD diagnosis
occurring either from 2004-2015 or from 2018-2019. To identify pneumonia, we used the Agency
for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) pneumonia category for both ICD-9 and ICD-10
codes.
We considered the following potential confounders: age, fiscal year, total weeks with inpatient
admissions in the prior year, total outpatient visits in the prior year, total days as an inpatient in
the prior year, total weeks with inpatient admissions in the prior two months, and comorbidities
identified from healthcare encounters in the prior year: hypertension, ischemic heart disease,
acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes
mellitus, and cancer. All comorbidities were defined according to ICD code sets provided by the
Chronic Conditions Data Warehouse [31]. The numeric confounders relevant to prior inpatient
and outpatient visits were log-transformed; all confounders were de-meaned and scaled to unit
variance.
The outcomes of interest in this study included mechanical ventilation and death. Mechanical
ventilation was tabulated as an outcome for patients receiving a procedure corresponding to one
of the following ICD-9 codes (967, 9670, 9671, 9672) or ICD-10 codes (5A1935Z, 5A1945Z,
5A1955Z). When tabulating death outcomes, we note a difference in death encoding among
databases. From the MarketScan database, we identified death outcomes by in-hospital deaths
noted in claims records. From the Optum database, in-hospital death data were unavailable, so
we instead identified death outcomes by whether a patient's month of death (if observed) was
within one month of the relevant ARD or PNA inpatient visit month. For both databases, our
analyses studied the outcome of death (as defined above) occurring along with mechanical
ventilation during inpatient stay. The Swedish National Patient Register’s in-hospital deaths were
tabulated in a similar manner to the MarketScan database. We focused on death associated with
respiratory failure to avoid counting deaths due to other diseases (many of the patients were
hospitalized for other reasons). This analysis mirrored our prospective trial design [24].

9

4.2 Unadjusted Analysis
In our baseline unadjusted analysis, we used Fisher’s exact test to compare the probability of
outcome occurrence with ⍺1-AR antagonist exposure versus without. Fisher’s exact test and the
associated non-central hypergeometric distribution under the alternative provided the odds ratios,
confidence intervals, and p-values (one-sided) reported for individual cohorts. We additionally
computed the relative risk reduction (RRR).
4.3 Adjusted Analysis
We nonparametrically estimated (using generalized random forests [32]) propensity scores and
restricted analyses to those individuals with probabilities of being exposed (and of receiving the
unexposed condition) between the maximum of the 1st percentiles and the minimum of the 99th
percentiles of propensity scores across exposed and unexposed groups [33]. This (propensity
score trimming) step prevents the comparison of individuals with an extremely low estimated
chance of receiving one of the three exposures. We refer to this as our reduced sample.
On the reduced sample, we then apply estimation techniques designed for causal inference to
compare the probability of outcome occurrence with ⍺1-AR antagonist exposure versus without.
Specifically, we invoke inverse propensity-weighting, which reweights the unexposed population
such that on average, the reweighted population more closely resembles the exposed population
in terms of observed characteristics. Doing so yields better balancing of covariates, as seen in
the pre- and post-inverse-propensity-weighting comparison in Figures 7(ii)-10(ii). To obtain an
odds ratio, we fit an inverse propensity-weighted logistic regression model. This approach is
“doubly robust” in that it yields valid estimates of causal effects if we have (1) observed all relevant
confounders and (2) either one of the logistic regression model or the propensity score model is
correctly specified. To estimate confidence intervals we used a Wald-type estimator. To obtain
one-sided p-values we invoked classical asymptotic theory.
4.4 Matched Analysis
An alternative approach comparing patients exposed to ⍺1-AR antagonists with unexposed
patients who are as similar as possible -- and thus mimicking a randomized controlled trial -involves statistical matching, where each exposed patient is compared to a set of “nearest
neighbors” measured in terms of characteristics. This approach avoids making specific functional
form assumptions about the relationship between characteristics and outcomes. [34]. Specifically,
on the reduced sample, we performed a 5:1 matching analysis [34], assigning five unexposed
patients to each exposed patient (i.e., patients exposed to any ⍺1-AR antagonist or specifically
tamsulosin or doxazosin) and then comparing the outcome of the exposed patient to the average
outcome for matched unexposed patients. We required an exact match on patient age and then
used a greedy, nearest neighbor approach based on Mahalanobis distance with a caliper of 0.2
on the remaining covariates [35]. We then used the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test on this

10

matched sample to provide the odds ratios, 95% confidence intervals, and p-values associated
with the hypothesis of no effect.
To elaborate, the CMH test can be thought of as a generalization of the chi-square test for
association [36]. Fisher’s exact test considers single 2x2 contingency tables containing the counts
for two dichotomous variables, specifically an outcome indicator and an exposure indicator (for
the setting in this paper). In contrast, the CMH test applies to an array of k contingency tables
such that the 2x2xk array of tables represents a stratification of the data into k groups or matched
pairs that can be considered comparable (typically groups are defined by the realization of some
set of categorical variables) aside from their outcome and exposure values. For each singlesource (e.g., MarketScan or Optum) matched model we compiled 2x2 contingency tables for
exposure and outcome values for the matched pairs obtained exclusively from that database. We
then conducted a CMH test on each array of 2x2 contingency tables separately. Let kM represent
the number of such tables in the MarketScan data set and kO be the number of such tables in the
Optum data set. In both cases k corresponds to the number of exposed observations for which
suitable matches could be identified.
4.5 Federated Analysis
Pooling the unadjusted models leveraged the CMH test by considering all observations from each
data set to be “matched” with other observations from the same data set according to one
categorical variable: the source database. Thus, each database contributed a single 2x2
contingency table to form the 2x2x2 array evaluated by the CMH test.
To pool the MarketScan and Optum adjusted models, we calculated the pooled coefficient and
variance of the exposure using inverse variance weighting [37]. Let 𝛽$# and𝑉𝑎𝑟(𝛽$# ) be the
estimated coefficient and variance of the exposure on dataset i. The pooled coefficient of the
exposure is
$

9

∑ 2 /567(28 )
𝛽*+,,-./ = ∑3 3
9 ,
3 :/567(28 )

and the pooled variance of the exposure coefficient is
𝑉𝑎𝑟(𝛽*+,,-./ ) =

:
.
∑3 :/567(29
8)

To pool the MarketScan and Optum matched models, we concatenated the 2x2 contingency
tables for the matched pairs from MarketScan with the 2x2 contingency tables for the matched
pairs from Optum. In this manner, we effectively pooled the two exposed populations and their
matched unexposed populations without ever combining the raw data in any way. Of note,
combining raw data was prohibited by both data use agreements. Matches for exposed patients

11

came exclusively from each exposed patient’s source data set. The CMH test effectively
processed a 2x2x(kM+kO) array of contingency tables.
Finally, we pooled the relative risk reductions (RRR) estimated from the two data sets using
inverse variance weighting of the respective RRRs contributed from separate MarketScan and
Optum analyses. First let relative risk reduction (RRR) be defined as
= = >@? A >@B = 1 − >@B ,
𝑅𝑅𝑅
>@
>@
?

?

where X corresponds to the exposed group and Y corresponds to the unexposed group. Next,
the variance of the RRR estimate can be derived as the variance of a ratio of two binomial
proportions:

4.6 Sensitivity Analysis
To assess the robustness of our results to alternative approaches to estimating causal effects
under the unconfoundedness assumption [38], we explored methods including inverse
propensity-weighted (IPW) averaging of outcomes as well as the (doubly robust) augmented
inverse propensity-weighted (AIPW) estimator, where we using used alternatives such as logistic
regression and non-parametric causal forests [28]. To assess invariance of our results to
definitional choices, we adjusted the definition of exposure to ⍺1-AR antagonists (e.g., requiring
regular use of ⍺1-AR antagonists within the prior 3 months rather than 12 months) as well as the
definitions of certain confounders (e.g., combining three cardiovascular confounders into one
indicator, including different metrics of prior inpatient or outpatient stays). The results using these
alternate methods and definitions were consistent with those presented in the results section.
Further, we sought to observe the time course of health decline in the exposed and unexposed
groups (quantified as the number of inpatient visits in the months prior to a patient’s target
admission date). This analysis shows similar temporal trends for the exposed and unexposed
groups, indicating that neither group was declining more rapidly than the other; see Figures 4-5.
Lastly, following [39], we assessed the sensitivity of our estimate of the treatment effect to the
presence of an unobserved confounder. We estimated the E-value [40], which represents “the
minimum strength of association on the risk ratio scale that an unmeasured confounder would
need to have with both the treatment and the outcome to fully explain away a specific treatment-

12

outcome association, conditional on the measured covariates” [40]. The ORs (and corresponding
confidence interval) are defined by the relative odds of occurrence of an outcome (we focus on
ventilation and death) given exposure to ⍺1-AR antagonists. We calculated the E-value on both
the OR point estimate and confidence interval, each of which has its own interpretation. The
minimum odds ratio necessary for an unmeasured confounder (equally associated with both
alpha-blocker exposure and the outcome) to move the estimated treatment effect to the null (i.e.,
OR = 1) is 2.2 for the federated ARD cohort and 1.6 for the federated pneumonia cohort; our
findings could not be fully explained by a weaker confounder. The minimum odds ratio necessary
for an unmeasured confounder to yield a confidence interval including 1 is an E-value of 1.1 for
the federated ARD cohort and 1.4 for the federated pneumonia cohort; we continue to reject the
null of no treatment effect in the presence of weaker confounding.

Figure 4. We plot the proportion of exposed and unexposed patients having any inpatient admissions a certain number
of months prior to the first ARD or pneumonia admission date, and present corresponding confidence intervals. Both
exposed and unexposed groups had similar trends of declining health leading up to the target admission date, where
health decline is defined as having more frequent inpatient visits.

13

Figure 5. We plot the average residuals of inpatient visits after controlling for age effects (as well as age squared and
age cubed) for exposed and unexposed patients having inpatient admissions a certain number of months prior to the
first ARD or pneumonia admission date, and present corresponding confidence intervals. Both exposed and unexposed
groups had similar trends of declining health leading up to the target admission date, where health decline is defined
as having more frequent inpatient visits after controlling for age effects.

4.7 Sweden National Patient Register

The Swedish National Patient Register differed from the MarketScan and Optum databases
in several key ways that motivated slight modifications to the analysis. First, we had access
to data from 2006-2012, during which time the US used ICD-9 and Sweden used ICD-10.
Second, in Sweden, ventilation is not often coded, so we instead only considered the outcome
of in-hospital death, which likely underestimates the effect size due to deaths from other
causes. Nonetheless, the basic results are preserved in this complementary data set.

a prescription for an ⍺1-AR antagonist in the year prior to hospitalization.

adjusted, and matched models, including any ⍺1-AR antagonists and specifically tamsulosin. Likewise for the secondary
outcome of requiring ventilation. In general, ⍺1-AR antagonists are associated with reducing risk of adverse events
across treatments, outcomes, and modeling approaches. The raw outcome count and corresponding RRR for
tamsulosin in the ventilation and death outcome are redacted per MarketScan policy for displaying small counts.
