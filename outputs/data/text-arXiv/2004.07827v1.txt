COVID-19: R0 is lower
where outbreak is larger
Pietro Battiston∗, Simona Gamba†
This version: April 20, 2020
Abstract
We use daily data from Lombardy, the Italian region most affected
by the COVID-19 outbreak, to calibrate a SIR model individually on
each municipality. These are all covered by the same health system
and, in the post-lockdown phase we focus on, all subject to the same
social distancing regulations. We find that municipalities with a higher
number of cases at the beginning of the period analyzed have a lower
rate of diffusion, which cannot be imputed to herd immunity. In particular, there is a robust and strongly significant negative correlation
between the estimated basic reproduction number (R0 ) and the initial
outbreak size, in contrast with the role of R0 as a predictor of outbreak
size. We explore different possible explanations for this phenomenon
and conclude that a higher number of cases causes changes of behavior,
such as a more strict adoption of social distancing measures among the
population, that reduce the spread. This result calls for a transparent,
real-time distribution of detailed epidemiological data, as such data
affects the behavior of populations in areas affected by the outbreak.

Introduction

The basic reproduction number, or R0 , represents the average number of secondary cases produced by a single infected case in an otherwise susceptible
population, and it is typically used as a reference value to assess the transmissibility of an infectious disease in a given population. Given a number
of individuals susceptible to infection, a disease with higher R0 will infect a
larger number of individuals. There is hence an obvious positive relationship
between the R0 and the resulting size of an outbreak (Tildesley and Keeling,
2009).
However, the value of R0 during an outbreak does not only depend on exante features of a virus or a population, but potentially also on the response of
both population and authorities to the outbreak. This is particularly true in
the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, to which most countries in the world
have reacted with some form of social distancing measures, or lockdown. In
absence of a vaccine or effective drugs, these measures are the best weapon
to reduce the number of deaths, as well as the number of intensive care unit
beds required (Kucharski et al., 2020; Flaxman et al., 2020; Ferguson et al.,
2020; Greenstone and Nigam, 2020).
In the present study, we analyze data on the diffusion of COVID-19 in
Lombardy, the region of Italy most heavily affected by the pandemic (Cereda
et al., 2020 provide an accurate description of the early phase of the outbreak
in such region). Specifically, we employ daily data on the number of individuals positive to COVID-19 at the municipality level, focusing on a period
in which the entire country was subject to a lockdown. All municipalities
under analysis share the same public health system and, in the period considered, were subject to the same social distancing regulation. However, at
the start of the period, they were characterized by a strong heterogeneity in
the number of cases, both in absolute terms and in terms of cases per capita.
We study a period beginning on March 25, 2020, that is, more than
two weeks after the lockdown regulation was put in place, and ending with
April 14, when such regulations still held: this means that movements across
municipalities are severely restricted, requiring any travelers to present a
valid (typically work or health related) justification for their journey.
We fit a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model on data from each
municipality and find that the estimated R0 is negatively correlated with the
prevalence in the municipality at the beginning of our period. This result
holds both when considering the absolute and per capita number of cases
2

and is robust to different specifications and sample disaggregations.
We present and compare different complementary explanations for this
finding. Early and widespread testing increases the reported number of cases
and might allow the authorities to slow the spread of the pandemic by isolating known cases. At the same time, where the number of cases is higher,
the population might comply more strictly with the lockdown measures, thus
reducing the rate of spread: we show in Section 4.1 why the latter mechanism
is most likely to drive our results.

Data

We employ count data of per-municipality recorded cases, updated daily and
distributed by regional authorities. We do not rely on data on recovered
and deceased individuals, as such data are not available with the required
geographical disaggregation.
Data are available starting from March 25, 2020 and cover a period of
twenty-one days during which lockdown measures were always in place. We
verify that only minimal deviations appear between regional data and the
aggregation of municipal data. Out of 1507 municipalities in Lombardy, 960
had at least one recorded COVID-19 case as of this date. Figure 1a displays
the number of cases (size of the dots) and the cases per capita (color of the
dots) as of March 25 for each of these 960 municipalities. Similarly, Figure 1b
displays the number of new cases (size of the dots) and the number of new
cases per capita (color of the dots) recorded in each municipality between
March 25 and April 14.
It should be noted that official data concerning the COVID-19 outbreak
in Italy has been found to be strongly incomplete, both in terms of positive
individuals and of casualties: several researchers have estimated an outbreak
size much higher than that suggested by official numbers (Flaxman et al.,
2020), while others have corroborated this with an analysis of anomalies
in death rates.1 Moreover, local testing strategies are known to have deviated from WHO guidelines and have changed over time, also depending on
available resources: towards the end of our period of interest, more subjects
with mild symptoms were tested. For this reason, some researchers have put
forwards adaptations of the SIR model that account for a threshold in the

capacity of the health system.2 Such problems are not specific to Italy, as official data from a number of countries have been questioned. More in general,
the difficulty in obtaining reliable data on the number of infected, deceased
and recovered individuals calls for refinements of traditional epidemiologic
models (Atkeson et al., 2020; Riccardo et al., 2020).
Given our research question, these caveats are of limited importance.
Indeed, the focus of the present work is to document differences in response
across municipalities, rather than to precisely estimate the epidemiological
parameters or expected duration of the COVID-19 outbreak in Lombardy.
Data on population size is obtained from the Italian National Istitute of
Statistics (ISTAT).

Methods

We fit a SIR model on each municipality in the period of twenty-one days
beginning in March 25. Given the short time span considered, we employ a
simplified SIR model which does not account for natural rate of mortality.
Hence, the model is entirely defined by setting few parameters: β, which determines the rate at which susceptible (S) individuals become infected (I);
γ, which determine the rate at which infected individuals become recovered
(R); the initial number of infected and recovered individuals, and the population size N (= S + I + R). We take population size from official statistics.
We hence consider a discretized version of the continuous SIR model – each
period corresponding to a day – and automatically explore the parameter
space for β, γ, and the initial value for I and R, looking for the combination
that provides the best fit.3 Specifically, the goodness of fit is maximized by
minimizing the sum of square residuals between the cases count and the sum
of the I and R pools sizes.4 The initial values for the free parameters are set
to those calibrated on the entire Lombardy region.

3
While in principle we could consider a constraint by which the sum of the initial values
of I and R adds up to the initial number of cases, this is not required nor optimal. It is not
required because the fitting procedure minimizes the fit error in all periods, including the
first; it is not optimal because the first datum might legitimally be affected by fluctuations
that deserve no larger importance than subsequent ones.

Note: fit between data and the corresponding SIR model for Lombardy region (left) and
the most affected municipalities at the beginning of our period of interest in absolute and
per capita terms, respectively (center, right).

Given that the SIR model assumes a non-null initial population of infected
individuals, we only consider the 960 municipalities satisfying this condition.
We further drop 47 municipalities which had new cases recorded on only one
or two dates, hence reducing to 913 municipalities.5 Although this sample
selection might in principle affect our results, we show in Section 4.2 that
this is not the case.
Figure 2a displays the fit between data at the regional level and the
corresponding simulated SIR model. Figures 2b and 2c are the equivalent
for Milan and Castiglione d’Adda: these are the two municipalities which, at
the beginning of our period of interest, had been most heavily hit in absolute
and per capita terms, respectively. Note that a weekly fluctuation can be
observed for all municipalities: this is in line with documented evidence that
less tests are processed during the weeekend, and the effect reverberates on
the number of positive detected cases with a delay of two to three days. We
expect these fluctuations to affect the entire region homogeneously.
Once we find the best SIR parameters for each municipality, we regress
the estimated R0 (the ratio of the estimated β and γ) on the outbreak size
within the municipality as of March 25. We focus on the per capita number of
cases, as we expect any effect to be related to the prevalence of the outbreak
– a same number of cases will be perceived in a very different way in Milan
5

The fitting procedure may become unreliable if provided too few updating points; in
particular, a linear growth of cases yields an indeterminacy problem whereas a similar
prediction can be obtained with very different paramter values.

Results

Figure 3 shows the distribution of the estimated values of R0 : the mean
estimated value is 0.83 (0.85 when weighted on population), while the median
is 0.70A strong heterogeneity (which can be partly attributed to statistical
noise – several municipalities count only a few cases each) can be observed
across municipalities: in what follows, unless differently specified, we trim
data by dropping 0.5% of outliers on each side of the distribution of R0 ,
hence reducing to 903 municipalities. In only few of these (179) the value
of R0 appears to be larger than the critical threshold of 1: that is, in the
vast majority of municipalities, the outbreak is expected to spontaneously
extinguish without requiring herd immunity.
Table 1 presents the results of the regression analysis. We see a negative
and strongly significant relationship between the initial number of cases per
one thousand inhabitants and the estimated R0 (column (1)); this relationship is robust to controlling for population size (column (2)), and to both
the absolute number of cases and the inverse of population size (column (3)),
i.e., a full interaction model where the the per capita count represents the
interaction term (Kronmal, 1993). The coefficient for the per capita number

of cases can be interpreted as the reduction in R0 resulting from an increase
of one case per one thousand individuals in the prevalence of the outbreak.
The value of -0.023 observed in column (2), which we consider as our baseline
specification, indicates a sizeable effect: for reference, given that the prevalence in Milan as of March 25 was of around 1.7%, the above mentioned
result suggests that had it been 2.7%, the average R0 would have been
around 0.88 instead than the observed 0.90. The same negative and strongly
significant effect is observed if we focus on the absolute number of cases as
explanatory variable, controlling for the population size (column (4)).
It should be noted that any intrinsic characteristic of municipalities – such
as demography, location, structure of the economy – which might explain
a larger outbreak size should also favor a larger R0 (Mills, 2020). Thus,
controlling for such characteristics is expected to further reduce the coefficient
for cases%.

4.1

Interpretation

There are a few reasons that might explain why a larger outbreak should
result in a subsequent lower R0 .
The first might be related to herd immunity, by which areas where the
outbreak is initially more present have less scope for further spread because
a large share of individuals have already caught, and possibly developed
immunity to, the virus. This is in principle not a problem of our approach,
as the SIR model accounts for this effect and should estimate an R0 net
of it – in other terms, R0 describes the evolution of the outbreak in an
hypothetical situation in which the pool of susceptible individuals is never
reduced. However, the problem might still arise if the count data employed
severely underestimate the actual spread of the virus: the number of positive
cases could actually be much larger than the detected one, leading to an
estimated R0 lower than the real one because of the undetected effect of herd
immunity in reducing the rate of contagion.
The underestimation of infected population might also suggest an alternative explanation of the result related to test capacity: to the extent that
a lower detected prevalence reflects a lower ability of authorities to identify
infected individuals, it should then correlate with a lower ability to isolate,
hospitalize and cure them, and hence to a faster outbreak growth.
A third, social, explanation is instead that wherever the local population
is aware of a larger prevalence of the disease, it reacts by changing its behavior
towards a stricter application of social distancing rules, thus leading to a lower
R0 . In what follows, we provide evidence in favor of this hypothesis.
We start by analyzing the first possible explanation: several sources have
argued that the actual size of the infected population might lie between four
and ten times the official reported numbers. In the most affected muncipalities in our sample during the period analyzed, 57 infections per one thousand
inhabitants have been recorded, and according to the most pessimistic estimates this would mean that up to 57% of the population was infected. While
most municipalities have a number of recorded cases per one thousand inhabitants which is orders of magnitude lower, to avoid the possibility that
an even partial herd immunity effect might be driving the results, we reestimate our main model on subsamples of municipalities according to their
initial number of cases per capita. Specifically, we split the sample according to quartiles of cases per capita on March 25. The results, presented in
columns (1) to (4) of Table 2, show that our findings are not driven by herd
9

immunity, as the coefficient for cases% is negative in each quartile. The absolute value of such coefficient is actually much larger for municipalities with
a low prevalence than for those with a higher prevalence, and is strongly
significant in the first two quartiles, hence including municipalities with 2
cases per one thousand inhabitants or less.
We then consider the second possible explanation: that a lower detected
prevalence signals a lower detection ability, and that this naturally correlates
with lower ability to track and quarantine infected subjects, hence raising
the subsequent rate of diffusion. In order to disentangle this test capacity
explanation from the third, social, one, we sketch two simple models of how
these would be expected to affect R0 .
Let us represent with ut the unknown real number of infected subjects
per one thousand inhabitants, at time t in a given municipality, and with
it the corresponding known number. We are interested in the extent to
which unidentified infected subjects (which are ut −it cases per one thousand
inhabitants) will raise the R0 for the municipality in the subsequent period.
More specifically, we can assume that identified and unidentified patients
form two different pools of infected subjects and that the latter has a much
higher β – probability of infecting susceptible individuals – that leads to a
corresponding higher R0 . Since β enters linearly in R0 – and assuming for
simplicity that γ is constant – the relationship between ut − it and R0 would
be expected to be linear. Moreover, it is well known that not only identified
patients are subject to a stronger form of isolation, but also close contacts
of such patient (some of which are not infected) are recommended to selfquarantine: this does not happen in municipalities with a larger number of
undetected cases, which implies that the effect of each unidentified patient
should be more than linear in increasing the R0 . This would imply a linear
or concave relationship between cases% and R0 .
Vice-versa, any social explanation is based on the assumption that inhabitants react to the news of the cases in their municipality. Given any
concave function describing this reaction, a same increase in per capita cases
will be perceived as more important if the initial number of cases is lower.
That is, we can expect inhabitants of two towns with respectively 1 and
11 known cases per one thousand inhabitants to differ in their compliance
with social distancing prescriptions more than inhabitants of two towns with
respectively 20 and 30 known cases per one thousands inhabitants: a same
difference of one percentage point in prevalence will have a weaker effect on
people behavior were prevalence is higher. This alternative explanation pre10

dicts a convex relationship (given the negative sign) between cases% and
R0 .
To disentangle between the test capacity and the social explanation, we
enrich our basic model by introducing a quadratic term in cases%. This
is done in column (5) of Table 2. We see that the quadratic term has a
positive sign and is strongly significant, while the sign of the linear term is
still negative and has increased in absolute terms. Hence, while this does
not allow us to exlude that the other explanations might play a role, we
can conclude that the social explanation is the main driver of the negative
relationship between cases% and R0 .
(Jones et al., 2020) describes two possible opposite reactions to the COVID19 oubreak: a precautionary attitude that leads to a stricter adherence to
guidelines, and a “fatalism effect” according to which an individual who is
more likely to be infected in the future “reduces her incentives to be careful
today”. Our results provide strong evidence in favor of the first mechanism.

Sensitivity tests

In addition to the quantile analysis previously described, we verify that our
main result also holds consistently across the 12 provinces (lower level administrative regions) of which Lombardy is composed. Results are displayed
in Figure 4a. We see that, for each province, the effect of cases% on R0 is
negative: although the small sample size results in only few provinces reaching statistical significance, it is clear that no specific area of Lombardy is
alone responsible for our findings.
In order to verify that our results do not strictly depend upon the period
considered, we replicate our analysis over different 10-days moving windows
within our period of analysis. For each subperiod, we fit the R0 for each municipality and regress it on the number of cases per thousand individuals at
the beginning of that subperiod. In accordance with the selection procedure
described in Section 3, we reduce this analysis to the 713 municipalities that
feature at least one case on March 25 and, in each window, have new cases
recorded in at least two dates. The results are shown in Figure 4b. For comparability, we also display the value of the coefficient estimated for the entire
time period on the same restricted sample of 713 municipalities. We find
that the effect of interest is robust, that is, the coefficient for the cases% is
consistently negative and strongly significant for each subperiod. Its absolute
value is significantly decreasing over time; that is, the effect of the number
of cases on the R0 in the following days appears to be stronger in the earlier
days of the outbreak. While there might be multiple explanations for this,
we only remark that the rate of growth of the epidemic has been consistently
decreasing: whether individual behavior reacts not just to outbreak size, but
also to its change over time, is an issue for further research.
Finally, we verify that all results reported in Table 1, including statistical
significance, are virtually unchanged if we do not trim the data as previously
described.

Prediction of outbreak duration

While an accurate predition of the date of extinction of the outbreak deserves
more sophisticated epidemiologic models (Guzzetta et al., 2020; Riccardo
et al., 2020) that are out of the scope of the present paper, we can analyze
to some extent the relationship between the predicted date of extinction and
the number of initial cases.

Note: dependent variable: days to expected outbreak extinction. “Extinction” is defined
as reaching 0.1 cases per one thousand inhabitant in columns (1) and (2), 0.1 cases in

In general, the relationship between infected population at time t and
expected date of extinction of the outbreak within a SIR model depends
on the size of R0 : if the latter is smaller than 1 – i.e., the outbreak is
spontaneously slowing – then a smaller outbreak will extinguish sooner; viceversa, if R0 > 1, a larger outbreak will sooner reach a level of herd immunity,
and hence die out.
Since, according to our data, most municipalities in Lombardy display
an R0 < 1, we focus on this case. While for a same level of R0 we expect
the predicted time to extinction to increase with the initial outbreak size,
the fact that the R0 is negatively related to initial outbreak size – and that
a lower R0 leads to a quicker extinction – leaves theoretically undetermined
the relationship between initial outbreak size and duration of the outbreak.
In order to shed light on this indeterminacy, we proceed to simulating
the SIR model for each municipality until the predicted size of the infected
population decreases below either (i) 0.1 cases for one thousands inhabitants

14

or (ii) 0.1 cases6 and we consider the number of periods elapsed as the outbreak duration. We then regress the outbreak duration, defined in these two
different ways, over the initial (i) number of cases per capita (columns (1)
and (2) of Table 3) and (ii) absolute number of cases (columns (3) and (4)
of Table 3), respectively.
Results from Table 3 show that the relationship between outbreak size
and extinction date is non-trivial. First, the relatively few municipalities
with R0 > 1 do influence significantly the results – as already discussed,
the expected effect of outbreak size for a same R0 is reversed in such cases.
Second, if we restrict to R0 < 1, the relationship is positive and significant
when reasoning in per capita terms, but not in absolute terms. It should
also be mentioned that the results depend on the thresholds adopted in the
definition of outbreak extinction. In general, given that R0 < 1 determines
the exponential decay, a lower threshold will mean that the date of extinction
is further away for municipalities with a relatively low number of cases and
relatively high R0 .
Summing up, the results of predicting the extinction date are to be interpreted as cautionary: municipalities with smaller outbreaks might get rid of
them sooner than others with more infected individuals (column (2) of Table
3), but this result does not generalize to the absolute outbreak size (columns
(3) and (4) – the former even featuring a negative sign). Plans for a gradual
exit from lockdown should take into account that the relationship between
outbreak size and expected outbreak duration is difficult to pinpoint – as well
as the possibility that a larger outbreak might bring the population closer to
herd immunity, making it more resistent to a new outbreak.

Conclusion

We show that in Lombardy, during a lockdown, the basic reproduction number for COVID-19 reacts negatively to the initial size of an outbreak at the
municipality level, an effect which cannot be explained by the population
having reached herd immunity. Limited test capacity – and hence a limited
ability by health authorities to isolate and treat affected individuals – appear

SIR models by design tend to 0 infected subjects only for t → ∞ and different authors
pick different thresholds as denoting outbreak extinction. Notice that the most appropriate
value crucially depends also on the extent to which the outbreak is underestimated by
available data.

to have at most a marginal role in explaining our result. Instead, we show
that the population’s behavior is key to slowing down the contagion and in
particular that information about local outbreaks impacts on diffusion rates.
This effect is consistent across all provinces and it is robust to the sample
period considered.
The fact that the effect is particularly strong in municipalities characterized by a smaller outbreak suggests that individuals react more strongly to
the first few cases. This aspect is confirmed by the convex relationship we
find between the initial size of the outbreak and the R0 : the marginal effect
on behavior of each new case seems to decrease in the number of cases.
Our results provide evidence in favor of a precautionary rather than fatalistic individual attitude towards the outbreak. They call for considering
the population as an integral part of the decision making process, and for a
timely and transparent provision of epidemiologic data.

Optimization procedure
For simplicity, the procedure for fitting the SIR model is implemented over
the parameters R0 and γ rather than β and γ, where R0 = βγ . For each
parameter (including the initial values I = Iˆ and R = R̂), the procedure
is initialized by deriving reasonable values based on tuning the model to
regional aggregated data.
Then the procedure works as follows (i denotes an iteration, δπ,1 is set to
0.2 for each parameter π):
1. given the current value of a parameter πi , compute values of the parameter πi−l = πi × (1 − δπ,i ) and πi,r = πi × (1 + δπ,i ) (the right and
left candidate values for parameter π),
2. compare count data and the simulation obtained with each of the three
candidates πi,l , πi and πi,r by computing the sum of squared residuals,
3. select the candidate value which results in the smallest error as new
parameter value πi+1 ,
4. if the value did not change (that is, πi+1 = πi ), set δπ,i+1 = δπ,i · 0.75;
otherwise, leave δπ,i+1 = δπ,i ,
ˆ R̂},
5. repeat steps from 1 to 4 for each parameter π ∈ {R0 , γ, I,
6. repeat steps from 1 to 5 until δπ,i < 0.001 for each parameter.
