Abstract. The COVID-19 recession that started in March 2020 led to an
unprecedented decline in economic activity across the globe. To fight this
recession, policy makers in central banks engaged in expansionary monetary
policy. This paper asks whether the measures adopted by the US Federal
Reserve (Fed) have been effective in boosting real activity and calming
financial markets. To measure these effects at high frequencies, we propose a
novel mixed frequency vector autoregressive (MF-VAR) model. This model
allows us to combine weekly and monthly information within an unified
framework. Our model combines a set of macroeconomic aggregates such as
industrial production, unemployment rates and inflation with high frequency
information from financial markets such as stock prices, interest rate spreads
and weekly information on the Feds balance sheet size. The latter set of
high frequency time series is used to dynamically interpolate the monthly
time series to obtain weekly macroeconomic measures. We use this setup to
simulate counterfactuals in absence of monetary stimulus. The results show
that the monetary expansion caused higher output growth and stock market
returns, more favorable long-term financing conditions and a depreciation of
the US dollar compared to a no-policy benchmark scenario.

1. INTRODUCTION
Worldwide restrictions to contain the spread of the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) triggered a
sharp drop in global economic activity, a collapse in trade and a severe rise in unemployment.
First estimates for 2020 point at considerable contractions of GDP in most advanced economies
(McKibbin and Fernando, 2020). Policymakers responded swiftly, with unprecedented fiscal stimulus packages in the magnitude of nearly 15% of global GDP.1 In the same vein, central banks
provided stimulus by loosening their policy stance considerably. In many emerging economies,
central banks successfully introduced forms of quantitative easing for the first time (Arslan et al.,
2020; Hartley and Rebucci, 2020), while in advanced economies with policy space, easings took
mostly the form of rate cuts, which further facilitated the use of fiscal stimulus packages.
In the US, the economic effect of the pandemic was felt strongly on labor markets: employment
dropped sharply and wages were cut (Cajner et al., 2020; Kurmann et al., 2020). This weakened
demand and inflation considerably. The negative business climate also deterred financial markets,
with equity prices collapsing more strongly than in any previous crises triggered by infectious
disease outbreaks (Baker et al., 2020). Relatedly, US Treasury markets experienced a sharp selloff, leading to spikes in long-term yields (Schrimpf et al., 2020). The US Federal Reserve (Fed)
responded with several measures including the opening of credit facilities to support malfunctioning
markets and actions aimed at relieving cash-flow stress for small and medium-sized businesses, as
well as municipalities. The most prominent actions, however, were moving the policy rate back
towards the zero lower bound and resuming the monthly purchase of massive amounts of securities.
This paper tries to give a first assessment of how successful the monetary easing in the US
was in stabilizing prices and providing stimulus to the economy. One concern when assessing the
effectiveness of policy responses in real-time is the low frequency nature of many macroeconomic
aggregates (with most of them available on a monthly or quarterly frequency, at best). Even if
we rely on monthly data we are left with only very few observations that we can use to infer the
effects of monetary policy during the COVID-19 crisis on several key quantities of interest for
policy makers.
For that purpose, we borrow strength from data which is available at higher frequencies. These
time series are often sampled at daily or weekly frequency and allow us to construct weekly measures of industrial production, inflation and unemployment. This is achieved within a coherent
multivariate framework that allows for dynamic interactions between the macroeconomic and financial quantities considered.

Our proposed econometric framework is a mixed frequency vector autoregression (MF-VAR)
which models all variables on a weekly frequency. Using a state space representation of the multivariate system, we recast the lower frequency quantities in terms of a weekly component with
missings between monthly observed values. These missing observations are subsequently estimated
by taking into account the properties of the model and using the higher frequency time series dynamically. Our model is then used to simulate the effects of monetary policy shocks. Using these
shocks we can compute weekly historical decompositions and perform counterfactual scenarios to
investigate the effects the monetary policy measures had on the US economy.
Our results indicate that without a monetary expansion, US economic activity would have
been significantly lower. In other words, the US Fed, so far, has been successful in cushioning the
economic consequences of the COVID-19 crisis. Positive effects on output growth are underpinned
by a rise in stock market returns, an easing of long-term financing conditions and a depreciation
of the US dollar. By contrast, effects on inflation and the unemployment rate are statistically
insignificant.
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 briefly describes the dataset
and econometric model used while Section 3 shows the main results. In this section, we discuss the
dynamic reactions to a monetary policy shock and discuss the historical decompositions. Finally,
the last section briefly summarizes and concludes the paper.

2. EMPIRICAL FRAMEWORK
2.1. A Mixed Frequency VAR Model
As stated in the introductory section, one key issue with adequately assessing the impacts of
COVID-19 related monetary policy measures is the extremely short time span of available data.
To provide a timely estimate, one could focus on high frequency variables such as interest rate
spreads or stock prices. But these are typically not of direct interest for policy makers. In policy
making circles, assessing the effects of monetary policy interventions on output, inflation and labor
markets is pertinent. Unfortunately, for all these variables we only have a handful of observations,
rendering an adequate assessment of policy effectiveness difficult.
As a solution, we propose pairing a panel of weekly indicators, contained in an MH -dimensional
vector yt,H , with monthly indicators stored in an ML -dimensional vector yt,L in a MF-VAR. These
vectors run from t = 1, . . . , T , with T denoting the number of weeks in our sample. Following
Schorfheide and Song (2015), we assume that yt,H is a latent weekly measure of the low frequency
indicator.
3

One key objective is to infer yH,t to obtain weekly measures of the low frequency variables.
This is achieved by defining yt = (yt,L , yt,H )0 , which is an M (= MH + ML )-dimensional vector,
and assuming that it follows a VAR(P ) process:

yt = A1 yt−1 + · · · + Ap yt−p + εt ,

εt ∼ N (0M , Σt )

(1)

where Aj (j = 1, . . . , M ) are M × M coefficient matrices associated with lags j = 1, . . . , P . εt is a
white noise Gaussian process with variance-covariance matrix Σt that varies over time. To speed
up computation and assume that the Covid-19 shock led to a sharp increase in the conditional
variance of all elements in yt , we introduce a common stochastic volatility (CSV) model originally
proposed in Carriero et al. (2016). This implies that Σt is driven by a scalar factor such that:
Σt = eht × Σ.

We assume that ht evolves according to an AR(1) process:

ht = µh + ρh (ht−1 − µh ) + σh vt ,

vt ∼ N (0, 1).

Here, µh denotes the unconditional mean, ρh the autoregressive parameter and σh2 the error variance. ht simply scales the time-invariant variance-covariance matrix Σ. This allows us to capture
sudden common shifts in variances while leaving the contemporaneous relations unchanged over
time.
Equation (1) can be cast in its companion form:

zt = F zt−1 + ηt ,

(2)

0
0
with zt = (yt0 , . . . , yt−P
+1 ) and F being the K × K companion matrix (for K = P M ) with the

first M rows given by (A1 , . . . , Ap ). The remaining rows are defined to return an identity such that
yt−j = yt−j for j = 1, . . . , P − 1. The first M elements of ηt are equal to εt while the remaining
elements are equal to zero.
The missing values in yt can be obtained by interpreting (2) as a state evolution equation that
provides information on how the elements in zt (and thus yt ) are related over time. Following
much of the recent literature (Koop et al., 2020a;b; Gefang et al., 2020), we assume that the
four-week-average of yL,t which we denote by x̃L,t , is related to yL,t as follows:

x̃t,L = (yL,t + yL,t−1 + yL,t−2 + yL,t−3 ) /4.

4

This equation states that we view x̃t,L as the (observed) average of the weekly latent indicators.
Notice that this assumption implies that each month features exactly four weeks (and thus we drop
four weeks per year to arrive at 48 weeks). Define a selection matrix SLt that equals an identity
matrix in time t only in the last week of a month while being equal to a zero matrix for the initial
three weeks, and ΛL is a matrix such that:

xt,L = SL,t x̃t,L = SL,t ΛL zt .

For the monthly indicators, we assume that the identity xt,H = yt,H holds if the dataset is
balanced. If some monthly values are missing, we introduce a separate selection matrix SM,t with
xM,t = SM,t yM,t .
Following Schorfheide and Song (2015), the observation equation that relates the observed to
the latent quantities is:

xt = Mt Λzt .

(3)

Here, xt = (x0t,L , x0t,H )0 , Mt is a selection matrix and Λ is composed of ΛL and appropriate
selection vectors to single out the high frequency quantities in zt .
We estimate the MF-VAR using Bayesian techniques. This implies that we need to specify
suitable priors on all parameters of the model. In this paper, we use the conjugate Minnesota
prior on the VAR coefficients which has also been used by Schorfheide and Song (2015). On the
remaining model parameters (which comprise of the parameters of the state equation of ht and
Σ), we use a Beta prior on the autoregressive coefficient ρh , a normally distributed prior on the
unconditional mean µh and a Gamma prior on σh2 . Finally, we use an weakly informative inverse
Wishart prior on Σ. Estimation is carried out using the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
algorithm discussed in Schorfheide and Song (2015) and efficiently implemented in the R package
mfbvar(Ankargren and Yang, 2019).

2.2. Data
Our analysis focuses on the reaction of the consumer price index (CPIAUCSL), the unemployment
rate (UNRATE) and industrial production (INDPRO) to a monetary policy easing. All of these focal
variables are on a monthly frequency. Higher-frequency variables consist mainly of financial indicators. In particular, we include the money supply (M2) as the policy variable, the five-year forward
inflation expectation rate (T5YIFR) to gauge market-based inflation expectations, the NASDAQ
composite indicator (NASDAQCOM), the US dollar/euro foreign exchange rate (DEXUSEU) and the

ten-year treasury constant maturity rate (WGS10YR). As measures of financial stress we rely on the
CBOE volatility index (VIX, VIXCLS).
The sample period runs from the first week of 2011 to week 24 of 2020 (end of week: June 8,
2020) and is taken from the FRED database of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis (fred.stlouisfed.org).
If the raw data for financial variables is on a higher frequency than weekly (that is, daily for T5YIFR,
NASDAQCOM, DEXUSEU, VIXCLS), we take the arithmetic average over the respective weekdays. All
variables enter the model as year-on-year differences.

3. SCENARIO AND COUNTERFACTUAL ANALYSIS
In this section we examine the effects of an expansion of the US money supply on output, inflation,
the unemployment rate and several financial indicators. In what follows, we proceed in two steps.
First, we look at the overall plausibility of our model by examining impulse response functions.
For that purpose, we rely on a simple recursive identification scheme with ordering the monthly
variables first, followed by M2. Last, we put all other weekly indicators. Note that this simple
recursive scheme implies zero restrictions on the low-frequency variables. In particular, in our
application the Cholesky decomposition implies that there are no contemporaneous effects of the
high-frequency indicators on inflation, output and the unemployment rate, an assumption with
which most economist would agree upon.
The results are depicted in Fig. 1 which shows the posterior median (solid line) along with
90% credible intervals. The figure demonstrates that the expansionary shock to the money supply
(M2) significantly drives up output growth and lowers the unemployment rate. These effects are
rather persistent and take place with a lag. We do not find a significant upward effect on inflation,
although we have included inflation expectations which in general should help mitigating the price
6

puzzle (Castelnuovo and Surico, 2010) often encountered in empirical studies. This finding can
be explained by the time period under consideration, which was characterized by low interest and
inflation rates. As regards financial variables, we see a a significant and persistent upward effect on
equity returns, a front-loaded depreciation of the US dollar and a decrease of long-term yields. Also
the VIX increases immediately, which could be related to the positive and pronounced shoot-up of
equity returns. Summing up, the mixed-frequency approach generates impulse response functions
that are in line with predictions of the bulk of empirical studies on the effects of monetary policy.
Next, we generate counterfactual scenarios. For that purpose, we construct historical decompositions that explain deviations of time series from their trend by shocks to the equations in the
system. Neutralizing shocks to money supply after the onset of the COVID-19 crisis thus yields
a counterfactual scenario to answer the question how output growth, unemployment and inflation
would have evolved without the Fed having provided monetary stimulus.
The results are depicted in Fig. 2. In the upper panels, we show the evolution of actual series
(black thick lines) and responses under the counterfactual scenario (grey shaded area, dashed line)
along with 90% credible intervals. Since high-frequency movements of low-frequency variables are
estimated within the MF-VAR framework, we also depict credible intervals for the historical weekly
evolution of inflation, the unemployment rate and output growth (black thin lines).
The results indicate that output growth would have been weaker without monetary policy
stimulus provided by the US Fed. This finding could be driven by the strong effect monetary
policy exerted on financial variables: equity returns would have been considerably lower and longterm yields higher under the no-policy scenario. The analysis also suggests that monetary policy
triggered a stronger depreciation of the exchange rate and hence a boost to external competitiveness
of the US economy. By contrast, the counterfactuals show no significant effect on unemployment
and inflation. Considering the delayed response of unemployment discussed in the context of the
impulse response functions, this might be an artefact of the considered counterfactual period being
to short to detect effects of the expansion yet.
To investigate the significance more systematically, the bottom panel of Fig. 2 presents the
differences of the responses under the no-policy and the policy scenario along with 90% credible
intervals. That analysis corroborates the findings from above that monetary policy led to higher
output growth, a pick up in equity returns and an easing in long-term financing conditions. It also
led to a significantly lower value of the US dollar.

4. CLOSING REMARKS
In this note, we gave a first empirical investigation of the effects of US monetary policy to stimulate
growth in response to COVID-19. For that purpose, we have estimated a MF-VAR on monthly and
weekly data. This model allows us to estimate weekly measures of industrial production, inflation
and the unemployment rate. We then simulate the effects of expansionary monetary policy and
assess its effects on the endogenous variables in the model.
The results suggest that the US Fed was successful in stimulating growth on the back of higher
equity prices and more favorable long-term financing conditions. Also, monetary policy triggered a
depreciation of the US dollar supporting external competitiveness of the US economy. By contrast,
we do not find significant effects on unemployment and inflation, both variables that typically react
more sluggishly to economic stimulus.
