Abstract
Since the end of 2019, COVID-19 has significantly affected the lives of people around the world. Towards the end of 2020, several COVID-19 vaccine
candidates with relatively high efficacy have been reported in the final phase
of clinical trials. Vaccines have been considered as critical tools for opening
up social and economic activities, thereby lessening the impact of this disease on the society. This paper presents a simulation of COVID-19 spread
using modified Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model under vaccine intervention in several localities of Malaysia, i.e. those cities or states with
high relatively COVID-19 cases such as Kuala Lumpur, Penang, Sabah, and
Sarawak. The results show that at different vaccine efficacy levels (0.75, 0.85,
and 0.95), the curves of active infection vary slightly, indicating that vaccines
with efficacy above 0.75 would produce the herd immunity required to level
the curves. In addition, disparity is significant between implementing or not
implementing a vaccination program. Simulation results also show that lowering the reproduction number, R0 is necessary to keep the infection curve
flat despite vaccination. This is due to the assumption that vaccination is
mostly carried out gradually at the assumed fixed rate. The statement is
based on our simulation results with two values of R0 : 1.1 and 1.2, indicative
of reduction of R0 by social distancing. The lower R0 shows a smaller peak
amplitude about half the value simulated with R0 = 1.2. In conclusion, the
simulation model suggests a two-pronged strategy to combat the COVID-19
pandemic in Malaysia: vaccination and compliance with standard operating

1. Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCOV) first reported in the city of Wuhan, China. The epidemic
began in December 2019, when several adults in Wuhan presented with serious pneumonia [1]. Since then, the infection has spread globally and the
number of cases increased exponentially, with more than 90 million people
infected by January 2021 [2]. The COVID-19 pandemic impacted the socioeconomic wellbeing for many countries in 2020 [3]. It has been believed that
the vaccination would be the most promising alternative to get life back to
normal. To date, there have been at least 166 vaccine candidates undertaking
pre-clinical and clinical trials [4].
In the fourth quarter of 2020, several pharmacological companies reported
high efficacy rates of their vaccine candidates [5]. By mid-December 2020,
57 vaccine candidates were in clinical research, including 40 candidates in
Phase I–II trials and 17 candidates in Phase II–III trials. In Phase III trials,
several COVID-19 vaccines demonstrated efficacy as high as 95% in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 infections [6]. Various levels of efficacy had
been reported for the advance phases of clinical trials: Sinopharm (79%) [7],
Pfizer BioNTech (95%) [6], Moderna (94.5%) [8] at advance phases of clinical trials. A survey was conducted in [9] to gauge the public acceptance of
COVID-19 vaccines in 19 countries. From the results, 71.5% of respondents
reported that they would be very or very likely to take vaccines and 61.4%
reported accepting employer’s recommendation to do so. Acceptance rate
discrepancies ranged from almost 90% (China) to less than 55% (Russia).
With the proposed vaccination campaign, countries are considering to
open economic operations to reactivate the socio-economy activities. In
Malaysia, vaccines were scheduled to arrive in the mid of first quarter of
2021 [10]. However, according to a public survey, approximately one-third
of Malaysian people were still unsure of the safety of COVID-19 vaccines
[11]. Hence, it is crucial to create public awareness on the importance of
vaccination.
In this paper, we we present the results of simulating the effectiveness
of vaccination in reducing the infection rates in Malaysia. In particular, we
2

focus on Kuala Lumpur, the capital of Malaysia and three states, i.e. Penang,
Sabah, and Sarawak. Further, we apply a modified Susceptible-InfectedRemoved (SIR) model to incorporate constant vaccination rate based on
the Malaysia Government’s planning. SIR has been widely used to model
COVID-19 pandemic spread [12, 13]. Note that mathematical modelling
has been a long progressive field due to its inherent importance to health
policy makers. This will help to answer some fundamental questions, such
as the effectiveness of the vaccination program given various efficacy rates
and current developments. However, it needs to be highlighted that these
projections are only based on the proposed model. Furthermore, the modified
SIR model does not take into account the stochasticity of the imported cases.
This research will serve as a projection to observe the effects of vaccination
at different efficacy rates and to show the importance of vaccination.
2. Previous Work
In [14], the authors discussed various models for forecasting the spread of
COVID-19 including the common compartmental models (SIR and Susceptible–Exposed–Infected–Removed (SEIR)), exponential growth model, and
self exiting branch model. Despite there are various methods, the principle
remains the same i.e. to find some parameters which enable the model to
represent the actual recorded data. Obviously, compartmental models have
been highly popular in modeling COVID-19 as seen from massive research
works in this area. SIR model was used to fit the COVID-19 data and then
used to forecast the number of cases in Senegal [15]. In Italy, particle swarm
optimization (PSO), a form of stochastic optimization method, was used to
fit SEIR COVID-19 model to actual data [16]. Acuña-Zegarra, et. al. [17]
developed an optimal control problem to design vaccination strategies with
various efficacy rates to gauge the COVID-19 pandemic situation. It was
difficult to gauge the efficiency of the vaccine to provide immunity to the
receivers as the clinical trials are based on procedures and evaluation based
on the efficacy. SIR models have been developed for some countries (China,
South Korea, India, Australia, and USA) [12]. In [13], SIR model was created
to analyze the effectiveness using the data from 15 European countries.
In general, most pandemic related models are an extension of the basic
SIR model proposed in [18]. This model is built on the premise that entire
population can be divided into three states: susceptible (S), infected (I), and
removed (R) states. The infected group continuously infects the population
3

until isolation is performed. The assumption requires the recovered population to receive 100% immunity. The SIR model follows a deterministic
model with linear infection rate. In [19], the authors modified the existing
SIR to be stochastic model and included vertical transmission and vaccination and non-linear incidence and vaccination. Current vaccination SIR
models mostly consider newborn vaccination as a result of previous and ongoing efforts. However, the principles could be similarly applied in similar
manner with slight modifications.
3. Mathematical Models
3.1. SIR Model
The basic SIR model without isolation and vaccination effect is given by
the following expressions
−βI(t)S(t)
dS(t)
=
,

N
dI(t)
βI(t)S(t)

= γI(t),
dt
N = S(t) + I(t) + R(t), ∀t,

(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)

where S(t) represents the number of people in an area at time t who are
susceptible to the disease infection and can be infected by the infectious people, I(t) represents the number of people in an area at time t who infected
and infectious due to the spread of the virus, R(t) represents the number of
people in an area at time t who are removed from the infected state, N is the
total number of people in the area at time t, β is a constant showing infectivity rate, i.e. expected number of people infected by an infectious person,
and γ is a constant showing removal rate, i.e. expected number of people removed from the infected state. The ratio of β and γ is called as reproduction
number, i.e. R0 = β/γ. Reproduction number shows the average number of
secondary infections coming from an infected person assuming everyone is in
susceptible state.
In practice, the constant β depends on how the society practice hygiene
and social distancing adhering to the standard operating procedure and the
constant γ is related to the people who have either recovered or deceased.

The initial number of susceptible people, S(t = 0) can be found using the
data released by the Government. From (4), we have S(t = 0) = N − R(t =
0) − I(t = 0). We can approximate I(t = 0) from the identification rate,
p and the average ratio of asymptomatic and symptomatic cases, ϕ. For
Malaysia, we assume a fixed ratio of asymptomatic and symptomatic cases,
i.e. ϕ = 0.7 [20]. Let X(t) be the number of new daily cases identified. The
approximate number of initial infected cases is I(t = 0) = X(t = 0)/p × 0.7.
3.2. Modified SIR Model
Fig. 1 depicts the proposed state diagram. We introduce a new term,
vaccination rate, d to the existing SIR model as shown in the figure. The
vaccination rate is defined as the ratio of target population and completion
time. This assumption is based on the demographic and logistical challenges
of administering the vaccines.
According to the state diagram and using the model from [21], we modify
the SIR model for the S(t) and R(t) expressions to be
βI(t)S(t)
dS(t)
= −d −
, s.t. S(t) > 0
dt
N

(5)

dR(t)
= d + γI(t).
dt

(6)

Note that we consider only the constant rate vaccination and ignore the
death rate (removed state is equivalent to recovered state) as the number of
deaths is small compared to the total population. In [21], the dynamics of the
vaccination is based on number of S(t). However, we know that vaccination
program will be progressive and based on a fixed rate on the remaining
susceptible class. We may assume that d is equivalent to an ersatz efficiency
in vaccination since no information on this is attained at the moment globally.
Further, we take into account the vaccine efficacy factor in the modified
S(t) and R(t) formulae. We introduce a multiplier factor  which is defined
as the ratio of the number of positive cases in the vaccinated samples and
the number of positive cases in the placebo samples during clinical trials.
Therefore, the vaccine efficacy is given by (1 − ). Expressions (5) and (6)
considering  factor are given by
βI(t)S(t)

dR(t)
= d(1 − ) + γI(t).

In case that self-isolation from random checks or contact tracing is conducted everyday, again, we need to re-modify the I(t) and R(t) expressions
in (2) and (8), respectively. Finally, we have the following SIR model which
incorporates vaccination and isolation strategies
dS(t)
βI(t)S(t)

where γ̂ = γ − p̂ and p̂ is the isolation rate of positive infected individuals in
the population. Note that the reproduction number is now R0 = β/γ̂.

initial number of new infected cases, X(t). We set 1 January 2021 as t = 0.
The data are obtained from Government website and other sources. We use
two reproduction numbers for simulations, R0 = 1.1 and R0 = 1.2. The
overall Malaysia R0 fluctuates between 1 and 1.5. The latest R0 projection
has been estimated to be average of 1.1 until 31 May 2021 [22]. Moreover,
we will use Runge-Kutta differential solver method to obtain the simulation
curve.
4.2. Malaysia Vaccination Program Details
Table 2 shows the vaccines delivery set by Malaysian Government. The
table only shows the confirmed purchases inked by the government while
many other negotiations are on-going. The government is also in final negotiations with China’s Sinovac for 14 million doses, CanSino Biologics for 3.5
million doses, and and Russia for 6.4 million shots of Sputnik V vaccine [23].
However, it is clear that most vaccines will arrive only in the second and
third quarter of 2021 onwards based on projections. In fact, the Malaysian
Government has expressed the desire to cover 80% of the population [24]. In
this paper, we assume that the vaccination rate is constant and that 75% of
the target population will be vaccinated within a year. The figure is reasonable as the inked deals have already covered almost 50% of the Malaysian
population (see the cumulative percentage in Table 2).
Since most vaccines have reported efficacy more than 70%, we will apply
75%-95% efficacy in our simulations. We assume 75% inoculation by end
t = 540 with the various efficacy rates. This would yield 0.13% vaccination
rate per day (18 months to complete 75% inoculation excluding those that
have received natural immunity due to recovery). We can see that vaccines
will be reserved for front liners and high risk populations in the first quarter
and almost none for the public. Hence, our simulation will start from the
second quarter of 2021. This is a proper figure to simulate the realistic

scenario. If vaccination is performed at mid February 2021, the effective
immunity will only be achieved by March 2021 (assume 15 days to reach
immunity).
5. Results and Discussion
5.1. Curve Fitting
The optimized parameters, β and γ̂, in (9), (10), and (11) are acquired
by curve-fitting the daily cases from 1 January 2021 to 11 January 2021 such
that the reproduction numbers are R0 = 1.1 and R0 = 1.2, following the
Government projection. The projected daily cases for 270 days is shown in
Fig. 2. Daily cases projection can be acquired by ∆R in the R compartment
of the population. We acquire this best fit by systematically combining
the parameters (grid search). Our best fit parameters give γ̂ = 0.08 with
β = 0.100 and β = 0.108 for R0 = 1.1 and R0 = 1.2, respectively.
Fig. 3 shows the removed cases projection without vaccination. It seems
to suggest at R0 = 1.1 and R0 = 1.2, both cases will only cause natural
immunity at 17% and 31%, respectively. This situation is based on the
premise that no new imported cases have been added into the community.
Note that herd immunity can only be reached if about 70% of the population
is immune to the virus. This is not recommended, of course, considering
that Malaysia has a comparatively high elderly (people over 60 years of age)
population, i.e. about 1.4 million.

5.2. Simulation Results
The projection plots for 270 days using the given population and vaccination data and formulae (9), (10), and (11) with R0 = 1.1 and R0 = 1.1 are
shown in Figs. 4 and 5, respectively. We observe three efficacy rates: 0.75,
0.85, and 0.95. It is worth mentioning that we apply a normalized population
i.e. N = 1.00 and the individual state is scaled respectively.
In Fig. 4, it can be seen that vaccination program is effective which is
shown by the big decrease in the percentage of population getting infected.
In other words, the curve gets flattened more rapidly at about 10 - 40 days
after day 90 (t = 90). Keep in mind that we assume that vaccination will
take place in the second quarter of 2021. In Fig. 5, we can observe similar
trend except with a more protruding curve due to higher production number.
Except for Sarawak, most of the cases show deviation of peak within 10-20
days. As observed, the amplitude (peak of curve) is also found to be lower
even in early stages of vaccination.
In both cases, the gradient of state I can be explained by observing (10).
The gradient will become negative when γ̂I(t) + p̂I(t) > βI(t)S(t)/N . The
difference between vaccination and non-vaccination mainly effects the S(t)
term, thereby causing the effect described earlier. We focus on the constant vaccination rate which decreases S(t) gradually but constantly at about
0.138% per day. At the end of the third quarter (t = 270), we will have
achieved approximately 25% vaccinated and received immunity excluding
those that have received immunity from recovery.
For overall Malaysia cases with R0 = 1.2 (see Fig. 5a), we observe that
peak for non-vaccination case is approximately at 1.7% of the total population while for vaccination case, the peak is around 0.7% of the population.
The difference is significant at 0.1%. This translates to 3.2 × 103 individuals. However, these conditions require that the infected case numbers
are highly accurate. Therefore, the effects of the vaccination demonstrated
by the simulations can be accepted as approximations. The difference between the two reproduction numbers produces peaks that are approximately
twofold for overall Malaysia cases (compare Figs. 4a and 5a). This shows
that vaccination program is effective despite the seemingly low vaccination
rate of 0.138% per day. Cumulatively, the effect increases as the susceptible
population receives immunity and moves to the removed class.
The effective daily cases simulation is shown in Fig. 6. For overall
Malaysia, in particular, it can be seen from Figs. 6a and 6b that with vaccination, both plots show peak at about 6,000 and 20,000 cases, respectively.

Therefore, it is important to comply with the standard operating procedure
issued by the World Health Organization (such as social distancing) to further reduce R0 . Similarly, plots for individual city or state show that peaks of
daily cases are mostly exceeding twofold. This shows that social distancing
is still much relevant and important in the fight to eradicate the pandemic
while the population gets vaccinated.

6. Conclusion
In this paper, we have used a modified SIR model to simulate the conditions with and without the vaccination program, and at various vaccine
efficacy levels.. The model applies minimal modification to the basic SIR
model and hence, tuning can be easily achieved. In particular, we modify
the existing SIR model to include a gradual vaccination which effectively
moves population from susceptible state to removed state. In the simulation,
we assume that the vaccination program will be gradual and progressive.
The results have shown that vaccination makes a significant difference in
combating the pandemic. With the global vaccination, we can for see that
the imported cases can even be reduced. In particular, we have presented a
few scenarios to predict infectious population and the daily cases in Malaysia.

In worse case scenario, e.g. R0 = 1.2, simulation results have shown
about 20,000 daily cases daily (with vaccination). Hence, lowering R0 is still
very relevant and should be done simultaneously with on-going vaccination
program. Based on this simulation, it is clear with the given description and
assumptions, there is huge benefit in the roll out of vaccination program in
Malaysia. Nevertheless, challenges may arise as the community may not want
to be vaccinated, since a third of Malaysians surveyed are not convinced of
the safety of COVID-19 vaccines. Therefore, community leaders should play
important role in educating the public.
Secondly, Malaysia has population of 32.7 million staying in rural areas
where access can be very challenging due to infrastructure problem. A lower
vaccination rate due to these circumstances may cause higher infection rates
as indicated in the simulation projections. Finally, similar methodology may
be extended to other countries to estimate the efficacy of vaccination on the
basis of their individual data.
