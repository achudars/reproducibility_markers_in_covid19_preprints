ABSTRACT
The rapid spread of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) confronts policy makers with the problem of measuring the effectiveness of
containment strategies, balancing public health considerations with the economic costs of social distancing measures. We
introduce a modified epidemic model that we name the controlled-SIR model, in which the disease reproduction rate evolves
dynamically in response to political and societal reactions. An analytic solution is presented. The model reproduces official
COVID-19 cases counts of a large number of regions and countries that surpassed the first peak of the outbreak. A single
unbiased feedback parameter is extracted from field data and used to formulate an index that measures the efficiency of
containment strategies (the CEI index). CEI values for a range of countries are given. For two variants of the controlled-SIR
model, detailed estimates of the total medical and socio-economic costs are evaluated over the entire course of the epidemic.
Costs comprise medical care cost, the economic cost of social distancing, as well as the economic value of lives saved. Under
plausible parameters, strict measures fare better than a hands-off policy. Strategies based on current case numbers lead to
substantially higher total costs than strategies based on the overall history of the epidemic.

Introduction
In March 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak a pandemic1 . In
response to the growth of infections and in particular to the exponential increase in deaths2 , a large number of countries were
put under lockdown, leading to an unprecedente recession3 which could potentially have longer term costs4 . In this situation
it is paramount to provide scientists, the general public and policy makers with reliable estimates of both the efficiency of
containment measures (e.g. social distancing and non-pharmaceutical health interventions), and the overall costs resulting from
alternative strategies.
The societal and political response to a major outbreak like COVID-19 is highly dynamic, changing often rapidly with
increasing case numbers. We propose to model the feedback of spontaneous societal and political reactions by a standard
epidemic model that is modified in one key point: the reproduction rate of the virus is not constant, but evolves over time
alongside with the disease in a way that leads to a ‘flattening of the curve’5 . The basis of our investigation is the SIR (Susceptible,
Infected, Recovered) model, which describes the evolution of a contagious disease for which immunity is substantially longer
than the time-scale of the outbreak6 . A negative feedback-loop between the severity of the outbreak and the reproduction
factor g is then introduced. As a function of the control strength αX , which unites the effect of individual, social and political
reactions to disease spreading, the difference between an uncontrolled epidemic (αX = 0) and a strongly contained outbreak
(large αX ) is described, as illustrated in Fig. 1a. The model, which we name controlled-SIR model due to the presence of the
control parameter αX , is validated using publicly available COVID-19 case counts from a large range of countries and regions.
We provide evidence for data collapse when case counts of distinct outbreaks are rescaled with regard to their peak values. A
comprehensive theoretical description based on an analytic solution of the controlled-SIR model is given. One finds substantial
differences in the country-specific intrinsic reproduction factor and its doubling time. The controlled-SIR model allows in
addition to formulate an unbiased benchmark for the effectiveness of containment measures, the containment efficiency index
(CEI).
The controlled-SIR model is thoroughly embedded in epidemiology modeling. Early on, the study of the dynamics of
measles epidemics7 has shown that human behavior needs to be taken into account8, 9 . In this regard, a range of extensions to
the underlying SIR model have been proposed, such as including the effect of vaccination, contact-frequency reduction and
1

quarantine10 , human mobility11 , self-isolation12 , the effects of social and geographic networks13 , the effects of awareness diffusion and epidemic propagation14, 15 , and the influence of explicit feedback loops16 . For an in-depth description, epidemiology
models need to cover a range of aspects17 , as the distinction between symptomatic and asymptomatic cases18 , which prevents
in general the possibility of an explicit analytic handling. In the present work we pursue the alternative approach of retaining a
minimal set of parameters, such that the resulting epidemiological model allows for an analytical description of the pandemic
and its socio-economical aspects.
Political efforts to contain the pandemic, as social-distancing measures and non-pharmaceutical health interventions, are
included in the controlled-SIR model as a dampening feedback mechanism. The controlled-SIR model is therefore suitable
to estimate the overall economic and health-related costs associated with distinct containment strategies, in particular when
accumulated over the entire course of an epidemic outbreak. This approach, which is followed here, extends classical studies
of the economic aspects of controlling contagious diseases. A central question regards in this context the weighting of the
economic costs of containment against the cost of treatment, and the loss of life19, 20 . For the value of life, statistical approaches
attribute suitably estimated monetary values to an avoided premature death21–23 . The resulting framework has been applied
to the Corona pandemic in several recent contributions in which the evolution of the epidemic has been taken in general as
exogenous24 , relying on estimates for the infection25 and case fatality rates26, 27 . Further studies have discussed the relative
effectiveness of control measures25, 28–31 , and the possible future course of the disease32, 33 .

Results
Controlled-SIR Model
In the following we introduce the model. At a given time t we denote with S = S(t) the fraction of susceptible (non-infected)
individuals and I = I(t) the fraction of the population that is currently ill (active cases). Infected individuals can either recover
or die as a consequence of the infection, here we subsume both outcomes under R = R(t), which denotes hence the fraction of
recovered or deceased individuals. Normalization demands S + I + R = 1 at all times. The continuous-time SIR model34
τ Ṡ = −gSI,

τ I˙ = (gS − 1)I,

τ Ṙ = I

(1)

describes an isolated epidemic outbreak characterized by a timescale τ and a dimensionless reproduction factor g. Social
and political reactions reduce the reproduction factor below its intrinsic (medical disease-growth) value, g0 . We describe this
functionality as
g=

g0
,
1 + αX X

X = 1−S,

(2)

where we generalized standard epidemiological approaches to nonlinear incidence rates35, 36 . The reaction to the epidemic
is taken to be triggered by the total fractional case count X (i.e. the sum of active, recovered and deceased cases), with αX
encoding the reaction strength. In the Methods section we show how this functionality is validated by COVID-19 data, see also
Fig. 2. In this view αX sums up the effects of an extended number of social processes and political action taking. Further below
we will examine in addition strategies for which the response is based on the fraction of actual active cases, I. We note that
containment due to a reduction in the reservoir of susceptible S, is of minor importance, given that COVID-19 infection cases
are generally small with respect to the overall population size.
The inverse functionality in equation (2) captures the law of diminishing returns, namely that it becomes progressively
harder to reduce g when increasing social distancing. In this view, small reductions of g are comparatively easy, however a
suppression by several orders of magnitude requires a near to total lockdown. We denote equation (1) together with (2) the
controlled-SIR model. Key to our investigation is the observation that one can integrate the controlled-SIR model analytically,
as shown in the Methods section, to obtain the phase-space relation
I=

αX + g0
1 + αX

This relation, which we denote the ‘XI representation’, is manifestly independent of the time scale τ.
The medical peak load Ipeak of actual infected cases is reached at a total fractional case count X = Xpeak , which is given by
gS = 1,

Xpeak =

g0 − 1
,
g0 + αX

(4)

For the case that αX = 0 (no control), Xpeak reduces to the well-known result Xpeak = (g0 − 1)/g0 .

Figure 1. XI representation of COVID-19 outbreaks. a, Model illustration. The closed phase-space expression I = I(X) of
actual infected cases I as a function of total infected cases X, as given by equation (3), is shown for two cases: αX = 0 (no
control, red line) and αX = 10 (long-term control, blue line) for an intrinsic reproduction factor of g0 = 3. The number of
infections is maximal at Ipeak (open circle), after starting at X = I = 0, with the epidemic ending when the number of actual
cases drops again to zero. At this point the number of infected reaches Xtot . The peak Xpeak = 2/3 of the uncontrolled case,
αX = 0, is sometimes called the ‘herd immunity’ point. The final fraction of infected is Xtot = 0.94. b, Model validation for a
choice of four countries/regions. The model (lines) fits the seven-day centered averages of COVID-19 case counts well. For
South Korea data till March 10 (2020) has been used for the XI-fit, at which point a transition from overall control to the
tracking of individuals is observable. c, Data collapse for ten countries/regions. Rescaling with the peak values Xpeak and Ipeak ,

reproduction factor Rt is compared to the effective reproduction factor gt as defined in equation (2). In a and b only data
between 0.1 ≤ X/Xpeak ≤ 2 is shown, with the lower bound discarding the strong fluctuations in the early stages of the
pandemic. The upper bound is used to define the termination of the first wave.
For αX = 0, Ipeak is sometimes called the ’herd immunity point’. The XI representation can be parameterized consequently
either by g0 and αX , as in equation (3), or indirectly by Xpeak and Ipeak , which are measurable (modulo undercounting). In
Fig. 1a an illustration of the XI-representation is given. For g0 = 3 and αX = 0 one has Xpeak = 2/3 and Ipeak ≈ 0.3. The total
fraction of infected Xtot is 94%, which implies that only about 6% of the population remains unaffected. Containment policies,
αX > 0, reduce these values. Fig. 1a and equation (5) illustrate a sometimes encountered misconception regarding the meaning
of the herd immunity point, which we have labeled simply Ipeak . The epidemic doesn’t stop at Ipeak since infections continue
beyond this point, albeit at a declining rate.
XI representation of COVID-19 outbreaks
In Fig. 1b,c we show for a representative choice of countries, regions and cities that COVID-19 outbreaks are described by the
controlled-SIR model to an remarkable degree of accuracy. For the analysis presented in Fig. 1b,c we divided, as described in
the Methods section, the official case counts by the nominal population size of the respective region or country. Seven-day
centered averages are performed in addition. The country- and region-specific XI representations are then fitted by equation (3).
The fact that the outbreaks are well described by the model, independently of the size of the country, region or city, evidences
the applicability of the controlled-SIR model.
It has been widely discussed that official case counts are affected by a range of factors, which include the availability of
testing facilities and the difficulty to estimate the relative fraction of unreported cases38, 39 . For example, as of mid-March 2020,
the degree of testing for COVID-19, as measured by the proportion of the entire population, varied by a factor of 20 between
the United States (340 tests per million) and South Korea (6100 tests per million)40 . The true incidence might be, according to
some estimates41 higher by up-to a factor of ten than the numbers reported in the official statistics as positive.
Case counts enter the XI representation in both the x− and y− axis. Scaling both I and X with a constant factor allows
therefore to compensate for the undercounting problem. At the same time the control strength αX needs to be rescaled, a
procedure implicitly implemented for the fits shown in Fig. 1b,c. The XI framework is in this sense robust. Renormalization
becomes however invalid if the undercounting of infection cases changes abruptly at a certain point during the epidemics, f.i. as
a result of substantially increased testing. We will come back to this point further below. A fundamental change in the strategy
4/22

followed by the government, e.g. from laissez faire to restrictive, would lead likewise to a change in αX , which is not captured
in the current framework.
In the analysis presented in Fig. 1 daily case counts were taken as proxies for the number (relative fraction), of infected
individuals I = I(t). This assumption holds only up to a rescaling factor, which implies that the g0 extracted for a given country
or region is not the native, but an effective reproduction factor. To see this consider, e.g., the initial slope, I ∼ X(g0 − 1)/g0 ,
as given by equation (15). Rescaling daily case counts in order to obtain estimates for the number of infected individuals
changes the slope and hence g0 . Given that the appropriate rescaling of daily case counts can only be estimated, and that we
are interested here in a simple but accurate effective modeling of COVID-19 outbreaks, and not in the extraction of the native
reproduction factor, we did not pursue this route.
In Table 1 we present for a number of countries and regions the obtained effective growth factors g0 and the corresponding
doubling times τ2 , where τ2 = log(2)/ log(g0 ) defines the number of time units τ needed to double case numbers. As expected,
according to the description above, one finds that the values of g0 are substantially lower than the consensus estimates 2-3 for
the native reproduction number42–46 . The observed doubling times τ2 are however retained when adapting the effective time
scale τ accordingly.
For a robustness check we evaluated the parameters of the controlled-SIR model assuming that only a fraction f of the
nominal population of the country or region in question could be potentially infected, possibly due to the presence of social or
geographical barriers to the disease spreading. Only marginal differences were found for f = 1/3. The data presented in Table 1
suggest most countries followed in the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic strict containment policies, as measured in terms
of the CEI index. This insight is of particular relevance for the discussion of the costs incurring for the various containment
strategies presented further below.
Data collapse for COVID-19
Given that the XI representation is determined solely by two quantities, Xpeak and Ipeak , universal data collapse can be attained
by plotting field data normalized with regard to the respective peak values, viz by plotting I/Ipeak as a function of X/Xpeak .
It is remarkable, to which degree the country- and region specific official case counts coincide in relative units, see Fig. 1c.
It implies that the controlled-SIR model constitutes a faithful phase-space representation of epidemic spreading subject to
socio-political containment efforts.
Asymmetry of up-/down time scales
For the controlled SIR model an explicit analytic expression for the X − I phase space representation can be derived, as given
by equation (3), but not for the complete timeline X(t) and I(t). Exploiting the fact that case counts are generally small with
respect to the population for real-world epidemic outbreaks, the universal relation

between the time the outbreak needs to retreat from the peak, and to reach it in first place, can however be found, as shown
in the Methods section. Interestingly, the ratio of down-/ and up-times is independent of the control strength αX (if and only
if X  1), which suggests that equation (6) is valid for epidemic outbreaks in general. For COVID-19, typical values of the
effective g0 are of the order of 1.2-1.3, as listed in Table 1, which implies that outbreaks take of the order of 40-60% longer to
retreat than to ramp up.
Containment efficiency index
The control strength αX enters the reproduction factor as αX X, see equation (2). Data collapse suggest that regional and countrywise data is comparable on a relative basis. From αX X = (αX Xpeak )(X/Xpeak ) it follows that αX Xpeak = αX (g0 − 1)/(g0 + αX )
is a quantity that measures the combined efficiency of socio-political efforts to contain an outbreak. Dividing by g0 − 1 results
in a normalized index, the ‘Containment Efficiency Index’ (CEI):
CEI =

αX Xpeak
αX
=
,
g0 − 1
g0 + αX

(7)

with CEI ∈ [0, 1]. The index is unbiased, being based solely on case count statistics, and not on additional socio-political
quantifiers. Our estimates are given in Table 1. The values for the evaluated regions/ countries are consistently high, close to
unity, the upper bound, indicating that the near-to-total lockdown policies implemented by most countries have been effective
in containing the spread of COVID-19. A somewhat reduced CEI value is found for the particularly strongly affected Italian
region of Bergamo. For South Korea the CEI is so high that its deviation from unity cannot be measured with confidence.
Long-term vs. short-term control
So far, in equation (2) it was assumed that society and policy makers react to the total case count of infected X. This reaction
pattern, which one may denote as ‘long-term control’, describes field data well. It is nevertheless of interest to examine an
alternative, short-term control:

g=

g0 /(1 + αI I)
g0 /(1 + αX X)

(short-term)
(long-term)

(8)

For short-term control the relevant yardstick is given by the actual case number of infected I. In reality, people will react to
officially reported case counts, which are affected by the undercounting problem. For the terms αI I and and αX X in equation
(8) this corresponds to a renormalization of reaction parameters αI and αX .
Both control types, short- and long-term, can be employed either for the continuous-time SIR model, equation (1), or for
the discrete-time variant,
∞

It+1 = ρt It (1 − Xt ),

Xt =

∑ It−k ,

(9)

k=0

The time-dependent reproduction factor has been denoted here as ρt , in order to make clear that discrete times are used. Shortand long-term control is then equivalent to ρt = ρ0 /(1 + αI I) and ρt = ρ0 /(1 + αX X). One time step corresponds for the
discrete-time SIR model to the mean infectious period.
The simulations of equation (9) presented in Fig. 3 illustrate the capability of short-term and long-term reaction policies
to contain an epidemic. While both strategies are able to lower the peak of the outbreak with respect to the uncontrolled
(αX = αI = 0) case, the disease will become close to endemic when the reaction is based on the actual number of cases, It , and
not on the overall history of the outbreak.
Also included in the lower panel of Fig. 3 is a protocol simulating an increase of testing by a factor of two. Here
(αX , αI ) = (400, 0) and (αX , αI ) = (0, 400) have been used as the starting reaction strengths, respectively for long- and shortterm control, which are increased by a factor of two when testing reduces the undercounting ratio by one half. One observes
that long-term control is robust, in the sense that increased testing contributes proportionally to the containment of the outbreak.
Strategies reacting to daily case number are in contrast likely to produce an endemic state.
The framework developed here, equations (1) and (2), describes mass control strategies, which are necessary when overly
large case numbers do not allow to track individual infections. The framework is not applicable once infection rates are reduced
to controllable levels by social distancing measures. The horizontal ’tail’ evident in the data from South Korea in Fig. 1b can be
taken as evidence of such a shift from long-term mass control to the tracking of individual cases.

Figure 3. Control of epidemic peak. a, Shown is the timeline of actual infected cases during an epidemic outbreak with an
intrinsic reproduction factor of ρ0 = 3.0 defined in the discrete model, which is close to COVID-19 estimates47 . The simulation
is obtained by iterating equation (9), with one iteration corresponding to two weeks, taken as the average duration of the illness.
Short-term control, when responding to the actual number of cases, see equation (8), is able to reduce the peak strain on the
hospital system, but only by prolonging substantially the overall duration. Long-term control, which takes the entire history of
the outbreak into account, is able to reduce both the peak and the duration of the epidemic. b, Increasing testing by a factor two
(arrow), reduces the undercounting factor which increases, in turn, the effective response strength for both, the peak number of
actual cases and the duration of the outbreak. Here (αX , αI ) = (400, 0) / (0, 400) has been used respectively for
long- / short-term control.

Costs of controlling the COVID-19 pandemic
As shown above, the controlled-SIR model allows for a faithful modeling of the entire course of an isolated outbreak. We apply
it now to investigate how distinct policies and societal reaction patterns, as embedded in the parameter αX , influence the overall
costs of the epidemic. This is an inter-temporal approach since the cost of restrictions today to public life (lockdowns, closure
of schools, etc.) must be set against future gains in terms of lower infections (less intensive hospital care, fewer deaths). Four
elements dominate the cost structure: (i) The working time lost due to an infection, (ii) the direct medical costs of infections,
(iii) the value of life costs, and (iv) the cost related to ‘social distancing’. The first three are medical or health-related. All
costs can be scaled in terms of GDP per capita (GDPp.c. ). This makes our analysis applicable not only to the US, but to most
countries with similar GDPp.c. , e.g. most OECD countries.
Overall cost estimates
The cost estimates, which are given in detail in the Supplementary Information, can be performed disregarding discounting.
With market interest rates close to zero and the comparatively short time period over which the epidemic plays out, a social
discount rate between 3% and 5% would make little difference over the course of one year48 .
Total health costs Cmedical incurring over the duration of the epidemic are proportional to the overall fraction Xtot = Xt→∞ of
infected, with a factor of proportionality k. We hence have Cmedical = kXtot . We estimate k ≈ 0.305 in terms of GDPp.c. when
all three contributions (working-time lost, direct medical cost, value of life) are taken into account, and k ≈ 0.14 when value of
life costs are omitted.
The economic costs induced by social-distancing measures, Csocial , depend in a non-linear way on the evolution of new

reduction of economic activity is percentage-wise directly proportional to the relative reduction in the reproduction factor49 , viz

where 2/52 is the per year fraction of 2-week quarantine period. The epidemic is considered to be under control when
the fraction of new infections It falls below a minimal value Imin . As detailed out in the Supplementary Information, a
comprehensive analysis yields m ≈ 0.25 in terms of GDPp.c. . Note that the ansatz equation (10) holds only when mass control
is operative, viz when large case numbers do not allow the tracking of individual infections.
Once k and m are known, one can compare the total costs incurring as the result of distinct policies by computing the sum
of future costs for different values for αX in equation (2). This is illustrated in Fig. 4 with the value of life costs included
(k = 0.305), and in Fig. 5, without value of life costs (k = 0.14). Given are the total cumulative costs for the two strategies
considered, long-term and short-term control, both as a function of the respective implementation strength, as expressed by the
value of αX and αI .
The middle panel of Fig. 4 shows that a society focused on short-term successes will incur substantially higher medical
costs, because restrictions are relaxed soon after the peak. By contrast, if policy (and individual behavior) is influenced by the
total number of all cases experienced so far, restrictions will not be relaxed prematurely and the medical costs will be lower
for all values of αX . The bottom panel shows the social distancing costs as a fraction of GDPp.c. , which represent a more
complicated trade-off between the severity of the restrictions and the time they need to be maintained. If neither policy, nor
individuals react to the spread of the disease (αX = 0) the epidemic will take its course and costs are solely medical. This
changes as soon as society reacts, i.e. as αX increases. Social distancing costs increase initially (i.e. for small values of αX ),
somewhat stronger for the long-term than for the short-term reaction framework. The situation reverses for higher values of αX
and αI with αX , αI ≈ 30 being the turning point. From there on, the distancing cost from a long-term based reaction falls below
that of the short-term strategy. The sum of the two costs is shown in the uppermost panel. For large values of αX , αI short-term
policies result in systematically higher costs.

Figure 5. Cost of epidemic control without value of life. As in Fig. 4 (bottom panels are identical), but without the value of
life costs. A long-term strategy with intermediate reaction strength is costlier than a hands-off policy.

Supplementary Figure 1 of the Supplementary Information shows that short-term control cannot explain observed COVID19 outbreaks per se. Our estimates for the incurring costs suggest that economic cost considerations may have caused countries
to follow predominantly long-term control strategies during the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak.

Discussion
The total costs of competing containment strategies can be estimated if the feedback of socio-political measures can be modeled.
For this one needs two ingredients: (i) a validated epidemiological model and (ii) a link between the impact of containment
efforts, in terms of model parameters, to their economic costs. Regarding the first aspect, we studied the controlled-SIR model
and showed that COVID-19 outbreaks follow in many cases the phase-space trajectory, the XI representation, predicted by
the analytic solution. The same holds for the 2015 MERS outbreak in South Korea, as shown in Fig. 6b. We extracted for a
number of countries and regions estimates for the intrinsic doubling times and found that they are not correlated to the severity
of the outbreak. Regarding the second aspect, we proposed that the economic costs of social distancing are proportional to the
achieved reduction in the infection rate49 . Equation (10) establishes the required link between epidemiology, political actions
and economic consequences. Health-related costs, which are related to official case counts, are in contrast comparatively easier
to estimate. We have not considered formally the optimal control problem, which would consist of minimising the sum of total
costs if the control strength could be chosen freely for every period. Instead, we have been interested here in comparing distinct
containment strategies under which society and governments react in a predictable pattern to the spread of the disease.
A non-trivial outcome of our study is that strong suppression strategies lead to lower total costs than taking no action, when
containment efforts are not relaxed with falling infection rates. A short-term control approach of softening containment with
falling numbers of new cases is likely to lead to a prolonged endemic period. With regard to the ‘exit strategy’ discussion,
these findings imply that social distancing provisions need to be replaced by measures with comparative containment power. A
prime candidate is in this regard to ramp up testing capabilities to historically unprecedented levels, several orders of magnitude
above pre-Corona levels. The epidemic can be contained when most new cases are tracked, as implicitly expressed by the
factor αX . This strategy can be implemented once infection rates are reduced to controllable levels by social distancing
measures. Containment would benefit if the social or physical separation of the ‘endangered’ part of the population from the
‘not endangered’ would be organized in addition on a country-wide level, as suggested by community-epidemiology. With this
set of actions the vaccine-free period can be bridged.
As a last note, there is a sometimes voiced misconception regarding the meaning of the herd immunity point, which occurs
for an infection factor of three when 66% of the population is infected. Beyond the herd immunity point, the infected-case
counts remain elevated for a considerable time. The outbreak stops completely only once 94% of the population has been
infected, as illustrated in Fig. 1a.

Methods
Validation of the model from COVID-19 data
In Fig. 2 we show how the model given in equation (2) is validated by COVID-19 data. Fig. 2a displays the collected data of
infected population during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in a range of representative countries and regions. Plotted
is the time-dependent reproduction factor Rt as a function of the relative cumulative case count X/Xpeak . We followed standard
procedures37 and defined Rt as the fraction of newly infected individuals at time t with respect to the infected individuals at
time t − 4 days, Rt = I t /I t−4 , where seven-day centered moving averages I t = ∑t+3
s=t−3 Is are considered. Also shown is a fit
to the data using the functional form predicted by our model, equation (2). The quantitative comparison between field data
and modeling validates the controlled-SIR model. For a set of representative countries and regions it is shown in Fig. 2b that
there is a direct correlation between the measured reproduction factor Rt and the effective reproduction factor gt , as defined by
equation (2).
Data collection and handling
Data has been accessed as of May 18 (2020) via the public COVID-19 Github repository of the Johns Hopkins Center of
Systems Science and Engineering50 . Preprocessing was kept minimal, comprising only a basic smoothing with sliding averages.
If not stated otherwise, a seven time centered average (three days before/after, plus current day) has been used. Robustness
checks with one, three and five day sliding averages were performed, as shown in Fig. 1d. Fractional case counts are obtained
by dividing the raw number by the respective population size. For the case of South Korea, the XI-analysis was performed
using the initial outbreak, up to March 10 (2020). China has been ommitted in view of the change in case count methodolgy
mid February 2020.
The variable I represents in the SIR model the fraction of the population that is infectious, which for this model coincides
with the infected population. For the COVID-19 data, we used instead an XI-representation for which the number of new daily
cases is plotted against the total case count. This procedure is admissible as long as the relative duration of the infectious period
does not change.
Fitting procedure
We compared the theoretical result for the controlled SIR model, I(X) ≡ I (theory) (X), see equation (3), to the reported data

, where t runs over all days. The field data Xt
for the total case number is crowded at low levels of X and I in the XI
representation. A fitting procedure that takes the range X ∈ [0, Xtot ] uniformly into account is attained when minimizing the
weighted loss function

For the weight we used ut = Xt
− Xt−1 = It
, which satisfies the sum-rule ∑t ut = Xtot , where Xtot is the total (maximal)
case count. With equation (11) it becomes irrelevant where the timeline of field data is truncated, both at the start or at the end.
Adding a large number of null measurements after the epidemic stopped would not alter the result. Numerically the minimum
of U as a function of g0 and αX is evaluated.
Modeling field data as uncontrolled outbreaks
It is of interest to examine to which degree official case statistics could be modeled using an uncontrolled model, αX = 0. For
this purpose it is necessary to assume that the epidemics stops on its own, which implies that one needs to normalize the official
case counts not with respect to the actual population, but with respect to a fictitious population size N. In this view the outbreak
starts and ends in a socially or geographically restricted community. The results obtained when optimizing N are included in
Fig. 6a. At first sight, the αX = 0 curve tracks the field data. Note however the very small effective population sizes, which are
found to be 478000 for the case of Germany. Alternatively one may adjust g0 by hand during the course of an epidemic, as it is
often done when modeling field data.

Figure 6. Case count modelling. a, Modeling case counts as uncontrolled outbreaks. Case counts, here for Germany
(seven-day centered averages, dots), can be modeled using either the full XI representation (full line), as given by equation (3),
or with the standard uncontrolled SIR model (αX = 0, dashed lines). Using the nominal population size for Germany, 83
Million, leads to an utterly unrealistic αX = 0 curve (dashed, grey). The best αX = 0 fit is obtained when a fictitious population
size of 478 Thousand is assumed (dashed, black). An epidemic abates on its own only when the population size is of the order
of the total case count divided by Xtot . b, XI representation of the 2015 MERS outbreak in South Korea, covering a total of 186

where the integration constant c is given by the condition I(S = 1) = 0. Substituting S = 1 − X one obtains consequently the
XI-representation equation (3). The analogous result for αX = 0 has been derived earlier51 . The number of actual cases, I,
vanishes both when X = 0, the starting point of the outbreak, and when the epidemic stops. The overall number of cases, Xtot , is
obtained consequently by the non-trivial root Xtot of equation (3), as illustrated in Fig. 1a. As a side remark, we mention that
the XI representation allows us to reduce equation (1) to

which is one dimensional. Integrating equation (13) with g = g(S) yields S = S(t), from which I(t) follows via τ I˙ = gS − 1 I
and R(t) from the normalization condition S + I + R = 1.

which makes clear that the phase-space trajectory becomes an inverted parabola when infection fractions are small. As a
consequence one finds
I≈

(15)

which shows that the slope dI/dX = (g0 − 1)/g0 at X → 0 is independent of αX and of the normalization procedure used for I
and X. The first result was to be expected, as αX incorporates the reaction to the outbreak, which implies that αX contributes

only to higher order. The dimensionless natural growth factor g0 is hence uniquely determined, modulo the noise inherent in
field data, by measuring the slope of the daily case numbers with respect to the cumulative case count.

Time scale asymmetry
From the one-dimensional representation (13) of the controlled SIR model one can estimates two characteristic time scales. For
this purpose one considers an initial relative infection status fX Xtot , with fX > 0 and fX  1.
– run-up: Tup , defined as the time needed to reach the peak when starting from Xstart = fX Xtot .
– run-down: Tdown , defined as the time needed to reach Xend = (1 − fX )Xtot , down from the peak.
In general one needs to integrate equation (13) numerically. Given that real-world fractional case counts X are small,
X < Xtot  1, one can simplify (13), as for (14), obtaining

It follows directly that Tdown /Tup = 2g0 − 1, as stated in equation (6). For a pathogen to spread its dimensional growth factor g0
needs to be larger than unity, compare Table 1. Going down takes hence substantially longer than ramping up.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION
Societal reaction to the spread of the disease
The two strategies investigated here, short-term and long-term, correspond to reaction patterns that are observed for the
COVID-19 outbreak52, 53 . In Supplementary Figure 1 we present some examples. For both cases, the societal reaction described
by the parameter αX and αI can be thought as a sum of two contributions
αX = αs + αg ,

(19)

where αs quantifies the spontaneous reaction by the population and αg encodes government interventions. Analogously, such a
sum of two contributions can be made for αI .
The first contribution, αs , takes into account societal behavioral changes happening when a substantial fraction of the
population spontaneously adopts social distancing (avoiding hand-shakes, restaurants, cinemas, etc.), f.i. in response to media
reports about the severity of the outbreak. Voluntary social distancing can lead to substantially reduced restaurants and cinemas
attendances even before governments impose mandatory school closures, curfews and other drastic measures.54 An important
aspect of the spread of COVID-19 is the distinct reactions of societies in different countries. In Asia the wearing of masks
becomes a convention, which is likely to correspond to a higher αs , while such a measure tends to be resisted by a majority of
European populations.55
The second contribution to the control factor, αg , captures the role of government interventions. Measures ranging
from forbidding large events, to school closures and, finally, to lockdowns, become politically possible when the number of
individuals infected increases and surpasses critical levels.
The aim of our investigation is not to evaluate the effectiveness of specific measures, which has been done elsewhere25, 28 ,
but to assess the dynamical effect of the societal reaction encoded in the feedback parameter αX , on the overall evolution of the
epidemic. As most social distancing measures are costly, both for the economy and overall well-being56 , it is reasonable to
assume that their strictness is increased only when necessary, viz in relation to the severity of the outbreak. The latter can be
measured either by the number of current cases, It , or by the cumulative case count Xt .
The inverted U shape of the total cost of the virus as a function of αX has one important corollary: the ’laissez faire’
equilibrium is not the optimum for society. If the government abstains from action leaving it to societal reaction to dampen the
peak, the spread of the disease would be limited only by αs , which might bring society close to the hump of the total cost curve.
Strong government action, i.e. a high value of αg could then push the path to the other side of the hump resulting in lower costs.
In other words, relying only on individual reaction which aims at lowering the risk to oneself, would be sub-optimal. This is
of course a general result for all contagious diseases19, 20 but we confirm it accounting explicitly for the cost of the measures
needed to protect public health.
Detailed costs of controlling the COVID-19 pandemic
In what follows we present a detailed estimation of the costs of controlling the COVID-19 pandemic given in GDP per capita
(GDPp.c. ) to ensure comparability across countries.
Four elements dominate the cost structure: (i) The working time lost due to an infection, (ii) the direct medical costs of
infections, (iii) the value of life costs, and (iv) the cost related to ‘social distancing’. The first three are medical or health-related.
Health costs, loss of working time
A first direct impact of a wave of infections is that a fraction of the population cannot work. Based on the Diamond Princess
data57 , where the entire population was tested, we estimate that only half of the infected develop symptoms that require them
to stay home for a one- to two-week period and an additional two-week period until they are no longer contagious. About
20% of the infected (or 40% of those with symptoms) develop stronger symptoms requiring one additional period of absence
from work27 . To be conservative, we assume that there are no severe cases or deaths among the working age. This results in a
reduction in the work force per year (52 weeks) of around (0.3 × 2 + 0.2 × 3) × (2/52) = 2.4/52 = 0.05, for every 1% of the
population infected.
Medical costs, treatment, hospitalization
Hospitalization rates and costs of hospital treatment for COVID-19 vary enormously across across countries. But it is estimated
that about 20%58 of the infected individuals require some sort of hospitalization. A recent large scale survey of the literature59
shows that about one fourth of them (around 5% of the infected) need intensive care and roughly on sixth dying. We adopt a
more conservative fatality rate among the hospitalized of 1%57 .
As a comparison, we note that an average influenza season leads to a hospitalization of about 0.12% of the US population60 ;
and one fourth of them require intensive care, with one twentieth (0.13% of all infected) dying57 . Averaged over the 2010-17,
17/22

of the order of 35 thousand influenza-related deaths per year have been registered in the US, one tenth of the over 300 thousand
COVID-19 related fatalities registered in 2020.
Costs: Intensive care with ventilation is the most costly form of life saving in hospital care59 . In the US, the cost of two
weeks of an intensive care unit is equivalent to about 1 year (100%) of GDPp.c. 61 . For Covid-19 patients in the US, it has been
reported that average hospitalisation costs per case amount to over 70 thousand USD, or 115% of (annual) GDP per capita62 .
In Germany, which might be typical of the rest of Europe, the cost of two weeks of intensive care appears to be lower,
around 20,000 Euro, or roughly 60% of GDPp.c. 63 . We use the German parameters for a conservative estimate of medical
costs. The cost of general hospitalization for two weeks is assumed to be 12,000 Euro, and equivalent to about 30% of GDPp.c. .
With two weeks of general hospitalization and two weeks of intensive care for severe cases, this results in a medical cost of
(0.05 × 0.6 + 0.05 × 0.3 + 0.15 × 0.3 = 0.09), that is of 9% GDPp.c. .
Value of lives lost
Third, the cost of premature death through the disease represents the most difficult element to evaluate in financial terms. We
will show below that our central results remain valid even without assigning a monetary value to lives lost, but since major
contributions24 are based on an evaluation of the economic value of lives lost, we show how this point can be incorporated
into our framework. There are two ways to attribute a monetary value on a life saved or lost. The first, mentioned in the main
text, is based on the concept of a Value of Statistical Life (VSL), which is commonly used in the impact assessment of public
policy that aims at lowering the probability of a premature death64 . A typical application scenario for VSL is the case when the
probability of death is very low (e.g. car accidents), but could be lowered even more (seat belts). For COVID-19, a high-death
epidemic, we prefer a medical-based approach, which allows us to produce conservative estimates. VSL arrives in contrast
often at much higher values, up to millions of Euro or Dollars65 . Putting a monetary value on lives saved is unavoidable in
medical practice that is confronted with the problem of selecting the procedures to be used to prolong life - a situation that
arises for many patients infected by the Coronavirus under intensive care.
The literature dealing with the cost of medical procedures finds a central range of between 100,000 and 300,000 Dollars per
year of life lost66, 67 . Given the current US GDPp.c. , these values translate into a range of 1.5 to 4 years of GDPp.c. . Cutler and
Richardson68 argue for a value equivalent to three times GDPp.c. . We use the lower bound of this range (i.e. 1.5 times GDPp.c. )
for most of our simulations, which might thus under-estimated the value of lives saved through social distancing restrictions.
What remains to be determined is the number of years lost when a Corona patient dies.
On the cruise ship Diamond Princess26, 57 which served almost as a laboratory, the average age at death was 76 years. Cruise
passengers tend to have fewer acute health conditions than the general population, thus rendering the co-morbidity argument
less prominent. The remaining life expectancy (weighted by the difference incidence by sex) would thus be 11 years. This
implies that the economic value of the premature deaths should be equal to about 11 times the loss for one year of life saved
(potentially higher for most European countries which tend to have a higher life expectancy).
For each 1% of the population the value of lives lost would thus be equal to 0.01 × 11× the nominal value of one year of
life.
The value of life can be measured in terms of multiples of GDPp.c. , which allows to write the sum of the three types of
health or medical costs (loss of working time, hospitalization and value of lives lost) as a linear function of the percentage of
the population infected:
ctmed = kIt
with a proportionality factor k being equal to the sum of the three contributions. Scaling k with the GDPp.c. allows for an
application and comparison across countries. Using the lower bound of the central range yields then the following calibration
of the medical costs:
(0.05 + 0.09 + 0.01 × 1.5 × 11) × GDPp.c.
0.305 × GDPp.c.

=
(20)

The upper bound for the value of k would be substantially higher: (0.05 + 0.09 + 0.01 × 4 × 11) × GDPp.c. = 0.58 × GDPp.c. .
For the numerical calculations we will use the conservative estimate k = 0.305 in terms of GDPp.c. .
If we only consider the direct medical costs consisting of loss of working time and hospitalization, without including the
value of lives lost, the proportionality factor in equation (20) reduces to k = 0.14 in terms of GDPp.c. .
Medical costs over the lifetime of the epidemic
The cost estimates discussed so far, ctmed , refer to the per-period cost of the currently infected. For the total cost over the entire
endemic we need to calculate the discounted sum of all ctmed over time. Given that a period corresponds to about two weeks, we
neglect discounting, which would make little difference even if one uses a social discount rate of 5% instead of using market
18/22

rates (which may be negative). The total medical costs over the course of the endemic can be written as the simple sum of the
cost per unit of time:
Cmedical =

∑

ctmed = kXtot .

(21)

It >Imin

The epidemic is considered to have stopped when the fraction of new infections It falls below a minimal value, Imin .
Using the conservative estimate (low value of life) k = 0.305 it is straightforward to evaluate the total cost of a policy of not
reacting at all to the spread of the disease, which would lead in the end to Xtot = 0.94. A hands-off policy would therefore lead
to medical costs of over 28% of GDP.
In absolute terms the cost of a policy of doing nothing would amount to 1000 billion Euro for a country like Germany. For
the US the sum would be closer to 5 Trillion of Dollars (25% of a GDP of 20 Trillion of Dollars). As it would not be possible
to ramp up hospital capacity in the short time given the rapid spread of the disease, the cost would be in reality substantially
higher, together with the death toll24, 25 . We abstract from the question of medical capacity (limited number of hospital beds)
because we assume that society would react anyway as the virus spreads, thus limiting the peak, and, second, we are interested
in the longer term implications of different strategies and not just in their impact on the short-term peak.
We note that even concentrating only on the direct medical cost and working time lost (k=0.14) a policy of letting the
epidemic run its course through the entire population would lead to losses of working time and hospital treatment of over 13%
of GDP (94% of 14%). By comparison, total health expenditure in most European countries amounts in normal times to about
11% of GDP69 . Even apart from ethical considerations, to avoid or not potentially hundreds of thousands of premature deaths,
there exists thus an economic incentive to slow the spread of the COVID-19 virus.
Given the somewhat contentious nature of the value of lives lost, we present in the middle panel of Fig. 4 of the main
text the medical cost estimates (as a proportion of GDP) without including the value of life costs (results with including the
value of life costs are shown in the main text). As shown in the figure, increasing αX leads to a lower medical cost because the
percentage of the population infected will be lower. The difference between short-term and long-term control increases for
higher values of αX . At these αX values the medical cost over the entire endemic would be lower because the overall fraction of
infected population is lower. For a strongly reactive society and policy i.e. for αX  1 (and the case of long-term control), an
explicit solution for the total health cost is given by,
Cmedical = kXtot

αX 1

≈ 2k

g0 − 1
αX

(22)

which implies that the total health or medical costs are inversely proportional to the strength of the policy reaction parameter.
Draconian measures from the start, i.e. with αX going towards infinity, reduce the medical costs to close to zero - irrespective of
whether one adds the value of lives lost. This can be seen in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 of the main text, where the medical cost (over the
entire epidemic) starts for αX = 0 at values close to k because without any societal reaction 94% of the population would get
infected and with increasing αX the medical costs decline monotonously.
Social distancing costs
The economic costs of imposing social distancing on a wider population are at the core of policy discussions and drive financial
markets. As mentioned above, social distancing can take many forms; ranging from abstaining from travel or restaurant meals
to government interventions enforcing lockdowns, quarantine, closure of schools, etc. This cost is more difficult to estimate.
However, a rough estimate is possible if one takes into account that most economic activity involves some social interactions.
Limiting social interaction thus necessarily reduces economic activity. This suggests that the economic cost of the social
distancing described in equation (2) of the main text should increase with the reduction in the transmission rate described by g.
Without any social distancing, αX = 0, the economy would not be affected by the spread of the virus. Stopping all economic
social interactions would bring the economy to a halt, but the reproduction rate of the virus would also go close to zero
(Eichenbaum et al.70 make a similar assumption). We thus posit that the (per-time unit) social-distancing economic cost cts is
proportional to the reduction in the transmission rate. The total economic costs Csocial can be written as the sum of cts :


ρt 2
Csocial = ∑ cts ,
cts = m 1 −
(23)
ρ0 52
It >Imin
considering here the notation of the discrete-time controlled SIR model (equation (8)). The key question is the factor of
proportionality, m, which links the severity of social distancing to the reduction in economic activity. Popular attention has
focused on services linked directly to social contact. There exist indeed selected sectors which will completely shut down
under a lockdown. However, these sectors (tourism, non-food retail, etc.) account for a limited share of the economy (less than
19/22

10% for most countries). Expenditure for food is actually little affected since even under the most severe lockdown, grocery
shopping is still allowed and families must consume more food at home as they cannot go out to restaurants.
The manufacturing sector is less affected by social distancing than the service sector because in modern factories workers
are scattered over a large factory floor, making it relatively easy to maintain production while maintaining the appropriate
distance between workers. Moreover, some sectors, e.g. finance, can work online with only a limited effect on productivity.
The widespread impression that the entire economy stops under a lockdown is thus not correct. The drastic measures adopted in
China illustrate this proposition: when all non-essential social interactions were forbidden, industrial production and retail sales
fell by ’only’ 20-25%71 while the reproduction factor went from 3 to 0.3, a fall by a factor of ten. Using this experience we
calibrate the parameter m at 0.25. The projections of the International Monetary Fund, a loss of output of about 8% for severe
lockdowns lasting one quarter3 ,72 confirm this order of magnitude.
A reduction in the reproduction factor ρt to one tenth its normal epidemiological value of ρ0 would thus lead to a loss of
GDP of 25% for the time period during which the restriction or social distancing measures are in place. This would imply that
an abrupt shutdown of the economy to 25% of its capacity for 12 weeks, or 6 incubation periods would cost about 0.25×(12/52),
or about 6% of annual GDP. A reduction of GDP by 6% represents a recession even deeper than the one which followed the
financial crisis of 2009. This is compatible with current forecasts of zero GDP growth in China in 2020 (relative to a baseline
of 5-6% before the crisis). But even such a large cost in terms of output foregone would be below the medical cost arising from
herd immunity73 . Even apart from ethical considerations, it would thus appear to make sense to accept a temporary shut down
of parts of the economy to avoid the huge medical costs.
A first result is thus that if one compares two extremes: letting contagion run its course (herd immunity) or draconian
measures, the social costs are lower in the second case. Small changes to the key parameters, k and m, might change the exact
values of the costs in terms of overall magnitude, but the ranking appears robust.
We do not consider separately the fiscal cost, i.e. the cost for the government to save millions of enterprises from bankruptcy
and ensure that workers have a replacement income when they get laid off. This cost to governments is a transfer within the
country from one part of society (tax payers) to those who suffer most under the economic crisis.
A key issue in the discussion on the economic cost of social distancing is the question about how long these measures need
to be maintained. It is sometimes argued that the cost of a policy of social distancing would be unacceptably high because the
measures could not be relaxed until the virus had been totally eradicated. However, this pessimism is not warranted by the
success of a strategy of ‘testing and tracing’ implemented in some countries (mainly those which had experienced SARS). Such
a strategy is, of course, only possible if the starting number of infections is low enough to allow for individual tracing.
We thus make the assumption that when the number of active cases falls below a certain threshold, the costly measures of
general social distance containment are no longer needed and can be substituted by pro-active repeated testing coupled to quick
follow-up of the remaining few cases which are quarantined and whose contacts are quickly traced. In this case the resulting
economic cost is assumed to fall away. The experience of Taiwan74 , Korea75 and Japan suggests that when the infected are less
than one per 100,000, general social distancing is no longer required (assuming mass testing has been adopted in the meantime
so that the infections can be accurately measured).
Parameter updating
The estimates on which our results are based will have to be updated when actualized COVID-19 data is available in the future.
The WHO-China Joint Mission Report suggests a ρ0 (g0 in the continuous-time representation) per infected of 2 − 2.576 (in
units of the disease duration), while we use the figures from Liu et al.47 , who predict a reproduction factor of around three. The
numbers for the forecast of health costs are derived in part from the Diamond Princess data57 , for which the population was
comparatively healthy. The statistics for symptoms requiring the absence from work may therefore in reality be somewhat
higher.
The hospitalization and mortality rate are estimated with a substantial uncertainty, due to the high numbers of unregistered
and untested infections. Early studies based on official data from China77, 78 estimated that the number of actual infections may
be between 10 to 20 times higher than the number of detected infections. However, serological test in e.g. Austria suggest only
a factor of 379 . The continuing screening of blood samples via the US, Nationwide Commercial Laboratory Seroprevalence
Survey, showed in September 2020 an average undercounting factor of 2.6, as opposed to our assumption of 2. Leaving possibly
lower, but still substantial true hospitalization and mortality rates for COVID-19.
A strong age gradient has been observed for the case fatality rate of COVID-19 by age80 , which could be logistic81 , and
there are large variations across countries82 . Moreover, one has to take into account that while case fatality rates are much
lower for the younger, they are represent a larger share of the population and their life expectancy is also higher (e.g. over
20 years for the 60 years old). These two factors tend to give more weight to the younger age brackets, leading to resulting
parameter estimates similar to ours83 .
One of our main goals has been the introduction of a generic framework, which can be updated by further advances in the
accuracy of estimates while still presenting specific results with the data available at this time.

Relation to further studies
A range of determining factors have been examined for the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic, in particular the effect of quarantine84
and that community-level social distancing may be more important than the social distancing of individuals85 . An agent-based
model for Australia found, in this regard, that school closures may not be decisive18 . Microsimulation models suggest, on the
other hand, that a substantial range of non-pharmaceutical interventions might be needed for an effective containment of the
COVID-19 outbreak25 .
We also note attempts to derive disease transmission rates from economic principles of behavior70 , which would allow to
measure the cost of the Corona pandemic under different policy settings. Another strand of the literature takes the pandemic as
given, and as the basis for scenarios for the economic impact and for the financial-market volatility86, 87 .
