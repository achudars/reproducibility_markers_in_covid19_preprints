In the absence of any proper clinical solution, human civilization is only left with sophisticated
intervention measures to contain the spread of COVID-19. However, the existing models to
estimate the intervention does not take into account the realistic connectivity of the epicentres of
the pandemic. We generalise our earlier model of interacting hotspots to test various possibilities
of intervention in a model state consisting of multiple epicentres. We also analyse situations when
the hotspots are spatially correlated and the interaction is limited to population exchanges with
the nearest neighbours. We show that the heterogeneity in the infection propagation is solely
dependent on the protocol of the containment and its strength. We explore many such situations
and discuss possibilities.
Keywords: COVID-19, SARS-COV-2

The transportation of the infected persons can lead to
large scale community transmissions during a pandemic
situation[1]. Therefore, to avoid world-wide transmission, most of the countries have sealed the borders with
their neighbours, stopping every-other non-essential activities for more than a fortnight[2]. However, millions of
poeple have travelled from China, and through different
countries, to every part of the globe between the very
first report of the disease from Wuhan and the date of
imposition of lockdown at a global scale[1, 2].
The simplest approach to predict the spread of such
pandemic uses familiar methods of inflammatory response model of epidemic that considers deterministic
temporal evolution of epidemic variables including different categories of states[3]. For instance, the standard
SIR model uses three states: A person in susceptible (S)
category can pass to a category Infected (I) at a rate
β while the infected person can pass to a category Recovered (R) at a rate γ. In recent times, researchers
have developed different multi-state models that takes
into account a range of complex variables and numerous
possibilities of intermediate states[2, 4, 5]. On the other
hand, stochastic [6, 8] and data-driven approaches[7] use
network based analysis to explore the role of stochastic
transportation in the dispersal of the virus. Combination of both of the techniques sometimes give surprisingly
good agreement with the data [7, 8].
Therefore, realistic theoretical models genuinely need
to consider the inclusion of realistic human mobility between the regions of exposure in order to estimate the
spatial spread of the epidemic at a larger scale. This is
an extremely challenging task as every traffic flow between the communities in a region creates local disturbances, jeopardizing the global balance. Maintaining the
global conservation away from equilibrium further needs
assurance of dynamical equilibrium at a global scale, even
when local regions are destabilized by each of the intercommunity movements.
Here, we explore various possibilities of community

transmission in presence of intervention, generalising
our earlier model of interacting hotspots[9]. We propose a set of generalised deterministic equations with
inter-community transport that govern the spread in epidemic. The community transport, eventually, is realised
via stochastic exchanges of populations between regions,
maintaining a conservation at local scale. The set of
stochastic moves successfully ensure long time global
equilibrium. We show that complexity of the transport
protocol govern the heterogeneity in the infection propagation that defines the overall scale of containment. We
also discuss the nature of mitigation process when such
hotspots are spatially correlated at nearest neighbour.
The model can be easily integrated with most of the epidemic models that exist in the literature.
We start with Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR)
model that considers the transition from S to I and I
to R with rates β and γ respectively. Taking into account the newborns and the natural deaths, the evolution
equation for a hotspot becomes
dS

= − SI + ξN − λS

where ξ is the rate of growth of population due to addition of newborns and λ is the rate of death of susceptible
persons, and also of persons who have recovered from the
epidemic, due to other natural causes.

where ζ is the rate of death of infected persons. This
also includes the natural deaths. γ is the recovery rate

Now we think of a model system of interacting
hotspots that exchange population due to inter-city
transportation[10]. Let there be M number of cities, each
identified by an index i (i = 1, 2, 3, . . . . . . ., M ) . Eqs.(1)

Data show that, globally, from the total number of persons infected by SARS – COV -2 up to a certain day, 12
-15% have recovered and 3% have died. Thus ζ << γ,
and we may, for a first approximation ignore the term ζI i
in Eqs. (6) and (10). Data also reveal that in many countries (especially, in Europe) the total population has remained more or less constant over the last decade. Thus
we may assume that ξN i − λS i ≈ 0. We also note that
ηRi  γ I i ; so the term λRi may be dropped from (7)

together with Eqs.(9), (11) and (13). The coefficients
f ij etc. are not known a priori. They can be determined
only after fitting (by trial and error method) the solutions for S i , I i and Ri to data. This will be an extremely
time consuming process, fraught with uncertainties. Instead of proceeding along this line, we adopt a stochastic plus deterministic approach to deal with Eqs. (14) –
(16). First we consider random exchanges of population
(which could be S, I, R or both) between the cities. We
update the population after M
2 moves. Then, we solve
Eqs. (14) – (16) without the flow terms using RungeKutta-4(RK-4) method[13]. We consider three protocols
of community transmission due to transportation of the
population from one city to another:
• CASE-I: We consider M
2 numbers of pairwise exchanges of I between the cities i and j by updating I i and I j to I˜i (= ηI I i + fI (1 − ηI ) (I i + I j ))
and I˜j (= ηI I j + (1 − fI ) (1 − ηI ) (I i + I j )) respectively before we integrate the evolution equations as in earlier work[9]. The exchange conserve the local populations, I˜i + I˜j = I i + I j and
Ñ i + Ñ j = N i + N j .
• CASE-II: We consider M
2 numbers of pairwise exchanges of S (given by (a)) and R (given by (b))
stochastically, with equal probabilities(=0.5) before we integrate the evolution equations.
(a) The susceptible populations in city i (=S i )
fi (= ηS S i +
and j (=S j ) are updated to S
i
j
f
j
fS (1 − ηS ) (S + S )) and S (= ηS S j + (1 −
fS ) (1 − ηI ) (S i +S j )), conserving S̃ i + S̃ j = S i +S j
and Ñ i + Ñ j = N i + N j .

3
(b) Similarly, the recovered populations in another
set of randomly chosen cities i (=Ri ) and j (=Rj )
fi (= ηR Ri + fR (1 − ηR ) (Ri +Rj ))
are updated to R
j
f
j
and R (= ηR R + (1 − fR ) (1 − ηI ) (Ri + Rj )) conserving R̃i + R̃j = Ri +Rj and Ñ i + Ñ j = N i +N j .
• CASE-III: We consider M
2 numbers of pairwise
inter-city exchanges of S, I and R, stochastically,
with equal probabilities(= 13 ), before we integrate
the evolution equations in each time step.
(a) The susceptible populations in city i (=S i )
fi (= ηS S i +
and j (=S j ) are updated to S
fj (= ηS S j + (1 −
fS (1 − ηS ) (S i + S j )) and S
i
j
fS ) (1 − ηI ) (S +S )), conserving S̃ i + S̃ j = S i +S j
and Ñ i + Ñ j = N i + N j .
(b) The infected population between the cities
i and j are updated from I i and I j to I˜i (=
ηI I i + fI (1 − ηI ) (I i + I j )) and I˜j (= ηI I j + (1 −
fI ) (1 − ηI ) (I i + I j )) respectively before we integrate the evolution equations from t to t + 1 as
in earlier work[9]. The exchange conserve the local populations, I˜i + I˜j = I i + I j and Ñ i + Ñ j =
Ni + Nj.
(c) Similarly, the recovered populations in another
set of randomly chosen cities i (=Ri ) and j (=Rj )
fi (= ηR Ri + fR (1 − ηR ) (Ri +Rj ))
are updated to R
fj (= ηR Rj + (1 − fR ) (1 − ηI ) (Ri + Rj )) conand R
serving R̃i + R̃j = Ri +Rj and Ñ i + Ñ j = N i +N j .
We use the connectivity parameter. η = ηS = ηI =
ηR ∈ [0, 1] for simplicity, in the same way as in [9]. The
random fractions, fS , fI and fR are random numbers
∈ [0, 1][? ]. We test the initial condition as N i = 1,
Ri = 0, I i = 10− 4 and S i = N i − I i − Ri at t = 0 for all
i. Hence, the numbers that we quote in the paper is in
the units of N i (0)(= 1) as in [9].
In Fig.1, we show the evolution of the infected population, I in the state consisting of M = 64 cities for
different cases. For CASE-I, the temporal evolution of
I(t) for all the cities are shown in Figs. 1(a) and (b)
for η = 0.5 and η = 0 respectively when only exchange
of infected population is allowed. In each of the cases,
the peaks in infected population in different cities take
place at different times as indicated by the diffusion of
data points. The diffused line around t ≈ 50 show the
heterogeneity in the infection propagation. For CASE-II,
the behavior changes for both the values of η(= 0.5 and
0). We show this in Figs. 1(c-d) when the exchange of
Susceptible (S) and Recovered (R) populations destabilize the infection propagation indirectly. This behaviour
is quite surprising as the direct exchange of infected populations between the cities is ruled out. Yet, for η = 0,
the prominent secondary peaks in the infection appear
at later times in more than one city suggesting strong
heterogeneity due to increasing disorder which is may be
due to the complex coupling that exists between I and
S, R. This becomes more prominent for CASE-III when

FIG. 1. Temporal evolution of Infected population (I) for different cities in a state consisting of M = 64 cities (a-b) when
only exchange of I is allowed with (a)η = 0.5 (b)η = 0, (c-d)
when exchanges of S,R are allowed with equal probabilities
with (c)η = 0.5 (d)η = 0 (e-f) when all the exchanges of S,
I and R are allowed with equal probabilities with (e)η = 0.5
(f)η = 0.

all three types of populations commute between the cities
(Fig. 1(c-d)). The different behaviour in the individual
cities becomes more diffused for both η = 0.5 (Fig. 1(e))
and η = 0 (Fig. 1(f)). However, in this case, many
peaks have significantly smaller numbers with respect to
the other cases, suggesting the role of the exchange in
mediating disorder.
We show the evolution of the Probability distribution
functions of the infected population, P (I, t) in Fig. 2
for the respective cases shown in Fig.1. For all the
cases, P (I; t) is a delta function at t = 0, peaked at
the initial values of the infection count at t = 0, which
is uniform and identical in the given scenario. For all
the cases, we see that there is a spread in the distribution with increasing elapsed time upto a maximum
limit. The maximal spread in the distribution behaves
non-monotonically with increasing t, peaked at t ≈ 50
for CASE-I with η = 0.5 [Fig. 2(a)], when clear spread
up to I ≈ 0.18 is seen. This shoots up to I ≈ 0.3 for
the case with η = 0 in Fig. 1(b). This suggests that the
probability to have large peak infection increases with
increasing η. This particular trend is also observed for
CASE-II for both η = 0.5 [Fig.2(c)] and η = 0 [Fig.2(d)].
The large asymmetry with respect to the peak infection
in the evolution process suggest that even the exchange of
both S and R between the cities can impact the recovery

process when the recovery process dominates at large t.
At significantly large t(= 125), there exist large probability to have very largely infected cities in the state which
was not there earlier for CASE-I. For CASE-III, we see
similar evolution for both η = 0.5 and η = 0. We also
observe the similar asymmetric nature of the evolution
that exist for CASE-II, emphasizing the slow recovery
process.
We now discuss the evolution of the first (< I >)
and second moment (χ2 ) of the probability distribution, P (I; t), of infected populations in different cities,
in Fig. 3. The
R instantaneous mean infected population,
< I(t) > (= dIIP (I; t)) and the fluctuation contained
in the distribution, χ2 (t)(=< I(t)2 > − < I(t) >2 ) for
different cases are shown in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b) respectively. Inset. Fig: 3(a) shows the evolution of < I > for
cases with η = 1 which are eventually identical as all the
cities retain all three categories of population.
For all these cases, < I > has a peak at t = 50 with
value < I >≈ 0.06. As the exchanges take place, the nature of the evolution of < I > changes. For CASE-I with
η = 0.5, the peak in < I > has a similar value (≈ 0.06)
with no significant asymmetry around the peak. For
η = 0, the peak in < I > decreases by a small amount.
Also small asymmetry around the peak for < I > is observed. For CASE-II, we see a small pre-peak in < I >
at t ≈ 30, before < I > reaches the peak at t ≈ 50 for
η = 0.5. For η = 0, the height of the peak in < I >
decreases significantly (with value ≈ 0.04). The distribution also shifts towards higher t and develops large asym-

metry with respect to the peak. For CASE-III, < I > has
a peak around t ≈ 50 with notable asymmetry around
η = 0.5. Again, the height of the peak in < I > decreases significantly for η = 0. < I > also shows very
large asymmetry with respect to the peak.
We now show the evolution of χ2 (t) for the respective
cases of Fig.2. For CASE-I, χ2 has a peak at t ≈ 50 with
value (≈ 0.004) for η = 0.5 and no significant asymmetry
is observed. For η = 0, the peak in χ2 grows higher.
For CASE-II, the height of the peak in χ2 for η = 0.5
has similar values for CASE-I. However, for η = 0, the
peak in χ2 decreases significantly and develops significant
asymmetry for CASE-II. The end of epidemic is defined
for χ2 → 0 when all the cities behave identically. This
happens at a fairly large t after the peak that χ2 develops.
For CASE-III, peak in χ2 has values smaller than that
for η = 0.5 for CASE-II. For η = 0, the height in χ2
decrease significantly and later slowly decays with t and
χ2 → 0 at significantly large t.

5
largely infected populations. At long times, t = 120,
there still exist a few relatively small patches of infected
populations that decay very slowly for CASE-III [Fig.
4(f)] which is not present for CASE-I. For CASE-II, the
situation is somewhat intermediate.

FIG. 4. Time evolution of the spatial maps of the infected
populations in cities with nearest neighbour exchange at (a)
t = 0 (CASE-I) (b)t = 30 (CASE-I)(c-e) t = 80 (c) CASE-I
(d) CASE-II (e) CASE-III (f)t = 120 (CASE-III) with η = 0.

We now test the three cases (CASE-I, CASE-II and
CASE-III) in a state, consisting of 10X10 cities (X, Y ∈
L), spatially located in a grid of length L = 10 where
each node is a representative of a city that follows similar
equations of evolution. In contrast to earlier situations,
the cities are now only allowed to exchange populations
with the randomly chosen nearest neighbours following
the identical governing rules (CASES-I,II and III) with
η = 0. In order to understand the dynamics of a realistic
scenario, we choose a specific initial condition where only
one randomly selected city has very large infected population (I = 0.2) while others have very small infected
cases (with I = 10−6 ) at t = 0.
The initial map of the infected populations in the
cities is shown in Fig. 4 (a) which is identical for the
three different trajectories following CASE-I, CASE-II
and CASE-III. For all the three trajectories, the spatial
maps are mostly identical for small t. We show the map
of I(X, Y ) for t = 30 in Fig. 4(b). The very high population at the initial city undergoes diffusion within this
time window. No signature of the initial high value remains beyond t = 30. The situation is mostly similar for
all the trajectories for different CASES. We now show the
maps of I(X, Y ) in Figs. 4(c-e) at t = 80 for CASE-I, II
and III respectively. I(X, Y ) contains many populated
cities for CASE-I [Fig. 4(c)] while largely heterogeneous
patches are seen in Fig. 4(d) for CASE-II. The map in
Fig. 4(e) for CASE-III, has also many large patches of

FIG. 5. (Colour Online) Time evolution of < I > with t for
CASE-I (Orange Solid line), CASE-II (Grey solid line) and
CASE-III (Green solid line) in a system that has one epicentre
at t = 0 in a two dimensional (10X10) spatial grid of cities
with nearest neighbour interaction.

In Fig. 5. we now show the behavior of < I > [Fig.
5(a)] and χ2 [Fig.5(b)] with t for the three cases shown in
Fig. 4. < I > has a value 6= 0 at t = 0 which is obvious.
The initial decay in < I > also persist up to t ≈ 30. The
peak in < I > grows in a similar manner. However, for
CASE-II, the height of the peak in < I > is observed
to be maximum while CASE-III has the slowest decay
with increasing t[Fig. 5(a)]. The trend of data for χ2 is
qualitatively similar to that for < I >[Fig. 5(b)]. The
height of the maximum in χ2 is found to be maximum
for CASE-II, at t ≈ 80 due to existence of strong heterogeneity as seen in Fig. 4(d). For CASE-III, the decay in
χ2 is observed to be the slowest which is also affirmed by

6
the existence of the patches at t = 120 in Fig. 4(f).
In summary, we analyse the dynamics of interacting
epicentres with intervention in a state using different protocols. The interaction was modelled using imposed disorder by exchanges of population of different kinds between the cities while the intervention parameter takes
care of the fraction of population that a city retains before an exchange. We show that it is possible to control the heterogeneity in the infection propagation using
the interplay between the intervention parameter and the
complexity in the protocol. The control of heterogeneity
essentially governs the fate of the containment strategy
for the epidemic. The exchange model that we envisage
here can easily be integrated with the existing models
that takes care of many intermediate states between infection and recovery[4, 5, 14–17]. Thus, the model is pivotal in shaping state-of-the-art non-pharmaceutical solutions to control the spread of the pandemic COVID-19.

[11] In each timestep, we generate M trial moves of pairwise population exchanges. We only accept the moves if
the distance between the randomly chosen cities is = 1,
without the periodic boundary condition. Also, we ensure
that movement of a single category (also chosen stochastically) of population is allowed between the randomly
chosen pair of cities, in a single move. For CASE-II, exchange of categories S and R is taken with equal probabilities (=0.5). The probability for each of the categories(
S, I and R), for CASE-III is 31 .
