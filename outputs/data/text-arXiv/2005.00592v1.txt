Integrated Time Series Summarization and Prediction Algorithm
and its Application to COVID-19 Data Mining

Abstract— This paper proposes a simple method to extract
from a set of multiple related time series a compressed
representation for each time series based on statistics for the
entire set of all time series. This is achieved by a hierarchical
algorithm that first generates an alphabet of shapelets based on
the segmentation of centroids for clustered data, before labels of
these shapelets are assigned to the segmentation of each single
time series via nearest neighbor search using unconstrained
dynamic time warping as distance measure to deal with nonuniform time series lenghts. Thereby, a sequence of labels is
assigned for each time series. Completion of the last label
sequence permits prediction of individual time series. Proposed
method is evaluated on two global COVID-19 datasets, first,
for the number of daily net cases (daily new infections minus
daily recoveries), and, second, for the number of daily deaths
attributed to COVID-19 as of April 27, 2020. The first dataset
involves 249 time series for different countries, each of length
96. The second dataset involves 264 time series, each of
length 96. Based on detected anomalies in available data a
decentralized exit strategy from lockdowns is advocated.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Data mining is the task to extract higher level information
from raw data [1]. In general, data can be available in
manifold form. In this paper, the focus is on time series
data mining [2].
Given a set of multiple time series it is desirable in
many applications to extract information in compressed or
simplified form while still being representative. This task
can be referred to as summarization, where essential features
are retained that “fit on a single page, computer screen, or
executive summary, etc” [3]. Another popular task is time
series prediction [4]. It is natural to ask for a method that
addresses both combinedly. There are two basic approaches:
model-based and model-free algorithms. For the former,
“model fitting” or “system identification” is the term used in
the automatic control field for estimating dynamical models
based on measurements of the system’s input and output
signals [5], which can then be used for predction and control.
The disadvantage is that a priori assumptions (an “educated
guess”) on the mathematical model need first to be made,
which requires data domain expertise. Therefore, the second
model-free approach is here preferred.
Henceforth, the motivation and contribution of this paper
is to present an integrated algorithm for both model-free time
series summarization and prediction. The second aspect is its
application to real world data from the recent COronaVIrus
Disease 2019 (COVID-19) for both global net daily infections and daily deaths for the time period from January 23
until April 27, 2020.
For many different model-free time series data mining
tasks there are three essential building blocks (basic analysis
techniques) that frequently recur throughout the literature,
and which will also serve as foundation for proposed method.
These are clustering, segmentation and similarity measures.
Related literature is here briefly summarized.

The well-known K-means algorithm [9] does not offer
any accuracy guarantess, but its simplicity and speed make
it appealing for clustering. Furthermore, by modification of
the initialization scheme the algorithm called K-means++
can be obtained which is O(log K)-competitive with the
optimal clustering [6]. Typically, the number of clusters K is
prescribed as a hyperparameter. However, there are methods
to also learn K, for example, via the “Elbow method” or the
“Silhouette method” [10]. Variants of the K-means algorithm
belong to the class of partitioning clustering. In general, there
are other clustering classes such as hierarchical, spectral,
density-based clustering and more [11]. For a survey on
clustering for time series see [12].
Time series segmentation can be useful for a plethora
of applications such as dimensionality reduction for the
handling of very long time series or motif discovery. It
is also closely related to (and may in the literature be
interchangeably called) “changepoint detection”, “breakpoint
detection” or “event detection” [13]. Segment boundaries
can be interpreted as the changepoints where characteristic
behavior changes. Typically, the number of segments or a
desired upper bound thereof is specified as a hyperparameter.
It can be further distinguished between model-based and
model-free approaches. For example, for the former class,
in [14] piecewise affine time series approximations are used
for their segmentation logic. A recent model-free approach
inspired by a posteriori optimal trading was presented in [7].
The choice of similarity measure (also referred to as
distance measure) [15] plays an important role in many time
series data mining algorithms, including for subsequence
matching and similarity search [16], time series classification
[17] and also for aforementioned clustering. By far the
most common similarity measure used for time series is the
Euclidean distance (ED). Another popular choice is dynamic

time warping (DTW) [8]. It has shown excellent performance
on supervised time series classification tasks in combination
with “nearest neighbor search” when its hyperparameter–the
warping window–is learned on a training dataset (typically
via “leave-one-out cross-validation”) [18]. Furthermore and
in contrast to ED, DTW offers the advantage to compute a
distance between two time series of different lengths.
The remaining paper is organized as follows. The problem
is formulated mathematically in §II. The proposed solution
is presented in §III. Numerical results are evaluated in §IV,
before concluding with §V.
II. P ROBLEM F ORMULATION
The problem addressed is twofold; First, the development
of an integrated data mining algorithm for summarization and
prediction that extracts information from a set of multiple
related time series. Second, its application to real-world
data from the COronaVIrus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) [19].
While time series differ for different countries, all COVID19 time series are related by a common cause. Two case
studies for both global net daily infections and daily deaths
serve for evaluation of proposed method.
Given a set of N time series of uniform length T ,
−1 N −1
{{xi (t)}Tt=0
}i=0 , with xi (t) ∈ R, an algorithm is sought
that returns four primary outputs. These are a compressed
representation of each time series that consists of, first,
i −1 N −1
a sequence of labels, {{li (p)}P
p=0 }i=0 , with li (p) ∈
N+ , second, a sequence of segmentation time instants,
N −1
i
{{τi (p)}P
p=0 }i=0 , with τi (p) ∈ N+ , τi (0) = 0 and
τi (Pi ) = T − 1, third, a prediction for each time series,
T −1+∆ti N −1
{{xpred
with prediction horizon ∆ti ∈
i (t)}t=T −1 }i=0
N++ , which in general may vary for each time series i =
0, . . . , N − 1, and, finally, corresponding prediction labels
−1
{lipred }N
i=0 . Secondary outputs, which can be considered as
a byproduct of the main algorithm, are, first, a set of K
−1 K−1
centroid time series, {{c̄k (t)}Tt=0
}k=0 , with c̄k (t) ∈ R,
second, a sequence of segmentation time instants for these
K−1
k
centroids, {{τ̄k (q)}Q
q=0 }k=0 , and third, assignments of each
time series to clusters associated with each centroid, I(i) ∈
{0, . . . , K − 1}, ∀i = 0, . . . , N − 1.

−1 N −1
{{xi (t)}Tt=0
}i=0 , is clustered via aforementioned Kmeans++ algorithm [6]. This step maps the data input to a
−1 K−1
set of K centroids, {{c̄k (t)}Tt=0
}k=0 , whereby the resulting
number of obtained clusters can be less than a provided
hyperparameter upper bound, i.e., K ≤ K max . This is since
an unconstrained K-means++ implementation permits in
an overall cost-minimizing fashion to return some emptyvalued clusters (which are consequently discarded), in case
K max is selected conservatively large or the underlying data
is very discriminating (which is the case for COVID-19).
N −1
Step 1 of Algorithm 1 also returns {I(i)}i=0
, the indexing
assignment of each time series to a cluster with I(i) ∈
{0, . . . , K − 1}. While this information is not exploited
further, it is kept as part of the time series summarization.

This section is organized by first stating proposed algorithm, before elaborating on the design of substeps.
A. Integrated Summarization and Prediction Algorithm
Algorithm 1 summarizes suggested method and is called
ISPA (Integrated Summarization and Prediction Algorithm).
For time series mining of raw data the common preprocessing step is to z-normalize. Thus, denoting raw data
with a superscript,
data input to Algorithm 1 typically is

it was observed that omission of z-normalization clearly
clarified clustering results. This is explained by the fact
that available data is so strongly discriminating for different
countries with variations in orders of magnitude. Some
regions report numbers in single digits, while other countries
report in the hundreds or even thousands.
The objective of Steps 1-3 in Algorithm 1 is to
learn an alphabet of overall data-characterizing shapelets
(short segments or subsequences). These are obtained from
centroids after a clustering step. Therefore, data input,

In Steps 3 the alphabet of shapelets is generated by segmenting all centroids with APTS [7]. Here, a simplified basic
implementation with a reduced number of hyperparameters
is employed, which is summarized in Algorithm 2. In Step 1
a normalization is carried out in order to render time series
data positive, which is a prerequisite for used segmentation

logic. First, channel-wise data is z-normalized, before a
linear transformation is applied, x̃i (t) = xi (t) + x̃offset
, ∀t =
i
0, . . . , T − 1, with x̃offset
= |mint∈{0,...,T −1} xi (t)| + 1.
i
The fundamental idea of APTS is to treat normalized time
series as a surrogate stock that can be traded optimally a
posteriori in virtual portfolio holding either cash or stock
[20]. The resulting rebalancing time instances are recorded as
the segmentation time instants, which consequently typically
appear at local peaks and bottoms. For ease of reference the
derivation of the main mapping, F trade (·) in Algorithm 2, is
here repeated from [7, §III.A].
Channel-wise surrogate wealth dynamics are introduced
that model a virtual portfolio holding either a virtual cash
position or the “stock” modeled by the channel-wise normalized time series. Therefore, a four-dimensional state vector is
defined, zi (t) = [ni (t), ci (t), bi (t), wi (t)], where ni (t) ≥ 0
models the number of shares held at time t, ci (t) ≥ 0 the
cash position, bi (t) ∈ {−1, 1} the binary state indicating
full investment in cash or stock, respectively, and finally
wi (t) ≥ 0 denoting total wealth at time t. In contrast to
regular stock trading for our surrogate setup the number of
shares, ni (t) ≥ 0, is real-valued. At t = 0 the state vector
i (0)
i (0)
is initialized with zi (0) = [0, x̃1−
, − 1, x̃1−
], where
i
i
i ∈ [0, 1) is interpreted as a linear transaction cost level.
This initialization implies an initial cash position sufficient
to buy one share when accounting for transaction cost and
is defined this way to avoid adding scaling hyperparameters.
Then, introducing a control variable, ui (t) ∈ {−1, 1}, state
transition dynamics are defined as,

for zi (t) ∈ {zi (t) ∈ R4 : bi (t) = 1}. Combinedly, (1)(2) model all four possible transitions between full cash and
full stock investment subject to linear transaction costs. In
a causal setting x̃i (t + 1) is not known at time t. However,
in the batch setting it is available, which is equivalent to
perfect one step-ahead knowledge a posteriori. Therefore,
and due to the fact of a positive x̃i (t) by above discussion
there always exists a wealth-maximizing trading trajectory
from t = 0 to T as a function of transaction cost level
i ≥ 0 such that wi (T ) is channel-wise maximized. This
trajectory can be computed efficiently as follows. Starting
from zi (0) defined above, at t = 1 two possible states can

result which differ by binary bi (1) ∈ {−1, 1}. Let these two
(1)
(−1)
states be denoted by zi (1) and zi (1), respectively. Then,
by Bellman’s principle of optimality and with the purpose
of deriving the wealth-maximizing trading trajectory the
following recursion can be implemented for all t ≥ 1. When
(−1)
(1)
x̃i (t + 1) becomes available, zi (t) and zi (t) branch out
to a total of four different states according to (1)-(2). These
are pruned to two by selecting the wi (t + 1)-maximizing
solutions for each bi (t+1) = −1 and bi (t+1) = 1 such that
(−1)
(1)
zi (t + 1) and zi (t + 1) are obtained, respectively. Their
corresponding optimal parent states are further recorded,
(−1),parent
(1),parent
which shall be denoted by zi
(t) and zi
(t).
(−1)
This recursion is repeated until t = T . Given zi (T )
(1)
(−1)
(1)
and zi (T ) let b?i (T ) = −1 if wi (T ) > wi (T ), and
?
bi (T ) = 1 otherwise. Now, using the list of optimal parent
(−1),parent
(1),parent
−1
−1
states, {zi
(t)}Tt=1
and {zi
(t)}Tt=1
, the optimal wealth-maximizing trading trajectory can be obtained
by backpropagation, resulting in {b?i (t)}Tt=0 . In the following, F trade ({x̃i (t)}Tt=0 , i ) shall abbreviate the mapping from
{x̃i (t)}Tt=0 to {b?i (t)}Tt=0 as a function of i > 0.
Via the choice of i the frequency of segmentation time
instants can be controlled. The larger i the fewer segments.
This explains the design of Steps 2-12 in Algorithm 2 in
combination with user-provided hyperparameter S max , which
defines the maximum desired number of segmentation time
instants. Starting from i = 0 the corresponding number
of segments is computed. Should this exceed S max the
transaction cost proxy i is increased according to Step 12.
By default the step size is here selected as ∆i = 0.01.
The iteration in Algorithm 2 is guaranteed to terminate for
S max > 2 since the number of segments is guaranteed to be
monotonously decreasing with increasing i [7].
Hyperparameter ∆τ min in Step 5 and 9 was introduced
specifically for volatile COVID-19 data to ensure that the
last segment (which is consequently used for prediction via
nearest neighbor search as outlined below) has a minimum
length of at least ∆τ min time steps.
Shapelets returned by Steps 1-3 of ISPA are given by
τ̄k (q+1)
{c̄k (t)}t=τ̄
, ∀q = 0, . . . , Qk − 1, ∀k = 0, . . . , K − 1,
k (q)
wereby boundary segmentation time instants are defined with
τ̄k (0) = 0 and τ̄k (Qk ) = T − 1 for all k = 0, . . . , K − 1.
Shapelets are indexed with kS max + q, ∀k = 0, . . . , K, ∀q =
0, . . . , S max . Eventhough it typically results Qk < S max , the
indexing method using S max is used in order to retain a
simple formula (instead of defining an additional array for
storage of the number of segments for each cluster).
Steps 4-8 of Algorithm 1 determine the segmentations for
each of the N time series, before the closest shapelet from
the alphabet of shapelets is assigned to each segment via
a nearest neighbor search for a given similarity measure.
In detail, after application of APTS, segments are described
τi (p+1)
by {xi (t)}t=τ
, ∀p = 0, . . . , Pi − 1, ∀i = 0, . . . , N − 1.
i (p)
In order to determine the closest shapelet from the set of
all centroid segments (the alphabet of reference segments),
a standard nearest neighbor search is conducted employing
unconstrained DTW to compute a quadratic error function
for time series of different lengths. Because of its widespread
usage DTW is here not further discussed, and it is referred
to [8]. Two comments are made. First, unconstrained DTW
is suitable since segments typically include very few time
instants. This is beneficial in the sense that the otherwise
typical hyperparameter, the warping window, does not have

to be learned (in a training phase) or set artificially, which
otherwise can be computationally expensive to do [18].
Second, Euclidean distance (ED) is not suitable as similarity
measure. This is because of its metric-nature [15]. ED does
not permit to compare two time series of different lengths.
Once the closest shapelet is determined and indexed by
k ? and q ? , label li (p) is defined as in Step 8 of Algorithm 1.
i
Then, the collection of multiple of these labels, {li (p)}P
p=0 ,
defines a word and defines a compressed time series representation for time series i = 0, . . . , N − 1. Note that even if
time series i is assigned to cluster k, i.e., I(i) = k, this does
i
not necessarily imply that the label transitions for {li (p)}P
p=0
must coincide with the label transitions for the segments of
the corresponding centroid.

While Steps 1-8 of ISPA are concerned to structure and
summarize the data input, Steps 9-15 define a method to
exploit gained information for prediction of all time series
from the last available time T − 1 on. Steps 10-11 map
from the label li (Pi − 1) associated with the last known
segment of time series i to the closest reference shapelet
defined by cluster index k and centroid segment index q.
Then, in Step 12 the next predicted label, lipred , is determined
as the next corresponding centroid segment. Ultimately, the
T −1+∆ti
predicted time series, {xpred
i (t)}t=T −1 , is generated by
normalizing the appropriate reference shapelet and attaching
it to xi (T − 1) as indicated in Step 14-15.
B. Discussion and unsupervised learning perspective
The novelty of Algorithm 1 stems from its method of combining three main building blocks. These are the algorithms
K-means++ [6], APTS [7] and DTW [8]. The selection of
unconstrainted DTW for nearest neighbor search is appropriate since it permits to deal with time series segments
of different lengths. The benefits of APTS over alternative
segmentation algorithms, in particular, also for computational
efficiency, were demonstrated in [7]. (The simplified version
presented here in Algortihm 2 is even faster.) The selection

of K-means++ for clustering is appropriate since it requires
only a single hyperparameter and provides various useful
summarization information such as centroids and cluster
assignments for all time series. Extracting shapelets from
centroid segments permits generalizing over all available
time series, while simultaneously limiting the size of the alphabet of shapelets generated. The complexity of K-means is
O(IKN T ), where I denotes the number of iterations needed
until convergence, K the number of clusters, N the number
of time series, and T the length of each time series [6]. The
complexity of unconstrained DTW is O(T1 T2 ) for two time
series of lengths T1 and T2 [8]. (Note that for the given
setting comparing short time series segments, it typically is
T1 , T2  T .) The complexity of APTS is O(N T ) [7], with
Nepsilon denoting the number of -iterations required until
Pi < S max in Algortihm 2, which in practice is very small.
The dominating complexity of ISPA is dependent on data
dimensions. It is either O(IK max N T ) for the clustering Step
1 in Algorithm 1, or O(N (N T + N (S max )2 Tip Tkq K max ))
for the nearest neighbor search in Steps 7-13 with Tip =
maxi,p τi (p+1)−τi and Tkq = maxk,q τk (q+1)−τk (q). The
latter is a worst-case upper bound. Typically Tip , Tkq  T
and early abandoning is used to accelerate nearest neighbor
search. For final hypereparameter selections and given data
the computational time is distributed with 62% to clustering
Step 1, 35% to Step 4-8, and 3% for other.
ISPA is an unsupervised learning algorithm with applications to a set of multiple related unlabeled time series. In
contrast to supervised settings, such as time series classification [17], there does not exist standard ground-truth data
that permits straightforwad evaluation and comparison of
algorithms. In the unsupervised setting evaluations of comparative methods are subjective. Either an artificially madeup ranking measure has to be designed or solutions have to be
plotted and compared visually according to aesthetic criteria.
The former can be misleading via biased measure design
towards different objectives of algorithms to be compared.
For visual comparison of prediction methods a Martingale
process is considered, using the present value as future mean
estimate. Computational efficiency is demonstrated by fast
overall solve times (less than 1s) on a 2014-old laptop.
Finally, all main three subroutines (K-means++, APTS and
DTW) offer guarantees about termination in finite time [6]–
[8]. Therefore, ISPA also offers this guarantee. All methods
were implemented in C++. All experiments were run on an
Intel i7-4810MQ CPU@2.8GHz×8 processor with 15.6 GiB
memory. Runtimes of Algorithm 1 for the two experiments
discussed below were 0.6s and 0.89s, respectively.

datasets for COVID-19 from [19],
• time series covid19 confirmed global.csv

time series covid19 recovered global.csv
time series covid19 deaths global.csv
for the time period from January 23 until April 27, 2020.
Two experiments were constructed. First, time series for
the number of total net daily infections were computed by
subtracting new daily recoveries from new daily infections.
Note that available time series were in some cases reported
for multiple different regions within the same country. For
instance, for Australia it is differentiated between “Queensland, Australia”, “New South Wales, Australia”, etc. For
consistency in all of the following the term “country” will
still be maintained. In order to compute net daily cases
the two aforementioned datasets had to by synchronized
by country name, since numbers for daily new recoveries
were not (yet) always available. After synchronization, the
first experiment involved time series for N = 249 different
countries, each of length T = 96. For the second experiment,
the number of daily deaths attributed to COVID-19 was
considered. This involved time series for N = 264 different
countries, each of length T = 96.
For both experiments the same hyperparameters were
used. These are summarized in Table I. In order to emphasize
a particular observation, it was intentionally selected K max =
N , i.e., the largest possible number of clusters. It could be
observed that for both experiments the number of actual
clusters resulting after Step 1 of Algorithm 1 naturally
collapsed to K = 14 and K = 13 for Experiment 1
and 2, respectively. This indicates that for both cases, net
daily infections and daily deaths, available COVID-19 data
is highly discriminating.

B. Discussion of Results and Extending Data
The results of Experiment 1 are summarized in Fig. 1, 2
and 3. The following observations are made.
First, retrieved data [19] is discussed. It is displayed in
Fig. 1. An instant observation is the global spread of the
disease to 249 countries. COVID-19 can be tested positively
also in Timor-Leste, Bhutan and Andorra. The time series
for the USA is the most obvious outlier. Another outlier
is the blue trajectory with the early spike, which corresponds to Hubei,China. Furthermore, many negative spikes
can be detected which indicate more daily recoveries than
new infections. This plot globally summarizes 249 different
countries. The majority of time series are centered closely
around the origin. In this perspective notice the y-axis range.
Our planet has a population of 7.8 billion people.
Second, Fig. 2 summarizes clustering and segmentation
results for shapelet generation. The discriminating nature of
available data is underlined. Note how, on one hand, 213
countries are assigned to cluster C7 with daily net infections
closely fluctuating around the origin. On the other hand,
time series for Ireland (C2), South Korea (C4), Mexico (C8),
Hubei-China (C9), Iran (C10), USA (C12) and France (C13)
each cover single clusters because of their vastly different
shapes. Thus, time series greatly differ for different countries.
Furthermore, time series are extremely volatile with both
sudden positive and negative spikes (see, e.g., France in C13
and Ireland in C2). As a result, because of the volatility,
identified shapelets are very short for the time from March
onwards, or very long and flat for the time from Januray
until March (with the exception of Hubei,China in C9).
Third, Fig. 3 summarizes time series for 6 countries and
displays a prediction according to Steps 9-15 of Algorithm 1.
Sprecific countries were selected for the following reasons.

Hubei-China was selected since the first confirmed case of
COVID-19 has been traced back to 1 December 2019 in its
capital Wuhan [21]. Germany was selected for its very low
death rate (0.01% deaths per 1 million inhabitants), which
will also be discussed later. Austria was selected because of
being one of the first European countries to partially have lift
closures on April 14. Switzerland was selected because of
being, like Austria, an Alpine country, however, in contrast
not having eased its lockdown as of April 27. Sweden was
selected because of its unique way of handling COVID19, never imposing a lockdown and keeping schools and
restaurants open throughout all times. The USA was selected
because of its reporting of the highest numbers of cases.
As Fig. 3 shows, the trajectories for Germany, Austria and
Switzerland are comparable. Since end of March there are on
average more daily recoveries than there are new infections.
It is very interesting to observe that net daily infections
are plateauing also for Sweden despite a lack of lockdown.
There is no exponential growth of reported COVID-19 cases
for Sweden. Similarly, net daily infections for the USA are
plateauing and maintaining the level as of end of March.
The results of Experiment 2 are summarized in Fig. 4, 5
and 6. The following observations are made.
First, retrieved data in Fig. 4 is discussed. Just as for
daily net infections, the time series for the USA is the most
obvious outlier. The y-axis range is stressed.
Second, Fig. 5 summarizes clustering and segmentation
results for shapelet generation. The discriminating nature of
available data is underlined. After Step 1 of Algorithm 1
13 clusters result. The global majority, with 168 countries,
is assigned to cluster C5. For this group of countries, the
maximum number of daily deaths was 4. For some countries
negative numbers are reported (data is used as downloaded
without correction). The vast differences in y-axis ranges are
stressed. There are 5 clusters (C1, C2, C5, C7, and C8) with
single-digit daily deaths for a total of 210 countries. There
are 4 clusters (C0, C3, C4 and C6) with at most doubledigit daily deaths for a total of 33 countries. Because of the
volatility in recorded data, identified shapelets are either very
short for the time from March onwards, or very long and flat
for the time from January until March.
Third, Fig. 3 summarizes time series for 6 countries and
displays a prediction according to Steps 9-15 of Algorithm
1. The trajectories for Germany, Austria, Switzerland and the
USA are comparable by shape, but differ by y-axis ranges.
For Austria (with a population of 8.9 millions) the maximum
number of daily deaths attributed to COVID-19 for the the
time period from January until April 27 was 30. For the
USA (with a population of 328.2 millions) the corresponding
number was above 4000. Sweden has a highly fluctuating
number with an upper bound below 200.
Because of the variability, volatility and differences of time
series for countries, extending statistics are provided in Fig
7 and 8. The following observations are made.
First, it is astonishing to see Sweden ranked only 7th,
approximately on par with Switzerland and USA, for deaths
per 1 million inhabitants as shown in Fig. 7. This is highly
surprising given its approach of handling COVID-19 without
lockdown in contrast to all higher ranked countries (Netherlands, UK, France, Italy, Spain and Belgium). Remarkably,
the normalized death rate for Belgium is three times higher
than that of Sweden.
Second, equally surprising is the number of positive tests
per 1 million inhabitants for Sweden with 0.19%, which is

even significantly lower than the 0.31% for the USA.
Third, there is a large variability in the number of positive
tests per total number of tests. For example, for a COVID-19
test in France there is a 35.77% likelihood that the test is
positive. In neighboring Italy the likelihood is only 11.14%.
A brief comment about the basic reproduction number
R0 is made, which recently gained significant attention in
the media and is used by goverments as gauge to measure
effectiveness of their restrictions [22]. R0 represents the
average number of people that is infected from an infected
person. For COVID-19, R0 is estimated to be between 2 and
2.5, and the serial interval (average time between each successive infection) is estimated to lie between 4 to 4.5 days.
Assuming average values for R0 and the serial interval, the
total accumulated number of human beings, H(T ), infected
t
PT
up until time T can be calculated as H(T ) = t=0 R04.25 ,
with R0 = 2.25. For the time period from January 23 until
April 29 this corresonds to T = 98 and H(T ) = 628.4m.
However, according to [23] the accumulated number of
human beings that came in contact since outbreak of COVID19 is only 3.2m as of April 29. Hence, H(T ) is larger by
a factor of 195. To develop this further, the first confirmed
case of COVID-19 has been traced back to December 1,
2019 in Wuhan [21]. As of April 29, this would correspond
to T = 152, and thus H(T ) = 18750.7 billion, which is
more than twice the total world population. Obviously, above
model is a simplification, that does, e.g., not account for
damping effects such as immunization etc. On the other hand,
France (and many other western countries) announced strict
confinement measures only on March 17, which would imply
that COVID-19 could have spread unchecked for almost three
months. India, with a population of 1.3 billion, ordered a
nationwide lockdown only on March 24.
While R0 is related to the number of infections, a
brief comment about available data for deaths attributed
to COVID-19 is made. There are many examples such as
Morton’s. “Morton’s death certificate said Morton’s cause of
death was COVID-19” [24]. Morton was 109 years old.
Finally, while there are many uncertainties regarding
available COVID-19 data, this is clearly not the case for
measurements of the economic ramifications due to governmental restrictions and lockdowns. Here, numbers are well
measurable. In the USA alone, jobless claims total more
than 30 million after week 6 of lockdown [25]. Similar
devastations in other countries are omitted for brevity. The
global cost of COVID-19 may reach 4.1 Trillion [26]. This
excludes social cost. Furthermore, the “fear of COVID-19”
may be just as deadly as the disease itself. It is entirely
plausible that more people die (in particular also the elderly)
because of social isolation or eoconomic hardship rather than
from COVID-19. In this perscpective, consider [27]: “Where

are all the patients with heart attacks and stroke? They are
missing from our hospitals.”
V. C ONCLUSION
This paper presented an Integrated Summarization and
Prediction Algorithm (ISPA) for the handling of a set of
multiple related time series. It was applied to real-world
COVID-19 data in two experiments; First, for global net
daily infections (new daily infections minus daily recoveries), and, second, for global daily deaths for the period from
January 23 until April 27, 2020. This resulted in datasets
for 249 and 264 countries, respectively. While it was found
that predictions provided by ISPA were not very useful
due to very volatile and short COVID-19 data, a variety of
insights drawn from the summarization of global data were
discussed. Analysis on extending data, including normalized
ratios adjusted for population sizes, was also presented.
If available data is to be believed, the worst in terms of
number of daily net infections and daily deaths attributed to
COVID-19 seems to have past in the majority of countries
as of April 27, 2020. However, various anomalies detected
make believe that reported data is likely not accurate.
There is a strong discrepancy between, on the one hand,
fully measurable and known economically and socially
devastating impacts of extended lockdowns, and, on the
other hand, a lot of inexplicabilities and controversies about
COVID-19 and its available data. To name just one example,
why do Belgium and France have 3 and 2 times more
deaths per 1 million inhabitants in comparison to Sweden,
eventhough Belgium and France both entered very strict
lockdowns on March 18, where “people were allowed to
go out in an emergency or to a supermarket, pharmacies
and doctors, but any gatherings were prohibited”? If countrywide lockdowns helped so much, should Sweden not be off
much worse since it never enforced a lockdown?
In view of the trade-off between protective restrictions, an
urge to reopen for the saving of livelihoods, and in view
of the unreliability of official data, it is believed that a
possible health-first and justifiable solution is a decentralized
approach in which heads or consortia of doctors and nurses
of local hospitals decisively guide local reopening debates.
It is believed that this group of professionals is currently
largely and undeservedly underrepresented in many public
discussions (that focus on predictions of virologists instead),
eventhough these bear the brunt and offer the more realistic,
real-time and localized state estimate on the disease.

Fig. 7. Overview of 20 countries ranked by deaths (attributed to COVID-19) per 1 million inhabitants as of April 28, 2020 [23]. Sweden is emphasized
because of its different approach of handling the pandemic in contrast to other countries with avoidance of any lockdown.

Fig. 8. Summary of 3 different ratios for 20 countries ranked according to Fig. 7 as of April 28, 2020. “Pos.” is abbreviated for “Positive”. Note that
reported numbers are accumulated over the entire duration of the pandemic since its start [23].
