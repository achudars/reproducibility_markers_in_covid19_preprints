Abstract
Since December 2019, the world has been witnessing the gigantic effect of an unprecedented
global pandemic called Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) COVID-19. So far, 38,619,674 confirmed cases and 1,093,522 confirmed deaths due to
COVID-19 have been reported. In the United States (US), the cases and deaths are recorded
as 7,833,851 and 215,199. Several timely researches have discussed the local and global effects
of the confounding factors on COVID-19 casualties in the US. However, most of these studies
considered little about the time varying associations between and among these factors, which
are crucial for understanding the outbreak of the present pandemic. Therefore, this study adopts
various relevant approaches, including local and global spatial regression models and machine
learning to explore the causal effects of the confounding factors on COVID-19 counts in the
contiguous US. Totally five spatial regression models, spatial lag model (SLM), ordinary least
square (OLS), spatial error model (SEM), geographically weighted regression (GWR) and
multiscale geographically weighted regression (MGWR), are performed at the county scale to
take into account the scale effects on modelling. For COVID-19 cases, ethnicity, crime, and
income factors are found to be the strongest covariates and explain the maximum model
variances. For COVID-19 deaths, both (domestic and international) migration and income
factors play a crucial role in explaining spatial differences of COVID-19 death counts across
counties. The local coefficient of determination (R2) values derived from the GWR and MGWR
models are found very high over the Wisconsin-Indiana-Michigan (the Great Lake) region, as
well as several parts of Texas, California, Mississippi and Arkansas. The lowest R2 score is
found in the Northern and North-Western states (i.e., Montana, Washington, Oregon,
Wyoming), Southern states (i.e., New Mexico) and North-East coast region (i.e., North
Carolina and Georgia). Such associations also exhibited temporal variations from March to
July, as supported by better performance of MGWR than GWR. Though the present study tried

2

to incorporate all relevant components into the modelling, the causal impact of the other
factors, such as lockdown date, the strictness of lockdown (partial or complete), restrictions on
social activity and human mobility, etc. are not explored, which can be a case for future
research.

1. Introduction
The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2-COVID-19),
first emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan province in China, has soon become a new public
health concern across the world. Tracking the pathway of COVID-19 spreads across the
continents, it is evident that geography and time strongly determine the virus outbreak
(Fitzpatrick et al., 2020). The spillover effects and spatial transmission of the disease have been
proven critical factors of the overall health burden caused by COVID-19. Spatial regression
models can be useful for quantifying the risk of disease progression in the communities and
developing spatially explicit maps to visualise the distribution of explanatory factors (Desmet
SMU, Klaus; Romain Wacziarg UCLA, 2010; Ehlert, 2020; Xiong et al., 2020; Zhang and
Schwartz, 2020). Previous studies have focused on the spatial heterogeneity of the COVID-19
transmission, considering the aggregated number of infected population (Bashir et al., 2020;
Conticini et al., 2020; Sarwar et al., 2020; Xiong et al., 2020; Yao et al., 2020). Developing
spatial models and understanding the confounding effects of the variables is critical to sense
the spatial variation of virus transmission at the local scale (Mollalo et al., 2020; Ren et al.,
2020; Zhang and Schwartz, 2020).
Studies have utilised environmental, social, economic, demographic variables to
explain the spatial variability of the COVID-19 incidents and discovered the underlying risk of
the outbreaks across scales (Karaye and Horney, 2020; Qi et al., 2020; Ren et al., 2020;
Sannigrahi et al., 2020b). Fortaleza et al., (2020) noted trade-offs between travelling distance
and new incidence of the COVID-19 cases in Sao Paulo city, Brazil. Bola√±o-Ortiz et al., (2020)
found that particulate matter (PM2.5) has strongly associated with the virus spread in Brazilian
cities. Almagro and Orane-hutchinson, 2020; Borjas, (2020) documented a strong association
between the ethnic composition and COVID-19 cases in New York City of United States (US).

5

These studies (Almagro and Orane-hutchinson, 2020; Borjas, 2020) observed that
neighbourhoods of the Hispanic population with high household density are likely to be most
infected by COVID-19. Thakar (2020) explored the occurrence of community transmission of
COVID-19 to the nearby locations and recommended to impose a strict restriction on
community mobility and social distancing to curb the virus spread in its initial stage. In
addition, other studies have also focused on the measures of mobility (Oztig and Askin, 2020),
migration (Chen et al., 2020; Xiong et al., 2020) and air transport (Christidis and
Christodoulou, 2020), which could reduce the spillover effects of virus out breaks.
Several studies have explored the spatial interaction among the COVID-19 fatalities
and socioeconomic, demographic and environmental factors. Ren et al., (2020) utilised the
ecological niche model to identify the potential risk zone based on the socioeconomic data in
three metropolitan cities of China. The purpose of study (Ren et al., 2020) was to develop an
early warning system, by which spatial interaction among the confounding factors could be
observed in details. You et al., (2020) study in Wuhan found that population density, proportion
of construction land, aged population density, tertiary industrial output per unit land, can
upsurge the COVID-19 morbidity. But, the cross-country comparison of virus spread and their
interaction with demographic, economic and environmental parameters are limited. Among
them, Sannigrahi et al., (2020b) focused on the European region, and carried out the spatial
regression model to understand the spatial heterogeneous association among the factors in
different European countries. This study (Sannigrahi et al., 2020b) found that demographic
variables have the highest influence on COVID-19 fatalities in Germany, Austria, Slovenia etc.
Ehlert, (2020) had observed similar association in Germany. Iyanda et al., (2020) utilised
Multiscale Geographical Weightage regression to understand retrospective phenomena of
cross-national virus outbreaks. Similarly, Karaye and Horney, (2020); Mollalo et al., (2020);
Sun et al., (2020); Zhang and Schwartz, (2020) studied spatial variability and social

6

vulnerability COVID-19 risk in cross-county analysis in the US. Mollalo et al., (2020)
considered 90 days aggregated data of COVID-19, and selected four explanatory variables
from

the

thirty-five

explanatory

variables

covering

socioeconomic,

behavioural,

environmental, topographic and demographic indicators in order to develop a spatial regression
model. Desmet SMU, Klaus; Romain Wacziarg UCLA, 2010; Sun et al., (2020) highlighted
the spatial effects of time-variant explanatory variables on the overall COVID-19 incident in
the US. (Pourghasemi et al., 2020) focused on the cross country spatiotemporal spillover of the
virus spreads in Iran and has not considered the spatial interaction of socioeconomic and
demographic factors. Zhang and Schwartz, (2020) analysed spatial disparities across US
counties, and identified the heterogeneity of the virus spread in the metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas through a global spatial regression model.
Omitting the time variable in spatial models can lead to erroneous estimates and
misleading conclusion. Although several researches have employed various spatial models
(both global and local) in COVID-19 studies, there has not been substantial effort to capture
the time effect in spatial regression modelling. Moreover, assuming the time-independent and
homogenous impact of the confounding factors on response variables (COVID-19 cases and
deaths in the present case) might introduce ambiguity in parameter approximation and
eventually produce unconvincing results, which should not be expected for a sensitive case of
experiment such as COVID-19. Therefore, the present research has made an effort to address
the current research gap in spatial COVID-19 studies by conceptualising many time-dependent
spatial regressions models using open source data information in the contiguous United States
(US). The hypothesis of this study is framed as ‚Äúthe spatial interactions between the
confounding factors and COVID-19 counts strongly depend on time, thus space entity alone
cannot fully explain this association‚Äù. The specific objectives of this study are 1. to explore
the overall association between the explanatory factors and COVID-19 cases and deaths; 2. to

7

examine the local interactions between the explanatory factors and COVID-19 incidences; 3.
to develop dynamic spatial regression models for exploring the time-dependent local spatial
association between the explanatory and response variables; 4. to measure the relative
importance of variables for developing parsimonious regression models.

2. Materials and methods:
2.1 Data source and pre-processing
The present research has utilized the county-level most updated aggregated datasets
provided by John Hopkins University (Killeen et al., 2020). The mentioned datasets contain
348 relevant variables covering all domains, such as demography, education, economy, health
care capacity, crime statistics, public transit, climate, and housing. The details of the 348
variables are given in Table. S1. Since the main aim of the present study was to establish a
modelling framework to examine the space, and time-dependent association between COVID19 counts and causal factors, all the relevant variables considered in this study were preprocessed to connect the values of each variable to their corresponding county unit, which is
identified by its unique Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) code. In the five-digit
FIPS code, the first two digits refer state information, and the last three digits describe county
information. The John Hopkins team has been retrieving information from various
governmental and institutional sources that include United States Census Bureau, United States
Department of Agriculture (USDA) Economic Research Service, the National Oceanic and
Atmosphere Administration (NOAA), the Association of American Medical Colleges
(AAMC), Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF), the Center for Neighborhood Technology
(CNT), the Bureau of Justice Statistics, and Department of Justice (DOJ) (Killeen et al., 2020).

8

The cited data has also retrieved key information on the health care system at county scale to
examine how a county with better and improved health care system handling COVID-19
efficiently and vice versa.
The daily COVID-19 counts, including confirmed cases and deaths, were collected for
22

January

to

26

July

2020

period

from

USAFacts

(https://usafacts.org/visualizations/coronavirus-covid-19-spread-map/). The daily counts of
COVID-19 cases and deaths were converted to cumulative sum for further analysis and
subsequent interpretation. The USAFacts team aggregates the most updated COVID-19 counts
from various sources, including Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and stateand local-level public health agencies. Following, the county-level COVID-19 data was again
verified by communicating state and local agencies directly. However, for most of the states,
the USAFacts team gathers the daily county-level cumulative COVID-19 counts (positive
cases and deaths) from the published table, web dashboards, or PDF report available on state
public health website through scraping or manual entry. The actual numbers (COVID-19
counts) reported in the USAFacts report sometimes may not exactly match with the state public
health organisation reports and statistics. This could be due to the frequency in which the
USAFacts are collecting and updating data is different from the data collection frequency of
local governmental organisations. Additionally, there are a few unique states where up to date
the county-scale data is either not available on public health website, or data collection is not
frequent. For example, the updated COVID-19 counts in California and Texas state are not
available on the state public health websites. For these sates, the USAFacts team has extracted
the latest available numbers from county-specific public health websites.
Daily air pollution data was collected from OpenAQ data repository system for five key
air pollutants, particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10), Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), Carbon monoxide
(CO), and Sulfur Dioxide (SO2). The daily concentrations of these air pollutants were converted

9

to the monthly average unit to examine its association with COVID-19 casualties. So far,
OpenAQ platform consists of 686 million air quality measurements, 150 data sources, 13000
locations, and 95 countries in their system that enabling the system to collect hourly air
pollution concentration estimates from governmental and sensor sources. The ‚Äúropenaq:
Accesses Air Quality Data from the Open Data Platform OpenAQ‚Äù, an R package, was utilised
for accessing the large volume of data for the entire US from 22 January to 27 July 2020. The
location wise air pollution data was further converted to raster surface using IDW interpolation
method. Following, the average air pollution concentration of each county was calculated using
zonal statistics as table function.

2.2 Variable selection and dimensionality reduction
Dimensionality reduction and extracting critical information from datasets is crucial for
regression modelling and effective decision analysis. The present research has employed a
stepwise forward regression approach as a tool for separating the key variables from the sets
of unorganised variables. A total of seven groups, i.e. crime, demography, education,
employment, ethnicity, health, and migration, which were assumed to have both synergistic
and tradeoff association with COVID-19 counts, were formed, and subsequently, the key
variables were extracted from each group on the basis of variable inflation factor (VIF) and
model variability score, characterised by the coefficient of determination (R2) and adjusted
coefficient of determination (Adj. R2). During the initial screening, it has been detected that
data was not consistent for all the 348 variables considered, and therefore, the final stepwise
regression modelling was performed considering the filtered variables. For crime category,
total 16 variables have been incorporated into the modelling, while for the other category, a
total of 14, 29, 6, 72, 63, 5, 7, and 4 variables were considered for demographic, education,
employment, ethnicity, healthcare, pollution, migration, and climate, respectively (Table. S2).

10

Multiple collinearity tests, including VIF, R2 change, correlation coefficient, probability, and t
statistics, were executed to detect the redundant variables in the models. High collinearity
would be evident in the model if the VIF value is found >10; therefore, all the filtered variables
considered in the regression modelling were scrutinised to eliminate the redundancy in model
parametrisation. Followed by stepwise forward regression, the enter stepwise regression
method was performed to measure the VIF value of each explanatory variable in order to ensure
that the multicollinearity was entirely eliminated. The final parsimonious models that relied on
fewer parameters and at the same time explained the maximum model variances with less
uncertainty were parameterised for each category for both COVID-19 cases and deaths. It
should be noted that the confounding effects of the independent variables have not been
assessed thoroughly, which could be a scope for future research.

2.3 Spatial regression
2.3.1 Global Spatial Regression models
Spatial regression models have been used extensively in COVID-19 research across the
scale (Guliyev, 2020; Chakraborti et al., 2019; Mollalo et al., 2020; Sannigrahi et al., 2020b;
Sannigrahi et al., 2020a; Sun et al., 2020; You et al., 2020). Among the available global spatial
regression models, we used Ordinary Least Square (OLS), Spatial Error Model (SEM), and
Spatial Lag Model (SLM) for measuring the global associations between causal factors and
COVID-19 counts at the county scale. The OLS model, which usually assesses the interactions
between explanatory variables and dependent variable (COVID-19 cases and deaths), was
conceptualised as follows:

yi = ÔÅ¢0 + ÔÅ¢ xi + ÔÅ• i

11

Where ùë¶ùëñ is the COVID-19 case or death counts at county i, ùõΩ0 is the model intercept, ùõΩ is the
slope of the regression coefficient, ùë•ùëñ is the selected independent variable(s) at county i, ùúÄùëñ is
the error term at model estimates. The global OLS assumed to have spatial stationarity across
the scale, and therefore, also hypothesised that a model conceptualised for a particular area can
be applied effectively to other areas of interest (Fang et al., 2015). According to Anselin and
Arribas-Bel, (2013), the global OLS is based on two fundamental assumptions, first, the
observation in the feature space does not vary with space and therefore should be independent
in nature, and second, the residual model errors should not be correlated (Oshan et al., 2020;
Mollalo et al., 2020).
The spatial lag model (SLM) assumed spatial dependency between the explanatory and
response variables in feature space and conceptualised the global regression by incorporating
spatial dependence attributes in the modelling. The SLM also assumes to have spatially lagged
dependent variable in the modelling, which can be ensured by the spatial dependence test
resulted from OLS. If the determinant factors, including Moran's I (error), Lagrange Multiplier
(lag), and Robust LM (lag), exhibited statistically significant estimates at a defined probability
level, then one should reconsider the model selection process and go for SLM as a replacement
for OLS. The SLM can be defined as:

yi = ÔÅ¢0 + ÔÅ¢ xi + ÔÅ≤Wi yi + ÔÅ• i
Where ùúå is the spatial lag component, ùëäùëñ is spatial weights (spatial weights matrix in a row
format). Spatial weight matrix was generated using multiple approaches, including contiguitybased methods (Queen contiguity and Rook contiguity) and distance-based methods (Euclidean
distance, Arc distance, and Manhattan distance). Contiguity-based weight was approximated
using first order of contiguity. The county unique identifier number was utilised as a base for
weight calculation. Since the accuracy and performances of all the global regression models

12

strongly rely on spatial weights, we adopted both contiguity and distance-based weights for
comparing the results at varied parameter setups.
The spatial error model (SEM) is an extension of global models that fundamentally
stands on the assumption of spatial dependence in the residual error of OLS (Fang et al., 2015;
Song et al., 2014; Chi and Zhu, 2008; Yang and Jin, 2010; Guliyev, 2020; Sannigrahi et al.,
2020c ; Mollalo et al., 2020). The SEM assumes that spatial autocorrelation among the
regression residuals is thus evident and two standard spatial dependence tests, such as Lagrange
Multiplier (error) and Robust LM (error), were executed to ensure the statistical significance
in spatial dependency in error terms, specified as follows.

yit = x i it ÔÅ¢ + ui + ÔÅ• it

ÔÅ• it = ÔÅ¨WÔÅ• t + vit
Where ùúÜùëäùúÄùë° is the spatial error term, ùúÜ denotes the autoregressive factor, ùë£ùëñùë° refers to the
random error term, that is normally conceptualised to be independent and ideally distributed in
feature space, ùúÄùëñùë° refers to the spatially uncorrelated error term (Guliyev, 2020). The SEM
model consists of two error terms, i.e., ùúÜùëäùúÄùë° and ùúÄùëñùë° . Since the OLS derived spatial dependence
test has suggested a statistically significant spatial dependency among the observations for
SLM and SEM, this study considered all the three standard global spatial regression models
for spatial modelling and subsequent interpretation. The results of the spatial dependence test
showed that both LM (lag and error) and Robust LM (lag and error) exhibited the statistical
significance estimates; therefore, both SEM and SLM were utilised to assess the synergies and
tradeoffs between COVID-19 counts and associated factors at the county scale. When
estimating the global models, both dependent and independent variables were converted to
cumulative sum units. Additionally, the global association between the variables were assessed

13

for all the seven sub-components for capturing the individual effect of each sub-component on
COVID-19 counts at the spatial feature space.
2.3.2 Local Regression
In many real-life cases, the general global assumptions and spatial stationarity among
the observations in feature space, could be ineffective and thus produced inelastic and biased
estimates at the local scale. Since the main objective of the present research is to establish
predictive spatial models at the local scale, two most used local spatial regression models, i.e.
geographically weighted regression (GWR) and multiscale geographically weighted regression
(MGWR), were employed for local spatial regression modelling and subsequent interpretation
(Sannigrahi et al., 2020d; Oshan et al., 2019). The GWR model is developed on the basis of
Toddler‚Äôs first law of geography, which suggests "everything is related to everything else, but
near things are more related than distant things." In GWR, each observation in feature space
will vary over space and therefore, would be associated with locally varying coefficients of the
regression parameters. This addition of local spatial context in GWR modelling favours
exploring the spatial dependency among the parameters. GWR can be defined as:
ùëö

ùë¶ùëñ = ùõΩùëñ0 + ‚àë

ùëó=1

ùõΩùëñùëó ùëãùëñùëó + ùúÄùëñ

ùëñ = 1,2. . . . . , ùëõ
Where ùë¶ùëñ is dependent variable (COVID-19 case or death counts) at county i, ùõΩùëñ0 refers to the
regression intercept, ùõΩùëñùëó refers to the independent regression parameter, ùëãùëñùëó is the value of the
jth regression parameter, ùúÄùëñ refers to the regression error.
Although GWR models have been embraced as a solution for global spatial stationarity
in regression estimates, the same has been suffered in cases when a constant and
straightforward bandwidth has not been able to detect the spatial non-stationarity at varying

14

bandwidths across the feature space. To address this problem, Fotheringham et al., 2017; Oshan
et al., 2019, proposed a multiscale and multi bandwidth GWR, that allows exploring the local
relationships among the factors at varying spatial scales by computing shifting bandwidth
based on the distributions of observation. MGWR can be defined as:
m

yi = ÔÉ• ÔÅ¢bwj X ij + ÔÅ• i
j =0

i = 1, 2....., n
Where ùõΩùëèùë§ùëó refers to the differential bandwidth at feature space. The rest is the same as
discussed in GWR.

2.4 Variable Importance
Machine Learning models have been used extensively in measuring feature importance
in multiparameter models. The present research utilised the supervised machine learning
algorithm, Random Forest (RF), for spotting the key causal explanatory factors in the models.
RF models (Breiman, 2001; Chakraborti et al., 2020), fundamentally based on bootstrap
aggregating of decision trees, can minimise the unexplained variance of models and thus
improve prediction accuracy (Altmann et al., 2010). RF models have been utilised for many
domain-specific studies, including, gene expression-based cancer classification (Okun and
Priisalu, 2007), biology of ageing (Fabris et al., 2018); remote sensing land cover mapping (Ma
et al., 2017); screening underlying lead compounds (Cao et al., 2011); Structure damage
detection (Zhou et al., 2014), etc.. In this study, we measured the variable importance based on
the overall capacity of the variables to explain the total model variances. Relative Importance
(RI) and normalise importance scores were also computed for each variable to verify the
predictive accuracy of the models as well as individual contribution of each variable to the
overall model performances.

15

2.5 Experimental design
In this study, we structured the entire analysis into a few sequential and logical steps to
carry out the entire analysis. The global and local spatial regression analysis has been carried
out through four separate models:
Model 1: Global regression model built on considering both static dependent and independent
variables
Model 1 was conceptualized for doing global regression analysis between COVID-19
counts and explanatory factors. The daily COVID-19 data from 22 January to 26 July was
converted to cumulative sum for changing the nature of the data from dynamic to static. Only
the final filtered variables for COVID-19 cases and deaths were considered for model 1. Groupwise assessment was not done for model 1. The final selected variables, 6 for cases and 6 for
deaths, had exhibited acceptable VIF scores, and therefore, multicollinearity problems in the
model did not seem evident for all the multi-parameters regression models. All the global
models, including OLS, SEM, and SLM, were conducted using GeoDa and GeoDa Space
software. The first order Queen and Rook contiguity was applied for spatial weight estimation.
The distance-based approach was utilised for generating the spatial weights of the observations.
In particular, the Euclidian distance method was adopted for distance-based spatial weight
calculation.
Model 2: Local Regression model built on using static independent and static dependent
variables
Model 2 was developed by incorporating both static independent and static dependent
variables into the modelling. Local GWR and MGWR modelling was undertaken to explore
the local correlation and association between the explanatory and response variables. Both
GWR and MGWR were performed in the MGWR software package, developed by Olson et
16

al., 2019. For model 2, only the final filtered variables (6 for cases and 6 for death) were taken
as independent variables. Using these variables, seven parameters local regression models have
been developed for COVID-19 cases and death. The cumulative sum values of COVID-19
cases and deaths were accounted for model 2.
Model 3: Group-wise local regression model built on using static independent and static
dependent variables
Model 3 was conceptualised after incorporating group-wise (crime, demography, education,
employment, ethnicity, health, and migration) variables into the modelling. Using the stepwise
forward and enter regression method, the filtered variables (VIF<4) for each group was
identified. Among the seven major groups, a total of two variables (county population agency
report crimes and ARSON), one variable (female age 85+), two variables (less than a high
school diploma 2014-18 and bachelor's degree or higher 2014-18), three variables (unemployed
2018, median household income 2018, Median household income percent of state total 2018),
two variables (HBAC_MALE and NH_FEMALE), two variables (Geriatric Medicine and
Preventive Medicine), and a total of three variables (Population estimate 2018, domestic
migration 2018, and R international migration 2018), have been selected for crime,
demography, education, employment, ethnicity, health, and migration for developing local
regression models for COVID-19 cases. Similarly, for COVID-19 deaths, a total of two
variables for crime (Robbery, Motor vehicle thefts), one variable for demography (female
age85+), one variable for education (bachelor's degree or higher 2014-18), three variables for
employment (unemployed 2018, median household income 2018, median household income
percent of state total 2018), two variables for ethnicity (HBA Female, BA Female), one variable
for health (endocrinology diabetes and metabolism specialists (2019)), and four variables for
migration (Pop estimate 2018, domestic migration 2018, R international migration 2018, and
R domestic migration 2018), have been considered for COVID-19 deaths.

17

Model 4: Dynamic local regression model built on using dynamic dependent and static
independent variables
In model 4, the monthly COVID-19 cases and deaths were chosen as dependent
variables, and the annual averaged static group variables were considered as independent
variables. The monthly sum values of COVID-19 cases and deaths were calculated for March,
April, May, Jun, and July. A total of ten (five for cases and five for death) multiparameter local
spatial regression models were developed for exploring the dynamic association between the
response and explanatory factors. The final filtered variables (six for cases, ARSON, median
household income 2018, median household income percent of the state total 2018, HBA male,
domestic migration 2018, R international migration 2018) and six for deaths, i.e., median
household income 2018, median household income percent of state total 2018, HBA Female,
domestic migration 2018, R international migration 2018, and R domestic migration 2018) was
incorporated for the dynamic local regression modelling.
The adaptive bisquare spatial kernel weighted method was employed for approximating
the kernel bandwidth for GWR and MGWR models. The default golden bandwidth search
approach was chosen for computing uniform (GWR) and locally varying (MGWR)
bandwidths. Among the different optimisation criteria, i.e., AICc, AIC, BIC, and CV, the AICc
approach was considered for selecting optimal bandwidth in the feature space. Local
correlation diagnostics, including, condition number (CN), local spatial VIF, local variance
decomposition proportions (VDP), etc. have also been computed for evaluating the local
collinearity among the observations and parameters. Bandwidth confidence intervals were also
measured at different probability levels to ensure the reliability of spatially varying bandwidths,
derived from the MGWR.

Spatial distribution and pattern of COVID-19 cases and deaths per 10,000 people in the
contiguous United States (US) is shown in Fig. 1. Multiple spatial clusters of simultaneously
high numbers of cases and deaths were formed, which designate the unequal and heterogeneous
distribution of COVID-19 counts across the counties. Among the clusters, four main clusters
have been identified throughout the study period. The first cluster was formed over the NorthEastern coastal region, covering Massachusetts, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Washington D.C.,
Marry Land, New Jersey and part of New York (New York City in particular). The second
cluster was observed in the South-Eastern region, which covers Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia,
South Carolina, North Carolina, and Florida. The third cluster was found in the great lake
region ‚Äì Michigan, Wisconsin, Illinois, centered at Chicago (one of the largest cities in the
country) of Illinois. Last, the South-Western region including southern California, Arizona,
New Mexico (northwestern part), and Colorado was also among the areas with high numbers
of cases and deaths (Fig. 1).

3.2 Association between explanatory factors and COVID-19 cases/deaths
3.2.1 Model 1: Static global regression analysis
Three global regression models, OLS, SLM and SEM, were performed for examining
the global and spatial non-stationary association between the explanatory factors and COVID19 case and death numbers (Table. 1).
For COVID-19 cases, the coefficient of determination (R2) statistics, which denote the
overall model strength and robustness, were measured as 0.78, 0.80 and 0.80 for OLS, SLM

19

and SEM, respectively. The spatial dependence diagnostics criteria for the OLS model, i.e.,
LM Lag and LM error, were found statistically significant, thus indicating the requirement of
more appropriate and relevant global models, such as SLM and SEM (Table S2). The AIC
value, which denotes the overall model accuracy and parsimonious character of the models,
was shown to be the lowest (most relevant) for SLM, followed by OLS and SEM. This suggests
that the SLM model could be the most relevant global regression model that has explained the
maximum model variability of the model. Regarding the correlations of the explanatory
variables1, ARSON, MHHInc, MHHIncPer, and HBACM were positively correlated with the
number of COVID-19 cases. Among these four covariates, HBACM was found to have the
most statistically significant relationships with the number of cases, given that its t-statistic/zstatistic was the highest in each model (52.79, 39.3 and 35.04 in OLS, SLM and SEM,
respectively). The next with substantial significant coefficients was ARSON with its t-/zstatistics being 14.88, 21.2 and 23.27 in OLS, SLM and SEM, respectively. MHHInc and
MHHIncPer were found to have smaller significance values, with the former is statistically
significant (at the 5% level) only in SLM and the latter is statistically significant (5% level) in
OLS and SEM. Meanwhile, DomMig was found negatively (significantly) correlated with the
COVID-19 cases in all the three models. Last, RIntMig shows statistically insignificant
associations with the cases, although its results were different across the models.
Moving onto the number of COVID-19 deaths, the R2 values were 0.36, 0.69 and 0.69
for OLS, SLM and SEM, respectively. The AIC value was found lowest in SLM, compared to
those in OLS and SEM, indicating that the SLM model would perform better under the given
modelling framework. To interpret the explanatory variables, DomMig, RIntMig and
RDomMig were significantly associated with the number of deaths for all three models and

The explanatory variables have different units with different value ranges, hence their coefficients are not
comparable; the associated t-statistics (OLS) and z-statistics (SLM and SEM) instead could be compared in
terms of the significance level of the associations.

20

their associating directions were consistent. Specifically, RIntMig and RDomMig covariates
were found to be positively correlated with deaths, while DomMig (the one with the highest
significance level measured by t-/z-statistics) negatively. As for MHHInc and MHHIncPer,
however, the correlations between MHHInc and deaths were observed statistically significant
in OLS and SEM, but the correlating directions were inconsistent between the two models
(positive in OLS and negative in SEM); MHHIncPer was found to be significantly associated
with deaths in only SEM and the direction was positive.
3.2.2 Model 2: Static local regression analysis
The (M)GWR derived local spatial heterogeneity of the determinant factors for the
COVID-19 cases and deaths is shown in Table 2 and Fig. 2. These figures collectively
demonstrate the spatial variability of the local model at the county scale in the contiguous US.
Local R2 estimates for both local regression models, i.e., MGWR and GWR, have shown high
degrees of spatial agreement. The counties, for which the highest R2 (i.e., R2>0.90) values were
computed, have formed a spatially clustered patterns across the country. The high values of
local R2 were concentrated over the Wisconsin-Indiana-Michigan region, as well as several
parts of Texas, California, Mississippi and Arkansas. The lowest R2 score was found in the
Northern and North-Western states (i.e., Montana, Washington, Oregon, Wyoming), Southern
states (i.e., New Mexico) and North-East coast region (i.e., North Carolina and Georgia). For
COVID-19 deaths, the spatial pattern of high, moderate and low R2 values was found similar
to those of the COVID-19 cases. Among the two local spatial regression models, MGWR
performed more accurately with higher adjusted R2 values (for cases, R2 = 0.969; for deaths,
R2 = 0.962), compared to GWR (for cases, R2 = 0.964; for deaths, R2 = 0.954). Also, AICc
values of the MGWR model (for cases, AICc = -434.883; for deaths, AICc = -358.146) were

21

found much lower than GWR (for cases, AICc = 238.888; for deaths, AICc = 230.621) (Table.
2 and Fig. 2).
3.2.3 Model 3: Group-wise static local regression analysis
The spatial association between different groups (i.e., crime, demographic, education,
employment, ethnicity, health and migration) and COVID-19 cases and deaths were examined
and presented in Fig. 3, Fig. 4. Among the seven groups, six groups viz. Demography, Crime,
Education, Ethnicity, Employment, and Population Migration have shown strong similarities
in their spatial pattern of local R2. The high local R2 (R2 = > 0.90) was found in the Southern
and South-Western states, mainly Texas, Arizona, California, Utah; in the Eastern USA, i.e.
Wisconsin-Michigan-Indiana-Illinois region; and in the tri-state area of Mississippi-ArkansasAlabama. In contrary, the health factor has exhibited a different association with the COVID19 numbers. High local associations between the health factor and the COVID-19 cases were
found in the Colorado-Utah states and New Hampshire areas. For all groups, low spatial
associations were found in Montana, North Dakota, Idaho, Oregon states. Based on the R2 and
AICc value, the population migration factor was found to be the most critical components with
highest local estimates (R2 = 0.96, AICc = -462.76), followed by education, and crime. A
similar spatial association was detected between the explanatory factors and COVID-19 death
across the counties. The high local association was found over the South, South-Western USA
(Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, California states) and in the East Central states (Wisconsin,
Michigan, Indiana, Illinois states). Population and migration factor have explained the
maximum model variability (R2 = 0.98 and AICc = -2371.52), followed by Employment,
Crime, Health, Ethnicity, Demography and Education (Table 2).

22

3.2.4 Model 4: Dynamic local regression analysis
Spatial and temporal association between the final selected variables (i.e., six variables)
and COVID-19 cases are presented in Fig. 5, Fig. 6, and Table 3. Totally ten, i.e. five for cases
and five for deaths, local regression models were developed for exploring the local associations
between the explanatory factors and COVID-19 counts in each of the five months (March,
April, May, June, and July). In March, a high spatial association between explanatory variables
and response variable was found high in Texas, New Mexico, Mississippi, Tennessee,
Kentucky, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin and Michigan region (R2 >= 0.90). In April, in addition
to the previous regions, a high spatial association was found in Florida and California. In June
and July, Arizona, Nevada, Oregon, Idaho states have exhibited a high spatial association
characterised by high local R2 values. On the contrary, a low spatial association was observed
in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota. For COVID-19 death,
the local association has followed a similar pattern as observed for the case. In March, a high
spatial association was seen in the Wisconsin and Illinois states. In the later months, the high
spatial association was shifted to multiple locations, such as Texas, California, Utah, Idaho,
Wyoming region, Arkansas, Mississippi, Tennessee region. On the contrary, a low spatial
association was found in the northern (i.e., Montana, North Dakota) and eastern states (i.e.,
Florida, Georgia, South Carolina). All the dynamic models have demonstrated the superiority
of MGWR, as it found to be the best-suited model for local regression analysis throughout the
study (Fig. 5, Fig. 6, Table 3).

3.3 Variable importance
Relative importance (RI) of the selected variables (final filtered variables, six for cases
and six for deaths) measured using the random forest machine learning model were presented
in Fig. 7. For COVID-19 cases, among the variables, the highest RI was calculated for HBACM

23

(44.31%), followed by DomMig (15.56%), ARSON (12.38%), RIntMig (10.53%),MHHIncPer
(5.22%), and MHHInc (3.7%), respectively (Fig. 7a). For COVID-19 deaths, the HBAF have
explained the maximum variances, and therefore, the highest RI score was computed for HBAF
(26.56%), followed by DomMig (13.23%), RDomMig (8.07%), MHHInc (6.84%), RIntMig
(5.88%), and MHHIncPer (0.76%), respectively (Fig. 7b).

4. Discussion
Since the outbreak of COVID-19 starting from Wuhan (China) locally to the global
crisis, it has been nearly one year passed, yet the situation remains globally elusive. Among all
the countries, the United States (US) is facing the most critical challenge in flattening the curve
with more effective and appropriate control measurements. To inform the policy-makers at
both national and state levels, understanding the explanatory forces and related confounding
factors with spatial patterns is of paramount importance. Studies have done much work of doing
so (Mollalo et al., 2020, Sannigrahi et al., 2020a,b). Yet, this could not uncover the full picture
since most of the factors change over time, namely being time-variant variables. The present
study contributes to forwarding the knowledge of the outbreak by examining a set of factors
over space and across time. Specifically, the most relevant variables were teased out from a
large group of potential factors for explaining the COVID-19 cases and deaths at the county
level, as well as for each month of the five-month study period.
Choosing the best models have always been the crucial point in spatial epidemiological
research. Previously, several methodological approaches have been evolved to capture the
influence of explanatory variables on response variables in epidemiological study (Bashir et
al., 2020; Mollalo et al., 2020). These are Spearman‚Äôs, Pearson‚Äôs and Kendall‚Äôs Correlation
Coefficient (M√©ndez-Arriaga, 2020), ordinary least square regression (M√©ndez-Arriaga, 2020),
24

Poisson regression, distributed lag nonlinear model (DLNM) (Andersen et al., 2021; Runkle et
al., 2020), cluster based analysis (Andersen et al., 2021), spatial lag model (Sun et al., 2020),
spatial error model (Sun et al., 2020), are few of them. These models are mainly global models
in nature and therefore have proven ineffective to capture the local/spatial pattern between
explanatory and response variables.
Notably, the overall regression models revealed that population migration, as indicated
by domestic migration and rate of international migration, is highly correlated with the
COVID-19 case and death numbers. The move of people across continents internationally
appears to be accompanied with high risk of virus spread, as the air traveling means by its
nature increases the likelihood of person-to-person COVID-19 transmissions (Zhang et al.,
2020). Given this evidence, airflight restrictions could be effective in undermining the virus
spread, which is in line with the conclusion of positive associations between travel restrictions
and COVID-19 spread from previous findings (Christidis & Christodoulou 2020), although
this involves trade-offs between air-transporting public health and social-economics risks
(Cotfas et al., 2020). The other population moving variable, domestic migration, is found to be
negatively related to numbers of both cases and deaths, which might be because the
redistribution of population from high density areas (e.g., megacities) to low population density
areas (e.g. mountainous suburban) could diffuse infected people while decreasing the
frequency of person-to-person contact. A study found that residents from New York City,
especially those in high wealth status, tended to flee the city to lower physical exposure to
COVID-19 (Coven & Gupta, 2020). It should be noted that this relationship is based on the
overall regression model, lacking heterogeneity over space and time. Socioeconomically,
median household income at the county level positively relates to COVID-19 spread as it
indicates the larger cities and higher population densities with more burden of virus
transmissions.

25

Interestingly, when viewing different time periods (monthly from March to July) as
revealed from the dynamic local regression analysis, there exists high spatial heterogeneity in
how the explanatory variables associate with COVID-19 cases and deaths, and such
heterogeneity is dynamic over time, which is also supported by the better performance of
MGWR than that of GWR (Fig. 5 and Fig. 6). At the early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak
(mainly in March), the associations between the potential factors and the infected numbers in
most regions have not been well manifested except for the Chicago-centred Great Lake region
and the Tennessee-Arkansas-Mississippi region (Fig. 5c). However, since April, several
prominent hotspots of such correlations have been discovered including the states of California
and Florida as well as many middle east regions (Fig. 5d, g, h, k). These regions identified as
hotspots have characteristics of high population densities and hence the outbreak outcomes are
more likely to be explained by the selected factors, particularly the migration-related variables
of domestic migration behaviours. This implication again demonstrates the importance of
controlling people mobility as effective measures to combat the virus spread by the government
in high populated states (Badr et al., 2020), as those actions taken in other countries including
China (Kraemer et al., 2020). In terms of COVID-19 deaths, the spatial patterns of the
modelling outcomes also began to exhibit high explanatory powers over large scales after April
and remain stable during April-July, covering most of the contiguous US (except for a few
regions such as northern California and northern New York). These results confirm that the
selected factors of migration, household economic status etc. could well understand the deaths
caused by COVID-19 across counties and states during the study period.
Although the US is equipped with best healthcare facilities in the world, the high-level
response to the pandemic has been argued as inadequate and leading to ‚Äúsurprisingly‚Äù

26

resurgence of COVID-19 cases in e.g. California2. Currently, due to the unavailability of a
widespread vaccine, the most effective measures to protect from virus spread and minimise
exposure risk are still keeping social distances, wearing masks, and high frequency of washing
hands (Badr et al., 2020). At the state level, local governments have been sufficiently vigilant
to anticipate the situations and have taken preventive and protective measures (e.g.
implementing anti-contagion policies) beyond federal guidance to minimize the potential
damage. These government-imposed containment policies include, for instance, large event
bans, school closures, and mandating social distances, which could reduce the growth of new
cases (Courtemanche et al., 2020). State travel restrictions as well as quarantine rules for outof-state visitors have been put into practices by many states. Educational institutions transferred
from in-person classes to online meetings, or otherwise designed protocols specifying different
categories of students/staff/faculty members, regular testing, restricted public room usages, etc.
However, effort has been regarded as seemingly being put in vein based on the possible
rebounding trend of newly found cases3. Given the critics based on the fact that the US has the
number of cases far more than any other country, policy-makers have been placed on a verge
of taking critically adaptive and learning actions by referring to successful examples. China,
the world‚Äôs second largest economy following the US, has put tremendous resources for
controlling virus spread (primarily through city lockdown), which was reported as effective as
potentially prevented hundreds of thousands of cases outside Hubei province (WHO, 2020).
Challenges such as those rooted in difference in political systems are admittedly persistent
when learning from the way in which China respond to the virus crisis, yet quick actions as the
Chinese government has taken should be undoubtedly encouraged as the priority by other

countries (Kupferschmidt & Cohen, 2020). With more evidence accumulated for testing the
underlying forces of COVID-19 spread, it is urgent to call for taking serious and sophisticated
consideration by the federal government of socioeconomics and demographics especially
population migration at the county/state level in addition to physical protection at the individual
level. Without taking these temporally and spatially dynamic factors into account, the COVID19 mitigation outcomes and the future of public health of the country in response to the
pandemic would remain uncertain and risky.
The findings in the present studies are generally in agreement with previous
investigations while not only adding values to the existing knowledge of COVID-19 spread in
the US but also providing implications for combating the crisis worldwide. Consistent with
what have been previously found, several factors including climatic, environmental, socioeconomic, demographic, etc. have played key role in determining the overall casualties caused
by COVID-19 across the countries. For example, Bashir et al., (2020) found that minimum
temperature and average temperature are strongly correlated with the spread of COVID-19 in
New York city. Apart from that, specific humidity was found positively related with COVID19 in four US cities ‚Äì New Orleans, LA; Albany, GA; Chicago, IL; Seattle, WA (Runkle et al.,
2020). Different socio-economic factors, such as median household income equality,
percentage of nurse participation and percentage of black people, were also found as
determining factors of COVID-19 casualties (Mollalo et al., 2020). In addition, demographic
profile of the health care professional i.e., over 55 years old population, was found substantially
correlated with this disease (Dowd et al., 2020). Economic profile of the communities including
unemployed population and existence of socio-economic disparities, was also found as one of
the key regulating factors of COVID-19 casualties in the USA. The present study, however,
has not found any significant relationship between climate, air pollution and COVID-19 case
or deaths (Fig. S2). This finding is in line with the observation of Mollalo et al., 2020.

28

The present study had explored the local and global associations between the
explanatory factors and COVID-19 casualties at the county scale in the contiguous US. Though
this study had adopted many relevant approaches and methods to allow more accurate model
estimates, which can further be used as a reference for similar research interest and policy
design, still, the present research is not free from unavoidable uncertainties and biases that exist
both in parameter approximation and model design. Cumulated COVID-19 deaths and cases
were used as a dependent variable in the spatial models. Though, we have considered the latest
COVID-19 counts (COVID-19 data from January 22 to July 26, 2020, was collected) for the
modelling, still, there is high chance to have different estimates if the proposed models are
performed considering different time frame datasets. To clearly understand this uncertainty,
we compared our modelled estimates with Mollalo et al. observations. This study (Mollalo et
al. ) have conducted the analysis considering 90 days of aggregated COVID-19 data. While, in
the present research, we have considered 348 variables and sorted out 6 and 5 final uncorrelated
variables for COVID-19 cases and deaths, respectively, after considering nearly 184 days of
data (both aggregated and daily COVID-19 counts were considered). The final filtered
variables identified in our study has not matched perfectly with Mollalo et al. estimation. This
could be due to the difference in time frame taken between Mollalo et al. (90 days of COVID19 data) and our study (184 days of COVID-19 data). Moreover, in our study, we have
considered seven factors, i.e. crime, demography, education, ethnicity, employment, health,
and population & migration factors, for the modelling and subsequent interpretation. The
causal effects of the other factors, such as the lockdown date, the strictness of lockdown (partial
or complete), restrictions on social gathering and human mobility, etc. have not been explored
in the present research. This could be an issue for future research.
Conclusion

29

The present research aimed to explore the local and global associations between the
explanatory factors and COVID-19 counts in the contiguous US using various local and global
spatial regression models and machine learning algorithm. For capturing the time varying
effects of the causal factors on COVID-19 counts, several dynamic local parsimonious models
have been conceptualised. Among the confounding factors, crime, income, and migration were
found to be strongly associated with COVID-19 casualties, and hence explained the maximum
model variances. Both global and local associations among the parameters were varied highly
over space and could change across time. This spatial variability of the model estimates exhibit
the varied behaviour of the explanatory factors and COVID-19 incidences at the county scale.
To inform policy-makers at the nation and state levels, understanding the explanatory forces
and related confounding factors with spatial patterns is of paramount importance. Therefore,
the present study could be a reference for future spatial epidemiological research and informed
decision making in the case of crisis.
