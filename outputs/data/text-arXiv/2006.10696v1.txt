Conflict in Africa during COVID-19: social distancing, food vulnerability and welfare
response

28 MAY 2020
ABSTRACT
We study the effect of social distancing, food vulnerability, welfare and labour COVID19 policy responses on riots, violence against civilians and food-related conflicts. Our
analysis uses georeferenced data for 24 African countries with monthly local prices and
real-time conflict data reported in the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project
(ACLED) from January 2015 until early May 2020. Lockdowns and recent welfare
policies have been implemented in light of COVID-19, but in some contexts also likely
in response to ongoing conflicts. To mitigate the potential risk of endogeneity, we use
instrumental variables. We exploit the exogeneity of global commodity prices, and
three variables that increase the risk of COVID-19 and efficiency in response such as
countries colonial heritage, male mortality rate attributed to air pollution and prevalence
of diabetes in adults. We find that the probability of experiencing riots, violence against
civilians, food-related conflicts and food looting has increased since lockdowns. Food
vulnerability has been a contributing factor. A 10% increase in the local price index is
associated with an increase of 0.7 percentage points in violence against civilians.
Nonetheless, for every additional anti-poverty measure implemented in response to
COVID-19 the probability of experiencing violence against civilians, riots and foodrelated conflicts declines by approximately 0.2 percentage points. These anti-poverty
measures also reduce the number of fatalities associated with these conflicts. Overall,
our findings reveal that food vulnerability has increased conflict risks, but also offer an
optimistic view of the importance of the state in providing an extensive welfare safety
net.

1. INTRODUCTION
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, several governments have implemented social
distancing measures. Although these measures have shown to be effective in curbing
the spread of the novel-coronavirus, they have also shown to cause significant
economic, social and political disruption (Barrett, 2020; Senghore, Savi, Gnangnon,
Hanage, & Okeke, 2020). This is particularly the case for the developing world, which
relies largely on the informal economy, still has high levels of poverty, with weak health
and welfare systems, and where the majority of the population simply do not have the
luxury to work remotely. For instance, in Africa, right before the pandemic outbreak,
one in every five people was suffering from severe food insecurity, affecting nearly 277
million people. These vulnerable people had run out of food, most likely experienced
hunger, even gone for days without eating, putting their well-being at a great danger
(FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP, & WHO, 2019). As a result of the pandemic, several
forecasts predict that between 60-240 million people worldwide could be pushed into
poverty, depending on the efficiency in providing urgent and adequate relief to
vulnerable citizens and struggling businesses (Ahamed & Gutiérrez-Romero, 2020;
Sumner, Hoy, & Ortiz-Juarez, 2020). The sudden loss of jobs and livelihoods for
millions of people have caused food shortages and inflation, an explosive combination
for uprisings.
This paper analyses two key questions. First, to what extent are social distancing
measures, lockdowns and food vulnerability fuelling conflicts. Second, whether
recently implemented COVID-19 anti-poverty programmes could curb such conflicts.
We focus on the 24 African countries for which we have monthly data on local prices
and real-time conflict data reported in the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data
Project (ACLED).1 We analyse four types of conflicts likely to arise as a result of
COVID-19: riots, violence against civilians, food-related conflicts and food looting.
We focus on these events from 1 January 2015 until 2 May 2020. We combine ACLED
with the exact dates of early social distancing and lockdowns. To assess the role of food
vulnerability and conflict, we construct a monthly index of local prices based on data
from the Global Food Prices Database (WFP) and the USAID FEWS-NET. These

ACLED provides real-time georeferenced data (with latitude and longitude

coordinates) on the number of conflicts, associated fatalities, actors involved and exact
date, including day and month of conflict (C. Raleigh & Dowd, 2016).

datasets provide monthly commodity prices at a sub-country level, across 990 local
markets, in 24 African countries for the entire period analysed here. We also construct
an index of welfare and labour COVID-19 policy response based on the 12 types of
interventions (such as cash-based transfers, utility support and wage subsidy), gathered
by (Gentilini, Almenfi, Dale, Demarco, & Santos, 2020). We take the date of
implementation of these measures from Hale et al. (2020). We add a wide-range of
georeferenced controls at the sub-country level for areas of approximately 55x55 km
including nightlight, mobile phone coverage of 2G-3G, percentage of mountains, the
existence of petroleum fields, mines, diamond mines, size of the area, electricity
coverage, primary roads coverage, population, infant mortality rate and cultivated land.
The man-imposed mobility restrictions to curb the COVID-19 pandemic add an
extra layer of complexity to ongoing conflicts and food vulnerability. COVID-19
interventions (social distancing, welfare and labour policies) have been strongly
dependent on political, economic and social contexts, thus, they are unlikely to be
exogenous to existing conflicts. To mitigate potential endogeneity concerns, we use
instrumental variables. As instruments we use the male mortality rate attributed to
household and ambient air pollution for the year 2016 and the percentage of diabetes
prevalence among the adult population (aged 20 -79) over the years 2010-2019. Both
instruments are known risk factors to COVID-19 mortality (Fattorini & Regoli, 2020;
Hussain, Bhowmik, & do Vale Moreira, 2020), and are thus likely to influence the
decision of the state as when to impose social distancing measures. We also use the
IMF global commodity monthly price index as a proxy for exogenous economic shocks.
We also consider as instrument the colonial heritage of the analysed countries, as
colonial history is known to affect the quality of existing institutions (Nash & Patel,
2019).
The paper offers four key findings. First, there is no evidence that early social
distancing measures, such as banning some international flights, fuelled conflicts.
However, despite the global call for ceasefire during the pandemic, local lockdowns
have increased the probability of countries experiencing riots, violence against civilians
and food-related conflicts. Second, we find that a 10% increase in the local price index
is associated with a 0.7 percentage point increase in violence against civilians. This
violence is more likely to occur in areas with cultivated land, in agreement with the
theoretical literature that suggests that when food supply declines these areas are more
vulnerable to rebel groups seeking resource appropriation, such as food
3

(Rezaeedaryakenari, Landis, & Thies, 2020). Third, we find that the urgent welfare and
labour anti-poverty initiatives implemented in light of COVID-19 have contributed to
reducing the conflicts analysed. For instance, for every additional anti-poverty measure
(nearly a 0.1 increase in the welfare/labour COVID-19 index), the probability of
experiencing violence against civilians, riots and food-related conflicts declines by
approximately 0.2 percentage points. These anti-poverty measures also reduce the
number of fatalities associated with these conflicts. Fourth, we also analysed the
number of conflicts in which the state was directly involved as an actor (either
instigating or responding to contain violence) and distinguish between food related and
violence against civilians. We find that in countries that have provided a higher number
of welfare and labour anti-poverty policies, the state is less likely to be involved as an
actor in food-related conflicts. Paradoxically, in these countries the state is more likely
to be involved as an actor in violence against civilians, but the evidence suggests this is
an attempt to strictly enforce local lockdowns.
There is scant but growing literature on the relationship between aid, antipoverty projects and conflict (E. Berman, Shapiro, & Felter, 2011; Crost, Felter, &
Johnston, 2014; Nunn & Qian, 2014). The literature has offered quite mixed findings
and is far from reaching a consensus. Nonetheless, there is more promising evidence
that cash transfers are successful in reducing food vulnerability and poverty in the
Africa context (Chakrabarti, Handa, Natali, Seidenfeld, & Tembo, 2020). There is also
evidence that (conditional) cash transfers can reduce the incidence of violent conflicts
if adequately tailored to local contexts (Crost, Felter, & Johnston, 2016; Pena, Urrego,
& Villa, 2017). Our results resonate with these encouraging findings on conflict
reduction.
A wide range of anti-poverty policies has been implemented (with at least five
simultaneous and ongoing anti-poverty COVID-19 initiatives in the most active
countries analysed here). Thus, it is not possible to disentangle in our analysis which
specific action (if cash transfers, relief for utility bills, extended pension benefits, etc.)
has been the one most likely to have reduced conflict. We nonetheless can ascertain that
from the 24 analysed countries with COVID-19 welfare and labour policies, roughly
70% have implemented cash-transfers and 30% provided relief in paying utility bills.
Also, the countries with a broader net of COVID-19 economic support, with more
initiatives, are reducing the most the probability of experiencing conflicts and
associated fatalities.
4

Our results also resonate with the earlier literature on food vulnerability, proxied
by changes in local prices, and conflict (Brück & d’Errico, 2019; Jones, Mattiacci, &
Braumoeller, 2017; Rezaeedaryakenari et al., 2020). The vast majority of food
consumed in Africa (90%) comes from domestic producers (Clionad Raleigh, Choi, &
Kniveton, 2015). Theoretically, one could argue that rises in local prices might benefit
local producers. In reality, most producers in Africa are net consumers of food, which
explains why increases in food prices can severely fuel conflicts. Thus, overall our
findings highlight the importance of providing urgent welfare and labour assistance to
curb conflicts.
The paper continues as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of the literature.
We do not attempt to provide a discussion of the extensive literature on conflict, which
can be found in detailed reviews (e.g. Blattman & Miguel, 2010; Collier & Hoeffler,
2014). Instead, we provide a summary of the conflict studies with relevance for
COVID-19. Section 3 describes our data and instruments. Section 4 describes the
econometric method used. Section 5 shows the results. Section 6 presents our
conclusions.

2. LOCKDOWNS, PRICE VOLATILITY AND COVID-19 ASSISTANCE
For millions of people, the immediate concern is not the actual novel coronavirus itself,
but surviving the economic hardship imposed by the lockdowns. Theoretically, there
are at least three critical mechanisms by which lockdowns could fuel violent conflicts,
despite the restrictions on population mobility. We describe these three important
mechanisms (lockdowns, food vulnerability and welfare assistance) next.

2.1 Early social distancing measures and stricter lockdowns
Since the lockdowns, around the world some violent and non-violent crimes and
conflicts have declined substantially.2 However, in some countries, other conflicts have
increased as the lockdowns intensified, such as riots and violence against civilians. Two
key aspects could explain the rise in these conflicts. First, the existence of ongoing
2

For instance, robbery and assault have plunged in Latin America, USA and European

cities as the lockdowns limited population mobility and ease the job of the police in
spotting and arresting suspects. Nonetheless domestic violence has risen, as well as
cybercrimes (The Economist, 2020).
5

conflicts. Second, the way in which lockdowns have been enforced (with or without a
safety net).
To address areas with pre-existing conflicts, the United Nations, on 23 March
2020, called for an immediate global ceasefire to allow medical personnel to reach the
vulnerable population in these areas (UN News, 2020). The plea for a ceasefire has
nonetheless been largely ignored. According to ACLED (2020) out of the 43 countries
with at least 50 events of organised violence before lockdowns, only ten experienced
unilateral ceasefire, another 31 countries experienced an increase in the rates of
organised violence, such as Mexico, Iraq, Mozambique and Syria.3
Other conflicts emerged soon after lockdowns over food shortages such as in
Lesotho, South Africa, Zimbabwe as citizens who suddenly lost their livelihoods
desperately tried to get access to food parcels handed out by authorities (J. Burke,
2020). As governments face riots and revolts over food shortages and pleas for urgent
assistance, there is a significant risk of using excessive force against civilians in the
forms of military or police that could increase even further grievances and unrest. Even
in countries without food riots or food lootings, governments risk using excessive force
against civilians to enforce lockdowns.

2.2 Food vulnerability
Millions of people in Africa were already struggling to have enough to eat due to
ongoing armed conflicts, extreme weather and long-historical institutional failures.
However, this man-made imposed mobility restrictions to curb the COVID-19
pandemic add an extra layer of complexity. Perhaps one of the significant concerns of
lockdowns is its effect on food vulnerability. Lockdowns have imposed tight mobility
restrictions to farmers that have hampered efforts in delivering essential food and basic
stables in at least 33 of Africa’s 54 countries (Mutsaka, 2020). Although the pandemic
has not disrupted the harvest per se, there are media reports of farmers in Africa with
rotting crops as lorries have failed to arrive due to lockdown restrictions (Barrett, 2020;
3

The abysmal response is perhaps not surprising. Ceasefires have slim chances of

working in deeply entrenched conflicts, and in many instances, violence returns with a
vengeance soon after (P. Burke, 2016). Although having a history of failed agreements
surprisingly can lead to negotiating a ceasefire eventually, it is first required to have a
record of failed attempts (Joshi & Quinn, 2015) that can only be built over time.
6

George, 2020). These lockdowns have also shut down many informal food markets
where people earn their daily living, leaving large segments of the population without
necessary provisions, and with real prospects of having not enough to eat. Moreover,
school closures will also imply that nearly 370 million children worldwide risk missing
out on school meals provided by the World Food Programme (WFM, 2020).
Major food supply chains have been a catalytic feature of many historical
conflicts ranging from the French Revolution until the violent unrest that eventually led
to the Arab Spring (Barrett, 2020). As such, there is an extensive literature detailing
how sudden food insecurity leads directly or indirectly to violent riots and social unrest
(Brück & d’Errico, 2019; Jones et al., 2017; Clionad Raleigh et al., 2015;
Rezaeedaryakenari et al., 2020). According to this literature, there are at least three
critical channels through which food vulnerability increases riots and violence against
civilians.
First, at the individual level, food vulnerability deprives people from the most
basic human right, enhances grievances and highlights differences in food entitlements,
among those who can afford the luxury of food stuck for weeks and those who cannot
even afford a meal a day (Hendrix & Brinkman, 2013; Jones et al., 2017). Survival
instincts and grievances reduce the opportunity costs of engaging in violent riots against
government, food looting and even joining rebel groups recruiting people in exchange
for food and economic support during quarantines. Similar exchanges of food and
“COVID-19 support packages” have been seen in Italy and Mexico with mafias and
drug cartels, which are highly unlikely to be given without any form of expected
reciprocity (Tondo, 2020). The literature has also reported such rebel and organised
crime tactics in connection to food vulnerability and conflict in Africa (Humphreys &
Weinstein, 2008). Rises in local food prices are a good proxy for food shortages and
food vulnerability. Although theoretically, producers could benefit from an increase in
prices, in the African context, most producers are net consumers of food, hence rises in
local and international prices make producers worse off given the higher net cost of the
food basket (Lee & Ndulo, 2011).4
4

This negative effect is the case for most African states since they are neither major

importers nor exporters (Clionad Raleigh et al., 2015). Similarly, an increase in local
prices worsens food insecurity of consumers by reducing their ability to procure
essential food to survive (Jones et al., 2017).
7

Second, at the rebels group level, food vulnerabilities also have a direct impact
on the group ability to mobilise resources to support activities. Some rebel groups might
have also lost substantial revenues from the sudden drop in prices of natural resources
which they might have illegal access to such as oil. With such falls in profits, rebel
groups have higher incentives to victimise ordinary citizens seeking resource
appropriation, such as food. The areas with the largest share of cultivation are most
susceptible to such rebel tactics, particularly during food shortages (Rezaeedaryakenari
et al., 2020).
Third, at the national level, the government has a crucial role to play in dealing
with food vulnerability and food-related conflicts. Governments might have different
tolerance for food-related conflicts driven by ordinary citizens desperate for survival or
if driven by rebel groups (Rezaeedaryakenari et al., 2020). Nonetheless, governments
might use excessive violence against civilians to prevent further violent clashes and
enforce strict lockdowns, depending on its ability to both provide adequate and urgent
humanitarian support to struggling families during quarantines, and manage tactfully
potential unrests.

2.3 COVID-19 welfare and labour assistance
Sudden lockdowns imposed without any safety net in place to help vulnerable
populations risks pushing millions of people into extreme poverty and are likely to fuel
conflicts.

Developing countries are particularly constrained given the recent

devaluation of many of their currencies, plummeting oil prices, and the collapse of
major economic sectors. Despite this dark economic scenario, over 159 countries have
implemented urgent welfare assistance and labour policies to deal with COVID-19
(Gentilini et al., 2020). The extent to which these packages manage to restrain
significant increases in poverty and conflict will depend on their outreach. That is
whether the extended COVID-19 welfare net can support households in difficult-toreach rural areas, entrenched in conflicts.
From the vast literature on conflict, we know a great deal about how economic
crises and shocks increase civil conflicts, riots and violence against civilians (Blattman
& Miguel, 2010; Miguel, Satyanath, & Sergenti, 2004). Related literature offers mixed
evidence on the extent to which foreign aid and foreign food aid can reduce the
incidence of conflicts. Various studies have found that aid can reduce conflicts as it
increases popular support for governments and increases the cost of opportunity of
8

joining rebel and insurgent groups (E. Berman et al., 2011; de Ree & Nillesen, 2009;
Nielsen, Findley, Davis, Candland, & Nielson, 2011). However, other studies have also
found that (food) aid can increase both the incidence and the duration of civil conflicts
(Nunn & Qian, 2014). Anti-poverty transfers such as community-driven programmes
and food aid supplies have also been found to increase the intensity of conflicts (Crost
et al., 2014) as insurgent groups sabotage these programmes to prevent weakening their
ability to recruit future members.5 A similar positive association has been found
between increased conflict and rural employment programmes (Khanna &
Zimmermann, 2014).
A small but growing strand of the literature has also studied the link between
conditional cash transfers and conflict. The evidence is again somehow mixed. Some
countries with deeply entrenched conflicts have ongoing conditional cash transfers
without showing any direct link, such as the case of Mexico (Gutiérrez-Romero &
Oviedo, 2018). Nonetheless, conditional cash transfers designed with the implicit aim
of dismantling guerrilla groups have been found successful in reducing conflicts.6 The
literature suggests that these type of anti-poverty programmes can reduce the capacity
of insurgents to recruit combatants from villages, increase electoral support for the
incumbent government (Labonne, 2013), and increase the cost of opportunity of joining
illegal activities in settings with long-entrenched civil conflicts (Pena et al., 2017).
Nonetheless, it is unclear the extent to which countries with high rates of extreme
poverty and exacerbated food vulnerability due to lockdowns will respond to the urgent
and wide range of welfare and labour COVID-19 assistance packages. Many of the
urgent welfare packages introduced are unconditional cash transfers that have shown to
reduce food vulnerabilities and poverty in Africa as well as in other developing regions,
but with a lesser known effect on conflict (Chakrabarti et al., 2020; Tiwari et al., 2016).
5

There is also mixed evidence on whether community driven programmes can indeed

reduce poverty as they can be used for clientelistic purposes and suffer from corruption
(Gutiérrez-Romero, 2013).
6

An example of such initiatives is the conditional cash transfer introduced in Colombia

in 1999 in response to the major economic crises that affected Latin America (Familias
en Acción). This conditional cash transfer reduced the probability of conflict and
demobilised combatants, mainly children aged 10-17 (Pena et al., 2017). Similar
evidence has been found in the Philippines (Crost et al., 2016).
9

Similarly, it is unclear whether governments in the developing world will have to rely
on excessive use of force to guarantee lockdowns and curb potential violent unrests.
We address these questions in the next sections.

3. DATA
3.1 Data on conflict
The data for all the dependent variables used on conflict come from the Armed Conflict
Location and Event Data Project (ACLED). ACLED collects real-time data on all
reported political violence and protests around the globe using a range of sources such
as government reports, local media, humanitarian agencies, and research publications
(C. Raleigh & Dowd, 2016). It has the main advantage of providing georeferenced data
at the sub-country level by day and month within each year.7
In this paper we focus exclusively on four types of conflicts: riots, violence
against civilians, food-related conflicts, and more specifically, food looting reported in
ACLED from 1 January 2015 until 2 May 2020. Riots are defined by ACLED as a
violent form of demonstration. Violence against civilians is defined as any armed or
violent group attacking unarmed civilians who are not engaged in political violence (C.
Raleigh & Dowd, 2016). Governments, rebels, militias and rioters can all be involved
in these violent acts against civilians that can include attacks, abduction, forced
disappearance and sexual violence. Food-related conflicts are not directly categorised
in the publically available ACLED dataset. However, we identify these food-related
conflicts based on the detailed description of each of the events reported in ACLED.
We analyse the ACLED’s conflicts reported on a daily basis, that is without
doing any aggregation on a monthly or yearly basis by country. This fine level of
granularity as when the conflicts took place allows us to exploit the variation with which
early social distancing measures, lockdowns and welfare/labour COVID-19 policy
responses were implemented across countries.

7

ACLED provides the exact number of conflicts, associated fatalities, location, exact

date and actors involved across six broad types of conflict (which can be subcategorised further). These six types of conflicts are: battles, explosions (e.g. suicide
bombs, grenades), violence against civilians, protests, riots and strategic developments
(e.g. non-violent actions on agreements, arrests, disrupted weapons use, etc).
10

3.2 Dates of social distancing and lockdowns measures
As COVID-19 spread around the globe, a wide range of social distancing measures and
more strict lockdowns have been implemented. We obtain the exact date on which the
first ever social distancing was implemented as well as the date of local lockdowns8
from the publically available data on COVID-19 Government Response Tracker
(OxCGRT), by Hale et al. (2020).9

At the time of writing this paper, OxCGRT did

not include data on social distancing measures for 13 African countries (Benin,
Burundi, Central African Republic, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau,
Ivory Coast, Liberia, Republic of Congo, Senegal, Somalia and Tongo).10 For all these
13 countries, we took information on the exact date of early social distancing and
lockdown from ACAPS (2020). From this database, we also took the period of the
lockdown of Nigeria. Table A.1, in the Appendix, lists the dates of early social
distancing and lockdowns for the countries we focus on in this paper.

8

We obtain the exact date of lockdowns based on the date in which any of the eight

reported social distancing measures took the highest ordinal value of 4, signalling the
severity of lockdown.
9

OxCGRT provides exact dates on when each of the social distancing measures were

implemented across 149 countries, from January 2020 until 29 April 2020. This
database contains the exact data on eight types of social distancing. These include:
international travel restrictions, limitations on internal movement, closure of schools,
closure of workplace, cancellations of public events, restrictions of large gatherings,
stay at home requirements and restrictions on public transport. This information was
collected from media, government reports and other publicly available sources. Another
advantage of this dataset is that it provides an ordinal value of 1-4 to each of the eight
social distancing implemented that helps to ascertain the level of their severity. The full
methodology on how this dataset was collected and is being developed is available in
the live report provided by (Hale et al., 2020).
10

We do not have data on local prices for all these additional countries, but the dates of

their lockdowns help doing the preliminary spatial analysis as well as the regression
discontinuity plots presented in section 3.
11

3.3 Constructing a monthly local index of prices at the market level
To measure the link between food vulnerability and conflict, we use data from the
Global Food Prices Database (WFP). This dataset reports monthly commodity prices at
a sub-country level, across 985 local markets, in 23 African countries from the 1990s
until May 2020 for which there is also information on conflicts in ACLED. We add
information for Zimbabwe not included in WFP, from the USAID FEWS-NET dataset
that also provides monthly local food prices. We focus our analysis on the 24 African
countries, listed in Table A.1 that shows the countries for which we have data on local
prices from 1 January 2015 until 2 May 2020.
The two sources of local prices used report a wide range of commodities, which
are often not consistent across countries given the differences in diet and staple foods.
Thus, we construct instead an index of monthly price of the most frequent commodity
within each market.11 This approach has also been used in the literature to overcome
the variance in commodity baskets within and across countries (Clionad Raleigh et al.,
2015). In our econometric analysis, we take January 2015 as the base for the index for
each market, which allows us to assess to what extent the index of local prices has
changed since then. For each conflict reported in ACLED we add the local price index
of their closest food market within the same month, year and country where the conflict
took place.

3.4 Constructing an index of welfare and labour COVID-19 policy
We construct an overall welfare and labour index based on these 12 different types of
interventions implemented to deal with COVID-19, compiled by (Gentilini et al., 2020).
By the period of our analysis, 1 May 2020, a total of 159 countries had implemented
some sort of welfare and labour COVID-19 policy.12 We use a simple additive
11

That is for each market we construct a consumer price index as the sum of the total

expenditure of most common items sold by multiplying price times quantity and adding
them. The basket compared in each market is such that can be comparable over time.
Then we divide the monthly consumer price index by the value of the index in the base
year (January 2015).
12

These can be grouped into three broad categories. The first one, social assistance

interventions include: cash-based transfers, public works, in-kind/school feeding and
utility/financial support. The second, social insurance policies include: paid
12

unweighted index to measure the whole range of various welfare and labour COVID19 policy response.13 In theory our index can take values from 0 (no intervention) up to
1 (a country that has taken all 12 types of interventions). In practice, the overall index
ranges from 0 to slightly above 0.4 (that is, with five ongoing policies). Since Gentilini
et al. (2020) do not include the exact date as when these interventions have been put in
place, we take this information instead from Hale et al. (2020). 14
Table A.2 in Appendix lists the welfare and labour policies implemented in each
of the 24 African countries we focus on. From the 19 countries with an on-going
COVID-19 welfare and labour policy, 12 have provided cash-transfers (among other
policies); while the other seven have provided utility and financial support. Labour
interventions are the least used thus far. Among the 24 countries analysed, only Egypt
has adopted recent labour regulations.

leave/unemployment, health insurance support, pensions and disability benefits and
social security contributions. The last one, labour market interventions: include wage
subsidy, training, labour regulation and reduced work time subsidy.
13

Various methods can be used to create composite indices such as additive,

multiplicative and weighting some aspects with principal components analysis (Hale et
al., 2020). We use the additive method as there are few interventions which might not
merit using principal component analysis. We are not interested either in which policy
explains the most variance in responses, rather to simply come with an index that
measures the whole range of interventions in each country, which has the advantage of
being simpler to interpret.
14

To construct the index of welfare and labour COVID-19 response packages we prefer

to use Gentilini et al. (2020) given the more extensive list of actions and programmes
taken in each country 12 concrete actions over four categories of actions reported in
Hale et al. (2020).

3.5 Other important controls at sub-country level
Based on the extensive literature on conflict, we also include a wide range of control
variables to mitigate potential confounding or unobserved characteristics. At the
country-level, we include the ethnolinguistic fractionalisation index. At the district
level, we use the monthly average of the stable nightlight luminosity from the DMSPOLS Nighttime Light, from the USA Air Force Weather Agency. To avoid potential
endogeneity issues, we use the monthly nightlight for the year 2015 only. We also use
the log of the cultivated district, and size of the area (district) taken from the publicly
available data from Rezaeedaryakenari et al. (2020). The remaining controls are drawn
from the publicly available data from Manacorda and Tesei (2020) that allows us to
construct data on georeferenced areas of on average about 55x55 km to each of the
conflict events reported in ACLED. The variables used are the mobile phone coverage
of 2G-3G, percentage of mountains, percentage of forests, the existence of petroleum

and infant mortality rate. In Table A.3 we list the sources of each variable.15 These
variables help us to control for natural resources conflicts (N. Berman, Couttenier,
Rohner, & Thoenig, 2017; Fenske & Zurimendi, 2017). Population size and mountains
are also among the most relevant and statistically significant controls in the conflict
literature (Collier & Hoeffler, 2014). Mobile phone coverage has been found crucial for
political mobilisation and riots (Manacorda & Tesei, 2020). Similarly, the density of
roads is important for the spatial distribution of conflict in Africa (Detges, 2016).

3.6 Instrumental variables
COVID-19 interventions have been highly dependent on political and economic
contexts. Hence it would be hard to argue that social distancing, lockdowns and
welfare/labour COVID-19 policy response have been exogenous or independent from
existing conflicts within each country. For this reason, our econometric specification
focuses on using instrumental variables. We use four instruments. We use the male
mortality rate attributed to household and ambient air pollution per 100,000, based on
standardised age, at the national level for the year 2016 and the percentage of diabetes
prevalence among the adult population (aged 20 -79) at the national level over the years
2010-2019. Both instruments have been found in the medical literature as risk factors
to COVID-19 (Fattorini & Regoli, 2020; Hussain et al., 2020), thus are likely to
influence state’s decision as to when to impose social distancing measures and the
severity of lockdowns. We also include the IMF overall commodity monthly price
index over the years 2015-2020 (including food, agriculture, fuel and non-fuel prices).
This index is representative of the global market and is determined by the largest import
market of a given commodity. This overall index helps to denote the severity of external
fluctuations which might affect how countries respond to adopt different welfare and
labour COVID-19 policies. The extent of the generosity of these packages is likely to
depend on existing welfare structures and institutions, thus is likely shaped by colonial
heritage (Nash & Patel, 2019). Hence, we also include a series of dummy variables
denoting whether the country is a former British, French, Portuguese, German, Belgian

15

We do not describe these variables in detail here as we refer the reader to the detailed

description available in Manacorda and Tesei’s article. We take this information for the
latest year available in their series, year 2012.

or American Colonisation Society colony. Table A.3 lists the sources of these
instruments.

3.7 Description of conflicts
We start by providing a broad description of the conflicts reported in ACLED for the
entire African continent from 1 January 2015 until 2 May 2020. Figures 2, 3 and 4 show
that soon after lockdowns the incidence of riots, violence against civilians and foodrelated conflicts increased when compared to the incidence of these conflicts to the
period before lockdowns.

Figure 5 illustrates the spatial distribution of riots, violence against civilians and
food-related violence before (1 January 2015-before lockdown) and after lockdowns.
These figures suggest that conflicts that erupted after lockdowns are more spatially
17

concentrated in areas that had already ongoing conflicts. The maps on the right side of
Figure 5 also shows that food-related conflicts are more concentrated in areas with a
higher share of cultivated land (denoted by a darker colour). In a pre-COVID study,
Rezaeedaryakenari et al. (2020) had noted the same spatial correlation. They suggested
that the areas with more cultivation provide greater utility for forcible appropriation by
rebels for the acquisition of food. When the aggregate food supply shrinks, as is likely
the case after lockdowns, these geographical regions become a priority target.
Since we are concerned with the role of food volatility, the rest of our analysis
focuses exclusively on the 24 countries for which we have data on local food prices.
Table A.4 provides a summary description for these 24 countries from 1 January 2015
until 2 May 2020. In total there are 42,010 conflicts reported (including battles,
explosions (e.g. suicide bombs, grenades), violence against civilians, protests, riots and
strategic developments. About a third of these events (28%) were violence against
civilians and nearly a quarter (13%) was riots, with a minority of food-related conflicts
and food looting (2%). The state has been involved as an actor in nearly 32% of all
reported ACLED conflict cases.
The total and average of the fatalities per event are also reported in Table A.4.
In total there were 169,454 fatalities associated with any conflict reported in ACLED,
from 1 January 2015 until 2 May 2020. There were 4,552 fatalities associated with riots,
50,506 fatalities associated with violence against civilians and 6,888 fatalities
associated with any food-related conflicts (including food looting), with 4,344 fatalities
due to food looting.
Figure 6 illustrates the potential link between violence against civilians, local
food prices and the IMF global commodity index. We focus only on the 24 countries
for which we have local food prices. Only for Figure 6 we aggregate the data at monthly
level for each country. We also standardise each of the three depicted variables such
that their monthly average is divided by the maximum value of each variable for the
entire series. Thus, the y-axis shows how much the monthly series fluctuates from the
highest level achieved within each country.

Figure 5. Conflict and lockdowns

For some countries, there is a particularly strong correlation between local food
prices and conflicts such as Ethiopia, Nigeria and Rwanda. However, there are many
exceptions where the local prices have increased, whereas violence against civilians has
not. That is the case of Burkina Faso, Malawi and Namibia. This evidence might
suggest that albeit rises in food prices might have contributed to some conflicts, but the
welfare and labour COVID-19 interventions could have dampened some of the violence

4. ESTIMATION FRAMEWORK
We use two econometric specifications to estimate the impact of social distancing
measures, price volatility and welfare and labour COVID-19 policies on conflict. First,
we use a panel random effects (RE) model, as shown in equation (1). The RE model
has two main advantages. First, this specification can simultaneously model both timevariant and time-invariant effects (Bell & Jones, 2015). Second, the RE specification
can deal with hierarchical data (in our case having repeated observations in sub-country
level, cells, nested within countries, the higher-level fixed units), the reason why this
specification is also known as the multilevel, hierarchical or mixed model.

conflictjit = α + δ1Sit + δ2log local pricejit + δ3Xji + δ4Ci + (ηji +εjit)

(1)

We focus on the incidence of four types of conflicts: riots, violence against
civilians, food-related conflict incidents and food looting in the cell j (with reported
latitude and longitude in ACLED) located in country i in day, month and year t
(conflictjit). Our dependent variable is binary for each of the four types of conflicts
analysed. Sit is a vector that includes the three COVID-19 interventions we focus on:
the first social distancing measure implemented16, local lockdown measure and the
welfare and labour COVID-19 policy index in country i implemented at day, month,
year t. The first social distancing measure refers to the date in which this was
implemented. Lockdown takes the value of 0 or 1 depending on if the conflict occurred
before or after the respective lockdown. The monthly local price index (measured in
log) at cell j in country i ranges from January 2015 until 2 May 2020. Xji is a vector that
captures our controls at the cell j located in country i and includes: the percentage of
mountains, forests, whether the cell has petroleum fields, mines, diamond mines, size
of the area (district level). In addition, vector X includes some key variables lagged in
time to mitigate potential endogeneity issues. These lagged variables are the stable
nightlight (measured in log for the year 2015), the percentage of mobile phone coverage
in 2G-3G, the percentage of electricity coverage, primary roads coverage, population,
infant mortality, percentage of land cultivated. Vector C includes the ethnolinguistic
fractionalisation index, at country level i. (ηji +εjit) denotes the time-invariant and timevariant error term. The results of the RE specifications are shown in Table 1, columns
1-4.
The RE estimates will be unbiased if there are no strong sources of endogeneity
such as omitted variable due to unobserved heterogeneity. However, we suspect that
the RE specifications are biased, given the unlikely exogenous characteristics of the
three COVID-19 interventions we focused on. We therefore add to our RE specification
IV-2SLS estimates to address this potential endogeneity.

We instrument our three

likely endogenous variables: the date of the first social distancing measure, whether in

16

This index takes the value of 0 before any policy included in the index was

implemented, and takes the value of the constructed index after the first welfare/labour
COVID- response policy was implemented according to Hale et al. (2020).
21

lockdown and the welfare and labour COVID-19 policy index denoted by Sit. Our
instruments, denoted by vector Zit, are: male mortality rate attributed to household and
ambient air pollution per 100,000 (lagged for year 2016), diabetes prevalence (% of
population ages 20 to 79, years 2010-2019), IMF all commodity price index (years
2015-2020), whether the country is a former British, French, Portuguese, German,
Belgian or American Colonisation Society colony. The first-stage relationship between
our three endogenous variables, Sit. and our instruments Zit are shown in equation (2).

Sit = γ + µ1Zit + µ2log local pricejit + µ3Xji + µ4Ci + vjit

(2)

The second-stage equation estimates the impact of the instrumented Ŝ COVID19 responses on the incidence of conflict, as denoted by equation (3). The (ξji +ϕjit)
denotes the time-invariant and time-variant error term. We implement this IV
regression using panel random effects.

conflictjit = κ + β1Ŝit + β2log local pricejit + β3Xji + β4Ci + (ξji +ϕjit)

(3)

The results of the second-stage IV-2SLS regression are reported in Table (1), in
columns 5-8. At the bottom of the table, we report the Sargan-Hanssen
overidentification tests. The null hypothesis of this test is that the over-identifying
restrictions are valid. We also present the Hausman endogeneity test. The first-stage
regression is shown in Table A.5. In sum, all our instruments are strongly correlated to
the endogenous variables, satisfy the overidentification tests. There is evidence that the
COVID-19 measures of lockdowns and welfare assistance are endogenous, hence
implemented in response to conflicts, in particular in column 6 and 7 (violence against
civilians and food-related incidents).

Therefore these second-stage IV 2SLS

regressions are our preferred specifications.

5. RESULTS
5.1 Riots, violence against civilians and food-related conflict
Early social distancing measures are not statistically significant with the incidence of
the conflicts analysed, riots, violence against civilians food-related conflicts and food
looting. That is the case in the random specifications RE with and without using
instrumental variables (Table 1, columns 1-8). The non-significant effect is
unsurprising since many of these early measures did not impose any mobility
restrictions on the population but mostly focused on having some travel restrictions
from abroad. The stricter lockdown measures yield different results. If focused on the
IV-2SLS results, Table 1, columns 5-8, show that the probability of experiencing riots,
violence against civilians, food-related conflicts and food looting did increase after
lockdowns, as our earlier figures 2, 3 and 4 had shown.
Table 1 also shows that contemporaneous changes in prices are positively and
statistically associated with violence against civilians (but not to riots, food-related
conflicts or food looting). Specifically, a 10% increase in the value of the local price
index is associated with a rise of 0.71 percentage point increase in violence against
civilians. The same results are obtained when using the RE specifications with or
without instrumenting. Among other variables prominently cited in the literature, we
can conclude that riots are more likely to occur in more urbanised settings as they have
higher levels of stable nightlight, mobile phone, electricity coverage and population. In
contrast, violence against civilians seems to be concentrated in less urbanised settings
as they have lower levels of stable nightlight, less electricity coverage, primary roads,
but more cultivated land and mines.
Food-related incidents and food looting are more likely to occur in areas with a
greater density of cultivated land, as Figure 5 suggested. However, the volatility of local
prices is not associated with these food-related conflicts. These areas seem to be less
urbanised as they have less density of primary roads, electricity.
There is also strong evidence from the IV-2SLS specifications that the welfare
and labour COVID-19 policy index has reduced the probability of riots, violence
against civilians and food-related conflicts, including food looting. For instance,
Figures 7, 8 and 9 show the marginal effect of the probability of experiencing riots,
violence against civilians and food-related conflicts with the values of the welfare and
labour COVID-19 policy index. These marginal effects depict the IV-2SLS
specifications shown in Table 1, columns 5-7. The effect of the index is negative and
23

linearly associated with the probability of experiencing riots. Specifically, a 0.1 unit
increase in the welfare/labour COVID-19 policy index, the likelihood of experiencing
these conflicts declines by nearly 0.2 percentage points.

5.2 Fatalities
We next explore the total number of fatalities, as our new dependent variables to assess
the magnitude of the conflicts analysed thus far. We analyse the number of fatalities
reported in ACLED from 1 January 2015 until 2 May 2020 associated with any conflict.
We also focus on the number of fatalities exclusively related to the conflicts of our
interest: riots, violence against civilians and food-related conflicts (including food
looting). As before, we use two specifications: panel random effects (RE) and panel
random effects with IV-2SLS. Table 2 reports the results. As before at the bottom of
the table, we report the Sargan-Hanssen overidentification test and the Hausman
endogeneity tests. The first-stage regression results are reported in Table A.6. These
first-stage regressions, along with the overidentification tests, suggest the instruments
25

are valid. Again, we find evidence of endogeneity, particularly for all ACLED fatalities
and fatalities due to violence against civilians (Table 2, columns 5 and 7).
The IV-2SLS specifications show that early social distancing measures have no
increased association with fatalities (Table 2, columns 5-8). However, the number of
fatalities increased substantially after lockdowns for all ACLED fatalities (columns 5),
and fatalities associated with violence against civilians (column 7). There is no evidence
of increased fatalities associated with food-related conflict. For this type of conflict, we
added any fatalities associated with food looting as well.
There is evidence that countries with a higher welfare and labour COVID-19
policy index experienced lower levels of overall ACLED’s fatalities as well as a lower
level of fatalities due to violence against civilians (Table 2, columns 5 and 7). Figure
10 shows these marginal effects. For instance, the number of total fatalities, decrease
by nearly ten casualties when comparing a country with no welfare and labour COVID19 policy response versus one that has an index of 0.4.
As mentioned earlier (Table 1) higher local prices are not associated with a
higher probability of experiencing food-related conflicts. However, Table 2, reveals
that increases in local prices are associated with a higher number of fatalities due to
food-related conflicts.

5.3 The state as an actor in riots, violence against civilians and food-related conflicts
To conclude our analysis, we focus on the conflicts in which the state has been directly
involved as an actor (either instigating or responding to contain violence) and
distinguish between riots, violence against civilians and food related conflicts. We
identify whether the state was involved as an actor whether in its capacity as the
military, the police, the government or government’s guards. We obtain this
information from the detailed notes revealed in ACLED’s database.
As before we present two specifications, panel random effects (RE) and panel
random effects with IV-2SLS. Table 3 presents both specifications, and Table A.7
shows the first-stage IV-2SLS specifications.

The Sargan-Hanssen overidentification tests show that the instruments satisfy
the overidentification restrictions. Also, the Hausman tests suggest the IV-2SLS
specifications should be preferred. According to these specifications, since the local
lockdowns, the instances where the state is involved in food-related conflicts has
increased (column 8). However, we find that in countries that have provided a higher
number of welfare and labour anti-poverty policies, the state is less likely to be involved
as an actor in food-related conflicts. In contrast, in these countries the state is more
likely to be involved as an actor in violence against civilians (column 7), but perhaps in
ensuring lockdowns and preventing unrests.

6. CONCLUSION
We analysed the impact of social distancing measures, food vulnerability, welfare and
labour COVID-19 policy response on conflict. Our IV-2SLS specifications revealed
that despite the restrictions on population mobility, riots, violence against civilians and
food-related increased after lockdowns. Food insecurity, in terms of volatility of local
prices, was found to be associated with a higher probability of a country experiencing
violence against civilians. Nonetheless, we also found that countries with a higher index
of welfare and labour COVID-19 policy response are less likely to have suffered these
conflicts and less likely to have experienced fatalities as a result of violence against
civilians and any other conflicts. We also found that since the lockdown states have
been more heavily involved as actors in food-related conflicts. However, states with
higher welfare and labour COVID-19 policy index also are less likely to have to
intervene in food-related conflicts directly.
The implications of our analysis are important from a public policy perspective.
Food vulnerability and price volatility are an explosive combination for conflicts as
they provide an opportunity for rebel groups to attack civilians, particularly in areas
with a high level of cultivation. Indeed, we found evidence that food vulnerability has
increased the probability of experiencing violence against civilians. This evidence is
well in line with the theoretical literature that suggests vulnerable citizens are more
likely to join riots and fall prey to organised armed groups (Rezaeedaryakenari et al.,
2020). However, our results also indicate that state’s actions in terms of delivering
urgent welfare assistance can reduce the probability of experiencing riots, violence
against civilians, food-related conflicts as well as their associated casualties. Although
the association found is weak, the findings are encouraging to suggest that urgent state
interventions can reduce food vulnerability and prevent major social unrest.
