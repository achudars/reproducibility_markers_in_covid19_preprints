Abstract—Coronavirus outbreak is one of the most challenging pandemics for the entire human population of the planet
Earth. Techniques such as the isolation of infected persons and
maintaining social distancing are the only preventive measures
against the epidemic COVID-19. The actual estimation of the
number of infected persons with limited data is an indeterminate
problem faced by data scientists. There are a large number
of techniques in the existing literature, including reproduction
number, the case fatality rate, etc., for predicting the duration
of an epidemic and infectious population. This paper presents
a case study of different techniques for analysing, modelling,
and representation of data associated with an epidemic such
as COVID-19. We further propose an algorithm for estimating
infection transmission states in a particular area. This work also
presents an algorithm for estimating end-time of an epidemic
from Susceptible Infectious and Recovered model. Finally, this
paper presents empirical and data analysis to study the impact
of transmission probability, rate of contact, infectious, and
susceptible on the epidemic spread.
Index Terms—Coronavirus, epidemic, infectious, isolation, susceptible.

deaths due to an epidemic spread. The case fatality rate
plays a vital role in estimating the actual damage due to
an epidemic. In other words, the number of people that
are infected (estimated through reproduction number) losses
their life during an epidemic. Further, there are four states
of infection spread in an epidemic, i.e., no contact, local,
untraceable, and source missing transmission. The first state
is the least harmful and often occur at the initial stage of the
spread, whereas, the last state is the critical transmission state
indicating the spread of infection is severe. In the literature for
assessment of epidemic spread, different models are discussed
like Susceptible Infectious Recovered (SIR) [7], Susceptible
Infectious (SI), and Susceptible Infectious and Susceptible
(SIS) model.

I. I NTRODUCTION
The disease is an abnormal condition that has stricken
human civilisation since their existence [1]. Every disease
is the medical condition that has some symptoms and signs
for their identification. These symptoms and signs provide
the suitability to identify the disease in the early stage.
However, some diseases do not have identifiable symptoms,
which makes them severe. Due to significant growth in medical
science, most of the existing diseases are cured or halted from
further damage to the human body. However, some diseases
spread due to some unknown virus or bacteria and lead to
the most deadly pandemic in humans. One of such pandemic
is novel coronavirus named COVID-19 that has potential for
maximal death [2], [3]. The controlling mechanism to hamper
the spread of an epidemic like COVID-19 requires an attentive
and strict application of quarantine and social distancing.
The effect of the epidemic (coronavirus) spread, quarantine,
and social distancing can be simulated using data analysis,
modelling, and representation techniques of data mining [4]–
[6]. These techniques help in predicting disease behaviour and
its corresponding preventive measure.
One of the most widely used techniques for predicting the
behaviour of an epidemic in term of infection spread during
an epidemic is the reproduction number (Ro ). It estimates
the spread of secondary infections from the primary infected
persons. Next, the case fatality rate captures the number of

The modern era of information encourages us to perform
data analysis for predicting the future course of actions against
disease and its behaviour [8]. The prediction is performed by
a model that takes the historical data to learn a pattern (like
the pattern of epidemic spread COVID-19). The performance
of these models depends heavily upon data representation and
storage. Therefore, in this paper, we have summarises different
techniques presented in the literature for the estimation of
various factors that are responsible for an epidemic (COVID19). We further discuss the methods that are predicting the end
time of an epidemic and the total population that is going to be
infected and susceptible. This is the first work as a case study
that covers data analysis, modelling and representation of the
coronavirus spread in India. Fig. 1 illustrate the steps involved
prior to the data analysis, modelling, and representation. After
collecting the epidemic data, the first and foremost task is
to perform data processing (like data cleaning, normalization,
etc). Further, analysis and modelling is performed on the
processed data. The papers answer the following question for

2

predicting the spread of infection and estimating the duration
of an epidemic.
• Question 1: What is the role of reproduction number
in the estimation of the population infected during an
epidemic such as COVID-19? How to determine the
average of the reproduction number for an epidemic
disease dataset? (Section II-B)
• Question 2: Is the reproduction number capable of
estimating the number of infected people in a particular
area during an epidemic? What is the impact of the case
fatality rate on estimating the damage due to an epidemic
like COVID-19? (Section II-C)
• Question 3: What are the infection transmission states
in an epidemic? How to identify the transmission state
in a particular area? Is there any existing algorithm for
transmission state identification? (Section II-D)
• Question 4: How to model an epidemic for accurate
estimation of infection spread and recovery rate? Which
model is suitable for end-time estimation of an epidemic?
What is the Susceptible Infectious Recovered model?
How Susceptible Infectious Recovered (SIR), Susceptible
Infectious (SI), and Susceptible Infectious and Susceptible (SIS) models estimate the impact of an epidemic?
(Section III)
The rest of the paper is organised as follows. Next section
illustrates Covid-19 open access dataset, the parameters used
for measuring the impact of an epidemic, and the method to
identify the state of the epidemic. Section III illustrates the
mathematical models of the epidemic. Section IV illustrates
the empirical results and paper is concluded in Section V.
II. DATASET AND PARAMETERS FOR MEASURING THE
SPREAD OF AN EPIDEMIC DISEASE

In this section, we first illustrate an open access dataset of
Covid-19 that we use in the rest of the paper. We next define
the parameters used for measuring the impact of epidemic, as
shown in Fig. 2.

state patient number is a combination of state code, detected
district code and its patient count. For example, the infected
patient 1 is from Thrissur district (district code: TS) of Kerala
(state code: KL). Therefore, state patient number is KL-TS-P1
for patient 1. The column current status indicates the current
state of the patient, i.e., recovered, hospitalized, or deceased.
The column with header notes holds the details about travelling
history of the patient. Next, the local transmission from one
patient to another is recorded in column contacted from which
patient. Further, nationality followed by transmission type that
depicts whether the transmission of infection is imported from
other countries or local. Finally, the column status change date
illustrates the status change of infected patient to recovered or
deceased from infected.
B. Epidemic first parameter: Reproduction number
The epidemic disease modelling incorporates the reproduction number, denoted by Ro , to understand the disease
outbreak by wrapping up all the infection transmission in a
specified area. The reproduction number specifies the number
of persons being infected by an infectious person (a person
suffering from the disease) [10]. It defines as
Definition 1. Reproduction number of a given region is the
ratio of the total number of persons infected to the total
number of persons who are infecting, i.e.,
Ro =

Total persons infected
.
Total who are infecting

(1)

Fig. 3 illustrates an example scenario where from left to
right there is an increment in the value of Ro . The number
of persons infected by an infectious person also increase in a
similar pattern. The value of Ro less then unity indicates that
the epidemic elimination and greater than unity leading to an
epidemic outbreak.

A. Dataset of Covid-19
This work uses COVID-19 dataset available at [9] for
predicting and analyzing the outbreak of epidemic in India.
The dataset illustrates the detail description of the patients
infected from coronavirus. Table I depicts the first 10 entries of
the dataset having different columns including, patient number,
state patient number, date announcement, age bracket, gender,
detected city, detected district, detected state, state code,
current status, notes, contacted from which patient, nationality,
transmission type, and status change date. The column header
patient number indicates the actual patient count in India, and

Ro = 1

Ro = 2

• Importance of Ro : Ro is an essential metric that indicates
how contiguous the disease is?. A disease is said to be highly
contiguous when an infected individual transmits the infection
to an unexpectedly large number of people. The mechanism
of providing a proper treatment or appropriate handling of
any disease requires full information about how the infection
develops in the body, the mode of transmission, and the social
structure where it can spread. If all this information is available, then the outbreak can be detected and monitored quickly

• Importance of Cr : The reproduction number can only give
the idea of the rate of disease spread, but cannot estimate
how many persons can lose their life in the entire cycle of
the spread. Therefore, the case fatality rate is crucial for such
estimation. An epidemic like measles with Ro around 18 has
a lower case fatality rate to that of Ebola with Ro around
1.5 [12]. Thus, the case fatality rate plays a vital role in
estimating the actual effect of a disease on humanity. For
example, Ebola with lesser Ro is more severe than the measles.
• Cr in given dataset: Fig. 5 illustrates the value of Cr for the
given day. It also shows the minimum and maximum Cr on
the states of India each day. We conclude from the result that
the difference between the minimum and maximum value of
Cr is very high, which indicates that an epidemic is very high
in some state while others are free. The result also illustrates
the minimum value of Cr increases with time. It indicates
the epidemic is spreading in India at a slower rate. Table III
illustrates the case fatality rate of different states of India from
COVID-19. The fatality rate of Himanchal Pradesh is highest,
i.e., 1.79. High fatality rate indicates that a large number of
infected persons die in these states. However, the fatality rate
also increases if the number of infected patients is low. It
seems right in the case of Himanchal Pradesh too, as the
reported cases in the state are only 39 out of which one is
deceased. The fatality rate of few states is zero as there is no
casualty reported so far in them like Andaman and Nicobar,
Assam, Chandigarh, etc. The overall fatality rate of India
reported up till April, 18 2020 is 0.34, which indicates person
infection rate is low in India and they are gaining significant
recovery from the COVID-19.

Reproduction number (Ro )

and allows us to react accordingly. The reproduction number
Ro captures all these necessary information by incorporating
three components: population density, rate of infection, and
rate of recovery or death [11].
• Ro in given dataset: Fig. 4 illustrates the value of Ro for the
given day. It also shows the minimum and maximum Ro in the
states of India on each day. We conclude from the result that
the difference between the minimum and maximum value of
Ro is very high, which indicates that the epidemic is very high
in some state while others are free. The result also illustrates
that minimum value of Ro increase with time which indicates
that the epidemic has spread in India. Table II illustrates the
value of Ro for the spread of COVID-19 in different states of
India from the dataset available at [9] up till April, 18 2020.
The table shows that few states like Haryana and Punjab have
person to person spread of coronavirus reaches to 20. The
average Ro value of some state is less than 1, which is a
good indication of the lower spread of COVID-19 in India
and sub-continents. However, some states show a value of Ro
more than 3 that requires a significant effort in the spread
control methodology in the country. The overall Ro for India
is 1.79 that indicates the COVID-19 is in its initial stage in
the country.

chains of transmission from one person to another. These
preventive measures reduce the contamination from the persons or surfaces while encouraging connections with family
members. The spread of the infection is broadly categorised
in the following four infection transmission states [13]:
1) State 1 (No contact transmission): In this transmission state, the infection from an infected person does
not proceed further to any other person. The infected
person remains confined with the disease-causing virus
without further dissipation. For an epidemic disease
like COVID-19, this state is the most crucial state to
control the spread of coronavirus through quarantine and
social isolation. However, several infected persons in
this state are unaware of their infection. Thus, passing
the infection to the person in the contact and accelerate
the growth of the disease. For example, the topmost
layer in Fig. 6 demonstrates two persons (i.e., A and
B) are infected with coronavirus and there is no any
further transmission. This may result due to the complete
isolation of both A and B.
2) State 2 (Local transmission): The isolation compromise and delay in the detection of infection in a person
leads this transmission state. The infected person transfers the infection to the person in its close contact. This
type of transmission is usually observed in the case when
the infected person comes in close contact with a person
like a friend or a family member. At this stage, it is easy
to trace spread and quarantine people. The quarantine
of the infected person must be strictly followed to avoid
this state to enter into the next state. The second layer in
Fig. 6 indicates the transmission is from infected person
A to C and B to D.
3) State 3 (Untraceable transmission): The unaltered social contact between the persons results in transmission
state third. In this state, the concept of transmitting and
being transmitted is followed. Here, an infected person
transfers the infection to another person who in turn
transfers to the third person. The third stage is also when
the source of the infection is untraceable. The infected
people in this stage are identified who havent had travel
history. This state, in case of COVID-19, is controlled

by adopting a hard mechanism like lockdowns over the
entire country. The third stage in Fig. 6 illustrates State
3. In this state, A transfers infection to C that further
propagates to E. Similar transmission is observed among
B, D, and F.
4) State 4 (Source missing transmission): This is the final
infection transmission state where the source of infection
is unidentified. It can be understood by an example
where a person is infected in spite of not coming in
close contact with an infected person and had no travel
history from an infected country. This transmission state
is most severe and leads to infection spread to all the
persons in a particular area where the infection persists.
The last layer in Fig. 6 illustrates the fourth state of
transmission, where, the source is unidentified.

Fig. 6: An example scenario representing four transmission state of
an epidemic.

• Algorithm for identify state of epidemic: Algorithm 1
illustrates the steps involved in the identification of the infected
population in the different transmission state. In the algorithm, we introduce a variable inf ection tramission that
predicts the chance of a person to lie in a particular transmission state depending upon its values (i.e., 0, 1, and more).
inf ectiontransmission = 0 indicates that there is no personto-person infection transmission and inf ectiontransmission =
1 indicate that infection transmission is in State 2. Further, if
the infection is transmitted from the first person to second
person and then to the third or the source is untraceable indicates the transmission State 3. If the transmission state does
not belong to the above three, then the infection transmission
State 4 is reached. At State 4, it is assumed that the entire
population is equally likely to be infected. The estimation
of infection transmission State 4 is out of scope from this
algorithm. To hamper the infection transmission, the measures
for the peoples includes the closure of non-essential services,
work from home, avoid social gathering, isolating vulnerable
groups, etc. These measures are successful if peoples follow
conjunctive measures such as hand washing frequently.
• State in given dataset: Fig 7 illustrates the number of
persons each state with time. As we expect, the number of
cases are registered more with time. An interesting observation
from this result is that the number of persons in state 2
increases sharply then state 1. This is because of the state

indulge in all four transmission states. Due to a large number

data available at [9] (April 18 2020). An important conclusion
from the table is that India is in Stage 2 (90.11%) and shifting

III. E PIDEMIC M ODELS AND C ONTACT TRACKING
Data models help in quantifying the damage caused by
a disease like epidemic COVID-19. The model simulates
the spread of infection from one person to another and its
geographical spread on the entire population. The models also
help in identifying the time after which the epidemic end or
its effect can be reduced. Data models predict the number of
population that is infectious, susceptible and recovered in the
near future. In this section, we discuss the exiting epidemic
models and how to use on the dataset.
A. Susceptible, Infectious, and Recovered (SIR) model
The most generalised framework for such simulation
is based on Susceptible, Infectious, and Recovered (SIR)
model [14]. The SIR model is a three-phase model where
a person partially stays in a phase and switches to another

Fig. 8: Illustration of susceptible, infectious, and recovered persons
of a particular area.

Susceptible: All the person in a particular area who are not infected with the disease and have no reported immunity against
the infection are categorised as Susceptible (S). The absence
of immunity in a person is the result of no prior exposure to
the infection, non-vaccinated against such infection, and no
confirm disease resistance. The susceptible person moves to
the infectious phase by social contact with an infected person.
Infectious: During the disease outbreak like COVID-19, some
person come in close contact with the infected person and
got infected afterwards, forming a group of persons termed
as Infectious (I). These persons are solely responsible for the
spread of the disease in the whole community. The quarantine

7

of such infected persons preserves the community from being
infectious. Social isolation from such a person is the only
remedy against any epidemic outbreak like COVID-19.
Recovered: Every disease like epidemic COVID-19 has a
specific cycle for infection persistence. After this cycle, the
infected person recovers from the infection with proper treatment. However, due to the severe spread of infection in the
human body and inadequate cure, the infection can result in
death. The summation of total recovered and total dead is
termed as Recovered (R) or sometimes removed. The persons
that are in this category are free from further infection.
There is always a phase of transmission among the persons,
i.e., from susceptible to infectious and infectious to susceptible. The transmission of the disease changes the number
of persons in a phase over time. The SIR model can be
represented using [7] as follows
R =α2 I − γI,
I =α1 S,
M =S ∪ I ∪ R,

(3)
(4)
(5)

where, α1 and α2 are the force of infection and recovery
rate, respectively. γ denotes the death rate and ∪ is the union
operator. Eq. 5 holds when the entire population of a specified
area is susceptible to the epidemic outbreak.
Force of infection α1 is the rate at which the susceptible
person becomes infectious on the close contact with the
infected person. Recovery rate α2 is the rate at which an
infected person recovers from the infection using the proper
treatment. The force of infection is not a constant quantity and
is proportional to the transmission rate τ . The transmission rate
τ is the product of the rate of contact rc and the probability
of transmission pt from susceptible to infectious phase. τ is
defined as
τ = rc × pt .
(6)
Using Eq. 6 we can define force of infection α1 as
n I o
× 100,
α1 (I) = τ
M

(7)

I
where, { M
}×100, represents percentage of population, which
is infectious among the total population in a particular area.
To capture the population change in a particular phase, SIR
model adopts differential equations. A differential equation
captures the progression of the disease. The rate of change in
the susceptible population (S), infectious population (I), and
recovered population (R) as defined as follows

dS
= −α1 (I)S.
(8)
dt
dI
= α1 (I)S − α2 I.
(9)
dt
dR
= α2 I.
(10)
dt
An essential step after estimating the rate of change in S,
I, and R using the differential equation, is to determine the
equilibrium state of the SIR model. To describe the epidemic
methodology, two equilibria exist side-by-side, i.e., Disease
Free Equilibrium and Endemic Equilibrium [15]. The Disease

Free Equilibrium comes into the picture when there is no
person left with the infection in a particular area. However,
in the case of Endemic Equilibrium there always persists an
infectious individual. It requires a constant supply of susceptible person to maintain the equilibrium. Both the equilibrium
persists when the value of Ro is less than 1. The SIR model
reaches an equilibrium state if the rate of transmission form
susceptible to infectious is equal to infectious to recover.
Algorithm 2 illustrates the process of estimating the time t
for which an epidemic persists using Susceptible, Infectious,
and Recovered model.

• SIR model on the given dataset: Fig 9 illustrates the
relationship between susceptible, infectious, and recovered
cases in India up till April 18 2020. The figure demonstrates
that infectious persons grow up to a limiting value, where
recovery starts at a higher pace. It compels most of the people
to come out of the susceptible, and the outbreak is about to
die. During the construction of the result, we have taken the
value of reproduction number Ro = 1.79, i.e., current status
for India with a total 12, 079 active cases. We can observe that
if the rate of new case generation in India is decreasing or not
exceeding the current rate, then the COVID-19 breakout will
be ended in the next 70 days.

B. Susceptible Infectious (SI) model
Chermack and McKinsey [16] proposed the Susceptible
Infectious (SI) model. The authors assumed that the total
population in a particular area during epidemic breakout
belongs either to susceptible or infectious. Apart from the SIR
model, they only consider the susceptible and infectious population without considering the recovered cases in a particular
location. Let at time t = 0 (time at which the estimation
begins), the number of infectious and susceptible peoples are
represented as Io and So , respectively. Let τ represents the
transmission rate given in Eq. 6. Then, the rate of change in
susceptible and infectious is given as
dS
= −τ SI.
(11)
dt
dI
= τ I(1 − I).
(12)
dt
Upon further calculation as given in [16], the number of
infectious during an epidemic breakdown can be obtained as
follows
Io eτ t
I=
.
(13)
1 − Io + Io eτ t
• SI model on the given dataset: Fig. 10 illustrates the
fraction of the infectious population for past 30 days of the epidemic (COVID-19) breakout in India. The result shows that the
curved we obtained is an S-shaped curve for infectious. The
curve grows exponentially from the early stage of infection
in the country the infection starts spreading. During the result
estimation, we have taken the value of reproduction number
Ro = 1.79, i.e., current status for India with a total 12, 079
active cases as on April 18 2020. We can observe that if the
rate of new case generation in India is increasing, which in turn
increases the infectious population in the country. This result
seems to be an alarming situation for taking more preventive
measures to hamper the growing cases in the country.

where, τ and α represents the transmission rate and fraction
of the infected population, respectively. The term τ SI can be
understood as an average infection transmitted by an individual
through sufficient contacts for transmitting the infection to
τ M susceptible population, for M as the population size of a
particular area. The probability that a given person can infect
other is S/M in this case. Therefore, the infection transmission
per unit time is τ S by a single individual. The rate of change
in Infectious population is as follows
dI
= τ SI − αI.
(15)
dt
Using the assumption that the epidemic could infect the
entire population such that M = S + I. Therefore, we can
obtain
dI
=τ I(M − I) − αI,
dt
=(τ M − α)I − τ I 2 .
(16)
Solving for dI
dt = 0, we can obtain two possible equilibria, i.e,
at I = 0 and I = M − ατ . When we achieve the equilibrium
then the epidemic is about to end.
• SIS model on the given dataset: The result illustrated in
Fig 11 depicts the relationship between susceptible and the
infectious fraction of cases in India up till April 18 2020. The
result is estimated by taking the value of the reproduction
number as Ro = 1.79, i.e., current status for India with a
total 12, 079 active cases up to April 18 2020. Similarly, to
previous observations in the SIR model in Fig. 9, here also, we
can observe that if the rate of new case generation in India is
decreasing or not exceeding the current rate, then the COVID19 breakout will be ended in the next 70 days.

C. Susceptible Infectious and Susceptible (SIS) model
Susceptible Infectious and Susceptible (SIS) model is an
extension of the SI model [17]. The authors assumed that the
people who recovered from the infection are still susceptible.
It means the those who recovered from infection during an
epidemic has not developed immunity against it. The rate of
change in susceptible is given as
dS
= −τ SI + αI,

IV. R ESULTS USING EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS
This work carried experiment using empirical analysis of
population size 1000 persons. We consider the value of the
reproduction number (Ro ) as 1.79. This value is taken as the
average reproduction number for COVID-19 in India is 1.79.
The empirical analysis in this paper is based on the following
formula derived from SIR model [18].
 I 
Itotal = Io + rc
× 100 × S × pt ,
(17)
M
where, Io is the initial infected population, rc is the rate of
contact, and pt is the transmission probability.

1) Impact of Infectious and Susceptible: This work estimates the infectious population when the susceptible increase
from 25% to 100%, with the rate of contact rc = 1 and
the probability of transmission pt = 0.3. Part (a) of Fig. 12
illustrates that the number of infected persons increases with
the increase in the % susceptible. If the susceptible reaches to
100% on population size 1000, then the infection can spread
up to 487 persons. Similarly, part (b) of Fig. 12 illustrates that
the increment in the infectious accelerates the increment in the
susceptible population and reaches 564 when population size
is 1000 and infectious is 40%. These results illustrate that
infectious and susceptible are directly related to each other
and increases in a similar manner. Therefore, the effect of an
epidemic such as COVID-19 can be reduced by decreasing
either the susceptible or infectious population.

2) Impact of rate of contact and probability of transmission:
The rate of contact and the probability of transmission play a
vital role in determining the infection spread of an epidemic
like COVID-19 in a particular area. Therefore, this paper
calculates the number of infected and susceptible at a varying
rate of contact and probability of transmission separately.
Firstly, we put the probability of transmission as a constant
(pt = 0.3) and the rate of contact as a variable. Part (a) of
Fig. 13 illustrates that the increment in the infectious is nearly
linear with the rate of contact and population size. At higher
population size beyond 800, the curve starts flattening as the
infection has covered roughly half of the population. Similarly,
a linear increment is observed for susceptible to the increase
in the rate of contact.
Further, parts (c) and (d) of Fig. 13 show that the transmission probability is highly sensitive in determining the rate
of infection spread and increment in the susceptible. We
have considered the rate of contact (rc = 1) for calculating
the value of infectious and susceptible. Part (c) of Fig. 13
demonstrates that the infectious count is directly proportional
to the transmission probability and shows an exact linear
increment with the increase in the population size. In a similar
pattern, part (d) of Fig. 13 illustrates that the number of
susceptible increases with the increase in the transmission
probability as the chance to get infected is higher when the
population increases.
3) Impact of case fatality rate and recovery rate: Next, we
evaluate the impact of the case fatality rate and recovery rate
on the rate of change in infectious and susceptible. The case
fatality rate and recovery rate forms following four cases

1) Both case fatality rate and recovery rate increase:
When both case fatality rate and recovery rate increase,
then the rate of infectious and susceptible people are
increased simultaneously. The susceptible population
changes more rapidly to that of infectious. The increment in both infectious and susceptible continues up
till a thresholding limit, where the influence of the case
fatality rate start degrading to that of recovery rate. Part
(a) of Fig. 14 shows the variation in infectious and
susceptible when both case fatality and recovery rates
increases.
2) Case fatality rate increase and recovery rate decrease: It is the most adverse situation for an epidemic
breakout, where the case fatality is increasing, and
recovery is decreasing. This clearly indicates that the
epidemic is in the worst phase, and it can infect the
entire population in a particular area. Part (b) of Fig. 14
illustrates the adverse situation where both infectious
and susceptible are increasing.
3) Both case fatality rate and recovery rate decrease:
This is similar to that of the previously discussed case,
but one positive thing that mitigates form severe damage
is the decrement in the case fatality rate. Part (c) of
Fig 14 indicates that the simultaneous decrement in
both case fatality rate and recovery rate increases the
infectious and susceptible.
4) Case fatality rate decreases and recovery rate increases: The last combination for case fatality and
recovery rate is the case when the case fatality rate
decreases and recovery rate increases. It is the most
favourable situation where there is a clear indication that
the epidemic is reducing. Part (d) of Fig. 14 illustrates
that both infectious and susceptibles decrease under such
circumstances.
V. C ONCLUSION
The pandemic COVID-19 is spreading at a higher pace
around the globe. The empirical and data analysis in this paper
tries to figure out the impact of various parameters such as the
probability of transmission, rate of contacts, infectious and
susceptible. The results indicate that the spread of COVID19 can be analysed, modelled, and represented in the tabular
and graphical format. The data analysis provides the complete
in-site of the coronavirus spread and also highlights the
reproduction number of COVID-19 is between 1.5 to 4, and
its fatality rate is low. The paper covers those models that are
widely in the various estimations in an epidemic and identifies
the advantage and disadvantage of one model over others. The
representation provides a more natural way to visualise the
actual effect of the epidemic spread.
