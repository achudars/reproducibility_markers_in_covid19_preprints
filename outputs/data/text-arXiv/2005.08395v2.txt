Abstract
In this paper, we deal with the study of the impact of nationwide measures COVID-19
anti-pandemic. We drive two processes to analyze COVID-19 data considering measures.
We associate level of nationwide measure with value of parameters related to the contact
rate of the model. Then a parametric solve, with respect to those parameters of measures,
shows different possibilities of the evolution of the pandemic. Two machine learning tools
are used to forecast the evolution of the pandemic. Finally, we show comparison between
deterministic and two machine learning tools.

I NTRODUCTION

The COVID-19 pandemic is testing the entire world so that measures are being taken
in most nations to stem its development. These measures can generally be of different
kinds such as social distancing, partial or total confinement, etc. It would therefore
be interesting to be able to effectively analyze the effects of the measures taken on the
spread of the pandemic. Here we offer an analysis of the impact of the measures taken
that we apply to the case of Senegal. In previous papers [3], [11] and [12] we proposed a
start of study using the results of [9].
In [9], a useful method for the study of the evolution of COVID-19 pandemic has been
resented by using a compartmental model with Susceptible, Infected asymptomatic, Infected reported symptomatic and unreported symptomatic (SIRU). In [3], the author use
that method to study the COVID-19 spread in Senegal with a classical SIR model.

ANALYSIS

In this work we aim to analyze the impact of the anti pandemic measures taken in Senegal. It is a continuation of the work done in [3]. We do a two-step analysis. The first uses
the differential equations model denoted SIRU introduced in [9], and the second uses two
machine learning tools: Predict of Wolfram Mathematica using Neural Networks method
and Prophet.
We conduct the work in the following way. In the section 2 we study the effect of the
nationwide measures by using an epidemic model presented in [9] and we present some
machine learning tools. We show, in the section 3, the numerical results. In the section 4, we discuss the results. Then in section 5, we perform an analysis of the model
and explain the parameters estimation. Finally in the section 6, we end by making a
conclusion and advancing perspectives.

A NALYSIS

Analysis of the measures

In [3] a classical SIR model was studied using results from the paper [9]. The aim was to
analyze the effect of the nationwide measures using the data after nationwide measures.
In fact, throughout t0 to T , we fitted an exponential function to the data of the total
cases of infection of this period. T represents the date of the nationwide measures, and
t0 is the starting time of the epidemic. We consider that the effects of the measures
are such that they lead to a reduction in the contact rate. To describe this reduction,
we chose a slowly decreasing function over time. We consider that the measures taken
are not strong enough to systematically drop the contact rate to 0. This new function
corresponds to the first one and the data in the period before measures from t0 to T ,
then takes a slower trajectory than that of the first function after T . In other words, from
the date T , the new curve goes under the old one. We consider that if on the dates t > T
the data goes under the new curve obtained with a contact rate after measures then, we
can say that these measures affect the evolution of the pandemic.
In the previous paper [3], the function we fitted to the data from 2020 March 02 to March
31 by least square method, is T N I(t) = b exp(ct) − a with a = 13.9324, b = 9.61779 and
c = 0.100095 (figure 1a). In this paper we fit a new exponential function to the data from
2020 March 02 to April 25 (figure 1b). For this new function, we have a = 99.9214, b =
81.325, c = 0.0371767.

Let’s present the parameters. β is the contact rate. 1/ν is the average time during which
asymptomatic infectious are asymptomatic. γ is the fraction of asymptomatic infectious individuals that become reported symptomatic infectious. 1/η is the average time
symptomatic infectious have symptoms. γν is the rate at which asymptomatic infectious
become reported symptomatic. (1 − γ)ν is the rate at which asymptomatic infectious
become symptomatic but unreported. α is the proportion of recovered and 1 − α is the
proportion of death due to the infection.
We make the assumption that the function we fit the total number of reported infected
Z t
cases is given by γν
I(s)ds.
t0

The starting time of the pandemic, the initial conditions and some parameters of the
model are estimated and others are fixed. The parameters set are γ, 1/ν and 1/η. The values chosen for 1/ν and 1/η are those used by the medical authorities i.e. 1/7. Regarding
the proportion of unreported and reported, we also use the same value proposed in [9], ie
80% are reported and 20% are unreported. Further detailed studies could make it possible
to estimate the good value of this proportion for Senegal where we apply the model. For
the estimation of the parameters, the starting time and the initial conditions, we use the
calculation methods detailed in [9] and [3]. We start with the fitting exponential function
Z t
which we equalize with the integral formula above T N I(t) = b exp(ct) − a = γν

We consider that after the measures taken at the time T , the contact rate depends on
time following a formula we choose. We use two formulas. One of them was introduced
in [3], and the second one was proposed in [10]. The first one is :
(
β

β̃(t) =

where δ and p are parameters to choose. The second one is:

β̃(t) =

where ϕ is a parameter to choose.

evaluate the measures. We do parametric solve with respect to parameters δ and p.
Results are shown in figure 5.
Now we consider at time T2 , the nation applies stronger measures. We simply interpret
as the contact rate β̃ is reduced by a factor φ ∈ [0, 1]. When the value of φ is equal to
0, it means that there are no measures, while when φ is equal to 1, it means that the
strongest measures are taken. Hence the measures are quantified with the values of
proportion φ. Then the contact rate become:

ANALYSIS

We solve the new model with β̃ replaced by β̃2 . We do a parametric solve with respect to
the parameter φ, and we plot the result for different values of φ. Then, we show different
values of the peak, depending on the values of φ. Then, we can evaluate the maximal
value of infection peak with respect to the level of the measures. Results are shown in
figures 6, 7, 8 and 9.

Artificial Neural Networks

Artificial neural networks are part of artificial intelligence. Biological neural networks
inspire them. Biological neural networks are part of the animal brain. One of the main
functions of the brain is to process information, and the primary information processing
element is the neuron. This specialized brain cell combines (usually) several inputs to
generate a single output. Depending on the animal, an entire brain can contain anywhere from a handful of neurons to more than a hundred billion, wired together. The
output of one cell feeding the input of another, to create a neural network capable of
remarkable feats of calculation and decision making (See [13]). If we could qualify the
brain as a computer, then we would say that it is the best of computers. For this reason,
the engineer seeks to improve mechanical computers to be closer to the biological computer, i.e., the brain. The more neural connections there are, the more the network can
solve complex problems. Pattern recognition is a task that neural networks can easily
accomplish. For this task, introducing as input a pattern to a neural network, yields as
output a pattern back (See [5]).
In general, neural network problems involve a dataset used to predict values for later
datasets. For that, the neural network needs to be trained. Then, neural networks can
predict the outcome of entirely new datasets based on training from old data sets.
Most neural network structures use some type of neuron, node, or unit. An algorithm
called a neural network will generally be made up of individual interconnected neurons,
see figure 3.
The artificial neuron receives input from one or more sources, which may be other neurons or data entered into the network from a computer program see figure 4. This entry
is usually a floating-point or binary. Often the binary input is coded floating point representing true or false like 1 or 0. Sometimes the program also describes the binary input
as using a bipolar system with true as 1 and false as −1. An artificial neuron multiplies
each of these inputs by a weight. It then adds these multiplications and transmits this
sum to an activation function given by:
n
X
f (xi , wi ) = φ( (wi · xi )),

(7)

i=1

with the variables x and w represent the input and the weights of the neuron, n is the
number of input and weight.
Some neural networks do not use an activation function. To read more about Neural
Networks one can see [1], [5], [4] and [13].
Neural networks are implemented in machine learning tools of many software like Wolfram Mathematica[18]. We use the machine learning tool “Predict” to forecast the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic in Senegal. We can choose different method of regression
algorithm: “RandomForest”, “LinearRegression”, “NeuralNetwork”, “GaussianProcess”,
“NearestNeighbors”, etc.

Forecasting using Prophet

ANALYSIS

We use the “NeuralNetwork” regression algorithm, which predicts using artificial neural
networks.
We consider two cases in the forecasting. The first case, only use the total number of
infected case data in the training of the neural networks. While in the other forecasting,
we use two types of data: the total number of infected cases and the contact rate. In the
second case, the aim is to do forecasting by considering the effect of the contact rate. It
is a way to show the effect of the nationwide measures taken at the time T , as specified
in section 2. For the contact rate we use as data β̃ given by (3).

Forecasting using Prophet

In this section, we develop another machine learning tool for forecasting to compare with
the previous SIRU models and Neural Networks method.

7

3

NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS

We use Prophet [15], a procedure for forecasting time series data based on an additive
model where non-linear trends are fit with yearly, weekly, and daily seasonality, plus
holiday effects.
For the average method, the forecasts of all future values are equal to the average (or
âĂIJmeanâĂİ) of the historical data. If we let the historical data be denoted by y1 , ..., yT ,
then we can write the forecasts as
ŷT +h|T = ȳ = (y1 + y2 + ... + yT )/T
The notation ŷT +h|T is a short-hand for the estimate of yT +h based on the data y1 , ..., yT .
A prediction interval gives an interval within which we expect yt to lie with a specified
probability. For example, assuming that the forecast errors are normally distributed, a
95% prediction interval for the h-step forecast is
ŷT +h|T ± 1.96σˆh
where σh is an estimate of the standard deviation of the h-step forecast distribution.
For the data preparation, when we are forecasting at the country level, for small values,
forecasts can become negative. To counter this, we round negative values to zero. Also,
no tweaking of seasonality-related parameters and additional regressors are performed.

N UMERICAL S IMULATIONS

Numerical analysis

The data for Senegal, we use, is obtained from daily press releases on the COVID-19
from the Ministry of Health and Social Action (http://www.sante.gouv.sn/).
The figures 6, 7, 8 and 9 show results related to 2.1. The figures 6, 7 correspond to β̃ 3
and the figures 8, 9 correspond to β̃ 4.
We use γ = 0.8, ν = 1/7, η = 1/7, the total population of Senegal is N = 16743927 from
Senegal Population (2020) - Worldometer (www.worldometers.info). Then we obtain: t0 =
5.53923, I0 = 32.504, IU 0 = 5.1584, IR0 = 27.3456, S0 = N − I0 = 1.67439 × 107 , R0 = 1.30516,
β = 9.27954 × 10−9 .
The time of the nationwide measures in Senegal taken at 2020, March 23 is considered.
Then T = 23. For β̃ given by (3), results are shown by figures 6a and 6b. For β̃ given by
(4), results are shown by figures 8a and 8b. We see that the maximal number of reported
case goes up to 340000 with the time peak at t = 310, which correspond to 2021, January
05.
A parametric plot of a parametric resolution of the SIRU model (5), using β̃ given by (3),
with respect to δ and p, is shown in figures 5.
Now, we consider that stronger measures is taken as explained in the subsection 2.1.
The results is shown in figures 6c, 8c, 6d, 8d, 6e, 8e, 6f, 8f and 7.
Particularly figure 6c and figures 8c shows results of parametric solve of the SIRU model
(5) with the parameters φ = 0. Hence, we see that the time of the peak becomes T2 , the
date where stronger measures are taken. We choose as sample T2 = 70 which correspond
to 2020, May 10.
The figures 6d, 8d, 6e, 8e, 6f, 8f show parametric plot of the infected I(t), the reported
˜ I(t), with varying values of
IR (t) and unreported IU (t) and total number of infected T N

D ISCUSSION

Analysis of the new trend in the data from March 2 to April 24, 2020 shows a change
in the trajectory of the total number of cases. That causes a reduction of the maximum
value of the peak compared to what it would have been without the measures taken on
March 23, 2020. See figures 6a, 6b, 8b, 8a.
By considering new nationwide measures of Senegal, which we have chosen in this study

18

5

MATERIALS AND METHODS

to fix on the date of May 10, 2020, we note that the maximum value of the peak decreases
according to the force of the measures taken. Likewise, the time of the peak is postponed
as shown by the parametric plots in figures 6, 7, 8 and 9.
Since the first measures on March 23, 2020, Senegal has laughed at additional measures
such as the closing of markets, shops, stores and other public places, with an opening
calendar. We have therefore chosen May 10, 2020 as a date from which the additional
measures can begin to take effect in reducing contamination.
We see that depending on the strength of these measures, the evolution of the disease
can lose its exponential nature or become slower.
The prediction with neural networks and Prophet show an optimistic situation. The
forecasting based only on data and those on contact rates show a slow evolution as
shown in figures 11 and 12. We see that the curve obtained using the contact rate
function in training of the neural networks, goes below that obtained only using the data
on the total number of cases.

M ATERIALS

AND METHODS

Basic proprieties

Let’s set E = {(S, I, IR , IU ) ∈ R4+ : S + I + IR + IU ≤ N }, N is the initial population.
Replacing an initial solution (S, I, IR , IU ) ∈ E in the system (1), we obtain:

Ṡ ≤ 0


 ˙
I ≥ −νI(t)
˙ ≥ −ηIR (t)

I

 ˙R
IU ≥ −ηIU (t)

(8)

Solving these differential inequalities gives I(t) ≥ K exp(−νt), IR (t) ≥ K exp(−ηt) and
IU ≥ K exp(−ηt). Hence I, IR , IU ≥ 0.
By considering an initial solution with S = 0, we get Ṡ = 0. Then S(t) ≥ 0.
Now, summing the equations of the system (1), we obtain Ṡ + I˙ + I˙R + I˙U ≤ −η(IR +IU ) ≤ 0.
Then S + I + IR + IU ≤ S0 + I0 + IR0 + IU 0 ≤ N . Finally (S, I, IR , IU ) remain in the set E. This
implies that E is a positively-invariant set under the flow described by (1). In addition,
the model can be considered as being epidemiologically and mathematically well-posed.
Let’s set






S
−βS(t)(I(t) + IU (t))
S0
 I 
 βS(t)(I(t) + IU (t)) − νI(t) 

 IR  , f (X(t)) =  γνI(t) − ηIR (t)

 IR0 
IU
(1 − γ)νI(t) − ηIU (t)
IU 0
Then the system (1) with initial condition can be rewritten in the following form:

Ẋ = f (X(t))
X(t0 ) = X0

(10)

Theorem 5.1. The system (10) has a unique solution X(t) for t ≥ t0 .
Remark 5.1. The proof of the above theorem come from the Cauchy-Lipschitz theorem and
the Fundamental Existence-Uniqueness theorem in [14], since f ∈ C 1 (E).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Let’s set the function g : R+ × R → R such that g(β, X) = f (X).
g : R+ × R → R

(β, X) 7→ f (X)

(

g(β, X)

t

Then the system (5) can be written in the following form:

Ẋ = f˜(X(t))
X(t0 ) = X0

(11)

Theorem 5.2. For any fixed parameters δ and p for β̃ (3) or ϕ for β̃ (4), the system (11)
with β̃ (3) or β̃ (4), has a unique solution X(t) for t ≥ t0 .
Proof of Theorem 5.2. The proof of the existence uniqueness of the system (11) with β̃ (3)
and β̃ (4) are similar. Then, we do this for one.
The function f˜ is piece-wise continuously differentiable in R+ × E. Then by using the
theorem
5.1, we have the existence of a unique solution X1 (t) on [t0 , T ] of the system

Ẋ = g(β, X(t))
and for the parameters δ and p fixed, there is a unique solution X2 (t)
X(t0 ) = X0
(
T
Ẋ = g(β( )δ/p , X(t))
.
for t ≥ T of the system
t
X(T ) = X1 (T )

X1 (t) if t ∈ [t0 , T ]
Now defining the function X(t) =
, we deduce that X(t) is a unique
X2 (t) if t > T
solution continuous in time of the system (11).
Remark 5.2. We can do the same work for the system (5) with β̃ replaced by β̃2 (6). Then
for any fixed parameters δ, p and φ, the system has a unique solution X(t) for t ≥ t0 .

5.2.

Disease Free Equilibrium

The unique equilibrium of the model (1) is the canonical DFE given by (S0 , 0, 0, 0).

5.3.

Parameters estimation

The estimation of the parameters of the model (1) is done by using techniques in [9],
[3]. We fit the cumulative data with an exponential function T N I(t) = b exp(ct) − a.
In addition, we assume that the cumulative function can be given in integral form as
Z t
T N I(t) = γν
I(s)ds.
t0

Then T N I(t0 ) = T N I0 = b exp(ct0 ) − a = 0. Thus, we obtain t0 =
Also we have:
˙ I(t) = bc exp(ct).
I(t) = T N
Then I(t0 ) =

ln(a) − ln(b)

C ONCLUSION

AND PERSPECTIVES

In this paper, we have analyzed the impact of anti-pandemic measures in Senegal. First,
we used techniques of fitting function to the data of the total number of cases. The
choice of the data fit function is crucial for the results since it allows the estimation of
the parameters of the compartmental model used. In a second work, we use machine
learning tools to also predict the future evolution of the pandemic in Senegal. Also, we
have integrated the effects of the measures into the prediction.
Depending on the measures taken, the pandemic’s trajectory may become slower or lose
its exponential nature. It would be interesting, in the following, to use other functions
of a slow nature like the logistical function to fit data and thus obtain different results.
A stochastic study using Brownian motions applied to the SIRU compartmental model
would also be interesting.
