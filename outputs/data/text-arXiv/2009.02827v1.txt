ABSTRACT

CCS CONCEPTS

Recent outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has led
a rapid global spread around the world. Many countries have
implemented timely intensive suppression to minimize the
infections, but resulted in high case fatality rate (CFR) due to
critical demand of health resources in the early phase of epidemic.
Other country-based factors such as sociocultural issues, ageing
population etc., has also influenced practical effectiveness of taking
interventions to improve morality in early phase. To better
understand the relationship of these factors across different
countries with COVID-19 CFR is of primary importance to prepare
for potentially second wave of COVID-19 infections. In the paper,
we propose a novel regularized multi-task learning (ML) based
factor analysis approach for quantifying country-based factors
affecting CFR in early phase of COVID-19 epidemic. We
formulate the prediction of CFR progression as a ML regression
problem with observed CFR and other countries-based factors. In
this formulation, all CFR related factors were categorized into 6
sectors with 27 indicators. We proposed a hybrid feature selection
method combining filter, wrapper and tree-based models to
calibrate initial factors for a preliminary feature interaction. Then
we adopted two typical single task model (Ridge and Lasso
regression) and one state-of-the-art MTFL method (fused sparse
group lasso) in our formulation. The fused sparse group Lasso
(FSGL) method allows the simultaneous selection of a common set
of country-based factors for multiple time points of COVID-19
epidemic and also enables incorporating temporal smoothness of
each factor over the whole early phase period. Finally, we proposed
one novel temporal voting feature selection scheme to balance the
weight instability of multiple factors in our MTFL model. Our
model was evaluated in a COVID-19 dataset containing 12
countries across the world and 17 provinces in China. The results
show that we explored each indicator’s correlation and calculated
its weight under current missing, sparse and insufficient data. we
discover that Power distance index (PDI), Diabetes mellitus disease
mortality rate, gender rate and SPAR_detect capability are
important factors associated to CFR over the whole early phase of
COVID-19 in a region or country.

INTRODUCTION

As of 1st April 2020, , the ongoing global epidemic outbreak of
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread to at least 146
countries and territories on 6 continents, resulted in 896 thousands
confirmed case and over 45 thousands deaths [1]. Most countries
have took timely intensive suppression that immediate lock-down
in cities at epicentre of outbreak like in Italy and China [33-35].
This intervention enables efficiently minimizing the infections in
the early phase of COVID-19 epidemic, but potentially resulted in
high case fatality rate (CFR) on the cases of critical shortage of
health resources. Also, owning to huge difference of other countrybased factors like culture issues, ageing population, urban density
etc., intensive suppression might consequence a widely varied CFR
across countries in the early phase of COVID-19 outbreak, such as
over 10% in Spain and Italy [2], but less than 4% in Germany and
Japan [2]. Thus, it reveals that practical effectiveness of COVID19 intervention strategies to certain country has been varied in light
of many country-based factors including aging population, human
mobility, health resources, culture issues, etc. It is crucial but hard
to know how these factors affect CFR in the early phase of COVID19 epidemic tailored to the specific situation in each country.
In order to explore the relationship of these factor with CFR,
feature selection [3] is a typical process to automatic or manual
selection of these significant features (factors) which contribute
most to certain prediction variable (CFR). In these process, the
most common techniques include: 1) filter methods that score each
feature according to their intrinsic relevance or correlation, set a
threshold or the number of thresholds to be selected, like ReliefF
[4-5], correlation-based feature selection [6], fast correlated based

filter [7], etc.; 2) wrapper methods that measure the usefulness of
features based on the classifier performance, such as recursive
feature elimination [8], sequential feature selection [9] or genetic
algorithms [10]. 3) Embedded and hybrid methods that performs
feature selection during the execution of optimising their objective
function or performance of a learning model or algorithm, including
L1 (Lasso) regularization [13-14] and decision tree algorithms
(CART, C4.5, random forest) [11-12] [15]. In the last decades,
above feature selection approaches have been utilised in many
practical applications with outstanding performance in removing
noise features and good versatility. However, one key problem of
above approaches is that they require sufficient and well-labelled
data or features to ensure the accurate learning task. In the COVID19 scenario, the CFR and its related country-based factors in the
early phase may contain huge uncertainty, sparse and missing data
that hardly train a fine model to select features.
Differing with traditional feature selection methods, multi-task
feature learning (MTFL) [16-18] approaches have shown a strong
capability to handle the problem of data insufficiency. This is the
case, when only a few data per task are available, learning or
training multiple related tasks simultaneously with shared features
can often greatly improve performance relative to learning each task
independently. Recently, many existing methods impose the shared
features by a generalized L1-norm regularization [19], or more
specifically, a joint regularization on the Lp,1-norm of the learning
weights [20], where p can be set to 1, 2, or other values. These
methods select the subspace while seeking the weights of the
decision functions by minimizing a convex optimisation problem
on the sum of the joint regularization and the loss [21-22]. These

regularized multi-task learning approaches [23-28] have been used
in many Alzheimer’s disease progression and deliver promising
performance in biomarker feature selections. MTFL techniques has
some potential to explore the impacts of factors on COVID-19 CFR.
In the paper, we propose a novel regularized multi-task feature
learning (ML) approach for measuring country-based factors
affecting CFR in early phase of COVID-19 epidemic. As shown in
Fig.1, we formulate the prediction of CFR progression as a ML
regression problem with observed CFR and other countries-based
factors. In this formulation, all CFR related country-based factors
were defined into 6 sectors including COVID-19 progression,
demographic information, morbidity of underlying diseases,
healthcare resources, international health regulation (IHR) core
capability and social-culture with 27 indicators. The prediction of
COVID-19 CFR at each week is a task, where multiple prediction
tasks at different time points are performed simultaneously to
capture the intrinsic temporal relatedness among different tasks.
We first proposed a hybrid feature selection method combining
filter, wrapper and tree-based models to calibrate initial factors for
a preliminary feature interaction. Then we adopted two typical
single task model (Ridge and Lasso regression) [29] and one stateof-the-art MTFL method (fused sparse group lasso) [28] in our
formulation. The fused sparse group Lasso (FSGL) method allows
the simultaneous selection of a common set of country-based
factors for multiple time points of COVID-19 epidemic and also
enables incorporating temporal smoothness of each factor over the
whole early phase period. Finally, we proposed one novel temporal
voting feature selection scheme to balance the weight instability of
1

multiple factors in our MTFL model. Our model was evaluated in a
COVID-19 dataset containing 12 countries across the world and 17
provinces in China. The results show that we explored each
indicator’s correlation and calculated its weight under current
missing, sparse and insufficient data. Our key contributions are:

One regularized MTFL approach is proposed for effectively
measuring country-based factors affecting CFR in early phase
of COVID-19 epidemic. In comparing to traditional singletask feature selection method [29], it can deal with insufficient
and uncertain COVID-19 data, and provide both global and
local temporal analytic of these factors over early phase of
COVID-19 epidemic.
One novel temporal voting feature selection scheme is
proposed to balance the weight instability of multiple factors
in our regularized MTFL approach. We provide an evidence
verification point that this scheme can significantly improve
the stability of MTFL model in processing complex COVID19 data.
By leveraging verification in experimental progress, we also
discover and proof that Power distance index (PDI), Diabetes
mellitus disease mortality rate, gender rate and SPAR_detect
capability are important factors associated to CFR over the
whole early phase of COVID-19 in a region or country. It
reveals that the culture difference might significantly affect
effectiveness of COVID-19 intervention in early phase.

The remainder of this paper is arranged as follows. Section 2
introduces our methodology of building the MTFL model for
COVID-19 CRF study. In the Section 3, the materials and
implementation of experiment are reported. Section 4 provides
detailed experimental evaluation and discussion. The conclusion
and future directions are given in Section 5.

2 Conceptualisation and data preprocessing
2.1 Conceptualisation
In epidemiology, the concept of case fatality rate (CFR) usually
refers to the proportion of deaths from a certain disease compared
to the total number of people diagnosed with the disease for a
certain period of time. A CFR is conventionally expressed as a
percentage and represents a measure of disease severity. As for
COVID-19, due to high transmission rate and insufficiency of test
kits in early phase, it is hard to identify real infectious population.
Thus, here, we would use a common definition of daily CFR with
confirmed death over confirmed infections every day, as shown in
Equation (1).

CFR 

Confirmed _ Death
Confirmed _ Infection

(1)

From this equation, it shows that the CFR has a direct relationship
with COVID-daily progression, which was defined as the first
sector as shown in the Table.1
In recent studies [1] [29-30], it revealed that timely suppression
in the early phase of COVID-19 epidemic can minimize the
infections in many countries, but result in high (CFR). In order to

study CFR associated factors, we searched PubMed with the search
terms ‘covid-19’, ‘death cause’, ‘factor importance’, ‘death
prediction’, and found out other CFR associated factors: 1) The
demographics includes the rate of aging population, gender and
smoking. 2) The morality of key diseases in a country refer to
several identified diseases associated to COVID-19 CFR, including
lung cancer, coronary heart disease, diabetes, hypertension. 3) The
healthcare resources includes rate of the number of hospital beds,
the number of physicals per million people, and health quality
index. As for social and behavioural issues of a region affecting the
CFR, WHO has measured each country to prevent, detect, and
respond to events are essential to control public health risks called
International Health Regulations (IHR), where it was categorized in
our factors as well. We have also considered to quantify socialculture index using Hofstede’s cultural dimensions theory [32],
including power distance index, individualism, masculinity, etc.
Finally, air quality index was also taken into account in our model.

2.2 Data collection and preprocessing
Considering stability and robustness of the prediction model, we
chose the regions with real reported death toll at 42 consecutive
days from the first confirmed COVID-19 case, totally 12 countries
(France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Spain,
Sweden, United Kingdom, China and Philippines) across the world

and 17 provinces in China. 6 factors of interest covering total 27
potential indicators of progression are selected that may affect the
CFR of the COVID-19 outbreak. Notably here, the reason that we
only use the first 42 days of COVID-19 epidemic is that many
countries have implemented suppression during the 35-45th day, as
a consequence of significant changes of our defined factors, like
health resources. After taking suppression for 2-3 weeks, socialculture issues have limited impacts on social distance measures in
most of countries.
We collected factors associated data sources mainly from worldmeter, WHO, world-bank and internal database from Oxford
University. There are various problems with the raw data collected,
such as missing values, outliers, etc. Most data sources do not have
structured data. In order to allow our MTFL model to work properly,
we have done some data preprocessing with following steps: 1). to
clarify and unify the attributes of data from multiple resources for
matching associated factors. 2) to remove or merge data with
repeated attributes. 3) To identify and remove some apparent
outliners. 4) To smooth and remove some noise data. Notably, in
the process of collecting data, it is inevitable that some sampling
data were missed. The average method was used to fill in the data
in order to minimize its impact on MTFL learning.

2.3 Preliminary feature processing
When converting initial CFR factor associated data into reliable and
accurate features, we proposed a hybrid feature selection method
combining filter, wrapper and tree-based models to calibrate initial
factors for a preliminary feature interaction. Firstly, we made a
standard scaling process to all data, and use simple univariate
features to make a preliminary selection. Then, we applied Pearson
Correlation and F-score to measure the linear correlation between
each feature and the CFR. Based on these two filters, we could
effectively remove some noise features and keep good versatility.
But only filter methods cannot guarantee that the selected feature
subset is the optimal feature subset that matches the subsequent
machine learning algorithm. Then, we have applied three wrapper
methods (recursive feature elimination (RFE), random forest and
XGBoost) to train the features. After each round of training, the
features corresponding to several weight coefficients are eliminated,
and then the next round of training is performed based on the new
feature set. We use RFE to exhaustively delete a feature that has the
least negative impact on the model in the existing feature subset
until the number of selected features meets the requirements.
Random Forest and XGBoost are tree-based machine learning
models. These non-parametric tree models record how each
variable gradually reduces the model loss in the bifurcation of tree
nodes during the establishment process and can analyze the feature
importance of each feature based on the above records, we can
delete some unimportant variables based on the importance ranking.
After taking above preliminary feature processing, the final training
data set is to take the intersection of features selected by the first
two coefficients, plus the intersection of features selected by the
three models. The combination of multiple methods enhances
robustness. It is worth noting that all the above feature selection

schemes are operated under the setting of a single task, that is, every
time point.

3 Multi-task feature learning
3.1 Problem formulation
In order to simultaneously train above a variety of CFR associated
factors, a multi-task feature learning model was constructed, as
shown in Fig.1. Consider a multi-task learning of k tasks with n
training samples of d features. Let {x1,x2,…, xn}be the input data
for the samples, and {y1,y2,…,yn}be the predicted value for each
sample, where each xi ∈ ℝd represents the feature data of a CFR
associated factor, and y i ∈ ℝ k is the predicted value of CFR in a
certain region or country. The formula for a linear regression model
is given by fi(x) = xTwi where w i is the weight vector of the model.
Here in ML, a matrix representation is performed and facilitates
intuitive understanding of algorithm and actual programming
operations.
Then, let X = [x1, ···, xn]T ∈ ℝn ×d be the data matrix, Y = [y1, ··,
yn]T ∈ ℝn ×k be the predicted matrix, and W = [w1, w2,…, wk] ∈ ℝd×k
be the weight matrix. The process of establishing a MTL model is
to estimate the value of W, which is the parameter to be estimated
from the training samples. One common paradigm for regression in
MTL is to minimize the following objective function as below:

min L(Y, X, W)   R(W)

(2)

W

where L (Y, X, W) means the empirical loss on the training set, R
(W) is the regularization term that encodes task relatedness and λ is
the regularization parameter.
In order to solve above optimisation problem, many prior work
that model relationships among tasks using regularizations
methods. Normally, they assume the loss to be square loss and
common regularization terms are L1 norm and L2 norm, which are
separately named as Lasso regression [22] and ridge regression
models [22]. These two models are well-known sparse
representation linear algorithms, which simultaneously performs
feature selection and regression. One limitation of the regression
model above is that the tasks at different time points are supposed
to be independent with each other, which is not the case in the
temporal and multifactorial study considered in this article.

3.2 Temporal supporting group structure
As shown in Equation 1, Daily CFR is as an indicator directly
associated with daily confirmed death and cases of COVID-19. But
these two values are accumulated to the day. Considering that in our
MTFL model, the prediction of CFR at a single time point as a
regression task, we formulate the progression of crucial mortality
as a multi-task regression problem. Here, when multiple tasks are
cascaded together, the missions of some tasks are unified, each task
is no longer limited, and they work together to predict critical time
points. Therefore, the selection and definition of critical CFR time
point are crucial to the performance of our MTFL model.
3

If the daily CFR is employed as the prediction for daily tasks, the
model will lose stability. One nearly universal truth is that an
epidemic disease stops spreading, and the mortality rate will be a
fixed value. However, during the propagation process, this value is
constantly shaking, but it will eventually converge. This
phenomenon is similar to the stochastic gradient descent process in
optimization theory. Thus, for improving the generality of our
MTFL model, we consider a group structure which enables
coupling the related tasks using one common task target of daily
CFR (critical time point). More precisely, we assume that the tasks
are divided into groups, and each group has 7 tasks. In the group,
the learning objective of the seventh task is the joint learning target
of all tasks. Between groups: the key mortality time point shared
within group support the continuous progress between the groups.
The framework can be flexibly applied to the real-world scene of
the epidemic, as shown in Fig.1.D.
This partially single-output multi-task structure is similar to the
optimization of mini-batch gradient descent (MBGD). In the
optimization, MBGD takes into account the advantages of batch
gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent, which avoids the
inefficient strategy of using overall samples and the oscillation
caused by the use of a single sample. Analogously, the structure we
proposed in this paper not only avoids the use of a single target for
all tasks, resulting in the same learned pattern for all tasks, but also
reduces the model oscillation caused by the use of own target for
each task, thereby improving the robustness of the model.

considers both common features at different points in time and
unique features to each task. This feature is helpful to improve the
overall performance of the model. cFSGL formulation solves the
following convex optimization problem:

min || Y  XW ||2F 1 || W ||1 2 || RW T ||1 3 || W ||2,1 (5)
w

where the first term measures the empirical error on the training
data, ||W||1 is the lasso penalty, ||RWT||1 is the fused lasso penalty,
and ||W||2,1 is the group lasso penalty.
Lasso and group lasso combined employ is called sparse group
lasso, which allows simultaneous selection of a common feature for
all time points and internally generates sparse solutions in response
to different time points. Fused lasso penalty having a given
temporal smoothness, which makes selected features at nearby time
points similar to each other. In addition, notice that FSGL's formula
involves three non-smooth terms. We propose to solve this
optimization problem using accelerated gradient descent method.
As shown in Fig.3, we demonstrated the key difference of single
task models (Lasso regression) [29] and MTL model (FSGL) [28]
as targeted methods.

3.3 Structural regularization method
Structural regularization methods in MTL constrains optimization
by using regularization terms and shares information between tasks.
In the research of Alzheimer's disease (AD) progress, MTL has
made outstanding contributions, there are many prior work [21-29]
that model relationships among tasks using novel regularization. In
order to solve our regression model, we have main considered two
typical single task model (Ridge and Lasso regression) [29] and one
state-of-the-art MTFL method (fused sparse group lasso) [28] in our
formulation.
Ridge regression constrains variables to a smaller range for
reducing some factors with little impacts on model’s prediction.
Unfortunately, this reduction means that these variables are still
considered. To solve this problem, Lasso was proposed as a new
sparse representation linear algorithm, which simultaneously
performs feature selection and regression. Some variables are set to
zero directly to achieve sparsity and dimensionality reduction.

The fused sparse group Lasso (FSGL) method [28] allows the
simultaneous selection of a common set of country-based factors
for multiple time points of COVID-19 epidemic and also enables
incorporating temporal smoothness of each factor over the whole
early phase period. FSGL involves sparsity between tasks, where it

Fig.3. Difference between Lasso [29] and FSGL [28]
Notably, in Fig.3, it appears that each column represents the
weight of one task model, but the difference is that the vision of
Lasso only covers the current model itself, and the learning of each
weight of FSGL takes into account the relationship with other tasks.
From the distribution of weights in matrix, FSGL demonstrates a
meaningful and regular temporal pattern along 7 days than Lasso.
FSGL’s constraint rules are executed simultaneously on the weights
of multiple tasks at the same time. First, a feature can be captured
when all tasks are important or not, e.g. Lines 4 and 5. This is a
common factor in all tasks. In addition, the specificity of each task
model can also be captured, e.g. except for the first feature, most
weights of Day1 and Day2 are the same. The structure of FSGL
combined with temporal smooth constraints has achieved excellent
effects in the study of Alzheimer's disease progression, and this
property is once again applied to our framework to fit the tendency
of the epidemic. The pattern fitted by the model mines a subset of
features that play a role as the epidemic development.

3.4 Temporal voting feature selection

While FGCS based MTFL algorithms help analyse the importance
of CFR associated factors, one important issue in our experiments
is that due to huge uncertainty of COVID-19 dataset, the above
MTFL algorithm perform instable. This phenomenon may be
related to the randomness of the algorithm itself to the data. In order
to unravel this problem, we scheme to repeat the experiment
multiple times. Under the guidance of the law of large numbers, the
stability of features can be captured. Thus, we proposed one novel
temporal voting feature selection scheme to balance the weight
instability of multiple factors in our MTFL model.
As shown in Fig.4, the feature sets are submitted to the voting
center to be summarized. The voting center is a global feature count
table that maintains to record the number of times a feature has been
selected by all tasks. The cumulative counter polls among tasks to
perform counting operations. The statistical results sort the global
feature count table and take the features of the top numbers as the
result of feature selection. Specifically, for task i feature: subset j,
we detect each feature i:

1, featurei _ in _ subseti
si  
0, featurei _ not _ in _ subseti

4.1 Parameter settings
The goal of multi-task learning is to improve the learning
performance of the algorithm by making use of the correlation
between different tasks. In the following, the model performance
based on this assumption is verified. During each training session,
dataset was randomly split into training and testing sets using a ratio
9:1, i.e., models were built on 90% of the data and evaluated on the
remaining 10% of the data. Models parameters were selected by 5fold cross validation. The mean and standard deviation in results
based on 100 iterations of experiments on different splits of data.
The evaluation metric of model is the modified rMSE with multitask model estimation. The detailed mathematical definition is as
follows:

rMSE 

(7)

Practically, our voting mechanism will be employed twice in the
MTFL. Firstly, in an experiment, we focused on the weight of the
trained model, and counted the importance of the weight (voting),
and then ranked according to the importance (ranking). Secondly,
we aim at the ranking obtained from all the experiments in the
previous step, and sum up to obtain the total ranking importance
(voting), and then rank according to the total importance (ranking).
Once the stability feature ranking is obtained, it can be used to
reversely find the best experimental model. It is worth noting that
relaxing conditions are allowed, for example, part of important
features (top features) in the best experiment match the ranking of
stable features.

where the loss for the t task is calculated separately, and finally
added together and divided by the total task sample. Length (i)
denotes the number of samples in the i-th task, Y (i) represents the
actual value of the sample, and Y (i) _hat denotes the predicted
value of the sample.
We employed sample data from 32 countries and regional data
from more than 20 provinces in mainland China. All countries /
regions were observed for 42 days at the beginning of the outbreak,
corresponding to 42 sub-task models. As mentioned above, every 7
tasks are a learning stage. In terms of the progress of the entire
project, 42 days can be divided into 3 sub-phases to observe the
phenomenon: prior period, middle period and last period. Multitask learning method was reproduced and compared with two
single-task learning methods (ridge regression and Lasso
regression) at the same time.

4.2 Global importance of CFR factors
Our first experiment is to evaluate the global importance of CFR
factors over 42 days in the early phase of COVID-19 using single
task model (Ridge, Lasso) and MTFL (FSGL) model. After running
100 times of repeated experiments, Table.2 shows the performance
of model accuracy and stability. It shows that our proposed MTFL
is more stable than single task regression model, where its feature
analysis is more convinced in a global setting.

Fig.5 demonstrates the importance of CFR associated factors over
the whole 42 days. These three training models show similar results
that the most important factors associated to CFR in a region or
country are Power distance index (PDI), Diabetes mellitus disease
mortality rate, gender rate and SPAR_detect capability.

4.3 Local importance of CFR factors
Our second experiment is to evaluate the local importance of CFR
factors over 42 days in the early phase of COVID-19 using single
task model (Ridge, Lasso) and MTFL (FSGL) model. Similarly, we
use the model training results from Table.2 to generate the heat-map
of three models in Fig.5. The results show that single task model
(Ridge and Lasso) cannot demonstrate meaning or regular temporal
pattern of CFR associated factors. It means that these models only
work on evaluating global importance of CFR factors, but not work
on local importance of CFR factors. But our proposed MTFL shows
advantages on temporal smoothness, where its feature analysis is
more convinced in showing local importance.

4.4 Feature ranking stability comparison
As we mentioned, the COVID-19 data in early phases contain huge
uncertainty and insufficiency, as a result of MTFL model training
instability. In order to better understand the effectiveness of our
proposed MTFL model, we have used SEIR model to generate some
daily progress COVID-19 data, and taken different experimental
protocols to evaluate them: 1) to use only 48 real sample data for
training each task. 2) to use 48 real sample data and 7 simulated
data for training each task. Above experiments have been run over
100 times. The results are shown in Fig. 6.
The results show that the most important factors associated to
CFR over the whole early phase of COVID-19 in a region or
country are Power distance index (PDI) and Diabetes mellitus
disease mortality rate. It reveals that the culture difference might
significantly affect effectiveness of COVID-19 intervention in early
phase. In some Asian countries with higher PDI, timely suppression
is much easier accepted than these countries with lower PDI. This
issue needed to be noticed in preparation of the possible second
wave of COVID-19.

FSGL

Meanwhile, in order to evaluate stability of each sector of CFR
associated factor under different setting, we have evaluated them
separately, as shown in Table.3. The results show that if we took all

Fig.6. Global and Local importance of CFR factors using real and simulated data.
CFR associated factors in training our MTFL model (No 1 and 2),
the model shows the best accuracy and stability. But using all real
data in No 1 gives the best training performance. If we reduce the
daily progression factors (No 5), the training accuracy significantly
reduced, where it means that the CFR is directly associated with
COVID-19 daily progression factors. If we reduce healthcare or
social-culture factors, the training accuracy reduced some but it is
probably due to reduced data samples.

4.5. Discussion
There are some limitations to our proposed MTFL model and
analysis. First, our model’s training depends on the practically
collected COVID-19 data with huge uncertainty. The quality of raw
dataset greatly impacts on training performance. Due to insufficient
sample data, we have to take each province of China as an
individual region in the dataset. This might lead to global
distribution and balance of dataset, where the data from China
shows a strong impact on results. Secondly, it is hard to define an
accurate baseline of CRF associated data to train the model. The
confirmed infection case of COVID-19 in each country is heavily
depended on their screening capability, but not reflects the real
infectious population. While we have tried to use SIER model to
simulate some confirmed case, the training results show that this
simulated data does not help improve stability of training model.
We would attempt to improve it in the future work.

5 CONCLUSION
In the paper, we propose a novel regularized multi-task feature
learning (MTFL) approach for measuring country-based factors
affecting CFR in early phase of COVID-19 epidemic. It can deal
with insufficient and uncertain COVID-19 data, and provide both
global and local temporal analytic of these factors over early phase
of COVID-19 epidemic. We believe that this MTFL approach can
be used to analysis more factors in future COVID-19 research work.
