Abstract. Echo chambers may exclude social media users from being
exposed to other opinions, therefore, can cause rampant negative effects. Among abundant evidence are the 2016 and 2020 US presidential
elections conspiracy theories and polarization, as well as the COVID-19
disinfodemic. To help better detect echo chambers and mitigate its negative effects, this paper explores the mechanisms and attributes of echo
chambers in social media. In particular, we first illustrate four primary
mechanisms related to three main factors: human psychology, social networks, and automatic systems. We then depict common attributes of echo
chambers with a focus on the diffusion of misinformation, spreading of
conspiracy theory, creation of social trends, political polarization, and
emotional contagion of users. We illustrate each mechanism and attribute
in a multi-perspective of sociology, psychology, and social computing with
recent case studies. Our analysis suggest an emerging need to detect echo
chambers and mitigate their negative effects.

Introduction

The attributes of social media including low cost, easy access, and fast information
dissemination mean that more people are consuming news from social media
instead of traditional news outlets [47]. However, both high-quality and low-quality
information have been spread widely. Social media also limits the exposure to
diverse opinions and forms groups of like-minded users [8]. This results in echo
chambers: a place in which people only encounter beliefs, opinions, or views that
reflect and reinforce their own [26]. Recent events such as the 2016 US presidential
election and COVID-19 infodemic have evidence shown that trolls, shills, and
cyborgs are actively peddling misinformation in social media [12, 21, 23]. The
recommender algorithms behind social media exacerbate the echo chambers by
consistently presenting narratives about similar stances to users [39].
To contribute to the fight against this problem, we explore the individual
and societal behaviors with existing literature. Four primary mechanisms underlying echo chambers effects are discussed. At their core, technology (e.g, the

2

recommender algorithms of social media platforms) is the main cause of the
proliferation of echo chambers in social media. Human psychology (e.g, confirmation bias and cognitive dissonance) and social networks(e.g, homophily) are also
considered because they reinforce the existence of each other via a correlated
feedback loop. To develop better echo chamber detection models, it is imperative
to understand the mechanisms and common attributes beforehand. Previous
studies describe echo chambers in different perspectives [3, 6, 27], but we focus on
three crucial features to discuss the primary mechanisms and common attributes
of echo chambers in social media: (1) Echo chambers are a network of users
in social media; (2) the content shared in that network is one-sided and very
similar in the stance and opinion on different topics; and (3) outside voices are
discredited and actively excluded from the discussion.

Mechanisms of Echo Chambers

In this section, we detail the primary mechanisms underlying echo chambers shown
in Figure 1: recommender algorithms related to automatic systems, confirmation
bias and cognitive dissonance related to human psychology, and homophily related
to social networks.

Fig. 1. Primary mechanisms underlying echo chamber effect related to three main
factors: automatic systems such as recommender algorithms (Section 2.1), human
psychology such as confirmation bias and cognitive dissonance (Sections 2.2 and 2.3),
and social networks such as homophily (Section 2.4). These mechanisms are not mutually
independent but highly correlated in a way that ultimately create feedback loops that
further reinforce the existence of each other.

2.1

Recommender Algorithms

Recommender algorithms trap users into personalized information by using
their past behaviors to tailor recommendations to their preferences [40]. These

prediction engines “constantly create and refine a theory of who you are and what
you will do and want next” [39], which then forms a unique universe of information
around each of us. For example, when clicking on a news article, we show our
interest in articles on this topic. The recommender algorithms take note of our
behavior and will present more articles about similar topics in the future. As the
process evolves, we are getting more and more personalized information, which
ultimately leads us to: (1) becoming the only person in the formed universe, (2) not
knowing how information is recommended, and (3) unable to choose whether
to enter this process [39]. This self-reinforcing pattern of narrow exposure and
concentrated user interest caused by recommender algorithms is an important
mechanism behind the echo chamber effect.
Among the many outcomes of such recommender algorithms, e.g., narrower
self-interest, overconfidence, decreased motivation to learn, the likely exacerbated
polarization has the most negative impact. For this reason, many researchers have
criticized recommender algorithms for the increase in societal polarization [20, 24,
40]. For example, Dandekar et al. [10] showed how many traditional recommender
algorithms used on internet platforms can lead to polarization of user opinions
in society. Therefore, an important line of research studies how to diversify the
recommendation results, e.g., [28].
2.2

Confirmation Bias

Confirmation bias is the tendency to seek, interpret, favor, and recall information adhering to preexisting opinions [38]. According to the selective exposure
research [19], we tend to seek supporting information while avoiding challenging
information. Echo chambers are among one of the many outcomes of confirmation
bias. The rampant use of social media further amplifies the effect of confirmation
bias on echo chambers. There are three types of confirmation bias: biased search
for information [37], biased interpretation of information [32], and biased memory
recall of information [25]. In the context of social media, for example, users
not only actively seek news that is consistent with their current hypothesis but
also interpret information in their own ways. Even if both the collection and
interpretation are neutral, they probably remember information selectively to
reinforce their expectations, i.e., selective recall effect [25].
Confirmation bias and the provision of recommender algorithms create a
self-reinforcing spiral. As described in Figure 1, on one hand, recommender
algorithms provide users with more of the same content based on their past
behaviors to shape the future preference; on the other hand, users accept and
even actively seek such information due to confirmation bias. The feedback loop
between recommender algorithms and human psychology eventually leads to an
echo chamber that shifts users’ world view.
2.3

Cognitive Dissonance

In the field of social psychology, cognitive dissonance refers to an internal contradiction between two opinions, beliefs, or items of knowledge [17]. For example, if

4

someone eats meat but at the same time cares about the animals’ life [33]. On
the grounds that people strive towards consistency, they psychologically feel the
pressure to reduce or eliminate the distress caused by dissonance. Festinger [17]
introduced three major strategies for dissonance reduction: (1) change one or
more of the beliefs, opinions, or behaviors, (2) increase consonance by acquiring
new information or belief, (3) forget or reduce the importance of the cognitions.
Echo chambers are considered as one of the practices in reducing dissonance.
People try to seek out for ideologically consonant platforms and interactions to
avoid contact with individuals that confront their ideas [16]. Moreover, ideological
homogeneity in online echo chambers can encourage extremism. There are two
aspects for this stimulation: (1) one’s commitment to their thought will increase
dramatically if it has been written down and disseminated to a public audience [7].
For example, the act of tweeting or posting contents on social media websites;
and (2) discussion with like-minded individuals as well as the social support will
reinforce the correctness of that belief [19]. For instance, liking tweets/posts and
retweeting/reposting thus boosting attitude extremity [5]. All of which are in
support of decreasing individuals’ cognitive dissonance.
2.4

Homophily

Homophily, also known as love of the same, is the process by which similar
individuals become friends or connected due to their high similarity [52]. This
similarity can be of two types: (1) status homophily, and (2) value homophily [36].
Status homophily deals with people who connect due to similar ascribed (sex,
race, or ethnicity) or acquired characteristics (education or religion). Value
homophily involves grouping similar people based on their values, attitudes, and
beliefs regardless of their differences in status characteristics [36]. Depending
on the echo chamber’s ideology, the echo chamber can be formed due to status
homophily, value homophily, or both. Social media and other online technologies
have loosened the basic sources of homophily such as geography and allowed users
to bind homophilous relationships on other dimensions like race, ethnicity, sex,
gender, and religion. Moreover, homophily has predictive and analytic power on
social media and can be measured by how the assortativity, also known as social
similarity, of the network has changed over time and modeled using independent
cascade models (ICM) [52]. By measuring political homophily on Twitter, we
can investigate whether the structure of communication is an echo chamber- or
public sphere-like [9], or whether there is a homophilous difference between the
echo chambers of conservative individuals and liberal ones [4].

Attributes of Echo Chambers

In this section, we illustrate five common attributes of echo chambers: diffusion of
misinformation, spreading of conspiracy theory, creation of social trends, political
polarization, and emotional contagion of users. We also discuss their different
outcomes, social impacts, and potential risks.

Mechanisms and Attributes of Echo Chambers in Social Media

3.1

Diffusion of Misinformation

Nowadays, mainstream social media platforms are used by people due to easy
access, low cost, and fast dissemination of news pieces [47]. However, the quality
and credibility of the content spread in social media is considered lower than
traditional news media because of a lack of regulatory authority. Thus, people
manipulate the public by leveraging echo chambers to propagate misinformation [49]. Echo chambers exclude dissenting opinions, make users insist on their
confirmation bias, and let misinformation go viral.
Despite early efforts have been undertaken to mitigate online misinformation [21, 45, 46], the COVID-19 related misinformation were widely spreading on
social media as a global crisis. Existing methods have been ineffective for the
COVID-19 infodemic because: (1) the contents are novel and highly deceptive;
(2) the dissemination is rapid; and (3) they require experts with domain knowledge
to fact-check. Echo chambers in social media manipulate not only influencers but
also common people to become misinformation spreaders. They enable users to
intentionally or unintentionally disseminate misinformation faster [49]. Misinformation spread in echo chambers usually contains three characteristics: (1) similar
misinformation is frequently scrolled and repeated to the users; (2) the contents
are inflammatory and emotional; and (3) meant to mislead people by exploiting
social cognition and cognitive biases. Because the diffusion of misinformation
is one of the most common attributes of echo chambers in social media, echo
chamber detecting methods should take it into consideration.
3.2

Spreading of Conspiracy Theories

Echo chambers in social media have provided fertile grounds for conspiracy
theories to spread quicker. Existing research illustrates that various conspiracy
theories have been circulating through mainstream media [22, 29]. Conspiracy
theories are attempts to explain the ultimate causes of significant social and
political events and circumstances [14]. Conspiracy believers use social media to
find each other, disseminate conspiracy contents, and share fringe viewpoints.
Conspiracy theories express and amplify anxieties and fears about losing control
of religious, political, or social order [34]. Unlike misinformation, conspiracy
theories are often strongly believed by governments. This results in catastrophic
impact to society. For example, AIDS denial by the government of South Africa,
was estimated to have resulted in the deaths of 333,000 people [48].
Despite the fact that there was no clear evidence about “the 2020 US presidential election was stolen by Democrats”, Trump and his rallies kept tweeting this
claim to supporters. As a result, Trump’s supporters including Proud Boy, QAnon,
and the Oath Keepers supporters participated in the deadly capitol riot [11].
Prior intelligence indicated that several organizations issued warning about this
event and potential violence in the days leading up to the storming. Advance
Democracy, Inc., an independent, nonpartisan, non-profit organization, reported
1,480 posts on Twitter from QAnon-related accounts about the scheduled capitol
riot contained “term of violence”. They also identified TikTok videos with more

6

Bohan Jiang, Mansooreh Karami, Lu Cheng, Tyler Black, and Huan Liu

than 279,000 views that called for rebellion beforehand1 . While several social
media companies suspended the capitol riot-related posts and accounts from their
platforms afterward, other conspiracy theories are shared and spread through
social media as an attribute of echo chamber [44].
3.3

Creation of Social Trends

Social media presents temporal popular topics as social trends on the main
website to attract user’s attention. Many studies have tried to discover the
important factors that cause trending topics [35, 41, 51]. Asur et al. [2] found that
the resonance of the content with the users of the social network is crucial. They
further define the measurement of “resonance” in three parts: (1) the novelty of
content; (2) the influence of members of the diffusion network; and (3) the impact
of media outlets when the topics originate in standard news media. Information
with high “novelty”, “influence”, and “impact” can capture huge attention in a
short time. Thus, information spread from echo chambers in social media have the
capability to create trending topics due to their large scope, like-minded stance,
and social influence. Despite social trends containing misinformed statements and
false claims, they were presented by social media and reported by mainstream
news media [34]. Social media platforms, influencers, and news media outlets
should take responsibility to carefully display and report social trends. Moreover,
social trends can be supervised to detect echo chambers for malicious activities.
3.4

Political Polarization

In the 2020 US presidential election, both of the two main candidates received
more than 74 million votes. Joe Biden created a historic record with a total
of more than 81 million ballots received. It is clear that the United States
experienced record levels of voter engagement, but it also means the country is
extremely polarized. As shown in Figure 2, the gap between two major parties
in the US has increased while the overlapping has decreased significantly over
the past two decades. In social media, we can observe two giant partisan echo
chambers represent two major political groups of people with opposite political
opinion and stances [9]. Given that individuals tend to align with those who
are like-minded in nature, politicians and parties intentionally reinforce the
partisan bias inside echo chambers, leading to an increasing level of political
polarization [31]. For example, Levy et al. [31] illustrated that politicians made
decisions and policies motivated by political purposes rather than social benefits.
Political polarization can cause extreme selective exposure, cognitive bias, and
correlation neglect [43]. However, Dubois et al. [15] found that there is only a
small segment of the population are likely to find themselves in an echo chamber.
Essentially, the impact of partisan echo chambers is overstated. They suggested
that echo chamber researchers should test the theory in the realistic context of a
multiple media environment.

3.5

Emotional Contagion of Users

Emotional states can be transferred to others via emotional contagion, leading
people to suffer from the same emotions without their awareness [18, 42]. A
recent study showed that extreme emotions are exposed and amplified by echo
chambers [50]. This manifestation is usually caused by users who continually
receiving misleading contents and conspiracy theories. For example, from a
COVID-19 case study of China, Ahmed et al. [1] illustrated that young people,
aged 21-40 years old, were suffering from psychological problems during the
COVID-19 epidemic. This is because young people who frequently participate
in social media repeatedly receive broadcasts of fatality rate, confirmed cases,
and misleading information via echo chambers. Moreover, Del et al. found that
inside the echo chamber, active users appear to become highly emotional relative
to less active users [13]. Their analysis indicated that the higher involvement in
the echo chamber enables more negative mental behaviors. Kramer et al. [30]
provided experimental evidence that emotional contagion can occur without
direct interaction between people, and in the complete absence of nonverbal
cues. These types of echo chambers are difficult to detect in social media via
content-based or network-based methods.

Conclusions and Future Work

In times of crisis, whether political or health-related, misinformation, conspiracy
theory, and extreme speech are widely spread and amplified by echo chambers
in social media platforms. In this paper, we explored echo chambers in social
media by reviewing existing literature in the fields of sociology, psychology, and
social computing. In the mechanisms section, we discussed the key mechanisms
that lead to the formation and growth of echo chambers. We illustrated that
echo chambers were not only caused by the recommender algorithms, but also
the specific confirmation bias, cognitive dissonance, and homophily among users.

Next, by reviewing the external circumstances of recent events, we illustrated five
common attributes. Our analysis indicated that the diffusion of misinformation
is the most common attribute. Meanwhile, the spreading of conspiracy theory,
creation of social trending, political polarization, and emotional contagion of users
are represented as well. Further, the effects of leaderships, social media influencers,
and news outlets cannot be diminished. Existing echo chamber detection models
can only tackle this problem in a algorithmic aspect. More educational works
should be encouraged for social media participants to understand the mechanisms,
attributes, and risks of echo chambers. It is also promising to consider the role of
sociological and psychological theories in recommender algorithms.
