The global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic suggests a novel type of disease spread dynamics. WHO states that there is currently no evidence that people who have
recovered from COVID-19 and have antibodies are immune from a second infection [1]. Conventional mathematical models consider cases for which a recovered individual either becomes susceptible again or develops an immunity.
Here, we study the case where infected agents recover and only develop immunity if they are continuously infected for some time. Otherwise, they become
susceptible again. We show that field theory bounds the peak of the infectious
rate. Consequently, the theory’s phases characterise the disease dynamics: (i)
a pandemic phase and (ii) a response regime. The model excellently describes
the epidemic spread of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in the city of Wuhan, China.
We find that only 30% of the recovered agents have developed an immunity.
We anticipate our paper to influence the decision making upon balancing the
economic impact and the pandemic impact on society. As long as disease controlling measures keep the disease dynamics in the “response regime”, a pan1

demic escalation (’second wave’) is ruled out.

Introduction The rapid spread of a disease across a particular region or regions (epidemic) or
the global outbreak of a disease (pandemic) [2] can have a detrimental effect on health systems,
on local and global economies including the financial markets and the socio-economic interactions, ranging from the city to the international level. Measures to reduce the pandemic spread
include curtailing interactions between infected and uninfected parts of the population, reducing infectiousness or the susceptibility of members of the public [3]. The two major strategies
governments use to handle an outbreak are to slow down an outbreak (mitigation) or to interrupt
the disease spread (suppression). Since each of those interventions bears itself significant risks
for the societal and economic well-being, it is crucial to understand the effectiveness of these
strategies (or any hybrid of them).
Mathematical methods provide essential input for governmental decision making that aims
at controlling the outbreak. Among those are statistical methods [4, 5], deterministic statespace models [6] with its prototype developed by Kermack and McKendrick [7], and a variety
of complex network models, e.g., [8, 9]. The different mathematical approaches have different objectives: A significant application of the statistical methods frequently aims at the early
detection of disease outbreaks [4], while modelling either tries to develop a model as realistic
as possible for a given outbreak or to design a simplistic model, which, however, reveals some
universal truth about the outbreak dynamics.
In the simplest version, the so-called compartmental models [7, 10] consider the fraction
of the population which is either susceptible (S), infected (I) or removed (R) from the disease
network. Coupled differential equations capture the dynamics of the disease that determine the
time dependence of S, I and R. Extensions add more compartments to the SIR model such as
(E) exposed. For example, such an SEIR model was used in [11] for a description of the Ebola

2

outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 1995. Compartmental models have been
applied to describe the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]. For example, the
elaborate model from Giordano at al. uses a total of 8 compartments - susceptible (S), infected
(I), diagnosed (D), ailing (A), recognized (R), threatened (T), healed (H) and extinct (E) - to
describe the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy. Compartmental models have been extended in order
to capture stochastically unknown influences, such as changing behaviours [18]. Such models
were recently used to analyse the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan [19].
Compartmental models address global quantities such as the fraction of susceptible individuals S and assume that heuristic rate equations can describe the disease dynamics. In cases
of a strongly inhomogeneous (social) network, e.g. taking into account different population
densities, the above assumption seems not always be justified. In these cases, spatial disease
spread patterns can be described by a stochastic network model with Monte-Carlo simulations
a common choice for the simulation.
In this paper, we consider a disease dynamics for which the duration (severity) of the illness
depends on the amount of exposure. Using an elementary (social) network, we are looking for
universal mechanisms describing a pandemic spread. We will reveal a connection to statistical
field theory, enabling us to characterise an outbreak with the tools of critical phenomena. We
will discuss the impact of the findings on policies to curb an outbreak and will draw conclusions
from the recent Covid19 outbreak in Hubei, China.

Model basics: We assume that each individual has two states u with u = 0 - susceptible and
u = 1 - infected. Each individual interacts with four ’neighbours’ of the social network. The
disease spread is described as a stochastic process. At each time step (say ’day’), the probability
that an individual gets infected (or recovers) depends on the status of the neighbours in the social
network. Here, we only study the simple case of a homogeneous network with four neighbours
3

for each site. We also consider periodic boundary conditions to minimise edge effects.

Immunity: We study two closely related scenarios.
(i) There is no immunity. Every individual can be reinfected and can recover only to be
susceptible again.
(ii) Individuals can be reinfected and recover. Only if individuals stay infected for τ consecutive days, they are considered immune.
In case (ii), the sites of immune individuals are removed from the disease network.

Disease dynamics:

If x is a site of the disease network, at every time step the state ux ∈ {0, 1}

is randomly chosen with probability
P (ux ) =

y∈hxyi

where hxyi is an elementary link on the lattice joining sites x and y and, hence, n is the number
of infected neighbours, and Nx = 1 + exp {4β nx + 2h} is the normalisation. The parameter
β describes the contagiousness of the disease. The parameter h is linked to the probability
to contract the disease from outside the network. In fact, if no-one of the network is infected
(nx = 0, ∀x), the probability p that any individual contracts the diseases, is connected to h by
p =

exp{2h}
.
1 + exp{2h}

If the lattice contains N individuals (i.e., sites), one time step is said to be completed if we have
considered N randomly chosen sites for the update.

Figure 2: Left: Scenario (ii): rate of infected (red bars) and rate of infected + immune (green
bars) for two sets of model parameters: pandemic phase (p = 0.05, β = 0.41) and response
regime ( p = 0.04, β = 0.38) both for τ = 11. Right: Comparison of scenario (ii) results with
actual data from the COVID-19 outbreak in Hubei province.
p > 0 triggers an infection rate close to 100 % of the population. The model is in the ’pandemic’
phase. For β < βc , the model is in the ’response’ phase, i.e., the infection rate is in repose to the
seed probability p, but no outbreak occurs. The asymptotic infection rate can be calculated using
Markov Monte-Carlo methods. We used a modified Swendsen-Wang cluster algorithm, which
performs near the phase transition [22]. Our numerical findings are summarised in figure 1, left
panel. Curve 2 clearly separates both phases - the pandemic phase and the response regime.
Note that the dynamics (1) corresponds to the standard heat-bath update [23]. Starting from a
healthy population (ux = 0, ∀x), it takes the ’thermalisation’ time tth that the daily infection
rate starts fluctuating around its asymptotic value.

Immunity: Let us now study scenario (ii), where individuals can develop immunity if they
are infected for τ consecutive days. For τ > tth , the peak infection rate is that of the asymptotic state of the corresponding model (i) and, hence, inherits the classification ’pandemic’ or
’response’ phase. This is illustrated in figure 1, right panel, for the pandemic phase for several

6

values of τ . Figure 2 illustrates the vastly different behaviour of the disease spread in the pandemic phase (β = 0.41, p = 5%) and in the response regime (β = 0.38, p = 4%). Results
are for a N = 100 × 100 network and τ = 11. Note that the curve for ’infected+immune’
(’triangle’ symbol) in the pandemic phase is not monotonically increasing with time since the
infected individuals can return to ’susceptible’ state, i.e., not every infected individual becomes
immune. Note that in the response regime (’circle’ and ’square’ symbol), the ’pandemic’ peak
is absent altogether. However, on the downside, the so-called ’herd immunity’ slowly develops
over time.

Comparison with data: We stress that the model assumption of a homogeneous (social) network with ’four neighbours’ is unrealistic. The knowledge of the underlying disease network
is essential to make quantitative predictions for e.g. the critical value βc of the contagiousness.
Here, we adopt a different approach: we assume that qualitative time evolution of bulk quantities such as the fraction of infected individuals is within the grasp of model scenario (ii) and
use those as fit functions to determine the model parameters such as β, p and τ by comparison
with actual data.
For this study, we used data from the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020 in the Hubei province
in China [24]. The data of the number of infected individuals show a jump at day 73 (on the
arbitrary time scale) by 40%, which is due to a change in reporting. We assume that the same
’under-reporting’ has occurred in the days before, and have corrected the data by multiplying the
number of infected (and infected+recovered) by a factor 1.4 for times t ≤ 73. Let D(t, τ, β, p)
be the fraction of the population of infected individuals as a function of time t and depending
on the parameters τ (time to develop immunity), β (contagiousness) and p seed probability to
get infected. We have calculated D(t, τ, β, p) using a N = 250 × 250 lattice. We checked that
the result is independent of the lattice size in the percentage range for the parameters relevant in

7

this study. If Dwuhei (t) quantifies the measured values for the number of infected in the Hubei
outbreak, we want to approximate these data, i.e.,
Dwuhei (t) ≈ Npop D(t − ts , τ, β, p)
with a suitable choice of the parameter Npop , ts , β and p. Since the offset of the time axis in
the Hubei data is arbitrary, we have chosen the shift ts such that the peaks of simulated data and
measures data coincide. All other parameters are treated as fit parameters. Altogether, we find
a good agreement with the data for:
Npop ≈ 68k,

ts ≈ 50,

τ ≈ 21,

β ≈ 0.48,

p ≈ 3.3% .

The model data overshoot the data in the early days of the epidemic spread, which could be
related to underreporting due to limited testing capabilities. It is interesting to observe that the
curve of the infection rate is asymmetric: the slope of the raise at the beginning is larger than the
slope of the decline after the maximum. Also, the number of infected seem to level off at a nonzero value. In the present model, this is explained as follows: with more agents being immune,
it is harder for susceptible agents to be continuously infected for time greater or equal τ and,
thus, to develop immunity. We also find that only about 30% of the infected (and recovered)
develop an immunity.

Conclusions and interpretations: A new type of stochastic disease model is proposed: agents
can recover from an infection and are susceptible again. They only develop immunity if their
infection lasts longer than a characteristic time τ . For τ → ∞, the infection rate is described by
statistical field theory. For finite τ , the infection rate of the field theory provides an upper bound
of the infection rate of the dynamical model. This opens up the possibility to characterise the
disease dynamics in the light of critical phenomena of the underlying field theory: a pandemic
8

spread corresponds to the ordered phase of the field theory, and the critical value for the contagiousness is that for the phase transition. The disease is in controllable response mode if the
corresponding field theory is in the disordered phase.
Quantitative results, reported here, are derived with an unrealistic homogeneous disease
network for which each agent interacts with four neighbours. Nevertheless, we find that the
Covid19 data of the Hubei outbreak are well represented. For this case, we find that only 30%
of infected develop an immunity.
The heavy tail of the decline of the number of infected, which levels off at non-zero values, is
an inherent feature of the model and can be traced back to the fact that agents can be reinfected.
In a network with a sizeable portion of immune agents, it is increasingly challenging to develop
immunity. If these model assumptions were underpinned by medical investigations, achieving
’herd immunity’ would be difficult. This should influence the decision to what extent efforts
focus on developing a cure or a vaccine.
