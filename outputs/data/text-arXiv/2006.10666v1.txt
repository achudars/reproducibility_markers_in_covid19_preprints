ABSTRACT
Mathematical modeling of epidemic spreading has been widely adopted to estimate the
threats of epidemic diseases (i.e., the COVID-19 pandemic) as well as to evaluate epidemic
control interventions. The indoor place is considered to be a significant epidemic spreading
risk origin, but existing widely-used epidemic spreading models are usually limited for
indoor places since the dynamic physical distance changes between people are ignored,
and the empirical features of the essential and non-essential travel are not differentiated. In
this paper, we introduce a pedestrian-based epidemic spreading model that is capable of
modeling indoor transmission risks of diseases during people’s social activities. Taking
advantage of the before-and-after mobility data from the University of Maryland COVID19 Impact Analysis Platform, it’s found that people tend to spend more time in grocery
1

stores once their travel frequencies are restricted to a low level. In other words, an increase
in dwell time could balance the decrease in travel frequencies and satisfy people’s demand.
Based on the pedestrian-based model and the empirical evidence, combined nonpharmaceutical interventions from different operational levels are evaluated. Numerical
simulations show that restrictions on people’s travel frequency and open-hours of indoor
places may not be universally effective in reducing average infection risks for each
pedestrian who visit the place. Entry limitations can be a widely effective alternative,
whereas the decision-maker needs to balance the decrease in risky contacts and the increase
in queue length outside the place that may impede people from fulfilling their travel needs.
Key words: epidemic spreading, pedestrian dynamics, travel demand
1. Introduction
Epidemic diseases are public enemies of human beings. With the capability of
transmission among the human population, epidemic diseases have taken many more lives
than all armed conflicts during the last century (Adda, 2016). Although modern medical
science has significantly increased the survival chance of an individual patient, the
epidemics of stubborn viruses, such as SARS, H1N1, and the newly emerging COVID-19,
still raise great public concerns. For instance, the fast-global spread of COVID-19 in the
year 2020 drags down medical systems in many countries by quickly depleting limited
medical resources (i.e., beds, medical staff, and medicine), and thereby many patients have
to rely on self-immunity. Moreover, the pandemic and the accompanying measures (e.g.
lock-down policy) also raise negative influences on the productivity, cause significant
social costs (Almond, 2006), and even shock the global financial market and social
economy1. Consequently, it is of great importance to block or at least slow down the spread
of epidemics.
The protracted war between humans and diseases can involve multiple disciplines,
such as medical science, social science, and transportation science. This is because the
transmission of an epidemic disease among the human population has a complex
mechanism related to various factors, including the contagiousness of the virus, physical
contacts between individuals, the medical or social prevention strategies, and so on. In the
era of social networks and globalization, the control and prevention of epidemics can be
ever more challenging. Namely, advanced transportation infrastructure and convenient
mobility services can send a person to anywhere within the human society, leading to fast
city-to-city and even country-to-country disease transmission. Diverse social activities (i.e.,
from community activities, such as parties, to city-wide activities, such as working and
shopping, then to international activities, such as the Olympics) cause more frequent mass
gatherings, and thereby increase the chance of physical contacts between infected
individuals and susceptible individuals. Recent empirical studies have illustrated the
positive relationship between epidemic spreading and modern transportation, such as

airlines (Olsen et al., 2003) and railways (Adda, 2016), as well as the breakout of epidemics
due to social activities (Alzeer, 2009; Khan et al., 2010).
Given the complex transmission process and the importance of epidemic control
and prevention, researchers have developed mathematical epidemiology to depict the
spread of epidemics through a plethora of factors. At the macroscopic level, researchers
focus on the infection and recovery process of disease among the population. Aggregate
social and medical-related factors such as population infection and recovery rate, longdistance travel rate, and age distribution are usually used for building mathematical
formulations to model epidemic spreading dynamics (Earn, 2008). Although the
macroscopic models established the research discipline of mathematical epidemiology, it
may ignore details in modeling the social interactions among individuals. For instance, the
models cannot describe the spreading dynamics within or between small communities.
Therefore, macroscopic approaches can be insensitive in evaluating epidemic control
strategies, or they may require strong assumptions to overcome the incapability. The
limitations were partially addressed by activity-based models that estimate individual-level
temporal-spatial travels related to social activities in a city or a small community (Eubank
et al., 2004). The existing models are helpful but still have two shortcomings. Firstly, they
are imperfect to describe the epidemic spreading process with time-varying individual
physical distances during pedestrian movements. With cities getting increasingly crowded,
the mass gathering can exist everywhere and raise heated concerns for epidemic spreading
(Khan et al., 2012). In this manner, the capability of modeling pedestrian-level epidemic
spreading is indispensable. Secondly, the empirical features of essential and non-essential
travel are usually not discussed and differentiated. Even though non-pharmaceutical
interventions can restrict the number of social activities, they could lead to side-effects
such as increasing average indoor dwell times as well as exposure time to infected
pedestrians, especially for the essential travel demand. To this end, the features of essential
travel demand should be incorporated in the design of non-pharmaceutical interventions.
Nowadays, with the fast development of computational technologies and
individual-level location sensors, pedestrian dynamics are more preferable in describing
individual decisions and actions in mass gathering scenarios. By integrating pedestrian
dynamics with mathematical epidemiology, researchers can model the spread of epidemics
in certain places at the microscopic level, such as a railway station and a restaurant.
Thereby, a variety of non-pharmaceutical interventions related to crowed movements can
be evaluated, such as restricting the open-hours, restricting the number of entries into
places, or dividing and redirecting of the pedestrian flow. In this paper, we introduce a
pedestrian-based epidemic spreading model to ascertain the transmission risk of epidemics
in a general indoor place and evaluate the performance of combined non-pharmaceutical
interventions from different operational levels (i.e., population-level and indoor-level)
according to the practical travel demand. With realistic before-and-after mobility data from
the University of Maryland (UMD) COVID-19 Impact Analysis Platform (IAP), the travel
pattern changes during the pandemic can be analyzed using people’s number of visits,
duration of the visits, and arrival times to indoor places.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a literature
review on the state-of-the-art macroscopic and microscopic (i.e., activity-based and
pedestrian-based) approaches in mathematical epidemiology. Section 3 introduces the
pedestrian-based epidemic spreading model adopted in this paper. In Section 4, we analyze
people’s travel pattern changes before and during the COVID-19 pandemic based on the
UMD COVID-19 IAP. With the pedestrian-based epidemic spreading model and the
empirical analysis, we evaluate the indoor transmission risk for both baseline scenarios and
the scenarios with combined non-pharmaceutical interventions. Finally, conclusions and
future work are drawn in Section 6.
2. Literature review
Mathematical epidemiology modeling started in the 1900s when Hamer (1906)
introduced a discrete-time model to analyze the recurrence of measles epidemics. Later on,
Ross (1910) developed differential equation models for the prediction and control of
malaria. Inspired by early work, the well-known susceptible–infected–recovered (SIR)
model was developed (Kermack and McKendrick, 1927). The SIR model provides a
foundation for aggregate mathematical epidemiology. The basic idea is to simplify the
complex disease spreading process by the relationship among a few aggregate factors: the
number of people who are susceptible to be infected 𝑆(𝑡), the number of infectors who
spreads the disease 𝐼(𝑡), the number of recovery people who will not be infected again
𝑅(𝑡), the transmission rate 𝛽, and the recovery rate 𝛼, wherein 𝑡 denotes time (Kermack
and McKendrick, 1927). Nonlinear ordinary differential equations are used to depict the
SIR dynamics of epidemic diseases in the population2. The SIR model was extended to
various differential equation-based models, including the susceptible–infected–recovered–
susceptible (SIRS) model (Hethcote, 1976), the susceptible–exposed–infected–recovered
(SEIR) model (Liu et al., 1987), the immunity–susceptible–exposed–infected–recovered
(MSEIR) model (Schuette, 2003), structural population-based SIR model (Cross et al.,
2007), and the stochastic SEIR model (Black and McKane, 2010). Based on key threshold
quantities, such as basic reproduction ratio (usually denoted as 𝑅0 ) (Diekmann et al., 1990)
and contact number (Hethcote, 1976), researchers attempted to obtain the stationary
condition in the epidemic spreading process. The aggregate models contribute to the design
and analysis of macroscopic disease control strategies. However, one comment limitation
is that they extremely simplify the disease transmission process (Hethcote, 2009).
Since the spreading of an epidemic is largely related to people’s social activities,
individual-level disease transmission study has become a key component in mathematical
epidemiology. Microscopic modeling of the disease spreading process began with the
improvement of computational power and simulation-based technologies. Kleczkowsi and
Grenfell (1999) simulated the socio-geographical spread of diseases based on the cellular

automata approach. By assuming that each person has a small social-network, Eubank et
al. (2004) adopted bipartite graphs to model people’s contact patterns in the city and
analyzed the spread and control of smallpox. The authors generated population and the
social network based on socioeconomic data and shown the advantages of microscopic
simulations in reproducing real-world scenarios. Several microscopic epidemic spreading
models were developed, such as cell-based models (Karl et al., 2014), social-networkbased models (Milne et al., 2008), and space-time activity-based models (Yang and
Atkinson, 2008). These models simulate contacts between individuals during social
activities and estimate the transmissions based on predefined parameters such as infectious
distance and transmission rate.
It is undeniable that these macroscopic and microscopic models are capable of
evaluating medium-to-large scale epidemic control strategies, including school closure
(Milne et al., 2008), household quarantine (Longini et al., 2005), case isolation (Ferguson
et al., 2006), antiviral prophylaxis (Rizzo et al., 2008), travel restrictions (Epstein et al.,
2007), vaccination (Carrat et al., 2006), and their combinations (Nuno et al., 2007).
Although the results indicated that the combination of activity restriction strategies is
significantly effective in delaying the peaks and reducing the number of total infected
people, they might be less sound in two ways. First, the aforementioned studies ignored
the differences between people’s non-essential travel demand and essential travel demand
for economic and living activities, such that people need to work and shop to maintain
basic living requirements. Second, they may not be sensitive to the effect of people’s
physical movements on disease transmission in specific indoor places, such as in a hospital,
a restaurant, and a cruise.
Pedestrian-based epidemic spreading models, which examine person-to-person
disease transmission dynamics leveraging pedestrian crowd movements, are well fit for the
aforementioned limitations of macroscopic and activity-based microscopic models. With
the capability of modeling time-varying movements of individuals, pedestrian dynamics
have been utilized in various disciplines, such as walking facility design (Helbing et al.,
2005, Qu et al. 2014), hub network optimization (Gao et al., 2014; Hanseler et al., 2020),
mass activity organization (Hoogendoorn et al., 2004; Alnaulsi et al. 2014), and crowd
emergency evacuation (Helbing et al., 2000; Zheng et al., 2017). Pedestrian dynamics
started to attract attention in the field of mathematical epidemiology from the last decade.
It has been shown that the simulation of crowd pedestrian movements can result in the
same aggregate epidemic spreading patterns compared with macroscopic models
(Johansson et al., 2012). To the best of our knowledge, the investigations of epidemic
spreading from the microscopic pedestrian movement perspective are insufficient, and
most of them focused on some specific situations, such as air travel (Namilae et al., 2017)
and cruise (Fang et al., 2020). The integration between pedestrian dynamics and
epidemiology is still getting heated, and it will refine our understanding of the spread and
control of epidemics (Johansson and Goscè, 2014). In this paper, we attempt to provide
perspectives on pedestrian-based epidemic spreading models by simulating various
combined non-pharmaceutical interventions in a general indoor place.

3. Pedestrian-based epidemic spreading model
The proposed pedestrian-based microscopic model calculates the infection
probabilities based on a person-to-person disease transmission mechanism. There are two
parts in the microscopic model, which are respectively the pedestrian movement module
and the disease transmission risk module. The former module reproduces the general
pedestrian crowd movement in public indoor places, while the latter module describes the
disease transmission risk from an infector to the susceptible individuals. We provide
detailed formulas for the two modules in this section.
3.1 Pedestrian dynamics
The social force model (Helbing et al., 1995, 2000; Gayathri et al., 2017) is one of
the most popular methods in reproducing pedestrian crowd movements, and it has been
successfully applied as the fundamental model of microscopic pedestrian crowd
simulations in commercial software, such as PTV Vissim and MassMotion3. The social
force model is applied for the simulation of pedestrian dynamics, in which a pedestrian is
regarded as an object affected by several forces from goal, neighbors, and obstacles,
𝑝𝑒𝑑
𝑜𝑏𝑠
𝑭𝑖 (𝑡) = 𝑭𝑑𝑟𝑣
𝑖 (𝑡) + ∑ 𝑭𝑖,𝑗 (𝑡) + ∑ 𝑭𝑖,𝑤 (𝑡)
𝑗

𝑤

(1)

where 𝑭𝑖 (𝑡) is a two-dimensional vector that represents the resultant of all the external
forces of pedestrian 𝑖 at time 𝑡. For the remaining of this paper, we adopt bold notations
for vectors. The three components of 𝑭𝑖 (𝑡) are explained as follows.
Firstly, 𝑭𝑑𝑟𝑣
𝑖 (𝑡) indicates the attraction force to the goal at time 𝑡, and it reflects the
desire of pedestrian 𝑖 (with a mass of 𝑚𝑖 ) to maintain a certain walking speed 𝑣𝑖0 towards
certain direction 𝒆0𝑖 in a relaxation time 𝜏𝑖 . Let 𝑣𝑖 (𝑡) and 𝒆𝑖 (𝑡) represent the instant speed
and unit direction vector respectively, the formulation of 𝑭𝑑𝑟𝑣
𝑖 (𝑡) is given by:
𝑭𝑑𝑟𝑣
𝑖 (𝑡) = 𝑚𝑖

𝑣𝑖0 𝒆0𝑖 − 𝑣𝑖 (𝑡)𝒆𝑖 (𝑡)
𝜏𝑖

(2)

Here 𝑣𝑖0 and 𝑣𝑖 (𝑡) are non-negative real numbers, and 𝒆0𝑖 and 𝒆𝑖 (𝑡) are two-dimensional
unit direction vectors which can be represented by (cos𝜃, sin 𝜃), 𝜃 ∈ 𝑈(0, 2𝜋).
Secondly, 𝑭𝑝𝑒𝑑
𝑖,𝑗 (𝑡) indicates the interaction force between the objective pedestrian
𝑖 and the neighboring pedestrian 𝑗. Generally, it is a repulsive force and comes in two parts,

the social force on the psychological level and the contact force on the physical level
(shown in Eq. (3)).
𝑟𝑖 + 𝑟𝑗 − 𝑑𝑖,𝑗 (𝑡)
𝑭𝑝𝑒𝑑
) + 𝐶𝑔 (𝑟𝑖 + 𝑟𝑗 − 𝑑𝑖,𝑗 (𝑡))} 𝒏𝑖,𝑗 (𝑡)
𝑖,𝑗 (𝑡) = {𝐴 𝑒𝑥𝑝 (
𝐵

(3)

where 𝑟𝑖 , 𝑟𝑗 and 𝑑𝑖,𝑗 (𝑡) = ||𝒍𝑖 (𝑡) − 𝒍𝑗 (𝑡)|| represent the radius of pedestrian 𝑖, 𝑗 and the
instant distance between the centers of both pedestrians (𝒍𝑖 (𝑡) and 𝒍𝑗 (𝑡) denotes the instant
location, i.e., coordinates, of the two pedestrians). 𝐴, 𝐵 and 𝐶 are parameters, and 𝐴 is
2000 newtons, 𝐵 equals 0.08 meters, and 𝐶 equals 120000 kilogram per second squared,
𝒏𝑖,𝑗 (𝑡) denotes the unit direction vector from pedestrian 𝑗 to pedestrian 𝑖 at time 𝑡. And
𝑔(𝑥) is a function that does not equal zero only if the pedestrians are touched,
𝑥, if 𝑥 > 0
𝑔(𝑥) = {0,
otherwise

(4)

Thirdly, 𝑭𝑜𝑏𝑠
𝑖,𝑤 (𝑡) indicates the instant interaction force between the objective
pedestrian 𝑖 and the wall/obstacle 𝑤, as presented in Eq. (5).
𝑟𝑖 −𝑑𝑖,𝑤 (𝑡)

𝑭𝑜𝑏𝑠
𝑖,𝑤 (𝑡) = {𝐴 exp (

𝐵

) + 𝐶𝑔 (𝑟𝑖 − 𝑑𝑖,𝑤 (𝑡))} 𝒏𝑖,𝑤 (𝑡),

(5)

where, similar to Eq. (3), 𝑑𝑖,𝑤 (𝑡) represents the instant distance to the obstacle 𝑤, and
𝒏𝑖,𝑤 (𝑡) denotes the instant direction from the wall/obstacle 𝑤 to the pedestrian 𝑖.
Accordingly, the motion of the pedestrian is driven under Newton’s second law
with a second-order dynamics function (Moussaid et al. 2011), and the velocity of
pedestrian 𝑖 is determined as,
𝑑𝑣𝑖 (𝑡)𝒆𝑖 (𝑡) 𝑭𝑖 (𝑡)
=
𝑑𝑡
𝑚𝑖

(6)

and the location 𝒍𝑖 (𝑡) of pedestrian 𝑖 is determined as
𝑑𝒍𝑖 (𝑡)
= 𝑣𝑖 (𝑡)𝒆𝑖 (𝑡)
𝑑𝑡

(7)

Furthermore, a random walking process is formulated through the adjustment of
the original desired direction 𝒆0𝑖 to simulate the crowd movements in a space with
boundaries (i.e., indoor place). In our model, the pedestrian is needed to change the original
desired direction when he/she is closely approaching the boundary. Suppose one pedestrian
with a desired direction 𝒆0𝑖 = (𝑐𝑜𝑠𝜃, 𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜃) is going to hit the boundary, and the unit normal
direction vector of the boundary is 𝒆𝑏𝑖 = (cos𝜃 𝑏 , sin 𝜃 𝑏 ) . Then the model will force
him/her to change the direction, and the new desired direction is arbitrarily obtained as,

7

𝒆0𝑖 ∈ {(cos𝜃 ′ , sin 𝜃 ′ )|𝜃 ′ ∈ 𝑈(0, 2𝜋), cos𝜃 ′ cos𝜃 𝑏 + sin 𝜃 ′ sin 𝜃 𝑏 < 0}

(8)

Note that the new desired direction of pedestrian 𝑖 is required to be any direction that is
away from hitting the boundary.
3.2 The risk of epidemic spreading
In this subsection, the risk of epidemic spreading is calculated based on a
microscopic person-to-person transmission mechanism. According to the current
investigation on COVID-19 (World Health Organization, 2020), the route of person-toperson transmission of this disease is via respiratory droplets; and close contacts with
someone who has sneezing, coughing, or other respiratory symptoms can put a person on
a high risk of being infected. WHO suggested that anyone who has face-to-face contacts
with a probable or confirmed case within 1 meter for over 15 minutes, or who has direct
physical contacts with a probable or confirmed case shall be identified as a close contact.
Also, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) believes that maintaining
good social distance (6 feet, which is about 1.8 meters) is important in preventing the
spread of COVID-19. Consequently, the exposure time in the infection area is regarded as
a core index to indicate the transmission risk of epidemics.
In our model, both getting close to infected individuals and locating in the coughing
area would cause potential risk on epidemic spreading, and the general exposed time 𝑇𝑖 of
pedestrian 𝑖 is calculated by accumulating the contact exposed time 𝑇𝑖𝑐𝑡 and the cough
𝑐𝑔
exposed 𝑇𝑖 , such that
𝑐𝑔

𝑇𝑖 = 𝑇𝑖𝑐𝑡 + 𝑇𝑖

(9)

The first term, i.e., contact exposed time 𝑇𝑖𝑐𝑡 , it is calculated by directly summing
up the physical contacts between the target pedestrian and every infected individual in the
place (shown in Eq. (10)).
𝑇𝑖𝑐𝑡 =

𝑡𝑖𝑒𝑥𝑖𝑡

𝑀(𝑡)

∑

∑ 𝜆𝑖,𝑚 (𝑡)

(10)

𝑡=𝑡𝑖𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟 𝑚=1

where 𝑡𝑖𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟 and 𝑡𝑖𝑒𝑥𝑖𝑡 respectively denotes the place enter time and exit time of pedestrian
𝑖, and 𝑀(𝑡) indicates the number of infected pedestrians in the place at time 𝑡. 𝜆𝑖,𝑚 (𝑡)
indicates the status of whether pedestrian 𝑖 is exposed in the influence area of infected
pedestrian 𝑚, and it is obtained as,
𝜆𝑖,𝑚 (𝑡) = {

1, if 𝑑𝑖,𝑚 (𝑡) ≤ 𝐷𝑐 − 𝑟𝑚
0,
otherwise

8

(11)

where 𝐷𝑐 indicates the cut-off distance of the infector influence area, and 𝑑𝑖,𝑚 (𝑡)
represents the instant distance between the centers of pedestrian 𝑖 and infected pedestrian
𝑚.
Compared with the contact infection, the transmission through coughing usually
has a great influence area but a shorter existence time. Suppose the influence area of
coughing is a circle area with the center to be the coughing individual, the second term, i.e.,
𝑐𝑔
cough exposed time 𝑇𝑖 , it is calculated as follows,
𝑐𝑔

𝑇𝑖

=

𝑡𝑖𝑒𝑥𝑖𝑡

𝑁(𝑡)

∑

∑ 𝜇𝑖,𝑛 (𝑡)

(12)

𝑡=𝑡𝑖𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟 𝑛=1

where 𝑁(𝑡) indicates the number of existing coughing areas (i.e., number of infected
individuals who are coughing) in the place at time 𝑡 , and 𝜇𝑖,𝑛 (𝑡) indicates the status
whether pedestrian 𝑖 is exposed in the influence area of coughing area 𝑛, and it is obtained
as,
1, if 𝑑𝑖,𝑛 (𝑡) ≤ 𝑅𝑛
𝜇𝑖,𝑛 (𝑡) = {
0, otherwise

(13)

where 𝑑𝑖,𝑛 (𝑡) indicates the distance from the pedestrian 𝑖 to the center of coughing area 𝑛,
and 𝑅𝑛 is the radius of the coughing area (i.e., also referred to as mean coughing distance).

4. Travel demand analysis based on UMD COVID-19 IAP
The research team utilizes mobility data from the UMD COVID-19 IAP4 (Zhang et
al., 2020(a)). The platform aggregates mobile device location data from more than 100
million anonymized monthly active users across the United States on a daily basis. Figure
1 illustrates the observed mobility changes during the COVID-19 pandemic5 using UMD
COVID-19 IAP. Before the National Emergency declaration on Marth 13th, the number of
trips per person was stable and high; while, after the declaration, the number of trips per
person first dramatically dropped (March 13th - March 22nd, 2020) and then maintained at
a low level (after March 22nd).

See our website https://data.covid.umd.edu for more details.
Detailed methodology related to data processing and plotting can be found in Zhang et al. (2020(b)).
Moreover, The U.S. government proclaimed a national state of emergency on March 13th, 2020. And by April
10th, only 8 states had not issued “Stay-at-home” orders (Xiong et al. 2020).

Figure 1. Observed mobility changes using UMD COVID-19 IAP
Based on 56 days of mobile device location data (March 1st - April 26th, 2020), we
analyze the travel demand with respect to daily mean dwell time and the number of visits
for grocery shopping in Figure 26. The daily data points illustrate notable distinctive travel
patterns, which can be grouped into two clusters. The first cluster (blue points) refers to
the mobility data before March 22nd, about three days after the state of California issued
the “stay-at-home” order. In this cluster, the number of daily visits has a negligible impact
on the mean dwell time. While, in the second cluster (red points, refers to the mobility data
after March 22nd), we find a significant negative relationship between dwell time and the
number of visits. Two regression curves for the two clusters are given in Figure 2, and
comparing a non-clustering regression with the clustering-based regression, the R-Squared
value increases from 0.124 to 0.527. The clustered travel pattern indicates insightful travel
behavior findings, which are summarized below.
•
•

•

•

The number of visits notably drops as people receive the government’s call and
perceive the high transmission risk of COVID-19 during their travel activities.
For grocery shopping trips, since the two travel patterns can be classified mainly
by the number of visits, there exists a specific visiting number that is regarded as
the watershed of travel demand.
Once the number of visits is above the watershed, the grocery visits consist of both
essential shopping activities for basic living requirements and non-essential
shopping activities, such that restrictions on travel frequency would not hurt
people’s essential travel demand.
Once the number of visits is below the watershed, the grocery visits only consist of
essential shopping activities, and as the government further restrict people’s travel
activities, visitors tend to shop longer to fulfill their living requirements.

6

The location data is classified by the attribute of the place, such as grocery stores, pharmacy stores,
restaurants, etc. We focus on grocery shopping because it is closely related to people’s essential travel
demand.

10

Figure 2. Daily mean dwell time versus number of visits
Besides the “stay-at-home” order, most grocery stores adopt an early closure policy.
For instance, Walmart U.S. stores adjusted its operating hours to 7:00 to 20:30 during the
COVID-19 pandemic 7 . Based on the aforementioned mobility data, we summarize the
distributions of customer arrival times for days before many stores implemented early
closure policies (i.e., Match 24th is selected as the watershed date) and days after early
closure policies. The before-and-after customer arrival patterns are depicted in Figure 3, in
which we observe notable shifts of the peak period beginning time from around 16:00 (red)
to around 13:00 (blue). Consequently, we claim that an early closure will lead to earlier
and wider peak periods, which is referred to as a peak spreading phenomenon.

Figure 3. Arrival time distribution
The conclusions in the travel demand analysis provide us a solid behavior
foundation in designing non-pharmaceutical interventions. That is, if the government
would like to further restrict people’s travel, it should expect an increase in average dwell
time and the underlying transmission risk for the visitors who have to conduct an essential
trip. And store managers need to concern the peak spreading phenomenon while
implementing an open-hours restriction policy.

5. Estimating indoor transmission risks of COVID-19
Plenty of approaches have been successfully applied in simulating the infectious
disease transmission through the macroscopic perspectives and activity-based microscopic
perspectives. However, to the best of our knowledge, very few approaches have been used
to investigate the performance of different non-pharmaceutical interventions in general
indoor places. A critical reason shall be that people seldom meet disease that has both a
long period of incubation and strong infectious ability, like the emerging COVID-19. Due
to the worldwide pandemic of COVID-19, lock-down policies are adopted by numerous
countries and the residents are suggested to stay at home as long as possible. These policies
would lead to a sharp descend of mass gathering in public places, and the disease spreading
by contact or droplet spreading should also reduce. Nevertheless, it cannot be ignored that
there is still a demand for the essential travels even in the pandemic, e.g., buying necessities
and seeking medical treatment. Besides, the coronavirus can exist for quite a long time
among human beings considering the overall trend of the pandemic fact, and more demands
for public places would emerge not only from the perspective of the economy but also from
that of human nature. Therefore, understand the transmission risk in public indoor places
and figure out what is the optimal non-pharmaceutical interventions are quite significant.
In this section, a general indoor place is adopted to study the transmission risk and
potential influence of non-pharmaceutical interventions based on crowd dynamics
simulation. Section 5.1 describes the basic simulation settings and the performance
measures of indoor transmission risk. Section 5.2 evaluates the transmission risks of the
real-world scenarios obtained from the UMD COVID-19 IAP, which are referred to as
baseline scenarios. In Section 5.3, we estimate the performance of combined nonpharmaceutical interventions from different operational levels and investigate the optimal
strategy that could further slow down the spread of COVID-19.
5.1 Basic simulation settings
The practical place settings vary according to different places, and one specific
setting might affect virus transmission risks. For instance, a restaurant has sitting tables,
and a shopping center has shop units (absorbing spots). However, focusing on the specific
setting is not necessary for this paper. This is because it is unlikely to include all types of
indoor geometries in the study, and it is less significant than some other parameters, e.g.,
area and the spatial distribution of pedestrians. Here, we introduce a public indoor place
with a 40 × 30 squared meter room but no obstacles inside, and the pedestrians would freely
walk inside the place. Each pedestrian is represented by a circle of 0.2 meters (i.e., 𝑟𝑖 = 0.1
meters,) and the relaxation time 𝜏 and the desired speed 𝑣𝑖0 are 0.5 seconds and 1.34 meter
per second, respectively 8 . The infection rate of the residents is set to be 0.5% in the
8

It is noticed that the practical walking speeds for different places can be unequal. For instance, people
usually sit at a fixed position in the restaurant, but when it is a supermarket or a stadium they will generally
keep walking or even running. However, it is found that the speed in simulation is not a decisive factor for
the total infection time (see appendix A, and total infection time is defined in Eq. (14)).

simulation, i.e., 0.5% of the pedestrians are infected with COVID-19. It is supposed that
these people will infect others through contact and cough approaches. For the contact
approach, the cut-off distance for the exposure 𝐷𝑐 is 1 meter according to the suggestion
of WHO (World Health Organization, 2020). For the cough approach, an infected
pedestrian is supposed to have a cough every 15 seconds. By referring to the mean
coughing distance among the volunteers in (Loh et al., 2020), 𝑅𝑛 is set to be 2.5 meters,
and the infectious time of coughing averagely lasts for 15 seconds and 5 seconds in indoor
places and out-of-door areas, respectively. The exposure time of each people inside the
contact and the cough infection area can be calculated via Eqs. (9) – (13).
The epidemic spreading process is illustrated in Figure 4. The red, orange, and
green dots represent the infected people, the exposed susceptible people, and the unexposed
health people, respectively. The yellow area indicates the influence area of both contact
and coughing.

Figure 4. Sketch map of pedestrian-based epidemic spreading process.
To quantify the indoor transmission risk of epidemics, the exposed time of a
susceptible individual (i.e., 𝑇𝑖 defined in Eq. (9)) is calculated. Two critical measurements
are calculated based on 𝑇𝑖 : the total infection time and the number of high-risk exposed
people. The total infection time 𝑇 𝑖𝑛𝑓 is the summation of exposed time for all the
susceptible individuals who have visited in the general indoor place.
𝑇 𝑖𝑛𝑓 = ∑ 𝑇𝑖
𝑖

(14)

The number of high-risk exposed people 𝐶 𝑟𝑖𝑠𝑘 refers to the number of individuals whose
exposure time is over 𝑇̅ during the visit.
𝐶 𝑟𝑖𝑠𝑘 = ∑ 𝜙(𝑇𝑖 ),

where 𝜙(𝑇𝑖 ) is calculated as,

and we assume 𝑇̅ to be 20 seconds in this paper9.
5.2 Evaluation of baseline scenarios
Based on the travel demand analysis in Section 4, we consider three baseline
scenarios as real-world benchmarks and estimate the corresponding indoor transmission
risks. Firstly, we utilize a “before” scenario to represent the situation before the US
government announced the national emergency. From the mobility data, we select a general
day representing scenario “before” and assume 8000 visitors are coming to the public place
during the open-hours (i.e., 7:00 to 22:00); the dwell time of the visitors is around 25.9
minutes (point ‘b’ in Figure 2). Secondly, an “intermediate” scenario is adopted to
represent the situation when people have reduced non-essential trips to some extent, but
the total number of visits is still above the watershed of people’s travel demand. For
scenario “intermediate”, we assume that 7000 pedestrians visit the place and their dwell
time is 25.8 minutes (point ‘i’ in Figure 2). In both scenarios “before” and “intermediate”,
we assume the early closure policy is not implemented and the arrival times of pedestrians
follow the red bar histogram in Figure 3. Thirdly, we use an “after” scenario to represent
the real-world condition with restrictive self-shielding and early closure policies, and
people’s essential demand is hurt. The total number of visits and the average dwell time is
4800 and 27.4 minutes respectively, which comes from the medium condition (i.e., point
‘a’) of the red cluster in Figure 210. Due to the implementation of the early closure policy
(i.e., from 7:00 to 20:30), the arrival times will follow the blue bar histogram in Figure 3.
Note that if the arrival times of some pedestrians are nearby the closing time, we allow
them to finish their planned dwell time.
Figure 5 depicts the indoor transmission risks under the three baseline scenarios.
The total infection time (𝑇 𝑖𝑛𝑓 , red bars) and number of high-risk exposed pedestrians (𝐶 𝑟𝑖𝑠𝑘 ,
blue bars) are shown in Figure 5(a), while the average infection time (
the high-risk ratio (

𝐶 𝑟𝑖𝑠𝑘
𝐼

𝑇 𝑖𝑛𝑓
𝐼

, red bars) and

× 100% , blue bars) are illustrated in Figure 5(b), wherein 𝐼

denotes the number of visits. Comparing the scenarios, we find that both the total and the
pedestrian average transmission risk will significantly decrease as people reduce their
travel frequencies (i.e., measured by the number of visits). Although the dwell time
increase from scenario “intermediate” to scenario “after”, the average risk for an individual

9

An exposed time of over 20 seconds is risky because the infected individual may have infective actions
(e.g., coughs and talks) by chance and transmit virus to the susceptible individual.
10
Note that the exact values of the data points in Figure 2 stand for the aggregate data of numerous grocery
stores, which might not reflect the number of visits for one indoor place. To make a general case study, we
assume a constant scaler of 0.01, such that the point with 800000 visits in Figure 2 represents the “before”
scenario with 8000 visits to the general indoor place. Similarly, the “intermediate” and “after” scenarios are
denoted by points with 700000 and 480000 visits in Figure 2, respectively.

pedestrian in the place still becomes lower because of a huge reduction of visits (i.e., by
around 31.4% from 7000 to 4800).

(a) Total measurements

(b) Average measurements

Figure 5. Results of the baseline scenarios
The results of the baseline scenarios imply the effect of activity restrictions on
epidemic control. Although the total indoor infection risk largely decreases, the average
infection risk is still undesirable (the average infection time is still 7.7 seconds, and the
high-risk ratio is 2.58%). It’s can’t be ignored that visitors would come from different
households, and fewer members from the same household would visit grocery stores to
reduce the risk of infections during the activity restrictions. However, according to the
current results on the average infection risk, this could still lead to infections of visitors
from various households as well as serious transmissions within the infected households
and small communities. Since this paper only cares about the indoor transmission process
of diseases (i.e., COVID-19), the infection risks at household and community levels are
out of scope. We attempt to seek good-intended combined interventions that can furtherly
slow down the indoor spreading of diseases with a small high-risk ratio.
5.3 Evaluation of combined non-pharmaceutical interventions
Regarding the baseline scenario “after” as the current real-world situation, we
explore possible pros and cons of implementing combined non-pharmaceutical
interventions from different operational levels. Three levels of interventions are proposed
and the meanings and specific parameter settings are given below:
Self-shielding policy (population-level). People are required by the government to reduce
travel frequency during the pandemic. As the number of visits is below the watershed (i.e.,
Figure 2), the dwell time of visitors will correspondingly increase to fulfill the essential
demand. Three strategies are respectively adopted: “S0” is with 6000 visitors and an
average dwell time of 24.7 minutes, “S1” is with 4800 visitors and a 27.4 minutes’ dwell
time, and “S2” has 3600 visitors whose dwell time is 30.0 minutes. The dwell times are

15

obtained based on the fitted linear relationship of the red points (i.e., essential travel
demand) in Figure 2.
Open-hours restriction policy (indoor-level). An early closure policy is implemented by
the manager of the indoor place, and it’s found that earlier and wider peak periods can be
formed according to the practical results in Figure 3. Here, two operational strategies are
considered for this policy: “O0” is without early closure and the distribution of arrival times
follow the red bars as shown in Figure 3, and the distribution of restricting strategy is
implemented in “O1” such that the arrival times follow the blue bars.
Entry limitation policy (indoor-level). The maximum number of visitors inside the indoor
place is limited by the manager to reduce the epidemic spreading risk among crowds. The
extra visitors have to wait in a queue outside the indoor place until some other visitors
leave the place, and they would maintain a physical distance of over 6 feet in the queue as
suggested by CDC. We consider two strategies: “E0” is without entry limitation, and in
“E1” the manager allows a maximum number of 150 visitors (each visitor averagely owns
8 m2 in the general indoor place) in the place simultaneously. At the closing time, visitors
who are still waiting in the queue are forced to cancel the activity.
The combined interventions are denoted by a sequence of intervention codes in the
“S-O-E” format. For instance, scenario “S0-O1-E0” represents the combination of
strategies “S0”, “O1”, and “E0” for the three operational levels. Note that the scenario “S1O1-E0” is identical to the baseline scenario “after”. Figure 6 depicts the performance of all
12 possible combinations of non-pharmaceutical interventions with respect to the total
measurements 𝑇 𝑖𝑛𝑓 and 𝐶 𝑟𝑖𝑠𝑘 (i.e., Figure 6(a)) and the average measurements
𝐶 𝑟𝑖𝑠𝑘
𝐼

𝑇 𝑖𝑛𝑓
𝐼

and

× 100% (i.e., Figure 6(b)).

(a) Total measurements

(b) Average measurements

Figure 6. Results of the combined non-pharmaceutical interventions
Through a parallel comparison of the scenarios “S0”, “S1” and “S2” which own
different number of visitors, it can be found that the total infection risk (i.e., infection time
16

and the number of high-risk pedestrians) monotonically fall with the decrease of visitor
numbers, whereas the trend is not that significant for the average infection risk (i.e., average
infection time and high-risk ratio). For instance, the average infection risk in “S1-O1-E0”
is greater than that of “S0-O1-E0”. In other words, increasing the magnitude of the selfshielding policy (i.e., further reducing people’s travel frequency) might not be effective in
decreasing individual infection risk. For the essential trips, the reduction in the number of
visits will lead to higher dwell times, and the positive and negative effects (i.e., positive
effects from fewer visits and negative effects from longer dwell times) on individual
infection risk might cancel out.
Within each self-shielding level (i.e., “S0”, “S1”, and “S2”), the restriction on openhours (i.e., “O1”) leads to the increase of transmission risk. A possible reason is considered
to be that the gathering of people during peak hours in the indoor places leads to the
growing of pedestrian density (i.e., the inverse of person-to-person distance) in the indoor
place, and the phenomenon just enhance the chance of exposure to infected pedestrians.
Thereby, the combination “O1-E0” leads to the highest transmission risk for both the total
and the average measurements.
Regarding the entry limitation policy (i.e., “E1”), it can notably slow down the
spreading of COVID-19 during grocery shopping trips with self-shielding policies “S0”
and “S1” as the number of visits is at a medium-to-high level. However, the queueing
process might last until the closing time, so that some visitors cannot enter the place to
fulfill their travel needs. Namely, 12.5%, 21.3%, 4.8%, and 13.9% of the visitors are still
queued outside the place in combinations “S0-O0-E1”, “S0-O1-E1”, “S1-O0-E1” and “S1O1-E1”, respectively. Once the number of pedestrians is low (i.e., “S2”), the effectiveness
of entry limitation is marginal (i.e., comparing “S2-O0-E0” with “S2-O0-E1”, and “S2O1-E0” with “S2-O1-E1”).
Given “S1-O1-E0” as the benchmark, decision-makers can further restrict people’s
travel frequency or implement an entry limitation policy to achieve a more reliable control
of epidemics. The results of this paper raise a missing concern in epidemic control. That is,
due to people’s essential travel demand, travel restrictions may not be universally effective
in controlling the spreading of epidemics, especially on individual infection probabilities.
An early closure might increase the indoor transmission risk, which is owning to the peak
spreading of pedestrian arrivals. Although the open-hours restriction policy might not be
effective for epidemic control in this paper, it could be a necessary concern for the place
manager to keep the employees from the disease. In cases with a medium-to-high number
of visits, entry limiting is remarkably effective, regardless of people’s essential demand
and the potential risk outside the place. While decision-makers may need to concern the
length of the queue such that the last queued people can enter the place before its closing
time. To satisfy all the stakeholders (i.e., pedestrians, the manager of the indoor place, and

17

the government officials), good coordination is needed during the implementation of
combined interventions.
6. Conclusions and Discussion
Microscopic mathematical epidemiology is becoming heatedly preferable due to its
capability of modeling community-level epidemic spread and control interventions. Most
existing microscopic models estimate the disease transmission process through the
simulation of individual social activities, but generally ignore the dynamics in physical
contacts due to pedestrian movements. Additionally, current research efforts on epidemic
control might dismiss the distinction between people’s essential and non-essential travel
demand during the implementation of activities restrictions. In this paper, we attempt to
address these research issues by utilizing a pedestrian-based epidemic spreading model
coupled with real-world travel data during the COVID-19 pandemic. The pedestrian-based
model provides a mathematical basis for estimating disease transmission risks for indoor
activities, and the dataset shows the impacts of activity restriction interventions on people’s
travel patterns concerning their essential travel demand. Based on the proposed model and
the empirical behavioral findings, the transmission risk of COVID-19 during indoor
activities for reality (i.e., before, intermediate, and after the “stay-at-home” call) and
scenarios with combined non-pharmaceutical interventions (i.e., self-shielding, open-hours
restriction, and entry limitation) can be evaluated.
Based on the before-and-after travel demand analysis, we find that people’s grocery
shopping activities consist of both essential and non-essential trips. When the government
begins to implement a self-shielding policy, people first tend to reduce non-essential trips
and the average dwell time basically remains unchanged. However, once the number of
visits is below some watershed, people will only conduct essential grocery shopping trips;
and a smaller number of visits will lead to a longer dwell time to satisfy visitors’ essential
demand (i.e., food purchase). Besides, an early closure policy could change the distribution
of arrivals and bring a peak spreading phenomenon of arrivals.
The results of the pedestrian-based indoor COVID-19 transmission simulations are
insightful. Firstly, because of the essential travel demand feature, a self-shielding policy
may not bring down individual infection risks. Secondly, from a system-level epidemic
control perspective, an open-hours restriction policy could increase the indoor transmission
risk of COVID-19 due to the aforementioned peak spreading phenomenon. Thirdly, an
entry limitation policy is effective when the number of visits is large. However, the
manager of the indoor place needs to take a balance between the number of people waiting
outside and the potential decrease in transmission risks. The balance is important because
people may need to maintain basic living requirements by entering the place. In addition,
it’s found that the performance of combined non-pharmaceutical interventions can be
improved via good coordination among the decision-makers.
There are still some limitations to the current modeling approach, which can be
fulfilled in the future. Firstly, the modeling about the pedestrian-level epidemic
18

transmission process is still not comprehensive. For instance, we haven’t considered the
heterogeneity of individuals in terms of their walking speeds and preferred social distances.
Secondly, the general place can be extended to various specific places, such as shopping
malls, hospitals, and railway stations. That is, we can model a railway station by restricting
people’s movement directions, or a shopping center by adding absorbing pots as shops.
Thirdly, the proposed model is currently not appropriate for the scenarios with different
scales, while the activity-based or macroscopic models can be further integrated to fulfill
the disease transmission dynamics in all scales.

Appendix A The impact of desired speed
In this appendix, a series of simulations with different desired speeds are presented
in an indoor place with 100 individuals (1 infected) randomly walking inside for 10 minutes.
In each simulation, the desired speeds of individuals are respectively set as a fixed value
from 0 to 1.6 meter per second. The total infection time 𝑇 𝑖𝑛𝑓 (i.e., Eq. (14)) is shown in
Figure A.1.
Through the statistics of the individual infections, it is found that the total infection
time moves around 700 seconds. It is to say, once the pedestrians are uniformly distributed
in the place, the infection time results would be approximately the same and have an
insignificant relationship with the desired speed.
