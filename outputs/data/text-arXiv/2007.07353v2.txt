Keynesian models of depression. Supply shocks and the COVID-19 Crisis.
Escañuela Romana, Ignacio1

Abstract.
The objective of this work is twofold: to expand the depression models proposed by Tobin
and analyse a supply shock, such as the Covid-19 pandemic, in this Keynesian conceptual
environment. The expansion allows us to propose the evolution of all endogenous
macroeconomic variables. The result obtained is relevant due to its theoretical and practical
implications. A quantity or Keynesian adjustment to the shock produces a depression through
the effect on aggregate demand. This depression worsens in the medium/long-term. It is
accompanied by increases in inflation, inflation expectations and the real interest rate. A
stimulus tax policy is also recommended, as well as an active monetary policy to reduce real
interest rates. On the other hand, the pricing or Marshallian adjustment foresees a more
severe and rapid depression in the short-term. There would be a reduction in inflation and
inflation expectations, and an increase in the real interest rates. The tax or monetary stimulus
measures would only impact inflation. This result makes it possible to clarify and assess the
resulting depression, as well as propose policies. Finally, it offers conflicting predictions that
allow one of the two models to be falsified.

1. Object and results.
This work expands on Tobin’s Keynesian models (1975), analyses their local stability, and
studies their evolution in the face of a supply shock (specifically, the Covid-19 pandemic).
First, an equation for the real interest rate, based on Taylor’s curve, is added. The central
bank follows the instrumental objective of the real interest rate. The local stability conditions
are studied: the introduction of the interest rate does not make the system more unstable than
Tobin’s initial system.
Second, the supply shock is modelled as a significant reduction in aggregate full employment
output (or natural level of employment). The Covid-19 pandemic is a negative supply shock
that represents a sharp drop in the production possibilities of an economy. In this case, the
production and/or sale of any service or that requires social proximity, a key factor in the
spread of the virus.
The result achieved indicates that the supply shock generates a depression. The force of this
depression, as well as the effects on prices and inflation expectations, depend crucially on the

to be empirically falsified.

If the adjustment is of the Walras-Keynes-Phillips (WKP) type (Tobin, 1975), via
quantities, then a depression is generated that evolves over time: short and longterm effects. Inflation, inflation expectations and the real interest rate rise. It is
possible to develop expansionary tax and monetary policies with effects on
aggregate demand and, consequently, on the evolution of the output (and
therefore, of unemployment or the total number of hours worked in the economy),
at the cost of increased inflation.
If the adjustment is of the Marshall (M) type (Tobin, 1975), via prices, then a
direct depression occurs, with no differences between short and long-term,
reducing inflation and inflation expectations, and increasing the real interest rate.
Expansionary tax and monetary policies are totally ineffective in countering the
drop in income. The adjustment is only via supply.

2. The models.
2.1. Conceptual bases.
This work has the following focuses:
I.
II.
III.

Macroeconomic. “Macroeconomics … deals with simplified general equilibrium
models” (De Vroey, 2004, p.2).
Holistic. In the Marshallian sense that the micro-foundation of the model may be
left in the background (De Vroey, 2016, p.340).
Keynesian2. In the sense clarified by Tobin (1993): “it does assert and require that
markets not be instantaneously and continuously cleared by prices” (p. 46). This is
the central idea: that the economic system may be in a situation of prolonged
imbalance with involuntary unemployment. Tobin (1975) develops the possibility
that deflation may deepen recessions3.

Tobin’s models consist of a single macroeconomic equilibrium (Tobin, 1993). In the
equilibrium, the economy would be in full employment and in the natural rate of
unemployment, with constant prices and expectations.
Tobin (1975) starts from the consideration made by Friedman (1971, p. 18): Keynes
“assumed that, at least for changes in aggregate demand, quantity was the variable that
adjusted rapidly, while price was the variable that adjusted slowly, at least in a downward
direction”. From here, he proposes two general macro-equilibrium models. The first model is
based on the quantity or Keynesian adjustment (the Tobin I model). The second model is the

“The possibility of protracted unemployment which the natural adjustment of a market economy remedy
very slowly if at all” (Tobin, 1975, p. 196).

Marshall adjustment (the Tobin II model). Here, the classical dichotomy is valid4, monetary
variables are totally independent from real ones, and conversely.
The Tobin I model: the difference between aggregate demand and aggregate supply impacts
the income growth rate. Consequently, insufficient demand causes a drop in output
(adjustment of quantities). The difference between aggregate production and its level of full
employment has effects on the inflation rate.
The Tobin II model: the difference between the level of aggregate full employment
production and the effective output generates the income growth rate. Moreover, the distance
between aggregate demand and real production impacts the level of inflation. Insufficient
demand causes a drop in prices (adjustment of prices).
In model I, the recessions are the result of insufficient effective demand. In model II, they are
the result of an aggregate production that is higher than the potential.
Both models lacked an interest rate equation. However, the interest rate is an endogenous
variable that is determined within the system. The model is completed by adding it. To do
this, an abbreviated Taylor equation is taken. This results in two models: the expanded Tobin
I model (TMIA) and the expanded Tobin II model (TMIIA).

2.2. Aggregate demand.
This starts from the definition of aggregate demand (Tobin, 1975).
𝐸 = 𝐶 (𝑌+ , 𝑌+∗ , 𝑇− , 𝑟− ,

𝑥𝑀
𝑃 +

, 𝑊+ ) + 𝐼(𝑌+ , 𝑌+∗ , 𝐾− , 𝑅− ) + 𝐺

(1)

E is aggregate real effective demand, Y is aggregate real output (income), Y* is its value at
full employment, T is taxes minus transfers, r is real interest rate, M is nominal stock of
outside money, p or price level, x or expected rate of change of price level, W is private
wealth, K or capital stock, G is public spending. Assumed closed economy for simplification.
𝑊=

𝑀
𝑝

+ 𝑞𝐾

(2)

Tobin’s q is “the ratio of market valuation of capital equity to replacement cost” (op. cit., p.
197). q falls if r rises relative to the marginal efficiency of capital. This efficiency depends
positively on Y and Y*, negatively on K.
a. Price level effect (Ep) is negative. On the one hand, Keynes effect: decreasing prices
mean larger real money quantity. On the other hand, Pigou effect: higher the real
value of private wealth.
b. Ex is positive, since a rise in inflation expectations decreases the real interest rate
(Tobin-Mundell effect)5.
c. Ey is greater than 0 but less than 1.

Mankiw (1989): the classical dichotomy implies “nominal variables do not affect real variables, the money
market is not very important. This classical view of the economy suggests that, for most policy discussions, the
money market can be ignored” (p.80).
5
A reduction in the inflation expectations generates a higher demand for real money balances, which makes
the real interest rate rise (Palley, 2005).

d. 𝐸𝑌 ∗ < 0 The fall in natural output makes consumption and investment decrease.

2.3. Expansion of the models.
An equation for the real interest rate, based on Taylor’s curve (1993), is added. The IS-LM
approach traditionally started from the assumption that the central bank proposes the money
supply as a target6. This proposal can be changed for another whose instrumental target is the
real interest rate, which is a more realistic explanation of the effective operation of central
banks (Romer, 2000). The real interest rate would be set based on the central bank’s output
gap targets (deviation of real GDP from a target, Taylor, 1993) and inflation with respect to
the price setting target. Therefore, the real interest rate will evolve by:
𝑟̇ = 𝐹((𝑌 − 𝑌 ∗ )+ , (𝜋 − 𝜋 𝑜 )+ )

(3)

For simplicity, πo is 0. Moreover, π can be changed to x.
Now, aggregate demand depends on four endogenous variables: Y, p, x, r.

2.4. TMIA.
Four dynamic model equations:
𝑌̇ = 𝐴(𝐸 − 𝑌)

(4)

𝜋 = 𝐵(𝑌 − 𝑌 ∗ ) + 𝑥

(5)

𝑥̇ = 𝐶(𝜋 − 𝑥) = 𝐵𝐶(𝑌 − 𝑌 ∗ )

(6)

𝑟̇ = 𝐷1 (𝑌 − 𝑌 ∗ ) + 𝐷2 (𝜋) = (𝐷1 + 𝐷2 𝐵)(𝑌 − 𝑌 ∗ ) + 𝐷2 𝑥

(7)

The first three dynamic equations come from Tobin (1975). The second equation can be
written as:
𝑝̇ = 𝑝𝐵(𝑌 − 𝑌 ∗ ) + 𝑝𝑥

(8)

A, B, C, D1 and D2 are parameters.
The ideas in the model are as follows:
i.

ii.

Production increases due to the difference between the planned demand and the
current output. The key idea is Keynesian: that short-term output responds to
variations in demand (Tobin 1975, p. 198).
Nominal prices follow expectations plus or minus a "Phillips curve" adjustment to
the difference between actual and full employment output (Tobin, 1993).

Tobin outlines that r depends on M/p, x, Y, W.

Price change expectations are adaptive.
The fourth equation is a simplified Taylor curve. Changing π for x only changes
the quantification of the coefficient.

2.5. TMIIA.
The TMIIA equations:
𝑌̇ = 𝐴′ (𝑌 ∗ − 𝑌)

(9)

𝑝̇ = 𝑝𝐵 ′ (𝐸 − 𝑌) + 𝑝𝑥

(10)

𝑥̇ = 𝐶 ′ (𝜋 − 𝑥) = 𝐵 ′ 𝐶 ′ (𝐸 − 𝑌)

(11)

𝑅̇ = 𝐷1′ (𝑌 − 𝑌 ∗ ) + 𝐷2′ (𝑥)

(12)

The ideas in the model are:
i.
ii.
iii.
iv.

Production increases due to the difference between full employment development
and production. Demand does not impact growth.
Nominal prices follow expectations plus or minus an adjustment to the difference
between demand and output (Tobin, 1993).
Price change expectations are adaptive.
The fourth equation is a simplified Taylor curve. For simplification, x is
considered.

2.6. Local stability analysis of the expanded models.
Equilibrium conditions:
𝐸−𝑌 =0

(13)

𝑌 − 𝑌∗ = 0

(14)

𝜋 − 𝜋∗ = 0

(15)

𝑥=0

The significant necessary condition:
−𝑝𝐵𝐸𝑝 − (𝐷1 + 𝐷2 𝐵)𝐸𝑟 > 𝐵𝐶𝐸𝑥

(19)

This necessary condition is one of reasonable compliance. Only if the Tobin-Mundell effect
was relatively strong, and the price level and the interest rate effects were relatively weak, the
system would be unstable. The introduction of the interest rate makes the system more stable
than Tobin’s initial system7.

Second, linear approximation of the TMIIA system around equilibrium (equations 13 to 17):

(20)

Necessary conditions relevant to local stability:
−𝑝𝐸𝑝 > 𝐶 ′ 𝐸𝑥

(21)

This is the Tobin’s necessary condition. This is met if the positive effect of inflation on
demand (Keynes and Pigou effects) is stronger than the Tobin-Mundell effect.

3. A supply shock. The pandemic.
A supply shock increases or reduces the aggregate productive capacity or full employment
production. For example, if rainfall increases in a territory, this leads to an increase in the
production possibilities for certain agricultural productions and associated services.
The Covid-19 pandemic operates as an exogenous negative supply shock with a highly
significant impact, which reduces the potential production of goods and services dependent
on social proximity. These are affected, especially the longer it goes on.
This makes a part of the installed capacities and trained human capital redundant. They could
produce goods and services, but the risk of contagion prevents them.
The reduction in potential production makes effective production operate beyond its
possibilities. The economy is in a situation of overheating that is compatible with the
existence of a very significant unemployment: 𝑌 ∗̇ < 0 (Y-Y* increases, Y*-Y decreases).
The economy is operating above its threshold of possibilities in the short-term, not being able

7

𝑝𝐸𝑝 + 𝐶𝐸𝑥 < 0

6

to produce or generate goods and services that are impossible to sell. The natural rate of
unemployment rises.
The models must answer three crucial questions: What are the short-term effects? What are
the long-term effects? Which policies should be used to combat the supply shock?

5. Prediction of the models in the face of a supply shock.
5.1. TMIA.
In the short term, the reduction in the potential output negatively affects consumption and
investment: 𝐸𝑌 ∗ < 0 This generates an economic depression if the negative supply shock is
relevant: 𝑌̇ < 0 (equation (4)). Simultaneously, inflation and inflation expectations increase
(𝑝̇ , 𝑥̇ > 0), since the distance between actual and potential output has increased and the
economy is in a situation of overheating (equations (5) and (6)). This fact and the increasing
inflation produce an increase in the real interest rate (𝑟̇ > 0), equation (7).
In the long term, all endogenous variables interrelate with all the others. The increases in
prices and interest rates generate a reinforcement in the fall in aggregate real income, since Ep
and Er are negative. Therefore, national income falls more profoundly (𝑌̇ < 0 ) as increases in
inflation and the real interest rate confirm the depression. The rise in inflation expectations
cushions the fall, but we must remember that in order to offset the other effects, the model
would have to be locally unstable. This is also unreasonable. Globally, national income Y
decreases, dropping the economy into recession until Y approaches the new Y*.
The movement in the endogenous variables leads to a new equilibrium, provided that the
established stability conditions are met.
Keep in mind that the adjustment is intuitively contrary to the usual one. Generally, aggregate
demand E would autonomously boost aggregate production Y. E now follows a supply shock.
The result is a new equilibrium: (𝑌 = 𝑌−∗ , 𝑝 = 𝑝+∗ , 𝑥 = 𝑥+∗ , 𝑟 = 𝑟+∗ )
It is a ceteris paribus result: in the absence of other exogenous modifications. What effects
would expansionary tax and monetary policies have?
i.

ii.
iii.

An expansionary public spending policy would boost demand E and,
consequently, the growth of income Y (𝐸𝐺 > 0). The effects would be a
cushioning in the fall of Y, sustaining the distance with respect to the full
employment output. There would also be a further increase in inflation,
expectations, and real interest rates.
A relaxed monetary policy would determine a reduction in real interest rates. This
again boosts demand E through consumption and investment (𝐸𝑟 < 0).
A positive result from sustaining demand with both policies, in the face of a
supply shock like the pandemic, is that production is sustained and unemployment
is reduced, gaining time until a vaccine is found or waiting until the production
and consumption processes are adapted to be compatible with greater social
distancing. The cost is increased inflation (and public debt) since 𝑌 > 𝑌 ∗ .

7

5.2. TMIIA.
The aggregate output is reduced (𝑌̇ < 0 ) in direct proportion to the drop in potential
production. The fall depends on parameter 𝐴′ (equation (9)). The depression is a supply-side
event and the result of a constant negative slope. Inflation and inflation expectations decrease
(𝑝̇ , 𝑥̇ < 0) because of the falling aggregate demand 𝐸𝑌 ∗ < 0 (equations (10) and (11)). The
real interest rates grow (𝑟̇ > 0), because of the growing distance between the actual output
and the equilibrium value (equation (12))8. The following impacts of inflation, expectations
and interest rates are reduced to the evolution of prices and their expectations. The depression
does not move with the nominal variables.
Therefore, all movements in prices and interest rates are irrelevant to production, whose fall
is linear. We are seeing a classic adjustment: only production moves and solely due to supply
factors. The adjustment and its speed are independent from demand. Finally, expansionary
fiscal and monetary policies would not have any impact on output.
The other three endogenous variables are adjusted through the impacts on aggregate demand.
The new equilibrium will be: (𝑌 = 𝑌−∗ , 𝑝 = 𝑝−∗ , 𝑥 = 𝑥−∗ , 𝑟 = 𝑟+∗ ).

6. Conclusions.
Firstly, Tobin’s depression models have been expanded, adding an equation for the interest
rate to include all endogenous variables. The conditions for local stability have been
analysed. The four-equation models are not more unstable than Tobin’s initial system.
Second, the problem of the supply shock has been raised in these models, to analyse what
macroeconomic effects they predict. A supply shock increases or reduces the aggregate
productive capacity, changing the natural level of unemployment. The Covid-19 pandemic
operates as a strong exogenous negative supply shock which reduces the potential production
of goods and services dependent on social proximity.
Third, the TMIA (the quantity or Keynesian adjustment) and TMIIA (The Marshallian
adjustment via prices) models give different predictions:
a) The channels through which the supply shock is transmitted (demand versus supply)
are different.
b) The speed of the economic adjustment to the shock is dissimilar. TMIA predicts
differences between the short and long-term. TMIIA does not.
c) Inflation and inflation expectations increase in TMIA and decrease in TMIIA. This
allows the models to be empirically falsified.
d) An expansionary tax policy and a relaxed monetary policy are positives for TMIA and
ineffective in TMIIA. TMIIA contains the traditional doctrine that money is a veil
with no real effects (classical dichotomy).
Fourth, the TMIA predicts an initial depression, in the short-term, whose amount depends on
the value of the derivative of demand with respect to output (Ey). The greater this derivative,

8

Although the fall in price expectations cushions this increase.
8

the more income spent on consumption and investment, the lower the impact in the shortterm.
Moreover, inflation and real interest rates increase. In the medium and long-term, these
increases will worsen the depression. Given the growth in inflation expectations, the TobinMundell effect will partially cushion the situation, preventing a certain reduction in the real
interest rate. We must remember that if this latter effect were very intense, the economy
would not tend to equilibrium.
In the case of the Covid-19 pandemic, expansionary fiscal and monetary policies can sustain
demand and maintain low real interest rates. Their impact is cushioning, and they gain time.
However, the cost is higher inflation since output is above its potential level. Therefore, these
demand measures must be prevented from masking the need for the political supply
measures. Overcoming the disease (vaccine) and/or restructuring measures on the supply side
so that social distancing does not prevent the provision of services and the manufacturing of
goods. Some redistribution of physical and human resources between sectors would be
necessary.
Fifth, the TMIIA predicts a drop in linear output. There is no difference between the short
and long-term, as income linearly varies depending on the difference between full
employment output and effective output. All demand policies that are taken lead solely to a
price increase. Expansionary policies impact on the nominal variables, but not on the real
ones.
In the case of the Covid-19 pandemic, this means that the recovery of income can only come
from supply factors: either from overcoming the disease, or from applying restructuring
measures.
I leave for further research the following questions:
1. TMIA. The conditions under which inflation could rapidly increase. This possibility
could be produced by expansionary policies. Among others, the impact on the real
money supply and on the real private wealth could be so strong that it ended up
offsetting the positive impacts of the low real interest rate.
2. The expansion of these models to open economies.
3. An econometric analysis. When there is a negative supply shock, do inflation and
expectations increase or decrease?
