Abstract 145
Background: This study aims to investigate whether maternal SARS-CoV-2 status affect
placental pathology. Methods: A retrospective case-control study was conducted by reviewing
charts and slides of placentas between April 1 to July 24, 2020. Clinical history of “COVID-19”
were searched in Pathology Database (CoPath). Controls were matched with SARS-CoV-2negative women with singleton deliveries in the 3rd-trimester. Individual and group, pathological
features were extracted from placental pathology reports. Results: Twenty-one 3rd-trimester,
placentas from SARS-CoV-2-positive women were identified and compared to 20 placentas
from SARS-CoV-2-negative women. There were no significant differences in individual or
group gross or microscopic pathological features between the groups. Within the SARS-CoV-2+
group, there are no differences between symptomatic and asymptomatic women. Conclusion:
Placentas from SARS-CoV-2-positive women do not demonstrate a specific pathological pattern.
Pregnancy complicated with COVID-19 during the 3rd trimester does not have a demonstrable
effect on placental structure and pathology.

Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by infection of SARS-CoV-2, a
member of the betacoronavirus family. SARS-CoV-2 is a 30 kb enveloped, positive sense,
single-stranded RNA virus. The virus consists of four structural proteins (spike surface
glycoprotein, envelope protein, membrane protein, and nucleocapsid protein) and non-structural
proteins. The spike protein consists of two functional subunits. The S1 subunit is responsible for
binding to the host cell receptor and the S2 subunit is utilized for the fusion of the viral and
cellular membranes.1,2 Studies showed that the spike protein for SARS-CoV-2 binds to
angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is also a functional receptor for SARS-CoV.
ACE2 expression is high in lung, heart, ileum, kidney and bladder. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 virus
primarily affects the respiratory system, although other organ systems are also involved. 1
Approximately 1% of infected people develop severe acute respiratory distress syndrome
(ARDS) that requires a critical level of care. A MMWR study suggested that pregnant women
with COVID-19 are more likely to be hospitalized, and are at increased risk for intensive care
unit (ICU) admission and receipt of mechanical ventilation, compared to nonpregnant women. 3
While much remains unknown, affected respiratory function affects raise concerns regarding
oxygenation during pregnancy.
Studies of pregnancy outcomes associated with COVID-19 infection suggest that
pregnant women with SARS-CoV2 infection have increased pregnancy complications. 4,5 The
placenta is the key organ at the maternal/fetal interface and is known to be the root cause for
some pregnancy complications. The placenta essentially functions as the fetal lungs and kidneys
and has been implicated in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Valdés G et al have reported
immunocytochemical expression of ACE2 in the syncytiotrophoblast (ST), cytotrophoblast (CT),
3

endothelium and vascular smooth muscle of primary and secondary villi, 6 while Vivanti A et al
demonstrated potential evidence of transplacental transmission. 7 Thus, it is important to study the
effects of SARS-CoV2 infection on placental structure and growth.
We tested the null hypothesis that placentas in women infected at the mid-to-late stage of
pregnancy would show no impact of the viral infection on placental structure and growth.

Materials and Methods
Institution Review Board (IRB) approval
IRB ID# 201902092 was approved by the Office of Institution Review Board,
Washington University in St. Louis.
Study design
Retrospective case-control review charts and slides during April 1 to July 24, 2020.
Study Patients
Placental reports from pregnant women with positive SARS-CoV-2 testing were
identified via the electronic health record in CoPath. They were all third trimester singleton
deliveries during April 1st to July 24, 2020.
Control group
Control placentas were chosen from deliveries during April 1st to July 24, 2020. The
pregnant women chosen were tested for SARS-CoV-2 with negative results. The first third
trimester singleton placenta, accessioned in Histology Laboratory (in the Pathology department)
after the identified SARS-CoV-2 + placenta, were used as study controls. The exclusion criteria
were those without testing, with fetal anomalies, or with a multiple gestation pregnancy.
Clinical information

4

Clinical information was extracted from the electronic medical records (EPIC).
Placental pathology review and central review
All placentas were grossly examined and microscopically examined with H&E-stained
sections, which usually included one section with two umbilical cord sections and membrane
rolls, and three full-thickness sections that included fetal and maternal surfaces. Additional
sections were submitted for any tissue with presumed lesions. The placental pathology reports
were generated by Anatomic or Pediatric Pathology (PediP) board certified pathologists
following established criteria and were centrally reviewed by PediP board-certified
pathologist.8,9 The slides for every case were reviewed by two pathologists.
SARS-CoV-2 testing
Testing for pregnant women via nasopharyngeal swabs was performed at Barnes Jewish
Hospital Molecular Infectious Disease Laboratory. The 2019-Novel Coronavirus Assay
(COVID-19) Real Time RT-PCR assay was used to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
Statistics
The Shapiro–Wilks test was used to check normality of the distribution of the placental
morphometric variables. The mean and standard deviation of each placental morphometric
variable were obtained and mean comparisons between groups were performed using a 2-sample
t-test or Mann–Whitney U test, as appropriate. Chi-square or Fisher’s exact test was used as
appropriate for categorical variables. Significance was set at p<0.05. All the statistical tests were
two-sided and performed with SAS 9.4 (SAS Inc, Cary, NC).
Results
A computerized Copath search yielded 21 placentas from pregnant women who tested
positive for SARS-CoV-2 (the study group), all delivered in the third trimester between 33-40

5

weeks. Correspondingly, 20 control third trimester placentas were chosen by criteria mentioned
in Methods (the control group). Clinical information is summarized in Table 1. There were no
significant differences in maternal age, gestational age at delivery, placental weight, or
fetal/placental (F/P) weight ratio between the two groups.
Detailed histopathological features of the study group are summarized in Table 2. Among
the 21 patients tested positive for COVID-19, seven (7/21, 33.3%) had respiratory symptoms.
Patient #15 delivered at 34 weeks’ gestation and the infant died in seven hours. Fourteen (14/21,
66.7%) placentas had weights that were < 10th % for gestational age, and thus, were small for
gestational age There were no large for gestational age placentas.
Placentas from SARS-CoV-2-positive women did not demonstrate specific pathology or
pathological pattern. There were no significant differences in individual or group
histopathological features between the study and control groups. In the study group, ten of 21
placentas (47.6%) had features of maternal vascular malperfusion (MVM) which was not
significantly different from the four of 20 placentas (20%) with MVM in the control group.
Between the study and control groups, there were ten of 21 (47.6%) placentas in the study group
showing any features of fetal vascular malperfusion (FVM), not significantly different from the
eight of 20 control placentas (40%) with FVM features. There were two of 21 study group, and
three of 20 control, placentas showing maternal inflammatory response, and two of 21 study
group, and four of 20control, placentas showing the fetal inflammatory response (). Each of the
two groups had one placenta with villitis of unknown etiology (VUE) and four placentas with
chronic deciduitis with plasma cells. A single placenta, in the study group, exhibited
T/eosinophilic vasculitis. None of these pathologies were significantly different between the two

6

groups. There were no differences in abnormal cord insertion or cord coiling between the two
groups, not any differences in chorioamnion pathology.
Within the SARS-CoV-2-positive study group patients, there were seven symptomatic
patients and fourteen asymptomatic patients. There were no significant differences between
symptomatic and asymptomatic patients in the number placentas with SGA (5/7 vs. 9/14),
MVM(4/7 vs 6/14), FVM (4/7 vs 6/14), or signs of chronic inflammation reflected by chronic
deciduitis or VUE (2/7 vs 3/14).

Discussion
Placental pathology with SARS-CoV-2 positive women
The data show that we must accept the null hypothesis that there is no significant
difference in placental pathology in women tested for SARS-CoV-2, comparing those positive
with those negative. This differs from two case-control studies of placental pathology in patients
who were SARS-CoV-2 positive. Shanes and associates examined15 placentas delivered in the
third trimester in COVID positive women and reported a high prevalence of decidual
arteriopathy and other features of MVM.10 This study included a 16-week intrauterine fetal
demise in which fetal tissue tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. 10 Smithgall and colleagues
demonstrated that 52 third trimester placentas from SARS-CoV-2-positive women had higher
prevalence of villous agglutination and subchorionic thrombi, compared to placentas in the
control group.11 None of these pathologies were more frequent in our two groups of patients
were compared based on COVID-19 test-positivity. In a case series, Baergen and Heller found
that ten of 20 (10/20, 50%) cases of COVID positive patients showed some evidence of FVM or
fetal vascular thrombosis (FTV).12 Moreover, Hecht and colleagues examined placentas of

7

nineteen COVID-19 exposed women and found that there was no characteristic histopathology
present among the 19 cases, despite two placental infections. 13
Our study included a control group of placentas to compare with placentas from SARSCoV-2 positive women, and we did not identify a specific pathology or pathological pattern
attributed to the virus. Compared to placentas from SARS-CoV-2-negative women, there were
no significant differences in gross and microscopic placental pathology, including placental
weight, SGA placentas, abnormal cord insertion or cord coiling, MVM, FVM, and maternal or
fetal inflammatory responses. Our results of no signature pathology for placentas in women
positive for COVID-19 reflect the findings of our local obstetrical patient population in St.
Louis, MO, from which the study subjects were derived. Populations from other locales, such as
the ones reported in the above papers, may exhibit different placental responses that reflect
regional differences in patient populations.
The microscopic findings from current study support our acceptance of the null
hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 infection acquired during third trimester does not have a
demonstrable impact on placental structure and pathology. Notably, our acceptance of the null
hypothesis is further supported by absence of significant differences in placental weight and
fetal/placental weight ratio. Placental weight is a surrogate for placental growth and development
while fetal/placental weight ratio is often regarded as a surrogate marker for placental efficiency.
We do not rule out a greater impact if the infection occurred earlier in pregnancy.
Key issues related to pregnancy associated with COVID-19
ACE2 in placenta
Immunocytochemical expression of ACE2 is localized in the syncytiotrophoblast,
cytotrophoblast, endothelium and vascular smooth muscle of primary and secondary villi. 6

8

Expression of ACE2 by immunohistochemistry in placentas of COVID-19 exposed pregnancies
showed ACE2 membranous expression polarized in the villous syncytiotrophoblast (with
immunoreactivity highest on the stromal side of the ST). Importantly, there was also
cytotrophoblast and extravillous trophoblast expression of ACE2. In contrast, no ACE2
expression was detected in villous stroma, Hofbauer cells, or endothelial cells. 13 ACE2 protein is
enriched per unit volume in the placenta and ovary, compared to other tissues, despite a low
mRNA level detected in the two tissues.14 The studies offer a potential mechanism for maternalfetal transmission.
Does SARS-CoV-2 infect placenta?
Smithgall and colleagues found no evidence of direct viral infection of the placenta,
using in-situ hybridization for the S-gene encoding the spike protein and immunohistochemistry
with the monoclonal-SARS-CoV-2 spike-antibody 1A9.11 Conversely, in two of 19 cases
reported by Hecht et al.13, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was present in placental villi focally, in both the
ST and cytotrophoblast.13 Moreover, three of 11 placentas having swabs taken from villi and
fetal membranes tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. 15 An additional case report, of a woman who
was infected with SARS-CoV-2 at 22 weeks gestation, showed that the placenta and umbilical
cord were positive for SARS-CoV-2 at delivery.16 Localization of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein
and RNA was found in both villi and peri-villous fibrin. 16 Collectively, these data suggest that
viral colonization of the placenta and fetal membranes may occur but not in a predictable
manner. Whether colonization leads to infection remains unknown.
Is there vertical transmission
Studies of vertical transmission to date have shown conflicting results, 2,17 but a cautious
conclusion is that there is minimal, if any, role for vertical transmission of the virus through the

9

placenta to the fetus. Clearly, this is a key question in understanding the impact of COVID-19 on
maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality.
Placental pathology in SARS and MERS
Verma and colleagues reviewed placental pathology associated with SARS or MERS
infection.2 Placentas from these coronavirus viruses show acute and chronic placental
insufficiency and associated with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) or miscarriage in 40%
of affected pregnancies.18-20 However, the key issue again lies in the need for studies with a
control group. A case in point is our study, which demonstrated almost half of the cases in the
study group demonstrated features of maternal or fetal vascular malperfusion; however, there
was no statistically significant difference in the study group when compared with the control
group.
Conclusion
Third trimester placentas from SARS-CoV-2-positive women do not express specific
pathology or pathological pattern. While they harbor a relatively high prevalence of features of
maternal or fetal vascular malperfusion, these features were not unique as they were also present
in women who had a clinical indication for SARS-CoV-19 testing with test-negative results.
Pregnancy complicated with COVID-19 during the 3rd trimester does not have an obvious effect
on placental structure and pathology. We do not rule out a greater impact if the infection
occurred earlier in pregnancy.
