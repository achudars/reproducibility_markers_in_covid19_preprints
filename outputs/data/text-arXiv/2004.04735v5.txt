A BSTRACT
Background: The analysis of the Sars-CoV-2 epidemic is of paramount importance to understand
the dynamics of the coronavirus spread. This can help health and government authorities take the
appropriate measures and implement suitable politics aimed at fighting and preventing it.
Methods: A time-dependent dynamic SIR model inspired in a model previously used during the
MERS outbreak in South Korea was used to analyse the time trajectories of active and hospitalized
cases in Portugal.
Results: The time evolution of the virus spread in the country was adequately modelled. The model
has changeable parameters every five days since the onset of mitigation measures. A peak of about
19,000 active cases is estimated. Hospitalized cases could reach a peak of about 1,250 cases, of which
200-300 in ICU units.
Conclusion: With appropriate measures, the number of active cases in Portugal can be controlled
at about 19,000 people, of which about 1,250 hospitalized and 200-300 in ICU units. This seems
manageable by the country’s national health service with an estimated 1,140 ventilators.

Introduction.

There is already abundant information on Sars-CoV-2 [1–5]. In the most severe cases, the virus Sars-CoV-2 infection
can lead to the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) causing respiratory failure, septic shock,
multiorgan failure, and even death [6]. Studies suggest that the case fatality rate of the virus is of about 3.5% in
mainland China [7]. However, this value seems to be much higher in Italy [8], suggesting its strong dependence on
demographics [9]. The WHO declared Europe as the new epicentre of the disease on the 13th of March of 2020[ [10].
The rapid growth of the number of active cases presenting severe symptoms has saturated the health services in most
countries in the continent, especially in Italy [11]. Governments throughout Europe have implemented severe measures
to prevent and mitigate the spread of the virus. Yet, as of the 6th of April there were as many as 646,340 confirmed
cases on the European continent, resulting in 49,227 deaths [2, 3].
In this study, a time-dependent SEIR model [12, 13] was used to analyse the evolution of current active and hospitalised
cases in Portugal. The model takes into account mitigation and self-protective measures implemented by the government
and the population, from the 18th of March 2020 onwards. The use of time-dependent models has been proposed before
as they provide a chance to readjust the parameters as time passes and the conditions in which the epidemic is spreading
change [14].
This study shows that although sometimes blunt [15], an SEIR model can accurately predict the trajectory of the curve
of infected and hospitalized cases, and may be suitable to be used in the future for a consistent analysis of the data, and
the repercussions of mitigation and control measures, which can be taken into account in these models.

Methodology.

A time-dependent SEIR model inspired by a model developed by Xia et al [12, 13] was used, which can be understood
by the flow diagram shown in figure 1. This is an update from a previously used preliminary version [13], in which all
infected cases ended up hospitalized. Given how unrealistic that sounds, the model now considers that 13% of infected
cases are hospitalized, and 87% are recovered through the normal recovery rate (these proportions were taken from
Portuguese data [16]. Furthermore, the model considers only one transmission coefficient, one government measure
coefficient, and one self-protective measure coefficient.
In this model, S corresponds to the number of susceptible individuals; E, the number of exposed individuals; A, the
number of asymptomatic cases; I, the number of mild-to-severe infected cases; H, the number of hospitalized cases; R,
the number of removed cases, and finally N, the total population of Portugal.
The model is time-dependent, because β(t), the transmission coefficient of the asymptomatic, symptomatic, and
hospitalized cases to the susceptible, can vary with time. Although this variation is not continuous. This will be
explained later.
σ −1 is the mean incubation period, λ−1 is the mean time between symptom onset to hospitalization, k −1 is the mean
infectious/recovery period, δ −1 is the mean time from hospitalization to death, γ is the clinical outbreak rate, l represents
the self-protective measures taken by individuals, and d the mitigation measurements taken by the government. Of the
symptomatic (I) cases 13% need hospitalization, whereas 87% heal without the need to be hospitalized. The time unit is
1 day. The set of differential equations can then be written as:

The only parameter considered to be known was the mean incubation time, which was taken as σ −1 = 5.1 days from
the literature (here using the median as equal to the mean) [17]. From the previous work, determined from the Italian
recovery data [18], a mean infectious/recovery period of about k −1 ≈ 11 days was used, and taken to be the same in all
cases. The clinical outbreak rate which was taken to be γ ≈ 7%, a mean value from values reported for attack rates [19],
in a first approximation, and again, this is an approximate value. The epidemic starts at the 15th of February (the day of
the first reported case in Europe) with only one person infected (I0 = 1), being the rest of the values 0, except for S0

which is simply N-1. See table 1 for a breakdown of the different parameters of this model. To solve this system of
differential equations the Mathematica code [20] was used, using the function “NonLinearModelFit” [21].
In order to determine the parameters λ, and δ, the number of hospitalized cases and deaths, respectively, as reported by
the Portuguese Directorate-General of Health (DGS in Portuguese) and available online, were used [16]. Fits were made
on the 27th of March. After determining the values for these parameters, they were used to fit the curve of infected
cases in Portugal, where the values of β(t), d and l were fitted in seven different periods:
• Period 0, from the 15th of February to the 18th of March (5 days after the government decreed a State of
Emergency, giving the virus another incubation period),
• Period 1, from the 19th to the 24th of March,
• Period 2, from the 25th to the 30th of March,
• Period 3, from the 31st of March to the 4th of April,
• Period 4, from the 5th to the 10th of April,
• Period 5, from the 10th to the 15th of April,
• Period 6, from the 15th to the 20th of April (prediction).
The three parameters β, l, and d were fitted for each of these five periods. All other parameters were fixed.

Results.
Adjusting parameter λ.

The number of deaths in Portugal was taken from [16], and the set of differential equations described in eq. 1 fitted
to obtain the best possible fit for δ. An R2 value of ∼0.99 was obtained with the fit. The rest of the parameters are
presented in table 2 . Results are shown in figure 2.
3.2

Adjusting parameter λ.

Now, using the value for δ found in 3.1, parameter λ was obtained with a new fit of Eq. 1 to the number of hospitalized
cases in Portugal, which again was taken from [16]. The best possible fit gave an R2 value of ∼0.98. The rest of the
parameters are presented in table 3, and shown in figure 3.

The parameters needed to fit Eq. 1 to the number of Portuguese active cases until the 18th of March, in order to
determine the value of β, were obtained in 3.1, and 3.2. The number of Portuguese active cases was taken from [16].
The fit was obtained with an R2 of 0.99. The other parameters for β are given in table 4. In this period, no measures
were being taken so, l = 1; and d = 0.

Discussion of the obtained values for λ, δ, and β for period 0

According to the obtained values of λ, δ, and β, the mean time between onset of symptoms and hospitalization (for
the 13% of cases that need to be hospitalized) is of λ−1 = 3.51 ± 0.17 days, and the mean time of those hospitalized
until death is of δ −1 = 14.6 ± 0.45days. Unfortunately, I did not find any official data about these numbers in order to
establish a comparison to ascertain their adequacy.
Also, the model assumes that all symptomatic and no asymptomatic cases are being tested, which may not reflect a
realistic situation. This is probably very conditional to the number of tests being performed by the country and may
also vary with time.

Time evolution of Sars-CoV-2 in Portugal, considering time adjustable parameters.

In an epidemic outbreak such as the current one, governments and the population take protective measures to attempt to
contain the spread of the virus. In this paper, parameters l and d, inspired by the paper from Xia et al [12, 13] , are
introduced as explained in section 3. These parameters are meant to take into account two things:
• Isolation and monitoring measures taken by the government (parameter d);
• Self-protection measures taken by the population (parameter l).
In a previous study, four different scenarios in addition to an “out-of-control” scenario, were devised. To note that we
are currently working with d1 = d2 = d3 = d4 = d and l1 = l2 = l3 = l.
The day considered for the initiation of these measures is day 33 corresponding to the 19th of March 2020 which is 5
days after the government implemented the measures, giving the virus another cycle of infection before the measures
take effect.

Implementing a dynamic model to follow the trajectory of the curve.

In the current analysis, instead of using set values from educated guesses as done in my previous work, the values of β,
d and l are adjustable to the curve. In order to fit the results, four periods of five days each, from the 19th of March,
were considered. In the first three periods, the same official data to fit the results was used. Initial conditions were
taken from the previous period, and equation 1 was solved for the trajectory of the curve in the remainder of days in the
same period. This procedure was performed for each period. This allowed for a dynamic follow-up of the trajectory,
adjusting the parameters to the best possible fit to the curve in each period. The obtained results are summarized in
table 6. A graphical depiction of the evolution of the obtained curve for infected cases is given in 5. For hospitalized
cases, this is provided in figure 6.

As is clear from the figures, the number of active and hospitalized cases was reached between the 10th and the 15th of
April at around 1,250 cases, below the predictions of the model. In fact the number of hospitalized cases has reached a
plateau. Current active cases are around ∼19,000. Considering that the number of ICU cases has been between 20-30%
of the total of hospitalized cases (see data), this would mean a number of about 200 300 cases in ICU.

Figure 7: Graphical representation of R0 for each time period.
The last period corresponds to a prediction of the values for the five days following period 5 (10th to the 15th of April
2020). Both l and β were extrapolated using a polinomial function, which enables the estimation of their value for the
next period, as can be seen in table 7:

Estimating R0 for this model.

The obtained values for β, allow for an estimate of the basic reproduction number for all considered periods.
Following the formalism proposed by Van der Driessche and Watmough [22], and α = 0.13 we can define F and V ,
that the equilibrium state is given by (S0 , 0, 0, 0):

This gives a value of R0 = 11.77, indicating a very active spread of the virus in this first stage, although this value
seems higher than most studies. In this model, given that cases will only resolve after a period of about k −1 ∼ 10
days, during which time they will be able to infect another individual. Also, there is a very high uncertainty for the
appropriate incubation time of this virus, which some authors claim can be of up to 27 days [23, 24]. This is still
something that needs to be analysed in more detail.
This permits us to estimate the value for the evolution of the basic reproduction number Rc with time, as can be seen in
figure 7.
As can be seen the value of R0 is diminishing with time, with a predicted value already very close to 1 for the period of
the 20th to the 25th of April 2020, although the value has clearly increased from a minimum in the week from the 10th
to the 15th of April.

Conclusions

SEIR models, although sometimes blunt in their deterministic approach, are valuable tools to model epidemic outbreaks.
If used carefully and dynamically (i.e. with adjustable parameters on given periods) it is possible to accurately predict
the trajectory of an epidemic curve within a five to ten-day period. Protective and isolation measures are currently the
only weapon at our disposal to control this epidemic. SEIR models are effective in taking these measures into account
10

A PREPRINT - 4 TH M AY, 2020

by the insertion of one or two extra parameters. Variation of such parameters can be demonstrative of the power of
any given measure, be it in terms of self-protection (washing hands frequently, social isolation, etc.) or community
measures (closing down schools, parks, etc.).

Limitations of this study and scope of application

This study is intended for academic purposes only and should not be used in any other way. It intends to provide tools
for scientists to model the trajectory of active and hospitalized cases in the current pandemic. With this model, and
although in earlier predictions the values were of ∼13,000 active cases and ∼2,500 hospitalized cases, it seems now
that a maximum of ∼19,000 active cases and ∼1,250 hospitalized cases will or has already been reached in this period.
The value of Ref f is now approaching one which means that in the next few days we will see the number of active
cases starting to finally diminish. This model assumes that only symptomatic cases are being tested. Given that the
number of tests in Portugal is now one of the highest in the World, it is very likely that non priority cases are also
being tested now, which means that the model is starting to fail, as asymptomatic cases begin being tested. This could
explain the plateau reached in the number of hospitalized cases, which, as we know represent 13% of the total number
of symptomatic cases. If this hypothesis is proven to be correct, the country may have already reached the peak of
active cases (both symptomatic and asymptomatic), but is simply testing asymptomatics now leading to an increase in
the number of confirmed cases, but a constant number of hospitalized and ICU cases.
