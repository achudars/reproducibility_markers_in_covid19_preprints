MOBILE PHONE DATA ANALYTICS AGAINST THE COVID-19 EPIDEMICS IN ITALY

INTRODUCTION
—

Understanding human mobility patterns is crucial to plan the restart of production and economic activities, which are currently put in “stand-by” to fight the diffusion of the epidemics. A recent analysis shows that, following the national lockdown of March 9th, the mobility fluxes have decreased by 50% or more, everywhere in the country [13]. In this report,
To this purpose, we use mobile phone data to compute the movements of people between
Italian provinces, and we analyze the incoming, outcoming and internal mobility flows before and during the national lockdown (March 9th, 2020) and after the closure of non-necessary productive and economic activities (March 23th, 2020). The population flow across
provinces and municipalities enable for the modeling of a risk index tailored for the mobility of each municipality or province. Such an index would be a useful indicator to drive counter-measures in reaction to a sudden reactivation of the epidemics.
Mobile phone data, even when aggregated to preserve the privacy of individuals, are a useful data source to track the evolution in time of human mobility [8, 9], hence allowing for
monitoring the effectiveness of control measures such as physical distancing [4, 5, 6]. In
this report, we address the following analytical questions: How does the mobility structure
of a territory change? Do incoming and outcoming flows become more predictable during
the lockdown, and what are the differences between weekdays and weekends? Can we detect proper local job markets based on human mobility flows, to eventually shape the borders of a local outbreak?
An interactive version of this report will be available at http://sobigdata.eu/covid_report

MOBILE PHONE
DATA
—
The raw data used in this report are the result of normal service operations
performed by the mobile operator WINDTRE1: CDRs (Call Detail Records) and
XDRs (eXtended Detail Records). In both cases, the fundamental geographical
unit is the “phone cell” defined as the area covered by a single antenna, i.e., the
device that captures mobile radio signals and keeps the user connected with
the network. Multiple antennas are usually mounted on the same tower, each
covering a different direction. The position of the tower (expressed as latitude
and longitude) and the direction of the antenna allow inferring the extension of
the corresponding phone cell. The position of caller and callee is approximated by the corresponding antenna serving the call, whose extension is relatively
small in urban contexts (in the order of 100m x 100m) and much larger in rural
areas (in the order of 1km x 1km or more).
Based on this configuration, CDRs describe the location of mobile phone users during call activities and XDRs their location during data transmission for
internet access. The information content provided by standard CDR and XDR
is the following:
Call Detail
Records (CDR)

For each phone call, a tuple <no , ni , t , As , Ae , d> is recorded, where
no and ni are pseudo-anonymous identifiers, respectively of the
“caller” and the “callee”; t is a timestamp saying when the call was
placed; As and Ae are the identifiers of the towers/antennas to which
the caller was connected at the start and end of the call; finally, d is
the call duration (e.g., in minutes).

Extended Detail
Records (XDR)

They are similar to CDRs, except that the communication is only
between the antenna and the connected mobile phone, and an
amount k of kilobytes is downloaded in the process. The format of
XDR is, therefore, a tuple <n, t, A, k>.
In both CDRs and XDRs, the identity of the users is replaced by artificial identifiers. The correspondence between such identifiers and the real identities of
the users is known only to the mobile phone operator, who might use it in case
of necessity. This pseudonymization procedure is a first important step (mentioned in Article 6(4) and Article 25(1) of the GDPR, the EU General Data Protection Regulation) to provide anonymity [7, 10, 11] and it will then turn into totally anonymous data for the possible treatment data use. For the analyses in this
report, we used aggregated data computed by the mobile operator covering the
period February 3rd, 2020 to March 28th, 2020.
WINDTRE is one of the main mobile phone operators in Italy, covering
around 32% of the residential “human” mobile market.

MOBILE PHONE DATA ANALYTICS AGAINST THE COVID-19 EPIDEMICS IN ITALY

ORIGIN-DESTINATION
MATRICES
—
CDRs and XDRs are aggregated into daily municipality-to-municipality origin-destination
(OD) matrices: there is an OD matrix per each day, and each element ODA, B of the matrix
describes the total number of trips from municipality A to municipality B. The presence of
two consecutive points of a user in different municipalities indicates a movement, which is
counted as a trip if the user stays in the destination municipality for at least one hour, and
discarded otherwise. For a better matching with public COVID-19 data, we aggregated the
municipality-to-municipality ODs into province-to-province ODs, in which each node represents an Italian province. The trips between municipalities of the same province have been
aggregated into a self-loop, which indicates the province’s internal mobility. As they are calculated by the operator, we store the daily municipality-to-municipality OD matrices and the
daily province-to-province ones into a relational DBMS and access them through calls to a
dedicated API.

Figure 1 visualizes the out-flows and in-flows of the province of Padua (region of Veneto,
north-east of the country), for February 18th (before the lockdown, on the left) and March
24th (during the lockdown, on the right). The chart shows the flows among provinces with
a stroke width proportional to the flows. The out-flows (in-flow) are first linked to the corresponding region and then to the final destination (origin). During the lockdown, we observe
a drastic reduction of both the in- and the out-flows (reported on labels in the corresponding circle), as well as a reduction of the number of provinces the flows are coming from or
are directed to. The reduction in the number of provenances and destinations is also evident in the other provinces of the country. For example, Figure 2 shows this pattern is even
more pronounced for the province of Bari, in the region of Puglia in the south-east of the
country.

FIGURE 1 - PROVINCE OF PADUA
Visualization of the in-flows and the out-flows of the province of Padua (region of Veneto, northeast of the country), on Tuesday February 18th (before the lockdown, on the left) and Tuesday
March 24th (during the lockdown, on the right). Note that most of the flows are contained within
the Padua’s region (Veneto) and neighboring regions, that the number of distinct origins and destinations of flows decrease during the lockdown.

INCOMING, OUTCOMING AND
INTERNAL MOBILITY FLOWS
—
How did mobility flows in Italy change during the lockdown? This
aspect is crucial to quantify to what extent the government directives have had the desired effect. We selected four Italian provinces: Bergamo, Padua, Bari, and Catania. For each of these provinces,
we computed the evolution day by day of three types of flow:

1.

out-flows, indicating the total number of people moving from the
province to any other province in Italy on that day;

2.

in-flows, indicating the total number of people moving to the
province from any other province in Italy on that day;

3.

self-flows (or internal flows), indicating the total number of
people moving between municipalities of the same province on
that day.

Figure 3 shows the evolution of the normalized in-flows, out-flows,
and self-flows of the selected provinces. It is evident how all provinces have a net decrease of the in-, out- and self-flows soon after the first national lockdown (March 9th), and a stabilization of
the flows on the new volume after around one week, from March
15th. Therefore, subsequent ordinances, such as closing factories
on March 17th, have had a minor impact on the reduction of mobility flows.

FIGURE 3 - EVOLUTION OF FLOWS
The two vertical lines indicate the dates of the national lockdown (March 9th) and the closure of
non-necessary productive and economic activities (March 23th). We observe a significant decrease
in the volume of flows after the national lockdown, while we do not observe a comparable decrease
soon after the closure of non-necessary activities.

FLOW
DIVERSITY
—
An important aspect of the mobility of a province is the diversification of the provenience
and the destination of people. Specifically, we define the in-flow diversity of a province A as
the Shannon entropy of the in-flows to the province [12]:

where Pin is the number of provinces with non-null flow to province A, p(x) is the probability that the in-flow to province A comes from province x, and log(N) is a normalization factor where N=110 is the number of Italian provinces. The out-flow diversity of province A is
computed similarly as:

where Pout is the number of provinces with non-null flow from province A, and p(x) is the
probability that the out-flow from province A goes to province x.
The horizon charts in Figure 4 show the evolution of the in- and out-flow diversity for the
four selected provinces, while those in Figure 5 refer to 30 provinces chosen randomly. The
vertical axis lines represents time, each rectangle section has a color proportional to the
displayed measure (darker color for larger value). The circles on the left have an area proportional to the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the corresponding province up to
March 24th. We find a progressive reduction of both the in- and out-flow diversity as time
goes by, with an acceleration of the process soon after the beginning of the national lockdown (March 9th). Before the lockdown, the in- and out-flow diversities are slightly higher
at the weekends than the weekdays. The opposite is true during the lockdown: the in- and
out-flow diversities are considerably lower at the weekends than the weekdays. This exciting result suggests that: (i) the provenience and the destination of a province’s mobility flows during the lockdown are more predictable than before the lockdown; (ii) regarding
the weekends, the provenience and destination of flows are more diverse before the lockdown than during it.

Horizon chart that describes the evolution in time of the in- and out-flow diversity of the provinces of
Bergamo, Padua, Bari and Catania. The circles on the left have an area proportional to the number of
confirmed COVID-19 cases in the corresponding province up to March 24th. Horizon charts compact
the area chart by slicing it horizontally, and then shifting the slices to baseline zero. Black solid vertical lines indicate the dates of the national lockdown (March 9th) and the closure of non-necessary
productive and economic activities (March 23th). The white dashed vertical lines indicate Sundays.
Note that, while the in- and out-flow diversities slightly increase in the weekends before the lockdown,
they decrease in the weekends during the lockdown.

CLUSTERS
OF PROVINCES
—
We use the k-means clustering algorithm to discover k groups of similar
provinces in terms of their evolution
of in- and out-flow diversity. To find the
best value of k, we repeat the algorithm
for k = 2, ..., 20. For both the in- and outflow diversities, we find that k = 5 minimizes the within-cluster distance. Figure 6 shows the centroids of the five
clusters of in-flow diversity.
Although the clusters’ trends are similar, they have different typical in-flow
diversities. We provide in the Appendix the figure that shows the clusters’
centroids regarding the evolution of
the out-flow diversity. Figure 7 visualizes the evolution of the in-flow diversity for all the provinces in cluster 4, the
one with the highest typical in-flow diversity. We provide in the Appendix the
horizon charts regarding the other four
clusters.

FIGURE 6 - CLUSTERS OF PROVINCES

line indicates the deviation of the provinces from the centroid. Note that, though the
clusters have similar trends, they have different typical in-flow diversities.

LOCAL JOB
MARKETS
—
Economic activities are linked by input-output relationships, with interconnected supply
chains that are difficult to isolate. Local Job Markets (LJM) take into account the shifts between the home-work displacements (commuting) that occur between different municipalities. Each LJM is partially isolated from the others, allowing from a more precise control
with respect to the administrative classifications of the territory (e.g., municipalities, provinces, regions).
One strategy to detect LJMs is to identify clusters of geographical areas that are homogeneous w.r.t. their mobility flows, i.e., groups of municipalities for which the internal mobility fluxes are denser than the outgoing ones. This can be done by analyzing the municipality-to-municipality OD matrices as weighted directed graphs [1] and using a community
detection algorithm [2] to discover a collection of well-bounded mesoscale topologies, e.g.,
municipality clusters. Note that community detection algorithms can provide different results depending on their definition of what a community is [2]. We use algorithm Infomap
[3], which uses the probability flow of random walks on a graph as a proxy for information
flows in the real system, and decomposes the network into clusters by compressing a description of the probability flow. The algorithm looks for a cluster partition of the given network that minimizes the expected description length of a random walk.
We applied Infomap to the daily municipality-to-municipality OD matrices. Figure 8 shows
the evolution in time of the number of LJMs (communities) in the country. Since the national lockdown (March 9th), there has been a striking increase in the number of communities, indicating that people moved within smaller areas. For example, note that on Monday,
March 2nd (before the lockdown), we have around 350 communities, while the number of
communities on Monday, March 16th (during the lockdown) is around 550 communities,
200 more. We also find that, during the lockdown, the number of communities increases by
around 50% on the weekends (in Figure 8, Sundays are denoted by vertical lines). Also, note
that the number of communities increases after the closure of non-necessary productive
and economic activities (March 22nd). This may indicate that, while we do not appreciate
any significant difference in the volume and diversity of flows after this closure, the structure of mobility flows has changed significantly.

Evolution in time of the number of Local Job Markets (communities) in Italy, according to the Infomap algorithm. Grey vertical lines indicate Sundays. Note that, after the beginning of the national lockdown (March 9th), there is a striking increase of the LJMs. Moreover, there is a slight increase of the
communities after the closure of non-necessary activities (March 22nd).

Figure 9 shows the local job markets we
found in Puglia (a region on the southeast of the country) before the lockdown

Note the fragmentation of the territory
during the lockdown, especially for the
easternmost and the westernmost parts
of the region.

CONCLUSIONS
—
In our first report of the analysis of mobility flows using mobile phone data up to March
28th, 2020, we find several interesting results. First, regarding the volume of in-, out- and
self-flows between provinces, we find a significant decrease after the national lockdown
(March 9th). Still, we do not find any significant decrease soon after the closure of the
non-necessary productive activities.
Regarding the in- and out-flow diversities, we find that while there is a slight increase in the
flow diversity on the weekends before the lockdown, there is a strong decrease of the flow
diversity on the weekends during the lockdown. Moreover, the application of data mining
techniques reveals the presence of five main clusters of provinces.
Finally, we use a community detection algorithm to find local job markets in Italy. We observe a striking increase in the number of communities during the lockdown and a slight
increase after the closure of non-necessary activities. This suggests that reduced mobility
split the territory into more and smaller local job markets. This information may be exploited by decision- and policy-makers to plan “phase 2” of the management of the epidemics.
In the next report, we will investigate deeply how the structure of the OD matrices evolve
in time, and we will extend the period of observation to the most recent days. We will also
focus our analysis on some specific regions, considering the evolution of the epidemics
at a municipality level. We will compare the impact of mobility reduction to the outbreak,
answering several analytical questions: What is the virus-spreading effect generated by
late-February north-south flows? How large should a “red zone” be to reduce effectively the
spread of the epidemic?
