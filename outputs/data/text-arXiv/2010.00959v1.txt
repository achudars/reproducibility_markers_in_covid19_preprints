Abstract
The death toll for Covid-19 may be reduced by dividing the population into
two classes, the vulnerable and the fit, with different lockdown regimes. Instead of
one reproduction number there now are four parameters. These make it possible to
quantify the effect of the social distancing measures. There is a simple stochastic
model for epidemics in a two type population. Apart from the size of the population
of the vulnerable and the fit, and the initial number of infected in the two classes,
only the four reproduction parameters are needed to run the two type Reed-Frost
model. The program is simple and fast. On a pc it takes less than five minutes to
do a hundred thousand simulations of the epidemic for a population of the size of
the US. Epidemics are non-linear processes. Results may be counterintuitive. The
average number of vulnerable persons infected by an infectious fit person is a crucial
parameter of the epidemic in the two type population. Intuitively this parameter
should be small. However simulations show that even if this parameter is small the
death toll may be higher than without shielding. Under certain conditions increasing
the value of the parameter may reduce the death toll. The article addresses these
blind spots in our intuition.

Introduction

The reproduction number for Covid-19 lies between 2 and 3 if we take no action to stop
it spreading. With proper measures such as social distancing it may be reduced to below
one. It is known that infections are more lethal for the elderly (and for persons who suffer
from obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure) than for healthy young persons 1 . These two
facts suggest that a social distancing policy which takes into account the difference in
risk for the vulnerable and for the fit might be effective in reducing the overall mortality.
So consider a population consisting of a million vulnerable persons and two million fit
persons. Assume that the mortality is ten times as high for the vulnerable as for the fit.
To be concrete, assume an Infection Fatality Rate (IFR) of 0.01 for the vulnerable and
0.001 for the fit. This yields an overall IFR of 0.004 = (0.01 + 2 ∗ 0.001)/3.
Assume a two type model. A vulnerable person infects rv = 0.7 persons on average,
a fit person rf = 1.3. Ten vulnerable persons and twenty fit, all infectious, on average
will yield 7 + 26 = 33 new infections (corresponding to the overall reproduction number
r0 = 1.1). Start with a hundred infections among the vulnerable and two hundred among
the fit. The population is compartmentalized. If the compartments are watertight, there
is no contact between the vulnerable and the fit. The epidemic will die out among the
vulnerable since rv = 0.7 < 1, but it will be more severe among the fit than in the
corresponding homogeneous model with reproduction number r0 = 1.1 since rf = 1.3 >
1.1. Computations show that the total number of deaths is lower than in a homogeneous
population.
In a more realistic model the expected number rf,v of vulnerable persons infected by an
infectious fit person and the number rv,f of fit persons infected by an infectious vulnerable
person are positive. So suppose ten infectious fit persons infect on average eleven fit
persons and two vulnerable persons, and ten infectious vulnerable persons infect five
vulnerable persons and two fit persons. This “standard model” will play a prominent role
in the discussion below. The infection rate between the two groups is low. Such a society
may be said to shield the vulnerable. How effective is this shield? Simulations show that
in the heterogeneous society there will be more deaths than in a homogeneous population

1 INTRODUCTION

with reproduction number r0 = 1.1. In the homogeneous population the death toll has a
mean value of 2124; in the two type model the mean is ten per cent higher, 2347.
The result is not implausible. There is a considerable increase in the total number
of infections among the fit. The positive cross infection rf,v = 0.2 from the fit to the
vulnerable has the effect that the vulnerable are pulled along in this more severe epidemic,
yielding a higher overall mortality. Compartmentalization increases the death toll.
Shielding the vulnerable may be counterproductive. That is what this paper is meant
to show. For three values of r0 , 1.1, 1.0 and 0.95, we choose values of rv and rf which
satisfy (rv + 2rf )/3 = r0 . We then plot the mortality as the transition rate rf,v from fit
to vulnerable varies between 0 and 0.8. This is done for various values of rv,f . Figures 2,
left side, and 3 show the effect on the mortality.
It is not clear how the transitions rf,v and rv,f are related. Intuitively for nursing
homes one might interpret rf,v as measuring infections caused among the elderly by visits
by the family, and rv,f as infections among the nurses and staff caused by illness among
the elderly. Section 4 will look at this issue more closely.
The main purpose of the paper is to exhibit possible adverse effects of shielding in a
heterogeneous population. This aim has been achieved already above by mentioning the
results of the computations for the standard model. For the given values rv = 0.7 and
rf = 1.3 above, and rv,f = 0.2, a large value of rf,v will reduce the total mortality. Based
on that result the government might consider launching a campaign: “Tonight don’t meet
at the pub; visit your granny instead.”
The benefits of social distancing measures which differentiate between the fit and the
vulnerable are incontestable. This paper shows that policies have to be chosen with care
to avoid adverse affects. Here we should mention a different beneficial effect of variations
in the reproductive number across a population. Heterogeneity may reduce the herd
immunity threshold 2,3 .
For an introduction to the mathematical background see 4,5 . The exposition below is
self-contained. It relies on simulations. Readers with some experience in R are invited to
use their skill to explore the effects of variations in the reproduction matrix.

2 THE MODEL AND ITS PROGRAM

Section 2 introduces the binomial Reed-Frost model. Section 3 presents the results.
These are discussed in Section 4. Section 5 contains our conclusion. The Appendix
contains two sections: a non technical explanation of the decrease in mortality associated
with large values of rf,v and a discussion of the role of eigenvalues and eigenvectors in the
two-type Reed-Frost model.

The model and its program

In a homogeneous population of size n0 with initially i0 infections the probability of noninfection for any susceptible member of the population is q = q0i0 where q0 = 1 − p0 and
p0 = r0 /n0 is the probability of infection in a homogeneous population of size n0 with
reproduction number r0 . The total number of new infections i among the n = n0 − i0
susceptibles is binomial-(n, p) with p = 1 − q. This yields a recursion starting with
n = n0 , i = i0 . In R the recursion consists of three commands:
n<- n-i;

p<- 1-q0^i;

i<- rbinom(1,n,p);

The sequence of commands runs while i is positive. The total number infected is j =
n0 − n. This is the binomial or Reed-Frost model. In her exposition of this model in 1952
Abbey 6 writes: “Epidemics can be calculated stepwise from this model, with the aid of
random numbers and a table of the cumulative binomial distribution (National Bureau of
Standards, 1949)” and then explains how to use the seven digit tables of random numbers
to create realizations of binomial variables and by repetition realizations of the epidemic,
closing with the advice: “For values beyond the range of the binomial tables, the Poisson
or normal distributions may be used as approximations to the binomial.” Seventy years
later for population size n0 = 3 ∗ 106 a batch of a hundred thousand simulations takes 72
seconds on a ten year old iMac OS 10.11.6 with a 3.06 GHz Intel Core processor and 1067
MHz DDR3 memory modules in two out of four memory slots. The program determines
the mean and sd of j, the total number infected. If the initial number of infections is small
the epidemic may die out, but for i0 = 300 initial infections each of the 105 simulations
gives rise to a full blown epidemic.

2 THE MODEL AND ITS PROGRAM

5

The program for the multitype binomial model is similar. Start with a population
n0 = (106 , 2 ∗ 106 ) of a million vulnerable and two million fit persons and i0 = (100, 200)
initial infections, a hundred among the vulnerable and two hundred among the fit. The
probability that the infection will die out may be neglected. The reproduction number r0
now becomes a matrix R which is akin to the transition matrix in a Markov chain where
the kth row contains the probabilities pk,m of a transition from state k to m. We first
look at a specific case, the standard model discussed in the introduction:
 


0.5 0.2
rv,v rv,f
=
.
R=
0.2 1.1
rf,v rf,f

(2.1)

The first row states that ten infectious vulnerable persons will infect on average five
vulnerable and two fit persons. The second row states that similarly ten infectious fit
persons will infect on average two vulnerable and eleven fit persons.
For a vulnerable person the probability of not being infected is qv = (1 − rv,v /nv )iv ∗
(1 − rf,v /nv )if . A similar expression hold for a fit person. The counterpart of the constant
q0 = 1 − r0 /n0 in the homogeneous model is the matrix:


1 − R[1, 1]/n0 [1] 1 − R[1, 2]/n0 [2]
.
Q=
1 − R[2, 1]/n0 [1] 1 − R[2, 2]/n0 [2]

(2.2)

The program for a simulation of the epidemic in the multitype model then is:
n<- n0; i<- i0;
while(max(i)>0){
n<- n-i;
q1<- Q[1,1]^i[1]*Q[2,1]^i[2]; q2<- Q[1,2]^i[1]*Q[2,2]^i[2];
i[1]<- rbinom(1,n[1],1-q1); i[2]<- rbinom(1,n[2],1-q2)}
j<- n0-n;

green curve describes the epidemic for the vulnerable, the red curve for the fit.
For a batch of a hundred thousand simulations of the epidemic we compute the mean
µ of j = n0 − n, the total number of infections, the covariance matrix, the sd σ of the
components jv and jf and the correlation ρ:
µ = (180387, 543119)

σ = (1362, 3988)

ρ = 0.88.

The mean number of deaths is 1803.9 + 543.1 = 2347.0. The sd of the mean is 0.054.
Compare this to the situation of complete mixing. The reproduction matrix

There are two parameters. Recall that the parameter a = rv,f denotes the number of fit
persons infected by an infectious vulnerable person; the parameter c = rf,v the number
of vulnerables infected by an infectious fit person. The parameter c varies over [0, 0.8] for
six values of a, a = 0, 0.1, . . . , 0.5 in Figure 2, left. This figure and Figure 3 show plots
of the number of deaths for the whole population (solid curves) and for the vulnerable
(dotted curves). The solid and dotted horizontal lines indicate the number of deaths in the
corresponding homogeneous models with r0 = 1.1 (Figure 2, left), r0 = 1 (Figure 3, left),
and r0 = 0.95 (Figure 3,right). For r0 = 1.1 the homogeneous model yields a mortality
of 2123.9 of which the majority, 5/6, is vulnerable. The mortality for the homogeneous
model with r0 = 1 is 168.7 and for r0 = 0.95 it is 23.4. This paper focuses on the
supercritical case r0 = 1.1.

The plot for rv = 0.8 and rf = 1.1 with r0 = 1, Figure 3, left, paints a darker picture.
For a = 0.2 (green curve) and c = 0.1 the overall death toll is twice as high as in the
homogeneous case. Mortality among the fit is one third of the total rather than one sixth
as in the homogeneous case. The reason for this behaviour? In the heterogeneous case
there will be a full blown epidemic among the fit because rf = 1.05 > 1. The constant
c = rf,v > 0 will pull the vulnerable into the epidemic. The overall reproduction number
here has the critical value r0 = 1. In the homogeneous model epidemics will be short and
die out.
The right side of Figure 3 shows the subcritical case, r0 = 0.95. The adverse effects
of shielding the vulnerable here are already apparent for c = 0. The mortality curves are
decreasing. The excess death toll is small, less than ten. It is of little interest since it
reflects the size of the contiguous initial infection rather than of the population.

In all three figures the situation brightens for c in the upper half of the interval [0, 0.8].
The total mortality decreases dramatically as c → 0.8. The low mortality for R(0.2, 0.8)
on first sight is a mystery. A large value rf,v = 0.8 indicates many infections from fit to
vulnerable. Why should the mortality almost vanish? Restrict attention to the fit. First
assume a = rv,f = 0. The top row of R then is (0.7, 0), but if we turn to the fit we see
that the infections will die out since 0.5 < 1. There also are infections from the fit to the
vulnerable, but these do not concern the fit since we have assumed that the vulnerable
do not infect the fit, a = rv,f = 0. The infections among the vulnerable will also die out
(since rv,v = 0.7 < 1), apart from the import from the fit, but the import will die down as
the epidemic among the fit dies out. If a = rv,f is positive this will not alter the situation

Discussion

One cannot argue with the result of a computation. One can argue about the interpretation. We restrict the discussion to two topics.
1) How realistic are our assumptions on the entries of the reproduction matrix?
In the basic model the reproduction matrix is

 

rv,v rv,f
0.7 − a
a
=
.
R = R(a, c) = 
rf,v rf,f
c
1.3 − c
A vulnerable infectious person infects on average 0.7 persons of whom a are fit; a fit
infectious person infects on average 1.3 persons of whom c are vulnerable. Infection is due
to contact. Social contacts of the healthy and young are more varied and more intense
than for the old or sick. This difference has increased as the vulnerable have become
more aware of their vulnerability. Human beings are social animals, but older people are
perhaps better able to endure solitude and live with their thoughts and memories than
the young. A factor 1.3/0.7 ≈ 2 may be excessive. In the example for the critical case,
r0 = 1, the factor is less, 1.05/0.9. The effect is similar.
In mathematics it is good practice to vary one variable at a time. The effect depends
on the variables which are kept constant. If one entry of the reproduction matrix goes
down and the other three are constant the epidemic will be less severe. In a partition
the lockdown for the vulnerable becomes stricter while at the same time it is relaxed for
the fit. This approach makes it natural to assume rf and rv to be constant. We then

4 DISCUSSION

11

compare the results of the epidemic for various values of rf,v and rv,f . The homogeneous
population with reproduction number r0 = (rv + 2rf )/3 is the benchmark. This value
of r0 is somewhat arbitrary. It is not the reproduction number of the two type model.
That depends on the proportion between the vulnerable and the fit among the infected.
Figure 6 shows that this proportion varies in the course of the epidemic.
The standard value rv,f = a = 0.2 is on the low side, but the graphs of the mortality
for a = 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5 all have the same shape. The assumption that one is free
to vary c = rf,v is more problematic. The relation between the cross infection constants
a = rv,f and c = rf,v is obscure. Contact is symmetric. Person A is within two meters
of person B if and only if person B is within two meters of person A. If one replaces the
infection rates rv,f and rf,v by contact rates cv,f and cf,v then symmetry of contact implies
the conservation law: nf cf,v = nv cv,f . Contact is symmetric, but its effect on infection not.
A healthy young person will cough with more force than a feeble old person. This may
make the fit more infectious than the vulnerable. Thus there are indications that adults
infect children but children hardly infect adults 7,8,9 . (There also is contrary evidence 10 .)
There are more reasons for a lack of symmetry. If the vulnerable are tested at regular
intervals and visits are only allowed when the test result is negative this will not affect
rf,v , but it will reduce the value of rv,f and hence increase the parameter t in Figure 4.
A representative list of pairs, infector and infectee, together with age and medical
condition, might help to determine the role of the values of t > 0.5 in figure 4.
2) Do the results apply to real life?
The proportion of vulnerable to fit is 1:2. This is realistic for the Netherlands and
perhaps for Italy and Japan. In countries with a younger population a proportion of 1:3
might be more appropriate. The population size is immaterial. The number of initial
cases (100, 200) reflects the proportion of the vulnerable to the fit and is chosen large in
order that the simulations all show full blown epidemics when the reproduction number
is 1.05 or higher. The IFR of 0.004 is on the low side. It does not affect the results of the
paper. The factor 10 between the IFR of 0.01 for the vulnerable and 0.001 for the fit is
on the high side. The reader is invited to investigate the effect of increasing the IFR for

5 CONCLUSION

12

the fit to 0.004.
What happens if one replaces the Reed-Frost model by a more realistic model? The
assumption in the homogeneous model that everyone has the same probability of being
infected is not realistic. In the two type model there is a reproduction matrix with four
entries. If the more realistic model allows one to specify such a matrix, then – as in
the Reed-Frost model – the maximal eigenvalue and the corresponding left eigenvector
will determine the severity of the epidemic and the proportion of vulnerable to the fit
among the infected. In the more realistic model the infection curves in Figure 6 will have
different shapes, but their relation to the dotted lines associated with the eigenvectors
will be the same; the positions of the points describing the total number infected will
change, but the shape of the curve which they form might well again be a question mark.
This is speculation. Whether the suppositions hold can only be determined by doing the
necessary simulations and observations.

Conclusion

The results presented in this article are indicative rather than descriptive. They suggest
that our intuition fails us in understanding how the parameters of the reproduction matrix
affect the outcome of an epidemic in a population divided into two classes, the vulnerable
and the fit. It only takes a little effort to run the Reed-Frost model on a pc and simulate
two type epidemics. Speed makes this model a viable alternative to our intuition. It may
be a better guide to reality.

6 A NON-TECHNICAL EXPLANATION OF THE DECREASE IN MORTALITY 14

Supplementary material

A non-technical explanation of the decrease in mortality

The conclusion that the mortality may be reduced by increasing the transmission of
Covid-19 from the fit to the vulnerable is hard to swallow. For a mathematician the
eigenvalue argument may be convincing. For computing the eigenvalues and eigenvectors
high school mathematics suffices. One has to solve a quadratic equation and a system of
two linear equations. These calculations will not convince the general reader. Here is a
more intuitive argument:
Consider a billowing cloud of viruses in the region of the fit, a cloud which doubles in
size every few days. In the region of the vulnerable the cloud of viruses shrinks and will
fade away. Now assume the excess of viruses produced in the region of the fit every day
is diverted to a region which is less hospitable and where the viruses will die out. The
cloud in the region of the fit no longer grows. If one increases the part which is diverted
by a fraction the cloud of viruses in the region of the fit will shrink at an exponential
rate. This will be the case even if some of the viruses manage to find their way back to
the region of the fit.
Can one arrange things such that in the region of the vulnerable the cloud will fade
away in spite of the influx from the region of the fit? One may argue that the influx is only
temporary since the cloud in the region of the fit will fade away at an exponential rate,
and so will the fraction which is diverted to the region of the susceptible. The situation
becomes less clear if a fraction of the cloud above the region of the susceptible manages
to return to the region of the fit. In order to handle the situation where there is traffic
between the two regions in both directions we have to be more specific. It helps to look
at steady states. We give two examples. In both cases the top row of the matrix R is
(0.5, 0.2). The bottom row is (c, 1.3 − c).

Figure 5: Realizations of the epidemic ik (v) (green) and ik (f ) (red) for rv,f = 0.2 and
rf,v = 0.5 with a mean of 214.8 + 21.8 deaths on the left and rf,v = 0.8 with a mean of
23.1 + 1.3 deaths on the right.
Example 1 First assume c = 0.5. Consider a situation where a thousand fit are infectious
and a thousand vulnerable. The thousand vulnerable infect 500 vulnerable and 200 fit;
the thousand fit infect c ∗ 1000 = 500 vulnerable and (1.3 − c) ∗ 1000 = 800 fit. The result
is a thousand new infections among the vulnerable and a thousand among the fit. At first
sight nothing changes. But since there is a growing number of immune persons the new
number of infectious persons decreases at an ever accelerating rate and the epidemic will
die out.

♦

Example 2 Take c = 0.8. Let there be two thousand infectious vulnerable and a thousand fit. A calculation as above shows that these infect one thousand eight hundred
vulnerable and nine hundred fit. The proportion 2 : 1 between the vulnerable and the fit
is preserved. In this case the epidemic dies out at an exponential rate.

♦

The pairs (1000, 1000) and (2000, 1000) are called eigenvectors of the corresponding
matrices R(0.2, 0.5) and R(0.2, 0.8) and the factors 1.0 and 0.9 linking the number of new
infections to the old are called the eigenvalues. Figure 5 shows a realisation of each of

these two type binomial epidemics. The proportions (1 : 1) and (2 : 1) are clearly visible
in the number of infections of the vulnerable and the fit.

Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the reproduction
matrix

Replace the binomial variables in (2.3) by their expectations to obtain the deterministic
mean process with
(i[1], i[2]) = (n[1] ∗ (1 − q1 ), n[2] ∗ (1 − q2 )).

(7.7)

The sequence of successive infections ~ik = (ik [v], ik [f ]) form the infection curve.
The entries 1 − Q[i, j] = Ri,j /n0 [j] in (2.2) are of the order of 10−6 . This suggests the
approximation (1 − (1 − p)i ) ≈ ip and hence the recursion
~ik+1 = ~ik ∗ R ∗ Dk+1

Dk+1 = diag(~nk+1 /~n0 )

~nk+1 = ~nk − ~ik .

(7.8)

The new value ~ik+1 of the vector ~i is written as a linear transformation Rk+1 of the old
value ~ik = (ik [v], ik [f ]), where Rk+1 = RDk+1 is a modulation of the reproduction matrix.
The key to linear dynamical systems ~xk+1 = ~xk R is the left eigenvector associated
with the largest eigenvalue. In the multitype epidemic the maximal eigenvalue of the
reproduction matrix R determines the severity of the epidemic; the corresponding left
eigenvector determines the proportion of vulnerable to fit among the infected.
These words should not be taken literally. The relation between the eigenvalues and
eigenvectors of the reproduction matrix R and the course of the epidemic is not perfect
as one sees on comparing the curves on the left side and the right side in Figure 2. The
coordinates associated with the left eigenvectors of R make R diagonal but destroy the
diagonality of the modulator Dk+1 in the recursion (7.8).
Figure 6 attempts to give an impression of the changes in the epidemic as the parameter
c in the matrix R(0.2, c) in (3.5) varies from 0 to 1 over the twelve values listed above
the plot. For each c the infection curve starts at ~i0 = (100, 200) and finally moves off

to (0, 0) after attaining values which may be in excess of ten thousand, and the dot
~jc = (jc [v], jc [f ]) depicts the total number of infections. The logarithmic scale on the
two axes allows us to compress all this information into one figure. The logarithmic scale
transforms rays y = cx in the positive quadrant into lines log10 y = log10 x+log10 c parallel
to the diagonal. Each dotted line corresponds to the ray through the left eigenvector ~ec
associated with the maximal eigenvalue of R(0.2, c). Note that the quotient ik [v]/ik [f ]
starts at 1/2 for k = 0, quickly approaches the quotient ec [v]/ec [f ] of the eigenvector,
and then slowly backs off towards 1/2. As a result the quotient jc [v]/jc [f ] lies between
ec [v]/ec [f ] and 1/2. Only the light blue infection curve (for c = 0.3) lies on the line
associated with the eigenvector and so does the light blue point depicting the total number
of infections. That is because the vector (1, 2) is a left eigenvector of the matrix R(0.2, c)
for c = 0.3. The coloured points form a question mark. As c moves away from zero
the total number of infections among the vulnerable, jc [v], increases rapidly, while the
number among the fit decreases. The logarithmic scale makes it impossible to see what
happens to the sum jc [v] + jc [f ]. However beyond the orange point (c = 0.25) both jc [v]
and jc [f ] decrease as c increases. The number of infections among the vulnerable, jc [v]
decreases from slightly more than a hundred thousand to slightly more than a thousand.
A policy directed at shielding the vulnerable should try to maximize the value of c = rf,v
for the given boundary conditions rf = 1.3, rv = 0.7, rv,f = 0.2. Lines parallel to the
diagonal through the coloured points drift to the South East as c increases. The proportion
of deaths for the vulnerable and the fit, dc [v]/dc [f ] = 10jc [v]/jc [f ], increases steadily
from 0.002 to 22 as c moves from 0 to 1. This may be expressed in the oracular rule:
“Sacrifice the vulnerable to save the vulnerable.”
For the homogeneous Reed-Frost model there exists 4 a simple and intuitive good approximation τ = τ (r0 ) to the fraction j/n0 of infected when the reproduction number
r0 exceeds 1. It solves the equation 1 − τ = e−r0 τ . Such a simple expression for the
number infected is not available for multitype models. One may use τ = τ (ρ), where ρ
is the largest eigenvalue of the reproduction matrix R, to estimate the total number of
infections and use the corresponding left eigenvector to divide these among the vulnerable

and the fit:
(jv , jf ) = ~i0 + τ (ρ) ∗ (n0 [v] − i0 [v] + n0 [f ] − i0 [f ]) ∗ ~e/(e[1] + e[2]).

(7.9)

This ad hoc estimate is not very accurate.
Our benchmark is the mean value of (jv , jf ) for a hundred thousand simulations of the
stochastic Reed-Frost model (RF). The table below lists estimates of the death toll for
the two type model with reproduction matrix R(0.2, c) for various values of c. It gives an
indication of the accuracy of the three models E, L, D defined by (7.9), (7.8) and (7.7)
compared to the stochastic model RF in (2.3).
