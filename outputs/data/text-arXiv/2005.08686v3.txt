We present a phenomenological procedure of dealing with the COVID–19 data provided by government health agencies of eleven different countries. Instead of using the (exact or approximate)
solutions to the SIR (or other) model(s) to fit the data by adjusting the time–independent parameters included in those models, we introduce dynamical parameters whose time–dependence may
be phenomenologically obtained by adequately extrapolating a chosen subset of the daily provided
data. This phenomenological approach works extremely well to properly adjust the number of infected (and removed) individuals in time, for the countries we consider. Besides, it can handle the
sub–epidemic events that some countries may experience. In this way, we obtain the evolution of
the pandemic without using any a priori model based on differential equations.

INTRODUCTION

Pandemic propagation models are usually described by
systems of first order ordinary non–linear coupled differential equations such as it is the case for the well–known
SIS and SIR models, for instance. Numerous classical as
well as very recent articles have been written to deal with
this problem [1–9]. The dynamical variables in such models are usually denoted by S(t), I(t) and R(t), which are
functions of a single time variable t and denote the number of susceptible individuals (which may get infected),
the number of infected individuals and the number of recovered or removed individuals (which some time after
becoming infected are either immune or dead), respectively.
In addition to the dynamical variables, the models introduce time–independent parameters (usually denoted
by greek letters) which describe the intensity of the coupling between the variables. These parameters clearly
depend on the behavior of quarantined people in different countries which, in turn depend on the containment
policies implemented by different governments in different countries.
It is not difficult to realize when trying to fit the data
informed by health governmental institutions of different
countries that they cannot be fitted by solutions of the
model’s equations for time–independent parameters, due
to the fact that the policies change over time and so does
the behavior of the societies. Strictly speaking, the so–
called parameters are really dynamical variables whose
time evolution equations are difficult to hypothesize or
construct due to the fact that their time evolution de-

pends on people idiosyncrasy and government policies,
which are almost impossible to foresee. In order to overcome this issue, some (or all) of the parameters in those
pandemic models can be promoted to time–dependent
variables (see, for example, Refs. [10–21]). However, the
exact time dependence is still unknown in those new variables, and the evolution of the pandemic is still very sensitive to the used model.
Because of these difficulties, in this work we propose an
analysis on the study of the daily change of such parameters in order to retrieve the dynamical information of a
pandemic. The estimation of the time–dependence behavior of the parameters of epidemiological models have
been an active research field in the past [10–21]. However,
our procedure is different to previous ones, as it does not
require any set of differential equations as a model. Instead of studying the total data set that gives origin to
total structure of the pandemic, we focus in the study of
time evolution of the parameters that produce such total
structure, i.e., we do a meta–analysis of the data set system. Therefore, rather than solving a model described
by a set of differential equations with solutions that fit
the data, a meta–analysis proceeds in the opposite direction, finding the global evolution of the parameters, and
thus obtaining a model. This procedure allows us to find
the global dynamical behavior of data by studying the
day-to-day evolution of the adjustment parameters. In
this way, we can extract the time-dependent information
of the system without solving any differential equation
set. Hence, we are able to solve the system in a phenomenological fashion. This proper meta–analysis of the
adjustment parameters can provide the kind of information that is needed in order to have a better understanding of the evolution of the pandemic. The main goal of
this work is to show that this procedure gives us global
information of the changes in the spread of the disease.
The adjustment parameters in this meta–analysis,

2
hereafter called meta–parameters, are no longer considered as constants, and they can be extracted directly
from the data information. It is the purpose of this work
to delineate a systematic procedure to estimate the dynamics of meta–parameters. We show how these meta–
parameters substantially improve the understanding of
the global evolution of the pandemic. This is exemplified
for the case of actual current data from eleven countries.
These are Italy, United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Spain, Poland, Austria, Germany, Portugal, New
Zealand and France.
In order to put our proposal in context, let us consider
first the SIR model as an example for pandemic evolution.
This model considers three kind of populations, the susceptible S = S(t), the infected I = I(t) and the recovered
R = R(t) population, respectively, all of them evolving
in time. Besides, the total population N = S + I + R,
is constant in time. The three variables are related by
the differential system Ṡ = −αSI, I˙ = αSI − βI, and
Ṙ = βI (where Ȧ(t) ≡ dA(t)/dt). Here, α and β are constant parameters that contain the relevant information
for pandemic evolution. Our lack of knowledge on how
the pandemic evolves is hidden in such parameters. Although no explicit exact solution for R = R(t) is known,
it is straightforward to show that at second order in an
expansion around αR/β, we can obtain the solution for
the recovered population as a function of time [22, 23],
given by R(t) ≈ r1 tanh(r2 t − r3 ) + r4 . Here, r1 =
γβ 2 /(α2 S0 ), r2 = βγ/2, r3 = tanh−1 (αS0 /(βγ) − 1/γ),
and r4 = β/α − β 2 /(α2 S0 ), are all constants, in terms

1/2
of γ = (αS0 /β − 1)2 + 2S0 I0 α2 /β 2
, where S0 and
I0 are the initial values of susceptible and infected populations at t = 0. It has been assumed that the initial value of the recovered population R0 = 0. It is
important to realize that the system is now completely
solved, as the infected population can be readily obtained by I(t) = Ṙ/β ≈ (r1 γ/2)sech2 (r2 t − r3 ), while
the susceptible population is S(t) = N − I(t) − R(t).
Those solutions are often used to study in an approximated manner the pandemic evolution. However, they
fail to describe correctly its dynamics when social conditions change or different governmental decisions are taken
along the progress of the pandemic.
In the following sections we show how better fitting
results can be achieved by the procedure of using a hyperbolic tangent function to fit the data of recovered
population during the pandemic, as a starting point for
the procedure using meta–parameters. The evolution of
these meta–parameters is obtained by analyzing day-byday the same data that they adjust. This procedure gives
a precise figure of the increment of infected individuals.
Therefore, the meta–analysis produces a better fitting of
the estimation of the temporal behavior of infected population, thus solving the pandemic dynamics in a phenomenological way. The final solution obtained from the
data fitting procedure will not be a solution of the SIR
model, neither of any other simple model described by
first-order differential equations.

PHENOMENOLOGICAL TREATMENT FOR
PANDEMIC DYNAMICS

In this section we describe the phenomenological procedure to estimate the evolution of the infected population.
We start with the data set Rj for the recovered population at day j, with j = 1, ..., N measuring lapsed days,
with a final day N . The information of this data set is
equivalent to the cumulative integral or sum of infected
cases. The data are obtained from Ref. [24]. By using the
information in Rj , we can infer the infected population
data as
Ij = Rj − Rj−1 ,

(1)

at day j. For this work, we have used data of Ref. [24]
until June 19th, 2020.
For such given data set for the recovered population,
a global dynamical behavior can be found by fitting the
curve Rj → R(t), where now the continuous recovered
population function is given by
R(t) = a (tanh (b t + c) − tanh c) + R0 ,

(2)

where a, b and c are global constant adjustment parameters, and we have assumed that the relevant data to
perform any analysis start with R0 6= 0, by properly setting the initial time t = 0 of our analysis. By global we
refer that the adjustment is for the total lapsed time N .
Notice that recovered population curve (2) is not equal
to the approximated solution emerging from the SIR system. We show below that (2) is a good global fitting for
the recovered population. On the other hand, the global
infected population dynamics is assumed to be found as
Ij → I(t) = Ṙ(t), which gives
I(t) = a b sech2 (b t + c) ,

(3)

Now, let us perform the meta–analysis of fitting (2)
for the recovered population. Let us promote the three
parameters used in (2) to meta–parameters a → a1 (t),
b → a2 (t), and c → a3 (t). These meta–parameters are
no longer global constants. Their dynamics must be obtained considering the new information that brings any
new day that it is added to the data set of recovered
population. For each time j (j = 1, ..., N ), the meta–
parameters ai (i = 1, 2, 3) are found by fitting the curve
(2) to the data, by using them as constant adjustment
parameters for such time. As the amount of data grows
with time, the value of each meta–parameter varies, taking into account the different behaviors that the governments or the society may have at different times. After
several iterations are performed for different times and
fitting curves (2), a regular and dynamical behavior of
each meta–parameter starts to emerge. This regularity
starts at some time τ for the three meta–parameters, and
it depends on each particular studied case. All of this implies that meta–parameters are not globally constant in
time, and now their global time–dependence ai = ai (t) is
apparent, and more important, it can be deduced.

3
Once this stage is reached, the complete dynamical
solution for each meta–parameter is established, and solution (2) for the recovered population can now be promoted to the function
RM (t) = a1 (t) [tanh (a2 (t) t − a3 (t)) − tanh (a3 (t))]−R0 ,
(4)
which produces a dramatic departure from solution (2)
itself.
With all the above, the new meta–parameter fitting
function (4) contains more precise information of the
daily changes of the recovered population compared with
the fitting function (2). In other words, its derivative
represents a more accurate description of the infected
population curve, which can be calculated as
IM (t) = ṘM (t) ,

(5)

which anew, turns out to be different from function (3).
It is shown below, that when meta–parameters have
achieved a regular dynamics, they all can be described in
the form (i = 1, 2, 3)
ai (t) ≈

Z
X

aki tk ,

(6)

k=0

with constant coefficients aki , and Z > 0. Several meta–
analysis produce very good agreement with the data for
Z = 2. On the other hand, and remarkably, to describe
the sub–epidemic behavior of different countries, it is
enough to consider Z = 4. This shows that any change
in the information of the data evolves in an ordered way
and it can be recovered through the study of the meta–
parameters.
In order to quantify how both infected population fittings differ from each other, we define the global adjustment function  = EM /EC , as the ratio between
PN
2
EM =
j=2 [IM (j) − Ij ] , which is the error function
for the meta–analysis of infected population (5), and
PN
2
EC =
j=2 [I(j) − Ij ] , that is the error function for
the fitting of infected population (3) with constant adjustment parameters. The case of  < 1 implies a better
fitting curve for the infected population dynamics due to
the meta–analysis.
Below, we present examples for different countries that
explicitly show the strength of this phenomenological dynamical analysis, and its better fitting to the existent
data. It is the goal of this work to search for the explicit
form of each meta–parameter for the studied countries,
finding in this way the underlying dynamical structure
of their pandemic scenarios, and thus determine RM and
IM . Besides, we show that this phenomenological model
can also take into consideration the sub–epidemics ocurring during the whole time lapsed for the pandemic in
some countries. The sub–epidemic behavior is coded in
the time dependence of meta–parameters.
With all this in mind, let us discuss the pandemic data
for cumulative infectious cases as evolving in time for

eleven different countries, and how the phenomenological
dynamical procedure applies to each of them. We use
the case of Italy to carefully explain each step in the
procedure, as it is straightforwardly replicated for the
other country cases.

A.

Italy

The data for the recovered population in Italy is shown
by the dotted line in Fig. 1(a), with N = 119. The
red-dashed line shows the fitting of function (2), with
parameters R0 = 17, a = 120072, b = 0.04143 and c =
−1.74422.
Consider now the blue solid line in Fig. 1(a). It describes the meta–analysis fitting (4) for the recovered
population since the day τ = 43. This is the day in
which the meta–parameters start to behave regularly,
as it can be seen in Fig. 2(a). The meta–parameters
are calculated for each day (from t = 0 for R0 ), taking into account all previous days. Thus, each new
calculated meta–parameter contains the information of
any previous change. Before day τ , there is no regular
pattern in the evolution of meta–parameter. But, after day τ , a very distinctive regular dynamical behavior
emerge. For the current case, after day τ = 43, the meta–
parameters a1 (t), a2 (t), and a3 (t) time–dependence behavior (6) is obtained for Z = 4, shown by red lines
in Fig. 2(a). As an example for this case, we display
the coefficients of the form (6). These are a01 = 15076,
a11 = −21.2629, a21 = 54.6027, a31 = 0.68966, a41 =
0.00248, a02 = 0.21857, a12 = −0.00426, a22 = 0.000028,
a32 = 2.97537, a42 = −5.8174 × 10−10 , a03 = −4.25959,
a13 = 0.02251, a23 = 0.00063, a33 = −9.8595 × 10−6 , and
a43 = 3.7844 × 10−8 . These meta–parameters are used
in (4) to obtain the solid blue fit in Fig. 1(a).
Notice that the fitting precision for the slope of the
recovered population becomes more accurate as it grows,
i.e., a better fit for its derivative is achieved, compared to
fitting (2). This implies that it contains better information on the the number of infected individuals. This is
shown in Fig. 1(b), where the data represented by dots is
the infected population calculated according to Eq. (1).
The red dashed line is the infected population fit (3),
with their respectively parameters. Notice also that this
fit is just proportional to the approximated solution for
infected population in the SIR model. On the other hand,
the solid blue line in Fig. 1(b) corresponds to the meta–
analysis fitting (5) for infected population, with meta–
parameters described by the above coefficients. This fitting reproduces better the global behavior of the evolution of infected population in Italy, just by considering
the last part of the growing on recovered cases (for times
t > τ ).
The evaluation of the global adjustment function gives
 = 0.39021, allowing us to establish that the meta–
parameter fitting for infected population is superior to
fit (3).

B.

United States

The recovered population for United States is shown
in Fig. 1(c). The data with N = 120 is represented by
a dotted line, while the red dashed line shows the fitting
(2), with parameters R0 = 16, a = 243386, b = 0.11813,
c = −4.93365. The blue solid line is the fitting (4) since
τ = 45, when the meta–parameters start to have a regular evolution (6) with Z = 2, as it can be seen in Fig. 2(b)
in red line [25].
In this case, something similar to the previous case
occurs. The fitting (4), with their respective meta–
parameters, is not much better than fit (2) for the recovered population. However, its slope is in much better
agreement with the growing rate for the recovered data.
This implies that our meta–analysis gives a better fit for
the infected population, compared to the extracted data
from Eq. (1). This can be seen in Fig. 1(d). In this case,
the red dashed line represents the fitting (3) for infected
population, while blue solid line is our meta-analysis fitting (5) using meta–parameters (6).
The fit due to meta–parameters is so dramatic, that
when the global solution (3) shows a decreasing on infected population, the meta–analysis shows that the rate
is not slowed down, but it is increasing. For times
t ' 80, our meta–analysis has been able to extract the
information of the sub–epidemics occuring during the
complete time scale of the pandemic. Sub–epidemics
are ussually modelled as overlaping of several epidemic
episodes. These are usually described as multimodal
epidemic events satisfying coupled differential equation
models [19]. However, in our meta–analysis model, a
large sub–epidemic behavior emerge from the study of
the evolution of meta–parameters, without invoking any
specific model designed to described these kind of epidemics. This is a strength of our model, as no a priori
knowledge of the evolution of the pandemic is needed in
order to discover the sub–epidemic events in a society.
In the case of United States, this sub–epidemic event is
happening right now.
Furthermore, the meta–analysis fitting is better than
model (3), as the global adjustment function is  =
0.27888.

C.

Canada

The recovered population data for Canada is shown
with the dotted line in Fig. 1(e). The red dashed line is
the fit of Eq. (2) with N = 114 and parameters R0 = 12,
a = −50965.9, b = 0.03536, and c = −2.20783.
Anew, the blue solid line is our meta–analysis fitting
(4), using the meta–parameters that are described by a
regular dynamics (6), with Z = 4 and starting in τ = 33,
as red lines in Figs. 2(c). The blue solid line for recovered
cases indicates a better approximation to the growing
(slope) of such data.
The infected population is depicted in Fig. 1(f), where

the data is obtained from (1), while in red dashed line is
the fitting (3), and in blue solid line we have the fitting
(5) with the meta–parameters. Once again, the meta–
analysis shows several sub–epidemics events, that cannot be obtained by fitting (3). This sub-epidemics appears only when the time–dependent evolution of meta–
parameter of Figs. 2(c) are found.
Finally, with  = 0.81282 for this case, the meta–
analysis represents a better fit to the global evolution
of infected population.

D.

United Kingdom

The recovered population data is shown in Fig. 1(g),
while the infected population data is shown in Fig. 1(h),
both of them in dotted lines. The recovered population
data fit (2), in red line in Fig. 1(g), is achieved with N =
113 and parameters R0 = 16, a = 149676, b = 0.03791,
and c = −2.21432.
The blue solid line in Fig. 1(g), represents the fit of
meta–analysis (4) for meta–parameters (6) that have
achieved regular evolution for τ = 35 and Z = 2 [see
Figs. 2(d)]. The information in the meta–analysis is used
for infected population in comparison with data (1). In
Fig. 1(h), the solid blue line for meta–parameters fitting (5) shows a better correspondence than fit (3) with
constant parameters. This is confirmed by evaluating
 = 0.84056.

E.

Spain

In Fig. 3(a) we show the recovered population data
(in dotted line). The red dashed line is the fitting (2)
for recovered population with N = 114, and parameters
R0 = 9, a = 119352, b = 0.05597, and c = −2.07708.
Similarly, the blue solid line is fitting (4) with meta–
parameters (6) with Z = 4, and starting in τ = 35. We
can see in Fig. 4(a) that the meta–parameters are described by quartic functions.
Using this, we can calculate the behavior of the number
of the infected individuals, shown in Fig. 3(b) . The
infected population data (dotted line) is given by Eq. (1),
while fit (3) is in red dashed line and meta–analysis fit (5)
is in solid blue line. We obtain that  = 0.49292, showing
that the fit based in meta–parameters is again superior
to the one based in time–independent parameters.

F.

Poland

The data for the recovered population of Poland is
plotted in Fig. 3(c) in dotted line. Also, the red dashed
line fits Eq. (2) for the recovered population with N =
105, and parameters R0 = 5, a = 20169.1, b = 0.02011,
and c = −1.39525. The meta–analysis fitting (4) is in

5
blue line with the meta–parameters (6) from Fig. 4(b),
starting in τ = 35, with Z = 2.
This case is interesting as the slope of meta–analysis
fit (4) clearly shows that recovered population is increasing, as opposed to what can be deduced from fit
(2). Similarly, the infected population data, in Fig. 3(d),
shows a better agreement with the fit (5) due to meta–
parameters. While the fit (3) indicates a strong decreasing on infected population, the meta–analysis shows that
infected population is increasing due to sub–epidemic
events. A better fit of the meta–analysis is also corroborated by  = 0.65004.

G.

Austria

In Fig. 3(e) is the data for the recovered population
in Austria. In red dashed line is the fit (2) for N =
113 and parameters R0 = 5, a = 8152.2, b = 0.07569,
c = −2.33693. Similarly, the fit (4), in blue solid line,
requires the meta–parameters (6) show in Fig. 4(c), with
coefficients (6), starting from τ = 50, with Z = 2.
The meta–analysis fit indicates a better adjustment for
the infected population, as it is seen in Fig. 3(f). In that
figure, the red dashed line is the fit (3), and the blue
solid line is the fit (5). Notice that better adjustment of
the meta–analysis for the tail of the pandemic data, for
t > 60. The global dynamical behavior of the infected
population is better achieved by the meta–analysis, with
 = 0.51678

H.

Germany

The data for this country is shown in Figs. 3(g) and
3(h) for the data (dotted lines) of recovered and infected
populations, respectively. Red dashed lines represent the
fitting of (2) and (3) for both cases, with N = 115 and
R0 = 17, a = 90954.5, b = 0.05287, c = −2.12998. Blue
solid lines represent the meta–parameter fittings of recovered (4) and infected (5) populations, with respect to the
data (1). The meta–parameters (6) start from ζ = 40,
with Z = 4.
Once more, the fit (5) is better for infected population,
as  = 0.59191.

I.

Portugal

In Fig. 5(a) is shown the recovered cases in dotted line,
and the fitting (2) in red dashed line with N = 106 and
R0 = 9, a = 19109.7, b = 0.03079, and c = −1.25453.
Blue solid line is fit (4), with metaparamter shown in
Figs. 6(a), with τ = 26 and Z = 4. Similarly, we show
the different fitting (3) and (5) for infected populations
in Fig. 5(b). The meta–analysis produces a better fit, as
 = 0.50303.

Notice that, again, sub–epidemics events are present,
and they are apparent only through the known evolution
of meta–parameters.

J.

New Zealand

In Figs. 5(c) and (d) we show the recovered and infected population for New Zealand. In dotted lines
are the data, while the fitting (2) and (3) are in red
dashed line with N = 94 and R0 = 20, a = 606.56,
b = 0.10504, and c = −1.28409. The blue solid line is the
meta–analysis fitting (4) and (5), for meta–paramters of
Figs. 6(b), with Z = 2 and τ = 30.
This case is very interesting as it is the only one in
which the meta–analysis and the fitting with constant
parameters almost coincide (although the meta–analysis
is better with  = 0.88445). This is an indication of the
very good health policies adopted by the goverment to
deal with the pandemic and of the responsible behavior
of the society. In this (almost ideal) case, the evolution
of the infection variables behaves as a very precise mathematical model.

K.

France

The recovered and infected population data of the last
country we consider, France, are shown in Figs. 5(e) and
(f). The fitting (2) and (3) are in red dashed line with
N = 115 and R0 = 14, a = 75771.6, b = 0.04966, and
c = −2.09013. The data is in dotted lines.
Blue lines are fitting (4) and (5) with meta–paramters
from Figs. 6(c), with Z = 4 and τ = 39. Our meta–
analysis adjustment gives  = 0.77846, and it predicts a
slightly increase of the infected population.

III.

DISCUSSION

We have presented a new approach to deal with infection propagation data by allowing the parameters to
became time–dependent. Although we are not able to
produce a dynamical model for the parameters time evolution due to intrinsic difficulty associated with unforeseeable government policies and population behavior, we
have been able to produce a method that may be successfully applied to the actual data informed by eleven
different countries which have implemented different mitigation policies to fight the COVID-19 infection with different population reactions.
All of the cases of infected populations studied above
exhibit the same feature. The meta–analysis shows effectively the capture of the daily variations of cases. In
other words, we have shown that using meta–parameters
we can integrate the recovered population without using
any pre-existing model. Our proposal produces global results, as soon as the regular behavior of meta–parameter

6
are found. Thus, the meta–analysis works for all data,
and not only for an arbitrary particular range in the evolution of recovered cases, as for example, when the growing of recovered cases behave as a power-law [26]. This
proposed model can also detect sub–epidemic events occurring during the pandemic, which is done without the
assumption of any model based in differential equations.
Our model has two main key characteristics that need
to be considered in order to produce sensible results. The
first one is the starting model required to fit the data. In
our case, we use a tanh fit (2), but other more complex
models, as modified logistic ones, can be used as a starting point for the meta–analysis. This can improve the
fitting done by the meta–parameters. The second one is
the high sensitivity of our model to well–established data
for cases. The infection data that is informed in countries where the governments have not been able to handle
the pandemic or have introduced sudden infection related
policy changes, or where the population has not abided
by the government set containment rules, are difficult to

be described by the approach presented here (or almost
any other method). This is because no regularity can be
found when the meta–parameters are analyzed. This is
the case of, for example, Chile, where the health authorities policies designed to address the pandemic, and the
response of the society, have proved unsuccessful up to
now.
