A BSTRACT
In recent years, the prevalence of several pulmonary diseases, especially the coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) pandemic, has attracted worldwide attention. These diseases can be effectively diagnosed
and treated with the help of lung imaging. With the development of deep learning technology and
the emergence of many public medical image datasets, the diagnosis of lung diseases via medical
imaging has been further improved. This article reviews pulmonary CT and X-ray image detection
and classification in the last decade. It also provides an overview of the detection of lung nodules,
pneumonia, and other common lung lesions based on the imaging characteristics of various lesions.
Furthermore, this review introduces 26 commonly used public medical image datasets, summarizes
the latest technology, and discusses current challenges and future research directions.

Introduction

Diseases are the leading cause of death among humans; among the lethal human diseases listed by the World Health
Organization in 2016 [109], chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases and lower respiratory tract infections are the
third- and fourth-most fatal ones, and their ranks are higher than those of other terrifying diseases, such as acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome. Several pandemics, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2002, H1N1 influenza in
2009, Middle East respiratory syndrome in 2013, and Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2
in 2019, have led to numerous infections and deaths. In dealing with these diseases, pulmonary images have an
important role in fast diagnosis and evaluation. During the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic in various countries,
many patients with evident symptoms were not diagnosed in time because of the lack of detection kits, resulting in
great losses. In medical institutions, many pulmonary images are analyzed and evaluated manually. However, massive
images have brought exhausting work for doctors, especially during pandemics. In these cases, medical images cannot

be analyzed in time, leading to heavy losses and indirectly exacerbating the situation. At present, computed tomography
(CT) and X-ray images are commonly used as effective techniques for detecting lung diseases.
1.1

Previous Works

Many researchers contributed to studies on pulmonary lesion detection via lung medical imaging in the past few decades
[39, 80, 92]. With the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI), computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) has emerged
as an effective method based on medical image analysis. AI has changed from traditional machine learning methods
based on handcrafted feature descriptors to deep learning methods. In comparison with traditional machine learning
methods, the feature description and extraction of deep learning methods are integrated into model structures, and more
abundant and discriminative features can be learned automatically. These changes have been applied to the development
of medical image processing [39, 80]. Hu et al. [39] summarized the applications of deep learning in cancer detection
and diagnosis. Chunli et al. [80] conducted a survey of AI-based CAD with chest X-ray images. Feng et al. [92]
reviewed the application of AI techniques in COVID-19 segmentation and diagnosis.

Contributions of this Paper

With the rapid technological development and the current COVID-19 pandemic, recent studies should be reviewed and
summarized for future treatments. As such, this review focuses on methods based on CT and X-ray images for the
detection and classification of pulmonary lesions and summarizes the pulmonary CT and X-ray image datasets obtained
in the last decade. The main contributions of this review are presented as follows.
• Classify researches on the basis of different lesions. Considering that the features of different lesions are
distinct, this paper is organized in the order of cancer, pneumonia, tuberculosis (TB), and other diseases. This
structure makes the paper comprehensive.
• Summarize the researches by CT and X-ray. CT and X-ray are commonly used radiological methods in lung
disease diagnosis. Evaluation results are not comparable because of the different formats of images. As a
result, the sections of different lesions are organized in the order of CT and X-ray.
• Introduce the latest researches on COVID-19 in 2020. The classification and detection of COVID-19 have
become the hotspot of medical imaging research because of the serious COVID-19 situation worldwide. As
such, some representative studies published until the first week of May are introduced.
This review is organized as follows. Section 2 covers the identification and localization techniques of lung nodules,
tumors, cancer, pneumonia (including COVID-19), TB, and other common lung lesions. Section 3 introduces 26
commonly used public lung CT and X-ray datasets, including competition datasets, and lists several self-built datasets.
Section 4 discusses the problems existing in current data resources, summarizes the challenges in current research, and
proposes the expectations for the future architecture. Section 5 provides the conclusion of this article.

Technology and Application

According to the types of lung diseases and their imaging characteristics, these diseases are classified into three
categories, namely, pulmonary nodules, pneumonia, and lung TB, and other lung diseases. In addition, CT and X-ray
images have their unique characteristics, and their processing ideas and algorithm models vary to some extent. Therefore,
this section reviews the development of detection and classification algorithms according to lung lesion types based on
CT and X-ray, respectively.
Fig. 1 shows the statistical data of relevant literatures published in the past 10 years. The total number of literatures in
this area has increased in the last decade, and the proportion of methods based on deep learning is rapidly growing
yearly. Many studies on nodules have been performed (more than 50%), whereas few studies on other diseases have
been conducted. The number of studies on nodules has also increased in recent years, whereas the number of studies on
pneumonia and TB has slightly fluctuated. However, research on pneumonia has rapidly developed since the beginning
of 2020. This development is related to the spread of COVID-19.
In addition, the commonly used experimental performance evaluation index and their meaning or calculation are listed
below.
• True positive (TP) is the number of positive samples classified as positive by the model.
• False positive (FP) is the number of negative samples classified as positive by the model.

In the three subsections, the development of detection and classification algorithms based on CT and X-ray is discussed
(Table 1). Some representative studies on COVID-19 (until the first week of May 2020) are summarized.
2.1

Pulmonary Nodules

Tumor is a pathological description, whereas nodule is a radiological description. These terms are two different
interpretations of the same phenomenon; malignant tumors are called cancer [26]. During diagnosis, the major features
often used are lobules and glitches, density, bronchogram signs, vacuole signs, and cavities [26]. The images are easily
labeled because of the clear and smooth contour of lung tumors and nodules. Thus, the complexity for training the
model is low.
The number of papers on nodules in the last decade is shown in Fig. 1. In general, traditional machine and deep learning
methods are widely used in studying nodules. Studies on traditional machine learning methods have started early and
have gained remarkable achievements. However, the usage of deep learning has soared since 2015, and the number of
studies by using deep learning has grown rapidly.
2.1.1

Traditional Machine Learning on CT

In early 2010, traditional machine learning methods were used to classify and detect lesions. Lee et al. [59] compared
three methods, namely, decision tree, support vector machine (SVM), and random forest model, for lung nodule
classification. The random forest model has the best accuracy (96.09%), followed by decision tree (94.85%) and SVM
(92.44%). Sivakumar and Chandrasekar [96] tested the effect of three different kernels of SVM on the accuracy of
pulmonary nodule detection.

2.1.2

Primary Neural Networks on CT

Since 2014, deep learning has been introduced into CAD [56, 91]. Kuruvilla and Gunavathi [56] used a back propagation
neural network to classify lung cancer, which has achieved an accuracy of 93.3% and a specificity of 100%. No FP
detection is important as it indicates no misdiagnosed patient. Rahul et al. [77] integrated three parallel basic
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) by using the radiomics method and then connected them to a pretrained VGG
model for nodule classification.
2.1.3

Improvements of Basic Neural Networks on CT

CNN has shown good performance in image segmentation, classification, and object detection [74], but its accuracy is
not always satisfactory. Accuracy may be improved by increasing the number of columns [91], increasing the depth
[87], and introducing scale and sequence information [10].
Multi-column Models Shen et al. [91] used a multiscale convolutional neural network (MCNN) for lung nodule
classification. In their model, three columns are utilized to extract the feature of nodules in different scales. During
their experiment, the MCNN has shown robustness against noisy inputs. Jiang et al. [48] proposed a four-channel CNN
to detect a lung nodule.
Deep CNN-based Models Early deep CNNs still contain fewer layers than those in present deep CNNs. Li et al.
[60] have introduced a seven-layer deep CNN in lung nodule classification tasks. Golan et al. [32] used a 12-layer
deep CNN network to detect lung nodules. Liu et al. [66] compared seven present deep networks, namely, LeNet
[58], AlexNet [53], VGG-16 [94], ResNet18, ResNet20, ResNet50, and ResNet101 [37], for lung nodule classification.
These methods have achieved an accuracy of over 93%, but ResNet101 with the largest depth has yielded the highest
accuracy of 96.59%.
Scale and Sequence Aware Models Considering that organs and bones can be location references for a target area,
researchers introduced the multiscale information [104, 52] into lesion detection and classification. Kopelowitz and
Engelhard [52] proposed a 3D Mask R-CNN (regions with CNN features) for the detection and segmentation of lung
nodules. Apart from multiscale information, sequence information exists in serial images in a CT scan. Abbas [8]
used a recurrent neural network to classify lung nodules. Gao et al. [31] utilized a distanced long–short-term memory
(LSTM) network for CT sequence features to detect lung cancer.
A 3D CNN is an ideal network designed for learning a sequence feature. Moreover, the structure can be extended by
increasing the depth and columns. Dou et al. [27] introduced multilevel contextual 3D CNNs (Fig. 2) for FP reduction
in pulmonary nodule detectionfor false positive reduction in pulmonary nodule detection, and reached a sensitivity
of 92.2% at 8 FPs/scan. For the first time, Liao et al. [64] proposed a volumetric one-stage end-to-end CNN for 3D
nodule detection, which is based on an improved a 3D CNN, and introduced the Noisy-OR into neural networks to solve
multiple instance learning tasks in CAD. Mishra et al. [70] merged the method of introducing sequence information
and increasing the depth of a learning model by using a deep 3D CNN to detect lung cancer.
2.1.4

Traditional Machine Learning on X-ray

Among various methods of detecting suspected lung cancer areas, X-ray has been used for a long time [102, 85, 108].
However, X-ray is usually utilized for the prior detection of nodules because of its low detection accuracy and lack of
contextual information. Traditional machine learning methods in the field of lung nodules in X-ray images were seldom
applied in 2010. Hardie et al. [36] used a Fisher linear discriminant to identify lung nodules in chest X-ray images.
Sheng et al. [22] developed an SVM-based CAD scheme for nodules in X-ray images.
2.1.5

Deep Learning on X-ray

In 2010, several researchers proposed different methods for segmenting the lung area and reducing the influence of ribs
[33, 62, 30, 61]. Yu et al. [30] compared the performance of the CNN classifier between raw X-ray and segmented lung
area images and showed a great improvement in accuracy.
Researchers have started to explore new theories and structures [63, 69, 19] to improve the accuracy of lung nodule
diagnosis on X-ray images. Li et al. [63] used a multiresolution CNN to detect X-ray lung nodules. Mendoza et al.
5

A PREPRINT - JANUARY 1, 2021

Figure 2: Overview of Multi-level Contextual 3-D CNN by Dou, et al. [27]

[69] utilized a deep CNN for lung nodule detection and classification. Input X-ray images are first processed using a
sliding band detector to find candidate locations. After the candidates outside the lungs are excluded, the probability
that a suspicious area is a nodule is estimated using the CNN. Capizzi et al. [19] introduced bioinspired reinforcement
learning to probabilistic neural networks to detect lung nodules on a radiology key dataset [3].
2.1.6

Research Analysis

In comparison with deep learning methods, traditional machine learning performs well in ideal scenes, such as low
density, low noise, and medium-sized nodules, but it has poor tolerance to noise and unsatisfactory performance in
detection tasks. When deep learning methods are used, multi-column models have a good performance because the scale
of nodules varies remarkably. For the indistinct features, such as blurred borders and some small nodules, especially
early nodules, deepening a model can allow the extraction of more detailed features to improve accuracy. For CT
images, introducing a time series model can improve the accuracy of classification and detection by extracting the
sequence in the formation of CT images. A 3D CNN and its related methods inherit the advantages of CNNs and can be
used to easily extract the characteristics of images and the algorithms introduced by serial information. By contrast,
research on X-ray images ocused on traditional machine learning instead of deep learning before 2017 [50, 86] because
of the lack of sequence and 3D scale information. According to recent research [63, 69, 62, 30, 61], new methods, such
as the segmentation of the lungs and the elimination of the influence of ribs, can improve the performance of deep
learning algorithms on X-ray nodule detection and classification.
2.2

Pneumonia

Pneumonia is usually diagnosed on the basis of the features of lung consolidation, blurry density-enhancing shadows at
the edges, blurry lung texture weight gain, uneven patchy shadows, and central lobules [26]. The CAD of pneumonia is
still waiting to be developed because the imaging characteristics of pneumonia are indistinct and difficult to annotate.
Researchers proposed the detection algorithms of pneumonia with a good performance based on X-ray images.
In Fig. 1, the number of papers was low before 2018, but it increased after 2019. It has surpassed the number of studies
on nodules in 2020. More approaches regarding pneumonia related to COVID-19 will be proposed in the future.

Non-COVID-19 Pneumonia

Before the COVID-19 outbreak, various approaches were proposed in classification and detection tasks based on the
radiology feature of pneumonia. Similar to lung nodules, pneumonia is classified and detected using a basic CNN and
its improvements. This section introduces the methods of basic CNNs and their improvements.
Basic CNN Basic CNN stands for a CNN that contains simple elements and few layers instead of hundreds of layers
like DensNet-121. Two studies utilizing basic CNNs are presented as examples. Okeke et al. [98] used a seven-layer
CNN to classify pneumonia. Sharma et al. [89] also proposed a seven-layer CNN to extract features, classify pneumonia,
and achieve an accuracy of 90.68%.
Improvements on Basic CNN Deepening the network is the most widely used method to improve the basic CNN.
Pranav et al. [81] designed a 121-layer CNN named CheXNet for pneumonia detection and testing. The result is marked
using a heat map, and the area with a color close to red indicates a high possibility of pneumonia. Zech et al. [111]
tested the performance of ResNet-50 [37] and DenseNet-121 [41] by comparing the performance of training and testing.
They concluded that cross-sectional training is an important method to improve the robustness of the model.
In addition to deepening the model, other methods are used to improve a basic CNN. Gu et al. [35] designed a deep
CNN by using AlexNet as a backbone to classify pneumonia on X-ray images. In this model, pretrained AlexNet is
utilized on the nonmedical dataset ImageNet for initializing and retraining images after the lungs are segmented by
using fully convolutional networks. Gu et al. [35] showed that the segmentation of images and the introduction of
features can improve the performance of the model. Islam et al. [45] applied a compressed sensing (CS)-based CNN for
pneumonia detection by using X-ray (Table 2). The CS subchannel is used to help detect the region of interest. Jaiswal
et al. [47] masked a region-based CNN with ResNet50 and ResNet101 [37] for pneumonia classification and detection.
2.2.2

COVID-19

By the end of 2019, a new kind of coronavirus pneumonia named COVID-19 emerged. Since then, it has spread across
the world. A large number of patients and radiographs have been obtained within a short period and increased the
burden on doctors. According to the analysis in Wuhan [40], 98% of the infected patients have bilateral lung opacities
and lobular subsegmental areas of consolidation in their chest CT images. Furthermore, ground glass opacities and
consolidation are observed [24]. Sometimes, rounded morphology and peripheral lung distribution are widely found in
the CT scans of the infected patients. [67].
CT Based Methods Research on COVID-19 in China has focused on CT images, and further studies have explored
algorithms to classify typical pneumonia and COVID-19. Xu et al. [18] used two 3D CNNs for the classification
and detection of COVID-19 on a dataset with 618 CT samples. Song et al. [97] proposed a method named the
DeepPneumonia framework, which is constructed on the pretrained ResNet-50 [37], and a feature pyramid network
is added. The DeepPneumonia framework is trained and validated on a dataset with 1,990 CT images. Gozes et al.
[34] proposed a system receiving chest CT images and annotations of objects with COVID-19 features. As the core
of the system, robust 2D and 3D deep learning models are trained and tested on 157 patients from China and the US.
The system has reached an AUC of 0.996 on the test set. Zheng et al. [114] developed a deep learning network named
DeCovNet for COVID-19 classification. It is constructed on a pretrained 2D U-Net and has an AUC of 0.959.
Despite classification, the detection of COVID-19 is an important direction for some researchers. Zhao et al. [113]
proposed a transfer learning method by using DenseNet [41]. Their model is pretrained on the NIH ChestX-ray14
7

A PREPRINT - JANUARY 1, 2021

dataset and fine tuned on their newly established dataset, namely, COVID-CT, reaching a precision of 97.0%. Hu
et al. [38] tried a weakly supervised deep learning method on CT scans after lung segmentation for the detection of
COVID-19 and community-acquired pneumonia infection; they achieved an accuracy of 98.2%. Chen et al. [21] used a
U-Net++ model on 46,906 images for COVID-19 detection and obtained the highest accuracy of 98.85%.
X-ray Based Methods With the worldwide outbreak of COVID-19, studies on X-ray images have been conducted.
Apostolopoulos et al. [13] transferred some existing object classification models into the COVID-19 classification area.
They compared five currently existing models, namely, VGG19 [94], MobileNet v2 [84], Inception [101], Xception
[23], and Inception ResNet v2 [100]. VGG19 outperforms the other models and has an accuracy of 98.75% in the
two-class classification scheme and 93.48% in the three-class classification scheme. Kumar et al. [55] used ResNet-152
to extract features with seven traditional machine learning classifiers, including logistic regression, nearest neighbors,
decision tree, random forest, AdaBoost classifier, naive Bayes, and XGBoost classifier. This model has an accuracy of
97.7% on the XGBost classifier. Farooq et al. [28] developed COVID–ResNet, a deep learning framework that aims to
classify COVID-19. This framework is highly sensitive to normal (96.58%) and COVID-19 (100%) classes.
2.2.3

Research Analysis

X-ray images are widely used in the classification and detection of pneumonia because of processing speed and
insufficient medical resources and CT datasets of pneumonia. However, CT images have the advantages of accuracy,
resolution, and scale information. With the COVID-19 outbreak, considerable CT scans of pneumonia have been
obtained, resulting in the increased usage of CT images in research.
In the summary of the COVID-19 studies, some of the proposed methods are used, and they have a good performance.
On the basis of the radiological features of COVID-19, some other researchers have put forward new models to solve the
problems existing in the diagnosis, such as the misclassification in mild cases and being confused with non-COVID-19
pneumonia.

2.3.1

Lung Tuberculosis and Other Lung Diseases
Lung Tuberculosis

Pulmonary TB is generally diagnosed by analyzing X-ray image characteristics that often reveal the features of cloudlike shadows, lung lobe or lung shadows on one side, nodular or spherical shadows, and hollow images. CT images
are generally used to help identify TB [26]. Detecting pulmonary TB is difficult because its distribution is irregular,
resulting in different characteristics that are easily confused with noise.
The number of studies on TB in the last decade is shown in Fig. 1. In general, research on lung TB imaging has attracted
less attention than that on lung nodules. With the development of CAD, the number of studies on TB has increased
since 2017.
Traditional Machine Learning Methods of Tuberculosis At the beginning of the second decade in the 21st century,
traditional machine learning methods are utilized in the classification tasks of lung TB. Rui et al. [90] introduced a
hybrid knowledge-based Bayesian approach to classify TB in X-ray images. For the same purpose, Tan et al. [103]
utilized a decision tree on the self-built dataset provided by SATA CommHealth Singapore and obtained 94.9% accuracy.
Deep Learning Methods of Tuberculosis In the field of TB, CNN is still widely used in detection and classification
tasks. In the Image CLEF 2017 competition [44], Sun et al. [99] used the ResNet-50 [37] and the LSTM Network to
classify the type of TB on CT images. Their model has ranked first among all classification models in the competition.
HWang et al. [42] developed a deep learning-based automatic detection (DLAD) algorithm on 54,221 normal and 6,768
TB X-ray images [46]. The core of the DLAD algorithm is a 27-layer CNN trained using a semisupervised localization
approach, and it has an AUC of 0.988 on an internal test.
Many researchers choose a pretrained model in their architecture. For example, Liu et al. [65] utilized TX-CNN
constructed using AlexNet and GoogLeNet [101] to detect TB. Nguyen et al. [71] detected TB on a dataset by using
several pretrained models, such as Resnet-50 [37], VGG-16 [94], and Inception V2 [43], and obtained an AUC of about
0.9. Lakhani et al. [57] evaluated AlexNet and GoogLeNet by classifying TB and achieved a comprehensive AUC of
0.99.

Other Lung Diseases

Except for TB, lesion detection and classification technologies are usually utilized on other diseases, such as pulmonary
edema, atelec tasis, and pneumoconiosis. These diseases, like pneumonia and TB, have disadvantages in CAD, such
as shortage in data and implicit features. Furthermore, the disadvantages especially the lack of datasets lead to the
insufficiency of these studies in these fields.
In addition to TB, other diseases, such as pulmonary edema, atelectasis, and pneumoconiosis, are examined with
lesion detection and classification technologies. These diseases, similar to pneumonia and TB, have CAD-related
disadvantages, such as shortage in data and implicit features. Furthermore, such disadvantages, especially the lack of
datasets, lead to the insufficiency of these studies in these fields.
Traditional machine and deep learning methods have been successfully used to detect and classify lung lesions. Atul et
al. [54] utilized SVM to detect pulmonary edema and achieved an accuracy of 97.62%. Eiichiro et al. [73] introduced a
three-stage artificial neural network to classify pneumoconiosis and obtained an AUC of about 0.89. Jens et al. [75]
applied a weakly supervised traditional machine learning method called multiple instance learning to predict scan- and
region-level emphysema.
2.3.3

Research Analysis

Similar to lung nodules and pneumonia, TB and other lung diseases are classified and detected using CNN-based
models [42, 65, 57, 71, 99]. They are also explored with traditional machine learning methods [54, 73, 75], but lung
nodules and pneumonia have been rarely investigated using such methods. Therefore, the detection and classification of
these lesions need further development.

Datasets

Dataset construction is an important step of medical image processing based on deep learning. Most lung nodules and
early COVID-19 datasets are composed of CT images. Various datasets of lung diseases, such as pneumonia (including
COVID-19), TB, and nodules, are composed of X-ray images. This section introduces the public datasets obtained
using radiological methods and separately highlights COVID-19 datasets.
Table 3 lists 26 public datasets of common pulmonary diseases, including nodules, pneumonia, TB, and other diseases.
The two basic sources of public datasets are those established by organizations and those released by competition
datasets. Some images come from different datasets (Fig. 3), and the colored areas indicate the lesion locations.
3.1

CT Datasets

CT datasets are mainly about nodules [76, 9, 14, 88, 29, 79, 78, 95, 49]. The Italian organization Fondazione IRCCS
Istituto Nazionale Tumori di Milano has published a pulmonary nodule dataset named MILD [76]. In 2012, 490,320
lung CT images were included in this dataset, and the lung conditions of 4,099 participants were traced in 5 years. The
LUNA16 Dataset [88] is a competition dataset that contains 888 lung CT samples from patients with nodules, which are
selected from the larger LIDC–IDRI dataset [15] (Fig. 3 first row). Deleting images with a nodule diameter of less than
3 mm or a slice thickness of more than 3 mm in LIDC–IDRI is suitable for nodule detection. In the LUNA16 dataset,
the position of nodules is annotated with squares. The LCTSC Dataset [79] is a competition dataset that includes 9,569
images of 60 samples from patients with tumor; it is used in lung tumor segmentation competition.

X-ray Datasets

X-ray datasets cover most of the common pulmonary diseases, such as pneumonia [51, 107, 17], TB [46, 17], and
tumors [93, 107, 17]. The Montgomery County X-ray Set [46] is a small-scale dataset of TB with only 138 images
and usually combined with the Shenzhen Hospital X-Ray Set [46] for research. In the Kaggle RSNA competition, the
organizers released a dataset of 5,863 pneumonia images extracted from the NIH ChestX-ray14, named Chest X-ray
Images (Pneumonia) [51] (Fig. 3 second row). The National Institutes of Health (NIH) ChestX-ray14 Dataset [107]
contains 112,120 images of 14 different types of lesions. The PADCHEST_SJ Dataset [17] is a large-scale X-ray
dataset with 160,000 pictures from 67,000 samples that contain 19 different lesions, including pneumonia (Fig. 3 third
row), TB, lung tumors, and pulmonary edema.

Figure 3: Images in some datasets (first row, LUNA16 [106]; second row, ChestX-ray [4]; third row, PADCHEST_SJ
[5]; and last row, DeepLesion [72])
3.3

General Datasets

Except the specific datasets of CT or X-ray, the general datasets contain many types of images and organs, such as
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) images. For example, DeepLesion [110]
11

A PREPRINT - JANUARY 1, 2021

is a generic dataset with 32,120 images of many organs, including the lungs, liver, bone, and kidneys, and most of them
are annotated by radiologists (Fig. 3 last row). In the DeepLesion dataset, many different annotation tools, such as
RECIST diameters, line, ellipse, arrow, and text, are used. LIDC–IDRI [15] is a lung cancer dataset published by the
National Cancer Institute (NCI) and composed of 243,958 CT and 929 X-ray images from 1,010 patients, and these
images are point annotated by radiologists. Apart from datasets, a large cancer database named The Cancer Imaging
Archive [20] was built by the NCI in 2010. Images from different sources (such as CT, X-ray, MRI, and PET) and
different body parts (such as the brain, lung, and abdomen) are uploaded in this database. Currently, 114 datasets are
available in the database, which is updated continuously.
3.4

COVID-19 Datasets

Since the COVID-19 outbreak, its public datasets have been constructed swiftly and have facilitated studies on this field.
In the COVID-CT-Dataset [113], images from studies published between January 19 and March 25 were summarized,
and 275 COVID-19 CT images were acquired. The SIRM COVID-19 Database [7], which was built by the Italian
organization Societ‘a Italiana di Radiologia Medica e Interventistica, contains 71 cases, including CT and X-ray
images, and it is still being updated. The 2019nCoVR dataset, which was published by the China National Center for
Bioinformation and National Genomics Data Center [112], is the largest COVID-19 dataset that comprises CT images
from 4,154 patients in China.
3.5

Self-Built Datasets

Public datasets still have difficulty in meeting the personalized needs of all researchers. Therefore, another main source
of dataset is self-building. For example, Hwang et al. [42] used a TB X-ray dataset, which contains more than 60,000
images obtained from SNUH as a training dataset. Liu et al. [65] used 4,701 TB X-ray images from their Peruvian
partners.
At the start of the COVID-19 epidemic in 2020, its public datasets were insufficient. Most studies on the classification
and detection of COVID-19 images have been organized via self-built datasets. For example, Chen et al. [21] collected
CT scans from 51 patients with COVID-19 and 55 control patients from the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University as
a retrospective set. They also collected CT scans from 27 patients as a perspective set. Zheng et al. [114] collected
630 CT scans from 540 patients in Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and
Technology, and Huazhong University of Science and Technology ethics committee.

Challenges and Improvements

In our opinion, challenges come from data sources and algorithms.
4.1

Challenges of Datasets

Current data sources have three main challenges. First, datasets are not evenly distributed. The datasets of some
diseases, such as lung nodules, are abundant, whereas the datasets of other diseases are few. The number of public
datasets between CT and X-ray images is different in some diseases, such as pneumonia. Second, different datasets are
constructed through various institutions, leading to different annotations between datasets or even in the same dataset
(Fig. 4).

Figure 4: Some different annotations in datasets. From left to right: An annotated image in DeepLesion; an annotated
image in LUNA16; another annotated image in DeepLesion.
12

A PREPRINT - JANUARY 1, 2021

Third, the quality of the images varies considerably. For example, some images have problems, such as incompleteness,
blur, deviation, and occlusion by zippers, buttons, and pacemakers (Fig. 5). Different kinds of lesions may occur at the
same region in one image. Moreover, the features of mild pneumonia images are not evident, often leading to missed
annotations and detection.

Figure 5: X-ray images with occlusion and vague problems (from PADCHEST_SJ)
Despite these challenges, as a newly exposed region, COVID-19 studies are especially hindered by the following
drawbacks in datasets. The shortage of COVID-19 datasets restricts the usage of deep learning methods.
4.2

Challenges of Technologies

Algorithms pose four main challenges. First, considering the current problems that exist in datasets, preprocessing needs
to be improved. Second, the low robustness of models in complex scenes restricts their transfer ability. Some approaches
can improve the robustness of the models, but satisfying the application is difficult [111, 91]. This problem should be
considered in designing algorithms in the future. Third, deep learning models are too heavy to maintain a real-time
performance. As a result, a lightweight architecture should be used in real-time tasks. Lastly, data annotation becomes a
serious problem for supervised learning because thousands of images are needed to train a model [42, 65, 59, 111, 21].
Thus, the usage of weakly supervised, semisupervised, or even unsupervised models [107, 42, 75] can reduce the burden
on data annotation and will become an important aspect of research in the future. This idea is effective for specifically
handling the shortage of datasets related to COVID-19.

Conclusion

This article presented an overview of studies on pulmonary lesion detection and classification via CT and X-ray images.
It also summarized some studies on pulmonary CAD in last decade, and:
• Overall, studies on detection and classification mainly focus on nodules. However, since the outbreak of
COVID-19, research on pneumonia has also temporarily attracted attention.
• Deep learning approaches probably overtake the place of traditional machine learning methods, especially
after the problem of interpretation ability has been solved.
• In the last three months, studies on COVID-19 have increased consistently. Hence, further surveys on
COVID-19 studies should be proposed.
And this review introduced 26 public datasets, including organization and competition datasets, which could be divided
into CT, X-ray, and general datasets. COVID-19 and self-made datasets were also introduced individually. This review
generalized the challenges encountered in current datasets and technologies, and we presented our suggestions.
