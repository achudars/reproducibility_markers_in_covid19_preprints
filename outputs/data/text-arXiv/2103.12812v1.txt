The Current Chinese Global Supply Chain Monopoly and the Covid-19 Pandemic

Abstract
Because of the ongoing Covid-19 crisis, supply chain management performance seems to be struggling. The
purpose of this paper is to examine a variety of critical factors related to the application of contingency theory to
determine its feasibility in preventing future supply chain bottlenecks. The study reviewed current online news
reports, previous research on contingency theory, as well as strategic and structural contingency theories. This
paper also systematically reviewed several global supply chain management and strategic decision-making studies
in an effort to promote a new strategy. The findings indicated that the need for mass production of products within
the United States, as well as within trading partners, is necessary to prevent additional Covid-19 related supply
chain gaps. The paper noted that in many instances, the United States has become dependent on foreign products,
where the prevention of future supply chain gaps requires the United States restore its manufacturing prowess.

GSCM’s ability to deliver products over 30 days

Introduction
The purpose of this paper is to provide an
accurate assessment of the current state of global

pandemic. At issue is whether supply chain management
organizations within the United States are dependent
upon Chinese made products, whether the United States
-based supply chain management organizations need to
implement additional strategies to prevent future supply
chain shortages, and whether the United States should
increase production internally to avoid future supply
chain shortages. This essay develops the notion that

from supply chain management systems. Juan and Lin
focused on the effect of Covid-19 regarding United
States trade policy and the disease’s impact on the
global supply chain management system [1]. The
authors identified that some supply chain organizations
would recover faster than others using the supply chain
resilience hypothesis [2]. It is probably still too early to
understand the long-term impact the past events will
have on GSCM. Before the current viral pandemic, the
majority of GSCM was monopolized by the Chinese
manufacturing industry. This was prevalent given the
shortage of medical masks, hand sanitizer, and the
ability to obtain ventilator systems to support the
continued increase of individuals falling ill due to the
virus. This paper will discuss the ongoing situation with
GSCM and provide a suggested method to deter such
incidents from happening in the future. Scholarly
research will be utilized to support arguments being
made to discontinue dependence upon foreign entities
that produce products for American citizens.

Syndrome (“SARS”), which took place during 2002 and
2003, the effects on the market were so minuscule that
no one recognized any impact at all [4]. At that time,
China only controlled just over four percent of the
world’s gross domestic product (“GDP”) [5]. Today they
control over 16 percent of the world’s GDP. When China
quarantined more than half of its population, this caused
all manufacturing of products to come to a complete halt
and disrupted the GSCM in a manner not seen since the
first world war [6]. People wanted more cost-effective
means of obtaining products, and manufacturing within
countries such as the United States and Europe was not
beneficial due to higher costs, thus resorting to these
countries to rely on China for decades. Businesses want
to make products more cost-effective manner to
increase sales and profits. Ironically, America and
Europe are now manufacturing products within their

Goldsby et al. showed that organizations in the

supply chain industry do not keep current with planning
and operational processes, tending to take action only
when a social, political, economic, or environmental
crisis arises [16]. The results from Flynn et al. seemed
to be related to contingency theory, taking into account
population growth and immigration [17]. Global supply
chain organizations are faced with a dilemma. Every
country has its own unique culture, where even in the
United States, different regions of the nation demand
different kinds of goods and services. The question is,
how can TRA fit into the contingency theory when
culture may affect the variables necessary to identify
behavior.
The theory of planned behavior (“TPB”) is
another methodology that can be utilized to measure
behavior. Unlike TRA,

which is used to identify

behavioral intent, TPB is employed to prevent a specific
action [18]. It seems that a model that blends TRA and
TPB with contingency theory warrants an investigation.
Mandal observed that behavior as an inherent risk
associated with supply chain management encouraged
organizations to exercise flexibility, thereby ensuring risk
management practices are affirmed [19]. However, with
cultural differences in a global market, risk management

conflict both inside and outside during the stock market
crash of 1929 and the Enron scandal in 2001 [25]. The
morale of Maurer’s research is that with great power
comes great responsibility [26]. In a global market,
supply chain management, organizational failures can
affect other organizations, that trickle eventually down
to the consumer. Politics can play a crucial role in not
only ensuring consumers are protected, but could also
force organizations to close their doors [27]. For
example, when Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and other
New York state and city politicians forced Amazon to
rethink its strategic move into New York City, the
company relocated to another state [28].

how the Covid-19 pandemic is affecting the global
economic framework. Manufacturing creates jobs that
generate profits and tax revenues and fuels the
economy. A centralized production model or node has
the potential to create a single point of failure, which
can hinder economic development [49]. A quick review
of China’s role is in order to develop a better
understanding. Previous scholars predicted that China
would become a manufacturing behemoth, impacting
the world in good times and bad. Kremer’s O-Ring

production increases in shale and fracking could open
new markets and create clean energy products that
could sustain the American way of life seemingly
forever, while also providing fossil-fuel energy to other
countries. Critics could argue that fracking hurts the

on other nations to offer America goods, the absence of
fracking harms the climate even more due to unfriendly
