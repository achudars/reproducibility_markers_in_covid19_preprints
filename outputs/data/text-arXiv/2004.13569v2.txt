Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic led to the adoption of severe measures to counteract the spread of the infection. Social distancing and lockdown measures
modified people’s habits, while the Internet gained a major role in supporting
remote working, e-teaching, online collaboration, gaming, video streaming,
etc. All these sudden changes put unprecedented stress on the network.
In this paper, we analyze the impact of the lockdown enforcement on the
Politecnico di Torino campus network. Right after the school shutdown on
the 25th of February, PoliTO deployed its own in-house solution for virtual
teaching. Ever since, the university provides about 600 virtual classes daily,
serving more than 16 000 students per day. Here, we report a picture of how
the pandemic changed PoliTO’s network traffic. We first focus on the usage
of remote working and collaboration platforms. Given the peculiarity of
PoliTO online teaching solution that is hosted in-house, we drill down on the
traffic, characterizing both the audience and the network footprint. Overall,
we present a snapshot of the abrupt changes seen on campus traffic due to
COVID-19, and testify how the Internet has proved robust to successfully
cope with challenges while maintaining the university operations.

The countries most affected by the virus spreading are facing an unprecedented health crisis, whose effects will impact their economic and social structures for a long time. The urge to respect social distancing and lockdown
measures adopted to limit the spreading of the infection led to a shift in the
fruition and supply of a wide number of services. Some examples include the
increased usage of home delivery services, the shift to online lessons and the
adoption of remote working solutions.
Italy has been among the first countries hit by COVID-19. The first case
was identified in the north of Italy on February 21st , and on the same date,
the Government issued the fist law decree to impose quarantine in small
selected towns. On February 25th , the Government extended the restrictions
to impose remote working for all public offices, shutting down schools, and
classes at Universities. Restrictions applied to the largest four regions in
the north of Italy. On March 1st , these restrictions were extended to the
whole Italy, with further lockdown actions entering in place on March 4th
and 8th . On March 11th , the “#IoRestoACasa” Prime Ministerial Decree
imposed a total lockdown to the whole Italy. Since then, and still at the
time of writing, people are allowed to exit from home only for specific and
urgent needs. Common retail businesses, catering and restaurant services
are suspended. Gatherings in public places are prohibited. All activities not
deemed essential for the Italian production chain are closed. Italy entered
the most restrictive lockdown in its history.

Figure 1 clearly depicts the impact of these measures.1 It shows the variation of the mobility patterns in Italy since the begin of the emergency and
the impact of the restrictions and total lockdown. The vertical bars highlight the relevant events listed above. The leftmost violet bar identifies the
date of the first COVID-19 case in Italy. The central brown bar identifies the
school shutdown. The rightmost bar marks the date of the “#IoRestoACasa”
decree. The decrease in mobility is drastic after each of those events.
Restrictions limited people’s mobility while remote working, e-learning,
online collaboration platforms started to grow along with online leisure solutions, like gaming and video streaming. These new habits highlighted the
fundamental role of the Internet. Correspondingly, Internet traffic volume
has grown by about 40%, sometimes with a decrease in the download performance, questioning the resiliency of the Internet itself [1, 2].
In this paper, we analyze the changes in the traffic patterns that are
visible from our university campus, the Politecnico di Torino (PoliTO for
short) in Italy. We look at the campus traffic, focusing on collaboration
and remote working platforms usage, remote teaching adoption, and look for
changes in unsolicited/malicious traffic. PoliTO opted to implement an inhouse e-learning solution based on the BigBlueButton framework to support
all the classes of the second semester, which were scheduled to start on March
2nd .2 The platform has been designed, installed, and tested during the first
week of March, going live for the starting of the online semester one week
later. Here we leverage this unique point of view to observe changes in
the campus traffic and services during such a singular event. Moreover, we
dig into details on how students access online classes and teaching material.
Since students enjoy classes from their homes at different places, connected
by different network operators, we check whether and how these factors affect
the performance of the online teaching systems.
Overall, we highlight a 10 times decrease in incoming traffic during the
lockdown. Outgoing traffic grows instead of 2.5 times, driven by more than
600 daily online classes, with around 16 000 students per day that follow
classes. Online collaboration exploded, with faculty and staff members exchanging more than 17 000 chat messages and participating to more than
1 000 calls per day. We observe a surge in remote learning and working also

during the weekends. Considering Internet connectivity, we notice no major problems, with only a few cases of poor performance, possibly related to
people connected via 3G/4G operators.
In a nutshell, we believe this paper testifies how the Internet proved able
to cope with the sudden need for connectivity. We attest how remote working,
e-learning and online collaboration platforms are a viable solution to cope
with the social distancing policies during COVID-19 pandemic. While we
all hope the latter will soon be relieved, we believe the experience of online
collaboration will continue also after the COVID-19 disappears.
The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the datasets and
methodology; Section 3 reports a drill-down on the aggregate campus traffic patterns and online collaboration solutions; Section 4 focuses on online
classes; Section 5 details network performance metrics, breaking down by
operator and region; Section 6 looks into possible changes in unsolicited and
malicious traffic, such as portscans and spam emails; Section 7 summarizes
related work; finally Section 8 concludes the paper.
2. Datasets and methodology
PoliTO is a medium-sized university that offers bachelor, master and
graduate-level courses in the engineering and architecture fields only. It is
among the top Universities in Italy. PoliTO has about 35 000 students, of
which 30% come from the Piedmont region where Torino is, 55% from other
Italian regions, and 15% from the rest of the world. PoliTO employs about
2 000 faculty and researchers, and around 1 000 administrative staff members.3 PoliTO main campus network hosts all its IT services, and offers both
Ethernet and WiFi connectivity to departments, offices, classrooms, student
rooms, and laboratories. Two 10 Gbit/s access links connect the campus LAN
to the Internet, through the GARR (Gruppo per l’Armonizzazione delle Reti
della Ricerca) network, which provides Internet access to all Italian universities.
In the following, we describe the data sources we use to gauge the changes
in the traffic and services hosted at the campus network. If not explicitly
said, the data cover the period from Saturday, February 1st to Sunday, April
5th 2020.

2.1. Passive traces
We leverage statistics collected by edge routers to observe and compare
the load on different Italian University networks. This data is stored by
GARR in a central database publicly accessible.4 The repository stores the
time series of the traffic volume on each edge link of the GARR network, with
a granularity of five minutes. In our analysis, we consider PoliTO campus
and compare it with two other large Italian universities for reference, namely
Politecnico di Milano (the biggest technical university in Italy) and Universit
di Torino.5
While GARR offers only high-level aggregated data, here we also leverage on fine-grained measurements exposed by the monitoring infrastructure
deployed in the Campus network. Such infrastructure is based on Tstat [3],
a passive sniffer that analyzes the traffic entering and leaving the Campus.
It computes flow-level logs similar to NetFlow, exposing information about
TCP and UDP flows observed in the network. Beside classical flow-level
fields, such as IP addresses and port numbers, Tstat exposes metrics such as
Round-Trip time (RTT) and packet losses. We store Tstat logs in a secured
Hadoop-based cluster. Tstat limits as much as possible any information that
can be used to identify users – e.g., client IP addresses are anonymized using
the CryptoPan algorithm [4], and no payload is stored. All data collection
is approved and supervised by the responsible University officers.
2.2. Application logs
In addition to passive measurements, we extract data about servers and
network devices offering specific services and applications that staff members may use for smart working. We focus on three classes of services: (i)
the tools to access the internal resources of the Campus while working from
home, namely Virtual Private Network (VPN) and Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) services; (ii) the Microsoft Teams collaborative platform, which
PoliTO adopted since 2019 to offer chat, file sharing, video calls and collaboration services to employees and students; (iii) email, antispam and security
services. Logs available on the management consoles offer rich information
about the usage of these services over time and let us study how the adoption
of such services varied during the epidemic.

2.3. Virtual classrooms
To face the lockdown during the COVID-19 outbreak, PoliTO opted to
set up an internally-hosted virtual classroom service for all classes. The
system is based on the BigBlueButton framework for online learning, with
customization to integrate it in the existing teaching portal. A total of 41
high-end servers running the BigBlueButton components and hosted in the
Campus data center were set up in the first week of March. All classes started
a week late. The BigBlueButton client-side application is based on HTML5.
It provides high-quality audio, video and screen sharing application using
the browsers built-in support for web real-time communication (WebRTC)
libraries. In a nutshell, once the virtual classroom has been set up, BigBlueButton servers act as WebRTC Selective Forwarding Unit (SFU) capable of
receiving multiple media streams (video, audio, screen sharing, etc.) and
deciding which of these media streams should be sent to which participants.
Video is encoded using the high-quality open-source codec VP8. PoliTO’s
setup lets the lecturer choose four video quality levels with a bitrate of 50, 100
(the default), 200, 300 kbit/s. Screen sharing may require the highest share
of bandwidth, and, if the presenters screen is updating frequently, the BigBlueButton client could transmit up to 1.0 Mbit/s. Audio is encoded using
the OPUS encoder at 40 kb/s.6 Finally, sharing slides takes little bandwidth
beyond the initial upload/download of the pdf file.
In our analyses, we collect and process the application logs of the video
servers to study the consumption and performance of virtual classrooms. We
also make use of the logs of the legacy teaching web platforms to study access
to the teaching material like lecture notes, pre-recorded classrooms, etc.
2.4. Security monitors
At last, we analyze logs from the campus border firewall that limits the access towards authorized servers while blocking possibly malicious traffic and
well-known attacks. Since we are interested in remote-working solutions, we
check the firewall for alarms related to SSH, RDP, SIP attacks. Intuitively,
we want to check if the attack patterns changed during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The firewall is configured to let three /24 subnets to be completely open
to the Internet, with no hosts connected to it. These sets of addresses act
6

https://docs.bigbluebutton.org/support/faq.html#bandwidth-requirements

6

as “darknets”, i.e., sets of IP addresses regularly advertised which do not
host any client or server. Any traffic the darknets receive is unsolicited by
definition [5]. By passively analyzing incoming packets, we observe important
security events, such as the appearance and spread of botnets, DDoS attacks
using spoofed IP address, etc. We use this information to further quantify
if there is any change in attack patterns to our campus network during the
pandemic.
3. Impact on campus traffic and remote working solutions
In this section, we analyze the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on
campus networks. We first provide quantitative figures on the overall traffic
volume changes. Then, we focus on services supporting smart working.
3.1. Aggregate traffic volume
We first focus on the volume of traffic entering and leaving three Italian
university campuses. Figure 2 shows the average hourly bitrate. For each
hour, we compute the average bitrate seen over five working days. The positive y values represent incoming traffic (traffic directed to clients and servers
hosted in the Campus LAN), while negative y values report the outgoing
traffic (traffic directed to clients and servers on the Internet). Lines mark
the volumes before and after the lockdown: the black lines depict the average
per-hour bitrate observed during the week before the lockdown (third week
of February), the red ones refer to averages calculated on the second week after the lockdown (third week of March). For comparison, the figure includes
plots for the Politecnico di Torino (PoliTO) in Figure 2a, the Politecnico
di Milano (PoliMI) in Figure 2b and the Universit di Torino (UniTO) in
Figure 2c.
Focusing on the positive y−axes, observe how the incoming traffic has
shrunk in the three cases, reflecting the lockdown effects. Since the second
week of March, most students, researchers and staff members cannot access
the campuses. The traffic after the lockdown is about one tenth of the traffic before it in both PoliTO and UniTO, with PoliMI still observing some
sizeable incoming traffic. This difference reflects the different lockdown policies imposed by each university. PoliTO and UniTO completely blocked all
teaching and research activities, while PoliMI still allows the activity of some
laboratories.

Figure 2: Traffic from three Italian Universities before and after the lockdown.

The negative y−axes report the outgoing traffic. Again, the three campuses present different behaviors: We see a major increase in outgoing traffic
from PoliTO, which is not observed in other campuses. This behavior is
justified by the online teaching platform hosted in PoliTO which causes an
increase of about 2.8 times the baseline outgoing traffic during peak time.
PoliMI and UniTO have resorted to cloud-based solutions, hence the outgoing traffic volume does not show relevant changes before and after the
lockdown.
Take away: Campus incoming traffic drastically reduced during lockdown. Outgoing traffic changed in PoliTO, where an in-house online teaching
service has been deployed. This system caused a massive inversion on traffic patterns, with significant growth in upload traffic due to online teaching
services.
3.2. Smart working adoption
We now focus on PoliTO only and drill down on the services used by the
personnel for working remotely.
In Figure 3 we show how the number of users relying on VPNs and remote
desktop (RDP) solutions have changed over time. VPNs are used to access
in-campus services and servers, while RDP allows one to remotely access
files or run applications on their office computers. Curves in Figure 3 depict
the total number of unique users accessing the services at least once in a

day.7 The effect of the lockdown started on March 11th 2020 is astonishing.
Since the lockdown started, these solutions simultaneously present a relevant
increase in usage. PoliTO offers VPN services both over IPSec and SSL.
Interestingly, SSL-based VPN usage increases significantly more than the
IPSec-based solution. This suggests that the lockdown forced non-expert
users to resort to a VPN, and they have opted for SSL-based VPN, which is
easier to configure.
Users working from home also heavily rely on RDP, with about 500 users
contacting such services at least once in a day after the lockdown. Sessions
(not reported for the sake of brevity) last several hours, suggesting that this
remote access method is mostly used for regular working sessions, and not
only to access files on computers left in offices. Notice also the growth in
the number of accesses over weekends, with more than 200 RDP accesses
per day. This suggests that people, forced at home, keep working during the
weekend, too.
3.3. Remote collaboration
We now move to remote collaboration suites. PoliTO offers all employees
and students free access to the Microsoft Teams platform for smart working.
Running on the cloud, it puts little loads on the campus network. Yet, its
7

VPN accesses are directly extracted from the VPN terminator logs. We identify RDP
connections from Tstat logs, considering TCP flows directed to port 3389 that exchanged
at least 10 MB of data. We count users by their client IP addresses, which we assume to
be unique on a daily basis.

usage provides insights on people’s habits during the lockdown.8 Figure 4
summarizes the activity of Microsoft Teams users. It shows the number of
team chat messages (i.e., chat messages to groups), private chat messages,
calls and meetings. In Teams’ jargon, both calls and meetings are online
video conferencing; calls have two participants.9
Each point in Figure 4 marks the number of people using each functionality at least once in a day. Teams was already available but only marginally
used in the campus before the lockdown, with few tens of users per day.
As for other services supporting smart working, its usage explodes during
March. Compared to smart working connectivity solutions – see Figure 3
– the growth is slightly less abrupt, showing that the people resorted first
to means to access their data and office computers, and then to online collaboration tools. People rely on Microsoft Teams as a means to exchange
direct messages – more than 700 daily users sent private chat messages over
Teams in the last week of March. In total, they exchanged more than 17 000
messages per day. Interestingly, video calls and meetings keep growing as
well, topping to 400 users per day, making more than 1 500 calls per day.
Team chat messages instead show a drop in popularity after an initial surge.
8

PoliTO staff members are not compelled to use Microsoft Teams, we, therefore, expect
other platforms to show similar significant growth.

Figure 5: Daily number of virtual classrooms and connected students (faculties and students).

Take away: The lockdown has pushed smart working to widespread adoption. Remote services access via VPN and RDP, VoIP communications and
online conferencing suddenly become regular for PoliTO users.
4. Online teaching
In this section, we study in detail the fruition and the performance of
the online teaching system deployed at PoliTO. The compelled moving of
all classes to an online solution allows us to evaluate (i) the impact of such
a scenario on the campus networks, (ii) how students accessed these new
services, and (iii) if students suffered any impairment due to limitation in
the remote connectivity.
4.1. Audience
Figure 5 provides a summary of the audience of PoliTO’s online teaching
system. Only March is shown since the university has deployed the system
from scratch to cope with the emergency.
The number of virtual classrooms (black bars) follows the pattern of the
university lecturing schedules, with around 700 virtual classrooms per day.
The drop registered on Thursday of the first week was caused by an outage.
More than 16 000 students connect to at least one virtual classroom on a
daily basis. Considering that around 35 000 students are registered at the
university, and some join a few lectures a day, a large percentage of the community engages in online teaching each day. The trend on active classrooms
11

and students is stable over time, suggesting that students and faculty found
the virtual teaching platform appropriate. This is confirmed by the feedback
students leave at the end of each class which sees more than 70% of students
giving a feedback of 4 or 5 stars (5 being the highest rating) to the technical
quality of the session.
Interestingly, 47% of classes have been followed by students outside Piedmont, where PoliTO resides. Some students have indeed returned to their
home countries or regions before the start of the second semester and could
not return to Torino because of the lockdown. Other statistics show that
most students follow classes using a Windows 10 PC (64.5%) or Mac OS X
(14.1%), and Chrome (71%), Safari (10.1%) or Firefox (9.9%) browser. Yet,
6.2% and 2.4% of students follow the class from an Android or iOS device,
respectively.
Take away: Engagement in online teaching is impressively high during the COVID-19 emergency, with a large part of the academic community
participating on a daily basis. Virtual classrooms allowed students to follow
classes, with almost 50% of them connecting from outside Piedmont.
4.2. Network workload
How much massive online teaching costs in terms of network traffic?
Clearly, the answer to this question depends on the technical parameters
of the online teaching environment. PoliTO’s infrastructure includes the deployment of teaching tools for (i) virtual classroom; (ii) on-demand video
of pre-recorded classes (stored as 720p video); (iii) other teaching material
(e.g., slides, teachers’ notes, other useful files). The virtual classroom service
allows the students to watch a live video of the lecturer, an optional whiteboard as well as the direct sharing of the lecturer’s screen. The BBB platform
uses dedicated servers and WebRTC to set up multiple RTP streams that
carry the live video and audio. On-demand video and teaching material are
instead offered by additional servers as standard HTTP downloads.
Figure 6a details the traffic volume for each service during the fourth
week of March. The figure reports the average bitrate of the traffic leaving the
Campus – i.e., from the servers to the clients, for each hour. During weekdays,
the total bitrate exceeds 1 Gbit/s, with live streaming of classes responsible
for a bit more than one third of the traffic. During the weekend, when no
lecture is scheduled, we still observe large traffic (up to 750 Mbit/s) due
to students downloading on-demand lectures and teaching material. Virtual

classroom traffic starts and ends within the schedule, while students keep
accessing on-demand classroom and material also at night.
Figure 6b shows how the accesses to teaching facilities are distributed
over the day. We take the start time of each student connection to a teaching
server and plot the number of new connections observed every five minutes.
Accesses to live classrooms (red solid line) clearly follow the schedule of the
campus lectures, which begin every 90 minutes, from 8:30 AM until 7 PM.
When lectures begin, thousands of students start a new session with the
live classrooms servers, resulting in peaks of more than 4 500 connections.
Different is the case for on-demand classrooms and teaching material (blue
and green dashed lines, respectively), whose consumption is spread over the
day. As said above, students download such material also late in the evenings,
including sizeable accesses even after midnight.

Figure 7: Characteristics of virtual classroom sessions.

We complement the above picture with Figure 7, in which we show different characteristics of the virtual classroom sessions. Using logs exported
by Tstat, we analyze the RTP streams that serve multimedia content (audio and video) to the students and report the distribution of the per-flow
average bitrate in Figure 7a, separately per audio and video.10 All classes
carry an audio track, with 40 kbit/s average bitrate – the expected VoIP
bitrate according to the BBB configuration. Considering video, we observe
that lecturers usually select the medium quality at 100 kbit/s, but we observe
a considerable amount of streams at 50 kbit/s (low quality) and 200 kbit/s
(high quality). Remind that PoliTO setup allows four quality levels, as explained in Section 2.3. In only 10% of the cases, streams reach 300 kbit/s or
higher, meaning that ultra-high quality video and screen sharing are seldom
used. In all cases, bandwidth is not a major problem for BBB, and students
need no more than 0.5-1.0 Mbit/s to enjoy a lecture.
At last, we consider session duration in Figure 7b. Half of the streams last
less than 30 minutes, but it is hard to link this short duration to abandonment
by students, as the server could reset multimedia streams for other reasons
(e.g., the lecturer temporarily mutes the microphone, or takes a break during
a class). Interestingly, we still notice two bumps at 1.5 and 3 hours, which
are the typical duration of PoliTO classes.
10

RTP streams are defined by the combination of endpoint addresses and port numbers,
plus the SSRC stream identifier. We distinguish audio and video using the RTP Payload
Type field.

14

Take away: Live classrooms put a large workload on teaching servers
with significant peaks on scheduled lecture times. Yet, bandwidth is not a
major problem. Students need less than 1 Mbit/s downstream bandwidth to
fully enjoy live lectures. Not-live teaching media are heavily consumed also
during evenings and weekends.
5. Network performance
We now evaluate network performance metrics to understand whether
people accessing teaching material experience problems to obtain the content. We first investigate the performance by breaking down data according
to the students’ Internet Service Providers (ISPs). Then, we break down
figures according to the geographical region from where students connect. In
both cases, we map their ISPs and regions using the MaxMind datasets.11
Results in this section are computed by considering the downloads of ondemand video or teaching material with TCP connections. Both contents are
provided through HTTP bulk transfers and thus constitute a valid download
performance test. To reduce noise, we consider only download of objects of
at least 10 MB.
5.1. Internet Service Providers breakdown
Figure 8a shows the distribution of the number of connections according
to the ISPs hosting the client IP addresses. As expected, the largest 4 ISPs in
Italy dominate the list, with TIM grabbing 31% of the connections, followed
by Vodafone, Fastweb and Wind Tre getting 20%-15% of the share. Some
ISPs rely on specific access technologies. For instance, EOLO, Linkem, and
Free Mobile offer Internet over 3G/4G technologies only. Would students
using them suffer eventual impairments?
For this, we check the distribution of download throughput for each ISP.
Violin plots in Figure 8b depict results. Each violin plot represents the
probability density function of the average per-flow throughput; White dots
mark the median values of distributions. We sort providers by this median.
Most flows experience average throughput higher than 5 Mb/s. For example,
the median on Fastweb customers (a provider offering mostly fiber access
solution) is as high as 10 Mbit/s. Figures for 3G/4G-only providers are,

instead, below 5 Mbit/s, thus pointing to possible client-side impairment
(e.g., congestion).
Figure 8c provides more insights. The violin plots depict the distributions
of the minimum RTT which Tstat computes by measuring the time between a
data segment and its corresponding acknowledgment. RTT is impacted (i) by
the physical distance from clients to servers, (ii) by access technology delays
and network congestion, and (iii) Internet routing. Notice how the RTT
distribution is very condensed for Fastweb (median at around 20 ms). On the
other extreme, wireless-only providers have widespread distributions, with a
median over 40 ms, and peaks above 100 ms (see Free Mobile as the clearest
example). Figure 8d extends the analysis showing a per-flow comparison
of RTT versus throughput for two providers. The low RTT for the (fiber16

most) customers on Fastweb comes together with a large throughput. The
more variable 3G/4G network on Free Mobile results in higher and more
distributed RTT and lower throughput. In extreme cases, very large RTT
values together with very low throughput are symptoms of possible network
congestion.
Take away: Despite the variability of results, the very large majority of Italian ISPs can easily meet the roughly 1 Mbit/s required to enjoy
live-streaming classes. Only a few customers, in particular those relying on
3G/4G access technologies, may suffer large delays and limited throughput
with potential to disturb the user experience.
5.2. Geographical characteristics
We repeat the performance analysis considering the geographical region
from where students connect to the online teaching system. Students in
some countries12 are reported to have problems following online lectures due
to poor Internet connectivity. Whereas we cannot measure the number of
students suffering from a total lack of connectivity, we can estimate whether
PoliTO’s students and faculty experience different performance when connecting from different regions of Italy.

Figure 9 visually reports the number of flows per Italian region. Again,
we consider only connections downloading at least 10 MB. We can see that
people have connected to the teaching system from all Italian regions. Naturally, a larger number of connections is seen for Piedmont, where PoliTO is
located – the region marked in dark-blue in northwestern Italy. Still, significant numbers of students are seen in other regions, allowing us to make fair
comparisons.

(b) Download throughput distribution
Figure 10: RTT and throughput distributions (flows larger than 10 MB) per Italian region.

Figure 10 compares performance metrics for connections coming for the
several Italian regions. We use violin plots once again, and sort regions in
the x − axes from the best to the worst median value for the metric in each
plot. Figure 10a presents the distributions of RTT. Here physical distance
is expected to play a key role. Yet, interesting patterns emerge. First, note
18

that connections from Latium (the region where Rome is located) typically
experience lower RTT than connections from Piedmont. This is an artifact
due to Internet routing: Most Internet providers peer with GARR via Internet exchanges in Rome or Milan. This aspect causes routing detours that
artificially increase RTT for all regions, but Latium and in part Lombardy.
Second, whereas southern regions are penalized by their distance to PoliTO,
much noisier RTT distributions are seen for some northern regions. Observe,
for example, that Veneto and Emilia-Romagna, two economically strong regions in northern Italian, have a large portion of connections with larger RTT
than the median connection from Sicily (an island in southern Italy). This
reflects again the different mix of access technologies and Internet routing of
ISPs.
Figure 10b depicts distribution of the average connection throughput. We
can see a large difference in throughput for the different regions. Connections
coming from the best-performing regions have median average throughput
twice as high as the regions with the lowest figures. Observe how some
regions with large median RTT, such as Sicily and Friuli-Venezia-Giulia, still
present good throughput figures. These results suggest that their large RTTs
are mostly due to physical and routing distances rather than congestion. In
some cases, large RTT variations, such as those observed for Veneto, are
coupled with low throughput figures, which result in low Internet quality for
a sizeable percentage of customers.
Take away: While some people reported limited Internet performance
due to traffic increase after COVID-19 lockdown [1, 2], our data show that
overall performance is still good to access online teaching. Physical/routing
distance has little impact in general, with Internet access technology that is
still critical for flow performance.
6. Security events and unsolicited traffic
Finally, we check events visible from PoliTO’s network security monitoring solutions. Our goal is to gauge evidence of possible changes in malicious
network activities during the lockdown.
In Figure 11 we report the variation on the number of events reported
by the university firewall per week. The first week is taken as a reference.
The three most common events are shown, namely scan/brute-force attacks
against SIP, RDP and SSH. The numbers for SIP and SSH show little variation throughout the weeks. These small variations are in line with the normal

operations of this firewall. For RDP, some significant changes appear in the
week of March 16th . Indeed, the number of RDP events reported by the
firewall has more than doubled in the first week of lockdown. Recall that
many RDP servers were enabled during that week for easing smart working.
Yet, this increase is a consequence of the deployment of the new systems and
would happen even without the lockdown. As potential attackers have found
new RDP servers online, they perform more scanning and brute-force activity
against these nodes, too. The posterior decrease in RDP events is explained
by changes in the firewall setup, performed to limit such scan activity.
A close inspection of traces of the darknet deployed at PoliTO leads to
similar remarks. Figure 12 shows the variations in the number of packets reaching the most contacted ports of the darknet. Traffic reaching the
darknet is always noisy and great variations are normally seen when new
large-scale Internet scans are performed [5]. We observe precisely this typical pattern during the weeks of lockdown as during any other period of time.
We indeed observe episodes of sudden increases for some particular ports
(e.g., port TCP/23 used by Telnet). However, there is no evident correlation
among these variations and the lockdown itself.
At last, we check the load on email servers, but we omit figures for
brevity. We observe a clear decreasing trend in SPAM emails. While the
trend seems more prominent during March, the decrease has started months

before. Again, there is no evidence that the reduction in SPAM would be a
consequence of the lockdown.
Take away: We observed little changes in unsolicited traffic, SPAM
email and other security-related events. There are no clear signals that the
most significant events are a consequence of the lockdown.
7. Related Work
The impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on the Internet ecosystem has been
immediately measured by ISPs, content providers and specialized enterprises
and published in the form of reports, news and blog posts. SimilarWeb, a
company that provides web analytics services for businesses, shows how the
habits of people shifted during the outbreak [6], with some sectors like air
travel, hotels and car rentals witnessing a large reduction of accesses while
others (e-commerce, food delivery, and social networks) increased their popularity. Microsoft reported a 755% increase in usage of its cloud services [7],
while YouTube and NetFlix reduced the streaming quality in Europe to prevent overload on the network [8]. CloudFlare and Fastly, two of the largest
Content Delivery Networks worldwide, report a 20-40% increase in daily
traffic since the lockdown in Italy [1, 2], with somehow reduced performance.
Considering ISPs, the surge of network traffic has been testified with public news and blog articles. Vodafone states that fixed broadband usage has
21

increased by more than 50% in Italy and Spain [9], with a 100% surge in
upstream traffic and 44% for downstream. Telefonica IP networks experienced a traffic increase of close to 40% while mobile voice use increased by
about 50% and 25% in the case of data [10]. Also European Internet Exchange Points measured an increase of traffic in the order of 10-40% [11, 12].
Outside Europe, Comcast, one of the largest US operators, reports a 32% increase in upstream traffic growth and an 18% increase in downstream traffic
growth [13]. In this work, we complement the above reports with additional
figures showing the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the Campus networks and e-learning facilities.
Considering research papers, specific works targeting the effects of the
COVID-19 pandemic have not yet been published. However, the role of
the Internet has already been studied for the past catastrophic events. Cho
et al. [14] study the impact of the 2011 earthquake in Japan on traffic and
routing observed by a local ISP, while Liu et al. [14] focus on inter-domain
rerouting analyzing BGP data. Zhuo et al. [15] underline the importance
of the Internet during the 2011 Egyptian Revolt, while Groshek [16] finds
statistical evidence that the Internet and mobile phones have helped to facilitate sociopolitical instability. Dainotti et al. [17] further address this aspect
by analyzing the internet outages due to censorship actions that occurred
during the Arab Spring revolts. Heidemann et al. [18] analyze network outages during the 2012 Sandy hurricane in the US. Sudden variations of Internet traffic have been observed also during massive software updates or
following the born of new services (e.g., NetFlix) or protocols (e.g., Google
QUIC) [19, 20, 21]. Finally, some works propose general techniques to study
or improve Internet traffic during disruptive events [22, 23, 24]. The events
connected with the COVID-19 pandemic have a global scale and forced an
unprecedented number of people to suddenly change their habits. As such, it
is of great interest to study the impact on the Internet, and this paper provides an in-depth analysis of the Campus network traffic before and during
the outbreak.
8. Conclusions
To mitigate the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, the world issued
severe restrictions like social distancing and lockdown measures. This forced
people to change their habits and pushed them to online services for learning,
smart working and leisure, generating an unprecedented load on the Internet.
22

Since March 11th and still at the time of writing, Italy is facing a total
lockdown, with 80-90% of people forced to stay at home.
In this paper, we took the perspective of the Politecnico di Torino campus,
analyzing the changes in traffic patterns due to the lockdown measures and
the switch to online collaboration and e-learning solutions. We observe that
incoming traffic drastically decreased, while outgoing traffic has more than
doubled to support online learning.
Remote working and online collaboration exploded as well, with hundreds
of staff members using the Microsoft Teams collaboration platform, VPN and
remote desktop services to keep working from home. Since then PoliTO’s
in-house e-teaching infrastructure is serving more than 600 daily classes to
more than 16 000 students, generating peaks of 1.5 Gbit/s of traffic. We also
looked for eventual impairment suffered by students using different ISPs,
or connecting from different regions. Results show that the campus and the
Internet have proved robust to successfully cope with challenges and maintain
the university operations.
