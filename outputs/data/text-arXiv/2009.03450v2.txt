Abstract
We model the evolution of the covid-19 epidemic in Belgium with an age-structured extended SEIR-QD
epidemic model with separated consideration for nursing homes. All parameters of the model are estimated
using a MCMC method, except integrated data on social contacts. The model is calibrated on hospitals’
data, number of deaths, nursing homes’ tests and serological tests. We present the current situation in
November 2020 as well as long-term scenarios-based forecasts concerning the second wave and subsequent
lifting of measures.
Keywords: SARS-CoV-2, age-structured compartmental SEIR model, hospitalisation and mortality data,

1. Introduction
While there are many circulating different models concerning the covid-19 pandemic, it is important to
have dedicated models to the specific situation of each country since the evolution of the situation as well
as chosen political measures are different. SEIR-type epidemic models [1] are the most suitable for long
term forecasting and especially SEIR-QD variants concerning the covid-19 pandemic [2, 3]. We present one
of the very few existing extended SEIR-QD model adapted and calibrated on Belgium situation and data.
Two similar approaches have been developed by the SIMID COVID-19 team (UHasselt-UAntwerp) [4] and
the BIOMATH team (UGent) [5]. All of those models have their own characteristics and are complementary since it is difficult at this time to exactly know how to model the covid-19 in the best way. Another
alternative approach has also been developed at the VUB [6] as well as a meta-population model from the
SIMID COVID-19 team [7].
Here we summarise the main characteristics of our model. The Belgian population is divided into 8
compartments in order to take account of the different possible stages of the disease as well as the separation between asymptomatic and symptomatic people with a different infectiousness. Each compartment is
divided into 5 age classes with different characteristics concerning the behaviour and evolution of the disease.
The transmission of the coronavirus between all classes is computed using social contact data at different
places (home, work, school, leisure) [8]. Except social contact data, all of the 65 parameters of the model are
estimated using a Monte Carlo method, hence there is no assumption coming from studies in other countries.
Nursing homes are modelled as isolated entities in order to take account of the different spread timing of
the coronavirus compared to the general population. Specific parameters for the situation in nursing homes

take account of a variable hospitalisation policy based on hospitals load as well as a probability that deaths
coming directly from nursing homes are related to the covid-19. There is a specific estimation of potential
reimportations coming from travellers during the holiday period. The model is mainly calibrated using
hospitalisations and deaths using both incidence and prevalence data (depending on which one is the more
appropriate for the considered data) coming from Sciensano’s public raw data [9]. Additional constraints
on seroprevalence are coming from Sciensano’s serological studies on blood donors as reported in Sciensano
epidemiological reports [9]. The only positive PCR tests which are taken into consideration are those coming
from nursing homes from an overall test campaign in April-May.
In Section 2, we present a description of the model. Technical details are presented in Subsection 2.2
for the equations, Subsection 2.3 for the data and Subsection 2.4 for explanation of the calibration method.
Precise details on the timeline used and the full set of estimated parameters of the model are given in
Appendix A. The results and discussion Section 3 starts with a presentation of the current estimation from
the model in Subsection 3.1. Then we present a test on the validity of the model in Subsection 3.2, a middleterm forecast based on estimation of new policy mesures in Subsection 3.3 and finally some scenarios-based
long-term forecasts in Subsection 3.4.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. General description of the model
We consider the following age classes among the population: 0-24, 25-44, 45-64, 65-74 and 75+. Those
classes correspond to public available data, excepted that 75-84 and 85+ classes are merged since it is difficult to know which parts of them are present in nursing homes or homes for the elderly. Hence we assume
that the classes 0-24, 25-44, 45-64, 65-74 are only present among the general population, while the remaining
is divided between a general 75+ and a specific class of nursing homes residents.
The compartmental model is divided into the following compartments: Susceptible S (people who have
never been infected and are a priori susceptible to be infected), Exposed E (people who have just been
infected but are without any symptom and still not infectious, hence in latent period), Asymptomatic Infectious AI (this is the part of the exposed people who fall into a continuously asymptomatic disease, which
are infectious but with a reduced infectious probability due to their asymptomatic status and directly fall
into the recovered status after that period), Presymptomatic Infectious P I (this is the other part of the
exposed people who fall into a symptomatic disease, but symptoms do not appear directly, hence there is
an intermediate stage where people become infectious but still without any symptom and with an infectious
probability still reduced), Symptomatic Infectious SI (real disease period where the infectious probability is
higher – people in this compartment will eventually fall either in a recovered status or will be hospitalised,
and concerning nursing home, a significant part of them will directly die), Hospitalised Q (hospitalised people are considered as in quarantine for the model, since their contacts are almost inexistant), Deceased D
(deaths from the general population are assumed only coming from hospitalised people – there is a small
1% of exceptions which is not taken into consideration here – however, deaths from nursing homes are taken
into consideration and separated from deaths coming from hospitals), Recovered R (people who recovered
from the disease, from asymptomatic ones, symptomatic ones or from the hospital, and are assumed here
immune for the future). All those compartments exist for every age class. We do not consider in this model
any subdivision inside the hospital compartment.
In addition, 2000 isolated nursing homes of similar average size are considered with all those compartments. The transmission of infection from the general population to those nursing homes is modelled by a
random infection probability inside each nursing home, which is proportional to the number of infectious
people and assumed less important since the lockdown period.
A schematic view of the compartments with their relations is presented in Figure 1.

Several additional or adaptive parameters are considered in order to better catch the reality. A specific
probability parameter is catching the fact that only a part of deaths directly coming from nursing homes
are due to the covid-19. A specific corrective coefficient is used to correct the new hospitalisations data
since patients initially hospitalised for another reason are not officially considered in the data. Recovery
and death rated from hospitals are considered variable in time in order to take the continuous improvement
of care methods into account. A variable hospitalisation policy is considered for nursing homes during the
first wave (period March-June) since residents are less likely to be hospitalised when the hospital load is
important. This variable hospitalisation policy is not applied during the second wave in order to catch the
reality on the ground.
Policy changes, according to Belgian epidemic’ schedule, are monitored using different coefficients for the
social contact matrices. Social contacts are divided into 4 categories: home (inside home and nearby family),
work (with transport), school and leisure (with other places). All contacts are considered at 100% during
the period up to March 14, 2020. Then reduced percentages are estimated by the model for the different
periods of lockdown and phases of lift of measures. These reduced percentages are the effect at the same
time of mobility restrictions, social distancing, prevention mesures, testing and contact tracing, while it is
mathematically impossible to determine the exact part of those effects. Hence new parameters for some or
all social contact types are estimated each time there is an important policy change. The timeline and the
considered coefficients are described in Appendix A with the full list of estimated parameters. Long-term
scenarios-based forecasts are constructed assuming a constant policy and compliance to measures during the
future with different realistic possibilities of percentage of social contacts for still unknown policy effects.
This model takes into consideration potential reimportations of covid-19 from abroad during the holidays period. No reimportation is assumed in June since borders where barely opened. Reimportations
are estimated during the period July to September using the following method: According to 2019 travel
trends [10], we consider a proportionality of travellers of 36% in July, 26% in August and 21% in September.
There is no data available concerning the inhomogeneous repartition inside each month, but we assume a
homogeneous one for July and August while a 2 to 1 ratio between the first half of September and the second
half. Only the top five countries of destination are considered with the following proportion: France 23%,
Spain 11%, Italy 9% and The Netherlands 7% (Belgium is discarded). Then for each of those countries we
consider the daily ECDC statistics on cumulative numbers for 14 days of covid-19 cases per 100000 [11]. The
reimportation are added using an estimated global coefficient and injected proportionally in the exposed
compartiment of the classes 0-24, 25-44, 45-64 and 65-74 and removed from the corresponding susceptible
compartments. The estimated reimportations per day are presented in Appendix A.
This model does not take into consideration not officially observed effects like seasonality or crossimmunity. The population is only age-structured and not spatially structured. A spatial refinement of such
a model would be really important, but currently the public data officially provided are not of sufficient
detail in order to correctly fit a complex spatial-structured model.

Table 1: Main parameters of the model

The transmission is governed by the so-called social contact hypothesis [12]. Social contact matrices Mij
(WAIFW) are collected using the SOCRATES online tool [8] and the 2010 dataset [13]. Work and transport
categories are merged as well as leisure and otherplace. 4 different parameters which are adapted depending
on lockdown/policy mesures are used as coefficients, hence the complete contact matrices are:
Mij = Chome Mij home + Cwork Mij work + Cschool Mij school + Cleisure Mij leisure
During the holiday period (July-September), several elements are removed each day from the Si classes
and added to the Ei class according to estimated travellers and estimated average infection in the visited
countries with a global coefficient Creimp (as explained in Section 2.1).
The time-dependence of some parameters is computed using a logistic function with estimated parameters

Constants of the model are N0−24 = 3250000, N25−44 = 3000000, N45−64 = 3080000, N65−74 = 1150000
and N75+ = 870000 outside nursing homes (with an additional Nh = 150000 inside nursing homes) for a
total population of N = 11500000. Those numbers are round numbers coming from the structure of the
Belgian population as provided by the Belgian Federal Government on April 2020 [14]. An initial condition
p0 is proportionally distributed between the Ei on day 1 among the general population (corresponding to
March 1 reported situation = February 29 real situation). Nursing homes are assumed not initially infected.

Most of the parameters are similar to the general population (but assumed with different values) with
some additional considerations. There are 2000 nursing homes considered as separated entities, with a constant population of 75 inside each one, for a total of Nh = 150000 residents. New entrances are considered
in order to fit the empty places up to 75 residents per nursing home and are removed from the 75+ susceptible class. Transmissions inside a specific nursing home follow usual SEIR-type transmission with a specific
coefficient mh . Transmissions from the general population is computed in a particular way using a daily
probability of infection, i.e. each day one additional (integer) infected resident is added with probability
P λ (AI +P I )+λ SI
Pth S̄h j a j N j s j , where the coefficient is distinguished between the initial phase Pth and lock0
down and subsequent phases Pth
. S̄h means the number of susceptibles within the specific nursing home.
Starting from lockdown, transmissions are only considered from the 25-65 population (i.e. with j = 25 − 44
and 45 − 64) since transmissions are mainly from nursing homes’ workers. Potential reverse transmissions
are however not monitored here. Deaths from care centres through hospitalisations are counted within the
75+ class. Additional deaths from care homes are monitored using a death rate r̃h with a coefficient Pcor
which captures the probability that the death is covid-19 related. Remaining non-covid-19 related deaths
are assumed occurring in the susceptible class (or in the recovered class if the first one is empty). For the
first wave only (March 1 to June 30) a variable hospitalisation policy is computed in order to correspond to
the reality and using variable parameters of constant sum δh (t) + Pcor r̃h (t) = δh , the proportion being monitored over time by a logistic function depending on hospitals load with an additional delay, with estimated
parameters Pdelay , µhosp and shosp :

This variable hospitalisation policy is nonexistent for the second wave since most of nursing home residents
are hospitalised during this period. Hence from July 1, those parameters are considered with the value Q = 0.

2.3. Considered data
We consider the following data for the calibration of the model coming from Sciensano’s public raw data
(October 31, 2020 release):
• New hospitalisations (incidence) with an additional corrective estimated parameter SUPPhosp which
estimates the percentage of missing covid-19 patients at the time of admission (hence catching supplementary patients not initially hospitalised for covid-19 and transferred from other units)
• Hospital load (prevalence)
• Released from hospital (cumulative)
• Total deaths from hospital (cumulative)
• Deaths (incidence) from age classes 45-64, 65-74, 75+ (incidence data are more suitable for those
classes since there are a percentage of deaths for which the age class is unknown and prevalence data
could contain an accumulation of errors)
• Deaths (cumulative) from all age classes (cumulative data are more suitable for the 0-24, 25-44 classes
since incidence data are almost zero)
• Deaths from nursing homes (incidence and cumulative)
• Total deaths (incidence and cumulative)
Deaths reported with a specific date are considered on that specific date while situations reported by
hospitals are considered to occur up to 24h before the hospital report hence 2 days before the official data
communication. Note that graphics are plotted using the dates of Sciensano’s communications (1 day delay).
Additional constraints are considered coming from Sciensano’s epidemiological reports [9] (those constraints determine the set of admissibles parameters). Serological studies on blood donors are considered in
the following way: the ratio between immune
P people (for the classes 25-44, 45-64 and 65-74) coming directly
from the asymptomatic compartment ( i P
AI → R) and the total asymptomatic population who has not
developed a symptomatic covid-19 disease ( i S + E + AI + [IA → R] + P I) should be respectively between
0.5% and 2.8% 7 days before March 30 and between 3.5% and 6.2% 7 days before April 14, April 27 and
May 11 (the 7 day delay is here to take the needed time to build a detectable immunity into account). There
are also constraints on parameters as e.g. pa 0−24 > pa 25−44 > . . . in order to reproduce the more severity of the covid-19 on older persons as well as trivial constraints to avoid negative or out-of-bound parameters.
Additional constraints are imposed on nursing homes coming from the result of massive PCR test on
April-May: the average percentage of infected people should be 8% ± 3% during the period April 15-30
and less than 2% ± 2% during the period May 15-31. Those percentages are estimated from Sciensano’s
epidemiological reports using a calculated incidence between each week. Additionally, the average percentage
of asymptomatic residents (including presymptomatic ones) among infected should be 75% ± 10%.

2.4. Calibration method
All parameters are estimated using a MCMC Metropolis–Hastings algorithm [17]. Two different modes
are used for the calibration and the statistical analysis:
• Best-fit burning mode: an optimised First-choice hill climbing algorithm using weighted least-squares
performed on one parameter at a time (i.e. one neighbour = variation of one parameter), with downhill
moves allowed up to 0.2% in order to avoid local optima and with a quick best fit search performed
on accepted neighbours
• MCMC mode: a Metropolis–Hastings algorithm performed on all parameters (i.e. one neighbour =
variation of all parameters) where the likelihood fonction is constructed using the property that the
2
2
∼
empirical variance from n data follows up to a coefficient a χ2 distribution (we use nS
σ 2 ∼ χ (n) =
N (n, 2n) with σ estimated from the burning period)
Weights for least-squares are defined in the following way: For each set of data (and each age class), the
weight is chosen such that a best fit search considering only those data (hence a best fit discarding all other
data) gives similar empirical variance. Hence each sort of data gives a similar contribution to the likelihood.
For data with both incidence and prevalence numbers considered, the contribution of incidence numbers
is favoured at ∼80%. From this method, we obtained the following weights: hospitalisations prevalence 1,
released 1, deaths from hospital 10, deaths 0-24 5000, deaths 25-44 1000, deaths 45-64 2000 incidence 2
prevalence, deaths 65-74 500 incidence 1 prevalence, deaths 75+ 200 incidence 0.5 prevalence, deaths from
nursing homes 100 incidence 0.2 prevalence, total deaths 100 incidence 0.2 prevalence. New hospitalisations
data (indicence) have a specific period-dependent weight since the noise is very different between wave periods and low hospitalisations periods: 2 first wave period (March 1-June 7), 100 intermediate period (June
8 - August 31), 10 second wave period (September 1-. . . ).
The program is written is C language. The full ODEs are solved by numerical integration using the
GNU gsl odeiv2 librairy and a Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg45 integrator. The computation is performed on the
HPC cluster Hercules2 1 .
The method of approaching global minima is particular due to the presence of a very high number of
estimated parameters, a large number of numerical integrations to be performed (due to the presence of
2000 separated nursing homes) and the fact that the algorithm should not take several days to complete in
order to quickly produce previsions of the epidemic. Hence the method is separated into different steps. In
a first time, a set of best-fit search is performed from a very large distribution (100 times usual standard
deviation) using 5000000 iterations with a 10 times average step and a special trick to increase the rapidity
of the algorithm: instead of 2000 different nursing homes, only 100 nursing homes are considered with each
time 20 copies of each. This approximation is suitable as long as the algorithm is still far from the bestfit. In a second time, the best-fit search is pursued for 20000 iterations using the complete 2000 different
nursing homes in order to affine parameters. A set of at least 250 different priors is collected from the
best obtained results. In a third time, the MCMC algorithm is performed from the 250 priors, with 50000
iterations retaining every 5000 iterations. This produces a set of 2500 samples coming from potentially
different local minima zones which avoids a too high autocorrelation of the results. Since the first step is
very time-consuming, further runs of the model are performed without a complete recalibration, by reusing
the previous 2500 samples as a set from which 250 random priors are taken and running a 20000 burning
best-fit period before the MCMC step. This is a kind of data assimilation process. Recalibration should
however be performed each time there is a major change in the model or in the policy.

3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Current estimations
We present in this Section the result of the calibration of the model as on November 1, 2020, with
considered data up to October 31, 2020. Results are presented in the figures with medians, 5% and 95%
percentiles, hence with a 90% confidence interval.

Figure 2: General view on prevalence data and estimations

In Figure 2, we have a general representation of the evolution of the epidemic in Belgium with hospitalisations, people discharged from hospitals and deaths coming from hospitals and from nursing homes, all in
prevalence or cumulative numbers. The interest in modelling the epidemic within nursing homes separately
from the general population can clearly be seen on this figure. Indeed, the form of the death curve for
nursing homes is really different from the ones for the general population since the epidemic started a few
time later in nursing homes but took a bigger proportion. Note that the very small percentage of deaths
occurring at another places is not taken into consideration in this model.
The model calibration fits the real prevalence data with a very good exactitude (excluding of course data
noises) despite that fact that the calibration is mostly done on incidence data. The comparison between the
model and some incidence data are presented in Figure 3 for the general incidence data in hospitalisations
and deaths and in Figure 4 for incidence data in deaths with age class repartition. The consideration of a
continuous improvement of care was needed in order to correctly fit the death curves among the different
periods. However, the figure 2 presents a slightly larger increase than expected for the deaths within the
class 75+. This could be the result of a small decrease in the quality of care during the second wave due to
the huge load of the hospitals (but still better than during the first wave).

Figure 3: Incidence in new hospitalisations (with underreporting correction) and deaths

Figure 4: Incidence deaths within each age class

We must remark that in order to obtain a correct fit we needed to introduce specific elements within
the model. Incidence data on new hospitalisations are underroported. Indeed, somme patients are initially
admitted for another reason than covid-19 and only transferred in a covid-19 section afterwards. This results
in more people going out from hospitals than officially entering. The model estimates those supplementary
patients at 23.1% [16.4% ; 28.7%]. Real data in Figure 3 are plotted with the estimated correction.

10

Deaths coming directly from nursing homes are not all due to covid-19 since many PCR tests are lacking.
The model estimates that only 83.6% [66.7% ; 89.4%] of those deaths are really due to covid-19. The ratio
between deaths coming directly from nursing homes and deceased patients in hospitals coming initially from
nursing homes seems to be not constant, and it was necessary to introduce a variable hospitalisation policy. The best answer found was to monitor hospitalisations from nursing homes through a logistic function
depending on general hospital load but with a specific delay. Hence, when hospital load starts to become
too important, less people from nursing homes are hospitalised and the reverse effect occurs when hospital
load gets lower, but each time with a delay estimated at 10.5 days [9.0 ; 12.4]. However, this variable hospitalisation policy turned out to be unsuitable for the second wave period since there a is better attention
to residents in nursing homes.
Initially the model overestimated the number of deaths from the end of the first wave. It was not possible
to calibrate constant death rates throughout all phases of the epidemic. This is the consequence of both
a care improvement in hospitals and a lower aggressiveness of the virus. Hence death and recovered rates
within each age class are also monitored by a logistic function depending on time. The current improvement
(in comparison to the very beginning of the epidemic) is estimated as 62.6% [54.6% ; 67.1%], hence 62.6%
of patients which should have died in March are now recovering from hospitals. We must remark that it is
impossible to know which part is due to care improvement and which part is due to lower aggressiveness of
the virus and that the death rate seems to restart becoming a bit higher in October.
The basic reproduction number R0 , representing the average number of cases directly generated by one
infectious case in a population which is assumed totally susceptible, is estimated in average for each period
(we consider this number dependent on lockdown measures) and computed as the leading eigenvalue of the
next-generation matrix (cf. Section 2.2 for details). The effective reproduction number Rt (or Re ) represents
the average number of cases directly generated by one infectious case taking account of the already immune
population, hence varying over a period. The estimations are presented in Table 2.

Table 2: Estimations of R0 and Rt values

The reproduction number of the pre-lockdown period is a bit overestimated. This is probably due to
the fact that the model does not take explicitly account of infections coming from abroad travellers at this
particular time and this results in an estimated R0 slightly above 4. For the period phase 1A-1B-2, since
there were policy changes almost every weeks, we only provide here the estimated R0 at the end of this
period. The second wave R0 does not take account of the new measure applied in October 19 whose effets
should only be visible on November. We can see that the estimated R0 inside nursing homes is very low.
This seems logical since nursing homes with only one infected resident do not necessary end with a majority
of infections. This implies however that the important spreading of the covid-19 inside some nursing homes
is due in a great part to several importations, probably due to staff members. However, we must remark
that the uncertainty concerning this reproduction number is very huge, probably the result of disparities
among nursing homes.

The infection fatality rate (IFR) can be estimated using the total set of recovered people according to
the model (hence including untested and asymptomatic people). Due to the consideration of variable death
rates, the IFR is different from the early period of the epidemic and the last months. Estimations are
presented in Table 3. The mean and last period are limited to September since October data need some
consolidation regarding the number of deaths.

Table 3: Infection fatality rate estimations

Table 4 presents some estimations concerning some characteristics of the disease coming from the model.
The set of asymtomatic people probably includes mild symptomatic people. The model cannot really detect
the exact time when symptoms appear, hence the end of the incubation period merely corresponds to the
estimated time when the infectiousness becomes more important. The total disease duration for symptomatic
peoples is only for those who are not hospitalised. The hospitalisation duration is the average until discharged
or deceased (no distinction is provided) at the beginning of the epidemic, hence before care improvement.
The duration for asymptomatic nursing homes’ residents cannot really be estimated by the model. Indeed,
once a single nursing home (or an isolated part of it) is completely infected, asymptomatic infected residents
can remain forever ill without any new possible contamination, hence there is no boundary on such duration
coming from the available data, so this excessive duration must be considered as an outlier.

uncertainties are uncertainties on those averages, not on the individual values.

3.2. Confrontation of previous calibrations
One way to test the robustness of a model is to confront previous predictions with current reality. This
model can provide forecasts in two different ways. When new policy interventions are expected or a specific
behaviour change is planned due to the calendar, it is possible to extrapolate the future transmission of the
covid-19 (monitored here by the number of contacts) using relative percentage of transmission in comparaison to the pre-lockdown phase. This percentage can only be a vague estimate of what could be the real
transmission and it is sometimes suitable to look at several different scenarios. On the other hand, when no
new policy intervention is expected for a certain time, it is possible to have a more precise forecast based
on current estimated contacts (what we call the current behaviour), forecast which is only valid up to the
next policy intervention.
12

We present two previous forecasts from the model. The first one, presented in Figure 5a is a 2 1/2
months old forecast based on the specific scenario that the transmission at school from September 1 would
be at a level of 75% due to sanitary measures like masks wearing. The second one presented in Figure 5b
is a 1 month old forecast based on the current behaviour and the estimation from the model of the number
of contacts, which was estimated at that time to be 69.7% [44.2% ; 88.6%]. Those previous confrontation
highlight the fact that the uncertainty must be taken into consideration for any forecast.

(a) Forecast from August 17

(b) Forecast from September 28

Figure 5: Previous forecast from August 17 based on the scenario of a 75% transmission at school from September 1 and from
September 28 based on the continuation of current behaviour. The strong line represents the median, continuous lines represent
deciles (10% percentiles) while dashed lines represent ventiles (5% percentiles).

3.3. Middle-term scenario-based forecast
Every forecast is hypothetical. New measures that have not been tested cannot really be estimated on
the level of their impact and it is impossible to predict evolution in compliance to them from the population
as well as future policy changes. This is why any realistic forecast must rely on the assumption of a perfect
continuity of measures and compliance for elements which are a priori not suspected to change soon and on
different hypothetical scenarios for untested modifications of measures.
In response to the large second wave in Belgium, authorities have decided to enforce new measures on
October 19 as closing bars and restaurants, reducing the allowed social contact (known as bubble) to one
person, promoting teleworking and establishing a curfew during the night. On November 2, a soft lockdown
is put into place, with closure of non-essential shops, teleworking mandatory, leisure mostly reduced and
social contacts even more reduced. Schools are closed during 2 weeks and then reopen with a 5/6 attendance
(except for universities).
While it is impossible to know with precision the impact from those measures, we can estimate that
the effect from the soft lockdown could be comparable to the effect of the first lockdown, since the small
remaining liberties could be balanced by generalised sanitary measures like mask wearing. The effects from
October 19 measures is more incertain, but should be situated between September behaviour and lockdown
behaviour. Hence the most realistic middle-term scenario is to consider a half reduction on contacts (work,
leisure and family) from September situation in comparaison to the first lockdown on October 19, with a
full reduction applied from November 2 until the December 13 planned deadline. Schools are considered at
0% transmission from November 2 to November 15 and at 5/6 thereafter. Every contacts are assumed to
be restored at September level after December 13 (except for usual school closures).
13

In Figure 6a, we present the estimated effect on hospital load from those measures. We must note that,
according to those measures and to the model, the theoretical maximum capacity of 10000 hospital beds in
Belgium should be almost reached but not exceeded, at least in an average national level. Figure 6b presents
the expected mortality in case of the new measures scenario. We must remark that this expected mortality
relies on a constant quality of care that may not be maintained.

(b) Deaths forecast for new measures scenario (with ventiles)

(c) Estimated prevalence (confidence interval 90%)

(d) Potential seroprevalence (confidence interval 90%)

Figure 6: Middle-term scenario with potential effects from new measures applied on October 19 and November 2. The first
figure presents a comparison of the hospital load with or without the effects from the new measures. The others figures present
the previsions on mortality, prevalence and seroprevalence.

From the model, we can also extrapolate the evolution of the virus through the whole population over
time. In Figure 6c, we present the estimated percentage of infected people over time for each age class.
We can clearly see the effect of mid-March lockdown measures on children and working people. The effect
of lockdown measures on older people (especially 75+) is less important since the curve is broken in a less
effective manner. Concerning the second wave, we can see that the virus is really present among the very
young population due to two complete months of school opening. This prevalence is completely shut down
by the two weeks closure and should be brought at a lower level than other age classes.
14

In Figure 6d, we present the estimated percentage of recovered people, hence the estimated percentage
of immunity acquired within each age class if we make the assumption that a constant immunity is granted
to recovered people. Such a constant immunity is not guaranteed for the moment, but recent studies show
that antibodies should be present after several months for a large majority of the population [18]. The
seroprevalence is calibrated using blood donors tests results (around 1.3% on March 30 and 4.7% on April
14) [9]. Since those tests where only performed on an (almost) asymptomatic population which have not
developed covid-19 symptoms from the past 4 weeks, the model extrapolates immunity coming also from
the symptomatic population and from nursing homes. Note that we allow a 7 days delay in our model after
recovering to be sure of the detectability of the anticorps. Table 5 presents the detail of some seroprevalence
estimation.

3.4. Long-term scenarios-based forecasts
The model allows to construct long-term scenarios which are very suitable to study the potential impact
from a specific measure. The possibilities are numerous but we present in this section a simple study of the
potential impact of an increase in contacts at a specific place (school, family, work and leisure). The increase
is perform from January 4, 2021 up to June 30, 2021, when the risk of an emerging third wave is present.
We work here with the assumption that there is no modification on the set of susceptible people except
from natural infection, hence with the assumption that a lasting immunity is granted to recovered people.
This hypothesis could be modified negatively in the future if the probability of a reinfection is important or
positively is the immunity is artificially increased by the arrival of a vaccine.
The baseline scenario is the restart of all activities on January 4 with similar transmissions/contacts as
in September. Those estimated contacts percentage are 91.6% [39.5 %; 99.3%] for school contacts, 51.5%
[46.8 %; 54.6%] for family contacts, 8.9% [5.8 %; 13.6%] for work contacts and 30.7% [18.1 %; 56.7%] for
leisure contacts. We remind here that those percentages do not correspond to the exact number of contact as determined by the attendance, but to the reduced transmission in comparison to the pre-lockdown
period as the result of decrease of contacts but also of sanitary measures. This could explain while the
transmission is estimated at a very low level at work since sanitary measures and social distancing are
more respected than during leisures or among family. The high transmission percentage at school does not
necessarily mean that schools are the engine of the virus transmission since most of the student are asymptomatic with a reduced infectiousness, and the uncertainty is still very important concerning this percentage.
The baseline scenario is presented in Figure 7a together with the potential impact of a full transmission
at school, hence a transmission without any sanitary measure as well as without any quarantine imposed by
the testing and tracing process. We can see that the baseline scenario itself provides a non-zero probability
of a third wave but still particularly low. The full contacts at school scenario increases a bit this probability
to a reasonable extent.
Increases in family contacts, work contacts and leisure contacts are presented in Figures 7b, 7c and
7d with each time a hypothetical increase of 10% or 20%. Those increase must be understood as a nonproportional increase (e.g. a work increase of 10% corresponds to 8.9% + 10% = 18.9%). We can clearly see
that an increase in leisure contact has the most important effect on the evolution of the epidemic and could
lead to a potentially problematic third wave. Full transmission scenarios for family, work or leisure cannot
be taken as realistic since they would provide a complete explosion in the absence of vaccine.

3.5. Conclusion
We have presented an age-structured SEIR-QD type model with a large number of ameliorations as
a specific consideration for nursing homes, variable parameters and reimportation from travellers. Those
ameliorations were important in order to catch the specificity of the epidemic in Belgium.
The model allows to have a good study of the current behaviour of the epidemic, with an estimation
of hidden elements like the real prevalence of the virus and the potential evolution of the immunity. More
important, the model allows to construct scenarios-based forecasts in order to estimate the potential impact
from new policy measures and can explicitly serve, in complement of others models, to policy makers.
However, the model suffers from several limitations which would be important to try to solve in order to
better catch the evolution of the epidemic. In particular, we can say that the lack of spatial consideration
is only a huge approximation of the reality, even if the Belgian country is small and very connected. The
compartmental distinction is limited to asymptomatic and symptomatic while there are several variations
of the severity and hospitals are considered as a unique homogeneous element. Furthermore, the lack of
16

refinement inside age classes is a brake on the study of interesting scenarios, as e.g. studying the separated
impact from transmission at primary school, secondary school or university. We must remark however that
such a distinction is impossible without sufficiently refined data, and those are not publicly released in
Belgium, which is very problematic for quality scientific research.
