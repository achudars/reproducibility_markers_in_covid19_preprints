Abstract
We discuss the pros of adopting government-issued digital currencies as
well as a supranational digital iCurrency. One such pro is to get rid of
paper money (and coinage), a ubiquitous medium for spreading

germs, as highlighted by the recent coronavirus outbreak. We set
forth three policy recommendations for adapting mobile devices
as new digital wallets, regulatory oversight of sovereign digital
currencies and user data protection, and a supranational digital
iCurrency for facilitating international digital monetary linkages.

Money is dirty. Literally. Surfaces of banknotes can be laden with harmful bacteria such
as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, E. coli, Pseudonomnas aeruoginosa, bacillus
cereus, influenza viruses, yeast, fungi, human excreta, mold, and even cocaine and heroin.6 The
recent coronavirus outbreak (the infectious disease COVID-19 caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2
[CDC, 2020]), that originated in Wuhan, China, has put a new emphasis on disease transmission
through paper money. People’s Bank of China announced mid February 2020 its new
measures, to wit, disinfecting and destroying cash to help reduce the spread of the coronavirus
[Yeung, 2020]. This begs the question: Does the latest coronavirus outbreak make yet another
case for digital money?
In this age of 5G internet and so many aspects of our lives gone digital and mobile,
paper money (not to mention coins) seems archaic, if not barbaric. At the 2017 National
Governors Association Summer Meeting, Tesla CEO Elon Musk compared driving a nonautonomous car in 2037 to riding a horse [Galeon, 2017]. Unlike autonomous cars, switching to
purely digital money is not associated with direct human safety concerns. Quite the contrary,
ridding the society of paper money (and coinage) would get rid of a ubiquitous medium for
spreading germs. So, what are we – the society – waiting for?
There is no technological obstacle to adopting digital money – only political and
regulatory adjustments are required. Carrying cash in a physical wallet is not any safer than
“carrying” digital currency on a mobile device. Yes, a mobile device can be lost or stolen, but so
can be a physical wallet. When the latter occurs, credit and debit cards can be misused in a
fraudulent manner all the same; however, the issuers have some safeguards for that. The loss
of cash is limited to the amount in the wallet, but unlike a credit or debit card issuer, the
Federal Reserve (or, more generally, a central bank) or the Treasury cannot protect the carrier
of cash against such “fraudulent use” (that is, theft); nor is the carrier protected against
pathogens such as the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, possibly lurking on the banknote surfaces. And
there is no reason why risks cannot be mitigated in digital wallets by setting certain limits, akin
to carrying a fixed amount of cash in one’s physical wallet – with the added bonus that the
carrier of digital cash never has to touch anything laden with pathogens.

See, e.g., [Abrams and Waterman, 1972], [Angelakis et al, 2014], [Jenkins, 2001], [Maron, 2017], [Oyler, Darwin
and Cone, 1996], [Pope et al, 2002], [Tanglao, 2014], [Thomas et al, 2008], [Vriesekoop et al, 2010].

Indeed, unlike exchanging cash, exchanging digital money requires no physical contact
whatsoever, be it peer-to-peer, customer-to-vendor, etc. Everything can be done via scans and
other touchless technologies (e.g., when paying for coffee). Even getting cash from an ATM –
another archaic device – requires touching surfaces such as touch-screens and/or keypads. This
too spreads germs without adding any tangible value to anyone. The World Health
Organization is already encouraging using contactless payment technologies where possible as
banknotes may be spreading the coronavirus [Gardner, 2020], [Huang, 2020]. So, here is our
Policy Recommendation No. 1: Adapt the framework of a mobile device (such as a
mobile phone) as the new digital wallet with simple and easy-to-follow rules that encourage
peer-to-peer, customer-to-vendor and other digital transactions involving mobile devices.7
Digital money with touchless mobile payments is the future, just as autonomous
vehicles. ATMs and physical cash are the past, just as horses. However, unlike Elon Musk’s
aforesaid autonomous vehicle vs. horse analogy, in the future there will be no physical cash. All
money will be digital as from a practical viewpoint there is no reason for a hybrid system.
Consider this. Unless one has nefarious motives such as money laundering, tax evasion, illicit
drug trade and other illegal activities [Rogoff, 2016], there is no compelling reason to cling to
cash. Yes, government-issued purely digital money (see below) will give more control to the
government. However, freedom cannot be unlimited – we do not live in an anarchy. Certain
freedoms must be sacrificed for the greater good. And if ridding the society of physical cash
can save lives, depriving all kinds of shady characters of their ability to use cash for illegal
purposes is a small price to pay.8 Does anyone really believe that, say, 100 years from now we
will still have paper money? And, per Elon Musk, if autonomous vehicles are the norm in 20
years from now, then it is difficult to believe that purely digital money will not be.
One may argue that cash – especially in smaller denominations – is still useful for
making anonymous (e.g., “vice-related”, but otherwise innocuous) purchases (see, e.g.,
[Solomon, 2017]). Indeed, the populace’s liberal freedoms should not suffer unnecessarily.
However, one can imagine various simple solutions, such as small-denomination digital gift
cards without the bearer’s identity. Such an anonymous gift card will have to be purchased

For a discussion of Fintech/mobile payment adoption across different regions, see, e.g., [IMF and WBG, 2019].
Prof. Kenneth Rogoff has argued that a cashless society will also benefit the poor (see, e.g., [Solomon, 2017]).

through a regular digital wallet and can be argued to still be traceable. However, so are cash
withdrawals from ATMs. Sweden will be cashless by 2023 [Finextra, 2019], but not vice-free.
To be clear, by digital money we do not mean Bitcoin [Nakamoto, 2008] and other
decentralized cryptocurrencies, or Libra-like [The Libra Association, 2019]9 cryptocurrencies
issued by a consortium of private (including for-profit) entities. Instead, we mean digital money
issued by sovereign governments (see, e.g., [Kakushadze and Liew, 2018] and references
therein), and a universal digital iCurrency proposed in [Kakushadze and Liew, 2015, 2018] (also
see [Kakushadze and Yu, 2019]) issued by a broad consortium of sovereign governments. Thus,
realistically, mass-adoption of digital money is difficult to imagine without it being issued by a
government (or a governmental agency) and having an appropriate regulatory oversight (in the
case of national digital currencies such as the rumored-soon-to-be-forthcoming “digital Yuan”
of China),10 or by a broad consortium of governments for supranational adoption [Kakushadze
and Liew, 2018], [Kakushadze and Yu, 2019]. One glaring advantage of government-issued vs.
decentralized digital currencies is no need for energy-wasteful mining11 (as in, e.g., Bitcoin).12
The necessity for a regulatory oversight appears to be a foregone conclusion (see, e.g.,
[USHCFS, 2019]); however, some basic protections must be put in place, which brings us to our
Policy Recommendation No. 2: A sovereign digital currency must be regulated by
governmental agencies with all transactions recorded and monitored to identify nefarious
actors and prevent fraudulent activities. However, the golden rule is that this data cannot be
sold (including to commercial entities), or used for political gain.13
Digital money would therefore seem a win-win, but there are forces out there resistant
to change.14 So, other than nefarious actors, who stands to lose most from doing away with the
status quo and adopting digital currency? Table 2 in [Kakushadze and Liew, 2018] summarizes
pros and cons to some stakeholders from government-issued digital currencies. Here let us
mention two of the stakeholders that would be adversely affected by digital money.

For a detailed discussion of various issues with Libra, see, e.g., [Kakushadze and Yu, 2019] and references therein.
See, e.g., [Horsley, 2020].
11
For a consortium, 100 or so members would suffice [Kakushadze and Liew, 2018], [Kakushadze and Yu, 2019].
12
For some literature on inefficiency and unsustainability issues, see, e.g., [Bariviera, 2017], [Kostakis and
Giotitsas, 2014], [Nadarajah and Chu, 2017], [Urquhart, 2016], [Vranken, 2017].

First, we have commercial banks, whose existing business model is jeopardized by digital
money, most notably due to lower fees. Second, we have central banks and governments,
which in many instances perceive digital currency as a threat to the existing monetary system
(including through its cannibalization). However, there is a flipside to this too: the issuergovernments stand to gain, not lose, control as – unlike with paper money – with digital money
all transactions are recorded and the information is readily available to the authorities; albeit
this information should only be used to prevent nefarious activities.15 In this regard, the U.S. is
the sovereign state with most to lose in the process of the inevitably forthcoming avalanche of
government-issued digital currencies, with a clear policy implication: adapt to the changing
reality, issue the digital dollar sooner rather than later, or risk being marginalized [Kakushadze
and Liew, 2018] – including by China (see, e.g., [Horsley, 2020]) and other players.16
It is difficult to imagine mass adoption of digital currencies unless they are issued by
governments (or governmental agencies) with streamlined rules and regulations. What would
be truly remarkable in this regard is a supranational digital currency, which was termed
iCurrency in [Kakushadze and Liew, 2015], backed by a broad consortium of sovereign
governments [Kakushadze and Liew, 2018], [Kakushadze and Yu, 2019]. iCurrency would allow
more precise estimation of global inflation, global output, global productivity, global labor
gains, and other global macroeconomic indicators, as well as GDP (gross domestic product) for
various countries and regions and globally. (GDP measured using iCurrency was termed iGDP in
[Kakushadze and Liew, 2015].) With low sovereign government intervention (which requires a
democratic protocol for the issuing consortium of sovereign governments) and low fees for
global transactions, iCurrency should be a boon to our global economy. Perhaps somewhat
ironically, government-issued digital currencies may be a step forward (not backward) in this
regard, depending on how the world leaders approach this issue. This brings us to our

15

In the U.S. the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 (or BSA) [Meltzer, 1991], among other things, requires financial
institutions to file a Currency Transaction Report (CTR) with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN)
for all transactions exceeding $10,000. The U.S. Government records and stores information about all such
transactions internally. This information is invaluable in light of the U.S. dollar being the dominant reserve
currency [Kakushadze and Liew, 2018].
16
The Federal Reserve has been looking into developing a digital currency in the U.S. for some time – see, e.g.,
[Heeb, 2019]. For the digital dollar to be competitive, reducing tax rates and not taxing non-US-derived income
might be required [Kakushadze and Liew, 2018].

5

Policy Recommendation No. 3: Digital monetary linkages across countries would be
facilitated by a supranational digital iCurrency issued by a consortium of sovereign
governments. The iCurrency transaction data would be accessible to the appropriate
governmental agencies of the consortium member countries subject to the limitations set forth
in our Policy Recommendation No. 2 above.17
Quoting from [Kakushadze and Liew, 2015]: “If mankind is destined to make it to Mars
(and beyond) and establish extraterrestrial colonies in our solar system, a universal currency
devoid of government control and other forms of manipulation would appear to be a necessity,
rather than wishful thinking.” So, ridding our monetary system of paper money indeed appears
to be a win-win: among many other things, not only would it be good for our global economy,
but it would also get rid of a ubiquitous medium for spreading germs and help save lives, so we
would have one fewer worry in times of crises such as the latest coronavirus outbreak.
Finally, let us address the elephant in the room as it relates to iCurrency, which is the
U.S. – the hegemon in the current International Monetary System. Why would/should the U.S.
want iCurrency? Actually, there are two somewhat separate issues here: i) the U.S.’s leverage
in dealing with its adversaries; and ii) the U.S. dollar being the dominant reserve currency.
Thus, SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, S.W.I.F.T.
SCRL), the leading worldwide network for cross-border payments, is a cooperative society
operating under the Belgian law and is owned by its member financial institutions. However,
the U.S. is still able to get its way by, e.g., levying sanctions on SWIFT if the latter does not
cooperate (see, e.g., [Gladstone, 2012]). In this regard, if there is a supranational iCurrency and
SWIFT is replaced by another network for cross-border payments in iCurrency, the U.S.’s
leverage will not be diminished as it can levy sanctions all the same.18 The U.S.’s leverage does
not lie in it directly controlling SWIFT (which it does not), or that the U.S. dollar is the dominant
reserve currency. Instead, it stems from the U.S. being the largest and most stable economy,
and most wish to avoid their U.S. assets frozen, travel restricted, or being otherwise sanctioned.
17

As mentioned above, what we are proposing here is not adopting decentralized or Libra-like cryptocurrencies as
national digital currencies or a supranational iCurrency, but government-issued and appropriately regulated
sovereign digital currencies and a supranational digital iCurrency issued by a broad consortium of governments.
However, regulatory sentiments around the world for cryptocurrencies are still instructive; see, e.g., [GLRC, 2018].
18
E.g., if, hypothetically, Ripple started processing payments for Iran, it would invariably draw the U.S.’s ire.

6

In fact, if the transaction data for a supranational iCurrency is accessible to the member
states (as set forth in our Policy Recommendation No. 3 above), the U.S. stands to gain, not
lose, as it will have an (essentially) unfettered access to all iCurrency transaction data, globally.
Now, what about iCurrency replacing the U.S. dollar as the dominant reserve currency?
After all, the U.S. enjoys the “exorbitant privilege”,19 which, for our purposes here (and
following [Gourinchas and Rey, 2007]), refers to the excess return of the U.S. external assets on
the U.S. external liabilities. Thus, according to [Gourinchas, Rey and Govillot, 2017], this excess
return was about 2.6%/yr during 1952, Q1 to 1972, Q4, and 2.4%/yr from 1973, Q1 to 2016, Q1.
However, this exorbitant privilege also has a flipside: the “exorbitant duty”.20 In a nutshell, the
U.S. provides insurance to the rest of the world (ROW) in exchange for having the (exorbitant)
privilege of paying low interest rates on its safe dollar-denominated assets. So, the exorbitant
privilege is not a free lunch but an insurance (risk) premium. In times of global crisis, the U.S.
dollar appreciates (owing to a flight to safety), which results in a massive wealth transfer from
the U.S. to the ROW.21 Superfluously this may appear innocuous as on average the exorbitant
privilege translates into a positive return. However, the U.S. debt increases in the process as
the valuations of the U.S. Treasuries do not collapse [Gourinchas, Rey and Govillot, 2017].
Another aspect is the volatility. The portfolio is not well-diversified: it is long the U.S.
and short the ROW (or the other way around, depending on the trade).22 Unsurprisingly, in
times of crisis the volatility goes through the roof.23 The ballooning U.S. debt does not help.
So, it is natural to wonder, is the exorbitant privilege really worth it? Does the U.S. really
want to bail out the ROW in times of crisis? The status of the U.S. dollar as the dominant
reserve currency also harms the competitiveness of the U.S. exports as its exchange rate is an
estimated 5-10% higher than it would otherwise be [Dobbs et al, 2009]. Would it not make
more sense to spread the burden during the global crises more evenly across the world as
19

For a nontechnical overview, see, e.g., [Bernanke, 2016].
See, e.g., [Gourinchas and Rey, 2007], [Gourinchas, Rey and Govillot, 2017], [Stavrakeva and Tang, 2018] and
references therein.
21
According to [Gourinchas, Rey and Govillot, 2017], such a wealth transfer between 2007, Q4 and 2009, Q1
amounted to about 19% of the U.S. GDP, or about 3% of GPD per quarter.
22
This is similar to the dollar carry trade (see, e.g., [Lustig, Roussanov and Verdelhan, 2014]), which is long (short)
the U.S. dollar (USD) and short (long) a diversified basket of foreign currencies (typically, with equal weights).
23
On 3/12/2020 the VIX closed at 75.47. On 11/20/2008 the VIX closed at 80.86 (while the intraday high on
10/24/2008 was 89.53). (Source: https://finance.yahoo.com.)

opposed to shouldering it alone while the ROW gets bailed out – in fact, gets paid – for (in
many cases) causing such crises in the first instance? The latest coronavirus outbreak and the
turmoil that it has caused the financial markets was certainly not caused by the U.S. In this
regard, iCurrency would be beneficial, not harmful, to the U.S. The stability of iCurrency24
would have to be maintained by the entire consortium, not by the U.S. alone. This latest crisis
caused by the coronavirus outbreak might be the high time for the U.S. to reevaluate its view
on the U.S. dollar as the dominant reserve currency, the exorbitant privilege and exorbitant
duty and shift toward a less volatile and more sustainable (at least in terms of its ever-growing
debt) regime where the ROW, many parts of which got extremely wealthy through wealth
transfers from the U.S., will take its fair share of responsibility for the stability of our global
economy. And the U.S.’s hegemony does not hinge on the U.S. dollar being the dominant
reserve currency, but on its stable economy, legal system, science and technology, innovation,
entrepreneurship, free speech, democracy, and many other things that make the U.S. what it is.
To summarize, a clear and transparent digital monetary system with a robust regulatory
oversight to preclude bad actors from abusing it and user data protection in place would be a
boon to our global economy. Our policy recommendations above aim at achieving this goal.
