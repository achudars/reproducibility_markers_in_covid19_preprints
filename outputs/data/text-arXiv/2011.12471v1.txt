Abstract. Excited state contributions represent a formidable challenge for hadron structure calculations
in lattice QCD. For physical systems that exhibit an exponential signal-to-noise problem they often hinder
the extraction of ground state matrix elements, introducing a major source of systematic error in lattice
calculations of such quantities. The development of methods to treat the contribution of excited states and
the current status of related lattice studies are reviewed with focus on nucleon structure calculations that
are notoriously affected by excited state contamination.

1 Introduction
The lattice formulation of Quantum Chromodynamics
(QCD) is the only known ab initio method to study the
properties of hadrons from first principles. Through the
development of more powerful computers and algorithms
over the last decades it has become possible to perform
precise lattice calculations for a broad range of applications. However, in order to make contact with experimental results from a controlled extrapolations of lattice results to the physical point, it is crucial to not only improve statistical precision but also to achieve control over
systematics. A lot of progress has been made regarding
chiral, continuum and finite size extrapolations which are
now part of many current lattice studies, as simulations
at physical quark mass and including multiple values of
the lattice spacing and volumes have become feasible in
the last few years. Still, in the presence of an exponential signal-to-noise problem, which is typical for observables involving baryons, a fourth systematic effect often
remains a challenge, i.e. residual excited state contamination. The reason for this is that the signal is lost in noise
at Euclidean time separations that are still insufficient to
gain ground state dominance. Therefore, isolation of the
ground state cannot be achieved in a direct way without
taking further measures.
Most notably affected by this kind of systematic effect are lattice QCD calculations of nucleon structure,
that cover a rich variety of observables. Among the most
basic such observables are nucleon charges that can be
computed from forward matrix elements at zero momentum transfer. An important example is the nucleon axu−d
ial charge gA
= 1.2724(23) [1] which is experimentally
measured in neutron β-decay and often serves as a benchmark observable for nucleon structure calculations in lattice QCD. On the other hand, there is less experimental

information available on scalar and tensor charges which
may give beyond the Standard Model (BSM) contribution
to the nucleon β-decay [2]. Therefore, control over excited
states is all the more important in lattice QCD calculations of these observables which may provide crucial input
on searches for BSM physics as they are relevant to dark
matter searches [3]. Furthermore, the tensor charge plays
a role in BSM searches for CP -violation as it controls the
contribution of quark electric dipole moments to the neutron electric dipole moment [4]. Another example for an
observable of great phenomenological interest at zero momentum transfer is the average quark momentum fraction
which contributes to the nucleon spin decomposition [5].
At non-vanishing momentum transfer various form factors
are studied, e.g. electromagnetic and axial form factors
and the corresponding radii that parametrize the slope
of these form factors at vanishing momentum. In particular, the proton radius has received a lot of attention in
the last decade due to the so-called proton radius puzzle, see e.g. refs. [6–12], although this has likely been resolved by now [13] and the most recent measurement from
electron-proton scattering [14] indeed agrees with the very
precise results obtained from measurements of the Lamb
shift measured for muonic hydrogen [8, 12]. Axial form factors in turn are experimentally less well-known [15–17] but
may provide critical input for future experiments related
to neutrino physics [18, 19], which makes them attractive
observables to be studied in lattice QCD.
The aim of this article is to review the state-of-theart of methods that are applied to tame residual excited
state contamination in modern nucleon structure calculations and to perform a critical assessment of the efficacy
of these methods. Therefore, further systematics related
to chiral, continuum and finite size extrapolations that
affect these calculations are not within the scope of this

review. From a physics point of view, a subset of nucleon
structure observables will be considered for which excited
state contamination is known to be an important, or even
dominant the systematic. The selection comprises observables that can be computed with sufficiently good statistical precision and for which dedicated studies of excited
state systematics and related methods can be found in the
literature.
The review is organized as follows: In the next section basic methods for nucleon structure calculations in
lattice QCD are summarized and observables relevant to
this review are defined. In sect. 3 theoretical aspects of
excited states and their expected effects on such calculations are discussed. The following sections are dedicated to
the review of various methods that have been employed in
the treatment of excited state contamination and their respective applications in recent lattice studies. More specifically, methods that aim at additional suppression of excited states by summation over the operator insertion are
reviewed in sect. 4, while sects. 5 and 6 deal with the
various application of multi-state fits and the variational
approach, respectively. In the end, a summary on the advantages and shortcomings of the individual methods and
a brief outlook on possible future developments is given.

contains all possible hadronic states with energies Ek (~

that share the same continuum quantum numbers compatible with the choice of the interpolating operator χ(~x, t).
This typically includes excitations of the ground state as
well as matching multi-particle states. The reason for this
is that the wave functions of the hadronic states |ki are
unknown and thus it is impossible to directly construct
interpolating operators that couple only to a desired state
k 0 while the remaining overlap factors h0| χ |ki for k 6= k 0
vanish exactly. Moreover, Lorentz symmetry is broken at
finite values of the lattice spacing which may lead to additional mixing between operators that would otherwise
fall into different irreducible representation in the continuum limit. Therefore, the extraction of the ground state
energies and overlap factors requires to compute C 2pt (p~~, t)

This motivates the definition of the effective energy

which is called effective mass for p~ = 0. For large values of
t it asymptotically approaches a plateau from which the
energy can be extracted. The parameter τ is commonly
set to τ /a = 1. In practice, the plateau can be identified
once the residual slope has become negligible compared to
the statistical error of the individual data points.
2.1 Nucleon matrix elements and ratio method
While hadron masses can be readily obtained from twopoint functions, the study of the structure of hadrons from
lattice QCD relies on the computation of matrix elements.
With respect to excited states a particularly relevant application are nucleon matrix elements (NMEs)
hN (pf , sf )| OµX1 ...µn |N (pi , si )i

The calculation of nucleon properties in lattice QCD is
based on the numerical evaluation of n-point functions in
discretized Euclidean spacetime. For the simple example
of a two-point function
C 2pt (~
p, t) =

at large Euclidean time separation t, such that all higher
terms are exponentially suppressed

= ū(pf , sf )WµX1 ...µn (Q2 )u(pi , si ) ,

(5)

where N (pi , si ), N (pf , sf ) denote nucleon fields with initial (final) state momentum pi (pf ) and spin si (sf ). On
the right hand side of u(pi , si ), ū(pf , sf ) are the corresponding Dirac spinors, while WµX1 ...µn (Q2 ) contains form
factors and kinematic factors. The form factor decomposition depends on the choice of the operator insertion that
we restrict to a bilinear operator of the form
OµX1 ...µn = q̄(x)ΓµX1 ...µn q(x).

(6)

where ΓµX1 ...µn collects Dirac matrices and possibly derivatives, and q(x), q̄(x) denote quark fields. Actual examples
of operator insertions relevant to nucleon structure calculations will be discussed in subsect. 2.3. In practice, most
lattice calculations are performed assuming exact isospin
symmetry in the light quark sector. In this case, the insertion of the isovector combination

leads to the cancellation of quark-disconnected diagrams
that are inherently more noisy then quark-connected contributions. For the isoscalar counterpart OµX,u+d
this can1 ...µn
cellation does not occur, which further increases the signalto-noise problem. Moreover, for studies of observables that
probe the contributions of strange and charm quarks to
nucleon structure such as e.g. strange and charm electromagnetic form factors, quark-disconnected diagrams give

the only contribution apart from possible mixing with
quark-connected contributions under renormalization.

2.2 Lattice techniques

The computation of NMEs from the ratio in eq. (13) requires three-point functions at several source-sink separations tsep to allow for a controlled study of excited state
effects. The de facto standard approach is to use sequential inversion through a fixed sink, which gives access to all
χα (~x, t) = abc (uTa (~x, t)Cγ5 db (~x, t))uc,α (~x, t) ,
(10) values of the insertion time tins for any given value of tsep .
where C is the charge conjugation matrix and u, d denote However, in this setup each source-sink separation needs
additional sequential inversions. Besides, the number of
up- and down quark fields that are usually smeared.
Assuming that the source time is zero, the two-point inversion per source-sink separation increases if non-local
operator insertions are used, e.g. for point-split currents

or the derivative operators in eqs. (28)–(30).

line. Similarly, the three-point function can be expressed an attractive choice for certain setups used for employing a dedicated variational analysis that will be discuss in
as

Most calculations of connected contributions use pointand Al (~

ratio of two- and three-point functions. A common choice fields q(x) to increase the ground state overlap, hence imis the ratio [20]

together with spatial APE smearing [29] of the gauge fields
that enter through the three-dimensional Laplacian ∆.
In general, the smearing parameter κG and the number
of smearing steps Nsmear need to be tuned to give optimal results. Besides, smearing can be used as a comparably cheap way to define additional interpolating operators which will be discussed in the context of variational techniques in sect. 6. For the fixed sink and fixed
insertion method the same point-to-all forward propagators can used for two- and three-point functions.
Since control over excited states depends on large sourcesink separations, methods to reduce the computational
cost are of particular importance for nucleon structure calculations as this requires high statistics. Commonly used
approaches for the sequential method are the truncated
solver method [30] or all-mode averaging (AMA) [31], that
allow to increase statistics at reduced cost compared to
performing only exact inversions. Further methods that
have been investigated include replacing the conventional
sequential propagators by a stochastic estimator [32–34]
which facilitates the reuse of the propagator at the expense
of introducing stochastic noise, the coherent sink method
[35,36] that allows to invert simultaneously on multiple,
temporally separated sequential sources, and finally distillation [37] which is suitable to systematically build a basis
of interpolating operators and that has been employed in
a recent study in ref. [38].
Furthermore, a lot of progress has been made in the
last few years regarding the inclusion of disconnected diagrams which has become feasible through the development
and application of variance reduction techniques such as
hierarchical probing [39], low-mode deflation [40], the oneend trick [41], the hopping parameter expansion [42, 43]
and combinations thereof [44, 45]. This lead to a substantial reduction in computational cost compared to e.g. using naive stochastic all-to-all estimators. However, the relative statistical error of quark-disconnected contributions
remains inherently larger than the one of purely quarkconnected diagrams even if gauge noise is reached.

There exists a large variety of nucleon structure related
observables that are computed in lattice QCD. However,
for the purpose of this review mainly a subset of observables will be considered for which uncontrolled excited
state contributions have been shown to produce a bias
at the current level of precision. As a first example, the
insertion of a local vector current
OµV (x) = q̄(x)γµ γ5 q(x) ,

(16)

or the corresponding point-split current gives rise to the
electromagnetic form factors F1 (Q2 ), F2 (Q2 ) through

F2 Q2 ) .
2NN

(17)

Usually, mean square radii hr2 i are defined from the expansion of a form factor in the Euclidean four-momentum

For example the electric and magnetic mean square charge
radii of the nucleon are given by

GM =F1 (Q2 ) + F2 (Q2 ) .

(20)
(21)

Note that for the neutron GnE (0) = F1n (Q2 ) = 0 and the
factor 1/F1n (0) is dropped from eq. (19) to obtain a finite
definition. Since radii are not explicitly momentum dependent they are more readily compared to other lattice
calculations than the full momentum dependence of the
form factors themselves. Moreover, radii can be directly
compared to experimental results as well.
Another set of observables for which excited state effects are particularly relevant are nucleon charges defined
at zero momentum transfer. However, for the vector current the electric charge GE (0) is conserved and the computation of the magnetic moment µM = GM (0) is hindered
by a momentum prefactor in the form factor decomposition which vanishes at Q2 = 0. The latter introduces additional systematic effects as the extraction of µM requires
either an extrapolation in Q2 or position space methods,
see e.g. refs. [48, 49]. The situation is different for NMEs
from other local bilinear operators, i.e. the axial, scalar
and tensor currents

Some example data for the ratio as a function of tsep for
the three charges are shown in the first three panels of

u−d
the experimentally well-known isovector axial charge gA
that is considered a benchmark quantity for lattice QCD,
although the statistical quality for the signal of a vector
current insertion is superior to any of the operators in
eqs. (22)–(24). Still, the axial charge has rather good signal quality compared to e.g. the scalar charge shown in the
upper right panel of fig. 1, which makes statistical errors
of order O(1%) achievable in modern lattice simulations.
Beyond charges also the axial and (induced) pseudoscalar
form factors GA (Q2 ) and GP (Q2 ) have very recently received attention with focus on excited states from both,
the theory [50–52] and the lattice side [53, 36, 54]. This will
be discussed in more detail in subsects. 3.2 and 5.2.
In addition to nucleon charges, the related form factors
at non-zero Q2 and radii, NMEs have been studied for

the symmetric derivative is defined as Dµ = 21 (Dµ − Dµ ).
Matrix elements of these operators occur for example in
the computation of the average quark momentum fraction of the nucleon hxiq , helicity and transversity moments
hxi∆q and hxiδq or for the generalized parton distribution
functions contributing in the computation of the spin decomposition of the proton, see e.g. refs. [55, 56]. The latter involves also a gluonic operator insertion. In principle,
any such NME may exhibit sizable excited state effects, as
will be discussed in the next section. A rather well-studied
example is the average quark momentum fraction of the
nucleon for which example data is shown in the lower right
panel of fig. 1 for the isovector combination. However, for
many of these observables a systematic treatment of excited states is more difficult due to the signal quality which
especially becomes an issue if quark-disconnected contributions are involved, see e.g. refs. [57–59]. It is for this
reason that methods to treat excited states are currently
of particular importance compared for simple observables

these quantities does not allow to conceal the systematic
effect of residual excited state contamination in final results.

3 Excited states
While excited states are present in essentially any lattice
calculation, they become especially an issue in calculations
of nucleon structure. In the following the reasons for this
are discussed in more detail and some theoretical expectations from chiral perturbation theory (χPT) and modeling
excited states are reviewed.
3.1 The signal-to-noise problem
The primary cause why excited states are a persistent
issue in nucleon structure calculation is an exponential
signal-to-noise problem that prevents computation of npoint functions at large Euclidean time separations as required for e.g. obtaining a plateau in the effective mass
in eq. (4) or for the ratio method in eq. (14). For the nucleon this problem has been formulated a long time ago
[60,61] from a field theoretical computation of the vari2
ance σstat
(t) of the nucleon two-point function, showing
that the dominating contribution at large values of t is a
three pion state, i.e.
2
σstat
(t) ∼ e−3Mπ t .

(31)

For the signal-to-noise behavior of a nucleon two-point
function this implies
3
C 2pt (~0, t)
∼ e−(MN − 2 Mπ )t ,
∆C 2pt (~0, t)

(32)

unlike the pion, for which a constant signal-to-noise ratio
is expected. An example is shown in fig. 2 for the effective mass of the nucleon and the pion computed on an
ensemble at physical quark mass. Clearly, the signal for
the nucleon is lost between 1.5 fm and 2 fm, while for the
pion at rest the ratio Mπ (t)/∆Mπ (t) remains constant as
expected.
Regarding the behavior of excited states and the signalto-noise problem in the ratio method, it is instructive to
consider the two-state truncation for the zero-momentum
case (initial and final state at rest) of the ratio in eq. (25)
RX (tins , tsep ) =A00 + A01 e−∆tins + A10 e−∆(tsep −tins )
+ A11 e−∆tsep + ... ,

where momentum arguments as well as Dirac indices have
been suppressed and ∆ = E1 − E0 denotes the energy
gap between the first excited state and the ground state.

M (t)/∆M (t) of a pion and a nucleon two-point correlator computed on 250 configurations of a CLS ensemble (E250) with
physical quark mass (T × L3 = 192a × (96a)3 , a = 0.06426 fm).

eqs. (11,12) have been collected in the Akl factors. In particular, the first term A00 is proportional to the ground
state matrix element, e.g. the nucleon charges gS,A,T if the
generic operator OµX1 ,...,µn in eq. (25) is chosen appropriately and A01 = A10 holds for the zero-momentum case.
Using the midpoint of the ratio as an estimate at any given
source-sink separation, the leading excited state contamination σesc is therefore expected to scale as
σexcited ∼ e−∆tsep /2 .

(34)

Note that at non-zero momentum transfer the behavior
of the ratio midpoint is similar, however, the time dependence in eq. (33) is no longer symmetric if initial and final
state differ by momentum. Considering the forward scattering case and neglecting the N π interaction one may
assume at least for a qualitative analysis that the leading gap is close to 2Mπ , i.e. the scaling is approximately
∼ exp(−Mπ tsep ). In fig. 3 this behavior is plotted for several pion masses as a function of tsep and it is obvious that
the issue of residual excited states for the ratio method becomes more severe towards the physical quark masses. For
example, at a source-sink separation of 1.5 fm that is typically reached in NME lattice calculations, σesc is roughly
one order of magnitude larger at physical light quark mass
compared to the situation at Mπ = 400 MeV. Assuming
that the matrix element is of O(1) this implies corrections
of up to ∼ 40% for tsep = 1.5 fm at physical pion mass.
Therefore, it is doubtful if the values of tsep that can be
reached in lattice calculations are sufficiently large to ensure control over excited states in the ratio method particularly at small light quark mass. Furthermore, excitedstate effects can be strongly operator-dependent which is
also observed empirically in lattice calculations; see e.g.
fig. 1. Consequently, it cannot be concluded from observing ground state dominance for an observable in the ratio
method that similar values of tsep will be sufficient for a
different observable.

In the review in ref. [62] it has been further pointed out
that at physical quark mass and again assuming ∆ = 2Mπ
the exponent is approximately −13 which must be compared to the naive factor of −2 obtained when neglecting
the effects of excited states. It is in this sense that the presence of excited states strongly enhances the issue of the
signal-to-noise problem in lattice calculations of NMEs,
particularly when approaching physical quark mass.

i.e. it exponentially grows with tsep . Even at moderately
heavy quark mass the effect is sizable as shown in fig. 4
for a selection of zero-momentum NMEs measured with
fixed statistics at several values of tsep . In fact, going from
tsep = 1 fm to tsep = 1.5 fm the signal-to-noise ratio becomes roughly four times smaller. This means that any
desired reduction in residual excited state contamination
by increasing tsep competes with the statistical precision
of the final result. Moreover, lowering the light quark mass
increases both σstat and σesc individually. If one demands
that the statistical error σstat and the systematic uncertainty σesc scale in the same way, i.e. σesc = const · σstat ≡
σ, the required statistics N for a target uncertainty σ can

3.2 Multi-particle states and theory predictions
A further complication arises from the particular excited
state pattern expected in nucleon structure calculations,
i.e. a dense spectrum of multi-particle states in addition
to resonances, which limits the efficacy of a variational
treatment or fits. In finite volume only discrete momenta
p~ = 2π
n with ~n = (n1 , n2 , n3 )T and integer ni are allowed
L~
and any combination of a single nucleon with an arbitrary number of pions that is compatible with symmetries
and momentum conservation will occur in the spectrum.
Increasing the (spatial) box size L while keeping the remaining physics parameter fixed, will reduce the size of a
momentum unit 2π/L, thus leading to a denser spectrum.
Neglecting the interactions between the nucleon and the
pions, an approximation of the multi-particle spectrum
can be obtained that is shown in the left panel of fig. 5
for physical pion mass. Up until Mπ L = 4 the lowest lying
excited state is a N ππ state, which justifies the previously
made assumption of ∆ = 2Mπ for the lowest gap. Note
that at heavier pion mass this remains true for even larger
values of Mπ L. Moreover, corrections to the lower, noninteracting N π levels are rather small as can be seen in
the right panel of fig. 5. The results shown in this figure
have been obtained in ref. [63] using the χPT in infinite
volume together with the Lellouch-Lüscher formalism. For
higher N π states E & 1400 MeV deviations become more
apparent, although the general pattern is not affected.
At heavier-than-physical quark mass the spectrum of
multi-particle states is thinned out while keeping Mπ L
fixed. Therefore, systematics related to excited states are
again expected to become more severe at lighter quark
masses. This is demonstrated in fig. 6, where the ratio
MN (t)/MN of the effective mass and the fitted ground
state value is shown for four ensembles with quark masses
covering a range from ∼ 135 MeV up to 350 MeV. At small
values of t a clear hierarchy is observed before the signal
becomes to noisy, i.e. a plateau is approached more rapidly
at heavier quark masses.
In the last few years there have been several studies
[64–69, 50–52] carried out using χPT to predict effects of
excited states in nucleon structure calculations. While recent lattice calculations are performed near or at physical
quark mass which already removes a major systematic effect, other restrictions with respect to the applicability

Fig. 6. Examples for the ground state convergence in the nucleon effective masses. The relative excited state contamination in the nucleon effective mass MN (t) defined as the ratio of
MN (t) and its fitted (asymptotic) value MN is shown as a function of t computed on four CLS ensembles (E250, D200, N200,
N203) at a common value of the lattice spacing a = 0.06426 fm.
The pion masses on these ensembles cover a range of roughly

of χPT results to lattice data remain. This concerns e.g.
the size of the available source-sink separations in case of
three-point functions. Regarding the use of smeared interpolating operators it has been pointed out in ref. [66] that
they are mapped onto the point-like nucleon field in the effective theory, provided that the smearing radius is small
compared to the Compton wavelength of the pion. The
resulting effective operators containing the pion-nucleon

(37)

then only differ by the value of a low energy constant
(LEC) α̃ for different smearings. Furthermore, at leading
order this LEC is canceled in ratios, hence χPT predictions for excited state corrections are independent of the
actual choice of smearing at leading order. At the very
least, these studies provide qualitative insight into the behavior of excited state contamination, but in more recent
work χPT predictions have also been used to systematically remove excited state contamination from lattice
data; see e.g. ref. [50].
Excited states in nucleon two-point functions have been
studied in refs. [64–66, 69]. For the nucleon effective mass
it was found that the excited state correction due to N π
contributions are expected to be below 2% at t ≥ 0.5 fm
and to become a sub-percent effect for t ≥ 1 fm. This is
roughly consistent with empirical findings in lattice studies e.g. considering the behavior of the (total) relative excited state contribution in fig. 6 as a function of t. In the
most recent ref. [69] the study has been extended to threeparticle (N ππ) states which where found to contribute at
most at the permille level and thus considered to be negligible for all practical purposes in the foreseeable future.
For three-point functions and the resulting matrix elements the situation is more complicated. In the past, the
main focus has been on N π contributions in the threepoint function with an axial vector insertion relevant for

4.1 Summation method
In its commonly used version [76, 77] the summation is
performed at the level of the ratio in eq. (13) running
only over timeslices between source and sink, i.e. tins ∈
[tex , tsep − tex ] with some additional freedom of leaving out
further timeslices parameterized by tex

The leading excited state contamination related to the
gap ∆ is still present but more strongly suppressed compared to the excited state contamination at the midpoint
of the effective form factor in the ratio method that scales
with O(e−∆tsep /2 ). It should be noted, that only at zeromomentum transfer the gap ∆ is actually the same as in

the previous section this can hardly be achieved in the
presence of the nucleon signal to noise problem. While
it may be possible to explicitly remove specific excited
state contamination for certain matrix elements like e.g.
N π states in axial and pseudoscalar form factors, there is
no general way how this can be achieved using additional,
theoretical input only. Therefore, methods are needed that
improve the suppression of excited states using data from
the available source-sink separations and that are equally
applicable to a broad class of nucleon structure observables. A simple approach that satisfies this requirement is
the summation method that has been originally published
in Ref. [23]. It is based on summing the operator insertion
over tins , leaving tsep as the only time dependence.

eq. (33). However, the resulting suppression of the leading
excited state contamination is always of O(e−∆tsep ), where
∆ is the smallest gap to the ground state, see also refs. [78,
79]. Figure 11 shows an example for the improved suppression of excited states compared to the ratio method
for hxiu−d . While the midpoint of the effective form factor
approaches the result from the summation method, the errors overlap only at the largest source-sink separation of
tsep = 1.54 fm and the central value from the ratio method
is still larger.
Key advantages of the summation method are that it
is trivial to implement, does not introduce model dependence or additional parameters (apart from the choice of
tex ) and that it is often possible to reuse data generated
for other methods e.g. the ratio method or multi-state
fits. Therefore, it has seen very widespread use in lattice
calculations, often for crosschecking results obtained from

12

Konstantin Ottnad: Excited states in nucleon structure calculations

other methods, but also for obtaining final results. On
the other hand, the summation method tends to produce
larger statistical errors in the matrix element of interest
compared to the ratio method; cf. fig. 11. Besides, the
excited state suppression in the summation method still
depends on the values of tsep used. In actual lattice calculations the results is often dominated by the smallest
source-sink separations that enter the linear fit because
the effective statistics rapidly deteriorates with increasing
tsep if the number of measurements is kept constant independent of tsep . Since a similar issue arises with other
methods, it may be desirable to spend extra computational effort to keep effective statistics constant, i.e. scale
the number of measurements at different source-sink separations so as to achieve (approximately) constant statistical error. This has been done in some recent lattice studies,
see e.g. refs. [44, 80]. Note that even for the ratio method
it is not sufficient to check convergence in the presence
of exponential error growth by inspecting the behavior of
the observable as a function of tsep because the signal is
typically lost before the asymptotic value is reached.

4.2 Feynmann-Hellmann inspired approach
Another realization of the summation over the operator insertion that appeared in the original paper for the summation method [23] has been revisited and used a few times in
the last years [81, 48, 82, 24, 25]. Most recently it has been
employed in a dedicated calculation of the axial charge
u−d
[26,83], leading to a precise estimate of gA
= 1.271(13)
in agreement with the experimental result. The method is
inspired by the Feynman-Hellmann theorem that relates
the energy shift due to a perturbation in the action

i.e. a sequential propagator that is summed over the insertion time. Note that unlike in the previously discussed
version of the summation method, here the summation
over the operator insertion time is performed over the entire lattice, which is also the result originally derived in
ref. [23].
An advantage of this approach over the sequential method
is that it requires only the computation of two-point functions which depend on the source-sink separation t = tsep
but not on the insertion time. Therefore, it does not require new inversions for each value of tsep , and the computation of the usual sequential propagators for three-point
functions is treated for the computation of the sequential
propagator in eq. (45). This mitigates some of the signalto-noise problem when performing a dedicated calculation
for a single observable. However, it allows only to compute
results for a single operator insertion and a single momentum transfer at a time, which changes the cost comparison
in favor of the standard method when computing multiple observables or especially for computing form factors
at non-zero Q2 .

In fig. 12 a comparison of results for gA
is shown
for the Feynmann-Hellmann inspired approach (left panel)
used in ref. [26] and the sequential method (right panel)
from an analysis in ref. [86] on a common ensemble, but
using a different action in the valence sector. In both cases
the final result has been obtained from a two-state fit to
the data; see also sect. 5. While the results are compatible,
the statistical error in the left panel is smaller by roughly
a factor of two. In refs. [26, 83] it has been argued that
a key advantage of the Feynmann-Hellmann inspired approach is that the leading
excited state contamination is

not just of O e−∆tsep as for the commonly used version
of the summation method but that it is further suppressed
by the difference between contributions separated by τ as
given in eq. (44). This is used to justify the inclusion of
data at much smaller values of tsep in these fits than for
the sequential method, which causes the final statistical errors to be smaller. In fact, the fit in the left panel of fig. 12

the analysis and the resulting error estimate for gA

regarding the central value of gA

where the superscripts i and f indicate the dependence
of the overlap factors and energies on the initial and final

all the overlap factors, matrix elements and energies in this

by the fit. Correlated fits are performed to the lattice data

depending on a set of fit parameters X1 , ..., Xn that are
to be determined by the fit. Although it is possible to
perform a direct, simultaneous fit to the model given by
eqs. (46) and (47) in its most general form, see e.g. the
nucleon form factor calculations in refs. [89, 73], in practice it can be difficult to obtain reliable results in this
way considering the finite statistical precision of lattice
data. The reason for this are the fairly large number of
parameters even in case of the two-state truncation and
possibly the size of the covariance matrix. This is particularly true at non-zero momentum transfer because the
number of independent fit parameter is larger than for
the zero-momentum case while the signal quality deteriorates with increasing Q2 . Therefore, additional assumptions and knowledge about parameters are often used to
stabilize fits.
A common way to increase stability of the fit are assumptions on the energy gaps between the first excited
state and the ground state. A rather basic ansatz has
been explored several years ago by the Mainz group for
a calculation of isovector electromagnetic form factors in
ref. [79]. Instead of fitting two- and three-point functions
separately, the corresponding two-state truncations have
been used to parametrize the leading excited state contribution to the effective form factors obtained from the
ratio eq. (13) as

(2)

+ cE,M (Q2 )e−2Mπ (tsep −tins ) . (49)
In this expression the energy gaps have been fixed to Mπ
and 2Mπ assuming that multi-particle states are responsible for the leading excited state contamination while neglecting nucleon-pion interactions. The choice of Mπ for
the first gap is motivated by the initial state nucleon having momentum p~i allowing for a corresponding N π state
with a moving nucleon and a pion at rest. On the other
hand the final state nucleon is produced at rest, i.e. p~f = ~0
which implies that the lowest state for the second gap is
a N ππ state with two pions in an S-wave, motivating the
choice of 2Mπ for this gap. While this approach helps to
stabilize the fit to lattice data, it comes at the price of
introducing additional model dependence.
In a more recent study of nucleon charges and moments of twist-2 operators in ref. [47] similar fits to ratio
data have been carried out, which amounts to fitting the
expression in eq. (33). Although the number of fit parameters is reduced for the analysis of data at Q2 = 0,

this alone turned out insufficient to yield stable results
when fitting the data for a single observable. The same
problem has been observed in another calculation of nucleon charges in ref. [90] that used single observable fits
to the two-state truncated ratio among other methods.
In order to remedy this issue, simultaneous fits to all six
u−d
observables, i.e. gA,S,T
, hxiu−d , hxi∆u−∆d and hxiδu−δd
have been introduced in ref. [47]. This exploits correlations
in the data which was found to further stabilize the fits
and improve statistical precision without the need resorting to further assumptions or priors. However, one must
keep in mind that the covariance matrix entering eq. (48)
can become a limiting factor for such simultaneous fits,
as it may be poorly estimated for the available number
of independent measurements if too many observables (or
timelices) are included. Still, for the two-state truncation
fitting several observables was sufficient to track the convergence of the gap as a function of the lower value of the
fit range [tfit , tsep /2] on plateau data symmetric around
tins = tsep /a. Results from this procedure are shown in
fig. 13 on an ensemble with a pion mass of Mπ = 200 MeV.
In the left panel the last term in eq. (33) has been neglected and clear convergence towards the expected gap
of ∆ ≈ 2Mπ is observed for Mπ tfit & 0.4. Unlike approaches that use information from e.g. fitting the twopoint function to fix the gap in the fit of the ratio or twoand three-point functions, this gives additional confidence
that the fit model is applied in a regime for which ground
state dominance is reached and higher states beyond the
leading contamination become sufficiently suppressed.
The right panel of fig. 13 shows results for ∆ from a
fit including the excited-to-excited state contribution in
the last term of eq. (33). This leads to significantly larger
errors on ∆ and to larger values of ∆ itself although at
least the trend towards 2Mπ remains visible1 . The primary reason for this is again related to the signal-to-noise
problem, i.e. the additional parameter A11 in the fit is
rather poorly constrained by the lattice data due to the
exponential error growth with tsep and the limited number of different tsep values that can be included in the fit.
Similar to what has been discussed before for the linear
fits in the summation method that tend to be dominated
by data at the smallest values of tsep , the situation could
be improved by increasing the number of measurement for
every step in tsep such that the effective statistics remains
approximately constant across the available values of tsep .
At any rate, going beyond zero-momentum transfer with
this method without additional assumptions would remain
difficult due to the increasing number of parameters and
less precise data.
A different approach that employs a two-state truncation on the summation method [91] has been explored in
refs. [90] to complement the usual ratio and summation
methods as well as the aforementioned (single observable)
two-state fits to the ratio. The method corresponds to an
extension of the usual summation method by supplementing the linear behavior of the summed ratio in tsep as
1

Note that the matrix elements of interest and their errors
are less affected than ∆ by the additional term in the fit.

charge as a function of the minimal source-sink separation entering the fit are shown in fig. 14. Regarding the

central value there is no dependence observed on the minimal value of tsep within the rapidly growing error. This
kind of fit is similar to the ones performed in the deteru−d
mination of gA
using the Feynman-Hellmann inspired
approach as discussed in subsect. 4.2, i.e. from a purely
technical point of view the two calculations mainly differ in how the summation over the operator insertion has
been implemented for the data entering the fit. However,
the gauge ensembles used and most likely the resulting
computational cost are very different, which makes a conclusive comparison impossible, even if one were to ignore
the fact that in the sequential method multiple observables
and momenta are computed simultaneously. It is interesting to note though that in both studies similarly small
statistical errors are obtained for including data starting
from tsep & 0.3 fm. Still, the preferred value quoted in
ref. [90] from this method has been chosen such that only
data with tsep & 0.58 fm have been included due to concerns regarding the statistical quality of the fit including
data at smaller values of tsep . In a comprehensive study
of results obtained from different methods, this lead to
a less favorable statistical signal quality for this method
compared to other approaches. Since the gap ∆ in eq. (50)
is independent of the observable it might be worth investigating if a simultaneous fit across multiple observables
helps to improve stability and statistical precision of the
fit as it was found for fits to the ratio in ref. [47].
Instead of explicitly fixing an energy gap using model
assumptions, or leaving it entirely as a free parameter as in
the previously discussed approaches used in calculations
of NMEs at zero-momentum transfer, it is possible to use
information on energies from a separate analysis of the
nucleon two-point function. This arguably leads to milder
model dependence than e.g. the explicit choice ∆ = 2Mπ
made in ref. [79] while still enabling two-state fits of NMEs
at non-zero momentum transfer. A very recent account of
this kind of approach is found in an analysis of the decomposition of the proton spin and momentum fraction
by the Extended Twisted Mass Collaboration (ETMC)
in ref. [56]. In their favored approach the final state is
always produced at rest p~f = 0 and the fit is split up in

rather good precision the values from the dispersion relation at higher momenta are much more precise than actual

several values of tsep . The fit ansatz is given by plugging
eqs. (46) and (47) in eq. (13) using the already known
values of the remaining fit parameters to remove them
from the final fit. Note that in another variation of this
method used in e.g. a calculation of electromagnetic form
factors in ref [44] the final fit as been applied directly to
the three-point function instead of the ratio. This is in
principle equivalent, but the ratio may be preferred as it
is usually shown in figures instead of the actual three-point
functions.

largest value of tlow

the two methods may only converge at even larger values
of tsep . Since neither the fit range in tins has been varied nor the resulting energy gaps are given in ref. [56] it
is difficult to judge if the fit is performed in the regime
where contamination due to higher states are in fact already negligible, or a larger result as favored by the summation method and indicated by the trend in both methods would be more trustworthy. At any rate, the example
highlights the importance of carefully crosschecking results from multi-state fits with other methods, apart from
only demanding a good fit quality.

Ideally, also the energy gaps should be compared against
theoretical expectations. In particular, the gap determined
by the fit should converge towards the lowest gap in the
spectrum for sufficiently large Euclidean time separations
of the data in the fit. While corresponding results for the
fitted gaps are rarely included in the literature, results

a function of (valence) Mπ . The filled and open symbols refer to
the ground state energy E0 and the energy of the first excited

“case 1” and “case 4” which differ by the number of timeslices
included when fitting two- and three-point functions as defined

high precision solves and the full AMA results, only the result
with full statistics has been included.

the energy E1 of the first excited state lie systematically
above the non-interacting N ππ energies. This is in line
with what has been reported in ref. [90] for the leading
gap obtained from a two-state fit to the two-point function on two ensembles at physical quark mass. Note that
depending on the box size a N π state might have even
lower energy, however, for typical lattices the energies are
usually close to each other. The authors of ref. [86] also
performed some variations with respect to the fit ranges,
i.e. the fit labeled “case 4” starts at larger values of t
and tins for the two- and three-point functions, respectively. While this tends to increase the statistical errors
as expected, there is only a minor shift (if any) towards
smaller values of E1 observed. Therefore, it must be considered doubtful whether such two-state fits correctly describe the contribution from the excited states that need
to be subtracted to identify the ground state.

5.2 Including additional states
All of the fits discussed in the previous subsection share
as a common feature that they only take into account
the contribution of the lowest excited state as they are
based on the two-state truncation in eqs. (46) and (47).
In principle, this can be extended by including further
states in the truncation. This is the approach favored by
the PNDME collaboration which they have used in several
recent NME calculations, e.g. for isovector nucleon charges
in ref. [92, 88], moments of of twist-2 operator insertion in
ref. [93], as well as electromagnetic and axial form factors
in refs. [94, 72, 54].

In order to stabilize these fits beyond the two-state truncation a (sequential) empirical Bayesian analysis with Gaussian priors [95, 96] is carried out for the masses Ek≥1 and
amplitudes Ak≥1 as described in ref. [72]. Although the
results for Ek>1 and amplitudes Ak>1 remain sensitive on
both the priors and the lower bound tmin in the fit, the
four-state truncation is found to describe the data sufficiently well as can be seen in fig. 17 for four ensembles
covering several values of the pion mass and two lattice
spacings. However, as discussed in ref. [88] the resulting
energy gaps E1 (~0) − E0 (~0) at zero-momentum transfer are
again found to be mostly incompatible with the theoretical
expectation of E1 − E0 ≈ 2Mπ as it has been the case for
the two-state truncation. This observation corroborates
the conclusion that fits to a single two-point function are
unable to fully resolve the excited state spectrum. Note
that this behavior differs from what has been found in the
previously mentioned simultaneous, direct fits to the ratio
introduced in ref. [47] for which convergence towards 2Mπ
is in fact observed. Therefore, while using masses and amplitudes obtained from the four-state truncation of the two
point function in the fits of the three-point function can
yield an effective description of the data, this procedure
should not be expected to allow for a systematic elimination of the contribution from the lowest excited states.

Konstantin Ottnad: Excited states in nucleon structure calculations

For the truncation of the three-point function several
ansätze have been used in recent calculations by PNDME
that are referred to as 2∗ -, 2- and 3∗ -fits. In their naming
scheme, the 2∗ -fits include only the ground state contribution ∼ h0, p~f | OµX1 ...µn |0, p~i i and the 0 → 1 transition
matrix elements, while the 2-fit includes the full two-state
truncation. Furthermore, the 3∗ fits incorporate all terms
involving the 1 → 2 and 0 → 2 transition matrix elements.
In a recent calculation of electromagnetic form factors and
radii in ref. [94] final results are mostly obtained from the
3∗ fits, however, in other cases these fits turn out unstable and the results from the two-state fit are preferred, see
e.g. ref. [88]. In fact, any matrix elements beyond the ones
in the 2∗ -fits are found to be poorly constrained by these
fits.
Including further states in the truncations of two- and
three-point functions does still not guarantee the efficacy
of multi-state fits for removal of excited states, which remains dependent on the observable, the available statistical precision and a careful choice of fit ranges and priors. In
particular, for observables requiring non-zero momentum
u−d
transfer like rE,M
and µu−d
N , the excited state contamina2
tion is Q -dependent For example, the result for the nuu−d
cleon electric radius rE
= 0.769(27)(30) fm in ref. [94]
was found to be 16% smaller than the experimental value.
This may be explained by the fact that the excited state
2
2
correction in Gu−d
E (Q ) increases with Q and its convergence is from above. If the multi-state fit does not sufficiently remove these effects for data at larger Q2 that
enter the extraction of the radius, this may lead to an unu−d
derestimation of the radius. On the other hand for µM
the excited state contamination is large at small values of
Q2 and convergence is from below, which likely explains
the low result of µu−d
= 3.939(86)(138) if the multi-state
N
fits fails to fully remove the contamination.
Anyhow, the underestimation of electromagnetic radii
and the magnetic moment is a common feature of several recent lattice calculations, see e.g. refs. [89, 44, 80, 94],
and it is difficult to judge if deviations from experimental
results are dominated by residual excited state contamination alone. For example, for the electric form factor also
finite size corrections are expected to be Q2 -dependent
and can thus be difficult to disentangle from excited state
effects. Two studies by the PACS collaboration in refs. [70,
97] give a hint that finite size corrections may indeed play
a role, as their results obtained on two fairly large physical
volumes (Mπ L ≈ 6 and Mπ L ≈ 7.2) are in better agreement with experimental results, albeit with larger errors.
However, the fine momentum resolution on these lattices
might as well help to reduce residual exited state contamination for the extraction of the nucleon radius. Moreover,
final results for rE,M and µM may exhibit further dependence on the method used to extract them from lattice
data, see e.g. ref. [49], the available lattice momenta and
the chiral, continuum and finite size extrapolations.
Another interesting application of this kind of fit ansatz
is found in the recent study of axial form factors in ref. [54]
that has already been mentioned in subsect. 3.2. In this
case the conventional multi-state fit strategy that uses in-

formation on the energy gaps from the two-point function,
labeled by S2pt in the notation of ref. [54], fails badly to
achieve ground state dominance. The reason for this is
that the four-state fit applied to the two-point function
does not resolve N π states which are responsible for a
large excited state contamination in the pseudoscalar form
factor as discussed at the end of subsect. 3.2. In ref. [54]
an alternative fit strategy labeled SA4 has been adopted
that uses information on this additional, low-lying energy
gaps through a fit to the three-point function from an insertion of the temporal component of the axial vector current. The result for the relevant energy gaps obtained from
both procedures as a function of the momentum transfer
in integer units are shown in fig. 18 together with the
noninteracting estimates for N π states with back-to-back
momentum and with the nucleon at rest. The noninteracting estimates agree rather well with the behavior of the
energy gaps extracted using strategy SA4 . Using the fit
strategy SA4 the lattice data for rPCAC and rPPD defined
in eqs. (38) (39), respectively, are found to be compatible
with unity as shown in the left panel of fig. 10.
A conceptually different approach that aims at modeling N π state contributions in a many-state fit has been
u−d
investigated in ref. [90] for the extraction of gA,S,T
. It relies on using the noninteracting energies for the first N π

assuming that all ground-to-excited state transitions enter with the same coefficient and that off-diagonal transitions between different excited states are negligible, while
excited state contamination in the two-point function is
considered important. In fig. 19 results from this procedure are shown for the unrenormalized axial charge. For
small values of the lower bound τ0 in the insertion time
a strong dependence on the choice of nmax is observed
as expected in the presence of a tower of N π states contributing to the signal. With increasing values of τ0 the
values appear to converge across different nmax and the
result is found to be consistent with other methods albeit
with larger errors. However, in ref. [90] it has been concluded that the strong dependence on n2max in modeling
the excited states at small τ0 likely make the approach
unreliable.

6 Variational techniques
A conceptually different approach to tame excited state
contamination is the variational method [98, 99], which has

(55)

for t > t0 and k ∈ [0, ..., N − 1]. Energy levels are obtained at large t from the principal correlators λk (t, t0 ) ∼
e−Ek (~p)t , while the eigenvectors ~vk (t, t0 ) carry information
on matrix elements. Note that solving the GEVP generally results in an unsorted set {sk (t, t0 )|k ∈ [1, ..., N ]} of
states sk (t, t0 ) = (λk (t, t0 ), ~vk (t, t0 )) on each timeslice and
performing the state assignment going from timeslice t to
t + 1 can be a non-trivial task particularly in the presence
of an exponentially deteriorating signal-to-noise ratio; for
a discussion of methods to sort the states see ref. [101]. The
most important feature of the variational approach is that
ground state energies and matrix elements are improved
with respect to the leading excited state contamination
which now depends on the gap EN (~
p) − E0 (~
p) to the N th state in the spectrum [100] instead of the smallest gap
in the spectral decomposition of a single two-point function E1 (~
p)−E0 (~
p). Therefore, contamination from excited
states is more strongly suppressed which can be systematically improved by adding more (independent) interpolating operators to the basis χ
~.
Beyond spectroscopy the variational approach can be
applied in calculations of hadronic matrix elements [81].
In this case the generalized eigenvectors that diagonalize
the two-point correlation function matrix are used to construct optimized interpolating operators

for the k-th state, that are used in the computation of optimized three-point functions. For nucleon structure calculation an issue arises again from the dense spectrum of
multiparticle states, particularly towards physical quark
masses and in large volumes. In principle, each state to
be removed in the variational approach requires an additional operator, which may require a very large basis.
Furthermore, it is known from spectroscopy calculations
[102] using distillation [37] that multiparticle operators
must be included to systematically resolve multiparticle
states, which for NME calculations is also supported by
chiral perturbation theory [66]; see the discussion in subsect. 3.2. However, these are numerically expensive to implement for the computation of nucleon three-point functions. In fact, there has so far only been a single, published
study [38] using distillation in the context of NME calculations2 , which will be discussed in some more detail in
2
A second study in ref. [103] extending the work in ref. [38]
by combining momentum smearing with distillation appeared
while writing this review.

R(τ,t)

Since building a basis that systematically accounts for
the lowest-lying excited states has not been attempted for
NME calculations due to the computational cost induced
by the need for multiparticle operators, all existing NME
studies using the variational method have aimed at constructing an improved interpolator from a basis of computationally affordable interpolators. A straightforward way
is to use differently smeared operators, which has been
explored in refs. [104–106]. However, it remains an open
question if this approach is actually beneficial compared
to the sequential method using a single interpolator with
properly tuned smearing in combination with other methods for controlling excited states, e.g. two-state fits or the
summation method. This concerns the resulting suppression of excited states as well as the computational cost
required to achieve a given target precision.
u−d
Figure 20 illustrates the first part of this issue for gA
:
the choice of smearing steps Nsmear has a large impact
on the resulting excited state suppression for the single
interpolator approach and careful tuning of the smearing
for is required for a meaningful comparison, because too
small a value of Nsmear leads to enhanced excited state
contamination. Although the excited state contamination
appears to be slightly more reduced for the variational
method in this example from ref. [105], it is close to the
one from the single interpolator approach for the largest
value of Nsmear and a further increase of Nsmear might
have resulted in a compatible value.
While in refs. [107, 105] some indication has been presented that the variational method is more robust with
respect to excited state contamination than the two-state
fit and summation method, this has been challenged by
the study in ref. [106]. In this study it has been concluded
that the efficacy of the variational method and a two-state
fit applied to the single interpolator approach for reducing excited state contamination is similar. In particular,
it has been stressed that the comparison to the two-state
method in refs. [107, 105] did not use the optimal smearing
size and that the resulting statistical errors might be artificially large due to the choice of the values of tsep in the fit.
Furthermore, it has been pointed out in ref. [106] that the
computational cost depends on the setup and that lighter
quark masses and larger temporal lattice sizes T work in
favor of a (properly tuned) two-state fit approach. At any
rate, it appears fair to conclude that no clear advantage of
the variational method using a basis of smeared interpolators over other commonly used methods has been found
in existing studies.

where all further indices and parameters besides the timedependence have been suppressed. The matrix of eigenvectors obtained from the GEVP applied to C2pt (t) is then
used to diagonalize the three-point function matrix
C3pt (tins , tsep ) → ~v T C3pt (tf , t, ti )~v
= diag(Λ0 (tins , tsep ), ..., ΛN (tins , tsep )) .

(60)

The principal correlator Λ0 (tins , tsep ) for the ground state
can be treated in the same way as the standard threepoint functions in a subsequent analysis, e.g. the ratio
method. Anyhow, NME calculations are just a particular
application of the GPOF method and it can in fact be
applied to any problem in hadron spectroscopy and structure calculations whenever a variational basis is desired.
Further details on GPOF based approaches and the relation between several families of methods, i.e. the GEVP
and GPOF, the Prony method [112–115] and the Gardner
method [116] have recently been discussed in ref. [101],
where also a new combination of GEVP and GPOF has
been proposed.
In practice, the signal-to-noise problem and availability of different values of tsep limits the application of the
GPOF in NME calculations to a single additional interpolator and thus a 2 × 2 correlation function matrix. Figure 21 shows corresponding results from a 2 × 2 GPOF
with δt = 2a for the nucleon effective mass on an ensemble
at physical quark mass. The excited state contamination
is found to be drastically reduced in the GPOF principal
correlator at small values of t/a. However, the point errors
for the GPOF ground state are larger than from the single. As pointed out in ref. [110] this behavior is expected,
because for a system with exactly two-states with energies E0,1 the two- and three-point ground state principal
correlators read
λ0 (t) = C 2pt (t+2δt)−2e−E1 δt C 2pt (t+δt)+e−2E1 δt C 2pt (t) ,

and

respectively, implying that the statistical uncertainties are
dominated by the correlators at the largest value of tsep .
This strongly limits the statistical precision for the threepoint case due to the signal-to-noise problem, at least if
effective statistics are not kept constant for increasing values of tsep . Still, for the nucleon mass this effect is compensated by the much earlier onset of the plateau at ∼ 0.4 fm.
Furthermore it has been pointed out in ref. [110], that
the GPOF might not be efficient for contamination from
transition matrix elements. This is because they are more
strongly suppressed in the two-point function than the
corresponding contributions to the three-point functions
by transition to the ground state. However, within the
statistical precision of that study it has been concluded
that GPOF and summation method lead to comparable
results. This has also been confirmed by a more recent
study in ref. [111] of moments of twist-2 operator insertions, which are notorious for large excited state contamination. In the context of NME calculations the main advantage of the GPOF is clearly its simple implementation
compared to e.g. multi-state fits and that it can usually
be applied on existing data without adding computational
cost. However, despite its simplicity the method has not
seen widespread use in recent NME calculations. Still it
might be worthwhile exploring the GPOF approach for
NME calculations further, particularly if the required data
are readily available from other methods such that it can
e.g. serve as a crosscheck.

6.3 Hybrid interpolators
The search for an affordable basis of interpolators has
recently been extended to so-called hybrid interpolators
that include an insertion of a chromomagnetic field Bi =
− 21 ijk Fjk and that can be implemented at similar computational cost compared as the standard approach. In
ref. [117] the following basis of operators has been studied


χ1 =abc ũTa Cγ5 P+ d˜b ũc ,
(63)

˜ b γi γj ũc ,

where ũ, d˜ are smeared quark fields, Pij = δij − γi γj /3,
and χ1 is the standard interpolator in eq. (10) up to an additional (positive) parity projector P+ = (1 + γ0 )/2. Two
tuning runs have been performed to optimize the smearing
for χ1 and construct a variationally improved interpolator
χopt for the ground state as introduced in eq. (56). Some
results for the nucleon effective mass from ref. [117] are
shown in fig. 22. The variational basis is found to lead to
a reduction of excited state contamination compared to
the standard approach, albeit less than the reduction that
is usually observed in the previously discussed GPOF approach. Furthermore, these results once more demonstrate

the importance of tuning the smearing for optimal results
and a meaningful comparison to other methods.
However, for the actual NME calculation the results
found in ref. [117] were mixed, as can be seen from the
u−d
results for gA,T
in fig. 23. While the excited state contamination is significantly reduced for gTu−d using the variationally improved interpolator χopt , it is actually increased
u−d
for gA
. The latter result might be explained by a partial (accidental) cancellation of excited states present in
the single interpolator approach, which is weakened or prevented in the variational approach. Besides, the statistical
errors for χopt are always larger than for χ1 . These findings corroborate the conclusion that a small variational
basis without multi-particle operators does not allow for
a systematic treatment of excited states in nucleon structure calculations.
Similar results have been found previously in ref. [38].
In addition to a standard, Jacobi smeared [118] interpo+
lating field and a single distilled operator 2 SS 12 that resembles the nucleon interpolator in eq. (63), two bases
of distilled operators B3 , B7 have been constructed using
covariant derivatives to obtain variationally improved interpolators denoted by P̂3 and P̂7 , respectively. Basis B3
+
includes 2 SS 21 and two hybrid interpolators which have
been found to have large ground state overlap in ref. [119],
while basis B7 expands B3 by four additional operators
that probe the radial structure of the nucleon. Note that
B3 is similar to the basis used in ref. [117] to obtain the
u−d
variationally improved interpolator. Some results for gA
+
are shown in the three panels of fig. 24 for 2 SS 12 and the
variationally improved interpolators from bases B3 and
u−d
B7 , respectively. For gA
the variationally optimized interpolator P̂3 shows enhanced excited state contamination
compared to the single interpolator approach, similar to
what is observed in ref. [117]. A second observation is that
further increasing the basis indeed improves the situation
as one should expect. Again, for gTu−d (not shown here) the
excited state contamination has been found to be reduced

by including hybrid interpolators when compared to the
single interpolator approach. It should be further noted
that the standard, smeared interpolator has been found
+
to give results qualitatively consistent with using 2 SS 21
as expected, albeit with much larger errors. However, it is
not clear if the smearing has been tuned in ref. [117]. Besides, it is not possible to directly compare computational
cost in a meaningful way to distillation. Still, the findings
of the two studies in refs. [38, 117] using hybrid interpolators qualitatively agree in that a small variational basis
without multiparticle operators is insufficient to reliably
deal with excited state contamination in NME calculations
across multiple observables.
6.4 Parity-expanded variational analysis (PEVA)
Yet another way to build a variational basis has been developed and applied in a series of papers [120–122] for
studies of baryons at non-zero momentum. Originally introduced in ref. [120] at the level of nucleon two-point
functions, the method aims at resolving parity mixing between nucleon states at non-zero momentum, hence its
name “parity-expanded variational analysis”. Unlike other
approaches that attempt to find a generally applicable
variational basis to construct improved operators, the PEVA
approach is designed to specifically deal with potential
contamination caused by this mixing with states of opposite parity.
The basic idea of this method is to start from a basis of
conventional interpolators denoted by {χi } and construct
an extended basis
χi,±~p = Γ±~p χi ,
χ0i,±~p

= Γ±~p γ5 χi ,

(66)
(67)

using a helicity projector
Γ±~p =

1
(1 + γ0 ) (1 ± iγ5 γk p̂k ) .

(68)

At zero-momentum the two operators transform as eigenstates of parity, i.e. χi,±~p → +χi,±~p and χ0i,±~p → −χ0i,±~p ,
respectively, while at non-zero momentum they do not
have definite parity. The authors of refs. [120–122] always
consider an initial basis made up two interpolators

χ1 = abc ũTa C d˜b ũc ,

with four different levels of Gaussian smearing to generate
˜ effectively resulting in an
the smeared quark fields ũ, d,
8 × 8 basis for the conventional variational approach and
a 16 × 16 basis for the PEVA.
In ref. [121] the method has been applied to the calculation of electromagnetic form factors while the most
recent study using the PEVA approach in ref. [122] extends this further to (elastic) form factors of the first two
parity-odd excitations of the nucleon and its lowest-lying

results from ref. [121]. In this study the PEVA method
has been first applied for GE (Q2 ) for which no significant difference to results from the conventional approach
has been observed. However, for the magnetic form factor
PEVA was found to lead to additional reduction of the excited state contamination. This is shown in fig. 25 where

for finite volume effects using chiral perturbation theory

netic form factor particularly at lighter pion masses, the
authors of ref. [121] give some possible explanation for
this feature from an investigation of the negative-parity
spectrum, i.e. they infer an increasing role of multiparticle states in the negative-parity spectrum at lighter pion
mass. They further speculate that this could lead to a
change in the coupling to the localized operators they
use and thus affect the opposite-parity contamination in
the ground state matrix element. However, if this explanation is correct, it is not a priori clear that the PEVA
method would still yield a significant correction at light
pion masses once multiparticle operators are actually included and it might in fact be more relevant for studies of
parity-odd states as in the exploratory study in ref. [122].

fects due to the chiral extrapolation can be considered
well under control. Furthermore, discretization effects are
empirically found to be rather small and continuum extrapolations are now part of state-of-the-art calculations
as well. The later also applies to some extent to finite size
extrapolations, although in this case the picture may be
less clear. On the other hand, excited states remain arguably as the most important source of systematic uncertainty in current lattice simulations. One reason for this

is that they are strongly observable-dependent and can
be large, which in practice makes it difficult to come up
with a generally applicable approach to treat them. Moreover, excited state contamination is intimately related to
the signal-to-noise problem, which is why there is usually a trade-off between statistical precision and accuracy
related to this systematic. This is problematic as it can
easily lead to an underestimation of the overall error.
In this review an overview of approaches to mitigate
excited state contamination in contemporary lattice QCD
calculations of nucleon structure has been presented. These
methods can be roughly divided in three categories, i.e.
summed operator insertions, multi-state fits and applications of the variational method. While direct, quantitative
comparisons of different methods taking into account the
computational cost are rarely found in the literature and
often difficult or even impossible to perform, each of these
methods has its individual advantages and shortcomings
that can be summarized as follows:
1. Methods based on the summation over the operator insertion aim at increased suppression of excited states.
At least in the commonly used form this approach is
simple to implement, rather robust and less affected
by human bias than e.g. multi-state fits, because there
are not many tunable parameters involved. However,
statistical errors are typically larger than for (naive)
fits which might explain why the summation method
has often been merely used as a crosscheck for other
methods. Moreover, there is no a priori guarantee that
the additional suppression of excited states is indeed
sufficient for a given observable and target precision.
2. Multi-state fits have become rather sophisticated over
the last years and are by now predominantly used to
obtain final results. They aim at explicitly correcting
lattice data for the leading excited state contamination. Their main advantages are flexibility with respect to the choice of fit ansatz and – in principle –
the possibility of tracking convergence of the resulting
energy gaps. In practice, most implementations use information from the two-point functions to determine
energy gaps and make heavy use of priors if more than
two states are included, making them more prone to
human bias. Moreover, fits naively relying on information on energies from two-point function should be
considered unreliable as the fitted energy gaps notoriously fail to converge to the theoretically expected
lowest-lying state and it has been shown that these
fits may indeed miss the lowest-lying (multiparticle)
states which can lead to large residual excited state
contamination as observed for e.g. axial form factors.
3. The variational method is potentially the most powerful approach as it allows to systematically extract
states and suppress excited state contamination in a
given matrix element. However, in current implementations the efficacy of the method remains limited and
strongly observable-dependent as only fairly small bases
of operators have been used and multiparticle operators have not been included at all. The last point causes

Konstantin Ottnad: Excited states in nucleon structure calculations

an issue similar to the one for multi-state fits using information on energy gaps from two-point functions, i.e.
a small basis particularly without multiparticle may
simply miss certain low-lying excited states. Still, such
states can yield significant residual contamination depending on the matrix element.
Since no approach is clearly favorable across multiple observables, it remains crucial to crosscheck whatever
method is used to obtain final results and perform a careful assessment of the residual excited state contamination.
In particular, it is insufficient to claim agreement between
two methods if one of them has much larger errors while
the result with the smaller statistical error is quoted as the
final estimate. Ideally, one should study correlated differences and assign a systematic error due to residual excited
state contamination. If multi-state fits are used on a sufficient number of ensembles, non-parametric criteria may be
used to further test the plausibility of results. Additional
care is required when using methods that are likely to be
affected by human bias due to a large number of free parameters or that make model assumptions, such as using
the spectrum from the two-point functions to determine
energy gaps of the three-point function.
One way to systematically improve over existing analyses of excited states would be the inclusion of multiparticle operators in a variational analysis. This should
yield a more reliable resolution of the spectrum and thus
lead to a more comprehensive and observable independent removal of excited state contamination provided that
a large enough basis is used. However, such an extension would still be be demanding from a computational
as well as technical point of view. Another possibility for
future improvement would be a solution or mitigation of
the exponential signal-to-noise problem itself. This might
be achieved by using multilevel methods as introduced in
refs. [124, 125] which have recently been further explored
in the context of the hadronic vacuum polarization contribution to g − 2 [126].
