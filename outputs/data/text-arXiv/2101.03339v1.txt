Abstract
This paper presents an analysis of the publication of datasets collected via Google Dataset Search,
specialized in families of RNA viruses, whose terminology was obtained from the National Cancer
Institute (NCI) thesaurus developed by the US Department of Health and Human Services. The
objective is to determine the scope and reuse capacity of the available data, determine the number
of datasets and their free access, the proportion in reusable download formats, the main providers,
their publication chronology, and to verify their scientific provenance. On the other hand, we also
define possible relationships between the publication of datasets and the main pandemics that have
occurred during the last 10 years. The results obtained highlight that only 52% of the datasets are
related to scientific research, while an even smaller fraction (15%) are reusable. There is also an
upward trend in the publication of datasets, especially related to the impact of the main epidemics,
as clearly confirmed for the Ebola virus, Zika, SARS-CoV, H1N1, H1N5, and especially the SARS-CoV-2
coronavirus. Finally, it is observed that the search engine has not yet implemented adequate methods
for filtering and monitoring the datasets. These results reveal some of the difficulties facing open
science in the dataset field.

Introduction

The consultation of data sets and articles, located in the repositories, has become a common practice
and a central role in the investigation of people or work groups (Marcial; Hemminger, 2010) for making
well-founded decisions (Hernández- Pérez, 2016). For example, the mean annual size of the data set
in the Miccai articles (Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention) has grown
approximately 3 to 10 times between 2011 and 2018 (Landau; Kiryati, 2019), which comes to confirm
this approach and reveals the paradigm shift towards an open science.
And that is why every day there is greater awareness of the need to share data and materials derived
from scientific research to reproduce analyzes, compare them and pose new questions, (Nosek et al.,
2015) although it is true that certain concerns are produced subject to the confidentiality, governance,
possible misuse of institutional and business data (Howe et al., 2018). Despite the fact that the
disadvantages are less than the benefits, according to a survey answered by 800 researchers, which
concluded that less than 8% considered the possible negative consequences of data exchange (Mello;
Lieou; Goodman, 2018).
The latest open data works (Corrales-Garay; Ortiz-de-Urbina-Criado; Mora-Valentín, 2019) show a
more than probable increase in its use, due to:
change of behavior in scientific research, which is now also based on massive data analysis or big-data
(Saheb; Izadi, 2019); control of data protection laws (Polonetsky; Tene; Finch, 2016); increased
transparency (Weston et al., 2019); Requirements of funding agencies, which require supporting
scientific conclusions on proven and recognizable data in shared datasets.
This can be verified in the Plan S of the European Commission (Science Europe, 2019) which urges,
from January 1, 2021, the publication in golden open access journals or in repositories and "related
platforms" that publish Editorial PDF, being also a great opportunity for magazines to carry out a full
digital transformation (López-Borrull et al., 2020).
Recently, open access scientific preprints are becoming a fundamental source of information to face
transcendental issues, such as the health crisis produced by SARS-CoV-2 (Johansson; Saderi, 2020), in
which researchers from all over the world are uniting their efforts, knowledge and databases to
identification of infected patients through the symptoms of fever and its incidence pattern (Haleem
et al., 2020);
-space-time prediction of the speed and magnitude of virus transmission (Zhou et al., 2020);
simulation of protein folding for targeted therapies (Chen et al., 2020); predicting the progress of
Covid-19 disease through radiological images (Chen; Lerman; Ferrara, 2020); to obtain effective
treatments and vaccines (Le-Guillou, 2020).
The purpose of this work is the analysis of the results obtained in the Google dataset search engine,
in reference to virus families, being necessary to answer the following questions:
Is Google Dataset Search an open data search engine, suitable for research?
What is the ratio of open and reusable datasets for preset virus queries?
Which RNA viruses have the greatest number of research datasets?
What is the evolution of the datasets depending on the virus?
Is there a correlation between the chronology of the epidemics and the publication of datasets and
scientific articles?
What documentary difficulties are found in open scientific datasets?
How can the obtained datasets be reused?

2

It will be observed that the research questions are oriented in a double aspect of InformationDocumentation and correlative of viruses.
This is so because the number of datasets and their evolution is related, among other issues, to viral
diseases, as explained in the research.
The search engine Google Dataset Search is a query utility specialized in data sets, which collects
information from scientific, commercial and governmental repositories of a very diverse nature, as
will be explained later. The range of this tool is not comparable with other search engines and
aggregators, not even with the data providers that it covers in a single corpus.
In addition, Google collects datasets for its search engine that comply with the schema.org metadata
standard (Brickley; Burgess; Noy, 2019), more specifically that referring to datasets, as explained in its
approach to dataset discovery (Google, 2020). This has allowed the creation of a massive compilation
instrument that undoubtedly facilitates scientific research. However, it also raises questions about its
suitability, as will be explained later. This search engine entered service on September 5, 2018, but
was not definitively open until January 2020, at which time it has coincided with the Coronavirus crisis,
so it will be able to demonstrate its versatility, advantages and shortcomings, in a situation of urgency
and necessity. In this research, additionally, an attempt will be made to observe the limitations of the
search engine, as well as the correctness of the information presented, its possibilities for reuse and
relevance, carrying out specialized searches in virology.

2. Methodology
The methodology used in this work is aimed at preparing a sample of queries from a controlled
vocabulary, which allows the Google Dataset Search to be interrogated. This method is commonly
used in search engine evaluation works (Lewandowski, 2015), in order to observe the relevance and
pertinence of the results, apart from other evaluation methods (Hawking et al., 2001). For this, the
selection of a vocabulary sample is required, from a documentary language, that is, a controlled and
normalized vocabulary, in order to ensure the repeatability and reproducibility of the tests on the
search engine, according to (Broder, 2002). This is also representative of the TREC consultation and
evaluation methodology (Hawking et al., 1999). Each word or noun phrase chosen serves to compose
a query, for which a query formula is designed whose complexity will vary depending on the purpose
of the evaluation. In this investigation, as will be explained later, no complex equations are required,
just searching for literal terms in the search variable by default. This allows creating a search url that
can be executed manually or automatically, in order to collect the results that the search engine
returns. In this research, the following are observed: the quantitative values of the total number of
results of the query; the proportion of the results according to the type of access and format; the
publication and registration chronology of the datasets; the number of scientific articles linked to the
retrieved datasets; the provenance of the data sets (these are the main data providers); the proportion
of reusable datasets for research and documentation tasks; the relevance of the results according to
each query raised (that is, the adaptation of the results to the term of the vocabulary used) or what is
the same, the analysis of the content offered by the search engine for each query (King et al., 2007).

For the selection of terminology specialized in virus families, the thesaurus of the NCI
(National Cancer Institute) has been chosen, which is used extensively by the American NIH
(National Institute of Health). Next, the section of the thesaurus has been selected, which
contains the terminological references of Viruses (Code C14283), which include DNA viruses,
retroviruses, RNA viruses and other groups of viruses. For this research, RNA viruses have been
chosen because they are found among them, those related to the Coronaviridae family, which
have caused the international health alert in 2020. In this way, the number of datasets
recovered from SARS- can also be quantitatively compared. CoV-2, with respect to the rest of
viruses of the same classification. In sum, a total of 22 families of RNA-type viruses and a total
of 70 terms have been obtained, which can be verified in Table 1.

Configuration and execution of queries in Google Dataset Search. Two types of queries have
been considered. First, searches for virus families, which will be codenamed Q1 queries, and
secondly, searches for virus species, which will be called Q2 queries. The main data providers,
dataset formats, their reuse, type of access and the chronology of their publication will be
obtained for each species of virus. It is relevant to specify that a result given by the search
engine can assume one or more datasets, since they can often be found in different export
formats. In this work, the number of datasets has been specifically considered, to obtain
greater precision in the figures provided. The query mode is based on the direct use of the
thesaurus descriptors, to which literal search quotes are added, for example “Porcine
Epidemic Diarrhea Virus”, in order to obtain the most relevant datasets for each virus in
question.
Analysis of results. The analysis process is intended to compare the data from queries Q1 and
Q2. These data will be compared with a Q2 sample, configured with the datasets of the first 5
results of each virus species, for prospective analysis. Possible quantitative and qualitative
differences will be observed, their frequency of publication, correlation with the main
epidemics and pandemics, evolution in the last 20 years and their comparison with the
publication of scientific articles. Additionally, the limitations and problems observed in Google
Dataset Search will be pointed out.

3. Results
The Q1 category queries, related to virus families, yield a total of 1,375 datasets, of which almost 87%
are open access. By filtering the results by specific formats, suitable for the reuse of information, that
is, the CSV (comma separated values) and XLS (Excel spreadsheet or similar) format, it is obtained that
only 58.59% can be used in databases and statistical analysis programs, since the remaining 41.41%
are in image formats, PDF or office type documents.
The results of the Q2 category show proportions similar to those already observed in Q1. 82% of the
results correspond to free access datasets and the remaining 18% to subscription datasets. On the
other hand, 64% is in usable formats and 36% in image or derived office formats. These preliminary
data confirm the rise of open science in this sector.
However, when examining the Q2 sample carefully, very different results are observed, which raise
serious doubts regarding the information that Google Dataset Search provides a priori. Of the 3,799
datasets obtained, those of the first 5 most relevant results for each virus species are analyzed in
depth, obtaining a sample of 331 datasets. From their scrutiny, it was concluded that only 67 datasets
are reusable, being available in standard CSV, XLS, SQL, XML formats. This means that only 21% of the
total is usable, which means a disagreement with the information given by the search engine in the
Q1 and Q2 queries.

Delving into the data obtained, in table 3 it is observed that the number of reusable datasets is reduced
to 15%, if the criterion of proven scientific provenance is added. That is, that at least the link between
the dataset and a scientific article is verified. It has also been discovered that 37% of the non-reusable
datasets had scientific origin, corresponding mostly to images, illustrations and scientific papers,
which means that they are not actually data sets. On the other hand, there is also a margin of 6% of
the datasets that, being reusable, did not have an accredited scientific origin, due to the lack of
attached research. Furthermore, 66% of the published datasets are concentrated in the last 5 years,
which indicates that the data update frequency may be low. To these figures, we must add the factor
of aggregation and heterogeneity of the data, since, in many similar datasets, the content object, its
structure and variables did not coincide, which means that they are not continuous in most cases.
Consequently, their aggregation and continuity factor are very low.

Figure 2 shows the absolute publication frequency of the data sets for each virus. The number of
published datasets does not show a linear progression until 2010, at which time there is constant and
sustained growth. In 2016, the largest number of data sets related to the virus test were recovered,
highlighting:
• Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis or Choriomeningitis virus, produced by rodents (29 results);
• Nipah virus endemic to the area of Malaysia and India (31 results);
• the Rhinovirus or common cold virus (25 results);
• the SARS Coronavirus or SARS-CoV (25 results).
Despite the decrease in the number of datasets published in 2017, with an index similar to 2014, a
return to growth has been observed to date, confirming an upward disposition. In fact, in the current
year 2020 the largest number of datasets associated with a virus is recorded. The Covid-19 associated
with SARS-CoV-2 presents 94 data sets in just 3 months, which exceeds any forecast.

At this stage of the research, it is worth asking if there is a cause-effect relationship between the main
episodes of epidemics and pandemics that have transpired in the scientific literature and the media,
in reference to datasets. To answer this question, Figure 3 has been prepared, in which the most wellknown epidemics and pandemics are superimposed on the timeline with respect to the publication
dates of data sets registered in Google Dataset Search. The results obtained indicate that there is
always a delay in the publication of datasets with respect to the dates on which the outbreaks or
epidemics are supposed, the most notable case being the SARS-CoV that took place between 2002
and 2004. Yes Well, the first dataset on SARS-CoV is recorded the year after the end of the epidemic,
the quantitative values are almost inconsequential until 2012, when most of the data are published,
a total of 36 datasets.

It is observed that in 2016 there was an increase in the number of datasets referring to the study of
viruses, specifically:
• Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis or Choriomeningitis virus produced by rodents (29 results);
• Nipah virus endemic to the area of Malaysia and India (31 results);
• the Rhinovirus or common cold virus (25 results);
• the SARS Coronavirus or SARS-CoV (25 results).
It is shown that 2016 is one of the most productive in terms of data sets. However, the maximum value
is recorded by Covid-19 associated with SARS-CoV-2, which in just three months of 2020 has recorded
a total of 94 datasets. Although as indicated above, only 52% of the data is scientific and to a lesser
extent, only 15% reusable, it can be said that the severity of the Coronavirus crisis has caused a rapid
response from the scientific community that it has had an eloquent reflection in the statistics,
although the degree of coordination, aggregation and grouping of the data according to the various
producing subjects cannot yet be confirmed.
This pattern is repeated in most cases, for example, in the avian influenza epidemic caused by H5N1
between 2003 and 2006 and influenza A or H1N1, between 2009 and 2010. In both cases, the
published dataset figures remain below 10 until 2016, when the largest increase in the historical series
occurs. Another notable case is the Ebola epidemic, which occurred between 2014 and 2016, of which
datasets published before and during the outbreak were observed. This can easily be explained, since
the Ebola virus has been known since 1976 (Emond et al., 1977), since at least seven outbreaks have
been recorded. This factor, together with the high mortality and morbidity, have been able to
influence the interest of the scientific community. In fact, there is an increase in the number of jobs
and the number of published datasets, which reaches its maximum in 2019.
Another similar case is that of the Zika virus. Although datasets have been found since 2012, the Zika
epidemic will not take place until 2015 and 2016, when the epidemic outbreak reaches South, Central
America and part of the Caribbean. Like Ebola, Zika has been known in advance, since 1947 (Dick;
Kitchen; Haddow, 1952), which explains the existence of datasets prior to the last epidemic. However,
a growth of datasets has been observed since then, which has its maximum values between 2019 and
2020. If the results obtained for the datasets are compared with the published scientific articles, it is
observed that their publication frequency is higher and they overlap with the dates of incidence of
pandemics (Figure 4). This phenomenon is clearly justified as it is the preferred means of scientific
communication and helps to put the publication of articles and datasets into context, both in volume
and periodicity, although its comparative ratio is extremely low.

Never before has this level of concern been reached, reflected in scientific publications and datasets,
which demonstrates the degree of attention of the scientific community to the essential difficulties
that affect society as a whole. Other aspects to highlight are the appearance of datasets on SARS-CoV2, just at the beginning of the Coronavirus crisis in December 2019, as well as the quantitative leap
produced in such a short space of time.
The results obtained suggest several reflections on the factors that affect the production of specialized
virology datasets, among which the following could be highlighted:
• Severity of the pandemic. It follows that, the more affected and dangerous a virus, the greater
the number of published datasets, linked to research and scientific articles. This is confirmed
with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, by showing that the rate of publication of datasets per article is
the highest compared to the rest of the viruses analyzed.
• Transparency of investigations. A notable percentage of research datasets are not freely
accessible, making it difficult to independently verify the scientific facts from which scientific
publications are derived (Irwin, 2009). The principles of reproducibility and repeatability are
compromised by the interests of the companies that finance research and data mining
(Bekelman; MPhil; Gross, 2003).
• Difficulties inherent to the investigation and the integrity of the data. This factor could explain
the time lag between a pandemic and the publication of the dataset, as has been described.
This may be due to the difficulty in devising adequate scientific methods and trials, validated
by the scientific community, the shortcomings in the automation and data collection
processes, or the lengthy process of verification and curation of these, typical of this area of
research. knowledge (Schneier, 2012).
Finally, to specify the scope of the analyzed information, the providers that collaborate with Google
are reviewed, where certain limitations are observed. One of the most relevant is the lack of official
figures on its coverage. Therefore, the information on providers analyzed corresponds to the first 100
results that the search engine retrieves, based on the sample of Q1 virus families, Q2 virus species and
Q2 sample.
From here it can be stated that the coverage of the datasets and files recovered on RNA viruses varies
depending on the provider. Not all data providers provide usable datasets to Google, as indicated;
some data providers even show office files, which are of no use to form knowledge bases for big-data.
However, from the search engine, no distinction or qualitative assessment is made in this regard.
As shown in table 4, two data providers stand out above the rest: Figshare and Researchgate.
Regarding the general search for virus families (Q1), both have more than 70% coverage and the
specific searches for each family (Q2) are close to 60%. The rest of the analyzed providers (Statista,
Omicsdi, Datamed, Search.datacite, etc.) have very low coverage, individually below 4%, but globally
they accumulate slightly less than 30% in Q1 and 40% in Q2, approximately.

As mentioned in the analysis of the results, 37% of the scientific datasets are not reusable or
accessible. This is also due in part to the fact that providers such as Researchgate and Statista in many
cases limit the data displayed, requiring registration, subscription or prior payment, for full access.
This type of practice is far from the concept of open and collaborative science, opening up the
reflection on the transfer of dataset rights in the main data providers and repositories.
Another relevant issue is the adequacy of the Schema.org metadata to the description of the datasets.
It has been observed that Google Dataset Search collects your information from different data
providers. It should be noted that the Schema.org metadata is a very versatile format, since it adopts
the main description matters for this type of document. For example, the dataset's membership
relationship to other data collections, summary, authorship and its affiliation, citations, comments,
access conditions, edition status, creation and update dates, editions, encoding, resource link,
distribution, spatial and temporal coverage, among others. Although it is a very complete model, if
the description of each section is taken care of, there are two fundamental aspects, which have not
yet been adequately addressed:
• the control of the versions of the datasets, in order to track the changes produced and
facilitate their recovery. In this sense, the Schema.org metadata should include a tuple in
which the dates of the dataset versions are associated with their link to the original file and
the statement of responsibility, similar to the operation already known in software
repositories such as Github ( Blischak; Davenport; Wilson, 2016);
• the lack of a definition of the dataset's data structures, which makes it difficult to unify
datasets with similar purposes and themes. That is, the introduction of a field that defines, as
a comma-separated list of values, the field header of the dataset in question. This makes it
easy to quickly identify and compare the collection of datasets, to discover which ones can be
grouped together to generate large collections of data. Therefore, it also simplifies the
automation of correspondence mapping, between different dataset fields, for their merging,
if necessary.
The normalization of metadata seeks to guarantee consistency in the format of the datasets retrieved
by Google Dataset Search and to be able to offer users a meaningful and unified search experience
(Canino, 2019). For example, that the updates of the epidemiological situation of Covid-19, are not
broken down into provinces and update dates, but can be studied in a single dataset that integrates
them all, maintaining the identification of their origin, date and version. This type of case is frequent
among search engine results.
Regarding the reuse of datasets, it can be said that their dissemination and use is its main purpose,
since in most cases it involves the registration of scientific tests, experiments and observations. This
gives the dataset the value of scientific evidence on which the conclusions and results of many
scientific papers are based. The nature of this type of document makes it a valuable resource or source
of information, as long as its correct identification and aggregation is possible. In this task, there is
data and text mining, and specifically scraping techniques (Singhal; Srivastava, 2013), which make the
automatic extraction of datasets possible, from different data providers, or, as This is the case of a
specialized search engine. This allows you to focus your search on a specific topic or issue, to obtain

11

the most relevant datasets and process them in one or more tables of a database. Obviously, there is
not yet a fully automated method by which all fields in a dataset can be automatically mapped or
mapped. Hence the importance of having an adequate metadata system, which makes up for this
problem, as has been explained.
Subsequently, the information from the datasets can be enriched by other sources of information, to
compose a more complete collection with which to obtain a new scientific analysis, in what has been
called the scientific data curation process (Karasti; Baker; Halkola, 2006). The variety of datasets
around an object of study, as well as their volume, favor their reuse in big data analysis. This is so
because the purpose is the correlation of data sets from various sources. For example, the relationship
between the compounds of the drugs used in the treatment of Covid-19 and the evolution of the
patients, the medical records and their hematological tests (Wang; Ng; Brook, 2020). They constitute
differentiated data sets that are indexed, grouped and related, to infer a cause and effect relationship
or a Pareto cumulative probability distribution that facilitates the patient's diagnosis (Ahlawat; Chug;
Singh, 2019). This implies the multidimensional storage of the data sets (Elmeiligy; ElDesouky;
Elghamrawy, 2020), where each dimension is an analysis factor, which is decomposed for its
identification and classification in nodes, also called pairs sets, to be correlated. with other nodes from
other datasets. This is possible thanks to Map-reduce techniques, capable of quantifying the frequency
of appearance of the elements of each node, resulting in a combined and ordered value that reflects
the weight of each relationship (Khashan et al., 2020). These types of results help to determine which
factors are decisive in the improvement or worsening of a disease, promoting the subsequent
development of machine learning models.
4. Conclusions
1. This work shows that not all the results displayed by the search engine are datasets. Although
there is confusion with the term, it must be emphasized that a dataset or dataset is that
collection of data structured and delimited in its values, so that it can be reused in databases,
spreadsheets, statistical analysis programs and big data. The dataset's own formats are CSV
separated by comma values, SQL because it constitutes the structured query language of
databases and derived from XML, because it allows the precision of values through labels and
extensible markup structures. In fact, according to (Qian; Bailey; Leckie, 2006) it is that
collection of objects or data, represented successively following a pattern or tabulation
scheme, which facilitates their instantiation and compilation.
2. The analysis shows that approximately 15% of the results are reusable datasets of proven
scientific provenance, which represents a reduced amount of the information available in the
search engine. Although open science is consolidating at the level of scientific articles
(Mckiernan et al., 2016), it is not doing so in the field of data sets. This conclusion may be due
to the lack of supervision, filtering and evaluation of the datasets, after indexing in the search
engine. According to Google, the information in the datasets is collected directly through the
Schema.org metadata. Perhaps this procedure does not trigger a true review of the type of
data, format, origin, quality and reliability of the same, resulting in an automatic registration
of the information. Clearly, Google's platform still needs to improve its data entry and
verification process if it is to become a reliable source of scientific data. Other aspects that
could be improved are the limitation of results to only a hundred per search, the lack of the
filtering system to correctly distinguish the download formats according to their extensions,

12

the scientific or commercial origin of the dataset, country or region of collection, language,
dates. of publication and update, officiality of the data, affiliation, origin, secondary producers
or collaborators, provider or data aggregator and filtering by date ranges.
3. Google Dataset Search is shown as a singular aggregator, which obtains information from
multiple data providers, among which there is a notable quantitative inequality, at least in the
results obtained for families of RNA viruses. The main data provider is Figshare. In the general
search for virus families (Q1), 54.96% of information was recovered, in the specific searches
for each family (Q2) 33.45% and in the specific sample of Q2, 51.55%. In contrast, other
providers such as Catalog.data.gov, Statista, Omicsdi, Datamed and Search.datacite, do not
exceed 9% in each of the three searches performed.
4. In order to increase the percentage of reusable datasets, Google should collect among its
selection criteria, screening or filtering the datasets whose formats are CSV, XLS, SQL and XML
and establish a clear differentiation between commercial, scientific, and article datasets
scientific and other products of scientific publications, such as figures, illustrations and
presentations. It has been found that there is a great difference between the data that the
search engine returns, compared to the real data. In fact, only 52% of the datasets are of
scientific origin, with 15% being really reusable. 37% of the results were badly cataloged,
considering datasets to the illustrations, figures and presentations of scientific publications.
5. The research seems to confirm challenges that still need to be overcome, both by data
providers and dataset finders. Specific: a) The standardization and improvement of the
metadata format for the exchange of datasets, so that the versions and additions of the
authors and institutions participating in the edition can be distinguished. b)The full-text
indexing of the datasets, including the list of fields, figures and registered character strings, so
that the retrieval does not depend exclusively on the description provided in the metadata.
c)Show the relationships between scientific articles and the datasets on which they are based,
in order to study their impact on scientific advances. d) Classify the datasets according to their
scientific discipline, applications, temporal and geographic coverage. e) Develop big data
techniques to detect patterns of similarity and correlation between datasets, in order to
facilitate the researcher in selecting the appropriate data sets.
6. Regarding the analysis of the results, a notable increase in the publication of virus datasets
has been observed since 2016, which temporarily coincides with the Ebola and Zika epidemics.
Among the RNA viruses with the most datasets, the Choriomeningitis virus, the Nipah virus,
the Rhinovirus, the SARS-CoV and recently SARS-CoV-2 stand out. In fact, they have exceeded
the dataset publication rate in a period of just 3 months. None of the analyzed viruses reached
these levels, which shows an evident reaction from the scientific community. Thus, it can be
stated that the mortality and morbidity of a virus in the population are factors that are
intrinsically related to the number of published datasets and papers. This is demonstrated by
comparing the chronologies of the main epidemics, being especially true in the case of H1N1,
Ebola, Zika and SARS-CoV-2. It can also be concluded that the severity of a pandemic,
transparency in research, as well as difficulties in collecting data and designing scientific
methods for the development of clinical trials, may be some of the causes of a low frequency

13

of dataset publication, especially if it is compared with other documentary types, such as
scientific papers. This imbalance is widened when the data set is expected to be open access
in its completion, being one more barrier that the open science scheme must overcome.

5. Future lines of research
This work demonstrates the importance of datasets in the context of Information and Documentation,
since they constitute a source of fundamental knowledge for scientific production. Data collections
are the primary documentary type that collects the observations of a scientific experiment, or its
indicators and evaluation factors. Therefore, in general, any research that addresses its better
knowledge, administration, recovery and processing, will facilitate the advancement and
dissemination of Science. It should not be forgotten that Documentation, as an auxiliary science,
requires an open knowledge, both of the information needs, and of the documentary types that are
demanded and used. Therefore, there is room for future related research, for example:
1. Analysis of DNA virus datasets and their comparison with the results of RNA viruses. By
replicating the same research method, DNA-type viruses can be taken as the basis of
consultation, in order to be compared with the results obtained in this research. In this way,
it would be possible to confirm whether this other type of virus has a different publication
rate, as well as its incidence in the publication of scientific articles, its dependence on external
factors such as epidemics or outbreaks, or the presence of differentiating elements with
respect to to another data set. The results obtained can provide the necessary experience for
the design of better search and aggregation applications for this type of data sets in the area
of knowledge of Virology.
2. Replication of the dataset research method in other knowledge or subject areas. The method
used is applicable to any topic. This is so, since the section of the thesaurus for consultation
can be varied, or it can be replaced by a controlled vocabulary, standardized and recognized
by the scientific community. This allows targeted queries, in accordance with official
terminology, in the dataset search engine and obtain comparable results. This type of study
would allow to know which areas of knowledge generate more data collections, for what
reasons, under what conditions, as well as their correlation with the main scientific
publications.
3. Study of the correlation between scientific publications, the use of datasets and their value. It
can be affirmed that scientific investigations supported by datasets, coming from
experimentation, observation and data collection, are in better conditions for the
demonstration and empirical justification, than those that do not enjoy said foundations.
Although this hypothesis is reasonable, it would be expected to be confirmed by analyzing a
sample of articles, based on scientific datasets and open access, in which their weight in
obtaining citations would be analyzed. That is, to determine the degree of influence that this
aspect supposes, for the success of a scientific article.
4. Design of a metadata format suitable for scientific datasets. Although the Schema.org
metadata format is the current reference, it seems logical to propose an improvement or
update of its fields, to adapt it to version control and the identification of the data structures
of the datasets, to favor their aggregation. This research would help to improve the retrieval
of this type of document in search engines such as Google Dataset Search, providing the
opportunity to simplify the researcher's task.
