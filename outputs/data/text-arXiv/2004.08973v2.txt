Abstract. In the absence of other tools, monitoring the effects of protective measures,
including social distancing and forecasting the outcome of outbreaks is of immense
interest. Real-time data is noisy and very often hampered by systematic errors
in reporting. Detailed epidemic models may contain a large number of empirical
parameters, which cannot be determined with sufficient accuracy. In this paper, we
show that the cumulative number of deaths can be regarded as a master variable,
and the parameters of the epidemic such as the basic reproduction number, the size
of the susceptible population, and the infection rate can be determined. In the SIR
model, we derive an explicit single variable differential equation for the evolution of
the cumulative number of fatalities. We show that the epidemic in Spain, Italy, and
Hubei Province, China follows this master equation closely. We discuss the relationship
with the logistic growth model, and we show that it is a good approximation when the
basic reproduction number is less than 2.3. This condition is valid for the outbreak in
Hubei, but not for the outbreaks in Spain, Italy, and New York. The difference is in
the shorter infectious period in China, probably due to the separation policy of the
infected. For more complex models, with more internal variables, such as the SEIR
model, the equations derived from the SIR model remain valid approximately, due to
the separation of timescales.

1. Introduction
In the absence of other tools, monitoring the effects of protective measures, including
social distancing, and forecasting the outcome of outbreaks is of immense interest[2, 3].
Real-time data is noisy and very often hampered by systematic errors in reporting.
Detailed epidemic models may contain a large number of empirical parameters[1], which
cannot be determined with sufficient accuracy. In this situation, low dimensional, effective
models of epidemic dynamics with the least number of variables and parameters are
needed for robust modeling and forecasting[6]. Such models naturally arise in statistical

mechanics, where the behavior of coupled micro-systems with many parameters and
variables, can be reduced to the dynamics of a few macroscopic variables on large scales.
In the current situation, disease control and prevention agencies publish macroscopic
data such as the number of cases, recovered, and deceased patients daily with a spatial
resolution of administrative districts containing millions of inhabitants. Ideally, the
model should be able to work on this level of resolution. Parameters of the disease the
spreading process is also hard to determine, and even the few essential parameters have
a wide range in the available literature.
In the absence of details, compartmental epidemic models describing the average
behavior of the system can be a starting point. Even the simplest models contain
several variables, which are hard to determine from the available data. The minimal
SIR model[4, 5] describes the behavior of the susceptible S(t), the infected I(t), and
the removed (recovered or deceased) R(t) populations. It contains three parameters.
Parameter β is the average number of contacts per person per time, multiplied by the
probability of disease transmission in contact between a susceptible and an infectious
subject, parameter γ is the number of recovered or dead during one day divided by the
total number of infected on that same day, and N is the size of the population.
In the present COVID-19 outbreaks, the number of cases is a very unreliable variable,
since it depends on the number of tests and the testing protocols, which are highly
variable both in time and in administrative districts. Similarly, the number of recovered
patients is dependent on the case definition, which in turn depends on the testing protocol
and frequency. The number of fatalities seems to be a better characteristic. Even if there
can be differences in various administrative districts, how the deaths are counted, we
can hope that it is done consistently, and the relative numbers are accurate even if the
total number can be debated. There is also some variability in this data, and sometimes
deaths appear in the statistics with a few days delay. Therefore, we would like to use
the aggregated data to reduce the variation coming from this.
In the next section, we show on the examples of the SIR and SEIR epidemic models[5]
that they can be reduced to the dynamics of a single variable, the cumulative number of
deaths.
2. The dynamics of cumulative deaths in the SIR model
The SIR model consists of three differential equations. The first one expresses the relation
between the number of removed (recovered or dead) and the number of infected as
dR(t)
= γI(t).
(1)
dt
It is assumed that the number of recovered and the number of deaths have a fixed ratio
D(t) = pR(t),

(2)

where p = pD /(1 − pD ) and pD is the probability of death, and D(t) is the cumulative
number of fatalities from the beginning of the outbreak. We would like to formulate our
epidemic equations in terms of this variable.

infected populations

d(τ
where we introduced the normalized deaths d(t) = D(t)/ND , ND = pN is the number of
deaths that would occur if the whole population would be infected and the dimensionless
time variable τ = γt. The parameter R0 = β/γ is the basic reproduction number of the
SIR model, and we introduced the dimensionless function f (R0 , d) = (1 − e−R0 d ) − d,
shown in Fig.1. This equation has already been derived in Ref.[4].
The most important aspect of this finding is that the cumulative number of deaths
is a single, robust and reliable master variable, and the evolution of the epidemic can
be visualized in the two-dimensional phase space (Ḋ(t), D(t)). Moreover, on a daily
resolution of Ḋ(t) = D(t) − D(t − 1) is the daily increment, which is the daily number
of fatalities. In the next section we

reproduction number parameters R0 . For large R0 the function gets close to its
asymptotic form f (d) = 1 − d.

3. Application of the model for the outbreaks in progress
To verify the model, we looked at the available data[8]. The function f (d) is singlehumped as one can see on Fig. 1. To get data points right from its peak, we have to look
at examples where the outbreak passed its peak (at the time of the writing on April 17,
2020). We have found only three cases where this already happened with great certainty:
China, Italy, and Spain. In these countries, a lockdown has been implemented, and the
disease can spread only in a small fraction of society, where infected people are locked
down with susceptible ones. The rest of society is not in contact with the epidemic.
The number of people affected is N , and if all of them get infected, ND = pN people
expected to die. The value of p is unknown. It is estimated[7] from the data of countries,
where there is extensive testing in places such as South Korea (p ≈ 0.02) and Iceland
(p ≈ 0.004). We expect to extract the parameters β, γ and the number of people in
danger of dying Dmax .
In Fig. 2, we show the daily number of fatalities as a function of cumulative
deaths for Spain, Italy, and New York. We also fit our model to the data and show
the parameters in Table 1. The parameters are very similar for all three cases. The
parameter 1/γ ≈ 17 days is in good agreement with the typical length of the disease
till recovery or death. The basic reproduction number R0 ≈ 5 is somewhat elevated,
but it is also realistic for people in close contact with the infected (for example, family
members and doctors) in the lockdown situation. According to the model, the lockdown
works as expected. We have to stress, that in absence of a complete lockdown and social
distancing, this outcome is not guaranteed and the epidemic can change its course when
social distancing is lifted.
Next, we look at the data from Hubei Province, China. Due to irregularities in
the reporting, we removed data points where zero case has been reported, and then the

an almost symmetric parabola, which is the mathematical consequence of the low basic
reproduction number R0 ≈ 2.1, as we show later. The parameter γ is also substantially
different from the values observed in Europe. Accordingly, the expected number of
fatalities is smaller there as well.
What can be the explanation for these differences in the parameters? For example,
the recovery time 1/γ ≈ 6 days is much shorter than the natural recovery period observed
in Europe and New York. The likely explanation is that the lockdown in China has been
implemented differently. Once someone tested positive or symptoms appeared, they got
immediately separated and isolated in designated quarantine facilities. This way, the
period in which the patient could infect others has been reduced to an average of 6 days
from 17 days in Europe and New York. The basic reproduction number fell accordingly.

4. Forecasting the outcome
It is vital to gain information about the course of the epidemic during the outbreak to
monitor the effectiveness of policy actions. The first question is the total number of
fatalities DT . In the present model, it is given by the non-trivial zero F (D∞ ) = 0. The
solution depends only on the basic reproduction number and on ND = pN and given by
the solution of
1 − D∞ /ND = e−R0 D∞ /ND .

(4)

This equation can be solved numerically. There are two important limiting cases where
we can solve the equations explicitly, and we can use these solutions approximately. One
is when R0 is small, and the other is when it is large. We can use these as an approximate
solution when 1 < R0 < 2.3 and when R0 > 2.3, respectively. We analyze these next.
4.1. Logistic growth
When 0 < x < 0.7 the exponential function can be approximated within 10% error with
the quadratic terms in the expansion exp(−x) ≈ 1 − x + x2 /2. Using this the differential
equation becomes

2(R0 − 1)ND
The right hand side is a parabola and this is the logistic growth equation. The final
number of fatalities is D∞ = ND 2(R0 −1)/R02 . This approximation describes the situation
in Hubei well. The parameters of the logistic equation can be easily determined by fitting
a linear regression line to the daily number of relative growth (D(t) − D(t − 1))/D(t)
as a function of D(t). In Fig. 4. we show the relative growth vs. cumulative death

for Hubei. After the initial transients, one can predict the final number of fatalities by
continuing the linear trend in the data.
In the general case the maximum number of daily deaths occurs when dF (D∗ )/dD =
0 . This equation can be solved in the general case and yields D∗ = ND log(R0 )/R0 .
In the small R0 case log(R0 ) = − log(1/R0 ) = − log(1 + 1/R0 − 1) ≈ 1 − 1/R0 and
D∗ = ND (R0 − 1)/R02 . In the logistic growth regime the midpoint of the epidemic is at
the height of the epidemic D∗ = D∞ /2.
4.2. The exponential regime
When the basic reproduction number is large, the logistic grow model breaks down. In
Fig. 5 we demonstrate this on the data from Italy, where R0 ≈ 4.7. While the SIR model
describes the evolution correctly, linear trend continuation leads to larger and larger
estimates for the number of fatalities. A better approximation can be developed by

assuming that after the peak of the epidemic (D∗  D), the argument of the exponential
is large, and the term can be dropped. This approximation leads to

We can fit this linear model to the data from Italy after the peak of the epidemic. The
result is in Fig. 6. The linear regression is in good agreement with the result of the
full SIR model. This approximation describes the situation when in the SIR model,
the susceptible population is small, and the number of infected decreases exponentially
with the rate of γ. The recovered and deceased population saturates exponentially
at the same rate. Since the recovery time Tr = 1/γ is large, this recovery process is
much slower than the buildup of the epidemic, which is happening on the timescale of

T = 1/(β − γ) = Tr /(R0 − 1). In the Italian case, the recovery period after the peak is
about four times longer than the time from the beginning to the peak.
5. Summary and outlook
In the previous sections, we have seen that the simple one-dimensional differential
equation derived from the SIR model describes the data quite reliably. The SIR model
is not able to capture all the details of the epidemic process, so the question is why it is
a good approximation in the present situation. To see this, we take a more complicated
and more adequate model to see why it can be reduced to an effective SIR model.
The SEIR model takes into consideration the incubation period, when the person is
already infected but still not infecting others. The equation for the number of exposed is
dE(t)
S(t)
=β
I(t) − aE(t),
dt
N
and for the number of infectious is
dI(t)
= aE(t) − γI(t),
dt
where TI = 1/a is the average incubation period. From this last equation, we can express
the number of exposed with the number of infectious aE(t) = dI(t)/dt + γI(t) and using
this expression, we can rewrite (5) the following way
1 d2 I(t)
dI(t)
S(t)
+ [1 + γ/a]
=β
I(t) − γI(t).

If the parameter a is larger than the two characteristic rates of the SIR model, a  β
and a  γ, then the term with the second derivative of the number of infected is much

smaller that the first derivative term and can be neglected (1/a)d2 I(t)/dt2  dI/dt in

with the new effective parameters βe = β/(1 + γ/a) and γe = γ/(1 + γ/a). The
effective parameter γe reflects the fact that the average time from infection to recovery
or death changes from 1/γ to 1/γe = 1/γ + 1/a due to the addition of the incubation
time. The ratio R0 = β/γ = βe /γe remains unchanged. The solution becomes now
0
0
F (D) = N γe p(1 − e−βe D/γe pN ) − γe D = N 0 pγ(1 − e−βD /γpN ) − γD0 , where we introduced
the rescaled quantities N 0 = N/(1 + γ/a) and D0 = D/(1 + γ/a). In other words, for
sufficiently large parameter values a, a SEIR model simulation with parameters β, γ
and N should collapse on the SIR simulation with the same β and γ parameters and
N 0 = N/(1 + γ/a) once we re-scale the number of deaths according to D0 = D/(1 + γ/a).
In Fig. 7. we show the effect of the incubation period on the shape of the epidemic
curve. Using the parameters of Table 1. we generate epidemic curves for Spain, Italy,
New York and Hubei with the SEIR model for incubation periods TI = 1/a = 1, 2 and 4
days. After re-scaling N and D the SEIR simulations nearly collapse on the SIR curve
as expected from the previous discussion.

and the parameter ND are scaled with the factor 1/(1 + γ/a). The starting and ending
slopes of the curves match exactly due to the mathematical relation between the models,
while the tops of the curves show slight dependence on a.

Similarly, more complicated epidemic models can be reduced to an effective SIR
model when the time scales of the variables are much shorter than those in the SIR
model. In the case of the separation of timescales, the fast-changing variables can be
eliminated via averaging, and a few slow master variables drive the process.
In this paper, we argued that the cumulative number of fatalities is the single
master variable in the epidemic process, and its evolution can be described by a firstorder differential equation. The model can be verified on the available data from the
advanced outbreaks in Spain, Italy, New York, and Hubei Province, China. The effective
β parameter of the process is very similar in all four cases, β̄ = 0.33 in average, The
infectious period is about 1/γ̄ = 16.7 days is in Spain, Italy, and New York, while it
is only 6 days in China, probably due to the policy of separation of the infected in
designated quarantine areas.
