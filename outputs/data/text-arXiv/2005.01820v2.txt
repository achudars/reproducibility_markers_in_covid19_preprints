A BSTRACT
The novel corona-virus disease (COVID-19), known as the causative virus of outbreak pneumonia
initially recognized in the mainland of China, late December 2019. COVID-19 reaches out to
many countries in the world, and the number of daily cases continues to increase rapidly. In
order to simulate, track, and forecast the trend of the virus spread, several mathematical and
statistical models have been developed. Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Quarantined-RecoveredDeath-Insusceptible (SEIQRDP) model is one of the most promising dynamic systems that
has been proposed for estimating the transmissibility of the COVID-19. In the present study,
we propose a Fractional-order SEIQRDP model to analyze the COVID-19 epidemic. The
Fractional-order paradigm offers a flexible, appropriate, and reliable framework for pandemic
growth characterization. In fact, fractional-order operator is not local and consider the memory of
the variables. Hence, it takes into account the sub-diffusion process of confirmed and recovered
cases growth. The results of the validation of the model using real COVID-19 data are presented,
and the pertinence of the proposed model to analyze, understand and predict the epidemic is discussed.

Introduction

COVID-19 is a respiratory disease caused by the new coronavirus that was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei province,
China, late December 2019 [1]. This novel virus soon began to spread out around the world, and on 30 January, WHO
declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). On 11 March, WHO DirectorGeneral marked COVID-19 as a pandemic [2, 3]. The transmission of COVID-19 is primarily through respiratory
droplets and contact routes [4]. Accordingly, ideal interventions to control the spread include: quarantine, isolation,
increase home confinement, promoting the wearing of face masks, travel restrictions, the closing of public space, and

A PREPRINT - J UNE 9, 2020

cancellation of events. The number of cases increased rapidly to more than 3.25 million cases, including around 231,000
deaths worldwide as of April, 30, 2020.
The novel corona-virus caused-pneumonia has attracted the attention of scientists with different backgrounds ranged
from epidemiology to data science, mathematics, and statistics. Accordingly, several studies based on either statistics or
mathematical modeling have been proposed for better analysis and a deep understanding of the evolution of this epidemic.
Besides, enormous efforts have been devoted to predicting the inflection point and ending time of this epidemic in order
to help make decisions concerning the different measures that have been taken by different governments.
Mathematical models have always played a crucial role in the understanding of the spread of the virus and in providing
relevant guidelines for controlling the pandemic. Basically, mathematical paradigms are considered to be very useful in
this context, as they provide detailed mechanisms for the epidemic dynamics. Among the most widely investigated
model for the characterization of the COVID-19 outbreak in the world is the classic Susceptible-Exposed-InfectiousRecovered (SEIR) model [1]. Since the outbreak of the virus, the SEIR model has been intensively utilized to evaluate
the effectiveness of multiple measures, which seems to be a challenging task for general other estimation methods [5–7].
For instance, it has been employed to evaluate the effects of lock-down on the transmission dynamics between provinces
in China, such as the effect of the lock-down in Hubei province on the transmission in Wuhan and Beijing [7]. In
addition, a cascading scheme of the SEIR model has been studied to emulate the process of transmission from infection
sources to humans. This approach was efficient to reach useful conclusions on the outbreak dynamics [8]. The work
of [9] presented a generalization of the classical SEIR known as Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Quarantined-RecoveredDeath-Insusceptible (SEIQRDP) model, for the epidemic analysis of COVID-19 in China. This generalization is based
on the introduction of a new quarantined state and of the effect of preventive actions, which are considered as crucial
epidemic parameters for COVID-19, such as the latent and quarantine time. As a result, considering this generalization
of SEIR, the estimation of the inflection point, ending time, and total infected cases in widely affected regions was
accurately determined and verified.
Over the last decade, the fractional-order derivative (FD), defined as a generalization of the conventional integer
derivative to a non-integer order (arbitrary order) operator, has been used to simulate many phenomena involving
memory and delays including epidemic behavior [10, 11]. FD models offer a promising tool for the description of
complex systems, in addition to their potential to incorporate accurately the memory and delay involved in the systems,
it also provides more flexibility than classical integer-order models in fitting the data accurately [12].In this paper, we
investigate a fractional version of the (SEIQRDP) model in modeling the COVID-19 epidemic’s dynamics. We will use
real data to fit the model and analyze the results, and we will provide some insights on the interpretation and role of the
fractional derivatives [11].
This paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we will recall some basic concepts from the SEIQRDP epidemic
model and the fractional-order derivatives. Section III is devoted to the presentation of fractional-order (SEIQRDP)
epidemic model (F-SEIQRDP). In Section IV, we present the materials and methods. Section v present the estimation
results. The last section discusses the obtained results and provides some future directions on the use of the model for
analyzing and controlling the COVID-19 epidemic.

Preliminaries

In this section, we recall some basic concepts from the SEIQRDP epidemic model and fractional-order derivatives
theory.
2.1

Generalized Epidemic Model: SEIQRDP

As described in [9] the SEIQRDP model consists of seven
{S(t), E(t), I(t), Q(t), R(t), D(t), P (t)} denoting at time t the followings:

sub-populations

• S(t): Susceptible cases.
• E(t): Exposed cases, which are infected but not yet be infectious, in a latent period.
• I(t): Infectious cases, which have infectious capacity but not yet be quarantined.
• Q(t): Quarantined cases, which are confirmed and infected.
• R(t): Recovered cases.
• D(t): Dead cases.
• P (t): Insusceptible cases.
2

(states),

i.e

A PREPRINT - J UNE 9, 2020

It contains also six parameters defined as follows:
• α: the protection rate.
• β: the infection rate.
• γ: the inverse of the average latent time.
• δ: the rate at which infectious people enter in quarantine.
• λ(t): a time-dependant coefficient used in the description of the cure rate. It is expressed as:


λ(t) = λ0 1 − e−λ1 t ,

(1)

where λ0 and λ1 are empirical coefficients.
• κ(t): time-dependant coefficient used in the description of the mortality rate. It is expressed as:
κ(t) = κ0 e−κ1 t ,

(2)

where κ0 and κ1 are empirical coefficients.
It is worth to note that the time-dependent expressions of the cure rate, λ(t), and the mortality rate, κ(t), are assumed to
be in the above forms based on the analysis of real data collected in some provinces in China, in January 2020, [13].
The plot and analysis of this data showed the gradually increase of the cure rate and the quick decrease of the mortality
rate. Furthermore, this assumptions are very reasonable by nature as the function of death rate in such pandemic always
converges to zero while the cure rate continues increasing toward a consistent level. The other parameters are assumed
to be constant as they are not fluctuating over time.
The above parameters are controlled by the application of the preventive interventions as well as the effectiveness of the
health systems in the investigated region. Figure 1 illustrates the relations between all the states. The dynamic of each
state is mathematically characterized by ordinary differential equations (ODE) as follows:

Figure 1: Flowchart illustrates the COVID-19 based SEIQRDP epidemic model, adopted from Fig.1 in [9].

Comparing to the classical SEIR model, SEIQRDP is augmented by three new states, {Q(t), D(t) & P(t)}. This new
quarantined state Q(t) and the recovery state R(t) constitute, originally, the recovery state of the classical SEIR model.
2.2

Fractional-order Derivative

In the past few decades, the theory of fractional calculus (FC) has gained significant research attention in several fields
such as biology and epidemic modeling [14–16]. This is originated from the interdisciplinary nature of this field as well
as the flexibility and effectiveness of FC in describing complex physical systems. For example, the characterization
of bio-impedance, modeling of the viscoelasticity and biological cells, and representing the mechanical properties
of the arterial system, as well as respiratory systems, have been investigated extensively through the exploring of
FC [12, 17–19]. The concept of FC is not new dating from the pioneer conversation between L’Hopital and Leibniz in
1695 that yielded to the generalization of the conventional integer derivative to a non-integer order operator [20], as
follows:

where q ∈ R is the order of the operator known as the fractional-order, and df is the derivative function.
There are several fractional-order derivative definitions. In this work, we introduce the three most frequently used
ones in the sense of the Riemann–Liouville, Caputo and Grünwald–Letnikov FD-based definitions [21–23]. The
Grünwald–Letnikov scheme based on finite differences has been adopted in the numerical implementation of the
proposed F-GESIR.
For a function g(t) that satisfies some smoothness conditions then:

Fractional-order SEIQRDP Epidemiological Model (F-SEIQRDP)

Similar to the SEIQRDP, [13], the F-SEIQRDP epidemiological model considers that the total population (N ) is
divided into seven sub-populations i.e {S(t), E(t), I(t), Q(t), R(t), D(t), P (t)}. As the fractional-order derivative
takes into account the history of the state, we believe that this operator is more suitable to describe the dynamics of
the epidemic COVID-19. Using the definition of the fractional-order derivative operator, we consider that each state
follows a fractional-order behavior.
Considering the nonlinear FODEs in this matrix form:
Dtq X(t) = AX(t) + L(X),

where,

Dq = [DqS , DqE , DqI , DqQ , DqR , DqD , DqP ]T
is the fractional-order derivative operator for all the states and

Data fitting algorithm and numerical simulations

The parameters of the proposed fractional-order model were estimated by a non-linear least square minimization routine,
making use of the well-known MATLAB − R2019b, function lsqnonlin. This function is based on the trust-region
reflective method [24]. The steps used to obtain the optimal estimates are outlined in Algorithm 1.

Results

The fitting performance of predicting the dynamics of Q(T ), R(t), and D(t) populations using SEIQRDP and the
proposed F-SEIQRDP are presented in Table I. It is worth to note that SEIQRDP epidemiological model can be
considered as a special case of the F-SEIQRDP, where all the fractional differentiation orders are equal to 1. From the
reported results, it is clear that for all the studied cities the ReRMSE as well as the RMSE based on F-SEIQRDP model
are less than the ones reported using SEIQRDP. These results show the usefulness of the fractional-order derivative
operator in fitting real data of the pandemic. In addition, it demonstrates the potential of the fractional-order framework
in estimating the size and the key milestones of the spread of the epidemic-COVID-19. The appropriateness of the
fractional-order paradigm can be visualized from the fact that: FD operator is not local and depends on the strength of
the memory that is controlled by the fractional differentiation order. On the other hand, the epidemiological dynamical
process is involving the memory effect within the sub-diffusion process of confirmed and recovered cases growth.
The parameter estimates for all the studied populations in different cities are reported in Table II. In this study, we choose
different cities that present different circumstances in terms of the total number of population, the number of infected

Discussion and Conclusions

Mathematical models are considered vital in every stage of the epidemic evolution. In fact, the simulation of the
epidemic dynamics helps to track and monitor the spread of the virus. In addition, models are very effective in estimating
the size of the pandemics and hence they might assist the specialized health actors to make the right decisions and

minimize the losses. This paper proposes a new general fractional-order model for the evolution of the COVID-19
pandemic. The first validation results show the accurate model fitting using real COVID-19 data from different countries.
The fractional-order derivatives provide new and pertinent parameters for the control of the epidemic. However, the
model has some limitations that we can list as follows.
• We observe that for countries with less data (reported cases in less than 30 days), the estimation is less accurate
because the trend does not appear yet (more than 28 days).
• From country to country, the initial guess of parameters should be chosen carefully to guarantee the best
possible fitting of the used optimization solver.
• The time-variable parameters need to be considered carefully because the countries do not have similar medical
facilities and expertise, and they perform different numbers of tests per day. Besides, some countries have
adopted some precautions strategies earlier than others such as quarantine, lock-down...etc.
