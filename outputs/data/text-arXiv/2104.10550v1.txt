Abstract—Several governments introduced or promoted the
use of contact-tracing apps during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In Germany, the related app is called Corona-Warn-App,
and by end of 2020, it had 22.8 million downloads. Contact
tracing is a promising approach for containing the spread of
the novel coronavirus. It is only effective if there is a large user
base, which brings new challenges like app users unfamiliar with
using smartphones or apps. As Corona-Warn-App is voluntary to
use, reaching many users and gaining a positive public perception
is crucial for its effectiveness. Based on app reviews and tweets,
we are analyzing the public perception of Corona-Warn-App. We
collected and analyzed all 78,963 app reviews for the Android
and iOS versions from release (June 2020) to beginning of
February 2021, as well as all original tweets until February 2021
containing #CoronaWarnApp (43,082). For the reviews, the most
common words and n-grams point towards technical issues, but
it remains unclear, to what extent this is due to the app itself,
the used Exposure Notification Framework, system settings on the
user’s phone, or the user’s misinterpretations of app content. For
Twitter data, overall, based on tweet content, frequent hashtags,
and interactions with tweets, we conclude that the German
Twitter-sphere widely reports adopting the app and promotes
its use.

I. I NTRODUCTION
The worldwide ubiquitous use of smartphones allows
for technical support in tackling the spread of the novel
coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and the related ongoing COVID19 pandemic [1]. Different countries with different cultures
and different traditions regarding privacy and data protection
implemented different solutions for contact-tracing apps. Such
apps mostly make sense when a significant part of the population uses them. In order to achieve public acceptability of such
apps, there is the question of public perception and sentiment,
i.e., what do the users of such an app and the general
population think about it? In this paper, we investigate the
public perception of the contact-tracing app used in Germany,
Corona-Warn-App. As an extension to existing survey-based
studies [2], [3], we analyze app review data from the Apple

of University Medicine ("Netzwerk Universitätsmedizin”), funded by the

App Store and from Google Play, as well as public tweets with
the corresponding hashtag #CoronaWarnApp. Our analysis can
help to achieve a better understanding of the users’ sentiment
toward the app. Our main contribution in this paper is the
collection and analysis of more than 75,000 app reviews and
40,000 tweets about the German COVID-19 contact-tracing
app Corona-Warn-App.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section II
introduces the background and details related work. Section
III describes the methodology and how we collected and
analyzed app reviews and tweets. In Section IV, we give the
results, which we discuss in Section V, before concluding in
Section VI.
II. BACKGROUND AND R ELATED W ORK
Corona-Warn-App is an open source COVID-19 contact
tracing app. Figure II shows the main screen of the app.
It was developed by Deutsche Telekom (one of the largest
telecommunications companies is Europe) and SAP (one of the
largest software companies in the world) and released by RKI
(Robert Koch Institute), the German federal agency for public
health responsible for disease control and prevention. The app
was released on June 16, 2020, its use is voluntary, and by
the end of November 2020, 22.8 million users downloaded the
app, with Germany having a population of 83 million1 . The
core functionality of Corona-Warn-App utilizes Bluetooth via
the Exposure Notification Framework from Apple/Google to
trace which other devices have been in proximity. The IDs that
are exchanged are generated continually and are valid for 1020 minutes. They are derived from device-specific keys that
are locally created every 24 hours. The IDs that are marked
as positive for a coronavirus test, are regularly downloaded
from a server and are locally compared to the list of devices
met before2 . When tested, the user can use the app to scan a
QR-code at the doctor’s office or testing station and can get
the result of the test via the app. At the end of 2020, CoronaWarn-App introduced a new contact journal feature, allowing
users to manually log who they met.

the background to understand how the app works. How the
tracing technically works, what changing identifiers mean, how
data is exchanged, what data is actually exchanged, etc., is
information that is hard to convey to non-tech-savvy users.
All this can create potential misunderstandings about technical
limitations in terms of functionality of the app.
Altmann et al. published a paper about a survey asking
participants about contact-tracing apps [2] (published end of
August 2020). They found very high willingness to install
and use COVID-19 contact-tracing apps. Horstmann et al.
conducted a survey about the usage of Corona-Warn-App
[3] (published mid-December 2020). A survey among 1,972
German adult reveals that non-users had low trust in other
people and often cited privacy concerns or doubts regarding
the app’s effectiveness as reasons. Now that a about a year of
the pandemic has passed and such apps are deployed and in
use for some time, publicly available data can help understand
how users perceive them, rate them, and what aspects they
discuss about.
III. M ETHODOLOGY

Fig. 1. Main screen of Corona-Warn-App.

Our previous research has shown that in general, users are
quite willing to share data with researchers when using apps
voluntarily [4]. Additionally, apps focusing on entertainment
or social networking, like Facebook or TikTok, have lots of
users in Germany, without concerns about privacy being a
deal-breaking point for the general population. The case of
a governmental contact-tracing app is different in some key
respects:
Target audience and user base: The target audience
or scope of the app is much higher compared to traditional
apps because of the ubiquity of the novel coronavirus
and its effect on daily life. Contact-tracing apps are not
aimed at any specific age group or market segment, but
are aimed at anyone using a smartphone. From the wider
scope follows a more diverse user base than any other
app. This includes users that might be unfamiliar with app
usage, smartphone usage, or technology in general, and
poses challenges to the design of the app.
Because of the big scope of the app, Corona-Warn-App
probably was under special scrutiny from its inception. Users
might be more prone to be critical of the government, combined with the large scope and user base, this might lead
to a large, critical user base with parts of it not having

We used appbot for exporting publicly available app review
data from the Apple App Store and Google Play. We exported
78,963 reviews for the time until 4 February 2021. Appbot
detects the language; 75,891 of the reviews are in German
(96%). Out of those, 77% are for the Android app and 23%
for the iPhone app. In contrast to only a rating, a review
contains manual text input from the reviewing user. For the
same time window, appbot reports 166,439 ratings, 109,539 on
Google Play (66%), and 56,900 on Apple App Store (34%).
This means that 47% of users that rated the app also wrote a
review. We analyzed the ratings of the reviews, the reviews’
distribution and ratings over time as well as the review content.
We pre-processed the review texts, this includes stop word
removal and stemming, before we analyzed the review content
in terms of frequency of used words and n-grams.
Additionally, we collected all original tweets (i.e., no retweets) containing #CoronaWarnApp until February 4, 2021
via the Twitter API v2. Twitter has 5.45 million users in
Germany as of end of 20204 . We collected 43,082 tweets and
analyzed the distribution and context of the tweets. As with
the reviews, we pre-processed the tweets before looking into
frequent words, n-grams, and hashtags.
IV. R ESULTS
First of all, we note that if the reported number of 22.8
million app downloads is correct, only about 0.7% of app
downloaders rated the app, and about half of those left a
review. Still, the number of users reflected in our analysis
is much higher than it is feasible in, e.g., a typical survey.
Furthermore, we assume that app reviews and tweets often
have a signaling effect because they can be posted by almost
anyone and are publicly visible. Users that do not see their

opinion expressed in the reviews or on Twitter can just write
their own review or tweet.
A. App Reviews
The distribution between Android and iOS in the reviews
(77% Android) roughly matches that of the distribution of
Android and iOS market shares in Germany (64% Android)5 .
Looking at all ratings, including those without a review, for
Android, 36% of the ratings were 5-star ratings, and 35% were
1-star ratings. The average was 3.0 stars. For iOS, 75% of
the ratings were 5-star ratings, the average was 4.3 stars. Just
looking at the ratings that contain a manually written review,
we get the results shown in Figures 2 and 3. The averages
for Android and iOS both were 2.9 stars. Overall, the average
rating of those with a review was lower, especially for iOS.
For the ratings with reviews, 1-star ratings made up the largest
proportion of the reviews, for both Android and iOS. We
consider this evidence that negative perceptions drive users
more to write a review than positive perceptions. Figures 2
and 3 show that almost 70% of the reviewers either gave a
1-star rating or a 5-star rating. At the time of writing, other
often downloaded apps like Jitsi Meet or Zoom show a similar
pattern of mostly 1-star or 5-star reviews.

2020, declined rapidly after that, and stayed at around 2.4
since August 2020.
For Google Play, appbot exports the public reply rates of
the app developer. The provider of the app can directly answer
to reviews. The was done to a large extent for Corona-WarnApp. The reply rate was 50%-60% for all reviews with 1 to 4
stars, and 31% for the reviews with 5 stars. There were 26,138
manual replies to reviews, indicating a large effort taken.
In order to get a better understanding of what users are
writing about in their reviews, we looked into the most
frequent words and n-grams. Taking into account the 75,891
German reviews, for pre-processing, we removed stop words.
Then, we used the CISTEM stemmer for getting the stem of
each word [5].
Table I shows the English translation of the most frequent
word stems in the German reviews. Some of the words can be
used in both positive as well as negative contexts, for example,
a review could contain "The app is not good" or "The app is
good." The word good alone does not suffice to interpret the
sentiment of the review. There are some words, however, that
we regard as relevant for understanding the public perception
of the app. We assume that (to) function, update, test, and
error all refer to the functionality of the app. While update
and error likely refer to the technical side, test likely refers
to coronavirus tests, for which the result can be received via
the app.

We observe that 36% of all reviews (as of end of January

Table II shows the most frequent bigrams, and Table III
shows the most frequent trigrams. We observe that day was
the most frequent word and that there were two frequent
bigrams containing "day": since, day and day, active. When
Corona-Warn-App is started for the first time, it indicates that
because of the incubation period, the app should be used for
14 days to track encounters for long enough before meaningful
results can be displayed. For this time period, the number of
days the app is already in use is shown on the main screen.
Day, active probably refers to this. Since, day might refer to
the same aspect, or to some other time period in which the
user is waiting for something, for example, change in app
functionality, or waiting for a test result. All other bigrams
and all listed trigrams refer to the functionality of the app.
There seems to be a focus on technical aspects: Google, API,
QR Code, communication.

B. Twitter
The first tweet with #CoronaWarnApp appeared on April 2,
2020. We collected all original tweets containing this hashtag
until February 4, 2021. There were 43,082 tweets overall. In
Figure 5, we show the number of tweets per day. Between June
15, 2020 and June 19, 2020, there were 18,901 tweets (42%
of all tweets), with a maximum of 12,058 tweets (28% of all
tweets) on June 16, 2020. Even more than for the reviews, the
peak in terms of number of tweets immediately followed after
the initial release.
After that, the plot in Figure 5 shows peaks on July 24,
August 4, and September 23. For July 24, the most common
words and hashtags did not show any specific topic besides

those covered at other times. For August 4, one single,
unverified user tweeted 222 original tweets, containing spam.
On September 23, among the frequent words and hashtags
was "Illner," the name of a talk show on German TV. Likely,
the COVID-19 pandemic and Corona-Warn-App were topics
in the show and sparked some statements or discussions on
Twitter. At the end of October 2020, Germany saw new record
numbers of new infections several times. In November, new
restrictions to public life were introduced. We assume that the
increase in tweets at the end of October can be related to that.
Looking at the top 10 tweet groups most retweets, most likes,
and most replies of German tweets, we observe that 9 out of
10 tweets were from verified accounts. The average follower
count in each group was >400,000. There was some overlap
of the users in each group. Overall, the users were mostly
publicly funded television programs, journalists, politicians,
and scientists.
For the 36,304 German tweets (84% of all tweets), we did
the same pre-processing of stop word removal and stemming
with CISTEM as for the reviews. Some of the most frequent
words from the reviews (see Table I) were also most frequent
words in the tweets: to function, more, good, day, always,
since, test. They occurred in 3% to 10% of the tweets. To
install was the most frequent word in tweets and was present
in 10% of the German tweets. We note that neither update,
nor error was among the most frequent words in the tweets.
Data protection, not among the frequent words in the reviews,
appeared in 1,708 (5%) of the tweets6 . In their work, Xue et
al. analyzed 4 million tweets related to COVID-19 and found
virus to be the most frequent word with a frequency of 1.18%
[6]. We assume that the narrower topic of Corona-Warn-App
leads to a smaller variety of tweet contents, i.e., we would
expect tweets with #CoronaWarnApp to vary less in content
6 Note

that data protection is one word in German: Datenschutz.

compared to tweets about the coronavirus in general. This, in
turn, means that tweets with #CoronaWarnApp are likely more
similar to each other compared to tweets from a broader topic,
leading to the much higher frequencies of words we observed.
Next, we looked into the hashtags used in tweets containing
#CoronaWarnApp. Leaving out those directly related to corona
(like #Corona, #COVID19, etc.), and disregarding the case of
the letters, the most common hashtags are given in Table IV.
The content here is much less focused on technical aspects.
The names of politicians, terminology commonly associated
with political debate, like mandatory mask-wearing, data
protection, covidiot, or basic rights are evidence for rather political than technical tweets. Additionally, #IchAppMit, which
uses app as a verb and signals being part of the group that
uses Corona-Warn-App, indicates promoting using the app.
V. D ISCUSSION
First, we note the low rate of reviews compared to the number of downloads. As app download numbers are not publicly
available in the Apple App Store, and Google Play only reports
broad ranges of download numbers, we look at a different area
for comparison and interpretability. For measuring success on

YouTube, successful videos gain a comments-to-view ratio of
0.5%7 , which is similar to the review-to-download ratio (0.7%)
for Corona-Warn-App. Maybe using this metric as a metric for
success does not translate from YouTube to app reviews, but
the comparison helps explaining the seemingly low interaction
rate.
Given that 36% of all reviews were from June 2020, the
month of release of the app, it is likely that the users posting
those very early reviews with relatively high ratings (see
Figure 4) did not in fact use the app for very long, but used
a positive app review as a means of supporting or promoting
the app.
Looking at the average rating for the Android and the iOS
app, we note a big difference (3.0 vs. 4.3). On the basis of
those numbers only, it is difficult to draw conclusions about
the reasons. One factor could be the variety of Android devices
and the associated challenges for development. In an academic
project, we released the Android app TYDR [7], [8] and with
around 4,000 installations, we already identified more than 600
different devices.
From Google Play, for Corona-Warn-App, we could see
the high response rates of the app developer of up to 60%.
We interpret this as strong engagement with the users, to
signal taking the reviews seriously and replying to questions,
problems, and concerns.
Looking at the frequent words and n-grams in the reviews, we noted a focus on technical terms. We interpret
this as users reporting about (issues in) their usage of the
app. There could be several factors at play that have lead
to the large amount of negative reviews and the technical
focus of the reviews. Users without proficiency in technology
were likely not be able to distinguish between bugs in the
app, (temporary) problems with the underlying Google/Apple
Exposure Notification Framework, or system-wide settings,
e.g., regarding Bluetooth or notifications. Thus, for example,
7 https://tubularlabs.com/blog/3-metrics-youtube-success/

it is hard to tell if a user that reported a problem ran into a
well-known issue in the Android ecosystem, like the reliability
of background processing, if he/she ran into a bug of CoronaWarn-App, (accidentally) turned his/her Bluetooth off, or did
not understand how to interpret what is shown on the screen.
Another factor regarding the public perception of the app
might be the world’s reaction to the pandemic, with lockdowns and social distancing that likely no-one alive has
ever seen to that extent before. Uncertainty and anxiety are
likely widespread and might fuel dissatisfaction with CoronaWarn-App independent of its functionality and design. Some
"legacy" real-world systems are integrated into Corona-WarnApp, e.g., getting the result of a test for the novel coronavirus.
Waiting for the results might be frustrating and writing a
review might be an easy outlet for that frustration.
Given the broad user base, and our hypotheses about different root-causes of the public perception of Corona-WarnApp, there might be multiple routes for future work. There
might be technical problems within the app, and/or with
the Exposure Notification Framework. Additionally, public
education about technology might increase proper usage and
help avoid confusion when using apps like Corona-WarnApp. Another field to research is the UX/UI of the app with
the broad target audience and user base in mind. Lastly, the
improvement of the integration of "legacy" real-world systems
likely progresses slowly because laws and regulation might
have to be changed.
Looking into the data we collected from Twitter, we firstly
note that the user base being active on Twitter in Germany
is much smaller than the number of people who downloaded
the app. The volume of tweets per day already gives evidence
about their content. 28% of all original tweets were published
on June 16, 2020, see Section IV-B. We regard this as evidence
that a large number of tweets might be news-related. The
most frequent words and hashtags indicate that Twitter users
are interested in political topics. Overall, given the data we
analyzed, in the Twitter-sphere, the overall sentiment is a
positive one towards using the app.
There has been work analyzing the spread of misinformation
[9] and conspiracy theories [10], [11] during the COVID-19
pandemic. Based on the most frequent words, bigrams, and
hahstags in the reviews and tweets, we find no evidence of
wide-spread conspiracy theories related to Corona-Warn-App.
Note that one limiting factor in drawing this conclusion is that
Google, Apple, and Twitter might have already deleted such
posts at the time we collected our data (beginning of 2021).
VI. C ONCLUSIONS AND F UTURE W ORK
We collected and analyzed 78,963 app reviews about
Corona-Warn-App and 43,083 original tweets containing
#CoronaWarnApp. In the reviews, the users seem mostly
interested in the apps’ functionality, while Twitter was mostly
used for news and promoting awareness of the app.
The reviews contain technical terms, often reporting issues.
It remains open to what extent these reports are based on
bugs in the app itself, on errors in the underlying OS or used

libraries, specifically the Exposure Notification Framework,
or on misunderstandings by the user. The especially diverse
user base, potentially containing users that are not familiar
with using smartphones and apps, poses special challenges
regarding the design of such an app.
Overall, both the timeline of tweets as well as the most
frequent words and hashtags indicate that Twitter is being used
for spreading news about the app and promoting its use. One
limitation of our work is that both data sources are likely
biased and thus cannot be considered representative for the
German population. The reviews are only from people who
downloaded the app, and the Twitter-sphere represents only a
fraction of the German population.
Future work includes investigating how to better convey
using apps to a non-tech-savvy audience. Additionally, future
work should focus on the users’ motivations to use the app and
their acceptance of the app. Such insights can help to address
the users’ needs and expectations. This, in turn, could help to
increase compliance with and efficacy of targeted prevention
measures in the long term.
