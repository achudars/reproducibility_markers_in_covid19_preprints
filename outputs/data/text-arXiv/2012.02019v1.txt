Abstract
COVID-19 pandemic has changed and challenged nearly every aspect of modern life. In the absence of a
cure, non-pharmaceutical intervention and behavioral changes have played a crucial role in controlling its
spread. Joint efforts of the scientific community have aimed to evaluate through models the effectiveness of
different actions and to forecast the detrimental effects of this disease. In the present work, we adapted a
recently published multi-group SEIRA model to represent the spreading dynamics of COVID-19 in Chile,
where different groups would represent geographically separated regions. Using national mobilization statistics
to estimate the connectivity among such groups and the official COVID-19 reported data by the government,
we fitted COVID-19 spreading and fatality rates, for every region. Then, we assessed the effectiveness of
different governmental interventions on the spread of COVID-19. A comparison between the reproductive
numbers (Rt ) separately obtained from raw data and fitted parameters showed a strong coupling among
different country regions, highlighting the absolute necessity of organized and coordinated actions to control
disease spread. In addition, we evaluated different scenarios to forecast the evolution of COVID-19 in the
most densely populated regions, concluding that early lifting of measures probably would have lead to novel
outbreaks.

1. Introduction
The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the seventh reported coronavirus
that can infect humans (Chan et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020). As a consequence of the fast global spread and
severe effects of the infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the
World Health Organization on 11 March 2020, resulting in 214 countries affected to date (Worldometers.info,

2020; OMS, 2020). After eight months of living in a pandemic world and despite scientific efforts, neither a
pharmaceutical treatment nor a vaccine are yet commercially available. In this scenario, non-pharmaceutical
interventions as mask-wearing, social distancing, travel bans, and lockdowns have been crucial to control and
to slow the pandemic spreading.
From a policymaker perspective, the identification of travel and mobility patterns among regions/cities/counties
in a particular country allows governments to take actions to avoid the spread of the virus. Some restrictions
seem to be obvious, such as closing the countries‚Äô borders, but others as regional quarantines are not.
Since the pandemic began, different epidemiological models have been proposed to evaluate and forecast
the evolution of the disease. A significant part of those models derives from the renowned SIR model proposed
by Kermack and McKendrick (1927), which compartmentalizes the population exposed to the virus in the
variables susceptible (S), infected (I) and Recovered (R), whose interaction determines the evolution of the
disease over time. Direct extensions of the SIR model include extra compartments to represent variables
of epidemiological interest, as SEIR models, differentiating exposed individuals that are not yet infectious,
SIRD, differentiating deaths, and SEIRA models, considering asymptomatic carriers, among others (Gondim
and Tanaka, 2020; Lalwani et al., 2020; Boujakjian, 2016; Cooper et al., 2020; Weiss, 2013; Postnikov, 2020;
Dottori and Fabricius, 2014).
However, the spread of a virus depends not only on its biological characteristics but also on the behavior of
the population where it propagates (Sun et al., 2020). Therefore, a more realistic analysis of the propagation
of the disease in a heterogeneous population usually requires models that include the interaction between
the different sub-populations (Hethcote and Thieme, 1985; Kong et al., 2016; Hethcote, 2009). These
sub-populations interact dynamically with each other, and the spreading modes are not necessarily isotropic
(Contreras et al., 2020d).
The case of Chile is an example of countries where typical SIR models would not work; Its geopolitical
centralization isolates and scatters the different regions that behave as independent populations with varying
rules of interaction (Aroca et al., 2017; Contreras et al., 2020d,a). Besides, the profound economic inequality
as reported by the Gini‚Äôs index of the world bank (World Bank, 2020) among different social classes
constitutes both physical and behavioral anisotropy for the spread of COVID-19. Chile has 16 regions with
non-homogeneous connectivity, which is represented in the modeling by the interaction matrix (Œ¶), in which
each module can be weighted. This matrix is not necessarily symmetric, it considers the fractions of the
communities that effectively interact, and it is modified by the spreading rate (Œ≤) of each sub-population
according to the restriction measures implemented by the government to every community, representing the
effective interaction in a given period.
In this work, we applied the multi-group SEIRD model presented by Contreras et al. (2020d), to represent
the COVID-19 spreading dynamics in Chile. By solving the inverse problem for parameter fitting, we assessed
the government‚Äôs actions effectiveness for controlling the outbreak, studying how parameters evolved in the
2

different epidemiological periods. By a Monte Carlo-inspired procedure (Metropolis and Ulam, 1949), we
estimated parameter variability and provided a statistically-based forecast of the pandemic‚Äôs evolution in
Chile. We also present three forecast scenarios with different degrees of social distancing, which allow us
to predict the effect of the various health policies implemented by the government, in consequence, better
decisions by part of the authorities to prevent the spreading could be taken (Chimmula and Zhang, 2020).

2. Methodology
2.1. Overview
The pipeline followed for the implementation of the proposed SEIRD multi-group model is detailed
in Figure 1. Official data of the spread of COVID-19 in Chile provided by local authorities (Ministry of
Science, 2020) is collected and pre-processed. Initial values for the different parameters of the model are
obtained from regional reports and literature. Then, the simulated annealing algorithm is used to minimize
the error existing between the reported (raw) and simulated curves, obtaining a set of values for the studied
parameters that represent better the observed epidemiological behavior. Finally, using these values and
based on different measures of social distancing proposed, different possible scenarios are presented for active
infected and deceased cases, within an established temporal horizon.

2.2. Model Description
2.2.1. Equations
In this work, we use the model proposed by Contreras et al. (2020d) to represent the spreading dynamics
of COVID-19 in Chile at a county level. Assuming that natural birth and death rate of the population can
be neglected when compared with the COVID-19 induced death rates ‚Äìwhich also occur in much shorter
timescales‚Äì, we chose Œõi = pi = di = 0. The system of equations describing the dynamics is then:

Susceptible individuals Si can acquire the virus after an effective contagion from an infected individual

are moved to a final recover Ri or death Di compartment. The description, initial values, and sources for all
the parameters in equations from (1) to (5) are shown in Table 1.

2.3. Data treatment
Raw data presented corresponds to that reported daily by the Government of Chile, available in Ministry
of Science (2020). This work analyzed official data reported daily by the Government of Chile (Ministry of
Health, 2020a), consisting in a total of 244 days until November 2nd of this year.
Regional-level daily data for each region i starts in March 3rd and include new daily infected cases, total
infected cases, and total deaths (Di ). However, due to a reporting inconsistency generated when the official
reporting guidelines changed (June 1st), datasets contained systematic errors. We corrected those errors as
explained in Supplementary Section 3. Using these corrected data sets (available as supplementary dataset),
we calculate total recovered (Ri ) and active infected cases (Ii ), defining also variables accounting for the
experimental time (Texp ) and number of inhabitants per region (nhab ).
For parameter fitting, we defined fifteen epidemiological periods for the pandemic progression in Chile,
which limits matched relevant governmental measures detailed in Table 2 (La Tercera, 2020; Biblioteca del
Congreso Nacional de Chile, 2020; Ministry of Health, 2020c).

2.4. Initial guess and nested problems
The set of initial values for the parameters (Table S3) are expected to reflect the behavior of the
different population variables (SEIRD) in the different epidemiological periods, according to the confinement
6

measures established by the government in every region. We perform a separate parameter fitting for every
epidemiological period and could be extended to a higher number of periods, if necessary.
After obtaining the simulated curves for the SEIRD variables, using the values in Table S3, we define
which parameters will be estimated by the simulated annealing algorithm, before proceeding to the formal
parameter fitting. We considered the percentage of asymptomatic patients to be constant across regions,
based on governmental reports (Ministry of Health, 2020a). Recovery and exposure rates are considered
uniform at the country level as the Chilean health system have not been overwhelmed to date. Therefore, we
obtain in the parameter fitting the local spreading and death rates (Œ≤i and Œ∏i respectively). We also provide
freedom to the initial conditions, leaving them to be adjusted too in the parameter fitting procedure.
For every parameter combination evaluated throughout the fitting process, we numerically obtain the
solution of the SEIRD model (equations (1)‚Äì(5)). Subsequently, we quantify a measure proportional to the
mean squared error (MSE) between simulated curves and raw data reported for each region, combined in the
cost functional J being minimized. The optimization algorithm selected was simulated annealing.
Finally, the initial guess for initial condition of the SEIRD variables in each region was defined as
follows: the initial value for the number of susceptible (Si (0)) people is considered as the total population
of the region, while Ei (0) = Ii (0) = Ri (0) = Di (0) = 0, except in Maule Region, where IMaule (0) = 1 and
SMaule (0) = nhab ‚àí 1 because in this region the first case was reported.
2.4.1. Dynamics of interaction between different regions
We summarize the interaction structure between the different sub-populations considered in the SEIRD
model in a connection matrix (Œ¶). In that matrix, entries (Œ¶)i,j represent the fraction of individuals from
the ith sub-population that moves to the jth. Note that Œ¶ is not necessarily symmetric, as the fluxes may
be different. Therefore, (Œ¶)i,j 6= (Œ¶)j,i In our model, Œ¶ is also modulated by the local spreading rates Œ≤i ,
thereby including governmental restrictions valid in the different periods considered.
For each region i, we estimated (Œ¶)i,j as the fraction of individuals over fifteen from i temporally moving
to j because of work or studies.
For the construction of this matrix, we collected data from national accounts of the National Statistics
Institute (INE) (2002, 2012, 2017a) and projections for 2020 (National Statistics Institute (INE), 2017b).
Based on this, the displacement matrix Œ¶ comprises factors ei and Cij . The value ei represents the fraction
of the population that leaves the region, defined as the number people of population i that travels to another
region divided by its total population nhab,i :

For each region i, we estimated (Œ¶)ij as the fraction of individuals over fifteen from i temporally moving

Given the geographical characteristics of Chile and its centralization, Regions do not have the same level
of displacement between them (Table S2).
2.5. Parameter fitting strategy: Resolution of inverse problem
The implementation of the mathematical model and resolution of the parameter-fitting inverse problem
was performed in Matlab version R2018a.
We determined the set of parameter that best describes the different regions for each epidemiological
period by minimizing a cost functional J. This functional is, in principle, proportional to the mean square
error between simulated curves and raw data. This functional J represent the accumulated difference between
the number of Inf ected, Deaths, and Recovered cases (using the established initial parameters Table S3),
and the corresponding extracted from the raw data in the official repositories in each region.

Because of difference in magnitudes in the number of inhabitants across regions, it is expected that the
error contributed by a small region will be less than that contributed by a large region. To avoid unrealistic
solutions where small regions would be left aside because of the algorithm‚Äôs blind drive to minimize the
error, we included a weighting factor. Each region was weighted by a factor directly proportional to the ratio
between its number of inhabitants and the number of infected, recovered and deceased respectively, whose
exponent was empirically set at 1.7, because using this exponent-value errors of similar orders were reported
for both large and small regions, and hence similar priorities in adjustments.

2.6. Variability assessment and forecasting
To obtain reliable values for the selected parameters, Monte Carlo simulations (Metropolis and Ulam, 1949)
were performed according to the methodology described in Contreras et al. (2020c) (N = 100). The inverse
problem for curve-fitting is solved individually, resulting in distributions of parameters. We statistically
obtained average population parameters and their variability from those distributions.
Once obtaining values for both parameters and their uncertainty, we evaluate different forecast scenarios
for the evolution of COVID-19 pandemic Chile.

3. Results
3.1. Monte Carlo simulations
As a result of Monte Carlo multiple-simulations experiment performed we obtained distributions for both
Œ≤i and Œ∏i parameters in each region, and subsequently used them to numerically solve our model. Here we
focus on active infected cases (I) and total deaths (D), since these we believe are they of greater importance
for the decision-making process.
Tables 3 and 4 show the median values obtained for Œ≤ and Œ∏, respectively, with a 95% confidence interval
in the Metropolitan, Valpara√≠so and B√≠o-B√≠o Regions. Noteworthy, these regions represent the regions
with the largest number of inhabitants in the northern, central, and southern zones of the country and
concentrates almost 60% of the total population of Chile. We observe that the highest values of Œ≤ were
in the first epidemiological period, where no social distancing measures had been established, followed by
the IV epidemiological period, for Metropolitan, Valpara√≠so, and B√≠o-B√≠o Regions. Approximately three
weeks before the government announced ‚Äúsafe return to work‚Äù or ‚Äúthe new normality‚Äù in the Metropolitan
Region. A change point for the population behavior was observed after the announcement which because of
the disease progression (latency, incubation, recovery time) the new active infected cases are delayed to the
IV period. A higher rate of infections subsequently spread from Metropolitan Region to the regions with the
highest rate of transfers: Valpara√≠so and B√≠o-B√≠o. In each epidemiological period, Œ≤ values do not present a
high variability, which is reflected in the 95% confidence interval. The periods in which there is a higher
variability correspond to those with higher Œ≤ values, so the number of infections was triggered and the fitting
becomes more challenging.
These analyses are extended to each of the 13 remaining regions of the country, establishing values of Œ≤i
and Œ∏i (i = 1...16) for each region and epidemiological period (Supplementary Tables S4 and S5). For the Œ∏
parameter, the median values obtained for the evaluated regions in each epidemiological periods are similar
compared with the official data reported as shown in Supplementary Tables S6 and S7 (Health Ministry of
Chile, 2020).

The NPI (non-pharmaceutical interventions) agenda of the government was different for each region, and
the main criterion for enacting them was the reported new cases. We observe that the spreading rate Œ≤
remained high in some regions during the first epidemiological periods before decreasing, due to the time
required for seeing the effects of lockdowns and delays associated with the disease progression. In those
regions reporting the first COVID-19 cases in Chile, the spreading rate Œ≤ decreased faster because of the
earlier establishment of restrictive measures. An example is the O‚ÄôHiggins Region, which has the lowest
average value for the fifteen epidemiological periods of spreading rate. Regarding the fatality rate Œ∏, it
remains relatively low in all regions since the hospital capacity at the country level for the correct care of
critical patients was not exceeded, and to the efficiency in the inter-regional transfers of these patients.

3.2. Inverse Problem: Setting parameters
Using the different sets of parameters obtained in the Monte Carlo experiment, the simulated curves for
the active infected cases (I) and deaths cases (D) are projected in each region over time with a two-level
calculated confidence interval (60% and 95%). Figure 2 shows both the simulations and raw data for the
Metropolitan, Valpara√≠so and B√≠o-B√≠o Regions.
We observe that simulated curves are in good agreement with raw data, which always remain within the
confidence intervals and present consistent trends. The color intensity of these zones varies depending on the
confidence intervals percentage (95% and 60%, light and dark shadows, respectively), calculated from the Œ≤
and Œ∏ distributions obtained in the Monte Carlo experiment.
In the Metropolitan Region, a peak of active cases is observed between June and July, which corresponds
11

Figure 2: Simulated curves of active infected (top) and deceased (bottom) cases for the Valpara√≠so (A,B), Metropolitan (C,D)
and B√≠o-B√≠o (E,F) Regions, along with 60% and 95% confidence intervals. Raw data for the evaluated time-frame is also
presented (grey dots).

to an increase in the number of deaths cases on the same date. The raw data for the active infected cases
in the Valpara√≠so and B√≠o-B√≠o Regions has two peaks. The first one corresponds to the date where active
cases in the Metropolitan Region were at their peak, so due to the high number of transfers between these
regions, these active cases act as vectors of infection in the destination regions, thus increasing infected cases
and therefore deceased. In contrast, the second one is related to the fact that the measures adopted by the
government are sectorized for each Region. For Valpara√≠so and B√≠o-B√≠o Regions, the isolation measures were
relaxed before than for the Metropolitan Region, resulting in a second increase rate of the active infected
cases.
In the sixteen analyzed regions, the raw data for active infected and death cases are not always consistent
with the calculated median. However, it remains in narrow confidence intervals (Figure 1 to Figure 13,
Supplementary), which is probably due to the number of days in the defined epidemiological periods.
Epidemiological periods of 15 days can capture the dynamic functioning in the regions of high and low
population, that is, it adapts to the number of inhabitants. However, when an abrupt change in the behavior
of the population occurs within a period, generating inflexion points in the curves of active infected, the
correct adjustment of the simulated curves becomes more difficult. This could be solved by further reducing
the number of days per period but risking the possibility of overfitting to raw data.
The proposed SEIRD model was able to adjust well to the data in both low-population and heavily
populated regions, showing the relevance in the 1.7 factor described in the parameter fitting strategy section.
12

Higher values for this adjustment factor result in a better adjustment in the small regions, but at the cost
of a less rigorous adjustment in the larger regions. In contrast, with values lower than 1.7, the opposite
occurs. Furthermore, it is crucial to consider the actual spreading dynamics between geographical Regions to
represent more appropriately the scenario in each Region.
3.3. On the values of Rt
The Effective Reproduction Number Rt represents the number of persons a single infected individual
might infect, in a population that is aware of the disease representing the viral spread rate of the virus,
and varies depending on the policies implemented by the government, such as quarantines (Perasso, 2018).
Based on the parameters obtained from the simulations, it is possible to calculate the value of Rt as the ratio
between the spreading rate Œ≤ and the recovery plus deaths rate (Œ≥ + Œ∏), as demonstrated in Cintr√≥n-Arias
et al. (2009). This approach allows us to obtain the effective reproduction number driven only by the local
population‚Äôs behavior, decoupled from other regions:
Rt =

Œ≤i
.
Œ∏ i + Œ≥i

(11)

We obtain a data-driven value for the observed Rt , Rtobs , adapting the methodology presented in Contreras
et al. (2020e):
Rtobs =

‚àÜI
+1
‚àÜR + ‚àÜD

(12)

In particular, both values do not necessarily need a match, as they represent -slightly- different quantities.
The observed Rtobs represents whether the overall trend is the spread or containment of the disease, purely
driven by data, and is affected by testing and tracing governmental plans (Contreras et al., 2020b). More
extensive testing will uncover unnoticed infection chains, and also increase the numbers as the uncovering
would be faster than the spread of the disease. On the other hand, the effective reproduction number
Rt accounts for local trends on contagion, disregarding whether those cases would be noticed or remain
uncovered throughout the disease timeline.
In Figure 3 the Rt values obtained from official sources and simulation results in the Metropolitan,
Valpara√≠so, and B√≠o-B√≠o Regions are presented, in conjunction with an 80% confidence interval. As is shown,
both Rt values reflect a similar behavior. However, they are not identical, probably because there is a
difference between the simulated and raw data due to the contribution of the inter-region movements in the
infection rate, which agrees with the results obtained in the inverse problem-solving.
These results for Rt show the correlation between the imposed social distancing measures and the values
of the Effective Reproduction Number, in the different regions. This value is higher in the III epidemiological
period for the three presented regions and subsequently decreases as more restrictive measures are declared.

Date and days since the first case

Figure 3: Rt values calculated from raw data (red) and simulated data (blue) for the Valpara√≠so (A), Metropolitan (B) and
B√≠o-B√≠o (C) Regions with an 80% confidence interval.

The case of the Magallanes region (Figure 26, Supplementary Material) is of particular interest, in the absence
of proper coordination around social distancing measures, a high Rt number is observed in mid-August and
consequently a second outbreak of infected assets, more significant than the first one.
Projecting these Rt values into the future, a decrease in the virus spreading rate and a reduction of the
number of active infected would be expected, since a Rt < 1 implies a slow rate of spread and the outbreak
size would decay exponentially.
3.4. Model Forecasting
To evaluate the impact of governmental interventions, we simulated different scenarios aiming to project
the contagion trends observed if those interventions did not take place. In Figure 4, we present projections
of infected cases in the Metropolitan Region, if no more restrictions were imposed after the II and III
epidemiological periods.
Due to the importance of establishing containment measures as soon as possible to avoid an excessive
spread of the virus, the first three epidemiological periods were chosen to evaluate immediate quarantine (I)
and non-imposition of measures (II and III) scenarios.
It is observed that in the scenario I the number of active infected cases reaches a peak of approximately
1500 (Figure 4, C) cases, 30 days after the first reported case. The spreading rate (Œ≤) associated with this
scenario corresponds to 0.01, registered in the VII epidemiological period in which the metropolitan region
was in total quarantine. On the other hand, in scenarios II and III active infections peak over a million
cases between days 150 - 200 (Figure 4, B). Scenario III the one that presents a higher number of infections
due mainly to two factors: The number of active infected cases at the beginning of the period and the
spreading rate. In both factors, the values are higher in the third period than in the second. In addition to
the spreading rate (Œ≤) in the third period being 0.12, while in the second period it is 0.05, a higher initial
14

Figure 4: Different simulated scenarios for active infected cases in the Metropolitan Region. Scenario I corresponds to
establishing a total quarantine from the first epidemiological period. In contrast, scenarios II and III represent the cases where
no greater measures of social distancing took place as of periods II and III, respectively. The vertical dashed red lines indicate
the date of periods I, II and III. Figure B and C correspond to different scales from figure A to visualize the scope of the curves.

number of actively infected would facilitate the spread of the virus in the presence of a high spreading rate,
explaining the behavior of the scenario II and III curves.
Using the same strategy, different future scenarios are analyzed based on the degree of confinement in
each region of the country in the future. On July 19th, the Government of Chile announced the beginning of
the "Step by Step" plan to reduce the established social distancing measures gradually. This plan involved
the gradual opening in the different communes of the country based on the contagion rate present in each
one, the percentage of occupancy of ICU (intensive care unit) beds in hospitals, and the rate of PCR test
positivity, among others. The steps are:
1. Quarantine: People cannot leave their homes.
2. Transition: People is allowed to leave the house with restrictions, only on weekdays.
3. Preparation: Individuals are free to move, but group gatherings are not permitted.
4. Initial Opening: Group gatherings are permitted, with a restricted number of people.
5. Advanced Opening: free group gatherings are permitted.
Each region that enters a new stage of the plan presents greater freedom of movement and therefore, the
number of contacts between people Œ≤ could increase. Consequently, a weighting factor is assigned to each
stage of the plan. This factor multiplies the Œ≤ value of the corresponding region to projecting the effects that
the "Step by Step" program will have on the extrapolation in the SEIRD variables (Table S8) (Gobierno de
Chile, 2020).
15

Figure 5 present three different scenarios projected for the Metropolitan Region. These scenarios are
projected in a time window until the end of 2020:
‚Ä¢ Scenario 1: The Metropolitan Region remain in stage 1 of quarantine.
‚Ä¢ Scenario 2: Current scenario. The Metropolitan Region advances to 4th phase of preparation.
‚Ä¢ Scenario 3: Limit scenario, in which the spreading rate Œ≤ increases to such an extent that large
outbreaks and the second wave of massive infections occur.

Figure 5: Different scenarios proposed for the Metropolitan Region. The first scenario (A) represents the evolution of the active
infected (top) and death (bottom) cases maintaining a lockdown from November 2nd (vertical red line) until the end of 2020,
while the second (B) and third scenario (C) represent the current situation and a massive reopening respectively.

Based on the projections, we would expect a sustained decrease in case numbers if the quarantined regime
continues. However, in the current scenario (initial opening phase), a second peak in contagion is expected.
Nevertheless, this wave would be lower in magnitude compared with the one observed in the first half of
2020, and therefore the health system would also be able to handle it. Finally, in the third scenario (where a
massive opening is proposed), we observe an uncontrolled increase in case numbers, vastly exceeding the
number of infections observed at the beginning of the pandemic. In this scenario, it would be uncertain to
predict occupancy levels of ICU beds in hospitals as well as requests for mechanical respirators. However, we
would expect a saturation of the public health system.

4. Conclusions
COVID-19 spreading depends on multiple factors, including the biological/epidemiological aspects of
SARS-CoV-2, human behavior, governmental measures, and characteristics of the affected population. Several
research groups have statistically analyzed these factors during pandemic progression, and we carefully
included them in our modelling. The multi-group SEIRD model used considers the heterogeneous distribution,
and dynamic displacement of the Chilean population, grouped in 16 regions, according to the geographical
distribution, and also a temporal progression of the taken governmental measures.
Following the presented results, our model shows to be efficient to the adjustment of the raw data,
overcoming challenges as discontinuities and high variability in it, generating simulations that are easy to
interpret and project. The measures imposed for a particular region can affect other regions, to a greater or
lesser extent depending on their interaction, thus highlighting the need for coordinated governmental actions
to control the spread of COVID-19. We have shown that the multi-group SEIRD model presented in this
work is a useful tool to represent the contribution of each region in a heterogeneously populated country and
is helpful to forecast in the short term the evolution of the different population groups.
