Abstract
The frequent emergence of diseases with the potential to become threats at local and global
scales, such as influenza A(H1N1), SARS, MERS, and recently COVID-19 disease, makes it crucial
to keep designing models of disease propagation and strategies to prevent or mitigate their effects
in populations. Since isolated systems are exceptionally rare to find in any context, especially
in human contact networks, here we examine the susceptible-infected-recovered model of disease
spreading in a multiplex network formed by two distinct networks or layers, interconnected through
a fraction q of shared individuals (overlap). We model the interactions through weighted networks,
because person-to-person interactions are diverse (or disordered ); weights represent the contact
times of the interactions. Using branching theory supported by simulations, we analyze a social
distancing strategy that reduces the average contact time in both layers, where the intensity of the
distancing is related to the topology of the layers. We find that the critical values of the distancing
intensities, above which an epidemic can be prevented, increase with the overlap q. Also we study
the effect of the social distancing on the mutual giant component of susceptible individuals, which
is crucial to keep the functionality of the system. In addition, we find that for relatively small values
of the overlap q, social distancing policies might not be needed at all to maintain the functionality
of the system.

INTRODUCTION

Localized outbreaks of resurgent or new diseases often have the potential to become
epidemics, affecting a relevant proportion of a given region, if no preventive measures are
undertaken or mitigation strategies are implemented. Worse still, the high interconnection
between cities and also between countries extremely favors the spreading of a disease
throughout the entire world, which may turn an outbreak into a pandemic in a matter
of months, weeks, or even days. This is what recently happened with COVID-19 disease,
declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020, by the World Health Organization [1, 2]. Over the
last decades researchers across multiple disciplines have been modeling disease propagation
to develop strategies that could prevent or at least curtail epidemics (and pandemics, in
the worst cases). Infectious diseases usually propagate through physical contacts among
individuals [3, 4], and researchers have found that modeling these contact patterns [5, 6] is
best achieved using complex networks [7–10], in which individuals and their interactions are
represented by nodes and links, respectively. Numerous disease propagation models have
made use of complex networks, including the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) [3, 7, 10]
and susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) [4, 7, 10–13] models. In these epidemic models,
individuals can be in different states. For example, infected (I) individuals carry the disease
and can transmit it to susceptible (S) neighbors that are not immune to the disease, while
recovered (R) individuals do not participate in the propagation process because they have
either recovered from a previous infection or because they have died. The SIR model,
in which individuals acquire permanent immunity after recovering from an illness, is the
simplest and most used to study non-recurrent diseases. In the discrete-time version of
this model [3], at each time step I individuals spread the disease to their S neighbors
with the same probability β ∈ [0, 1], and switch to the R state tr time steps after being
infected, where tr is the recovery time of the disease. The propagation reaches the final stage
when the number of I individuals goes to zero. At this stage, the fraction R of recovered
individuals indicates the extent of the infection, since all recovered individuals were once
infected. In this model, the spreading is controlled by the effective probability of infection
T = 1 − (1 − β)tr , the transmissibility, with T ∈ [0, 1]. When T is below a critical value Tc ,
also called the epidemic threshold, the fraction R of recovered individuals, which is the order
parameter of a continuous phase transition, is negligible compared to the system size N , and
3

therefore the system is in a non-epidemic phase. On the other hand, above Tc the fraction
R is comparable to N and thus it is said that the disease becomes an epidemic [13–16].
In countries such as Italy or Spain, COVID-19 disease spread uncontrollably, causing
tens of thousands of deaths, not only because of the intrinsic virulence of the disease,
but also due to the collapse of the health system. On the other hand, in countries where
the disease arrived after spreading over Europe and the United States, such as Argentina,
authorities immediately implemented a preventive massive lockdown, limiting the contact
between people. The goal was to avoid the collapse of the health system, to be able to provide
rapid and effective medical response to those affected by the disease. Nonetheless, due to the
vulnerable economic and social conditions of a vast portion of the Argentinian society, it was
practically impossible to completely cut off the interactions between people, which enabled
the disease to keep disseminating through the population. Therefore, not only is it important
to understand how a disease spreads under different isolation conditions, but it is also crucial
to evaluate how it can be mitigated. Vaccination [10, 17–24] is regarded as the most efficient
measure to prevent or attenuate an epidemic, providing individuals with immunity against
a disease. In addition, this pharmacological intervention avoids the negative consequences
that society may face after implementing strict and detrimental policies such as partial
or complete lockdown and quarantine (e.g., social and economic disruption). However, in
emergency situations such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, a vaccine is not yet available
and therefore, it is necessary to take other types of countermeasures.
On the other hand, there is a group of strategies less severe than quarantine and lockdown,
but in the same spirit. “Social distancing” strategies [25–31] are a set of actions intended
to reduce contact between individuals (shorten the interaction times, maintain a minimum
physical distance, avoid crowded places, etc.), with the aim of decreasing the probability of
disease transmission. These kinds of strategies respond to the direct transmission mechanism
of the virus that causes the COVID-19 disease, although they also apply to diseases that
spread in a similar way. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is expelled in the form of droplets from
an infected individual through mouth and nose (when talking, exhaling, or coughing), and
can enter a healthy individual (located within a 1-2 m range, approximately, and facing the
infected individual) through the mucous membranes (eyes, nose, and mouth) [32]. Therefore,
as individuals are more deeply interconnected, the probability of infection significantly
increases. Social distancing, along with partial or complete lockdown, has been undertaken
4

in many countries to face the COVID-19 pandemic. Researchers believe that, until a vaccine
is widely available, social distancing will remain one of the primary measures to combat the
spread of the disease [33].
One way of modeling social distancing measures is by reducing contact times between
individuals. In real-world networks, contact times usually span a broad distribution [6, 34,
35]. These kinds of systems are known as disordered networks, which are characterized by
the existing diversity in the strength or intensity of the interactions among the different
parts of the system. Disordered networks have been receiving much attention recently [8,
28, 30, 31]. In Ref. [31] disorder is implemented using a weighted complex network [8], in
which the weights associated with links represent the normalized contact times ω of the
interaction between two individuals. These contact times follow a power-law distribution,
W (ω) = 1/(aω) that resembles experimental results [6, 34, 35]. The parameter a is the
disorder intensity, which controls the range of contact times in the distribution along with
its average value. Also, the interactions between individuals are categorized as either close
(larger average contact time) or distant (shorter average contact time), each representing
complementary fractions (f1 and 1 − f1 , respectively) of the total number of interactions.
This is carried out by controlling the corresponding disorder intensity of the contact time
distributions. Researchers have found that for a system in an epidemic phase, when the
fraction f1 of close contacts is sufficiently small, increasing the disorder intensity of the
distant interactions to decrease their average contact time may switch the system to a
non-epidemic phase.
A significantly relevant magnitude to also consider is the size GCS of the giant component
of susceptible individuals, or largest connected cluster, at the final stage. This cluster is
formed by all the remaining susceptible (healthy) individuals that are connected with each
other, and it is the network that sustains the functionality of a society, e.g., the economy of a
region. Using a generating function formalism, Newman [36] showed that in the SIR model
there exists a second threshold T ∗ above which the giant cluster of susceptible individuals
vanishes at the final stage. On the other hand, Valdez et al. [29] showed that T ∗ is an
important parameter to determine the efficiency of a mitigation or control strategy, because
any strategy that manages to decrease the transmissibility below T ∗ can protect a large and
connected cluster of susceptible individuals, even when the system is in an epidemic state.
The previously mentioned studies were carried out using isolated networks, i.e., networks
5

that do not interact with other different networks. Researchers have noted that isolated
network models ignore the “external” connections that real-world systems use to communicate
with their environment, which usually affect the behavior of the dynamical processes that
take place on complex systems [37–40]. Thus, the modeling of interconnected networks,
i.e., networks of networks (NoN) or multilayer networks, has become extremely relevant
as it allows a more accurate representation of real systems. The ubiquity of the NoN
has encouraged researchers to use them in the study of several topics such as cascading
failure [41–43], social dynamics [44, 45], and disease propagation [46–48]. In particular, the
SIR model was simulated and solved theoretically in an overlapped multiplex network [49]
system consisting of two individual networks or layers, in which a fraction q of shared nodes
(q overlap) is present in both layers. These shared individuals connect the different layers,
and their presence makes diseases more likely to spread as q increases [49].

We believe that the aforementioned aspects are rather relevant to consider, especially
taking into account the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We aim to include them in a model
that reflects, to some extent, the situation that many regions are facing nowadays. In this
paper we study a disease-spreading process using the SIR model in an overlapped two-layer
multiplex network. The layers, A and B, have definite degree distributions and are connected
through a fraction q of shared nodes. They also have a distribution of normalized contact
times, with disorder intensities aA and aB , which are related through the topology of both
layers. Based on this model, we implement a social distancing strategy in which the average
contact times between individuals in both layers are reduced, and the disorder intensities
may be different in each layer. This could reflect the fact that people within their homes
have more prolonged interactions, while protective measures increase to reduce the contact
times when they go to work or they use public transport. We use the branching theory,
supported by extensive simulations, to study this social distancing strategy, and evaluate
its effectiveness in preventing the onset of an epidemic. In addition, the ultimate goal
is to analyze how the social distancing policies can protect the mutual giant component
of susceptible individuals, formed by the healthy individuals participating in both layers,
which is what keeps the economy of a region running. We apply this strategy in a variety
of multiplex networks with different degree distributions, to explore the effect of network
structure.

II.

MODEL: SOCIAL DISTANCING STRATEGY

We use an overlapped multiplex network formed by two layers, A and B, in which a
fraction q of nodes, called shared nodes, are present in both layers. For the construction
of the layers, both of which are of size N , we use the Molloy-Reed algorithm [50]. Each
layer has its own uncorrelated degree distribution Pi (k), which gives the probability that a
node has k neighbors in layer i = A, B. The connectivity k is limited by a minimum and a
i
i
respectively. On the one hand, we use
and kmax
maximum value, which we denote as kmin

a homogeneous Poisson distribution P (k) = e−hki hkik /k!, in which the average connectivity
hki is also the most likely value. A network with such degree distribution is known as an ER
(Erdős-Rényi) network [51]. In addition, we use a heterogeneous power-law or scale-free (SF)
distribution with exponential cutoff kc , P (k) ∝ k −λ e−k/kc , which is more representative of
real-world networks as usually some individuals may have a high number of contacts, while
the majority may have only a few [13]. We consider the exponential cutoff kc in the power-law
distribution as real-world networks are finite and the maximum number of connections of a
node is limited by the size of the system. Additionally, each layer is a weighted network in
which a link j of layer i has associated a weight ωij , where ωij is a normalized contact time
that defines the intensity of the interaction between the two individuals connected by that
link. The ωij values are taken from the theoretical distribution Wi (ωi ) = 1/(ai ωi ) [28, 31],
ωi  [e−ai , 1], where ai is the disorder intensity of layer i = A, B. Therefore, each link of
the network is assigned a weight ωij = e−ai rj [52], where rj is a random number within the
interval [0, 1].
To simulate the disease spread, we use the SIR model taking into account that the
probability of infection depends not only on the type of disease, but also on the intensity
of the interactions between individuals. All individuals are initially susceptible (S), except
for one that randomly becomes infected, called patient zero. At each time step, infected
individuals (I) spread the disease to susceptible neighbors with a probability βωi , where β
is the intrinsic infectivity of the disease, and infected individuals recover (R) after tr time
steps. We remark that bridge nodes, i.e., the individuals present in both layers, change
their state (if they become infected or get recovered) simultaneously in both layers. The
propagation stops when the number of infected individuals is zero in both layers. By using
the model described above, we can write the transmissibility of the disease in layer i = A, B
7

as Tai =

Ptr

t=1 [(1

− βe−ai )t − (1 − β)t ]/(ai t) [53]. Note that Tai is a decreasing function

of the disorder intensity ai because, since ωi  [e−ai , 1], for higher ai values shorter contact
times become more probable, and hence the disease is less likely to propagate. In the limit
ai → ∞ we have that Tai → 0, which is a complete lockdown scenario where each individual
is isolated from the rest. On the other hand, in the limit ai → 0 there is no disorder in layer
i, then the infection probabilities throughout layer i are all simply equal to β, recovering
the original SIR model in which the transmissibility is Tai → T = 1 − (1 − β)tr .
Setting different ai values allows us to implement a particular social distancing intensity
in each layer. Inspired by the current events related to the COVID-19 pandemic and the
policies undertaken by authorities in many countries, we describe next the implementation
of our social distancing strategy. We assume that the population can be divided into
two layers. One layer represents people who stay in their homes, where interactions are
more intimate and usually have a prolonged duration. The other layer represents social
interactions in environments where precaution measures are undertaken more strictly, such
as workplaces, public transport, or grocery shops. In this structured system, it is reasonable
that a fraction q of individuals may belong to both groups of people, e.g., essential workers
(food supply and distribution systems, sanitary system, public transport, etc.). We propose
that the social distancing policies undertaken in each layer are related through their topology,
setting aB = aA κB /κA . The factor κi = hki2 i/hki i is the branching factor [12, 13] of layer
i = A, B, where hki i and hki2 i are the first and second moments of the degree distribution
Pi (k), respectively. We remark that for an ER layer the branching factor increases with the
average connectivity as κ = hki + 1, while in a SF layer with exponential cutoff κ increases
as the heterogeneity parameter λ decreases. In this way, if layer B represents the social
contacts outside the households, where it is expected a more heterogeneous distribution of
the interactions, we have κB > κA and hence aB > aA ; this means that a stronger distancing
policy is implemented in layer B to counter the structure effects over the spread of the disease
in that layer (see Sec.III A). We remark that, in our model, the social distancing strategy
is static and is applied from the start of the propagation of the disease, distributing fixed
weights to the links. This could represent an optimistic scenario, where the authorities of a
particular region (e.g., city or country) are well informed about the existence of an infectious
disease, and they immediately undertake inflexible measures to get the most out of them.
Finally, we define the relevant magnitudes of the model, at the final stage, in which we
8

focus to study our distancing strategy. On the one hand, R is the relative size of the giant
component of recovered individuals, which is formed by all the individuals in the multiplex
network that get infected. On the other hand, GCS is the relative size of the mutual giant
component of susceptible individuals, composed of susceptible individuals that are connected
within a layer and between the two layers of the multiplex network. Depending on the
context, we will use GCS to refer to the mutual giant component of susceptible individuals
or to its relative size. Note that the GCS is not defined in the absence of overlap, i.e., for
q = 0.
Considering the model presented, for the analysis of the proposed strategy we examine
disease parameters β and tr so that the system enters an epidemic phase without disorder,
i.e., R > 0 for aA = aB = 0 (thus the interactions in both layers have the largest temporal
duration). We want to analyze whether or not we can find a pair of critical disorder intensity
values (aAc , aBc ) that prevent the disease from becoming an epidemic, and study how they
depend on the fraction q of shared nodes. In addition, we look for critical disorder intensity
values (a∗A , a∗B ) that can prevent the GCS from falling apart, which would certainly cause
a significant disruption in the economy of a region or country (a scenario characterized by
GCS = 0). In the next section, we develop a theoretical approach that facilitates the analysis
of the phase space for R and GCS.

THEORY: RESULTS AT THE FINAL STAGE

Phase space for R

It has been demonstrated that in isolated networks the final stage of the SIR model [4,
7, 10–13] maps exactly into link percolation [13, 52, 54] in which links between nodes
are occupied with probability p. Thus, the relevant magnitudes of this model can be
obtained theoretically. The mapping holds in the thermodynamic limit, where N → ∞,
and considering that the number of recovered individuals is zero unless they are above
a threshold sc [16], which distinguishes between an epidemic and a small outbreak. In
isolated complex networks, the critical transmissibility for which the system switches from
an epidemic to a non-epidemic phase is Tc = 1/(κ − 1), where κ is the branching factor
[12, 13] of the network.
9

Next we proceed to map the final stage of our model into link percolation using the
branching theory and the generating functions framework [13, 52, 54–56]. Given a two-layer
multiplex network with overlap 0 < q ≤ 1, we can write a system of transcendental coupled
equations for fi (TA , TB ) ≡ fi , which is the probability that a branch of infection (formed by
recovered individuals) that originates from a random link in layer i = A, B expands infinitely
through any of the layers,

dG/dx and G00 (1) = hki) are the generating functions of the degree and the excess degree
distributions, respectively [13, 52, 54–56]. Note that the factor Gi1 (x), with x = 1 − Ti fi ,
is the probability that in layer i a branch of infection reaches a node with connectivity k,
so that it cannot keep extending through its k − 1 remaining connections. In a similar
way, Gi0 (x) is the probability that a randomly chosen node is not reached by a branch of
infection through its k connections in layer i. Thus, fA is the sum of two main terms. First,
the probability of reaching an individual present only in layer A (with probability 1 − q)
so that the branch of infection expands through any of the k − 1 remaining connections
of the individual in that layer, and, second, the probability of reaching one of the shared
nodes (with probability q) so that the branch of infection expands through any of its k − 1
contacts in layer A or through any of its k connections in layer B (see Fig. 1). An analogous
interpretation holds for fB . Once we calculate the non-trivial roots of Eqs. (1) and (2), then
the fractions RA , RB , and R of recovered individuals (i.e., those reached by the branches of
infection) can be obtained from
RA = (1 − q)(1 − GA
0 (1 − TA fA )) + ξR ,

where ξR = q(1 − GA

the final stage. The factor 2−q in Eq. (5) accounts for the total number of individuals in the
system, which is (2−q)N . In Sec. IV we show the agreement between the presented equations
and the simulations of the model. Generally, if there are critical disorder intensities (aAc , aBc )

FIG. 1. Scheme of a disordered multiplex network formed by two overlapped layers, A and B.
The size of the layers is NA = NB = 15, and the fraction of nodes present in both layers is
q = 3/15 = 0.2 (vertical lines are used as a guide to show the shared nodes, which are represented
by boxes). The thickness of the segments represents the diversity of the normalized contact times
ωij between individuals. (a) Initially, all the individuals are in the susceptible (S) state, except for
an infected (I) node, which kick-starts the propagation of the disease. (b) At the final stage, the
recovered (R) individuals are connected by the branches of infection, which originate from the link
denoted by a red arrow. One of the branches, denoted by dotted lines, corresponds to the spread
of the disease only through layer A, and is represented by the first term in Eq. (1). The other
branch, denoted by dash-dotted lines, is a branch of infection that spreads through both layers and
is represented by the second term in Eq. (1).

for a given q value, these can be computed by solving the system of equations formed by
aBc = aAc κB /κA and the equation det(J f − I) = 0 evaluated at fA = fB = 0 (since at the
critical point none of the branches of infection expands infinitely). Here I is the identity

matrix and J f is the Jacobian matrix of the system of Eqs. (1) and (2), Ji,k

curves indicate epidemic phases (R > 0), which expand as the overlap q increases. Note that in
(a) the increase of hkA i causes a major increment on the critical intensities of layer A, while in
B the increment is smaller. A similar effect occurs in (b), when decreasing λB . The remaining

which we solve numerically for q  [0, 1], and where TAc ≡ TA (aAc ), TBc ≡ TB (aBc ), and
aBc ≡ aBc (aAc ). Note that Eq. (7) differs from the one obtained in Ref. [49], where both
layers of the multiplex network have the same transmissibility T , which yields a quadratic
equation for Tc (the critical transmissibility) with only one stable solution. The result
expressed by Eq. (7) reflects the case where no relation between the disorder intensities is
implemented, meaning that for every aA value could be a critical value aBc , maintaining a
fixed overlap q.
In Fig. 2 we show phase diagrams for R on the (q, aA ) and (q, aB ) planes, where we use
two layers with different degree distributions. The selected parameters for the disease are
β = 0.1 and tr = 5. In Fig. 2 (a) we use an ER layer with variable hkA i and a SF layer with
λB = 2 and cutoff kcB = 20. On the left side of the figure, the curves show the critical values
aAc as a function of the overlap q between the layers, for the different values of hkA i. The
12

colored regions correspond to the epidemic phase, where R > 0, for a given hkA i value, while
above the critical curves the system presents an epidemic-free phase, where R = 0. The
corresponding critical values aBc for the disorder intensity in layer B are plotted alongside,
considering Eq. (6). Fig. 2 (b) shows the critical curves for an ER layer with hkA i = 4
and a SF layer with variable λB . As expected in all the cases, the increase of the overlap
q causes the epidemic regions to expand, since the spread of the disease is favored by the
individuals that propagate it through both layers. This means that the distancing needed to
halt the epidemic must be stronger in both layers, thus decreasing the average duration of
the interactions. We also observe that the increase of κi (due to the increase of hkA i in Fig. 2
(a) or the decrease of λB in Fig. 2 (b) causes a major increment of the critical intensities
in layer i, while in the other layer the effect is smaller. In these cases, if the structure of a
layer changes in favor of the dissemination of the disease (i.e., increase in κi ) while the other
remains unchanged, much of the additional distancing necessary to avoid an epidemic falls
on the altered layer.

B.

Phase space for GCS

In what follows we present a set of equations that allow us to calculate the size GCS of
the mutual giant component of susceptible individuals of the multiplex network at the final
stage of the process. It is straightforward to write GCSA and GCSB , the fraction of nodes
that belong to the giant components of susceptible individuals in layer A and B (i.e., the
susceptible individuals connected within each one of the layers), respectively,
A
GCSA = (1 − q)(GA
0 (1 − TA fA ) − G0 (νA )) + ξS ,

(8)

B
GCSB = (1 − q)(GB
0 (1 − TB fB ) − G0 (νB )) + ξS .

(9)

The first terms takes into account the probability that a node that is part of only one of
the layers (with probability 1 − q) belongs to the giant component of that layer. This can
be written as the probability that a node of layer i is susceptible (Gi0 (1 − Ti fi )) minus the
probability of the node being susceptible but not belonging to the giant component (Gi0 (νi )).
B
A
B
On the other hand, ξS = q(GA
0 (1 − TA fA )G0 (1 − TB fB ) − G0 (νA )G0 (νB )) is the fraction of

shared nodes that belong to the GCS (the mutual giant component). A node is susceptible
and does not belong to the GCS if none of its links lead to susceptible nodes that do belong
13

to the GCS. But, if one of these links connects to an R node, in order to be susceptible, the
node cannot have been infected by this R node. Thus, we define νi as the probability that
a random link from layer i leads to a susceptible node that does not belong to the GCS,
or to an R node. However, note that in the last case the link must be unoccupied, with

From left to right, the first term is the probability that a random link in layer i leads to
a recovered node, which is fi but considering that the link is unoccupied, with probability
1 − Ti . The second is the probability that the random link connects to a node that belongs
only to layer i (with probability 1 − q), so that none of its outgoing links lead to susceptible
nodes belonging to the GCS, nor any of its outgoing links leads to a recovered node and is
occupied. Finally, the last term is similar to the second, but the random link in layer i leads
to a shared node (with probability q) so that besides its outgoings links in layer i, none of
its links in layer j connect to susceptible nodes that are part of the GCS, and none of its
links connects to a recovered node and is occupied. Once the values of νi and consequently
GCSi for i = A, B are obtained from Eqs. (8-11), the size of the GCS can be computed as
GCS = (GCSA + GCSB − ξS )/(2 − q).

(12)

In Sec. IV we show the agreement between the equations presented and the simulations of
the model.
To study the phase space for the GCS, we define µi as the probability that a random
link in layer i = A, B connects to a node belonging to the GCS (similarly to what was done
in Sec. III A with fi for the recovered individuals). Recall that νi is the probability that a
random link connects to an S node which does not belong to the GCS or that it connects
to an R node but considering that the link is unoccupied with probability 1 − Ti . Then we
have that µi = 1 − (νi + Ti fi ), and we obtain a system of equations for µA and µB :

where ui ≡ 1−Ti fi . If there are critical disorder intensities (a∗A , a∗B ) for a given q value, these
can be computed by solving the system of equations formed by a∗B = a∗A κB /κA , the equation

We solve this system

numerically for q  (0, 1], since the GCS (the mutual giant component of susceptible individuals)
is not defined in the absence of overlap, i.e., for q = 0.
In Fig. 3 we show phase diagrams for GCS on the (q, aA ) and (q, aB ) planes, where we use
two layers with different degree distributions (the same layers that we used for R in Fig. 2).
The selected parameters for the disease are β = 0.1 and tr = 5. In Fig. 3 (a) we use an ER
layer with variable hkA i and a SF layer with λB = 2 and cutoff kcB = 20. On the left side of
the figure, the curves show the critical values a∗A as a function of the overlap q between the
layers, for the different values of hkA i. The colored regions correspond to the non-functional
phase, where GCS = 0, for a given hkA i value, while above the critical curves the system
presents a functional phase, where GCS > 0. The corresponding critical values a∗B for the
disorder intensity in layer B are plotted alongside, considering Eq. (6). Fig. 3 (b) shows
the critical curves for an ER layer with hkA i = 4 and a SF layer with variable λB . As we
observe, there are similarities between these results and the phase diagrams presented for
R. On the one hand, the increase of κi causes a major increment in layer i of the distancing
necessary to protect the GCS, while in the remaining layer the change is smaller. However,
we note that there is a range of q values in which the critical disorder intensities vanish, i.e.,
a∗A = a∗B = 0. This range depends on the parameters of each particular multiplex network
and decreases with κi , as can be seen in Figs. 3 (a) and (b). In this region, the GCS exists
even when a distancing strategy is not implemented in any layer, thus the system does not
lose its functionality. For values of the overlap q that exceed this range, the system needs
a minimum distancing to avoid the collapse of the GCS, and an increase of q causes the
non-functional regions to expand.
Next we present the summarized results of the social distancing strategy proposed.
Looking at an individual case of the multiplex networks previously presented, in Fig. 4

hkA i = 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, from bottom to top. (b) Diagrams for an ER layer wih hkA i = 5 and a SF layer
with cutoff kcB = 20 and λB = 2.1, 2.3, 2.5, 2.7, 2.9, from top to bottom. Colored regions below
the critical curves indicate non-functional phases (GCS = 0), and functional phases (GCS > 0)
above the curves. Unlike the results shown in the phase diagrams for R, in this case the critical
intensities may vanish, i.e., a∗A = a∗B = 0, if the overlap q is relatively small. This means that the
functionality of the GCS is ensured, independently of the intensity of the implemented distancing
strategy.

we show the critical curves for R and GCS, the sizes of the giant components of susceptible
and recovered individuals throughout the entire system, respectively. We observe now that
the phase diagram is divided into three regions. In region I the disease is certainly likely
to spread because the disorder intensities implemented in both layers are quite low, which
not only fails to prevent an epidemic but also makes the GCS fall apart, causing the system
to collapse (E-NF phase). It may happen that even in the absence of a distancing strategy
the system does not lose the functionality (i.e., GCS > 0 for aA = aB = 0). This depends
on the structure of the multiplex network system (the κB /κA relation) and occurs only for
relatively small values of the overlap q (in Fig. 4, for q < 0.2 approximately). As distancing
increases, in region II the epidemic still can not be avoided, but there emerges a GCS, which
means that the system remains functional (E-F phase). Finally, region I corresponds to a
non-epidemic and functional phase (NE-F), the best possible scenario, in which the disorder

FIG. 4. Typical outcomes of the social distancing strategy applied to a multiplex network. Solid
and dashed lines represent the critical curves for R and GCS, respectively. In region I of the
diagram the social distancing policies are rather weak, leading not only to an epidemic, but also
to the crumbling of the GCS, which disrupts the functionality of the system (E-NF phase). As the
policies are intensified, in region II, the GCS is prevented from falling apart, while the emergence
of an epidemic becomes less likely (E-F phase). In region III, a strict enough social distancing
policy (i.e., high disorder intensities in both layers) ensures the system lies on a non-epidemic and
functional phase (NE-F phase), which is the best possible scenario. For the presented results, we
use an ER layer with hkA i = 5 and a SF layer with λB = 2.5 and cutoff kcB = 20. Also, we consider
a disease with β = 0.1 and tr = 5.

intensities in both layers are high enough, i.e., social distancing measures are undertaken
intensively. In this region, the system avoids an epidemic and maintains its functionality.
Considering this, even though the social distancing efforts may not prevent that a particular
disease extends through a significant portion of the population (regions I and II in Fig. 4),
they could serve to the purpose of keeping the integrity of the system (regions II and III). It is
important to note that, if a GCS remains functional after the end of an epidemic, it is highly
recommended not to relax the set of measures undertaken to prevent the transmission of the
disease, since there is always the possibility of a second outbreak (originating, for instance,
from an imported or undetected case).

Looking forward, we comment on a few elements that we are interested in analyzing in
future research. For instance, it is known that nowadays passenger traffic is one of the
17

main causes of the dissemination of a disease across different regions (cities, states, and
countries). One way to tackle this issue is to isolate individuals once they arrive to its
destination, which is currently being implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this
way, it is expected that the passengers cannot spread the disease within the region. To take
into account this possibility, instead of using an overlapped multiplex network, we could
devise a model in which shared nodes do not belong to both layers, but rather they connect
to nodes from other layers according to an inter-layer degree distribution. These nodes
would represent individuals that travel to other regions or countries, which are isolated with
a certain probability. These considerations may help in deepening the understanding of
these processes, encouraging researchers to devise more suitable and efficient strategies for
preventing and mitigating the spread of a disease. In addition, it would be relevant to study
the temporal evolution of a disease in this scenario, and how it would respond to mitigation
measures that are undertaken with some delay.

IV.

CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN THEORETICAL RESULTS AND SIMULATIONS

In this brief section we present a selected set of results from the stochastic simulations
of the model established in Sec. II, at the final stage, along with the results computed from
the equations obtained in Sec. III. Fig. 5 shows the total fraction R of recovered individuals
and the size GCS of the mutual giant component of susceptible individuals that span the
entire multiplex network as functions of the disorder intensity aA in layer A (Fig. 5 (a)) and
the overlap q (Fig. 5 (b)). The solid and black lines correspond to the theoretical results,
which agree with the simulations that are represented by symbols. We run 104 realizations
of the simulations and averaged the results considering only realizations where the number
of recovered individuals in each layer was above a threshold sc = 200 [16].

V.

CONCLUSIONS

We apply the SIR model to study the spread of a disease in an overlapped multiplex
network composed of two layers with its own distribution of contact times, in which a
fraction q of individuals belong to both layers. We propose a social distancing strategy that
reduces the average contact time of the interactions between individuals within each layer.

FIG. 5. Agreement between theoretical and simulated results. Solid and black lines correspond to
theoretical results, while simulations are shown in symbols. (a) Fraction R of recovered individuals
(red circles) and the size GCS of the mutual giant component of susceptible individuals (green
squares) as functions of the disorder intensity aA in layer A, for q = 0.5. The critical disorder
intensities are aAc ≈ 2.5, aBc ≈ 4.5 for R and a∗A ≈ 0.26, a∗B ≈ 0.46 for GCS. (b) R and GCS as
functions of the overlap q between the layers of the multiplex network, for aA = 0.5. We observe
that for q ≈ 0.81 the GCS collapses, which accounts for the overlap effect over the spread of the
disease. For the simulations, we used two layers of size N = 105 . PA (k) is a Poisson distribution
A
A
with hkA i = 4, kmin
= 0 and kmax
= 40, while PB (k) is a power-law distribution with cutoff
B = 2 and k B
kC = 20, λ = 2, kmin
max = 250.

This is achieved by increasing the respective disorder intensities, which are related through
the topology of the layers. We find that as the intensity of the distancing increases, the
system can go through different phases. For low levels of distancing, the system fails to
prevent an epidemic and to protect the functional network. The increment of the measures
reduces the spread of the disease, thus taking the system to a functional phase (which
is fundamental to keep running the economy of a society) but in an epidemic scenario.
Finally, the system reaches an epidemic-free and functional phase for high enough levels of
distancing. The critical values increase with the overlap q because the individuals that are
shared by the layers ease the spread of the disease, so that more social distancing measures
must be undertaken to prevent an epidemic. However, depending on the structure of the
multiplex network system, relatively small values of q might allow the system to maintain
the functionality, even in the absence of distancing policies. All in all, the control of contact
19

times between individuals can serve as a prevention strategy that overcomes the overlap effect
in multiplex networks, preventing not only an epidemic, but also the economic collapse of a
region or country, which might be equally harmful for society.
