ABSTRACT
The rapid emergence and the disastrous impact of the severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic on
public health, societies, and economies around the world has created an urgent need for understanding the pathways critical for
virus transmission and counteracting the spread of SARS-CoV-2 efficiently. Airborne virus transmission by asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2infected individuals is considered to be a major contributor to the
fast spread of SARS-CoV-2 and social distancing and wearing of
face masks in public have been implemented as countermeasures
in many countries. Concerted research efforts in diverse scientific
fields have meanwhile advanced the understanding of the physical
principles of the manifold processes involved in airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2. As part of these efforts, the physics and
dynamics of aerosol filtration by various types of face masks have
been studied. However, a comprehensive risk assessment framework for the airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 incorporating
realistic assumptions on the filtration of infectious aerosols (IAs)
by face masks is not available yet. In particular, in most end-to-end
models for airborne virus transmission, it is neglected that the stochastic spread of IAs through imperfectly fitted face masks depends
on the dynamics of the breathing of the wearer. In this paper, we
consider airborne virus transmission from an infected but asymptomatic individual to a healthy individual, both wearing imperfectly
fitted face masks, in an indoor environment. By framing the endto-end virus transmission as a Molecular Communications (MC)
system, we obtain a statistical description of the number of IAs inhaled by the healthy person subject to the respective configurations
of the face masks of both persons. We demonstrate that the exhalation and inhalation air flow dynamics have a significant impact on
the stochastic filtering of IAs by the imperfectly fitted face masks.
Furthermore, we are able to show that the fit of the face mask of
the infected person can highly impact the infection probability if
the infectious dose for virus transmission to the healthy person
is in a critical range. We conclude that the proposed MC model
may contribute a valuable assessment tool to fight the spread of
SARS-CoV-2 as it naturally encompasses the randomness of the
transmission process and thus enables comprehensive risk analysis
beyond statistical averages.

INTRODUCTION

The global outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [26]
since fall 2019 has impacted and is impacting societies all over the
world causing large-scale and long-term damage to public health,
society, and economy. COVID-19 is caused by a novel type of coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2),
which is highly transmissible between humans [11]. To contain the

spread of SARS-CoV-2, it has soon been advocated to target the airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in indoor environments, since
this transmission route is expected to contribute significantly to
the spread of the virus [1, 19]. Airborne viral transmission in poorly
ventilated indoor environments by asymptomatic individuals is especially relevant, because, in the absence of proper ventilation, the
infectious aerosols (IAs), i.e., the virus carrying microdroplets, possibly remain suspended in the room air for a long time and asymptomatic individuals have no indication to quarantine themselves
[16]. To minimize the risk of airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2,
face masks have been widely and successfully used in practice [8].
At the same time, experts with diverse professional backgrounds
have studied the impact of face masks on the airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 experimentally and in modeling studies [10].
While these efforts have advanced the scientific understanding of
many processes and parameters relevant for airborne virus transmission, a comprehensive assessment of the impact of face masks
on the infection risk remains challenging. Specifically, the end-toend modeling of airborne SARS-CoV-2 transmission starting with
the exhalation of IAs by an infected person (IP) and ending with
the inhalation of IAs by a healthy person (HP) is complicated by
the inherent randomness of the process. This randomness originates from the small number of IAs typically involved in virus
transmission [5] and it implies that a statistical characterization
of the transmission (beyond the mean) is required to fully assess
the infection risk. However, existing transmission models tend to
neglect this randomness in favor of a comprehensible mathematical
model and communicable outcomes [17]. Additional randomness
arises if the face mask is not fitted perfectly to the face of the wearer.
In this case, part of the breathing airflow and, consequently, some
of the exhaled IAs do not pass the mask filter piece but leak through
gaps at the edge of the mask. This leakage flow has been attributed
significance for airborne virus transmission [25] and needs therefore to be accounted for. However, in existing end-to-end models
for airborne virus transmission, it is often not taken into account.
In order to overcome these limitations, in this paper, we explore
the modeling of airborne virus transmission under the framework
of Molecular Communications (MC), an interdisciplinary research
field that has recently emerged at the intersection of information
and communication theory and biology [20].
The MC paradigm has been applied to model airborne virus
transmission in [7, 9, 12, 13, 24]. However, the impact of face masks
on the statistics of the end-to-end airborne virus transmission has
not been considered. In a recent overview paper [2], a perspective
on future directions in applying MC to viral infection research is
given. Finally, in [14], the SARS-CoV-2 transmission within the
human respiratory tract is modeled using MC.

HP by the release of signaling molecules in the form of IAs into
the channel. The HP repeatedly samples the IA concentration in
the environment by inhaling aerosols and accumulates the inhaled
IAs in his respiratory tract. If the cumulative number of inhaled
IAs exceeds some threshold, the HP gets infected, i.e., the virus has
been transmitted from the IP to the HP.
Due to the impact of several random parameters such as the
ambient air flow, the room temperature, and the air humidity on
the propagation and degradation of IAs [18], the virus transmission
is random. Furthermore, the face masks of the IP and the HP, respectively, render the release and the inhalation of the IAs random, as
some of the IAs are filtered by the masks. In the following sections,
we present models for the transmitter, the channel, and the receiver,
respectively, that encompass this randomness and finally allow us
to evaluate the statistics of the number of IAs inhaled by the HP.

In contrast to existing papers using MC to study airborne virus
transmission, we propose a novel model for airborne virus transmission via IAs that takes into account the randomness introduced
by imperfectly fitted face masks. Hence, in contrast to existing models, the model proposed in this paper allows for a comprehensive
assessment of the infection risk imposed by imperfectly fitted face
masks. By numerical evaluation, we are able to show the impact of
the physical face mask parameters on the infection probability of a
HP exposed to IAs emitted by an asymptomatic, regularly breathing
IP. We further show the impact of the different breathing dynamics
during exhalation and inhalation, respectively, on the stochastic
filtering of IAs by the face mask. Despite its simplicity, the proposed
model generates insight into the statistics of the indoor transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from an infected, but asymptomatic person
to a susceptible person both protected by imperfectly fitted face
masks.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2,
we introduce the considered physical virus transmission scenario.
In Sections 3, 4, and 5, we present the transmitter, channel, and
receiver models, respectively, required for framing airborne virus
transmission as MC system. In Section 6, we present results from the
numerical evaluation of the proposed model, before we summarize
our main findings in Section 7.

TRANSMITTER

In the considered airborne virus transmission system, cf. Section 2,
virions deposited in the respiratory tract of the IP dissolve in the
exhalation air flow and are transported as IAs through the IP‚Äôs
mouth/nose. After leaving the mouth/nose of the IP, the IAs are
either filtered by the face mask of the IP (and not further considered
in our model) or emitted into the environment (physical channel).
Hence, the molecular transmitter in our model involves three sequential stages:

PHYSICAL TRANSMISSION SCENARIO

We consider a generic closed indoor environment with one HP
present. Another person which is infected but asymptomatic, i.e.,
the IP, is present in the room for ùëátot seconds. After ùëátot seconds,
the IP leaves the room. The HP is present in the room while the IP
is present and stays in the room after the IP has left. Both the IP and
the HP breath regularly while they are present in the room. While
breathing, the IP exhales virus-carrying aerosols, i.e., the IAs1 .
Both the IP and the HP wear face masks. However, the masks
do not act as perfect filters for the IAs, because
‚Ä¢ the face mask fabric does not block all IAs [17] and
‚Ä¢ the fit of the face masks to the faces of the IP and the HP, respectively, is not perfect, such that IAs possibly pass through
gaps between the edge of the face mask and the skin during
breathing [15].
When the IP exhales, some of the viruses present in his respiratory tract dissolve in the exhalation air as IAs [18]. Upon exhalation,
some of these IAs deposit in the face mask of the IP, some are released into the ambient air. The exhaled IAs that did not deposit
in the face mask of the IP spread in the room due to the turbulent
ambient air flow [18]. Ultimately, each emitted IA either deposits on
a surface in the room or on the face mask of the IP or the HP, respectively, degrades with a rate depending on the room temperature
and relative humidity, or is inhaled by the HP or the IP [16].
In order to study the exposure of the HP to IAs released by the
IP, we frame the airborne transmission scenario outlined above as
MC system, cf. Fig.1. To this end, we consider the IP as molecular
transmitter, the HP as molecular receiver, and the room as channel.
In this system model, information is conveyed from the IP to the

‚Ä¢ Generation of solute IAs within the respiratory tract during
exhalation
‚Ä¢ Exhalation of IAs through the mouth/nose into the volume
enclosed by the face mask and the face of the IP
‚Ä¢ Deposition of IAs in the face mask or release into the environment

3.1

Number of Exhaled Infectious Aerosols

We assume that the IP stays in the room for ùëátot seconds. For simplicity, we also assume that ùëátot is an integer multiple of ùëá , i.e.,
ùëátot /ùëá = ùêº ‚àà N, where N denotes the set of positive integers and ùêº
denotes the number of breaths that the IP takes in the room. For
each interval ùëñ ‚àà {1, . . . , ùêº }, we denote the number of exhaled IAs
in ùëñ by ùëÅùëñ . According to [5], ùëÅùëñ follows a Poisson distribution with
mean ùúÜ, i.e., ùëÅùëñ ‚àº Pois(ùúÜ), and, according to empirical observations, ùúÜ ranges from 0.0000000049 virus copies per cm3 for low
emitters to 0.637 virus copies per cm3 for high emitters infected
with COVID-19 [22]. Finally, we denote the set of IAs exhaled dur√çùêº
ing ùëátot as M = {ùëÄ1, . . . , ùëÄ ùêΩ }, where ùêΩ = ùëñ=1
ùëÅùëñ . Since the ùëÅùëñ are
independent Poisson random variables (RVs) with identical mean
ùúÜ, ùêΩ is a Poisson RV with mean ùúÜùêº , i.e., ùêΩ ‚àº Pois(ùúÜùêº ).

3.2

Exhalation Model

We assume that the regular breathing of the IP follows the experimentally obtained breathing pattern reported in [15, 23]. In this
model, one breath consists of one exhalation followed by one inhalation and regular breathing is a sequence of identical breaths.
This means that each breath in such a sequence of breaths is identical with respect to its total duration and the relative duration of
exhalation and inhalation. Let ùëá denote the length of one breath
in seconds. Let further denote ùë° tx
ùëó , ùëó ‚àà {1, . . . , ùêΩ }, the time variable

1 In general, the exhalation air contains aerosols of different sizes, some of which carry
viruses and some of which do not. In this paper, we restrict our attention to small
(average diameter 5 ¬µm), virus-carrying aerosols that remain dissolved in air for up to
2.6 hours [16].

Figure 1: Block diagram of the considered transmission scenario: The HP (green circle) is exposed to infectious aerosols (IAs) emitted by the
IP (red circle) in an indoor environment. The IP breathes regularly and emits aerosols during exhalation (a), which can in general be noninfectious (blue dots) or infectious (red dots). While we consider only IAs in this paper, the non-infectious aerosols are included in this figure
to show the relative abundance of non-infectious aerosols as compared to IAs in the exhaled air of the IP [5]. Exhaled aerosols are emitted
into the environment as part of the exhalation mask flow MFex through the face mask of the IP or as part of the (unfiltered) exhalation gap
flow GFex (b). The HP breathes regularly and inhales (e) air. IAs captured by the inhalation air flow of the HP are either part of the inhalation
mask flow MFin or part of the (unfiltered) inhalation gap flow GFin (d).

Escape Probability

To account for the imperfect fit of the face mask of the IP, we
distinguish the air flows through the face mask and through the gaps
at the edge of the mask during exhalation and call them exhalation
mask flow (MFex ) and exhalation gap flow (GFex ), respectively. To
characterize MFex and GFex , we adopt the analytical fluid dynamics
model for the breathing of a person through a face mask from [21].
In this simplified model, the face area around the mouth/nose of
the person is modeled as a planar surface, the face mask is modeled
as a half-sphere, and the gaps are modeled as one cuboid extending
from the surface of the mask towards the environment, see Fig. 1(b)
for a schematic representation of the model and [21, Fig. 1] for
details. The model from [21] quantifies MFex and GFex as functions
of various parameters of the face mask and the exhaled air flow
rate. Furthermore, it has been validated by three-dimensional fluid
dynamics simulation in [21].
Let ùêπùëîex (ùë°) denote the air flow rate through the gaps at the edge of
the face mask of the IP in m3 s‚àí1 at time ùë°, 0 ‚â§ ùë° ‚â§ ùëá . According to
[21] and assuming spatially uniform air pressure within the volume
enclosed by the face mask and the skin of the IP at any time ùë°,
ùêπùëîex (ùë°) is given by [21]

Exhalation Time

After an IA ùëÄ ùëó , ùëó ‚àà {1, . . . , ùêΩ }, has been exhaled in interval ùëñ, it is
either captured by the face mask of the IP or released into the room.
We recall from Section 2 that the face mask is imperfectly fitted
to the face of the IP and, hence, some of the exhaled aerosols leak
through gaps between the face mask and the skin without passing
through the mask fabric. This leakage flow, in turn, depends on the
velocity of the exhalation air flow [21] at the time at which ùëÄ ùëó is
exhaled. Now, assuming that IAs are uniformly distributed over
the total volume of air exhaled in breath ùëñ, the probability that ùëÄ ùëó
is exhaled in any sub-interval of this breath is proportional to the
exhalation air flow rate, i.e.,

that we have assumed that ùê∏ùëò did not deposit in the face mask of
the IP during exhalation, we obtain
Pr{ùëÜùëòch = 1|ùëÜùëòtx = 1} = ùëùùëé ùëù ùë£ = 1‚àíPr{ùëÜùëòch = 0|ùëÜùëòtx = 1},

where ùëÜùëòch = 1 and ùëÜùëòch = 0 denote the events that ùê∏ùëò is captured
and not captured by the inhalation air flow of the HP in a viable
state, respectively, and ùëùùëé ùëù ùë£ is identical for all IAs. Hence, without
making any further assumptions on the room geometry, ventilation,
and other properties of the physical environment, the propagation
of ùê∏ùëò from the IP to the HP is modeled as Bernoulli RV2 . Due to the
block-based approach used in this paper (see Fig. 1), more detailed
propagation models can be readily adopted. While this is certainly
an interesting extension to the model proposed in this paper, due
to the space constraints, this is left for future work.

If IA ùëÄ ùëó instead is carried by the mask flow MFex , it deposits in
the mask with a probability corresponding to the outward filtration efficiency of the mask, FEex , and passes the mask unfiltered

Inhalation Model

Analogously to Section 3, let ùë° rx
ùëó ‚àà [0,ùëá ] denote the time variable
ranging over the interval in which IA ùëó is captured by the inhalation
air flow of the HP (this does not imply that ùëó is actually inhaled
by the HP, as there is still a chance that it deposits in the HP‚Äôs
face mask) relative to the beginning of this interval, i.e., ùë° rx
ùëó ‚àà [0,ùëá ].
The inhalation of the HP in this interval is described by the time‚àí1
dependent inhalation air flow velocity ùë¢ùë°in (ùë° rx
ùëó ) in m s given by
[15, 23]

EIA ‚àà {0, . . . , ùêΩ }, and we denote the emitted IAs by ùê∏ùëò , ùëò ‚àà
{ùëò 1, . . . , ùëò EIA } ‚äÜ {1, . . . , ùêΩ }. According to (7), the discrete RV EIA
is the sum of ùêΩ independent Bernoulli RVs with different success
probabilities depending on the random exhalation times of IAs ùëÄ ùëó .
If the ratio of the flow rates of GFex and MFex was constant with
respect to time, i.e., ùêπùëîex (ùë° 1 )/ùêπùë°ex (ùë° 1 ) = ùêπùëîex (ùë° 2 )/ùêπùë°ex (ùë° 2 ) = ùëû, for
all ùë° 1, ùë° 2 ‚àà [0,ùëá ùëóex ], EIA would be a binomial distributed RV with
success probability ùëû. However, due to the nonlinear relationship
between ùêπùëîex (ùë°) and ùêπùë°ex (ùë°) in (3), (4), this is not the case.

CHANNEL

According to Section 2, after an IA ùê∏ùëò is emitted into the environment by the IP, it is subject to the turbulent flow of the ambient
air before it either deposits on a surface, for example on a wall or
on furniture, or is inhaled by either the IP or the HP. According
to [17], the probability that ùê∏ùëò arrives at the HP in a viable, i.e.,
infectious, state can be written as the product of two probabilities,
ùëùùëé ùëù ùë£ , where ùëùùëé ‚àà [0, 1] denotes the probability that ùê∏ùëò reaches the
HP and ùëù ùë£ ‚àà [0, 1] denotes the probability that the virion carried
by the aerosol is still infectious when reaching the HP. Depending
on the room geometry, furniture, ventilation, and the positions of
the IP and the HP in the room, ùëùùëé can be estimated using tools
from fluid mechanics [3]. ùëù ùë£ depends on environmental conditions
such as the relative humidity and temperature, on the travel time
from the IP to the HP, and on the half-time of SARS-CoV-2 virions
on aerosols [17]. Now we define the Bernoulli RV ùëÜùëòch ‚àà {0, 1} to
indicate whether ùê∏ùëò reaches the HP in a viable state and, recalling

5.2

Inhalation Time

We assume that the IA ùê∏ùëò reaches the HP in a viable state according
to the definition in Section 4, i.e., ùëÜùëòch = 1. Then, the probability
that ùê∏ùëò is carried by the inhalation air flow towards the respiratory
tract of the HP at any random time ùëáùëòin ‚àà [0,ùëá ] is proportional to
the inhalation air flow, i.e.,

Since the HP, similar to the IP, wears an imperfectly fitted face mask,
the air flow resulting from the inhalation of the HP is split into a
mask flow component (MFin ) and a gap flow component (GFin ). To
model MFin and GFin , as in Section 3, we adopt the fluid dynamics
model from [21]. When an IA ùê∏ùëò reaches the HP, it follows the GFin
with a probability proportional to the flow through the gap relative
to the total inhalation flow at time ùëáùëòin , i.e.,

According to (18), IIA is a discrete random variable with support

the ùëÜ ùëó are independent Bernoulli RVs, but they are not identically
distributed due to their dependence on the random exhalation and
inhalation times of each IA, respectively. Hence, IIA does in general
not follow a Binomial distribution.
According to commonly used models for virus transmission,
HP gets infected if IIA reaches the infectious dose ùúÉ , ùúÉ ‚àà N0 , that
depends on the physical state and the state of the immune system
of the HP [17]. Hence, the virus is transmitted from IP to HP with

NUMERICAL RESULTS

In this section, we present numerical results for the MC based
airborne virus transmission model presented in Sections 3, 4, and
5. To this end, we first describe our simulation framework and
the parameters used. Then, we study the impact of some of these
parameters on the end-to-end system.

Inhalation Probability

With the observations from the previous section, we are able to
determine the probability for any IA ùê∏ùëò reaching the HP at time
ùëáùëòin to actually pass the face mask and reach the respiratory tract
of the HP. Similar to Section 3.4, we model the inhalation of ùê∏ùëò as
a binary RV ùëÜùëòrx ‚àà {0, 1}, where ùëÜùëòrx = 1 and ùëÜùëòrx = 0 denote the
events that ùê∏ùëò is inhaled by the HP and ùê∏ùëò is filtered by the face
mask of the HP, respectively. Now, ùëÜùëòrx = 1 if and only if ùê∏ùëò is part
of GFin or ùê∏ùëò is part of MFin and not filtered by the face mask. Then,
recalling that we have assumed that ùê∏ùëò did not deposit in the face
mask of IP and reached HP, we obtain

6.1

Simulation and Choice of Parameters

To simulate the transmission scenario described in Sections 3, 4,
and 5, we first computed the random number of exhaled IAs, ùêΩ ,
according to Section 3.1. Next, we simulated the transmission of
each of the ùêΩ IAs from IP to HP as a sequence of random experiments according to (16). To this end, we first computed the random
exhalation and inhalation times for each IA using inverse transform
sampling [6] after integrating and inverting (2) and (10). Then, we
used (16) to determine for each of the ùêΩ exhaled IAs whether it
was inhaled by the HP or not and finally summed up the inhaled
IAs to obtain the random number of inhaled infectious aerosols,
IIA, according to (18). We repeated this procedure 10, 000 times to
obtain the empirical distribution of the RV IAA as presented in the
following sections. Table 1 lists the default simulation parameters.

Pr{ùëÜùëòrx = 1|ùëÜùëòtx = 1, ùëÜùëòch = 1}

and ùëÜ ùëó = 0 otherwise. According to the results presented in the
previous sections, we can write ùëÜ ùëó as

Leakage at HP‚Äôs Face Mask

Next, we examine the randomness contributed by the splitting of
the inhalation air flow into mask flow and gap flow at the HP. To
this end, similar to the previous section, we drew 5000 random
inhalation times according to (10) and computed the respective
probabilities that an IA passes through the gap at the HP‚Äôs face mask.
Then, we studied the empirical distribution of these probabilities
rx of the HP‚Äôs face mask.
for different viscous porous resistances ùê∂ùëö
From Fig. 4, we observe that the spread of these probabilities is
rather small as compared to the exhalation case, cf. Fig. 3. Furthermore, we observe from Fig. 4 that the distribution of the probabilities
rx decreases, i.e., in very different
remains concentrated even as ùê∂ùëö
regimes. Indeed, this observation is plausible given that the inhalation flow as determined by (9) exhibits a smaller dynamic range
than the exhalation flow, cf. Fig. 1. One important conclusion we
draw from the observations in this section and the previous section
is that the average flow velocity is not a sufficient indicator for
the assessment of the filtration efficiency of an imperfectly fitted
face mask if the actual air flow pattern exhibits dynamics beyond
constant.

Leakage at IP‚Äôs Face Mask

First, we examined how the fit of the face mask of the IP impacts
the probability that an exhaled IA passes through the gap. To this
end, we drew 5000 random exhalation times according to (2) and
computed the respective random probabilities that particles exhaled
at these time instants are part of the gap flow GFex , cf. (5).
In Fig. 2, we show the empirical frequencies of these probabilities
after binning them into bins of width 0.05 for different gap heights
ùêªùëîtx . We observe from Fig. 2 that the mean probability for an exhaled particle to escape through the gap increases as we increase
ùêªùëîtx . Furthermore, we observe that the random escape probabilities
spread considerably. For example, for the default parameter setting
from Table 1 shown in blue in Fig. 2, the escape probabilities are
spread over the interval [0.35; 0.65]. In Fig. 3, the empirical frequencies of the escape probabilities are shown as box plots. In this
representation, we can directly compare the distributions of the
escape probabilities for different values of ùêªùëîtx . In particular, we
observe from Fig. 3 that the spread of the empirical escape probabilities is relatively large for ùêªùëîtx = 1 mm and ùêªùëîtx = 2 mm and
decreases only for ùêªùëîtx = 4 mm as in this case almost all particles
escape through the gap.

6.4

Impact of IP‚Äôs Face Mask on IIA Statistics

Finally, we examined the impact of the fit of the face mask of the IP
on the number of inhaled infectious aerosols IIA as defined in (18).
From the cumulative empirical distribution of the RV IIA shown
in Fig. 5, we observe that the infection probability, as defined in
(19), is highly sensitive towards changes in ùêªùëîtx for infectious doses
ùúÉ ranging from 2 to 12 particles. However, for larger infectious
doses, i.e., ùúÉ ‚â´ 12, the impact of ùêªùëîtx on the infection probability
is rather small. This is an interesting observation as it shows the
power of the proposed model for identifying the regime in which
the infection risk is sensitive to the fit of the IP‚Äôs face mask.

CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, we presented a novel model for the impact of imperfectly fitted face masks on airborne virus transmission based on the
MC paradigm. By formulating the problem of virus transmission as
a communication problem, we obtained a statistical virus transmission model which reveals the impact of several physical face mask
parameters on the virus transmission. The proposed model is simple
but extends existing models by encompassing the randomness of
the emission and the inhalation of IAs due to the imperfectly fitted
face masks of the IP and the HP, respectively. With the help of our
model, we could demonstrate the importance of the air flow dynamics for the assessment of the filtration efficiency of face masks. This
observation is especially relevant as virus transmission prevention
concerns foremost random (transmission) events with low probability, i.e., statistical outliers, and, hence, risk assessment beyond
first-order statistics is required. Finally, we have demonstrated how
the proposed model can be used to characterize the end-to-end
transmission of IAs from an IP to an HP statistically when both individuals wear imperfectly fitted face masks. In the broader context
of MC, our model provides a step towards understanding how the
stochastic variability of the signaling molecules, which are commonly assumed to be identical, may impact the statistics of the
end-to-end communication channel.
Possible extensions of the work presented in this paper include
a more comprehensive modeling of the physical environment in
which the virus transmission takes place and the validation of the
proposed model with empirical data.
