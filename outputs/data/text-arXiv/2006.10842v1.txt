A BSTRACT
Since the first alert launched by the World Health Organization (5 January, 2020), COVID-19 has been
spreading out to over 180 countries and territories. As of June 18, 2020, in total, there are now over
8,400,000 cases and over 450,000 related deaths. This causes massive losses in the economy and jobs
globally and confining about 58% of the global population. In this paper, we introduce SenWave, a
novel sentimental analysis work using 105+ million collected tweets and Weibo messages to evaluate
the global rise and falls of sentiments during the COVID-19 pandemic. To make a fine-grained
analysis on the feeling when we face this global health crisis, we annotate 10K tweets in English
and 10K tweets in Arabic in 10 categories, including optimistic, thankful, empathetic, pessimistic,
anxious, sad, annoyed, denial, official report, and joking. We then utilize an integrated transformer
framework, called simpletransformer, to conduct multi-label sentimental classification by fine-tuning
the pre-trained language model on the labeled data. Meanwhile, in order for a more complete analysis,
we also translate the annotated English tweets into different languages (Spanish, Italian, and French)
to generated training data for building sentiment analysis models for these languages. SenWave
thus reveals the sentiment of global conversation in six different languages on COVID-19 (covering
English, Spanish, French, Italian, Arabic and Chinese), followed the spread of the epidemic. The
conversation showed a remarkably similar pattern of rapid rise and slow decline over time across all
nations, as well as on special topics like the herd immunity strategies, to which the global conversation
reacts strongly negatively. Overall, SenWave shows that optimistic and positive sentiments increased
over time, foretelling a desire to seek, together, a reset for an improved COVID-19 world.

Introduction

Since the outbreak of coronavirus, it has affected more than 180 countries where massive losses in the economy and
jobs globally and confining about 58% of the global population are caused. Many people have been forced to work
or study from home under pandemic. The research on people’s feelings is essential for keeping mental health and
informed about Covid-19. Social medias (e.g., Twitter, Weibo) have played a major role in expressing people’s feelings

A PREPRINT - J UNE 22, 2020

and attitudes towards Covid-19. We thus target on building a system named SenWave to monitor the global sentiments
under the COVID-19 Pandemic by deep learning powered sentiment analysis.
Sentiment analysis has been widely researched in the field of natural language processing [1, 2, 3, 4]. Most of the
current sentimental analysis tasks usually consider the coarse-grained emotion labels like positive, neutral, and negative
for reviews/comments of books/products/movies, or five values to indicate the degree of emotions with the ranking
score from 1 to 5. However, the feelings of people in pandemic are much more complicated than the sentiments in
movie reviews and product comments ect. For instance, people may negatively feel angry and sad since Covid-19 leads
to the increasing number of deaths and unemployment, while others may feel optimistic because of the medical supplies
and medical assistance for the people in need. Therefore, we need to define the fine-grained labels to better understand
the impact of the health crisis on sentiment.
However, there are no appropriate and sufficient annotated data to support the building of our SenWave by training
deep learning sentiment classifiers. One non-Covid-19 tweet sentimental analysis dataset is avaliable in [5] with the
labeled 7724 English tweets, 2863 Arabic tweets, and 4240 Spanish tweets (in total 14, 827), which is a benchmark
dataset labeled in 11 categories, anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, love, optimism, pessimism, sadness, surprise,
and trust. Initially, we tried to use it as our training data for building a Covid-19 sentiment classifier. However, the
sentimental results were not suitable for Covid-19 analysis. For example, very few tweets are in the categories joy, love
and trust. Besides, many tweets of official reports were classified into inappropriate categories as well as the tweets
making jokes and denying conspiracy theories. Actually, these kinds of labels are essential in expressing opinions and
attitudes according to our observations.
Due to the lack of appropriate training data, the Covid-19 tweet sentiment analysis has been conducted mostly based on
engineered features or conventional bag-of-words derived representations not touching the deep learning models, either
in unsupervised or supervised ways but with limited training data (e.g., only 5K in [6]). Yasin et al. built a real-time
Covid-19 tweets analyzer using LDA model in USA data on positive, neutral, and negative [7]. Jia et al. used LDA
model and NRC Lexicon on the English tweets to predict one of emotions from (anger, anticipation, fear, surprise,
sadness, joy, disgust and trust) [8]. Mohammed et al. employed naïve Bayes model to predict Saudis’ attitudes towards
Covid-19 preventive measures on the (postive, negative, or neutral). Caleb et al. used logistic regression classifier
with linguistic features, hashtags and tweet embedding to identify anti-Asian hate and counterhate text [9]. However,
these methods are either limited by the sentimental dictionary and its availability or in lack of the deep understanding
of tweets semantics. Even if the supervised methods are used like naïve Bayes, they still cannot satisfy the real case
(multi-class classification) since emotions in Covid-19 can be a mixture of multiple emotions (multi-label classification).
In order to solve above problems, on one hand, we collected over 105+ million tweets covering six different languages,
including English, Spanish, French, Arabic and Italian from March 1, 2020. On the other hand, to meet the requirement
of fine-grained sentiment analysis target for Covid-19, we annotated 10,000 tweets in English and 10,000 tweets in
Arabic in 10 categories, including optimistic, thankful, empathetic, pessimistic, anxious, sad, annoyed, denial, official,
and joking. Each tweet was annotated by at least three experienced annotators in the corresponding language under
strict quality control. We allowed one tweet to be annotated by more than one category, to support the multi-label
analysis. To analyze over 1 million Chinese weibo of COVID-19 posts, we construct a set of 21,173 Weibo posts
labeled in 7 sentimental categories, such as anger, disgust, fear, optimism, sadness, surprised, and gratitude. These 41K
labeled datasets and the over 106+ million unlabeled tweets and weibo posts compose our dataset studied by SenWave.
More details about dataset are shown in Sec. 2. We will make available the data and the SenWave implementation in
public for supporting other social impact analysis of Covid-19 and fine-grained sentiment analysis. To comply with
Twitter’s Terms of Service, we will only publicly release the Tweet IDs for unlabeled data and limited number of tweet
texts for labeled data (totally 20K) for non-commercial research use. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest
labeled Covid-19 sentimental analysis dataset with the fine-grained labels.
We summarize our main contributions in this paper as follows:
• We constructed the so far the largest fine-grained annotated Covid-19 tweets dataset (10K for English tweets
and 10K for Arabic tweets) in 10 sentiment categories, which help to facilitate the studies of social impact of
Covid-19 and other fine-grained analysis tasks in research community.
• We share a large set of Covid-19 tweets IDs collected since Mar 1, 2020, in five languages accumulated over
105+ million tweets, which will be continuously updated.
• We report the usability of the labeled Covid-19 tweets by first evaluating the performance of deep learning
classifiers trained on them and then test them on the over 105 million unlabeled tweets from March 1 to May
15, 2020 to monitor how the global emotions vary in concerned topics and report other interesting findings.
This is the first report of COVID-19 sentiment over 105 million tweets. The largest analyzed COVID-19 tweet dataset
before our work is 1.8M in [8], by an unsupervised way using topic modeling and lexicon features.

Dataset Construction

2.1

Data Collection

We used Twint1 , an open source Twitter crawler, to collect our tweet dataset where Twint allows users to specify a
number of parameters alongside the query, such as tweet language, time period, etc. By forming requests with specified
parameters, the resulting response was scraped into JSON documents. We used a unified query across these languages:
“covid-19 OR coronavirus OR covid OR corona OR A¤Cw (corona in English) ”. We launched 12 instances on 24
cores for downloading daily updates and historical data up to the March 1. Data rates varied slightly throughout the
period averaging around a little over a million tweets a day. Tweets were saved as JSON documents, and pooled into a
shared medium, to be pre-processed and consumed by the language models for sentiment analysis, running on a GPU
server (GTX 1080ti GPU and 20 CPUs).
Due to the limited number of tweets in Chinese that could be found on Twitter, our data collection for the sentiment
analysis of COVID-19 in China was conducted on Sina Weibo, which is the largest social media platform in China. The
Weibo records were collected by Sina weibo API, starting from collecting first the hashtags about COVID-19, and then
extracted weibo records including these hashtags.
2.2

Data Annotation

We randomly selected 10K English and 10K Arabic tweets for sentiment annotation. These two languages are selected
because English and Arabic are among the top-5 popular languages in the world2 . In addition, English can be effectively
translated into other languages when needed. We thus have a considerably large labeled dataset for tweet sentimental
analysis. The sentiment categories were determined by domain experts after reviewing a subset of the collected tweets
and discussing for several rounds. The final determined set of labels reflect the complicated sentiments in pandemic.
These 10 labels and their covered auxiliary emotions are optimistic (representing hopeful, proud, trusting), thankful for
the efforts to combat the virus, empathetic (including praying), pessimistic (hopeless), anxious (scared, fearful), sad,
annoyed (angry), denial towards conspiracy theories, official report, and joking (ironical).
We recruited over 50 experienced annotators to make every tweet labeled by at least three annotators. Example tweets
were provided in advance to annotators with suggested categories. We allowed each tweet to be assigned to multiple
labels, which is in line with the convention. For example, the tweet “Dear Covid19, Will you please retaliate on our
behalf. We’re hopeless, helpless, restless, speechless.” has a mixture of pessimistic and sad emotions. We allowed
the multi-label annotation with our fine-grained sentiments to support the analysis of the complicated emotions in the
pandemic. In order to measure the reliability of the sentiment annotations, we conducted a verification study on the
annotated tweets where the final results of the labeled tweets is determined by the majority-voting strategy. Our labeled
dataset can also be used for other events with complex emotions, e.g., public opinion analysis and general election
analysis. The commonality is that the emotions of these events are multiple aspects.
For Chinese weibo, we analyzed the COVID-19 posts and annotated 21,173 Weibo in 7 sentimental categories, such as
optimistic, thankful, surprised, fearful, sad, angry and disgusted.

Data Description

The processed data is saved and updated in the git repository using the fetched data. To comply with Twitter’s Terms of
Service, we are only publicly releasing the Tweet IDs for unlabeled data and the limited number of Tweet texts for the
label data. Hence, the researcher can refetch the original tweet if that tweet is still public. This dataset is licensed under

Figure 1: (Top) the absolute dailiy volume of COVID-19 Tweets from Mar 1 to May 15, 2020 collected in 5 languages,
English (En), Spanish (Es), Arabic (Ar), French (Fr), and Italian (It). (Bottom) the normalized volume (normalized to
maximum number, with volume statistics in Table 1) of the 5 languages, as well as the COVID-19 Weibo in Chinese
(Zh) from Jan 10 to May 15.
2.3.1

Statistics of Unlabeled Tweets

The volumes of collected daily data for each language are illustrated in Fig. 1. The statistics show a similar pattern of
rapid rise followed by gradual fall in the global citizen conversation around COVID-19, but with the peak in messages
in Chinese reaching the maximum on January 22, two months earlier than the peak in all other languages examined on
March 12-13 and March 21, reflecting the lag between the development of the epidemic first detected in Wuhan and
the spread to reach pandemic status. The discussion and attention quickly reached the peak when important decisions
were made. For example, Italy, Spain, and France announced the national lockdown or closure of leisure areas while
UK considered the herd immunity and US announced a state of alarm on March 12-13. Meanwhile, in KSA the peak
was reached due to the King’s speech and the suspended entry to two Holy cities on March 21. In addition, people’s
attention cools down as time goes on. As shown in Table 2, the fall and rise in the volume of messages on COVID-19
was remarkably correlated for English, French, Italian, Arabic and Spanish languages, although the rise occurred earlier
in Italian, the first western nation to suffer the epidemic. The high correlation coefficient values indicate that populations
speaking different languages are responding in a similar way.
2.3.2

Information of Annotated Tweets

The label distributions are shown in Table 3. Note that the sum of the percentages is not 1 due to the multi-label
annotation in En and Ar. In English, joking and annoyed emotions took large portions, which is consistent with the the
reality, since Covid-19 causes deaths, high unemployment rates and other problems. However, we also see optimistic
emotion is the third largest category, indicating that people feel confident about combating the virus and about the
4

A PREPRINT - J UNE 22, 2020

future. In Arabic, official is significantly higher than others, because since the outbreak of Covid-19, most of the Arabic
governments announced a lot of decisions regarding different situations on Twitter.

English tweet examples of each category are shown in Table 4 where some tweets have more than one label, even with
three labels. Based on the statistics of categories, we find that more than 70% of English tweets were assigned with
more than one label, while about 20% of Arabic tweets were assigned with more than one labels. We also present
the relations between these labels in Fig. 2. While the label co-occurrence in Arabic shows as three blocks (positive,
negative and neural), the label co-occurrence in English is more complicated. These observations imply that the
multi-label classification in our English dataset is more challenging than that in Arabic. We also illustrate this fact in
the experiments.

Model Introduction
Data Preprocessing

We pre-processed the raw data to ensure the analysis quality. In details, we first remove the @users, and URLs from the
tweet because they do not contribute to the tweet analysis. Then, we remove emojis and emoticons like ^
¨ though they
can express emotions well since we focused on the analysis textual data. Next, we filtered out noisy symbols and texts,
which cannot convey meaningful semantic or lexicon information, and may even hinder the model from learning, such
as retweet symbol “RT” and some special symbols including line break, tabs and redundant blank characters. Unlike
previous methods which also removed hashtags in tweets, we kept these hashtags since they have meaningful semantics,
like “Proud to be one of the few people who hasn’t texted their ex #Covid-19 #Quarantine #lockdown”. Apart from that,
we also conducted word tokenization, steaming and tagging with the NLTK tool (https://www.nltk.org/) for English,
Spanish, French and Italian, and with Pyarabic for Arabic (https://github.com/linuxscout/pyarabic). We used Jieba for
Chinese weibo segmentation (https://github.com/fxsjy/jieba).
3.2

Multi-label Sentiment Classifiers

We built our multi-label sentiment classifiers based on deep neural network language models due to their success on
diverse NLP tasks. An integration framework called simpletransformer (https://simpletransformers.ai/) supports the
fine-tuning of these pre-trained models and the training of a customized classifier. We used XLNet [10] for English,
AraBert [11] for Arabic, and ERNIE [12] for Chinese (selected due to the better performance of ERNIE than that of
Bert [13] and LSTM).
We first evaluated the performance of the sentiment classifier in English and Arabic language on the 10K annotated
tweets by 5-fold cross validation, except Chinese on 21K labeled Weibo. Then all 10K labeled tweets were used to train
the final sentiment classifiers, except the Chinese sentiment classifier that was trained with 21K Chinese Weibo posts.
The trained model was then used for predicting the sentiments of millions of Covid-19 tweets (Mar 1 - May 15, 2020
for Non-Chinese data and January 20 - May 15, 2020 for Chinese Weibo message) for our analysis.
Considering that the translation between English and Spanish, French, Italian has been well developed, we translated
the labeled English tweets into Spanish, French, Italian with Google translate (https://translate.google.com/) to illustrate
whether our classifiers can work well . We manually checked a subset of translated tweets and were surprised by the
high quality of translation. We used Bert [13] for Spanish, French and Italian tweets representation learning, and then
follow the same steps for sentiment analysis.

Experimental Setting and Evaluation Metrics

We ran the experiments on a workstation with one GeForce GTX 1080 Ti with memory size 11178MB. The batch size
is 16, and the learning rate is 4e − 5 with 20 epochs. We used multi-label accuracy (Jaccard index), F1-macro, and
F1-micro, as well as the weak accuracy as the performance metrics. The accuracy with Jaccard index is defined as:
D

1 X Yi ∩ Ŷi
Jac.Acc =
|D| i=1 Yi ∪ Ŷi
where Yi is the ground truth labels for the i-th testing sample, and Ŷi is the predicted labels. And the weak accuracy of
multi-label classification is defined as:
D m
1 XX
Acc =
σ(ŷij == yij )
D ∗ m i=1 j=1

where σ(ŷij == yij ) checks if the predicted ŷij is the same as the ground truth yij , which can be 1 meaning the i-th
testing sample has a j-th label, and can be 0 indicating the i-th testing sample doesn’t have j-th label. The total number
of corrected prediction of yij is averaged with D by m, which are the number of testing samples and the number of
labels, respectively. In addition, we used the ranking average precision score (LRAP) and Hamming loss, which are
specified for multi-label classification.

Results and Analysis
Performance of Classifier

We present the 5-fold cross validation results of our multi-label classifiers on SenWave in Table 5. Our classifiers reach
above 80% weak accuracy values, which prove the effectiveness of our models. The multi-label Jaccard accuracy of
English and Arabic data is larger/equal than/to 0.5. However, the accuracy of Spanish, French and Italian tweets are
not better than the original data. The reasons can be two-folds: 1) the usage of different pre-trained language models:
XLNet used for English tweets and AraBert used for Arabic tweets perform better than Bert generally used for Spanish,
French and Italian on the same conditions [10, 11]; 2) the difficulty of classifying multi-label English tweets due to the
complex multi-labels (shown in Fig. 2 (a)). We are working on the improvement of these models. It is worth noting that
F1 values are around 0.5 due to the class imbalance issue, which will be resolved in our future work. However, the
high accuracy, LRAP and low Hamming loss demonstrate that the trained classifiers are usable for practical usage. The
multi-class classification accuracy of Chinese weibo shown in Table 5 helped us select ERNIE (with accuracy 0.88) for
the final analysis due to its better performance than Bert (with accuracy 0.83) and LSTM (with accuracy 0.78).

Sentiments Variation in Six Languages Over Days

We present the sentiments variation of 6 languages from March 1 to May 15, 2020 for Non-Chinese data and from
January 20 to May 15, 2020 for Chinese Weibo message in Fig. 3. The statistics of these sentiment results are given in
Table 6.
The sentiment results of English tweets are shown in Fig. 3 (a). All the positive emotions, including optimistic, thankful
and empathetic, showed the similar trend of first rising up and then falling down. It implies that people first felt positive
due to the various decisions made for combating the virus staring from the mid of March. However, the emotions went
down in late April when a large number of people got infected. Among negative emotions, anxious and joking fell down
with the slope −0.0004 and −0.0007 respectively as time went on, while the others went stable with slight changes.
The anxious may be reduced by the increasing of medical supplies and the fact that people have known much better
about Covid-19 than before and got used to the ways living with Covid-19. However, the resulted high unemployment
rate and the high number of death may be the reason that sad and annoyed have been staying high.
The results of Arabic tweets shown in Fig. 3 (b) demonstrate significant variations in all categories of emotions. In
particular, optimistic has been rising up, and anxious, denial and joking are falling down. The sad emotion keeps rising
up due to the increasing number of new cases in several Arabic-speaking populations, such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar and
United Arab Emirates (UAE).
The rise of optimistic and thankful and the fall of pessimistic and annoyed were also observed in Fig. 3 (c) of Spanish
tweets. The similar trend of increase in thankful is observed in French tweets, as shown in Fig. 3 (d). However, the
other emotions went stable, except the decline of joking and the sudden increase of denial to the conspiracy theory of
lab source of corona-virus. Italian tweets also showed weak increase or decrease trends in most of the emotions, as
shown in Fig. 3 (e), except those in thankful and empathetic.
The Chinese Weibo sentiments show strong variations, but no obvious trend of increase and decrease, as shown in Fig. 3
(f). The most significant decrease in fearful is observed in the very beginning on Jan 20, 2020, when human-to-human
transmission was confirmed on that day. The fearful state continued until January 22, when Wuhan was locked, and the
arrival of Chinese New Year. The significant jumping up of sad on April 4 due to the nationwide memorial for victims
of Covid-19.

Sentiments Variation of Selected Areas Over Days

We selected some countries and areas to illustrate how the sentiments vary over days including USA, Washington D.C. ,
UK, Spain, Argentina and Saudi Arabia in Fig. 4. The statistics of these sentiment results are given in Table 7.

Figure 3: Sentiment variation of all languages over time. Each subfigure shows the results of one type of languages
including 9 emotions for non-Chinese tweets and 7 emotions for Chinese Weibo messages. The linear regression line is
fit to each emotion curve, showing the trend of the emotion variation.

Fig. 4 (a) shows in USA, the portion of negative emotions is higher than that of positive emotions. On March 12, people
felt annoyed and anxious (see the pie charts) since the normal life was affected by coronavirus e.g., cancellation of
sport events and suspending of transportation. On March 21, however, the positive emotions had a slight increase when
people were showing gratitude for the efforts of healthcare workers. Similarly, on March 28, people were suggested to
follow the guidelines to stay coronavirus free. However, the negative emotions went up once again due to the increasing
rate of death, infection and unemployment on April 11. Several days later on April 18, this figures augmented because
USA death toll was the highest in the world and it was still rising quickly.

Fig. 4 (b) shows in Washington D.C., on March 2, negative emotions (shown by the blue line) went to the peak due to a
public health official announcement saying that outbreak of a new coronavirus could soon become a pandemic (see

the pie chart at the right hand). On March 13, there was a positive spike due to the declaration of a National Day of
Prayer amid coronavirus pandemic. On March 29, negative pumped up due to the high number of death within one day
achieving 2000, and especially a significant increase of anxious because of the negligence of social distancing, even
having gathering. On April 13, many people showed gratitude to the medical professionals and front-line workers (see
the pie chart at the right hand) while during April 27 and 28, people expressed their dissatisfaction with the government
due to the resistance, as well as on May 10.
Fig. 4(c) shows in UK, on March 9, the negative emotions caused by panic buying of hand sanitizer and toilet roll
and people’s fear to coronavirus and oil price war leading to the plunging of FTSE 100. After different cornoavirus
measures were imposed, the positive sentiment went up significantly. It would be better to zoom in the figures to see
other detailed interpretation.
In Spain (Fig. 4(d)), people applauded for the health care workers treating the coronavirus on the balcony on March 15,
felt angry about the extension of another 15 days of alarm and sad about the third highest number of deaths on March
22 (in pie chart).
In Argentina shown in Fig. 4 (e), the proportion of negative emotions was very close to 0.5 even much higher in some
days. On March 8, the discussions about first dead case of coronavirus and dengue were focused on leading to the
increase of anxious, sad and annoyed (see pie chart at the right hand). On March 21, the feelings of stress, anxiety,
panic went up because of the long quarantine, which resulted in the increase of anxious and sad. On April 29, more
than 2,300 prisoners were released because of the coronavirus, which increased the feelings of pessimistic, anxious and
annoyed.
Fig. 4 (f) shows stronger positive sentiment in Saudi Arabia than in other countries or areas. Especially, starting from
March 13, there was an increase of positive emotions when a lot of decisions were taken by the Saudi government. The
peak was reached on March 21, responding to a tweet by the Saudi minister of health: “We are all responsible, staying
home is our strongest weapon against the virus”. Another positive peak was shown on April 23-24, when Ramadan
started.

Figure 4: Sentiment variation in different regions over time. Each bar shows the distribution of sentiments on one day,
where sentiments are shown in different colors. The blue curve and purple curve show the positive (sum of optimistic,
thankful, empathetic in yellow at different intensity) and the negative (sum of pessimistic, anxious, sad, annoyed, denial
in blue at different intensity), respectively. (Better zoom in to see the interpretation of spikes)
4.4

Sentiments Variation of Studied Topics Over Days

We give the sentiment analysis of 7 topics including stock market, oil price, herd immunity, economic stimulus,
drug/medicine/vaccine, employment/job, and working from home. The results are shown in Figure 5. The statistics of
these sentiment results are given in Table 8.
The topic stock markets collapsed on March 9, when the peak of discussion was reached. On this day, anxious reaches a
high value, which is greater than mean+2*std (out of the black dash line, and the black line is the mean, the dot line is
the mean-2*std). On March 12, the DJI (Dow Jones Index) had its worst day since 1987, plunging about 10% (the
second time breakers) and the volumes arrived the second largest. The anxious state remained at a high rate during
these days. On the weekends of March 20-21 and March 28-29, the spikes of denial are higher than the blue dash line
(mean+2*std), as a reflection of the continuous stock market collapse. DJI: Dow Jones Industrial Average is shown on
top of the denial curve, and the markers indicate the days of March 9, 20 and 28, when these negative sentiments are
reflected on the drop of DJI, as shown in Fig.5(a).
The topic oil price also showed the peak of discussion on March 9. The drop of crude oil price resulted in significant
anxious on March 9-12. However, this was not the worst. On April 21, crude oil price reached an 18-year low, which
is shown on the marked point on the WTI crude oil curve. Among the triggered discussion, we see pessimistic was
significant.
The topic herd immunity quickly reached the top on March 14-15 when UK government initially considered it on
March 13. Among the intensive discussions from March 13 to 17, denial and joking were significantly observed on

Figure 5: Sentiments variation on seven topics. We show the sentiment results for these topics when they were
intensively discussed (around the peak of volume curve in the background).

March 15-16. The discussion continued with significant annoyed from March 22 to April 7, and caused another rise of
denial on April 12-13.
The topic economic stimulus reached top on March 26 when US Senate passed historic $2tn relief package. And another
peak on April 15-16 when the checks were received. Surprisingly, during the discussion in March 23-26, positive was
lower compared to other days, and denial was significant on March 25. We found many tweets under this topic are for
example “this is not enough”, “US economy is tanking”, and “the pandemic is getting worse”. By looking into the
joking, we see increases in March 24-30 and April 13-18.
The topic drug/medicine/vaccine collected the largest amount of discussion among these 7 topics (reaching 20-40K on
the daily volume). This topic has been hot since the global outbreak around March 10. Two events in this topic caused
11

A PREPRINT - J UNE 22, 2020

significant denial and annoyed. The first event was on March 15-16, Germany tries to stop U.S. poaching German firm
seeking coronavirus vaccine. The second event was on April 6-7, when Anti-Malaria drugs were hyped as unproven
coronavirus treatment. Overall from March to May, we see two sections of more anxious and less optimistic, and two
other sections of less anxious and optimistic.
The topic employment/job covered the hot words such as unemployment, income, rent, salary, mortgage, laid off, no
job/work etc, as shown in the table included in Fig.5(f). In March, we see the increase of optimistic and the decrease of
annoyed, however in April-May, we see less optimistic and the increase of annoyed. Peak of anxious was found on May
8-10, when the reported April unemployment rate rose to a record 14.7% in US.
The topic working from home (WFH) is a warm topic, which obviously has more positive than all other topics. The
bars in Fig.5(g) show that optimistic took more than 40% in WFH, which is much higher than optimistic in other topics
(between 10% and 25%) shown in Fig.5(a-f). We also see that optimistic keeps increasing with a slope of 0.0015, while
anxious is decreasing with a slope of −0.0008. Only on two days, optimistic dropped: April 18 when a UK police chief
was criticised on a covid-19 mass gathering, and May 10 when PM calls on UK to go back to work.

Conclusion

This paper contributed a Covid-19 sentimental analysis system with annotate datasets, called SenWave, which includes
20K labeled English and Arabic tweets, and 21K labeled Chinese Weibo, as well as 106M+ Covid-19 tweets and Weibo
messages collected since Mar 1, 2020 and January 20 respectively. We trained classifiers for 6 languages based on deep
learning language models to monitor the global sentiments under the Covid-19 pandemic sentimental. We analyzed
the sentiments varying of all languages and hot topics over days. On one hand, the emotions on these languages can
be directly reflected by corresponding events at the specific days through the varying of volumes and a significant
increase of emotions. On the other hand, the sentimental varying trends of 7 topics are also analyzed by showing the
corresponding emotions. This work helps to provide a rich resource to the community to study and combat COVID-19.

Appendix
We present the hot words of the predicted English tweets for each category shown in Fig. 6 on March 9, 2020. More
representations of different languages will be provided in future. The class optimistic is represented with hand washing
and health, which means people should wash their hands frequently to keep health. The class thankful is presented with
Covid-19 testing, while the class empathetic is shown with pray, hope, god and safe. The class pessimistic is reflected
with economy market, oil market and large number of death. These hot words are also suitable for the class anxious.
People felt sad about a lot of death and confirmed cases and the lockdown of school. The class annoyed is displayed
with dont and flu while the class denial is demonstrated with market and China since some people didn’t believe the
Covid-19 report of China. Overall, these hot words in each category can represent the sentiments to some extend.
