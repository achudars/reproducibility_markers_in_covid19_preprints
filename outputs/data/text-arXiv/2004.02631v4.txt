Abstract: There is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID‐19 that is causing a global
pandemic. One current focus is drug repurposing research, but those drugs have limited therapeutic
efficacies and known adverse effects. The pathology of COVID‐19 is essentially unknow. Without
this understanding, it is challenging to discover a successful treatment to be approved for clinical
use. This paper addresses several key biological processes of reactive oxygen, halogen and nitrogen
species (ROS, RHS and RNS) that play crucial physiological roles in organisms from plants to
humans. These include why superoxide dismutases, the enzymes to catalyze the formation of H2O2,
are required for protecting ROS‐induced injury in cell metabolism, why the amount of ROS/RNS
produced by ionizing radiation at clinically relevant doses is ~1000 fold lower than the endogenous
ROS/RNS level routinely produced in the cell, and why a low level of endogenous RHS plays a
crucial role in phagocytosis for the immune defense. Here we propose a plausible amplification
mechanism in the immune defense: ozone‐depleting‐like halogen cyclic reactions enhancing RHS
effects are responsible for all the mentioned physiological functions, which are activated by H2O2
and deactivated by NO signaling molecule. Our results show that the reaction cycles can be repeated
thousands of times and amplify the RHS pathogen‐killing (defense) effects by 100000 fold in
phagocytosis, resembling the cyclic ozone‐depleting reactions in the stratosphere. It is unraveled
that H2O2 is a required protective signaling molecule (angel) in the defense system for human health
and its dysfunction can cause many diseases or conditions such as autoimmune disorders, aging
and cancer. We also identify a class of potent drugs for effective treatment of invading pathogens
such as HIV and SARS‐CoV‐2 (COVID‐19), cancer and other diseases, and provide a molecular
mechanism of action of the drugs or candidates.

1. Introduction
Reactive oxygen species (ROS), including superoxide (O2−), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and
hydroxyl radical (OH), are constantly produced from aerobic metabolism of the cell. It is known
that OH is potent but non‐selective oxidant, while O2− and H2O2 are far less reactive. Moreover,
increasing evidence shows that H2O2 is a necessary signaling molecule in the regulation of a variety
of biological processes such as cell proliferation and differentiation, tissue repair, immune cell

activation, circadian rhythm, vascular remodeling and aging [1‐5]. H2O2 is also a signaling molecule
of plant defense against pathogens [6].
Rising evidence has also clearly demonstrated the critical physiological role of superoxide
dismutases (SOD) in humans and all other mammals, which are the enzymes converting O2− into
H2O2) [7]. For instance, it was observed that genetic knockout of SOD produced deleterious
phenotypes in organisms ranging from bacteria to mice [8‐11]. Knockout mice lacking Mn‐SOD died
soon after birth or suffered severe neurodegeneration [8]. Mn‐SOD was also shown to be required for
protecting ROS‐induced injury in O2 metabolism [11]. Mice lacking cytosolic Cu,Zn‐SOD developed
multiple pathologies, including liver cancer [9], muscle atrophy, cataracts, and a reduced lifespan
[10]. Research on biological action of ionizing radiation (IR) also showed that modifying SOD activity
in bacteria reduced the oxygen radiosensitizing effect and that SOD injection following whole body
x‐irradiation significantly protected mice from lethality [12,13]. Also, active SOD or SOD mimic
compounds inhibited IR‐induced deleterious effects including transformation assays, bystander
effects, normal tissue damage associated with inflammatory responses and fibrosis [14,15]. These
studies clearly demonstrated that O2− was somehow participating in radiation‐induced injury,
whereas H2O2 (SOD) was required for normal physiological functions. Given that O2− is a weak
oxidant and the downstream formation of OH from H2O2 is responsible for causing oxidative
damage, the precise role of H2O2 (or O2−) in these critical physiological functions is essentially
unknown [15].
Respiratory burst is the rapid release of reactive species from different types of cells, particularly
myeloid cells (phagocytes) such as neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, mast cells, dendritic cells,
osteoclasts and eosinophils. It is usually utilised for immunological defence. Exposure to ROS or
reactive halogen species (RHS) or reactive nitrogen species (RNS) kills the engulfed pathogens, resulting
in pathology of infection. Similar ‘respiratory burst’ is found when cells are exposed to IR at a clinical
radiation dose [15] or when the ozone layer is exposed to ionizing cosmic rays in the polar
stratosphere especially in the presence of halogenated molecules (particularly freons, CFCs) [16‐19].
Phagocytosis is the process by which a cell uses its plasma membrane to engulf a pathogen,
forming an organelle called phagosome. It plays a major role in the innate immune defense by
effectively killing of pathogens. The phagosome then moves toward the centrosome of the phagocyte
and fuses with lysosomes, forming a phagolysosome for degradation of pathogens. A phagocyte has
various receptors on its surface, including opsonin receptors, scavenger receptors and Toll‐like
receptors. The widely accepted belief is that phagocytosis is most effective for killing microorganisms
(e.g., bacteria), while the adaptive immune defense, mainly by lymphocytes, is more important for viral
infections. However, increasing evidence has shown that phagocytosis plays a crucial role in killing
a variety of intracellular or cytoplasmic viruses ranging from influenza, mumps, measles and
rhinovirus to Ebola and HIV, either directly protecting against viral infections in the innate immune
defense [20‐25] or through the antibody‐dependent cellular phagocytosis providing mechanisms for
clearance of virus and virus‐infected cells and for stimulation of downstream adaptive immune
responses by antigen presentation or the secretion of inflammatory mediators [26‐28]. Particularly in
humoral (adaptive) immunity, B cells upon activation produce antibodies, each of which recognizes
a unique antigen and neutralizes a specific pathogen. The binding of antibodies to antigens makes
the latter easier targets for phagocytes and gives rise to several protective mechanisms. These include
the activation of complement to cause inflammation and cell lysis, the opsonization by coating
antigen with antibody (e.g., immunoglobulin G, IgG) or complement to enhance the phagocytosis of
pathogens through binding to the opsonin receptors of phagocytes, and antibody‐dependent cell‐
mediated cytotoxicity by attaching antibodies to targeted cells to cause the latter’s destruction by
macrophages, eosinophils, and natural killer (NK) cells. Interestingly, ROS‐regulated RHS formed by
phagocytes showed the strong viricidal effect on HIV‐1 [21, 22].
The importance of bats in the evolution of human SARS‐CoV‐2 that causes the disease COVID‐
19 has been well documented and indirectly supported by a high degree of similarity with the bat
coronavirus genomes. High levels of ROS in bats have been associated with the negative effect on the

Cells 2020, 9, x FOR PEER REVIEW

proof‐reading activity of coronavirus RNA polymerases, and it was hypothesized that coronavirus
infection in bats is mostly asymptomatic (i.e., bats maintain and disseminate deadly viruses) because
high levels of ROS can indirectly enable the bats to control the levels of viral replication [29]. The bat
genes most likely to reflect this phenomenon are those directly related to the first line of antiviral
defense—the innate immune system [29].
O2‐dependent degradation in phagocytosis depends the production of ROS, RHS and RNS, as
shown in Figure 1. First, the NADPH oxidase (NOX2) embedded in the phagolysosome membrane
is activated to produce O2− by O2 capturing an electron from cytosolic NADPH. H2O2 is generated
from O2− via superoxide dismutases (SOD) or heme(halo)peroxidases (MPO, EPO and LPO); OH is
then generated via the Haber‐Weiss reaction. Through MPO/EPO/LPO, H2O2 activates a halogenating
system, which generates hypochlorous acid (HOCl) and kills pathogens [30‐34]. The inducible nitric oxide
synthases (iNOS) also catalyze the production of NO from L‐arginine; NO then reacts with O2− to
produce a peroxynitrite (ONOO−) that forms NO2 (via reaction with CO2) [35‐37]. The last reaction
competes obviously with the SOD‐catalyzed scavenging of O2−.
All OH•, HOCl and ONOO− (NO2) are strong oxidants believed to damage DNA/RNA, lipids
and proteins, and have anti‐pathogen effects [30‐37]. Particularly HOCl has widely been used as a
strong disinfectant; HOBr and HOI at lower levels were also detected in stimulated immune cells [30‐
34]. Macrophages have weaker antiviral properties than neutrophils and their activation is made by
transient respiratory burst, which regulates the inflammatory response by inducing synthesis of
cytokines for redox signaling. Due to the high toxicity of ROS/RHS/RNS, damage to host tissues can
also occur during inflammation.

Figure 1. Respiratory burst in the immune defense against pathogens in phagocytosis. Reactive
oxygen/halogen/nitrogen species (OH•; HOX with X=Cl, Br or I; NO2) produced within the
phagosome cause damage to the DNA/RNA/lipids/proteins of phagocytosed pathogens. The formyl
peptide receptors (FPRs) stimulate the activation of the phagocytic NADPH oxidase (NOX2) to form
O2−, which is rapidly converted to H2O2 by the action of cytoplasmic or mitochondrial SOD enzymes.
Additionally, H2O2 can also be produced extracellularly by the IgG‐catalyzed oxidation of water or
by the interactions of other receptors such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptors, Toll‐like receptors
(TLRs) and Nod‐like receptors (NLRs) with pathogen‐associated ligands. The ROS are also produced
by a variety of cell types (nonphagocytic cells) and tissues, catalyzed by six other members of the
NOX family including nonphagocytic enzymes NOX1, NOX3, NOX4, NOX5, and the dual oxidases
Duox1 and Duox2. The activation of these NOX are stimulated by growth factors, cytokines, and

integrins. NOX5 and Duox1 and Duox2 are activated by Ca2+ through a cytoplasmic calcium‐binding
domain. H2O2 and NO can diffuse freely across membranes as indicated by the arrows.

Of particular interest is the role of endogenous RHS in the O2‐dependent killing mechanisms of
invading pathogens in phagosomes. It is worthy of mention that HOXs (X=Cl, Br) are also important
halogen species causing O3 depletion in the Earth’s stratosphere [38,39]. They are derived from solar
photolysis [40] or cosmic‐ray driven dissociative‐electron‐transfer (DET) reactions [16‐19] of
halogenated organic molecules, especially CFCs. In radiobiology, there is also a long mystery that the
amount of primary ROS produced by IR at clinically relevant radiation doses (2Gy) is ~1000 fold lower than
the background (endogenous) ROS level produced by oxidative metabolism of the cell, as first noted by Ward
[41]. This leads to the question of how the ROS produced by the few primary ionization events is
amplified to account for observed biological effects. The mechanism remains elusive, as recently reviewed
[15]. This vividly reminds the hypothesis of significant CFC‐induced ozone loss in the Earth’s
stratosphere by atmospheric scientists in the 1970s, giving birth of modern ozone depletion theory. It
is now well established that there is an amplifying mechanism where a Cl atom catalytically destroys
up to 100000 ozone molecules via halogen reaction cycles [38,39]. Note that during respiratory burst,
the increases in O2 (not NO) consumption were typically observed to be only 2‐20 fold among
different cells and/or conditions [42]. This, together with the mysterious critical physiological role of H2O2,
implies that a drastic amplification mechanism is clearly required.
2. Theoretical Studies
2.1. Halogen Cyclic Reactions
Here we hypothesize that (i) the initial yields of endogenous ROS/RHS/RNS produced in the
phagosome are not sufficient to cause a significant anti‐pathogen effect in the immune defense, for
which an amplification mechanism is required; (ii) The O3‐depleting‐like reaction cycles of RHS take
place in the phagosome for immunological defences in cells of humans and all other mammals, via
enzymes such as hemeperoxidases or other antioxidant enzymes, instead of solar photons or cosmic
rays; (iii) Similar to the formation of polar O3 hole, numerous reaction cycles of RHS (mainly X, XO,
HOX, OX−, X2; X=Cl or Br or I) play a major role in killing pathogens and immunological defences.
These are schematically shown in Figure 2.
In biological systems, the halogenation of organic molecules is catalyzed by enzymes
haloperoxidases such as MPO, EPO and LPO in normal physiological processes, which combine the
inorganic substrates X− and H2O2 to produce RHS. RHS in turn oxidize the hydro‐carbon or ‐nitrogen
substrate RH/RNH to synthesize many halogenated organic compounds (RX/RNX):
Biosynthesis: X− + H2O2 → HOX/OX−/OX/X2 → RX/RNX
DET reaction: RX/RNX + e− → RX−/RNX− → (X + R−/RN−) or (X− + R/RN)

(1)
(2)

By reaction (1), many halogenated organic compounds are biosynthesized [32,34,43, 44]. It is also well
known that halogenated RX/RNX are highly effective for DET reactions that result in anions
R−/RN−/X− or reactive radicals X/OX/R/RN, as expressed in reaction (2) [15‐19, 45‐51]. As shown in
Table 1, all of these RHS have been found in biological systems especially phagosomes [30‐34,43,
44,52‐54]. One should be cautious with some reaction rate constants listed in Table 1 as they are
somewhat outdated. For example, most experiments by nanosecond‐ or picosecond‐resolved
radiolysis of aqueous halogenated molecules actually measured the DET with the hydrated electron
(eaq−) rather than the subpicosecond‐lived prehydrated electron (epre−). eaq− is deeply bound at ~3.5 eV
and is relatively inert, while epre− has a small binding energy of 1.0‐1.5 eV and is extremely effective
for DET with halogenated molecules, as well demonstrated and reviewed previously [49‐
51,55,56,18,19].

Figure 2. Proposed halogen reaction cycles involved in the immune defense against pathogens and in
the inflammatory process. The amplified reactions of reactive halogen species (RHS), including HOX,
OX−, X2, X• and OX• (X=Cl, Br or I), produced by dissociative electron transfer (DET) within the
phagosome cause major damage (represented by RX/RNX) to the DNA/RNA/lipids/proteins of
phagocytosed pathogens. The immune defence system consists mainly of three components: the H2O2
signaling pathway as the trigger, the RHS reaction cycles as the amplifier, and the NO• signaling
pathway as the terminator. H2O2 from other intracellular organelles such as mitochondria and
peroxisomes can also diffuse across membranes and promote the anti‐pathogen activity.

Reactions (1) and (2) lay a solid foundation for halogen cyclic reactions to be presented below.
Notably, the standard reduction potentials at pH 7 of all redox couples (Compound I/native enzyme,
H2O) of enzymes MPO/EPO/LPO abundant in phagosomes are relatively small, being 1.09‐1.16 V [31,
32]. Similarly, the standard reduction potentials at pH 7 of the redox couple (HOX/X–, H2O) for two‐
electron oxidation of halides are 0.78, 1.13 and 1.28 V for X=I, Br and Cl, respectively [31, 32].
Moreover, the exothermic energies for the DET reaction in water of halogenated organic compounds
such as RNX is EA(X)‐D(N‐X)+Ep [45,46,49‐51], where EA(X) is the electron affinity of a X atom
[EA(Cl)=3.61 eV; EA(Br)=3.36 eV; EA(I)=3.06 eV] or the neutral radical RN• [EA(RN)=~3.46 eV] [57],
D(N‐X) is the known bond dissociation energy of N‐X [D(N‐Cl)=2.08 eV; D(N‐Br)=2.50 eV; D(N‐
I)=1.65 eV], and Ep ≈1.30 eV [49,50] (1.25‐1.50 eV) [58] is the polarization energy of an anon in water.
The thus calculated exothermicities for the DET reactions of RNX to form a RN• and a X– (or a RN–
and a X•) are 2.83 (or 2.68), 2.16 (or 2.26) and 2.71 (or 3.11) eV for X=Cl, Br and I, respectively,

Cells 2020, 9, x FOR PEER REVIEW

significantly larger than the reduction energies of the redox couples (Compound I/native enzyme,
H2O) of enzymes MPO/EPO/LPO. For X=Cl, the DET of RNX favors the dissociation pathway to form
RN• (and X–), whereas it preferentially leads to the production of X• (and RN–) for X=Br and I. These
estimates indicate that the catalyzed cyclic reactions of RHS must effectively take place and sustain for
numerous cycles in phagosomes with those endogenous electron‐donating enzymes replacing solar
photons or cosmic‐ray‐produced electrons. This is analogous to the established O3 depleting cyclic
reactions. For example, X and HOX with X=Cl, Br, or I can have the following cyclic reactions (bold

Note that cycle 1 (reactions 3a‐3b and 3d‐3f, or reactions 4a‐4b and 4d‐4f) depends on H2O2,
whereas cycle 2 (reactions 3a‐3c and 3g‐3j, or reactions 4a‐4c and 4g‐4j) is H2O2 independent due to
the DET of RN1X into a X atom. The net effects of both reaction cycles are the alternations (damages)
to at least two biological targets R1NH and R2NH with no halogen consumption. Similar reaction cycles
can occur for other RHS such as XO and X2. They are most effective (i.e., cycle 2 occurs), if the X
atom is yielded, which was indeed observed for radiolysis of N‐bromoimides but not for N‐
chloroimides [52,53]. Cycle 2 will be more significant with the formation of X2 in reaction (1) (as X2 +
e−  X + X− readily), and therefore will become dominant as the halogen level reaches above a

Cells 2020, 9, x FOR PEER REVIEW

threshold. Indeed, HOX was also observed to be in equilibrium with X2 or BrCl in the MPO‐H2O2‐
halide system under acidic conditions in the presence of excess X−, as in phagosomes [31,32,43,44].
Cycles 1 and 2 are expected to continue for numerous cycles before they are terminated. Note that
the peroxidase cycle [30‐34] in catalyzing the reaction (X− + H2O2  HOX + H2O), and the radical
chain [52,53] in radiolysis of N‐halogenated species (R + Br2  RBr + Br; Br + RH  H+ + Br− + R.
Net: Br2 + RH  RBr + Br− + H+) as originally suggested by Goldfinger et al [59], have been proposed
previously to enhance the reaction efficiency, but each of those reaction cycles occurs at the
consumption of a halogen species. They are therefore distinct from the O3‐depleting‐like DET‐based
halogen reaction cycles proposed here that have no cost of halogens (acting as ‘catalysts’). Then a
question arises: how would the halogen reaction cycles be terminated?
In atmospheric photochemistry of ozone loss, RHS is removed from the catalytic cycles once the
reaction ends with HX or XONO2 (“inactive reservoirs”) [38,39]. In the phagosome (cell), however,
this would not be the case as aqueous HCl can readily react with OH/HOX to form X/X2 and the
hydrolysis of XONO2 will quickly occur to form XO and NO2. It is worth noting that the above proposed
cyclic reactions are essentially enzyme‐driven electron‐transfer reactions. Peroxynitrite has a half life of
1.9 s at pH 7.4 and its decomposition leads to a major product nitrate (NO3−) and a minor product of
CO3− or NO2 with/without reaction with CO2 [35,36]:
O2− + NO  ONOO− + H+  ONOOH  OH + NO2 (30% yield)

−
O2 + NO  ONOO + CO2  ONOOCO2−  NO2 + CO3− (35% yield)
 NO3− + CO2 (65%)

(5a)
(5b)
(5c)
(5d)

Since the redox potential of NO2 is close to that OH, ONOO− is believed to act as an OH‐like
oxidizing species in causing damaging effects [35,36]. Notably, NO3− is known to be an extremely
effective scavenger for weakly‐bound electrons (NO3 has an electron affinity of 3.94 eV, larger than
any halogen) [50,55,56], with the measured reaction rate constant of as large as 1.2(±0.5)×1013 M−1s−1
[56]. Reaction of CO3− with electrons or O2− is also expected (see Table 1). Thus, the halogen reaction
cycles would be terminated if there is a significant amount of NO3− or CO3− (mainly NO3−) in the
phagosome. Remarkably, the reduction or removal of nitrogen species (HNO3 as the ultimate product) is a
critical requirement for the formation of the ozone hole (significant ozone loss) in the polar stratosphere [38,39].
It follows that our proposed immune defence system fighting against pathogens is composed of
three components: the H2O2 signaling pathway is the activator (‘trigger’), the RHS reaction cycles the
accelerator (‘amplifier’), and the NO signaling pathway (NO3−) the deactivator (‘terminator’) of RHS
reactions, as shown in Figure 2. The delicate balance between the two regulations, by H2O2 and NO,
is responsible for immunity that allows multicellular organisms to have adequate biological defenses
to fight infection, disease, or other unwanted biological invasion, while having adequate tolerance to
avoid allergy and autoimmune diseases/disorders. Note that as stable and small neutral signaling
molecules that can diffuse easily across the membrane, both H2O2 and NO from other cellular
organelles such as peroxisomes and mitochondria can also involve in the defense system [60].
2.2. Halogen Cyclic Reaction Rates
It is striking to find the close similarity between the negative ion chemistry in the undisturbed
stratosphere and troposphere of the Earth and that in phagosomes of the cell, as shown in Figure 3.
Both are quite similar, involving identical species of O2−, CO2, NO, NO2, and ONOO− [61,62,19],
except that O3 is far more abundant in the stratosphere though its presence in phagosomes was also
arguably observed [32]. For negative ion chemistry in the atmosphere, the primary ions are quickly
converted into CO3−(H2O)n ions on the order of 10−3 s by a series of reactions with O2, CO2, O3 and H2O
[61,62]. In the stratosphere, the CO3−(H2O)n ions are converted relatively slowly into the more stable
ions NO3−(H2O)n or NO3−(HNO3)m(H2O)n on the order of 1s by reaction with the trace gases NO, NO2,
HNO3, and N2O5 [61,62]. For altitudes below 30 km, the hydrated NO3− ions are the dominant and

terminal species. The positive‐ion chemistry is even simpler and the cluster ions H3O+(H2O)n (n=3‐6)
are the sole primary ions since their formation is also rapid (10−3 s). This is much shorter than the
(positive) ion‐ (negative) ion recombination lifetime (i.e., the residence time of ions) of approximately
100‐1000 s in the atmosphere [62].

Figure 3. Schematic representations of the negative ion chemistry in the undisturbed stratosphere and
troposphere of the Earth [61,62] and in the phagolysosome in the innate immune defense system in
humans.

Looking into the rate constants in Table 1 and reactant abundances of all the cyclic reactions (1‐
5), we can see that reaction (1) or (3f) or (4f) is the rate‐determining step, that is, the haloperoxidase
catalyzed converting reaction of X− and H2O2 into HOX is the rate‐limiting reaction. We further notice
that H2O2 is stable, while the lifetime of negative ions including Cl−/Br−/I− and NO3− is controlled by
the recombination time with the abundant hydronium ions H3O+(H2O)n (protons) in the acidic
phagolysosome, which are long‐lived, in contrast to hydronium in neutral solutions. It was indeed
observed that the increase in IR‐stimulated ROS/RNS generation persisted for 2–5 min post‐
irradiation in most cell lines and for ~15 min after irradiation in some cell lines [63]. Thus, the reaction
period of RHS in the phagolysosome seems approximately 100‐1000s, identical to that is the lower
atmosphere. Given the Cl− and Br− concentrations in phagocytes are 120 mM (median) and 60 μM
(median) [54] and the rate constants of 2.6×104‐3.9×106 M–1 s–1 and 3.0×107‐1.1×108 M–1 s–1 for the
converting reactions with H2O2 at pH 5.0 respectively [64,65], we calculate that the overall Cl and Br
cyclic reactions occur with respective rates of approximately 3120‐4.68×105 s–1 and 1800‐6600 s–1. These
give rise to at least 3.1×105‐4.7×107 and 1.8×105‐6.6×105 reaction cycles during the lifetime (≥100 s) of
Cl− and Br− in the phagolysosome respectively. These estimated values are fairly close to the ozone
depleting reaction cycles in the atmosphere [38]. These appear quite surprizing, but they are actually
mainly determined by the levels of Cl− and Br− and the ion residence time. The latter is governed by
the recombination with H3O+(H2O)n [61,62], resulting in the apparently identical ion lifetime in both
the stratosphere and the phagolysosome.
It must be noted that although the proposal of halogen reaction cycles in phagocytosis appears
striking and novel, each of the reactions (1‐5) is very well‐established in the literature [15‐19, 43‐51].
Given the abundances and low reduction potentials [31, 32] of endogenous haloperoxidases

(MPO/EPO/LPO) in phagosomes and the high resemblance [61,62,19] of the negative ion chemistry
in phagosome to that in the atmosphere, there is every reason to deduce that the reaction cycles can
be repeated thousands of times and amplify the RHS pathogen‐killing (defense) effects by ~105 fold,
analogous to the cyclic ozone‐depleting reactions [38]. For the latter, RHS is known to be far more
efficient than OH and NO at catalyzing the destruction of ozone, and among RHS, Br or I is much
more efficient than Cl at catalyzing the cyclic reactions [18,19,38,39,45,46,49,50]

This proposed mechanism has multifold significance:
The H2O2‐initiated halogen cyclic reactions should greatly amplify the pathogen‐killing effects of
RHS in phagocytosis for innate and adaptive immune defenses. The proposed mechanism might
lead to discoveries of highly effective antiviral drugs for effective treatment of various viruses
such as HIV and COVID‐19.
It also provides a long‐sought amplification mechanism for reactive radicals produced by IR to
generate the clinically required radiobiological effects in human body, as compared with
background ROS.
It reveals that H2O2 as a signaling molecule plays the key protective (pathogen‐killing) role in
immunological defenses in many organisms from plants and animals to humans.
It also unravels the crucial physiological role of H2O2 to account for the observed critical effect of
enzymes SOD [8‐15]. Once the SOD was impaired, the dysfunction of H2O2 as the protective
molecule in the immune system resulted in and the animals died quickly.

2.4. Implications for the Pathology of COVID‐19
If people infected by an acute pathogen like SARS‐CoV‐2 that causes COVID‐19 show mild and
moderate symptoms and receive no or improper treatment, they might rapidly develop into severe cases
of extreme respiratory burst. In the latter case, the halogen cyclic killing reactions may result in
dysfunctions or disorders of closely interacting and communicating cell organelles, such as
peroxisomes, mitochondria and lysosomes, and even severe damage to the host cells and tissues
during autoimmune (over inflammation), by analogy with the severe springtime Antarctic ozone
hole. The over toxicity caused by amplified RHS reactions is expected to result in unrepairable
damage or mutations to cellular components, and the signaling pathways of H2O2 and NO may be
impaired as well. Disorders in these organelles can cause serious damage to multiple organs such
as lung, heart, liver, kidney and nervous systems, and respiratory failure, septic shock, multi‐organ
failure, or even deaths. The best treatment should be in early or moderate stage or prevention.
3. Halogenated Aromatic Drugs as Repurposed Drugs
Given our new understanding of the pathology of invading pathogens described above, we now
discuss potential treatment of the severe virus COVID‐19. Exogenous halogenated aromatic ring
compounds as neutral small molecules that can freely diffuse across membrane will be potent anti‐
pathogen agents. Here we present a new molecular mechanism of action (MOA) of a class of halogenated
aromatic drugs such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), which have been a current
focus for experimental treatment of COVID‐19 [66‐68] and more potent di‐amino, di‐halogen
aromatic ring molecules [termed femtomedicine compounds, FMDs], which have exhibited excellent
targeted chemotherapy of multiple cancers [69‐71]. These drugs or candidates are promising for effective
treatments of COVID‐19, cancer and other diseases.
For the MOA of HCQ and chloroquine, the readers are referred to a recent review [72]. As noted
by the reviewers, most of the MOAs to explain the therapeutic and/or adverse effects were
hypothesized based on in vitro studies, and the link between the proposed MOAs and the clinical
efficacy and in vivo safety is yet to establish. The proposed molecular MOA of HCQ during
autoimmunity include the following processes. Pharmacodynamic studies showed that these

Cells 2020, 9, x FOR PEER REVIEW

10 of 17

antimalarial drugs are lipophilic weak bases, easily cross plasma membranes, and preferentially
accumulate in lysosomes, causing increases in the pH of lysosomes from 4 to 6 [73]. Elevation in pH
causes inhibition of lysosomal activity including diminished proteolysis effect [74], decreased
intracellular processing, glycosylation and secretion of proteins with many consequences [75]. These
effects are believed to cause a decreased immune cell functioning such as chemotaxis, phagocytosis
and O2− production by neutrophils [76].
Another proposed MOA was that HCQ inhibits Toll‐like receptor (TLR) signaling. This
speculation might be traced back to a review [77]. The authors reviewed potent antiviral and
antitumor properties of several imidazoquinolines as nucleic acid analogs, for which TLR7 was
suggested to sense viral infection. Also, their unpublished data showed that two other
immunomodulators, loxoribine and bropirimine, also activated immune cells through TLR7.
Bropirimine (2‐amin‐5‐bromo‐6‐phenyl‐4(3)‐pyrimidinone) is an immunomodulator that induces
production of cytokines including IFN‐α. There has been interest in searching TLR‐activating agents
for clinical use. Takeda et al [77] predicted that new therapies utilizing the TLR‐mediated innate
immune activation would be developed to treat several disorders such as infection, cancer, and
allergy. Because of some structural similarity to these imidazoquinolines, there have been
speculations that TLR7 and TLR9 receptors involve in the MOA of HCQ.
Overall, available data suggest that HCQ and chloroquine impair or inhibit lysosomal and
phagolysosome functions and subsequently immune activation. There are current efforts to identify
exact molecular targets of HCQ within the lysosome, but convincing results and the identification of
other molecular targets within the lysosomes have not yet reached. The precise molecular mechanisms
of anti‐pathogen effects these drugs remain essentially unknown [72].
3.1. New Molecular Mechanism of Action (MOA) of Halogenated Aromatic Drugs
Here we propose a new molecular MOA of halogen‐containing aromatic ring drugs represented
by AXs, including HCQ and chloroquine, and a family of FMD halogenated compounds [69‐71]. Here
A is a quine ring system and X=Cl for HCQ and chloroquine, whereas A is an aromatic ring coupled
to two NH2 groups at ortho positions [A=B(NH2)2] and X=Cln or Brn or In with n=1,2 for FMD
compounds such as 4,5‐dichloro/dibromo/diiodo‐1,2‐diaminobenzene and 4(5)‐chloro/bromo/iodo‐
1,2‐diaminobenzene [69,70]. We propose that these molecules are highly effective for DET reactions
and their action is quite similar to the formation of endogenous RHS in the phagosome. It is long
known that the DET reactions of halogenated aromatic organic molecules AXs with weakly‐bound
electrons in water are highly effective [18,19,45‐51]. The exothermic energy for the DET reaction in
water is EA(X)‐D(A‐X)+Ep [18,19,45‐51], where EA(X) and Ep are defined earlier and D(A‐X) is the
known bond dissociation energy of C‐X [D(C‐Cl)=3.43 eV; D(C‐Br)=2.81eV; D(C‐I)=2.50 eV]. The thus
estimated exothermic energies for the DET reactions of AXs to form A and X (or A and X) are 1.48
(or 1.37), 1.85(or 1.99) and 1.86(or 2.3) eV, respectively for X=Cl, Br and I. These exothermicities are
significantly larger than the reduction energies (1.09‐1.16 eV) [31,32] of the redox couples (Compound
I/native enzyme, H2O) of enzymes MPO, EPO and LPO, indicating that the DET reactions of AXs
must effectively take place in phagosomes, as shown in Figure 4. Again, the formation of Br• or I•
atom (and A) is the favorable DET pathway for brominated and iodized AXs, in contrast to that for
the DET of chlorinated AXs that favors the formation of Cl (and A).
Thus, similar to the DET reactions of endogenous halogenated organic compounds, effective
DET reactions of AXs must occur with the enzymes such as MPO/EPO/LPO/SOD or NADPH which
are weakly‐bound electron donors:
e + AX  AX  (A + X) or (A + X)

(6)

In addition, DET reactions of AXs with O2 can also occur with or without the involvement of
enzymes in the phagolysosome [78]:
AX + O2−  (AO2• + X−) or (AO2− + X•)

Figure 4. Schematic diagram for the dissociative electron transfer (DET) reaction [18,19,49,50] of a
halogenated aromatic ring molecule AX with a weakly‐bound electron (ewb−) in phagosomes, where
ewb− is readily donated from a variety of enzymes or antioxidants or O2. For HCQ and chloroquine,
A is a quine ring system and X=Cl, whereas A is an aromatic ring coupled to two NH2 groups at ortho
positions [A=B(NH2)2] and X=Cln or Brn or In with n=1,2 for FMD compounds) [69,70].

Correspondingly, the halogen atom radicals X have particularly effective reaction cycles 2 to
amplify the biological effects. The formed reactive radical AO2 can also directly cause damaging
effects, e.g., by hydrogen abstraction from DNA/RNA, lipids or proteins, while X− like endogenous
halogen ions can be converted into HOX, OX, X and X2 via the enzymes MPO/EPO/LPO. Like
endogenous HOCl/HOBr/HOI, these exogenous RHS will have the amplifying cyclic reactions and
cause significant anti‐pathogen effects for immunological defence.
3.2. Potential New Therapeutics
As observed for HCQ, these neutral small‐molecule AXs including FMD compounds can easily
cross plasma membranes to accumulate in lysosomes. We propose that the MOA of these halogenated
drugs or candidates should be due to the enhanced (rather than inhibited) pathogen‐killing effect
induced by the reaction cycles of RHS derived from the DET of the compounds. Indeed, the DET
reaction of HCQ will lead to an increase in the Cl yield, equivalent to a rise in pH in lysosomes, consistent
with the observation for HCQ. When there are invading pathogens in early or intermediate stages,
pathogens are effectively killed in the formed phagolysosomes with excess RHS before autoimmune
occurs. Since the DET reaction efficiencies are expected to increase in the order of Cl<Br<I for X in
AXs [45,46,49,50], as we already observed for halopyrimidines (CldU, BrdU, IdU) [49,50], and more
critically the DET reactions of Br‐ and I‐containing aromatic ring molecules preferably produce Br or
I atoms to activate cycle 2 reactions, the in vivo therapeutic efficacy should increase in the order of
ACln<<ABrn<AIn (n=1,2).
As for anti‐cancer activity of AXs, similar RHS are expected to be generated and to cause
apoptosis and cancer cell killing. Moreover, since both H2O2 and NO are neutral small signaling
molecules that can diffuse freely across the membrane and have high mobility, similar reaction cycles
of RHS are expected to take place in other intracellular organelles such as mitochondria and
peroxisomes which are electron (antioxidant)‐rich. Indeed, recent in vitro and in vivo experimental
results of multiple cancers have confirmed that the anti‐tumor efficacies of the FMD compounds
increases in the order of ACl2<<ABr2<AI2 [69,70]. Moreover, our unpublished data [79] by direct, real‐

time femtosecond laser spectroscopic measurements have confirmed the highly effective DET
reactions of the FMD compounds.
Notably, the FMD compounds distinguish themselves from other drugs such as HCQ and
chloroquine, bropirimine, BrdU and IdU, not only by yielding highly reactive Br or I atoms to
initiate the powerful H2O2‐independent reaction cycles but by a unique structural characteristic that
contains two NH2 groups attached to the ring system at ortho positions. This idea is based on a previous
finding by Lu and Madey [16,47] that the presence of ammonia can cause giant enhancements in the
DET reaction efficacies of CFCs adsorbed on ice surfaces by up to 30000 times, which was
subsequently confirmed by Stähler et al. [51]. Although in vivo DET efficiencies may not be enhanced
to this extent, there is every reason to expect that the DET reactions of the FMD compounds should
be at least 10 times more effective than any other halogenated organic molecules without the two
neighboring NH2 groups in their structures. This was indeed observed by comparing the DET
reactions of FMDs with BrdU and IdU [79]. BrdU is very similar to bropirimine in structure [77].
Thus, we predict that the in vivo anti‐pathogen effectiveness of FMD compounds with proper formulations
will be at least 10 times higher than that of any of HCQ, chloroquine, bropirimine, BrdU and IdU.
Of particular interesting is also the finding that in treated normal cells, a FMD compound at 100
M caused an increase by about 40% of the reduced glutathione (GSH) level, which is an endogenous
protective antioxidant [15,32], whereas the GSH level in human cervical (ME‐180) cancer cells
significantly dropped upon treated by the FMD and decreased to ~35% at 100 M FMD [69]. This
marked selective depletion of the GSH was consistent with the proposed preferential DET reaction
to activate in cancer cells and with the observed selective cytotoxic effects of FMDs in vitro and in
vivo [69‐71]. These results showed that FMDs even have a protective effect on normal cells while killing
abnormal cells and can be used as targeted chemotherapeutic agents [69,70].
Although no tests on antiviral activity of FMD compounds have been performed, our new
studies on animal cancer models have shown that FMDs such as 4,5‐dibromo‐1,2‐diaminobenzene
and 4,5‐diiodo‐1,2‐diaminobenzene at doses of ≤35 mg/kg (i.p) showed a superior efficacy in anti‐
cancer activity (leading to significant tumor shrinkage) to the clinical drugs such as cisplatin and
gemcitabine at doses that showed significant toxic side effects. In contrast, the maximum tolerated
dose (MTD) of 4,5‐dibromo‐1,2‐diaminobenzene was measured to be 22020 mg/kg (i.p), and no
significant multiple dose toxicity in blood, liver, kidney, gut and spleen for 90 mg/kg/week for 4
weeks in mice (i.v) were observed. The oral MTD, which is usually at least 5 times higher, may be
over 1000 mg/kg. These results indicate that FMDs are essentially non‐toxic but highly effective
chemotherapeutic agents at used doses that can preferentially kill abnormal cells. It is therefore useful for
natural targeted chemotherapy of cancer and other diseases, which potentially include viral
infections and autoimmune disorders. By contrast, due to the increased risk of developing
retinopathy during treatment with HCQ, the current ophthalmology guidelines recommend a
maximal daily dose of 5.0 mg/kg (actual body weight) per day for HCQ, while in cancer studies, high
HCQ doses up to 1,200 mg (17‐18 mg/kg) daily was prescribed [72,80]. Given these data, FMD
compounds are estimated to have a clinical safe dose at least 10 times higher than HCQ in humans. Thus,
FMDs at a wide non‐toxic dose range have high potential to outperform existing drugs such as chloroquine and
HCQ that have known toxic side effects.
Caly et al. [81] reported that the FDA‐approved ivermectin, a protease inhibitor for the treatment
of parasitic infections and for the replication of HIV and Dengue viruses, inhibits replication of SARS‐
CoV‐2 in vitro, making it a possible candidate for COVID‐19 drug repurposing research.
Interestingly, pharmacological studies showed that the drug binds to glutamate‐gated chloride
channels (GluCls, present in neurons and myocytes) in the membranes of invertebrate nerve and
muscle cells, causing increased permeability to Cl− ions, resulting in cellular hyper‐polarization,
followed by paralysis and death. The pathology proposed in this paper can well explain the MOA of
this drug: the increased Cl− permeability will elevate the Cl− level and the associated RHS cyclic
reactions to enhance the pathogen‐killing effects.

Also, emerging studies to understand the pathogenesis of SARS‐CoV‐2 have just been published
[82,83]. By analyzing human, non‐human primate, and mouse single‐cell RNA‐sequencing (scRNA‐
seq) datasets and identifying ACE2 and TMPRSS2 co‐expressing cells in lung type II pneumocytes,
ileal absorptive enterocytes, and nasal goblet secretory cells, Ziegler et al [82] showed that ACE2 is
enhanced in human nasal epithelia and lung tissue by interferon and influenza but not upregulated in
mice. They proposed that SARS‐CoV‐2 could exploit species‐specific interferon‐driven upregulation
of ACE2, a tissue‐protective mediator during lung injury, to enhance infection. In contrast, by analysis
of the transcriptional response to SARS‐CoV‐2 compared with other respiratory viruses, Blanco‐Melo
et al [83] found that cell and animal models of SARS‐CoV‐2 infections, as well as transcriptional and
serum profiling of COVID‐19 patients, consistently showed a unique and inappropriate
inflammatory response, which was defined by low levels of Type I and III interferons juxtaposed to
elevated chemokines and high expression of IL‐6. The latter study therefore suggested that the deficit
in innate antiviral defenses coupled with abundant inflammatory cytokine production is the defining
and driving feature of COVID‐19. It seems that a consistent pathogenesis of COVID‐19 has not yet
emerged. Further studies are obviously needed.
4. Recommendation for Experimental Treatment of COVID‐19
Provided with the pathology of infection and molecular MOA of drugs proposed in this paper,
drugs (candidates) like HCQ and FMDs will enhance rather than inhibit the endogenous pathogen‐
killing effect in the immune system in humans. These halogenated aromatic drugs or candidates should be
encouraged and recommended for experimental treatment of COVID‐19, especially for preventive, mild and
moderate stages, and probably treatment of developed chronic conditions. In these applications, the
halogen compounds should provide strong pathogen‐killing effects. During autoimmune disorders,
however, precaution should be taken if these drugs are to be used, because they will produce an
excess number of exogenous RHS, much larger than that of endogenous RHS. In the latter case, using
a NO (iNOS) inducer to enhance the production of the electron killer (NO3−/CO3−) neutralizing RHS
might be helpful to the patients. This paper provides a plausible molecular mechanism that might
help the clinical practice of the drugs. It may improve the clinical efficacy, control the toxicity within
a tolerated range, and suggest the optimal timing/sequential administration or possible combination
therapy. This might meet the current medical challenges faced in this global pandemic and save many
lives across the globe. Furthermore, this research also reveals that H2O2 is a necessary signaling molecules
(angel) in the defense system fighting against pathogens and maintaining normal physiological functioning
and signaling and its dysfunction can cause many diseases of organisms ranging from plants to humans. The
role of phagocytosis in both innate and adaptive immune defenses is probably underestimated under
current context of immunology and virology. The new mechanistic insights into the immune defense
might lead to discovery and development of more potent and/or targeted drugs for treatment of
many diseases or conditions such as viral infections such as HIV and SARS‐COV‐2 (COVID‐19), aging
and cancer.
