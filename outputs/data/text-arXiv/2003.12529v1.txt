Abstract
Here, in an effort towards facile and fast screening/diagnosis of novel coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19), we combined the unprecedently sensitive graphene fieldeffect transistor (Gr-FET) with highly selective antibody-antigen interaction to develop
a coronavirus immunosensor. The Gr-FET immunosensors can rapidly identify (about
2 mins) and accurately capture the COVID-19 spike protein S1 (which contains a
receptor binding domain, RBD) at a limit of detection down to 0.2 pM, in a real-time
and label-free manner. Further results ensure that the Gr-FET immunosensors can be
promisingly applied to screen for high-affinity antibodies (with binding constant up to
2×1011 M-1 against the RBD) at concentrations down to 0.1 pM. Thus, our developed
electrical Gr-FET immunosensors provide an appealing alternative to address the early
screening/diagnosis as well as the analysis and rational design of neutralizing-antibody
locking methods of this ongoing public health crisis.

Rapid and accurate identification/characterization of a potential pathogen is crucial for
disease control, patient treatment and prevention of epidemic of emerging infectious
diseases, such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-COV),
which has incurred pandemics of respiratory infectious diseases with high mortality.
Recently, another emerging coronavirus that can cause viral pneumonia (COVID-19)
is outbreak in Wuhan, China and has propagated across the entire China. Meanwhile it
has already shown great potential to have globe spread and thread to the worldwide
public health.1, 2 To date, nucleic acid-based molecular diagnostic tests based on the
reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR),3 have been established and
widely adopted to identify this COVID-19. However, these detection methods require
sophisticated primer and probe design, multi-step reactions, many reagents, trained
personnel and bulky instruments. Moreover, it is impossible or inaccurate to detect
infected but recovered people or asymptomatic carriers. In this respect, simple and costefficient protein-based immunosensor with high sensitivity is of vital importance when
pestilential blast.
Graphene field-effect transistors (Gr-FET) are very attractive for the development
of immunosensors due to their unprecedented sensitivity and chemical stability with
proved capability for label-free digital biomolecules detection.4-6 Compared to optical
based

immunoassays

including

fluorescence-linked

and/or

enzyme-linked

immunosorbent assay (FLISA and/or ELISA) technology, Gr-FET biosensors eliminate
the complicated procedure for fluorescence or enzyme labeling and do not require bulky
and expensive optical instruments. Thus, facile Gr-FET biosensors with high sensitivity
hold great potential for rapid diagnosis and early risk prediction of infectious diseases,
which often present low copy numbers in vivo pathogen. In the case of coronaviruses,
it has been reported that its spike (S) glycoprotein plays an extremely important role in

3

recognizing the cell surface receptor, which is essential for both host specificity and
viral infectivity. Further studies confirms that COVID-19 infects the human respiratory
epithelial cells through the S1 subunit protein, which mainly contains a receptor binding
domain (RBD) interacting with the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).7
Moreover, the S protein also plays key parts in the induction of neutralizing-antibody
and T-cell responses, as well as protective immunity.8
Here, to enable digital detection of the virion attachment protein of coronaviruses
for fast screening/diagnosis, we combined the extremely sensitive Gr-FET with highly
selective SARS-COV spike S1 subunit protein antibody (CSAb) - COVID-19 spike S1
subunit protein (which contains the RBD) antigen interaction to develop an
immunosensor. Strikingly, CSAb modified Gr-FET is capable of real-time detecting S1
at a limit of detection (LOM) down to 0.2 pM concentration with a fast responding time
within 2 mins. Moreover, our results indicate that CSAb modified Gr-FET possesses a
higher sensitivity than its counterpart with ACE2 receptors, which can be attributed to
the higher bonding affinity of CSAb to S1 (K=2×1011 M-1) compared to that of ACE2
(K=109 M-1). Thus, along with the capability of utilizing S1 modified Gr-FET to
screening antibodies, we expand the potential utility of Gr-FET for rapid
screening/diagnosis of respiratory infections caused by coronaviruses and its fast drug
screening.
We started with high-quality monolayer single crystal graphene synthesized on
single crystal Cu(111) foils by a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method (Fig. S1),9
and fabricated high-performance, solution-compatible Gr-FETs following an “upsidedown” process described previously.10 Figure 1a depicts the schematics of Gr-FET for
coronaviruses diagnosis, where graphene surface was specifically functionalized with
either CSAb or ACE2 receptor to bind the S1 subunit protein from COVID-19. The
4

hybridization of the slightly positively charged S1 protein with CSAb/ACE2 receptors
immobilized on the graphene surface, alters its conductance/resistance via field effect,
which can be electrically read out. We note here that we applied a reference electrode
in constant contact with the antigen buffer solution to fix its electrostatic potential (Vref)
during antibody-antigen reaction, and to control the current flow in the graphene
channel between the source and the drain electrodes. As CSAb is positively charged,
while ACE2 is negatively charged in PBS buffer solution (pH=7.2), we applied a
negative or a positive potential at graphene during the incubation process, respectively,
to improve their immobilization on the sensor surface.
Figure 1b plots the sheet conductance (G) of graphene measured at a constant
current source Ids ~ 1 μA when sweeping the liquid-gate voltage Vref ranging from −0.5
to 0.3 V. The transfer characteristics gives the liquid-gate voltage of a bare Gr-FET
device at the charge neutrality point (CNP, also called Dirac point) VDirac=-90 mV,
where the total charge carrier number is minimal. Initial field-effect carrier mobilities
can be deduced as 1017 cm2 V-1 for hole and 1215 cm2 V-1 for electron. 30 minincubation of CSAb results in a shift of the Dirac point ΔVDirac=-50 mV towards
negative direction (red dots, Fig. 1b), which can be attributed to the positive charges
carried by the immobilized antibodies. To confirm the adhesion of the self-assembly
CSAb on graphene surface, in another Gr-FET sample we treated the CSAb
immobilized sensor surface with tween 20 (T20), a surfactant with known
blocking/passivation effect on graphene surface. We observed negligible change in the
transfer characteristics before and after T20 passivation for 30 mins (Fig. S2),
suggesting its good adhesion and tight surface coverage via hydrophobic and
electrostatic interactions during its self-assembly on graphene surface.

Figure 1. Protein functionalized Gr-FET immunosensors. (a) Schematics of the Gr-FET
immunosensors. We functionalize the graphene surface with either CSAb or ACE2 receptor, which
have proved affinity for the S1 subunit protein (which contains the RBD) from coronaviruses. (b)
Electrical source-drain sheet conductance G as a function of the reference potential Vref measured
for the CSAb immobilized Gr-FET. A bipolar transfer curve is observed corresponding to different
type of charge carriers that can continuously be tuned from holes (left) to electrons (right) with a
Dirac point VDirac at minimum G.

Due to Debye screen in the 10 mM PBS buffer solution (Debye length=0.7 nm),
the charged S1 subunit protein cannot approach the graphene surface close enough to
induce a notable field-effect, as the expected size of the antibody is around 7-10 nm,11
i.e., one order-of-magnitude larger than the Debye length of the buffer solution. To
alleviate the ionic screening effect, we performed all the real-time sensing test under
diluted 0.01 PBS with elongated Debye length of 7 nm (comparable to the size of the
CSAb).
During real-time antibody-antigen reaction, we fixed the liquid-gate voltage (Vref)
at 0 V (electron branch), where the G-Vref curve exhibit a sharp slope, thus a high
sensing response. For signal processing, we normalized the change of the conductance
ΔG by the transconductance gm to deduce the shift of the liquid-gate voltage
ΔVref=ΔG/gm of Gr-FET upon antibody-antigen reaction. Such normalization helps to
eliminate the effect of sensor-to-sensor variation in electrical parameters, thus yielding
a reliable and reproducible sensing performance. Figure 2a shows the real-time

6

responses (ΔVref) monitored at varying concentrations of S1 ranging from 0.2 pM to 10
nM (added at time intervals of about 5 mins with increasing concentration). The
decrease of ΔVref depending on the increasing concentration of S1 is consistent with the
bonding of slightly positively charged molecules on the sensor surface. Such CSAb-S1
complex can be refreshed and reused with comparable performance after thoroughly
rinsing with buffer solution (Fig. S3). Additionally, repeating the same measurement
when shifting the liquid-gate voltage from Vref=0 V (electron branch) to Vref=-0.2 V
(hole branch), yields similar sensing behavior as expected (Fig. S4). As a negative
control, pure T20 modified Gr-FET was also tested (Fig. S5). Compared to the CSAb
immobilized Gr-FET immunosensor, T20 passivated Gr-FET shows negligible sensing
response to the target S1. Therefore, our results clearly suggest that Gr-FET signal
output is specific to the immobilized CSAb-S1 complex. Strikingly, such CSAb
immobilized Gr-FET immunosensors target S1 subunit protein of COVID-19 with a
limit of detection (LOD) down to 0.2 pM, which rivals that of state-of-the-art ELISA
technology but eliminating the requirements of complicated procedure for enzyme
labeling or bulky/expensive optical instruments.12, 13 We note here that there is still
plenty of room for improving the LOD by innovative antibody design and/or optimal
Gr-FET sensing scheme. In addition, the real-time monitoring of the ΔVref response
(Fig. 2a) indicates a fast response time (within 2 min) for the detection of S1, which
competes the current fast FLISA and/or ELISA technologies.13
Alternatively, ACE2 is an integral membrane protein served as functional
receptor for the spike glycoprotein of human coronaviruses SARS and COVID-19
infections. We further examined the affinity of ACE2-functionalized Gr-FET in the
presence of S1 subunit protein at varying concentrations (10 pM–1 µM). In contrast to
CSAb, real-time measurement of ACE2-functionalized Gr-FET immunosensor (Fig. 2b)

7

suggest that sharp increase/change of ΔVDirac happened only when 1 nM S1 was added.
Further affinity fitting based on a single-reaction model10 (see also SI) in Fig. 1e give
binding affinities of K=2×1011 M-1 and K=109 M-1 for CSAb-S1 and ACE2-S1
interaction, respectively. Obviously, compared to the ACE2 modified Gr-FET, its
CSAb modified counterpart exhibits a much higher affinity to the S1 subunit protein of
COVID-19,14, 15 which is in consistent with previous reports that the antibody can
scavenging virus before they bonding to receptors.
Neutralizing antibodies are extraordinarily crucial in the development of
vaccines and antibody drugs. Here, to screen the neutralizing antibody, we
functionalized Gr-FET with S1 protein to differential its affinity to CSAb or ACE2 in
real-time. The results indicate a sensing response to CSAb even at 0.1 pM
concentration;(Fig. 2d) whereas clear and sharp response can be identified for ACE2
only after 1 nM (Fig. 2e). In Fig. 1f, affinity fitting using our previously determined
binding constants of K=2×1011 M-1 and K=109 M-1 gives good description for CSAbS1 and ACE2-S1 interactions, respectively, also confirming our previous results and
conclusions on CSAb or ACE2 immobilized Gr-FET for S1 detection. Here we ascribe
the slight deviations in the affinity fitting for CSAb-S1 interaction at 0.1 pM and 1 pM
concentration (Fig. 2f) to possible ionic screening of the weakly charged CSAb with
relatively large size.

In summary, we expand the applications of label-free Gr-FET digital biosensing
technology to fast detection of COVID-19 spike protein S1 (which contains the RBD)
with sensitivities rivaling those of state-of-the-art ELISA technologies, but eliminating
any requirements of complicated procedure for enzyme labeling or bulky/expensive
optical instruments. We constructed the Gr-FET immunosensors by immobilizing
either CSAb or ACE2 on the surface of the graphene, both of which bind specifically
to the spike protein RBD. A direct comparison between CSAb and ACE2 based GrFET biosensors indicates that CSAb has a higher affinity to the spike protein RBD with
a LOM down to 0.2 pM. Moreover, we demonstrated the principle of spike protein S1
antigen functionalized Gr-FETs for fast analysis and screening of neutralizing
antibodies, which can block coronaviruses from attaching and infecting the health cell.
Thus, these results have important implications in the context of rapid and facile digital
immune-specific identification, as well as research and development of vaccines,
prophylactics and therapeutics to combat COVID-19 and other emerging coronavirus
associated infectious diseases, specifically during the outbreak period of pandemics.

here v is the number of sites of each species, 𝑎𝑠1𝑥+ the activity of the positively charged

𝑁𝑠 = 𝑣𝐶𝑆𝐴𝑏−𝑆1𝑥+ + 𝑣𝐶𝑆𝐴𝑏

(S2)

For simplifying the calculation, we assume the 𝐶𝑆𝐴𝑏 and 𝑆1 carrier zero and

Via the Boltzmann equation, we relate the (unknown) activity of the surface

activity 𝑎𝑆1𝑥+
and the surface potential Ψ0:

The mechanism can be modeled similarly in case of 𝐴𝐶𝐸2 − 𝑆1 complex
system.
