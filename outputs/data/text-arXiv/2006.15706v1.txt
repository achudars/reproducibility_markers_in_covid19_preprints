Abstract
This is a pedagogical paper on estimating the number of people that can be
infected by one infectious person during an epidemic outbreak, known as the
reproduction number. Knowing the number is crucial for developing policy
responses. There are generally two types of such a number, i.e., basic and
effective (or instantaneous). While basic reproduction number is the average
expected number of cases directly generated by one case in a population where
all individuals are susceptible, effective reproduction number is the number of
cases generated in the current state of a population. In this paper, we exploit
the deterministic susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model to estimate them
through three different numerical approximations. We apply the methods to the
pandemic COVID-19 in Italy to provide insights into the spread of the disease in
the country. We see that the effect of the national lockdown in slowing down the
disease exponential growth appeared about two weeks after the implementation
date. We also discuss available improvements to the simple (and naive) methods
that have been made by researchers in the field.

1. Introduction
”When will the peak of the pandemic hit? When will it be over?”
Those are unarguably among the most asked questions during the ongoing
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis, i.e., a disease outbreak of atypical
pneumonia that originated from Wuhan, China [1]. The disease spread to over
100 countries in a matter of weeks [2], with most internationally imported cases
reported to date having history of travel to Wuhan [3, 4]. The pandemic has
made governments all over the world take serious responses [5]. The governmental measures result in a significant disruption in the lives of their people
that raised such questions above.
Diseases grow rather exponentially at the initial transmissibility of outbreak
[6, 7]. When there is no intervention and the proportion of infections starts
to become comparable to the entire population, the growth will slow down as
susceptible is fuel to diseases. This type of logistic growth will yield the peak of
a pandemic that everybody is interested in and its arrival can be forecast using,
e.g., the susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) compartment model [8].
However, in the presence of pandemic, human beings adapt. Governments
intervene. As such, using the SIR model to predict the peak, while new cases
are mainly outcomes of national policies and/or community behaviour, would be
similar to forecasting what policymakers would do or the effectiveness of their
response [9, 10, 11], which is dynamic and can be unprecedented. On top of
that, there is a lack of knowledge of epidemiology characteristics and a high rate
of undocumented cases [12]. A brute force analysis by fitting reported data to
the SIR model is therefore prone to a false prediction if not done carefully (see,
e.g., Fig. 2 of [13] that incorrectly predicted the peak time as well as the total
infection of COVID-19 in Italy when compared to the latest data). We will show
below how data-driven forecasts are sensitive to the time-series information that
we input in the model.
Considering the limitations and obstacles, it is therefore important to determine instead the so-called disease reproduction number or reproductive factor
[14], which is the number of people that are infected by one infectious person
during an epidemic outbreak [15, 16, 17, 18, 19]. It depends on the duration of
the infectious period, the probability of infecting a susceptible individual during
one contact, and the number of susceptible people contacted per unit of time.
There are generally two types of such a number, i.e., basic [15] and effective
(or instantaneous) [16]. While basic reproduction number is the average expected number of cases directly generated by one case in a population where all
individuals are susceptible, effective reproduction number is the number of cases
generated in the current state of a population. This paper is intended to give a
brief review of these numbers to undergraduate students and a broad scienceeducated audience in general. We also hope that the paper can be an expository
article of epidemiology to policyholders in making public health measures.

To quantify directly the actual reproduction number is difficult, if not impossible, and as such, we can only estimate it indirectly. One common approach
is to fit a model to epidemiological data that will provide values of some parameters [6]. Here, we use the SIR compartment model as our model reference,
where the reproduction number is associated to the threshold point for stability
of the disease free equilibrium.
There are three estimation methods that we will discuss. As a case study,
we apply the methods to discuss and forecast viral transmission of COVID19 in Italy. The first one is by parameter fit to the SIR model [20], which
is probably the most popular analysis to the study of COVID-19 [13]. The
computed parameters will then be used to obtain the reproduction number.
The second method is to use the reported data of infected and removed people
[21]. Comparing the number with that obtained using the parameter fit shows
a similar trend in the decrease of the infection rate in Italy. The third method
is using the ratio of increment of infections from two subsequent days [22, 23].
However, such a quantity is usually highly fluctuating as we demonstrate for the
case of Italy. The trend is obtained using, e.g., a parameter fit of the Richards
curve [6, 24] to the cumulative cases.
As the methods presented here are all based on the SIR model, they are
limited by assumptions commonly made within the SIR model. An important
assumption is that the presented data are an accurate representation of what
happens in the population, although this can be relaxed for some methods in
this paper. Another assumption or limitation is that it does not include people
that are infected but not infectious, which can be overcome by incorporating
another compartment, such as the commonly used Exposed group.
We conclude the paper with a brief review of improvements to the methods
by including randomness (stochastic processes).

Here, S and I denote the total number of susceptible and infected individuals.
Variable R represents the removed compartment that can consist of recovered
(and become-resistant) and deceased individuals. The total population is N =
S + I + R. Note that dN/dt = d(S + I + R)/dt = 0, which implies that
N is constant. The parameters β and γ are the transmission and removal
rate constants, respectively. The average length of time an infected individual
remains infective, i.e., the infectious time, is 1/γ. Note that this still applies
3

even when the parameters β and γ are functions of time. Additionally, we
denote the cumulative (total) case as T = I + R, which satisfies the equation
dT
SI
=β .

Equation (2) can also be written as
dI
= γ (Rt − 1) I,

where

S

Rt is the effective reproduction number and R0 is the basic one. Note from (5)
that depending on the value of Rt , i.e., whether Rt > 1 or Rt < 1, the infections
I will increase or decrease in time, respectively. It is therefore important to track
this number to forecast the spread of an infection in an area.
As data are collected and reported regularly in a certain time interval, it is
instructive to consider instead the discrete model
Rt =

Sn In
,
N
Sn In
− τ γIn ,
∆In = τ β
N
∆Rn = τ γIn ,

∆Sn = −τ β

(8)
(9)

where ∆Kn = Kn+1 − Kn , K = S, I, R. τ is the time interval, which in the
limit τ → 0, make the model (7)-(9) become (1)-(3). We take τ = 1 day, which
is the standard time interval to report updates on cases for COVID-19. The
reproduction numbers (6) can be checked to be still applicable here. In the
following, we will mainly use the discrete SIR model (7)-(9).
As the main part of this report, we will consider three different methods to
approximate the effective reproduction number Rt .
2.1. Method 1: Parameter fit
To calculate Rt (6), one needs to determine first the parameters β and γ, as
well as the number of susceptible Sn and hence the population size N . Because
infection data are given in terms of the number of infected and removed (i.e.,
recovered or deceased) people, we can find the parameter set for which the model
has the best agreement with the data. In that case, we fit the deterministic
epidemiological model (7)-(9) by employing a generalized least squares scheme,
i.e., we search for the minimum of an unconstrained problem specified by

and γ) only. Note that N is implicitly part of the estimated parameters because
N = S1 + I1 + R1 . We take I1 = Idata1 and R1 = Rdata1 at the initial step.
The search is done using fminsearch function of Matlab that implements
the Simplex search method. To illustrate our computation, we consider COVID19 cases in Italy, which was one of the world’s worst-hit countries. Data were
retrieved from [25] on 26 April 2020, which in the analysis will be denoted as
Day 87 (i.e., Day 1 is 31 Jan 2020). We present in Fig. 1 the reported data
and the fitting SIR dynamics. We slightly modify the model by splitting the
removed compartment (R) into recovered and deceased ones with rates γ (1) and
γ (2) respectively and as such, γ = γ (1) + γ (2) .
From our computations, using all the available data, i.e., Day 1-87, to be
fitted into the SIR equations yields rather bad agreement. It turned out to
be necessary to split the data into two periods, separated around the national
lockdown that was implemented on 9 March 2020 (Day 39). To be precise, it is
the threshold date of the lockdown effect that manifested two weeks later, i.e.,
from Day 53.
The split is to incorporate the intervention and behavioural change of the
population in the model that requires the parameter values to vary over time.
Note that the SIR model assumes the parameter values to be constant during the
fitted period, which is not necessarily correct. Assuming constant value of those
parameters implicitly assumes that the decline in active cases is because herd
immunity (i.e., substantial decline in susceptible population) has been formed,
which has not been detected anywhere, even at places with high death counts.
Splitting the graph and fitting the parameters separately are therefore to solve
the assumption violation, where an extra care must be taken in the procedure.
Using the splitting, we obtain good agreement as can be seen in Fig. 1. It
is important to note that using data from Day 1-53, we obtained a predicted
peak at the end of March 2020, which clearly is not correct, i.e., parameter fits
depend sensitively on the fitted data. This explains the incorrect prediction of
[13].
In Table 1, we list the fitting parameters. Using the values, we plot in Fig.
2 the resulting estimated effective reproduction number Rt (6). It is clear that
the national lockdown effectively decreased the number. The curve crosses the
axis Rt = 1 at the peak on 19 Apr 2020.

2 (stars). The lines are necessarily split into two parts following the national lockdown, see
the text.

2.2. Method 2: Using infected and recovered data
In the second method, instead of getting the parameters β and γ from fitting,
we will derive them from the governing equations (8)-(9) directly. Writing β ≡
βn and γ ≡ γn on the right hand side of the equations, it is straightforward to
obtain
∆Rn
∆(In + Rn )
N, γn =

(11)
βn =
τ Sn In
τ In
From the definition (6), we have R0 = βn /γn and as such,
Rt =

∆In
Sn
.
R0 = 1 +
N
∆Rn

(12)

We therefore obtain that the effective reproduction number is related to the ratio
between the change of the infected and the removed compartments. Because
∆Rn > 0, then Rt < 1 if and only if ∆In < 0.
We show in Fig. 2 the estimated reproduction number using the second
method, depicted in stars. Because it uses the increase in infected and removed
counts which tend to be highly fluctuating, the resulting curve is also wavering.
This could be simply solved by smoothing the data using a moving average
filter. Nevertheless, in our case here, we still can observe that it is following the
same trend as that obtained from Method 1, i.e., the dashed curve.
2.3. Method 3: Using new cases
The third method is to exploit the daily reported new cases, which in terms
of the SIR model will be given by the daily difference of the cumulative cases
∆Tn . Integrating (2) in time between t and (t + τ ) gives us

where
b(Rt ) = eγτ (Rt −1) .

(14)

Here, we denote I(t + τ ) = In+1 and I(t) = In . In the last equation, we have
assumed that Rt is constant within the time interval.
On the other hand, we have from (4) a discrete approximation
∆Tn = τ βSn+1 In+1 /N = τ βSn+1 In b(Rt )/N ≃ τ βSn In b(Rt )/N.

(15)

The last step is expected to be valid for emerging diseases, i.e., I varies slowly.
At the same time, we also have from (4)
∆Tn−1 = τ βSn In /N.

Combining (15) and (16) gives us the effective reproduction number
b(Rt ) = ∆Tn /∆Tn−1 ,

Rt = 1 +

ln (b(Rt )) .

(17)

Because b(Rt ) is a monotonically increasing function in Rt , it can be enough to
plot b itself to determine whether the disease decreases or not.
In Fig. 3(a) we plot b(Rt ) from the data of COVID-19 cumulative cases
in Italy shown in stars. However, the curve is highly fluctuating that may
hide the trend. As mentioned in Method 2 above, this could also be solved
by smoothing the data using a moving average filter. Another possible way is
by approximating the reported cumulative cases with a continuous function. A
natural candidate is certainly the generalised logistic function, also known as
Richards’ curve,
A
Tn =
(18)
1/ν .
−C(n−n
0)
B+e
Again using a least square method to fit the reported cumulative cases to the
function, we obtain that the best parameter values are A = 119520, B = 0.9858,
C = 0.0665, n0 = 0.0086, ν = 0.0232. We plot the fitted data and the approximation in Fig. 3(b) in stars and dashed line, respectively.
Using the approximation (18), we are now able to plot a smooth curve (shown
in dashed in Fig. 3(a)) that is expected to indicate the trend of b(Rt ) calculated
from the reported data.
3. Conclusion
We have presented three simple (or actually simplistic) methods to estimate
the reproduction number of the COVID-19 pandemic based on the SIR equations
as the underlying model. We applied the methods to the data of COVID-19 cases
in Italy, where we saw that the implemented national lockdown had positive
impacts that appeared about two weeks later.
To extend the deterministic methods reviewed herein, one may consider complex models that include more compartments [6, 26]. However, to be more
9

realistic, one should include statistical randomness and probability in the calculations.
In the spirit of Method 1, Cintrón-Arias et al. [20] combined parameter
fits with statistical asymptotic theory and sensitivity analysis to give approximate sampling distributions for the estimated parameters. Method 3 has been
improved in [22, 23] to include a probabilistic description such that the probabilistic formulation for future cases is equivalent, via Bayes theorem, to the
estimation of the probability distribution for the reproduction number.
In addition to estimating the reproduction number based on a model, it is
also possible to approximate the reproduction number from the serial interval
(the time between the onset of symptoms in a primary case and the onset of
those in secondary cases) without assuming a model [27, 28, 29].
