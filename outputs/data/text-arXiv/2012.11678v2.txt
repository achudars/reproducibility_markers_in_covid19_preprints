ABSTRACT
Background: Guidelines and recommendations from public health authorities related to face
masks have been essential in containing the COVID-19 pandemic. We assessed the prevalence
and correlates of mask usage during the pandemic.

Methods: We examined a total of 13,723,810 responses to a daily cross-sectional representative
online survey in 38 countries who completed from April 23, 2020 to October 31, 2020 and
reported having been in public at least once during the last seven days. The outcome was
individual face mask usage in public settings, and the predictors were country fixed effects,
country-level mask policy stringency, calendar time, individual sociodemographic factors, and
health prevention behaviors. Associations were modelled using survey-weighted multivariable
logistic regression.

Findings: Mask-wearing varied over time and across the 38 countries. While some countries
consistently showed high prevalence throughout, in other countries mask usage increased
gradually, and a few other countries remained at low prevalence. Controlling for time and
country fixed effects, sociodemographic factors (older age, female gender, education, urbanicity)
and stricter mask-related policies were significantly associated with higher mask usage in public
settings, while social behaviors considered risky in the context of the pandemic (going out to

2

large events, restaurants, shopping centers, and socializing outside of the household) were
associated with lower mask use.

Interpretation: The decision to wear a face mask in public settings is significantly associated
with sociodemographic factors, risky social behaviors, and mask policies. This has important
implications for health prevention policies and messaging, including the potential need for more
targeted policy and messaging design.

Funding: This work was supported in part by the National Science Foundation NSF-RAPID
award “Evaluating the Impact of COVID-19 on Labor Market, Social, and Mental Health
Outcomes” (Bennett, de Bruin, Kreuter, Stuart, Thrul), and in part by Facebook for survey data
collection and support time for data analysis.

INTRODUCTION
In an effort to control and prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),
health organizations have recommended the use of a face covering or mask in public settings,
and an increasing number of studies suggest that face masks may be effective in reducing the
transmission of COVID-19.1–6 Yet, despite growing evidence of the effectiveness of using face
masks,7 there is still a lack of data and formal studies examining mask-wearing behavior on a
global scale. First, it is still unclear how mask-wearing behavior has changed over time across
the globe. Second, it is unknown whether individual- or country-level factors are associated with
mask-wearing. These questions are critical to better understand and target risky behavior patterns
across individuals and places, clarify ongoing public health messaging around face mask usage,
and, more generally, help better design prevention campaigns in future public health
emergencies.

Very few studies have examined the trends and predictors of face mask usage during the
COVID-19 pandemic. Increased usage of face masks has been reported in a few countries since
Spring 2020,6,8,9 and some studies have examined sociodemographic factors and individual
beliefs and attitudes as predictors of mask-wearing, but mostly in the context of past outbreaks
such, as SARS-Cov-1 and H1N1.10–14 Additional limitations of previous work are that many used
small non-random samples (e.g., ~300-5000 self-selected participants); most had a limited time
frame (e.g., one or two months) and/or narrow geographical coverage (e.g., one country); and
many studies could not simultaneously examine individual- and country-level factors that may
explain differences in mask-wearing behavior.

6

The main objective of this study was, therefore, to examine the evolution of mask usage across
different countries over time during the COVID-19 pandemic and assess whether individual and
country-level factors were associated with the decision to wear a mask. We leveraged a novel
dataset from the COVID-19 Symptom Survey,15 which since April 2020 has daily tracked mask
usage, sociodemographic characteristics, and other health prevention behaviors. We used data
from respondents who were randomly selected to take a survey between April 23, 2020 to
October 31, 2020 and who reported having been in public at least once during the last seven
days, which included approximately 13 million adults in 38 countries.

To the best of our knowledge, the COVID-19 Symptom Survey is currently the largest data
collection effort systematically monitoring mask usage and other social responses to the ongoing
COVID-19 pandemic at a global scale with representativeness at a country-level. No other study
has used its data to formally assess trends and predictors of mask usage worldwide.

DATA AND METHODS

The COVID-19 Symptom Survey
The COVID-19 Symptom Survey is an ongoing repeated daily cross-sectional survey conducted
by the University of Maryland and Carnegie Mellon University in partnership with Facebook,
Inc., and asks various questions related to symptoms, testing, preventive behaviors, mental
health, and more. The international version of the survey was launched on April 23, 2020 in

7

>200 countries and territories (Supplementary Table 1) and the US version of the survey was
launched on April 6, 2020. The survey instrument, sampling design, and weighting methodology
are described in more detail below. The Symptom Survey was reviewed and approved by the
Institutional Review Boards of both the University of Maryland and Carnegie Mellon University.

The survey instrument was developed by public health and survey experts,15 and included the
following sections: COVID-19 related symptoms, testing, contact history, preventive behavior
(e.g., face mask usage, hand washing, social distancing, etc.), mental health, economic security,
and basic demographics. The questionnaire is publicly available online,16,17 and is translated into
56 locales (listed in Supplementary Table 1).

The sampling methodology for the Symptom Survey has been described previously.18 Briefly, the
sampling frame is composed of daily active Facebook users who are >=18 years, living within
200+ countries or territories, and using one of the supported languages. This coverage ensures
that >95% of Facebook users are eligible. Every day, the Facebook app invites a stratified
random sample to take the survey with an invitation at the top of their News Feed, with the
sampling strata defined as the administrative boundaries within countries or territories.19 Those
who view the invitation and are interested in taking the survey are redirected to an off-Facebook
survey administered by the academic institutions. Facebook does not share or receive data from
the academic partners other than a list of random identification numbers of those who completed
the survey to calculate and share survey weights.

8

The details of the weighting methodology have been described previously.18 Briefly, Facebook
employs a two-stage weighting process to minimize bias related to non-response and coverage.
In the first step, inverse propensity score weighting is used to adjust for non-response bias by
making the sample more representative of the sampling frame of Facebook users. As stated
above, Facebook only receives a list of identification numbers that indicate who completed the
survey; therefore, the covariates used in this step are obtained from internal Facebook data,
which consist of self-reported age, gender, geographical variables, and other attributes that have
been found internally to correlate well with survey response.20 At the second stage poststratification or raking is used to equate the distribution of age and gender among the Facebook
population to benchmarks from the United Nations Population Division 2019 World Population
Projections, and first administrative level region benchmarks from publicly available population
density maps.21

Study Population

This analysis included adult participants who responded to the international COVID-19
Symptom Survey from April 23rd, 2020 until October 31st, 2020. We did not include responses
from the US Symptom Survey in this analysis, as the question on face mask usage was not
incorporated into the US questionnaire until September 2020. Since some of the 200+ countries
and territories have relatively small sample sizes, with high variability in responses, we focused
on 38 countries based on the following criteria: countries that are considered either members,
candidates, or key partners of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development

9

(OECD) convention,22 or countries with a sample size >600,000 during our study period (Table
1). Over the course of field collection in the selected 38 countries, 741,496,298 Facebook users
saw the survey invitation; 36,525,312 opened the survey invitation; and 18,730,575 responded to
the survey. Of those, 1,020,188 reported being in public in the past 7 days. Missingness on the
predictors ranged from 2-13% per variable, which overall resulted in 27% of the survey
respondents being excluded, leading to a final analysis sample of 13,723,810.

Outcome Variable Definition
Our outcome was face mask usage, based on the survey question: “In the last 7 days, how often
did you wear a mask when in public?” The response options were “All of the time”, “Most of the
time”, “Some of the time”, “A little of the time”, “None of the time”, or “I have not been in
public during the past 7 days”. We defined face mask usage as a binary variable: 1 if the
respondent reported wearing a mask all or most of the time, and 0 otherwise.

Predictor Measurement
We included several individual and country-level factors that could be associated with face mask
usage based on a priori hypotheses and existing literature. Individual-level predictors included
age, gender, standardized years of education, urbanicity (defined as living in a city versus town,
village, or rural area), and the following reported social behaviors from the last 24 hours:
working outside the household, going to a market/grocery store/pharmacy, going to a restaurant/
cafe/shopping center, spending time with someone outside their household, and attending a
public event with more than 10 people. We also included whether the respondent reported ever

10

being tested for COVID-19, and two variables capturing individual economic aspects: worried
about household finances and worked in the last seven days. The three variables on years of
education, financial worry, and employment status in the last seven days were added to the
survey on June 27, 2020; therefore, data on these items were not available earlier than this date.

Country-level predictors were country fixed effects, the (time-varying) presence of official
policies related to face masks, and the (time-varying) incidence of COVID-19 disease. The
country-level mask usage policies were obtained from the University of Oxford Our World in
Data’s COVID-19 dataset, which contains daily country-level policies on the use of face
coverings outside-of-the-home. The policies are graded from 0-5 and reflect the strength of the
policy (i.e., no policy, recommended, required in some specified places, required in all shared/
public spaces, required at all times) for each country.23 We generated standardized weekly
averages of this mask-wearing policy stringency index for each country, and included the index
as a continuous variable in the model. Country-day-level COVID-19 cases were obtained from
the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering’s repository,24 which
we used as a standardized seven-day lagged average to measure the association between the rate
of COVID-19 cases during the last seven days and the individual’s decision to wear a mask.

Statistical Analysis
In addition to examining descriptive statistics, a survey-weighted multivariable logistic
regression model was used to formally assess whether individual and country-level factors were
associated with mask-wearing. All statistical analyses were performed in R (version 4.0.3), using

11

the R survey package (version 4.0) to account for the sampling design. We estimated two
separate models to accommodate the fact that the three questions capturing socioeconomic
factors (financial worry, years of education, and employment status in the last 7 days) were
added later in field collection. The primary model included the entire sample from April 23,
2020, through October 31, 2020, with all predictors described above except for the three not
available before June 27, 2020. A secondary model was fit with a narrower time period spanning
from June 27, 2020 until October 31, 2020, to include the additional three socioeconomic factors.
We included month as a categorical variable in all models.

Role of the Funding Source
Facebook provided a gift that partially supported the collection of survey data and time for data
analysis. Facebook provided feedback on the manuscript, but all analyses were conducted
independently by the researchers at Johns Hopkins University.

RESULTS

Sample Characteristics
Table 1 documents the countries represented in the analysis sample and their corresponding
sample sizes. The countries with the largest sample sizes were Brazil, Mexico, Japan, Italy, and
India. Table 2 provides characteristics of the respondents used in analyses. Throughout the data
collection period, most indicated that they had not gone to their workplace outside of home
(64%), restaurant/cafe/shopping center (75%), or attended a public event with more than 10

12

people (89%) in the last 24 hours but had gone to a market, grocery store, or pharmacy in the last
24 hours (66%). The majority indicated that they wore a face mask most of the time or all of the
time when in public (84%).

Evolution of Mask Usage Over Time
Trends over time across the 38 countries (Figure 1) suggested considerable heterogeneity in selfreported mask-wearing in public across countries. Some countries had consistently high mask
usage (>75%) from April until October (ex: Chile, Italy, Japan, Argentina, Colombia, Turkey,
Romania, etc.) (Figure 1A). In some other countries, mask usage was relatively low in April, but
eventually increased and remained at higher levels (ex: Brazil, Portugal, South Africa, Germany,
France, Belgium, Greece, Canada, etc.) (Figure 1B). Mask usage was consistently low (<25%)
in certain countries (ex: Denmark, Sweden, and Norway) (Figure 1C), and was more irregular in
others (ex: Austria, Czech Republic, Slovenia, etc.) (Figure 1D).

Predictors of Mask Usage
Results from the logistic regression model confirmed the observed cross-country mask-wearing
trends over time, with individuals from the vast majority of countries — particularly of Northern
Europe — being significantly less likely to wear a mask when in public than individuals in Japan
(the referent country). Individuals were more likely to wear a mask in later months (May: OR
1.71, 95% CI [1.69, 1.75]; June: OR 1.95, 95% CI [1.92, 1.99]; July: OR 2.01, 95% CI [1.97,
2.05]; August: OR 2.60, 95% CI [2.55, 2.65]; September: OR 2.74, 95% CI [2.69, 2.80];
October: OR 3.40, 95% CI [3.32, 3.48]). (Table 3).

13

Demographic, behavioral, and policy-related factors were significantly associated with wearing a
face mask in public, even after controlling for time and country fixed effects. Of the
demographic factors, female gender (OR 1.70, 95% CI [1.69, 1.71]), living in an urban area (OR
1.40, 95% CI [1.39, 1.41]), and older age (age 25-34: OR 1.22, 95% CI [1.20, 1.23]; age 35-44:
OR 1.34, 95% CI [1.32, 1.36]; age 45-54: OR 1.43, 95% CI [1.41, 1.45]; age 55-64: OR
1.42, 95% CI [1.40, 1.44]); age 65+: OR 1.47, 95% CI [1.45, 1.49]) were positively associated
with wearing a face mask.

Of the behavioral factors, going to a market, grocery store, or pharmacy was associated with
higher mask use (OR 1.07, 95% CI [1.06, 1.08]), whereas more optional or risky behaviors22
were associated with lower mask use. More specifically, behaviors associated with lower mask
use were attending large public events (OR 0.45, 95% CI [0.44, 0.45]), socializing outside of the
home [OR 0.72, 95% CI [0.72, 0.73]), and going to a restaurant, cafe, or shopping center (OR
0.77, 95% CI [0.77, 0.78]). Other significant behavioral factors examined were working outside
from home, which was associated with lower mask usage (OR 0.98, 95% CI [0.97, 0.99]), and
having been tested for COVID-19, which was associated with higher mask use (OR 1.59, 95%
CI [1.57, 1.61]).

Regarding country-level factors, we observed that more strict policies were associated with
higher mask usage (OR 1.58, 95% CI [1.57, 1.59]), while lagged COVID-19 cases were (OR
0.93, 95% CI [0.92, 0.94]) associated with less mask-wearing.

14

In the secondary model, which included data from late-June onwards and the three additional
socioeconomic variables (financial worry, years of education, and employment status in the last
seven days), the aforementioned demographic, behavioral, and policy-related factors remained
significantly associated with face mask usage. The three additional socioeconomic variables
were significantly associated with mask-wearing: higher years of education was associated with
higher use (OR 1.07, 95% CI [1.07, 1.08]) while financial worry and working in the last seven
days were associated with lower use (financial worry: OR 0.88, 95% CI [0.87, 0.89]; being
employed in the last seven days: OR 0.98, 95% CI [0.97, 0.99]) (Table 3).

Figure 2 depicts the predicted probabilities of wearing a face mask for a few covariates. The
results demonstrate that overall, the probabilities of mask-wearing increased over time from
April until November but the extent to which the probabilities increased over time varied
considerably depending on country (ranging from ~1% increase in Sweden to 50% increase in
the United Kingdom; Figure 2A). The probability of mask-wearing was also higher among
individuals who identify as females (Figure 2B) or are living in cities (Figure 2C), while it was
lower among those who have gone out to a restaurant/shopping center (Figure 2D), socialized
outside of the household (Figure 2E), or attended a large public event (Figure 2F). The
probabilities varied depending on the country.

DISCUSSION

15

In this multi-national sample of over 13 million adults from 38 countries, we found that mask
usage has evolved differently across countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. In 13 countries,
mask usage prevalence stayed at 70% or higher throughout our study period (April through
October), while in Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, mask usage has consistently remained below
15%. In most other countries, mask usage was low in April and eventually reached higher levels,
although the pace at which this happened varied widely across these countries. A few other
countries have shown more irregular trends over time.

Certain demographics (i.e., female gender, older age, higher education, living in an urban area)
were associated with higher mask use, while more optional or risky behaviors, such as attending
a large public event, socializing outside of the household, and going to a restaurant, cafe, or
shopping center in the last 24 hours were associated with lower mask use. Examining the
strength of country-level face covering policies suggested that stricter mask-wearing policies
were associated with higher mask usage.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that describes global longitudinal trends of
face mask-wearing in a public setting using large nationally representative samples of this scale.
Past studies have been limited by narrow geographical coverage and time windows, and most
included smaller and non-random samples, with which it is difficult to estimate population
representative trends of mask use.6,8,9 Consequently, it is challenging to compare and contrast our
mask use estimates or trends to those from other data sources; however, we found that the trends
of mask use for some countries in our study (ex: France, Germany, United Kingdom, and

16

Sweden) are similar to reports provided by other online survey platforms such as YouGov’s
COVID-19 Public Monitor.25

There was considerable heterogeneity in mask use across countries, and some cross-country
differences were statistically significant even after adjusting for individual- and country-level
factors, such as time-varying mask-wearing policy stringency. These differences in face mask
usage across countries suggest that there may be unobserved underlying cultural phenomena
across countries that contribute to the adoption of mask-wearing. Pre-existing social norms
related to mask-wearing within countries should be taken into consideration when shaping maskrelated policy guidelines.

Our findings that certain demographic factors (older age, female gender, and higher education
levels) are associated with mask use corroborate findings from past studies reporting that age,
gender, and education are significant predictors of face mask usage in the context of other
outbreaks, such as SARS-Cov-1 and H1N1.10–14 One study conducted in Australia reported that
those living in rural areas as opposed to urban areas are more likely to wear a face mask;11
however, in this current, global study, we observed that those living in urban areas are more
likely to wear a mask. Notably, the previous study was conducted in the context of an anticipated
outbreak scenario, not during an actual pandemic. Taken together, these findings provide a better
understanding of who are more or less likely to wear face masks in public during an outbreak
and suggest that public health messaging should better target individuals who do not wear face
masks in public as frequently.

17

Interestingly, we found that social behaviors were differentially associated with wearing a mask
in that social behaviors that may be deemed more optional and risky in the context of the current
pandemic26 were associated with lower face mask usage, whereas other behaviors that take place
outdoors but may be less optional were associated with higher mask use. For example, going out
to a large public event, restaurant, cafe, shopping center, or socializing outside of the household
in the last 24 hours were associated with lower mask use, whereas going to a market, grocery
store, or pharmacy was associated with higher mask use. These results suggest that those who
engage in risky social activities during the pandemic are also less likely to wear a mask, and
highlight a critical target for public health intervention, as this may contribute to higher risks of
COVID-19 spread.27 Accordingly, our study found that stricter country-level policies around
mask-wearing were associated with higher mask use. These results altogether suggest that
policies should specifically highlight or put greater emphasis on wearing a face mask in settings
where individuals are less likely to do so.

The study has some limitations. First, years of education, financial worry, and employment status
were not collected throughout the full field collection period, even though these may be
important covariates to examine in association with mask use. To address this, however, we fit a
secondary model that included these variables during the narrower time period and found that the
results for most associations remained very similar. Second, given our non-experimental study
design, we cannot infer any causation from our findings.

18

Despite the limitations, there are many strengths to this study. This analysis leveraged the largest
ongoing, representative data collection related to COVID-19, which allowed us to examine and
compare the trends across many countries and include a long time period spanning seven
months. We also simultaneously examined individual- and country-level characteristics in our
models.

In summary, our study demonstrates various sociodemographic factors, such as older age, female
gender, higher education, and urbanicity, are associated with higher face mask usage, while more
risky social behaviors, such as going out to a large public event, restaurant, shopping center, and
socializing outside of the household are associated with lower mask use. In addition, stronger
face mask-related policies are associated with higher mask usage. Taken together, our findings
have important implications for health prevention policies and messaging in the context of the
ongoing and future public health emergencies, as they highlight the importance of better
targeting specific populations and behaviors when designing policies and messaging campaigns.
