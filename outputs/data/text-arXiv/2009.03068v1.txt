ABSTRACT
We extract entities and relationships related to COVID-19 from a corpus of articles related to Corona virus by employing a novel
entities and relationship model. The entity recognition and relationship discovery models are trained with a multi-task learning
objective on a large annotated corpus. We employ a concept masking paradigm to prevent the evolution of neural networks
functioning as an associative memory and induce right inductive bias guiding the network to make inference using only the
context. We uncover several import subnetworks, highlight important terms and concepts and elucidate several treatment
modalities employed in related ailments in the past.

1 Introduction
The recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 has led to a global pandemic with the total number of infections exceeding 6 million
with more than 370000 mortality already. The disease has been code named COVID-19 and had far reaching repercussions the
world over. This article aims to uncover the life science universe of the Corona virus and related ailments by employing some
of the state-of-the-art natural language processing technologies applied to biomedical domain. We took the corpus of about
40000 titles and abstracts released as a part of CORD-19 Open Research Challenge and applied our entity recognition and
relationship discovery models to construct a knowledge graph related to COVID-19. In the process, we uncovered about 40000
entities and 80000 relationships.
This article presents our salient findings and is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly describes our masked entities
model and masked relationship model. Section 3 presents a network analysis of the knowledge network discovered by mining
CORD-19 dataset. The coverage of CORD-19 dataset may be not exhaustive and up-to-date. We took snapshot around April
15, 2020. Nevertheless, the primary aim of this work is to demonstrate the application of artificial intelligence on condensing
unstructured information in the biomedical domain to a sufficiently low entropy state so that some important leads can be
established.

2 The Entities and Relationship Model
We ran our entity recognition model that was trained on about 1 billion data points that we have built in-house. A corpus of
about 33 million titles and abstracts was tagged for 4 different kinds of entities – protein, drug, disease, and taxonomy. We
employ a novel concept masking paradigm where the term occurrences were replaced by a dummy token. Thus, essentially we
remove the entire vocabulary associated with these entities from our training corpus. This inductive bias guides the model to
make inference using the surrounding context alone and helps us achieve state-of-the-art results on biomedical entity recognition
problem1 . We use a transformer architecture2 with the following three joint end-to-end multitask learning objectives: 1) masked
token prediction 2) next sentence prediction 3) entity type prediction. We train the word piece tokenization algorithm on
our in-house corpus to generate a vocabulary set of 30000 word pieces. The network had 8 encoder layers with each layer
composed of self-attention followed by a feedforward network. Positional encodings were used in the beginning. We will have
an elaborate publication on this at a later date1 .
We further uncover relationships between the entities by employing our relationship discovery model. The entities are
once again masked to guide the network to make an inference using the context alone. The transformer architecture is once
again used for encoding sentences. We use a novel bilinear attention at the output to model interaction between contextualized
embeddings of the two entities between whom we are trying to establish a relationship3 .

3 The Corona virus network analysis
We present here some of the important subnetworks and concepts uncovered as result of probing of CORD-19 dataset4 by
our neural network models. The findings in the paper are only suggestive and the purpose of this work is to demonstrate the
application of artificial intelligence to uncovering important concepts and relationships in the life sciences domain. We hope to
bring few import leads in sharp focus and help a researcher to narrow down the scope of his search for most important concepts
and relationships. Figure 1 shows the full set of all entities and relationships. We computed Katz centrality measure for each
node in the network. The Katz centrality measure can be understood follows: let A be an n × n adjacency matrix of the network
with the element Ai j being 1 if there is a relationship between node i and node j and zero otherwise. The powers of A such as
kth power Ak is representative of paths between two nodes through intermediaries. The Katz centrality measure for the node i
defined as:
∞

CKatz (i) =

n

∑ ∑ αk

k=1 j=1

 
Ak

ji

The attenuation factor α is chosen such that it is smaller than the reciprocal of the absolute value of the largest eigenvalue of A.
The top 20 concepts in the literature ranked by the normalized Katz centrality measure5 is shown in Table 1(a). The top ranked
concept is ofcourse coronavirus followed by cytokine. Concepts like spike protein and ACE2 also figure in the top 20. Several
different kinds of viruses such as adenovirus and rotavirus also figure in the top 20 showing the diversity of the CORD-19
dataset. The top proteins are shown in Table 1(b). The adverse cytokine response by the immune system and cytokine storm

Table 1. Concepts ranked by Katz centrality measure
occurring at a late stage of the ailment is the top mentioned protein concept in the literature. Spike protein which binds so
efficiently to the ACE2 receptor resulting in viral entry is ranked second among all proteins. Spike protein is at the center of

many therapeutic concepts under evaluation for possible treatments. Surprisingly, nucleocapsid protein or N protein is the
third most important protein concept discussed in the literature. N protein is a multifunctional protein playing a pivotal role
in enhancing the efficiency of viral transcription and assembly. Infact, the machinery related to N protein was proposed as
one of the top therapeutic target in a recent work. It was proposed that targeting of viral translation by interfering with the
eIF4F complex formation or the interactions between viral proteins N, Nsp2, Nsp8, and the transnational machinery may have
therapeutic benefits6 .

Figure 3. TMPRSS2 network

3.1 The ACE2 and Spike protein network
ACE2 protein also finds substantial mentionings in the published literature. We show here the subnetwork of ACE2 in Fig. 2.
The subnetwork has all nodes connected to ACE2 and their interconnections. It is a large network with 367 nodes and 1141
edges. There is a total of 60 drugs, 173 proteins, 90 diseases, and 44 organisms in the ACE2 network. We did path analysis
to uncover more lead compounds in the ACE2 network. We found all the paths between ACE2 and Spike protein with a
maximum of 3 hops between the two nodes. We further impose a condition that all nodes in the path should either be a drug
or a protein. The following drugs or drug like compounds were found in the paths: A291P, Alanine, Arbidol, Chloroquine,
Emodin, Glutathione, HR2P-M2, IL-4, K267N, MAB 1a9, Nitric Oxide, Rabbit Antisera, Sialic acid, SP-10, SP-8, Superoxide,
and TAPI-2. K267E and A291P are actually polymorphism to DDP4 host protease. DDP4 helps the binding of Spike protein to
the host. It was observed that these polymorphism reduce viral replication and thus have a therapeutic effects7 . Arbidol is an
antiviral drug that has been reported to block viral entry and replication8 . Emodin is another top drug in the ACE2 network that
works by blocking the interaction between ACE2 and Spike protein9 . Glutathione works by downregulating ACE210 . SP-8 and
SP-10 are peptides that disrupt the binding of Spike protein to ACE211 .
While discussing ACE2, it is worth mentioning the role of TMPRSS2 in the pathogenesis. TMPRSS2 is a serine protease
that plays a role in cleaving the spike protein and helps the binding of S protein to ACE2. Figure 3 shows the TMPRSS2
subnetwork. It is a small and yet important subnetwork and is easy to visualize. It has 37 nodes and 95 edges. There are 2
drugs, 20 proteins, 3 diseases, and 12 organisms in the network. Camostat which is a TMPRSS2 inhibitor shows up the network
5/19

and can be used as a drug to block the viral entry. One of the important protein that shows in the network in Fig. 3 is LY6E.
It is an interferon stimulated protein and has been shown to be effective in curbing the entry of SARS-CoV-2 in a couple of
studies12, 13 .
3.2 The Viral Protein Network

Figure 4. The subnetwork composed of polymerase, protease, helicase, transferase and related entities
We shift our attention now to the viral target protein network. Figure 4 shows a subnetwork of concepts related to
polymerase, protease, helicase, and transferase. The RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is one of the important viral
targets. RdRp is an enzyme that catalyzes the replication of RNA from an RNA template. Several drugs have been proposed
6/19

over the years to inhibit the function of RdRp. Remdesivir has emerged as one of the more promising drugs. Remdesivir
treatment is prohibitively expensive. However, several other drugs have emerged out of our literature mining. In fact, one
of the drugs with a higher centrality measure is Adenosine which is an Adenosine triphoshate analog and can successfully
block the viral replication14 . There are few more drugs that have emerged targeting RdRp namely Sofosbuvir, AZT, Tenofovir
Alafenamide, and Alovudine. We also analyzed the 3C-like protease network and 3 experimental drugs named EPDTC,
JMF1586, and JMF1600 emerged.

Table 2. Top drugs in the network
We also ranked all the drugs discovered by their centrality measure. The results are shown in Table 2. The unlikely
candidate here is Type I IFN or Type I Interferon. The second candidate is IFN-α which is related to Type I IFN. The third
candidate is Ribavirin which is very popular anitviral drug effective against many different species of virus. At first, these
results surprised us. However, some of the recent experiments have corroborated our findings. The interferon signalling system
plays a key role in immune system response to virus infestations. It was observed in recent study the SARS-CoV-2 suppresses
the induction of type I interferons while aggravating IL-6 response. These results suggest an important immune imbalance
where low levels of interferons reduces the hosts ability to contain the viral replication, and the activation of IL-6 immune
responses promotes inflammation15 . In a recent phase 2 clinical trail, a recombinant type I IFN combined with Ribavirin and
Lopinavir demonstrated good results in curing the COVID-19 ailment compared to administering Ribavirin alone16, 17 .
We further tried to uncover the drug used for dealing with SARS-CoV-2 like viruses by interrogating our network for
following concepts: coronavirus, SARS, SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, 2019-ncov, ARDS, MERS, MERS-CoV

infection, MERS-CoV, RNA virus infections, SARS-CoV mouse lung, SARS-CoV particles, SARS-CoV populations,
SARS-CoV-2 infection, Coronavirus infection, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. We restricted the relationship type as being TREATS. Table 3 in Appendix 5 shows these relations. We
uncovered about 70 such relationships. The hyperlink to the original article can be found in fifth column Reference Id. It is
interesting to note that we discovered the a treatment that have been recently reported to be effective in COVID-19 and have
also been reported earlier in reference to another ailment. A combination treatment with IFN-1b, Lopinavir/Ritonavir, and
8/19

Ribavirin which was recently reported to be successful in phase 2 clinical trial for COVID-1916 . We discovered that the same
combination was proposed earlier for MERS (see entry 23)18 . Thus, the entries in Table 3 may serve as a ready reference point
to explore many other treatment modalities for COVID-19. The extensive drug-disease network corresponding to Table 3 is
shown in Fig. 5. This subnetwork was formed by taking all the drugs listed in Table 3 and finding all the diseases related to
these drugs.

4 Conclusion
We undertook a comprehensive concept identification and network analysis for COVID-19. We demonstrated the use of a novel
concept recognition and relationship discovery engine that crafts some of the latest advances in natural language processing
into a state-of-the-art solution for biomedical entity recognition and relationship discovery problem. Several new drugs were
uncovered through the studies and many different treatment modalities were brought to the surface. We envision these solutions
to have a wide ranging impact through the length and breadth of drug discovery process spanning all therapeutic areas.
