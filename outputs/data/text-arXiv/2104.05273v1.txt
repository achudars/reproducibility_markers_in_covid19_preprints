Abstract
We provide a new investigation of the relationship between oil and stock prices in the context
of the outbreak of the new coronavirus crisis. Specifically, we assess to what extent the
uncertainty induced by COVID-19 affects the interaction between oil and the United States
(US) stock markets. To this end, we use a wavelet approach and daily data from February 18,
2020 to August 15, 2020. We identify the lead-lag relationship between oil and stock prices,
and the intensity of this relationship at different frequency cycles and moments in time. Our
unique findings show that co-movements between oil and stock prices manifest at 3-5-day cycle
and are stronger in the first part of March and the second part of April 2020, when oil prices
are leading stock prices. The partial wavelet coherence analysis, controlling for the effect of
COVID-19 and US economic policy-induced uncertainty, reveals that the coronavirus crisis
amplifies the shock propagation between oil and stock prices.

1. Introduction
The new coronavirus (COVID-19) crisis has forced oil and financial markets to run into
headwinds. Firstly, the oil price plunged with more than 20% in one single day, on March 9,
2020. Several factors explain the oil price dynamics in the context of COVID-19 crisis. On the
one hand, the pandemic crisis generated a worldwide contraction of the real activity, primarily
affecting the transport sector, and therefore, the demand for oil. In addition, given the amplitude
of its social impact (millions of infected people, high fatality ratios, and the associated
blockages of the health care systems), COVID-19 created a lot of uncertainty into the markets.
On the other hand, the severe slowdown in the Chinese oil demand recorded in February 2020
and the fall of initial negotiations between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC) and Russia regarding oil production determined international producers to
launch a price war on the market. Consequently, the crude oil prices approached to their lowest
level during the last decades.
Secondly, the US stock markets recorded price bubbles before the globally propagation
of COVID-19. Likewise, over the last five years, the S&P 500 index has reached a maximum
of 3,380 points on February 14, 2020. In the context of a booming uncertainty and financial
volatility, S&P 500 plummeted 4.4% on February 28. A highly more severe shock was
experienced on March 9, 2020, when the oil price crash has transmitted to the stock price
dynamics (the so-called “Black Monday”).
Given this context, the purpose of our paper is to provide new evidence on the relationship
between oil and stock prices, by taking explicitly into consideration the uncertainty induced by
the new coronavirus crisis. We investigate thus the intensity of this relationship at different
frequency cycles and moments in time.
The mechanisms explaining the relationship between oil price fluctuations and stock
market valuations are well established in the literature. On the one hand, the theoretical
arguments state that an increase in oil prices leads to a reduction of stock prices (Hamilton,
2009). According to this theory, oil prices act as an inflation tax on consumers and producers,
with undesirable effects on anticipated profits and dividends, generating a decreasing trend on
stock markets. On the other hand, according to the theory of commodity markets
financialization, oil and stock prices co-move (Zhang et al., 2017), whereas the recent positive
stocks-oil correlation is explained by both a contraction of global demand and volatility shocks
(Bernanke, 2016).
Starting from these theoretical arguments, the empirical literature dealing with oil – stock
market nexus reveals mixed findings. Indeed, all types of interactions are documented in the
literature: a negative impact of oil shocks on stock markets (e.g. Kilian and Park, 2009; Basher
et., 2018), a positive impact (Demirer et al., 2015), or no significant impact (Apergis and Miller,
2009; Bastianin et al., 2016). The only consensual fact provided by this abundant empirical
literature suggests that the oil-stock nexus is nonlinear (Reboredo, 2010), time-varying (Ji et
al., 2020), asymmetric (Balcilar et al., 2019), and highly sensitive to specific events like for
instance the financial crisis (Albulescu et al., 2019; Bouri, 2015; Reboredo and Ugolini, 2016;
Roubaud and Arouri, 2018).
The mixed findings reported by the empirical literature can therefore be explained by the
manifestation of different forms of uncertainty which significantly influence the relationship
between oil prices and stock market returns. First, the economic policy uncertainty negatively
affects stock market returns, while it contributes to higher stock market volatility (e.g. Arouri
et al., 2016). Second, oil prices are sensitive to geopolitical factors, commercial settlements,
and different policy measures (Albulescu et al., 2020). Therefore, extending the literature to the
oil context, Aloui et al. (2016) find that higher policy uncertainty is positively connected with
oil prices during periods preceding crisis episodes.
2

Nevertheless, these studies have not explicitly analyzed the interactions between oil and
stock markets in presence of specific uncertainty shocks. Integrated analyses dealing with the
impact of uncertainty on both the oil and stocks markets are very rare in the literature (few
exceptions are represented by the papers of Kang and Ratti (2013), Kang et al. (2017), Fang et
al. (2018), Badshah et al. (2019), Albulescu (2021)). Our paper aims to fill the gap in the
literature by exploring the co-movements and the nature of the relationships between oil price
dynamics and stock markets returns in the presence of the COVID-19 global shock. Indeed, the
recent paper by Prabheesh et al. (2020) explores the time-varying dependence between stock
and oil prices in the context of the new coronavirus crisis. Different from this work, we resort
to a time-frequency framework in order to isolate the effect of COVID-19 on oil-stock price
co-movements and, at the same time, to see if co-movements manifest at specific frequency
cycles.
Therefore, the second element of originality of our paper is represented by the proposed
methodological approach. We apply a wavelet model, combining the time and the frequency
domain analyses, to assess simultaneously how variables are related at different frequencies
and moments in time. More precisely, we resort to a Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT)
and we first use the wavelet coherence (WTC) to identify the co-movements and the phasedifferences (lead-lag situations) between oil and stock prices. As novelty, we control for the
impact of coronavirus-induced uncertainty by using the partial wavelet coherence (PWC)
proposed by Grinsted et al. (2004) and extended by Mihanović et al. (2009). We consider the
coronavirus-induced uncertainty (e.g. the new infection cases at global level and in the US, the
global fatality ratio), as well as the policy-induced economic uncertainty (US EPU), for
robustness purpose.

2. Methodology and data
To filter the data through the wavelet transform, we rely on the CWT. Likewise, for a
time series 𝑋𝑡 (with 𝑡 = 1, … 𝑁) and a discrete sequence 𝑥𝑡 , the CWT is defined as (Grinsted et
al., 2004):
𝛿𝑡

𝛿𝑡

𝑊𝜏𝑋 (𝑠) = √ 𝑠 ∑𝑁
𝑡=1 𝑥𝑡 𝜓0 [(𝑡 − 𝜏) 𝑠 ],

(1)

where 𝜏 is the time scale and 𝑠 is the wavelet scale.
The co-movements and the lead-lag relationship between two series 𝑋𝑡 and 𝑌𝑡 can be
analyzed resorting to the WTC approach proposed by Torrence and Webster (1999):
𝑅𝑡2 (𝜏, 𝑠) =

|𝑆(𝑠−1 𝑊𝜏𝑋𝑌 (𝑠))|
2

2
2

𝑆|(𝑠 −1 |𝑊𝜏𝑋 (𝑠)| )|×𝑆|(𝑠 −1 |𝑊𝜏𝑌 (𝑠)| )|

,

(2)

where 𝑆 ∙ is the smoothing parameter that ensure a balance between resolution and significance.
Starting from the WTC, Grinsted et al. (2004) propose the PWTC to remove the effect of
a third variable 𝑋′𝑡 on the connection between 𝑋𝑡 and 𝑌𝑡 . Further, building upon Grinsted et al.
(2004), Mihanović et al. (2009) advance the PWTC squared, which ranges from 0 to 1, as
follows:
|𝑅(𝑌,𝑋)−𝑅(𝑌,𝑋′)∙𝑅(𝑌,𝑋)∗ |2

𝑅𝑃2 (𝑌, 𝑋 ⋮ 𝑋′) = [1−𝑅(𝑌,𝑋′)]2×[1−𝑅(𝑋,𝑋′)]2.

(3)

We use daily data from February 18, 2020 to August 14, 2020, covering both the prepandemic and the pandemic phase of COVID-19. The starting date is February 18, 2020,
immediately after the peak of the new infection cases reported by China. Daily data are
available on the WHO website until August 15, 2020. The oil price data are extracted from the
US Energy Information Administration and refers to the West Texas Intermediate (WTI). The
S&P 500 data are obtained from Datastream, whereas the US EPU daily data are extracted from
Baker et al. (2016) and are daily updated. Finally, the COVID-19 statistics come from World
3

Health Organization (WHO) situation reports and refer to the total infection cases at global
level and in the US, as well as to the fatality ratio (the ratio between reported deaths and
infection cases) recorded at global level. WHO’s report released at date “t” indicates the COVID-19
numbers reported by countries at “t-1”. Therefore, we use one lag for the COVID-19 statistics.
It is well known that geopolitical risks strongly influence oil prices. Starting with
February 2020, several round of negotiations between OPEC and Russia take place, in order to
establish limit for oil extraction and to prevent huge price drops. However, this ongoing
“conflict” certainly affected the nexus between oil and stock prices. Likewise, to remove the
effect of geopolitical risks on oil prices we have first orthogonalized the oil prices on a Google
trend index showing the global search of the “OPEC” during the analyzed period. We use this
proxy for the geopolitical risk because the well-known index proposed by Caldara and
Iacoviello (2018) is unavailable since March 11, 2020. In the second step, all variables are
expressed in logarithmic difference.

3. Results
We start the analysis with the presentation of WTC results. For each figure, the black
contour inside the cone of influence (COI) designates the 5% significance level. Y-axis
measures frequencies or scales (period on the graph), ranging from the shortest scale (1-4-day
cycle) to the longest scale (16-32-day cycle). X-axis represents the time period (126
observations). The blue color inside the COI is associated with low co-movements, while the
yellow color, with high co-movements. The area below the COI shows no statistical influence.
Figure 1 shows that oil prices and stock prices co-move in general, supporting thus the
financialization theory. Significant co-movements are recorded at short and medium scales, i.e.
2-6-day cycle, and manifest between February 20 and March 10, 2020 and for the period
running from June to July 2020.

Notes: (i) On the X-axis, observation 1 corresponds to February 18, 2020, observation 60 corresponds to
May 12, and observation 120 to August 6; (ii) The arrows indicate the phase differences between the two
series. Arrows pointing to the right mean that the variables are in-phase (they co-move), to the right and
up mean that the oil prices are leading stock prices, and to the right and down mean that oil prices are
lagging. Arrows pointing to the left show that the variables are out-of-phase, to the left and up mean that
that oil prices are lagging, and to the left and down mean that oil prices are leading.

It is not clear, however, if the oil prices lead the US stock prices, or the opposite applies.
The 2-6-day cycle indicates the average number of days which are necessary for the stock prices
to accommodate shocks in oil prices. At the same time, in the medium run (6-8-day cycle) and

4

for the period running from March 20 to April 20, 2020, we clearly notice that the variables are
out-of-phase and oil prices are lagging stock prices.
In the second step, we isolate the effects of two types of uncertainties on the oil-US stock
price nexus. First, we control for the effect of COVID-19 induced uncertainty. Second, for
robustness purpose, we control for the effect of US EPU. To this end, we use the PWC approach
allowing to measure the co-movements between oil and stock prices by controlling for the
uncertainty effects. The results are presented in Figure 2 and show that, if the COVID-19 related
uncertainty is defined by the log-difference of total infection cases (Figure 2a), the comovements between WTI oil prices and S&P 500 price returns are significant in the short and
medium runs, for specific moments in time. The previous WTC results are thus confirmed.
Nevertheless, we observe that the yellow surfaces delimitated by the black contour (5%
significance level) are smaller than the co-movement surface identified in Figure 1. Put it
differently, when the effect of COVID-19 uncertainty is isolated, we observe that the comovements manifest for a smaller period. Therefore, we conclude that COVID-19 crisis has
amplified the oil-stock prices co-movements.

Notes: (i) On the X-axis, observation 1 corresponds to February 18, 2020, observation 60 corresponds to May
12, and observation 120 to August 6; (ii) Y-axis measures frequencies or scales (period or periodicity on the
graph).

A similar result is obtained when the US infection cases are considered as a proxy for the
COVID-19 uncertainty (Figure 2b). We also notice that COVID-19 fatality rate induces an
uncertainty which affects the oil– stock price relationship (Figure 2c). Finally, when we isolate
the effects of US EPU (Figure 2d), we notice that the co-movements manifest for a shorter
period in July-August 2020 (3-5-day cycles).

4. Conclusions and policy implications
Several studies already tried to explain the oil – stock price nexus considering the impact
of US economic policy uncertainty. Our paper contributes to this narrow strand of the literature
and investigates the role of the uncertainty induced by the COVID-19 crisis. During the recent
pandemic crisis, the oil price collapsed and the shocks spillover from on market to another are
apparently amplified.
Our wavelets results indicate the presence of non-linear co-movement, which manifests
at short to medium frequencies (2-6-day cycles) starting from February 20 to March 10, 2020,
and between June and July 2020. During these periods, it is not clear if oil prices are leading
stock prices, or the opposite applies. Very importantly, the developments of COVID-19
generate a significant increase in the co-movements both in the short and medium runs, whereas
the US EPU amplifies the co-movements at 3-5-day cycle. These findings remain robust to
different specifications of COVID-19 associated uncertainty. In terms of policy implications,
the coronavirus crisis seems to be a quite cataclysmic global shock with extremely largely
sanitary and economic consequences. Therefore, the economic and financial governance need
to be revisited. A thorough understanding of the interactions between commodities and
financial markets, and more particularly between oil and stock prices could contribute to
effectively guide the policymakers’ decisions.
