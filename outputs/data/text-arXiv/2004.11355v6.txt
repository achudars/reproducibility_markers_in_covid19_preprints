Abstract
Official counts of COVID-19 deaths have been criticized for potentially including people who did
not die of COVID-19 but merely died with COVID-19. I address that critique by fitting a generalized
additive model to weekly counts of all deaths registered in England and Wales during the 2010s. The
model produces baseline rates of death registrations expected without the COVID-19 pandemic,
and comparing those baselines to recent counts of registered deaths exposes the emergence of excess
deaths late in March 2020. By April’s end, England and Wales registered 45,300±3200 excess deaths
of adults aged 45+. Through 22 May, the last day of available all-deaths data, 56,600 ± 4400 were
registered (about 53% of which were of men). Both the ONS’s corresponding count of 43,205 death
certificates which mention COVID-19, and the Department of Health and Social Care’s count of
33,671 deaths, are appreciably less, implying that their counting methods have underestimated, not
overestimated, the pandemic’s true death toll. If underreporting rates have held steady during May,
about 59,000 direct and indirect COVID-19 deaths might have been registered through the end of
May but not yet publicly reported in full.

Introduction

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has killed hundreds of thousands of people [1, p. 1], including tens of
thousands in England and hundreds in Wales [2]. False negatives and false positives obstruct estimation of
exactly how many people COVID-19 has killed; false negatives are people who die of COVID-19 but whose
deaths are wrongly attributed to something else, and false positives are people whose deaths are wrongly
attributed to COVID-19. While official COVID-19 death counts boomed, assorted commentators, some
well credentialled and some well known, stressed the possibility of false positives inflating the death count.
Andrew Neil, host of BBC Television’s Politics Live and The Andrew Neil Show, former chairman of Sky
TV, and chairman of The Spectator magazine, tweeted [3]:
Various headlines now hitting multiple websites with variations of: 00 UK death toll due to
#Coronavirus now 766, an increase of 182 in last 24 hours00
BUT: what these stats don’t tell us us: [sic]
How many died FROM the virus?
How many died WITH the virus?
Forensic pathologist Raquel Fortun, of the University of the Philippines, tweeted [4]:
So covid-19 kills old people, and those sick of other things. In the Philippines are we
really counting right? Or do we just say they’re old, or died of something else?[THINKING
FACE emoji]
Bill Mitchell, Florida-based host of talk show YourVoiceTM America, tweeted [5]:
I want to know how many who 00 died from COVID-1900 were on ventilators prior to their
death? Because if your COVID-19 wasn’t bad enough to put you on a ventilator, you died
from something else.
Where are the numbers?
Mitchell also tweeted [6]:
I say the COVID-19 death counts are BULLSH*T. I say they are loaded with deaths from
the flu and other co-morbidities and have been 00 dumped00 into the COVID-19 column.
I demand a transparent international standard on what constitutes a COVID-19 death!
Retweet if you agree.
Professional boxer and former professional rugby player Anthony Mundine posted on Facebook [7]:
Corona virus [sic] is bogus for real ! There [sic] putting fear through media to set an
agenda!All [sic] the deaths there [sic] saying that’s happening is true but then they add the
corona virus [sic] when it was something else to scare everybody & market the corona ! The
world order is happening peeps ! STAY WOKE NOT ASLEEP in what’s going on around
you ! Mass vaccines will be introduced soon you will see !! To harm & control you more &
could cause major effects on adults & children like autism & even death ! Then they will
blame corona!
John P. A. Ioannidis, co-director of METRICS (the Meta-Research Innovation Center at Stanford) and
editor-in-chief of the European Journal of Clinical Investigation, observed more temperately in an opinion
piece for STAT [8] that
[i]n some people who die from viral respiratory pathogens, more than one virus is found
upon autopsy and bacteria are often superimposed. A positive test for coronavirus does not
mean necessarily that this virus is always primarily responsible for a patient’s demise.
Pundit Candace Owens tweeted to her two million Twitter followers [9]:
In other words: the death toll we are seeing is “people that tested positive for the the
virus, and are now dead.” Not, people that have died FROM Coronavirus.
That number, when investigated, will be much lower. Italy determined only 12% of their
death toll was FROM Covid
2

BBC News’s main UK Twitter account tweeted to 10.8 million followers [10]:
Deaths being reported daily are hospital cases where a person dies with the coronavirus
infection in their body
But is the virus causing the death?
It could be the major cause, a contributory factor or simply present when they die of
something else
Evidently the question remains open of how much false positives are inflating COVID-19 death counts.
This paper contributes to answering that question with death data from the United Kingdom’s
Office for National Statistics (ONS). The basic idea is simple. Instead of trying to count COVID-19
deaths directly and exclusively, I study how all known deaths, from any cause, have changed over time.
A sufficiently large and rapid increase in COVID-19 deaths should appear as statistically detectable
increases in all registered deaths, and increases in those registered deaths would be the same regardless
of how many non-COVID-19 deaths were misregistered as COVID-19 deaths.
To try to detect those statistical signals, I fit a statistical model to the ONS’s pre-COVID-19 counts
of all registered deaths, and generate baseline estimates of how many deaths would be expected absent
the pandemic, given historical trends. I then compare the observed number of registered deaths in
recent weeks against those baselines to see whether a statistically significant excess of registered deaths
is evident; in the absence of an alternative explanation for them, such excess deaths may be attributed
to COVID-19.

2.1

Data
Death counts

In this study I use the ONS’s provisional counts of deaths registered in England and Wales each week [11]
from week 1 (2–8 January) of 2010 onwards. Only 11 days out of date when published, those provisional
data are the most up-to-date national counts of all deaths. While the ONS also publishes daily-resolution
counts of all deaths registered in England, the daily-resolution counts appear only in the ONS’s quarterly
death statistics [12], which have a far greater months-long publication delay.
In its provisional weekly counts the ONS decomposes the total counts in several ways. It tabulates
each week’s deaths by respiratory disease separately from the all-cause totals (though the counts of
respiratory-disease deaths are difficult to integrate with the other death counts, because respiratorydisease deaths overlap only partially with deaths associated with COVID-19 [13]). The ONS also breaks
down the weekly counts by decedents’ region of usual residence (North West, Yorkshire and The Humber,
Wales, etc.), and by sex and age group. My analyses use the breakdown by age and sex (appendix A);
because deaths by region are broken down separately, it is not possible to analyze the deaths by age,
sex, and region simultaneously.
Before April 2020, the weekly counts used 7 age bands when breaking down deaths by age: age 0, ages
1–14, ages 15–44, ages 45–64, ages 65–74, ages 75–84, and ages 85+. During the COVID-19 pandemic,
however, the ONS updated the counts for 2020 to use a finer breakdown with 20 age bands: age 0, ages
1–4, then 17 contiguous 5-year age bands, and finally ages 90+. For consistency’s sake I aggregate the
revised data for 2020 back to the original coarser age banding, reconciling them with the older data.

2.2

Central England temperatures

As well as the death counts themselves, I use the Met Office Hadley Centre for Climate Change’s time
series of daily outdoor minimum temperatures and daily outdoor maximum temperatures in Central
England [14, 15, 16]. Ambient, outdoor air temperatures near surface level could plausibly correlate with
COVID-19 deaths and deaths in general, and Central England temperatures (CET) are a reasonable
proxy for typical outdoor air temperatures in England and Wales generally, because outdoor air temperatures correlate reasonably well even at distances of hundreds of kilometres [14, 17] and different regions
of England and Wales show similar year-to-year temperature changes [18, pp. 25–58].
I generate 6 weekly aggregates of CET (table 1) from the daily records as potential inputs to my
models of death counts. Two (TMIN and TMAX) of the aggregates are a particular week’s extreme temper-

atures; a third, TMID, is the average temperature in a week; two more (TSD and TRAN) measure intra-week
variability in temperature, and the last, TMDI measures the week-on-week change in temperature.
I also reformat the temperature observations, which the Hadley Centre presents as integers with units
of tenths of a degree Celsius, by dividing them each by ten. The temperature-based parts of my analyses
therefore use temperatures in units of degrees Celsius.

2.3

Air-quality indices

In the United Kingdom, Defra (the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs) publishes a
Daily Air Quality Index (DAQI) at individual air-monitoring sites [19] and for regions of the UK [20].
The DAQI is the highest of 5 indices of different pollutants: ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide,
PM2.5 , and PM10 . Research has correlated short-term changes in the concentrations of all 5 of these
pollutants with short-term changes in mortality in developed countries [21, 22, 23, 24, 25] and in China
[26, 27], and so I generate weekly aggregates of the DAQI to use as potential correlates of registered
deaths.
Defra publishes a DAQI for each of 16 regions: one represents all of Northern Ireland, 4 represent Scotland (“Central Scotland”, “Highland”, “North East Scotland”, “Scottish Borders”), two Wales (“North
Wales” and “South Wales”), and 9 England. I compute a national DAQI as the simple, unweighted mean
of the 11 English and Welsh regional DAQIs. In theory, it may be better to use a weighted mean, such as
a mean weighted by regions’ populations, but Defra’s DAQI regions do not comport to any single official
scheme, which is an obstacle to precisely determining appropriate weights, and with the regional DAQIs
all positively correlated with each other (during the 2010–2019 decade, the Pearson product-moment
correlations between regions’ DAQIs ranged from +0.167 to +0.737, with a mean of +0.407), a weighted
mean is unlikely to be a great improvement.
I compute 3 weekly AQI aggregates, AQIMIN, AQIMAX, and AQIMID, as the lowest, highest, and mean
of a week’s 7 national DAQIs. Unlike temperature, I define no aggregates representing AQI’s variability
within or between weeks. Variation in temperature might cause thermal stress and hence mortality in
itself; if people have adapted to the current temperature, then a change in temperature, even towards a
more moderate temperature, could induce stress. There is no analogy to fluctuations in air quality. A
lower (D)AQI should always tend to accompany lower mortality, and there is no basis to expect changes
in (D)AQI to trigger or prevent deaths in their own right.

Modelling
Death-registrations data summary and formal model specification

Figure 1 shows the number of deaths registered in England and Wales by week. Deaths of middle-aged
and older adults evince an annual cycle which becomes more pronounced with increasing age. The cycle
peaks around January every year and sinks to a minimum every summer. Secular (non-cyclical) trends
are also visible. Registered deaths of children less than 15 years old gradually decreased during the 2010s,
while those of adults aged 65–74 gradually increased. A model is necessary to adjust for both seasonality
and secular trends when calculating baselines for death rates during the COVID-19 pandemic.
I fit a generalized additive model (GAM) to all of the death counts from week 1 of 2010 through week
9 of 2020, the week ending 28 February 2020. When fitting the GAM I exclude March 2020 and following

months to avoid inflating the GAM’s baselines by contaminating them with COVID-19-associated deaths.
The model assumes that each registered-deaths count has a Poisson distribution, and uses the naturallogarithm function as its link function. My chosen GAM implementation is the gamm function in R’s
mgcv package, estimating smoothing parameters with the REML method.

index from 1 through 5, representing no holiday, the first Monday in May,1 the last Monday in August,
the spring bank holiday, and New Year’s Day); γ represents the change in registrations if the previous
week contained a particular secular holiday; LSH is SH with a 1-week lag (i.e. which secular holiday, if
any, the previous week contained); ω represents the change in registrations for each Easter or Christmas
holiday the week contains (or the previous week contained); ROY, ESTR and XMAS are the number of Royal

ESTR, and XMAS with a 1-week lag (i.e. how many Royal/Easter/Christmas holidays were in the previous

variables mentioned above; AQIMIN is the weekly minimum AQI; ζ represents how death registrations
vary with TRAN and AQIMIN; and s represents age-dependent (and sometimes sex-dependent) smooths of
week-of-year, of date, and temperature variables.
To decide whether to use smooths (s) or a simple linear multiplier (ζ) to relate a variable to death
registrations, and which age-dependent relationships had to be split into multiple relationships for different sexes, I fitted a maximally flexible GAM (i.e. one where all non-categorical variables were fitted with
sex-and-age-specific smooths). I reviewed the fitted relationships from that GAM to discern where I could
simplify the GAM (by collapsing multiple sex-specific smooths of a variable into one sex-independent
smooth, or by replacing a potentially nonlinear smooth with a simple linear relationship) without notable
underfitting. Appendix A discusses that review, and equation 1 is the review’s outcome: the simplified
model I use as my main GAM in this paper.

Fitted model of death registrations

Fitting the model to the time series of weekly death registrations produces a range of findings about the
relationships registered deaths have with sex, age, week of year, CET, and air quality (table 2, figs. 2,
3, 4, and 5) under normal circumstances.

Figure 2: Annual cycles in registered deaths estimated as relative registered deaths by week of year and
age band, measured on the GAM’s natural-log. scale. Confidence bands represent ±2 standard errors
around each estimated cycle. Age 0 is omitted because the GAM found no statistically significant cycle.
Beginning with the results for age and sex, registered deaths have a J-shaped relationship to age
regardless of sex (table 2). Children aged 1–14 suffer the fewest registered deaths, with more deaths
registered in a typical week among younger children (infants less than 12 months old) and adolescents
and adults. There are more registered deaths of males than of females in every age band, except in the
age-85+ age band, where the sex difference reverses and women average 68% more death registrations.
The results further reveal that, on average, when a public holiday occurs during a week, death
registrations are 10%–19% lower in that week, but 2%–11% higher the week after (table 2). Those
estimates comport with a naive back-of-envelope estimate that a one-day holiday might reduce a week’s
registrations by one fifth to one seventh, because register offices would effectively lose one of the week’s
5–7 working days, but could partially compensate by registering slightly more deaths the week after.2
Not all holidays are equal. Over the decade of the 2010s, only 10% fewer deaths were registered on Royal
Family-related holidays, but 19% fewer were registered for each Christmas holiday during a week — and
because most Christmas weeks include two public holidays (Christmas Day and Boxing Day), the model
implies that in a typical Christmas week, 34% fewer deaths would be registered.
Figure 2 plots s1,M,AGE (WK), the annual cycles the model estimates for each age band. The GAM finds
no statistically significant annual cycles in pre-adolescent children’s registered deaths, except for a minor
cycle for infant girls. In teenage boys and men aged up to 45, a somewhat inscrutable cycle emerges which
oscillates almost from month to month. Then, in all of the older age bands, death registrations have a
broadly U-shaped relationship to time of year, and this U-shaped cycle is marginally stronger in women.
Death registrations peak in the winter, trend downwards during spring, and reach a nadir in July and
August, before increasing as winter approaches. That overall cycle also includes some subtler features:
registrations tend to drop in November, between October’s rise and December’s rapid winter ramp-up,
and the V-shaped mini-cycle around weeks 10–15 tends to be mirrored by an opposing mini-cycle around
weeks 15–20.
The holiday multipliers and annual-cycle smooths account for the calendar cycle in registered deaths.
Figure 3 moves on to s2,M,AGE (WKEDAY), which estimates the secular trends in registered deaths over the
2 That the compensation is only partial implies at least one of the following: (i) fewer people die in holiday weeks,
(ii) register offices take multiple weeks to clear a typical backlog of yet-to-be-registered holiday-week deaths, and/or (iii)
register offices fail to register some holiday-week deaths entirely.

Figure 3: Secular trends in registered deaths by age band, measured on the GAM’s natural-log. scale.

the number of days since 1 Jan. 2010. Vertical dotted gridlines denote New Year’s Day, 2010–2020.
decade. That addresses the long-term trends in deaths due to slowly changing variables, most obviously
England and Wales’s growing population. Registered deaths of young children consistently decreased
throughout the 2010s, but trends were less encouraging at ages 15+. From 2010 through 2012, death
registrations of those aged 15–64 steadily decreased, but changed little thereafter. Finally, there is some
hetereogeneity among the trends for people aged 65+ (the trend for adults, especially women, aged
75–84 is curiously muted relative to the trends for 65–74-year-olds and those at least 85 years old),
but the graphs strongly suggest that they died in increasing numbers from 2010 until 2018. Those
increases cannot be put down to winter influenza because the annual-cycle smooths already account for
causes of death with a seasonal cycle (which include the average winter epidemic), and these long-term
secular-trend smooths average out the impact of any one worse-than-average winter flu epidemic.
3 more sets of smooths capture the relationship between CET and registered deaths (fig. 4). The
3 temperature variables the GAM uses are TMID, which captures how hot each week was on average;
TMDI, which captures how much hotter a week was than the week before it; and TRAN, which indexes
how variable temperature was during a week. The temperature during a week and inter-week shifts
in temperature prove more important than intra-week temperature variability; TMID and TMDI show
stronger relationships with registered deaths than TRAN.
TMID generally has a negative relationship with death registrations; mortality appears to be lower
in hot weeks, and that relationship is stronger in older adults than younger adults. TMDI, however,
tends to have a positive relationship with death registrations, suggesting that mortality is higher when
a week is warmer than the week before. TRAN is unusual in showing significantly different relationships
at different ages: a high/wide TRAN is associated with more registered deaths of those aged 15–44 and
fewer registered deaths of those aged 75+. The changing sign of the relationship between TRAN and
death registrations across different ages is arguably anomalous, but since the relationship is consistently
modest (and virtually nonexistent in those aged 1–14 or 65–74) the sign inconsistency would be a mild
anomaly in practical terms.
The remaining pieces of the GAM are the age-dependent fits of AQIMIN (fig. 5). AQIMIN correlates
positively with registered deaths, sometimes statistically significantly, which is consistent with earlier
epidemiological studies. When a week’s minimum national DAQI is elevated (i.e. when average national
air-pollution levels are elevated every day for a week), slightly more deaths of (pre)school-age children,

scale. Confidence bands extend ±2 standard errors around each fit.
middle-aged adults, and retirement-age adults are registered.
After studying the GAM’s individual components, the natural next step is to review the retrospective
baselines that the whole GAM produces. Figure 6 plots the GAM’s retrospective baselines against all of
the original data. The fits for each age band successfully reproduce each band’s overall rate of registered
deaths, and each band’s overall secular trend during the 2010s. The assumption that death registrations
are Poisson distributed implies that on the logarithmic-scale plot, the death counts should appear less
scattered around higher baselines, and that prediction is borne out; visually, there is a lot of vertical
scatter for children (where the baselines are lower), and less vertical scatter for older adults (where the
baselines are higher).
Focusing on the most-recent data and fits for the older age bands (fig. 7) demonstrates that the model
fails to precisely match every winter peak in registered old-age deaths. Checking this more systematically
by plotting the GAM’s relative errors for older adults by week of year (fig. 8) confirms that the GAM
has particular trouble fitting weeks 52–53 and 1–6. The most obvious explanation is that epidemics of
respiratory viruses like influenza and RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) each winter, and concomitant
peaks in secondary diseases such as pneumonia, are a major influence on old-age excess mortality in
the winter, and the sizes of those epidemics are somewhat random and difficult to predict [28, 29].
While respiratory-infection deaths do correlate with the weather and the season, it remains the case that
average temperatures, air quality, and the time of year do not fully account for all variation in deaths
from respiratory infections, so the GAM cannot account fully for idiosyncratically small or large winter
epidemics. One must bear this limitation in mind if using the GAM to produce baselines for winter
weeks, but it is unlikely to interfere much with estimating excess COVID-19 deaths because virtually all
UK COVID-19 deaths have occurred in week 11 or later of 2020, after the worst of the RSV/influenza
season.

3.3

Rationales for modelling choices

One could fit many slight variations on eq. 1, so I justify some of my modelling choices with my understanding of the data-generating process. A primary concern informing my modelling is balancing
parsimony against the introduction of bias by oversimplifying and underfitting my model.
Parsimony leads me to minimize how many interactions among variables I include in the GAM.

Figure 8: Actual weekly registered deaths divided by the GAM’s expected weekly registered deaths, for
every combination of (older) age band, sex (female observations in red and male observations in blue),
and week in the years 2010 through 2019. Ratios under 1 represent GAM overestimates and ratios over
1 underestimates. Red and circles represent female deaths; blue and diamonds represent male deaths.
Crudely, the GAM takes 7 quantities as inputs: age, sex, public-holiday status, week of the year (WK),
overall date, temperature, and air pollution. Thus there are 27 − 7 − 1 = 120 broad kinds of interaction
the GAM could include in principle, but ultimately I use only a few: the interaction of age, and, where
appropriate, sex, with each of WK, date, temperature, and air pollution.
I chose those interactions with age and sex because the results make clear that they are necessary.
Figures 2, 3, 4, and 5, along with appendix A, make plain that the relationships death registrations have
with WK, date, temperature, and air pollution differ by age and sometimes sex. By contrast, there is
strong theoretical reason not to have age or sex interact with holiday status. Death registrations dip
on public holidays (and then rebound) because many register offices close on public holidays. Closed
register offices register no deaths, regardless of the age and sex of the deceased. As such, public holidays
should have the same effect on death registrations regardless of age and sex, and trying to account for
different effects according to age and sex is pointless (if not actively harmful, inasmuch as it wastes
information in the data on superfluous parameters). I checked that theoretical expectation with a test
GAM by adding (linear, not smoothed) age-holiday interaction terms to a GAM and refitting it to the
death-registrations data. Most of the 84 newly added interaction terms were statistically insignificant
(p > 0.1), and 6 of the 14 original holiday-status terms became statistically insignificant, with 5 of the
14 implausibly becoming positive (i.e. implying that death registrations increased on average on those
holiday weeks). Those results support the dubiousness of putting interactions between demographic
variables and holiday status into a model of death registrations.
I exclude all 3-way and higher-order interactions from the model because such many-way interactions
are difficult (albeit not impossible) to justify a priori, are less readily interpretable than two-way interactions and single regressors’ relationships, and threaten to exhaust the information in the dataset. As an
example of the last risk, for each age band and sex, there are only 10 observations of deaths registered
on the last Monday in August, because that holiday occurs only 10 times in the period the ONS data
cover. There would therefore be only limited information to fit any 3-way interaction between age or
sex, holiday status, and any other variable.
The remaining interactions the GAM could include are two-way interactions not involving age or sex.
I exclude two-way interactions between non-age, non-sex variables and AQI because there is minimal
basis to expect them to be practically or statistically significant. AQI’s age-dependent relationships to
death registrations tend to be weak; in every adult age band, the highest observed values of AQIMIN

12

accompany death-registration rates at most 3% higher than average, and that remains so in a more
flexible GAM where AQI’s age-dependent relationships may differ by sex (appendix A). Prior research
gives no reason to expect AQI’s interactions with other variables to reveal a stronger relationship to
registered deaths, except perhaps AQI-temperature interactions, but my experiments with fitting GAMs
including AQIMIN-temperature interactions had unimpressive results.
I exclude the non-age, non-AQI two-way interactions because the non-age, non-AQI quantities are all
closely related: WK and holiday status are direct functions of the date, and average temperatures have a
roughly sinusoidal relationship to WK and date.
Parsimony also informs the maximum number of degrees of freedom (DOF) I allow gamm to use
for each of the AGE-dependent smooths. I limit every smooth of TMID, TMDI, TRAN, and AQIMIN to 3
DOF, since it is implausible that those variables’ age-specific relationships to registered deaths are much
more complex than S-shaped relationships, which 3 DOF suffice to represent. Each age band’s WKEDAY
smooth can use at most 5 DOF, which permits one inflection point per two years in fitted secular deathregistrations trend — enough flexibility to capture multiple shifts in the trend over time, but not so much
flexibility as to erroneously absorb individual years’ seasonal cycles. Finally, unlike the other smooths, I
force each age band’s WK smooth to be cyclic, since WK smooths represent annual cycles. I limit them to
12 DOF each, granting each WK smooth approximately monthly resolution. Allotting many more DOF
to the WK smooths would risk having them absorb some of the effect of public holidays which fall in the
same week each year.
Moving on from matters of parsimony, the residuals of a preliminary fit of the main GAM have slight
autocorrelation for the young age bands and medium-sized autocorrelation for old-age adults. So I fit
my model assuming AR(1) residuals within each combination of year and age band.3

3.4

Auxiliary models for imputing CET

The Hadley Centre publishes its daily CET data only for complete months, so temperature data for
the current month (June at the time of writing) are unavailable. That is irrelevant when fitting the
GAM, because I fit the GAM only to death counts for 2010 through 28 February 2020, over which period
complete CET data are already available. However, the lack of June data shall become an obstacle when
the ONS begins reporting death counts for weeks 23–27 and the GAM has to generate baselines for those
weeks, because the necessary current-month temperature data are missing.
Anticipating that problem, I fit additional simple GAMs to the known temperature data, GAMs
which I can later use to impute TMID, TMDI, and TRAN for the current month.
I fit a separate imputation GAM for all of the temperature variables except TRAN (because TRAN is
the difference of TMAX and TMIN, so imputing TMIN and TMAX with GAMs suffices to impute TRAN without
fitting a specific TRAN GAM). Every GAM includes a linear date trend, to exploit any consistent secular
trends over the 2010–2020 period, and a cyclic smooth of WK, to account for annual temperature cycles.
They also include smooths of the temperature variables TMIN, TMAX, TSD, TMID, and TMDI with a 1-week
lag, allowing the smooths only 3 DOF, enough to fit an S-shaped relationship. Finally, for parsimony, I
manually prune extraneous regressors from each GAM and refit them: ultimately, I impute TMID, TMDI,
and TRAN as functions of lagged TMID and lagged TSD. The imputation GAMs are therefore analogous to
regularized vector autoregression models, but gently nonlinearized and with a seasonal cycle also fitted.
A sensitivity analysis for weeks 18–19, presented in the previous version of this preprint when May
temperature data were unavailable, found that the GAM’s original May baselines might be wrong by at
most about 12% for adults due to the error arising from imputing temperatures. Fortunately, as of early
June, all necessary temperature data have been published, and I do no imputation of temperature data,
so my current results have no imputation error.

Estimation of excess registered deaths

I use the fitted GAM to generate baselines for each age band during this year, and compare the ONS’s
recent counts to the baselines. Close-up visual comparisons of the ONS’s death counts to the GAM’s
3 Ideally

I would fit the model with AR(1) residuals within just each age band, but that proves computationally difficult
for gamm. Fortunately, the autocorrelation is not overwhelming (the final model estimates φ = 0.3), so slicing the data into
year-long chunks when fitting the AR(1) residual structure does not unduly compromise the model.

Figure 10: Stacked area charts of recent registered deaths (women’s in the left panel, men’s in the right
panel) in older age bands, baselines (areas between adjacent solid lines, with approximate standard errors
shown as translucent grey bands around solid lines) and excesses (areas between a dashed line and an
adjacent line).
baselines for older ages are in figure 9. The observations, plotted as individual circles for women and as
individual diamonds for men, run through week 21 of 2020.
The ONS reports 108 registered deaths “where COVID-19 was mentioned on the death certificate” in
weeks 11 and 12 of this year, but registered deaths in those weeks were nonetheless close to the baselines
in all of the older age bands. In week 13, death registrations increased on week 12 and were mostly above
their baselines; moreover, for men aged 75 and up, registered deaths in week 13 were above the baselines’
95% confidence intervals. In week 14, death registrations accelerated greatly, producing a statistically
significant excess of deaths in each of the older age bands. Simple visual examination of the plots reveals
about 600, 1000, 2000, and 2000 excess registered deaths in age bands 45–64, 65–74, 75–84 and 85+
respectively in week 14, for a total of approximately 5600 excess deaths. The numbers of excess deaths
in each of weeks 15–17 were greater still.
Table 3 collects, for each of weeks 12 through 21 and every adolescent and adult age band, the precise
baselines from the GAM, the actual number of registered deaths, the implied number of excess registered
deaths, and the ONS’s report of COVID-19-associated deaths. The precise numbers reveal that despite a
modest number of their death certificates mentioning COVID-19, the number of excess registered deaths
was negligible for adolescents and young adults even into April, although excess registered deaths among
15–44-year-olds achieved statistical significance in week 15, and maintained significance in weeks 16 and
17. More dramatically, among people aged 45 and up, there were 83 ± 436, 625 ± 398, 5651 ± 417,
9181 ± 525, and 12,656 ± 581 excess registered deaths in weeks 12 through 16 respectively.4 After excess
registered deaths in that age range peaked in week 16, they declined through weeks 17, 18, and 19 to
10,520 ± 495, 7693 ± 361, and 3785 ± 362 respectively. Week 20 brought a slight uptick to 4343 ± 310
deaths, followed in week 21 by a dip to 2047 ± 544 deaths.
Summing over weeks 12–21 by calendar month, and pro-rating deaths in weeks that cross month
boundaries, produces approximate monthly estimates of 3937 ± 1072, 41,386 ± 2089, and 11,274 ± 1268
excess registered deaths of adults aged 45+ in March, April, and the first 22 days of May respectively.
4 To obtain standard errors of the all-ages weekly totals, I do not sum the individual standard errors in quadrature, but
rather sum them in the direct and conventional fashion, lest a given week’s errors across age bands be highly correlated.

Table 3: Baseline versus observed counts of all deaths, and ONS counts of COVID-19-associated deaths,
registered in England and Wales in weeks 12–21 of 2020. “±” symbols denote approximate standard
errors. Under-15s’ results omitted due to minimal C19 deaths (ONS-documented or excess).

16

Setting aside May as incomplete, 45,323 ± 3161 excess deaths were registered through the end of April.
Considering all of weeks 12–21, 56,597 ± 4429 excess deaths were registered through 22 May. Sex-specific
data and baselines (appendix B) enable an estimate of the sex distribution of those excess deaths: about
29,744, or 53%, were of men. Decomposing the results by age as well as sex belies that near-even split:
men made up about 61% of excess deaths at ages 45–84, but only about 42% of excess deaths at ages
85+.
Figure 10 illustrates the emergence of excess deaths in recent weeks differently, graphically stacking
the older age bands’ weekly death counts by sex to make them comparable on one scale. It demonstrates
how much total (registered-)death rates increased among older men and older women. Crudely, in weeks
15 and 16 total registered deaths doubled in each older age band, so COVID-19 roughly doubled the
hazard rate of death for people aged 45+. Closer inspection shows that the increase in risk itself increased
with age: in weeks 16 and 17 excess registered deaths of the 85+ visibly outnumbered the baseline death
count, but the ratio of excess registered deaths to baseline was somewhat less at ages 45–64. The
diagram also shows that excess registered deaths were not only concentrated in the oldest of the old, but
that their excess mortality accelerated the most. In later weeks, registered deaths of women remained
concentrated in the 85+ age band; this is consistent with the old-age population sex ratio being skewed
towards women, and disproportionate circulation of SARS-CoV-2 in care homes inhabited mostly by the
old [30, 31, 32, 33].
Comparing the excess-deaths estimates to the ONS’s counts of COVID-19-associated deaths suggests
that the ONS numbers undercounted people who died, directly or indirectly, because of COVID-19, and
that the undercounting was worse in April than in May. The ONS reported 102, 531, 3432, 6139, 8655,
8134, 5983, 3889, 3776, 2559 “[d]eaths where COVID-19 was mentioned on the death certificate” among
people aged 45+ in weeks 12–21 respectively. The first two counts (102 in week 12 and 531 in week 13) do
not differ significantly from the relatively noisy GAM-based excess-death estimates, but the subsequent
ONS counts are only 61%, 67%, 68%, 77%, 78%, 103%, 87%, and 125% respectively of the GAM-based
excess-death estimates. Contrary to the commentators quoted in this paper’s introduction, counting the
known deaths of those who died with COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 has tended to under estimate how many
have died from COVID-19, not over estimate.

5

Conclusion

This study addresses the concern that COVID-19 has been blamed for too many deaths, an error which
could occur if official COVID-19 death counts include too many false positives. To test for that putative
error, I develop a statistical model of historical rates of registered deaths, and compare the baselines
that model produces to the actual number of deaths registered during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The comparison gives only a weak statistical signal of excess deaths in week 12 of 2020, but reveals
that in weeks 13 through 21 — i.e. from 21 March through 22 May — of 2020, England and Wales
registered 56,769 ± 4931 excess deaths of adolescents and adults, versus the 43,582 registered deaths the
ONS reported “where COVID-19 was mentioned on the death certificate”. COVID-19 appears to have
been blamed for too few deaths, not too many, at least over those 9 weeks. The true number of registered
deaths for which COVID-19 is (directly or indirectly) responsible is likely to be (30 ± 11)% higher than
the number of registered deaths where the death certificate mentions the disease.
The UK’s Department of Health and Social Care provides more up-to-date counts of COVID-19associated deaths than the ONS, though (until 29 April) their counts of such deaths in England included
only people who died in NHS-commissioned medical facilities. The Department counted 2053 people with
COVID-19 who died in England and 81 who died in Wales during week 21, for a total of 2134 deaths
[2]. During that week, therefore, about ((44 + 241 + 155 + 536 + 1115) ÷ 2053) = 1.02 excess deaths were
registered for each Department-reported, COVID-19-associated death. If the same ratio obtains for the
2388 deaths the Department has reported for 23 May through 31 May [2], the true number of COVID-19
deaths in England and Wales from 23 May through 31 May may be closer to 2436 (2388 multiplied by
1.02). Adding that to the estimate of 56,597 excess registered deaths in the 9 weeks leading up to 23 May,
the ultimate number of COVID-19 deaths registered (even if not all recognized as COVID-19 deaths) in
England and Wales through May’s end could be about 59,033, if deaths have been underreported at a
steady rate since mid-May.
My work has multiple limitations. Although it investigates one means of avoiding false-positive errors,

17

it is susceptible to false-negative errors. My estimates of excess registered deaths can capture only net
deaths due to the COVID-19 pandemic. If the response to the pandemic saves some Britons’ lives
(perhaps by reducing air pollution [34, 35] or motor accidents or attacks of non-COVID-19 infectious
diseases) while the pandemic itself kills thousands, my approach would detect only the net effect of both
taken together, which would underestimate the gross number of deaths due to COVID-19. On the other
hand, if the response to the pandemic causes more Britons to die (theoretically possible if the lockdown
induces fatal stress or prevents people from obtaining medical attention), my approach would conflate
people killed by the response with people killed directly by the pandemic.
The geographical scope of my analysis is quite tightly bounded, confined exclusively to England and
Wales, not the entire United Kingdom (although data exist in principle to extend it to the entire UK),
nor a wider range of countries.
A last complication is mortality displacement, also known as “harvesting” [36], which is the phenomenon of a fatal condition killing people only slightly earlier than they otherwise would have died. In
the specific case of COVID-19, it could be that even if all people who die with COVID-19 die because of
COVID-19, some of them would not have lived much longer even if they had never caught COVID-19.
If so, and if one blames COVID-19 only for killing those people whose lives it shortened by years, and
not for killing people whose lives it shortened by days or weeks, then one can interpret my excess-deaths
estimates as overestimates of people killed by COVID-19. Recent research [37] and actuarial commentary
[38] suggest that such mortality displacement is minor, but longer-term data are necessary to exclude
it entirely. If England and Wales suppress the spread of SARS-CoV-2 early in the summer, the weeks
immediately after (or at least between waves of) the pandemic might have fewer deaths than the baselines, which would suggest mortality displacement: COVID-19 would have killed in the spring people
who would otherwise have died in the summer.5 Also possible, perhaps even probable, is the opposite
outcome — excess deaths could persist beyond the pandemic’s acute phase, as they did, for example,
after London’s Great Smog of 1952 [39].

Corrigenda

The 23 April version of this preprint (i ) erroneously gave the reference to the DH&SC’s daily death
counts [2] an access date of 21 April rather than the correct 22 April; (ii ) referred in its conclusion to
“the subsequent 8466 hospital deaths from 11 April through 20 April” when the end of the relevant
period was actually 22 April, not 20 April; (iii ) gave the ratio of excess registered deaths to reported
in-hospital deaths in week 15 as 1.91 rather than 1.90; and (iv ) used an outdated caption for table 3
where “weeks 12–14” should have been “weeks 12–15”.
The 28 April version of this preprint included an outdated table 3 (of expected versus observed counts)
where the baselines and standard errors and hence excess-death estimates came from the older GAM
without AQI as an input. Its conclusion also asserted that this study “estimates excess registered deaths
only as a function of time and approximate age”, omitting the additional (albeit also time-dependent)
inputs of ambient temperature and AQI.
The 3 May version of this preprint wrongly opened section 4 with the clause “After imputing temperatures for April,”, a phrase mistakenly retained from the previous version.

5 Unusually low death rates immediately after an acute phase of the pandemic might also reflect an ongoing stay-at-home
order, if many people remain at home even when COVID-19 deaths are low, and staying at home turns out to prevent a
substantial proportion of non-COVID-19 deaths.

Guiding modelling choices with a trial full age-sex GAM

The ONS publishes provisional weekly counts of deaths broken down in two ways, namely by region
alone, and by sex and age band. There is no 3-way breakdown by sex and age band and region, which
forces a choice of which breakdown to use when fitting a model: the region-only breakdown versus the
age-and-sex breakdown. Because age is the variable with the most relevance to COVID-19 mortality,
and because the age-by-sex breakdown is somewhat finer-grained than the regional breakdown, I choose
to base my modelling on the age-by-sex breakdown rather than the regional breakdown.
The next modelling choice is whether, for each numerical input (WK, WKEDAY, TMID, TMDI, TRAN,
AQIMIN) in the model, the main GAM should (i ) use only one smooth of the input, (ii ) use one smooth
for all males and a second smooth for all females, (iii ) use a different smooth for each age band but not
for different sexes, or (iv ) use a different smooth for every combination of age and sex. The last option
would be the obvious choice if the available data and computer-processing time were infinite, but finite
data and CPU time imply that a less complex model (i.e. one of options i, ii, and iii ) may be most
appropriate.
To decide the best kind of fit for each numerical input, I fit the most complex kind of model — one
with a different smooth for every combination of age, sex, and numerical input — as a trial, and compare
its smooths across ages and sexes to ascertain where fitting different smooths for different ages/sexes
is necessary, or merely introducing unneeded complexity. I also check the nonlinearity of each input’s
fitted smooths in the full model, to discern whether nonlinear smooths are necessary. Where it seems
reasonable to simplify by fitting a linear relationship rather than a more-general nonlinear smooth, by
using the same smooth for males and females, and/or by using the same smooth across all age bands, I
make the simplification in the main baseline-generating GAM I use in the main analyses and text.
Figure 11 presents the fitted smooths that relate WK, the week of the year, to registered deaths for
every age-sex combination. Death registrations have no relationship to WK for children aged 1–14, but at
other ages annual cycles are apparent. Annual cycles are plainest among middle-aged and older adults,
becoming stronger in older age bands. Registered deaths of retirement-age women and of retirement-age
men have qualitatively similar annual cycles, but the cycle is systematically slightly stronger in women.

Figure 11: Annual cycles in registered deaths estimated as relative registered deaths by week of year
and age band and sex (red denoting females and blue males), measured on the GAM’s natural-log. scale.
Confidence bands represent ±2 standard errors around each estimated cycle.
That feature of the data, along with the female-specific relationship between registered deaths and WK in
infants, and the male-specific relationship between registered deaths and WK in adolescents and younger
adults, indicates that fitting different smooths for males and for females is appropriate for WK. The
smooths are also clearly different across different age bands, so fitting different smooths for each age
band is also indicated.
Figure 12 presents secular trends, fitted as smooths relating date to registered deaths for every agesex combination. There are undeniable differences in the trends with age; for example, registered deaths
of young children steadily declined during the 2010s, but registered deaths of adults aged 85+ steadily
increased from 2010 until 2017. Within each under-75 age band, the smooth for males is similar to the
smooth for females, but at ages 75–84 and especially for adults aged 85+ the male and female smooths are
statistically and practically discrepant; the oldest men experienced a more relentless increase in registered
deaths during the 2010s than the oldest women. I therefore use a different secular-trend smooth for every
combination of sex and age band in my main baseline-generating GAM.
Figure 13 presents the fitted smooths relating temperature to registered deaths for every age-sex
combination. Each smooth is limited to 3 DOF because it is implausible that mortality would have an
intricate relationship to a given temperature variable. In spite of the limited DOF, some of the smooths
for older age bands are visibly nonlinear, although the TRAN smooths’ deviations from nonlinearity
are minute in absolute terms (at most 0.03 on the natural-log. scale) and unambiguously statistically
significant only for men aged 85+. In my main GAM, therefore, I fit only linear relationships between
TRAN and registered deaths. However, I fit a separate linear TRAN-mortality relationship for each age-sex
combination, because the smooths in the full trial model differ substantially across age bands and, at
age 0, differ significantly for boys versus girls.
I make a different simplification for TMDI. TMDI’s smooths are substantially nonlinear for the oldest
adults, so I continue using nonlinear smooths in the main GAM. I also fit a different TMDI smooth for
each age band, accounting for heterogeneity in smooths across age bands. The male-female differences
in smooths within each age band, by contrast, are statistically and practically insignificant for every age
band except 1–14, and the difference in the 1–14 age band is practically insignificant (less than 0.04 on

the natural-log. scale across the entire range of TMDI values).
I make no simplifications for TMID; that is, I fit 14 nonlinear smooths relating TMID to death registrations, one nonlinear smooth for each age-sex combination represented in the data. In the full age-sex
model, the TMID smooths have clear nonlinearities for older age bands, and multiple statistically and
practically significant sex and age differences, indicating that the full complexity is necessary.
The final set of smooths to review is that of AQIMIN (figure 14). Only two of the 14 fitted smooths
— those for women aged 45–64 and women aged 85+ — are nonlinear. One of those two (the smooth
for women aged 85+) deviates from linearity to a statistically insignificant extent; the other deviates
only minimally from linearity in absolute terms (at most 0.03 on the natural-log. scale). Replacing the
nonlinear smooths with linear fits in my main GAM is therefore an acceptable simplification. On balance,
I also decide that collapsing together sexes within each age band is also acceptable. The male-female
differences within age bands are consistently small, and while some of the differences are statistically
significant, some of the sex-specific smooths have implausible negative gradients (implying decreasing
mortality with worse air quality) which would be averaged out by using only one smooth per age band.
All in all, making both simplifications (substituting linear fits for nonlinear smooths, and using the same
fit for males and females within an age band) is likely to give more sensible results than those produced
by the full trial model which fits a different smooth for every age-sex combination (figure 14).
This appendix’s model simplifications reduce the time taken to fit the main GAM from 12.9 hours to
3.6 hours, and are of minimal detriment to the GAM’s closeness of fit (the adjusted R2 remained 0.992).

Estimates of excess registered deaths by sex

The main text tabulates the weekly estimates of excess registered deaths by age band in table 3. This
appendix disaggregates the estimates by sex, in table 4. In both tables the “±” symbol denotes approximate standard errors of the GAM’s baselines. Here those standard errors are the GAM’s sex-specific,
root-mean-squared (RMS) log.-scale errors for the relevant week of the year in every year of the 2010s.
(The phrase “log.-scale errors” describes, for each week of the 2010s, the natural logarithm of the ratio
of the actual number of deaths registered to the GAM’s baseline.)
