Abstract -

of the key vital signs [14]. The accepted mean value
for normal human body temperature measured orally is
37°C (98.6°F). However newer research indicates that the
average may actually be closer to 36.6°C (97.9°F) [15].
Each individual has their normal body temperature, which
varies slightly from the ideal value. Human body temperature constantly adapts to its environmental conditions. A
body temperature of 38°C (100.4°F) or more is considered to be a fever [16]. The most recent viral epidemics
have had fever as the most common symptom (e.g., Ebola,
SARS, H1N1 [17], and COVID-19 [18]). It is evident that
fever detection is one of the key components in screening.

With COVID-19 disrupting operations across various sectors of the workforce (e.g., offices, airports, libraries, schools),
preventative measures enabling resumption of work are
quickly becoming a necessity. In this paper, we present the
need for Vitals Screening Techniques (VIST) where more
than one vital is screened to ensure the safety of the population (e.g. temperature, heart rate, and blood oxygen levels).
VIST can be deployed in crowded environments to provide
the new necessary layer of safety. We provide extensive coverage of state-of-art technology that can assist in tackling this
emerging problem, and evaluate one of the existing products
on the market that employ VIST.

All current screening techniques rely on remote body
temperature measurements. There are two problems that
must be acknowledged when measuring the body temperature: i) normal body temperature variation; ii) infrared
thermal imaging limitations. Body temperature can fluctuate based on the region selected for measurement [19, 20].
Furthermore, research has shown that body temperature
is a nonlinear function of several variables such as age,
state of health, gender, environmental temperature, time
of the diurnal cycle, and among many others [14]. On
average, healthy elderly people have lower body temperature compared to younger adults [14]. The human body is
constantly adapting its temperature to environmental conditions (e.g., goes up in the afternoon and lower at night).
Despite these minor variations, elevated body temperature
is still a universally accepted indicator of fever.

Introduction

The COVID-19 Pandemic has fundamentally changed
society’s perspective [1] on common spaces (e.g., airports, schools, commercial establishments). The ’new
normal‘ has heralded a new age of technological innovations, from contact tracing, telemedicine to newer screening methods[2]. Although temperature screening has been
widely implemented [3, 4] as a way to safely reopen, multivital screening provides greater insight into the health of
an individual. Vital signs, including temperature, blood
oxygen levels and heart rate, are the easiest and most critical data points gathered from an individual to assess their
general health. [5].
In emergency settings, patients have to be prioritized
and guided to the correct place of treatment (“triage”)
largely based on their vital signs [6, 7, 8, 9]. Vitals screening methods are applied to high throughput areas (e.g.,
airports, businesses, warehouses, factories), especially in
the case of a global pandemic [10]. One of the vitals that
is important during screening is heart rate. Elevated heart
rate (Tachycardia) is a telltale sign associated with fever in
the case of viral respiratory infections [11]. Another vital
that can be helpful is blood oxygen levels (SpO2). Low
blood oxygen levels were seen before the onset of a fever
in many COVID-19 patients [12] and can indicate underlying signs of other viral diseases [13]. Body temperature,
heart rate, and blood oxygen levels together provide further
insight into the health of an individual.
Human body temperature is well established as one

Remote body temperature screening is a fast, noninvasive alternative to conventional clinical thermometers
for monitoring body temperature [21, 20]. Average external body temperature (peripheral skin temperature) is 24°C (3.6-7.2°F) less than the core temperature [19]. Therefore, mean body temperature must be calculated from
external (or skin) temperature using an estimation algorithm. Infrared radiation emitted by a surface depends
on the environmental conditions such as moisture, airflow
and surrounding temperature [22, 23]. Other factors that
impact temperature sensing are ambient temperature drift
and aging of the sensor. An individual’s thermal state
also affects the radiated heat (e.g., running, coming from
cold environments, etc). Further, the distance and angle of
the thermal camera relative to the subject plays a critical
role in the sensor’s fidelity. Blackbody devices (temper1

ature references) are known to solve the issues related to
ambient temperature and sensor aging, improving the accuracy of the sensor. However, they are often forgone due
to the cost or complexity of deployment [24]. Remote
body temperature sensing is an ideal alternative to clinical
thermometers that are sometimes cumbersome and often
require an attendant [21, 25].
Beyond temperature sensing, blood oxygen levels are
used to infer any impairment in lung function [26]. Blood
oxygen level is usually measured with a pulse oximeter
(finger clip). A resting oxygen saturation level between
95% and 100% is regarded as normal for a healthy person at sea level, and below 95% is considered abnormal [27, 28, 29, 30]. Low blood oxygen can serve as
an indicator to many different viral pneumonias [12]. The
recent global pandemic (i.e. COVID-19) has demonstrated
that many people can have dangerously low oxygen levels,
without showing any other symptoms (’silent hypoxemia’)
[31]. The detection of low oxygen levels in asymptomatic
individuals can facilitate early diagnosis of an underlying illness. Blood oxygen measurement serves as a key
component of Vital Screening.
Heart rate is measured through pulse oximeters, in addition to blood oxygen levels. The American Heart Association defines the normal sinus heart rate as between
60 and 100 bpm at rest [32, 33, 11] (it is important to
note that athletes often have heart rates below 60 bpm
at rest). Tachycardia is observed in case of anemia, intake of caffeine, and exercise [34]. Tachycardia is seen
concomitantly with fever due to an increase in the Basal
Metabolic Rate and cardiac output. In one study, when
the temperature rose by 1°C (1.8°F) due to fever, the heart
rate increased on the average by 8.5 beats per minute [11].
Thus, tachycardia, when seen along with fever, can point
to possible infection.
Pulse oximetry technology involves shining light at specific wavelengths through tissue (most commonly the fingernail bed) and using a detector to determine the amount
of light that passes through [35, 36]. There are several
inherent limitations to pulse oximetry. One of the common examples of interfering factors is poor signal due
to certain nail polish and artificial fingernails [37]. Poor
peripheral perfusion because of cold, hypotension, or Raynaud’s disease is the principal cause for failure to obtain a
satisfactory signal, mainly because of an inadequate pulse
wave [29, 35]. Motion artifacts can interfere with signal
detection because of an unstable waveform. Improperly
seated sensors, shivering, seizures, or tremors can cause
movement leading to inaccurate readings. Pulse oximetry, despite its limitations, is universally recognized as an
essential vital measurement tool.
The need to take preventative measures to prepare for
inevitable future outbreaks is apparent. We present a so-

lution using existing sensors: Vital Screening Techniques
(VIST). VIST involves scanning individual’s multiple vitals within seconds using robust sensors. It provides the
added layer of safety needed to move past COVID-19 pandemic.

Vitals Screening Techniques

VIST encompasses any device that measures more than
one independent vital( e.g., body temperature, heart rate,
and blood oxygen level) of an individual. VIST devices
usually have built in sensors in the form of thermal cameras
and pulse oximeters. Most of the products display the
readings on a user-friendly interface. A live video feed
usually allows the user to adjust their positioning. VIST
allows for the rapid mass screening of individuals to ensure
a safe environment.
For external temperature sensing, thermal cameras are
used to obtain targets’ radiated temperature. The thermal
camera should ideally be set up in a room temperature
environment [38, 39, 40]. Measurements should be made
only at a fixed distance, with the subject directly facing the
camera. The incorporation of a blackbody device allows
for higher accuracy in the narrow range of normal human
body temperature. The subject should acclimatize to room
temperature for a few minutes prior to measurement. Per
the FDA [25], it is recommended to measure one person
at a time.
In pulse oximetry, blood oxygen levels and heart rate
are measured through the process of photoplethysmography (PPG). PPG is a non-invasive technology that uses a
light source and a photodetector at the surface of the skin
(finger-tip) to measure the volumetric variations of blood
circulation with a resulting waveform. Pulse oximeters
can incorporate either the transmissive or reflective mode.
In the transmissive mode, the light sources and the photodiode are opposite to each other with the measurement
site between them [41]. In the reflective mode, the light
sources and photodiode are on the same side, and light is
reflected to the photodiode across the measurement site.
The transmissive mode is not only the most commonly
used method, it is the only clinically approved one, because of its high accuracy and stability. The clip-style of
the pulse oximeter probe eliminates some of the errors due
to finger movement. The only drawback of the clip style
is that it is difficult to clean and cannot incorporate UV-C
disinfection.
A pulse oximeter used in mass screening is a hightouch surface with the potential for disease transmission.
Ultraviolet (UV-C) sterilization is one method that may
be incorporated to address this concern. UV-C’s effectiveness against different strains of viruses has long been
established [42]. Studies show that UV-C light at 267
and 279 nm was very effective at inactivating the Coron2

weighted estimation algorithm is used adjust skin temperature to body temperature. Only one exposed region is
necessary to obtain a reading, allowing for accurate temperature readings from individuals with head coverings,
masks, etc.
We find that Famidoc has ±0.09°C (0.17°F) precision
and Braun has ±0.12°C (0.21°F) precision. On average,
Famidoc and Braun are about 0.40°C (0.72°F) from each
others measurements. We find that Braun cannot measure people of lower than average body temperature (e.g.
body temperature of 96°F or less). For lower body temperature individuals, we find that Famidoc performs better
than Braun, however with degraded accuracy and precision
performance. Soter’s temperature sensor retains precision
of ±0.28°C (0.51°F) and accuracy of ±0.15°C (0.27°F)
compared to Braun. Compared to Famidoc, Soter’s thermal sensor has an accuracy of ±0.18°C (0.33°F) Further,
Soter’s sensor is able to robustly detect those individual’s
with generally lower than average body temperature with
high precision and accuracy relative to Braun and Famidoc. The average scan time of Soter’s temperature sensor is
4.76 seconds. Further, we find that Soter’s sensor yielded
100% completed scans, unlike Braun, 97.5% (Famidoc
had 100% completed scans). This shows that Soter’s sensor can detect larger population than the Braun sensors.
Heart Rate and Blood Oxygen Soter’s product line
offers various fully-integrated pulse oximeters available
in different form factors (open design, clip etc.). All of
Soter’s pulse oximeters use transmissive PPG technology.
Here, we evaluate the off-the-shelf, medical-grade, FDA
approved pulse oximeter (Nonin 3231)1. We find the average pulse oximetry scan time is 7.7 seconds from our
testing. Nonin 3231 yielded 100% successfully completed
scans. This pulse oximeter is FDA approved and has undergone a clinical study with a stated accuracy of ±1.31%
between 70-100% blood oxygen [52]. Heart rate accuracy

avirus [43].Recent studies have shown the chance of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (through inanimate surfaces) is
less frequent than previously recognised [44]. The improper exposure to UV-C radiation poses risks to human’s
skin and eyes. UV-C can be offered as an optional feature to alleviate concerns amongst the general public about
touching this high-contact surface.

Evaluation

In this section, we evaluate Soter Technologies’ sensors
that are available for licensing, as well as full-integrated
in products of various form factors (e.g., kiosk, handheld,
gateway, etc.).

Sensors Fidelity

We compare Soter’s sensors against other sensors on the
market. The thermal sensor is compared against Braun
thermometer [45] and Famidoc [46]. Braun has FDA
510(K) Pre-market Notification, and Famidoc passed the
EU standards for infrared thermometers accuracy. To the
best of our knowledge, there is no existing remote thermal
scanner that is FDA approved. The experiments were done
over 20 different individuals with age ranges from 23 to 65
and various skin pigments. For each test, 10 samples were
collected leading to total of 250 scans per each sensor.

Table 1. In-depth comparison between existing products in the market [47, 48, 49, 50, 51]. The table shows
existing sensors that provide reliable temperature sensing by combining known techniques, thus enabling the
highest sensing accuracy (e.g., facial detection, blackbody usage, etc.). We also show existing products in the
market that support pulse oximetry sensor to provide oxygen levels and heart rate readings.

is ±3 digits between 20-250 bpm.
The Nonin 3231 clip pulse oximeter measures a wide
range of heart rates: 18 – 321 beats per minute. It can
measure blood oxygen levels between 0-100%. The ratio between the amplitude of the red light at 660nm and
infrared light at 910nm wavelength is used to determine
oxygen saturation. The pulse oximeter requires only 2
beats and uses an averaging algorithm to obtain an accurate heart rate. Longer scan times (with more readings
taken) will result in more accurate pulse oximetry values.

after every use. To our knowledge, there is currently no
FDA approved medical finger pulse oximeter with UV-C
disinfection capability.
Remote respiratory rate is in development. There
is no established technology that can remotely measure
the respiratory rate with high confidence. Nonetheless,
there is recent work with various technology to estimate
and measure the respiratory rate (thermal sensing [53],
mmwave [54]). Given the current issues remote respiratory rate technology is facing (e.g., random individual
vibrations, and better sensors required), it is not mature yet
for the consumer market. However, to obtain a valid respiratory rate reading with high confidence, the individual
has to get scanned for a long duration (e.g., > 10 seconds)
to obtain a valid reading, since respiratory rate is much
lower than heart rate (5-20).

User Experience

As an example of existing products’ user interfaces,
SymptomSense provides a user friendly interface (Figure
1) where users can read their results (either vital values
or pass/fail) right after screening. Figure 1 shows a completed scan with temperature, heart rate and blood oxygen
readings (on the left of the interface), and pulse oximetry
scan complete (on the right). Once readings are obtained,
visual indicators are used to indicate if the individual has
passed the screening or not per the ranges of acceptable
pass defined by the system operator.

Screening best practices. The FDA [55, 56, 38, 39,
40, 25] has provided proper guidelines on screening best
practices (including thermal camera environment and calibration). Soter’s sensors make the process of following the
FDA procedure easier as they have self-calibrated blackbody based thermal system that shows final output to the
user. Soter does not claim to do multi-person detection

Discussion

UV-C and standard medical pulse oximeter. There is
a shift to incorporate UV-C into pulse oximeters. Soter’s
proprietary pulse oximeter with optional UV-C is currently
in the final phase of development. This pulse oximeter
utilizes a double-fail safe to automatically turn off when
a finger is detected ensuring limited exposure to harmful
UV-C rays. 275 nm of UV-C light (limited to the contact area) disinfects the surface for a 30 second duration

HIPAA compliance. Most of the screening systems
do not store or retain any information about the user and
their vitals, it only shows the vital results for a brief moment. Facial recognition technology is currently not implemented in the SymptomSense product-line, Thus, there
is no need for HIPAA clearance, hence anonymized vital
screening [57].
