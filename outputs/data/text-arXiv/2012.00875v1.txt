Abstract
The spread of infectious diseases is a major challenge in our contemporary world, especially after the recent outbreak
of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The quarantine strategy is one of the important intervention measures to
control the spread of an epidemic by greatly minimizing the likelihood of contact between infected and susceptible
individuals. In this study, we analyze the impact of various stochastic disturbances on the epidemic dynamics during the
quarantine period. For this purpose, we present an SIQS epidemic model that incorporates the stochastic transmission
and the Lévy noise in order to simulate both small and massive perturbations. Under appropriate conditions, some
interesting asymptotic properties are proved, namely: ergodicity, persistence in the mean, and extinction of the disease.
The theoretical results show that the dynamics of the perturbed model are determined by parameters that are closely
related to the stochastic noises. Our work improves many existing studies in the field of mathematical epidemiology
and provides new techniques to predict and analyze the dynamic behavior of epidemics.

1. Introduction
The study of infectious diseases has long been a subject where epidemiological issues are combined with financial
and social problems [12, 2, 7, 18, 19]. The rapid spread of COVID-19 these days shows that humanity stills suffer
from epidemics that may lead to the collapse of medical and economic systems. By isolating infected individuals and
quarantining the susceptible population at home, many countries have basically controlled the outbreak of COVID-19
[24, 13]. In order to analyze the impact of this strategy on the spread of epidemics and to predict their future behavior,
we use different mathematical formulations according to their characteristics [20, 23, 21]. In this study, we consider
an SIQS epidemic model in the form of ordinary differential equations (ODEs for short). These ODEs describe the
evolution of susceptible S(t), infected I(t), and isolated Q(t) individuals as time functions. The rates of change and
the interactions between different population classes in our case are expressed by the following deterministic model
[8]:

the parameters appearing in this system are described as follows:

µ1 is the natural death rate.
δ is the isolation rate.
r2 is the disease-related mortality rate.
r3 is the death rate associated with the disease under isolation intervention. For simplicity, we denote µ2 =
µ1 + r2 and µ3 = µ1 + r3 as a general mortality rates.

All parameters are usually assumed to be positive. The schematic flow diagram of the model (1) is illustrated in
Figure 1. Herbert et al. [8] proved that the basic reproduction number of the deterministic model (1) is expressed by
R0 = µ1 (µ2βA
+δ+γ) . This parameter is an essential quantity to predict whether a disease will persist or not. If R0 ≤ 1,
the model (1) has only the disease-free equilibrium E ⊖ = (A/µ1 , 0, 0) which is globally asymptotically stable, and if
R0 > 1, E ⊖ becomes unstable and there exists a global asymptotically stable endemic equilibrium E ⊛ = (S ⊛ , I ⊛ , Q⊛ ),

The spread of infectious diseases can undergo random disturbances and stochastic phenomena due to environmental fluctuations [1, 16, 10]. Since disturbed models can describe many practical problems very well, many types of
stochastic differential equations have been used to analyze various epidemic models in recent years [9, 11, 26]. There
are two common ways to introduce stochastic factors into epidemic systems. The first one is to assume that the
transmission of the diseases is subject to some small random fluctuations which can be described by the Gaussian
white noise [30, 31, 28]. The other one is to admit that the model parameters are affected by massive environmental
perturbations like the climate changes, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, etc [33, 37]. For a better explaination to these
phenomena, the use of a compensated Poisson process into the population dynamics provides an appropriate and more
realistic context [32]. Considering these two types of random disturbances, many works have analyzed the asymptotic
behaviors of various epidemic models, including persistence in the mean, extinction, and ergodicity [35, 33, 37, 29, 3].
These interesting researches have served an important role in the stochastic modeling of epidemics. But, all these
models have considered either the standard white Gaussian noise or the Lévy jumps. In this work, we combine these
two perturbations by treating an SIQS epidemic model that simultaneously includes the stochastic transmission and
the discontinuous Lévy process. This original idea extends the studies presented in [3, 32] and gives us a general view
of the disease dynamics under different scenarios of random perturbations.
The threshold analysis of perturbed epidemic systems is very important for understanding and controlling of the
disease spread. In our case, the deterministic model (1) will be perturbed not only by white noise but also by Lévy
jumps, which makes its analysis more complicated and needs some new techniques and methods. During this study,
we aim to develop a mathematical approach to prove the existence of a unique ergodic stationary distribution and
persistence in the mean of the new perturbed model. Without using the classical Lyapunov method presented in [14],
we obtain sufficient conditions for the ergodicity by employing the Feller property and mutually exclusive possibilities
lemma. Under the same conditions, we demonstrate that the persistence in the mean of the disease occurs. To analyze
properly our new model, we study the stochastic extinction case.
The organization of this paper is as follows: in section 2, we present our new stochastic system and some preliminary
results. In section 3, we focus on the stochastic characteristics of the perturbed model. Since the ergodicity is an
important statistical characteristic, the existence of a unique stationary distribution is obtained. Almost sufficient
condition for the persistence is also established. To complete our study, we give sufficient conditions for the disease
extinction. Finally, we support our theoretical results by illustrating some numerical examples.

2. The stochastic SIQS model and some preliminaries
Let (Ω, F , P) be a complete probability space with a filtration {Ft }t≥0 satisfying the usual conditions, and containing all the random variables that will be meted in this paper. We merge the stochastic transmission with a
discontinuous perturbed mortality rates. The random variability in the epidemic transmission β and the mortality
rates µi (i = 1, 2, 3) are presented by a decomposition of usual white noise and the Lévy-Itô process, respectively.
Under these assumptions, the evolution of an epidemic during the quarantine strategy is modeled by the following
system of stochastic differential equations:

Here, Wβ (t) and Wi (t) (i = 1, 2, 3) are the mutually independent Brownian motions defined on (Ω, F , {Ft }t≥0 , P)
with the positive intensities σβ and σi (i = 1, 2, 3). S(t− ), I(t− ) and Q(t− ) are the left limits of S(t), I(t) and Q(t),

e (dt, du) =
measurable subset Z of (0, ∞) satisfying ν(Z) < ∞. It assumed that ν is a Lévy measure such that N
N (dt, du) − ν(du)dt. We also assume that Wi (t) (i = 1, 2, 3, β) are independent of N . The bounded functions
ηi : Z × Ω → R (i = 1, 2, 3) are B(Z) × Ft -measurable and continuous with respect to ν.
For the sake of notational simplicity, we define
• σ̄ = max{σ12 , σ22 , σ32 }.

• η(u) = min{η1 (u), η2 (u), η3 (u)}.

In view of the biological interpretation, the question of whether the stochastic model is well-posed is the first
concern. Therefore, to analyze the stochastic model (2), it is necessary to verify the existence of a unique global
positive solution, that is, there is no explosion in finite time for any positive initial value (S(0), I(0), Q(0)) ∈ R3+ . The
following lemma assures the well-posedness of the stochastic model (2).
Γn,p = µ1 −

Lemma 2.1. Let assumptions (A1 ) and (A2 ) hold. For any initial value Y (0) = (S(0), I(0), Q(0)) ∈ R3+ , there exists
a unique positive solution Y (t) = (S(t), I(t), Q(t)) of system (2) on t ≥ 0, and this solution will stay in R3+ almost
surely.
The proof is somehow standard and classic (see for example [15, 36]), so we omit it here.
In the following, we always presume that the assumptions (A1 ) - (A5 ) hold. For reference purposes, we will prepare
several useful lemmas.

Lemma 2.2. Let n be a positive integer and let Y (t) denotes the solution of system (2) that starts from a given point
Y (0) ∈ R3+ . Then, for any p > 1 that satisfies Γn,p > 0, we have

which is established from the observation that the function

g(x) = (1 + x)np − 1 − npx,

n, p ≥ 1,

is decreasing for x ∈ (−1, 0) and increasing for x ≥ 0. Needless to say, this last fact makes necessarily g(a) ∨ g(b) as
the highest value of g on any interval [a, b] ⊂ (−1, ∞). The adoption of the inequality (4) in our calculus, especially
in (3), (6) and (11), will improve many classical results presented in the above mentioned papers.
Remark 2.4. Lemma 2.2 takes into consideration the stochastic transmission and the effect of Lévy jumps, and this
makes it clearly an extended version of Lemma 2.3 presented in [34].

Remark 2.9. The last lemma is easily demonstrated by using an analysis similar to that in the proof of Lemma 2.5.
Remark 2.10. In the absence of Lévy noise (see for example [27]), the stationary distribution expression is used to
calculate the time averages of the auxiliary process solution by employing the ergodic theorem [17]. Unfortunately, the
said expression is still unknown in the case of the Lévy jumps. This problem is implicitly mentioned in [35] as an open
question, and the authors presented the threshold analysis of their model with an unknown stationary distribution
formula. In this article, we propose an alternative method to establish the exact expression of the threshold parameter
without having recourse to the use of ergodic theorem. This new idea that we propose is presented in the following
lemma.
Lemma 2.11. Let X(t) ∈ R
R + be the solution
 of the equation (5) with any given initial value X(0) = N (0) ∈ R+ .

Now, we present a lemma which gives mutually exclusive possibilities for the existence of an ergodic stationary
distribution to the system (2).
Lemma 2.12 (Mutually exclusive possibilities lemma, [22]). Let φ(t) ∈ Rn be a stochastic Feller process, then either
an ergodic probability measure exists, or

for any compact set Σ ⊂ Rn , where the supremum is taken over all initial distributions ν̂ on Rn and P(t, x, Σ) is the
probability for φ(t) ∈ Σ with φ(0) = x ∈ Rn .

Theorem 3.1. If Rs0 > 1, the stochastic system (2) admits a unique stationary distribution and it has the ergodic
property for any initial value Y (0) ∈ R3+ .
10

Proof. Motivated by the proof of Lemma 3.2 in [25], we briefly verify the Feller property of the stochastic model (2).
The main purpose of the next step is to prove that (12) is impossible. Applying the generalized Itô’s formula to
ln I − µβ1 (X − S), we easily derive

Applying similar arguments to those in Theorem 5.1 of [14], we show the uniqueness of the ergodic stationary distribution of our model (2). This completes the proof.

Proof. From model (2) it yields

d(S(t) + I(t) + Q(t)) = A − µ1 S(t) − µ2 I(t) − µ3 Q(t) dt + P̄1 (t) + P̄2 (t) + P3 (t).

Integrating (18) from 0 to t, and then dividing t on both sides, we get

4. Examples
In this section, we will validate our theoretical results with the help of numerical simulation examples taking
parameters from the theoretical data mentioned in the Table 1. We numerically simulate the solution of system (2)
with the initial values (S(0), I(0), Q(0)) = (0.5, 0.3, 0.1). The unit of time is one day.

Example 4.1. We have chosen the stochastic fluctuations intensities σ1 = 0.01, σ2 = 0.03, σ3 = 0.07 and σβ = 0.02.
Furthermore, we assume that η1 (u) = 0.01, η2 (u) = 0.02, η3 (u) = 0.05, Z = (0, ∞) and ν(Z) = 1. Then, Rs0 =
1.1756 > 1. From Figure 2, we show the existence of the unique stationary distributions for S(t), I(t) and Q(t) of the
model (2) at t = 300, where the smooth curves are the probability density functions of S(t), I(t) and Q(t), respectively.
It can be obviously observed that the solution of the stochastic model (2) persists in the mean (see Figure 3).

Conclusion
In this study, we proposed a new version of a perturbed SIS epidemiological model with a quarantine strategy.
This model simultaneously takes into account random transmission and the effects of jumps. We have addressed
possible scenarios of the pandemic spread during unforeseen climate changes or environmental shocks. Compared with
the existing literature, the novelty of our study manifested in new analysis techniques and improvements which are
summarized in the following items:
• Our paper is distinguished from previous works [37, 36, 5, 4, 6] by improving the majorization of the following
quantity

which raises the optimality of our calculus and results.
• Our results in Lemmas 2.5 and 2.8 provide an extended and generalized version of classical lemmas 3.3 and 3.4
presented in [36] which are widely used in the literature.
• Our study provides an improved threshold

by taking into consideration the Remark 2.3. This parameter is a sufficient condition for the existence of a
unique ergodic stationary distribution and persistence of the disease under some assumptions. The last two
asymptotic properties are proven in Theorems 3.1 and 3.2, by using a new approach based on Lemma 2.11 and
the mutually exclusive possibilities lemma 2.12.
• Our study offers an alternative method to the gap mentioned in (Theorem 2.2, [35]). Without using the explicit
formula of the distribution stationary µ(·) of X (which still up to now unknown), we gave the expression of the
ergodicity and persistence threshold.
• For the case of non-persistence, in Theorem 3.3, we proved that the following parameter

is a sufficient conditions for the disappearance of the disease.
Eventually, we point out that the obtained results extend and generalize many previous works (for example, [30, 31,
28, 32, 3]), by analyzing the dynamics of the SIQS epidemic models with two disturbances. We believe that our article
can be a rich basis for future studies.
