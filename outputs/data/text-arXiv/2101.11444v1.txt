Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic has had worldwide devastating effects on human lives,
highlighting the need for tools to predict its development. Dynamics of such publichealth threats can often be efficiently analysed through simple models that help to
make quantitative timely policy decisions. We benchmark a minimal version of a
Susceptible-Infected-Removed model for infectious diseases (SIR) coupled with a simple
least-squares Statistical Heuristic Regression (SHR) based on a lognormal distribution.
We derived the three free parameters for both models in several cases and tested them
against the amount of data needed to bring accuracy in predictions. The SHR model
is ≈ ±2% accurate about 20 days past the second inflexion point in the daily curve
of cases, while the SIR model reaches a similar accuracy a fortnight before. All the
analyzed cases assert the utility of SHR and SIR approximants as a useful tool to
forecast the evolution of the disease. Finally, we have studied simulated stochastic
individual-based SIR dynamics, which yields a detailed spatial and temporal view of
the disease that cannot be given by SIR or SHR methods.

Introduction

The consequences of a pandemic like COVID-19 caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2 cannot
be overstated [Nature, 2020]. Accurate mathematical tools allowing to monitor and forecast the evolution of the contagious disease are useful to guide social, economic and public
health decisions made by governments. Nevertheless, despite the availability of powerful
mathematical models [Anderson et al., 2020], initial forecasting by some organizations underestimated the evolution of the epidemics, hampering the immediate taking of necessary
actions [Economist, 2020, Herzberge and Hecketsweller, 2020].
This study aims to take advantage of available worldwide data on COVID-19 [Roser et al., 2020,
Dong et al., 2020] to benchmark and assign error bars to minimal models, like the susceptibleinfected-recovered (SIR) [Kermack and McKendrick, 1927, Weiss, 2013], a straightforward
least-squares best-fit (LS) Statistical Heuristic Regression (SHR) based on a lognormal distribution [Lam, 1988], or basic Monte-Carlo simulation [Girona, 2020, Gang, 2020]. These
models are gauged against two variables measured daily: (i) the number of deaths, and (ii)
the number of new infections. Such indicators both possess advantages and disadvantages.
Deaths are usually counted using a consistent methodology1 and, undeniably, it is an observable proportional to the spread of the disease, but the tally of deaths carry a delay
1

However, some countries have varied these criteria during the course of the epidemic. Moreover, different
countries can use different rules to define these variables. Those inconsistencies can be compensated and

of about one month on the actual dynamics of the disease. On the other hand, the number of infections is timely, but incorporates more uncertainties since it depends on details
not related to the disease, e.g. on the number of tests performed. We show the simultaneous monitoring of both observables supplemented with relatively simple mathematical
approaches can be used to follow and forecast the evolution of the disease with enough
accuracy to help decision-making processes and we discuss the associated error bars.

Results and Discussion
Statistical Heuristic Regression (SHR)

Epidemics can efficiently be modelled as a geometric process related to independent random
events [Lam, 1988]. This method yields a regression curve that describes the temporal
variation of a contagious disease for the number of deaths, infections or some other relevant
observable variable. Such a statistical heuristic approach results in a lognormal function,
(ln (t−t0 )−µ)2

(1)

which is the probability distribution function of a random variable whose logarithm, u =
ln (t), is normally distributed around its mean value µ with a dispersion σ [Johnson et al., 1994].
The beginning of the propagation is determined by t0 and the value of the single maximum
cM = c(tM ) happens at tM = t0 + µ − σ 2 .
Starting from the model dc(t)
dt = α(t)c(t) and imposing general requirements on α(t)
(which follow from the observed behaviour of the number of daily cases) also leads to
the same expression [Wenbin et al., 2013]. Using entropy-related arguments, these authors
have estimated that σ ≈ 0.4, which compares well with the averaged values for ten different
western countries for deaths and infected, 0.6 ± 0.2 and 0.5 ± 0.2 respectively, cf. Tables 1
and 2. Finally, we notice that such lognormal distribution derived on [Lam, 1988] was
proved useful to model the SARS outbreak in 2003 [Chan et al., 2006].

Given arbitrary precision, C(t) and c(t) carry the same information about the set of three
parameters, F = {cM , µ, σ}, since c(t) is simply the temporal derivative of C(t). However,
in practical terms, c(t) is heavily affected by noise in the collection of the data series {ci },
and least-squares fits to the functions C(t) and c(t) are expected to determine slightly
do not significantly affect the conclusions of our analysis. However, a comparison between countries is only
an approximated one.

different values for F. Therefore, we chose to report values related to C(t), which are less
affected by noise. Still, we notice that the information contained in c(t) is equally valuable
and sometimes simpler to obtain, in particular, the position and value of its inflexion points
and single maximum.
Next, we aim to prove that the ansatz in Equations 1 and 2 reproduces the behaviour of
COVID-19 in a few different western countries. Even if SHR merely amounts to a precise
fit of the data, we observe that it carries significant advantages over the mere manipulation
of the data series, {ci }, as: (i) it can be extrapolated to the near future (extrapolations
should be treated with great care, but an informed extrapolation about the behavior in the
future is always better than a wild guess) and, (ii) it reduces long lists of numbers to an
analytical expression which only depends on three parameters. Such an analytical function
can be then easily manipulated to get integrals, derivatives of any order, or to search for
extrema/inflexion points, etc.
2.1.1

Spain.

Spain is a country where the disease was particularly virulent in its first wave, spreading
with remarkable strength. The SHR model agrees well with the data for both deaths and
infections (Fig. 1 and Tables 1 and 2). Together, these two variables provide a better idea
of the epidemic’s course by identifying two critical items: the impact on the population via
infections and, the impact on the health system via deaths. Three simple features defining
the epidemics that will be rationalized later in the context of the SIR model are: (i) the
exponential behavior near the origin, (ii) the position and value of the single maximum in
the daily number of cases and, (iii) an asymmetric decay towards the future w.r.t the past.
The ratio between total infections and deaths has evolved from about 1% in March to a
maximum of 12% in August, but it has significantly decayed for the second wave to about
4% at the end of September (inset in left-hand side in Fig. 1).
Three regions are identified in the plots, both for deaths and infections. The first region
(I, wave 1) finishes approximately on the 1st of May, 2020 (d = 152) and it clearly shows
the three aforementioned features marking its association with an infectious disease. The
second region (II, inset in right-hand side in Fig. 1), goes approximately between the 150th
and 200th day, and its hallmark is to sustain a fairly constant level of daily infections,
c(t) =< ci >, which reflects in a linear increase of the accumulated number of cases, C(t).
Region II approximately terminates near the end of the general lockdown in Spain, on the
21st of June (d = 173).
Neither the SHR nor the SIR models can account for a sustained period of constant
infections, although they can accommodate this regime via the slowly decaying queue of
the distribution where derivative of the function is very low. In contrast, such behavior
can be naturally described via Monte-Carlo simulation. Likewise, while MC can describe
several waves by producing more than one local maxima due to spatial inhomogeneous
dynamics, SHR and SIR can only describe such a scenario via a linear combination of
4

individual waves, each one governed with its own parameters.
Finally, in a third region (III, wave 2) the collective transmission displays again a similar
behavior to the region I, marking the evolution of an out-of-control disease. The superposition of these multiple regimes, plus other waves if needed, describes the overall function
well. We notice that the accuracy in the fit for any wave is not expected to be reasonably
stable until at least the corresponding maximum is well developed (Section 2.1.6). However
such incertitude, the model predicts that in Spain the number of infections due to the second wave should be reaching its maximum in December 2020, at most in January 2021.2 In
addition, the model predicts that the strength of the second wave is approximately weaker
than the first one by a factor two, as measured by the number of accumulated certified
deaths from SARS-Cov-2. Although these predictions may be affected by large error bars
since the maximum in the second wave is not yet well developped, those values offer sound
guidance about the course of the disease. We have used this model to extrapolate the
shape of the curve by a fortnight after the last day of the corresponding available data; 3
the resemblance to the ulterior course of the disease will be seen in the next weeks.
The accompanying number of registered infections yield a picture of the likely evolution
of deaths in the following days, even if the variation in the absolute numbers from the first
to the second wave is dominated by the change in the number of tests performed. Given
the large dispersion of raw data due to difficulties to collect them it is clear the necessity
to perform moving averages and the advantages of working with least-square approximants
that can be extrapolated a few days ahead, a statement that is true for the behaviour
of other countries. While deaths only show two waves so far, infections identify at least
four local maxima that can be correlated with different events, like the end of the summer
vacations or the occurrence of several bank holidays in Spain where the population has
been moving and mixing in great numbers.
2.1.2

Germany.

Compared with other countries with large populations, Germany has managed the pandemics quite well, as it is observed by comparing the number of cases per inhabitant.
Moreover, its evolution has been recorded with consistency both for deaths and infections.
Therefore, it is an appropriate benchmark for any model.
Similarly to Spain, the SHR model can be used to accurately represent the disease
evolution using only three parameters per wave (Fig. 2). Curiously enough, best-fit values
for µ and σ are quite similar to Spain (Tables 1 and 2), indicating that, independently
of the absolute strength, there are common underlying features in both cases. Therefore,
it is interesting to explore the ability of a single normalized averaged curve to represent
2

Assuming fixed conditions, in particular disregarding the possible effect of Christmas festivities.
On the 4th of November, 1385 previously unaccounted deaths were added in Spain, producing a discontinuity in the curve. To make possible a prediction based on an extrapolation, we have not included
those extra deaths.

such contrasting cases as Spain and Germany, using C(∞) ∝ cM as the single only free
parameter. Such a curve is represented in Figs. 1 and 2 by the green dashed line having
µ = 3.53 and σ = 0.56 (Section 2.1.5), and it is clear that despite having such a limited
freedom for fitting (since it only depends on one parameter), it provides a very reasonable
approximation to the data. In contrast to Spain, the ratio between total infections and
deaths in Germany evolved from about 1% in April to 4% in September, which is about
three times lower than for Spain (inset in Fig. 2).
2.1.3

Other countries.

We also prove the capabilities and versatility of the SHR ansatz to reproduce the observed
data by applying the same methodology to a pool of western countries: Great Britain
(GBR), Italy (ITA), United States (USA), France (FRA), Switzerland (CHE), Denmark
(DNK), Austria (AUT) and Finland (FIN), cf. Figs. 3 and 4. In general, the agreement is
quite good, both for deaths and infections. Among other advantages, this procedure allows
a quick and simple monitoring of the evolution of the disease in the different countries. In
particular, it is a useful tool to identify and forecast the appearance of a second wave. At
the moment of writing, only the USA has fully developed the maximum associated with the
second wave and, from the combined behaviour of deaths and infections, it could be argued
that the country is clearly heading towards a third wave. Since this is the only case so far,
it is not possible to characterize well such a second wave by a proper average of different
countries, although it seems fair to say that it is represented by a wider distribution of
daily deaths (e.g. the second component represented by the dotted red curve corresponds
to having µ = 5.5 and σ = 1.2) and a lower value at the peak by about a factor 2.
2.1.4

Regions: NYC vs Madrid.

Prominent places where the infection spreads quickly are densely populated regions, which
constitute the core of the propagation of the disease. Therefore, it is interesting to compare
the distribution of cases in those regions. We have juxtaposed the performance of New
York City (9.1 M-people, NYC) and the Community of Madrid (6.7 M-people, CAM) in
the first wave (Fig. 5). To highlight the similarities rather than the differences they are superimposed in such a way that the position (day) of the maximum coincides. Furthermore,
CAM has been scaled by the ratio of respective populations, which makes the value at the
maximum very similar for both regions. Despite all the differences between these regions,
it is clear that a typical pattern emerges, which leads us to investigate the advantages of
working with averages.
2.1.5

Averaged profile.

Normalizing and superimposing the curves for COVID-19 deceases on different countries
such that the maximum in c(t) is in a common position, (tM ) allows us to focus on similar6

ities. Despite slight differences, nine out of the ten arbitrarily-chosen western countries are
all well represented by a normalized average function, < c(t) >, (Fig 6). USA shows as an
outlier; a warning about the quite different boundary conditions from the other European
countries. Since second waves are not fully developed (except in USA) it is not possible
yet to ascertain if such a universal average could represent faithfully second waves, even
if maybe with different effective values of µ and σ owing to the different boundary conditions that may apply. We have not tried the same procedure with the infected because
of the greater temporal and spatial variability of procedures used to define that variable.
However, results for deaths in the first waves make us believe that such a representative
average could also be applied to a properly defined observable for infections. Excluding
USA, the maximum average error made by substituting the actual data by the average
function ( = c(t)− < c(t) >) is ≈ 0.03 in units of cM , which happens near the inflections points where the function c(t) has decayed to ≈ 0.4 (see inset in left panel in Fig 6).
Therefore, the averaged curve yields an answer with a fractional error of ≈ ±5%, which is
an excellent initial guess taking into account that it only depends on a single parameter,
cM . Such parameter cM can be easily obtained from a single point: the maximum value in
the daily distribution of cases for each wave, which we derive from a moving average of a
few days (seven days makes appropriate averages that account for regular weekly routines
and removes most of the noise for all the cases we have analyzed).
2.1.6

Accuracy of SHR.

To be able to confidently use a least-squares statistical regression to a given data set
{Ci } (i = 1, n) the main question is how many data points, n, are needed to yield a
reasonable estimation of the evolution of the epidemics based solely on the extrapolation
of the fitted functions. Such question is relevant considering how unreliable extrapolations
usually are [Press et al., 2007]. Indeed, any simple algorithm to forecast the evolution of
an epidemics can only be valuable if reasonable error bars can be assigned to predictions.
A simple target to quantify the error is to study the behavior of the expected total
number of cases, C(∞), as a function of n. Fig. 7 shows the variation of the predicted
asymptotic value as a function of the available amount of data after the second inflexion
point. In most cases, a fractional accuracy of ±15% is achieved a fortnight after the second
inflexion point, which is further decreased to ±5% in another fortnight.

2.2

Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR)

So far, we have shown that SHR qualifies as a quick and straightforward way to describe the
evolution of an infectious disease. If adequately used, i.e. attached with appropriate error
bars, it can be extrapolated to make predictions in the near future, since the functional
forms associated with Equations 1 and 2 adapt so well to the observed data.
However, a better understanding of the dynamics of the epidemics can be obtained

7

from a set of differential equations which describe its time evolution. The simplest model
for the evolution of a contagious disease is to postulate that the rate of new infections
I(t)
is proportional to the number of infected people itself, dI(t)
dt = τ0 , which results in an
t

unbound exponential growth, I(t) ∝ e τ0 , and makes a characteristic mark for the onset of
a pandemic.
Such a simple model does not take into account how the rate of infections decreases as
the number of infections approaches the total population. Therefore, a refined version is to
divide a given population of size N into three classes (S, I, R): (i) susceptible entities who
can catch the disease, S(t), (ii) infected ones who have the disease and transmit it, I(t), and
(iii) removed ones who have been isolated, died, or recovered and become immune, and are
therefore not able to propagate the disease, R(t). In this model, individuals pass from the
susceptible class S to the infective class I and finally to the removed class R with rates determined by a set of ordinary differential equations(ODEs) [Kermack and McKendrick, 1927,
Anderson, 1991, Hethcote, 2000, Weiss, 2013]. The ODEs derive from the interactions of
the entities in the different classes, which can be represented as
S + I → 2I,

I → R,

where we assume generalized mass-action kinetics [Müller and Regensburger, 2012] (with
slightly different scaling with respect to N ). First, it is assumed that the number of
susceptible individuals decreases at a rate proportional to the density of infected, i(t) = I(t)

where τ0 is an adjustable parameter that represents a typical time to transmit the disease,
and n is a parameter that influences the ability of the disease to infect susceptible individuals in a non-linear way (e.g. it might represent the effect of the viral load). Its main effect
is to alter the temporal scale of the epidemics, which in some circumstances facilitates the
fitting of the model to real data. The standard SIR model is recovered with n = 1.
Removed entities originate from infected; therefore, its variation is assumed to be proportional to the number of infected,

where τ1 is an adjustable parameter that represents a typical time to recover from the disease. This equation merely helps to count the total number of removed from the beginning

terms in the equation and it determines a single peak in I(t) (for n = 1, I 0 (t) = 0 for

τ0
N = τ 1 ).
The task at hand for a given population of N elements is to determine the parameters,
τ0 , τ1 and n, that best reproduce the behavior of the epidemics by solving the coupled
system of differential equations 3 and 6, subject to some initial conditions, e.g. S(0) =
N − 1, I(0) = 1. Good agreement with data can be used to lend an interpretative value
to τ0 and τ1 (unlike parameters µ and σ which only have a statistical meaning). The ratio
<0 = ττ01 is called the effective reproductive number; values <0 >> 1 characterize a virulent
disease where R(∞) = S(0).
First, we focus on the task of simulating a population where s(0) = S(0)
N = r(∞) =
R(∞)
= 1. For this particular case, <0 >> 1 and the entire susceptible population is
N
removed at the end. The proposed algorithm goes as follows,
1. We use the daily number of deaths to identify the position and maximum value in
the infections/deaths data: t∗M and i∗M .
2. τ0 is the main parameter that determines the position of the peak in i(t). We estimate
a value for τ0 that brings the maximum in i(t) near t∗M .
3. We get an approximate value for τ1 from the expression i∗M = 1− <10 (1 + ln <0 ) [Weiss, 2013].
4. The value i∗M yields N in the particular case of R(∞) = N = cM . We adjust the
value of N to agree with i∗M .

the number of accumulated cases predicted by the model, R(t), and the recorded
data, Ci , to find optimal values for τ0 , and τ1 .
2.2.1

Spain.

Similarly to the SHR analysis we have presented above, we illustrate the performance of
the SIR model by first looking at the distribution of deaths and infections in Spain (Fig. 8).
The lower left panel shows how numerical solutions to SIR equations match very well the
temporal behavior of the epidemics under the condition s(0) = r(∞) = 1 for optimized
values of τ0 and τ1 (Table 3). Dispersion of data in the daily reported cases is usually
smaller before the peak is reached (the quasi-exponential region) and fluctuations grow in
9

importance after the maximum is reached– which is a general observation holding for most
of the countries we have studied. We assign it to the balance between different currents
transferring individuals between the three classes, the phenomenon responsible for the
appearance of a single maximum in daily cases for a given wave in the pandemics.
The proposed procedure works for the deaths subset as follows. First, the curve of daily
cases is followed up to the appearance of its maximum, which to circumvent the noise is
∗ (t∗ = 96) =
identified from a smoothed curve obtained by a five-day moving average, IM
M
17.1 per million people (the single daily maximum value is IM (tM = 94) = 20.2). The SHR
model for accumulated deaths using only data up to six days past the maximum yields a
prediction of total deaths of N = 383, which is off the final mark by about 40%.
Once the maximum is identified, the quasi-exponential behavior near the origin is used
to estimate an initial value for τ0 (supplementary material, Eq. S6). For Spain, the first
case happens at t = 65, and the first inflexion point is at t1 = 82. Therefore, the first
10 points (about halfway to t1 ) are used to get an exponential fit to the accumulated
number of cases that yields τ0 ≈ 2.8 ± 0.3. Such a value, combined with an initial guess
<0 = 10 produces a maximum in the curve of daily deaths at tM = 103. Accordingly, τ0
is decreased until we locate the maximum closer to the right position. For τ0 = 2.2 we
get tM = 95 and IM = 11.7 (per million inhabitant). Therefore, we update the value of
17.1
N using the ratio 11.7
and start an efficient local Levenberg-Marquardt minimization of
the root-mean-squared deviation between the actual data and the computed values. This
is done to simultaneously optimize N , τ0 and τ1 (Fig. 8, left-lower panel). Taking into
account that only data up to six days past the maximum have been used, it is remarkable
that this self-consistent procedure reduces the fractional error between the prediction of
the SIR model and the data from 40% to ±3%, being the root-mean-squared deviation
χ
(RMSD) between the accumulated data and the predicted function N
= 0.6%. Such a
low RMSD value matches the good visual agreement observed. We believe that the logic
behind the steps proposed above amounts to more than a recipe to get a best fit, yielding
meaning to the values obtained and their interpretation.
Next, we explore how the SIR model represents the evolution of the number of infections. The number of infections is a magnitude that carries larger error bars, but it can
provide timely information on the evolution of the epidemics (Fig. 8, right-lower panel
shows the case for Spain). As expected, infections start earlier than the deaths(t = 32 vs
t = 65), but need more time to attain its maximum value (t = 54 vs t = 25 after the first
case).
A prominent feature is the existence of the second wave of infections separated from the
first one by a region of sustained constant number of cases, as we have discussed in Fig. 1. To
fit the data, we superpose the two waves, each with its own defining parameters. However,
the constant region between waves cannot be easily accommodated in these models and it is
a clear indication of a different stage in the epidemics with low but sustained transmission
of the disease at a pace similar to the one at which individuals are removed (while in the
SIR model usually it is assumed that τ1 > τ0 ). We shall come back to this point in the
10

context of Monte-Carlo simulation. Finally, we notice that this second wave of infections
has finally overlapped with a third one, as it is noticeable in Fig. 1.
2.2.2

Germany.

We have applied the same procedure to Germany, a country which had in the first wave
about four times less casualties per million inhabitant than Spain. The left panel of Fig. 9
shows the final iteration for the daily and accumulated number of deaths, which again
predicts the total number due to the first wave with accuracy ≈ ±3% of the final true
value, even if we have only used data up to six days past the maximum. The RMSD
χ
between the accumulated data and the predicted function is N
= 0.5%, which reflects the
good visual agreement observed too.
Regarding the infections, it is interesting that the region of sustained infection is also
observed, although a second wave is only weakly apparent up to the present day (t=200).
Again, infections start earlier (t = 28) w.r.t deaths (t = 70). Furthermore, maximum
values are attained after a longer amount of time (t = 63 for infections (t = 63) than for
deaths (t = 30), counted after the first case, following a similar procedure to the one for
Spain.
2.2.3

Other countries.

Finally, similar results have been observed in four more countries: France, Italy, Great
Britain and Switzerland (Fig. 10 and Table 3).

2.3

Spatial individual-based model.

To gain further insight into the spatio-temporal evolution of COVID-19, we consider next
a stochastic discrete-time individual-based model in which the spread propagates on a
two-dimensional N × N lattice, where each node represents an individual. The dynamics
are Markovian, and we will use Monte Carlo (MC) to sample from its distributions in
time, which is a technique known to handle well difficult collective effects in many-body
systems, like e.g. the magnetic phase transition in the 2D Ising model[Peliti, 2011]. The
N 2 individuals can be in any of the three states of the SIR model, making transitions
between them with two probabilities: (i) for someone susceptible to be infected S → I, pi
and, (ii) for someone infected to recover and be removed I → R , pr . At each time-step,
individuals make transitions between classes according to the corresponding probabilities.
We consider various scenarios of uniform and spatially dependent Markov dynamics.
First, we start with a single isolated case of infection per 104 individuals, and we use
pi (t) = i(t)
τ0 for S → I in close analogy to the SIR model, while we assign a constant
value pr = τ11 to the second transition probability, I → R. Comparing MC simulations
1
for N = 100 with pi (t) = 12 i(t) and pr = 10
to the deterministic SIR with τ0 = 2.1

11

and τ1 = 9 yields an excellent agreement between both approaches for same initial values,
which confirms the adequacy of Monte-Carlo techniques (left panel in Fig. 11, where both
results cannot be distinguished). By way of example, we modify the model to increase
the probability of infection of individuals in next-neighbors contact with members already
infected to pi = 34 i(t). As expected, infections grow faster near the onset, the daily
maximum happens earlier and results in a larger and narrower peak (while keeping the
final total number the same, Fig. 11 blue dotted line compared to thick dotted line).
On the other hand, a scenario where the infection probability is kept constant (pi = 0.1,
pr = 0.05) results in a wider and smaller maximum (the infection and recover constant
probabilities have been adjusted to yield the peak near the same MC steps on the previous
cases, Fig. 11 red dotted line compared to thick dotted line). For these conditions, a
typical temporal evolution of individuals (pixels) is shown in Fig. 12. A weak tendency
to clustering is observed, although the system is seen to reach a quasi-homogeneous state
fast.
Unlike SIR, this model can sustain in a natural way a constant background of infections
if at some point in the epidemics pi becomes very similar to pr , establishing a transient
regime which we categorize as qualitatively different from the region where the daily distribution derived from SHR or SIR is simply too low. This is a feature that can be observed
in real data (Fig. 1 inset in the right-hand side).
Finally, we checked how statistical properties of the model perform and scale under
different lattice sizes and parameters via simulation. The distributions over time for N =
100 and N = 1000 are virtually indistinguishable as long as the initial infectious individuals
are kept in the same ratio. In order to further visualize the stochasticity under the chosen
scale, we show in the right panel of Fig. 11 ten randomly chosen realizations out of one
hundred runs with random initial positions of infectious in the lattice. As the starting day
where the infection expands is random, we have rigidly displaced the time of the samples
such that they peak on the same day. Then, the ten different realizations and their averaged
value lie nicely on the same curve and the standard deviation displayed in the inset is seen
to be acceptably small.

Conclusions
We have analysed and compared three mathematical approaches of increasing complexity to
investigate the dynamics of COVID-19. We have proved that a least-squares SHR-model
based on the lognormal distribution is well suited to describe the epidemic’s evolution
using only two free parameters per infection wave. Confronted against real data up to the
second inflexion point, the values determined for these parameters are well converged and
stable, guaranteeing fractional error bars of ±5%. Therefore, the SHR-model is suitable
to extrapolate tendencies to the next one or two weeks, even in the presence of noisy
data. A simpler averaged version depending only on a single free parameter per wave

12

has been shown to be adequate to be used as a first approximation, albeit with larger
associated incertitudes. We have also considered a generalised deterministic SIR dynamics
to analyse the temporal evolution of the disease. In this case, the corresponding two free
parameters are well converged and stable once the maximum in the daily distribution of
cases is passed, i.e. about a fortnight before the SHR reaches a similar accuracy. Besides
the two deterministic models, we have considered stochastic individual-based dynamics
reflecting the daily changes in individuals’ classes. We examined both the case of uniform
and neighbour-dependent transitions via a Monte-Carlo simulation, which has an excellent
correspondence with the analogue SIR model’s temporal evolution.
While such simple dynamics ignore individual, spatial or further inhomogeneities (e.g.,
genetic, socioeconomic, or other differences) we have proven that they can reproduce,
predict and forecast relevant features of the actual COVID-19 dynamics. In particular,
they provide reasonably robust ways to monitor and forecast the actual temporal evolution
of contagious diseases in different environments, while only requiring basic mathematical
tools.

Figure 1: SHR/Spain. Left/Right panels: deaths/infections related to COVID-19. Data
(circles) are taken from [Roser et al., 2020, Dong et al., 2020]. Dashed curves fit the data
using Eqs 1 and 2. Blue: total accumulated cases per million inhabitant. Red: daily cases
per one hundred million inhabitants (the factor ×100 is introduced only for the sake of
better visibility on the scale of total cases). The black thin line is a 7-day moving average of
data. The green dashed line is the averaged representative curve discussed in section 2.1.5.
Red and blue thin dotted lines give the contributions of individual waves. The inset (left)
gives the percentage between deaths and infections from March to September. The inset
(right) enlarges region II where a nearly constant number of infections takes place (red:
least-squares fit to data and constant mean value. Black: 7-day moving average). Changes
in data collection methodology took place on April 19th, April 25th and November 4th,
producing discontinuities on the data.

the first wave. The data and SHR fits for both locations were juxtaposed matching the
day with the maximum number of deaths, aiming to highlight the similarities. The values
of the CAM were also scaled to the ratio of population between the two regions ( 9.1
7.6 ) to
enable a better comparison.
