ABSTRACT
The outbreak of the COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019)
pandemic has changed the world. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there have been more than 100 million confirmed cases of COVID-19, including more than 2.4
million deaths. It is extremely important the early detection
of the disease, and the use of medical imaging such as chest
X-ray (CXR) and chest Computed Tomography (CCT) have
proved to be an excellent solution. However, this process requires clinicians to do it within a manual and time-consuming
task, which is not ideal when trying to speed up the diagnosis.
In this work, we propose an ensemble classifier based on probabilistic Support Vector Machine (SVM) in order to identify
pneumonia patterns while providing information about the reliability of the classification. Specifically, each CCT scan is
divided into cubic patches and features contained in each one
of them are extracted by applying kernel PCA. The use of base classifiers within an ensemble allows our system to identify
the pneumonia patterns regardless of their size or location.
Decisions of each individual patch are then combined into a
global one according to the reliability of each individual classification: the lower the uncertainty, the higher the contribution. Performance is evaluated in a real scenario, yielding an
accuracy of 97.86%. The large performance obtained and the
simplicity of the system (use of deep learning in CCT images
would result in a huge computational cost) evidence the applicability of our proposal in a real-world environment.

Health Organization (WHO), there have been more than 100
million confirmed cases of COVID-19, including more than
2.4 million deaths (World Health Organization, 2021b). The
development and rapid distribution of vaccines is crucial for
fighting against this disease. However, it is also extremely important the early detection of the disease, especially because
of many people are contagious in the pre-symptomatic period
(World Health Organization, 2021a). Reverse-transcription
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is usually employed
for the detection of COVID-19 (Ai et al., 2020; Azar et al.,
2020). This method relies on detecting viral RNA fragments
from nasopharyngeal swab. Despite RT-PCR is the gold standard, it has some limitations such as the large time needed
until results are obtained and the relatively low sensitivity. In
fact, some patients have typical clinical symptoms but still
developing a false negative PCR (He et al., 2020), increasing
the risk of community transmission and delaying the medical
treatment. An alternative solution is the use of medical imaging such as chest X-ray (CXR) (Kunz et al., 2018) and chest
Computed Tomography (CCT) (Feng et al., 2015). The low
cost of X-ray imaging has popularized its use as a diagnostic
tool for pneumonia. However, CCT collects high-quality-3D
volumetric images that outperforms the 2D images obtained
by CXR, making CCT an excellent tool for the identification of the ground glass opacities (GGO) typically present in
pneumonia caused by COVID-19 (Hani et al., 2020; Parekh
et al., 2020)
Despite the high spatial resolution of CCT images (İmre,
2020), pneumonia diagnosis is not a straightforward task.
Success depends on factors such as the expertise of the radiologist (Chandra et al., 2020) or the overlapping between
symptoms associated with pneumonia and abnormal lung
conditions (Maduskar et al., 2015). This leads to a manual,
time-consuming process that may delay diagnosis and the
election of a correct treatment. For this reason, the use of
methods based on machine/deep learning can play a decisive role in the automation of this process. Previous studies

have employed machine learning methods for the automatic
detection of pneumonia (Chandra et al., 2020; Elaziz et al.,
2020; Khan et al., 2021; Sousa et al., 2013). Some of them
have been used for delimitating lungs boundaries as an initial
step of the classification system (Guan and Huang, 2020;
Vajda et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2018), whereas others have
been successfully employed in the classification stage (Ajin
and Mredhula, 2017; Chandra et al., 2020; Ma et al., 2015;
Porcel et al., 2008; Yahyaoui and Yumusak, 2018; Zhang
et al., 2020). The emergence of deep neural networks has revolutionized the automatic classification of medical images,
including pneumonia detection (Kermany et al., 2018; Mittal
et al., 2020; Varshni et al., 2019). Rajpurkar et al. (2017) proposed a 121-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) that
provided a relatively low accuracy (76.8%), but in a multiclass classification between 14 different pathologies. Elkorany
and Elsharkawy (2021) recently presented COVIDetectionNet, a deep learning model to detect and classify COVID-19
and other types of pneumonia from CXR images. Their system yielded 94.44% in a 4-class classification, leading to up
to 100% when distinguishing between controls and pneumonia patients. Ezzat et al. (2021) proposed a CNN architecture
based on the gravitational search algorithm (GSA) to diagnose COVID-19 disease. Specifically, this approach adopted a
transfer learning method using a pre-trained DenseNET121
whose hyperparameters were optimized by GSA to maximize
performance, yielding an accuracy of 98.38%.
Complex machine learning tools and deep learning models have demonstrated a good performance in the identification of pneumonia patterns. However, complexity can have a dramatic effect in performance when information to be
extracted is high. In fact, most of these models are based
on CXR images since they are two-dimensional, alleviating
considerably the computational cost (Chandra et al., 2020;
Jain et al., 2020; Mittal et al., 2020). When applying to CCT
images, one solution is to select only one slice, so that input images have two dimensions as CXR. Wang et al. (2021)
successfully employed this alternative within a transfer learning setting and discriminant correlation analysis. Zhang et al.
(2021) also used it in combination with DenseNet, leading to
an accuracy of 96%. However, this extreme dimensionality
reduction leads to a vast loss in the spatial information that
CCT images provide. In fact, this is essentially the advantage of CCR over CXR images: higher resolution and volumetric data. Thus, eliminating the third dimension can drastically
mitigate the potential of CCT images. Another important issue is the way the target slice is selected from the CCT scan,
and this is not a trivial task. One possibility is to choose the
slice displaying the largest number of lesions and size. However, this process requires clinicians to do it manually, which is
not ideal when trying to automatize the diagnosis. The simplest solution is to employ the whole CCT image and not selecting only one slice, but this entails a high computational
cost. This workload would be even worse when using deep

learning and three-dimensional convolutions for feature extraction. Besides, training a deep learning model requires a
considerable amount of data, especially when the number of
features is high like in 3D images. Thus, it is necessary to
find a solution that leads to a high classification performance
while mitigating the computational load associated with the
processing of volumetric data.
The collapse of the health system worldwide has manifested the importance to find a rapid, simple and accurate method for detecting pneumonia associated with COVID-19. In
this work, we employ an ensemble classifier based on probabilistic SVM in order to identify pneumonia patterns while
providing information about the reliability of the classification. In particular, each CCT scan is divided into a number
of cubic patches. Features contained in each one of them are
extracted by applying kernel PCA, and the most informative components are then entered into an RBF-SVM classifier.
The use of base classifiers within an ensemble allows our system to identify the pneumonia patterns regardless of their
size or location. Decisions of each individual patch are then
combined into a global one according to the reliability of each
individual classification: the lower the uncertainty, the higher
the contribution, and vice versa. Performance is evaluated in a
real scenario where distinguishing between controls vs pneumonia patients. The main contributions of our work can be
summarized as follows:
• A novel and accurate tool for the detection of pneumonia associated with COVID-19 from CCT images.
• Probabilistic classifiers quantify the reliability of their
predictions.
• This information is then used to weigh the contribution
of each classifier to the final decision.
• The ensemble scheme allows the identification of pneumonia patterns regardless of their position and extension.
• This system alleviates the computational cost of 3D
images processing while yielding a high performance.
2. MATERIALS
2.1. Dataset
The dataset employed in this work was provided by HT
Médica, a company specialized in radiology that offers innovative solutions for image diagnosis. The dataset comprises
513 CCT images, including 100 control patients and 413 characterized as depicting pneumonia associated with COVID19. All images were obtained as part of patient’s routines
clinical care during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic
in Spain (March to June 2020). Data were anonymized before
being used in this study following the requirements stated

by medical ethics committees. Figure 1 shows a slice of a
CCT scan from a control (CL) and a patient suffering from
pneumonia (PNEU).
2.2. Image preprocessing
When working with medical images, it is crucial to apply preprocessing in order to improve the subsequent classification
performance. Therefore, this operation must adapt images to
the requirements of the classification framework. Given the
high computational and memory requirements of CCT volumes, we downsampled the input images to obtain a final map
of 128x128x128. We also performed an automatic lung segmentation in order to separate voxels corresponding to lung
tissues from those of the surrounding anatomy. To do so, we
employed features derived from the intensities and the histogram of the image, in addition to the Otsu’s method (Otsu,
1979) for computing the threshold that separated target and
non-target voxels. This alternative relies on the maximization
of the between-class variance to separate the voxels belonging
to the different classes. Figure 2 shows the results obtained by
the segmentation scheme.
After lung segmentation, the resulting images were registered employing the Elastix software (Marstal et al., 2016).
This process consists on finding a coordinate transformation

T (x) that modifies a moving image IM (x) to be aligned with
a fixed image IF (x). A transformation model Tµ (x), with parameters µ, can be formulated as an optimization problem in
which a cost function C is minimised with respect to µ, as
follows:
µ̂ = arg min C (Tµ ; IF , IM )

(1)

µ

We employed the average of all the images in the database
as the fixed image , whereas each individual image was iteratively selected as the moving one. We used the Mean Square
Difference (MSD) as the cost function in order to evaluate
the similarity between the fixed and the moving image. This
function is defined as follows:
1 X
(IF (x) − IM (Tµ (x)))2
N
x∈ΩF
(2)
where ΩF denotes the fixed image domain and N the number
of voxels x sampled from the domain of the fixed image. See
Klein et al. (2009) for a more detailed explanation. Finally,
we performed an intensity normalization procedure for each
individual image based on standardization. Each image was

where I is the original image and I 0 is the resulting one. Figure 3 shows a scheme of all the stages of the preprocessing.
3. METHODS
3.1. Kernel Principal Component Analysis
One of the main challenging problems in classification is related to the small sample size problem (Raudys and Jain, 1991),
which occurs when datasets are formed by high-dimensional
data but with a small number of samples. Unfortunately, it
is not uncommon to find large differences between the number of features and samples, so that finding a solution that
alleviates this issue is crucial. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a multivariate approach which has been widely
used to reduce the dimensionality of the data (Jolliffe, 1986;
Khedher et al., 2015; López et al., 2009). This method attempts to find a linear subspace with a lower dimensionality than the original space. Given a set of N samples xk ,
xk = [xk1 , . . . , xkn ] ∈ Rn , the aim of PCA is to find the projection directions that maximize the variance of a subspace
(López et al., 2009). This is equivalent to compute the eigenvalues from the covariance matrix. There are some occasions
in which features can not be linearly extracted. In kernel PCA
(Schölkopf et al., 1998; Wang, 2012), vector x is projected
from the input space, Rn , to a high-dimensional space, Rf , by
applying a non-linear mapping function Φ : Rn → Rf , f >
n. In the new feature space, Rf , the eigenvalue problem can
be described as follows:
C Φ wΦ = λwΦ

N
X
i=1

αi Φ(xi )

Kij = k(xi , xj ) = Φ(xi ) · Φ(xj )

(6)

the PCA problem becomes:
N λKα = K 2 α ≡ N λα = Kα

(7)

where α denotes a column vector with entries α1 . . . αN
(Schölkopf et al., 1998).
A nonlinear version of PCA is obtained when using a nonlinear kernel such as the radial basis function (RBF), defined
as follows:
!
2
−0.5 kxi − xj k
k(xi , xj ) = exp
(8)
σ2
Finally, vectors in the high-dimensional feature space are
projected into a lower dimensional spanned by the eigenvectors wΦ . Given a sample x whose projection is Φ(x) in Rf ,
the projection of Φ(x) onto the eigenvectors wΦ is the nonlinear principal components corresponding to Φ, as follows:

wφ · Φ(x) =

N

αi (Φ(xi )Φ(x)) =

Derived from the eigenbrain concept (Górriz et al., 2019;
López et al., 2009, 2011) and given that sample x contains information from lungs, the eigenlungs correspond to the dominant eigenvectors of the covariance matrix described in Equation 4. The obtained eigenlungs span a new subspace known
as the eigenlung space. From this space, we used the number
of eigenlungs that explained 90% of the total variance, ranging from 20 to 30 eigenlungs for the different experiments
conducted. Figure 4 depicts a visual description of the effect
of PCA on data.

improve the separability between Controls and COVID-19 patients. The resulting eigenlungs that explain 90% of the variance
are then entered into the classifier.
where ri is the classification response for sample i; Nsv is
the number of support vectors; αi is the Lagrange multiplier;
yi is the class membership of sample i; K(xi , zj ) is the kernel function and b is the bias parameter (Morais et al., 2019).
Since classes were unbalanced (four times more pneumonia
patients than controls), we incorporated the weights of the
classes into the cost function of the SVM in order to assign
to each sample a different relevance in the classification decision (King and Zeng, 2001; Xulei Yang et al., 2005). This
means that samples from the majority class had a lower influence in the penalty term than the ones from the minority
class.
The output of the classifier informs us about the class each
sample belongs to. When classifying medical images it is particularly convenient to know not only if a patient suffers or not
a disease but a degree of certainty of the prediction. However,
standard SVMs do not provide any additional information of
the predictions. Vapnik (1999) proposed a method for mapping the outputs of SVMs to probabilities. This was based on
the decomposition of the feature space into a direction orthogonal to the separating hyperplane and the rest of dimensions
of the feature space. Despite its good performance, this approach requires a linear solution for every evaluation of the
SVM. Platt (1999) suggested an alternative based on training
a logistic regression model on the classifier outputs in order to
transform them into a probability distribution. The posterior
probability can be defined as follows:
P (y = 1|f ) =

1
1 + exp(Af + B)

(11)

The parameters A and B are fit using maximum likelihood
estimation from a training set (fi , yi ). Let (fi , ti ) a new training set, where ti are target probabilities defined as:
yi + 1
(12)

Parameters can be estimated by minimizing the negative log
likelihood of the training data, which is a cross-entropy error
function:

(13)
ti =

where
pi =

1 + exp(Afi + B)

(14)

We employed Equation 11 for computing the probability
that a test sample belonged to a specific class (control or covid patient). However, this measure itself doest not quantify
the uncertainty of the prediction. To do so, we used a Bootstrap method following a random sampling with replacement
scheme (Efron, 1979; Wehrens et al., 2000). This process consists on selecting part of the training set (80% in our case),
training the SVM classifier and computing the posterior probability of each test sample. Then, a new subset is randomly
picked up from the training images and computed again the
posterior probability of the test sample. This operation was
repeated 500 times in order to build a distribution of probabilities. Finally, the uncertainty for a specific test sample k

was computed as the variance of the posterior probabilities,
as follows:
PK
ui =

i=1 (xi

− µ)2

K

(15)

where xi is the i-th element of the probabilities distribution
x, µ is the mean of the distribution and K is the number of
times that the Boostrapping process is repeated. Section 3.3
provides a detailed explanation about the use of uncertainty
in our classification framework.
3.3. Ensemble Classification
The development of a CAD (Computer-aided diagnosis) system for the detection of pneumonia relies on the assumption
that patterns associated with this pathology are similar among
patients. COVID-19 pneumonia usually presents GGO with a
peripheral and subpleural distribution (Hani et al., 2020; Parekh et al., 2020). However, the location and amount of these
opacities may differ depending on the virulence of the disease. The presence of other pulmonary findings can also affect
the reliability of the classification system, in addition to the
artifacts during the acquisition of the images. To overcome
these potential pitfalls, we divided each CCT scan into different cubic patches (Ortiz et al., 2016). For each individual
patch, kernel PCA was applied and the resulting components
were then entered into the classifier. The number (and hence,
size) of the patches were selected in order to match the potential size of the pneumonia patterns, guaranteeing to strike a
balance between performance and computational cost. Finally, each individual classifier was then combined into a global
one following an ensemble classification procedure.
Majority voting has been widely used as a way of fusing the output of individual classifiers into a global decision (Chandra et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2020). In this work, we
computed the weight associated with each patch according to
the uncertainty derived from the posterior probabilities obtained by the SVM classifier. If the variance of the probabilities
of a classifier in a specific prediction was high, its contribution to the final ensemble would be low, and viceversa (Liu
et al., 2012). Defining ukl (y) as the uncertainty of the test
sample y obtained from the k-th classifier corresponding to
the l-th class, the empirical average of the l-th weights (inverse of uncertainties) over the K classifiers can be calculated as
follows:
PK
El (y) =

1
k=1 uk
l (y)

K

(16)

The class label of the test sample y is then assigned to the
class with the maximum average weight as:
Label(y) = arg max El (y)
l

(17)

Figure 5 shows a scheme of the ensemble classification
system proposed.

3.4. Performance Evaluation
We employed a Leave-One-Out cross-validation scheme to
estimate the generalization ability of our method (Kohavi,
1995). Specifically, from the total number of CCT scans
(513), 512 were employed to train the model, whereas the
remaining one was used for testing. This was performed within an iterative process in which all scans were used at some
point as the test sample.The performance of the classification
framework was evaluated in terms of different metrics derived from the confusion matrix: balanced accuracy, sensitivity,
specificity, precision and F1-score, computed as follows:

Spec =

Bal Acc =

(18)

where TP is the number of pneumonia patients correctly classified (true positives), P is the number of pneumonia patients, TN is the number of controls correctly classified (true
negatives), N is the number of controls, FP is the number of
controls classified as pneumonia (false positives) and FN is
the number of pneumonia patients classified as controls (false
negatives), . The area under the ROC curve was also employed as an additional measure of the classification performance
(Hajian-Tilaki, 2013; Mandrekar, 2010).
One crucial aspect is to evaluate the level of agreement of
the different classifiers within the ensemble. To do so, we used
a kappa-uncertainty diagram (Rodriguez et al., 2006; Wang
et al., 2019). This measure relies on Cohen’s kappa coefficient
(Cohen, 1960), a statistic that compares an observed accuracy
with an accuracy obtained by chance, providing a measure
of how closely instances classified by a classifier match the
ground truth (Di Eugenio and Glass, 2004). Cohen’s kappa
can be mathematically defined as:
k=

pA − pE
1 − pE

(19)

where pA is the observed relative agreeement between two
annotators, and pE is the probability of agreement by chance.
Although acceptable kappa statistic values vary on the context, the closer to 1, the better the classification. Section 5
summarizes the kappa scores obtained by the different members of the ensemble, in addition to how accuracies of individual classifiers and kappa values are related.

4. EVALUATION
4.1. Experimental setup
In this work we propose a system to identify the patterns associated with pneumonia in CCT images that improves the
automatic diagnosis of COVID-19. To do so, we define two
experiments:
• Experiment 1: Classification between controls and
COVID-19 patients. The aim is to detect the presence
of pneumonia patterns in the different patches each CCT
is divided into. The classification system was based on an
ensemble of RBF-SVM classifiers, whose parameters γ and
C were optimized by using a grid search within a 5-Fold
Cross-Validation scheme. The final values used were γ = 3
and C = 1. Besides, patches are only evaluated if 20% of
their voxels contain lung regions.
• Experiment 2: Evaluation of the effect of the patch size
in the ensemble classification performance. A crucial aspect
in the system proposed is the size of the cubic patches used
for each individual classifier. A wide range of values were
employed (from 24 to 64) in order to check the existence of
an optimum size, which would be clearly associated with
the common extension of pneumonia patterns associated
with COVID-19. Moreover, we study the relationship between the patch size and the uncertainty measures derived
from kappa scores in order to guide the election of a proper
cubic region as a member of the ensemble.
• Experiment 3: Evaluation of the level of agreement of
the different classifiers within the ensemble. It is of great relevance to measure the performance of each individual
classifier and compare it with the one obtained by the ensemble. Besides, we study how this relationship varies for
different patch sizes.
5. RESULTS
We first explore the performance of the ensemble classifier in
terms of different measures, as summarized in Table 1. We

can see that the maximum accuracy obtained is 97.86% when
a cubic of 28x28x28 voxels is employed in each individual
classifier. This manifests the high discrimination ability of the
ensemble system. We also compared our system with a voxelas-features (VAF) baseline method, in which all voxels of the
patch are used as a feature vector. Results show that our approach highly outperformed the baseline, evidencing the need
of applying feature extraction before classification. In fact, the
projection provided by the eigenlungs allows the classifier to
find an optimum solution for separating the two classes (see
Figure 6). We also evaluate how performance differs according to the patch sizes of the base classifiers within the ensemble. Figure 7 provides a visual representation of the relationship between accuracy and patch size. Despite accuracies are
lower than the one obtained by the cubic of 28x28x28 voxels,
other patch sizes also lead to high performance, confirming
that the system proposed can detect the presence of pneumonia even when the size of the patches is not ideal. However,
results evidence that accuracy starts decreasing when too large patches are employed. A similar behavior occurs when referring to the area under the ROC curve, as Figure 8 shows.
Patches that cover too wide regions can add confounds due to
other anatomical structures unrelated to COVID-19 but with a
similar appearance. Besides, the use of an exceeding size for
the region covered by each base classifier can be detrimental
for identifying the location of pneumonia. This can be especially relevant when the pulmonary affection of the patient is
not severe.
We also use the kappa-accuracy diagram to evaluate the
level of agreement between the classifier outputs. Figure 9
shows these diagrams for two different patch sizes. The cloud
points represent the kappa score-accuracy obtained by each
individual classifier, whereas large stars represent the centroid of the resulting distribution. The most interesting aspects
to highlight are the relationship between kappa score and accuracy of individual classifiers, in addition to the differential
performance between each base classifier and the resulting
ensemble. We can see that kappa diversity and accuracy are
linearly dependent: a low kappa score leads to a low classification accuracy, and vice versa. Moreover, the accuracy of

the ensemble classifier is much higher than the one obtained
by individual members, supporting the suitability of this approach in this context. Although predictions of all base classifiers are used for taking the final decision, it is worth remembering that their contribution are weighted by the uncertainty of their predictions. If a classifier is much better than
the others (in terms of accuracy and reliability), its decision
will contribute much more than the rest. Figure 9 shows an
extreme case in which one base classifier overcomes by far
the rest of the members of the ensemble. When the patch size
was 64 (green line and markers), performance of the ensemble was exactly the same as performance of the best individual classifier, which is due to the large weight of this classifier
compared to the rest. With reference to the patch size of 28, it
shows a more desirable behavior: the final result is given by
the combination of more than one member of the ensemble.
6. DISCUSSION
In this study, we proposed a classification system for the detection of pneumonia associated with COVID-19 from CCT
scans. This approach relies on the use of probabilistic RBFSVM classifier, which provides a measure about the reliability of the predictions in addition to the prediction itself. We
partitioned CCT images into different patches and employed
an ensemble classification framework so that individual predictions were combined into a global decision according to
the reliability of each individual classifier. We evaluated the
performance of this approach in terms of different measures
and studied the influence of the patches size in the global performance and the relationship between individual and global
decisions.
The high performance shown by the classification system

proposed in this work led to an accurate tool for detecting
the presence of pneumonia in CCT scans, in addition to spatially identifies where this affection is located. It is extremely important that a simple method like kernel PCA was able
to extract the relevant information from each patch. There is
a current tendency to use deep learning for the analysis of
medical images, especially due to the large performance that
these alternatives provide. However, there are some scenarios in which deep learning is not always the best choice for
two main reasons. First, the use of convolutional blocks in 3D
images requires a high amount of mathematical operations,
leading to an excessive increase in the computational cost.
Besides, the convergence and generalization ability of a convolutional neural network are highly influenced by the size of
the dataset. Previous studies have performed dimensionality
reduction of the input data by selecting only one slice from
the 3D CCT. However, this is not the optimal choice for several reasons. It is likely that using only one slice discards information that could be relevant for the classification process.
Moreover, one of the main advantages of CCT over CXR is its
high resolution and the tridimensional volumes that it provides, so that eliminating one of these features can be detrimental. Another important issue is that the process for selecting
the slice that contains the pulmonary affection is not trivial.
This is especially challenging when patients show an incipient pneumonia that is only located in a few lung regions. In
this scenario, the selection of the slice would require the help
of clinicians, eliminating the desired automaticity that our approach provides.
Another crucial aspect of our method is the way different members of the ensemble are combined. Unfortunately,
COVID-19 often causes severe bilateral pneumonia, which
means that the pathology is spread across large regions of the

lungs. However, in first or intermediate stages of the disease only small pulmonary regions are damaged. This means
that when a CCT image is divided into patches, most of them
would be classified as controls since no pneumonia patterns
would be found. When employing majority voting for the
combination of individual classifiers within an ensemble, the
final decision only depends on the number of patches that votes for a certain class. In the described scenario, all images
from the first stages of the disease (where lung damage is scarce) would be labelled as control patients, invalidating its use
as an accurate tool for the detection of pneumonia. However,
since we weighted each member of the ensemble according
to their uncertainty, the decisions of some members are more important than others. Patches that contain features similar
to controls will lead to a high uncertainty. On the other hand,
patches with lung lesions will be easily distinguished from
controls, resulting in a low uncertainty and therefore, a high
weight in the final decision. Thus, our system detects pneumonia for different grades of severity, from early stages to the
hyperinflammation phase. This is extremely useful for an early diagnosis of the pathology and can help doctors to select
the proper treatment that speeds up the recovery of the patient.
We have developed a complete system that is able to
identify the patterns associated with pneumonia caused by
COVID-19. It is worth highlighting the high performance
obtained by our proposal: the accuracy and the AUC obtained
were 97.86% and 95.31%, respectively. These results overcome other similar techniques in previous studies (Aposto-

lopoulos and Tzani, 2020; Hemdan et al., 2020; Wang et al.,
2020; Zhang et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020). There are some
relevant aspects regarding our system to be mentioned. First,
our system obtained excellent results while keeping a simple solution for the classification of tridimensional images.
Second, the probabilistic nature of the classification scheme
provides extremely useful information for clinicians. Our
approach detects the presence (or not) of pneumonia and a
measure of the uncertainty of its prediction, which can be
converted in visual maps (patches with highest accuracy and
lowest uncertainty) that help doctors to identify the pulmonary affection associated with COVID-19.

7. CONCLUSION
The collapse of the health system with the outbreak of the
COVID-19 pandemic has manifested the importance of finding a rapid, simple and accurate method for an early diagnosis of this disease. In this paper, we proposed an ensemble of
probabilistic classifiers to detect pneumonia patterns associated with COVID-19. This scheme identified the lung regions
from CCT scans and subdivided them into different patches.
Then, features were extracted and entered into an RBF-SVM
classifier. Predictions from different classifiers were weighted according to the uncertainty of their decisions, instead of
using majority voting as most studies usually do. This allows
to detect pneumonia even in its first stages, i.e. when affection is located in small pulmonary regions and most of them
are similar to controls lungs. The large performance obtained

(97.86% of accuracy) and the simplicity of the system (no
CNN employed) evidence the applicability of our proposal
in a real-world environment. The combination of individual classifiers according to the uncertainty of their predictions
provides an automatic tool that detects the presence of pneumonia, identifies its location and quantifies the reliability of
the classification decision. Ours results pave the way for the
development of new techniques that provide spatial information about where pulmonary affection is located. This can help
clinicians not only in the patient’s diagnosis but in the election of the proper treatment that rapidly alleviates symptoms
associated with COVID-19.
