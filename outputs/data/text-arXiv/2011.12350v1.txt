Abstract
The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the coronavirus SARSCoV-2, has caused 60 millions of infections and 1.38 millions of fatalities. Genomic
analysis of SARS-CoV-2 can provide insights on drug design and vaccine development for controlling the pandemic. Inverted repeats in a genome greatly impact the
stability of the genome structure and regulate gene expression. Inverted repeats
involve cellular evolution and genetic diversity, genome arrangements, and diseases.
Here, we investigate the inverted repeats in the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 genome.
We found that SARS-CoV-2 genome has an abundance of inverted repeats. The
inverted repeats are mainly located in the gene of the Spike protein. This result
suggests the Spike protein gene undergoes recombination events, therefore, is
essential for fast evolution. Comparison of the inverted repeat signatures in human
and bat coronaviruses suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is mostly related SARS-related
coronavirus, SARSr-CoV/RaTG13. The study also reveals that the recent SARSrelated coronavirus, SARSr-CoV/RmYN02, has a high amount of inverted repeats
in the spike protein gene. Besides, this study demonstrates that the inverted repeat
distribution in a genome can be considered as the genomic signature. This study
highlights the significance of inverted repeats in the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and
presents the inverted repeats as the genomic signature in genome analysis.

Introduction

Human coronaviruses

The novel human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (formerly, 2019-nCoV) first emerged in Wuhan, China,
in December 2019, the causative agent for Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, has
claimed 1.38 million mortality in the globe as of Nov.24, 2020 (Max Roser and Hasell, 2020).
Understanding the molecular structure and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 genome is of urgency for

tracing the origin of the virus and provides insights on vaccine development and drug design for
controlling the current COVID-19 pandemic.
Human coronaviruses (CoVs) are common viral respiratory pathogens that cause mild to moderate
upper-respiratory tract illnesses. Two common CoVs, 229E, and OC43 were identified in 1965
and can cause the common cold. Four typical human CoVs found in recent years are Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002, NL63 in 2004, HKU1 in 2005, and Middle
East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012. Among these human CoVs, SARSCoV and MERS-CoV are highly pathogenic and caused severe and fatal infections. MERS symptoms
are very severe, usually including fever, cough, and shortness of breath which often progress to
pneumonia. About 30% with MERS had died. SARS symptoms often include fever, chills, and
body aches which usually progressed to pneumonia. About 10% with SARS-CoV had died. The
current coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which causes a worldwide COVID-19 pandemic, is milder than
SARS-CoV, but can cause severe syndromes and fatality in people with cardiopulmonary disease,
people with weakened immune systems, infants, and older adults.
SARS-CoV-2 is a beta coronavirus, like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. All three of these coronaviruses
have their origins in bats. Yet the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still unconfirmed. Zhou
et al. (2020c,b) ’s study showed that the bat SARS-related coronavirus strain SARSr-CoV/RaTG13,
identified from a bat Rhinolophus affinis in Yunnan province, China, in July 2012, shares 96.2%
nucleotide identity. A recent study identified a new SARSr-CoV/RmYN02 (2019) from Rhinolophus
malayanus, which is closely related to SARS-CoV-2 (Zhou et al., 2020a). SARSr-CoV/RmYN02
shares 93.3% nucleotide identity with SARS-CoV-2 and comprises natural insertions at the S1/S2
cleavage site of the Spike protein. The unique S1/S2 cleavage in the Spike protein in SARS-CoV-2
may confer the zoonotic spread of SARS-CoV-2. However, the originating relationship among these
CoVs is not entirely clear.
1.2

Coding structures of SARS-CoV-2 genome

SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus contains a linear single-stranded positive RNA genome (Fig.1). The
SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome of 29.9kb has a total of 11 genes with 11 open reading frames (ORFs)
(Yoshimoto, 2020), consisting of the leader sequence (5’UTR), the coding regions, and 3’UTR
pseudoknot stem-loop (Wu et al., 2020). The coding regions include ORF1ab and genes encoding 16
non-structural proteins (Finkel et al., 2020) and structural proteins (spike (S), envelope (E), membrane
(M), and nucleocapsid (N)) (Gordon et al., 2020), and several accessory proteins.
ORF1ab encodes replicase polyproteins required for viral RNA replication and transcription (Chen
et al., 2020b; Cavasotto et al., 2020). Nonstructural protein 1 (nsp1) likely inhibits host translation by
interacting with 40S ribosomal subunit, leading to host mRNA degradation through cleavage near
their 5’UTRs. Nsp 1 promotes viral gene expression and immunoevasion in part by interfering with
interferon-mediated signaling. Nonstructural protein 2 (nsp2) interacts with host factors prohibitin 1
and prohibitin 2, which are involved in many cellular processes including mitochondrial biogenesis.
The third non-structural protein (nsp3) is Papain-like proteinase. Nsp3 is an essential and the largest
component of the replication and transcription complex. The Papain-like proteinase cleaves nonstructural proteins 1-3 and blocks the host’s innate immune response, promoting cytokine expression
(Serrano et al., 2009; Lei et al., 2018). Nsp4 encoded in ORF1ab is responsible for forming doublemembrane vesicle (DMV). The other non-structural proteins are 3CLPro protease (3-chymotrypsinlike proteinase, 3CLpro) and nsp6. 3CLPro protease is essential for RNA replication. The 3CLPro
proteinase accounts for processing the C-terminus of nsp4 through nsp16 in coronaviruses (Anand
et al., 2003). Together, nsp3, nsp4, and nsp6 can induce DMV (Angelini et al., 2013).
SARS-coronavirus has a unique RNA replication facility, including two RNA-dependent RNA
polymerases (RNA pol). The first RNA polymerase is a primer-dependent non-structural protein
12 (nsp12), and the second RNA polymerase is nsp8, nsp8 has the primase capacity for de novo
replication initiation without primers (Te Velthuis et al., 2012). Nsp7 and nsp8 are essential proteins
in the replication and transcription of SARS-CoV-2. Nsp7 is responsible for nuclear transport. The
SARS-coronavirus nsp7-nsp8 complex is a multimeric RNA polymerase for both de novo initiation
and primer extension (Prentice et al., 2004; Te Velthuis et al., 2012). Nsp8 also interacts with
ORF6 accessory protein. The nsp9 replicase protein of SARS-coronavirus binds RNA and interacts
with nsp8 for its functions (Sutton et al., 2004). Helicase (nsp13) possesses helicase activity, thus
catalyzing the unwinding dsRNA or structured RNA into single strands. Importantly, nsp14 may

function as a proofreading exoribonuclease for virus replication, hence, SARS-CoV-2 mutation rate
remains low.
Furthermore, the SARS-CoV-2 genome encodes several structural proteins. The structural proteins
possess much higher immunogenicity for T cell responses than the non-structural proteins (Li
et al., 2008). The structural proteins include spike (S), envelope (E), membrane protein (M), and
nucleoprotein (N) (Marra et al., 2003; Ruan et al., 2003). The Spike glycoprotein has two domains
S1 and S2. Spike protein S1 attaches the virion to the host cell membrane through the receptor
ACE2, initiating the infection (Wan et al., 2020; Wong et al., 2004). After being internalized
into the endosomes of the cells, the S glycoprotein is then cleaved by cathepsin CTSL. The spike
protein domain S2 mediates fusion of the virion and cellular membranes by acting as a class I viral
fusion protein. Especially, the spike glycoprotein of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 contains a furin-like
cleavage site (Coutard et al., 2020). Recent study indicates that SARS-CoV-2 is more infectious
than SARS-CoV according to the changes of S protein-ACE2 binding affinity (Chen et al., 2020a).
The envelope (E) protein interacts with membrane protein M in the budding compartment of the
host cell. The M protein holds dominant cellular immunogenicity (Liu et al., 2010). Nucleoprotein
(ORF9a) packages the positive-strand viral RNA genome into a helical ribonucleocapsid (RNP)
during virion assembly through its interactions with the viral genome and a membrane protein M (He
et al., 2004). Nucleoprotein plays an important role in enhancing the efficiency of subgenomic viral
RNA transcription and viral replication.
1.3

Non-coding structures of the SARS-CoV-2 genome

In addition to the coding regions, SARS-CoV-2 genome contains hidden structures that can retain
genome stability, regulate gene replication and expression, and control virus life cycles. The noncoding genome structures include leader sequences, transcriptional regulatory sequences (TRS),
G-quadruplex structures, frame-shifting regions, and repeats. The first non-coding structure is the
5’ leader sequence of about 265 bp is the unique characteristic in coronavirus replication and plays
critical roles in the gene expression of coronavirus during its discontinuous sub-genomic replication
(Li et al., 2005).
SARS-CoV-2 contains G-quadruplex structures (Ji et al., 2020). It is well established that sequences
with G-blocks (adjacent runs of Guanines) can potentially form non-canonical G-quadruplex (G4)
structures (Choi and Majima, 2011; Métifiot et al., 2014). The G4 structures are formed by stacking
two or more G-tetrads by Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds and often are the sites of genomic instability,
serving one or more biological functions (Bochman et al., 2012).
An inverted repeat is a single-stranded sequence of nucleotides followed by downstream its reverse
complement downstream. The intervening sequence between the initial sequence and the reverse
complement is called a spacer. When the spacer sequence is zero, the inverted repeat is called a
palindrome. For example, the inverted repeat, 5’-ATTCGCGAAT-3’ is a palindrome, the palindromefirst sequence is 5’-ATTCG-3’, and the palindrome-second sequence is 5’-CGAAT-3’. When the
spacer in an inverted repeat is non-zero, the repeat is generally inverted. In a generally inverted
repeat, we still denote the initial sequence as a palindrome-first sequence and the downstream
reverse complement as a palindrome-second sequence. For example, in the general inverted repeat,
3

5’-TTTAGGT...ACCTAAA-3’, the palindrome-first sequence is 5’-TTTAGGT-3’, and the palindromesecond sequence is 5’-ACCTAAA-3’. Through self-complementary base pairing, an inverted repeat
can form a stem-loop (hairpin) structure in an RNA molecule, where the palindrome-first and
palindrome-second sequences make a stem, and the spacer sequence makes a loop. It should be
noted that an inverted repeat may not have perfect complementary base pairing in palindrome-first
and palindrome-second sequences, so the stem formed by an imperfect inverted repeat can have
mismatches, insert, or deletions. Inverted repetitive sequences are principal components of the
archaeal and bacterial CRISPR-CAS systems (Mojica et al., 2005), which function as adaptive
antiviral defense systems.
Inverted repeats have important biological functions in viruses. Inverted repeats delimit the boundaries
in transposons in genome evolution and form stem-loop structures in retaining genome instability
and flexibility. Inverted repeats are described as hotspots of eukaryotic and prokaryotic genomic
instability(Voineagu et al., 2008), replication (Pearson et al., 1996), and gene silencing (Selker, 1999).
Therefore, inverted repeats involve cellular evolution and genetic diversity, mutations, and diseases.
Despite the paramount roles of the non-coding structures, the non-coding structures are not immediately visible as the coding regions. This study is to identify one of the crucial non-coding structures,
inverted repeats in SARS-CoV-2 genome, and investigate the cohort of the inverted repeats and the
virus evolution.

Materials and methods
Identification of inverted repeats

The complete genomes of coronaviruses were scanned for inverted repeats using Palindrome analyzer
(Brázda et al., 2016). Palindrome analyzer (http://bioinformatics.ibp.cz/) is a web-based server for
retrieving palindromic and inverted repeats in DNA or RNA sequences. Palindrome server describes
the features of inverted repeats including similarity analysis, localization, and visualization.
2.2

Inverted repeat analysis

To ensure consistency in comparing coronavirus genomes, we only extracted the inverted repeats with
the perfect complementary base pairing of the palindrome-first and palindrome-second sequences.
Noted that a short inverted repeat of length P can be inside a long inverted repeat of length Q
(Q > P ), in this case, we only extracted the inverted repeats of length Q and excluded the inverted
repeat of length P .
The retrieved inverted repeats were mapped on the protein genes in a genome according to the
positions of the palindrome-first and palindrome-second sequences of the inverted repeats.
The distributions of inverted repeats on protein genes in the different genomes are assessed by the
Wasserstein distance, known as the earth mover’s distance. The Wasserstein distance corresponds
to the minimum amount of work required to transform one distribution into the other. The p − th
Wasserstein distance between two probability distributions µ and ν is defined as follows (Vallender,
1974),

Results
Inverted repeats in SARS-CoV-2 genome

Long inverted repeats are deemed to greatly influence the stability of the genomes of various
organisms. The longest inverted repeats identified in SARS-CoV-2 genome is 15 bp sequence,
the palindrome-first sequence 5’-ACTTACCTTTTAAGT-3’ is at 8474-8489 (nsp3 gene), and the
palindrome-second sequence 5’-ACTTAAAAGGTAAGT-3’ is at 13295-13310 (nsp10 gene). The
repeats of 11-15 bp are predominantly located in the gene of the Spike (S) protein (Fig.2(a) and
(b)). The other three protein genes (nsp3, RdRp, and N protein) are also enriched with long inverted
repeats.
Long inverted repeats often contribute to the stability of a genome because of stable stems formed
by the long inverted repeats. The results also suggest the recombinations took place at the gene of
the Spike protein during evolution. Together, four protein genes (S, nsp3, RdRp, and N protein) of
abundant inverted repeats are evolving dramatically and are critical for virus survival, therefore, can
be the pharmaceutical targets (Gao et al., 2020).
The relation of virus genomes may provide insights on the zoonotic origin and evolution of the
viruses. To examine the close relevance of human and bat CoVs, we evaluate and compare the
distributions of inverted repeats of 11-15 bp in four CoV genomes: SARS-CoV-2 (Fig.2(a)), SARSCoV (Fig.3(a)), MERS-CoV (Fig.4(a)) SARSr-CoV/RaTG13 (Fig.5(a)), and SARSr-CoV/RmYN02
(Fig.6(a)). The repeat numbers of the inverted repeats of 11-15 bp on each protein gene in the
genomes are shown in Fig.2(b), Fig.3(b), Fig.4(b), Fig.5(b), and Fig.6(b). The repeat numbers
are counted by both the palindrome-first and palindrome-second sequences of the inverted repeats.
Taking account of the inverted repeats of wide ranges 8-15 bp, we computed the pairwise Wasserstein
distances of the repeat numbers of protein genes in three closely related SARSr-CoVs: the distance
between SARS-CoV-2 and SARSr-CoV/RaTG1 is 6.8571, the distance between SARS-CoV-2
and SARSr-CoV/RmYN02 is 5.7143, and the distance between SARSr-CoV/RaTG1 and SARSrCoV/RmYN02 is 6.3571. Therefore, we conclude that SARS-CoV-2 strain is more closely related
to SARSr-CoV/RaTG1 (2013) than SARSr-CoV/RmYN02 (2019). Both SARS-CoV-2 and SARSrCoV/RmYN02 may evolve from SARSr-CoV/RaTG1. We also observe that the Spike protein
gene in SARSr-CoV/RmYN02 (Fig.6(b)) have more long inverted repeats than the counterparts of
SARS-CoV-2 (Fig.2(b)) and SARSr-CoV/RaTG1 (Fig.5(b)). Unsurprisingly, the Spike protein in
SARSr-CoV/RmYN02 contains natural insertions at the S1/S2 cleavage site. This cleavage site may
originate from some recombination events of the Spike genes as the result of inverted repeats.
The total frequencies of inverted repeats of different lengths in the human and bat CoVs also suggest
that SARS-CoV-2 is closely related SARSr-CoV/RaTG13 (Fig.7). Notedly, Fig. 7 shows that the
inverted repeats of all lengths are increasing from SARS-CoV (in 2003) to SARS-CoV-2 (in 2019).
From these repeat analyses, we may infer that during evolution, the recombinations may occur and
produce accumulative inverted repeats under natural selection. We see that recombinations can be
one of the driven forces for fast evolution.

Discussions

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused substantial health emergencies and economic stress in the world.
Vaccine development is critical to mitigating the pandemic. The facts revealed in this study that three
proteins nsp3, RdRp, and the Spike protein are rich with inverted repeats suggest that these three
proteins are functional significance for virus survivals, and shall be the targets of drug design and
vaccine development.
If we relax the matching pairs in the inverted repeats, we expect that much longer inverted repeats can
be identified, and the number of inverted repeats in the virus genome will be increased significantly.
The imperfect inverted repeats are the natural forms of the repeats to maintain the genome structures.
Because the perfect inverted repeat distribution and types in a genome are unique and extracting
the perfect inverted repeats are parameter-free, the perfect inverted repeats can be considered as the
genomic signature. The signatures from perfect inverted repeats are consistent, therefore, can be used
for distinguishing the closely related viruses and differing virus mutation variants. The quantitative
comparison of the signature can also provide phylogenetic taxonomy when appropriate numerical

metrics for the signatures are realized. Therefore, the perfect inverted repeats can be an effective
barcode to delimit species and genotypes.
