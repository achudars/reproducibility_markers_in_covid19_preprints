Summary
Background
COVID-19 is now one of the most leading causes of death in the United States. Systemic health,
social and economic disparities have put the minorities and economically poor communities at a
higher risk than others. Every mitigation effort to contain the COVID-19 pandemic requires
equitable resource allocation and region and situation-specific public health initiatives. Thus, there
is an immediate requirement to develop a reliable measure of county-level vulnerabilities that can
capture the heterogeneity of both vulnerable communities and the COVID-19 pandemic. This
study reports a COVID-19 Vulnerability Index (C19VI) for identification and mapping of
vulnerable counties in the United States.
Methods
We proposed a Random Forest machine learning based COVID-19 vulnerability modeling
technique using CDC’s six themes (a) socioeconomic status, (b) household composition &
disability, (c) minority status & language, (d) housing type & transportation, (e) epidemiological
factors and (e) healthcare system factors. An innovative ‘COVID-19 Impact Assessment’
algorithm was also developed using homogeneity analysis (Pettitt’s Test) and temporal trend
assessment technique (Mann-Kendall and Sen's slope estimator) for evaluating severity of the
pandemic in all counties and train the machine learning model. Developed C19VI was statistically
validated and compared with the CDC COVID-19 Community Vulnerability Index (CCVI).
Finally, using C19VI along with the census data, we explored racial inequalities and economic
disparities in COVID-19 health outcomes amongst different regions in the United States.
Findings

Our C19VI index indicates that 18.30% of the counties (575) falls into the ‘very high’ vulnerability
class, 24.34% (765) in the ‘high,’ 23.32% (733) in the ‘moderate’, 22.34% (702) in the ‘low,’ and
11.68 % (367) in the ‘very low.’ The top ten states with the most percentage of ‘very highly’ and
‘highly’ vulnerable counties are Alabama (94%), Mississippi (90%), Louisiana (89%), Georgia
(76%), South Carolina (76%), Arkansas (76%), Tennessee (76%), North Carolina (74%), Florida
(70%) and New Mexico (70%). Furthermore, our index reveals that 75.57% of racial minorities
and 82.84% of economically poor communities are very high or high COVID-19 vulnerable
regions.
Interpretation
The proposed approach of vulnerability modeling is an innovative way to conduct COVID-19
vulnerability research, which takes advantage of both the well-established field of statistical
analysis and the fast-evolving domain of machine learning. The C19VI provides an accurate and
more reliable way to measure county level vulnerability in the United States. This vulnerability
index aims at helping public health officials and disaster management agencies to develop more
effective mitigation strategies especially for the disproportionately impacted communities in the
United States.

INTRODUCTION
The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been recognized as the newest and biggest global
public health crisis1. In the first half of 2020, the COVID-19 has nearly killed half a million people
worldwide of which more a quarter of them have died in the United States of America2. Within
three months after the first reported case in the United States in January 2020, coronavirus cases
had been confirmed in all fifty states, including the District of Columbia and other inhabited U.S.
territories2. Shortly after, many states-imposed policies to curb the spread3,4. Despite these diffused
efforts, a massive surge in incidence and mortality began to recur in June 2020 that placed the U.S.
as the most affected country setting apart from other counties by a huge margin2,5. This has clearly
indicated a lapse in effective COVID risk assessment and response at different levels. With the
added concern of the second wave and disproportionate impact of the pandemic on minorities and
economically poor, reliable country-wide assessment of COVID-19 vulnerability is a matter of
necessity and urgency6.

Identification of vulnerable areas is critical for public health departments to take the appropriate
measures to increase preparedness against COVID-19. In order to identify these areas, the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) initially used the social vulnerability index (SVI)7,
which is calculated based on census variables distributed in four distinct themes: i) socio-economic
factors, ii) household composition, iii) minority status and language, and iv) access to housing and
transportation. SVI failed to sufficiently determine vulnerability during this unprecedented
situation, largely due to its primary objective aimed at addressing natural disaster crises during
hurricanes, earthquakes, and forest fires8,9. Thus, the CDC and Surgo Foundation developed
COVID-19 Community Vulnerability Index (CCVI)10 by introducing two new variables, v)
epidemiological risk factors and vi) public health system capacity, in the hope to rectify the
shortcomings in the previous vulnerability assessment technique. Despite this optimization, CCVI
and SVI are based on a statistical linear algorithm7,10 that is unable to sufficiently account for the
multiplicative, non-linear nature of vulnerability11. The lack of a comprehensive and accurate
COVID-19 vulnerability index impairs the preparedness of critical areas against the pandemic as
they are blurred to public health measures. This scenario highlights the urgent need for
improvements of the nationwide approaches to identify vulnerable areas amid COVID-19
pandemic.
In the current study, we developed a more reliable assessment, the COVID-19 Vulnerability Index
(C19VI) which quantifies the pandemic vulnerability of each United States county. This relative
index processed the same six input variables as CCVI, however, instead of using a statistical linear
algorithm, we utilized machine learning technique. We implemented Random Forest (RF) machine
learning technique to calculate C19VI. An innovative ‘COVID-19 Impact Assessment’ algorithm
was also developed using homogeneity analysis and temporal trend assessment techniques for
training the RF model. Next, our C19VI index was compared with CDC’s CCVI using advanced
statistical measures and a machine learning model. We then tested the accuracy and checked the
internal consistency of the C19VI.
Our vulnerability assessment methodology has allowed us to analyze the impact of COVID-19
that has been unequal yet widespread across the nation12-15. Besides, there are systemic
socioeconomic inequalities that increase the susceptibility and exposure of the marginalized
groups13,15,16. Thus, in addition to conducting a nationwide analysis of COVID-19 vulnerability,

C19VI has allowed us to explore the existing healthcare disparities in the realm of COVID-19
pandemic in great detail. This study may enhance the current techniques in vulnerability modeling,
leveraging the preparedness of vulnerable counties to reduce the COVID-19 burden within the
United States.

MATERIAL AND METHODS
INPUT DATASETS
We used publicly available datasets from Johns Hopkins University2, Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC)10, United States Census Bureau17, and United States Department of
Homeland Security18 for impact assessment, vulnerability modeling, population-specific
vulnerability analysis, and data visualization and mapping, respectively. The data for COVID-19
confirmed cases and mortality in the United States from 22nd January 2020 – 31st July 2020 were
obtained from Johns Hopkins University. Figure 1(A) and 1(B) presents the normalized (per
100,000) total confirmed cases and deaths dataset maps for all United States counties, respectively.
The four socio-demographic SVI indicators and two CCVI thematic indicators, referred to as input
themes were obtained from CDC. This results in six input themes that determine the vulnerability
of a region to COVID-19 pandemic (Table 1). Figure 2 shows (A) socioeconomic status, (B)
household composition & disability, (C) minority status & language, (D) housing type &
transportation, (E) epidemiological factors and (F) healthcare system factors maps for the United
States. County wise total population, racial population and poverty breakdown were obtained from
the United States Census Bureau. Regional boundary data of the United States was collected from
Homeland infrastructure foundation-level data18 in Geographic Information System (GIS) ready
file format (ESRI shapefile19). This study did not require a review by the Institutional Review
Board since publicly available, de-identified data was used.
COVID-19 IMPACT ASSESSMENT ALGORITHM
In order to understand the impact of COVID-19 pandemic in all 3142 counties in the United States,
we have proposed a ‘COVID-19 Impact Assessment’ algorithm. This algorithm ‘Scores’ and
‘Ranks’ the impact of COVID-19 pandemic by evaluating the change with respect to time and
severity in confirmed cases, deaths, and infection fatality rate (IFR)20 using trend analysis (Mann
Kendall21,22 & Theil and Sen Slope23,24) and homogeneity assessment (Pettitt’s test25). Trend
analysis characterizes the overall pattern in daily time series dataset and homogeneity assessment

identifies abrupt changes in temporal trends21-25. Thus, the algorithm classifies each county in one
of the six impact groups, ‘very high’ (Rank = 1), ’high’ (Rank = 2), ‘moderate’ (Rank = 3), ‘low’
(Rank = 4), ‘very low’ (Rank = 5) and ’non-significant’ (Rank = -999). See supplementary material
for the COVID-19 Impact Assessment Algorithm pseudocode.
The algorithm functions in four steps:
1. Data import and pre-processing: County-wise, daily time-series data of the confirmed
cases and deaths were obtained from the John Hopkins University as mentioned above2.
Then, daily time-series data for IFR is calculated using the imported datasets.
2. Homogeneity analysis: Pettitt’s test25 was applied county-wise to check for the
homogeneity in the time-series dataset of all three epidemiological parameters obtained
after step 1. If the data was found to be non-homogeneous, pre and post changepoint time
series were computed and kept alongside the ‘overall’ dataset, which was the only
populated data column in the cases of homogenous datasets. This expanded the time-series
dataset into three aspects, i.e. pre changepoint, post changepoint, and overall, for each of
the three epidemiological parameters, i.e. confirmed cases, deaths, and IFR for each
county.
3. Trend analysis: We applied Mann Kendall’s test21,22 to assess the trend and its nature, i.e.
increasing, decreasing, or no trend, in a given time-series. Next, the trend magnitude was
quantified using the Theil and Sen slope estimator test23,24. Mann Kendall’s, and Theil and
Sen Slope estimator test was performed on all three time-series computed at the end of step
2 for all three epidemiological parameters in each county.
4. COVID-19 Impact ‘Score’ and ‘Rank’ determination: Impact Score was determined
using the trend magnitude data obtained from the previous step. We used IFR as the most
important parameter for assessing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in our
algorithm20,26. In the instances where IFR did not show a significant trend in a given county,
we first used the deaths26. If the deaths did not show a significant trend either, confirmed
cases were used to evaluate the impact of the pandemic26. Thus, rank classification
occurred in three stages, each further divided according to the homogeneity results:
a. On the basis of the IFR:

i.

In a homogeneous IFR time-series with an increasing ‘overall’ trend, the
county was assigned Rank 1 and its impact Score was equal to the ‘overall’
trend magnitude.

ii.

In a non-homogeneous IFR time-series with an increasing pre-changepoint
trend, the scoring and ranking were specified based on the post-changepoint
trend. Counties with increasing post-changepoint trends were classified as
Rank 1, no post-changepoint trends as Rank 3, and decreasing postchangepoint trends as Rank 5. The Score of the counties with increasing
(Rank 1) and no (Rank 3) post-change point trends were equal to the trend
magnitude of ‘post’ and ‘pre’ time-series data, respectively. Finally, Score
of the counties with decreasing post-changepoint data (Rank 5) was equal
to the negative of the ‘post’ time-series trend magnitude.

b. On the basis of the fatalities (deaths):
i.

In a homogeneous death time-series with an increasing ‘overall’ trend, the
county was assigned Rank 2 and its impact Score was equal to the ‘overall’
trend magnitude.

ii.

In a non-homogeneous death time-series with an increasing prechangepoint trend, the scoring and ranking were specified based on the postchangepoint trend. Counties with increasing post-changepoint trends were
classified as Rank 2, no post-changepoint trends as Rank 3, and decreasing
post-changepoint trends as Rank 5. The Score of the counties with
increasing (Rank 2) and no (Rank 3) post-changepoint trends were equal to
the trend magnitude of ‘post’ and ‘pre’ time-series data, respectively.
Finally, Score of the counties with decreasing post-changepoint data (Rank
5) was equal to the negative of the ‘post’ time-series trend magnitude.

c. On the basis of the confirmed cases:
i.

In a homogeneous time-series of confirmed cases with an increasing
‘overall’ trend, the county was assigned Rank 4 and its impact Score was
equal to the ‘overall’ trend magnitude.

ii.

In a non-homogeneous time-series of confirmed cases with an increasing
pre-changepoint trend, the scoring and ranking were specified based on the

post-changepoint trend. Counties with increasing post-changepoint trends
were classified as Rank 4, no post-changepoint trends as Rank 5, and
decreasing post-changepoint trends as Rank 5. The Score of the counties
with increasing (Rank 4) and no (Rank 5) post-change point trends were
equal to the trend magnitude of ‘post’ and ‘pre’ time-series data,
respectively. Finally, Score of the counties with decreasing postchangepoint data (Rank 5) was equal to the negative of the post time-series
trend magnitude.
Every other county was classified as Rank -999 and Score -999. Finally, out of the three ranks,
assigned to each county, based on the three epidemiological variables, the highest impact group
(lowest rank) and its corresponding trend magnitude were decided as the final COVID-19 Impact
Score and Rank for a given county.
GENERATION OF COVID-19 VULNERABILITY INDEX (C19VI)
Our study methodology was built and tested in six steps (Figure 3). First, the training-testing data
was prepared using the “most affected” and the “non-significantly” affected counties using the
proposed COVID-19 impact assessment algorithm. Second, COVID-19 vulnerability map was
generated using the RF machine learning technique27,28. Third, vulnerability modeling was
validated using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC)-Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC)
technique29-31 and Cronbach’s α32. Fourth, our C19VI modeling was comparatively assessed
against the CDC’s CCVI using Friedman33 and two-tailed Wilcoxon signed rank34 test and later,
the input themes contribution to the respective vulnerability index, the output, were ranked using,
and Boruta technique35. Fifth, C19VI was analyzed with racial minority population and poverty
dataset to determine the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 pandemic on county level. Lastly,
an interactive version of the C19VI map with other results was released to the public using the
ESRI Web GIS customization toolkit36. Each step is further detailed below:
Step 1: Preparation of the training-testing dataset: Proposed COVID-19 Impact assessment
algorithm was used to map the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on all 3142 counties in the US
using confirmed cases and deaths. Out of total 3142 counties, 200 very highly affected and 200
non-significantly affected counties were selected to prepare the COVID-19 vulnerability modeling

training and testing dataset. 70% of the total counties (280) were randomly selected and
implemented as a training dataset while rest 30% (120) were used for testing.
Step 2: COVID-19 vulnerability modeling: COVID-19 vulnerability modeling was
implemented using the RF machine learning technique27,28. This model predicts vulnerability of a
given county on a continuous scale of 0 (least vulnerable) to 1 (most vulnerable). The map was
graded according to the COVID-19 vulnerability index into five vulnerability classes10: very high
(>80%), high (80%-60%), moderate (60%-40%), low (40%-20%) and very low (<20%)10.
Step 3: Validation of vulnerability modeling: The effectiveness of RF machine learning
technique was specified by evaluating uncertainties in the resulting vulnerability map. The ROC AUC29-31 was implemented to analyze the conformity between the validation fold of the trainingtesting dataset and the products of the applied technique. We computed Cronbach’s α32 for the
developed C19VI index to measure reliability by assessing the C19VI values, the output, with
CDC’s six theme variables, the input.
Step 4: Comparison of the CCVI and C19VI: As, both the CCVI and the C19VI models are
developed using the same six thematic indicators, Friedman33 and two-tailed Wilcoxon signed
rank34 statistical tests were implemented to comparatively assess model vulnerability prediction
ability. Next, Boruta feature importance assessment technique35 was used to evaluate the relative
importance of input indicators in CCVI and C19VI.
Step 5: Community specific vulnerability analysis: Long-standing systemic, social and
economic inequities across the counties have put many people from racial minority groups and
living below the poverty line at increased risk of getting sick and dying from COVID-1915,16,37. By
overlaying the C19VI map on racial minority population percentage data, COVID-19 vulnerability
specific to racial minority groups were identified. As recommended by CDC, a 13% of the racial
minority threshold was used for computing the COVID-19 vulnerability for racial minority
groups38. Similarly, by overlaying the C19VI map on poverty percentage data, COVID-19
vulnerability specific to economically poor communities were identified. As defined by the
Economic Research Service (ERS), USDA a 20% of the poverty threshold was used to estimate
the vulnerability for economically poor communities39,40. ESRI ArcGIS overlay analysis tool41
was used to conduct the community-specific vulnerability analysis.

Step 6: Customization of C19VI Web Map Viewer: ESRI Web App Builder36 was used to
develop an interactive ‘C19VI Web Map’ portal. This portal features three layers: ‘C19VI’ layer,
‘COVID-19 Vulnerability (Racial Minority) - C19VI’ layer, and ‘COVID-19 Vulnerability
(Poverty) - C19VI’ layer. Every layer features its own attributes. The ‘C19VI’ layer displays the
C19VI values, COVID-19 Impact Rank, total number of confirmed cases and deaths as of July
31st 2020 for each United States county. The ‘COVID-19 Vulnerability (Racial Minority) C19VI’ layer displays the C19VI and minority population percentage for each United States
county. The ‘COVID-19 Vulnerability (Poverty) - C19VI’ layer displays the C19VI and poverty
percentage for each United States county.

RESULTS
COVID-19 IMPACT ASSESSMENT
Our COVID-19 Impact Assessment algorithm performed a county-wise assessment of the
pandemic using the confirmed cases, deaths and IFRs data from 22nd January 2020 to 31st July
2020. We generated a map of our assessment that groups the impact of the pandemic on all United
States counties in one of the six categories (Figure 4(A)). We found 88 counties with ‘very
high’, 30 with ‘high’, 73 with ‘moderate’, 344 with ‘low’ and 214 with ‘very low,’ and 2393 with
‘non-significant’ impact due to the COVID-19 pandemic (Figure 4(B)). Top 200 counties with the
most impact and the bottom 200 with non-significant impact were used as training and testing
datasets for our COVID-19 vulnerability model.

COVID-19 VULNERABILITY MODELING
Using the impact assessment data of the selected United States counties, input themes and the RF
technique, we developed COVID-19 Vulnerability Index (C19VI). Figure 5(A) shows the C19VI
map at the scale of 0 to 1. As presented in Figure 5(B), we computed C19VI for all United States
counties and classified them in one of the five vulnerability Classes, ‘very high’, ‘high’,
‘moderate’, ‘low’, and ‘very low’. We found that 11.68% of the counties (367) fall into the ‘very
low’ category, 22.34% (702) in the ‘low,’ 23.32% (733) in the ‘moderate,’ 24.34% (765) in the
‘high,’ and 18.30% (575) in the ‘very high’ category (Figure 5(C)). Based on C19VI values, 20
most and least vulnerable counties and their corresponding input theme contribution to the
vulnerability are displayed alongside CDC’s CCVI in Figure 6(A) and Figure 6(B), respectively.

MODEL VALIDATION AND RELIABILITY
We used the AUC-ROC technique to validate the prediction accuracy of our C19VI model. As
shown in Figure 7(A) and 7(B), we found 90% accuracy (AUC = 0.90) during the training phase
and 84% accuracy (AUC = 0.84) during the testing phase, respectively. High internal consistency
(Cronbach’s α = 0.709) of C19VI model was revealed using Cronbach’s α test42,43. Overall,
validation and reliability results indicate that the random forest machine learning modeling
provides a high quality COVID-19 vulnerability map (C19VI) for the United States31,42,43.
COMPARATIVE EVALUATION – CCVI & C19VI
Since we introduced a new COVID-19 vulnerability assessment index, we quantitatively evaluated
its performance against the existing vulnerability model, CDC’s CCVI, to assess C19VI’s
predictive power and applicability. We used Friedman test33, two-tailed Wilcoxon signed rank
test34, and Boruta parameter importance assessment technique35 to comparatively evaluate C19VI
and CCVI.
● Friedman and Wilcoxon tests: The Friedman and the two-tailed Wilcoxon signed rank
tests detected significant differences (p<0.0001) between the indices given by the two
models, C19VI and CCVI. The mean rank of C19VI is 1.614 while mean rank of CCVI is
1.386. The full results of the Friedman and Wilcoxon tests can be found in Table 2 and
Table 3, respectively.
● Boruta Test: Individual importance of each CDC input themes in determining C19VI and
CCVI were quantified using Boruta, a wrapper algorithm. The most important parameter
in C19VI was theme 5 (135.17), while in CCVI, it was theme 6 (131.36) (Table 4).
Moreover, theme 3 (Minority Status & Language) ranked second in parameter importance
in the C19VI model as compared to CCVI, where it is ranked fourth (Table 4). The full
results of the Boruta test on CCVI and C19VI are presented in Figure 8(A) and 8(B),
respectively.
COMMUNITY SPECIFIC VULNERABILITY ANALYSIS
The racial minority populations of the United States reside more densely in the southern states and
in urban areas17,44,45. Our community-specific analysis reveals that the racial minorities

disproportionately live in counties that are more vulnerable to COVID-19 (Figure 9(A)). We found
that 75.57% counties with racial minority populations > 13%, have very high or high (CCVI >
0.60) COVID19 vulnerability. Similar to racial minorities, economically poor communities are
more likely to be affected by the virus and have higher mortality rates45. The C19VI derived
COVID-19 vulnerability with reference to poverty is presented in Figure 9(B). We find that
82.84% of economically poor counties, where poverty > 20%, have very high or high (CCVI >
0.60) COVID-19 vulnerability.
C19VI WEB MAP VIEWER
The Urban Data Visualization Lab (UDVL) at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) have
featured an interactive version of the C19VI map which can be accessed at the following URL
https://udv.lab.uic.edu/national-covid-19-vulnerability-index-c19vi. This map portal is easily
accessible on personal computers and mobile devices. Figure 10(A) is a snapshot from the web
portal illustrating the variation in C19VI across the nation and the pop-up widget displaying a
tabular view of C19VI attributes. Similarly, Figure 10(B) and Figure 10(C) depicts the ‘COVID19 Vulnerability (Racial Minority) - C19VI’ and ‘COVID-19 Vulnerability (Poverty) - C19VI’
layers with their corresponding attributes, respectively.

DISCUSSION
Ever since the United States declared a national emergency due to the COVID-9 pandemic in
March 2020, the country is grappling against a huge continuous surge in the incidence and
mortality rates2,46. In the last month alone, June 30th, 2020 to July 31st, 2020, the total number of
confirmed cases has risen from 27,29,764 to 47,13,014 while the total death count has increased
from 1,30,313 to 1,56,8262. It is expected that the United States’ COVID-19 death toll will double,
potentially reaching more than 0.4 million by the beginning of next year6. Thus, keeping in mind
the uncontrollable spread, ineffective strategies to check the transmission, disproportionate impact
based on systemic inequalities, and heterogeneous impact on different regions, we have developed
a county-level COVID-19 vulnerability index (C19VI) that assess the vulnerability of a region
using an innovative methodology. This methodology takes into account the limitations of the
existing vulnerability modeling techniques to assess COVID-19 vulnerability nationwide and
performs a disproportionate analysis that points out the existing health disparities in the country.

In the following sections, we discuss the unique characteristics of our C19VI model and the utility
of C19VI in the nationwide and community-specific vulnerability assessment.

● NOVEL APPROACH OF VULNERABILITY MODELING
Recently, many researchers47-54 have internationally conducted COVID-19 risk and
vulnerability assessment using either mathematical modeling48 and linear statistical
techniques with sociodemographic, economic, and health indicators, for example, equal
weight assignment10,49, principal component analysis (PCA)50,51, or heuristic modeling52,
or have performed numerical simulations of the total confirmed cases, deaths, and IFRs
using statistical47,53 and machine learning54 techniques to compute COVID-19 specific
vulnerability. While these approaches have enhanced the domain of pandemic vulnerability
modeling, there is at least one of the three underlying limitations that prevent optimum
modeling. Either they implement an equal weight assignment approach in vulnerability
assessment, assume steady transmission rates in mathematical modeling, or treat confirmed
cases, deaths, and IFR as constants for vulnerability assessment. However, it is known that
1) not all input themes variables are equally important in determining vulnerability49, 2)
confirmed cases, deaths, and IFR are not biological constants in a pandemic and thus, they
do reflect the severity of the pandemic in a particular context, at a particular time55, 3)
selection of constant pandemic transmission rates for both mathematical analysis and data
fitting is unrealistic in nature and does not encounter the implications of government
implemented disease control actions and individuals’ voluntary responses against COVID1955,56.
Thus, we optimized these limiting factors by introducing RF machine learning, a
non-linear, non-parametric predictive modeling technique which can efficiently compute
large datasets and account for complex interactions between variables27,28. Additionally, in
comparison to other machine learning techniques, RF is easier to tune and does not overfit
the data making it ideal for pandemic vulnerability modeling28.
Furthermore, we optimized dynamic characteristics of a pandemic by developing
novel ‘COVID-19 Impact Assessment’ algorithm which assesses the regional pandemic
impact by performing trend and homogeneity analysis on daily datasets rather than static
values for a defined period. Trend and homogeneity assessments help characterize the

course of the pandemic and point out the COVID-19 response through changes in
healthcare infrastructure or policies in a given region by identifying subtle changes in daily
datasets21-25. Moreover, besides optimization, our impact assessment algorithm also serves
to enhance vulnerability modeling to be driven by the chronic disease burden, healthcare
infrastructure, and policy impact such as lockdown phases.
In conjunction with the optimized impact assessment algorithm, high training
(90%) and testing (84%) accuracy with favorable internal reliability score (Cronbach’s α
= 0.709) of the RF machine learning-derived predictive modeling technique makes C19VI
an accurate and reliable index. Besides, despite using the same input, the machine learningderived C19VI produced significantly different and consistent results than the CDC’s
CCVI as elucidated through the Friedman and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. Moreover,
Boruta algorithm-based importance assessment of the variables for both methods shows
that both methods handled the variables with major notable differences. The divergence
between the two methods indicates that the C19VI was able to capture non-linear
relationships in the variables which were not captured with the linear ‘equal weight
assignment approach’ used in the CDC’s CCVI model.
Therefore, capturing non-linearity in the input variables, promising validation
results, and unique characteristics of the C19VI methodology makes it an optimal candidate
to be incorporated into more comprehensive, quantitative vulnerability assessment
methodologies.
● NATIONWIDE VULNERABILITY ANALYSIS
Our nationwide vulnerability analysis reveals interesting patterns of vulnerability
distributions around the country. We found that the majority of most vulnerable counties
are concentrated in the southern states. As shown in the Figure 5(B), nine of the top ten
states with the most percentage of ‘very highly’ and ‘highly’ vulnerable counties—
Alabama (94%), Mississippi (90%), Louisiana (89%), Georgia (76%), South Carolina
(76%), Arkansas (76%), Tennessee (76%), North Carolina (74%), Florida (70%) and New
Mexico (70%)—are southern states. Secondly, although the counties in the northeastern
states had significant confirmed cases, many states in this region have low vulnerability.
Four of the top ten states with the highest percentage of ‘very low’ and ‘low’ vulnerable
counties—Connecticut (100%), New Hampshire (100%), Wyoming (96%), North Dakota

(91%), Wisconsin (83%), Nebraska (83%), Montana (82%), Maine (81%), Vermont
(79%), Minnesota (78%)—are northeastern states. Thus, we see that the counties with high
and low vulnerability are clustered together, respectively, and the similar vulnerability
classes are distributed discretely in the different geographical regions of the United States.
This non-uniform, region-dependent distribution of COVID-19 vulnerability in the United
States can be associated with adoption of different public health strategies on a state-level
and with the regional sociodemographic distribution in the United States.
This index can also be used alongside other epidemiological data, such as disease
transmission, infection fatality rate, the proportion of cases needing hospitalization,
intensive care unit admissions, or ventilator support to heighten the preparedness of a
district or state, as well as planning and executing the response. We also recommend the
use of our C19VI index alongside the CDC’s Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) for
developing disaster risk assessment and preparedness plans in COVID-19 affected regions.
For example, in the times of COVID-19 pandemic, the C19VI should be used alongside
the SVI for the disaster management in counties with frequent forest fires, tornadoes or
hurricanes.

● RACIAL/ECONOMIC DISPROPORTIONALITY USING VULNERABILITY
COVID-19 has brought previously unaddressed health disparities of racially marginalized
and economically poor communities to the forefront of both disaster management officials
and government concern. By overlaying the C19VI with the race and poverty data, we find
that racial minorities and economically poor Americans disproportionately live in
communities that are more vulnerable to COVID-19. Our finding is consistent with other
evidence highlighting the disproportionate incidence of COVID-19 among minority groups
and poor communities13,15,37,57-59. In an ongoing pandemic, when the available county-level
cases and deaths dataset segregated by minority population and economic status are not
sufficient to generate reliable COVID-19 risk estimates, our analysis provides an excellent
way to identify precise solutions, from neighborhood-level investments in cities to targeted
testing strategies in rural areas, to help the communities that disproportionately bear the
burden of this crisis.

Thus, the C19VI is intended to help policymakers at all levels, non-profit entities, private
companies, local organizations, and the general public to help in effective COVID-19 contingency
planning, drive the equitable distribution of resources, address pandemic-associated healthcare
disparities, provide businesses with opportunities to grow where support is needed the most, raise
public awareness on COVID-19 pandemic for informed decision making. Besides, we hope that
this methodology will also prove to be useful in driving more advanced predictive modeling
techniques by professionals in academia and innovation. Lastly, we believe that C19VI will be a
tool for public health officials to help formulate effective and inclusive COVID response plans
that will alter the course of this pandemic.

LIMITATIONS
Ideally, it would be possible to calculate the index at a census tract level. However, several
important variables used to define vulnerability were not available at a census tract level. Hence,
this analysis is restricted to the county-level. Secondly, being based on the ranking of counties for
CDC six themes, our C19VI is a relative index of each county rather than being an absolute score.
Thirdly, we were unable to test the external validity of C19VI since no accurate and stable measure
of vulnerability was available. Finally, confirmed cases and deaths used in this study are up to 31st
July 2020 and might not have captured the impact of the pandemic as well as the strength of the
counties in which rapid changes have occurred up to the present day.

CONCLUSION
In this work, we proposed an innovative approach to conduct the vulnerability assessment of
COVID-19 within the United States at the county level. This approach integrates the reliable and
high-functioning domains of machine learning and predictive modeling. RF machine learning
technique in conjunction with novel ‘COVID-19 Impact Assessment’ algorithm successfully
yields a vulnerability model, which non-linearly processes the input variables with high trainingtesting accuracy and favorable internal validity, that generates a COVID-19 vulnerability index of
the United States. Besides promising validation results, comparative assessment of our technique
confirms that the C19VI predictive model is a reliable and pragmatic alternative to the CDC’s
CCVI. More importantly, our innovative approach to develop a vulnerability index has enhanced
the nationwide capacity to predict the potential harms accurately which may help curtail the

distressing course and consequences of the pandemic. Additionally, when combined with the racial
minority and poverty dataset, C19VI demonstrated its efficiency in disproportionate vulnerability
analysis and helped validate the existing disparities. Thus, as a COVID-19 risk assessment tool,
this index will help the public health officials of the federal, state, and local agencies and other
academic and autonomous institutions in formulating and implementing policies, plans, and
recommendations. Lastly, further exploration of our methodology, especially in vulnerability
modeling, has the potential to progress the digital public health technology for pandemic
management in general.
