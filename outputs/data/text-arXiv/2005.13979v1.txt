Abstract
Very recently the new pathogen severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was
identified and the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. The pandemic has a number of consequences for the ongoing clinical trials in non-COVID-19
conditions. Motivated by four currently ongoing clinical trials in a variety of disease areas we illustrate
the challenges faced by the pandemic and sketch out possible solutions including adaptive designs. Guidance is provided on (i) where blinded adaptations can help; (ii) how to achieve type I error rate control,
if required; (iii) how to deal with potential treatment effect heterogeneity; (iv) how to utilize early readouts; and (v) how to utilize Bayesian techniques. In more detail approaches to resizing a trial affected
by the pandemic are developed including considerations to stop a trial early, the use of group-sequential
designs or sample size adjustment. All methods considered are implemented in a freely available R shiny
app. Furthermore, regulatory and operational issues including the role of data monitoring committees are
discussed.

Introduction

In Wuhan, China pneumonia cases of a new pathogen, which was subsequently named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), were identified in December 2019 (Guan et al, 2020). In
the meanwhile, the coronavirus diseases 2019 (COVID-19) was declared a pandemic by the World Health
Organization (WHO). At the time of writing (end of May 2020), more than 5 million cases were confirmed
worldwide according to the COVID-19 Dashboard by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at
Johns Hopkins University (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html). To fight the COVID-19
pandemic, a number of clinical trials were initiated or are in planning to investigate novel therapies, diagnostics and vaccines. Some of these make use of novel, efficient trial designs including platform trials

and adaptive group-sequential designs. An overview and recommendations are provided by Stallard et al
(2020).
While considerable efforts have been made to set up trials in COVID-19, the vast majority of ongoing
trials continues to be in other disease areas. In order to effectively protect patient safety in these trials
during the COVID-19 pandemic, across the world, clinical trials answering important healthcare questions
were stopped, or temporarily paused to possibly re-start later, some with important modifications. Here
we consider the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on running trials in non-COVID-19 indications. The
challenges to these trials posed by the pandemic can take various forms including the following: (1) The
(amount) of missing data may preclude definite conclusions to be drawn with the original sample size. (2)
Incomplete follow-up (possibly not at random) may invalidate the planned analyses. (3) Reduced on-site
data monitoring may cast doubt on data quality and integrity. (4) Missed treatments due to the interruptions,
but also due to acquiring the SARS-CoV-2 virus may not be random and require a different approach
than based on the intention-to-treat principle. (5) Circumstances (in e.g. usual care, trial operations, drug
manufacturing) before, during and after the pandemic induced interruptions may differ substantially with
impact on interpretability of the clinical trial data, through which the original research question is more
difficult or even impossible to answer. (6) Heterogeneity in patients included in the trial associated with the
pandemic may impact results. (7) Potential heterogeneity in included patients for multi-center trials, as the
prevalence/incidence of infected patients various from region to region.
Regulatory authorities have produced guidance on implications of COVID-19 on methodological aspects of ongoing clinical trials (EMA , 2020a,b; FDA , 2020). The EMA guideline states that the current
situation should not automatically encourage unplanned interim or early analyses (EMA , 2020b). Despite
strong scientific reasons to conduct trials as planned, there may be situations where an unplanned or early
analysis may be required to minimize the effect of COVID-19 on the interpretability of the data and results.
Potential situations include trials where data collection is nearly finished, an interim analysis is planned
in the near future, recruitment of new patients is slowing down or interrupted. In particular, the impact
of the pandemic depends on the timing of the pandemic compared to the timeline of the trial, the length
of follow-up to observe the primary endpoint and the recruitment rate. Figure 1 illustrates the different
scenarios.
For example, when recruitment has been paused and will be restarted after the pandemic, the trial
duration will be prolonged. A two-stage adaptive design might then be considered for the clinical trial.
2

An interim analysis evaluating the first stage data, which include participants not affected by COVID-19,
should guide the investigators to decide whether it is worthwhile to restart recruitment after the pandemic
and with which sample size. Nevertheless, as any unplanned interim analysis needs to protect the trial
integrity (e.g., blinding) and validity (e.g., type I error rate) appropriate statistical methodology for testing
and estimation at the end of the trial is an essential aspect. The adaptive design literature offers potential
solutions to deal with the concerns in modified trial designs. This has also been recognized by Anker et al
(2020) in the context of clinical trials in heart failure, a chronic condition.
The manuscript is organized as follow. In Section 2 four ongoing clinical trials are introduced which
are all impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. These serve as examples and illustrate the many ways trials
might be affected by the pandemic. In Section 3 general comments are made on how adaptive designs
might be used to overcome the various challenges posed by the pandemic before the issue of resizing trials
is considered in more detail in Section 4. Regulatory and operational issues including the role of data
monitoring committees or data safety monitoring boards are considered in Section 5. In Section 6, we close
with a brief discussion.

Motivating examples

Clinical trials are affected in many different ways by the COVID-19 pandemic. On the one hand, patients
may get infected leading to missed visits, missing data, or even COVID-19 related adverse events. On
the other hand, the various lockdown and quarantine measures may disrupt the trial conduct: Patients may
be unable to attend their scheduled visits or the study medication cannot be delivered to the patients as
planned. While these issues apply to all trials recruiting patients or collecting data during the pandemic,
they are affected quite differently depending on the stage the trial was in and also depending on the endpoint
of the trial.
One important point is still open at the time this paper was written: When and how to restart trials that
have had their recruitment interrupted or even the study treatment stopped by the onset of the pandemic?
The only thing that seems clear is that the conditions under which a trial is restarted will be very trial specific
and can be elaborated only provisionally at the end of this paper.

2.1

Long acting reversible contraception: The devil is in the detail

For our first example, consider a study to assess the contraceptive efficacy beyond 5 years up to 8 years
of a hormone releasing intrauterine device (IUD) (Jensen et al, 2020). At the onset of the pandemic all
participating women had their IUD in place for more than 6 years but only a few had already completed
8 years of treatment. The primary outcome of the trial is the contraceptive failure rate in years 6 to 8
measured by the Pearl Index (Gerlinger et al, 2003). The trial uses a treatment policy estimand, albeit the
term estimand was not yet invented when the contraceptive trial was conceived.
COVID-19 related intercurrent events such as missed or postponed visits to the study center can be
ignored for the primary analysis. There will be no interruption of study treatments as the IUD has been
in the womans uterus for 5 years at the beginning of the trial and remains there for up to 8 years in total.
Even if the pandemic will last past the scheduled end of the trial, the primary outcome (pregnant yes/no)
can still be ascertained even if a woman is not able to attend the final visit in person on time, albeit that
according to the statistical analysis plan the continued exposure to the IUD needs to be confirmed by the
investigator. Nevertheless, the contraceptive failure rate observed over the whole trial may be impacted not
only by a potential loss in confirmed exposure time but also by other COVID-19 related intercurrent events.
For instance, a couple who usually commutes long-distance on weekends is not at risk of contraceptive
failure during the lockdown if they observe the lockdown living apart, but they are possibly at a higher risk
if they observe the lockdown living together. However, given the treatment policy estimand and the very
low rate of contraceptive failure with an IUD (Mansour et al, 2010) these intercurrent events are not likely
to be relevant for the interpretation of the trials results.
It should be noted that other endpoints of the trial may also be impacted by COVID-19 related intercurrent events. The regular safety assessments planned at the scheduled visits might be at least partially
missing if women need to skip the physical visit. While details of adverse events can be obtained by phone,
laboratory values will be definitely missing in such instance.

2.2

The START:REACTS trial: Change in endpoints due to difficulties in recruitment

Our second example is the Subacromial spacers for Tears Affecting Rotator cuff Tendons: a Randomised,
Efficient, Adaptive Clinical Trial in Surgery (START:REACTS), an adaptive design multi-center randomized controlled trial conducted in the United Kingdom comparing arthroscopic debridement with the InSpace balloon (Stryker, USA) to arthroscopic debridement alone for people with a symptomatic irreparable
rotator cuff tear (Metcalfe et al, 2020). Recruitment to the trial started in February 2018, with a planned
sample size of 221 with the potential to stop the study for efficacy or futility at a number of interim analyses.
The primary endpoint was shoulder function 12 months after surgery measured using the Constant Shoulder Score (CS) recorded at a hospital out-patient visit, with assessments taken at 3 and 6 months following
surgery also used for interim decision-making (Parsons et al, 2019).
Due to the coronavirus pandemic, recruitment to the study was delayed by the cancellation of elective surgery in UK hospitals. The study team are working closely with the Data Monitoring Committee in
reviewing the planned timing of the interim analyses to reflect this, and the resulting change in the anticipated numbers of patients with 3, 6 and 12 month follow-up data at different time-points in the study. The
pandemic also threatened disruption of the collection of follow-up data for patients for whom surgery had
already been completed, as even prior to lockdown, many patients in the study, a large proportion of whom
are in vulnerable groups, were unwilling to attend planned appointments for assessment. In order to be able
to obtain follow-up data from as many patients as possible, the study team decided to change the primary
endpoint to be the 12 month measurement of the Oxford Shoulder Score (OSS), as this does not require
face-to-face data collection, but can be completed by post or over phone (or app). As this had originally
been included as a secondary endpoint in the study, data were available for all completed patients. The
OSS is known to be well correlated to the CS, with the same minimum clinically important difference on a
standardized scale, so that the power of the trial is maintained and, as the change was made prior to interim
data being observed, there is no loss of trial integrity.

2.3

The ATALANTE 1 trial: Premature study discontinuation not to endangering
sensitive patients during the COVID-19 pandemic

The ATALANTE 1 clinical trial (NCT02654587) aimed at evaluating and comparing the medicinal product
tedopi (OSE2101) to standard treatment (docetaxel or pemetrexed) as second and third line therapy in HLAA2 positive patients with advanced NSCLC after failure of immune checkpoint inhibitor. This clinical trial
was planned in two stages (1) randomized controlled trial (RCT) on a small sample of patients estimating
overall survival rate at 12 months (with about 100 patients) and (2) a RCT comparing overall survival (with
about 363 patients in total). After the first stage, 99 patients were included (63 in the experimental arm and
36 in the standard arm), the overall survival rate at 12 months was 46% (95% confidence interval: 33% 59%) in the experimental arm and 36% (95% confidence interval: 21% - 54%) in the standard arm (oseimmuno therapeutics, 2020). The second stage of the study was supposed to include patients during 2020.
However, this trial was stopped because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Indeed, as patients were suffering
from lung cancer, the DSMB decided that it was too risky to continue. They stated that it was impossible
to expose patients suffering from lung cancer to COVID-19 infection, this could endanger them and may
end up biasing the results of the trial (ose-immuno therapeutics, 2020). As the results of the first stage were
promising, the trial stakeholders decided to shortly discuss with the FDA and the EMA asking whether an
additional clinical trial would be required, knowing that there are crucial treatment needs in this indication.

2.4

The CAPE-Covid and the CAPE-Cod (Community-Acquired Pneumonia: Evaluation of Corticosteroids) studies: Embedding a COVID-19 trial within an ongoing trial

Our fourth example is the CAPE-Cod trial (NCT02517489), which aims to assess the efficacy of hydrocortisone at ICU on patients suffering of severe community-acquired pneumonia. At the beginning of the
COVID-19 pandemic the trial was active and including patients. As SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia was not an
exclusion criterion of CAPE-Cod, centers started to include COVID-19 infected patients into the study.

4

The clinical characteristics between the two indications differed, so trial stakeholders have decided to put
temporarily on hold the inclusions in CAPE-Cod study and to use the information of COVID-19 patients
by embedding a specific study considering COVID-19 indication only. A group-sequential design using
the alpha-spending approach by Kim-DeMets (Kim and DeMets, 1987a,b) was chosen for the COVID-19
substudy to account for the considerable uncertainty with regard to the treatment effect in this new group
of patients. If the CAPE-Covid study does not achieve the required sample size or stop (for efficacy or
futility) before next autumn, there will potentially be inclusions of patients into two studies, as communityacquired pneumonia is a seasonal disease and COVID-19 will still be present. Taking into account patients’
heterogeneity will be a major methodological challenge for this trial.

How adaptive designs might be used to overcome COVID-19 challenges

In this section, guidance is provided on (i) where blinded adaptations can help; (ii) how to achieve type I
error rate control, if required, with unblinded adaptations; (iii) how to deal with potential treatment-effect
heterogeneity; (iv) how to utilize early read-outs; and (v) how to utilize Bayesian techniques.

3.1

Where adaptations based on blinded data can help

With blinded data we mean here more generally non-comparative data, i.e. data pooled across treatment
arms (FDA , 2019). Although the trial could be open, the adaption could be informed by blinded data in the
sense that they are non-comparative. Generally speaking, potential inflation of type I error rate is less of a
concern when adaptations are informed by blinded data (EMA , 2007; FDA , 2019). Therefore, they might
be considered first before looking into unblinded adaptations with knowledge of treatment effect estimates.
In the introduction an outline of the potential challenges for clinical trials by the COVID-19 pandemic
was provided. In order to assess the extent by which a trial is affected by these, blinded data may be
interrogated with regard to the following: baseline patient characteristics; premature study or treatment discontinuations; missing data during follow-up; protocol violations; and nuisance parameters of the outcomes
including event rates and variances. The findings may be compared be planning assumptions. Furthermore,
time trends can be explored in the blinded data and any changes might be attributed to the COVID-19 if
these coincide with the onset of the pandemic (see e.g. Friede and Henderson (2003)).
The findings of such blinded analyses might trigger investigations into resizing the trial. The resizing
could be based on blinded or unblinded data; appropriate procedures will be considered in Section 4. However, adaptations are not restricted to sample size reestimation but also include other adaptations such as
changes in the statistical model or test statistics to be used. For instance, observed changes in baseline characteristics might be reflected in the statistical model by including additional covariates. Similarly, findings
regarding missing data, e.g. due to missed visits, might suggest to adopt a more robust analysis approach.

3.2

With unblinded adaptations: Methods to control type I error rate

It is well known that repeated analyses of accumulating clinical trial data can lead to estimation bias and
to inflation of the type I error rate (Armitage et al, 1969). For this reason there is generally a reluctance to
modify the design of a clinical trial during its conduct for fear that the scientific integrity will be compromised. The necessity of a severe pause in recruitment in many trials due to the current pandemic, however,
raises questions of whether additional analyses can be added to an ongoing trial to enable the data obtained
so far to be analysed now, with a decision of whether or not to continue with the trial at a later post-COVID19 time. Although the current situation of clinical trials being conducted in the setting of a global pandemic
is without precedent, the particular question of adding interim analyses to a trial is not a new one.
Proschan and Hunsberger (1995) introduced the concept of a conditional error function specified prior
to the first analysis of accumulating data to be a function that gives the conditional probability of a type I
error given the stage 1 data, summarized by a standardized normal test statistic, z1 . In order to control the

5

type I error of the test at level α, the conditional error function, A(z1 ), with range [0, 1], must have
Z ∞
A(z1 )φ(z1 )dz1 = α
−∞

where φ is the standard normal density function. Wassmer (1998) and Müller and Schäfer (2001) showed
how this approach can be used to change a single-stage trial to have a sequential design equivalent to that
obtained using a group-sequential or combination function test.
The conditional error principle thus enables a trial planned with a single final analysis to be modified at
any point prior to that analysis to have a sequential design, with this constructed in such that the type I error
rate is not inflated. It should be noted, however, that it is necessary to specify how any data before and after
the interim analysis are combined before the first interim analysis is conducted. Modification of the design
to include initially unplanned interim analyses will also generally lead to a reduction in the power of the
trial, as considered in more detail below.
A similar application of the conditional error principle can be used to modify a trial initially planned
with interim analyses. For ongoing clinical trials initially planned with interim analyses, the impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic may lead to a desire to modify the timing of the planned analyses. Analyses are often
taken at times specified in terms of the information available, which may be proportional to the number
of patients for a normally distributed endpoint, or to the number of events for a time-to-event endpoint, or
given by the number of events for a binary endpoint. Changes to the timing of the interim analyses do not
generally lead to an inflation of the type I error rate provided these are not based on the observed treatment
difference, and the spending function method (Lan and DeMets, 1983) can be used to modify the critical
values used to allow for such changes. If the timing of interim analyses is based on the estimated treatment
difference the type I error rate can be inflated using a group-sequential test (see, for example, Proschan et
al (1992)). The combination testing approach could be used to control the type I error rate in this setting
(see, for example, Brannath et al (2002)).

3.3

Treatment-effect heterogeneity

Homogeneity over the stages of a multistage design has always been a topic of discussion. Even without
pandemic disruptions, there are various reasons why studies could change over time: Some sites may only
contribute to part of study, the study population may change over time, e.g. for reasons of a depleted patient
pool, and the disease under study itself may vary over time. While many of these reasons also apply to fixed
sample size designs, multistage and especially adaptive trials are under obligation to deliver justifications
of why the stages can be considered sufficiently homogeneous in order to test a common hypothesis. The
EMA reflection paper on adaptive designs states that “Using an adaptive design implies [...] that methods
for the assessment of homogeneity of results from different stages are pre-planned” (EMA , 2007). One
option they give is the use of heterogeneity tests as known from the area of meta-analyses. However, as
Friede and Henderson (2009) point out, this can reduce the power of studies substantially even in case of no
heterogeneity: Such tests are typically carried out at a higher significance level than the standard ones, thus
accepting a higher false positive rate. An addition they bring forward is searching for timewise cutpoints in
the data. Conclusions about the relationship between timing of change and occurrence of interim analyses
can then be drawn from the resulting findings. In the current COVID-19 situation, the challenge statisticians
face is similar to the general challenge described above. The nature and the severity of the impact will very
much depend on the actual situation of the trial and the disease under study. Consequently, the way to deal
with them may differ as described elsewhere in this paper. Here, we will focus on the question of whether
the COVID-19-related changes are such that a rescue by introducing an adaptive design seems justifiable
from the homogeneity aspect. There is one major difference to the situation described in the preceding
paragraph: The presence of one or two cutpoints, depending on whether the trial will continue both during
and after COVID-19, can be taken as a given. Also the question of whether the changes are due to a possibly
performed interim analysis or due to COVID-19 seems moot; the question we need to answer is whether a
combination is justified.
In some cases, it will be obvious that a combination is not warranted. One example for such a case
could be studies in respiratory diseases with hospitalizations included in the endpoint, where a COVID-19
related hospitalization may be an intercurrent event. In other cases, it may not be that obvious and there
6

might be reasons to believe that the pooled patient set is suitable to answer the study hypothesis. Due to the
reasons listed above, again a formal heterogeneity test will not be the tool of choice. The EMA Draft Points
to Consider on COVID-19 (EMA , 2020b) does not make mention of the burden of proving homogeneity;
rather it states the need of “additional analyses [...] to investigate the impact of the three phases [...] to
understand the treatment effect as estimated in the trial”. While this does not give sponsor carte blanche
to combine as they wish, it clearly leaves room for a number of approaches of justifying combination,
both from a numerical and a medical perspective. The estimand framework will be an important factor in
the decision on pooling or not pooling the data as it will make arguments visible in a structured way: If
estimands differ between study parts, then no meaningful estimator for them will be obtained from pooled
data (see also Section 5).
What can statistical methodology contribute if it must be conceded that pooling the patients is not justifiable? In some situations, the number of patients before the COVID-19 impact may already be sufficient to
provide reasonable power (see Section 4.1). In this case, also patients in the COVID-19 timeframe would
need to be analyzed, but it is unclear how they might be included. General guidance for such patients is
given as repeating the analysis including all patients and discuss changes in the treatment effect estimate.
Medical argumentation will then be needed to underpin the assumptions that changes are due to COVID-19.
In some cases, causal inference can help estimate outcomes from those patients under the assumption that
COVID-19 had not happened. If interested in the treatment effect in a pandemic free world, it might be
worth clarifying the question of interest by relating to the estimand framework (ICH , 2019) where COVID19 is seen as an intercurrent event. Alternatively, one could standardize results from all patients to the
subgroup of patients pre-COVID-19 (e.g., Shu and Tan (2018) and Hernan and Robins (2020)). Sometimes,
also an artificial censoring at the COVID-19 impaction and the use of short-term information (see Section
3.4) to estimate final outcomes will provide a helpful sensitivity analysis.
If it is not feasible to gain sufficient evidence from the pre-COVID-19 patients and a combination
does not seem justifiable, then it may be advisable to pause the trial and to re-start it after the COVID-19
time. The during-COVID-19 patients should be included in supporting analyses, but the main evidence
will come from the patient pool not directly affected by the pandemic (see also Anker et al (2020)). Shortterm endpoints from during-COVID-19 patients may be used in addition to completed patients to inform
decisions on the future sample size.

3.4

Use of early read-outs

The efficiency of adaptive designs depends on the timing and frequency of interim analyzes. Decision
making in adaptive study designs requires availability of information on the endpoints utilized for decision
making for a sufficient number of patients. Therefore, care should be taken when conducting an unplanned
(or early) interim analysis in trials affected by COVID-19. Focusing on the primary endpoint data only will
routinely exclude the many individuals for whom the primary endpoint is not available and might therefore
potentially be misleading. In particular, this is relevant to studies interrupted by COVID-19 as investigators
may already wish to assess the treatment effect using the pre-pandemic data. Several proposals have been
made to use the information on early read-outs to inform the adaptation decision (e.g. Friede et al, 2011;
Rufibach et al, 2016; Jörgens et al, 2019). Although the information is different from the primary outcome
with all limitations that this might have (Zackin et al, 1998), a greater proportion of subjects can contribute
to the analysis. This is especially useful in trials where only information about the short-term endpoint
would be available at the interim analysis (Friede et al, 2011).
If primary endpoint data are available, another approach is to retain the pre-specified long-term endpoint
as the primary focus of the interim analysis, but to support it with information on short-term data. In
particular, such methodology exploits the possible statistical association between the short- and long-term
endpoints to provide information about the long-term primary endpoint on patients who didn’t reach their
primary endpoint yet. This provides an efficient compromise between the less efficient approach of using
only information on subjects who have been followed through to the long-term primary endpoint, and the
potentially misleading approach of using only short-term information.
A likelihood-based estimator for binary outcomes that combines short- and long-term data assessed
at two timepoints was discussed by Marschner and Becker (2001). They use a likelihood function that
depends on three binomial distributions, which model the probability of success at both timepoints as well

7

as the conditional probability of success at the last time point given the short-term endpoint. The maximum
likelihood estimator for the probability of a successful primary endpoint in each treatment arm is
P̂ (Lj = 1 | Sj = 1)P̂ (Sj = 1) + P̂ (Lj = 1 | Sj = 0)(1 − P̂ (Sj = 1)),
where Lj = {0, 1} and Sj = {0, 1} denote the outcome in the trial observed on respectively the long-term
primary endpoint and the short-term endpoint in treatment arm j ∈ {0, 1}. Implementing their estimator for
the treatment difference in the conditional power approach improves decision making at an interim analysis
both for futility stopping and sample size re-assessment (Niewczas et al, 2019). To preserve the type I error
the combination test with final test statistic (see Section 3.2),
√
√
wz1 + 1 − wz2 ,
can be used. Here, the first stage test statistic z1 is defined by the cohort of patients included before the
interim analysis, but the data used comes from the primary endpoint. For patients who were included before
the COVID-19 impact but for whom the primary endpoint was observed after that impact, this would mean
that their primary endpoints would need to be analysed together with those occurring before the impact. A
disadvantage of this test procedure is that it prohibits early stopping for efficacy. In situations where it is not
feasible to obtain sufficient information from the pre-COVID-19 patients, it may be advisable to support
the interim analysis with historical data (Van Lancker et al, 2019). Sooriyarachchi et al (2006) proposed a
score test for incorporating binary assessments taken at three fixed time points. Galbraith and Marschner
(2003) expanded the likelihood-based approach described in Marschner and Becker (2001) to continuous
endpoints assessed at an arbitrary number of follow-up times with a proposition of extending the topic to
group sequential designs or conditional power approaches. This approach was generalized by Hampson
and Jennison (2013) to a group sequential design with delayed responses.
A shortcoming of these approaches is that they do not take into account baseline covariates in order to
make fully efficient use of the information in the data. In addition, the incorporation of baseline covariates
and longitudinal measurement of the clinical outcome is likely to involve a heavier dependence on statistical
modelling, which raises concerns that their misspecification may result in bias. This problem is overcome
by Van Lancker et al (2020). They propose an interim procedure that is applicable for binary and continuous
outcomes assessed at an arbitrary number of follow-up times and that allows the incorporation of baseline
covariates in order to increase efficiency. They realise this by considering the estimation of the treatment
effect at the time of the interim analysis as a missing data problem. This problem is addressed by employing
specific prediction models for the long-term endpoint which allow, besides multiple short-term endpoints,
the incorporation of baseline covariate information. When measurements are taken at three different timepoints (baseline, intermediate and final), the probability of a successful primary endpoint in each treatment
arm is estimated by
1. fitting a model for Lj on Sj and the baseline covariates in the cohort of patients for whom all data is
available, and using the model to make predictions L̂j for all patients for whom Sj is observed
2. fitting a model for L̂j on the baseline covariates in the cohort of people for whom Sj is observed,
3. taking the mean of the predictions based on the model in Step 2 for all patients recruited at the time
of the interim analysis.
Implementing their estimator for the treatment difference in the conditional power approach improves decision making at an interim analysis both for futility stopping and sample size re-assessment without compromising the type I error rate, even if the prediction models are misspecified.
The method differs from the previous ones as the proposed interim test statistic, denoted by zτ , is used as
the first-stage test statistic z1 . This is allowed as they provide a second stage test statistic that is independent
of their proposed interim test statistic zτ ,
√
z − τ zτ
,
z2 = √
1−τ
where z is the final test statistic based on primary endpoint data only and τ is the information fraction at the
time of the interim analysis. This allows for statistical hypothesis testing at the interim analysis. However,
8

the type I error will be compromised if information other than the current test statistic is used for interim
decisions. In that case, the type I error can be preserved by defining the first stage p-value by the cohort of
patients included before the interim analysis (e.g. Friede et al, 2011; Jenkins et al, 2011).
Similarly, care has to be taken when applying flexible study designs to time to event data (Brückner et al,
2018). When data are separated into stages by the occurrence of the primary event, the type I error will be
compromised if information other than the current logrank test statistic is used for interim decisions (Bauer
and Posch, 2004). If short-term endpoints are to be used, Jenkins et al (2011) proposed to base the separation
on patients instead of on events. Similar as for other endpoints, this would mean that the primary event for
patients who were included before the COVID-19 impact but did experience their primary event only after
that impact, would need to be analysed together with those occurring before the impact. Depending on the
actual impact, it may be appropriate to either use these patients as a separate cohort – in which case their
short-term endpoint should not be used for decision making – or to artificially censor them at the impact
timepoint and use their complete data for supplemental analyses only.
In addition, the described methodology is also appropriate for interim analyses that take into account
post-COVID-19 data if one can assume that the missing mechanism due to COVID-19-related drop-out is
missing completely at random. In the Appendix of Van Lancker et al (2020) an extension of their method
that allows the weaker assumption that missingness is at random is discussed. An alternative for the other
methods is to consider more detailed informative missingness models (e.g., via multiple imputation (Sterne
et al, 2009)).

3.5

A Bayesian perspective

Inter-patient heterogeneity as well as intra-patients heterogeneity are both very common in clinical trials.
In COVID-19, however, several types of heterogeneity might add to the ususal level of variability. These
include (1) patients infected or not by COVID-19, especially incidence of COVID-19 variability per country
in international multi-center trials, (2) patients outcomes (in cancer studies is the present mortality due to
the disease or immunosuppressed systems), (3) patients follow-up, and (4) patients compliance due to
missing treatments. One way of considering these types of heterogeneity is to use Bayesian approaches
during, if possible at all, or at the end of the trial. Using hierarchical Bayesian methods associated with
Bayesian evidence synthesis methods will allow to account for different type of heterogeneity (Friede et
al, 2017; Röver et al, 2016; Thall and Wathen, 2008). These approaches take into account uncertainty in
estimating the between-trial or subgroup heterogeneity but they can also be used in the setting of withintrial heterogeneity. By using potential variation of the scale parameter of the heterogeneity prior would
facilitate sensitivity analyses. Friede et al (2017) proposed a Bayesian random-effects meta-analyses with
priors covering plausible heterogeneity values. In the setting of within-trial heterogeneity prior calibration
of each source of heterogeneity is at most interest, indeed one should not be limited to methods accounting
for only one source of heterogeneity as more than one type can be present. Let φ be the within-trial standard
deviation, it determines the degree of heterogeneity across patients either included before or after COVID19 pandemic or patients infected or not by COVID-19 (or any other COVID-19 source of heterogeneity)
and µ the parameter of interest. Under Bayesian inference, uncertainty for φ is automatically accounted
for and inference for µ and φ can be captured by the joint posterior distribution of the two parameters.
The key point is in the choice of the prior distribution of φ, in particular when subgroups are small or
unbalanced. In the absence of relevant external data or information about within-trial heterogeneity, the
95% prior interval of φ should capture small to large heterogeneity. Moreover, the use of a Bayesian
approach entails the question of what constitutes sensible prior information in the context of COVID-19 in
which there is a continual updating of information that is still not considered reliable. This may be argued
on the basis of the endpoint in question, that is, what is the plausible amount of heterogeneity expected, what
constitutes relevant external data, and how this information may be utilized. A relatively simple solution
would be the use of weakly informative priors. For priors of effect parameters, adaptive priors using power
or commensurate prior approaches have proved to be efficient in updating if, when and how to incorporate
external information (Hobbs et al, 2012; Ollier et al, 2019).

Resizing the trial

In the following we develop approaches to resizing a clinical trial affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Specifically, we consider to stop a trial early, the use of group-sequential designs, and sample size adjustment. All methods are implemented in a freely available R shiny app, which is briefly introduced in Section
4.6.

4.1

Almost done: To stop or not to stop early

In case data collection is nearly finished at the time of the COVID-19 impact, a natural question that comes
into mind is whether one should analyze the trial early based on the data collected so far accepting some
loss in power. In the following, we focus on superiority trials comparing a treatment versus placebo (or
standard treatment) with allocation ratio 1 : r for placebo versus treatment. Let α denote the one-sided
significance level and 1 − β the desired power at the planning stage of the trial.
Assume that the endpoint of interest follows a normal distribution. Let δ denote the assumed difference
between the means under the alternative hypothesis and let σ 2 denote the common variance for both arms.
The total sample size N needed to achieve a desired power of 1 − β is then given by
2

N = (z1−α + z1−β )

σ 2 (r + 1)2
δ2
r

(1)

with z1−α and z1−β denoting the 1 − α- and 1 − β-quantile of the cumulative standard normal distribution.
We assume that the trial was originally planned to be analyzed based on N observed patients but so far has
only data available for n = τ N patients. Solving Equation (1) for 1 − β and replacing N with n yields the
power if the trial is analyzed early based on the data observed:
 r

√
r
δ
n − z1−α
1 − βn =Φ
(2)
σ (r + 1)2
where Φ(·) denotes the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution. However, as
n = τ N = (τ (z1−α + z1−β )2 σ 2 (r + 1)2 )/(δ 2 r), we can show that the resulting power can be rewritten as
 r

σ (r + 1)
which is independent of the allocation ratio r, the difference between the means δ and the variance σ 2 .
Instead the power based on n available patients only depends on the fraction τ as well as the significance
level α and the desired power 1 − β at planning stage.
Resulting values for the power depending on the information fraction τ are shown in Figure 2 (black
dotted line) and Table 1. For a desired power of 1 − β = 0.80, if data is available for about 80% (τ = 0.80)
of the planned patients, the absolute loss in power for the fixed design is about 10 percentage points while
for a planned power of 1 − β = 0.90, the loss in power is about 7 percentage points.

4.2

Blinded sample size reestimation

In Section 3.1 we touched upon blinded adaptations. Here we make some comments specifically on blinded
sample size reestimation. Blinded sample size reestimation procedures are well established to account
for misspecifications of nuiscance paramters in the planning phase of a trial (Friede and Kieser, 2013).
In this situation considered, namely the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, a number of circumstances
might make a resizing of the trial necessary and, as discussed, could be addressed in a blinded sample size
review. In particular, censoring of follow-up might make it necessary to assess the sample size and lenght of
follow-up. This would be of particular importance in long running trials, particularly prevalent in chronic
conditions. In the context of heart failure trials, Anker et al (2020) suggested to censor observations due
to regional COVID-19 outbreaks. Such actions would imply a resizing of the trial, potentially in terms
of number of patients recruited and length of follow-up, to maintain previously set or in the light of the
pandemic revised timelines (Friede et al, 2019).

Switching from a fixed to a group-sequential design

Assume that a fixed design was planned with N patients to be analyzed. However, only n patients have been
observed so far. The question is now, whether we can change to a group-sequential design (GSD) using the
n patients for the first stage while the final sample size is still N . That is, the trial is analyzed as a group
sequential design using the total sample size from the fixed design. The difference between Section 4.1 and
the situation here is, that we will adjust the critical value to allow for two tests of the null hypothesis.
Let c1 and c2 denote the critical values for a two-stage design and let τ = n/N denote fraction of data
being used for the first stage. The variance-covariance matrix for the two test statistics for the first stage
and the final analysis is given by

As in Section 4.1, the resulting power does only depend on the values for the significance level α, the
desired power 1 − β at planning stage and the fraction of data available at interim τ . It also depends on the
critical values chosen to control the type I error rate.
The top row of Figure 2 shows the resulting power depending on the information fraction τ for a planned
desired power of either 1 − β = 0.80 (left-hand panel) or 1 − β = 0.90 (right-hand panel).
Table 1 lists the resulting power for some values of τ for a desired power of either 80% oder 90%. The
first column gives the value for τ , columns 2 to 6 give the resulting power for the fixed design as well as for
both stages the Pocock and the O’Brien-Fleming design for a desired power of 1 − β = 0.80, and columns
7 to 11 give the achieved power for a desired power of 1 − β = 0.90. The first set of lines assume that there
is no dilution effect (see Section 4.4) for patients enrolled into the trial after the COVID-19 outbreak while
the second set assumed that the dilution effect is η = 0.10. For example, if 80% of the planned data has
been collected before the COVID-19 outbreak, the resulting power for a fixed design is 0.707 if the planned
power is 1 − β = 0.80. Using a Pocock GSD, the power for the first stage is 0.653 while the overall power
at the end of the second stage is 0.78. For the O’Brien-Fleming GSD, the power for the first stage is 0.597,
while the overall power is 0.792.

4.4

Dilution effect η

Another likely scenario is that due to the COVID-19 outbreak the response to the treatment has changed
2
and maybe even the response to the control treatment. Let µc0 and σc0
denote the mean and the variance
2
for the control group before the outbreak and let µc1 and σc1
denote the mean and variance for the control
group after the outbreak. Analogously, the means and variances for the treatment group before and after the
2
2
outbreak are denoted with µt0 , µt1 , σt0
, and σt1
. Let δ = µt0 − µc0 denote the treatment effect before the
outbreak started. The difference between the means after the outbreak started can then be expressed as a
fraction of the difference before the outbreak started, i.e. µt1 − µc1 = (1 − η)δ. In the following, η will be
called the dilution effect. The patients are randomized to control and treatment in a 1 : r ratio. Assume that
at the time of the outbreak n = τ N patients have been enrolled into the trial and that it is planned to enroll
a total of N patients. Let t0 denote the test statistic based on only the patients enrolled before the outbreak
and let t1 denote the test statistic based on only the patients enrolled after the outbreak. Furthermore, let t
denote the test based on all enrolled patients.
With respect to the change of the means after the outbreak, two possible definitions can be thought of
1. relative change of means: µc1 = (1 − ηc )µc0 and µt1 = (1 − ηt )µt0 ,
2. absolute change of means: µc1 = µc0 − c and µt1 = µt0 − t .
Using c = ηc µc0 and t = ηt µt0 (or alternatively, ηc = c /µc0 and ηt = t /µt0 ), it can be shown that both
approaches can be converted into one another. For the variances, we only consider a relative change of the
2
2
2
2
= ψt σt0
.
variance and define σc1
= ψc σc0
and σt1
A common assumption is that the variances for the treatment and the control group are the same. Here,
2
2
2
2
we consider the case of σt0
= σc0
= σ02 = σ 2 and σt1
= σc1
= σ12 with ψt = ψc = ψ and σ12 = ψσ02 .
That is, we assume equal variances for the two arms but not necessarily equal variances before and after the
outbreak. The joint distribution of t1 , t2 , and t is then given by

The general solution for the joint distribution can be found in Appendix A.1.
As before, we assume that the original sample size was planned using a one-sided significance level of

As shown in Sections 4.1 and 4.3, the resulting distribution depends on the values for the significance level
α, the desired power 1 − β, and the fraction of data available for the outbreak τ . In the case considered
here, the only additional variable is the dilution effect η.
Figure 2 shows the resulting values for the power depending on the information fraction τ for a dilution
effect of η = 0, η = 0.10, and η = 0.20. The upper two plots show the achieved power for a dilution
effect of η = 0 (see Section 4.4), the middle plots show the power for a dilution effect of η = 0.1, and
the bottom plots for a dilution effect of η = 0.5. The black dotted line gives the resulting values for the
power for the fixed design if analyzed early, the black lines give the resulting power for the Pocock design
for the first stage (dashed line) and overall (solid line), and the gray lines give the resulting power for the
O’Brien-Fleming design for the first stage (dashed line) and overall (solid line). It should be noted that the
power for the fixed design as well as the power for the first stage for the GSDs does not change as analyses
only uses first stage data which was collected before the outbreak.
In conclusion, if at least 85% of the data are available and no considerable dilution effect is expected,
then the recommendation would be to stop the trial immediately. In all other scenarios, consequences of
any decision would need explored carefully using the approaches developed. As we will see in Section 4.6
below, these are implemented in a R Shiny app to support this process.

4.5

Sample size adjustment

As shown in Section 4.4, some loss in power is to be expected if the means and variances for the treatment
and control arm change due to the outbreak. In order to regain the desired power of 1 − β, the sample
size would need to be adjusted. For a fixed design that is analyzed only once, i.e. after all data has been
collected from all patients enrolled before and after the outbreak, the sample size for patients enrolled after
the outbreak can be calculated as shown below. Let n0 denote the number of patients already enrolled into
the trial before the outbreak and let ñ1 denote the number to be enrolled after the outbreak started. We wish
to determine ñ1 so that the power based on a total of Ñ = n0 + ñ1 enrolled patients is 1 − β.
Based on Equation (8), we know that the final test statistic t follows a normal distribution with

The derivations can be found in Appendix A.2. In order to find the sample size for the second part of the
trial for a GSD, a search algorithm based on Equation (8) has to be used.
Please note that the dilution effect η cannot be estimated from the data, but need to be hypothesized. Of
course sensitivity analyzes can be conducted based on different assumptions. The R shiny app introduced

Implementation of the resizing approaches in a R shiny app

To facilitate the implementation of the proposed methods, an R shiny app was developed as a simple-to-use
web-based application. It provides insights into the power properties on the fly, given user-defined input
of design parameters. Specifically, it has a module for the calculations shown in Section 4.1 to answer the
following question: If a trial was designed for 90% power for an assumed treatment effect at a significance
level α = 0.025, what is the power if we conduct the analysis with only 85% of the patient data? By
following (3), the app provides the power (84.8%) and a plot for different proportions of data available, in
addition to 85%. A screenshot of the app is provided in Figure 3.
The app was originally designed to facilitate the discussion by Akacha et al (2020), where the same
calculation as (3) was independently developed. The app is expanded to implement the group sequential design of an interim analysis conducted with data available and a final analysis when the planned
data is obtained (see Section 4.3). Two popular group sequential designs are considered which are the
Pocock and the O’Brien-Fleming schemes. In addition, the incorporation of dilution effects allows for
more general considerations, as demonstrated in Section 4.4. Similar outputs as in displayed Figure 3 are
provided with the app for the various scenarios considered above. The app can be accessed at https:
//power-implications.shinyapps.io/prod/ and comes with a help tab that contains more
information about its usage.

Regulatory and operational aspects

The COVID-19 pandemic affects all clinical trials, with implications for studies intended for drug regulation
well beyond statistical aspects (EMA , 2020a,b; FDA , 2020). For example, on-site monitoring of most trials
is suspended during the lockdown and with the interdiction of non-essential travels the recording of adverse
events might not be as good if a site visit is replaced by a telephone consultation, or a local laboratory was
used instead of the central laboratory. Similarly, the mode of administration of a patient reported outcomes
questionnaire might have been changed from an electronic collection at the site on a tablet computer to a
paper based version mailed to the patient’s home. All these examples may lead to a reduced quality of the
trial data which may need to be taken into consideration when interpreting the trial.
As much remains to be learned on the COVID-19 disease manifestations, treatments and pandemic distribution, it appears necessary to monitor the status and integrity of the trial on an ongoing basis. However,
it may not be clear in some situations how this can be done in a way that protects the integrity of trial conduct. Care has to be taken that the original responsibilities of a DMC are not expanded beyond reasonable
limits. Many of the responsibilities arising during the pandemic might more naturally seem to belong to
trial management personnel, as the associated issues can often be addressed adequately without access to
unblinded data; this might involve sponsor personnel, steering committees, etc. If important decisions are
advised by unblinded results, then of course this should be done through a DMC. But many other decisions
may not require unblinded access. Some, including initiating a sample size re-assessment or updating a
study’s final statistical analysis plan (SAP), could be very problematic in terms of validly interpreting final
analysis results if initiated by a party with access to unblinded interim results such as a DMC. In current
practice and supported by prior regulatory guidance, such decisions are generally initiated by parties remaining blinded. Of course the DMC should be kept fully aware of any changes implemented in a trial,
and should comment if they have any concerns. But for actions taken based upon blinded data, there are
generally no confidentiality concerns, and sponsors can enlist any experts who can help arrive at the best
decisions.
Establishing a qualified DMC when one was not previously felt to be needed can be challenging and
time consuming during the pandemic. Attempting to ensure that DMC members have full understanding
of all relevant background for the important tasks they will be assigned to, compared to trial personnel or
steering committee members who will already have such perspective, could be risky. Thus, if an unblinded
DMC is felt necessary to be established, given the challenges of identifying and implementing such a group
quickly, an internal firewalled group might thus be considered as an option in some cases.
COVID-19 affects ongoing clinical trials in many different ways, which in turns affects many aspects
of statistical inference, which are best described in the estimand framework laid out by ICH (2019). An
estimand provides a precise description of the treatment effect reflecting the clinical question posed by the
trial objective. It summarizes at a population-level what the outcomes would be in the same patients under different treatment conditions being compared. Central to the estimand framework introduced in ICH
(2019) are intercurrent events, which occur after treatment initiation that affect either the interpretation or
the existence of the measurements associated with the clinical question of interest. Generally, the intercurrent events due to COVID-19 can be categorized into those that are more of an administrative or operational
nature (e.g. treatment discontinuation due to drug supply issues), and those that are more directly related to
the effect of COVID-19 on the health status of subjects (e.g. treatment discontinuation due to COVID-19
symptoms), see Akacha et al (2020). However, the additional intercurrent events are introducing ambiguity
to the original research question and teams need to discuss how to account for them (Akacha et al, 2017a,b;
Qu and Lipkovich , 2020).
Care has to be taken when employing an adaptive design methodology to combine e.g. the information
before and after the COVID-19 outbreak. When each stage of an adaptive design is based on a different
estimand, the interpretability of the statistical inference may be hampered. If, for example, the pandemic
markedly impacts the trial population after the outbreak because elderly and those with underlying conditions such as asthma, diabetes etc. are at higher risk and therefore excluded from the trial, then this would
lead to different stagewise estimands (due to the different population attributes) and limit the overall trial
interpretation. The situation is different in adaptive designs with a preplanned selection of a population at an
interim analysis (as this does not change the estimand), when following the usual recommendations for an
adequately planned trial (which includes the need to pre-specify the envisaged adaptation in the study pro-

16

tocol). Care has also to be taken if the pattern of intercurrent events is different before and after an interim
analysis, in line with the usual recommendations to assess consistency across trial stages in an adaptive
design. Generally speaking, as the definition of an adaptive design implies that we are considering a trial
design, it needs to be aligned to the estimands that reflect the trial objectives according to ICH (2019).
The considerations in the previous paragraph are closely related to the trial homogeneity issues discussed in Section 3.3. One particular concern is the possible shift in the study population after the onset of
the pandemic. At present we see a notable decline in hospital admissions for non COVID-19 related diseases. It can be assumed that patients with less severe problems tend to postpone a hospital stay for fear of
an infection in the hospital or for not putting stress on the already overloaded health system in some countries. Although standard trial procedures like randomization assures the validity of the statistical hypothesis
test, it is unclear which population’s treatment effect is actually being estimated.
The challenges imposed by the pandemic will lead to difficulties in meeting protocol-specified procedures in many instances, thus requiring the need to change aspects of ongoing trials. It is then important to
be mindful about the fact that pre-specification of the study protocol and the SAP is the corner stone to avoid
operational bias in any clinical trial. Although the ICH (1998) guideline allows changing the SAP even
shortly before unblinding a trial, this if often viewed as critical by stakeholders. Changing the characteristics of a trial based on unblinded trial data always requires appropriate measures to control the type I error
rate whereas changes triggered by external data are often seen more lenient. In the case of changes to the
conduct and/or analysis of a trial caused by the pandemic it is reasonable to assume that such changes are
not triggered by the knowledge gained from the ongoing trial. Still, changes will have to be pre-specified
and documented, as appropriate. It is recommended to pre-specify key analyses important to interpret the
objectives of the trial in the statistical analysis plan, in particular analyses related to the inferential testing
strategy. Therefore we suggest to consider first whether different analyses are needed for the primary or key
secondary objectives. Other analyses that have a more exploratory character can be included in a separate
exploratory analysis planning. If any impact is detected that warrant additional analyses in the clinical study
report, then these can be added later.
After the lockdown measures will be eased in future, the medical practice may not return to the state
before the onset of the pandemic. Social distancing measures may be kept in place and it is to be expected
that the trend of, for example, fewer hospital admissions for minor cases will continue to some extent.
Nevertheless, certain trials interrupted by the pandemic will be able to restart, albeit in a possibly changed
environment. The trial of the long acting contraceptive (Section 2.1) was largely unaffected by the onset
of the pandemic. The START:REACTS trial (Section 2.2) had changed its endpoint to a PRO measure that
can be observed remotely if a patient does not wish to come to the clinic. This trial can restart recruitment
when elective surgeries will be again possible, albeit with the new endpoint as the original endpoint was
not always measured during the lockdown measures. The ATALANTE 1 trial (Section 2.3) was stopped for
ethical reasons due to the study population being at high risk of COVID-19. As the trial did not proceed
to its second stage, consultations with agencies have started to discuss the partial results in view of the
clinical unmet need. Such discussion will be likely focus also on the loss of power even if first stage
was promising. This begs the question, how promising the first stage results should have been to provide
convincing evidence if a dilution of the treatment effect cannot be excluded a priori and the considerations
in Section 4 of this paper may support such discussions. Lastly, the CAPE-Covid and the CAPE-Cod
studies (Section 2.4) are both addressing ICU patients with two kind of pneumonia. There is heterogeneity
in disease and patients prognostic. For the moment, the CAPE-Cod trial is temporarily stopped but is
planned to restart next autumn. As the investigators had no choice than to embed a trial within the other,
heterogeneity will need to be addressed at the end of the study in order to preserve both results.

Discussion

The COVID-19 pandemic has not only led to a surge a clinical research activities in developing treatments,
diagnostics and vaccines to fight the pandemic, but also impacted in many ways on ongoing trials. Here
we illustrated the negative effects the pandemic might have on trials by giving four examples from ongoing
studies and describing the considerations and consequences in reaction to the pandemic. Furthermore, we
focused here on the role of adaptive designs in mitigating the risks of the pandemic which might result in a
large number of inconclusive or misleading trials. Aspects that are of particular importance here are type I
17

error rate control and treatment-effect heterogeneity. When trials are affected, the question to stop the trial
early or to continue the trial, possibly with modifications is of particular interest. Considering normally
distributed outcomes we developed a range of strategies. We believe that these are transferable to other
types of outcomes with only limited modifications.

Now, if τ η 2 − 1 + ψ = 0 and replacing ψ = 1 − τ η 2 , we get
