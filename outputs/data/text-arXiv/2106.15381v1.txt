Place of Occurrence of COVID-19 Deaths in the
UK: Modelling and Analysis

Abstract—We analysed publicly available data on place of
occurrence of COVID-19 deaths from national statistical agencies
in the UK between March 9 2020 and February 28 2021. We
introduce a modified Weibull model that describes the deaths
due to COVID-19 at a national and place of occurrence level.
We observe similar trends in the UK where deaths due to COVID19 first peak in Homes, followed by Hospitals and Care Homes
1-2 weeks later in the first and second waves. This is in line
with the infectious period of the disease, indicating a possible
transmission vehicle between the settings. Our results show that
the first wave is characterised by fast growth and a slow reduction
after the peak in deaths due to COVID-19. The second and
third waves have the converse property, with slow growth and a
rapid decrease from the peak. This difference may result from
behavioural changes in the population (social distancing, masks,
etc). Finally, we introduce a double logistic model to describe
the dynamic proportion of COVID-19 deaths occurring in each
setting. This analysis reveals that the proportion of COVID-19
deaths occurring in Care Homes increases from the start of
the pandemic and past the peak in total number of COVID19 deaths in the first wave. After the catastrophic impact in the
first wave, the proportion of COVID-19 deaths occurring in Care
Homes gradually decreased from is maximum after the first wave
indicating residence were better protected in the second and third
waves compared to the first.

I. I NTRODUCTION

T

HE coronavirus pandemic is one of the biggest public
health issues ever experienced. The rapid spread of
COVID-19, which is caused by Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [1], has led to worldwide
spread [2] and significant interventions from governments
around the world [3]. In the UK, the government issued a
national lockdown in March 2020 to stop the spread. Following an easing of national restrictions, experts are warning
of a successive waves of COVID-19 in the UK. The first
wave of COVID-19 in the UK had a devastating impact.
The catastrophic effect in Care Homes across the UK was
widely reported [4]–[6] due to a greater risk of outbreak [7],
excess death [8] and a delay in reporting of the data [9].
The impact on hospitals has been significant. With resources
focused on COVID patients other healthcare needs, such as
surgeries, cancer treatments, and routine appointments, have
been deprioritised. The recent vaccines could help the fight
against the pandemic, though regulatory and logistical barriers
mean that this will not be a short term solution. As COVID19 cases and deaths continues to rise in the UK, and with

the emergence of new strains of the virus, understanding the
trends in the disease on a population level can help national
and regional policies to prevent further deaths. Analysis of
population level data can lead to improvements for disease
incidence estimates, prediction of infection prevalence, and
decision making at a national scale [10].
A large number of studies have focused on using medical
imaging data to diagnosing COVID-19 patients or classification of the severity of the disease [11]–[17]. These studies have
aimed to better understand the markers to identify COVID-19
and alleviate the workload for medical professionals, though a
recent review found that methods are currently not of clinical
use due to methodological flaws or underlying biases [18].
Beyond imaging data, other studies analysing COVID-19 data
have focused on infection or transmission of the disease [19],
comparing strategic response [20], or identifying risk factors
[21]. Tracking and modelling of infection or mortality rates is
challenging due to asymptomatic cases and testing accuracy
[22], [23]. This was particularly difficult at the start of the
pandemic where community testing was not available. More
recent studies have looked at the effects of COVID-19 and
national lockdown on mental health [24]–[26]. To date there
have been few studies on how COVID-19 mortality varies in
different settings within a nation. Analysis of the pandemic in
different counties or regions have compared the evolution of
the disease [27] or government responses to the pandemic [3],
[28]. However, we have found no studies looking at different
healthcare and domestic settings within a nation, or the trends
in mortality due to COVID-19.
We aim to model the “place of occurrence” (Hospitals,
Care Homes, Homes, etc) of COVID-19 deaths in the UK.
We analyse data available from national statistical agencies
throughout the pandemic. We consider both deaths due to
COVID-19 (where COVID-19 is mentioned on the death
certificate) and deaths from all causes.
II. M ETHODS
In this work we focus specifically on the place of occurrence
of death for both COVID-19 and all deaths from national statistical agencies. COVID-19 related deaths include any death
where Coronavirus or COVID-19 (suspected or confirmed)
was mentioned anywhere on the death certificate from all data
sources. The data is from date of death registration and thus
there may be a delay between death occurrence and death
registration. Weeks run from Monday to Sunday and are based
on the ISO8601 international standard for week numbering.
Data are correct as of the week ending the 28th of February
2021.

MODELLING COVID-19 DEATHS IN THE UK

A. Statistical Agency Data
The Office for National Statistics (ONS) records weekly
provisional counts of the number of deaths registered in
England and Wales [29]. These data include a break-down
of England and Wales for total deaths and COVID-19 related
deaths that occur in Homes, Hospitals (acute or community,
not psychiatric), Hospices, Care Homes, Other Communal
Establishment (OCE) (e.g. schools for people with learning disabilities; holiday homes and hotels; common lodging
houses; aged persons’ accommodation; assessment centres;
schools; convents and monasteries; nurses’ homes), or Elsewhere. Note that this data includes all deaths where COVID19 is mentioned on the death certificate and is not limited to
deaths within 28-days of a positive COVID-19 test. Data from
the ONS provides these breakdowns for England and Wales
separately and collectively.
The National Records of Scotland (NRS) [30] records the
total and COVID-19 related deaths that occur in Care Homes,
Homes / Non-institutions, Hospitals and Other institutions (e.g.
clinics, medical centres, prisons and schools) recorded at the
health board and council area level. We sum the health board
deaths for each place of occurrence for both COVID-19 and
total death rates to compare to the ONS data. We treat Other
institutions from the NRS data as equivalent to OCE in the
ONS data given their definitions.
The Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency
(NISRA) [31] only records data on the place of occurrence
for COVID-19 deaths at the weekly level and the total number
of deaths from all causes in these places is not available. The
total number of deaths and deaths due to COVID-19 for place
of occurrence at the monthly level from January to June 2020
were obtained following an ad-hoc data request to NISRA.
We use the monthly data for all calculations involving the
total number of deaths at each location and use the weekly
data for calculations involving only COVID-19 deaths.
We combine data from the ONS, NRS and NISRA to get
data for the entire UK. We use the combined totals for England
and Wales published by ONS as these include non-residents
[29]. The total deaths in Northern Ireland at the weekly level is
not available and omitted in the UK total deaths calculations.
Data for deaths due to COVID-19 for Northern Ireland is
included in our calculations of COVID-19 deaths in the UK.
The monthly NISRA data show there have been 9,014 total
deaths and 830 COVID-19 deaths in Northern Ireland between
January and June 2020. This compares to 208,989 total deaths
and 51,072 COVID-19 deaths from the rest of the UK over the
same period, hence the omission of the Northern Ireland data
from the total deaths in the UK is likely to have a negligible
impact.

reflect the number of time points for each location in the data.
The time points are weekly counts for total deaths dT or deaths
due to COVID-19 dC across the p locations. Clearly d is a
function of time.
B. Aligning Northern Ireland Data
The Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency
(NISRA) [31] only records data on the place of occurrence for
COVID-19 deaths at the weekly level with the equivalent data
for deaths from all causes not available. Following an ad-hoc
data request to the NISRA place of occurrence data for deaths
due to COVID-19 and all causes were provided at monthly
intervals between Jan and June 2020. The monthly data is
used to calculate the proportion of deaths due to COVID-19
in Northern Ireland, defined in Eq. (3). The weekly data is used
to calculate the proportion of COVID-19 deaths occurring at
each place of occurrence, defined in Eq. (5), due to its better
time resolution.
For comparison to data from the rest of the UK, we align
the Northern Ireland COVID-19 deaths from all places in the
monthly data to the COVID-19 deaths from all places in the
weekly data, see Fig. 1. The year week assigned to each point
remains within the month the point originated from, that is no
points have been moved to an different month based on this
alignment. The aligned data is used for comparison with the
rest of the UK in terms of peak timing and magnitude.
C. Deaths due to COVID-19
We propose the use of several dynamic normalisations
for the place of occurrence death data in order to compare
different time points, locations and population across the UK.
These also account for the differences in population across
the UK and for temporal changes to total number due to the
disease evolution. We normalise the number of COVID-19

When normalised as Eq. (2), and equivalently Eq. (3), the data
follow a Weibull type distribution [32]. Similarly, infection
transmission of COVID-19 also follows a Weibull distribution
[19], [22]. We also modify the model from a traditional
Weibull distribution by replacing the typical coefficient α β −1
with γ, which is proportional to α β −1 , as this leads a higher
R2 when modelling the data. The resulting model is a modified
Weibull distribution given as
−β−1

(t−µ) −β
(t − µ)

e−( α ) ,
W (t) = γ
α
for time point t and µ the earliest point in the weekly data.
Here α, β and γ are fitting parameters that relate to the
maximum value of the distribution (γ), the variable at the peak
of the distribution (α), and the shape of the distribution (β).
This model follows the distribution of COVID-19 deaths in
the data for each wave of the disease by selecting µ. Note We
are using the form of the inverse Weibull distribution (also
known as Fréchet distribution) [33] which includes a − sign
before each β term in the equation. This is due to the first
wave following the inverse form, with latter waves follow the
original Weibull form (see Section III). For brevity and clarity
we use only one form of the Weibull distribution (the inverse)
and quote negative values for β in latter waves of the pandemic
even though it is a shape parameter.

the decay term.
Other distributions have been considered in place of Eq. (4)
and Eq. (6), including log-normal and Lévy distributions and
polynomials of several orders, however, these did not produce
satisfactory fits to the data in terms of R2 and thus have been
omitted.

E. Levenberg-Marquardt Optimisation
For both models in Eq. (4) and Eq. (6) using LevenbergMarquardt Optimisation in order to fit the data. For the
optimisation of parameters θ in the model g(θ),
θ̂ ∈ argminθ S(θ) ≡ argminθ ||D − g(θ)||2 ,

(7)

where g(θ) is either Eq. (4) or Eq. (6), we use the LevenbergMarquardt nonlinear least squares [34]. This iteratively updates the estimate of θ with θ + δ where g(θ + δ) is
approximated as
g(θ + δ) ≈ g(θ) + Jδ ,

(8)

D. Proportion of COVID-19 Deaths
We also normalise the total number of COVID-19 deaths
at each location dC
i to the total number of COVID-19 deaths
at all locations for a given week. This dynamic normalisation
yields the proportion of COVID-19 deaths at location i for
each time step, formally,
DiC

This yields the proportion of COVID-19 deaths at each place

Here the first part of the equation describes the growth of the

of the curve with time t. Parameter λ controls the maximum
value in the curve, νg and νd control the steepness of the
growth and decay components respectively. Parameter κg is

we obtain S(θ) ≈ ||D −g(θ)−Jδ||2 , and setting the derivative

using the Levenberg-Marquardt method due to its ability to
solve nonlinear equations and ill-conditioned problems [36].
The optimisation is run with a stopping criteria of a minimum
tolerance of 10−4 g at each step and a maximum of 200
iterations. The full workflow for the data analysis is given
in Fig. 2.

MODELLING COVID-19 DEATHS IN THE UK

III. R ESULTS AND D ISCUSSIONS

50

A. Deaths due to COVID-19 National Level
The proportion of deaths due to COVID-19 in all nations in
the UK are well described by the modified Weibull distribution
(see Fig. 3). Each of the three waves of the pandemic are
well described (R2 ≥ 0.95) and the overall distribution is
a combination of the individual models for each wave. It
is possible to extend the model to optimise the number of
waves to the data, however this would increase the number
of parameters and we do not have sufficient data for this (28
time points). Hence we fit each wave separately with the first,
second and third wave fitted between weeks 10 and 38, 38 and
51 in 2020, and 51 and 8 ranging 2020 and 2021, respectively.
These models allow us to obtain descriptors of the pandemic
at each wave and compare these across the nations in the UK.
England closely follows the distribution for the entire UK as
it accounts for the majority of the population. Notably for
the first wave, deaths due to COVID-19 peak simultaneously
across the UK at ≈40%, except Northern Ireland which
peaks earlier and reaches a lower maximum. There are clear
differences in the second and third waves in the UK. All
second wave peaks are below the first wave. Scotland peaks
one week earlier than the rest of the UK, and with maximum
4.7% lower than England and 8.9% lower than Wales. The
third wave also demonstrates large differences across the UK,
peaking first in Wales, followed by Scotland and then England
1 and 1.5 weeks later respectively. Only Scotland had a peak
in the third wave that was below the first wave, 10.7% lower,
with England’s third peak 5.3% higher than the first wave and
Wales increasing by 4.1%. We note that the data for Northern
Ireland is only available for the first waves.
B. Deaths due to COVID-19 Place of Occurrence Level
Deaths due to COVID-19 at the place of occurrence level for
all the UK nation is also well described by a modified Weibull
distribution (see Fig. 4). Across all settings and nations in the
UK, the models have R2 ≥ 0.80 when more than 100 COVID19 deaths were recorded at the peak in a given wave. Hospice,
OCE and Elsewhere settings have lower R2 values for the fits,
though this is due to smaller samples sizes with maximums of
less than 10 in Wales and Scotland. In England there where
a maximum of 140 COVID-19 deaths in Hospice’s (R2 ≥
0.87), and a maximum of 40 COVID-19 deaths in both OCE
(R2 ≥ 0.70) and Elsewhere (R2 ≥ 0.61) settings. Despite the
extremely limited number of points in the Northern Ireland
data, the modified Weibull distribution models the data well
in general, see Fig. 6a. It is worth noting that there are no
recorded Elsewhere deaths in the Monthly data from Northern
Ireland, and the data For Homes has only three non zero
values that appear to be linearly decreasing hence a our model
was not fitted to these data. We will focus the discussion to
those settings with large sample numbers, specifically Homes,
Hospitals, Hospices (UK and England), and Care Homes.
As the trends in England closely follow the UK as a whole,
we will limit the discussion to England, Wales, Scotland and
Northern Ireland (first wave only) here. The peak in deaths due
to COVID-19 in the third wave of the pandemic equalled or

Fig. 1) and only available for the first wave.

exceeded the first wave in all settings in England and Wales,
with Scotland experiencing a third wave with fewer deaths
due to COVID-19 than in the first wave. For England and
Wales, deaths due to COVID-19 reached comparable peaks
in the first and third wave in hospitals, but saw significant
increases in Care Homes (5% in England and 9% in Wales).
The deaths due to COVID-19 in Homes also increased by 3%
in both England and Wales, and Hospices in England exhibited
an increase of 7% in the third wave compared to the first.
Scotland and Northern Ireland were the only nations to see
a higher proportion of deaths due to COVID-19 occurring in
Care Homes than Hospitals in the first wave.
In the first two waves, all nations experienced deaths due
to COVID-19 initially peaking in Homes, with peaks in Care
Homes and Hospitals occurring one or two weeks later. The
only exception to this was the first wave in England, where
the peaks in deaths due to COVID-19 in Homes and Hospitals
occurred in the same week. Also in England, a peak in
Hospices occurred one week after Homes in both the first
two waves. This time difference between the peaks is in line
with the infectious period of the disease [22] and indicates that
the disease may have been transmitted from Homes to Care
Homes in the UK and from Homes to Hospices in England.
The third wave exhibited more variation across the UK with
England experiencing peaks in Homes, Hospitals and Care
Homes within 0.5 weeks, and hospices following shortly after.
In Wales, the third waves peaks in deaths due to COVID19 were first experienced in Hospitals, followed by Homes
and Care Homes one and two weeks later respectively. For
Scotland, a peak was first encountered in Care Homes followed
by Homes and Hospitals two weeks later.
C. Implication of β
The sign of β in Eq. (4) determines whether the distribution
is a (modified) inverted Weibull, β > 0, or if it is a (modified)
Weibull, β < 0. Note the case where β = 0, Eq. (4) reduces

to W (t) ∝ t−1 . The sign of β affects the shape of the
distribution, specifically whether the heavy tail is on the right
side (β > 0) or on the left side (β < 0). The implication
for COVID-19 is the difference between; a rapid surge in
deaths due to COVID-19 with a slow reduction after the peak
(positive β); or a more gradual increase in cases and a rapid
recovered after the peak (negative β). The sign of β for each
nation and place of occurrence setting is given in Table I.
At the nation level, the first waves are modelled with the
inverted Weibull distribution, β > 0 (R2 ≥ 0.95), however
the second and third waves in all nations follow a Weibull
distributions, β < 0. The latter two waves are well described
by the Weibull distribution with R2 ≥ 0.95 for all cases, except
in Scotland (second and third peak) and Wales (third peak)
where R2 ≥ 0.86.
At the place of occurrence level, all nations exhibit the same
trends for Homes with β > 0 for the first and second waves,
and β < 0 for the third wave. Care Homes and Hospitals
had β > 0 for the first wave and β < 0 for the third waves.
Some differences in the UK were experiences in the second
wave with β < 0 for Hospitals in England and Wales, and for

Care Homes in England and Scotland, with β > 0 in all other
settings.
D. Proportion of COVID-19 Deaths
When normalising to the number of COVID-19 deaths at
each place of occurrence to the total number of COVID-19
deaths for each week, Eq. (5), the data broadly follow a double
logistic distribution described by Eq. (6). The data deviate
from this model when the sample size is small between the
first and second waves when there are few COVID-19 deaths.
There appears to be some finer structure occurring before the
second wave and at the peak of the third wave. More data
maybe required to capture this additional behavior.
In the first wave, the greatest contribution to COVID-19
deaths are from Hospitals and Care Homes across nations
in the UK. The data for Hospitals, following normalisation
as Eq. (5), are fitted to 100 − f (t) where f (t) is given in
Eq. (6) as this yielded higher R2 (100 is selected as the
scale is percentage). At the start of the pandemic almost
all COVID-19 deaths occur in Hospitals. This proportion

rapidly decreases reaching a minimum at or after the peak
in number of COVID-19 deaths, see Fig. 5. In concordance
with a decrease Hospitals, the proportion of COVID-19 deaths
that occur in Care Homes rapidly increase at the start of
the pandemic reaching a maximum after the peak in number
of COVID-19 deaths. The delay between the peaks in total
number of COVID-19 deaths and the proportion occurring in
Care Homes (DC ) highlights the vulnerability of Care Home
residence and need for better protective measures.
After the catastrophic impact in Care Homes during the
first wave, the majority of COVID-19 related deaths occurred
in Hospitals across the UK, and continued throughout the
pandemic. After the reaching a maximum shortly after the
peak in total number of COVID-19 deaths in the first wave,
the proportion of COVID-19 deaths in Care Homes has continued to decrease gradually. Fluctuations occurring around the
second and third waves are not described by our model, which
only captures the overall trends here due to insufficient data.
In the second wave, England and Scotland saw the proportion
of COVID-19 deaths occurring in Care Homes peak around
half the maximum they reached in the first wave. For Wales,
the maximum proportion of COVID-19 deaths occurring in
Care Homes in the second wave reached approximately 2/3
that of the first wave. In the third wave, England and Wales
experience slight increases in the proportion of COVID-19
deaths in Care Homes compared to the second wave, but far
below that of the first. Scotland did not experienced another
peak in the proportion of COVID-19 deaths in Care Homes
following the second wave. Throughout the third wave in
Scotland the proportion of COVID-19 deaths in Hospitals
increased. In all nations the proportion of COVID-19 deaths
in Care Homes is lower in the second and third waves of
the pandemic compared to the first, indicating protection for
residence may have improved after the first wave.

The proportion of COVID-19 deaths in Homes reached its
largest values between the first and second waves. Although
this coincided with easing of lockdown and national restrictions, it is worth noting that this is when the number of
COVID-19 deaths is extremely low compared to rest of the
pandemic, and is unlikely to correspond to an increased risk.
IV. C ONCLUSIONS
We have presented a modified Weibull distribution that
describes the trends in deaths due to COVID-19 across the
UK from national statistical agency data. Our model describes
the data during each wave of the pandemic at the national
and place of occurrence level for each nation in the UK.
Additionally, we introduce a double logistic model to broadly
describe the proportion of COVID-19 deaths in each setting
throughout the pandemic.
Modeling the data provides insight in to the evolution of
the disease mortality across these different settings allowing
retrospective analysis of strategic decision making. Due to
the coarseness of the available data, models of the data
can provide useful descriptors of the impact of COVID-19,
such as the ordering of the peaks in different regions and
settings. Specifically, we find that in the first two waves of
the pandemic, deaths due to COVID-19 first peak in Homes
followed by Hospitals and Care Homes typically peaking 12 weeks later. This time period is in line with the infectious
period of the disease and indicates that transmission to Care
Homes, which where catastrophically hit in the first wave, may
have originated from Homes.
Our model includes a shape parameter (β) whose sign
determines whether the distribution has a heavy right or left
side, with important implications for COVID-19. Our results
show that the first wave is described by a heavy right sided
distribution (positive β) where the deaths due to COVID19 rapidly increase to a peak then slowly decreasing. The
second and third waves on the other hand are described by
a heavy left sided distribution (negative β) where the increase
is slower and reduction in deaths is rapid. This difference is
potentially critical for national response with a heavy left sided
distribution (negative β) making so called ‘circuit breaker’
lockdowns very effective. Combining this with the slower
growth may result in early introduction of circuit breakers
being an effective and short term measure for controlling
COVID-19 deaths in future waves. These models can also
be used to compare the strategic responses across the UK
to inform decision making in future waves of the pandemic,
of particular importance will be future waves resulting from
new variants of the disease. The negative β values in the
latter waves maybe due to changes in behaviour such as social
distancing, masks, hand washing, etc.
We have analysed place of occurrence death data for
COVID-19 and modelled trends across the UK. This analysis
can be useful in successive waves of the COVID-19 pandemic,
including new strains and potentially in future pandemics.
Understanding the evolution of the mortality of the disease is
vital for national strategic response and within specific settings
such as Care Homes. We discuss the possible implications

of the distribution shape (heavy left or heavy right tail) and
how this could be useful in strategic response. We have
demonstrated the models application to sample sizes differing
by two orders of magnitude and suitability to weekly or
monthly data. In addition, we model all waves of the pandemic
in the UK and place of occurrence settings allowing the
determination of ordering of the peaks. This could readily be
applied to other nations, or additionally fine grain regional
data or other discriminators such as age, gender and ethnicity,
and potentially outside of COVID-19 research.
