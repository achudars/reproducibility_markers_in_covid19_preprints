Abstract
Air pollution has a wide range of implications on agriculture, economy, road accidents, and health. In this paper, we use novel
deep learning methods for short-term (multi-step-ahead) air-quality prediction in selected parts of Delhi, India. Our deep learning methods comprise of long short-term memory (LSTM) network models which also include some recent versions such as
bidirectional-LSTM and encoder-decoder LSTM models. We use a multivariate time series approach that attempts to predict air
quality for 10 prediction horizons covering total of 80 hours and provide a long-term (one month ahead) forecast with uncertainties
quantified. Our results show that the multivariate bidirectional-LSTM model provides best predictions despite COVID-19 impact
on the air-quality during full and partial lockdown periods. The effect of COVID-19 on the air quality has been significant during
full lockdown; however, there was unprecedented growth of poor air quality afterwards.

1. Introduction
The global human population has risen by more than four
times during the last century [1]. Research show that the major
growth in population is attributed to the metropolitan areas in
the less developed regions around the globe [2, 3]. The consequence of these increased levels of growth in poorly developed
states is low air quality. We note that 80% of global cities [3]
and 98% of cities in middle-income countries surpass the proposed levels of air quality [4, 5]. Increase in air pollution results
in economic losses, reduced visibility, contributes to faster climate change that contribute to extreme weather conditions, millions of premature deaths annually [6]. The major factor in air
pollution is the anthropogenic fine particulate matter (PM); i.e.
PM2.5 (particles with an aerodynamic diameter shorter than 2.5
micrometer) [7, 8, 9, 10]. Despite the concentrations of PM2.5
being two to five times higher in developing countries, most of
the air quality considerations and estimations are analyzed for
developed countries [11].
Delhi is one of the most prominent in terms of growing cities
has an estimated population of more than 19.3 million [12]. The
population density and growth in the last few decades and rapid
industrial expansion led to massive air pollution to hazardous
levels and thus failed in providing people with one of the primary life amenities, quality air. The World Economic Forum
recently reported India having 6 of the world’s 10 most polluted cities with Delhi has one of most polluted [13]. Research

shows that infected air is one of the prominent causes of premature deaths [14] and the average life span reduces due to increasing rates of air contamination [15]. It is well known that
apart from industrial pollution, agricultural fires are one of the
significant contributors of air pollution in Delhi [16].
Apart from strategies that focus on management of industrial
waste[17], it is important to model and forecast the air-quality
both in short and long-term. Machine learning methods have
been promoting for forecasting temporal sequences and their
application to air-quality forecasting has gained attention recently [18, 19, 20]. Forecasting models can be used to develop
strategies to evaluate and alarm the general public for future
hazardous levels of air quality index. Forecasting models for
air pollution concentrations can be broadly classified into two
major categories; simulation based and data driven approaches
such as statistical or machine learning methods. Simulationbased method incorporates physical and chemical models for
generating meteorological and background parameters to simulate emission, transport and chemical transformation of air pollution [21, 22]]. However, they suffer from numerical model
uncertainties and due to the lack of data, the parameterization
of aerosol emissions is restricted [23]]. Data driven approaches
exploit statistical and machine learning techniques to detect patterns between predictors and dependent variables in temporal
sequences [24, 25, 26, 27, 28]. Machine learning methods can
be used to identify the exposures relevant to health outcomes of
interest within high-dimensional data [29]. Advances in deep
learning methods give further motivations for application to domain of air-quality prediction.
Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are prominent deep learning models [30] suited for modelling temporal sequences, espeFebruary 23, 2021

cially those involving long-term dependencies [31, 32, 33, 30,
34]. Long Short Term Memory networks (LSTMs) were developed [33] to address limitations in learning long-term dependencies in sequences by canonical RNNs [35, 36]. Gated
Recurrent Unit (GRU) [37, 38] networks are more simpler to
implement but provides similar performance than LSTMs. Bidirectional RNNs connect two hidden layers of opposite directions to the same output where the output layer can get information from past and future states simultaneously [39]. This led
to bidirectional-LSTMs for phoneme classification [40] which
performed better than standard RNNs and LSTMs and has the
potential to be used for forecasting air-pollution time series.
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious
disease [41, 42, 43] which became a global pandemic [44] with
major impact to our lifestyle. COVID-19 forced many countries
to close their borders and enforce a partial or full lock down
with devastating impact on the world economy [45, 46, 47].
There has been studies relating the effect of environment and air
pollution on COVID-19 and vice versa [48, 49, 49] with studies
regarding China [50], Kazakhstan [48] and [49] Brazil. In some
cases, COVID-19 lock-downs with reduced traffic showed to reduce air pollution while in others, it did not make significant impact due to meteorological conditions and factors such as industrial pollutants [51, 49]. Although machine learning has been
used for forecasting air-quality, there is scope in improving the
forecasts in using latest machine learning models, that feature
deep learning models such as recurrent neural networks. Given
this motivation, we focus on air-quality index of Delhi which
lately reached hazardous levels. We note that the air-quality
in Delhi has significantly improved post COVID-19 pandemic
[52], however this was due to lock-downs by the government
and the air-quality can deteriorate further when the restrictions
are eased. Hence it is important to develop robust forecasting
models, that are applicable even during lock-downs and eras of
lock-downs during the COVID-19 pandemic.
In this paper, use novel deep learning methods for long-term
air-quality prediction in selected parts of Delhi, India. Our
deep learning methods comprise of Long Short Term Memory
(LSTMs) networks, bidirectional-LSTMs and encoder-decoder
LSTMs. We use a multivariate time series approach that attempts to predict air quality for 10 prediction horizons covering
a total of 80 hours with 8 hours for each prediction horizon. We
also provide a long-term (one month ahead) forecast with uncertainty quantification given feedback of predicted values into
the model. We first show visualisation of the air quality indicators before and during coronavirus (COVID) restrictions in
Delhi. We investigate the impact of COVID-19 on air-quality
and the ability of the model to provide quality predictions before and during COVID-19. Our models feature data that considers major seasons, effect of COVID-19, and considers multivariate and univariate approach for predictions.
The rest of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2
presents a background and literature review of related work.
Section 3 presents the proposed methodology and Section 4
presents experiments and results. Section 5 provides a discussion and Section 6 concludes the paper with discussion of future
work.

2.1. COVID-19 and air pollution
There have been studies relating the effect of environment
and air pollution on COVID-19 and vice versa [48, 49, 49].
Zhu et al. [50] found that there was a significant relationship
between air pollution and COVID-19 infection in China. Kerimray et al. [48] presented an assessment on the impact of
COVID-19 in large cities in Kazakhstan and found that the temporal reduction in pollution may not be directly attributed to the
lockdown due to favorable meteorological variations during the
period, however the spatial effects of the lockdown on the pollution levels were clear. Moreover, other non-traffic based sources
such as coal based power plants substantially contributed to the
pollution level. Dantas et al. [49] presented a study on the impact of COVID-19 partial lockdown on the air quality of the
city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The authors reported that The
carbon-dioxide levels showed the most significant reductions
during the partial lockdown while nitrogen-oxide decreased in
a lower extent, due to industrial and diesel input. The air quality index (with PM-10 concentration) was only reduced during
the first partial lockout week. Bao and Zhang [53] reviewed 44
cities in China to find if COVID-19 lockdowns had an effect
on air pollution. The authors showed that the lockdowns of 44
cities reduced human movements by 69.85 %, and the reduction in the air quality index was mediated by human mobility.
Li et al. [54] presented a study on air quality changes during
the COVID-19 lockdown over the Yangtze River Delta region
in Northern China where the authors showed that the ozone did
not show any reduction. Moreover, even during the lockdown
it was evident that background and residual pollution are still
high, which includes sources mostly from the industry. Dutheil
and Naval [55] investigated COVID-19 as a factor influencing
air pollution for China. The authors argued that COVID-19
pandemic might paradoxically have decreased the total number
of deaths during the period by drastically decreasing the number of fatalities due to air pollution, apart from positive benefits
in reducing preventable non communicable diseases. Wang et
al. [51] showed that in case of China, severe air pollution events
were not avoided by reduced activities during COVID-19 outbreak due to adverse meteorological events. The authors highlight that large emissions reduction in transportation and slight
reduction in industrial would not help avoid severe air pollution
especially when meteorology is unfavorable.
There have been studies if there is another correlation with
rise in COVID-19 infections to the weather change. Tosepu et
al. [56] presented a study regarding the correlation between
weather and COVID-19 pandemic in Jakarta, Indonesia taking into account different temperature levels and percentage of
humidity, and amount of rainfall. The authors reported that
only the average temperature was significantly correlated with
COVID-19 pandemic. Ma et al. [57] presented a study on the
effects of temperature variation and humidity on the death of
COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. The authors collected the daily
death numbers of COVID-19 and meteorological parameters
and air pollutant data and used generalized additive model to

be important factors affecting the COVID-19 mortality.

to air pollution during the daily commute in a systematic review highlighted studies with schoolchildren’s exposure during
commutes that are linked with adverse cognitive outcomes and
severe wheeze in asthmatic children[67]. Furthermore, Ambient air pollution associated with reduction in lung functionality
and other respiratory conditions among children [68].
Apart from health, air pollution has taken a toll on various
other sectors, which includes agriculture. Industrial air pollution has a drastic effect in agricultural production as shown by
a study in China with lower marginal products and further alters the relationships of labour-capital and other factors [69].
Finally, air pollution has a drastic effect on development and
economy. A study on the relationship between air pollution and
stock returns further showed that industrial air pollution significantly reduces the technical efficiency of agricultural production [70].

2.2. Machine learning methods for forecasting air pollution
We review machine learning methods used for air quality
forecasting in the past decades. Machine learning methods
have achieved tremendous success in a variety of areas for air
quality forecasting [24, 25, 26, 27, 28]. Although neural networks have advantages over traditional statistical methods in air
quality forecasting, they have room for improvements [58] due
to challenges that include computational expense, sub-optimal
convergence, over-fitting, and noisy data. Moreover, the challenge is in configuration of the network topology and model
parameters which affects the prediction performance. Corani
[59] used models to predict hourly PM-10 concentrations on
the basis of data from the previous day with feedforward and
pruned neural networks. Jiang et al. [? ] explored multiple
models that feature physical and chemical model, regression
model, and multiple layer perceptron on the air pollutant prediction task, and their results show that statistical models are
competitive with the classical physical and chemical models.
Machine learning is an active field of research and every
now and then novel tools and techniques emerge for more refined modeling of a specific problem. Some recent works use
straightforward approaches like box models, Gaussian models
and linear statistical models, which are easy to implement and
allow for the rapid calculation of forecasts [60]. Fu et al. [61]
applied a rolling mechanism and gray model to improve traditional neural network models. Chang et al. [62] used aggregated LSTM networks and compared the results with support
vector regression, and gradient boosted tree regression. Karimian et al. [23] implemented three machine learning methods to
forecast air quality given by PM-2.5 concentrations over different time intervals; these include multiple additive regression
trees, deep feedforward neural network, and a hybrid model
based on LSTM networks, where the LSTM model was most
effective for forecasting and controlling air pollution. Xiao et al.
[63] parameterised non-intrusive reduced order model based on
proper orthogonal decomposition for model reduction of pollutant transport equations to provide rapid response urban air
pollution predictions and controls. Zhu et al. [64] focused on
refined modeling for predicting hourly air pollutant concentrations on the basis of historical meteorological and air pollution
data.

3. Methodology
3.1. Delhi Situation Report and Data
According to the United Nations 2016 report, Delhi had an
estimated population of 26 million in greater metro area which
is projected to rise to 36 million by 2030 and will remain second most populated city after Tokyo [71]. The current population density is also one of the worlds largest that will continue
to pose further challenges to air quality and health. According
to a study by Indian Ministry of Earth Sciences in 2018, it was
shown that number of vehicles increases by four times since
2000 which has been a major factor for air pollution in India
which includes PM2.5 and hazardous nitrogen-oxide [72]. In
the past five years, the air quality index of Delhi has been generally moderate (101–200) level between January to September. The air quality index then drastically deteriorates to very
poor (301–400), and further Severe (401–500) or Hazardous
(500+) levels during October to December due to various factors [73, 74]. The air pollution status in Delhi has undergone
many changes in terms of the levels of pollutants and the control
measures taken to reduce them. Sulian et al. [75] provides an
evidence-based insight into the status of air pollution in Delhi
and its effects on health and control measures instituted.
The meteorological conditions, such as regional and synoptic meteorology are significant in determining the air pollutant
concentrations[76, 77, 78, 79]. Lower wind speed (weak dispersion/ventilation) can result in higher concentrations of traffic
pollutants [80]. However, strong wind speed might form dust
storms and end up blowing the particles on the ground.[81].
Higher humidity levels are associated with higher aggregates
of air pollutants like PM2.5, carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen
dioxide (NO2) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) [82]. In addition, high
levels of humidity often indicate precipitation events which
result in heavy wet deposition leading to the lowering of air
pollutants[83]. The most important factors of attenuated visibility are the interactions of particle compositions and light [84?
]. Thus, low visibility can be considered as a strong indicator
of high PM2.5 concentrations. Many a time, the formation of
some significant air pollutants like ozone (O3) is reduced by

2.3. Effect of air-pollution
Data-driven machine learning methods present an opportunity to simultaneously assess the impact of multiple air pollutants on health outcomes. There is growing evidence that
early-life exposure to ambient air pollution affect neuro development in children [65]. A study that showed that air pollution is a potential risk factor for obesity with higher bodymass index in adults that warrants further investigation about
other health effects[66]. Assessing schoolchildren’s exposure

Therefore, these meteorological variables are importantly selected to predict air quality and hence we take them into consideration.
We chose four most polluted areas in Delhi and several surrounding districts known as the National Capital Region (NCR)
for our study. Bawana was the most-polluted area with an air
quality index of 497, followed by DTU-Delhi Technological
University (487), Anand Vihar (484) and Vivek Vihar (482) as
shown in Figure 3. There are 12 parameters that have been
considered for our study, the data is taken from the Central Pollution Control Board, India [87] for 3 years in 8 hour interval.
The dataset consists of concentration levels of different parameters of air-pollution from four different monitoring stations installed by the government agency in Delhi-NCR region. Tables
[1, 2, 3, 4] show the range of values for different parameters in
our dataset between 1 January,2019 and 10 December, 2020 for
different monitoring stations. We find the monitoring station
at Bawana records the highest range of values and mean for
PM2.5 concentration as compared to other monitoring stations.

Figure 1: Framework diagram for selected monitoring base stations and selected pollutants showing the data collection from base stations, pre-processing and
feeding of pre-processed data into the deep learning models for predicting PM2.5 values with uncertainty. We use three deep learning models that include, LSTM,
BD-LSTM and ED-LSTM for multivariate and univariate models as shown.

RNNs are simply two independent RNNs together in a structure
that allows the networks to have both backward and forward
information about the sequence at every time step.
The combination of bidirectional RNNs with LSTM model
gives us bidirectional LSTM model (BD-LSTM), which have
the ability to access long-range context in both input directions [95]. BD-LSTM are designed for specific input sequences
whose starting and ending are known beforehand. They take
both the future and past states of each element of a sequence
into consideration where one LSTM processes the information
from start to end of the sequence and the other from end to
start. Their combined outputs predict the corresponding labels
if available at each time step [30]. This approach differs from
unidirectional approach in a way where information from the
future and past LSTM model states combined; hence, it preserves information from both past and future at each time step.
BD-LSTM have been prominent in sequence processing problems such as phoneme classification [95], continuous speech
recognition [96], speech synthesis [97] and sentence classification [98].

3.2. LSTM network models
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a class of artificial
neural networks which gained a lot of popularity in recent years.
The Elman RNN [31, 88] is one of the earliest architectures and
considered a prominent example of simple recurrent networks
trained by back-propagation through-time (BPTT) algorithm
[32]. In the early days, there was much research for modeling dynamic systems using simple RNNs and it was shown that
RNNs perform better than feed-forward networks in knowledge
representation tasks [89, 90, 91].
Backpropagation through time (BPTT) [32] features error
backpropagation which uses the idea of training RNNs using
gradient descent in a way similar to feedforward neural networks. The major difference is that the error is back-propagated
for a deeper network architecture that features states defined by
time; however, BPTT experiences the problems of vanishing
and exploding gradients in case of learning tasks which involve
long-term dependencies or deep network architectures. [92].
Long Short Term Memory(LSTM) network [33] was developed
which was capable of overcoming the fundamental problems of
deep learning [30]. LSTM networks addressed the issue with
much better capabilities in remembering the long-term dependencies using memory cells and gates for temporal sequences.
The memory cells are trained in a supervised fashion using an
adaptation of the BPTT algorithm that considers the respective gates [33]. More recently, Adam optimiser which features
adaptive learning rate has been prominent in training LSTM
models via BPTT [93].

3.4. Encoder-Decoder LSTMs
A sequence to sequence model lies behind numerous systems
which we face on a daily basis [99], and such models aim to
map a fixed-length input with a fixed-length output, where the
length of the input and output may differ. In multi-step and multivariate analysis, both the input and output are variable with
potentially different lengths. This problem is analogous to machine translation between natural languages, where a sequence
of words in the input language is translated to a sequence of
words in the output language. Recently, it has been shown
how to effectively address sequence to sequence problem with
encoder-decoder LSTM networks (ED-LSTM).
ED-LSTM handles variable length inputs and outputs by first
encoding a given input sequence Xip = (x1 , x2 , ..xn ), one at a

3.3. Bi-directional LSTMs
One shortcoming of conventional RNNs is that they are only
able to make use of previous context in a sequence to predict
future states. Bidirectional RNNs [94] do this by processing the
data in both directions with two separate hidden layers, which
are then feed forwards to the same output layer. Bidirectional

framework diagram for our experimental setup. We pre-process
the dataset extracted from four different monitoring stations
in Delhi (Figure 3 with map adopted from website 2 ) for our
proposed deep learning framework as shown in Figure 1. After collecting the data, we fill the missing values of a particular feature by the median of its available neighboring values.
The missing values may be due to inconsistency in recording
the pollutant values at different monitoring stations. In order to train LSTM models, we transform the two-dimensional
(2D) dataset of features and temporal sequences given by timeinterval (eight hours) into a into a three-dimensional (3D) format [103] by a sliding window technique in which a window of
size N moves over the original 2D dataset of size (r,c); where
r represents the number of rows(features) and c represents the
number of columns in dataframe. This results in M windows final dataset with dimensions (M,N,r) which is fed into the models to give Nout multi-step ahead prediction values as shown
in Figure 2. We break the dataset into a feature set Xi =
(x1 , x2 , x3 ....xr−1 ), i = 1...N for multivariate model and Xi = (xr )
for univariate model and labels Y j = (y1 , y2 , ..., yNout ), j = 1...M
as multi-step ahead predictions. The label value consists of PM
2.5 value and other meteorological values constitutes the feature vector for multivariate model while for univariate model
past PM2.5 values constitute the feature vector .
Our framework for the respective LSTM models is as follows. We use N f = 11 features (different pollutant values other
than PM2.5 as shown in Table 1) for our multivariate model
where we consider N = 5 a window that captures the number
of time steps in the past. The window determines how much
the LSTM model will unfold in time and the number of features determines the number of input neurons in the respective
LSTM models. We define Nout = 10 as the number of output
neurons in the LSTM model which denotes the number of steps
ahead to predict PM2.5 concentration. We note that each step
ahead is denoted by 8 hour intervals and hence the respective
models would predict 80 hours ahead. Hence, we use 40 hours
(5 steps) of past information to predict 80 hours (10 steps) of
future trend of the time series. In the case of univariate model,
we only use PM2.5 as a feature to predict its future trend and
hence, the respective LSTM models will feature 1 input neuron

time using a latent vector representation for input of length n
and the output is a sequence Y = (y1 , y2 , ..ym ) of length m. In
the encoding stage, ED-LSTM creates a sequence of hidden
states for input sequence and then in decoding stage it defines
a distribution for output states given the input sequence. The
main goal of the model is to maximize the conditional probability P(Y|Xip ) of mapping input sequence to output sequence
while training. ED-LSTM have been previously used in a lot
of tasks, some of which include text simplification [100], automatic speech recognition [101] and grapheme to phoneme conversion [102].

partial lockdown periods, in this case we use 50 epoch of training with our best LSTM model. Second, we use a univariate
time-series approach for multi-step ahead prediction of PM2.5
values and test the performance using our best model. In this
case, we use 1000 epochs of training with our best LSTM
model. In all our experimental setup using different LSTM
models and FNN, we further split the test dataset into validation
dataset for tuning the model during trial experiments and test
our model on the remaining portion for evaluating the models,
we split the test dataset in the ratio 1:1 for for all our respective
experiments.
The prediction performance is measured by root mean
squared error (RMSE) as follows

and 10 output neurons.
4. Experiments and Results
In our experiments, we compare the performance of three
LSTM models as presented earlier for univariate and multivariate prediction models. We first analyse the impact of COVID19 lock-downs on the air quality and then evaluate the different
models for multi-step ahead prediction of air quality (PM2.5).
Our experiments consider different data setup that features data
before and after COVID-19 in order to evaluate the effect on air
quality and model accuracy.
4.1. Experiment setup
The visualisations and experiments are organised as follows.

• Provide analysis of concentration of PM2.5 for different
monitoring stations and for different time intervals including the COVID-19 lockdown;

RMS E =

(yi − ŷi )2
N i=1

where, yi and ŷi are the actual value and the predicted value,
respectively. N refers to the total length of the data. We report
the RMSE for different horizons and also the mean RMSE for
all prediction horizons.
We conduct 30 independent experimental runs with different
weight initialisation in the respective LSTM models and provide mean and standard deviation in all our results.

• Compare the performance of the three LSTM network
models using Adam optimizer;
• Create training data with different strategies, that includes
and exclude COVID-19 time-span and compare the performance of best LSTM model;
• Compare univariate and multivariate approach using the
best LSTM model;

4.2. Data visualisation

• Provide one month forecast using best LSTM model
with uncertainty quantification with multiple experimental runs.

We first provide data visualisation and analyse the effect of
COVID-19 on air pollution in Delhi while comparing with previous years. Figure 5 presents PM2.5 values of stations in
Anand Vihar, Bawana, Delhi Technical University and Vivek
Vihar from 1 January 2018 to 10 December 2020 that is used
as dataset for this study. We find some missing data in the initial months of 2018 for some stations therefore we consider the
data from 1 January 2019 to 10 December 2020 for building our
respective models and strategies. Table 6 presents a summary
of the visualisation in Figure 5 where the seasons are quantitatively highlighted. We observe higher values of PM2.5 value for
the months from October till February on a seasonal basis after which the value starts to descend starting from the month of
March. Although we find lower values of PM2.5 during MarchJune every year, we observe a significant decrease for months
of interest (March-June 2020), which belongs to the COVID-19
full lockdown period in India when compared to the respective
months in 2018 and 2019as shown in Table 6 and Figure 5.
We find a similar decrease of PM2.5 values for all the monitoring stations while Bawana records the highest values for 2019
and 2020 among other stations. The partial lockdown period
include the months after June, 2020 as highlighted in Figure 5.
Figure 4 shows Pearson’s correlation heatmaps for different
features in our dataset for different monitoring stations. Higher
positive values of Pearson’s correlation between two particular feature indicates a high positive dependence between them
while a higher negative value indicates a high negative dependence between them and the values closer to zero indicates

The technical details of our framework for the respective
LSTM models as follows. We considered different number of
hidden neurons and other hyper-parameters (such as learning
rate) in our trial experiments. We define the topology of different models in terms of input, hidden layers and output in Table
5. We use Adam optimizer [93] with batch size of 20 for 200
epochs and rectifier linear unit (ReLu) activation in the hidden
layers for the three LSTM models. We also compare our results
with FNN which uses Adam optimiser.
In the respective experiments, we compare the performance
of different models for different time steps by using the train
data from Jan 2019 to May 2020 (pre-COVID-19 lockdown)
and the test data from June 2020 to Dec 2020 (during and partial COVID-19 lockdown). We test our models by training without shuffling the time-series data window and also by shuffling
it. Shuffling the data here refers to randomly picking different
training data windows (regions) comprising of past time steps
and its corresponding output time steps. Hence, with shuffling,
the training data would feature peak and off-peak regions of
COVID-19 as different weeks can be featured in training data
rather than taking consecutive weeks.
Furthermore, we test the best model in two different ways,
first by training it on a seasonal data comprising of observations from February to September in 2019 which excludes the

different correlation heatmaps. We observe higher correlation
values of NOx with NO and NO2 also which is expected because they are nitrogenous pollutants and show higher positive

dependence. We also observe high positive correlation values
between PM2.5 and PM10 for all the monitoring stations which
also indicates a good amount of correlation.

confidence interval using 30 experimental runs. Note that lower
value of RMSE indicates better performance. We find that the
prediction RMSE in general increases across prediction horizons for all the models which is also natural as we use a specified window size as input to predict the multi-step ahead values
and the results deteriorate as the gap in the missing values increases with increasing prediction horizon. In Figure 6(b) and
Table 7, we find that the multivariate BD-LSTM performs the
best on train dataset generalizes well with test performance. We
find that ED-LSTM is the worst performer in this case with
highest RMSE on both train and test dataset in comparison to
other models. In Figure 6(a) and Table 7, we observe that multivariate BD-LSTM generally has the best performance which
significantly improved for step sizes 6-10 when compared to
other models.
Since all the monitoring stations belong to Delhi region, we
use the model which performs the best on dataset from Anand
Vihar to analyse the performance on the dataset from other stations namely, Bawana, DTU and Vivek Vihar. Taking into account the results for Anand Vihar, we consider BD-LSTM as
our best model, and further apply it other monitoring stations.
We also consider different strategies with BD-LSTM to train
and analyse the performance on dataset from different monitoring stations which includes shuffling the input window when
training BD-LSTM model (BD-LSTM*), univariate time-series

4.3. Results: Modelling and Forecasting
We report the train and test performance (RMSE) mean and
(±) 95% interval of the RMSE for different prediction horizons
for each model from 30 experimental runs. Table 6 shows the
mean and (±) 95% confidence interval for PM2.5 concentration for different monitoring stations for the months March to
June in the years 2018, 2019 and 2020. We selected this particular interval of months to show a comparison of PM2.5 concentration in consecutive years for these COVID-19 lockdown
months. We observe a significant decrease in PM2.5 concentration in 2020 for all monitoring stations as compared to 2019 as a
consequence of COVID-19 lockdown. In our first set of experiments, we compare the performance of different multivariate
LSTM models (LSTM, ED-LSTM and BD-LSTM) where all
the models are trained using Adam Optimizer using the dataset
collected from the monitoring station at Anand Vihar. We also
show results with canonical feedforward neural network (FNNAdam) with Adam optimiser. We also show results for case
of shuffling the training data (BD-LSTM*), univariate (UBDLSTM) and seasonal (SBD-LSTM) at Anand Vihar. Note that
all LSTM models are multivariate except for UBD-LSTM.
Figure 6(a) shows the prediction horizon RMSE for 10 step
ahead prediction, and Figure 6(b) shows the mean RMSE for
entire train and test datasets for Anand Vihar using different
LSTM models. We show bar plots with mean and (±) 95%

analysis using BD-LSTM model (UBD-LSTM) and training the
BD-LSTM model using seasonal data (SBD-LSTM).
In Figure 7(a) and Table 7 results for Anand Vihar, we find
that BD-LSTM performs better on train dataset in comparison
to BD-LSTM* with almost similar performance on test dataset
while UBD-LSTM has highest RMSE on both train and test
dataset with highest confidence interval(error) of prediction.
In Figure 7(b) and Table 8 results for Bawana, we find that
BD-LSTM performs the best on train dataset in comparison
to BD-LSTM* and UBD-LSTM while BD-LSTM* performs
the best on test dataset amongst them. We find a similar trend
as Anand Vihar for UBD-LSTM with highest RMSE on both
train and test dataset and highest confidence interval of prediction. In Figure 7(c) and Table 9 results for DTU, we find that
UBD-LSTM performs better than BD-LSTM and BD-LSTM*
on train dataset while BD-LSTM* performs the best on test
dataset among these three, we observe a similar trend for UBDLSTM with highest confidence of prediction on both train and
test dataset. In Figure 7(d) and Table 10 results for Vivek Vihar,
we find that BD-LSTM* performs the best on train dataset in
comparsion to BD-LSTM and UBD-LSTM, while BD-LSTM
performs the best on test dataset among them. UBD-LSTM has
the worst performance on both train and test dataset with largest
confidence interval for the predictions.
In the seasonal model for the monitoring stations (SBDLSTM), we find least RMSE for both train and test dataset with
better performance on test dataset for Anand Vihar, Bawana
and DTU. For Vivek Vihar, we find that SBD-LSTM performs
the best on train dataset but it does not generalise well on test
dataset. We next evaluate the performance of SBD-LSTM in
the same plot for other models (BD-LSTM, BD-LSTM*,UBDLSTM). We cannot make a direct comparison between SBDLSTM and other models in terms of prediction accuracy, since
SBD-LSTM uses a subset of initial data (February-September,
2019) with lower range of PM2.5 values for these months as
shown in Figure 5.
Figure 8 provides a long-term (one month ahead) forecast
(11th December 2020 to 9th January 2021) of PM2.5 concentration values for different monitoring stations using UBD-LSTM
model. The plots provide mean and (±) 95% confidence interval as uncertainty in predicted values for 30 experimental runs
for 8 hours interval for each day, covering a total of 720 hours
for the entire month. Figure 9 shows a comparison between actual and predicted values of PM2.5 concentration for September
2020 in terms of mean and (±) 95% confidence interval in predicted values for 30 experimental runs for different monitoring
stations using SBD-LSTM model.

5. Discussion
In the respective experiments, we evaluated the performance
of different models on the time-series problem and studied the
effect of COVID-19 lockdown on prediction performance of
different models for different seasons. We find that BD-LSTM
is our best performer in terms of both train and test performance
with better generalization when compared to other LSTM based
models for Anand Vihar. This could be due to the BD-LSTM

architecture which features both forward and backward information for a sequence at each time-step using two LSTM layers
[95]. We find that BD-LSTM performs the best for larger time
steps (6-10) with better generalization as compared to other
models which indicates that BD-LSTM captures better information for long-term ahead prediction. This could be due to
the combination of memory cells with two LSTM layers which
are able to capture salient features in a temporal sequence when
compared to canonical LSTM models. Although BD-LSTM
based models have been mainly used for different language
modelling, we find them promising for long-term time-series
prediction problems.

ate models which uses a set of features as input that helps with
additional information for predicting future steps. The seasonal
model (SBD-LSTM) performs slightly better on test dataset for
Anand Vihar, Bawana and DTU along with good generalization performance which indicates that the model is robust to the
effects of COVID-19 lockdown period. It is important to evaluate the effect on performance of different models due to seasonal decrease of PM2.5 values during COVID-19 lockdown
period when compared to previous years. We find that different
LSTM models with different training strategies are quite robust
in modeling the effects of COVOD-19 lockdown for both during and partial lockdown periods.

In the respective experiments, we also found that BD-LSTM
and BD-LSTM* perform well in predicting future PM2.5 values for different monitoring stations which indicates that they
are not affected much due to COVID-19 lockdown phase.
UBD-LSTM has the highest RMSE and confidence interval for
test datasets which indicates that it is not robust. The poor performance which could be due to the fact that UBD-LSTM uses
only one features to predict future steps in contrast to multivari-

Recent focus has been on studying effects of the lock downs
imposed in different cities of India on the spatial patterns of air
quality both during pre-lockdown and during-lockdown phases.
The results have demonstrated a direct implication towards the
decrease in the concentration of selected pollutants such as
PM2.5 and PM10, with maximum decrease(more than 50%)
in comparison to the pre-lockdown phase [104]. There has
also been a significant decrease in the concentration of Nitro12

gen Dioxide(NO2) which has been a major pollutant in reputed
cities of India such as Delhi and Mumbai [105]. There is a
positive correlation between PM2.5 concentration and COVID19 for countries such as India and Pakistan [106]. Apart from
the major air pollutants, there has been a significant decrease
in aerosol optical depth (AOD) and lightning activities in many
urban and mining regions of India [107, 108].
There is a large effort by the Indian government to move towards clean energy with a massive investment in solar and wind
energy which can have benefits [109, 110]. Moreover, India
also has plans to go fully electric in the transportation sector by
2030 [111]. Currently, India has began manufacturing electric
vehicles with plans to have fully electric rail network by 2024
[112]. Renewable energy is expected to rise from 27 % of total
energy demand in 2014 to around 43 % by 2040 [113]. In many
developing countries, it is clear that an increase of population
density increases the air pollution; however, this can change
with type of energy used. In a recent study, in the case of China,
it has been shown that the increase in population density will
reduces air pollution which has been due to clean energy and
public transportation [114]. A study on the effects of meteorological conditions and air pollution on COVID-19 transmission
from 219 Chinese cities found that air pollution indicators were
positively correlated with new confirmed cases and increase in
cases were linked with air-quality index [115]. Such study in
case of India would be needed and prediction of air-quality indicators could help in preventative measures.
In future work, Bayesian deep learning methods can be
used to provide robust uncertainty quantification in predictions
which can extend Bayesian neural networks used for time series
prediction [116]. Other learning strategies such as multi-task
and transfer learning in conjunction with Bayesian inference
can be used to develop improved models [117, 118] which can
take into account existing deep learning models for COVID-19
infections in India [119]. Moreover, we envision the application
of the proposed framework in other parts of India and rest of the
world which has decline in air quality. A web-based framework
can be implemented by the respective authorities that can be
used to provide proper weekly and monthly planning, which
could involve the way traffic is managed for different seasons.
The methodology can also be extended for air quality prediction

in relation to forest fires around the world.
6. Conclusion and Future Work
In this paper, we applied deep learning via different LSTM
models for univariate and multivariate modelling for short-term
and long term air quality prediction taking into account the four
base-stations from Delhi, India. Although we selected a subset
of the base stations, the methodology can be applied to rest of
the base stations in Delhi or in other parts of the world. Our results show that multivariate bi-directional LSTM model shows
best performance, and rest of the LSTM models have certain
strengths and limitations which need to be evaluated prior to
developing a system that provides rigours uncertainty quantification in predictions. We also found that COVID-19 had a
significant effect on the air quality during full lockdown implemented for few months and afterwards, there was unprecedented growth of poor air quality which has a seasonal effect as
compared to previous years. We provide open source software
framework and open data which can be used for further verification and also application for studying or developing prediction
models in other places.
7. Software and Data
We provide Python based open source implementation along
with the data for different experiments and design of respective
method for further research 3 .
