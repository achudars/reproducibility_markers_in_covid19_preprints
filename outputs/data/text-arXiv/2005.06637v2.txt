Abstract—The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and
economic crisis due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Countries across
the world are using digital technologies to fight this global
crisis, which, in one way or another, strongly relies on the
availability of wireless communication systems. Therefore, this
paper aims to present the role of wireless communications
in the COVID-19 pandemic from different perspectives. First,
we show how wireless communication technologies are helping
to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus
spread, enabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual
education and conferencing. Also, we reveal the importance of
digital inclusiveness in the pandemic and possible solutions to
connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss the challenges faced
by using wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and
misinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless
technologies in the survival of the global economy, such as
automation of industries and supply chain, e-commerce, and
supporting occupations that are at risk. Finally, we reveal that
how the technologies developed during the pandemic can be
helpful in the post-pandemic era.

I. I NTRODUCTION
History repeats itself, an infectious disease (COVID-19),
once again attacking the human race. This time it is a
respiratory virus that originated from the city of Wuhan,
China, in December 2019 [1]. COVID-19 affected almost all
the countries in the World, significantly disrupting the noble
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations
(UN) [2]. Therefore the World Health Organization (WHO)
declared it a global pandemic in March 2020. COVID-19 has
made a lot of panic around the globe where the fights over the
toilet papers look ugly enough; hopefully, we do not witness
fighting for food during this pandemic.
Since COVID-19 is a global issue, researchers around the
world from different fields, such as biomedical, virology, data
analytics, and artificial intelligence, contributed to combating
this pandemic. In this context, more than 24 thousand research
articles appeared online on COVID-19 in less than four months
[3]. Moreover, in this global crisis, worldwide activities and
businesses are heavily dependent on digital technologies [4],

[5]. During this global emergency, applications of the digital technologies are numerous, including tactile robotics to
help the medical doctors and nurses at hospitals, drones to
monitor the crowds, artificial intelligence and deep learning
for understanding the health-care trends, Internet of Things
(IoT) for supply chain automation, and virtual learning to
continue the education. All of these crucial applications and
many more in this global pandemic rely on reliable and highspeed communication networks, putting tremendous pressure
on these networks. In this context, the international telecommunication union (ITU) conducted an emergency meeting
of the broadband commission for sustainable development
that directed the governments, industries, and civil society to
improve the capacity of communication networks at critical
points, such as hospitals and transportation hubs [6]. Not
only that, but they also emphasized on the importance of
communication technologies in disseminating timely critical
information, supporting e-learning for more than 1.5 billion
students, training workers by digital means to improve productivity, and promoting e-businesses.
With all this support of communication technology when
we need it the most, it is also fighting with the on-going
conspiracies of linking the fifth-generation (5G) networks with
the spreading of COVID-19 [7]. Based on this misinformation,
people around the globe attacked and burnt the 5G towers [8].
To limit this false theory, researchers from the wireless communications community responded through various channels
by showing the importance of 5G in the pandemic crisis and
negating the health concerns over 5G operating frequencies
[9]–[11].
Now that we agree on the significance of communication
technologies in combating the COVID-19 pandemic let’s
look at ways that they are currently used and can further
be improved. In this article, first, we show how the wireless communication technologies are assisting in fighting
this pandemic, regarding monitoring of the crowd, contact
tracing, supporting the medical doctors and nurses, enabling
telemedicine, backing virtual learning, and providing resilient
connectivity. We also show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the pandemic and possible solutions to connect the
unconnected. Next, we discuss major challenges that emerge
from the extensive use of wireless technologies, including
privacy, security, and misinformation. Then, we uncover the
decisive role of wireless communication technologies in saving
the global economy downfall due to COVID-19, including
automation of the industries and supply chain, assisting ecommerce, and supporting the occupations that are at most

risk. Finally, we discuss extrapolating these technologies in
the post-pandemic situation. In Fig. 1, we summarize the role
of wireless communications in the COVID-19 pandemic.
II. F IGHTING THE PANDEMIC
In the presence of this global pandemic, it is the top priority
to prevent the spread of disease. Various wireless communication and positioning technologies have a significant impact on
critical roles such as healthcare, education, and economy. In
this section, we cover these technologies from various aspects,
including COVID-19 spread monitoring, healthcare automation, telemedicine, virtual learning, and digital inclusiveness,
which are the biggest challenges at the moment in fighting
this pandemic.
A. Monitoring the Spread
According to WHO, limiting mass gatherings is the best way
to reduce the spread of COVID-19. Besides mass gathering,
social distancing is also crucial to minimize the spread of the
virus. Both outdoor and indoor monitoring is essential to limit
the transmission of the virus. In the following, we separately
discuss various technologies that can achieve both outdoor and
indoor tracking of the spread.
Outdoor Monitoring: Various wireless communication
and positioning technologies, such as drones, cellular positioning systems, and global positioning system (GPS), can be
used to monitor the transmission of the virus in the outdoor

environment. For instance, a network of drones can be of great
benefit in monitoring crowds and maintain social distancing
in metropolitan areas (see Fig. 2) [12]. Various countries
introduced "pandemic drones" to enforce social distancing.
Not only that, but these pandemic drones can also monitor
temperature, flu, sneezing, and coughing in public places
[13]–[15]. Once the drones collect the critical information, it
needs to be communicated to the authorities in real-time for
taking timely actions. Pandemic drones with 5G connectivity
can significantly help in such a situation due to its high
transmission speed and low latency. Satellite communications
is another major technology that is also of great benefit
in monitoring, modeling, and responding to the COVID-19
spread. The outbreaks of COVID-19 usually occur in a cluster
in specific regions and then continue to spread. As such, the
spread can be modeled using high-quality geospatial data.
Also, the satellite imagery can identify the population that
is at most risk and can track the health and testing facilities
[16].
Another major issue in fighting this pandemic is contact
tracing of the infected patients. In this context, Google and
Facebook initiated a joint venture by sharing GPS-based
mobility data of the users to the researchers [17]. Also, Google
and Apple are collaborating to build a contact tracing system
that uses Bluetooth signals to sense the nearby smartphones
and alert the users if they had encountered a possible COVID19 patient. Such geospatial data can be quite helpful for public

health researchers to understand the spreading of the virus
[18]. For instance, the researchers from National Tsing Hua
University used Facebook’s data to show that limiting human
mobility certainly reduces the transmission of the virus [19].
With a slightly different approach, Kinsa Health distributed
more than a million smart thermometers in the US to collect
the temperature and geospatial information of the households
remotely and predict the spread of the virus [20]. The data
from these intelligent thermometers can identify the clusters
of patients with fever where a sudden spike can detect the
presence of COVID-19. This way, an area of possible infected
patients can be narrowed down, limiting the spread of the
virus. Analogously, researchers at John Hopkins University
launched a mobile application where the user can add his/her
body temperature and other symptoms that can be used by the
government officials and health experts to take timely actions
and predict future outbreaks [21].

environments. Various indoor positioning technologies such
as radio frequency identification (RFID), Wi-Fi, visible light,
Zigbee, and Bluetooth can be promising solutions for monitoring the quarantined people and maintaining a safe working distance in indoor environments [22]. One new solution
recently developed for this cause is Proximity Trace, which
is a sensing-and-communication technology for workforce
distance monitoring while continuing essential businesses [23].
In Proximity Trace, a tag is attached to the worker hat or
worn on a lanyard that transmits real-time alerts when the
workers are in close contact (see Fig. 3). There is a central
gateway that collects all the workers’ interaction information.
This technology provides both passive and active solutions. In
the passive approach, the interaction of a worker is tracked,
in case, tested positive for the virus. In an active method, the
workers are informed using sound or visuals to maintain the
social distance.
Additionally, indoor localization and tracking methods that
can take the sensing measurements from the users in proximity
and create a network graph can be quite beneficial to maintain
the safe working distance and perform contact tracing. For
example, multidimensional scaling-based data visualization
tools can be used to take proximity information as an input
and create a network graph [24]–[26]. These indoor monitoring
solutions can help the workforce for industries eager to start
regular operations while controlling the spread of COVID-19.
B. Healthcare Automation

Indoor Monitoring: In the case of outdoor working
environments, outdoor positioning technologies can maintain
social distancing and safe working distance for the critical
workforce. However, in indoor environments, it may be more
challenging due to the unavailability of GPS signals. Hence,
novel solutions are needed to guarantee the monitoring of quarantined people and maintain safe working distance in indoor

The outbreak of COVID-19 is proving to be a catalyst
for 5G innovation, especially in healthcare automation. 5Genabled medical robots can deliver drugs, check the temperature of patients, and disinfect rooms in the hospitals,
reducing the exposure of medical personnel to the virus. These
robots can cover the shortage of personal protective equipment
required for doctors and nurses. For example, Ava Robotics’
introduced iRobot for hospitals that help the doctors that
are in quarantine at home to stay in the emergency rooms
(virtually) without the risk of getting the virus [27]. Not only
this but also the hospitals can continuously collect the patient
information using these connected robots and share it with the

4

remote center that can significantly improve the efficiency of
healthcare systems. The exchange of information from these
robots and their navigation requires reliable and low latency
communication that can be provided by 5G technologies.
China has witnessed the use of 5G-enabled healthcare automation by implementing a 5G+ remote consultation system
across its various hospitals [28]. In this system, the medical
staff at a hospital can take consultation from the expert’s miles
away through remote video connections. Fig. 4 illustrates an
example of such a connected healthcare system.
C. Virtual Education and Conferencing
The COVID-19 pandemic is reshaping almost every aspect
of our world, including “Education”. Across the world, the
schools have been closed for months, and it has forced the
schools to take the classes online as social distancing measures
continue. Online learning is the only option at the moment
to continue education; however, online learning with cutting
edge technologies can be a much better option compared
to traditional offline classrooms. The essential requirements
for e-learning include a good internet connection and access
to a digital device; however, not all students and teachers
have digital devices and high-speed connections, creating a
digital divide problem. Moreover, a large portion of the global
population has either limited or no internet access at all.
To cope with this issue, governments around the globe need
to distribute digital devices to low-income households and
provide internet access [29]. Regarding the connectivity issue,
we discuss various solutions in section II-D that can bring the
internet to remote areas.
Besides coverage of wireless networks, speed of the connection is of paramount importance in efficient e-learning; this
is where 5G can play a significant role. 5G can even enable
seamless augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) [30],
where students can take virtual classrooms (see Fig. 5). In
addition to virtual education, conferences and meeting across
the world are becoming online. Again the videoconferencing
requires a reliable and high-speed internet connection [31].
Moreover, online conferences/meetings can be more enjoyable
with the aid of VR. One such example is the recent conference
of IEEE on virtual reality and 3D user interfaces [32]. Another
recent example is the online virtual fabrication lab to help
students training on the fabrication processes of semiconductor
devices [33]. In summary, 5G technology can achieve these
AR and VR solutions due to its extremely-low-latency, high
bandwidth, and high reliability.
D. Connectivity Matters the Most
The role of wireless communication technologies is not
limited in containing the spread of virus and health automation; it is also helping people around the globe to be
connected, making the social distancing a little less lonely.
During the pandemic, connectivity matters more than ever
because it enables the workforce to work remotely, students
to continue their education, and promote e-business to deliver
the basic needs [34]. This pandemic is validating the need and
importance of 5G as the future of connectivity. 5G will enable

telecommuting and virtual presence in a completely different
way, integrate remote education as a part of everyday life,
and allow remote healthcare and diagnostics [35]. Moreover,
the rapid change is user demands during this pandemic require the mobile network operators (MNOs) to switch from
a “competitive” mode to a “collaborative” mode, providing
the required peak capacity in certain areas. Also, the MNOs
can collaborate closely with the governments to access any
unallocated spectrum in the short-term to satisfy the increasing
traffic demands.
Nevertheless, as mentioned earlier, it is the time to invest
more in the digital inclusiveness solutions providing connectivity to the unconnected. This is one of the expectations from
6G technologies, providing low-cost connectivity solutions for
rural and underprivileged areas [36]–[38]. In the following, we
briefly discuss these 6G solutions:
Tethered Drones and Balloons: The new trend in wireless communications is enabling connectivity solutions from
the sky. Tethered drones/balloons, also known as flying base
stations, is one of these solutions that can provide connectivity
in suburban and rural areas [39]. The drone/balloon is attached
by a cable to ground, where the cable/tether maintains the
drone/balloon position and also provides power to the on-board
payload [40]. This way, the drone/balloon can stay for a longer
time in the air, reducing the overall maintenance cost and
providing uninterrupted connectivity [41]. The drones/balloonbased solutions can either provide direct access to the user or
work as a backhaul network for the terrestrial networks.
High Altitude Platforms (HAPs): The HAPs can provide connectivity to large rural areas due to its high altitude
compared to the tethered drones/balloons. HAPs consists of
balloons and drones positioned in the stratosphere at around
20 km. Recently, Google and Facebook invested in HAPs
based solutions to bring internet to the remote areas of the

5

underserved communities.

world. One of the well-known projects on HAPs is Google’s
Loon (balloons), expanding the coverage of cellular networks
for rural and underserved areas [42]. Another big project was
the Facebook Aquila project that consisted of solar-powered
drones in the stratosphere, providing internet to the remote
regions [44]. However, in 2018, this project was stopped
by Facebook since it required aerospace industry expertise.
Hence, Facebook collaborated with Airbus by using its solarpowered drone (Zephyr) to provide internet access to the rural
areas [43]. Both these projects from Google and Facebook on
HAPs can be promising solutions to connect the unconnected.
Emerging Satellite Networks: In the space context,
several industrial partners are joining the race to provide
broadband internet access around the globe via thousands of
satellites in low Earth orbit (LEO) [45]. AmazonâĂŹs Project
Kuiper [46], for example, is planning to deploy 3,236 LEO
satellites at an altitude between 590 and 630 km, Starlink
[47] supported by SpaceX will install 12,000 LEO satellites,
and OneWeb [48] and Telesat [49] will place up to 900
satellites within the next few months. Such a large number of
satellites has allowed mass production of components, thereby
resulting in a significant reduction in satellite manufacturing
costs. Finally, Astranis [50] and Gapsat [51] are making efforts
towards the massive deployment of mini-GEO satellites to
improve satellite internet capacity worldwide.
Besides enabling or improving the connectivity in rural
areas, there is a huge demand for broadband internet in urban
and suburban regions. In general, buried underground fiberoptic cables provide broadband internet; however, it may not
be a viable solution in a dense urban environment. Therefore,
Terragraph, which is a Facebook technology, introduced an
integrated backhaul access solution for the urban environment
by taking the idea of routing in their fiber backbone and
applying it into wireless networks [52]. Facebook is testing
this technology worldwide, where it claims an average internet
speed of 500 Mbps. One major challenge with the Terragraph

technology is that it requires a strict line of sight conditions
because it is operating at 60-GHz band.
E. Challenges
We cannot ignore the positive impact of wireless communication technologies in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic.
However, it faces various challenges, such as privacy, security,
and misinformation. In the following, we discuss each of these
issues separately.
Privacy: Although the contact tracking technologies can
be quite helpful in curbing the spread of the virus, they indeed
invade the privacy of the people [54]. The location information
of users is accessed and monitored by these applications that
can be used by governments as a surveillance tool. Worldwide
human rights activists warn that the use of these applications in
the pandemic may become a standard surveillance tool in the
future. Governments need to answer a few questions without
breaching the privacy of the users before implementing these
applications. For example, Do the user know that his/her
information is collected, and once the pandemic is over, the
user can remove the data? How long will the governments
retain the data collected for the COVID-19 pandemic? Who
will be able to access the user data and what are the rules to
share the data. Analogously, the use of drones for monitoring
social distancing or looking for sick people in public places
will cause privacy issues. The aerial surveillance raises serious
concerns regarding the right to privacy and freedom [55].
Security: The unprecedented use of fixed and mobile
broadband connections in the COVID-19 pandemic is causing
a severe cybersecurity issue. According to the report of Akamai [56], the entire global internet traffic has increased by
30% in March 2020, which is ten times more than average.
This record-breaking use of the internet creates vulnerability
with the spike in malicious attacks, such as phishing emails,
inserting malware to COVID-19 related resources, and even
selling fake cures for COVID-19 [57]. Also, many enterprise

employees work remotely from home, and it is challenging to
provide authentication solutions for all users. As the businesses
will become mainly online and follow e-commerce, more
cyberattacks are expected [58]. Also, with the automation of
industries where the devices are more connected than ever can
initiate various vulnerabilities for cybercriminals. Perhaps, the
new digital technologies that are evolving at a rapid rate during
the pandemic can be classified as a high cybersecurity risk.
Is 5G Really Harmful? Combating the Misinformation: The COVID-19 pandemic has breathed new life into
anti-5G conspiracy theories. Recently a British conspiracy theorist David Icke claimed in an interview, linking the COVID19 outbreak and 5G technology. He argued that Wuhan was the
first Chinese city to roll-out 5G, just before the virus outbreak.
However, it is not true; Wuhan was among several Chinese
cities, including Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou, to get
5G. Also, the WHO found no evidence that 5G adversely
affects health [11]. The fear of 5G has prompted acts of
violence in various countries where the cell towers have
been attacked and set on fire [8]. These conspiracy theories
have to be strongly invalidated (or adjust regulations) and
need to be publicized in the media so that communication
technology services keep progressing. In this regard, the wireless communication technologies itself is combating with the
misinformation. Researchers around the globe working with
wireless communication technologies provided clarifications to
fight this misinformation. For example, Peter Popovski, who is
a professor of wireless communications at Aalborg University
presented several points to clarify this misconception, such as
fear of new technology, most of the wireless devices do not
have 5G at the moment, and no evidence of 5G adversely
affects on health [10]. To the best of our knowledge, also
concluded by WHO, radiations of 5G and other communication technologies are not harmful to human health. Indeed,
wireless communication technologies are vital in keeping the
societies functioning when there is a massive lockdown due
to COVID-19.

A. Impact of COVID-19 on the Global Economy
Around the world, economies are crumbling due to the
COVID-19 pandemic, where the price of every commodity has
fallen significantly [59]. The hard calculation for governments
is trading life of the people who will die of the COVID-19
versus economic damage [60]. Over the past three months,
the world’s biggest stock markets have turned red because the
investors have to re-calculate the future for the economy. In
the financial crisis (2007-08), there was a steady downfall of
the economy. However, in the pandemic situation, investors
are not pricing in due to strict lock-downs, leading to the
crash of the global economy with low gross domestic product
(GDP) growth this year (see Fig. 7). This all started when the
Chinese government shut down the manufacturing industry to
prevent the spread of the virus. Since China makes one-third
of the World products, the shut down caused a delay in the
production leading to the disruption in supply chain throughout
the world [61]. For example, the car industry depends on
various tools and machinery to manufacture their cars, where
each one of these necessities experiences 1-3 months delay
due to the shut down of the manufacturing sector in China.
This means that car companies will not be able to launch
new vehicles on time, missing out billions of dollars of sale.
The same is true for other industries where the drop in sale
can lead to the company’s layoff and bankruptcies. One such
example is the collapse of OneWeb, a leading project on small
satellites with 74 satellites already in orbits to provide internet
from space [62].

III. S URVIVAL OF THE E CONOMY
The actions taken across the globe to control the spread
of COVID-19 are extraordinary at the cost of unprecedented
economic loss. There is great confusion going on among
the policymakers about saving more lives or the economy.
In this section, we cover the impact of COVID-19 on the
global economy and show the role of wireless communication
technologies in rescuing the economy.

Fig. 7: Global GDP downfall in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The industry needs to develop a strategic response by
moving towards a low-touch or touch-less economy to fight
this global issue and prepare for continuous disruptions. A
matrix such as the COVID-19 strategy matrix can be followed
to respond in such a crisis [53]. For example, industries, such

7

as e-commerce, can still generate good revenue in the short run
and need only to keep up with the supply; however, sectors like
tourism are very uncertain and need to look at a new start or
abandoning in the long run. The COVID-19 strategy matrix
is given in Table 1, which relates the impact and response
for different industries. Moreover, it is the right time for
the stakeholders to invest more in research and development
(R&D) because most of the innovative companies in the global
financial crisis (2007-08) spent more on R&D, which has paid
off in profit and growth [53]. Specifically, R&D in digital
technologies can pave the way for low-touch economy by
developing novel smart solutions [63]. Not only that, but these
technologies can also monitor the state of the economy. For
example, the researchers at WeBank have shown from the
analysis of geospatial data that China’s economy is recovering.
They used visible and infrared images from the satellites to
look for the activities in hot spots. Analogously, Ursa space
systems is using images from their synthetic aperture radar
satellites and use data analytics to see the impact of COVID19 on global oil inventories [64]. With strict lockdowns, many
companies are taking an interest in satellite imagery to collect
information concerning operational activities in the concerned
area.
B. Automation of Industries and Supply Chain
As mentioned earlier, one primary reason for the crumbling
of global economies is the shutting down of industries and
the break of the supply chain. However, recent advances in
IoT can contribute to streamline the supply chain and reduce
the impact of COVID-19 pandemic. Also, IoT technology can
play a significant role in the automation of industries that can
further improve the supply chain. For instance, the Industrial
Internet of Things (IIoT) can enable smart and adaptable

manufacturing utilizing smart sensors and reliable connectivity
for interconnecting and digitalizing of the traditional factories
[65]. This can allow self-organizing, remote monitoring, and
collaborative control for the conventional industries (see Fig.
8). The primary reason for establishing IIoT is that intelligent
machines can efficiently collect, communicate, and act in a
real-time industrial environment. To achieve this, IIoT requires
stable and uninterrupted massive-and-ubiquitous high-speed
connectivity, low-latency below one millisecond, and ultrareliability to support real-time monitoring and provide automation. Consequently, all these metrics are the characteristics
of 5G technology, and therefore the concept of IIoT can
be realized by using 5G [66]. Moreover, 5G connectivity
can potentially transform the supply chain by helping the
companies to precisely measure consumer demands and react
in real-time with changing situations.
C. E-Commerce
Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, e-commerce is emerging
as a critical pillar in preserving jobs. For example, restaurants
that are closed due to lockdowns can survive by starting
online delivery services. Indeed, in some cases, e-commerce is
creating new opportunities, e.g., Amazon recently announced
to hire more 175,000 people to fulfill the customers’ delivery
demand and assist existing staff [68]. Moreover, the combination of 5G and other technologies such as IoT, AI, blockchain,
and AR/VR will transform the e-commerce industry [69].
For instance, with 5G connectivity, IoT will enable the fast
transfer of data to improve the consumer experience, track
real-time inventory, and effectively manage orders. Likewise,
AR/VR with 5G connectivity can allow the customers to
place a real product virtually. With 5G, e-commerce can
offer a unique high-resolution viewing experience for the

8

enterprises, ultimately elevating their capacity. A recent report
of Adobe Digital claims that 5G will foster the revenue of
e-commerce by $12billion by the year 2021 [70], and it may
further increase since most enterprises are moving towards ecommerce.

D. Supporting the Occupations at Risk
The current practice of remote working and keeping social
distancing is luxury for some occupations, while people employed in sectors that provide essential services do not have
this luxury. Hence, people who need to continue working
as normal have a high risk of being exposed to the virus.
Based on the attributes of the job, such as contacting others,
close physical proximity, and exposure to the diseases, the US
department of labor has defined an occupational risk score (see
Fig. 9) [67]. According to this risk score, dental hygienists,
bus drivers, and economists are at high, medium, and low
risks, respectively. Digital technologies can play a significant
role here in providing low-touch or touchless solutions for the
occupations that are at medium/high risks. For example, the
labor working in a supermarket can be equipped with smart
wearable sensors to maintain minimum distances, avoiding the
possible contamination of the virus. Similarly, telemedicine
with the AR/VR capabilities can be used by dental hygienists
for safe operations. This way, many occupations that are at
risk can be protected, reducing unemployment.

E. Flattening the Curve

Across the globe, the terminology of âĂIJflatten the
curveâĂİ is the focus of governments to reduce the spread of
the virus, not taking into account the economic consequences.
However, every economic recession also plays a part in costing
lives. For instance, unemployment is already rising; in the
past few weeks in the US only, millions of people lost their
jobs. Unemployment can further increase the death rate in a
society giving rise to heart diseases. Besides unemployment,
our modern societies require a sustainable health system,
healthy nutrition, and clean water that may not be available
during a deep recession. Hence, the long-term shutdowns can
indeed flatten the curve but also would cause lives. Also, in
low-income countries where the labor community survive on
daily income, lockdowns can cause starving. According to
the recent statement of the UN World Food Program (WFP),
more prolonged shutdowns can lead to a hunger pandemic
[71]. Therefore, epidemiological modeling of the COVID-19
spread and its socioeconomic impact is essential, where it
follows an exponential growth in most countries around the
world. Wireless communication technologies, as discussed in
the previous sections, can undoubtedly help in flattening the
curve that can further result in the opening of businesses.
Also, this will guide the policymakers to take actions regarding
socioeconomic and health considerations.

IV. T HE N EW N ORMAL
The post-pandemic era or the new normal is going to be very
different, bringing a new technological revolution. Although
the digital technologies altogether could not end the pandemic
yet, it is diving deeper to discover its true potential in different
sectors. In this section, we cover such wireless communication
technologies that are developed during this pandemic and can
be used in the post-pandemic era.
A. The Rise of Telehealth
COVID-19 is the game-changer for the healthcare industry.
According to Statista, the forecasted revenue of the global
telehealth sector is around $332.7 billion by 2025 [72], where
it cannot be achieved without efficient and reliable wireless
connectivity. The role of IoT, robotics, and AR/VR with highspeed connectivity will truly revolutionalize the healthcare industry. It will not only enable the medical specialists to analyze
the patients’ data but also contribute to remote operations [73].
Moreover, it will also reduce the travel expenses since the best
doctors from anywhere in the world can be accessed online.
The telehealth can also keep those clinicians productive who
are unable to offer the patients an in-person visit.
B. More Connected World
The COVID-19 pandemic is showing us the true potential
of connectivity for people and interconnected technologies.
Across the globe, the use of audio/video applications, such as
Google Hangout, Zoom, and Skype, are keeping the people
connected and allows e-learning/teleconferencing. The dependency on these applications in the COVID-19 can lead to more
remote working and a blended education system in the future.
Moreover, the blend of 5G and AR/VR can lead to virtual
labs, classrooms, and conferencing.
Similarly, the solutions developed to provide connectivity to
the rural areas during this pandemic can lead to overcoming
the digital divide problem in the long run.
C. Improved Cybersecurity
Besides threatening the healthcare systems and economy,
the COVID-19 pandemic is causing serious cybersecurity
issues. This is mainly due to more dependency on the internet
in daily life while working remotely in global lockdowns.
This dependency creates vulnerability with the spike in malicious attacks, such as phishing emails, inserting malware
to COVID-19 related resources, and even selling fake cures
for COVID-19 [57]. Moreover, as the businesses will become
mainly online and follow e-commerce, more cyberattacks are
expected [58]. Also, with the automation of industries where
the devices are more connected than ever can initiate various
vulnerabilities for cybercriminals. Amidst "flatten the curve"
for the spread of the virus, increase in the cybersecurity threats
should also be mitigated. With this in mind, the awareness
and tools developed during the pandemic for cybersecurity
can help online businesses become more robust in the new
normal.

D. The IoT Revolution
The IoT networks are seeing astonishing growth in the
COVID-19 era, which will result in the automation of many
sectors, including health, manufacturing, consumer electronics,
and transportation. The role of IoT will further intensify with
the rollout of 5G, leading to the applications beyond our
imagination from smart cities and smart oceans to smart space
[74]. This fast-growing research in the IoT field will also help
the human race to be more prepared for natural calamities and
pandemics in the future.
V. C ONCLUSION
Wireless communication technologies are playing a significant role in winning the fight against the age of disruption
and looking forward to the new normal. In this paper, we
discussed different global challenges that originated due to
the COVID-19 pandemic, and then we uncovered the fact
that wireless communication technologies are necessary to
fight these challenges, such as monitoring the spread of the
virus, enabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual
education and conferencing. Moreover, we have also discussed
the challenges faced by these technologies, such as privacy,
security, and misinformation. Additionally, we also reveal
that wireless communication technologies are assisting in the
survival of the global economy by helping in different sectors,
such as industries, supply chains, and e-commerce. Finally, we
highlight a few of the use cases that will revolutionize during
this pandemic, leading to a technological transformation in the
future.
