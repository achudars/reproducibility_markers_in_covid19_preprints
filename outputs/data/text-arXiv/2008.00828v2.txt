Abstract We present a compartmental mathematical model with demography for
the spread of the COVID-19 disease, considering also asymptomatic infectious
individuals. We compute the basic reproductive ratio of the model and study the
local and global stability for it. We solve the model numerically based on the case
of Italy. We propose a vaccination model and we derive threshold conditions for
preventing infection spread in the case of imperfect vaccines.

appeared in Wuhan, China, and rapidly spread across the globe. In January 2020 the
human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed, during the COVID19 pandemic, and SARS-CoV-2 was designated a Public Health Emergency of
International Concern by the WHO, and in March 2020 the WHO declared it a
pandemic. Since December 31, 2019, and as of July 23, 2020, 15,455,848 cases of
COVID-19 (in accordance with the applied case definitions and testing strategies in
the affected countries) are confirmed in more than 227 countries and 26 cruise ships
[2]. Currently, there are 5,415,828 active cases and 631,775 deaths.
As of spring 2020, Italy is one of the countries suffering the most with the
COVID-19 outbreak. One of the most critical facts about COVID-19, that affected
Italy too, is that a significant number of cases, mainly those of young age, has been
reported as asymptomatic [3], leading to fast spread of the infection. Fortunately,
asymptomatic cases have a shorter duration of viral shedding and lower viral load
[4, 5]. However, the proportion of asymptomatic cases can range from 4%-80% [6]
and most of the time they play a key role in infection transmission, therefore it is
very important to model both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases. The most crucial
element of COVID-19 pandemic is demography. After the end of the quarantine and
lock-down there have been many examples of countries where the number of cases
increased rapidly. Although, demography is a very important element in epidemics
and especially in the case of COVID-19, only a few models describe the dynamics
of infection with SARS-CoV-2 considering demographic terms. To this end, here we
develop an SEIAR model, considering both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases,
and demographic terms, with a constant influx of susceptible individuals. In this
study we only consider horizontal infection transmission1.
As the development of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 is an urgent demand2, a
study of the epidemiological consequences that an imperfect potential vaccine can
have is needed, and to the best of our knowledge, there is currently no relevant study
in the literature. Here, we develop a theoretical framework to assess the vaccine
effectiveness and the epidemiological consequences of a potential vaccine. Given
that the second phase might lead to more asymptomatic cases than the first phase we
need to investigate the asymptomatic group for different coverage and efficacy. The
model derived in this study provides new insights on the effect of different vaccine
coverage and efficacy on infection spread in a population with demographics.
This study is organized as follows. In Section 2, we develop a new SEIAR model
for COVID-19. We derive the R 0 of the model and we study the local and global
stability of the steady states. Numerical result with a focus on data fitted to Italy case
are presented. In Section 3, we extend our model including also a vaccinated group
of individuals, we study the global stability of the steady states and we predict the
vaccine effectiveness. We conclude in Section 4 with a summary and discussion of
future directions.
1 Horizontal transmission is transmission by direct contact between infected and susceptible individuals or between disease vectors and susceptible individuals, that are not in a parent-progeny
relationship. Vertical transmission is the passage of the disease-causing agent from mother to baby
during the period immediately before and after birth.
2 During the days of writing this paper, promising progress has been announced in this direction.

2 Modelling Transmission Dynamics
2.1 An SEIAR Model for COVID-19
In this Section we model the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 among people causing
COVID-19. To derive our model we consider people who have been in contact
with an infectious individual, but remain uninfected for a latency period. Moreover,
a significant number of individuals being infected remain asymptomatic, due to
various factors such as age, health condition etc [3]. To this end, we classify the total
population (𝑁) into five subclasses: susceptible (𝑆), latent/exposed (𝐸), symptomatic
infectious (𝐼), asymptomatic infectious (𝐴), and recovered (𝑅) individuals, hence we
have that 𝑆 + 𝐸 + 𝐼 + 𝐴 + 𝑅 = 𝑁. We can consider that 𝑁 is practically constant,
since the time-span of the epidemiological phenomenon is relatively short and 𝑁
is relatively large. We take into account demographic terms and we consider the
transmission to be exclusively horizontal. The SEIAR model is governed by the
following system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations:
d𝑆
d𝑡
d𝐸
d𝑡
d𝐼
d𝑡
d𝐴
d𝑡
d𝑅

= 𝜇𝑁 − 𝛽 𝐼 𝑆𝐼 − 𝛽 𝐴 𝑆 𝐴 − 𝜇𝑆,

(1b)

= 𝑘 (1 − 𝑞) 𝐸 − (𝛾 𝐼 + 𝜇) 𝐼,

(1c)

= 𝑘𝑞𝐸 − (𝛾 𝐴 + 𝜇) 𝐴,

(1d)

= 𝛾 𝐼 𝐼 + 𝛾 𝐴 𝐴 − 𝜇𝑅,

(1e)

with initial conditions:
(𝑆 (0) , 𝐸 (0) , 𝐼 (0) , 𝐴 (0) , 𝑅 (0)) = (𝑆0 , 𝐸 0 , 𝐼0 , 𝐴0 , 𝑅0 ) ∈ R+0

where 𝜇 is the birth/death rate, 𝛽 𝐼 and 𝛽 𝐴 the transmission rates of 𝐼 and 𝐴, respectively3, 𝑘 the incubation rate, i.e. the rate of latent individuals becoming infectious, 𝑞
the proportion of asymptomatic infectious individuals, 𝛾 𝐼 and 𝛾 𝐴 the recovery rates
of infectious and asymptomatic infectious individuals, respectively. A flow diagram
of the model is illustrated in Fig. 1. A straightforward application of the classical
ODE theory yields that the above Cauchy problem is well-posed.

𝑁
individuals and 𝜛𝐼 , 𝐴 is the probability of a contact to be effective in turning an 𝑆 individual into
an 𝐼 or 𝐴 one, respectively.

2.2 The Basic Reproductive Ratio
The average number of secondary cases arising from one infection when the entire
population is susceptible is defined as the basic reproductive ratio and denoted by
R 0 . Being the most important quantity on infectious disease epidemiology, the basic
reproductive ratio is a dimensionless quantity, which is often used to reflect how
infectious a disease is. To define R 0 we calculate the next-generation matrix of the
system, see, e.g., [7, 8].
First, we linearise model (1) around the disease-free steady state, (𝑁, 0, 0, 0, 0),
and we consider the infected states, i.e. 𝐸, 𝐼, 𝐴, to obtain the linearised infection

Theorem 1 If R 0 < 1, the disease-free steady state, (𝑁, 0, 0, 0, 0), of system (1) is
locally stable.
Proof For the disease-free steady state (𝑁, 0, 0, 0, 0) we obtain a double negative
eigenvalue, 𝜆1 = −𝜇, and the characteristic equation of the reduced 3x3 matrix

We prove the stability of this steady state using the Routh-Hurwitz criterion [9].
The disease-free steady state is stable if and only if
𝛾 𝐼 + 𝛾 𝐴 + 𝑘 + 3𝜇 > 0,

(𝑘 + 𝜇) (𝛾 𝐼 + 𝜇) (𝛾 𝐴 + 𝜇) − 𝛽 𝐼 𝑁 𝑘 (1 − 𝑞) (𝛾 𝐴 + 𝜇) − 𝛽 𝐴 𝑁 𝑘𝑞 (𝛾 𝐼 + 𝜇) > 0, (7)

The inequality (6) always holds. The inequality (7) can be equivalently written as
R0 =

(𝑘 + 𝜇) (𝛾 𝐼 + 𝜇) (𝑘 + 𝜇) (𝛾 𝐴 + 𝜇)

(9)

By using Mathematica [10] we can confirm that the inequality (8) holds for R 0 < 1,
thus the disease-free steady state is stable.

Since we incorporate the demographic terms, we are interested in exploring the
longer-term persistence and the endemic dynamics of the disease. Setting equal to
zero the right-hand side of system (1), we find a unique endemic steady state. Then,
we are interested in determining the conditions necessary for endemic steady state
stability.

From the Routh-Hurwitz criterion, the endemic steady (10) is locally stable if and
only if
𝛼0 > 0, 𝛼1 > 0, 𝛼3 > 0 and 𝛼1 𝛼2 𝛼3 − 𝛼12 − 𝛼0 𝛼32 > 0.
We always have that 𝛼3 > 0, whereas 𝑎 0 > 0 is equivalent to R 0 > 1. By using
Mathematica [10] we can confirm that the rest of the above relations hold for R 0 > 1,
thus the endemic steady state is stable.

2.4 Global Stability Analysis of the SEIAR Model
Theorem 3 If R 0 ≤ 1, then the disease-free steady state, (𝑁, 0, 0, 0, 0), of system (1)
is globally asymptotically stable.

Proof We prove the global stability of the disease-free steady state (𝑁, 0, 0, 0, 0) by
constructing a Lyapunov function. We consider the function V1 : R+ × R3 → R with

Thus, if R 0 ≤ 1 then V10 ≤ 0 for all 𝑡 ≥ 0 and (𝑆, 𝐸, 𝐼, 𝐴) ∈ R+ × R3 sufficiently
close to (𝑁, 0, 0, 0), and V10 (𝑡) = 0 holds only for (𝑆, 𝐸, 𝐼, 𝐴) = (𝑁, 0, 0, 0). Hence,
the singleton {(𝑁, 0, 0, 0)} is the largest invariant set for which V10 = 0. Then, from
LaSalle’s Invariance Principle [11] it follows that the disease-free steady state is
globally asymptotically stable.

2.5 Numerical Simulations for the SEIAR Model
We proceed to the estimation of the already known epidemic curve of the disease in
d𝑅
Italy, as obtained from the data set [12], by
(see, e.g., [13] and [14]). We plot
d𝑡
together the two functions in Fig. 2. The total population of Italy is 60,456,999. Once
the restriction of movement (quarantine) during the manifestation of COVID-19 was
applied, it limited the spread of the disease. To this end we follow the approach in
[15] and we consider as the total population N = 60,456,999/250.
In Fig. 3 we show the dynamics of the proportion of the values of model (1) for
the set of parameters used in Fig. 2. We see in Fig. 3a that for this set of parameters
the solution of the system has an oscillatory behaviour towards the endemic steady
state. This can be more clear in Fig. 3b, where the proportion of the infectious
population (both symptomatic and asymptomatic) oscillates towards the proportion
of the steady state 𝐼 ∗ + 𝐴∗ .

Vaccinated Population
In this section we consider the subclass of the vaccinated-with-a-prophylacticvaccine (𝑉) individuals. We set 0 ≤ 𝑝 ≤ 1 for the vaccine coverage, as well as
0 ≤ 𝜖 < 1 for the vaccine efficacy [16]. Then, the model becomes

Following the same steps as before and using the disease-free steady state of the
model, ((1 − 𝑝) 𝑁, 𝑝𝑁, 0, 0, 0, 0), we have that the basic reproductive ratio for the

3.1 Numerical Simulations for the SVEIAR Model
To assess vaccine effectiveness we focus on three important epidemiological measures [17]: (i) the risk of infection spread, represented by R 0𝑉 ; (ii) the peak prevalence
of infection; (iii) the time at which the peak prevalence occurs. Relation (13) shows
that the vaccine coverage, 𝑝, and vaccine efficacy, 𝜖, act multiplicatively on R 0 .
As the proportion of asymptomatic cases is still unknown, in Fig 5a we present a
contour plot of the dependence of R 0𝑉 on the vaccine coverage and vaccine efficacy,
for different proportion of asymptomatic cases. The coloured curves represent the
threshold R 0𝑉 = 1 in (13), between the infection spread (represented by the area
below the threshold; R 0𝑉 > 1) or not (represented by the area above the threshold; R 0𝑉 < 1). The plot indicates that the vaccine efficacy and coverage need to be
greater for small proportion of asymptomatic cases. As the number of symptomatic
cases increases a more effective vaccine is needed. We see that even for a severe
COVID-19 epidemic, as in our case, the vaccine can prevent the infection spread if
both the vaccine efficacy and the vaccine coverage are high. Considering however
that the data reflect a period where the severity of COVID-19 was not yet known
and the average number of close contacts between individuals was very high due to
occasions and events, the transmission rate, 𝛽 𝐼 , as obtained by the data is not the
most appropriate index to predict vaccine effectiveness, as the situation has changed
dramatically and close contacts have been significantly reduced. Hence, in Fig 5b
we present a corresponding contour plot for a lower 𝛽 𝐼 . We see that in the case of
a reduced transmission rate the vaccine can prevent the infection spread, even for
imperfect vaccines and small vaccine coverage.
In Fig 6 we see the effect of vaccine efficacy on the proportion of the infection
dynamics for high (Fig 6a) and low (Fig 6b) transmission rates. Higher vaccine
efficacy leads to milder, but prolonged epidemics due to the slower rate of infection
transmission. Moreover, it causes later occurrence of the first infection incidence and
peak prevalence, and a slower rate of postpeak prevalence decline.

4 Conclusions
We presented an ad hoc SEIAR model with horizontal transmission and demographic terms for the epidemic spread of COVID-19, and we extended the model to
include vaccination. The stability of both models is proved by implementing suitable

Lyapunov functions; the model is fitted to real data from the epidemic in Italy. We
studied the condition under which a vaccine can prevent disease spread. We accessed
the vaccine effectiveness focusing on the risk of infection spread, the peak prevalence
of infection and the time at which the peak prevalence occurs.
Future work includes further investigation of the vaccine model, by incorporating
different vaccination strategies, and if possible the comparison with biological data.
An extension of the model will also include additional important factors of COVID19 spread, such as the population age, the geographical spread of the the epidemics
(see e.g. Refs [28, 29, 30] and other references therein) and the waning immunity
gained by infected individuals, as well as vertical transmission and migration terms
for the infected individuals.
