Abstract—In this paper, we investigate the distributed link removal strategy for networked meta-population epidemics. In particular, a deterministic networked susceptible-infected-recovered
(SIR) model is considered to describe the epidemic evolving
process. In order to curb the spread of epidemics, we present
the spectrum-based optimization problem involving the PerronFrobenius eigenvalue of the matrix constructed by the network
topology and transition rates. A modified distributed link removal
strategy is developed such that it can be applied to the SIR
model with heterogeneous transition rates on weighted digraphs.
The proposed approach is implemented to control the COVID-19
pandemic by using the reported infected and recovered data in
each state of Germany. The numerical experiment shows that
the infected percentage can be significantly reduced by using the
distributed link removal strategy.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Various models have been proposed to mathematically
characterize the spread of epidemics [1], [2]. Among others, the compartmental models, e.g., the susceptible-infectedsusceptible (SIS) model and the susceptible-infected-recovered
(SIR) model, play the fundamental role. One important class of
the compartmental models are the scalar deterministic models,
which can be referred to in the survey [3]. These models have
been widely investigated and qualitatively characterize the
macroscopic behavior of the dynamics of infectious diseases,
for example, the COVID-19 pandemic [4], [5]. However,
the drawback of the scalar models is that they are based
on the hidden assumption that there exists a well-mixed
population, i.e., individuals have the same chances to interact
with each other. In fact, this assumption introduces not only
the homogeneity in network structure but also in individual
behaviors, which does not generally hold in the globalized
world with close connection via, for instance, face-to-face
social networks and traffic networks. Both of these heterogeneities, nonetheless, play significant roles in shaping the
epidemic spreading process. This brings us to the network
epidemic models, where the nodal dynamics are considered.

There are two kinds of interpretations of the network epidemic
models: (a) the disease spreads on a network where each
node represents one individual and (b) the disease spreads
on a network of interconnected sub-population (groups of
population), i.e., meta-population. Clear, the meta-population
interpretation provides an efficient and comprehensive way of
depicting pandemics which breaks out would-wide and spreads
rapidly in communities. Thus, in this paper, we investigate the
control strategy for networked meta-population epidemics.
In general, from the perspective of network systems, control
strategies for network epidemics are categorized into node manipulation and edge manipulation. Previous literatures mainly
focus on node manipulation, especially solving the resource
allocation problem [6]–[8] by interacting with transition rates.
Although they manage to control the disease spreading process
with respect to certain optimal criteria, how to explicitly implement the control signal, which is associated with the modeling
of the impact of the resources, remains to be explored. Instead,
the edge manipulation has been widely applied in the world to
curb the epidemic spreading. For example, city lock-down can
be regarded as cutting off all the connections in the graph. By
using link-removal strategy, the spectral radius of the graph
can be decreased such that it is below the epidemic threshold
[9] resulting in the disease-free equilibrium of the network
epidemic model. However, it is a combinatorial and NP-hard
problem to optimally design the network topology on which
the epidemic spreads [10]. Recently, Xue and Hirche propose
an algorithm combining power iteration (PI), max-consensus,
and event-trigger optimization to approximately solve this
problem in a distributed manner [11]. Their method requires
the network to be undirected. Nonetheless, real epidemic
spreading network is generally directed or at least bi-directed
based on the fact of asymmetric traffic flow between locations.
In addition, the epidemic threshold adopted in [10], [11] is
rooted in an epidemic model with homogeneous transition
rates, i.e., the transition rates of each sub-population are
identical. Thus new criterion based on epidemic models with
heterogeneous transition rates [12] needs to be introduced.
The main contribution of this paper is to develop a distributed link removal strategy to control networked SIR metapopulation epidemics. We extend the algorithm in [11] such
that it is applicable for meta-population epidemics with heterogeneous transition rates on weighted digraphs. This distributed
strategy enjoys the advantage of locally retrievable information
and no centralized decision-maker. Besides, from practical
point of view, we implement the proposed algorithm to curb

2

the spread of COVID-19 pandemic by using real data. We
identify the infection matrix (infection rates and adjacency matrix of the network) and the curing rates by using the reported
infection and recovered cases of each state of Germany. Built
upon the identified infection matrix and curing rates, we show
that the infected percentage of Germany can be significantly
reduced by applying the proposed algorithm.

II. P ROBLEM F ORMULATION
In this section, we recall some necessary notions from graph
theory, introduce the meta-population SIR model, and provide
the problem formulation.
A. Preliminaries
We consider a social network described by a weighted
directed graph G(V, E, W ) with n (n ≥ 2) nodes, where
V = {1, 2, . . . , n} and E ⊆ V × V are the sets of nodes and
edges, respectively. The adjacency matrix W = [wij ] ∈ Rn×n
is nonnegative and with zero diagonal entries. For two distinct
nodes, wij > 0 if and only if there exists a link from node j to
i, i.e., (j, i) ∈ E. For the convenience of further presentation,
the in-neighborhood of node i is also introduced as
Niin = {j : wij > 0, j ∈ V}.

(1)

In this article, we confine ourselves that the graph G is strongly
connected, i.e., W is irreducible. We then introduce the
Perron-Frobenius Theorem for irreducible nonnegative matrix.
Lemma 1. [13, Theorem 2.7] Given that a square matrix M
is an irreducible nonnegative matrix. The following statements
hold:
(i) The largest eigenvalue of M , λ1 (M ), is a positive real
eigenvalue equal to its spectral radius ρ(M ).
(ii) ρ(M ) is a simple eigenvalue of M .
(iii) There exist a unique right eigenvector y ≫ 0 and a
unique left eigenvector z ⊤ ≫ 0⊤ corresponding to ρ(M ).
Since the adjacency matrix W of the strongly connected
graph G is nonnegative irreducible, Lemma 1 can be directly
applied. In the remaining of this article, we denote positive

vectors y = [y1 , y2 , . . . , yn ]⊤ and z ⊤ = [z1 , z2 , . . . , zn ] the
right and left eigenvector corresponding to ρ(W ).
B. Meta-Population Susceptible-Infected-Recovered Model
Consider epidemics spreading on a weighted directed graph
G(V, E, W ). The dynamics of each group i ∈ V satisfies the
meta-population SIR model as follows
ẋi (t) = (1 − xi (t) − ri (t))

n
X

βi wij xj (t) − δi xi (t)

j=1

(2)

ṙi (t) = δi xi (t),
where xi (t), ri (t) ∈ R represent the proportions of infected
(I) and recovered (R) cases in group i at time instant t,
respectively. βi , δi > 0 are the infection and curing rate of
group i, respectively. Since the transition rates are generally
different for each group and the groups are not well-mixed, the
model in (2) characterizes the heterogeneity of the epidemic
spreading process. From practical point of view, we adopted
the SIR model described by xi and ri , because the infected and
recovered cases are regularly reported while the proportion of
susceptible individuals in population can be hardly known. In
addition, the dynamics of ith group’s proportion of susceptible
cases si (t) can be omitted in the SIR model (2) in light of the
fact that si (t) + xi (t) + ri (t) ≡ 1 for all i ∈ V and t ≥ 0.
Furthermore, it is desirable that the states in the model (2)
stay in the following simplex.
∆ = {(a, b) : a, b ≥ 0, a + b ≤ 1}.

(3)

Let x(t) = [x1 (t), x2 (t), . . . , xN (t)]⊤ and r(t) =
[r1 (t), r2 (t), . . . , rN (t)]⊤ be the stacked infection proportions and recovering proportions, respectively. Let β =
[β1 , β2 , . . . , βN ]⊤ and δ = [δ1 , δ2 , . . . , δN ]⊤ . By denoting
X(t) = diag(x(t)), R(t) = diag(r(t)), B = diag(β), and
D = diag(δ), the compact form of the meta-population SIR
model (2) reads
ẋ(t) = (1 − X(t) − R(t))BW x(t) − Dx(t)
ṙ(t) = −Dx(t).

(4)

The SIR model is considered in this article due to its wide
application in the describing epidemic spreading process.
Nonetheless, the results and algorithms in the following sections can be straightforwardly extended to other compartmental models, e.g., SI, SIS, SIRS, SEIR.
In the scenarios of epidemic curbing and rumor mitigation,
the disease-free case, i.e., x = 0, is of great significance. The
following lemma collects the behavior of the meta-population
SIR model (4).
Lemma 2. Consider the meta-population SIR model (4) with
positive transition rates on a strongly connected weighted
digraph G(V, E, W ). The following statement hold:
(i) If (xi (0), ri (0)) ∈ ∆ for all i ∈ V, there holds
(xi (t), ri (t)) ∈ ∆ for all i ∈ V and t ≥ 0.
(ii) The set of equilibrium points is the set of pairs (0N , r∗ ),
for any r∗ ∈ [0, 1]n .

3

(iii) If α(BW − D) ≤ −ǫ for some ǫ > 0, x(t) approaches
0 exponentially fast, i.e., kx(t)k ≤ kx(0)kKe−ǫt, for
some K > 0.
Proof. Consider the dynamics of each node in (2). Assume
that for some time instant τ ≥ 0, there hold (ri (τ ), xi (τ )) ∈ ∆
for all i ∈ V. We then inspect the following three cases: (a) if
xi (τ ) = 0, then ẋi (τ ) ≥ 0; (b) if ri (τ ) = 0, then ṙi (τ ) ≥ 0;
and (c) if xi (τ )+ ri (τ ) = 1, then ẋi (τ )+ ṙi (τ ) = −δi xi (τ ) ≤
0. By combining the above three cases, we can obtain the
statement (i).
The statement (ii) has been proved in [1] and the proof is
saved for triviality.
We then prove the statement (iii). In light of the statement
(i), we can obtain
ẋ < (BW − D)x.

(5)

Thus by comparison principle [14], we only need to prove the
auxiliary system ẏ = (BW −D)y converges to 0 exponentially
fast. It is straightforwardly true since there hold α(BW −D) ≤
−ǫ. Thus we complete the proof.
Remark 1. By Lemma 2, it is straightforward that ∆ is an
invariant set for the infection and recovered proportions, given
nonnegative transition rates. Note that distinct from the SIS
model, the SIR model always converge to a disease-free case if
the curing rate δi is positive. In this regard, what matters for the
SIR model is not whether there will be healthy state, but how
fast the disease dies out. By the statement (iii), the decay rate
of the infection proportion is furnished by α(BW − D). Thus,
we control α(BW − D) to curb the spread of the epidemics.

Given a weighted digraph G = {V, E, W }, the link removal
problem is formally described as follows: for a fixed budget
|∆E| = r(r ∈ N+ ), select a set of edges ∆E from E to
construct a new graph Gr = {V, E \ ∆E, Wr }, such that the
exponential decay rate of the meta-population SIR model (4)
with positive infection and curing rates is maximized, i.e.,
max

lij =1

1⊤ m = r,
where m = [m1 , m2 , . . . , m|E| ]⊤ with mlij = 1 if the edge
labeled as lij is removed from E and mlij = 0, otherwise.
Remark 2. For epidemics with infection rate β and curing
rate γ, we have the reproduction number R = βγ . If R < 1,
the smaller R is, the faster the epidemic dies out. For metapopulation SIR model (4), the dominant eigenvalue of the
matrix A can be considered as the reproduction number which
takes into consideration the influence of the network topology
as well as the heterogeneous transition rates.

III. D ISTRIBUTED L INK R EMOVAL S TRATEGY
In this section, we propose a distributed algorithm to solve
the link removal problem (9) for the meta-population SIR
epidemic model on weighted digraphs. By using eigenvaluesensitivity-based approximation, we introduce the dominant
left and right eigenvectors of the matrix A to solve the problem
in question. Then we design a distributed algorithm based on
power iteration and max-consensus algorithm.

A. Eigenvalue-Sensitivity-Based Approximation

C. Link Removal Problem

∆E⊆E

After labeling edge (j, i) ∈ E on graph G by lij , the
optimization problem (8) can be reformulated as

Proposition 1. The optimization problem (9) can be approximately solved by

1⊤ m = r.

α(BWr − D) ≤ −ǫ

(6)

|E| = r.
Note that since B and D are diagonal matrices with positive
diagonal entries, the optimization problem (6) is equivalent
to minimize α(D−1 BWr ), where the matrix D−1 BWr is
irreducible nonnegative. For the convenience of presentation,
we denote
∆W = W − Wr ,

A := D−1 BW,

Ar := D−1 BWr ,

∆Ar := D−1 B∆W.

(7)

In light of Lemma 1, we can rewrite the optimization problems
as follows
min λ1 (Ar )
∆E⊆E
(8)
s.t. |E| = r.

Proof. Since the graph G = {V, E, W } is strongly connected,
λ1 (A) is positive and simple by Lemma 1. In addition, the
right and left (normalized) eigenvectors, y and z ⊤ , are strictly
positive, i.e., y, z ≫ 0. According to the perturbation theory
in [15, p.183], the following expansion holds
λ1 (A − ∆Ar ) = λ1 (A) −

z ⊤ ∆Ar y
+ O(k∆Ar k).
z ⊤y

(11)

For graphs G with a large spectral gap between λ1 (W ) and
λ1 (A), the higher order items can be neglected and the firstorder approximation equals λ1 (A − ∆Ar ). Since y and z ⊤
are normalized, i.e., z ⊤ y = 1, we can obtain the expression
of ∆λ1 (A, ∆Ar ) by rewritten z ⊤ ∆Ar y in a component-wise
manner.

4

B. Distributed Algorithm Design
To implement the algorithm in a distributed way, we firstly
introduced distributed estimation of the eigenvectors. Based
on the estimated eigenvectors, we carried out the removal
algorithm. Power iteration (PI) is a common method to estimate dominant eigenvalue.The eigenvector corresponding to
the dominant eigenvalue of matrix C is given by
ˆ
C ξ(t)
,
(12)
ξ̂(t + 1) =
ˆ
kC ξ(t)k
ˆ is estimation at step t. It worth noting that, power
where ξ(t)
iteration demand a primitive matrix C, which may not be the
case for defined matrix A. So we set C = I + A to acquire
the eigenvector.
A problem for the distributed complement would be the
ˆ
normalization in (12) at each iteration step. To get kC ξ(t)k,
global information is needed. Therefore, we use a maxˆ
consensus protocol to help getting the ξ(t)
converged, not
normalized though.
For ŷ(t) = [ŷ1 (t), ..., ŷn (t)]⊤ , each node i has access to its
own value ŷi (t) and its neighbours’ value ŷj (t), j ∈ Ni . Then
the PI in (12) can be modified as


n
X
wij ŷj (t) ,
(13)
ŷi (t + 1) = ki (t) ŷi (t) +
j=1

where ki (t) helps in the convergence of ŷi (t + 1) and can
be achieved in the following max-consensus way. Firstly, we
calculate a candidate locally, as


n
X
1 
hi (t + 1) =
wij ŷj (t) .
(14)
ŷi (t) +
ŷi (t)
j=1
Then, every node shares this value with its neighbors and
choose the max value from the values of its neighbors’ and
itself’s:
pi (t + ts + 1) = max pj (t + ts ), pi (t) = hi (t),
j∈Niin

(15)

where ts ∈ N≥0 . Terminated at a mixing time Td , which means
at time t + Td a max-consensus is reached that
p1 (t + Td ) = · · · = pn (t + Td ) = max hj (t).
j∈V

Setting ki (t) =

1
pi (t) ,

can be achieved.
Remark 3. In the proposed link removal algorithm, the using
of Lemma 1 calls for an irreducible non negative Ar , which
equals to a strongly connected Wr , with the definition in (7).
That can be a strong assumption for a matrix. However, as
globalized we are these days, it is nearly impossible for any
city or sub-population to stay cut off physically from the
outside world. Especially in the severe pandemic situation,
necessary medical and living materials must be sent by people.
Therefore, no vertex is supposed to be isolated, and the
assumption of a strongly connected adjacency matrix after
removal is reasonable and necessary.
IV. S IMULATIONS
A. Parameter Learning via COVID-19 data in Germany
We identified the propagation network of the COVID-19
virus consisting of 16 nodes. Each node represents a federal
state in Germany. The reasons to use the data in Germany are
two folds. Firstly, Germany closed the borders with neighbors
on March 15th [17]. Considering that the incubation period
of COVID-19 is up to 14 days, the network of federal states
in Germany in April and May can be viewed as isolated, i.e.,
infection from external nodes (other countries) is excluded.
Secondly, Germany guaranteed sufficient testing capacity and
numerous intensive beds, which is far below the upper limit of
the healthcare resource they can provide. Therefore, the data
of Germany can well interpret the infection characteristic of
the virus.
We use the infection data of the 16 federal states of
Germany from [18]. The identified network is a weighted
asymmetric one consisting of 16 notes. From the geographical
point of view, not all the federal states are adjacent to each
other. However, the network can be treated as nearly fullyconnected due to the logistic, business/personal trips, etc..
Because the data from [18] is published once a day, the
propagation network is identified based on the following
discrete-time model.
x[k + 1] − x[k] = (I − X[k] − R[k])BW x[k] − X[k]δ

(16)

r[k + 1] − r[k] = X[k]δ,
(20)
which can be further simplified in linear parameterization form

ki (t) can be formulated as

1
.
(17)
maxj∈V hj (t − Td )
Theorem 1. Given a connected graph G, the eigenvector y
corresponding to λ1 (A(G)) can be computed distributively by
repeating steps (13)-(17).

matrix and Ξ = [ξ[k], ξ[k + 1], · · · , ξ[k + N ]] being the vector
containing the data of daily increase in infected cases. N ∈ N
is the number of utilized data. Since the network consists of
16 nodes, the data of at least 17 days is required to ensure the
full rank of the regressor matrix. In our simulation, we utilize
the data of 25 days from May 24th to April 18th, i.e., N =
25. The optimal parameter θ∗ is obtained by adopting lsqlin
function of Matlab with interior-point algorithm. In reality,
the recorded data is not perfect because of various reasons
such as the delay of reporting cases and uncertain incubation
periods. The identified network is the nearest solution to the
real network, which satisfies the constrain in (24).

B. Implementation of the Link Removal Strategy
We slightly abuse the network obtained in Section IV.A by
setting the edges weight less than 0.001 to 0. This results in a
strongly connected digraph and better validates our algorithm.
Based on this processed graph, we initially test the estimation
of the principal eigenvector, which turns out to converge well
as shown in Fig. 2. The colorful ŷi grows for several iterations
and finally converge to the corresponding component of the
principal eigenvector represented by the black dash line.
To verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm on
solving problem (9), we compare the dominant eigenvalue
λ1 (Ar ) of the proposed removal algorithm with a random
removal strategy. It worth noticing that the estimation of the
dominant eigenvalue after every removal is not necessary. To
remove more than one edge after an estimation is possible and
can conserve computational efforts. With this concern, we set
different step-size in our simulation. The Fig. 3 shows that,
regardless of the step-size, the proposed algorithm significantly
reduces the dominant eigenvalue of A, so that much better
performance is achieved. As for the results of different stepsizes, similar effects are achieved by 1 edge per step and 2
edges per step. Things are the same for 5 edges per step and 10
edges per step, which show little worse performance than that
of 1 and 2 edges per step. In all, to minimize the step enhances
the performance, but the difference is not significant if the gap
between step-size settings is not huge. The links directed to
Berlin and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern are more likely to be
removed. That would possibly because of the high weights of
links pointing to them, as the removal of fast-spreading link
may helps in containing the pandemic.
We carry an experiment in one-step scenario and further
test the connectivity by abandoning the proposal that harm
connectivity. In Fig. 3, the result is marked by the red cross,
the line of which is only slightly different with that of blue
spots representing removal without connectivity guarantee. It
is possibly because the graph is well connected. Despite of
the removal we have made, the connectivity is not damaged.
With the edges-removed graph, we make an estimation of
the COVID-19 epidemic and compare the result with that
of the approximated graph and the real data. In Fig. 4, the
decreasing rate of infection number shows obvious difference
among the three lines. The real infection number drops faster
than the estimation with identified parameters, which may
attribute to the more experienced treatment and improving
social distancing awareness. Moreover, the estimation with
graph processed by the proposed algorithm shows a steeper
decline than real data, which verifies that our network-based
method is able to control the pandemic in an effective way.

V. C ONCLUSION
In this paper, we propose a distributed link removal strategy
for the network meta-population SIR epidemics. Compared
with the previous work, this approach enjoys a more general
setting where the investigated network is relaxed to be a
weighted digraph. From practical point of view, the proposed
approach is applied to the scenario of curbing the COVID-19
spreading by using infection and recovered cases in each state
