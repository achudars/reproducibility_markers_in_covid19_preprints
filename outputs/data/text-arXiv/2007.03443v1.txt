Abstract
How can the birth and evolution of ideas and
communities in a network be studied over
time? We use a multimodal pipeline,
consisting of network mapping, topic
modeling, bridging centrality, and divergence
to analyze Twitter data surrounding the
COVID-19 pandemic. We use network
mapping to detect accounts creating content
surrounding COVID-19, then Latent
Dirichlet Allocation to extract topics, and
bridging centrality to identify topical and
non-topical bridges, before examining the
distribution of each topic and bridge over
time and applying Jensen-Shannon
divergence of topic distributions to show
communities that are converging in their
topical narratives.

1 Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic fostered an
information ecosystem rife with health mis- and
disinformation. Much as COVID-19 spreads
through human interaction networks (Davis et al.,
2020), disinformation about the virus travels
along
human
communication
networks.
Communities prone to conspiratorial thinking
(Oliver and Wood, 2014; Lewandowsky et al.,
2013), from QAnon to the vaccine hesitant,
actively spread problematic content to fit their
ideologies (Smith et al., 2020). When social
influence is exerted to distort information
landscapes (Centola & Macy, 2007; Barash,
Cameron et al., 2012; Zubiaga et al., 2016; Lazer
et al., 2018, Macy et al., 2019), large groups of
people can come to ignore or even counteract
public health policy and the advice of experts.
Rumors and mistruths can cause real world harm
(Chappell, 2020; Mckee & Middleton, 2019;

Crocco et al., 2002) – from tearing down 5G
infrastructure based on a conspiracy theory (Chan
et al., 2020) to ingesting harmful substances
misrepresented as “miracle cures” (O’Laughlin,
2020). Continuous downplaying of the virus by
influential people likely contributed to the
climbing US mortality and morbidity rate early in
the year (Bursztyn et al., 2020).
Disinformation researchers have noted this
unprecedented ‘infodemic’ (Smith et al., 2020)
and confluence of narratives. Understanding how
actors shape information through networks,
particularly during crises like COVID-19, may
enable health experts to provide updates and factchecking resources more effectively. Common
approaches to this, like tracking the volume of
indicators like hashtags, fail to assess deeper
ideologies shared between communities or how
those ideologies spread to culturally distant
communities. In contrast, our multimodal analysis
combines network science and natural language
processing to analyze the evolution of semantic,
user-generated, content about COVID-19 over
time and how this content spreads through Twitter
networks prone to mis-/disinformation. Semantic
and network data are complementary in models of
behavioral prediction, including rare and complex
psycho-social behaviors (Ruch, 2020). Studies of
coordinated information operations (Francois et
al., 2017) emphasize the importance of semantic
(messages’ effectiveness) and network layers
(messengers’ effectiveness).
We mapped networks of conversations
around COVID-19, revealing political, health,
and technological conspiratorial communities that
consistently
participate
in
COVID-19
conversation and share ideologically motivated
content to frame the pandemic to fit their
overarching narratives. To understand how
disinformation
is
spread
across
these

communities, we invoke theory on cultural holes
and bridging. Cultural bridges are patterns of
meaning, practice, and discourse that drive a
propensity for social closure and the formation of
clusters of like-minded individuals who share few
relationships with members of other clusters
except through bridging users who are
omnivorous in their social interests and span
multiple social roles (Pachucki & Breiger, 2010;
Vilhena et al 2014). While cultural holes/bridges
extend our ability to comprehend how mis/disinformation flow in networks and affect group
dynamics, this work has mostly focused on prosocial behavior. It has remained an open question
if cultural bridges operate similarly with nefarious
content as with beneficial information, as the
costs and punishments of sharing false and
potentially harmful content differ (Tsvetkova and
Macy, 2014; 2015). This work seeks to answer
that question by applying these theories to a
network with known conspiratorial content.
We turn to longitudinal topic analysis to
track narratives shared by these groups. While
some topical trends around the COVID-19
infodemic are obvious, others are nuanced.
Detecting and tracking subtle topical shifts and
influencing factors is important (DanescuNiculescu-Mizil et al., 2013), as new language
trends can indicate a group is adopting ideas of
anti-science groups (e.g., climate deniers, the
vaccine
hesitant).
Differences
between
community interests, breadth of focus, popularity
among topics, and evolution of conspiracy
theories can help us understand how public
opinion forms around events. These answers can
quantify anecdotal evidence about converging
conspiratorial groups online.
To capture these shifts, we analyze
evolving language trends across different
communities over the first five months of the
pandemic.
In
(Bail,
2016),
advocacy
organizations’ effectiveness in spreading
information was analyzed in the context of how
well their message ‘bridged’ different social
media audiences. A message that successfully

combined themes that typically resonated with
separate audiences received substantially more
engagements.
We
hypothesize
topical
convergence among communities discussing
COVID-19 will 1) correlate with new groups’
emergence and 2) be precursed by messages
combining previously disparate topics that
receive high engagement.

Account activity includes tweet text, timestamps, follows
and engagement based relationships over accounts.

Language classification was done with pycld3
(https://github.com/bsolomon1124/pycld3)

2 Methodology
2.1 Data
We use activity1 from 57,366 Twitter
accounts, recorded January-May 2020 and
acquired via the Twitter API. Non-English
Tweets2 were excluded from analysis. We
applied standard preprocessing, removing
punctuation and stop words3, as well as
lemmatization of text data. In total, 81,348,475
tweets are included.

2.2 Overview of Analysis
We use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
combined with divergence analysis (JensenShannon; Wong & You, 1995) to identify topical
convergence as an indication of the breadth and
depth of content spread over a network. We
expect that as communities enter the
conversation, topical distributions will reflect
their presence earlier than using network
mapping alone. We first mapped a network,
using COVID-19 related seeds from JanuaryMay 2020. We then applied LDA to the tweet
text of all accounts that met inclusion criteria
(discussed below), tracked the distribution of
topics both overall and for specific communities,
calculated bridging centrality measures to
identify topics that connect otherwise
disconnected groups.

2.3 Network Mapping

Punctuation and stopword removal was done with spaCy
(https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/blob/master/spacy/lang
/punctuation.py;
https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/blob/master/spacy/lang/
en/stop_words.py)

We constructed five network maps that
catalogue a collection of key social media
accounts around a particular topic – in this case,
COVID-19. Our maps represent cyber-social
landscapes (Etling et al., 2012) of key
communities sampled from representative seeds
(Hindman & Barash, 2018) of the topic to be
analyzed. We collect all tweets containing one or
more seed hashtags and remove inactive
accounts (based on an activity threshold
described below). We collect a network of semistable relationships (Twitter follows) between
accounts, removing poorly connected nodes
using k-core decomposition (Dorogovtsev et al.,
2006). We apply a technique called “attentive
clustering” that applies hierarchical
agglomerative clustering to assign nodes to
communities based on shared following patterns.
We label each cluster using machine learning
and human expert verification and organize
clusters into expert identified and labeled groups.
2.4 Map Series Background
Our maps can be seen as monthly
“snapshots” of mainstream global conversations
around coronavirus on Twitter. These maps were
seeded on the same set of hashtags
(#CoronavirusOutbreak, #covid19, #coronavirus,
#covid, "COVID19", "COVID-19"), to allow a
comparison in network structure and activity
over time. For the first three months, accounts
that used seed hashtags three or more times were
included; for subsequent months, COVID-19
conversations became so ubiquitous that we
benefited from collecting all accounts that used
seed hashtags at least once. Mapping the cybersocial landscape around hashtags of interest,
rather than patterns of how content was shared,
reveals the semi-stable structural communities of
accounts engaged in the conversation.

This research defines a document as all tweets for a given
account during a single week (Monday-Sunday)
concatenated and uses a matrix of TF-IDF scores in place of
raw word frequencies.

With α being a measure of document topic density (as α
increases so does the likelihood that a document will be
associated with multiple topics), and β being a measure of

2.5 Topic Modeling
After extracting and cleaning the tweets’
text, we create an LDA model. LDA requires a
corpus of documents, a matrix of those
documents and their respective words, and
various parameters and hyperparameters4. LDA,
by design, does not explicitly model temporal
relationships. Therefore, our decision to define a
document as weekly collections of tweets for a
given user allows for comparison of potentially
time-bounded topics.
We use Gensim (Řehůřek & Sojka, 2010)
to build and train a model, with the number of
topics K= 50, and two hyperparameters α =
0.253 and β = 0.9465, all tuned using Optuna6 to
optimize both for coherence score and human
interpretability. LDA then maps documents to
topics such that each topic is identified by a
multinomial distribution over words and each
document is denoted by a multinomial
distribution over topics. While variants of LDA
include an explicit time component, such as
Wang and McCallum’s (2006) Topics over Time
model or Blei and Lafferty’s (2006) Dynamic
Topic Model, these extensions are often
inflexible when the corpus of interest has large
changes in beta distributions over time, and
further impose constraints on the time periods
which would have been unsuitable for this
analysis.
Applying LDA with K = 50 yielded topics
(see Appendix A) that can be distinguished by
subject matter expert analysis. A substantial
portion of topics related to COVID-19, politics
at national and international levels, international
relations, and conspiracy theories. We also
identified a small subset of social media
marketing and/or peripheral topics, which
covered animal rights, inspirational quotes (topic
10), and follow trains (topics 23 and 32).

topic word density (as β increases so does the likelihood
that topics use more words from the corpus). LDA is a
generative, latent variable model which assumes all
(observed) documents are generated by a set of
(unobserved) topics, hyperparameters have a noticeable
impact on the assignment of documents to topics.

2.6 Cultural Bridge Analysis
In addition to topics derived from LDA, we
extracted hashtags, screen names, and URLs
from tweets as possible cultural content that
bridges communities. For each week, we
construct an undirected multimodal graph where
each node represents a cluster, topic, or content.
Clusters have edges to topics with a weight
representing average topic representativeness
among cluster members, and edges to cultural
content with a weight according to the number of
unique cluster members using said content
divided by maximum usage of an artifact of that
type. After constructing the graph, we calculate
nodes’ bridging centrality,

which adjusts betweenness centrality with

This lack of cohesion or “center” to the
network is not unusual for a global conversation
map, as dense clusters often denote national subcommunities. However, the first coronavirus
map covers a time period in which the outbreak
was largely contained to China, with the
exception of cases reported in Thailand toward
the end of January.8 During this time, the
Chinese government and its various media
outlets would be expected to form that core
informational source. As noted in previous
studies and reporting of health crises,

historical distrust in governing bodies makes

respect to neighbors’ degrees to better identify
nodes spanning otherwise disconnected clusters
(Hwang et. al, 2006). We select the top 20
bridges by node type for further investigation.

3 Results
3.1 Five Months of Maps
All five maps are visibly multipolar, with
densely clustered poles and sparsely populated
centers7. This indicates that strongly intraconnected communities are involved in the
conversation despite its global scope and each
geographic and ideological cluster has its own
insular sources of information - there is a dearth
of shared, global sources of information.

We visualize the map network using a force-directed
layout algorithm similar to Fruchterman-Rheingold (1991)
– individual accounts in the map are represented by spheres,

spring force based on their social proximity assign a color
to each account based on its parent cluster.

consensus from the medical and science
community challenging, particularly in online
spaces.9 This in turn creates voids of both
information and data for bad actors to capitalize
up.
3.2 Cultural Convergence Case Study: QAnon
Our pipeline yielded a large set of results
detailing the cultural convergence of clusters
over time in the Covid-19 network maps and the
topical bridges that aided this convergence. The
QAnon community is a particularly apt example
since researchers studying this topic have
qualitatively noted the recent acceleration of
QAnon membership since the beginning of the
pandemic and its convergence with other online

communities. The aim of the QAnon case study
is to illustrate the power of this cultural
convergence method and reflect similar results
we see in numerous groups across our collection
of Covid-19 map clusters.
3.3 QAnon and Covid-19

Fig.2 QAnon in February, April, and May.
QAnon is a political conspiracy theory
formed in 2017 (LaFrance, 2020). The
community maintains that there is a secret cabal
of elite billionaires and democratic politicians
that rule the world, also known as the “deep
state.” As the theory goes, Donald Trump is
secretly working to dismantle this powerful
group of people. Given Trump’s central role and
the vilification of democratic politicians, this farright theory is most commonly adopted by
Trump supporters.
Researchers that study the QAnon
community have hypothesized an accelerated
QAnon membership since the beginning of the
pandemic (Breland & Rangarajan, 2020).
Conspiratorial threads, like the “plandemic” that

asserts COVID-19 was created by Bill Gates and
other elites for population control, are closely
tied to QAnon’s worldview. Our results support
the hypothesis that over the course of the
pandemic, the QAnon community has not only
grown in size, but the QAnon content and
concepts have taken hold in other communities.
Further, our results show that this fringe
ideology has spread to broader, more mainstream
groups.
The QAnon community started as a
fringe group that has notably gained momentum
both in our COVID-19 networks and in real life.
The first “Q” congressional candidate was elected
in Georgia and is favored to win the House seat
(Itkowitz, 2020). QAnon has attracted
mainstream coverage as well (Strauss, 2020; CBS
News, 2020; LaFrance, 2020). In accordance with
these real-world impacts, our time series of maps
illustrate a similar process of QAnon spreading to
the mainstream online, both in network and in
narrative space. Prior to the pandemic, QAnon
was a fringe conspiracy concentrated on the
network periphery of Trump support groups. As
Figure 3 illustrates, the QAnon community was
less than 3% of the conversation around COVID19 in February 2020. By April 2020, this
community comprised almost 5% of the network,
and was composed of increasingly dense clusters
(in February the QAnon group had a heterophily
score of .09 whereas in May scores for QAnon
clusters ranged from 5.57-20.77). At the same
time, there is consistent growth in the number of
documents assigned to the QAnon topic (28) from
12/2019 to 5/2020:

Fig 3. Growth of QAnon Clusters Over Time
Our cultural convergence method
depicted the topics that supported this shift and
the groups that adopted QAnon concepts and

content over time. That process within a few
groups is outlined below.
3.4 QAnon and Right-Wing Groups
All of the network maps in Figure 2 feature
a large US Right-Wing group, indicating that this
group was prominently involved in the
coronavirus conversation. Both these maps
demonstrate what we refer to as mega clusters,
loud online communities with a high rate of
interconnection. This interpretation is supported
by both topical and non-topical bridging
centrality measures. For example, after the
assassination of Iranian major General Qasem
Soleimani in early January, we see US/Iran
Relations (Topic 28) narratives acting as a bridge
between several US Right-Wing communities
(US|CAN|UK Right-Wing in blue above) who use
this topic to connect with each other as well as
with accounts who, in later months, we will see
come together to form distinct QAnon and
conspiracy
theory
communities.
While
documents from these groups make up a relatively
small proportion of all documents within the topic
at first, they become more prevalent over time: the
US/Iran relations topic (Topic 28) becomes the
dominant bridge in numerous and geographically
diverse clusters by mid-March and continues to
hold that spot through mid-April.
We also find that US Right-Wing clusters
converge topically at the same time as US/Iran
becomes more of a bridge: at the start of our
analysis the similarity between the topical
distribution of these clusters is relatively low (for
example, the US Trump|MAGA Support I and
US Trump Black Support|Pro-Trump Alt-media
clusters have a divergence score of 0.3312
during the week of 12/30/2019 indicating minor
overlap). By 3/30/2020, the same clusters have a
divergence score of 0.5697 and by 5/18/2020
their divergence score reaches 0.6986, over
double compared to three months earlier.
Beginning the week of March 16th, we
see QAnon making significant gains in narrative
control of the network, with QAnon related
narratives (i.e. Topic 11) acting as one of the
strongest bridges (maximum bridging centrality
for Topic 11 is 0.4794) between communities
including conspiracy theorists on both the Right

and Left, and the US Right Wing. This persists
throughout the remainder of March and into midlate April, with April being the first month we
see more than one distinct QAnon community
detected in our network maps. Again, this
engagement is supported by the convergence of
Topic 49 over the analysis period. In January
these groups have relatively minor similarities in
their topic distributions (0.3835), though these
similarities become much larger by mid-March
(0.6619) and continue to increase through the
end of the analysis period in mid-May (0.7150).
It is notable that before we are able to
detect distinct QAnon communities through
network mapping, they are already making
connections to more established communities
within the COVID network through this content
area. In terms of overall map volume, the RightWing group was the third largest in the January
map, with 15.9%, and the largest in the February
map, with 22.6%. Overall, since March, Leftleaning and public health clusters gained a
foothold in the conversation. Our results show the
Right-wing groups were pushed to the periphery
of the maps since March and at the same time
subsumed by the fringe QAnon conspiracy.
By the end of April, Hong Kong protest
related narratives (Topic 8) replaced QAnon as
the strongest bridge. However, given that April
and May each have several distinct QAnon
communities, it is possible that QAnon topical
content is being contained within those newly
coalesced communities rather than bridging
formerly distinct communities while Hong Kong
protest related narratives are more culturally
agnostic. This is supported by the lack of
MAGA/US Right Wing clusters in later months
and relational increase in QAnon clusters.
3.5 QAnon and the Alt-News Networks
In the beginning of the pandemic, the
volume of clickbait “news” sites, which tend to
spread unreliable and sensational COVID-19
updates, appeared between January to February
(the group made-up of these accounts and their
followers increased from none in January to close
to 6% of the map in February). During this time
many accounts from the alt-media and
conspiratorial clusters exclusively and constantly

tweeted about coronavirus, some including the
topic in their profile identity markers. This is
mirrored on other platforms, for instance on
Facebook where we saw groups changing their
names to rebrand into COVID-19 centric groups,
while they were previously groups focused on
other political issues. These alternative “news”
accounts are preferred news sources for clusters
that reject “mainstream news.” This sentiment is
reflected in both alt-right and alt-left clusters that
carry anti-establishment and conspiratorial views.
Notably, these two groups also engage with and
share Russian state media, like RT.com,
regularly. In the February map the dedicated
Coronavirus News group (5.8%), which is
composed of accounts that follow these
alternative and often poorly fact-checked media
sources, was almost equivalent in size to the
group of those following official health
information sources (7.4%).
By March, conspiratorial accounts and altright news sources like Zero Hedge and Breitbart
were missing from the top mentions across this
map and were replaced by influential Democrats
such as Bernie Sanders and Alexandria OcasioCortez and left-leaning journalists such as Jake
Tapper and Chris Hayes. In line with the
trajectory of more mainstream voices becoming
engaged in the conversation as the outbreak
progressed, fringe voices became less influential
in our maps over time. These changes could
represent a mainstreaming of coronavirus
conversation, which in turn makes the center of
the map more highly concentrated, or the reduced
share of a consolidated US Right-Wing
community discussing coronavirus online.
Our results show that preference for
QAnon concepts converge on both ends of the
political ideological spectrum. This supports the
“horseshoe theory,” frequently postulated by
political scientists and sociologists, that the
extremes of the political spectrum resemble one

another rather than being polar opposites on a
linear political continuum. In March-May, the
QAnon topic was an important bridge between
alt-left and alt-right clusters (the lowest
divergence being 0.73 on 3/30/20 and 0.50 on
5/18/2020 in the same cluster). The topic
remained a dominating bridge each week across
our maps, suggesting that this bridge is a strong
tie between the alt-left and alt-right groups
independent of the pandemic. The alt-left is often
vocal on anti-government, social justice, and
climate justice topics. From our results we can
also see that QAnon is also a topical bridge
between accounts following alt-left journalists
and environmental and climate science
organizations (0 .77 on 3/30/20 and 0.75 on
5/18/2020). This suggests that while the far-right
is easily drawn to QAnon content because of the
anti-liberal bend, there are other channels, such
climate activism, that act as channels for the
QAnon conspiracy to spread.

4 Conclusion
The multi-modal approach to cultural
convergence helps us better understand the
highly dynamic nature of overlapping
conspiratorial strands. Our findings highlight
that conspiratorial groups are not mutually
exclusive and this approach models some of the
driving forces behind these convergences. The
QAnon case study is a fraction of the results
yielded by this approach and highlights
important insights into cultural and topical
interconnections between online groups. Further
work will explore the glut of results generated by
applying this approach to the ongoing time series
mapping of COVID-19. Other topics, such as a
time series of maps around the recent Black
Lives Matter protests will also be explored.
