Abstract
This paper develops an agent-level simulation model, termed ALPS, for simulating the
spread of an infectious disease in a confined community. The mechanism of transmission
is agent-to-agent contact, using parameters reported for Corona COVID-19 pandemic.
The main goal of the ALPS simulation is analyze effects of preventive measures –
imposition and lifting of lockdown norms – on the rates of infections, fatalities and
recoveries. The model assumptions and choices represent a balance between competing
demands of being realistic and being efficient for real-time inferences. The model
provides quantification of gains in reducing casualties by imposition and maintenance of
restrictive measures in place.
Keywords: COVID-19, Corona virus, lockdown measures, social distancing, agent-level

Introduction

There is a great interest in statistical modeling and analysis of medical, economical and
epidemiological data resulting from current the Covid-19 pandemic. From an
epidemiological perspective, as large amount of infection, containment, and recovery
data from the this pandemic becomes available over time, the community is currently
relying essentially on simulation models to help assess situations and to evaluate
options [1]. Naturally, simulation systems that follow precise mathematical and
statistical models are playing an important role in understanding this dynamic and
complex situation [2]. In this paper we develop a mathematical simulation model,
termed ALPS, to replicate the spread of an infectious disease, such as COVID-19, in a
confined community and to study the influence of some governmental interventions on
final outcomes.
Since ALPS is purely a simulation model, the underlying assumptions and choices of
statistical distributions for random quantities become critical in its success. On one
hand it is important to capture the intricacies the observed phenomena as closely as
possible, using sophisticated modeling tools. On the other hand, it is important to keep
the model efficient and tractable by using simplifying assumptions. One can, of course,
relax these assumptions and obtain more and more realistic models as desired, but at
the cost of increasing computational complexity.
There have been a large models proposed in the literatures relating to the the spread
of epidemics through human contacts or otherwise. They can be broadly categorized in
two main classes (a more detailed taxonomy of simulation models can be found in [3]):
1. Population-Level Coarse Modeling: A large number of epidemiological
models have focused on the population-level variables - counts of infected (I),

susceptible (S), removed or recovered (R), etc. The most popular model of this
type is the Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model [4] proposed by Kermack
and McKendrick in 1927. This model uses ordinary differential equations to model
constrained growth of the counts in these three categories:
dS
dI
dR
= −βI(t)S(t),
= βI(t)S(t) − γI(t),
= γI(t) .
dt
dt
dt
The two parameters β and γ control the dynamics of infections, and the condition
dS
dI
dR
dt + dt + dt = 0 ensures constancy of the community size. A number of other
papers have studied variants of these models and have adapted them for different
epidemics, such as ebola and SARS [5]. While there are spatial versions of SIR
models, they are usually limited in their modeling of spatial dynamics. They
typically use a uniform static grid to represent the spread of infections, from a
location to its neighbors, over time. In general these models do not explicitly
model people dynamics as residents move around in a community. Several recent
simulation models, focusing directly on Covid-19 illness, also rely on such coarser
community level models [6].
2. Agent-Level Modeling: While population-level dynamical evolutions of
population variables are simple and very effective for overall assessment, they do
not take into account any social dynamics, human behavior, government-mandated
restrictions, and complexities of human interactions explicitly. The models that
study these human-level factors and variables , while tracking disease at an
individual level, are called agent-level models [7]. Here one models the mobility,
health status, and interactions of individual subjects (agents) in order to construct
an overall population-level picture in a bottom-up way. The advantages of
agent-based models are that they are more detailed and one can vary the
parameters of restriction measures, such as social distancing, at a granular level to
infer overall outcomes. Agent-based models have been discussed in several papers,
including [3, 8–10] and so on. The importance of simulations based analysis of
epidemic spread is emphasized in [11] but with a focus on infection models within
host. Some aspect of spreading of diseases using network contact is also discussed.
Hunter et al. [10] construct a detailed agent-based model for spread of infectious
diseases, taking into account population demographics and other social conditions,
but they do not consider countermeasures such as lockdowns in their simulations.
A broad organization of different agent-based simulation methods have been
presented in [3]. There are numerous other papers on the topic of agent-based
simulations for simulating spread of infections that are not referenced.
The main distinction of the current paper from the past literature is its focus on
agent-level transmission of infections, and the influence of social dynamics
and lockdown-type restrictions on these transmissions. In this paper we assume a
closed community with the infection started by a single agent at initial time. The
infections are transmitted through physical exposure of susceptible agents to the
infected agents. The infected agents go through a period of sickness with two eventual
outcomes – full recovery for most and death for a small fraction. Once recovered, the
agents can no longer be infected.
The social dynamical model used here is based on fixed domicile, i.e. each agent has
a fixed housing unit. Under unrestricted conditions, or no lockdown, the agents are free
to move over the full domain using a simple motion model. These motions are
independent across agents and encourage smooth paths. Under lockdown conditions,
most of the agents head directly to their housing units and generally stay there during
that period. A very small fraction of agents are allowed to move freely under the
restrictions.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 develops the proposed
agent-level pandemic simulation (ALPS) model, specifying the underlying assumptions
and motivating model choices. It also discusses choices of model parameters and present
a validation using comparisons with the SIR model. Section 3 presents some illustrative
examples and discussed computational complexity of ALPS. The use of ALPS in
understanding influences of countermeasures is presented in Section 4. The paper ends
by discussing model limitations and suggesting some future directions.

Agent-Level Pandemic Simulation (ALPS) Model

In this section we develop our simulation model for agent-level interactions and spread
of the infections across a population in a well-defined geographical domain. In terms of
the model design, there are competing requirements for such a simulation to be useful.
Our main considerations in the design of ALPS are as follows. On one hand, we want to
capture detailed properties of agents and their pertinent environments so as to render a
realistic model of pandemic evolution with or without countermeasures. On the other
hand, we want to keep model complexity reasonably low, in order to utilize it for
analysis under variable conditions and countermeasures. Also, to obtain statistical
summaries of pandemic conditions under different scenarios, we want to run a large
number of simulations and compute averages. This also requires keeping the overall
model tractable from a computational perspective to allow for multiple runs of ALPS in
short time.

2.1

Simplifying Assumptions

The overall setting of the simulation model is the following. We assuming that the
community is based in a square geographical region D with h household units arranged
in a uniformly-spaced square grid. We assume that there are N total agents in the
community and the configuration updates every unit interval (hour) counted by the
variable t. The agents are fully mobile to traverse all of D when unconstrained but are
largely restricted to their home units under restrictions.
Next, we specify the assumptions/models being used at the moment.
• Independent Agents: Each agent (person) has an independent motion model
and independent infection probability. The actual infection event is of course
dependent on being in a close proximity of an infected carrier (within a certain
distance, say ≈ 6 feet) for a certain exposure time. But the probability of an
agent being infected is independent of such events for other persons.
• Full Mobility In Absence of Restrictive Measures: We assume that each
agent is fully mobile and moves across the domain freely when no restrictive
measures are imposed. In other words, there no agents with restricted mobility
due to age or health. Also, we do not impose any day/night schedules on the
motions, we simply follow a fixed motion model at all times. Some papers,
including [12], provide a two- or three-state models where the agents transition
between some stable states (home, workplace, shopping, etc) in a predetermined
manner.
• Homestay During Restrictive Measures: We assume that most agents stay
at home at all times during the restrictive conditions. Only a small percentage
(set as a parameter ρ0 ) of population is allowed to move freely but the large
majority stays at home.

3/15

20

• Sealed Region Boundaries: In order to avoid complications of introducing a
transportation model in the system, we assume that there is no transfer of agents
into and out of the region D. The region is modeled to have reflecting boundaries
to ensure that all the citizens stay with in the region. The only way the
population of D is changed is through death of agent(s).
• Fixed Domicile: The whole community is divided into a certain number of
living units (households/buildings). These units are placed in square blocks with
uniform spacing. Each agent has a fixed domicile at one of the units. During a
lockdown period, the agents proceed to and stay at home with a certain fidelity.
We assume that all agents within a unit are exposed to each other, i.e. they are in
close proximity, and can potentially infect others.
• No Re-Infection: We assume that once a person has recovered from the
diseased then he/she can not be infected again for the remaining observation
period. While this is an important unresolved issue for the current Covid-19
infections, it has been a valid assumption for the past Corona virus infections.
• Single Patient Ground Zero: The infection is introduced in the population
using a single carrier, termed patient ground zero at time t = 0. This patient is
selected randomly from the population and the time variable is indicated related
to this introduction event.
• Constant Immunity Level: The probability of infection of agents, under the
exposure conditions, remains same over time. We do not assume any increase or
decrease in agent immunity over time. Also, we do not assign any age or ethnicity
to the agents and all agents are assumed to have equal immunity levels.

2.2

Model Specifications

There are several parts of the model that require individual specifications. These parts
include a model on dynamics of individual agents (with or without restrictions in place),
the mechanisms of transmitting infections from agent to agents, and the process of
recovery and fatality for infected agents. A full listing of the model parameters and
some typical values are given in Table 1 in the appendix.
• Motion Model: The movement of a subject follows a simple model where the
instantaneous velocity vi (t) is a weighted sum of three components: (1) velocity at
the previous time, i.e. vi (t − 1), (2) a directed component guiding them to their
home, α(hi − xi (t − 1)), and (3) an independent Gaussian increment σwi (t),
wi (t) ∼ N (0, 1). Note that the motions of different agents are kept independent of
each other. The located hi ∈ D denotes the home unit (or stable state) of the ith
person.
Using mathematical notation, the model for instantaneous position xi (t) and
velocity vi (t) of the ith agent are given by:
vi (t)

= µ vi (t − 1) + (1 − µ) α(ht − xi (t − 1)) + σwi (t), 0 ≤ µ ≤ 1 ,

xi (t)

= xi (t − 1) + δvi (t) .

Here α ∈ R+ determines how fast one moves towards their home, and µ quantifies
the degree to which one follows the directive to stay home. If µ = 0, then the
person reaches home and stays there except for the random component wi .
However, if µ = 0.5, then a significant fraction of motion represents continuity
irrespective of the home location. The value µ = 1 implies that either there is not
restriction in place or the person does not follow the directive.

Reflecting Boundary: When a subject reaches boundary of the domain D, the
motion is reflected and the motion continues in the opposite direction.

denote unrestricted movements, red curves denote movement during lockdown, and
green curves denote movement after lockdown.

• Restrictions (or Lockdown) Model: Once the restriction period starts, at
time T0 , all agents are directed towards their homes and asked to stay there. We
assume that ρ% of the subject follow this directive while the others ((100 − ρ)%)
follow a different motion model. The variable ρ changes over time according to:

0, t < T0 (under no restrictions)
ρ(t) =
(1)
ρ0 , t ≥ T0 (under restrictions) .
We note that the people who do not follow restrictions follow the prescribed
motion model with µ = 1.
• Exposure-Infection Model: The event of infection of an agent depends on the
level of exposure to another infected person. This process is controlled by the
following parameters:
– The distance between the subject and the infected person should be less than
r0 .
– The amount of exposure in terms of the number of time units should be at
least τ0 . At the moment we use the cumulative exposure over the whole
history, rather than just the recent history.
– Given that these conditions are satisfied, the probability of catching the
disease at each time t is an independent Bernoulli random variable with
probability pI .
• Recovery-Death Model: Once a subject is infected, we randomly associate the
nature of the illness immediately. Either an infected agent is going to recover
(non-fatal type, or NFT) or the person is eventually going to die (fatal type, or
FT). The probability of having a fatal infection given that a person is infection is
pF .

5/15

20

– Recovery: A subject with a non-fatal type (NFT) is sick for a period of TR
days. After this period, the person can recover at any time according a
Bernoulli random variable with probability pR .
– Fatality: A subject with a fatal type (FT) is sick for a period of TD days.
After this period, the person can die at any time independently according a
Bernoulli random variable with probability pD .

2.3

Chosen Parameter Values

A complete listing of the ALPS model parameters is provided in the Appendix in Table
1. In this section, we motivate the values chosen for those parameters in these
simulations. These values are motivated by the current reports of Corona virus
pandemic.
• We have used a square domain with size 2 miles × 2 miles for a community with
population of N agents. For N = 900, the model represents a population density
of 225 people/mile2 . The community contains h living units (buildings) with a
domicile of N/h people per unit. In case N/h is high, a unit represents a tall
building in metropolitan areas, but when N/h is small, a unit represents a single
family home in a suburban area.
The time unit for updating configurations is one hour and occurrence of major
events is specified in days. For example, the lockdown can start on day 1 and end
on day 60.
• The standard deviation for accelerations in agent mobility are approximately 1-5
feet/hour (fph). Through integration over time, this results in agent speeds up to
1000 fph. We assume that ρ0 = 0.98, i.e. 98% of the people follow the restriction
directives.
• The physical distance between agents to catch infection should at most r0 ≈ 6f t
and the exposure time should be at least τ0 = 5 time units (hours). The
probability pI of getting infected, under the right exposure conditions, is set at 5%
at each time unit (hour) independently.
• Once infected, the probability of having a fatal outcome is set at 5-10%. The time
period of recovery for agents with non-fatal outcomes starts at 7 days. The
probability of reaching full recovery for those agents is pR = 0.001 at each
subsequence time unit (hour). Similarly, for the agents with fatal outcomes, the
period of being infected is set to be 7 days and after that the probability of death
at each time unit (hour) is set to be pD = 0.1.

2.4

Model Validation

Although ALPS is perhaps too simple model to capture intricate dynamics of an active
society, it does provide an efficient tool for analyzing effects of countermeasures during
the spread of a pandemic. Before it can be used in practice, there is an important need
to validate it in some way.
As described in [3], there are several ways to validate a simulation model. One is to
use real data (an observed census of infections over time) in a community to estimate
model parameters, followed by a statistical model testing. While such data may emerge
for Covid-19 for public use in the future (especially with the advent of tracking apps
being deployed in many countries), there is currently no such agent-level data available
for Covid-19. The other approach for validation is to consider coarse population-level

variables and their dynamics, and compare them against established models such as SIR
and its variations. We take this latter approach.
Fig. 2 shows plots of the evolutions of global infection counts (susceptible, infection,
recovered) in a community under the well-known SIR model (on the left) and the
proposed ALPS model (on the right). In the ALPS model the counts for recovered and
fatalities are kept separate, while in SIR model these two categories are combined. One
can see a remarkable similarity in the shapes of corresponding curves and this provides
a certain validation to the ALPS model. In fact, given the dynamical models of
agent-level mobility and infections, one can in principle derive parameters of the
population-level differential equations used in the SIR model. We have left that out for
future developments.

Exemplar Scenarios & Computational Complexity

We illustrate the use of ALPS model by showing its outcomes under a few typical
scenarios. Further, we discuss the computational cost of running ALPS on a regular
laptop computer.

3.1

Examples from ALPS

We start by showing outputs of ALPS under some interesting settings. In these
examples, we use a relatively small number of agents (N = 900) and household units
(h = 9), with T = 100days, in order to improve visibility of displays.
1. Example 1 – No Restrictive Measures:
Fig. 3 shows a sequence of temporal snapshots representing thecommunity at
different times over the observation period. In this example, the population is
fully mobile over the observation period and no social distancing restrictions are
imposed. The snapshots show the situations at 10, 20, 50, and 100 days. The
corresponding time evolution of global count measures is shown in the bottom
right panel. The infection starts to spread rapidly around the 10th day and
reaches a peak infection level of 81% around day 35. Then the recovery starts and
continues until very few infected people are left. In this simulation, the number of
fatalities is found to be 11%.
2. Example 2 – Early Restrictions:
In the second example, the restrictions are introduced on day 5 after the infection
and these measures stay in place after that. The results are shown in Fig. 4. The
top left panel shows the situation on day 2 where the population is full mobile and

the infection has not started spreading yet. The situation on day 6 shows infection
beginning to spread around agent zero and early signs of clustering of agents
around their domicile units. The scene for day 10 shows progression of lockdown
with most agents (98%) getting close to their domicile units and the infection
being carried to some units by their resident agents. By day 20, the concentration
of agents in their units is complete and only a few (2%) agents are allowed free
mobility.
The bottom right panel shows temporal evolutions of the population-level infection
counts: susceptible (blue curve), infected (red), recovered (green), and deceased
(magenta). As the picture shows, the infections start growing initially but the
gains of lockdown measures start appearing around day 15 – it takes about 10-12
for the restrictions to show results. The subsequent bumps in the infected counts
is due to the new infections transmitted by roaming agents. In this run of ALPS,
we see an overall fatality rate of 3% and an uninfected population size of 67%.
3. Example 3: Early Imposition and Then Removal of Restrictions :
In this example, with results shown in Fig. 5, the restrictions are introduced on
day 5 after the infection and lifted on day 30. So the restriction period of 25 days
is surrounded by unrestricted mobility on both sides. As the plot of global
variables indicate, the early restriction helps reduce the infection rates but these
gains are lost soon after lifting of the restrictions. The percentage of infected
people goes back up and the rate of fatalities resemble the unrestricted situation
in Example 1.

3.2

Computational Complexity

Since computational efficiency of the simulator is of vital important, we next study the
computational cost of running ALPS for different variable sizes. In these experiments,

we note the time taken by ALPS code on a McBook Pro laptop with Intel 2.8 GHz Core

From these results we are see that the computational cost is linear in T with slope 1.
For a change in N the number of agents, while keeping other variables fixed, the change
in the computational cost is linear also. However, the rate of change is 2 for smaller
values but increases to 4 for the larger values. The changes in computational cost due to
changes in the number of households, with other variables held fixed, are minimal.

Analyzing Lockdown Measures

There are several ways to utilize this model for prediction, planning and decision
making. We illustrate some of these ideas using examples. At first we show individual
simulations under different scenarios and then present results on average behavior
obtained using hundreds of simulations. In these illustrations, we have used N = 972
agents and h = 81 households.

Fig 5. Example 3: Model outputs when the restrictive measures are imposed on day 5
and removed on day 30.

Effect of Timing of Imposition of Restrictions: Fig. 6 shows some examples of
ALPS outputs when a lockdown is imposed on the community but at different times.
From top-left to bottom-right, the plots show lockdowns starting on day 1, day 5, day
10, and day 20, respectively. Once the restrictions are imposed, they are not removed in
these examples. The best results are obtained for the earliest imposition of restrictions.
In the top-left case, the peak infection rises to 22% of the community, on day 18, and
then comes down steadily. The fraction of fatalities is 2% and the fraction of community
never infected is 77%. In case the restrictions are imposed on day 5, and all other
parameters held same, there is a small change in the situation. The peak infection rises
to 55%, the fatalities increase to 7% and the fraction of uninfected goes down to 40%.
We can see that an early imposition of lockdown measures also helps reduce peak
infection rates in the community.
Sometimes we notice a saw-tooth shape in the curve for infected people. This implies
that the even the small portion of mobile agents can break through and spread infections
at other home units despite full restrictions being in place. This saw-tooth shape
underscores the need for severely limiting mobility. Even a small fraction of population
being mobile can spread infections to the immobile agents and cause infections.
The bottom two panels in Fig. 6 show results for a delayed lockdown, with the
restrictions being imposed on day 20 and day 30. One can see that the peak infection
rate becomes quite high (82-84%) and casualties mount to 10-11%. The fraction of
uninfected population falls to 0% in these cases. This shows that, under the chosen
parameter settings, day 20 is quite late in imposing lockdown conditions on the
community, and the results are very similar to any later imposition. If the restrictions
are imposed after 15-20 days, then there are no uninfected people left in the community
in a typical run of ALPS.
Effect of Timing of Removal of Restrictions: In the next set of simulations, we
study the effects of lifting restrictions and thus re-allowing full mobility in the
community. Some sample results are shown in Fig. 7. Each plot shows the evolution for
a different starting time T0 and the end time T1 . As these plots indicate, the gains

made by early imposition of restrictions are nullified when the restrictions are lifted. In
all cases, after the lifting of restrictions, the full population gets infected eventually.
Since we do no assume any change in the immunity levels of the agents over time, the
results from lifting of restrictions are similar to not imposing any restrictions in the first
place. The results appear to be same except for being shifted in time.
Statistical Summaries:
In the next set of experiments, we compute average values of some variables of
interest using multiple (= 100) runs of ALPS. In the first result, we study three
variables – number of deaths, number of people remaining uninfected, and the peak
infection rate – using N = 200 agents living in a community of h = 25 households,
observed over [0, 150] days. The top left panel of Fig. 8 shows an example of the
configuration with 25 households and 200 agents in the community. We vary the start
time T0 (start day of restrictions) from 1 to 30 and then to 150 and study the resulting
outcomes using 100 runes of ALPS. (The value of T0 = 150 implies that the restrictions
are never imposed in that setting.) The remaining panels in Fig. 8 show box plots of the
three variables changing with T0 .
• Death Rate: Top right shows the percentage fatalities increasing from around
1% to almost 11% as T0 changes from 1 to 30. the largest rate of increase is
observed when T0 is between 10 to 30 days.
• Number of Uninfected: In the bottom left panel we see a decrease in the
number of uninfected population from around 90% to 0% as T0 increases. In case
the restrictions are not imposed in first 30 days after the first infection, there is no
agent left uninfected in the community.
• Peak Infection Rate: In case the restrictions are imposed on the first day after
the infection, the peak infection rate is contained to be 10%. As T0 is increased
and the restrictions are delayed the peak infection rate rises to almost 80% of the
community.
In Fig. 9 we study the effect of changing T1 while T0 = 1 is kept fixed (and other
experimental conditions being same as in the last experiment). The results show that
there is no difference in the eventual number of deaths and the peak infection rates
when T1 is changed from 10 to 40. This is because agent immunity and other infection

results from unrestricted conditions, irrespective of T1 .

Discussion
The strengths and limitations of ALPS model are the following. ALPS provides an
efficient yet comprehensive modeling of the spread of infections in a self-contained
community, using simple model assumptions. The model can prove very useful in
evaluating costs and effects of imposing social lockdown measures in a society.
In the current version, the initial placement of agents is set to be normally
distributed with means given by their home units and fixed variance. This variance is
kept large to allow for near arbitrary placements of agents in the community. In
practice, however, agents typically follow semi-rigid daily schedules of being at work,
performing chores, or being at home. Thus, at the time of imposition of a lockdown, the
agents can be better placed in the scenes according to their regular schedules rather
than being placed arbitrarily.
In terms of future directions, there are many ways to develop this simulation model
to capture more realistic scenarios: (1) It is possible to model multiple, interactive
communities instead of a single isolated community. (2) One can include typical daily
schedules for agents in the simulations. A typical agent may leave home in the morning,
spent time in the office during the day, and return to home in the evening. (3) It is
possible to provide an age demographics to the community and assign immunity to
agents according to their demographic labels [13]. (4) As more data becomes available
in the future, one can change immunity levels of agents over time according to the
spread and seasons. (5) In practice, when an agent is infected, he/she goes through
different stages of the disease, associated with varying degrees of mobility [9]. One can
introduce an additional variable to track these stages of infections in the model and
change agent mobility accordingly.

Conclusion
This paper develops an agent-based simulation model, called ALPS, for modeling spread
of an infectious disease in a closed community. A number of simplifying and reasonable
assumptions makes the ALPS efficient and effective for statistical analysis. The model
is validated at a population level by comparing with the popular SIR model in
epidemiology. These results indicate that: (1) Early imposition of lockdown measures
(right after the first infection) significantly reduce infection rates and fatalities; (2)

13/15

Lifting of lockdown measures recommences the spread of the disease and the infections
eventually reach the same level as the unrestricted community; (3) In absence of any
extraneous solutions (a medical treatment/cure, a weakening mutation of the virus, or a
natural development of agent immunity), the only viable option for preventing large
infections is the judicious use of lockdown measures.
