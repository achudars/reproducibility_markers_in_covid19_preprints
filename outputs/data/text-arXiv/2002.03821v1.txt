Abstract. Since the end of 2019 an outbreak of a new strain of coronavirus,
called 2019–nCoV, is reported from China and later other parts of the world.
Since January 21, WHO reports daily data on confirmed cases and deaths from
both China and other countries [1]. In this work we present some discrete and
continuous models to discribe the disease dynamics in China and estimate
the needed epidemiological parameters. Good agreement with the current
dynamics has be found for both a discrete transmission model and a slightly
modified SIR–model.
Keywords: Coronavirus 2019-nCoV, Epidemiology, Disease dynamics.

1. Introduction
In December 2019, first cases of a novel pneumonia of unknown cause were
reported from Wuhan, the seventh–largest city in China. In the meantime, these
cases have been identified as infections with a novel strain of coronavirus, called
2019–nCoV. Its genome sequence turned out to be 75– to 80–percent identical to
the SARS–coronavirus, that caused a major outbreak in Asai in 2003. At the
beginning of January 2020, the virus spread over mainland China and reached
other provinces. Increased travel activities due to the Chinese new year festivities
supported the expansion of the infection. By mid of January, China reported
a sharp rise in cases with about 150 new patients. From January 21 onwards,
WHO’s daily situation reports contain the latest figures on confirmed cases and
deaths, see [1]. Our work is based on these data for the mainland of China. The
National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China also provides daily
reports [2], however this website is only available in Chinese and hence we did not
use it for our analysis. By Yk we denote the cumulated Corona cases in mainland
China on day k, where k = 0 corresponds to beginning of the data recordings on
January, 21. In Figure 1 we show the data until February, 9 in a semi–logarithmic
plot. The new cases Nk := Yk − Yk−1 are also given. The data for other countries
than China is not included in our first modeling approach.

2. Discrete Infection Models
Assuming, that the number of daily new infections is directly proportional to
the total number of currently infected leads to a discrete exponential model
(Exp)

exp
yk+1
= ykexp + rykexp = (1 + r)k+1 y0

To estimate the infection growth rate r and the initial infected population y0 at
day k = 0 (i.e. Jan, 21), we use a least–squares fit to the observed data (k, Yk ) for
k = 0, . . . n with n = 15 in a logarithmic version. We obtain the estimates
r̂ ≃ 0.304
yˆ0 ≃ 451
The coefficient of determination (in statistics usually called the R2 –value) of this
fit is given by
R2 = 0.9484
In Figure 2 we visualize the exponential model (Exp) in comparison to the data.
Although, the R2 –value is quite large, the observed behavior is far from being
purely exponential. Especially in the last days, the disease dynamics has been
slowing down. This is also reflected in the decreasing number of new cases, see
Fig. 1. The exponential model is over–estimating the number of infected cases.
This can be seen as well, when plotting the infected cases on the next day Yk+1
vs. the infected cases today Yk in a double logarithmic plot, see. Figure 3. In case
of the exponential model (Exp), we get
ln yk+1 = ln yk + ln(1 + r)

a straight line of slope 1 in the double log–plot. However, the real data reveals a
slightly smaller increase. Therefore, we may generalize the model to
gen
yk+1
= (1 + c)(ykgen )β

(Gen)
or in the logarithmic version

gen
ln yk+1
= β ln ykgen + ln(1 + c)

The parameters β and c can again be estimated from a least squares fit and we
obtain
(1)

β̂ = 0.904 and ĉ = 2.02 .

In this fit, we have excluded the first data point (ln Y1 , ln Y2 ) as an outlier, cf.
Fig. 3. A value of β < 1 models an increase in the number of infected cases, that
is below that standard exponential model (Exp) and that is in accordance with the
reported data.
Another possible extension of the exponential model takes into account the effect
of awareness in the population. From a purely heuristic point of view, one can
describe this by a nonlinear relation between the number of new infections yk+1 −yk
and the current cases yk , e.g.
(NonLin)

nl
yk+1
− yknl = ρ(yknl )α

For α = 1, we recover the simple exponential model (Exp). For exponents α < 1,
the number of new–infections is reduced for high infection numbers to account for
possible awareness in the population.
For the given data (again excluding the first data point as an outlier), we perform
a least squares fit to the double logarithmic plot (see Fig. 5) of the current cases
yk vs. the new infections nk . This yields the parameter estimates
ρ̂ = 10.1321 and α̂ = 0.5794

with an R2 –value of 0.9287. Including the first data point (see dashed line in
Figure 4) yields a fit with a smaller R2 –value of 0.8011 showing a lower quality of
the fit. Moreover, in this case, we would again drastically over–estimate the current
behavior. Figure 4 again shows the reduction of new infections in the last days.
The last three data points significantly deviate from the previous behavior which
can be described rather well by the nonlinear model.
In Figure 5 we show the prediction based on the generalized model (Gen)(green
curve) and the nonlinear model (NonLin) (blue curve) compared to the observed
data. The two models are extended 10 days beyond the current date to show their
predictions. On the time interval, where data is available, both models yield very
similar estimates, but for future predictions, the generalized exponential model
shows significantly lower case numbers. Based on the reduced number of new
infection in the last days, it seems that the generalized model (Gen) is better
suited to describe the future disease dynamics.

3. SIR–Model
In contrast to the above discrete models, we analyze in the sequel shortly a
standard–SIR model. The total population equals to a reservoir of mainland China
with N = 1.4 · 109 inhabitants. The export of the disease to other countries is
not taken into account. Due to the short time horizon of not more than 1 month,
effects of birth and natural death are excluded form the model. The time scale is
measured in days, the recovery rates is assumed to be σ = 14−1 implying a recovery
period of 14 days.
Let I and R denote the currently infected and recovered individuals. The susceptible individuals are given by S = N − I − R. The standard SIR–model without

The blue line shows the linear relation using a constant disease
induced death rate µ.
where µ denoted the disease inducedRmortality rate. In addition, we introduce the

The cumulated number of deaths equals

where Zk , Yk denotes the cumulated observed death or infected cases at day k,
see Figure 6. Based on the given date we obtain an estimated mortality rate
µ̂ = 2.09%. As can be seen from the graph, the assumption of a constant disease
induced death rate shows rather good agreement with the given data.
Using the above estimated death rate of approx. 2%, we solve the SIR–model (??)
and compare its results for the cumulated infection cases C to the reported data.
In a first simulation, we use a constant force of infection θ. Using a least–squares
fit, we can estimate its value θ̂ form the observed data. However, during the corse
of the disease, quarantine measures have been take to reduce the spread of the
disease. In the SIR–model, such quarantine measures lead to a reduction in the
force of infection. Therefore, we have also simulated a second model, where the
force of infection is assume to be piecewise–constant
(
θ1 for t < ts
θ(t) =
θ2 for t ≥ ts
where ts denotes the switching time. Again, we have performed a least–squares fit
to estimate θ1 , θ2 and ts based on the reported data. The fit is based on minimizing
