Abstract
Contact Tracing (CT) is one of the measures taken by government and health
officials to mitigate the spread of the novel coronavirus. In this paper, we investigate its efficacy by developing a compartmental model for assessing its impact
on mitigating the spread of the virus. We describe the impact on the reproduction number R0 of COVID-19. In particular, we discuss the importance
and relevance of parameters of the model such as the number of reported cases,
effectiveness of tracking and monitoring policy, and the transmission rates to
contact tracing. We describe the terms “perfect tracking”, “perfect monitoring”
and “perfect reporting” to indicate that traced contacts will be tracked while
incubating, tracked contacts are efficiently monitored so that they do not cause
secondary infections, and all infected persons are reported, respectively. We
consider three special scenarios: (1) perfect monitoring and perfect tracking of
contacts of a reported case, (2) perfect reporting of cases and perfect monitoring of tracked reported cases and (3) perfect reporting and perfect tracking of
contacts of reported cases. Furthermore, we gave a lower bound on the proportion of contacts to be traced to ensure that the effective reproduction, Rc , is
below one and describe Rc in terms of observable quantities such as the proportion of reported and traced cases. Model simulations using the COVID-19 data
obtained from John Hopkins University for some selected states in the US suggest that even late intervention of CT may reasonably reduce the transmission
of COVID-19 and reduce peak hospitalizations and deaths. In particular, our
findings suggest that effective monitoring policy of tracked cases and tracking of
traced contacts while incubating are more crucial than tracing more contacts.
The use of CT coupled with other measures such as social distancing, use of face
mask, self-isolation or quarantine and lockdowns will greatly reduce the spread
of the epidemic as well as peak hospitalizations and total deaths.

1. Introduction
Infectious diseases are often spread via direct and indirect contacts such as
person-to-person contact, droplets spread, airborne transmissions and so on.
Several studies [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] have shown that the novel coronavirus infection spread through these means. Several measures which include social distancing, lockdowns, self-isolation/quarantine, use of face-masks, contact tracing
amongst others, have been enforced by authorities in reducing the spread of the
virus. In any disease outbreak therefore, contact tracing is an important tool
for combating the spread of the outbreak. Contact tracing (CT) is the process
whereby persons who have come in contact with an infected person are traced
and monitored so that if they become symptomatic they can be efficiently isolated to reduce transmissions. Previous outbreaks of infectious diseases have
been rapidly controlled with contact tracing and isolation, for example, the
Ebola outbreak in West Africa in 2014, see [9]. Furthermore, in any disease
control it is important to evaluate the efficacy of intervention strategies such as
contact tracing. Thus, the need to explicitly measure how contact tracing can
help in mitigating the transmission of coronavirus cannot be over-emphasized.
A lot of studies have been conducted on the efficacy of contact tracing in relation to some diseases in the past, see [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16].
Several mathematical models have been proposed for the dynamics of the novel
coronavirus, see for example [17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25] and several models have incorporated contact tracing using stochastic modeling approach [26]
and networks [27]. However, these studies did not include the effect of contact
tracing on the reproduction number of COVID-19 and the expression of this reproduction number in terms of observable quantities, a quick and efficient way
of estimating the reproduction number. In 2015, Browne et al. [16] developed a
deterministic model of contact tracing for Ebola epidemics which links tracing
back to transmissions, and incorporates disease traits and control together with
monitoring protocols. Eikenberry et al. [22] examined the potential of face mask
use by general public to curtail the COVID-19 epidemic. Their findings suggest
that face mask should be adopted nation-wide and be implemented without delay, even if most masks are homemade and of relatively low quality. Motivated
essentially by the works of [16] and [22], the goal in this work is to develop a
deterministic model to measure the efficacy of contact tracing in mitigating the
spread of COVID-19. As noted in [16], explicitly incorporating contact tracing with disease dynamics presents challenges, and population level effects of
contact tracing are difficult to determine. Here, we propose a compartmental
model which incorporates the disease traits and monitoring protocols. We describe the impact on the reproduction number R0 of COVID-19 and discuss the
importance and relevance of parameters of the model.
Anomalous and memory dependent behaviors observed in some physical phenomena have been studied using fractional-order derivatives models [28, 29, 30,
31] because of their memory formalism which takes care of history and hereditary
2

properties. This has motivated researchers to develop compartmental models
using fractional-order derivatives for understanding the dynamics of disease outbreaks [32, 33, 34] . In particular, we develop a time-fractional compartmental
model; a modification of the SEIR model similar to the one given in [22] where
they divided the infected population into symptomatic and asymptomatic compartments. The remaining sections are organized as follows: In section 2, we
begin with a discussion on the basic SEIR model and used this as a building
block in deriving the new model with contact tracing. Thereafter, we consider
special cases of the model and calculate their effective reproduction numbers.
Furthermore, we gave a lower bound on the proportion of reported cases that
must be traced to ensure the reproduction number is below one and express the
reproduction number in terms of observable quantities such as average number
of secondary infected persons per traced and untraced reported case. In section
3, we perform several numerical experiments to corroborate our theoretical observations in Section 2. Finally, in section 4, we gave a comprehensive discussion
on the impact of contact tracing in mitigating the spread of the virus.
2. Model Formulation
2.1. Initial Model
We begin with a basic time-fractional SEIR model consisting of four compartments that represents the susceptible (S), exposed (E), infected (I), recovered
(R). We assumed that all the infected individuals are unreported and thus not
hospitalized. The following system of differential equations models the transmission dynamics of the population:
SI
N
SI
α
− σE
0 Dt E(t) = β0
N
α
0 Dt I(t) = σE − γI
α
0 Dt S(t)

= −β0

α
0 Dt R(t)

= γI

where β0 is the disease transmission rate, σ ( 1/σ) is the transition rate (disease
incubation period) from the exposed class to the infectious class, γ (1/γ) is the
recovery rate (time from infectiousness until recovery) of an infected individual.
We note that the parameters of the model are non-negative and have dimensions
given by 1/timeα . This observation was originally noted in Diethelm [32]. To
alleviate this difference in dimensions, we replace the parameters with a power
α of new parameters to obtain the new system of equations:
SI

2.2. Preliminary Model
The next step in the development of our model is the incorporation of hospitalized compartments (H) and splitting of the infected cases into reported (R)
and unreported cases (U). This is necessary as published studies [17, 35, 22] have
shown that a considerable number of infected cases go unreported either due
to unawareness or early recovery or just perceptions of the infected individuals.
We note that only the reported cases are being hospitalized during the infectious
period and neglect the possibility of transmission of an hospitalized individual
since they are not exposed to the general population. Furthermore, we introduce a time-dependent transmission rate which is a function of the number of
deaths (the severity of the epidemic). Thus, we obtain the following system of
time-fractional differential equations:

account effects of governmental actions with κ1 being the strength and κ2 being
the severity of responds by the government. This is modelled as a step function
that links the contacts among individuals as a proportion of death, that is, the
severity of the epidemic. γR , γU , and γH are the recovery rates of a reported,
unreported and hospitalized individuals, respectively. ϕR is the hospitalization
rate of reported infected person and µH is the disease-induced death rate.
2.3. Epidemiological parameters of the model
For simplicity, we shall use prior studies to fix several parameters and fit
the other parameters of the model. In particular, we shall fit the parameters
4

β0 , κ1 , µH and α using the COVID-19 data obtained from John Hopkins University [36] for some selected states in the US. The inclusion of µH in the fitting parameters stems from the fact that different states have different hospitalization
and death rates. Prior modeling studies suggest that the effective transmission
rate β0 ranges between 0.5-1.5 day−1 [37, 38, 39, 22] and the incubation period
lies in the range between 2–9 days [40, 21, 41, 18]. The average of 5.1 days was
estimated by Lauer et al. [42]. The infectious duration seems to have agreeing
values of around 7 days for several modeling studies [37, 17, 22, 23, 43, 44].
Lachmann et al. [45] and Li et al. [46] estimated that around 88% and 86%,
respectively, of all infections are undocumented with a 95% credible interval.
Maugeri et al. [47] estimated that the proportion of unreported new infections
by day ranged from 52.1% to 100% with a total of 91.8% of infections going
unreported. Table 1 gives a summary of these values and the default values
used in our model simulation.

2.4. Final Model Incorporating Contact Tracing
We incorporate CT into the preliminary model by linking the dynamics of
disease model with actions of contact tracers such as monitoring and tracking.
This general modeling framework is similar to a variety of CT models employed
in [10, 15, 16]. At first, we describe the four steps of CT for COVID-19 as
described by the Center for Disease Control (CDC) [50]. The Public health
officer tries to identify contacts (contact investigation) by working with infected
patients to help recall people they’ve been in contact with while being infectious.
The second step (contact tracing) involves notifying and tracing of recorded
contacts of the patient. Next (contact support), the officer informs and educates
the contacts on the risk and dangers of being exposed. They also provide support
on the next line of action for the contacts. In the case that a contact is already
showing symptoms, the tracers will call an ambulance to remove/isolate the
contact. Lastly (contact self-quarantine), contacts are encouraged to quarantine

for a minimum of 14 days in case they also become ill.
To model the described process, we further make the following assumptions:
(a) Only cases that are reported or hospitalized can trigger contact tracing
(b) If a traced contact is tracked being infectious, they are immediately isolated, otherwise they are monitored for symptoms and possible isolation
if symptoms develop.
(c) We introduce parameters ρ1 and ρ2 that determine the probability or
fraction of first or higher order traced contacts who will be incubating and
infectious, respectively, when tracked. We simplify the model by assuming
that ρ1 = ρ2 = ρ.
Furthermore, we introduce a parameter βM such that 0 ≤ βM ≤ β0 to control
the efficacy of monitoring policy of contact tracers and health officers and  to
denote the fraction of reported cases that will be traced. With these new parameters and assumptions, we have the following system of differential equations:

cumulative total cases (both unreported and reported cases whose contacts are
not being traced), cumulative cases of traced persons who will be tracked while
incubating, cumulative cases of traced persons who are infectious when tracked
and the resulting cumulative deaths from the impact of CT. We shall consider
the following three special cases:
2.4.1. Perfect Monitoring and Tracking
In this case, we assume that the tracked and monitored contacts do not cause
secondary infections, in which case βM = 0 and that all traced contacts will be
tracked while incubating, that is, ρ = 1. The effective reproduction number, Rc
(see Appendix B), is given as


γα
Rc = R0 η α U α (1 − ) + (1 − η) ,
γR + ϕR
where R0 = β(t)/γU is the basic reproduction number of the initial model (no
contact tracing or hospitalization of cases). Thus, the contact tracing effort
required to ensure that the effective reproduction number is below one is:



Rc < 1 ⇔ η 1 − α U α (1 − ) > 1 −

In the special case where we have high hospitalization rate and low recovery
rates (see Table 1) such that γUα = γRα = ϕα
, then

R0
where 0.5η (1+) is the critical proportion of the total cases which must be traced
in order for Rc < 1. Another special case is when we have low hospitalization
rate and high recovery rates such that γUα = γRα + ϕα
, then

This indicates that a larger proportion of reported cases will be traced in the
former (special) case with high hospitalization and low recovery rates than the
latter one with low hospitalization and high recovery rates. Now, let’s rewrite 
as

and let the transmission rate β(t) be written as β(t) = p c(t), where p is the
probability of transmission per contact and c(t) is the contact rate. For an

Using the formulas (4) and (5) for κ and s, respectively, we obtain the formula


1−s
Rc < κ

s
where R∗c is the product of the average number of the secondary infected traced
contacts per untraced reported case and the odds that a reported case is not
a traced contact. For 100% reporting, s = κ/(κ + m) which implies that a
reported case causes κ + m secondary infections where κ (or m) of these cases
are traced (or untraced). Thus, R∗c = m which is the fraction of secondary
infected contacts to be traced that are not yet tracked.
2.4.2. Perfect Reporting and Tracking (Imperfect Monitoring)
Here, we consider the case where each traced contact is tracked during the
incubation stage and all infected individuals are reported. This implies that
η = ρ = 1. The reproduction number in the absence of CT is given as R0 =
β(t)/(γRα + ϕα
), see Appendix A. In a similar manner, the reproduction number
R
α
α
of contact traced (monitored) person is RM = βM
/γM
. Then θ1 = RM /R0 is
the reduction in secondary cases of a traced (monitored) person compared to
an untraced person. Thus, Rc = (1 − )R0 +  RM and the proportion of cases
to be traced so that Rc is below one is



R0
Using CT observables, we describe Rc by defining κ =  R0 and κM =  RM
as the average number of traced infected secondary cases per primary reported
untraced and traced infected, respectively, with s given as s = , then

2.4.3. Perfect Reporting and Monitoring (Imperfect Tracking)
Lastly, we consider perfect reporting and monitoring with secondary traced
individual during the incubation stage ( or infectious stage) with probability ρ
(or (1 − ρ)). This implies that βM = 0 and η = 1. The reproduction number
α
in the absence of CT is R0 = β(t)/(γM
+ ϕα
R ) and the reproduction number
of contact traced individual who are incubating or infectious when tracked is
RT = β(t)(1 − ρ)/(γTα + ϕα
). Thus, θ2 = RT /R0 is the reduction in secondary
T
cases of a traced individual (who will be infectious or incubating when tracked)
compared to an untraced reported case. Thus, the effective reproduction number
Rc reduces to Rc = (1 − )R0 +  RT . As in the previous cases, the critical
proportion of total cases which is to be traced for Rc < 1 is

To describe the reproduction number in terms of CT observables, we let κT =

3. Simulation Experiments and results
3.1. Methods and Model fitting
We use the infected and cumulative mortality data compiled by the Center
for Systems and Science Engineering at John Hopkins University (2020) [36]
starting from the day of the first record of infection with two intermediate days
for the first 200 days (the parameters are adjusted accordingly) in a given state
to calibrate the parameter set (β0 , κ1 , µ, α) and the initial condition E0 . The
other initial conditions are fixed, for example, IR0 is matched with the first
recorded case, IU 0 = (0.65/0.35)IR0 since 65% of the cases are taken to be unreported and the rest are set to zero. The remaining parameters in the model
are fixed at default values given in Table 1. Parameter fittings were performed
using a nonlinear least squares algorithm in python with the limited memory
BFGS method. One main benefit of the routine is the use of bounds for fit parameters. This allows faster convergence of the algorithm and ensures obtaining
meaningful fit parameters. The fitted parameters and their standard errors are
given in Table 2. A comparison of the fractional-order model with its corresponding integer-order model is given in table 3 for California and Washington.
We have excluded the states of Tennessee and Texas because their models are
simply integer-order models as shown in table 2 where α ≈ 1. All numerical
simulations were done with our numerical scheme [51] from which we obtain the
solution of the proposed model at each time step as

3.2. CT in Simulated Model with Perfect Tracking and Monitoring
We note that the dynamics of the model for Tennessee and Texas are quite
similar and results to an integer-order model, that α ≈ 1 (see table 2 and fig. 1).
Thus, we consider results for Texas and Washington which have similar results
with Tennessee and California, respectively in the following sections.
3.2.1. Immediate CT Adoption with Perfect Tracking and Monitoring
We run the simulated model with βM = 0 and ρ = 1 for around 20 months
under constant conditions while studying the effect of the number of traced
reported cases on the number of infected, hospitalized and dead. Fig. 2 shows
that the total mortality (as well as infected and hospitalized) increases with
no contact traced individual ( = 0) and decreases with increased number of
traced reported cases. Furthermore, we simulate the model with several values
in  × η, η,  ∈ [0, 1] to observe the effect of reporting and tracing on the
model. The outcome of interest is total mortality, peak hospitalization and
13

peak infected which are normalized against their respective maximum and the
results are presented in Fig. 3. The results in this figure show that while high
reporting rate is crucial for mitigating the spread of the epidemic, the percentage
of traced reported cases have a more substantial effect on the spread. The results
for Texas are expected since the mortality and hospitalized cases will be more
with more reporting and no tracing. The results for Washington shows that a
moderately high (and not very high) reporting rate gives peak hospitalizations
and mortality. This may be attributed to the dynamics of the fitted model for
Washington where the number of infected individuals have been lowered after
some months. Using the formula given in eqn. 5, we estimate the number of
reported cases which will be traced. The results are presented in fig. 4. A contour
plot of the reproduction number Rc as a function of fraction of the infected
population reported and proportion of exposed individuals that is traced is
shown in fig. 5. The figure shows that if at least 60% (40%) contacts of reported
cases (with perfect reporting) are traced or at least 70% (65%) of total cases
are reported where all their contacts are traced in Texas (Washington), then
disease elimination is feasible.

reported cases in a perfect tracking and monitoring case. The first (second) row is for Texas
(Washington) State.

3.2.2. CT Intervention after delay
We run the simulated CT epidemics by assuming that CT was only introduced after some discrete time delay (20, 60 and 100 days). The fraction of
14

Figure 3: Relative peak infected, hospitalizations and total mortality simulated epidemics

State.

reported cases traced was fixed at 50%. We observe, in fig. 6, that the intervention of CT reduces the number of infected, hospitalization and mortality even
with a late intervention time (100 days). In Washington where the number of
infected and hospitalized seems to be growing rapidly, we observe that the CT
intervention drastically reduces these numbers and would be very efficient in
reducing the spread of the virus in such states.
3.2.3. Perfect Reporting and Tracking
We run the simulated CT model with ρ = η = 1 where CT was immediately
introduced. The fraction of reported cases traced was fixed at 50%. We examine
the effect of monitoring policy on the number of infected, hospitalizations and
mortality. Fig. 7 shows that 50% effective monitoring policy reduces the hospitalization and total mortality to less than a quarter of its value. Furthermore,
we run several simulations with values in  × βM , , βM ∈ [0, 1] and the results
are shown in fig. 8. Similar to previous contour plots, the outcome of interests
are relative peak hospitalization and total mortality. We observe that the results are quite surprising. The peak hospitalizations and cumulative mortality
occur when βM ≈ β0 and the fraction of traced reported cases is around 20-80%
where we would have expected this to be around 0-20%. This shows that, in

a function of proportion of reported cases (η). The second column shows contour plots of the
control of reproduction number as a function of proportion of reported cases (η) and traced

general, the monitoring policy has a greater effect in reducing the peak values
than the fraction of traced reported cases. A contour plot of the reproduction
number Rc as a function of the monitoring efficacy and proportion of exposed
individuals that is traced is shown in fig. 9. The figure shows that the disease
will die out if traced individuals are being monitored so that they are at least
one-third as infectious as an unmonitored or untraced infected case with all
contacts of reported cases being traced or with at least 60% (40%) of reported
cases being traced with a perfect monitoring policy in Texas (Washington).
3.2.4. Perfect Reporting and Monitoring
In this case, we consider the numerical experiment where we assume that
every infected case is reported (η = 1) and tracked contacts of reported cases are
effectively monitored (βM = 0) so that they do not cause secondary infections.
16

Figure 6: CT Intervention after some discrete time delay. First (second) row is for Texas
(Washington) State.

We run the simulated CT model under constant conditions with the aim of
exploring the effect of ρ (the fraction or probability that a traced reported case is
incubating when tracked) on peak hospitalization and mortality. Unsurprisingly,
we see that the higher the fraction of tracked contacts who are incubating the
lower the number of hospitalizations and deaths. These results are evident in
figures 10–12.

4. Discussions and Conclusions
The novel coronavirus epidemic which began in China has spread across the
globe with over 2,000,000 deaths. Several control measures have been taken
by health and government officials to mitigate the spread of the virus. Such
measures include social distancing, use of face-masks, lockdowns and contact
tracing. Although, CT is known to be efficient in mitigating the spread of disease outbreaks, we focus on quantifying this efficacy and showing the actions of
contact tracers that are mostly required in stopping the spread of the COVID19 epidemic. In particular, we consider special cases where we have perfect
tracking and monitoring, perfect reporting and tracking, and perfect reporting
and monitoring.
We have developed a time-fractional order differential equation model of the
contact tracing process in the COVID-19 outbreak. Our deterministic model
links the action of contact tracers such as monitoring and tracking to the number of reported cases traced. Our framework separates the infected population
into unreported and reported, and further splitting the reported cases into fraction whose contacts will be traced. Additionally, we incorporate the effect of
tracking by considering the probability that a traced contact will be incubating
(or infectious) when tracked. This inherent structure in the model captures the
dynamics of contact tracing and enables us to express the reproduction number
in terms of observable quantities. In particular, under the assumption that there
is a perfect tracking and monitoring, we gave an upper bound for the effective
reproduction number as Rc < κ(1 − s)/s, where κ is the average number of
secondary infected individuals traced per reported untraced case and (1 − s)/s
is the odds that a reported case is not a traced contact. In the case of perfect
tracking with either perfect monitoring or perfect reporting, we obtain the result
Rc = κ(1 − s)/s + κM , where κM is the average number of secondary infected
individuals per reported traced case. With these observable quantities, these
formulas can provide a quick and simple estimates of the reproduction number
in the population. Furthermore, we estimated the proportion of contacts that
need be traced to ensure that the reproduction number is below one. Although,
we would have loved to provide daily or weekly estimates of Rc from the formulas (above) involving observable quantities but we were unable to find CT
data for the COVID-19 epidemic. However, we relied on model simulations to
gain insights on the impact of CT with different special cases and during different stages of the epidemic. In fact, the decline of peak hospitalizations and
total deaths in the simulations of CT model compared to the preliminary model
shows its efficacy.
With the simulated CT model, the efficiency of CT in mitigating the spread of
the virus and altering the epidemiological outcomes of peak hospitalizations and
total deaths is a nonlinear function of the fraction of infected cases reported,
the monitoring policy and the proportion of traced contacts who are tracked
while incubating (see fig. 3, 8 and 11). In the first case (“perfect tracking and
monitoring”) and considering that 35% of infected cases are reported with 40%,
80% and 100% of reported cases being traced, the peak hospitalizations are re21

duced by 47.9% (88.1%), 81.2% (93.9%), and 91.8% (94.5%), respectively, for
Texas (Washington) state. The total mortality is also seen to decline by 30.6%
(82.7%), 59.8% (94.9%) and 75.7% (96.5%) in Texas (Washington). Furthermore, we investigated the intervention of CT after some discrete time delay. We
observe that early intervention of CT may greatly reduce the peak hospitalizations and total mortality. Even with a late intervention (after 100 days), we
see that the total mortality is reduced by a factor of 35.4% (93.3%) in Texas
(Washington).
In the second case, we assumed a perfect reporting of infected cases and perfect tracking of contacts of reported cases. With 50% of these cases traced and
the monitoring policies being implemented at 50% and 100% efficiency, we observe the reduction in total mortality (peak hospitalizations) by 64.2% (81.6%)
and 99% (99%) in Texas. In Washington, we observed a 63.8% (83.5%) reduction with a 50% efficient monitoring policy. Furthermore, the contour plots (see
fig. 8) show that while both fraction of traced reported cases and the monitoring
strategy are crucial in mitigating the spread, the monitoring strategy or policy
is of substantial importance so that tracked reported individuals do not cause
secondary infections while being monitored. Similar results are observed in the
case of perfect reporting and monitoring. Finally, we showed the effects of the
proportion of traced cases (), monitoring efficacy (βM ), and tracking efficacy
(ρ) in lowering the reproduction number so that the disease eventually die out
after a period of time.
In conclusion, our findings suggests that almost all states in the US should
adopt (if not yet) CT programs. In particular, our findings show that tracking
a larger proportion of traced contacts while incubating and perfect monitoring
of tracked contacts so that they do not cause secondary infections are highly
important for the impact of CT to be seen.
There are some limitations to the model discussed in this manuscript. For
a new epidemic like COVID-19, we expect and have seen that limited resources
have hindered governmental actions in mitigating the spread of the disease.
Thus, some of the model assumptions such as “perfect tracking or reporting
or monitoring” are simply for mathematical quantifications. Also, we have assumed that the the probability for fraction of first or higher order traced contacts
who will be incubating and infectious, respectively, when tracked are the same.
This is in general may not be the situation.
Appendix A. Effective Reproduction Number of Preliminary Model
The basic reproduction number Rc can be defined using the next generation
matrix [52, 53, 54]. The disease-free equilibrium point of the system is ε0 =
(S0 , 0, 0, 0). We define a next-generation matrix by considering the linearized
system at the disease-free equilibrium point ε0 . By using the notations in [52,
53], it follows that the matrices F of new infection terms and V of transfer of
