Abstract
Background: Worldwide demand for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing is increasing as more countries are
impacted by COVID-19 and as testing remains central to contain the spread of the disease, both in
countries where the disease is emerging and in countries that are past the first wave but exposed to
re-emergence. Group testing has been proposed as a solution to expand testing capabilities but
sensitivity concerns have limited its impact on the management of the pandemic. Digital PCR (RT-dPCR)
has been shown to be more sensitive than RT-PCR and could help in this context.

Methods: We implemented RT-dPCR based COVID-19 group testing on commercially available system
and assay (Naica™ System from Stilla Technologies) and investigated the sensitivity of the method in
real life conditions of a university hospital in Paris, France, in May 2020. We tested the protocol in a
direct comparison with reference RT-PCR testing on 448 samples split into groups of 3 sizes for RTdPCR analysis: 56 groups of 8 samples, 28 groups of 16 samples and 14 groups of 32 samples.

Results: Individual RT-PCR testing identified 25 positive samples. Using groups of 8, testing by RT-dPCR
identified 23 groups as positive, corresponding to 26 true positive samples including 2 samples not
initially detected by individual RT-PCR but confirmed positive by further RT-PCR and RT-dPCR
investigation. For groups of 16, 15 groups tested positive, corresponding to 25 true positive samples
identified. 100% concordance is found for groups of 32 but with limited data points.

Conclusions: Our proposed approach of group testing by digital PCR is shown to have a similar to better
diagnostic sensitivity compared to individual RT-PCR testing for group sizes of up to 16 samples. This
approach reduces the quantity of reagent needed by up to 80% while reducing costs and increasing
capabilities of testing by up to 10-fold.

Introduction
As the first wave of the COVID-19 is fading in most countries of the Northern hemisphere, many of
them have started implementing extensive monitoring policies to prevent the apparition of new
clusters potentially leading to a second wave. These policies all require important testing capabilities,
as was exemplified in Wuhan where all 11 Million citizens were recently tested in 10 days during May
2020. In some Southern countries, the amount of new cases is still increasing and wide population
testing cannot be achieve everywhere. Thus, scaling up and maintaining large testing capacities
worldwide remains a challenge, with limited reagent production and scarcity of testing equipment
likely to remain limitations.
Group testing or pooling, first suggested by Dorfman in 1943, is a protocol through which individual
samples are combined together before running the test(1). The advantage of the method is an overall
saving in the number of tests required to screen a given population (2), and thereby an increase in
testing capabilities for fixed reagent and instrumentation availability. Savings depend on key
parameters such as the disease prevalence and the group size. Group testing protocols using real-time
reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) have been evaluated and implemented for Covid-19 screening
around the world in several experiments using RT-PCR detection techniques, notably in Israel,
Germany, California, Nebraska, NY State, and Italy (3–9).
Although these studies show that positive individuals can be detected in pooled samples, the number
of amplification cycles needed to detect (Ct value) those is often increased by dilution and perhaps by
inhibition effects (3,5,7,9). This can prevent weakly positive specimen from being detected in group
samples (3,8). Concerns about the sensitivity of group testing have been raised by French medical
authorities, leading to a negative recommendation on their use in France(10).
Digital PCR (or RT-dPCR) is a PCR technique known for its higher sensitivity and precision over classical
RT-PCR (11,12). Digital PCR has also been shown to be more resistant to PCR inhibitors (13). Recent
studies have confirmed high sensitivity of RT-dPCR for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 (14–16).
In this study we propose a novel group testing protocol using a commercially available RT-dPCR assay
and compare empirically the sensitivity of individual identification through RT-PCR with group testing
by RT-dPCR for three groups sizes of 8, 16 and 32 samples. We find that, in our condition of evaluation,
group testing by RT-dPCR has a better or similar sensitivity than the reference individual RT-PCR testing
for groups of 8 and 16.

Material and Methods
Summary of the method of the comparative study
Overall, 448 patient samples are tested for SARS-CoV-2 by i) individual RT-PCR (local gold standard
method), ii) RT-dPCR in 56 groups of 8 samples, iii) RT-dPCR in 28 groups of 16 samples and iv) RT-dPCR
in 14 groups of 32 samples and results are compared between all four test protocols. In case of
discordance between the results of individual RT-PCR testing and group testing in RT-dPCR, samples
were re-analyzed individually by RT-dPCR, by the gold-standard RT-PCR and a confirmatory RT-PCR
assay. The whole protocol is illustrated in Figure 1.

Specimens collection, storage and pooling
Nasopharyngeal swabs of 448 patients screened for Covid-19 at the Bichat university hospital (Paris,
France), one of the two Paris reference centers for emerging diseases, between May 6th and May 26th,
2020 were included. All samples were collected in universal transport medium (UTM) (Virocult® or
eSwabTM) and tested, within 15 hours maximum upon collection, for SARS-CoV-2 detection according
to the local standards. Briefly, 400 µL of transport medium were tested by RT-PCR (Cobas SARS-CoV-2
test, Roche). All the remaining volume of transport medium of all specimens were kept at +5°C.
No later than 24 hours after routine screening, all samples with a leftover UTM volume above 600 µL
were systematically included in the group testing analysis. Thus, 125 µL of each included specimen
were sampled and randomly mixed with seven others to generate a total of 56 groups of 8 specimens
with a final volume of 1 mL per group. Nucleic acids were extracted from each group prior to viral
titration by RT-dPCR. The remaining volume of transport medium was stored at +5°C for further
investigations if required.
According to the current French ethical laws, samples used in the current study were only included
after the completion of all analysis required for the patient’s care.

Detection of SARS-CoV-2 by routine individual RT-PCR testing
All 448 specimens were analyzed individually on a Cobas® 6800 system (Roche, Switzerland) for Covid19 screening using the Cobas® SARS-CoV-2 Test kit targeting conserved regions for ORF-1a/b and Egene. For each specimen, 400 µL of transport medium were mixed with 400 µL of Cobas® lysis buffer
and loaded on the robot. During the run, extracts were eluted in 50 µL of which 27 µL were used in the
RT-PCR amplification of E and ORF-1a/b. A sample was considered positive for routine screening of
COVID-19 (“RT-PCR+”) if either target had a Ct value below 40 PCR cycles.
Within 11 days maximum (and 20 days for “Sample_25659”) upon storage at +5°C, some samples
which had different results for RT-PCR and RT-dPCR were reassessed on the Cobas® 6800 system. To

3

compensate for the low remaining amounts of transport medium, the nasal swabs were vortexed once
more into the remaining transport medium diluted 1 to 10 with new transport medium.

Extraction of total NAs on grouped samples
All nucleic acids extractions for RT-dPCR assays were performed on a MagNA Pure LC 2.0 (Roche,
Switzerland) using the MagNA Pure LC Total Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit (Roche, Switzerland) following
manufacturer’s instructions. For all sample groups, the total volume of 1 mL was used for the
extraction. For individual samples, 200 µL was diluted with 800 µL of buffer before extraction. Nucleic
acids were eluted from 1mL to 50 µL of the elution buffer provided with the kit and stored at +5°C for
a maximum of 12 hours before analysis.

Preparation of groups of 16 and 32 individuals
After extraction of the 56 groups of 8 specimen (P8 extracts) and prior to viral titration by RT-dPCR, 28
groups of 16 individual samples (P16 groups) were obtained by mixing 15 µL of 2 P8 extracts and 14
groups of 32 (P32 groups) were obtained by mixing 10 µL of 2 P16 groups.

Detection of SARS-CoV-2 by grouped RT-dPCR testing
SARS-CoV-2 titration of the grouped samples by RT-dPCR was performed on the Naica system (Stilla
Technologies, France) within the next three hours after extraction, using the COVID-19 Multiplex
Digital PCR Detection Kit (Stilla Technologies, France/Apexbio, China). This one-step reversetranscription PCR kit is a triplex PCR allowing amplification, detection and quantification of one
sequence in the N gene, one sequence in the ORF1ab region of SARS-CoV2 and an endogenous internal
control (IC) to assess the quality of the sample and extraction. These sequences are targeted by three
TaqMan probes respectively labelled with a FAM, HEX and Cy®5 fluorophore.
As recommended by the kit manufacturer, the PCR mix for a single reaction contained 12.5 µL of dPCR
MasterMix 1, 1 µL of dPCR Mix 2, 1 µL of COVID-19 Assay and 10.5 µL of either, P8, P16, P32, positive
control, negative control or individual extract. The 25 µL of this PCR mix were loaded in the inlet ports
of the Sapphire chips (Stilla Technologies, France). The chips were placed in the Naica Geode (Stilla
Technologies, France) for droplets generation, reverse transcription and PCR amplification following
the kit manufacturer’s instructions.
After amplification, the chips were transferred to the Naica Prism3 (Stilla technologies, France) for
fluorescence reading in the three detection channels and data were analyzed with Crystal Miner
Software (Stilla Technologies, France) following the kit manufacturer’s instructions.
An illustration of the resulting fluorescence dot-plots used to quantify the SARS-CoV-2 virus by RTdPCR is shown in Supplementary Materials.

Individual confirmatory testing for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR and RT-dPCR
In case of discrepancies between individual RT-qPCR and grouped RT-dPCR, RT-dPCR results were
confirmed by extracting individually each sample of the group and retesting them individually
according to the previously described RT-dPCR protocol. Confirmatory RT-qPCR test were also
performed on individual samples as previously described with the Cobas SARS-CoV-2 assay and a third
method, RealStar® SARS CoV-2 RT-PCR Kit (Altona Diagnostics, Germany), was also performed on an
ABI 7500 thermocycler (ThermoFisher Scientific, United-States) from the same individual extraction as
for the confirmatory RT-dPCR assay. Briefly, this latter assay targets all lineage B-betacoronaviruses by
amplifying a sequence of the E gene and a sequence of the S gene specific to SARS-CoV-2 as well as a
heterologous internal control. A sample was considered positive to SARS-CoV-2 if the Ct value of either
target is below 40 PCR cycles.

LoB/LoD evaluation for SARS-CoV-2 detection using RT-dPCR
The Limit of Blank (LoB) and Limit of Detection (LoD) were evaluated for SARS-CoV-2 detection using
the group testing approach used in the study on a cohort of 256 pre-epidemic nasal swab samples
(negative control samples) that were collected between December 1st 2019 and January 31st 2020 and
for which transport medium was stored at -20 °C within 48h after sampling.
Specimens were randomly grouped into 32 groups of 8 negative controls which were co-extracted and
analyzed by RT-dPCR using the same protocol described above. The results for all 32 groups are given
in Supplementary Materials. The LoB at 95% confidence level for the N target and the ORF1ab target
is determined to be of 2 and 0 positive droplets respectively. The LoD at 95% confidence level for each
target is of 0.49 copies / µL (7 copies/PCR) and 0.24 copies/µL (3 copies/PCR), respectively.
Consequently, a threshold of a least 3 positive droplets in aggregate between both the N target and
ORF1ab target is used to classify a sample as positive to SARS-CoV-2 by RT-dPCR in this study.

Results
Cohort description from routine RT-PCR testing
Using routine RT-PCR testing, 25 samples were identified as positive out of the 448 samples tested,
corresponding to an average test positivity rate of 5.5%. The positivity rate decreased during the study
period from 8.5% for the first 224 samples to 2.5% for the last 224 samples, in correlation with the
decreasing disease prevalence observed during the month of May in France.
The average Ct value was of 30.0 and 27.3 for the E gene and ORF gene respectively, with minimum
values of 16.5 and 16.3 and maximum values of 38.7 and >40 (not detected) (Figure 2).

Because sample pooling was performed systematically as samples came in the laboratory for routing
RT-PCR testing, the groups contain variable numbers of RT-PCR positive samples (“RT-PCR+” samples).
Given the positivity rate of RT-PCR at the time of the study, the majority of P8 extracts had no RT-PCR+
samples (35 out of 56) and 21 groups contained at least one RT-PCR+ sample, including 18 that had
one single RT-PCR+ sample.
For the largest group size of 32 samples, only 2 P32 groups had no RT-PCR+ samples. 12 P32 groups
had at least one RT-PCR+ sample, including 6 with only one single RT-PCR+ sample.

Detailed results for RT-dPCR in groups of 8
The results for SARS-CoV-2 detection by RT-dPCR in groups of 8 samples, detailed in Tables 1 and 2,
are in concordance with the reference individual RT-PCR testing for 52 groups (corresponding for 416
samples), out of which 32 were RT-PCR negative groups and 20 groups contained at least one RT-PCR+
sample.
For the remaining 4 groups with discording results, three RT-PCR negative groups tested positive by
RT-dPCR (“RT-PCR-/dPCR+” discordances – group IDs: P8_20, P8_28 and P8_39) and one RT-PCR+
group was found negative by RT-dPCR (RT-PCR+/dPCR- discordance – group ID: P8_02). The Ct values
for the sample associated with the RT-PCR+/dPCR- discordance was of 34 and 32.3 for the E gene and
ORF1ab with the Cobas® SARS-CoV-2 assay, respectively. This sample is referred to as Sample 25659
for later discussion.
Complementary analysis of the discordances are depicted below.
Of note, out of the 8 individual samples with Ct > 35 for the E gene, 6 ended up to be the only positive
sample in a P8 extract and all the corresponding groups were detected positive by RT-dPCR. The
highest detected Ct values for the E gene and ORF1ab were 38.7 and >40 (not detected), respectively.

The results for SARS-CoV-2 detection by RT-dPCR in groups of 16 samples, detailed in Tables 1 and 3,
are in concordance with individual RT-PCR testing for 25 groups (corresponding for 400 samples), out
of which 11 are RT-PCR- groups and 14 are RT-PCR+ groups. Among the three groups with discording
results, one presented a RT-PCR-/dPCR+ discordance (Group ID: P16_14) and two RT-PCR+/dPCRdiscordances (Group IDs: P16_13 and P16_28).

Of note, out of the 8 individual samples with Ct > 35 for the E gene, 5 ended up to be the only positive

The E gene and OFR1ab Ct values for these 2 samples were of [36.7; >40 (not detected)] and [36.3;

Investigation of RT-PCR-/dPCR+ discordances
As detailed above, three P8 extracts (P8_20, P8_28 & P8_39) and one P16 group (P16_14) tested
positive by RT-dPCR while containing only RT-PCR negative samples. P16_14 originates from a
combination of groups with opposite discordances: P8_27 (RT-PCR+/dPCR-) and P8_28 (RT-PCR/dPCR+) groups.
To further investigate these RT-PCR-/dPCR+ discordances, confirmatory testing RT-dPCR was
performed on all individual samples from corresponding groups. For each group, one sample tested
positive by individual RT-dPCR, with measured concentrations of viral RNA ranging from 128 copies
per reaction to 2 copies per reaction for the N gene, and from 106 to 1 copies for the ORF1ab gene.
The three corresponding dPCR+ samples (sample IDs: 52042, 56075 and 60401) were retested on the
Cobas® 6800 system and by confirmatory individual RT-qPCR using the Altona assay. All results are
given in the Supplementary Materials.
Two samples were found positive using the Altona assay with Ct values ranging between 28.4 and 33
for the E and S genes. Among them, the sample presenting the highest viral load by RT-dPCR (Sample
56075) was also found positive by the Cobas® confirmatory assay with a high Ct value of 36.7 for the E
gene while the ORF gene was not detected. The remaining sample tested negative with both the
confirmatory Cobas assay and the Altona assay. It had borderline levels of positive droplets in RT-dPCR
(N=2; ORF1ab=1).
Based on these results and for further sensitivity discussions, samples 52042 and 56075 that tested
positive by both RT-dPCR and Altona RT-PCR are considered as true positive samples. Sample 60401 is
considered an RT-dPCR false positive pending further analysis.

Investigation of the sample RT-PCR+/dPCROne group of 8 (P8_02) was tested negative by RT-dPCR and contained one RT-PCR+ sample (Sample
25659) with Ct values of 34 and 32.3 for the E gene and ORF1ab respectively. Sample 25659 was
subsequently retested by RT-PCR on the Cobas protocol and was also re-extracted individually and
retested by individual RT-dPCR.
Sample_25659 was found to be borderline negative by RT-dPCR (N=2; ORF1ab=0) but Ct values of 37.3
and 34.9 were found for E and ORF respectively in the second Cobas® assessment.
Based on these results and for further sensitivity discussions, sample 25659 is considered as a true
positive samples.

Correlation between RT-dPCR measurements and Ct values
A good correlation was observed between the number of positive droplets observed in RT-dPCR and
the Ct values of the positive samples contained in the groups. See Supplementary Materials for more
details.

Discussion
In this work, we assessed the sensitivity and specificity of group testing combined with digital PCR for
SARS-CoV-2 detection. Three different group sizes were investigated using a commercially available
digital PCR assay, the COVID-19 Multiplex Digital PCR Detection Kit (Stilla Technologies,
France/Apexbio, China). This assay demonstrated a low LoB (at 2 and 0 positive droplets per PCR for N
and ORF1ab genes, respectively) and low LoD (at 5 and 3 copies/PCR for N and ORF1ab genes,
respectively). This LoD is lower than most estimation for WHO and other reference RT-PCR assays
typically ranging between 5 to 500 copies/PCR (17,18).
For our analysis, we proposed a protocol of group screening performed by RT-dPCR with secondary
individual re-testing of positive groups as illustrated in Figure 3.

Figure 3 : Graph of the suggested practical protocol for implementation of group testing by RT-dPCR.

We assessed this protocol by assessing in real-life condition 448 consecutive samples grouped by 8, 16
and 32 samples.
We observed a better sensitivity than individual RT-PCR testing for groups of 8 samples. Indeed, a total
of 23 groups of 8 samples tested positive and included 26 true positive samples. Only 25 samples were
identified as positive using reference individual RT-PCR testing, corresponding to an +4% improvement

8

in sensitivity. Two among the three samples associated with RT-PCR-/dPCR+ discordances were
confirmed as true positive by RT-PCR using a SARS-CoV-2 specific assay from Altona. The last one was
not confirmed as positive by RT-PCR and is undergoing further investigations. One sample was
associated to a RT-PCR+/dPCR- discrepant results and is also considered a true positive sample as
confirmed by RT-PCR retesting. Further investigation by sequencing is underway on these 4 samples in
an effort to rigorously assess the existence and nature of nucleic acids variations responsible for the
discording results.
Grouped testing by RT-dPCR has similar sensitivity to individual RT-PCR testing for a group size of 16
samples. 15 groups of 16 samples tested by RT-dPCR positive and included a total of 25 true positive
samples, of which 23 are RT-PCR positive samples and 2 are RT-PCR-/dPCR+ samples. However, 2 RTPCR+ groups tested negative with grouped RT-dPCR. This is likely explained by high Ct values of the
single positive sample included in each of these 2 groups.
Testing in the 14 groups of 32 samples by RT-dPCR has 100% concordance with the reference RT-PCR
testing. Re-testing positive groups by RT-dPCR would have likely led to better sensitivity than RT-PCR.
However, we are careful in drawing conclusions for groups of 32 given the limited data points in this
case as only 14 groups, including only 2 RT-PCR negative groups.
An alternative and even more cost-effective group testing protocol could be to perform the re-testing
steps using RT-PCR with Cobas or Altona assays. In these protocols, the sensitivity becomes dependent
on the RT-PCR kit used, leading to potential discrepancies with RT-dPCR as observed in our results for
groups of 8 samples. However, our data suggest that performing the individual tests for groups of 8
and 16 with a RT-PCR assay would still have a similar sensitivity.
Overall, our data indicates that COVID-19 group testing combined with digital PCR for large group sizes
of 8 and 16 samples, followed by individual re-testing of positive groups, has better or similar sensitivity
than individual RT-PCR testing. Groups of 32 samples could also be considered, but our analysis needs
to be confirmed in the future as, due to the epidemiological situation at the time, a low number of
negative groups and groups containing a single positive sample were assessed.
The gain in sensitivity of the proposed method is likely due to a combination of i) a concentration effect
due to performing the pooling prior extraction and performing the extraction step from a large volume
of 1 mL of pooled transport medium and ii) the intrinsic superior sensitivity of digital PCR compared to
RT-PCR, as demonstrated previously for SARS-CoV-2 (14–16) and other viruses (12,19) detection.
Below standard sensitivity is one of the main reasons why group testing has not been widely adopted
for COVID-19 testing, whilst research groups have advocated for its implementation as a solution to
the world-wide un-met demand for tests and reagent shortage(2-9).
The current study suggests that the high sensitivity of group testing could be achieved using by digital
PCR instead of RT-PCR in the first group screening step. It makes the approach viable for large-scale,
low cost patient screening with minimum reagent consumption. For a test positivity rate of 1%, our
group testing protocol would save 79%, 80% and 69% of reagents compared to individual testing, for
group sizes of 8, 16 and 32 samples. Group size does not significantly impact cost or reagent
consumption for group sizes above 8 samples and test positivity rates below 1%. Consequently, the
choice of group size (8, 16 or 32) is mostly a balance of sensitivity and test capacity. Our results indicate
that group testing by digital PCR and a group size of 16 would increase testing capabilities by more
than 10-fold while having a sensitivity comparable to the current standard of individual testing by RTPCR.

Group testing can be used in various context where testing is not currently put in place due to testing
capacity or with strong economics constraints and where SARS-CoV-2 prevalence is low. In countries
where the pandemic is not yet under control or could re-emerge, enhancing testing capacity is
essential to winning the battle against COVID-19. In countries where the first wave is fading, the fight
against COVID-19 goes through a combination between a test / trace / isolate strategy and social
distancing. Increasing the range of people tested amongst contacts with positive cases, but also
periodic testing of population in frequent contact with others (e.g. nurses, transportation workers,
clerks, etc…) as well as in fragile populations such as nursing homes can be part of a strategy against
COVID-19 while allowing a relaxation of social distancing measures at the same time. Group testing
can help in all of these situations.

Supplementary Materials
S1 – Data format for RT-dPCR as obtained with the Naica System

Figure S1.1: Fluorescence results as displayed in the Crystal Miner software showing 1D dot-plots of a positive (P8_42) and a
negative (P8_44) pool of 8 samples in the FAM (A), HEX (B) and Cy5 (C) channels. The horizontal line marks the threshold above
which droplets (represented as dots) are considered positive for the amplification of N, ORF1ab and for the endogenous
internal control respectively. The thresholds are set by manufacturer at 20 000 RFUs, 15 000 RFUs and 15 000 RFUs for the
FAM, HEX and Cy5 channels. (D) 3D dot-plots of P8_42: if the concentration of either target is high enough, co-encapsulation
of several targets can occur in a droplet leading to the apparition of clusters for double positive droplets (cyan, yellow and
purple) and triple positive droplets (light grey). Triple negative droplets, containing no target, are shown in the dark grey
cluster.

Figure S1.2: Image of the droplet crystal obtained using the Naica System on grouped extracts P8_22, including a zoom on a
sub-region of the crystal. Droplet color code: dark grey = negative for all targets ; bleu : positive for N gene only ; green :
positive for ORF1ab only; red : positive for IC only; cyan : positive for N and ORF1ab genes; magenta: positive for N gene and
IC; yellow: positive for ORF1ab gene and IC; white / mixed: positive for all. The droplet crystal contains 25 820 analyzable
droplets, out of which 1 057, 883 and 21 121 were positive for the N, ORF1ab and IC respectively.

Table S2: Detection results in number of positive droplets for N, ORF1ab, N+ORF1ab and IC by RT-dPCR in 32 groups of 8 preepidemic samples.

The pre-epidemic groups were used as negative controls for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Only one out of 32 (group 5)
had one positive droplet for the N target out of 19881 droplets analyzed. The LOB at 95% confidence level for
this RT-dPCR assay was estimated automatically by the Gene-Pi online statistical tool (https://www.genepi.com/statistical-tools/loblod/), considering a droplet volume of 0.548 nL as specified by the manufacturer. The
LOD at 95% confidence level is computed from the experimental LOB. The LOB for the N and ORF1ab targets are
found to be of 2 and 0 droplets respectively. The LODs are found to be of 0.46 copies/µL and 0.22 copies/µL, or
equivalently of 7 and 3 copies per PCR reaction.
Using a joint analysis, a LOB analysis can be performed for the combination of the N and ORF1ab targets. In the
case, the sum of the positives for the N and OFR1ab target is used as the measure and the LOB for the sum is 2
positive droplets. Consequently, in this study, a RT-dPCR result is considered as positive when the sum of positive
droplets in the N and ORF1ab targets is of 3 droplets or more (strictly greater than 2).

Table S4: Results of the individual reassessment by both RT-dPCR and RT-PCR (Altona and Cobas®) for the samples from the
3 “COBAS-/dPCR+” discordant groups. NT = “Not tested”. ND= “Not detected”.

S5 - Absence of discordance in groups of 32
In this study, we did not observe any discordance for test results in groups of 32 when compared to
the reference individual RT-PCR results. In particular and surprisingly, there were no qPCR+/dPCRdiscordances although we would suspect an increased occurrence of such discordances as group size
increases from the dilution effect of group testing.
Interestingly, the 2 samples that were associated with the 2 qPCR+/dPCR- discordances for groups of
16 (with Ct values of [36.7; ND] and [36.3; 34.2] respectively) are both P32 groups that contained one
single positive qPCR+ sample. Consequently, these two samples were successfully detected by RT-dPCR
in groups of 32 (P32_07 & P32_14) but not detected in the groups of 16 (P16_13 & P16_28).
In case of P32_07, the group of 32 is a combination of 2 P16 groups with opposite discordances: P16_13
(qPCR+/dPCR-) and P16_14 (qPCR-/dPCR+). It is likely that the RNA templates from the P16_14 group
are those that were detected in the P32_07 group.
In the case of P32_14, the number of positive droplets observed in RT-dPCR is right above the threshold
of 3 positive droplets (N=2; ORF1ab=1) while for the corresponding group of 16 (P16_28), the number
of positive droplets is just below with 2 droplets (N=2; ORF1ab=0). In this case, statistical variations
due to sampling error could explain the observation.

versus the predicted equivalent Ct value of the E gene of an RT-PCR measurement of the group using the Cobas® SARS-CoV-2
assay. The predicted equivalent Ct value of a group is defined as an average of the Ct values of the positive samples included
in the group, taking into account the logarithmic scale of the Ct value.
