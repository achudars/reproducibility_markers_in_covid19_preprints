Abstract

This paper uses a new textual data index for predicting stock market data. The index is
applied to a large set of news to evaluate the importance of one or more general economic
related keywords appearing in the text. The index assesses the importance of the economic
related keywords, based on their frequency of use and semantic network position. We apply it
to the Italian press and construct indices to predict Italian stock and bond market returns and
volatilities in a recent sample period, including the COVID—19 crisis. The evidence ShOWS that
the index captures the different phases of ﬁnancial time series well. Moreover, results indicate
strong evidence of predictability for bond market data, both returns and volatilities, Short and
long maturities, and stock market volatility.

Introduction

In order to make informed decisions, individuals attempt to anticipate future movements of eco—
nomic variables and business cycle dynamics. This is particularly important for investment decisions
in ﬁnancial markets. An agent can gain from predicting future market needs and investing early,
satisfying market demands when they appear. There is a large body of literature on predicting
ﬁnancial markets and many indicators have been used as predictors. However, the predictability
power of such indicators is often questionable and evidence of systematic predictability is weak, see

Welch and Goyal (2008).
More recently, a new theory based on a different type of data has received increasing attention,
namely the news media perception and evaluation of the business cycles, see Beaudry and Portier

(2006). Beaudry and Portier (2014) state that “according to the news media View of the business
cycle, both the boom and the bust are direct consequences of people’s incentive to speculate on
information related to future developments of the economy.”

One of the main challenges of this

theory is the deﬁnition of news and how to empirically measure it. To overcome the problem,

Larsen and Thorsrud (2019) propose a novel and direct measure of media news based on their
semantic content. Using text data from a Norwegian ﬁnancial newspaper, they document a superior
predictability power of their indicator for Norwegian stock indices returns.
The recent COVID—19 crisis has rendered the task of predicting ﬁnancial market ﬂuctuations
even more difﬁcult.

Markets have promptly reacted to early news related to the coronavirus.

Indeed, as early as March 2020, markets collapsed, with weekly losses above 30%, well before
macro—economic indicators were impacted, as well as accurate information about the severity of the
Spread of the coronavirus in Europe and in the US was available. In this context, Italy represents a
peculiar case. Indeed, it was the ﬁrst country in Europe to experience a major outbreak of COVID—
19, with a much higher mortality rate than observed in other countries. This crisis hit Italy in a
moment when public ﬁnances were already under stress. In Italy, the country with the third largest
public debt in the word after US and J apan, the COVID—19 crisis has intensiﬁed an already difﬁcult
economic Situation, posing serious doubts about the short—term sustainability of the economy, as
well as the long—term outlook. From early summer 2020, signals and actions from the European
Central Bank and the European Union in support of the members’ economies and health systems
have somewhat alleviated the burden of an otherwise extensively paralysed economic environment.
Such period of economic and social turmoil, Where the news media have not merely covered
the role of broadcasting information but also that of conveying perceptions and expectations about
future states of the economy7 represents an unprecedented testing ground to evaluate the link
between news media information and macro—ﬁnance variables.
This paper introduces a new index of semantic importance. The index is based on a novel
methodology that evaluates the relative importance of one or more general economic related key—
words (ERKS) that appear in the news. The index, Whose construction combines methods drawn
from both network analysis and text mining, evaluates semantic importance along the three di—
mensions of prevalence, i.e. frequency of word occurrences, connectivity, 1.6. degree of centrality
of a word in the discourse, and diversity, i.e. richness and distinctiveness of textual associations.

Previous research mainly looked at media sentiment or media coverage, Without analysing the em—
beddedness that ERKS have in the corpus and their relationships with other words. Fronzetti Col—
ladon et a1. (2020) suggest that sentiment can be much less informative than semantic importance.
This is sometimes attributable to the methodologies used to calculate sentiment, for example when
trained on a general domain and then applied to a speciﬁc context. Indeed, sentiment algorithms
have variable error rates and their reliability has been questioned in different studies (J ussila et a1.,
2017). Accordingly, our approach excludes sentiment from the main indicator, thus measuring
importance, and not favourability, of ERKS.
We identify 38 relevant ERKS suited to our scope. Using a large database of articles published
by a pool of Italian newspapers,

over the period spanning between January 2017 and August

2020, we assign a score to each ERK, compounding the three dimensions mentioned above. We
then aggregate the information from the 38 ERKS in a single composite news index.

For the

aggregation, we apply Partial Least Squares (PLS) between the target variable and the (38 ERKS)
predictors, incorporating information from both the deﬁnition of scores and loadings.

de Jong

(1993), ShOW that the scores and loadings can be chosen so as to maximize the covariance between
the dependent variable and the predictors. To do so, our methodology based on PLS allows us to
construct a composite index in a target Speciﬁc manner.
While existing empirical literature in this context has focused on stock market return pre—

dictability, see Baker and Wurgler (2006), Baker and Wurgler (2007), Chung et a1. (2012) and
Limongi Concetto and Ravazzolo (2019) among others, we evaluate the power of our media news
index in predicting not only the Italian stock market aggregate return but also various short and
long maturity government bonds index returns, as well as their volatility.
Periods of large movements in the stock and bond markets are associated with political in—
stability and economic uncertainty. Our ﬁndings Show that the index is able to anticipate the
different phases of the market and capture idiosyncratic features of each series. We ﬁnd evidence
of economically meaningful and statistically signiﬁcant predictability for government bond returns
and volatilities. For stock market data, we ﬁnd evidence of predictability of the market portfolio
returns only to a limited extent. However, when predicting stock market volatility, adding in—

formation contained in the news media improves the prediction accuracy up to 9%, compared to
standard benchmark forecast models. Alternative (standard) methods for dealing With newspaper
information, such as the sentiment index, do not offer similar gains.
The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 introduces our new textual data
index. Section 3 provides a detailed description of the data employed, the methodological strategy
used to predict ﬁnancial time series with textual data, and the results of our analysis. Finally
Section 4 concludes.

A new index for textual data

In this paper we propose a novel measure of semantic importance that combines methods drawn
from both social network analysis and text mining. The index aims at measuring the relative impor—
tance of a predeﬁned set of words mentioned in a large set of textual documents. The methodology

labelled Semantic Brand Score was introduced by Fronzetti Colladon (2018) for application to com—
mercial brands’ reputation and awareness, but has never been applied in the economic and ﬁnancial
environment. Starting from the word frequency as a natural measure of importance Within a text

(Piantadosi, 2014), the association that a word has in the text, as well as the heterogeneity of
its context, are used as pivotal additional variables for a comprehensive

assessment. Our index

explicitly exploits the relationships among words in a text. To this end, texts are transformed
into networks of co—occurring words and relationships are studied through social network analysis,

see Wasserman and Faust (1994). AS an example consider the following sentence (and a word
co—occurrence threshold of 3 words) to generate the network reported in Figure 1: “The proud and
unfeeling landlord Views his extensive ﬁelds, and Without a thought for the wants of his brethren, in

imagination consumes himself the Whole harvest” (from The Theory of Moral Sentiments of Adam
Smith). Words are presented Without stemming, for the sake of readability.

and without a thought for the wants of his brethren, in imagination consumes himself the whole harvest” { f r o m
The Theory of Moral Sentiments of Adam Smith)

The index measures words’ semantic importance, 1.6. in our context of the selected ERKS7 along
the three dimensions of prevalence, diversity and connectivity.
Prevalence, Which relates to the notion of awareness, see Keller (1993), measures how frequently
an ERK is mentioned, the rationality being that an ERK used frequently is easier to remember and
more recognisable.

Prevalence is calculated as the frequency of a word in a given set of documents

and time—frame. Prevalence of a particular set of words could ultimately inﬂuence the opinions and
behaviours of the readers. For instance, in our context, the recurrent use of speciﬁc combinations
of words may trigger fear or an Optimistic View about the current, as well as future, states of the
economy.
Diversity measures the degree of heterogeneity of the semantic context in which a word is used,
with emphasis on the richness and distinctiveness of its textual associations. Diversity is deﬁned
by the number and uniqueness of connections a word has in the co—occurrence network and it
is measured by the distinctiveness centrality metric introduced in Fronzetti Colladon and Naldi

(2020). More precisely, in a graph of n nodes (words) and E edges (e.g. 1)7 distinctiveness of node
73 is given by:

n

DZ- 2

2

log (n _ 1)I(wz~j > 0),

j=1,jséz'

(1)

gj

Where W is the set of weights associated to each edge; 99- is the degree of node j, which is a

neighbour of node 73; I() is an indicator function that equals 1 if there is an edge that connects
nodes i and j with positive weight, wij.
We postulate that the degree of diversity provides relevant information about how pervasive
a topic is in the weave of the economy and could ultimately attract the attention of a variety of

economic actors, e.g. institutional investors, policy makers, private investors, etc.
The third dimension of the index, 1.6. connectivity, assesses the weighted betweenness centrality

of the ERKS, see Brandes (2001) and Freeman (1978). Connectivity measures how much a word is
embedded in a discourse acting as a bridge between its parts, or more speciﬁcally, how often a word
appears in—between the network paths which interconnect the other words in the text. Following

Wasserman and Faust (1994), for node i we have:

02- =dk—i)

<2)

j<k

Where djk(i)/djk is the proportion of shortest network paths connecting nodes j and 16 (measured
by edge weights) that include the node 2'. Finally, an index is constructed as a composite score
obtained by summing the standardized measures of prevalence, diversity and connectivity discussed

above. The standardisation is carried out considering the semantic network of each time period.

Forecasting stock and bond markets

The objective of our paper is to assess Whether, and if so to What extent, the information contained
in textual news data improves the predictability of macro—ﬁnance variables. Focusing on the Nor—
wegian stock market, Larsen and Thorsrud (2019) ﬁnd strong evidence of asset prices predictability
by textual news data. They use a latent Dirichlet allocation model that statistically categorises the
corpus, 1.6., the Whole collection of words and articles, into topics that best reﬂect the corpus’s word
dependencies.

Building on the aforementioned work, we rely on our more general semantic impor—

tance index, described in Section 2, as the aggregate measure of textual news data information
content. Our empirical evaluation centres on the Italian stock and bond markets. This choice is
not coincidental. Italy is a large economy, i.e. the 8th world largest economy by GDP, with a fairly
large stock market, among the most liquid in Europe and, with the third largest sovereign debt
in the world after Japan and US. This makes the Italian government debt market very attractive,
and thus liquid, at all maturities. We assess the predictive power of textual news information as a
non—traditional driver of the returns level, as well as volatility, of ﬁve stock and bond time series.
Our set of target variables comprises the aggregate market portfolio, i.e. FTSE MIB index,
and 2, 5, 10 and 30—year maturity Italian government

bond indices, collected from Datastream.

The bond indices are maintained by Reﬁnitiv and are designed to track the performance of euro—
denominated securities publicly issued by Italy for its domestic market. Such indices provide
high—quality measurements of bonds with similar maturities available in the market. For each of
these variables, available daily, we compute logarithmic returns and realised volatilities (measured
in percentage),

We opt for a weekly aggregation frequency

aggregated at a weekly frequency.

following evidence in Fronzetti Colladon

(2020), which showed that daily news data is highly

variable and proved that the effect produced by multiple news in one—week has more impact on
citizens’ behaviour. Indeed, investors can take time to form an opinion on newspaper contents
and can adjust their allocation only after sometimes. Moreover, online news is often accessed even
several days after publication and can therefore extend their inﬂuence over time.

Weekly realised volatility is computed using the range estimator of Parkinson (1980)7 i.e.

(410g 2)_1(10g Ht/Lt)2, where ht and Z1; represent the highest and lowest prices of week t, respec—
tively. The sample period spans from January 6, 2017 to August 28, 2020, totalling 191 weekly
observations.

MIB and the 2, 5, 10 and 30-year maturity B TP indices return and realised variance.

Table 1 provides descriptive statistics for our 10 target series. Over the period analysed, stock
market returns are negative on average and, as expected, more volatile than bond returns. The
lowest stock market return (—37%) occurs in the week between Monday, March 9, 2020, and Friday,
March 13, 2020, i.e. the inception of the COVID—19 crisis. Bond returns for maturities longer than
2 years are positive on average, likely boosted by the quantitative easing program initiated by the
European Central Bank, and exhibit an upward sloped volatility term structure.

3.1

Textual data collection and key words

Choosing pertinent keywords to search in a database of newspapers articles is crucial for the con—
struction of an informative textual index. As documented in literature, such Choice is non—trivial
because word meaning can vary across ﬁelds and users. For instance, Loughran and McDonald
(2011) ﬁnd that words associated to a negative attribute or meaning by Widely used dictionaries,
e.g. the Harvard Dictionary, are words typically not considered negative in ﬁnancial contexts. T0
circumvent the problem we select a limited set of words with a Clear economic meaning, homoge—
neously understood by the larger public.

We choose 38 sets of keywords: 24 singletons, i.e. individual words, albeit included also in plural

form when it exists, and 14 sets of words sharing Similar meaning, i.e. synonyms, or identifying
similar items or meaning. The set of keywords is reported in Table 2, translated from Italian Where

The textual data used in the analysis is provided by Telpress International and it is collected
from multiple online news sources. To generate networks from texts and to calculate our semantic
importance index, we rely on the SBS BI web applicationl,

see Fronzetti Colladon and Grippa

(2020), and the computing resources of the ENEA/CRESCO infrastructure (Ponti et 211., 2014).
Prior to the computation of the semantic importance index, common text pre—processing routines
(Perkins, 2014), such as tokenisation, removal of stop—words and removal of word afﬁxes, known as

stemming (Willett, 2006), are implemented. Then, a social network based on word co—occurrences
is generated for each time interval considered in the analysis.
The database of Italian news, published between January 2, 2017 and August 30, 2020, contains
more than 772,500 news articles. For each news we only consider the title and the lead, i.e. the
initial 30% of text, ignoring the remaining part2 This is consistent with previous work, which
suggested that semantic importance indices are more informative when calculated on the news
parts that better capture the readers’ attention, 1.6. the title and the lead, see Fronzetti Colladon
(2020). This is also aligned with past research, which has already proven that a large part of
internet users only read the beginning of online articles, see Nielsen and Loranger (2006), among
others.
We calculate an index, as detailed in section 2, for each of the ERKS listed in Table 2, thus

2We have also tried using the full content of news, but accuracy was not superior, computational time was
substantially longer and results are not reported.

obtaining 38 time series.

To reduce uncertainty and aggregate information, following Fronzetti

Colladon et a1. (2019), we apply Partial Least Squares (PLS) between the target variable and the
(38 ERKS) predictors, incorporating information from both the deﬁnition of scores and loadings.
Therefore, our measure is a series speciﬁc index.
Figure 2 shows our full sample indices associated to returns and volatilities target variables. For
the sake of comparability, each index is centred and standardised. Panel A indicates that the indices
targeted on the return series follow similar patterns, somewhat less evident when compared to those
targeted to volatility, with large movements associated to destabilising

political and economic

events. For example, the sensible negative movement in the index during spring 2018 coincides
with elections Where no party achieved a sufﬁcient majority; the sharp positive bounce during
autumn 2018, instead, reﬂects the reaction to pension and social welfare reforms, introduced by
the government composed by the conservative LEGA and populist M58 parties, that markets and
the European Union did not fully support. Similar patterns are observed during the late spring and
though summer 2019, period in which the Italian government suffered strong internal disagreements

on several affairs, including immigration, and which resolved in a new government coalition. Finally,
the effect of the inception of the COVID—19 pandemic is Clear.
Panel B shows that indices targeted to volatility are more variable than those constructed for
returns. Indeed, the average correlation of the latter is 97 %, the average correlation of volatility
targeted indices is 47%. However, the occurrence of large shocks and instability is aligned between
the two sets of indices. The only striking exception is observed at the end of 2019, when patterns
of the two sets of indices series appears to diverge.

3.2

Design of the forecasting exercise

Our forecasting exercise aims at assessing Whether including information stemming from news
contributes to improving stocks and bonds returns predictions. We employ a recursive forecasting
scheme, using an expanding estimation sample, to produce 1—week ahead forecasts. The ﬁrst
estimation sample spans from 6 January 2017 to 26 April 2019. The out—of—sample (OOS) forecast

evaluation period spans the following 70 weeks, 1.6. from 3 May 2019 to 28 August 2020. Therefore,
we consider both the pre—COVID19 period, the turbulent COVID—19 outbreak period in March and
April 2020, and the following less volatility COVID—19 period up to the end of summer 2020.
We opt for a simple forecasting model7 1.6. the ARX(1):
yt+1 = Cl + 7% + 5% + €t+1

(3)

Where yt+1 is the target variable we aim at predicting, am is a set of news information predictors

and 5t+1 N WN(0, 02). An obvious Choice for act is the pool (or a subset) of the 38 index assigned
to the ERKS listed in Table 2. If, on the one hand, this approach enables identifying and isolating
ERKS with predictive power from the rest, on the other hand, the large set of regressors, relative to
the limited number of observations in our sample, may generate an undesirable level of uncertainty.
To circumvent this problem we convey the information contained in the index associated with
the individual (sets of) keywords using two alternative aggregation approaches. The ﬁrst approach
extracts, from the pool of 38 ERKS variables, one or more common factors by means of partial
least square (PLS).3 The PLS is computed individually for each series and repeated for each Vintage
that forecasts are produced, therefore using real—time information. We labelled it as “ERK model”
in the remainder of the paper. The competing aggregation method, following Stock and Watson

(1999) and Timmermann (2006), consists in computing multiple forecasts for each target variable
using Equation (3) and one ERK predictor, 3323757 at the time and then in aggregating those forecasts.
We use the equal weight combination:
38

yt+1 = Z wifgi,t+1

(4)

72—1

where Qi,t+1 is the forecast of yt+1 generated by the linear ARX(1) using w” and 102- = 1/38,
2' = 1, . . . , 38.
We contrast the predictive performance of the model exploiting textual news information against
two standard benchmarks:

the White noise model when the target is the return of either stocks

and bonds and the AR(1) model When we aim at forecasting volatility.4 Welch and Goyal (2008)
document how difﬁcult it is to provide a superior forecast performance than the White noise model
when predicting stock returns. De Pooter et al. (2010) Show similar evidence for bond markets.
This is because prices or yields are non—stationary, or Close to, which makes it difﬁcult to outperform
the simple no—Change forecast. When we turn to volatility instead, the non—stationary component
is typically less relevant and the time—reversion is more pronounced, with periods of high and low
volatility alternating.5
Moreover, we also compare our index to an alternative and well—known text evaluation method:
3We have also tried principal component analysis (PCA), but results were inferior and not reported. We believe
that the total number of ERKS is limited and PCA is less adequate in this case.
4The White noise model for returns corresponds to the driftless random walk model for price. We refer to it,
labelling it RW, in the remaining part of the paper.
5W6 have also applied the RW no—change benchmark to volatility predictions, results are substantially inferior to
the AR models and not reported in the text.

the sentiment index, see Fraiberger et a1. (2018).

This index is computed by evaluating media

sentiment in correspondence with economy—related terms, considering the online news articles in—
cluded in our study. Prior to the calculation of sentiment, we apply the same text pre—processing
procedures described in 3.1.

Subsequently,

we consider the polarity of the words associated to

each ERK, and compute a weighted average based on co—occurrence strength.6 Accordingly, the
sentiment index may vary from —1 to +1, Where negative values represent negative expressions and
positive values represent positive expressions. We substitute our textual indicator with the senti—
ment index in Equation (3) and apply it as an alternative news information predictor. We label it
“SI model” in the remainder of the paper.
We measure forecast accuracy by means of mean squared prediction errors (MSPES).

The

statistical assessment of the predictive performance differential stemming from the inclusion of
textual news information is based on the Diebold and Mariano test (Diebold and Mariano, 1995,
DM).
3.3

Results

In—sample evidence

Results from Inoue and Kilian (2004) imply that in—sample predictability

is a necessary condition for out—of—sample predictability.

To assess the degree of in—sample ﬁt,

in Figure 3, we compare the ERK model based on the semantic importance index to the nested

benchmark model by means of Akaike information criterion (AIC). See, for example, Ravazzolo
and Rothman (2013) for a similar exercise on the role of oil prices for predictability to US output
growth.7 The AIC is computed recursively for all estimation Windows between 3 May 2019 and 28
August 2020.
The inclusion of textual news information improves stock and bond markets predictability in all

the sample. The gains are moderate in the ﬁrst part of the sample. Starting from March 2020, 1.6.
the inception of the COVID—19 crisis, until May 2020, for all the series, the ERK model exhibits
a dramatic drop in the AIC, resulting in large positive values for the difference that indicate a
large predictability power from our index. The largest difference is observed when predicting stock

market returns. Gains continue to exist in the second part of the COVID—19 period after May 2020
associated to lower volatility in the series. The ERK model shows the most persistent gains over
the sample for the bond with the longest maturity.
The data shows a similar picture when turning to stock market and bond volatility, albeit less
consistent. Until March 2020, for the stock market returns, the ERK is inferior or similar to the
benchmark, but then it dominates for the remaining part of the sample.

When turning to bond

volatility, in general, the ERK model performs well from summer 2019, a period characterised by
political uncertainty in Italy. The ERK performance stabilises during autumn 2019 after a new
6W6 additionally tested other approaches for the calculation of sentiment, such as considering the full articles’
content and not just the sentences related to economic terms. However, none of these alternative approaches led to
results better than our primary choice.
7Note that the benchmark model when predicting volatility series is the AR(1). For returns, the benchmark is
the White noise process. However, because the latter does not have any explanatory component, its AIC is very poor,
i.e. it is a function only of the series variance, see the forecasting puzzle in Meese and Rogoff (1983). Therefore, for

the sake of a fair comparison, we contrast the AR(1) and ERK models in all ten evaluations.

gains are lower in the second part of the COVID—lQ period, but the difference remains positive for
all four bond comparisons.

Figure 3: Panel A shows dz’ﬁerences in AI 0 (AIC{AR) - AIC{ERK)) for the AR model without the semantic
importance index and the alternative A R X model with the semantic importance index (ERK) when predicting

Italian stock: returns (FTSE MIB) and Italian bond returns (BTP—2y, BTP—5y, BTP-10y, BTP-30y); if the AR
model generates the better ﬁt, then the A I C differences are negative. Panel B shows diﬁerences in AIC ( A I CYA R )
— AIC{ERK)) for the A R model and the alternative ERK when predicting volatility of Italian stock and bond
markets.

Returns out-of-sample results

Results in Panel A of Table 3 ShOW that the ERK model that

includes the semantic importance of economic related keywords improves forecasting accuracy for
the shorter and longer maturity bond returns. In particular, reduction in MSPE for the 2—year
bonds is statistically signiﬁcant at 10%. MSPE reduction for the 30—year bonds is more moderate
and the performance of the RW and ERK models are more similar for the 5—year and 10—year
maturity.

In the case of stock returns (FTSE MIB), results are comparable to the benchmark,

but not superior. Studying performance over time, the ERK model gives the largest predictability
during the ﬁrst part of the COVID—19 period, but this predictability smooths in the second part
of the COVID—19 period for the stock returns and bond returns with middle term maturities,

conﬁrming AIC evidence in Figure 3.
The AR model never provides comparable results and only for the 2—year BTP maturity does

it achieve lower MSPE than the RW. The forecast combination of ARX (EW) is also statistically
superior to the benchmark for the 2—year bond returns7 yet falls behind the ERK model. Finally,
in none of the ﬁve cases does the model based on the sentiment index offer gains similar to the
ERK model and it is never superior to the benchmark RW. Therefore, how newspaper information
is treated and modelled matters.

Volatility out-of-sample results

Panel B of Table 3 provides results on volatility predictions.

In this case, we observe the largest gains, in terms of forecast accuracy, obtained by using the
semantic importance index. In all the ﬁve cases, the ERK model is statistically superior to the
11

AR benchmark, with MSPE reductions ranging from 9% t0 1%. The large improvement is when

forecasting stock market volatility, with a smaller MSPE of 9% and statistically signiﬁcant at 1%
conﬁdence level. When predicting bond volatility, the ERK statistically outperforms the bench—

mark for all maturities, with the largest economic gains observed for the 10—year maturity (6%
improvement). The forecast combination does not measure up, often resulting statistically inferior
to the benchmark. In addition, the SI model does not perform similarly to the ERK: SI gives lower
MSPE than the AR for the volatility of the stock index and the 30—year bond returns, but the
reduction is never statistically Signiﬁcant.

This result stresses the importance of the index con—

struction to avoid an unfavourable signal to noise balance. Indeed, textual data helps to improve
forecast accuracy provided that speciﬁc keywords that receive more attention in newspapers are
selected.

Table 3: Panel A provides mean square prediction error ( M S P E ) results when forecasting Italian stock
returns (FTSE MIB) and Italian bond "returns (BTP—Qy, B TP-5y, B TP—J 0y, B TP—30y ) Absolute MSPE
for the random walk: (RW) benchmark is reported; relative numbers to the benchmark are given for the al—
ternative autoregressi've ( A R ), autoregressive extended with the semantic importance index (EEK), equal
weight combination of A R X models based on diﬁerent economic related keywords ( E W ) and autoregres—
si’ue extended with the sentiment index (SI). Panel B provides MSPES when forecasting the volatility of
Italian stock and bond markets. Absolute MSPE for the A R benchmark is reported; relative numbers to
the benchmark are given for the alternative speciﬁcations. One >l< and two *>I< indicate that the alternative
model provides superior statistical forecasts at 10 and 5 % signiﬁcance level, respectively.

Conclusion

This paper introduces a new textual data index for predicting stock market data. The index is based
on a novel methodology applied to a large set of newspaper articles to evaluate the importance of
one or more general economic related keywords that appear in a text. The index considers three
dimensions:

prevalence, connectivity and diversity. The methodology is applied to online Italian

press and 38 economic related keywords are selected. The resulting index is used to predict the
Italian stock market and government bond returns and volatilities in the 2017—2020 period, including
the inception of the COVID—19 crisis.
Our ﬁndings Show that the semantic importance index based on media news text data is able to

12

capture the different phases and individual features of return and volatility dynamics of ﬁnancial
variables. Periods of large movements in the index are associated with political and economic
instability. When used to predict weekly market and bond returns and volatilities, we ﬁnd strong
evidence of predictability of bond returns and volatility, as well as of stock market volatility.
