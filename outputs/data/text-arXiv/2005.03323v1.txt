Abstract
I employ a simple mathematical model of an epidemic process to evaluate how four basic
quantities: the reproduction number (‚Ñõ), the numbers of sensitive (S) and infectious individuals
(I), and total community size (N) affect strategies to control COVID-19. Numerical simulations
show that strict suppression measures at the beginning of an epidemic can create low infectious
numbers, which thereafter can be managed by mitigation measures over longer periods to flatten
the epidemic curve. The stronger the suppression measure, the faster it achieves the low numbers
of infections that are conducive to subsequent management. Our results on short-term strategies
point to either a two-step control strategy, following failed mitigation, that begins with
suppression of the reproduction number, ‚ÑõC, below 1.0, followed by renewed mitigation measures
that manage the epidemic by maintaining ‚ÑõC at approximately 1.0, or should suppression not be
feasible, the progressive lowering of the effective reproductive number, ‚ÑõCeff ‚âà ‚Ñõ C S/N, below
1.0. The objectives of the full sequence of measures observed in a number of countries, and likely
to see in the longer term, can be symbolically represented as: ‚Ñõ0 √† ‚ÑõC<‚Ñõ0 √† ‚ÑõC<<1.0 √†
‚ÑõC‚âà1.0 √† ‚ÑõCeff<1.0. We discuss the predictions of this analysis and how it fits into longer-term
sequences of measures, including using the herd immunity concept to ‚Äòleverage‚Äô acquired
immunity.

Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic is a major global threat. Spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus began in
China in late 2019, with 41 cases recorded according to the WHO as of January 11/12, 2020,
attaining almost 4 million confirmed cases worldwide as of May 6th (1). By its highly transmissible
and virulent nature, COVID-19 is putting considerable strain on health services, meaning that
increasing numbers of patients in the most afflicted countries cannot be adequately cared for,
which will likely further exacerbate disease morbidity and mortality.
Research groups have mobilized to collect and analyze molecular (2) and epidemiological (3-5)
data, and employ statistical and mathematical models to simulate regional and national outbreaks
and the global pandemic, and evaluate possible control measures (e.g., 6-14).
Particularly important in this effort is the projection of how different strategies will affect
outbreaks. Conducting such studies without delay is crucial, both because most countries are in
early outbreak stages and thus open to management options, and since some nations are days or
even weeks behind in their epidemics compared to others. The latter property is important, since
the lockstep nature of COVID-19 epidemic trends mean that nations can ‚Äòpeer into the future‚Äô to
predict how their own outbreaks could unfold. This information and the efficacy of control
strategies already adopted by other ‚Äòfuture‚Äô countries can be instrumental in giving the time needed
to plan and logistically organize effective measures.
Here, we employ a simple epidemiological model to elucidate some of the basic parameters and
processes that arbitrate short-term control measure outcomes. The model‚Äôs intuitive results
emphasize the necessity to adopt one or both of two strategies. ‚ÄòSuppression measures‚Äô are
engaged early and decisively to lower the reproduction number, ‚Ñõ, below 1.0 and as close as
possible to 0.0. When successful, this results in low, manageable numbers of infections (a low
‚Äòset-point‚Äô), and can then be followed by a second strategy: ‚ÄòMitigation measures‚Äô that continue
to flatten the epidemic curve by maintaining the reproduction number to approximately 1.0.
However, strategies need not follow this sequence. For those countries reacting very early in an
outbreak, mitigation measures alone may be sufficient. For those that are late and/or unable to
employ radical suppression measures, ‚Äòprogressive mitigation‚Äô so as to lower ‚Ñõ below 1.0 may be
the only alternative.
The objective of the present study is to emphasize how strategic lowering of the reproduction
number is central to a rational management plan to minimize the impacts of COVID-19. Because
local outbreaks are producing large numbers of recovered cases, this opens the possibility that any
acquired immunity can be ‚Äòleveraged‚Äô to reduce the intensity of future policies.

Model
We employ a modified SEIR model of Susceptible (S) ‚Üí Exposed (E) ‚Üí Infectious (I) ‚Üí
Removed (R) states (15). The ordinary differential equations take the form:

where N is a constant equal to S+E+I+R, b is the transmission parameter, Tinf is the infectious
period, ùõæ is the rate of removal into different subclasses of R. Specifically, R is composed of minor
cases ùê∂5 , severe cases at home ùê∂6 , severe cases in hospital ùê∂78 , and fatalities ùê∂9 , given by

Here, ùëÉ5 , ùëÉ7 , and ùëÉ9 are, respectively, the probabilities of a case being mild, severe and resulting
in death (ùëÉ5 + ùëÉ7 + ùëÉ9 = 1). ùê∑<5 , ùê∑<7 , ùê∑8= , are days to recovery for mild and severe cases,
time of hospitalization, and ùê∑9 is the time from end of incubation to death (Titod) minus duration
of infectiousness (Tinf).
An outbreak occurs if the basic reproduction number, ‚Ñõ0 = b / ùõæ > 1.0. The impact of control
measures is easily understood by their impact on ‚Ñõ0, and in the presentation below, we refer to
these effects by reductions in ‚Ñõ0, yielding the modified constant value, ‚ÑõC.

Numerical methods
We employ this general model for COVID-19 to explore how some of its central properties could
affect outbreak control efforts. The over-simplicity of the model means that it should not be used
to make precise predictions for actual epidemic management situations, but rather serve as a
conceptual tool that can serve as a first step towards more realistic analyses for specific scenarios
or situations.
Specifically, we focus on how two generic types of objective ‚Äì suppression and mitigation ‚Äì affect
epidemiological and clinical parameters. We expect that, all else being equal, suppression will
reduce ‚Ñõ0 more than would mitigation. However, their impacts on ‚Ñõ0 are expected to differ from
locality to locality depending on the details of (and adherence to) the measures deployed. This
argues for examining a range of ‚ÑõC for each of the two types of objective, and recognizing that
mitigation measures in one locality (e.g., country) could be more effective at lowering ‚Ñõ0 than
suppression measures in another.
Epidemic management strategies were investigated using the Epidemic Calculator package (16)
(Supplementary Material). This platform is rich in possibilities for varying key parameters such
as the reproduction number (‚Ñõ) and temporal scales of infection (Tinf and Tinc), as well as initial
sub-population of infections individuals (I0) and the total population size (N=S0+I0). The platform
also permits the user to experiment with different ‚Äúclinical‚Äù parameters, including hospitalization
rate, case fatality rate, and recovery time for mild cases.
The results presented below are based on the parameter values provided on the website simulator
page (Table 1). Given the recent emergence of COVID-19, these parameter values should be
viewed as preliminary and possibly inaccurate, since for example, they may be based on limited
data or be time- or location-specific. This reinforces the above call for caution in interpreting the
findings presented here, and in using the precise model output for any specific management
actions.

The Epidemic Calculator package, although very flexible, has some limitations in its use for
scientific study. First, the accuracy of the simulator output is untested with respect to analytical
results, independent computational studies, and other SEIR platforms. The only test conducted
here did verifiy that the simulated equilibrium fraction of susceptible individuals (S¬•) followed
the predicted relation: -ln(S¬•/S0)= ‚Ñõ(1-S¬•/S0) (15). The results presented below ‚Äì even if
consistent with intuition ‚Äì nevertheless need to be viewed as preliminary and contingent on future
testing. Second, precision in the intervals for input parameters and platform output were not
always to the last decimal places, and for large numbers, such as the total community size N, a
limited number of choices were available. Therefore, for example, there was no choice for exactly
N=70 million, and as such the next highest option (70,420,854) was employed. The same was true
for simulations with the lower population size of N=70K (70,263 was used). Moreover, the data
presented below (i.e., y-axis data point readings) were in some cases closest interpolations of
closely neighboring values that resulted in the simulation target. Varying the input and reading
rules to neighboring values was found to have negligible effects on the trends reported, and did
not change the main conclusions of this study.

Results
We first explored how the trigger number of infectious cases (I) for suppression measures to be
engaged, affected the critical level of ‚ÑõC necessary to keep infectious cases at or below a set-point
of 100 after 60 days. We chose 60 days because it is the approximate period that areas of China
(as the first affected country), decided to enter lockdown.

Figure 1. Suppression levels required to meet objectives, given different starting conditions. Simulations begin with
no measure imposed (‚Ñõ0=2.5) and 1 infectious individual in a population of c. 70 million unexposed individuals. The
suppression strategy starts when the number of infectious individuals attain a given number (x ‚Äì axis), which
correlates with the time elapsed in the outbreak. ‚ÑõC is the observed maximum level of ‚Ñõ needed to result in a setpoint of 100 or fewer infectious individuals after 60 days of confinement (y ‚Äì axis). Although not shown, imposing
mitigation measures in the range 1.0<‚ÑõC<2.5 prior to suppression does not change this basic result. Lines linking
points aid visualization. See text for further details.

Figure 1 shows that larger numbers of infectious individuals require stricter measures to attain
the (arbitrary) set-point objective of 100 or fewer circulating infectious individuals after two
months of measures. According to our simulations, a population the approximate size of Western
European nations such as France, Spain, the UK and Germany would need to reduce transmission
probabilities to near zero to attain the objective, should infectious numbers be on the order of
100,000. Early interventions in populations with 1 to 100 circulating infectious individuals would
still require considerable measures, with reductions in baseline ‚Ñõ0=2.5 of 25% to 60%,
respectively. Given cumulative case number doubling times observed in some countries of about
3 to 5 days (17) (and therefore c. 2 weeks between each log integer on the x-axis of Figure 1), the
choice of measures without knowing their true impacts on the reproduction number could have
resulted in insufficient flattening of the epidemic curve and valuable time lost. The data in Table
2 support these insights, whereby suppression measures need to be increasingly strict in order to
reduce the time necessary to obtain low target case numbers.

We then asked how population size and the effectiveness of suppression measures would
condition how subsequent mitigation measures attain objectives after 200 days. We conducted a
2 x 2 numerical experiment. The first variable was community size, taken either to be a small city
of about 70,000 inhabitants or a medium-sized nation of about 70 million. (Additional numerical
experiments not presented here indicate that the observed trends apply at least in the total
population range of 104 to 108). The second variable explored was the effectiveness of previous
suppression measures; we evaluated high effectiveness (a reset to a single infectious case) and a
less, but still acceptable reset to 100 infectious cases. Clearly, any subsequent mitigation measures
yielding ‚ÑõC<1.0 would result in infectious cases decreasing over time (and therefore be a
successful outcome), but given the impacts of such measures on society, below we consider
strategies that seek to contain a second epidemic by tuning ‚ÑõC to between 1.0 and ‚Ñõ0.
Figure 2 shows how the effectiveness of suppression strategies and community size influence
how subsequent mitigation measures affect epidemiological and clinical parameters. For example,
regulating the infectious numbers to less than 10% of the total population requires ‚ÑõC less than
c.1.5, which is about a 40% reduction in the ‚Ñõ0 assumed here (Fig. 2A). Peak levels of
hospitalization can reach c.7%-10% should mitigation measures be 20% or less effective at
reducing ‚Ñõ0 (Fig. 2B). Such levels would exceed hospital bed capacity in most countries by at
least an order of magnitude (18). Reducing peak hospitalization levels well below 1% (which is
still too high for many health services) would require ‚ÑõC close to 1.0. Finally, similar to the trends
in Figs. 2A,B, fatalities are sensitive to the effectiveness of prior suppression measures and
community size, indicating that ‚ÑõC needs to be reduced towards unity for smaller communities
and those unable to reduce infectious cases sufficiently during suppression measures (Fig. 2C).
These results emphasize that epidemics could be contained by tuning ‚ÑõC close to, but above 1.0,
which would be more logistically and socially attainable than ‚ÑõC<1.0.

Although not explored here,
numerical simulations for

with points above the dashed

‚Äòherd immunity‚Äô, i.e., when the
proportion of the population in

the result in (A) appears to
contrast with the results in Steir
et al. (5), who showed higher
case growth rates with city size.
The discrepancy can be
explained by the different units
employed in each study (case
growth rate in (5) vs. fraction of
total population infected at
some point during a fixed time
interval (this study)) and how ‚Ñõ
was estimated in (5) (found to

The herd immunity threshold is contingent on ‚Ñõ0. But policies that reduce transmissions resulting
in ‚Ñõ < ‚Ñõ0 will also reduce the threshold. We observed that the attainment of herd immunity,
whereby the rate of new infections is reduced below unity (when St/N<1.0-1.0/‚Ñõ), did not ensure
the rapid end to an outbreak (Fig. 2A). Indeed, ‚Äòepidemic overshoot‚Äô (20) occurs in this simple
model for all ‚Ñõ>1.0. Figure 3 extends the findings in Fig. 2A (limited to 200 days) to different
points in the epidemic. We see that infected levels exceed the herd immunity threshold (black
line) before maximum hospitalizations are observed (gray line). For ‚ÑõC‚â•1.2 the overshoot by the
end of the epidemic (blue line) is between c.15-30% of the population. Moderate levels of
mitigation can have major impacts in the short term (cf. ‚ÑõC=2.0 vs. ‚Ñõ0=3.0 at 60 days), but as the
epidemic runs its course, the sensitivity of ‚ÑõC exceeding 1.0 becomes apparent; for example,
‚ÑõC=1.2 results in c.30% of the population infected at some point during the epidemic. We discuss
the implications of this important finding for policies that ‚Äòleverage‚Äô immunity in the Conclusions.

Finally, whereas mitigation measures result in fewer cases (Figs. 2, 3), if ‚ÑõC>1.0, then they also
lengthen the course of the epidemic (Figure 4). An epidemic with no mitigation (example shown
here is ‚Ñõ0 =3.0) is 95% complete 85 days after the 100th case. In contrast, an outbreak coming

95% at 585 days. The implications of long-term mitigation levels are discussed below.

Conclusions and future directions
The lockstep nature of COVID-19 outbreaks in different regions, countries and cities means that
management practices in places further along the epidemic curve can inform those in earlier
stages. Control strategies in one country, however, are not always applicable in others, due for
example to cultural and logistical differences (21). Mathematical models based on empirical data
have a role to play in adapting capacities to address epidemics, both as conceptual aids and
management tools. The present study explored two generic types of intervention that can
contribute to reducing the impact of COVID-19 epidemics. ‚ÄòSuppression measures‚Äô would be
adopted by communities that either initially decided not (or did, but were unable) to mitigate the
exponential increase of new cases. Suppression reduces the reproduction number below 1.0, and
in so doing lowers the number of infectious cases to a manageable level. ‚ÄòMitigation measures‚Äô
may either be introduced as a preventive approach, whereby communities begin to manage very
early in an outbreak, gradually introduced towards the end of a suppression strategy, or for
countries unable or unwilling to enforce suppression measures, the only route possible to flatten
10

the epidemic curve. The sequence of objectives observed in a number of countries, and likely to
be seen in future months, can be symbolically represented as sequential stages:

ùì°0 √† ùì°C<ùì°0 √† ùì°C<<1.0 √† ùì°C‚âà1.0 √† ùì°Ceff<1.0
The latter condition (‚ÑõCeff < 1.0) was not explored in this study, but ‚Äòleverages‚Äô any acquired
immunity so as to lower the effective reproduction number ‚ÑõCeff ‚âà ‚ÑõC S/N below 1.0 (see
discussion below).
The actual application of measures to meet this sequence of objectives is likely to be complex (1214), and in particular, mitigation measures could go through multiple successive adjustments in
the latter two phases represented above.
Our analysis presented here yield several important insights and predictions:
1. The number of infectious cases at the start of suppression determine how effective these
measures are at creating a reset. Communities with more than 100,000 infectious cases
essentially have to reduce transmission to zero in order to have about 100 cases after 60 days.
Greater suppression measure stringency also means that with slightly longer confinement
periods, an ever-lower set-point in the numbers of infectious individuals can be obtained. This
permits reduced measure intensity in subsequent mitigations.
2. The duration of suppression measures needed to attain an objective decreases with the
intensity of measures. Lowering ‚ÑõC to or below 0.1 (i.e., a 96+% drop from ‚Ñõ0=2.5) from just
over 10,000 infectious cases would meet the objective of 100 after 30 days, and this
approximately coincides with what was the Chinese data suggests (1). According to our
simulations, an ‚ÑõC>0.5 would require more than 60 days to meet this same objective.
3. Epidemic management is most effective if engaged when infectious cases are low enough
to preserve health service capacities. As above, this is best done either near the start of an
outbreak or once a suppression reset has obtained. Although in this scenario, ‚ÑõC<1.0 is a
sufficient condition for continued suppression, tactics that give weight to individual freedoms,
yet keep ‚ÑõC above, but sufficiently close to 1.0 can limit epidemic consequences (see also
below), including morbidities and mortalities and the saturation of health service capacities.
Data analysis of 11 European countries (14) supports the basic quantitative predictions set out
in the present study, and similar analyses of richer, near-future data sets will be needed to refine
target parameter values so as to yield regional epidemic and global pandemic management
objectives.
4. Epidemics do not suddenly stop when the fraction of susceptible individuals drops below
the herd immunity threshold (20,22). We find that although herd immunity is predicted to
11

occur when 60 to 70% of the population have been infected and become immune (based on
parameters in Table 1), if an outbreak is left unchecked, then the virus will eventually infect
approximately 90% of the population (‚Äòepidemic overshoot‚Äô). According to our model, some
level of overshoot always occurs for mitigation measures, but the degree depends on the
intensity of such members. For example, measures that lower ‚Ñõ0 by 50% from 3.0 to 1.5 will
still result in approximately 60% of the population eventually becoming infected, even though
the herd immunity threshold is about 33%.
5. Mitigation extends the course of an outbreak (Figure 4). Mitigation, even if less restrictive
compared to suppression, has impacts on health services, society and the economy. Maintaining
‚ÑõC‚â•1.0 is therefore a short-term solution to contain an epidemic whilst preserving certain
liberties. Longer-term (months) measures will need to lower the effective reproduction number
‚ÑõCeff ‚âà ‚ÑõC S/N below 1.0, so as to attenuate and finally stop the outbreak.
This latter prediction highlights the potential for any acquired immunity to be ‚Äòleveraged‚Äô so as to
ease-off on restrictions (thereby increasing ‚ÑõC), but nevertheless effectively mitigate or even
suppress the outbreak. For example, if 15% of a population were previously exposed and immune,
then this suggests that ‚ÑõC<1.18 (equivalently ‚ÑõCeff<1.0) would suppress the outbreak. This 18%
increase would enable less-intense measures compared to the situation at the start of an outbreak,
where ‚ÑõC<1.0 is necessary. Although more study is needed, we suggest that this strategy could be
progressive, meaning that as fractions of the population with acquired immunity continue to
increase, so too could the easing-off that results in suppression (i.e., ‚ÑõCeff<1.0 is maintained,
despite purposeful increases in ‚ÑõC). A similar strategy called ‚Äòshield immunity‚Äô has recently been
proposed by Weitz and coworkers (23), and consists of the intentional deployment of immune
individuals so as to reduce transmission and outbreaks. The potential use of such leveraging will
only become clear once long-lasting immunity is better understood.
Of the many limitations to our analysis, two in particular merit further study. First, the model
assumes random mixing of individuals. Real infection networks are far more complex, and may
involve (i) significant spatial structuring, (ii) different numbers of contacts per individual and
through time and travel, (iii) epidemiological class effects (such as age, quarantined, hospitalized),
and (iv) persistence of the virus in the external environment. Mathematical models incorporating
heterogeneous contact structures (e.g., 5, 7, 24) will have a role to play in indicating the
effectiveness of different control measures. Analyses similar to (14) should explore both realistic
contact structures and community-specific values of epidemic and health service parameters.

12

Second, future analyses will need to translate actual tactics into their effects on different
epidemiological parameters, and specifically ‚ÑõC. A number of tactics have been proposed and
some variously adopted by different communities, including: spatial distancing, quarantining,
hand washing, wearing masks, gloves; diagnostics such as contact tracing, and virus and antibody
testing; and interventions such as employing repurposed drugs and developing vaccines. Such
approaches will need to be employed in complementary ways, since no single one is likely to
attain reset or management objectives. Moreover, calibration of ‚ÑõC in particular will require
accurate assessments of the contribution of asymptomatic transmission to the propagation of the
virus, the latter having been recently demonstrated in mathematical models to potentially
influence COVID-19 dynamics (25).
In conclusion, the simple model analyzed here is not an instrument to develop precise, actionable
strategies. Rather, it is a conceptual tool that identifies some of the important parameters, and
generates testable hypotheses of how these could affect outbreak management outcomes.
