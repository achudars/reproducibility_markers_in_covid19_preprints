1. Can we adapt strategies used to fight HIV to create strategies to fight the
coronavirus?
We live with many viruses that have no vaccine and no cure. One notable example is HIV. Although many effective treatments have been developed, there is still neither a cure nor a vaccine
for HIV. Nonetheless, most people do not live in constant fear of HIV, in spite of the fact that it is
a deadly and incurable virus. How do we manage this? How do you protect yourself from HIV?
You might answer that you abstain from sex with partners that have not been tested for HIV,
or that you use condoms with new sexual partners. These are examples of effective methods that
when used correctly prevent or reduce transmission between people. With the coronavirus and
HIV, we highlight in Figure 1 mitigation strategies for these two viruses that are somewhat - albeit
not perfectly - analogous. On the one hand, both HIV and the coronavirus can be transmitted by
people who do not have any symptoms [3, 8, 9, 20], so that both viruses can be invisible threats.
On the other hand, the transmission routes for HIV are much more specific and intimate compared
with the transmission routes for the coronavirus. Nonetheless, we may be able to use what we have
learned in the past forty years fighting HIV and apply it to fight the novel coronavirus.
The good news is: we have very recently obtained a mathematical proof that an HIV-style
strategy could work [13]. As with all theoretical mathematics, there are certain caveats that should
be mentioned. First, the mathematical model in [13] is rooted in evolutionary game dynamics, that
assumes individuals are rational and act in their best self-interest. The model makes no predictions
for individuals who do not fit that description. Second, it is currently unknown whether or not
infection from the coronavirus and subsequent recovery grants long-term immunity [18, 19, 25]. Our

Figure 1. There are many similarities between HIV and the coronavirus, like the fact that both viruses
can be transmitted by people who show no symptoms. To fight these invisible enemies, effective mitigation
measures are also somewhat analogous. Of course, the analogy is far from perfect because these viruses are
also quite different. For example, the level of intimacy required to contract HIV compared to the coronavirus
is much greater. Nonetheless, we may be able to apply lessons from fighting HIV to battle our new enemy.
These mitigation measure analogies are only a few; there may be further analogous measures that have
escaped our attention.

model errs on the side of caution by making no assumption regarding long-term immunity; that is,
we assume that immunity is either not conferred or is short-lived.
2. The disease dilemma: to mitigate or not to mitigate, that is the question
Our mathematical model combines the epidemiological model for the spread of diseases that do
not grant lasting immunity together with the game theoretic model for predicting the evolution
of human behaviors according to the replicator equation [13]. The epidemiological compartmental
model is known as SIS (also known as SI) and has two compartments into which the population
is categorized: susceptible and infectious. The classical SIS model does not incorporate human
behavioral choices and changes, but human behavioral choices affect the spread of disease. People
can choose to change their usual behavior to include mitigation measures to reduce the transmission
rate [24]. Moreover, people are not stuck with their choice; they are free to change their behaviors
based on their perception of cost versus benefit. The World Health Organisation [6] and numerous
other references including [7, 14, 26] argue that it is reasonable to describe this situation with the
Prisonerâ€™s Dilemma (PD) as depicted in Figure 2.
In the context of coronavirus mitigation, research indicates that the most common transmission
route is airborne [5, 11, 15, 33], so that wearing a mask to prevent coronavirus transmission may be
compared to wearing a condom to prevent the transmission of sexually transmitted infections. We
therefore focus on the mask mitigation measure. Alice and Bob choose whether to cooperate, by
wearing a mask, or defect, by not wearing a mask. If Alice cooperates while Bob defects, then Alice
pays the cost of buying the mask, which is represented by âˆ’B < 0. Alice receives some protection
from her mask, represented by  > 0, but the main benefit is to everyone around Alice, similar to the
reason surgeons wear masks not to protect themselves but to protect the person on the operating
table [28]. Consequently, if Bob does not wear a mask, he pays no cost but receives a benefit of
T >  > 0. Aliceâ€™s total payoff is therefore âˆ’B + . Since the benefit to Alice is relatively small, we
assume that  < B. If both Alice and Bob cooperate, then they both pay the cost âˆ’B, but they
also receive the maximal protective benefit of T + , and their total payoffs are thus T âˆ’ B + .
Consequently, defining
C := B âˆ’ ,

the payoffs satisfy
S = âˆ’C < P = 0 < R < T = R + C.

(2.1)

This particular representation of the Prisonerâ€™s Dilemma is known as the Donor-Recipient game
and is given in normal form in Figure 2. To generalize the two player game to model interactions
within the entire population, the payoffs (2.1) are modified by a quantity N (k), where k is the
average number of social contacts each individual in the society has. Making a standard set of
simplifying assumptions as in [21, 22, 29â€“31], the payoffs R and P remain as in (2.1), whereas the
social network structure, that can be interpreted as peer pressure, now modifies the payoffs S and

(2.2) S = âˆ’C +N (k), T = R+C âˆ’N (k), N (k) :=

2.1. A dynamical system that combines disease spread with human behavior choices.
The hybrid SIS-PD dynamical system we obtained in [13] is

Ë™ = [1 âˆ’ x(t)]Î²D + x(t)Î²C I(t)(1 âˆ’ I(t)) âˆ’ Î³I(t),
(2.3)
I(t)
xÌ‡(t) = x(t)(1 âˆ’ x(t))[Î±1 (Î²D âˆ’ Î²C )I(t) âˆ’ Î±2 (C âˆ’ N (k))].

(2.4)

Above, the quantities on the left are differentiated with respect to time, t. The frequency of
cooperators in the population at time t is x(t), while the frequency of defectors is 1 âˆ’ x(t). The
positive quantities Î²C < Î²D are the rates of transmission for cooperators and defectors, respectively.
The rate at which infected individuals become susceptible again is Î³; if D is the average duration
of the infection, then Î³ = 1/D. The rate of infectious individuals in the population is I(t), and
1 âˆ’ I(t) is the rate of susceptible individuals in the population.
There are three timescales in the model: disease transmission, PD-payoff transmission, and information transmission. The timescale of disease transmission is t, while the PD-payoff timescale is
Î±2âˆ’1 t with Î±2 > 0. The timescale at which individuals receive disease-related information is |Î±1 |âˆ’1 t.
The parameter Î±1 may be positive, negative, or zero and describes the frequency and accuracy of
information disseminated about the disease. Large values of |Î±1 | correspond to frequent exposure to
information regarding the disease. When Î±1 > 0, this corresponds to accurate information recommending disease avoidance, whereas when Î±1 < 0, this corresponds to (mis)-information which may
suggest either the disease is harmless or that it is beneficial to contract the disease. For the sake of
brevity, we refer to [13] and related work by Poletti et. al [24] for the derivation and justification
of the system (2.3) and its ability to accurately represent the spread of disease combined with the
influence of human behavior choices.
It is a straightforward exercise to calculate all equilibrium points of the hybrid dynamical SIS-PD
system (2.3). The asymptotically stable equilibrium points are summarized in Table 1, with the
key values of the information timescale parameter Î±1 below
(2.5)

Î±ÌŒ1 :=

3. An HIV-style strategy to combat both the current and future pandemics
These results suggest a strategy to fight both diseases that do not to confer immunity as well as
new diseases, since it is unknowable whether contracting and recovering from a new disease grants
immunity [4]. Mathematically, the strategy is to aim for the equilibrium point with x = 1, and
I = 1 âˆ’ Î³/Î²C , that is obtained if Î±1 is sufficiently large, corresponding to frequent reminders of
effective mitigation measures. In the limit, x(t) % 1, so the entire population of rational individuals
acting in their best self interest cooperates. As mitigation measures become increasingly effective,
Î²C & Î³, so that rate of infectious individuals I(t) tends to zero. Of course, as we learned in analysis,
a limit may never actually be reached, but it can be approached. The strategy we suggest, aiming
for this limit, consists of two key steps.
Step 1: Study the new virus to understand its particular features and thereby identify effective
mitigation measures for this particular new virus. Mathematically, the goal is to determine measures
that minimize Î²C , the rate of transmission among cooperators.
Step 2: Raise public awareness of the dangers of the disease caused by the virus, similar to the
â€˜Grim Reaper Ad Campaignâ€™ used in Australia to fight HIV [1,2]. In the case of covid-19, the disease
caused by the coronavirus, healthy individuals are at risk of sustaining lung damage [32], brain and
neural system damage [10, 12, 23], organ damage [16], sterility [17], or the worst outcome, death.
Conclude the advertisement with a positive and empowering message: a clear explanation of the
effective mitigation measures. Mathematically, the ad campaign is used to increase the information
transmission parameter Î±1 , so that the unique stable equilibrium point in the dynamical system
(2.3) is that with x = 1, and I = 1 âˆ’ Î³/Î²C .
3.1. Concluding remarks: outsmarting viruses and evolving to a new normal. We have
learned to live with HIV and reduce the harm it causes by outsmarting the virus. If the predictions
of evolutionary game dynamics hold true, we can learn to live with coronavirus and reduce the harm
it causes by outsmarting it with a strategy in the same spirit as the strategy we use to manage HIV.
