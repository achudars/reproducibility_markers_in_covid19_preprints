Abstract
This paper investigates the impact of COVID-19 on financial markets. It focuses on the
evolution of the market efficiency, using two efficiency indicators: the Hurst exponent and
the memory parameter of a fractional Lévy-stable motion. The second approach combines, in
the same model of dynamic, an alpha-stable distribution and a dependence structure between
price returns. We provide a dynamic estimation method for the two efficiency indicators. This
method introduces a free parameter, the discount factor, which we select so as to get the
best alpha-stable density forecasts for observed price returns. The application to stock indices
during the COVID-19 crisis shows a strong loss of efficiency for US indices. On the opposite,
Asian and Australian indices seem less affected and the inefficiency of these markets during
the COVID-19 crisis is even questionable.

Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic has strongly affected many persons, either for medical reasons or for the
economic aftermath of the various prophylactic measures decided by governments, in particular
lockdowns. The evolution of financial markets during the pandemic provides an illustration of the
economic impact of these measures. According to several empirical studies, financial markets have
indeed been strongly disturbed during this period [3, 5, 34, 62]. The question of the reaction of
financial markets to a crisis is not specific to the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, we can cite a
study of the impact of crisis in the 80s and the 90s on a model of dynamic for a stock market [18].
In general, these studies focus on variations of several statistics, such as jump intensity, implied
volatility, parameters of factor models, divergence of price return densities, etc. To the best of
our knowledge, no paper focuses on measuring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on market
efficiency.
Market efficiency is the ability of market prices to reflect all the available information, so that no
arbitrage is possible. In other words, if markets are efficient, price returns are not correlated with

each other and investors are not able to statistically determine what is more profitable between
selling and buying a financial asset. Even if this dogma is sometimes questionable in calm periods,
we wonder if it can resist to a crisis. We also wonder if we can observe regional disparities,
hypothetically related to the magnitude of the outbreak in these regions, and how fast financial
markets recover.
The Hurst exponent is a widespread indicator of market efficiency. The long-range feature associated to a Hurst exponent above 1/2 is indeed traditionally interpreted as indicating predictability
of a time series. It is used in finance [51, 13, 56] but also in many other fields such as meteorology,
for models of temperature [19]. It is often related to a model of dynamic with a specific fractal property, namely the fractional Brownian motion (fBm), introduced by Mandelbrot and van Ness [54].
The fractal property states that the variance of increments of duration τ is τ 2H σ 2 , where H is the
Hurst exponent and σ 2 the variance of increments of duration 1. The fBm assumes that increments
follow a Gaussian distribution. The fractal property of the fBm is then obtained by introducing a
positive (respectively negative) correlation among increments if the Hurst exponent is above (resp.
below) 1/2. In the case where the Hurst exponent is 1/2, the fBm is simply a standard Brownian
motion (Bm), that is with independent increments. In the fBm framework, this value of the Hurst
exponent is thus the only one consistent with the efficient market hypothesis (EMH).
However, the approach using the fBm assumes Gaussian price returns. It is not very realistic,
since the presence of fat tails in the distribution of price returns is well documented [48, 60, 29].
As an alternative to the Gaussian distribution, the alpha-stable distribution is appealing because
it includes the Gaussian distribution as a particular case and entails fat tails, whose amplitude is
directly related to α, a parameter of this distribution. When combining alpha-stable distributions
and dependence between the successive price returns, we can get the fractional Lévy-stable motion
(fLsm), which is thus a non-Gaussian extension of the fBm [70, 73, 71]. In this framework, the
Hurst exponent is to be decomposed in m + 1/α, where m is a memory parameter. If m = 0,
adjacent price returns are independent and the market is efficient. We thus use this memory
parameter as an alternative efficiency indicator.
The estimation of the fLsm partly relies on the estimation of alpha-stable distributions. Many
estimation methods exist for this kind of distribution [2, 12]. In particular, we will focus on
McCulloch’s method, which is based on empirical quantiles [55]. In this paper, we are in addition
interested in the dynamic estimation of this distribution, because we want to depict the chronology
of the crisis, day after day. Several articles deal with the estimation of time-varying non-parametric
densities [38, 34]. The case of parametric densities is simpler as it consists in estimating timevarying parameters. In both the non-parametric and parametric cases, the estimation at a given
date takes into account the estimation at the previous date updated by the new observation. The
balance between the previous estimation and the new observation is tuned by a discount factor.
Several rules are possible for the selection of this free parameter. We focus on the minimization of
a criterion related to arguments coming from the field of validation of density forecast [34, 22].
In the empirical part of the paper, we study the evolution of the two indicators of market efficiency,
H and m for several stock indices, with a significance analysis. We have discovered that the Hurst
exponent H detects less often a market inefficiency than does the memory parameter m of an
fLsm. We foster the use of this parameter as efficiency indicator instead of the Hurst exponent.
It indeed improves the standard Hurst approach insofar as it filters the kurtosis of price returns,
which biases the Hurst indicator.
Besides the analysis of the impact of the COVID-19 on market efficiency, the innovative aspects of
this paper include a selection rule for the discount factor of a dynamic parametric distribution, an
estimation method of dynamic Hurst exponents, and the introduction of the memory parameter
of an fLsm as efficiency indicator.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the estimation of dynamic
alpha-stable distributions, along with the selection rule of the discount factor. Section 3 provides
some elements on market efficiency and details how indicators are built. Section 4 empirically
studies the impact of COVID-19 on market efficiency. Section 5 concludes.

Alpha-stable distributions

The alpha-stable distribution is a generalization of the Gaussian distribution, appreciated for entailing fat tails. For this reason, it has been widely invoked in signal processing [69, 32, 33], with
applications for example in medicine [68, 71] or in finance [48, 60, 29].
We present below the estimation of a time-varying alpha-stable distribution, which we will apply
later in this paper to financial time series. For this purpose, we present first the static estimation
as well as the various representations of alpha-stable distributions. Regarding the dynamic distribution, a free parameter is to be selected. It is the discount factor. We propose a rule of selection
in the last subsection.

2.1

Representation

Four parameters are used to depict a random variable following a stable distribution: X ∼
Sα (γ, β, µ). The parameter α ∈ (0, 2] is the one we will mostly be interested in. It determines the
thickness of the tails. The parameter β ∈ [−1, 1] is a skewness parameter. If α = 2 and β = 0, we
retrieve the Gaussian distribution. The last two parameters stand for the location (µ ∈ R) and the
scale (γ > 0) of the distribution. We do not have any analytic expression for the probability density
of X, but we can characterize the stable distribution by the mean of its characteristic function:



if α 6= 1
exp iµt − γ α |t|α 1 − iβsign(t) tan πα
2

t 7→ E [exp (itX)] =
exp iµt − γ|t| 1 + iβsign(t) π2 log |t|
if α = 1.
We could use the Fourier transform to get the pdf from the characteristic function [68], but the
above parameterization is not totally satisfactory insofar as the pdf is not continuous in the parameters, in particular when α = 1 [59, 2]. Indeed, when β > 0, the density is shifted right when
α < 1 and left when α > 1, with a shift toward +∞ (respectively −∞) when α tends toward 1
by below (resp. above) [59]. For applications to data and interpretation of the coefficients, this
parameterization is thus to be avoided. For this reason, Nolan has proposed to use Zolotarev’s
(M) parameterization [76], which is also often called the S 0 parameterization. The characteristic
function corresponding to X ∼ Sα0 (γ, β, µ0 ) is [59, 2]:

t 7→ E [exp (itX)] =
exp iµ0 t − γ|t| 1 + iβsign(t) π2 (log |t| + log γ)
if α = 1.

This alternative parameterization is not far from the Sα one. The only difference is about the
location parameter, which, in this new setting, corrects the shift exposed above for values of α
close to 1:

A Fourier transform makes it possible to get the pdf of a standard variable Sα0 (1, β, 0) [59]:

We also obtain the pdf of a variable X ∼ Sα0 (γ, β, µ0 ) with γ 6= 1 and µ0 6= 0, by the mean
of a translation, a scaling, and the substitution s = γt, starting from the characteristic function
provided in equation (1):

The formula of p contains an integral on an unbounded interval. For this reason, other formulations
have been proposed [2, 50, 42, 12]. However, in the application to financial series, we find values
of α far from 0, so that the truncated integral converges rapidly. We also get the corresponding
cdf by numerically integrating f (x; α, γ, β, µ0 ).

2.2

Estimation

Many estimation methods of stable distributions exist [2, 12]. Some of them focus on the sole
α parameter, using for instance a regression of extreme quantiles along with the extreme value
theory [37]. Other methods make it possible to estimate all the parameters. In this class of methods,
we can cite the estimation using L-moments, provided that α > 1 [2, 39], empirical quantiles [55],
the empirical characteristic function [66, 61, 45, 44, 71], and the maximum likelihood method [23].
This last method relies on the knowledge of the pdf, which may be approximated as exposed in
the previous subsection, using Nolan’s work [59].
We focus on the method using empirical quantiles, which has been introduced first by Fama and
Roll, with the following assumptions: α > 1, β = 0, and µ = 0 [26]. This method is asymptotically biased. McCulloch proposed an extended version of the method, in which he corrected the
asymptotic bias [55]. This version is also less restrictive with respect to the parameters, insofar as
it only requires to have α ≥ 0.6.
The McCulloch’s method consists in linking the four parameters to five empirical quantiles of probability levels 5%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 95%. To this end, we first have to define two intermediate
quantities:
Q(0.95) − Q(0.05)
vα =
Q(0.75) − Q(0.25)
and
vβ =

Q(0.95) + Q(0.05) − 2Q(0.50)
,
Q(0.95) − Q(0.05)

where Q(p) is the theoretical quantile of probability p for a Sα (γ, β, µ) variable [55, 2, 12]. Neither
vα nor vβ depend on γ and µ, so that α and β are functions of vα and vβ : α = φ1 (vα , vβ ) and
β = φ2 (vα , vβ ). In practice, φ1 and φ2 are provided by tables [55]. Replacing the theoretical
b
quantiles Q(p) by empirical quantiles Q(p),
we get estimators vbα for vα and vbβ for vβ , as well as
the following estimators for α and β:

α
b = φ1 (b
vα , vbβ )
βb = φ2 (b
vα , vbβ ).

The estimation of γ and µ relies on two other intermediate quantities which only depend on the
already estimated α and β. For simplicity, we introduce the variable ζ defined by:

if α 6= 1
µ + βγ tan πα

(3)

if α = 1.
The intermediate quantities are:
vγ =

Q(0.75) − Q(0.25)
γ

and
vζ =

ζ − Q(0.50)
.
γ

They are such that vγ = φ3 (α, β) and vζ = φ4 (α, β). Their estimators vbγ and vbζ are obtained by
replacing the quantiles by empirical ones. We thus have the following estimators for γ and ζ:
(
b

b = Q(0.75)−Q(0.25)
b
φ3 (b

b + Q(0.50).

ζb = γ

The deduction of the estimator of µ from ζb is straightforward using equation (3), as well as the
version µ0 of the location parameter in the parameterization S 0 using equation (2). In particular
µ
b0 = ζb as soon as α 6= 1.

2.3

Dynamic estimation

The time-varying adaptation of McCulloch’s estimation technique amounts to estimating timevarying quantiles. Indeed, if we are able to infer dynamic quantiles Qt (p), the first two McCulloch
statistics are defined in a dynamic fashion:
(
t (0.95)−Qt (0.05)
vα,t = Q
Qt (0.75)−Qt (0.25)
vβ,t

=

Qt (0.95)+Qt (0.05)−2Qt (0.50)
,
Qt (0.95)−Qt (0.05)

so that we get time-varying α and β parameters. Time-varying quantiles make it also possible
to define the last two McCulloch statistics and finally to fully estimate a dynamic alpha-stable
probability distribution.
The subject of estimating dynamic quantiles is largely handled by the econometric literature. The
favoured appraoch is based on quantile autoregression [43, 20, 35], like in the application to valueat-risk known as CAViaR [24]. A drawback of quantile regression is that different quantiles may
cross: the monotonicity of quantiles is not necessarily preserved. The dynamic additive quantile,
while keeping the autoregressive approach, deals with this limitation [36].
However, all the quantile autoregressions are based on a model of dynamic and we prefer to
introduce a method in which we do not specify the evolution of quantiles with respect to previously
estimated ones. The inspiration of such a model-free approach comes from the non-parametric
statistics literature, in which we can estimate for example time-varying moments or even timevarying probability densities [38]. In this approach, close to an exponentially weighting moving
average (EWMA), for each new observation, the weight of past observations is discounted at a
constant rate, whereas the new observation is provided with the highest weight. The rationale
is the following: the more recent the observation, the more likely its future occurrence. In the

5

EWMA approach, the average At , estimated at time t, incorporates the average estimated at time
t − 1 and the new observation at time t, Xt , in the following manner:
At = ωAt−1 + (1 − ω)Xt ,

(4)

where ω ∈ (0, 1] is the discount factor. The higher ω, the more stable the series At . We can also
interpret equation (4) in a probabilistic perspective, that is by considering that weights are probabilities. Indeed, At−1 is a weighted average of observations till time t − 1, and it is a mathematical
expectation under a specific probability if the sum of the weights is equal to 1. If we suppose it
is the case for the statistic At−1 , then the probability associated in At to each past observation is
multiplied by ω, and is thus globally equal to ω, whereas the new observation has the probability
complementary to 1, that is 1 − ω. We thus have an underlying probability distribution at each
time t, which associates the probability pω
t,i to the i-th observation, for 1 ≤ i ≤ t:
pω
t,i =

1 − ω t−i
ω .
1 − ωt

t−i
For ω 6= 1 and big values of t, ω t is close to zero and we have the approximation pω
.
t,i ≈ (1 − ω)ω

From these updating probabilities, it is possible to estimate time-varying kernel densities [38] but
also time-varying quantiles. These dynamic quantiles may rely on the dynamic kernel densities
but we prefer to work here with simple empirical quantiles, in order to avoid the complexity of
estimating dynamic kernel densities [74, 38]. For extreme quantiles, the algorithmic complexity of
our method is less than linear with respect to the number of observations considered at each date.

2.4

Selection of the discount factor

The above dynamic estimation of quantiles and of the parameters of stable distributions relies on
a free parameter, the discount factor ω, which depicts how fast the dynamic distribution evolves.
If ω is close to 1, the distribution is almost constant. If ω is lower, the evolution of the distribution
is faster and the description of the last observations will be more accurate. Nevertheless, this
accuracy may be excessive and the evolution of the distribution may be non-significant. Indeed, in
the extreme situation where ω is close to zero, the distribution will be very narrow and centered
on the last observation, with a big divergence between two successive distributions. In order to
find a good balance between accuracy and robustness, we decide to select the ω maximizing the
ability of the density fbtω estimated at date t to forecast the density of Xt+1 , the price return at
time t + 1.
Several definitions of what a good density forecast is are possible. Indeed, the true density at time
t + 1 is never observed, so that we can only rely on one observation drawn in this density. In
the non-parametric literature about time-varying densities, we find for instance a selection rule for
the free parameter of the densities based on the maximization of a likelihood criterion [38]. We
think that this criterion does not take properly into account the possibility of the occurrence of
extreme events. The alternative solution we follow is based on an adaptation of a method coming
from the literature of density forecast evaluation [34]. Indeed, even if fbtω varies with t, so that
we are provided with only one observation in this distribution, a simple transformation of each
price return defines a distribution which remains the same through time. This transformation is
7

the probability integral transform (PIT), usually introduced in the perspective of density forecast
evaluation [22]:
ω
Ztω = Fbt−1
(Xt ),
(6)
ω
ω
where Fbt−1
is the cdf corresponding to fbt−1
. In this literature, two conditions are required for the
ω
PITs: the Zt must follow a uniform distribution in [0, 1] and they must be independent from each
other.

The translation of these rules to the selection of free parameters in density estimation leads to two
properties regarding ω [34]:
. uniformity of the PITs Ztω0 , ..., ZTω : ω is to be selected so as to minimize the divergence
between their empirical distribution and a uniform distribution,
. independence of the PITs: ω is to be selected so as to minimize the discrepancy, that is,
for each subinterval of [t0 , T ] of size greater than a threshold ν, the divergence between
the empirical distribution of the corresponding PITs and a uniform distribution is to be
minimized.
In the perspective of the selection of a free parameter of a time-varying distribution, we can define
the above divergence as a Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic with an adaptation to compare directly
divergences of distributions estimated on samples of different sizes [34]. Moreover, the minimal
size ν of the subintervals considered is intended to be a threshold above which the asymptotic
framework required by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic is satisfied. We consider ν = 22 days, so
that we expect the PITs to be uniform for scales larger than one month. As a consequence, the
criterion to be minimized is:

whereas the sorted PIT Zρ(u;s,t)
is the theoretical uniform cdf. Finally, the optimal discount factor
is defined as the solution of the following equation:

ω ? = argmin dν (Ztω0 +1 , ..., ZTω ).

We can easily apply the above method to the case of an alpha-stable distribution. We only have to
pay attention to the definition of the PIT in equation (6). Indeed, it relies on the cdf, which does not
follow a simple expression for alpha-stable distributions. Nevertheless, as exposed in Subsection 2.1,
numerical methods make it possible to calculate both the pdf and the cdf of an alpha-stable
ω
distribution. Therefore, the estimated cdf x 7→ Fbt−1

Market efficiency

The market efficiency is a usual assumption in finance, which is in particular invoked when pricing
derivatives. The EMH states that asset price series follow a random walk [25]. Investors and market
8

makers update their expectations and their quotes at each instant, using the available information,
so that it is not possible to beat the market. The EMH is convenient, because working with
independent price returns makes the financial mathematics easier. But practitioners know that
the EMH is not very realistic. The asset management industry in general aims at performing
statistical arbitrages, whatever the transaction time scale, whether it is less than a second or more
than a month. Maybe the asset manager will not win at each time, but in average he should win.
Standard models relying on the EMH, such as the widespread geometric Brownian motion, are not
consistent with the existence of statistical arbitrages.
We can also stress other unrealistic components of the EMH, such as the availability of the same
information for every investor and market maker, as well as the rationality of all the agents, or the
fact that we can substitute two assets provided that they are equally risky. Several alternatives to
the EMH aim at describing more realistically the financial markets. It is the case of the fractal
market hypothesis [65] and of the adaptive market hypothesis (AMH) [53]. The AMH is a good
compromise between the standard EMH and the reality of statistical arbitrage. It states that a
model can predict the market in average. But such a model can provide investors with performing
forecasts during a limited time only, because other investors and market makers will progressively
adapt their own models and decisions to this performing model. The AMH thus leads to a long-term
efficiency of the market and allows statistical arbitrages for small time scales only.
Besides, it is worth noting that the price series of some assets are not far from the EMH. It is
the case for major stock indices. But empirical studies show that these indices have fluctuating
efficiency and may encounter a loss of efficiency during financial crisis [1, 52]. Since the decisions
of market makers and investors may not be the same if markets are efficient or if they aren’t, it
is important for them to determine from time series of prices whether the markets are efficient or
not. We can cite many statistical indicators of market efficiency [67]. Some of them look for a
predictability of price returns [17], using for example the amplitude of the parameters of a timevarying AR model [41, 58]. Other indicators measure a deviation from a random walk, using for
example variance ratios [15] or a combination of several statistics such as fractal dimension and
entropy [47, 46]. But the most widespread indicator of market efficiency seems to be the Hurst
exponent [51, 13, 56, 28].
The Hurst exponent is an indicator of long-range memory. Mandelbrot and van Ness introduced
the fBm as a model consistent with a given Hurst exponent and extending the standard Bm by
making the increments dependent on each other [54]. For this reason, the fBm is a popular model
in finance, provided that practitioners do not want to comply with the EMH. In the fBm, the
Hurst exponent H is also linked to the fractal property of the series, insofar as the variance of the
increments of duration τ is τ 2H times the variance of increments of duration 1. Some estimators
of the Hurst exponent use this fractal property instead of the long-range memory. However, given
the fractal property estimated on the dataset, the fBm is not the only possible model. Other
models may indeed have the same estimated Hurst exponent as the fBm but, relying on another
specification, they may lead to other conclusions regarding the dependence of the increments and
thus regarding the efficiency of the markets. This fact has been documented for instance for
foreign exchange rates, for which the stationarity of the time series biases the estimation of the
Hurst exponent in the perspective of an fBm [30, 31]. Indicators of market efficiency should not
bypass the diversity of models featuring a fractal property and consistent with the estimated Hurst
exponent. Extensions of the fBm include some specificities for the Hurst exponent: it may vary
deterministically through time, as in the multifractional Brownian motion [63, 8, 16, 28], it may
be a random process, as in the multifractional process with random exponent [4, 11, 27, 29], or it
may even be asymmetric [14, 72].
In what follows, after a presentation of the Hurst exponent in the perspective of the fBm, we will
focus on a model in which increments are not necessarily Gaussian. In this framework, the fLsm is a
9

natural extension of the fBm, in which increments follow an alpha-stable distribution [73, 75, 71, 29].
The fractal property of this process takes into account both the dependence between increments
and the tail parameter of the alpha-stable distribution. This model thus makes it possible to
disentangle the kurtosis of price returns and the efficiency of the market. It provides us with richer
information than the sole Hurst exponent. This refinement is not superfluous. We will indeed see
in the empirical section that the conclusions regarding the efficiency of stock indices are not the
same if we consider the Hurst exponent or the fLsm-based indicator of market efficiency.

3.1

Hurst exponents

The Hurst exponent was originally introduced by Harold Edwin Hurst as an indicator of longrange memory that could be obtained thanks to the rescaled range (R/S) analysis [40]. Later,
alternative estimation methods appeared, such as the detrended fluctuation analysis [64], or the
absolute-moment method [8, 7, 9, 28], which is related to the notion of generalized Hurst exponent
(GHE) [6, 21]. The absolute-moment method is a method mainly used by the community of
statisticians of stochastic processes, because, contrary to the R/S analysis, it is strongly related to
a stochastic process, namely the fBm.
The fBm is a generalization of the standard Bm. Increments of the fBm are Gaussian, since the
fBm is a fractional integral or a fractional derivative of a Bm, Wt [54]:

BH (t) =

Γ H + 2 −∞
The two parameters of the fBm are the Hurst exponent H, and the volatility parameter σ. If
H = 1/2, the fBm is a Bm. If H > 1/2 (respectively H < 1/2), the fBm is the fractional integral
(resp. fractional derivative) of order H −1/2 (resp. 1/2−H) of a Bm; increments are thus positively
(resp. negatively) correlated.
The absolute-moment method uses another definition of the fBm, which is consistent with the
integral form provided above. Indeed, an fBm is also the only zero-mean Gaussian process, with
zero at the origin, such that, for s, t ≥ 0:
E{BH (t)BH (s)} =

σ 2 2H
(|t| + |s|2H − |t − s|2H ).
2

From this covariance, we get the self-similarity property:
E{|BH (t) − BH (s)|k } = σ 2 |t − s|kH ,
for k > 0. This property states that the k-order absolute moment of the increments of duration
|t − s| is proportional to |t − s|kH . Comparing two scales thus makes it possible to estimate H. If
we focus on an order k = 2 and on the two smallest scales, we indeed get the following estimator,
for a time series of log-prices X1 , X2 , ..., Xt [28]:

which converges almost surely toward H [8, 7].
We could use this estimator of H as an indicator of market efficiency. But, we are mostly interested
here in evaluating the evolution of market efficiency through time. We need therefore a time-varying
version of this estimator. This question is not new and the solution put forward in the literature
10

is often based on the estimation in sliding windows [16, 10], possibly with a smoothing of the raw
series of Hurst exponents as a post-processing [28]. But we prefer a method more consistent with
the smoothing applied above for estimating the parameters of a distribution, that is in the manner
of an EWMA, insofar as it overweights more recent observations and is thus a more relevant picture
of the current state of the market. The closest method in the literature is a time-varying GHE using
the EWMA [57]. The main difference with the method we propose is that the GHE is always based
on a linear regression of log-absolute moments of increments on several log time scales. Contrary
to the GHE, we focus on only two scales, so that we get a simpler closed-form estimator:

addressed. We could imagine to adapt the method exposed in section 2.4 to the case of an fBm.
But it sounds more relevant to use the same discount factor for all the statistics of our work. We
will thus simply use the discount factor chosen for estimating the time-varying stable distribution.

3.2

Fractional Lévy-stable motion

The fLsm is a generalization of the fBm in which increments follow an alpha-stable distribution,
which admits the Gaussian distribution as a particular case. The fLsm is defined as the fractional
integral or fractional derivative of a symmetric Lévy-stable motion [70, 73, 71]:

In other words, increments follow a symmetric stable law and, if and only if H − 1/α > 0, nonoverlapping increments are positively dependent, that is with a positive codifference or a positive
covariation [49]. The parameter H controls the scaling behaviour of the process, in the same
manner as in the fBm, and the parameter α controls the thickness of the tails. The lower α, the
fatter the tails. If α = 2, increments are Gaussian and the fLsm is an fBm. When comparing an
fBm and an fLsm, the fractal feature of the latter is not obtained only by adjusting the dependence
of the increments but, in addition, by tuning the kurtosis of the underlying law. Therefore, we can
write the Hurst exponent as the combination of a tail component, 1/α, and a memory parameter,
m:

H = + m.

In this framework, the Hurst exponent is not the most relevant indicator of market efficiency and
one should instead use m. As we have proposed time-varying estimators both for α and for H, we
write the following time-varying estimator for m:

Empirical study

We apply the above method to ten stock indices of various regions: USA (S&P 500, S&P 100),
Europe (EURO STOXX 50, Euronext 100, DAX, CAC 40), Asia (Nikkei, KOSPI, SSE 180), and
Australia (S&P/ASX 200). We have used data from Yahoo finance in the time interval between
the 1st May 2015 and the 29th June 2020. The first date at which we estimate stable densities
and the parameters of an fBm and an fLsm, that is t0 , is the 1st November 2019. The period of
study includes the financial crisis sparked by the COVID-19 pandemic.
We first determine for each stock index the optimal discount factor ω as in equation (8). The results
are displayed in Table 1. We observe that the optimal discount factors are close to 0.95, whatever
the index considered. For the rest of the empirical study, we consider a common discount factor
ω m , so that we can make fair comparisons between stock indices. We choose ω m = 0.956, which is
the highest optimal discount factor measured for the various stock indices. This conservative choice
limits the risk of providing a new observation with a too high weight in the dynamic estimators.
A lower value could lead to spurious conclusions regarding the market efficiency for some stock
indices.

Table 1: Optimal discount factor ω ? for several stock indices for stable
densities between November 2019 and June 2020.
Using ω m , we are able to determine the dynamic pdf of daily price returns. We display in Figure 1
these densities for four stock indices corresponding to regions with a different timing in the growth
of the outbreak: S&P 500, the French CAC 40, the Chinese SSE 180, and the S&P/ASX 200
indices. For each of these indices, we plot the pdf before the crisis, in November 2019, at the peak
of the crisis, and a the end of our sample, late June 2020. The peak of the crisis is not the same
for all the indices. We define the peak date as the one leading to the maximal value for |m|. This
12

date is in March for the four indices. Exact dates are provided in Table 3. For the four indices, the
pdf at the peak shows fat tails and asymmetry. Late June, the pdf still has these features, except
for SSE 180 index, for which the pdf is very similar to the one before the crisis, indicating a very
fast recovery in China. The case of CAC 40 at the peak is also of interest, because the advent of
fat tails and asymmetry is so abrupt that it does not crush the body of the pdf, contrary to other
indices.

In this paper, we are mostly interested in determining whether the financial markets are efficient
during a financial crisis. For this purpose, we have introduced two indicators. The first one is the
widespread Hurst exponent, estimated here in a dynamic fashion as exposed in Section 3.1. But
the Hurst exponent H provided above is an indicator of dependence between price returns only if
these price returns are Gaussian. In a more general framework, if we consider the possibility of
fat tails by the mean of an alpha-stable distribution, we define another efficiency indicator by the
memory parameter m of an fLsm, as exposed in Section 3.2. In the first approach, the market is
efficient for H = 1/2. In the second approach, which is more accurate because it takes into account
the kurtosis of price returns thanks to the α parameter, the market is efficient for m = 0. The null
hypothesis H0 is the efficiency of each market. In order to know for which threshold of efficiency
indicator we can reject H0 with a given confidence p, we perform a simulation. We consider that
13

the right price model corresponding to H0 is a geometric Bm. We thus simulate a time series
following this model. The length of the simulated series used for estimating the first parameters
in t0 is the same as in our financial dataset. We then simulate 4,000 other dates. For each of these
dates, we estimate H, m, and α dynamically, using the discount factor ω m . We consider that the
bounds of the confidence interval with confidence level p, for the estimated H, m, and α, are the
empirical quantiles of the corresponding parameters, estimated on the simulations, for probabilities
(1 − p)/2 and (1 + p)/2.
We display the time-varying Hurst exponent in Figure 2 for the four focal stock indices of our study.
Before the crisis, which begins in February or March with respect to the region, the Hurst exponent
is not significantly different from 1/2, so that we cannot reject H0 during this period. During the
crisis, we observe very low Hurst exponents for the S&P 500 index which make it possible to reject
H0 with a confidence of more than 99%. But for the three other indices, the drawdown of the
Hurst exponent is much less significant, in particular for the SSE 180 index. According to this
approach, the market becomes clearly inefficient if we consider the S&P 500 index, whereas we
cannot ascertain the inefficiency of the three other indices. It is also worth noting that after a peak
downward, the Hurst exponent reaches abnormally high values for the French and the Australian
indices. It suggests a persistence of the crisis: a short mean-reverting phenomenon followed by
positively correlated price returns.

(bottom left), and SSE 180 (bottom right) indices. The grey lines are
the bounds of simulated confidence intervals with a confidence level
of 95%, 99%, and 99.5%.
If we consider another indicator of market efficiency, namely the memory parameter m of an
14

fLsm, the conclusions regarding the impact of COVID-19 on the market efficiency are not the
same. In Figure 3, we observe first that m is in general negative, even before the crisis. It
indicates a dominating mean-reversion phenomenon in the stock markets. But it is in fact often
not significantly different from 0. When the crisis occurs, m goes downward and H0 is rejected
with a confidence higher than 99%, whatever the stock index. The most significant drawdown of
m is again for the S&P 500 index. The duration of the significant inefficiency varies among the
indices. The longer period is for the S&P 500 index. The S&P/ASX 200 has a very short period
of inefficiency.

of an fLsm for S&P 500 (top left), CAC 40 (top right), S&P/ASX 200
(bottom left), and SSE 180 (bottom right) indices. The grey lines are
the bounds of simulated confidence intervals with a confidence level
of 95%, 99%, and 99.5%.
It is also interesting to track another important parameter of the fLsm, namely α, which depicts the
size of the tails of the distribution of price returns. When α = 2, the price returns follow a Gaussian
distribution. The lower α, the fatter the tails. For the American, French, and Australian indices,
we observe in Figure 4 a negative impact of the crisis on α. It means that extreme events tend
to occur more frequently and with a larger magnitude. This stylized fact is confirmed by another
approach relying on non-parametric densities [34]. The evolution of α in the Chinese market is
not similar to the three other indices and the values reached are less significantly different from
2. A progressive recovery toward high values of α is visible for the CAC 40 and the S&P/ASX
200 indices. For the S&P 500 index, we also observe an abrupt increase of α after the peak of the
crisis, but it is of limited amplitude and α remains at a fairly low value.
We display in Tables 2 and 3 the range of values reached during the period by the two efficiency

indicators, H and m, for the ten stock indices considered. These tables confirm that the greatest
impact of COVID-19 on market efficiency occurred for US indices, whatever the efficiency indicator.
We also note that inefficiency always leads to negative values of m. Indeed, the observed upper
bounds in the period are never significantly different from 0. On the contrary, for the Hurst
exponent, we find downward peaks below 1/2 as well as upward peaks above 1/2, so that it is
unclear whether inefficiency leads to high or low values for H. In fact, the presence of fatter tails
during the crisis biases this efficiency indicator. So, focusing on the m indicator, we find fairly
synchronized peaks for indices of the same region: on 10th March 2020 in the USA, on 16th March
2020 in Europe. Other regions seem less affected: the maximal |m| is indeed lower in Asia and
Australia. However, the biased H indicator suggests a similar loss of efficiency in Europe and
in Asia. This underpins again the relevance of the refinement of the efficiency indicator to take
into account the kurtosis. The two efficiency indicators also lead to opposite conclusions when
considering the situation at the end of the sample: according to H, markets are efficient again
everywhere, whereas they are significantly inefficient in the USA and in Japan according to m.

Conclusion

We have shown to which extent the stock markets become inefficient during the COVID-19 crisis.
The efficiency is clearly rejected in the case of the S&P index. On the contrary, the Hurst exponent
does not make it possible to conclude about a loss of efficiency for the CAC 40, SSE 180, and
S&P/ASX 200 indices. However, we have highlighted a limitation of this indicator: it does not
take into account the dynamic kurtosis of price returns. Therefore, if we use the more appropriate
memory parameter of an fLsm, we observe the occurrence of an inefficiency period almost at the
beginning of the crisis, even though it is less noticeable for the Chinese and the Australian indices.
We have also introduced in this paper the tools used for this analysis, namely the estimation of a
dynamic stable distribution along with the estimation of the dynamic Hurst exponent and memory
parameter of an fLsm. An important free parameter in this approach is the discount factor which
is related to the speed at which the weight of past information decreases. We have used a selection
rule based on the minimization of a criterion depicting the uniformity and the independence of the
PITs, consistently with the literature on the validation of density forecasts.
