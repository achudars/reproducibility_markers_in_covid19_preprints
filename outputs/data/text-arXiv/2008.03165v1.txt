Abstract
We present two different approaches for modeling the spread of the COVID-19
pandemic. Both approaches are based on the population classes susceptible, exposed,
infectious, quarantined, and recovered and allow for an arbitrary number of subgroups
with different infection rates and different levels of testing. The first model is derived
from a set of ordinary differential equations that incorporate the rates at which
population transitions take place among classes. The other is a particle model, which is
a specific case of crowd simulation model, in which the disease is transmitted through
particle collisions and infection rates are varied by adjusting the particle velocities. The
parameters of these two models are tuned using information on COVID-19 from the
literature and country-specific data, including the effect of restrictions as they were
imposed and lifted. We demonstrate the applicability of both models using data from
Cyprus, for which we find that both models yield very similar results, giving confidence
in the predictions.

Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic is a new disease and there is as yet not enough understanding
on its future evolution. Since medical interventions, such as vaccines or antiviral
treatments, are not available yet, non-medical interventions are being implemented to
contain the disease. In a number of countries, including Cyprus, the imposed
restrictions have helped slow down the spread of the disease. Cyprus, being an island
country, managed to limit the spread of the disease, by imposing restrictions on air
travel and shutting down large parts of the economy, ultimately achieving 2.2 deaths per
100,000 population, a death rate comparable to that of Greece and Malta [1, 2].
However, as restrictions are being lifted, it is important to know how the disease in each
country will evolve. Reliable predictions will help policy-makers to formulate
appropriate intervention strategies, while taking into account also economic and social
factors. Mathematical models and numerical simulation can be used as a decision
support tool to assist policy-makers, by forecasting the spread of the disease as a
function of the lifting of restrictions as well as on the level of testing and contact
tracing [3–12]. Since the epidemic spreading is a complex process depending to a large

extent both on the behavior of the virus [4, 5] and human interactions [6, 7], the purpose
of this work is to provide such predictions for a number of scenarios using two models.
While these models are applicable to any country, they are calibrated for the specific
case of Cyprus for which such forecasting is not available.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, a number of mathematical epidemiological models
have been used to predict the spread of the disease in a number of countries (e.g.
Refs. [3, 7–10]) and regions (e.g., Refs. [11, 12]). Typically, the predictions are made
within a single type of model. In this work, we use two models, each relying on different
methodologies, to cross-check predictions.
1. Compartmental models based on ordinary differential equations (ODEs). These
models describe how portions of the population transition among classes or
compartments via ODEs. For example, the classical SIR model describes the
evolution of three compartments, the susceptible, infected, and removed [13], with
two parameters that model the rates at which the population transfers from one
compartment to the other. In the present study, our objective is to derive a model
that is suitable for countries like Cyprus, where data typically used for modeling
COVID-19, such as of hospitalizations, intubation, and deaths, are too small for a
meaningful data-driven analysis. We therefore use a time-dependent infection rate
and detection rate, with which we are able to capture the reported cases in
Cyprus without needing to revert to models with a large number of parameters
relying on data that are scarce or not available.
2. Particle model. Such models belong to the broader class of crowd
simulation/agent-based models, which track the evolution of the interactions of
agents in time and space. Here, particle dynamics and interactions are used as a
proxy of human social interactions, allowing the transmission of the disease
through particle collisions, naturally introducing an element of randomness in the
system. This approach is reminiscent of the equivalent of network models and
stochastic-branching processes, which is often used to model disease outbreaks.
Such models are computationally demanding and an efficient code will be
employed in order to simulate the whole population of Cyprus residing in cities,
where most of the COVID-19 cases are registered.
The main goal of the study is to examine the predictive power of the above models for
the COVID-19 case. We demonstrate that both models describe quite accurately the
existing data and yield very similar predictions for the evolution of the disease as
measures are imposed and lifted once these are calibrated to the same data. More
importantly, we examine whether such models predict the future evolution of COVID-19
for countries like Cyprus for a number of different scenaria as the economy reopens and
in relation to the ability of the health care services to detect and isolate future cases
through contact tracing and aggressive testing. One of the key highlights of this study
is that, although these models are based on different approaches, they both yield
consistent predictions.
The structure of the paper is as follows: In Sec. 2 we introduce the two models and
describe how we tune the parameters, adjusting them to the specific case of Cyprus. In
Sec. 3 we discuss the results of the models and in Sec. 4 we give our conclusions and
future plans.

Description of the models

We describe here the two models and how their parameters are tuned. There is presently
a plethora of models of varying degrees of complexity and sophistication, depending on

August 10, 2020

the wealth of data available. For example, for larger populations, where naturally the
death toll is higher, modeling approaches may be effectively used to capture the
evolution of the number of deceased [14–16]. For smaller countries, however, like Cyprus
with a small number of deaths, the applicability of e.g. statistical models that focus on
extracting multitude of parameters from the recorded deaths [3] may be questionable.
Here we propose an approach that uses a minimal set of fitting parameters. To model
COVID-19 evolution one needs to make certain assumptions. In our modeling we use
some common features that are also being applied in a number of other studies that are
currently being applied to COVID-19 [3, 7–10]. Namely, we consider that
i The disease consists of two phases: (a) an exposed phase during which an individual
contracts the disease but has no symptoms and does not transmit the disease to
others; (b) an infectious phase, during which individuals transmit the disease to
susceptible members of the population.
ii A portion of the exposed individuals who ultimately become infectious is detected.
We take this portion to be a function of time depending on the level of screening
and testing being performed.
iii The detected cases are assumed to be immediately quarantined, so that the spread
of the virus is attributed solely to the undetected cases.
iv The population is divided in five classes; the susceptible, exposed, quarantined,
infectious, and removed; i.e. an SEIQR type of model.
v The removed class includes individuals who (a) recover or (b) die due to the disease
and we do not differentiate among these subclasses. In addition, the quarantined
class is modeled in the same way as the removed class, but tracked independently
as a function of time.
vi The average duration of the exposed latent period is constant.
vii The average duration of the infectious period is constant.
viii A key feature of our modeling is that we take the rate of infection/transmission to
be a function of time, reflecting the measures implemented by the government in
regards to social distancing, limitations of travel, and suspending parts of the
economy.
For the infectious period, we rely on recent data that estimate it to be 7-12 days. 1 .
We therefore fix the infectious period (τi ) to 10 days and the exposed period (τe ) to
2 days.
These modeling features are kept the same for both our models. Further extensions
of the models could include, for example, assigning a probability of the quarantined
population to infect, a delay between the time an infectious individual is quarantined, or
defining additional groups within the classes which would however introduce more
parameters. While such extensions of the models may be considered in the future as
more data become available, we opt to evaluate here our models with the least possible
parameters, which as will be seen in Sec. 3 are sufficient to describe the current data.

2.1

Compartmental model

Extending the original SIR model of Kermack and McKendrick [13] to include an
Exposed and a Quarantined class, the following coupled system of ODEs arises, which is
in alignment with the assumptions introduced earlier:

(1e)

where S(t), E(t), I(t), Q(t), and R(t) capture, respectively, the evolution of the
susceptible, exposed, infected, quarantined, and removed classes of the population as a
function of time t. We will refer to this extended model as the SEIQR model. The
parameter β > 0 corresponds to the infection rate in inverse time units, which is a
measure of the average number of contacts an infective individual makes in a wholly
susceptible population that may lead to an infection per unit time, τi > 0 and τe > 0 are
the average times an individual remains in the infective and exposed classes respectively.
The portion of undetected cases who later infect others is given by r and N is the total
population (assuming no vital dynamics, namely births or deaths due to other causes).
Central to the standard SIR and SEIQR models is the modeling of the rates at
which individuals transition between population classes. Both the SIR and SEIQR
models assume that the times for which individuals remain in the exposed and
infectious states are exponentially distributed random variables [17], which implies that
the chance of an individual moving out of the exposed and recovered classes is
independent of the time they entered the particular class. This leads to dispersed
timescales, which manifests itself, for example, in unrealistically long recovery times for
the number of individuals that got infected towards the end of an epidemic and in
overoptimistic predictions of the levels of control required to contain the epidemic [18].
A more general approach assigns arbitrary probability distributions for the recovery and
latent times. This yields a system of integral–differential equations of the form

S(t) + E(t) + I(t) + R(t) = N,

(2e)

where PI (t) and PE (t) are non-increasing functions that correspond to the probabilities
of remaining infectious or quarantined and exposed t units after becoming infectious or
quarantined and exposed, respectively with PI (0) = PE (0) = 1 (see [17] for a related
model). In each of Eqs. (2a–c), the first terms correspond to the respective initial

populations in a class that remain in the same class after t time units, whereas the
second terms correspond to the sum of individuals who become members of a class
within the time interval [0, t]. Eq. (2d) captures the transfer of the infectious and
quarantined classes to the removed classes, whereas combining Eqs. (2a–e) yields
Eq. (1a).
As noted in earlier works (e.g. Ref. [17]), letting PE (t) = e−t/τe and PI (t) = e−t/τi
reduces Eqs. (2) to Eqs. (1). Although it has been argued that more general multi-stage
gamma-distributed latent and infectious periods may be more appropriate, see
e.g. [18–20], here we chose the latent and infectious periods to be of fixed length [21].
By doing so we preserve the simplicity of the final model, while alleviating the
aforementioned issues with exponentially distributed latent and recovery periods. Hence
PE (t) and PI (t) are assumed to be of the form
(

PE (t) =

PI (t) =

(3a,b)

Considering this time-dependence, we are able to deduce the following system of delay

(4e)

where, for t > 0,

when t > 0 and δ(t) being the Dirac delta function.
The system of Eqs. (4) is further extended in the present study by incorporating the
features given by items ii), iii) and vi) above, which is achieved by introducing a
time-dependent function r(t) which corresponds to the portion of undetected cases.
Furthermore, rather than solving the delay differential equations that may require
specialized techniques, we opt to convert the system of Eqs. (4) to a discrete difference
equation so that they become:
X(t) = β

S(t + 1) = S(t) − X(t),

(5a)

E(t + 1) = E(t) + X(t) − X(t − τe ),

(5b)

I(t + 1) = I(t) + r(t − τe )X(t − τe ) − r(t − τi − τe )X(t − τi − τe ) − I0 δt,τi ,

(5c)

Q(t + 1) = Q(t) + (1 − r(t − τe ))X(t − τe )
− (1 − r(t − τi − τe ))X(t − τe − τi ) − Q0 δt,τi
R(t + 1) = R(t) + X(t − τi − τe ) + (Q0 + I0 )δt,τi ,

(5d)
(5e)

where t represents discrete time in days and δ is the Kronecker delta. Eqs. (5) are to be
solved with the appropriate initial conditions. We have confirmed numerically that such
an approach does not compromise the overall quantitative agreement with the solutions
to the original system of delay differential equations. Note that the equations for E(t),

Q(t) and R(t) may be decoupled from the system, as they can be fully specified
independently once the evolution of X(t), I(t), and S(t) is determined. Hence, it
suffices to keep track of the movement of individuals across the susceptible and infective
classes as well as the number of exposed individuals at each day. Initially, we take
I(0) = r(0)c0 /(1 − r(0)), the actual undetected cases who are assumed to be responsible
for initiating the epidemic outbreak as derived from the initial confirmed cases c0 . The
exposed individuals at t = 0 are those who become infectious at t = τe and hence
X(0) = (c2 − c1 )/(1 − r(0)), where c1,2 are the confirmed cases on days 1 and 2,
respectively. Likewise, the exposed individuals one day before the first cases are
confirmed at t = 0, will be those who will become infected when t = 1, so that we may
take X(−1) = (c1 − c0 )/(1 − r(0)), assuming for simplicity that r(0) = r(−1). This
allows us to determine the susceptibles at t = 0 as S(0) = N − c2 /(1 − r(0)).
Summarizing, we consider X(t) of the form

with β(t) being time-dependent to reflect governmental measures imposed or lifted. The
fitting process is facilitated by the fact that the government imposes or relaxes measures
in M stages and at given times t1 , t2 , . . . , tM . In order to use the fewest possible
parameters, we take β(t) to be of the form


where b0 and bM being, respectively, the initial and final transmission rates
(limt→∞ β(t) = bM ) and bj , j = 1, . . . , M − 1 correspond to intermediate transmission
rates. This choice for β(t) allows us to have some flexibility on the form of β(t),
capturing both smooth transitions across the bj and abrupt step-like behaviors (when
mj → ∞). To fit the Cyprus case, we consider a two-stage process (M = 2) based on
the actual announcements by the government, with measures enforced on March 24th ,
2020 (t1 = 15) and almost fully lifted on May 21st , 2020 (t2 = 73). Hence, the required
model parameters are obtained based on the data for confirmed cases, which for our
model are given by

by performing a least-squares fit for five parameters b0,1,2 and m1,2 while all the rest
are kept fixed. The number of deaths due to COVID-19 are too few in Cyprus in order
to reliably perform any fitting. The reported as recovered would require the
introduction of yet another timescale, since according to the protocols followed,
individuals are considered to have recovered after they test negative twice within a
period of 24 hours and only after all symptoms are resolved, which leads to a median
recovery time of 23 days [22]. The portion of undetected r(t) evolves in a prescribed
manner that captures how aggressively testing is performed, and is elaborated in Sec. 3.

Forecasting for various scenaria
Beyond the available data, which are fitted to determine the five parameters of the
model, we forecast the evolution of the epidemic based on different scenaria. In one
scenario, we choose to divide the three major classes X(t), S(t) and I(t) into two groups
each, namely X1,2 (t), S1,2 (t) and I1,2 (t) that can be used to model situations where a
portion of the population, e.g. people above 65 years old and/or with preexisting
conditions, is considered vulnerable to the disease and continues to observe strict social
distancing measures compared to the rest who return to work. Hence, initially and up to
some time t = t∗ the population is assumed to behave uniformly to reflect the lockdown
imposed to the whole population. For t > t∗ , we differentiate into subclasses as follows.
We prescribe the 2 × 2 contact matrix with constant entries βj,k , which denotes the
average number of infectious contacts made per day by an individual in group j with an
individual in group k. Since the total number of contacts between group j to k must
equal the number of contacts from group k to group j, we must have Nj βj,k = Nk βk,j ,
where N1,2 are the corresponding populations of each group with N = N1 + N2 .
Therefore, the exposed, infectious and susceptible for groups 1 and 2 evolve
according to

(9c)

for t > t∗ and k = 1 and 2. For t ≤ t∗ the time histories of Xk , Sk and Ik correspond to
scalings of X(t), S(t) and I(t) by Nk /N , and we also let rk (t) = r(t). Hence, the
confirmed cases for each of the two groups, Ck (k = 1 and 2), is given at time t > t∗ by

Whether the two groups evolve differently depends crucially on r1,2 (t) and the contact
matrix βj,k . For instance, if we set rk (t) = r(t) and βk,j = βNj /N , the collective
evolution of the two groups is not distinguishable from a simulation using Eqs. (5) with
the two groups mixed in a single group.

2.2

Particle model

Within the particle model, disease transmission is modeled by elastic collisions of
two-dimensional hard discs. The number of particles per unit time scattered in any
direction from a given disc is
Ncoll. = Dnv0 ,
(11)
where n is the number of discs per unit area with radius D/2 and v0 is their velocity.
We take D = 4 m so that individuals with distance greater than 2 m can not infect
others. This fixes the length unit of the system. Then the basic reproduction number is
given by
R0 = Ncoll. pτi ,
(12)
where p is the probability that an infectious individual transmits the disease upon
collision with another individual. We take τi to be the same average time a single
individual is infectious as for the extended SEIQR model.
The work-flow implemented includes using the DynamO [23] particle simulator
within our own post-processing scripts to generate a list of elastic particle collisions.

August 10, 2020

7/16

This list is then parsed with a given set of parameters, namely initial number of
infected, exposed, and quarantined, infection probability for each population subgroup,
detection rate as a function of time, and velocities as a function of time. At regular
time-steps the total number of susceptible, exposed, infectious, quarantined, and
recovered are registered. As in the case of the extended SEIQR model, an exposed
individual transitions either to infectious or quarantined based on a time-dependent
undetected ratio r(t). Quarantined individuals do not infect and their time evolution is
taken to model the reported numbers by the government. Our work-flow, which
includes post-processing of the output from DynamO, analyzing the collisions list, and
processing and visualizing the data is available online 2 .
The particle simulation time units are in a scale that can only be expressed in
physical time units a posteriori. To determine the time scale a, we initialize with one
randomly chosen exposed individual and measure the average number of transmissions
per individual (R) as a function of time, for multiple values of τi /a. By convention, we
only measure this quantity for individuals that have recovered, which means R(t) = 0 for
t < τi + τe . In the left panel of Fig. 1, we show R(t) measured for representative values
of τi . The measurement is repeated 256 times, randomly varying the initial individual
exposed each time, which yields the statistical error in R(t). τe is kept fixed to one fifth
of τi . From this analysis we see that R(t) is constant for a time period after t = τi + τe
long enough to obtain a reliable measurement of R0 for each choice of τi . In the right
panel of Fig. 1 we show the measured R0 as a function of τi and confirm the linear
behavior as expected from Eq. (12). Demanding that initially R0 = 3.5 and τi =10 days
we fix a via a linear fit, which yields a ≈ 2.763 days per simulation time unit.

After fixing the time scale a we further tune the particle model in order to determine
the dependence of R0 on the probability of infection p and velocity scaling factor u/v0 .
This is shown in Fig. 2, for representative values of p. This tuning allows us to
determine the combination of u/v0 and p to achieve a desired value of R0 . Namely, we

Determination and comparison of R0 between models

In the results that follow, we will quote values of R0 obtained from both the extended
SEIQR model and the particle model. To facilitate comparison, we define the following:
• With R0model we will quote the value of R0 as obtained from the model parameters.
For the extended SEIQR model we have
R0model (t) = β(t)(1 − r(t))τi ,

(14)

where β(t) is of the form of Eq. (7) and its parameters will be determined from
fits as will be discussed in the next section. For the particle model, R0model (t) is a
function of the velocities u(t)/v0 and probabilities p(t) as determined from the
analysis of Fig. 2. In particular, for the particle model it is given by
R0model (t) = α0

with α

• With R0integral we will quote, for both models, an integral definition of R0 as
defined in Ref. [24]. Namely, in this case we take
ρ(t + 1)
R0integral (t) = τi Pt−τe

i=t−(τi +τe )+1

(16)

where ρ(t) are the reported cases at time t as determined from each model.

Results

The two aforementioned models can now be implemented in a country-specific case. In
this study we consider the case of Cyprus for which such modeling and forecasting is
lacking. Our analysis strategy is to adjust the parameters of the two models to
reproduce the available data of Cyprus up to the writing of this manuscript, namely
July 31st , 2020 and then predict the evolution of the pandemic until the end of 2020.
Four different scenaria will be considered as explained below.
In Fig. 3 we show the result of fitting Eq. (8) of our model to reported COVID-19
positive cases in Cyprus [22] to obtain the parameters of β(t) for the SEIQR model. We
validate the model by using data up to date tf and compare with the known cases. We
take tf to be June 1st , July 1st , and July 15th . We sample the fit parameters via Markov
Chain Monte Carlo using the Stan library [25], defined with a likelihood function via
2
e−χ /2 , where χ2 is given by

~ t) the
with ct the cumulative reported cases for Cyprus with t = 0 March 9th and C(θ,
result from the SEIQR model, namely Eqs. (8) or (10). The vector θ~ contains the
parameters to be fitted, namely θ~ = (b0 , b1 , b2 , m1 , m2 ). We use M = 2 in Eq. (7) and σ
drawn from a normal distribution. We generate 400 independent samples of the
parameters obtained using two chains of 2000 iterations, discarding the first 1000 as
thermalization iterations and of the remaining 1000 we took every fifth in each chain.
At this point in time, the number of actual cases as compared to the reported are
not known. For example, an early study analyzing testing data from Iceland put this
number between five to ten times. There, intensive testing was carried out early on,
obtained from 1st to 4th of April [26]. A study in the US, analyzing data obtained from
23rd March to 12th May, estimated this number to be between six to 24 times [27].
Given the intensification of testing and tracing in Cyprus since May [22] and the low
death rate [2], which indicates low prevalence of the virus, we take the portion of
undetected cases r(t), to gradually decrease from one detected in 10 infected to one in
three by using the functional form for the portion of undetected cases r(t) to be
r(t) =

r1 − r0
r1 + r0
+
tanh(mr (t − tr )),
2
2

(18)

with r0 = 0.9, r1 = 0.7, mr = 0.05, and tr = 73 or May 21st , 2020.
As can be seen, we obtain consistent results and good prediction of the available
data when fitting until June 1st i.e. when omitting up to two months of the most recent
data from the fits. From the central panel, we see that the estimates for R0 overlap
when varying tf , which confirms that our fits yield consistent parameters for the choices
considered. The parameters obtained for each fit range are tabulated in Table 1.

the fit, namely for day 84 (June 1st ), 114 (July 1st ), and 128 (July 15th ), with t = 0

lower bounds respectively, obtained via a Markov chain Monte Carlo as explained in the

Fig 3. Fitting the SEIQR model. In the top panel, we show the reported cases in
Cyprus (circles) as a function of time and the result of fitting our SEIQR model. We
consider three periods taking tf = 84 (blue curve), 114 (orange curve), and 128 (green
curve) that overlap with the data. The blue shaded region shows the interval between
March 25th and May 21st , used as t1 and t2 in Eq. (7). The dashed curves and bands
show the predicted mean value and 90% confidence level as the time range being fitted
varies by changing tf . The central panel shows R0model with the solid curves and R0integral
with the dashed curves. The bottom panel shows the ratio of undetected r(t).
Having validated our extended SEIQR model by predicting the reported cases over
the known period by varying tf , we make forecasting using four plausible scenaria:
A) In scenario A, we take β(t) and r(t) to be constant and produce a forecast of the
new detected cases to be reported by the government until the end of 2020.
B) In scenario B, we gradually change r(t) to asymptotically reach 50% by mid August.
This reflects a scenario in which more aggressive testing and contact tracing is
performed.
C) In scenario C, we decrease β(t) such that R0model approximately reaches 1 by mid
August. Thus we model the case in which measures are tightened in order to
preempt a second wave.
D) In scenario D, we use Eq. (10) to model the effect of splitting the population into
two groups. Namely, for 80% of the population we take β(t) to remain unchanged
as in scenario A, with the remaining 20% having a β(t) that reproduces
R0model ' 0.5. This scenario models a situation in which, for example, restrictions
are imposed on vulnerable groups.

Fig 4. Forecasting using the SEIQR model. Predicting the evolution of
COVID-19 for scenaria A and B (upper panel) and C and D (lower panel) obtained
using our extended SEIQR model. In the upper part of each plot we show the reported
cases in Cyprus (circles) as a function of time. The gray band shows the period used to
fit the parameters, namely we use data on the reported cases up to tf =128 or July 15th .
The blue curve and band shows our prediction for each scenario. In the central part of
each plot, we show with the solid blue curve R0model , and with the dashed yellow curve
R0integral . For the case of scenario D, the solid blue curve corresponds to R0model (t)
evaluated using β(t) used for 80% of the population, while the dash-dotted line shows
R0model (t) evaluated using β(t) used for 20%. In the bottom part we show r(t).
The forecasting for the four scenaria using the SEIQR model are shown in Fig. 4,
when using the parameters as determined by fitting the Cyprus reported cases taking
tf =128 or July 15th . As can be seen, for scenario A, the mean value of infected steadily
increases. In scenarios B, C, and D on the other hand, within the uncertainty bands, we
observe a flattening of the daily cases until end of the year.

Fig 5. Forecasting using the particle model. Predictions for the same four
scenaria as in Fig. 4 but using the particle model. In the top part of the plots, the blue
curve and associated band is obtained as the average and 90% confidence interval when
seeding the model 32 times. In the central part of the plots, we show with the blue
curve R0model and with the orange dashed curve R0integral . The rest of the notation is the
same as that used in Fig. 4.
Our predictions based on the time evolution of the particle model for the four
different scenaria are shown in Fig. 5. We use the same r(t) as used in the extended
SEIQR model. For the functional form of u(t), we use β(t), where now instead of bj of
Eq. (7) we adjust the particle velocities uj for j = 0, 1, and 2 to minimize χ2 defined in
the same way as in the SEIQR model given in Eq. (17). The error bands in the upper
part of the plots are statistical, obtained as the 90% confidence level from independently
seeding the particle model 32 times. Requiring an increase of the minimum χ2 yields
errors in the parameters that are smaller than 0.5% and are therefore negligible
compared to the statistical errors shown in Fig. 5.

As can be seen from comparing the forecasts shown in Figs. 4 and 5, the two models
are qualitatively in agreement in their predictions for all four scenaria. In particular,
they both predict that within scenario A and within the uncertainty one cannot exclude
either a steady future increase in daily cases that can turn into an epidemic or a
flattening. For other three scenaria, both models show a flattening or complete
suppression of daily cases by the end of the year. It should be noted that the large
fluctuations observed in R0integral in Fig. 5 arise from the discrete nature of the particle
model when multiple consecutive days yield zero new cases.

Conclusions

In this work we developed two different approaches to model the evolution of
COVID-19. The two approaches can be used in any country and do not required large
numbers of data. In particular they can be applied in countries like Cyprus, where the
most consistent and reliable data are for the daily reported cases since data on e.g.
deaths, intubations, and hospitalizations are too few for a meaningful statistical
analysis. The models are highly complementary; the SEIQR model is an ODE-based
compartmental approach and is computationally fast allowing sampling of parameters
over long Monte Carlo Markov chains; the particle simulation approach, while
computationally demanding, allows for tagging and tracing individuals and changing
infection probabilities for arbitrary subsets of the population.
We calibrate and validate the models using the Cyprus reported positive COVID-19
data. For both models, we are able to fit the daily reported cases using five parameters
that describe either the change of infection rate over time for the case of the SEIQR
model or the velocities of the particles for the case of the particle model. In addition,
we are able to obtain consistent results when using the two models to predict the
evolution of COVID-19 for four scenaria that can be applied to control the epidemic.
The four scenaria are chosen as appropriate examples to demonstrate the range of
parameters that can be adjusted using our two models, such as future lockdowns or
easing of restrictions for subsets of the population and changes in the number of tests
performed that in turn change the ratio of infected reported. Richer scenaria can be
forecasted by combining these measures and by selectively applying them to multiple
subsets of the population.
Although the robustness of the model fits we have undertaken pertains to datasets
from other countries, we have chosen to limit the discussion to the case for Cyprus for
the sake of brevity. Furthermore, future work to enhance the models will include
allowing for non-uniform spatial distributions to model different population densities
and data-driven modeling of the detection rate as more data become available.
