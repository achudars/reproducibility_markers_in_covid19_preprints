Abstract
We use the Newcomb-Benford law to test if countries have manipulated reported data during the COVID-19 pandemic. We find that democratic countries, countries with the higher
gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, higher healthcare expenditures, and better universal
healthcare coverage are less likely to deviate from the Newcomb-Benford law. The relationship
holds for the cumulative number of reported deaths and total cases but is more pronounced for
the death toll. The findings are robust for second-digit tests, for a sub-sample of countries with
regional data, and in relation to the previous swine flu (H1N1) 2009–2010 pandemic. The paper
further highlights the importance of independent surveillance data verification projects.

Introduction

On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the novel coronavirus disease
2019 (COVID-19) a pandemic. With tens of millions of confirmed cases and over two million of
deaths, this pandemic has spurred a great number of controversies, including many related to the
accuracy of the data countries report. Mass media organizations around the globe argue that many
countries have continued to manipulate the data for political or other gains.1
In this paper, we study the association between the accuracy of COVID-19 data reported by
countries and their macroeconomic and political indicators. Our results show that countries that
are more functional democracies, have higher income, and stronger healthcare systems report more
accurate data. The relationship exists for the cumulative number of confirmed cases and for the
cumulative number of reported deaths; however, the results are more pronounced for the number
of deaths, indicating that less developed countries are more likely to manipulate mortality data.
To gauge data accuracy, we use compliance with the Newcomb-Benford law (NBL), which is an
observation that in many naturally occurring collections of numbers the first digit is not uniformly
distributed. The numeral “1” will be the leading digit around one-third of the time; the numeral
“2” will be the leading digit 18% of the time; and each subsequent numeral, “3” through “9,” will
be the leading digit with decreasing frequency. One property of the NBL is that manipulated or
fraudulent data deviate significantly from the theoretical NBL distribution. Due to the ease of its
application and straightforward approach, the law has been extensively used to detect fraud and
data manipulations. It has been applied to accounting, finance, macroeconomic, and forensic data
to test for data manipulation and fraud. We apply the NBL to COVID-19 data for 185 countries
affected by the pandemic. For each country, we first identify the period of exponential growth when
the data are expected to obey the NBL. After the country’s data reach a plateau, the number of
cases stabilizes, and the data are not expected to obey the NBL. During the growth period for each
country, we calculate four goodness-of-fit measures to estimate compliance with the NBL and use
these measures as proxies for data manipulation.
We then study the relationship between our proxies for accuracy of data and indicators of the
strength of the economy, democratic institutions, and healthcare systems. Specifically, we use the
regression analysis to find the association between goodness-of-fit measures and the Economist
Intelligence Unit Democracy Index, the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, healthcare expenditures as percentage of GDP, and the Universal Health Coverage Index (UHC). Previous studies
have shown in other settings that countries with weaker democracies and less economic development are more likely to manipulate data and have lower transparency.2 The governments of such
countries fabricate data for political gains and to consolidate power. Autocratic governments control most mass media outlets and often censor inconvenient facts that undermine the ruling regime.
COVID-19 presents such a case because the wide spread of the pandemic and high death tolls
would send a negative signal to citizens and indicate that the government is incompetent. Autocratic governments would try to downplay the scale of the pandemic for the sake of appearances.
Our main hypothesis is that countries with weaker democracies, and weaker economic and
healthcare systems will have lower data accuracy as measured by the NBL goodness-of-fit statistic.

(2006), Lebovic (2006), and Fearon (2011) for transparency. Judge and Schechter (2009) analyze the quality of survey
data using the NBL and find that survey data in developing countries is of poor quality while data from developed
countries is of better quality.

Our results in many tests support the hypothesis. We find that our four goodness-of-fit measures
(which measure deviations from the theoretical distribution as given by the NBL) are negatively
correlated with macroeconomic indicators (Democracy Index, GDP, healthcare expenditures, and
UHC). The results are true for the cumulative number of cases and the cumulative number of
reported deaths. We also find the result is more pronounced for the reported number of deaths
than for the number of confirmed cases. This indicates that, on average, autocratic regimes and
poorer countries are more prone to manipulate death tolls than the total number of citizens infected.
We conduct a series of robustness tests and find that our results are not driven by the specific
period in which we calculate the goodness-of-fit measures, by small countries, by countries with a
small number of cases or deaths, or by countries with extreme deviations from the NBL. We also
show that the same relationship between proxies for accuracy of data and economic indicators is
observed when we apply the NBL to second digits.
One concern of our study is that the proxies for data accuracy are calculated based on limited
sample sizes for individual countries. To resolve this potential problem, we confirm our findings for
the sub-sample of 50 countries that provide regional data (at a state or province level). Regional
data increase the sample size from which we calculate our statistics substantially and heighten the
precision of our accuracy measures.
We find a similar relationship for the previous swine flu (H1N1) pandemic of 2009–2010. We
repeat our analysis for 35 countries that reported weekly data of the number of confirmed cases and
the number of deaths to Pan American Health Organization (PAHO). We discover support for the
negative relationship between deviations from the NBL and the selected developmental indicators.
There is substantial body of literature assessing the tendency of misreporting COVID-19 surveillance pandemic data by countries using different statistical techniques, such as case fatality rates,
excess mortality rates, the variance of reported data, the clustering of data, and even trends in
search engines.3 The inherent problem with these COVID-19 studies is that they rely on uniform
approaches to measure confirmed cases and COVID-19-related deaths across countries and periods
within one country. Even though countries are expected to follow the same guidelines provided by
the WHO when reporting cases, many variations exist (and sometimes appear in states and regions
within a country) in how they collect and report data. Any comparisons of raw numbers—like the
total number of confirmed cases, the number of deaths, and mortality rates—among countries may
be also problematic because they are most likely driven by the difference in other variables, like
the number of tests conducted, the strength of the healthcare system, demographic composition,
and reporting standards. Correct testing would require controlling for all those hard-to-observe
variables. This makes comparisons between countries difficult.
One helpful property of the NBL is its tolerance to different data generating processes between
observations (in our case, countries). As long as data in each country are expected to obey the
NBL, cross-observation comparisons are possible. This means that we can apply the test even if
countries differ in how they measure COVID-19 cases and related deaths. The test is also free of
country-specific differences, including public policies used to stop the pandemic, like quarantines,
social distancing, testing, and availability of treatment. The NBL test is only sensitive to human
intervention and manipulation of data in otherwise naturally occurring processes.
Some studies apply the NBL to individual countries to test if a given country has been falsifying
data during the pandemic (Idrovo and Manrique-Hernández 2020; Jackson and Sambridge 2020;
Peng and Nagata 2020). We indicate that such tests are problematic because they largely depend
on the sample size. We stress that our paper is not aimed to answer questions whether a particular

government manipulates data. We use the same approach to calculate goodness-of-fit measures
for all countries and then compare countries cross-sectionally based on developmental indicators.
Our results indicate that data from autocracies and poorer countries should be trusted less, in line
with the previous literature (Hollyer et al. 2011). It should also be noted that the NBL test is not
directional. However, it is unreasonable to believe that if a country does not comply with the NBL,
the government would willingly manipulate data to inflate the number of cases or deaths. Neither
does the divergence from the NBL provide us specifics on how the data are being manipulated.
We cannot ex ante predict which first digits will be over- or underinflated. For example, if the
country’s true number of cases is in the 2,000s and the government tries to falsify data to look
smaller and reports high 1,900s, the first digit “one” will be over-represented in this country’s
statistics. However, if the country’s numbers are in the 1,000s and the governments falsifies data
into the 900s, then the first digit “one” will be under-represented.
Our paper contributes to the literature in several ways. First, our paper helps to resolve the
controversy about different countries’ data manipulation during pandemics and provides estimates
of how widespread it is around the globe. Using the NBL and COVID-19 data, we document that
about one-third of the 185 countries affected by the pandemic indeed seem to misreport their data.
Second, our study shows which data, if any, countries are more likely to misreport. We document
that governments tend to downplay the news with the highest negative impact, i.e., the death toll,
to the highest degree. To a slightly lower degree, countries tend to manipulate the total number of
confirmed cases. We find no indication, on average, of systematic data manipulation for the number
of conducted COVID-19 tests and the number of cured cases. Third, we are the first study to use
the NBL to show that the strength of healthcare systems, as measured by healthcare expenditures
and the Universal Healthcare Index, are linked to the government’s ability to provide reliable data
during pandemics.
Finally, our paper contributes to the political economy and comparative economics literature.
We are the first to document the cross-sectional link between macroeconomic and political regime
indicators and the tendency to misreport data during pandemics. We show that authoritarian
regimes and countries with low GDP per capita are more likely to falsify data. Thus, this study
provides additional evidence of the link between democracy and transparency that is often taken
for granted. Combined, the results are consistent with previous findings in the literature that
authoritarian regimes and poorer countries’ governments manipulate information to avoid negative
news that may undermine their power.
Our study has broad implications. First, we provide evidence that the data supplied during
pandemics may be of low quality, especially from autocracies and poorer countries, and we suggest
that caution should be used when interpreting and using the data. Second, the study highlights the
importance of initiatives to externally verify data provided by governments, including independent
surveillance data verification projects.4 Finally, we provide new evidence on the applicability of
the NBL to detect data fabrication.
The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the review of related literature and develops
our main hypothesis, Section 3 discusses the NBL of anomalous numbers, Section 4 describes our
sample and variables, Section 5 provides major results for the study, including robustness checks,
and Section 6 concludes .

Literature Review and Hypothesis Development

Studies have long posed questions about whether democratic regimes provide more reliable data
to the public than autocracies in both theoretical and empirical settings. For many, the intuitive
answer is “yes.” However, this depends on the definition of “democracy.” If democracy is defined
only through electoral competition (e.g., Przeworski et al. 1999; Schumpeter 1942), then the link
between data reliability and a particular political regime is not obvious. Some authors argue that
the expected relationship is actually reverse: greater vulnerability to public disapproval within
democracies may lead to their higher tendency to falsify data (Kono 2006; Mani and Mukand
2007). Most studies, however, show that democracies indeed are more transparent. They argue
that it is authoritarian regimes that are more vulnerable to negative information and have more
incentives to distort and manipulate information that undermines their image. In addition, such
regimes usually have control over mass media organizations and therefore have more capabilities
to exercise control. Guriev and Treisman (2019) show that modern authoritarian regimes do not
use ideological propaganda and political repression to the same extent as dictators in the twentieth century. Instead, in the twenty-first century, information is the key factor to obtain and retain
power. Authoritarian regimes ground their legitimacy and support from citizens in strong economic
performance and successful domestic and foreign affairs. When news that undermines this image
is released, it threatens the survival of the autocrat. It hurts democratic leaders as well, but democratic regimes depend more on voter welfare, which, in turn, is contingent on available information
(Hollyer et al. 2011). Therefore, democracies are more inclined to disclose truthful information. In
addition, authoritarian regimes exert much tighter control over information supplied to the public,
and as such they have easier ways to distort data. Autocrats use data manipulation to improve
their public image and prolong their stay in office.
Indeed, Gehlbach and Sonin (2014) demonstrate that government media ownership increases
media bias.5 In line with this argument, Rozenas and Stukal (2019) propose that autocrats are
more likely to manipulate data for which it is more difficult for citizens to obtain hard external
information benchmarks. Autocrats manipulate such data with censorship or falsifications. Easily
verifiable data are only framed to improve the image of the government. The authors provide
examples of how citizens can easily benchmark news about income and market prices and, therefore,
the government resorts to a tender narrative when reporting such news; whereas domestic politics
and international affairs are hard to verify, and the government more easily falsifies these data.
COVID-19 provides a unique setting to test a related hypothesis. Pandemic surveillance data are
hard to acquire independently by citizens because they lack access to the necessary large-scale
data collection and medical facilities. At the same time, the news that the disease is raging and
is widespread under authoritarian rule would be an indicator of the inefficiency or failure of the
government. The death toll is even more damaging to the image of the autocrat, who sees such news
as a threat and tries to downplay the scale of the problem. We therefore formulate the following
two hypotheses:
Hypothesis 1: Democratic regimes are less likely to manipulate pandemic surveillance data.
Hypothesis 2: The link between democratic regimes and data manipulation is more pronounced
for the reported death toll.
Extant empirical studies find support for the hypothesis that democracies provide more reliable
data in different settings. For example, Bueno de Mesquita et al. (2003) argue that countries with
5
That bias, however, comes at a cost because citizens tend to trust the news less, and because of the reduced
advertising revenue.

larger “winning coalitions”—i.e., democracies—are more transparent than countries with small
winning coalitions. By analyzing the reported by governments tax revenues and national income
data, they find support for their hypothesis. Hollyer et al. (2011) use a model to back their similar
hypothesis that in democratic regimes, governments are more willing to disclose policy information.
Their empirical test is based on the willingness of governments to report data to the World Bank’s
World Development Indicators. Rozenas and Stukal (2019) use a corpus of daily news reports from
Russia’s largest state-owned television network, Channel 1, and find that the state-owned media
systematically frames facts to make the government look better.
Some authors embrace extreme positions and claim that the reliability of data supplied by the
government should be a measure of the country’s democracy level, and that elections and pluralism
alone are not enough (Dahl 1971). This is because, for elections to be fair, voters should make
informed decisions, and informed decisions are only possible in regimes that provide reliable data
to voters. Studies, thus, differentiate between two measures of democracy: a “thin” measure,
or minimalist, i.e., covering only the election process and freedoms; and a “thick” measure that
includes more general concepts like transparency and culture. Indeed, if democracy is defined,
at least partially, through transparency, then any findings regarding the link between the two
will be trivial. Therefore, the measure of democracy, preferably, should not include the degree of
transparency.
We address this issue by constructing several measures of democracy. We start with the widely
used Economist Intelligence Unit Democracy Index. We also study its five components: electoral
pluralism, functioning of the government, political participation, political culture, and civil liberties.
“Stripping” the Democracy Index helps to evaluate the political component of democracy that is
not directly related to transparency: while some components are more likely to be related to
transparency (like political culture), others are not (like electoral pluralism or the functioning of
the government). We also use alternative democracy measures, e.g., the Freedom House Electoral
Democracy Index and their broader democracy measure (which includes political freedom and civil
liberties). The Freedom House Electoral Democracy Index is the “thin” definition of democracy,
and should be unrelated to transparency to avoid spurious correlation.
We also adopt other measures that may explain countries’ tendencies to manipulate data. Hollyer et al. (2011) maintain that GDP per capita is a measure of the “ability of the governments
to collect and disseminate high-quality statistical data.” We therefore include the GDP per capita
in our tests. Because our setup has been created during the pandemic and the testing is done on
surveillance data, we use two other proxies for each country’s ability to collect and report reliable health-related data: health expenditures as a percentage of GDP, and the Universal Health
Coverage Index. We thus formulate our third hypothesis as follows:
Hypothesis 3A: Countries with higher GDP per capita levels are less likely to manipulate pandemic surveillance data.
Hypothesis 3B: Countries with higher levels of health expenditures as percentage of GDP are
less likely to manipulate pandemic surveillance data.
Hypothesis 3C: Countries with higher levels of the Universal Health Coverage Index are less
likely to manipulate pandemic surveillance data.
To gauge data manipulation, we use compliance with the NBL. We compare countries crosssectionally to find if there is a relationship between developmental indicators and goodness-of-fit to
the NBL measures. We are not the only paper to use the NBL to test the validity of reported data

6

during COVID-19. Several other concurrent studies employ a similar approach.6 However, these
papers usually select one or a few countries and apply the NBL to test if there is any evidence of
manipulation in a given country’s data. The authors use the cutoff values from the chi-squared
distribution (or similar distributions) and give a “yes-or-no” type of answer to their binary research
question. In many cases, the goodness-of-fit measures are calculated with substantial errors, and
many studies do not provide estimates for the statistical significance of the test or its power. In
addition, these test statistics and inference results greatly depend on the sample size. With large
enough sample sizes, the null hypothesis of compliance with the NBL will be rejected in almost
every case. Some studies estimate their test statistic at the country level, some studies estimate
it at a regional or state level, and some studies use county-level data. This leads to contradictory
findings among these studies even when looking at the same country. Any inferences from such
tests are also problematic.
Our approach is different. We use all countries affected by COVID-19. For each test, we employ
the same approach for all countries to calculate the test statistic. We make any inferences from the
NBL test only in comparison. We study the link between compliance with the NBL and economic
indicators. The unit of observation in our analysis is the country because it is this relationship
between the proxies for data manipulation and the democratic and economic indicators that we
find significant in most tests. To our best knowledge, this is the first paper to examine the crosssection of all countries and compare them based on developmental indicators when analyzing data
manipulation during pandemics.
Not many studies apply the NBL in an international setting, though there are several notable
exceptions. Nye and Moul (2007) indicate that international macroeconomic data generally conforms the NBL. They find, however, that for non-OECD (African) countries, the data do not
conform with the law, which raises questions about data quality and manipulation in these countries. Gonzalez-Garcia (2009) uses a similar approach to test the annual IMF data, but finds no
connection between independent assessments of data quality and adherence to the first-digit NBL
in different country groups. The limitation of these studies, however, is that they group countries
based on geographical proximity, instead of some logical choice of economic indicators. Michalski
and Stoltz (2013) provide a theoretical model and empirical findings that some countries strategically misreport their economic data for short-term government gains. The authors reveal that
some groups of countries (i.e. countries with fixed exchange rate regimes, high negative net foreign
asset positions, negative current account balances, or greater vulnerability to capital flow reversal)
are more likely to falsify macroeconomic data than others. Our paper is different in that it applies
the NBL to the pandemic data in the international setting. The countries in our study are grouped
based on developmental, economic, and political indicators. We contribute to this body of literature by providing additional evidence that some types of countries are more likely to falsify not
only macroeconomic data but also surveillance data during pandemics.

Newcomb-Benford Law of Anomalous Numbers

In many naturally occurring processes, the resulting data have the leading significant digit that is
not uniformly distributed. The distribution is monotonically decreasing, with “1” being the most
common first digit, and “9” being the least common. The law was formally stated by Newcomb
(1881) and Benford (1938). A set of numbers is said to follow the NBL if the first digit d occurs

The data are expected to follow the NBL when the logarithms of values are uniformly and
randomly distributed. The NBL accurately describes many real-life sets of numerical data, including
lengths of rivers, stock prices, street addresses, accounting data, populations, physical constants,
and regression coefficients (Diekmann 2007). Data generated from many distributions and integer
sequences have been shown to closely obey the NBL, including Fibonacci numbers, powers of
numbers, exponential growth, many ratio distributions, and the F -distribution with low degrees of
freedom.8
Not all distributions generate data that follow the law. For example, uniform distribution,
normal distribution, and square roots of numbers do not obey it. For the data to obey the NBL,
several criteria should be satisfied (Cho and Gaines 2007; Diekmann 2007; Durtschi et al. 2004):
• Data span several orders of magnitude and are relatively uniform over such orders
• The mean is greater than the median, with a positive skewness
• Naturally occurring processes, the data which are the result of multiplicative fluctuations,
and data that is not influenced by human intervention
The last requirement, i.e., the fact that human intervention usually generates data that violates
the NBL, has led to its usefulness in detecting fraud and data manipulation. Studies have shown
that when humans intervene with the data generating process that is expected to comply with the
NBL, compliance stops. For example, Diekmann (2007) and Horton et al. (2018) show that when
scientific data are fabricated, they do not conform with the NBL. The researchers find that retracted
accounting papers significantly deviate from the NBL relative to a control group of papers. Cantu
and Saiegh (2010) and Breunig and Goerres (2011) reveal the same effect for electoral data. In a
similar spirit, Kaiser (2019) uncovers how discrepancies from the target NBL distribution can be
used to test reliability among survey data sets.
The NBL has been extensively used to detect fraud in accounting, finance, and macroeconmic
data. Nigrini (2012) and Stambaugh et al. (2012) show that fraudulent trading records and fabricated returns do not comply with the the NBL, whereas naturally occurring data do. Rauch,
Goettsche, et al. (2013) apply the NBL to the London Inter-bank Offered Rate (LIBOR) rates
and successfully detect manipulated data. O’Keefe and Yom (2017) study the determinants of
fraudulent behavior among failed banks between 1989 and 2015. They use the second-digit NBL to
identify those banks whose financial statements suggest tampering and purposeful misstatements.
Their results suggest that insider abuse and fraud at banks are detectable through an NBL analysis
of bank financial data. Hussain (2010) detects any possible data errors, irregularities, or fraud by
applying the NBL to the credit bureau data of commercial banks. By analyzing five European

equity market indices, Kalaichelvan and Shawn (2012) find evidence that substantiates the criticism for the use of the uniformity assumption for tests at the 1,000 level in favor of a distribution
consistent with the NBL.
Overall, the NBL has been used to detect fraud in: a) scientific studies (Diekmann 2007; Geyer
and Williamson 2004; Horton et al. 2018; Judge and Schechter 2009), b) accounting (Durtschi
et al. 2004; Horton et al. 2018; Nigrini 2012; Stambaugh et al. 2012; Suh et al. 2011; Varian
1972), c) election data (Breunig and Goerres 2011; Cantu and Saiegh 2010; Cho and Gaines 2007;
Deckert et al. 2011; Mebaner 2006), d) macroeconomic data (Gonzalez-Garcia 2009; Hussain 2010;
Kalaichelvan and Shawn 2012; Michalski and Stoltz 2013; Nye and Moul 2007; O’Keefe and Yom
2017; Rauch, Goettsche, et al. 2013; Rauch, Göttsche, et al. 2011), e) forensic analysis (Pinilla et al.
2018), f) tax evasion (Demir and Javorcik 2018; Nigrini 1996), g) toxic release inventory (Marchi
and Hamilton 2006), h) reported data during pandemics (Gómez-Camponovo et al. 2016; Idrovo,
Fernández-Niño, et al. 2011; Idrovo and Manrique-Hernández 2020).
Another useful property of the data obeying the NBL is that it is scale invariant, i.e., it is
independent of the measurement units. This makes it a powerful tool when testing data from
different sources (i.e., countries, companies). The NBL is also not the same as the imprecision (or
variance) of the data. The data may well be very noisy but still is expected to conform with the
law, as long as there is no deliberate falsification of data. For example, if a country’s data are
collected with error or irregularly but there are no data manipulations, the first digit should still
adhere to the NBL. In our application, it means that countries may differ in the way they count
COVID-19 cases or deaths, but as long as the data for each country is expected to obey the NBL,
we can test the data for the goodness-of-fit to the NBL.

Data and Variables
Goodness-of-Fit Measures

To measure how well the data comply with the NBL, we use several goodness-of-fit measures. The
most intuitive and commonly used is the chi-squared statistic:
Chi-sq. =

9
X
(Od − Ed )2

d=1

Ed

(1)

,

where Od and Ed are observed and expected by the NBL frequencies for digit d, respectively.
Chi-squared, however, has several problems: it has low statistical power when used with small
sample sizes and enormous power with large sample sizes. Therefore, we use alternative measures
of goodness-of-fit proposed in extant studies. We use a modified version of the Kuiper (1960) test
proposed by Stephens (1970) and Giles (2007) that is less dependent on the sample size N :

where FN (x) and F0 (x) are the observed cumulative distribution functions (cdf ) of leading digits

where od and ed are the proportions of observations with d as the first digit and proportions expected
by the NBL, respectively. The latter two measures are also insensitive to sample size. We calculate
each goodness-of-fit measure for two variables, the cumulative number of confirmed cases and the
cumulative number of reported deaths. In unreported tests we also analyze two other variables:
the number of cured cases and the number of conducted COVID-19 tests, and find insignificant
results.

4.2

Sample Description and Developmental Indicators

We first collect daily data from John Hopkins University for the cumulative number of confirmed
cases, the cumulative number of cured cases, and the cumulative number of deaths 9 between
January 22, 2020 and June 10, 2020. We also obtain the number of conducted tests from Our
World in Data.10 Studies have shown that naturally occurring processes comply well with the
NBL when the data grow exponentially or close to it (Formann 2010; Leemis et al. 2000). Once
the data reach the plateau, they are no longer expected to obey the NBL. Hence, for the data to
comply with the NBL, we select the growth part using the following approach. Because data show
weekly seasonality, we first compute seven-day moving averages (MA) for the new daily number of
confirmed cases. Then, for each country, we identify the date with the highest MA number of new
daily confirmed cases. If there are several dates with the same maximum, we use the earliest as
the cutoff. For our main analyses, we use data before the obtained cutoff for each country.11
For developmental indicators, we select the following four proxies for democratic and economic
development widely used in the literature: the Economist Intelligence Unit Democracy Index, GDP
per capita, healthcare expenditures as a percentage of GDP, and the Universal Health Coverage
Index. The Democracy Index (EIU ) is a weighted-average of answers to 60 questions from expert
assessments grouped into five categories: electoral pluralism, functioning of the government, political participation, political culture, and civil liberties. The index is aimed to measure the degree of
democracy of a country. In addition to the Democracy Index, we use GDP per capita as a proxy
for the country’s ability to provide precise data. We also take the country’s healthcare spending
as a percentage of GDP and its Universal Health Coverage Index as proxies for the strength of
each country’s healthcare system. We download countries’ democracy indices from the Economist
Intelligence Unit for 2019.12 We collect the Gross Domestic Product (GDP ) per capita, healthcare
expenditures as percentage of GDP (HE GDP ), and Universal Health Coverage Index (U HC) for
2017 from the World Bank.13 We also acquire 2019 population data for each country from Worl9

11
In unreported tests, we also use modified approaches. We find the maximum ratio MA(number of new daily
cases)/(Days since the first case for the country) and MA(number of new daily cases)/(Days since the latest nonzero
case for the country). The results are robust to alternative definitions of the cutoff date.

dometer.14 A total of 185 countries with available data were affected by COVID-19. The summary
for each country can be found in Appendix A1. Variable definitions can be found in Appendix A2.
We find that we cannot reject the NBL distribution for the entire world population for the
cumulative number of confirmed cases using the 1% significance level (Appendix A1).15 For the
cumulative number of reported deaths, however, we reject the hypothesis of compliance with the
NBL for the total world numbers. This indicates that, on average, countries are more likely to
falsify death tolls, and are less likely to falsify the confirmed number of cases. Using country-level
data, we also find that between 37 and 62 countries (depending on the goodness-of-fit measure
used) out of 185 deviate from the NBL when reporting the confirmed cases. Between 50 and 71
countries deviate from the NBL when reporting the number of deaths.16
Table 1 provides descriptive statistics for the major variables in our analyses. For the confirmed number of cases, the goodness-of-fit measures show that the average country’s data are
about borderline in terms of compliance with the NBL: they are consistent with the NBL if 1%
level of significance is used, but are not consistent if 10% is used. Observe further that the corresponding mean goodness-of-fit measures for the number of deaths are higher than for the number
of confirmed cases and are lagrely not consistent with the NBL at 1%. This indicates that, ceteris
paribus, countries are more prone to manipulate data on death rates. We must stress, however,
that any inferences about data manipulation simply based on individual goodness-of-fit statistics
is questionable because they largely depend on the selected sample size (country versus state, state
versus county level data). In our analyses, therefore, we aim to compare countries cross-sectionally.
The average country in our sample has over 42 million people, slightly less than $6,000 in terms
of GDP per capita,17 with roughly 6% of the GDP spent on healthcare expenditures, a democracy
index of around 55 on the scale between zero and 100, and around 65% of the population are covered
by universal health care (Table 1). The average sample size used to estimate the goodness-of-fit
measures per country is slightly over 61 days for the number of confirmed cases and is around 40
for the number of deaths (until the end of the growth period).
Table 2 provides mean values for our goodness-of-fit measures for the four quartiles of each
of our independent variables: EIU , ln(GDP ), HE GDP , and U HC. The quartiles for the EIU
Democracy Index roughly correlate with the definitions of the four regime types: full democracy,
flawed democracy, hybrid regime, and authoritarian regime. The table shows a general monotonic
trend for the data to deviate more from the Newcomb-Benford distribution as we move from the
highest quartile to the lowest. For the top quartiles, we cannot reject the hypothesis that countries
manipulate confirmed cases or death data at the 1% level. For the bottom quartile, however, we
reject that hypothesis about half the time for the number of confirmed cases, and almost every time
for the number of deaths. In a univariate setting, this is consistent with our three hypotheses. We
also find that for the cumulative number of deaths, the difference between goodness-of-fit measures
for the top and bottom quartiles is always significant.
Table 3 provides Pearson correlation coefficients between major variables. The four major
economic indicators, especially EIU , ln(GDP ), and U HC, are highly correlated, with correlation
coefficients ranging between 0.59 and 0.85 (all values are statistically significant). HE GDP is also
https://databank.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG/1ff4a498/Popular-Indicators.
At the time
we collected the data, many countries still did not have the World Bank data available for 2018 or 2019. 2017 is the
latest year for which the data are available for all countries.

15
The 1% threshold for all four measures are: 20.09 for Chi-squared, 2.00 for Kuiper, 1.21 for M, and 1.57 for D.
16
The values go up to between 62 and 103 and between 72 and 99 countries for the number of cases and deaths,
respectively, when the 10% level of significance is used. Note also that switching from country-level data to state data
or county-level data increases the statistics significantly (see Table A1.2 for the case of the U.S. county-level data.
17
Note that we use the natural logarithm of the population and GDP values when calculating averages for Table 1.

The table presents the mean value of goodness-of-fit measures (Chi-square, Kuiper, M and D) for the cumulative
number of confirmed and death cases, developmental indicators (EIU, ln(GDP), HE GDP, UHC), and other
variables. The number of observations vary due to missing values. The original dataset is included in Appendix
A1. ***, ** and * denote goodness-of-fit measures that correspond to significant differences from the theoretical
NBL distribution at 1%, 5% and 10% level, respectively. We also analyze the difference between the Confirmed an
the Death mean values for each goodness-of-fit measures using the t-test. 3, 2, and 1 indicate significant difference
between the Confirmed and the Death cases at the 1%, 5% and 10% level, respectively. All variable definitions

correlated with the other indicators, with correlation coefficients ranging between 0.37 and 0.46
(also significant). These variables are most likely proxies for the same indicator, the development
level of a country, and therefore—to avoid multicollinearity—we include only one indicator at a
time in our analysis.18 The four goodness-of-fit measures are also highly correlated with each other.
The total number of confirmed cases and the country’s population are also significantly correlated.
Univariate results in Table 3 also show that all goodness-of-fit measures are negatively correlated
with the four economic indicators, with 22 out of 32 correlation coefficients being significant (all
correlation coefficients for the cumulative number of deaths are significant).

Goodness-of-fit and Economic Indicators

We start with the simple ordinary least squares (OLS) regression model where our goodness-of-fit
measures appear on the left-hand-side and economic indicators are on the right-hand-side:
Goodness-of -f iti = β0 + β1 Indicatori + β2 ln(P opulation)i +
18

In unreported tests we put all economic indicators together in one equation on the right-hand-side and test for
collinearity. The result shows the Condition Number is over 46, indicative of serious collinearity.

where Indicatori denotes one of the four economic indicators: EIU , ln(GDP ), HE GDP , or
U HC. Higher values of the goodness-of-fit measures indicate greater deviation from the NBL. If
more developed countries are less likely to manipulate data, we expect the coefficient β1 to be
negative.
How well the data for each country are expected to obey the NBL depends on the span. For
example, countries with higher populations and more confirmed cases or deaths are expected to
follow the NBL more closely. To control for that, we include the natural logarithm of the country’s
total population.19 Even though the Kupier, M, and D-statistics are more independent of the
sample size, goodness-of-fit measures may still be affected by the sizes of the samples used to
estimate them. To control for the sample size effect, we include N umber of Daysi , which is the
number of days with nonzero confirmed cases (or the number of days with nonzero deaths) between
January 22, 2020 and the cutoff date for the growth part for each country.
The results of estimating Equation 6 are presented in Table 4. Panel A provides estimates for
the cumulative number of confirmed cases. All but one coefficient in front of economic indicators
are negative. Coefficients for ln(GDP ) and U HC are always significant. The coefficient for EIU
is significant only when the chi-squared goodness-of-fit measure is used, and the coefficient for
HE GDP lacks significance in all tests. Panel B provides estimates for the cumulative number
of deaths. All coefficients are negative, and all are significant. The magnitude of coefficients for
the number of deaths is also much higher than that for the number of confirmed cases. We find
that the coefficients for corresponding economic indicators are statistically different from each other
between Panels A and B in each case in Table 4.
To disentangle the political and other components of the Economist Intelligence Unit Democracy
Index, we then analyze the five components of the index separately: electoral pluralism (ELECT ),
functioning of the government (GV M T ), political participation (P ART ), political culture (CU LT ),
and civil liberties (LIBERT ). The results are presented in Table 5. We find that the results for
the overall EIU index are driven by its three components: electoral pluralism, functioning of the
government, and civil liberties (the significance of these coefficients coincides in each case with
the significance of the overall index), but not political participation or political culture (these
coefficients are never significant). We also substitute the EIU measure with the “thin” definition
of the democracy, i.e., the Freedom House Electoral Democracy Index. We use the reported by
Freedom House dummy variable for electoral democracy (F H DEM ), as well as the sum of their
measures of political freedom and civil liberties (F H AV ).20 Again, for the cumulative number of
cases, the coefficients are negative but lack significance. For the cumulative number of deaths, the
coefficients are negative and significant. The results show that the findings are not driven by the
choice of the democracy measure or by the spurious transparency component in the index.
We interpret the data as being consistent with the argument that more democratic and more
highly developed countries are less likely to deviate from the NBL when reporting pandemic data.
Specifically, countries with higher GDP per capita and universal health coverage are less likely to
manipulate their data during COVID-19. For the democracy index (EIU ) and health expenditures
as percentage of GDP (HE GDP ), we find convincing evidence only for the number of deaths.
We conclude that the relationship is more pronounced for the total number of deaths than for
the number of confirmed cases. As predicted, the control variable ln(P opulation)i is negative
and significant in all regressions: countries with higher populations (and total number of cases)
19
Alternatively, we include the very correlated number of confirmed cases (or deaths). We find that the results are
qualitatively and quantitatively the same when we used alternative control variables (untabulated).

The table presents the main results using COVID-19 pandemic data. We estimate equation 6 using OLS for first-digit goodness-of-fit measures. Panel
A shows the results for the cumulative number of confirmed cases, while panel B shows the results for the cumulative number of deaths. To avoid small
coefficients, we divide EIU, UHC, and No. of Days values by 100 for all models. Sample sizes vary due to missing values. P -values for a one-tailed t-test
are in parentheses. ***, ** and * denote significance at the 1%, 5% and 10% levels, respectively. All variable definitions are in Appendix A2.

The table presents results using alternative democracy measures. We estimate equation 6 using OLS for first-digit goodness-of-fit measures. Panel A shows the results for the
cumulative number of confirmed cases, while panel B shows the results for the cumulative number of deaths. To avoid small coefficients, we divide ELEC, GVMT, PART, EULT,
LIBERT, FH AV, and No. of Days values by 100 for all models. Sample sizes vary due to missing values. P -values for a one-tailed t -test are in parentheses. ***, ** and * denote
significance at the 1%, 5% and 10% levels, respectively. All variable definitions are in Appendix A2.

deviate less from the NBL. The results are also economically significant: an increase of one standard
deviation in the economic indicators, on average, results in a 0.25 increase of the standard deviation
in the goodness-of-fit measures. This value is roughly the same for the number of confirmed cases
and for the number of deaths, across all economic indicators.
Instead of looking at the linear relationship between the goodness-of-fit measures, one could
look at the probability of a country’s data to deviate from the NBL. To do that, we first identify
the critical values (at the 1% significance level) for each goodness-of-fit measure and create a set of
four dummy variables, Chi − sq., Kuiper, M , and D, where each dummy variable equals one if the
corresponding goodness-of-fit measure is above the critical value (i.e., we reject the null hypothesis
that the data obeys the NBL), and zero otherwise. We then estimate Equation 6 using the logit
model. Again, most coefficients for the economic indicators are negative, and all coefficients for
ln(GDP ) and U HC are significant. For the death toll, all coefficients for all economic indicators are
negative and significant. For brevity, we omit the table with the results. We again conclude that
more developed countries and countries with better health systems follow the NBL more closely,
and the relationship is more pronounced for the number of reported deaths than for the number of
confirmed cases. We also assert that the findings are not driven by the choice of the model.
Finally, we conduct the same tests for the cumulative number of cured cases and the number
of COVID-19 tests conducted. On average, we cannot reject the null hypothesis that countries
manipulated data on cured cases or the number of conducted tests. The regression results are also
not significant, indicating systematic cross-sectional difference between countries. We conclude that
countries are most prone to falsify mortality data, slightly less so the number of confirmed cases,
and that there is no evidence of systematic data falsification of cured cases or the number of tests.
The cross-sectional difference between countries is also the strongest for the death toll, weaker for
the total number of confirmed cases, and is insignificant for the number of cured cases and tests.

Robustness Analyses

One limitation of our analysis above is that it depends on the cutoff date for the growth part of
the data. The cutoff date is estimated using the data, the validity of which we are assessing. This
creates a possible endogeneity problem. To resolve this issue, we use several approaches. First,
instead of using a specific cutoff date for each country, we use the same, “global,” cutoff date for
all countries, which is 80 days after January 22, 2020 (or April 11, 2020). We pick 80 days because
it corresponds to the second tercile of cutoff dates in our sample. Fewer dates will result in too
small sample sizes for many countries, especially those that were affected by the pandemic later
than others. For longer periods, too many countries will have already reached their plateaus, and
are thus no longer expected to obey the NBL. We then calculate our four goodness-of-fit measures
using the global cutoff date and re-estimate Equation 6. The results are reported in Table 6. Panel
A has the data for the confirmed cases. All coefficients for all four economic indicators are negative
and significant in all regressions. Panel B has the data for the death count. Again, all coefficients
in all regression are negative and significant, confirming our earlier findings.
Second, we use 45 days since the first case for each country. We again select the second
tercile. We re-estimate Equation 6 for the new measures of the goodness-of-fit. The results are
presented in Table 7, which are largely consistent with our previous findings.21 Finally, we use the
following “window” approach: instead of using one cutoff date, we estimate a series of goodness21
Observe that we still include the N umber of Daysi control variable. This variable in general is different from
the number of days between the first case for the country and the cutoff date because it counts only the days with
nonzero number of cases (or deaths). For many countries, especially during the first weeks of the pandemic, there
were days with zero confirmed cases (or deaths) after the first case.

The table presents robustness results using global cutoff value which is April 11, 2020. We estimate equation 6 using OLS for first-digit goodness-of-fit
measures. Panel A shows the results for the cumulative number of confirmed cases, while panel B shows the results for the cumulative number of deaths.
To avoid small coefficients, we divide EIU, UHC, and No. of Days values by 100 for all models. Sample sizes vary due to missing values. P -values for a
one-tailed t-test are in parentheses. ***, ** and * denote significance at the 1%, 5% and 10% levels, respectively. All variable definitions are in Appendix
A2.

of-fit measures over a range of dates (specifically, we try ±1, ±3, and ±5 days around the original
cutoff date). We find the average over those values, and re-run regression 6. Again, the results are
unchanged (untabulated). We conclude that our results are not driven by the specific selection of
the cutoff dates for the growth part of the data.
Another concern is that our data might be driven by countries with few cases or few data points.
To test for that, we exclude countries with lower than 200 (500 and 1,000) total confirmed cases.
We then exclude countries with fewer than 30 (40) days of nonzero cases. We also exclude countries
with the highest 1% (5%) goodness-of-fit measures. In reported tests, we find that the results are
robust in all cases. We conclude that our results are not driven by small countries, countries with
a small number of cases, or by extreme deviations from the NBL.

5.3

Regional Data

Testing for compliance with the NBL requires sufficient data. For many countries in our analysis, the
goodness-of-fit measures are calculated based on relatively small samples sizes between 40 and 140
days. Even though we control for the sample size and conduct robustness checks, making inferences
from results based on such small sample sizes might be problematic. The sample size may increase
significantly for a country if it reports data at a regional (state, territory, or provinces) level. Each
reported value at the regional level can then be used to estimate goodness-of-fit measures, instead
of using the country-level data. The method has the upside that the goodness-of-fit measures are
estimated with a greater precision, though the downside is the lack of countries that collect regional
data.
Fifty out of 185 countries in our sample collect regional-level data.22 For these countries,
we re-estimate the goodness-of-fit measures and re-run Equation 6. The results are reported in
Table 8.23 Panel A depicts the confirmed number of cases; Panel B the number of deaths. For
the cumulative number of cases, 12 out of 16 coefficients are negative, with eight demonstrating
significance. For the cumulative number of deaths, all coefficients are negative and significant, even
with the much smaller number of countries for these tests. The results are consistent with our
earlier finding: countries with higher democracy indices, GPD per capita, health expenditures, and
universal healthcare coverage are less likely to manipulate pandemic data, especially the number
of deaths. We further conclude that our findings are not driven by the errors in goodness-of-fit
measures.

5.4

The Case of the United States

The United States of America collects data not only at a state level, but also at the county level.
This enables a deeper analysis of individual states. The Unites States is classified as a “flawed
democracy” by the Economist Intelligence Unit Democracy Index, with around $60,000 GDP per
capita, an unprecedented 17% of GDP spent on healthcare expenditures, and a high value of the
Universal Health Coverage Index: 84. Appendix A1 shows that there is no systematic indication
of COVID-19 data manipulation, either for the cumulative number of confirmed cases, or for the
cumulative number of reported deaths: all goodness-of-fit measures are below critical values at
the 1% significance level. Yet, much controversy exists as to whether individual states manipulate
COVID-19 data (King 2020; Smith et al. 2020). Mass media outlets argue that state governments

Note the slightly smaller number of observations. For the second-digit test to work, the data should be at least
over ten.

The table presents the results using regional data from 50 selected countries. We estimate equation 6 using OLS for first-digit goodness-of-fit measures.
Panel A shows the results for the cumulative number of confirmed cases, while panel B shows the results for the cumulative number of deaths. To avoid
small coefficients, we divide EIU, UHC, and No. of Days values by 100 for all models. Sample sizes vary due to missing values. P -values for a one-tailed
t-test are in parentheses. ***, ** and * denote significance at the 1%, 5% and 10% levels, respectively. All variable definitions are in Appendix A2.

downplay the spread of the virus for political gains. It is not clear, however, if there is a crosssectional difference in the political parties of the state’s governments (i.e., the legislative branch, or
senate, and the executive branch, or governor) in a particular state’s misreporting of data. To see
if political systems drive the differences between states, we conduct a modified analysis, when we
treat each state as a separate “country.” We measure the GDP per capita and HE GDP variables
at the state level. We then substitute the EIU regime indicator with three alternative political
indicators: W on, a dummy variable indicator that the incumbent U.S. president (Republican) won
the state during the previous election; Senate, a dummy variable indicator that the state legislature
derives its majority from the same political party as the current U.S. president; and Governor, a
dummy variable indicator that the governor of the state is from the same party as the incumbent
U.S. president.
We re-estimate the end of the pandemic growth period and, using county level data, re-calculate
the eight goodness-of-fit measures (four for the cumulative number of confirmed cases, and four for
the cumulative number of deaths). We then estimate Equation 6. The results are shown in Table
9. The ln(GDP ) is mostly insignificant. The negative sign of HE GDP in all tests is consistent
with our previous findings, albeit the coefficients lack significance in most regressions. W on and
Senate are positive and significant in all tests, indicating that states that voted for the incumbent
U.S. president and have governments led by the same political party are more likely to manipulate
the pandemic data. We also show that the results for the two variables are stronger for the death
toll than the number of confirmed cases, consistent with our earlier findings. We highlight here
that the sample size for the U.S. tests is much smaller than the original sample, consisting only of
50 states. Finally, the Governor variable is insignificant throughout.

5.5

Second Digit Tests

The NBL can be extended to digits beyond the first (O’Keefe and Yom 2017 and Hussain 2010).
Beyond the second digit, the theoretical distribution quickly converges to uniform. Diekmann
(2007) notes that, when fabricating data, test subjects also naturally lean toward smaller first
digits, resulting in Benford-like distributions of fabricated data. He suggests that in some cases
the second-digit test may provide a clearer assessment of data manipulation. Therefore, we repeat
our tests but use the second-digit goodness-of-fit measures instead of the leading digit. Our sample
size drops somewhat, especially for the number of deaths, because the test requires values higher
than ten. The results are presented in Table 10, again, with two panels: one for the confirmed
number of cases, and one for the number of deaths. In Panel A, all coefficients are negative and
nine out of 16 coefficients are significant. In Panel B, all coefficients are negative, and, except for
two coefficients for U HC, none are significant. We conclude that second-digit test results accord
with our main findings.
In unreported tests, we also combine our robustness checks, i.e., we conduct tests using regional
data and second-digit tests for global cutoff dates and during the 45 days since the first case for
each country. Our findings are not affected by choice of the test method or time period.

5.6

Swine Flu Pandemic of 2009-2010

A natural extension to our study is to see if the negative relationship between goodness-of-fit
measures and economic indicators holds for other pandemics. The unit of observation in our study
is a country, but pandemics that engulf many countries and for which data are available are rare
in modern history. One natural candidate is the recent swine flu (H1N1) pandemic of 2009–2010.
Swine flu (H1N1) 2009–2010 was a pandemic that lasted over 19 months between January of 2009

The table presents the results using equation 6 with U.S. state level data. In addition to state GDP and HE GDP values, we also include three dummy variables
indicating the political party affiliation in each state, which equals one if Republican is dominant, and 0 otherwise. Panel A shows the results for the cumulative number
of confirmed cases, while panel B shows the results for the cumulative number of deaths. To avoid small coefficients, we divide No. of Days values by 100 for all models.
All models are estimated using OLS regression. P -values for a one-tailed t -test are in parentheses. ***, ** and * denote significance at the 1%, 5% and 10% levels,
respectively. All variable definitions are in Appendix A2.

The table presents the results of equation 6 using OLS for second-digit goodness-of-fit measures. Panel A shows the results for the cumulative number of
confirmed cases, while panel B shows the results for the cumulative number of deaths. To avoid small coefficients, we divide EIU, UHC, and No. of Days
values by 100 for all models. Sample sizes vary due to missing values. All models are estimated using OLS regression. P -values for a one-tailed t-test are
in parentheses. ***, ** and * denote significance at the 1%, 5% and 10% levels, respectively. All variable definitions are in Appendix A2.

and August 2010. The pandemic affected 58 countries, with tens of thousands (in some estimates,
millions and even hundreds of millions) of people infected and tens of thousands (in some estimates,
hundreds of thousands) of deaths.
Even though the pandemic happened in relatively recent times and after the advent of the
Internet, surveillance data availability and reporting was much more limited in 2009 than during
COVID-19. Many countries did not collect daily or even weekly data, reporting was limited, and
there was little public availability of data. As a result, only a very small number of studies directly
test the accuracy or manipulation of data during the swine flu (H1N1) 2009–2010 pandemic (a
notable exception is the study by Idrovo, Fernández-Niño, et al. 2011). The WHO, Pan American
Health Organization (PAHO), and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provide
many estimates for the total number of cases and deaths, but these cannot be used with the
Newcomb-Benford test because the test gauges human intervention in actual reported data.
To apply the NBL test, we collect data for 35 countries in the Americas that provided weekly
reports of the number of confirmed cases and deaths to the PAHO. We obtain the data for the
weekly number of confirmed cases and the distribution of first digits from Idrovo, Fernández-Niño,
et al. (2011). The data for the weekly number of deaths is downloaded from the PAHO website.24
We then repeat the analyses and re-estimate regression 6 for swine flu (H1N1) 2009-2010 data. For
the economic indicators, we use 2009 values. The results are reported in Table 11. Panel A depicts
the results for the number of confirmed cases. Out of 16, 12 coefficients in front of macroeconomic
indicators are negative. It should be noted that the sample size for this test is extremely small,
with at most 35 countries. Obtaining significant results with such small sample sizes is challenging.
Yet, we are able to obtain significant coefficients for five coefficients, and two more just barely lack
significance. Panel B illustrates the results for the number of deaths. The sample size for Panel B
is even smaller: 14 out of 16 coefficients are negative, and seven are significant. We conclude that
the swine flu (H1N1) 2009–2010 results are largely consistent with our findings for the COVID-19
pandemic.

Discussion and Conclusion

In this paper, we investigate the relationship between the accuracy of reported data and macroeconomic indicators for a set of 185 countries affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. We use the
deviation from the Newcomb-Benford law of anomalous numbers as a proxy for data manipulation.
For approximately one-third of countries, we document some evidence of data manipulation, especially for the death toll. We find the negative relationship between the four NBL goodness-of-fit
measures and four economic indicators. We also find that the relationship is stronger for the number of deaths than for the number of confirmed cases. Overall, we conclude that democratic regimes
and more economically developed countries, and countries with stronger healthcare systems, provide more accurate data during pandemics. Authoritarian regimes and poorer countries, on the
other hand, are more likely to manipulate data, specifically the death toll. We do not believe that
our results are driven by noise in the data or the specific method used because they are robust to
alternative testing periods, and are not driven by small countries, countries with a small number
of cases, or extreme deviations from the NBL. We also show that the relationship holds for 50
countries that report regional data, for second-digit tests, and for the previous swine flu (H1N1)
pandemic.
The interpretations of our findings assume that deviations from the Newcomb-Benford law are
indicative of data manipulation. Indeed, many studies in macroeconomic, accounting, finance,

The table presents the results of 2009-2010 Swine Flu Pandemic analysis for 35 PAHO countries. We estimate equation 6 using OLS for first-digit goodnessof-fit measures. Panel A shows the results for the cumulative number of confirmed cases, while panel B shows the results for the cumulative number of deaths.
To avoid small coefficients, we divide EIU, UHC, and No. of Days values by 100 for all models. Sample sizes vary due to missing values. P -values for a
one-tailed t-test are in parentheses. ***, ** and * denote significance at the 1%, 5% and 10% levels, respectively. All variable definitions are in Appendix A2.

and forensic analysis demonstrate that human intervention and data manipulation create data sets
that violate the NBL. Many naturally occurring processes, on the other hand, generate data that
obey the law. This makes the NBL a useful tool to detect data manipulation. However, several
limitations to our study should be mentioned. Although we use compliance of data with the NBL
as a proxy for non-manipulation of data, alternative interpretations of our findings are possible.
The test works only if the data are expected to obey the NBL. Several indicators suggest that the
pandemic data are a good candidate to test with the NBL. In addition, we use careful techniques
to separate the “growth” part from the data. However, if the pandemic data are not supposed to
follow the Newcomb-Benford law, then the observed relationship can be explained by the expected
deviation from the law based on other factors, like sample size and the span of the data. We control
for these effects in our tests.
The aim of this paper is not to provide evidence whether a particular country manipulates data.
Such claims require precise estimations of the goodness-of-fit measure and clear evidence that the
country’s expected distribution is indeed the NBL. The number of days since the beginning of the
pandemic and before a country reaches a plateau (when the NBL is no longer applicable) is small.
Therefore, the goodness-of-fit measures are estimated with error and conclusions for individual
countries are difficult to state with utmost certainty. In contrast, this study documents a general
relationship between macroeconomic indicators of countries and their tendency to report inaccurate
data. The paper leads to a question about whether falsifying data during pandemics is a short-lived
strategy for governments. Does it have immediate payback or is it sustainable over the long run?
We should also note that even though the Newcomb-Benford test is less sensitive to noise in the
data, there is still some chance that the divergence from the expected distribution is not due to the
deliberate supply of falsified of data but the low quality or structural breaks in the data.
Our paper highlights the importance of independent projects to verify data supplied by the
governments. Further research is needed that would combine different methods that test for data
manipulation, including the Newcomb-Benford law, biostatistics, moments of distributions, excess
mortality rates, and social media data. Even more important is research related to methods that
can prevent data manipulation and fraud during pandemics.

Appendix A2
Table A2.1: Variable Definitions
Variable Names

Definitions

Chi-sq. Conf.

Chi-squared statistic based on the cumulative number of confirmed cases, calculated as in formula
1.

Kuipier Conf.

Kuiper statistic based on the cumulative number of confirmed cases, calculated as in formulae 2 and
3.

M Conf.

M-statistic based on the cumulative number of confirmed cases, calculated as in formula 4.

D Conf.

D-statistic on the cumulative number of confirmed cases, calculated as in formula 5.

Chi-sq. Death

Chi-squared statistic based on the cumulative number of deaths, calculated as in formula 1.

Kuiper Death

Kuiper statistics based on the cumulative number of deaths, calculated as in formulae 2 and 3.

M Death

L-statistics based on the cumulative number of deaths, calculated as in formula 4.

D Death

D-statistics based on the cumulative number of deaths, calculated as in formula 5.

EIU

The Economist Intelligence Unit Democracy Index. It is presented on a scale of 0 to 100. The index
consists of five components.

ELECT

Electoral pluralism

GVMT

Functioning of the government

PART

Political participation

CULT

Political culture

LIBERT

Civil liberties

GDP per capita

Gross domestic product divided by midyear population. GDP is the sum of gross value added by all
resident producers in the economy plus any product taxes and minus any subsidies not included in
the value of the products. It is calculated without making deductions for depreciation of fabricated
assets or for depletion and degradation of natural resources. Data are in current U.S. dollars.

HE GDP

Level of current health expenditure (% of GDP). Level of current health expenditure expressed as a
percentage of GDP. Estimates of current health expenditures include healthcare goods and services
consumed during each year. This indicator does not include capital health expenditures such as
buildings, machinery, IT and stocks of vaccines for emergency or outbreaks.

UHC

Coverage index for essential health services. UHC is the coverage index for essential health services
(based on tracer interventions that include reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health, infectious diseases, noncommunicable diseases and service capacity and access). It is presented on a scale
of 0 to 100.

FH DEM

A dummy variable, which equals one if the country is on the list of electoral democracies by the
Freedom House, and zero otherwise.

FH AV

The sum of two measures of democracy, political freedom and civil liberties, provided by the Freedom
House

No of Days Conf.

Number of non-zero days of daily new confirmed cases.

No of Days Death.

Number of non-zero days for daily new deaths.

Population

Population of a country.

Cutoff value

The earliest date with the maximum 7-day moving average number of new confirmed cases for the
country.

†

The first 8 variables are goodness-of-fit measures: Chi-sq. Conf., Kuipier Conf., M Conf., D Conf., Chi-sq. Death, Kuiper
Death, M Death and D Death. They are calculated with 3 cutoff points: using the cutoff for the growth part, using 80 days
since January 22, 2020, and using 45 calendar days since the first nonzero case for individual countries. In addition, we
apply a so-called “window” approach.
