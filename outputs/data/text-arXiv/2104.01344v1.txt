Abstract Detecting changes in COVID-19 disease transmission over time is a key indicator of epidemic growth.
Near real-time monitoring of the pandemic growth is crucial for policy makers and public health officials who need to
make informed decisions about whether to enforce lockdowns or allow certain activities. The effective reproduction
number R t is the standard index used in many countries for this goal. However, it is known that due to the delays
between infection and case registration, its use for decision making is somewhat limited. In this paper a near real-time
COVINDEX is proposed for monitoring the evolution of the pandemic. The index is computed from predictions obtained
from a GAM beta regression for modelling the test positive rate as a function of time. The proposal is illustrated using
data on COVID-19 pandemic in Italy and compared with R t . A simple chart is also proposed for monitoring local and
national outbreaks by policy makers and public health officials.

1. Introduction
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared coronavirus disease (COVID-19) a pandemic on 11
March 2020. Since then, most countries around the world have addressed this threat by implementing various strategies to fight the pandemic. From simple preventive measures, such as case identification and contact tracing, quarantine and isolation, to more severe strategies based on general
lockdowns of all non-essential economical and social activities. Since public health decision-making
requires the balancing of numerous, and often conflicting, factors, a timely and data-informed decision making process appears crucial.
The basic reproduction number, R0 , is an indicator of the epidemic’s virulence. It is defined as the
average number of infections caused by an infected person when the whole population is susceptible,
and for SARS-CoV-2 is between 2 and 3 (Li et al., 2020; Hilton and Keeling, 2020). As the pandemic
evolves, the effective reproduction number R t is a more useful measure. This is the average number
of infections that an infected person will cause. An R t above 1.0 indicates that the outbreak is
growing, and below 1.0 means that it is shrinking. As a simple understood measure, R t is publicly
reported every week, and it has been used in many countries, including Italy, to decide whether
to tighten or loosen control measures. However, R t suffers from several drawbacks when used to
monitor the transmission of the disease over time, the main one being the delay with which it signals
the evolution of the pandemic (Gostic et al., 2020; Adam, 2020). Therefore, with a delay on the
estimate of R t between ten days to two weeks, the use of R t as a near real-time decision-making tool
appears rather pointless.
This paper introduces a COVID-19 index, called COVINDEX, which tries to assess whether the
epidemic is growing, shrinking, or holding steady. The proposed index is estimated by modelling the
percent positive rate (PPR), also called test positive rate (TPR), with a GAM beta regression model.
TPR is an easily computed statistic, defined as the percentage of all COVID-19 tests performed on a
given day that are actually positive. This metric can be used to understand the spread of the virus,
but it also offers a measure of how adequately a country is testing. TPR can be high if the number
of positive tests is too high, but also if the number of total tests is too low. Most developed countries
faced limited testing capacity during the initial phase of the pandemic, which resulted in high TPR
values due to testing conducted primarily on symptomatic individuals. In the following months
the ability to administer tests using PCR (polymerase chain reaction) or molecular swabs largely

increased, leading to a situation that allows both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals to be
tested. Although TPR can’t be used for estimating incidence of the virus in the general population,
a fundamental epidemic parameter that would require a carefully designed sampling plan, it can be
used for monitoring the evolution of infection and transmission in the community. Higher positive
rates suggest the need for further restrictions, such as wearing masks and physical distancing, to slow
down the spread of the disease. As a rule of thumb, World Health Organization recommended 5%
as the threshold for the percent positive rate to declare the COVID-19 transmission under control.
The main advantages of the proposed COVINDEX is the use of data routinely collected and its
timely estimation which provides a near real-time tool to assess the effectiveness of interventions
and to inform policy. Furthermore, since it is based on a statistical model, the associated uncertainty
can be estimated.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the GAM beta regression model, its estimation and uncertainty assessment. Section 3 describes the proposed COVINDEX and its usage for
monitoring the pandemic evolution. Section 4 includes a detailed analysis of COVID-19 pandemic
in Italy, including the estimation of COVINDEX, from early March 2020 to the end of March 2021.
Section 5 contains a comparison between the proposed COVINDEX and the effective reproduction
number, showing the advantages of COVINDEX as near real-time monitoring tool. The final section
provides some concluding remarks.

2. Statistical Model for the Test Positive Rate
2.1. GAM beta regression

Let y t be the test positive rate (TPR), defined as the ratio of the number of new positive cases Pt
to the number of tests Tt at time t. As a proportion TPR is naturally limited in the range [0, 1].
Several approaches and models can be used for response variables that are expressed as proportions
(Douma and Weedon, 2019), and perhaps the most popular statistical model is the beta regression
model (Ferrari and Cribari-Neto, 2004; Zeileis and Cribari-Neto, 2010).
Assume that TPR can be modelled by a beta distribution written as
y t ∼ Beta(µ t , φ),
with mean and variance of the beta distribution given, respectively, by
E[ y t ] = µ t ,
and
V[ y t ] =

µ t (1 − µ t )
.
1+φ

The mean µ t can be expressed as a function of the linear predictor η t = β> x t , where β is a vector
of unknown regression coefficients, and x t is the vector of observed values on, say, p predictors.
Usually, the logistic function is used in beta regression, so we can write
µ t = logistic(η t ) =

exp(η t )
1
=
.
1 + exp(η t ) 1 + exp(−η t )

The inverse of the logistic function is the logit function, the so-called link function in GLM terminology (McCullagh and Nelder, 1989), given by:


µt
logit(µ t ) = log
= ηt .
1 − µt
Generalized Additive Models (GAMs; Hastie and Tibshirani, 1990) allows to model the dependence of the response variable in a flexible way using smooth functions of the predictors by defining
the linear predictor as
p
X
η t = β0 +
f j (x t j ),
j=1

arXiv | April 6, 2021 | 2

PK
where f j (x t j ) = k=1 β jk B jk (x t j ) is the smoothing term for the jth predictor with {B jk ()}Kk=1 a set
of known basis functions associated to unknown parameters β jk . Several smoothers can be defined
by adopting different basis functions, such as penalized regression splines, cubic regression splines,
and thin plate regression spline. For an overview of the several smoothing functions available using
spline bases see Wood (2017, Chapter 5).
In our application the only feature included in the linear predictor is time, so x t is an integer
counting the days since January 1st, 2020. To some extent, the coding of such feature has no practical
consequence, and other equivalent forms could have been used as well. Thus, in our case the linear
predictor of GAM simplifies to
K
X
η t = β0 +
βk Bk (x t ).
k=1

Thin plate regression splines are used for the basis {Bk }Kk=1 ,. These produce penalized reduced rank
smooth terms without the need to specify the knots. Note, however, that other smooth functions
would have given nearly equivalent results.
2.2. Estimation

Estimation of the GAM model introduced in previous section can be pursued by REstricted Maximum
Likelihood (REML), which amounts to maximize the penalized log-likelihood
1
` P (β) = `(β) − λβ> Sβ.
2

(1)

The last term in the right-hand side represents the smoothing penalty, with λ a smoothing parameter,
and S a known penalty matrix. The selection of the smoothing parameter can be obtained, among
many other proposals, by minimizing the Akaike’s information criterion (AIC).
However, because the number of administered swabs is not constant over time, we must take into
account this fact when modelling the test positive rate. There are several reasons for this empirical
evidence. First of all, during the weekends (especially on Sundays) the number of swabs drops
drastically. Furthermore, during periods of strong expansion of the pandemic, the monitoring system
is unable to carry out effective surveillance and only symptomatic patients are likely to be tested.
Accounting for the different number of swabs in the model for the positive rate can be achieved by
adopting a weighted penalized log-likelihood criterion. This amounts to replace the log-likelihood
`(β) in (1) with the weighted version
`W (β) =

n
X

w t `( y t |β),

t=1

where w t are prior weights specifying the contribution of each data point to the log-likelihood. In
particular, indicating with T̄ the average number of administered swabs over the period, weights can
be defined as w t = Tt / T̄ so that positive rates y t computed from number of swabs larger than the
average have proportionally larger weights, and vice versa for those rates based on number of swabs
smaller than the average. Furthermore, with the adopted definition for the weights the contribution
of each datum is specified without changing the overall magnitude of the log-likelihood.
Once the model is fitted, the predicted TPR can be computed as

2.3. Uncertainty and inference

The penalized likelihood approach described above has also a Bayesian interpretation by assuming
an improper multivariate normal prior on β. In this case, the REML estimates of β coefficients are
also the MAP of the Bayesian posterior distribution, with the latter given by
b (bI + λS)−1 ),
β|(y, λ) ∼ N (β,

(3)

b (Wood,
where bI is the observed information matrix (Hessian of the negative log-likelihood) at β
2017, Section 6.10). This result is useful for computing approximate credible intervals for any function of β by simulating from the posterior (Gelman and Hill, 2006, Section 7.2). Wood (2017, p.
294) reported good frequentist coverage properties for such Bayesian credible intervals, with empirical coverage close to the nominal level when averaged across the domain of the function.
In practice, coefficients β ∗ are simulated from (3), and then plugged in equation (2) to get the
simulated means µ∗t . The process is replicated a large number of times, say 10 000 or more, and the
percentiles of the simulated distributions at different values of x t can be used to compute the limits
of approximate credible intervals.

3. COVINDEX as a Monitoring and Decision-Making Tool
The COVINDEX proposed in this paper is an attempt to compute a synthetic index summarizing the
evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic, which can be useful to policy makers and public health officials
for monitoring local and national outbreaks. In our proposal this is simply computed as
COVINDEX t =

bt
µ
,
b t−7
µ

(4)

the ratio of the predicted positive rate at time t to the prediction 7 days earlier. The value of 7 is
chosen because it is approximately the expected incubation time for COVID-19 (Nazar and Elfadil,
2021), and because it corresponds to the observed weekly fluctuation in testing. A COVINDEX value
larger than 1.0 means that the pandemic is growing, while a value smaller than 1.0 indicates that new
infections are slowing down. Of course, uncertainty also affects the COVINDEX and the approach
outlined in Section 2.3 for the test positive rate can be used here as well. In particular, from each
simulated series of values µ∗t , the simulated COVINDEX series can be obtained by applying equation (4), and approximate credible intervals can be computed from the percentiles of the simulated
distribution.
We argue that decisions made by policy makers should be based both on the COVINDEX, which
provides an outlook on the likely behaviour of the pandemic in the near future, and on the level of
the estimated TPR, which represents its current status. Following this idea, a TPR-COVINDEX risk
quadrant chart can be drawn (see Figure 1). This chart illustrates four potential scenarios which
represent a useful tool for a decision maker. The quadrants are defined by the dashed lines drawn
at selected threshold values. For COVINDEX the natural reference value is 1.0, with values below
it indicating a shrinking outbreak, and values higher than 1.0 indicating epidemic situations that
are increasingly worrying and out of control. Note that, since the index is a ratio, the y-axis is
expressed in logarithmic scale. For the positive rate, the threshold value can be set according to the
World Health Organization, which published a set of criteria to inform whether the epidemic is under
control. In particular, one criterion states that “[. . . ] less than 5% of samples positive for COVID-19,
at least for the last 2 weeks, assuming that surveillance for suspected cases is comprehensive” (World
Health Organization, 2019).
According to the above mentioned threshold values, the upper-right quadrant represents the
worst-case scenario, with high values of both TPR and COVINDEX. On the contrary, the best-case
scenario is the lower-left quadrant which has both low TPR and COVINDEX less than 1.0 indicating a decreasing circulation of the virus. The remaining quadrants are intermediate cases. Typical
situations will move in a clockwise direction, moving from the worst-case, represented by the red
arXiv | April 6, 2021 | 4

quadrant on top-right, to the orange quadrant at bottom-right, and eventually reaching the yellow
quadrant indicating an outbreak under control. However, in some cases the pandemic could regain
strength by getting COVINDEX values greater than 1.0, thus moving towards the top-left orange
quadrant or directly towards the worst-case situation described by the red quadrant. A description
of the Italian situation since March 2020 is discussed in Section 4.

4. Application to Italian COVID-19 Pandemic
4.1. Data

The Italian Department of Protezione Civile provides daily information on the COVID-19 pandemic,
both at the national and the regional level, in a public GitHub repository (Presidenza del Consiglio
dei Ministri – Dipartimento della Protezione Civile, 2020). Among the data contained in this repository, the cumulative number of naso-pharyngeal or molecular swabs and the corresponding positive
tests are provided. Starting with January 15th, 2021, antigen tests are also officially recorded, while
previously only some regions included them in the recorded statistics since autumn 2020. The reliability of such information is at best questionable and not available uniformly for the year 2020. For
these reasons, in our analyses we only considered the information from molecular swabs to compute
the test positive rate (TPR), a commonly used screening and diagnostic tool for COVID-19 (World
Health Organization, 2020). The plot on Figure 2 shows the observed TPR over time with points
proportional to the administered swabs.
4.2. COVINDEX estimate

Table 1 reports the summary output of the estimated beta GAM regression model for the test positive
rate in Italy from early March 2020 to end of March 2021. The amount of smoothing applied to the

positive rates are achieved in March 2020 during the first wave of pandemic, and on November 2020,
corresponding to the second wave. A resurgence of spread during the end of 2020 is followed by a
quick decrease in earlier 2021. Subsequently, the situation remained stable for about a month, but
in the second part of February another sharpe increase occurred due to the appearance of COVID-19
variants in the Italian territory.

COVINDEX

Based on the estimated model and uncertainty for the test positive rate, the COVINDEX is computed following equation (4). Figure 4 shows the estimated COVINDEX with 95% credible intervals.
Notice that the y-axis is expressed on logarithmic scale, the natural scale to visualize ratios (Wilke,
2019, , Sec. 3.2). The index fluctuates widely throughout the year 2020, following the periods of
expansion and contraction of the spread of the pandemic. After the first wave in spring 2020 we
observe a quick decreasing trend, followed by a slowly increase during the summer, corresponding
to a relaxation of the containment measures, with values significantly larger than 1.0 during August. This represents the first signal of a resurgence of the pandemic. Sharpe and large increases are
also observed during October in conjunction with the second wave that strongly affected Italy. Two
additional peaks are detected at the end of 2020 and on February 2021, corresponding to gradual
relaxation of containment measures before Christmas and mid January, with the latter that occurred
during the period of political instability associated with the change of government.

Figure 5 shows the TPR-COVINDEX risk quadrant chart for Italy, with points connected following the
temporal path, a graph also known as connected scatterplot (Haroz et al., 2015). The curve concisely
represents the evolution of both indices during the pandemic. Starting with the critical situation in
March 2020, the situation improved in the following months, moving from the red quadrant to the
orange bottom-right quadrant and then the yellow quadrant during summer 2020. By the end of
summer 2020 we observe a worsening of the situation that lead to the red quadrant in November.
In the following months there has been a constant oscillation between the red and right-orange
quadrants, indicating a serious pandemic situation.
A scatterplot of TPR vs COVINDEX is also useful for surveillance of the pandemic in different
Italian regions. Figure 6 summarizes the status of the pandemic for the Italian regions at selected
time points. A high-risk situation is observed at the beginning of November 2020, where all regions
belong to the red quadrant. The following month saw an improvement with most regions moving
towards the bottom-right orange quadrant. A more complex and varied situation is observed between
February and March 2021, with some regions moving from the red to the orange quadrant, and vice
versa for other regions.

5. A comparison of COVINDEX with the effective reproduction number
The main index used in Italy for pandemic surveillance is R t , the effective reproduction number.
The procedure employed for estimating R t is described by Guzzetta and Merler (2020) and it is
based on the Bayesian methodology of Cori et al. (2013). Details can be found at https://www.
epicentro.iss.it/coronavirus/sars-cov-2-sorveglianza-dati. An archive containing both the
data and the R script used by the Italian National Institute of Health (ISS) for computing R t is
available at https://www.epicentro.iss.it/coronavirus/open-data/calcolo_rt_italia.zip.
In this Section we provide a comparison of the proposed COVINDEX with the values of R t estimated following the procedure outlined above for Italy from March 2020 to March 2021. Furthermore, since the effective reproduction number does not provide a timely snapshot of the evolution
of the pandemic, we also provide here two examples showing the failure of R t to highlight the likely
evolution of the pandemic and we compare its behaviour with the proposed COVINDEX.
The top graph reported in Figure 7 shows the estimated curves for COVINDEX and R t . Overall, a
similar trend can be observed for the two curves, particularly since October 2020. R t appears to be
more wiggly than COVINDEX, especially during the summer 2020. Likely, this is related to the large
uncertainty in that period due to the relative small number of positive cases (around few hundreds)
observed in that period.
As mentioned in Section 4.2, the second wave of COVID-19 epidemic hit Italy between the second half of October and the beginning of November 2020, followed by a rapid decrease during the
remainder of the month. However, from the beginning of December 2020 it was evident that this
decline had stopped and that the situation was starting to get worse. This is clearly indicated by
the upward slope of the COVINDEX computed on December 5th and shown in the bottom-left graph
of Figure 7. On the contrary, the R t index calculated on the same day, with estimates considered
valid up to 14 days before, produces a curve which erroneously suggests a decline in the spread of
the pandemic. However, if the R t curve is estimated a week later, we begin to see an increase in
the spread of the pandemic (see the dotted red curve in bottom-left graph of Figure 7). The main
problem is that such alert is reported too late.
A similar situation is also faced at the beginning of March 2021. After a period of almost constant
positive rate during February 2021, with both COVINDEX and R t oscillating around 1.0, by the end
of the month there was a clear increase of the test positive rate. This was immediately signalled by
COVINDEX computed on February 28th 2021 (see bottom-right graph in Figure 7), but R t computed
on the same day was still signalling a steady state and only after a week an increasing value of R t
would have signalled the resurgence of the pandemic.

6. Final comments
In this paper we have proposed an index, named COVINDEX, that can be used for near real-time
monitoring of COVID-19 pandemic. The index is computed as the ratio of the estimated test positive rate on a given day with respect to the value estimated for a week before. Estimation of test
positive rates is obtained by statistical modelling the daily empirical positive rates calculated from
the observed data. To this end, a GAM beta regression model with weights proportional to the administered tests is fitted. By exploiting the relationship of penalized likelihood for GAMs with MAP
Bayesian estimation, credible intervals for COVINDEX can be obtained via simulation to express the
associated uncertainty.
We applied the proposed methodology to the Italian COVID-19 outbreak and we compared the
trend of COVINDEX to the effective reproduction number R t . The analyses carried out confirm that R t
is a delayed index of epidemic trend, and for this reason may provide a biased picture of the current
pandemic status. On the contrary, COVINDEX seems to provide a more up-to-date information which
can be used as a decision-making tool. This aspect is of crucial importance for all policy makers and
public health officials.
