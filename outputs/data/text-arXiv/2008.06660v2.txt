Abstract
Recent studies conclude that the global coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic decreased power sector CO2 emissions
globally and in the United States. In this paper, we analyze the statistical significance of CO2 emissions reductions
in the U.S. power sector from March through December 2020. We use Gaussian process (GP) regression to assess
whether CO2 emissions reductions would have occurred with reasonable probability in the absence of COVID-19
considering uncertainty due to factors unrelated to the pandemic and adjusting for weather, seasonality, and recent
emissions trends. We find that monthly CO2 emissions reductions are only statistically significant in April and May
2020 considering hypothesis tests at 5% significance levels. Separately, we consider the potential impact of COVID19 on coal-fired power plant retirements through 2022. We find that only a small percentage of U.S. coal power plants
are at risk of retirement due to a possible COVID-19-related sustained reduction in electricity demand and prices. We
observe and anticipate a return to pre-COVID-19 CO2 emissions in the U.S. power sector.

Introduction
Despite its disruptive impacts on economic and social activities, the global coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic could have a climate-related silver lining: a sustained reduction in carbon dioxide (CO2 ) emissions
[1, 2, 3, 4]. Several studies attribute COVID-19-related
decreases in energy demand to decreases in CO2 emissions [1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. Other studies report the impacts of COVID-19 on factors that affect power sector
CO2 emissions, such as electricity demand [11, 12, 13]
and changes to the electricity supply mix [14, 15].
We focus on the impacts of COVID-19 on power sector CO2 emissions in the contiguous United States. The
power sector in the contiguous U.S. accounts for 33%
of total U.S. CO2 emissions [16]. The power sector
is the focus of U.S. decarbonization efforts: since January 1, 2018, nine U.S. states, the District of Columbia,
and Puerto Rico enacted legislation that requires reductions in power sector CO2 emissions of 90% or greater
in those jurisdictions by 2050 or earlier; while 23 electric utilities pledged to reduce their CO2 emissions by
Preprint

80-100% by 2050 or earlier [17]. Altogether, those
state legislative actions and utility pledges amount to
an intended reduction in power sector CO2 emissions
of more than 50% by mid-century.
We estimate the statistical significance of U.S. power
sector CO2 emissions reductions from March through
December 2020 while accounting for typical variability in emissions and adjusting for weather, seasonality,
and recent emissions trends. Additionally, we estimate
the expected impact of COVID-19 on the retirement
of coal-fired power plants through 2022. The paper is
structured as follows.
In Section 2, we employ a simple probabilistic model
that accounts for weather and seasonality and captures
historical variability in factors unrelated to COVID-19,
to estimate the impact of COVID-19 on power sector
CO2 emissions (C) in the United States. We use the
model to evaluate COVID-19-related CO2 emissions reductions and the statistical significance of such reductions relative to typical variance in emissions.
In Section 3, we use the probabilistic model to determine the relative impacts of changes in electricity

generation (E) and carbon intensity of electricity supply
(C/E) on CO2 emissions, and the relative impacts on C
of changes in the electricity supplies of the three principal power generation fossil fuel sources in the U.S.:
coal, natural gas, and oil.
In Section 4, we employ economic modeling to evaluate the expected impact of COVID-19 on U.S. coal
plant retirements. We analyze the expected profitability
through 2022 of the 845 coal-fired power plant units operating in U.S. wholesale electricity and capacity markets. Those 845 coal units represent 74% of coal units,
67% of coal capacity, and 42% of power sector CO2
emissions in the contiguous U.S. [18]. To estimate the
expected profitability of coal-fired power plant units,
we use hourly historical electricity market price data,
monthly electricity market price forecasts, annual and
bi-annual capacity market price data, and data related
to the locations, operating capacities, and costs of coalfired generation units.

statistical significance and estimating the uncertainty of
outcomes impacted by seasons and other periodic variables [24, 25]. GP regressions have been used to forecast electricity demand and prices, wind and solar power
generation, CO2 emissions, battery state-of-charge, and
optimal grid management strategies, among other related applications [26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34].
We develop a GP regression that represents a counterfactual scenario in which the COVID-19 pandemic had
not occurred. It is developed using the Python GPy library [25]. The GP regression is fit on vector time series
data that describes CO2 emissions, HDDs, and CDDs in
the contiguous U.S. To forecast CO2 emissions, we fit
a constant term (bias kernel), a trend term (linear kernel), and a combination of sinusoidal terms (a standard
periodic kernel) to historical CO2 emissions data. The
constant and trend terms capture average year-over-year
trends while the periodic term, which is constrained to
model one-year periods, describes repeating seasonal
patterns in the time series. Bias and linear kernels
are used to model the impacts of population-weighted
HDDs and CDDs on CO2 emissions. The GP model is
fit using a SciPy implementation of the L-BFGS-B algorithm with five random restarts [35]. The L-BFGS-B
algorithm is a standard optimization technique [36, 37];
L-BFGS-B and multiple random restarts are commonly
used to fit GPs. Our optimization settings yield model
runs that are highly stable and reproducible. The GP
model explicitly captures weather, medium-term CO2
emissions trends, and seasonality. We attribute the remaining Gaussian noise to factors that are not modeled
explicitly, such as short-term macroeconomic changes,
discrete or non-linear changes to the power-system, and
outlier events.
The GP regression is fit to historical emissions data
for the period January 2016 through February 2020, the
last month before COVID-19-related shelter-in-place
orders took effect. This historical period is long enough
to obtain a strong model fit but not so long as to necessitate additional nonlinear approximations or more
complicated multiyear regression methods. The regression model is used to forecast emissions from March
through December 2020. Such a forecast is a probabilistic representation of what emissions would have been in
a counterfactual scenario in which COVID-19 had not
occurred.
We compare observed to forecasted data and evaluate deviations between the two. The GP methodology
allows us to estimate the statistical significance of these
deviations. The model generates Gaussian distributions
of values in each forecasted month in the counterfactual scenario. Given these Gaussian distributions, sta-

CO2 Emissions Statistically Significant?
Data
Our analysis of U.S. power sector CO2 emissions requires three types of data: net generation by fuel, emissions factors by fuel, and heating and cooling degree
days. We obtain net generation by fuel from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) Form EIA-923
[19], which reports monthly generation and fuel consumption for every power plant. We obtain Form EIA923 data for the period between January 2016 and December 2020. Monthly plant-level emissions are computed by multiplying fuel consumption for each plant
by fuel code-specific emissions factors published by the
EIA and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
[20, 21, 22]. Total CO2 emissions for the contiguous U.S. are evaluated by aggregating plant-level emissions. We obtain population-weighted heating degree
day (HDD) and cooling degree day (CDD) data from
the EIA [23].
Methods
We employ a Gaussian process (GP) regression
model to forecast CO2 emissions in the contiguous
United States. GP regression models are a class of
Bayesian nonparametric models. They assume that every finite collection of random variables has a multivariate normal distribution. GP regressions can be used, as
in our case, to forecast the likely ranges of variables corresponding to future periods based on observed historical data. GP regressions are appropriate for testing the

Figure 1: Expected and observed CO2 emissions (C). GP regression is used to provide probabilistic estimates of expected CO2
emissions in the absence of COVID-19. The GP 95% confidence interval describes the range in which CO2 emissions are expected
95% of the time, as depicted by rectangular bars for each month. The lines in the middle of the bars denote expected values and
the “X” points denote observed values. Observed CO2 emissions are outside of (lower than) the 95% confidence intervals in only
two forecasted months: April and May 2020.

tistical hypothesis testing amounts to determinations of
95% confidence intervals (CIs) and a simple decision
rule: if the observed CO2 emissions level is outside of
the 95% CI, we reject the null hypothesis that the observation could have occurred with reasonable probability
in the absence of COVID-19. In other words, if the observed CO2 emissions level is outside of the 95% CI,
we infer statistically significant impacts of COVID-19
on CO2 emissions. If the observed value is within the
95% CI, we accept or fail to reject the null hypothesis
and conclude that deviations are not statistically significant under our decision rule.

We report the numerical results of the GP regression in Table 1. Column “C” shows the percent deviations from GP regression mean values and 95% CI
bounds, in units of percent deviation, for each month
March through December 2020. CO2 emissions values
were lower than GP mean values from March through
October 2020 and higher in November and December
2020. However, those deviations are outside of predicted 95% CIs in just two months immediately after
shelter-in-place orders took effect, April and May 2020.
Deviations are not statistically significant for any of the
other ten months in the period.
Figure 1 shows that one monthly historical deviation
from the GP regression mean, in January 2018, is outside of the 95% confidence interval. In January 2018,
the “bomb cyclone” weather event in the Northeast and
Mid-Atlantic caused electricity demand to increase and
for relatively high-cost oil- and dual-fired generation resources to help meet that demand [38, 39].

Results
We show in Figure 1 deviations from the predictive
distributions of power sector CO2 emissions generated
by the GP regression. CO2 emissions are reported in
million metric tonnes (MMT) of CO2 on an annualized
basis. The black points show historical CO2 emissions
values computed using Form EIA-923 and used to fit
the GP regression model, and the red points show observed CO2 emissions values for COVID-19-concurrent
months. The red points are not fitted to the GP regression model. The 95% CIs are shown by the shaded
bars. Blue bars show historical variability in CO2 emissions and red bars show forecasted variability in the
counterfactual scenario. The horizontal line within each
95% CI bar shows each GP regression mean (expected)
value.

Assessment of the Impacts of E and C/E on COVID19-Related CO2 Emissions
We extend upon the statistical hypothesis tests that we
present in Section 2 to determine the relative impacts of
changes in electricity generation (E) and carbon intensity of electricity supply (C/E) on reductions in power
sector CO2 emissions. We describe the data sources and
methods that are used to estimate the impacts of changes

The steps we perform to obtain CO2 emissions time
series are described in Section 2. We follow analogous steps to derive time series for E and C/E. Additionally, we use the same data sources that are described in
Section 2 for data related to CO2 emissions, electricity
generation, electricity generation by fuel type, and CO2
emissions by fuel type.

Methods
We assess counterfactual and observed values of electricity generation (E) and carbon intensity of electricity
supply (C/E). The counterfactual scenario assumes the
continuation of historical power sector CO2 emissions
in the absence of COVID-19. The same probabilistic
modeling framework that is described in Section 2 is
used to estimate counterfactual values for E and C/E.
As in our counterfactual analysis of CO2 emissions,
we include a linear kernel, a bias kernel, and a constrained standard periodic kernel in the GP regressions
to capture both short-term and medium-term trends in E
and C/E over a period from January 2016 to February
2020. Linear and bias kernels are also used for HDD
and CDD data. The GP regression-defined counterfactual data is compared to observed data from March to
December 2020.

relationships between those terms are not modeled. As

Will COVID-19 Accelerate U.S. Coal Plant Retirements?

Columns “E” and “C/E” in Table 1 show the percent deviations from GP regression mean values and
95% CI bounds for E and C/E, respectively, relative to
what we would expect in the counterfactual scenario in
each month March through December 2020. Fig. 2 and
Fig. 3 show the observed values, GP regressions, and
counterfactual values for E and C/E, respectively. Fig.
2 shows that the observed values of E are outside of
(lower than) the 95% CIs in six months: March, April,
May, June, August, and October 2020. The observed
values of C/E are outside of (lower than) the 95% CIs in
only the two months that followed COVID-19 shelterin-place orders: April and May 2020 (Fig. 3).
Additional GP regressions are performed to estimate
the relative impacts on C/E associated with changes in
coal-, natural gas-, and oil-fired electricity generation.
The results of those GP regressions are shown in Table 2. The fuel-specific GP regressions exhibit more
uncertainty than the regressions of C, E, and C/E. For
example, the forecasted 95% CI for coal generationrelated CO2 emissions in April 2020 accounts for +/24.9% of the mean forecasted value. This implies that
that historical fuel-specific CO2 emissions, HDD, and
CDD data are less predictive of future fuel-specific CO2
emissions using GP regressions than the same for total
(fuel-agnostic) CO2 emissions, E, or C/E. Nevertheless,
we find that the average reductions in CO2 emissions
from coal- and natural gas-fired electricity generation
are 8.6% and 2.0%, compared to an average increase in
oil-fired generation of 12.7%. In the next section, we
assess whether COVID-19 could accelerate coal-fired

Coal generation capacity and utilization in the U.S.
decreased every year after a peak in 2008 [40]. Such
decreases persisted in recent years despite policy interventions by the Trump administration intended to support the coal industry [41]. Decreases in coal generation
were driven by reductions in natural gas prices, flat or
negative growth in electricity demand, and increasing
state-level support for renewable generation technologies [42, 43, 44]. Additionally, some financial institutions are reluctant to support new coal power plants and
refurbishments [45, 46].
In this section, we assess whether COVID-19 could
accelerate coal plant retirements in the contiguous U.S.
To evaluate potential retirements, we estimate the expected profitability through 2022 of each of the 845
coal-fired power plant units in the seven unbundled
power market regions in the U.S. Those coal-fired
power plant units comprise 74% of coal units, 67% of
coal capacity, and 42% of power sector CO2 emissions
in the contiguous U.S. [18].
Profitability is estimated in two scenarios: a counterfactual scenario in which we employ an electricity market price forecast developed prior to COVID-19-related
shelter-in-place orders; and a scenario that reflects current expectations in which we use observed electricity
market prices from March to December 2020 and an
electricity market price forecast developed after shelterin-place orders took effect. Both energy and capacity market revenues are taken into account. We identify coal plants that were expected to be profitable prior
to COVID-19-related shelter-in-place orders but are no
longer expected to be profitable due to expected reductions in electricity demand and prices. Those plants are
considered to be at risk of retirement due to COVID-19.
Data
Estimates of coal-fired power plant profitability rely
on data related to electricity market prices and capacity
auction clearing prices. We also rely on data related
to the locations, installed generating capacities, variable
costs, and fixed costs of coal-fired electricity generation
units.
Historical hourly zonal electricity market prices are

system operators. MISO, New England, and PJM run
annual capacity auctions for forward capacity commitment periods beginning June 1 and ending May 31. New
York runs biannual capacity auctions that correspond to
a winter capacity commitment period between November 1 and April 30, and a summer capacity commitment
period between May 1 and October 31. Capacity auction clearing prices are established on a zonal basis.
We obtain actual zonal capacity auction clearing
prices through May 31, 2023 for New England. For
PJM, price data are available through May 31, 2022.
We assume that prices for the subsequent annual commitment period, ending May 31, 2023, are the averages
of the prices in the previous five periods. For MISO,
price data are available through May 31, 2021. We assume that prices for the subsequent annual commitment
periods, ending May 31, 2022 and 2023, are the averages of the prices in the previous four periods. For New
York, price data is available through April 30, 2021. We
assume that prices for the two subsequent summer commitment periods and the two subsequent winter periods
are the averages of the prices in the previous three summer and winter periods, respectively.
The locations, installed generation capacities, and
variable costs of each coal-fired electricity generation
unit in the seven U.S. electricity market regions are obtained from S&P [18]. Such data is obtained for 2019,
the latest year in which data is available. Those data
report the regional and zonal locations of each generation unit, the month and year that each unit entered
into service, the operating capacity of each unit, and the
variable and fixed costs of each unit. Coal-fired cogen-

[47]. We obtain hourly historical price data for 57 electricity market zones for the period between January 1,
2018 and December 31, 2020.
Forecasts of monthly average regional electricity
market prices are obtained from the EIA [48, 49]. The
EIA publishes monthly average wholesale electricity
market prices in a single zone in each electricity market region. Two market price forecasts published by
the EIA are obtained: a forecast published in January
2020 prior to COVID-19-related shelter-in-place orders,
and another forecast published in January 2021, after
shelter-in-place orders took effect.
Two electricity market price scenarios are constructed, hourly for each zone, from the monthly EIA
forecasts. A counterfactual hourly price scenario reflects the electricity market price forecasts from March
2020 through December 2022 published by the EIA in
January 2020. The other hourly scenario reflects our
current expectations of electricity market prices. The
current expectations scenario reflects actual historical
market prices from March through December 2020 and
electricity market price forecasts from January 2021
through December 2022. Fig. 4 shows the capacityweighted monthly average electricity prices in our counterfactual and current expectations scenarios.
Capacity auction clearing prices are obtained from
S&P for the four electricity market regions that run
forward capacity auctions: MISO, New England, New
York, and PJM [50]. In these four regions, generators submit offers to electricity system operators to provide generation capacity in a future “capacity commitment period,” in exchange for payment from electricity

eration facilities that produce both electricity and heat
are excluded. Such facilities typically supply electricity
directly to industrial and commercial facilities. It is difficult to estimate the profitability of such units because
they do not earn electricity market revenues for the electricity they supply directly to those facilities.
Finally, an estimate of the weighted average cost of
capital (WACC) of coal-fired electricity generation units
is obtained from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory Annual Technology Baseline 2019 (NREL ATB)
[51]. We adopt an annual WACC of 4.61%.

Zonal Hourly Electricity Market Prices
Profitability is estimated across two sets of electricity market prices: one set based on an electricity market
price forecast published by the EIA in January 2020,
prior to COVID-19-related shelter-in-place orders, and
another set based on actual historical prices between
March and December 2020 and an electricity market
price forecast published by the EIA in January 2021.
Each of the seven electricity market regions has multiple electricity market zones. The EIA publishes average monthly market price forecasts for each of the seven
electricity market regions. Those monthly regional market price forecasts are converted to hourly zonal market price forecasts. Such a step is necessary to accurately model expected electricity market revenues, variable costs, and capacity market revenues, which are allocated on a zonal basis. The following procedure is
performed to determine the forecasted hourly prices in
a given month and electricity market zone:

Methods
The profitability of coal-fired power plant units is estimated. The profitability (P) for a given month (m) and
generation unit (u) is calculated as that unit’s electricity
and capacity market revenues (Em,u and Cm,u , respectively) net of variable operating costs and fixed operating and maintenance (O&M) costs (Vm,u and Fm,u respectively):
Pm,u = (Em,u + Cm,u ) − (Vm,u + Fm,u )

1. For a given month and electricity market zone and
region (e.g., June, AEP zone, PJM region), average
prices in that month (e.g., June) are determined for
each of the three years prior to 2021 for which we
obtain historical data, 2018, 2019, and 2020.
2. We compute the differences of those historical average prices with the corresponding monthly price
forecast in the appropriate electricity market region (e.g., June 2020, PJM region) published by
the EIA.

We describe below the methods we use to estimate expected zonal hourly electricity market prices,
monthly electricity market revenues and variable costs,
monthly capacity market revenues, and overall profitability for the period between March 1, 2020 and December 31, 2022.

3. The hourly prices from the historical month associated with the smallest difference that we compute
in Step 2 are adopted as our hourly zonal forecast
price profile.
4. We shift the hourly zonal forecast price profile up
or down by a constant value such that the average
monthly zonal price (e.g., June 2020, AEP zone) is
equal to the average monthly regional price (e.g.,
June 2020, PJM region) published by the EIA.

annual generation capacity auctions in which those regional operators solicit bids from generation units to be
available to provide capacity in a future capacity commitment period [50].
We assume that a generation unit bids into a capacity
auction such that the unit can expect to be profitable if
its bid clears in a given capacity commitment period.
For a generation unit (u) that does not otherwise expect to be profitable in a given capacity commitment
period (cp), that unit submits a capacity bid such that
the present value of cash flows associated with its bid
(Bcp,u ) would cover the present value of the sum of its
variable costs and fixed O&M costs (Vcp,u and Fcp,u respectively) net of the present value of electricity market
revenues (Ecp,u ). For a generation unit that does expect
to be profitable in a given capacity commitment period,
that unit bids zero dollars into the capacity auction for
that period. Eq. 2 shows the bidding behavior for generation units that do not expect to be profitable in electricity markets alone, in a given capacity commitment
period.

That series of steps is applied to each forecast month
and each zone in each electricity market region. Two
sets of hourly price forecasts are developed for each
zone: one set based on monthly price forecasts published by the EIA in January 2020, prior to COVID-19related shelter-in-place orders, and another set based on
actual historical prices between March and December
2020, and monthly price forecasts published by the EIA
in January 2021.
Monthly Electricity Market Profits and Variable Costs
The electricity market revenue and variable operating
costs for a given generation unit are estimated by determining the number of hours in a month in which that
unit is online. We assume a generation unit is online for
the hours in which the electricity market price is greater
than or equal to the unit’s variable cost of operation. For
each month, we generate a price duration curve (PDC)
in which we order hourly electricity prices from highest
to lowest. The PDC is used to estimate total variable
operating costs and electricity market revenues.
The use of PDCs is illustrated in Fig. 5. In Fig. 5,
we show two PDCs that correspond to hourly electricity prices in June 2020 in the AEP zone in the PJM region. The prices in Fig. 5 (a) reflect an electricity price
forecast published by the EIA in January 2020, prior to
shelter-in-place orders, and the prices in Fig. 5 (b) reflect actual prices in June 2020. The horizontal dashed
lines reflect the variable operating cost ($/MWh) of a
coal unit in the AEP zone, “Rockport ST1.” Monthly
electricity market profits are shown in blue and monthly
total variable operating costs ($) in yellow. The vertical grey lines indicate the numbers of hours in which it
is profitable for Rockport ST1 to operate in each of the
two scenarios.
Electricity market profits and variable operating costs
are calculated for each of the 845 coal-fired generation
units in the seven electricity market regions in the U.S.

Bcp,u = Vcp,u + Fcp,u − Ecp,u

(2)

Capacity auction clearing prices are obtained or estimated for each capacity commitment period through
2022 for each of the four regions that run forward capacity auctions. Those clearing prices are established
on a zonal basis. A generation unit that submits a bid
that is equal to or lower than the auction clearing price
receives capacity market revenues. A generation unit
(u) that clears in a given commitment period (cp) in a
given zone (z) receives capacity market revenue (C) in
a given month (m) equal to the zonal auction clearing
price (Gcp,z ), in units of $/MW-day, multiplied by the
operating capacity of the unit (Ou ) and the number of
days in the month (n):
Cm,u = Gcp,z × Ou × n

(3)

Capacity market revenues are calculated for every
coal-fired electricity generation unit in New England,
New York, MISO, and PJM, and for every month in the
period from March 1, 2020 to December 31, 2022.
Overall Profitability for the Period Between March 1,
2020 and December 31, 2022
The overall profitability of each coal-fired generation
unit is estimated for the period between March 1, 2020
and December 31, 2022. The overall profitability (P)
for each unit (u) is estimated as the sum of discounted
cash flows in each month, where m ranges from 1 to 34,
the number of months in the period. Lm is the monthly

early retirement due to COVID-19. The mean age and
operating capacity of those 90 units are 59.1 years and
31.1 MW, respectively. The newest units were operational in November 2012 and the oldest unit was operational in July 1954. A single at-risk unit resides in SPP,
while the remaining units reside in MISO: 79 units in
MISO Zone 6, nine units in MISO Zone 4, and one unit
in MISO Zone 9.
Estimates of the impacts of COVID-19 on the
monthly profitability of coal-fired electricity generation
units in aggregate are illustrated in Fig. 6. Fig. 6 (a)
shows estimates in the counterfactual scenario, and Fig.
6 (b) shows estimates in the current expectations scenario. Squares represent monthly revenues, diamonds
represent monthly costs, and the shaded areas represent monthly profits or losses. Coal generation units in
total are $6.5 billion less profitable in the current expectations scenario relative to the counterfactual scenario over the entire period, in present value terms.
Of that amount, coal generation units earn $4.5 billion
less profit in the current expectations scenario in March
through December 2020.

The monthly nominal net cash flow (Lm ) is the sum

and fixed O&M costs. The profitability of every coal
generation unit is calculated in two scenarios: a counterfactual scenario that relies on an electricity market
price forecast published by the EIA in January 2020
prior to shelter-in-place orders, and a scenario that reflects our current expectations and is based on actual
prices in March through December, and a price forecast
published by the EIA in January 2021.

Results
We analyze the expected profitability from March
2020 to December 2022 of the 845 coal-fired electricity generation units operating in the seven unbundled
power market regions in the United States. 90 of the
845 coal-fired generation units, representing only 2.8
GW or 1.9% of coal generation capacity in the seven
power market regions, were expected to be profitable
prior to COVID-19 but are no longer expected to be
profitable due to COVID-19-related reductions in electricity prices. We consider those 90 units to be at risk of

Discussion
Multiple studies conclude that COVID-19 is responsible for reductions in U.S. power sector CO2 emissions [2, 5, 9, 10] and others conclude that the reduction in CO2 emissions or electricity demand is permanent [3, 4, 13, 52]. For example, researchers conclude

costs, and profits for all coal plants in aggregate are shown in (a) the counterfactual scenario and (b) the current expectations
scenario. Squares represent revenues, diamonds represent costs, and the shaded areas represent profits or losses.
in a recent report [13] that COVID-19-related shelterin-place orders could trigger a sustained long-term reduction in U.S. electricity demand of 65-160 terawatthours, or 1.6-4.0% of annual electricity demand. In
their central scenario, the authors estimate a transition
of about 11% of U.S. office workers to permanent workfrom-home positions, permanent decreases in office and
retail-related electricity consumption, and a permanent
increase in residential electricity consumption.
We find little evidence of permanent reductions in our
analysis of observed changes in U.S. power sector CO2
emissions in the context of normal historical variability. We report statistically significant reductions in CO2
emissions (C) in only April and May 2020, and thereafter a return to the levels of CO2 emissions that we
would expect in the absence of COVID-19 (Section 2
and Fig. 1).
With respect to electricity generation (E) and carbon
intensity of electricity supply (C/E)—two factors that
bear on power sector CO2 emissions—we report returns
to levels that we would have expected in the absence of
COVID-19.

For E, we observe statistically significant reductions
in March, April, May, June, August, and October 2020
compared to what we would have expected in absence
of COVID-19, but observe values within typical ranges
in November and December 2020 (Fig. 2 and Table 1).
Qualitatively, we expect E to remain in typical ranges
as economic activity in the U.S. returns to pre-COVID19 levels. While the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis
estimates that U.S. real gross domestic product (GDP)
declined 9.0% in the second quarter of 2020 relative to
real GDP in those quarters in 2019 [53], GDP in the
third and fourth quarters were only down 2.8%, and
2.5%. A first COVID-19 economic relief bill was signed
into law by President Trump on March 27, 2020 and a
second by President Biden on March 11, 2021. Owing to these developments and to the expected continued distribution of effective COVID-19 vaccinations,
the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the U.S. Congressional Budget Office, the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development,
and other authorities anticipate a return to pre-COVID19 economic growth rates in 2021 [54, 55, 56, 57, 58].

Data availability

With respect to C/E, we observe statistically significant reductions in April and May 2020 and a subsequent
return to levels that we would expect in the absence
of COVID-19 (Fig. 3 and Table 1). Nonetheless, we
show an average reduction in CO2 emissions associated
with coal-fired electricity generation of 8.6% compared
to an average reduction in natural gas-fired CO2 emissions of only 2.0% (Table 2). We explore the possibility
of COVID-19-related coal power plant retirements and
find that COVID-19 is likely to put at risk of retirement
less than 2% of coal generation capacity in the contiguous U.S. through 2022 (Section 4).
Much of the literature on the impacts of COVID19 on CO2 emissions assumes a causal relationship between the two. Ours is one of the first studies to explore
whether such a relationship exists. We do not find evidence that COVID-19 is linked to a reduction in U.S.
power sector CO2 emissions except in the two months
immediately following shelter-in-place orders. Nor do
we find evidence that COVID-19 is likely to drive out of
business more than a small percentage of U.S. coal generation facilities. We observe returns to pre-COVID-19
levels of CO2 emissions, electricity generation, and carbon intensity of electricity supply.
