Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused major disturbance to human life.
An important reason behind the widespread social anxiety is the huge
uncertainty about the pandemic. A fundamental uncertainty is how many
or what percentage of people have been infected. There are published and
frequently updated data on various statistics of the pandemic, at local,
country or global level. However, due to various reasons, many cases
were not included in those reported numbers. We propose a structured
approach for the estimation of the number of unreported cases, where we
distinguish cases that arrive late in the reported numbers and those who
had mild or no symptoms and thus were not captured by any medical
system at all. We use post-report data for the estimation of the former
and population matching to the latter. We estimate that the reported
number of infected cases in the US should be corrected by multiplying
a factor of 220.54% as of Apr 20, 2020, while the infection ratio out of
the US population is estimated to be 0.53%, implying a case mortality
rate at 2.85% which is close to the 3.4% suggested by the WHO in Mar
2020. Towards the end of the summer of 2020, the overall infection ratio
of the US rises to 2.49% while the case mortality decreases to 2.09%, and
the ratio of asymptomatic cases out of all infected cases reduces from the
pre-summer 35-40% to around 20-25%.

Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused major disturbance to human life. An important reason behind the widespread social anxiety is the huge uncertainty
about the pandemic. One major uncertainty is how many or what percentage
of people have been infected? There are published and frequently updated data
on various statistics of the pandemic, at local, country or global level. However, due to various reasons, many cases were not included in those reported
numbers. We propose a structured approach for the estimation of the number
1

of unreported cases, where we distinguish cases that arrive late in the reported
numbers and those who had mild or no symptoms and thus were not captured
by any medical system at all. We use post-report data for the estimation of the
former and population matching to the latter. We estimate that the reported
number of infected cases in the US should be corrected by multiplying a factor
of 220.54% as of Apr 20, 2020. The infection ratio out of the US population is
estimated to be 0.53%, implying a case mortality rate at 2.85% which is close
to the 3.4% suggested by the WHO in March 2020.
A flurry of work have appeared on the estimation of the number of infected
or missing cases for COVID-19. One class of methods use the case fatality
rate (CFR) as a proxy and then derive the number of infected cases from the
death tolls [8, 9]. An accurate estimate of CFR is, however, challenging due
to the use of different definitions in calculating the mortality counts in practice and also the potential inflation in the reported case mortality [9]. Indeed,
estimation through CFR may be misleading [5]. Another class of methods are
based on epidemiology models such as the susceptible, infectious, recovered,
and death (SIRD) model or its variants [16, 17]. While the idea is fairly clean,
these methods use heavy machinery such as differential equations and Markov
chain Monte Carlo simulations which require nontrivial efforts for interpretation. Additionally, [9] uses data from a benchmark country (South Korea) and
then extrapolate by expected deaths and hospitalizations to the target country,
while [2] resorts to crowd sourcing, as an approximate way of random sampling,
to estimate the ratio between the reported and the actual number of infected
cases. These methods require the benchmark and the target country be similar
in terms of cases and CFR, or a systematic way to control the sampling bias
and the quality of crowd sourcing.

non-filled bars indicate daily new infected cases of type I or II, D1 , ..., D7 are
the number of reported cases during the 1th , 2nd , ..., and 7th day past a given
report date (indicated as “Report date”).

In this work, we present a structured approach for an approximate estimation
of the number of infected cases at the US national and state level. Statistically,
the estimation of the number of unreported cases is related to inference with
missing data [13] or censored data [10]. However, certain characteristics of the
coronavirus epidemiology allow us to take a different approach. Inspired by the
2

diagnostic analysis of remote sensing studies [21] where the errors in the land
use classification were decomposed according to their sources, we distinguish
the missing counts in the reported numbers by two sources as illustrated by
Figure 1. One source is cases for which, at the time of report, the symptoms
were not emerging yet; however, the affected individuals would eventually take
a test with results reported. We call such cases the type I cases, and the waiting
period before the onset of symptoms is termed as the incubation (or dormant)
period. This is illustrated as the filled blue bars in Figure 1. At the time of
a given report date (i.e., “Report date” in Figure 1), all such cases are still in
dormant status thus are missing in the reported number. A similar figure can
be seen in the SIR compartment model considered by [23]. Note the “Report
date” in Figure 1 is just a report date that is of interest, and this is true henceforth unless otherwise specified. Usually there is a time gap between the onset
of symptoms and the time of report—the infected individual may not immediately take the test and also there might be a delay in reporting (some reported
statistics are based on the time of test though). In the lack of relevant data on
such delays and for simplicity, we take an integer value slightly larger than the
mean incubation periods and use that as the time period to report (i.e., the time
period between infection and report, see discussion on the choice of the time
window size in Section 2.1).
The second source of unreported cases are those who were infected but are
either not aware of it or with symptoms too light to bother, and later on recovered without any particular medical treatments. We call such cases the type II
cases. The type II cases are never reflected in any reported numbers, thus leaving too little clue for estimation. But we cannot overlook such cases, since the
number of such cases could be potentially large and would form an important
source of infection.
We use post-report data for the estimation of the number of type I cases, and
population matching to that of type II cases. Due to the intuitive nature and
the simplicity in implementation, our approach can be readily applied by the
general public or the health department if they wish to obtain an approximate
estimate of the actual number of infected cases in order to help understand the
situation or to assist policy making and disease control. The remainder of this
paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we will describe our approach. This
is followed by a presentation of results in Section 3. Finally we conclude in
Section 4.

Methods

As stated in Section 1, we take a structured approach by estimating the number of type I and II cases separately. These are described in Section 2.1 and
Section 2.2, respectively.

2.1

Estimating the number of type I cases

The estimation of the number of type I cases is facilitated by the following
crucial observation. Though not included in the reported number while in the

3

dormant period, such cases would eventually be exposed when the symptoms
become so severe that the individuals have to seek medical treatments. By that
time, those previously missed cases at the given report date (which was a few
days ago) would be counted towards infected cases at some later report dates
(though one would not know at which particular report date). Such numbers
should be included at the given report date but surface only several days later;
for this reason we call them delayed counts. If there is a way to estimate such
delayed counts or their total, then one can estimate the number of type I cases
for the given report date.
It will be instructive to consider a simple ideal case where all infected cases
have an incubation period of 7 days and there is no delay in test taking and
reporting. In this ideal case, the numbers D1 , D2 , ..., D6 in Figure 1 are exactly
the number of cases who were at their 6th , 5th , ..., 1st day of infection (i.e., the
time between infection and the given report date), respectively, when counted
at the given report date (i.e., “Report date” in Figure 1). As the incubation
period for all cases is 7 days, these are all the type I cases missed at the given
report date but reflected perfectly later in the number of daily reported cases
during the 6 days post-report time window (the window size is 1 day less than
the incubation period). So the total number of type I cases at the given report
P
date can be calculated by their sum, D̂type1 = 6i=1 Di .
The reality is, however, complicated. First, the incubation period (also the
time period to report) varies for individual cases. Also, during the post-report
time window, newly infected cases may arise and be reported due to their short
incubation periods. Thus the number of daily reported cases at any particular
day within this time window might be mixed, in the sense that it would include
cases that are infected both before (but were during their incubation period) and
after the given report date. The former case will not pose a problem as anyway
such cases would be counted towards D̂type1 though cases infected on the same
day may now contribute to different Di ’s. The latter case is undesirable but
could be corrected, to a certain extent, by the truncating effect when we only
sum up the daily counts in the post-report time window up to T days. That is,
those cases with a dormant period extending more than T days post-report will
be truncated and not included in D̂type1 , with the total count of such truncated
cases being ‘cancelled out’ by the newly infected cases within the time window
of length T . This leads to an estimate for the number of type I cases as
D̂type1 =

T
X

Di ,

(1)

1

where Di are now the number of cases reported at the ith day after the given
report date. By intuition from the ideal case and also accounting for the potential delay in testing and reporting, we can let T take a value around or slightly
larger than the mean incubation period.
If we can keep track of the estimate D̂type1 through time, then we can get
a time series which, upon smoothing, could be used to estimate the current
count of type I cases. For such an estimation to be feasible, we have two assumptions. One is that the daily reported counts near the given report date

would not change too abruptly. Thus, our approach may not work well when
the infection trend rises very rapidly (e.g., during the initial outbreak of the
pandemic). During such a period, the safest strategy might be to strictly enforce social distancing. The other is knowledge of the incubation period. A
number of studies have been carried out on the estimation of incubation periods, for example, [11, 12] report a median of 4–7 days, [14] gives a mean of
5.8 days, [1] reports a mean of 6.4 days and 6.8 days by fitting the Weibull and
lognormal distribution, respectively. While further studies are required, we take
T = 7 in our estimation (which we believe also partially accounts for the time
gap between the onset of symptoms and the time of report). Additionally, it
should be cautious that our estimation is valid assuming that the test of coronavirus is sufficiently carried out for the population of interest; insufficient test
would render an underestimate. Here by sufficient testing we mean whoever or
the vast majority of those with symptoms of COVID-19 would take the test.
While this was hardly true during the initial outbreak of the pandemic due to
resources constraints or public awareness of the pandemic, we believe gradually,
at least for the US, it becomes reasonably true.

Figure 2: Ratio of unreported cases of Type I w.r.t. reported cases for CT, MA
and the US, where ‘6’ and ‘7’ in the legend are the values of T used, respectively.

In Figure 2, we plot the ratio of estimated type I cases w.r.t. the reported
number of cases for Connecticut (CT) and Massachusetts (MA) since Mar 8,
2020. These two states were chosen as they are similar in many aspects, such as
geography, demography, and population socioeconomics etc which are relevant
in the spreading of COVID-19, so we expect their ratio of type I cases out of reported cases would be similar. In Figure 2, there is an initial difference in ratios
of type I cases in these two states, which we attribute to the late response and
the small number of cases tested in CT, and also possibly some random events
such as the well-known Biogen superspreader event in MA in late February.
Later, these two states exhibit strikingly similar trend, which is quite expected.
We also explore the effect of using different values of T where 6 and 7 are used.
Again, initially the resulting estimation are quite different, which indicates the
5

rapid spread of coronavirus and the rapid rise of infected cases. Gradually, the
difference in the resulting estimations diminishes, which implies that the choice
of T = 7 leads to a fairly stable estimation after the initial quick growing stage.
Similar observation can be made for the estimation of type I cases in US. This
is shown in the right panel of Figure 2. In the appendix, we give a statistical
justification on why our estimate, D̂type1 , would be a reasonable one. In particular, we derive an upper bound for the error of this estimate relative to the
reported number of infected cases and show that it would be small under mild
assumptions about the distribution of the incubation periods and the number
of daily new cases.

2.2

Estimating the number of type II cases

The estimation of the number of type II cases is challenging, as there is barely
anything observable on the asymptomatic cases. Our main strategy is based
on the matching of population statistics—using what we see well to infer what
is missing or incomplete. When grouping reported infection cases, we notice
a significant discrepancy in the count statistics by different age groups in the
US. We expect that, while people in most age groups in the population have a
similar chance of being infected, infected individuals of age 65+ are very likely
to be discovered timely. This is because people at age 65+ typically have a
relatively weaker immune system along with possible pre-existing medical conditions, and a slight symptom would prompt them to seek medical treatments.
Indeed the case mortality rate increases exponentially with age, and could be
well above 20% for seniors over 70 [20]. Thus reported counts about age groups
65+ would be more accurate and can serve as a reference to correct counts for
other age groups. On the contrary, cases for the 20-64 age group are easy to be
overlooked or unnoticed, thus their reported counts require a correction (termed
as age correction).

Table 1: Percentages by age groups in the US population (2020) and in the
reported infection cases. Note numbers in the bottom row are not normalized to
sum up to 1.
The age group of 85+ is more vulnerable to infections, as they typically live in
the senior centers or extended-care nursing facilities which, as a matter of fact,
have a very high risk of infection. The case statistics for this age group would
be very thorough, but many in this age group get infected simply because they
share a very confined living space with many other equally vulnerable seniors,
and the infection of any one in a senior center may quickly spread to the rest (to
certain extent, one may think of this as a big indoor party during the pandemic).
So statistics in this age group would not be a reliable reference for population
match, since people in other age groups have a very different mobility pattern
(the infants interact with the world through their parents thus have a chance of
6

infection not so different from the general population).
As a result of equal age susceptibility for people with an age in the range 0-84,
the number of infected cases of different age groups would be proportional to
their respective percentage in the population. Let rpop and rcase be the proportions of the reference group in the population and in the reported cases,
and xpop and xcorrected be the the respective proportions for the target group,
respectively. Then
rcase
xcorrected
=
,
rpop
xpop
and the corrected percentage in the infected cases for the target group can be
calculated accordingly. As we argue before, the case statistics for age groups
65-74 and 75-84 are reliable so they are used as the reference group. A simple
calculation reveals that age groups, 65-74 and 75-84, according to Table 1, have
a similar ratio of cases percentage: population percentage, i.e., 9.00 : 4.70 ≈
17.00 : 9.32. Thus, we can pool counts from these two groups and obtain
rcase : rpop = (9.00 + 17.00)/(4.70 + 9.32) = 1.8544.
This yields the corrected ratio as the bottom row of Table 1. Adding up numbers in the bottom row gives a total of 187.94%, implying that we should expand
the reported counts by 87.94% in order for the reported case counts to match
the population statistics across age groups. This gives the ratio of type II cases
over the reported cases.
An interesting question is, will estimated counts of type II overlap with that
for type I cases? We claim that this will not, at least not significantly, so the
addition of estimated counts for type I and II cases is valid. The reason is that,
type I cases still contribute to the reported numbers, at a delayed time though.
These delayed cases can be thought of as a sample from the reported cases (assuming that the reported cases have a stable proportion when breakdown by
age groups). The inclusion of type I cases will not change the age-breakdown
proportions. Thus, after the inclusion of type I cases, we still have the same
age-breakdown proportions and thus require an age correction.

2.3

Discussions on implications and assumptions

In this section, we will briefly discuss the implications of type I and II ratios
and the main assumptions made in our estimation.
The value of type I and II ratios can have important implications to understand the trend of the pandemic or for policy making. If there is no major
re-surge of cases, then the type I ratio will slowly decrease with time as a result
of the increasing total number of reported cases. Thus as the pandemic continues, type II cases will gradually become the main source of unreported cases.
One interesting pattern about the dynamics of type I ratios with time is that
a large value or an increase in type I ratio would indicate a quickly growing
trend or a re-surge of the pandemic; this can be seen from Figure 2 by the large
value of type I ratios in the beginning. It can serve as a strong signal for policy
makers or the health department to take immediate actions and for the public
7

to be cautious.
Type II cases are particularly harmful as they are asymptomatic, so it is always highly desirable to reduce the type II ratio. An effective way for this
is to increase the coverage of the COVID-19 tests, and to enroll as many individuals as possible (subject to testing capacity) to take the test. Since the
summer, many schools or colleges started introducing the asymptomatic test,
and we think that has been very effective in helping reduce the type II ratio
as these two groups contribute quite substantially to the asymptomatic cases.
Also, COVID-19 tests related to travel and the re-opening of many states have
helped detect many asymptomatic cases, due to the mandate testing of engaged
individuals. Additionally, as more and more individuals are infected, all their
close contacts are required to take the test although many are infected but not
developing any symptoms. Such cases could be huge due to the exponential
social network effect [7]. Studies, including our analysis on more recent data
(see appendix), show that the ratio of asymptomatic cases out of all infected
ones has reduced from the pre-summer 35-40% to around 20-25% towards the
end of the summer.
In estimating the type I ratio, we assume a stable distribution of the daily
new infected cases. This may not be realistic during the initial outbreak of
the pandemic or later sudden spikes of new cases, and our estimate will potentially overestimate during days around that period. On the other hand, during
such period, likely many cases may not be captured by the reported counts.
This leads to some cancellation effect to the overestimate, but to what extent
is a complicated issue that requires additional information. According to our
sensitivity analysis (c.f. Section 3.1), our estimate is fairly robust and incurs a
small error when there is a sudden increase of daily new cases by up to 10 times.
One major assumption in estimating the type II ratio is the equal susceptibility across age groups. This is a common assumption made by SIR models for
which ages are not explicitly modeled, and we assume this for simplicity. People in age group 0-84 are either exposed to the infection directly, or indirectly
through their family members (the chance for household infections is very high),
thus it is reasonable to assume that people in this age group have roughly the
same chance of infection during the pandemic. Indeed some studies [3] show
that the susceptibility is not sensitive to ages. We note that some work in the
literature [22, 15] explicitly models the age-specific susceptibility. However, they
either use the number of contacts for people in dense cities such as Wuhan and
Shanghai in China during a single day as a proxy for age-specific susceptibility
[22], or use simulations by locations such as working places, schools or communities etc to estimate age-specific contacts [15]. These studies omit the degrees of
contacts and the levels of protections, and explore susceptibility in a single day
(which departures from our goal, whether a person may eventually be infected
during the pandemic). Moreover, their findings are not applicable to the US
as the contact patterns among individuals would be very different, due to huge
differences in life and working styles, population density or social distancing
policy etc. We believe the difference among different age groups would be small
for a sizable population, and the equal susceptibility assumption will facilitate
a simple estimation. As many factors potentially contribute to the infection
8

and spread of COVID-19, it is challenging to estimate the age effect but it is a
worthwhile problem for further study, and clarifying it may help our estimation
and many SIR-based models.

Results

We apply our approach to each of the 50 states and the US. The data are available from Wikipedia [19]. Due to the large variation of the population size at
different states, we calculate the ratio of missing cases out of the number of
reported cases for individual states. The estimated ratios for type I cases for
individual states, as of Apr 20, 2020, are shown in Figure 3. The type I ratio
for OH, IA, ND and NE are substantially higher than others. This because the
infected cases were still quickly rising for OH, IA and ND around the time the
type I ratio was calculated. For NE, the accumulated number of reported cases
is small so the addition of new daily reported cases may easily lead to a high
type I ratio. It should be noted that the ratio of type I cases out of the reported
number will decrease as the number of daily reported cases begins stabilizing.
This can be seen from Figure 2. Due to the lack of reported case data by age

groups for some individual states, we use the overall estimate for the US, which
is 87.94% according to discussions in Section 2.2, for the ratio of type II cases
for all the states.
The overall ratio of type I cases for the US is estimated to be 32.60% by aggregating estimated type I cases from individual states. Combining with the type
II case ratio at 87.94%, this gives an estimated ratio of missing cases versus the
9

reported number at 120.54% for the US. In other words, the reported number
of cases for the US should multiply by a factor of 220.54% to reflect the true
number of infected cases. This is close to the estimate given in [4] which is
twice as large as the number of reported cases for the US as of Apr 17, 2020.
Our result implies that the proportion of cases never captured by any medical
systems out of all the infected cases is about 87.94/220.54=39.87% as of Apr 20,
2020. This is not far from estimations given by [17] which predicates that the
ratio of unidentified cases in NY, NJ, and CA by July 11, 2020 in the range between 18.49% and 33.20%. Our estimate is also consistent to a meta-analysis of
over 10 studies [6] which reports an asymptomatic ratio in the range of 15%-40%.
With the unreported numbers estimated, we can estimate the infection ratio,
defined as the ratio of the number of infected cases out of the population. The
overall infection ratio of the US is estimated to be 0.53%, or 1.75 million infected cases, as of Apr 20, 2020. If we use the associated death toll at about
50k, then the case mortality rate is calculated as 2.85%, which is close to the
WHO suggested estimation of 3.4% [18] in March, 2020. The infection ratios for
individual states are visualized as heatmap in Figure 4. Heavily hit states are
NY, NJ, CT, RI, MA, and LA with infection ratio estimated at 2.61%, 2.11%,
1.22%, 1.15%, 1.31% and 1.04%, respectively, as of Apr 20, 2020. The trend of
the infection ratio and cases over time for these states is shown in Figure 5. It
can be seen that, except LA, the infection ratios for all other five states are still
rapidly increasing. NJ shows a similar growing pattern as NY, while the three
New England states, CT, RI and MA, are similar.

analysis by simulations, with the goal of evaluating the robustness of our approach under fluctuations of daily new cases. The simulations are conducted
as follows. On each day over a span of about 100 days, we generate Ni new
infected cases with incubation periods following the lognormal or the Weibull
distribution. In a given future date, all cases whose incubation period expires
will be reported (note cases infected on different dates may be reported on the
same day or infected on the same day may be reported on different future dates).
On each day, we then compare the actually reported (or unreported) cases to
the estimated cases of type I by our algorithm.
The incubation periods are generated according to lognormal [14] or Weibull
[1]. We follow the references in their choices of parameters. The lognormal distribution has 1.63 and 0.5 as its mean and standard deviation on the log scale,
or 5.80 and 3.08 days for mean and standard deviation of incubation periods.
The shape and scale parameters for the Weibull distribution are 3.04 and 7.16,
or 6.4 and 2.3 days for the mean and standard deviation, respectively.
To simulate the fluctuation of daily infected cases, we consider four scenarios. One is that the number of daily infected cases is kept at a constant, say,
1000. For the other three cases, we let the number of daily infected cases be
sampling from intervals, [600, 1200], [400, 1600], and [200, 2000], respectively,
such that the number of new cases can potentially be 2, 4 or 10 times larger,
on a certain day, than that of a previous day. Some correlation structures can
be imposed on the number of cases during consecutive days, but we opt for
simplicity and choose not to pursue it as we aim at simulating different levels
of fluctuations of daily new cases. The window size would be 4.8 and 5.4 days

integer value, and also we may need to compensate the potential delays with
testing and reporting in practice. So we use window size 5 or 6 for lognormal,

Conclusions

We have proposed a structured approach for the estimation of the unreported
number of infected cases. We distinguish two types of missing cases, those cases
which were infected but are still during the dormant period at the time of report and those asymptomatic or light cases which later self-recover without any
medical treatments. The number of these two types of cases are estimated by
accumulating reported counts within a properly chosen post-report time window and by population matching. The reported number, as of Apr 20, 2020,
of infected cases in US should be corrected by multiplying a factor of 220.54%.
The overall infection ratio out of the US population is estimated to be 0.53%,
implying a case mortality rate of 2.85% as of Apr 20, 2020. The estimate given
by our approach also agrees or is close to related estimates by several work in the
literature. By Aug 31, 2020, the overall infection ratio in US rises to 2.49% while
the case mortality rate decreases to 2.09%, and the ratio of asymptomatic cases
out of all infected cases reduces from the pre-summer 35-40% to around 20-25%.

13

The intuitive nature of our approach makes it easy to understand and to implement, thus we expect it be readily adopted by the general public for understanding the situation or the government for policy making and disease control. Our
estimation can potentially be used for risk assessment. The infant age group
may worth further consideration as people in this group are much less risky
than other age groups as they interact with the rest of the world through their
parents, so the number of cases for this group may need to adjust accordingly
to reflect the true risk.

Appendix
This appendix consists of two parts. In the first part, we give a justification on
our estimation algorithm for the number of type I cases. In the second part, we
include analysis on the US COVID-19 data as of August 31, 2020.

A1

Error analysis in the type I estimator

In this section, we show that the error between our estimate, D̂type1 , of the
number of type I cases and its actual value Dtype1 is small in expectation under
mild assumptions about the distribution of the incubation periods.
Denote by random variable X the length of the incubation period, and for
simplicity we further assume that X ≥ 0 takes integer values. Let N−1 , N−2 , ...
denote the number of cases that were infected one day, two days and so on
before the report date (for which we use N0 ), while Ni ’s indicate those after the
report date. Here we limit to type I cases as we can conveniently assume that
type II cases have an infinite incubation period. Then the expected number of
cases that are discovered during the time window of T days following the given
report date is calculated as
Da =

∞
X

EN−i · P (i + 1 ≤ X < i + T ).

(2)

i=0

For simplicity, we would assume that all the EN−i ’s take the same value N .
This is a very mild assumption as we expect that the distribution of the number
of newly infected cases per day do not drift much when the pandemic reaches
a stable stage (those at the very far distant past would be small, but they
carry a very small fraction of the total number so could be ignored). Another
simplifying assumption is the independence of Ni ’s and the incubation period
X. Also, we abuse the notation a bit by using D. ’s to also indicate the expected
value of the associated random variable; the exact meaning will be determined

14

by the context. Then Equation (2) can be rewritten as
Da

= (T − 1) · N − N

T
−1
X

(T − i) · P (i − 1 ≤ X < i).

i=1

Under the same assumption, the number of new cases generated during the
post-report time window of length T days is
Dnew

=

T
X

ENi · P (X < T + 1 − i)

i=1

=

N

(T + 1 − i) · P (i − 1 ≤ X < i)

i=1

=

N

T
−1
X

(T − i) · P (i − 1 ≤ X < i) + N · P (X < T )

i=1

Thus the total number of reported cases during the post-report time window of
length T days is calculated as
Da + Dnew = (T − 1) · N + N · P (X ≤ T ) = T N − N · P (X > T ).
Assuming that random variable X has a finite mean, say µ, then we have
P (X > T ) ≤ EX/T = µ/T,
implying that the estimated number of type I cases satisfies
T N ≥ D̂type1 = Da + Dnew ≥ T N − N · µ/T.

(3)

The actual number of cases that have accumulated but not being discovered
before the report date consists of missing cases during the previous T days and
those even earlier cases, which has an expected value
Dtype1 =

∞
X

EN−i · P (X ≥ i + 1) = N

∞
X

P (X ≥ i) = N · EX = µN.

(4)

i=0

(4) indicates that the mean number of type I cases equals the product of the
mean daily infected cases of type I and the mean length of the incubation period,
which is consistent with the ideal case discussed in Section 2.1. This, along with
(3), suggests that the length of the post-report time window should be around
the mean of the incubation periods. Let T = (1+ǫ)µ, then we have the following
error bound for the estimated number of cases of type I
|D̂type1 − Dtype1 | ≤ µN · max(ǫ, |ǫ − 1/T |).
It follows that the relative error of the estimate satisfies
|D̂type1 − Dtype1 |
≤ max(ǫ, |ǫ − 1/T |) = max(ǫ, |ǫ − 1/((1 + ǫ)µ)|).
Dtype1
For a given µ, one can pick ǫ to optimize the above bound. For example, when
µ = 7, one can take ǫ = 0.07 to achieve a relative error bound of about 7%.

Analysis on more recent data

We repeat our analysis on data as of August 31, 2020. The data consists in a
surge of cases during the summer for many US states, with the reported case
count for US increasing by several times from about 830k to 5.94 million since
late April. For the new data, our analysis suggests that the number of reported
cases for the US be adjusted by a factor of 138.56%, with the ratio of type I
and type II cases estimated to be 5.02% and 33.54%, respectively. Both ratios
decrease significantly compared to estimates given by data up to Apr 20, 2020.
The type I ratio decreases mainly as a result of a major increase in the total
number of reported cases, from 830k to 5.94 million. The total number of infected cases in the US is estimated at 8,234,946 as of Aug 31, 2020, implying an
overall infection ratio at 2.49%. With a death toll of 171,957, this gives an estimated mortality ratio at 2.09%, which lower than the 2.85% in late Apr, 2020.
This is expected, and also observed in many other countries, either because we
have now understand more about the virus and hence more informed medical
treatments, or likely the virus has gradually become less lethal with time.

Similar as in Section 3, we show the estimated type I ratio for all 50 states
as of Aug 31, 2020 (see Figure 8). Compared to Figure 3, the type I ratios of
all the states show a significant decrease, which indicates a major slow down of
the spread of COVID-19. OH, IA, and NE no longer stand out while ND, along
with HI, are still pretty high.

test, not necessarily due to the emerging of symptoms but because, as many
states have reopened since the mid of May, people are required to take the
test to resume working or to be engaged in summer travels or activities. Also
as a lot more individuals are infected, all their close contacts are required to
take the test even though many are infected but not showing any symptoms.
Such cases could be huge due to the exponential social network effect [7]. The
percent of type II cases out of estimated total infected cases is estimated as
33.54%/(1+38.56%)=24.21%. This is comparable to or consistent with a number of recent studies, for example, over 10 studies considered in a meta-analysis
[6] report an asymptomatic rate in the range of 15%-40%. With the introduction of asymptomatic tests in a large number of schools, colleges and the general
public since the mid of summer, we expect that the type II ratio will further
decrease over time and so will the overall ratio of unreported cases.
Similarly, we also calculate the infection ratio and cumulative infected cases
for the 6 states NY, NJ, CT, MA, RI and LA up to Aug 31, 2020. The similar
trend for all other states pretty much continues except LA, which overtakes the
rest and become the highest among all these 6 states; indeed it becomes the
highest among all 50 states as well as of Aug 31, 2020, which is likely due to
the aggressive re-opening since the mid of May. The top 6 states with highest
estimated infection ratios are now LA (4.47%), FL (3.97%), MS (3.89%), AZ
(3.83%), AL (3.60%), and GA (3.52%), while the previous (as of Apr 20, 2020)
top 6 states have estimated infection ratio as follows: NY (3.14%), NJ (3.02%),
CT (2.09%), MA (2.58%), RI (2.92%) and LA (4.47%). Similarly, we also include the heatmap of infection ratios of all 50 US states as of Aug 31, 2020 in
Figure 10.
