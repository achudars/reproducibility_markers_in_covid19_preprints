ABSTRACT
Recent events leading to the worldwide pandemic of
COVID-19 have demonstrated the effective use of
genomic sequencing technologies to establish the
genetic sequence of this virus. In contrast, the COVID19 pandemic has demonstrated the absence of
computational approaches to understand the molecular
basis of this infection rapidly. Here we present an
integrated approach to the study of the nsp1 protein in
SARS-CoV-1, which plays an essential role in
maintaining the expression of viral proteins and further
disabling the host protein expression, also known as the
host shutoff mechanism. We present three independent
methods of evaluating two potential binding sites
speculated to participate in host shutoff by nsp1. We
have combined results from computed models of nsp1,
with deep mining of all existing protein structures
(using PDBMine), and binding site recognition (using
msTALI) to examine the two sites consisting of
residues 55-59 and 73-80. Based on our preliminary
results, we conclude that the residues 73-80 appear as
the regions that facilitate the critical initial steps in the
function of nsp1. Given the 90% sequence identity
between nsp1 from SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2,
we conjecture the same critical initiation step in the
function of COVID-19 nsp1.

1. Introduction
In light of the worldwide spread of the novel
coronavirus disease (COVID-19), our ability to harness
the technological advances acquired over the past 2-3
decades is being challenged. Encounter with COVID19 has demonstrated our ability to rapidly and costeffectively isolate the genome sequence of the new
emerging pathogen, such as SARS-CoV-2. However,
we have also encountered significant impediments in
the ability to translate this knowledge into a tangible
mechanism of combating new biological threats. New
technologies need to develop to convert the genomic
information into protein structure/function to eliminate
this translational operation gap.
During the CoVID-19 outbreak, much of the
attention has been focused on spike protein and its
binding to the lung cell receptor ACE-2,[1] while very
little is known about the way the novel coronavirus
(HCoV-19 or SARS-CoV-2) reprograms the normal
cellular function. SARS-CoV-2 shares a high degree of
homology to severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus (SARS-CoV) that precipitated an outbreak
in 2003, resulting in a 9.6% fatality.[2] The sequence
homology of two viruses allows us to compare the
structure and function of specific proteins by extending
our understanding of SARS-CoV to SARS-CoV-2.
SARS-CoV-2, a positive-strand RNA virus, produces
sixteen nonstructural proteins that facilitate viral
propagation. Out of these sixteen proteins,
nonstructural protein 1 (nsp1) suppresses the host's
immune response and also acts as the host shutoff
factor and dampens host gene expression. Nsp1

triggers selective decay of host messenger RNAs
(mRNA) by stalling ribosome assembly and cleaving
the host mRNA. The study of nsp1 offers a significant
challenge due to its unique sequence and disordered
structure, making it difficult to study its structurefunction relation by traditional methods.
The traditional characterization of protein
structures by NMR spectroscopy or X-ray
crystallography is too time-consuming and too
expensive. It does not apply to challenging proteins
such as intrinsically disordered proteins. The
computational modeling tools that have emerged in the
recent decade have continued to evolve with evaluation
in venues such as the Critical Assessment of
Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction (CASP)
competition. In this exploration, we propose to
combine several computational approaches and
integrate them with experimental validation to develop
rapid deciphering of the protein interactions of
COVID-19. More specifically, we aim to decrypt the
elusive function of the nsp1, a protein with an
intrinsically disordered region, in the family of
coronavirus by expanding our current knowledge from
SARS-CoV to SARS-CoV-2.

2. Background
The virus causing Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome (SARS) belongs to the coronavirus family.
SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is a zoonotic virus
that has crossed the species barrier from bats to humans
by an unknown mechanism. This virus emerged from
Guangdong, China, in 2002[3] and quickly spread
across the globe. The most recent outbreak of COVID19 emanated from Wuhan, China, and continues to
spread globally. The virus causing COVID-19, SARSCoV-2, shares a sequence homology of 79.5% with
SARS-CoV[4]; therefore, our investigations have a
direct impact on better understanding its functional
mechanism.
SARS-CoV contains a single-stranded RNA
genome that replicates in the cytoplasm of host
cells[3]. The replicated gene that includes two-thirds of
the genome encodes two large precursor polyproteins
that are cleaved into 16 nonstructural proteins (the nsp
family of proteins), among which nsp1 is the first to be

translated[4]. Nsp1 causes severe translational
shutdown of host proteins from host mRNAs, leads to
suppression of host gene expression. This 180-residue
protein consists of two unstructured domains and one
structurally well-defined domain. The two
unstructured domains of nsp1 consist of residues 1-12
and residues 126-180, while the structurally welldefined region consists of the interconnecting region
(residues 13-126). Residues 13-126 form a welldefined structure that has been previously studied by
NMR spectroscopy (see Figure 1)[5]. Residues 1-12
and 127-180 constitute poorly characterized regions,
difficult to be examined by traditional methods due to
their dynamic properties.
Laboratory-based mutation of this protein has
demonstrated both amplifying and attenuating
activities on its host shutdown properties.[6] Many of
these mutations are concentrated on the surface
residues of nsp1; therefore, the structural implication
of these mutations may provide a better understanding
of the protein’s ability to dampen host gene expression.
In this study, we have explored two potential regions
of interest shown in Table 1 that alter nsp1’s ability to
shut down host gene expression. To better understand
the structural basis of nsp1’s function, we integrate
advanced protein structure modeling I-TASSER[7],
multiple structure alignment technique msTALI[8-10],
and deep mining of the Protein DataBank using
PDBMine[11].

3. Materials and Methods
Our investigation of the structure-function
relationship of nsp1 is based on the mutations outlined
in Table 1. While the functional effects of these
genomic alterations have been investigated, their
corresponding structural effects are mostly unknown.
Therefore, we employed a protein structure modeling
technique to investigate these effects and close the
knowledge gap economically and efficiently. Our
overall approach consists of three independent
investigations of the functionally important regions of
nsp1. By combining the results of independent
approaches, a consensus of results is drawn to identify
the most likely region of its function. The details of our
approach are described in the following sections.
3.1.

using VMD[15] and NAMD[16] (Nanoscale
Molecular Dynamics). A solvation box was introduced
in the calculation of NAMD energies for each protein.
The solvent being water at a pH of 7.4. This approach
of including water in energy simulations produces a
more realistic physiological environment for the
protein and therefore produces more viable results. The
analysis protocol consists of subjecting the solvated
structural models of each mutant to 1,000 rounds of
molecular mechanics energy minimization, followed
by 100,000 rounds (0.1ns total simulation time) of
molecular dynamics simulation using NAMD [16].
The topological variation on nsp1’s surface
compared to its mutations was studied by measuring
the sidechain length of the substituted amino acids.
Then quantified the perturbation of the surface by
measuring the changes in the volumetric occupancy of
the mutated amino acid side chains. The distance used
in this calculation were measured between the
backbone Cα atom of mutation and the furthermost
atom in space and then compared to the respective
region in the wild-type nsp1 protein.

Computational Protein Modelling

Protein modeling software I-TASSER[7] was
utilized for the structural modeling of the mutations to
nsp1 to understand the mechanism of each mutation
better. I-TASSER was selected due to its continued
high performance during the CASP competitions[13].
As a preliminary step, we first evaluated the reliability
of I-TASSER[7] by comparing the modeled structure
of wild-type nsp1 to the experimentally characterized
structure of nsp1 in the Protein Data Bank[14] (PDBID: 2GDT[12] and 2HSX[12]). As a second step, we
used I-TASSER to generate the structure of reported
mutants of nsp1 in Table 1. These structures were then
used to perform correlative studies between the
observed structural changes and reported functional
changes. In particular, we examined the steric and
charge distribution of the examined mutations to
establish the structural basis of changes in function.

3.3.

Mining of PDB with PDBMine

PDBMine[11] is a recently introduced curation of
all protein structures from PDB[17] to facilitate
extensive mining of structural information. PDBMine
was created by dissecting and aggregating all existing
structural information such as sequences, backbone
dihedrals, water accessibility of each residue (to name
a few) of every characterized protein structure. Mining
of the PDBMine can quickly produce the conventional
Ramachandran plots[18], and more extensive
correlative knowledge, such as the relationship
between dihedrals between all sets of adjacent
residues. PDBMine has also facilitated the discovery
of absent k-mer sequences[19, 20] in the PDB.
In this study, we have utilized PDBMine to
discover any existing protein structures with similar kmer sequence to SARS-CoV nsp1 protein. More
specifically, 174 6-mers were created from the primary
sequence of nsp1 using a rolling window size of 6
residues (e.g., residues 1-6 in window 1, 2-7 in window
2, etc.). The same exercise was repeated with varying
window sizes 4-7, and the most informative window

sizes of 6 and 7 were analyzed. In theory, a smaller
window size will discover a larger number of proteins
with a less significant relationship. Therefore, results
obtained from the largest window sizes (6 and 7 in this
instance) have the most significance in structural
inference. It is important to note that a random
(unrelated) similarity of a 6 or 7-mer will appear only
once in 6.4e7 or 1.28e9, respectively. Thus, any
discovered similarity resulted from the search of only
140,000 proteins is of significant interest. The use of
PDBMine in this context allows the discovery of a
significant relationship between nsp1 and other
existing proteins to infer structural similarity. Such
structural similarities can be used to construct the
protein’s fragmented structure or assist in the discovery
of the binding sites[9].

of nsp1, CATH class diversity, and size diversity to
provide a diverse group of proteins. The alignment of
this collection of proteins should provide an
independent method of obtaining the conserved
binding site.

that were used with msTALI.

Binding Site Recognition with msTALI

Identification of the active site in proteins can be
an essential step in understanding the mechanism of its
function. Typical approaches to identification of an
active site are based on the docking of the protein with
its substrate. In this approach, the “fitness”
compatibility of the protein and its substrate is
evaluated based on known physical interactions such
as charge, shape, or hydrophobic/hydrophilic
compatibility between the suspected sites of a protein
and its known substrate. While such approaches are
complete, they impose a computationally demanding
task since they must explore all possible orientations
and conformations of the substrate. msTALI[10]
presents a new paradigm for identifying an active site
based on the evolutionary relationship between a group
of proteins with known similar substrate binding
properties. Under this paradigm, msTALI and its
predecessor TALI[21, 22] can identify the active site
based on structural and sequence homology of multiple
proteins. msTALI has demonstrated unparalleled
success in the identification of active sites such as
ATPase[9], P-loop folds of the G proteins, PYP-like in
Profilin-like folds, and FAD-linked reductases family
in FAD/NAD(P) folds.[8] In this investigation, a select
group of proteins (shown in Table 2) were subjected to
a study by msTALI. The selection of these proteins was
based on the relevance of their function to the binding

4. Results and Discussion
In the following sections, we provide the results of
our investigation to elucidate the functionally
important regions of nsp1 and to describe a
hypothesized mechanism of its function better. We
start our investigation through the most traditional
explanation of structure-function relationship and end
with
utilizing
contemporary
Bioinformatics
approaches. The conventional investigations consist of
exploring the destabilizing effects of the mutations by
observing potential energy, steric hindrance, and the
change in charge distribution of each mutation. Our
contemporary approaches leverage the current
information regarding other similar proteins to assist
with the discovery of the conserved and functionally
important regions while forming a more complete
mechanism of molecular interactions of nsp1.
4.1.

Predicted Structures

As a preliminary step, we first evaluated the
reliability of I-TASSER[7] by comparing the modeled

structure of wild-type nsp1 to the experimentally
characterized structure of nsp1 in the Protein Data
Bank[14] (PDB-ID: 2GDT[12]). A comparison of
these two structures (shown in Figure 2) yielded a
backbone structural difference (RMSD) of 1.95 Å,
which is within an acceptable range of less than 3Å.
Notably, the differences arise in the flexible loop
region.
As the next step, we investigated the possibility of
significant structural changes compared to the wildtype nsp1 due to the two sets of mutations mentioned
in Table 1. The computed structures of nsp1 with the
two different mutations from Table 1 are shown in
Figure 2. Compared to the computed structure of nsp1,
both structures exhibited structural similarity under
2Å, denoting no significant perturbation of structure
that could explain the disruption of its function. The
primary conclusion is to focus our investigation on
other explanations for the functional perturbation of
nsp1.

mapped on wild-type nsp1.

The mutation E55R, E57R, K58E, G59R is present
as clustered on the surface with an outward protrusion
on the surface of nsp1 (Figure 3). Upon mutation, the
overall change in amino acids from acidic (E: Glutamic
acid) to alkaline (R: Arginine) maintains the
hydrophilicity of the surface residues but exposes
positively charged alkaline amino acids on the surface.
Since nsp1 binds to mRNA and the ribosome, a
positively charged side chain may facilitate interaction
with the negatively charged backbone of RNA.

Effect of Charge Distribution

The charge interactions were studied at a neutral
pH value of 7.4 to understand the polarity and the
nature of change in the substitution of amino acids.
Both sets of mutations shown in Table 3 are present in
the surface-exposed region of nsp1 but are spatially
separated, presumably interacting with different sets of
host factors (Figures 3 and 4). In these figures, mutated
amino acids are color-coded: acidic amino acids in red,
alkaline amino acids in blue, and neutral amino acids
in yellow.

Figure 4. Charge interactions of R73E, D75R, L77A, S78E,
N80G mapped on wild-type nsp1.

The mutation R73E, D75R, L77A, S078E, N80G
is present around an extended loop on nsp1 protein
(Figure 4). In contrary to the 55-59 region, mutations
in 73-80 region changes amino acid residues to
primarily acidic residues.
NAMD energy calculations in the solvated state
(Table 3) show that the two mutations have resulted in
significantly different potential energies. Together,
these data suggest each set of surface residues function

independently to bind the host proteins and facilitate
host shutoff.

protein as well as the two mutants.

Effect of Surface Perturbation

The surface perturbation of the two mutant
structures was measured using the VMD software suite
(visualizations shown in Figure 5 and Figure 6). The
change in the sidechain occupancy of each amino acid
substitution then compared to the distances seen in the
wild-type protein. These results are summarized in
Table 4 and Table 5. Each column in these tables
represents a given amino acid substitution in the
mutant structures and shows the observed topological
changes when compared to the computed structure of
the wild-type nsp1. All the structural changes are due
to the extended sidechains of the substituted amino
acids that protrude into the water accessible region of
the protein. These perturbations of surface properties
can provide a steric-based mechanism of enhancing
nsp1’s binding or recognition function; therefore,
amplifying its host shutoff function.

For the nsp1 mutant E55R, E57R, K58E, G59R,
all the substitutions form charged hydrophilic nodes.
Arginine (R) substitution contributes to long-range
connectivity, hence increases bond lengths. These
long-range interactions may facilitate the cooperative
stabilization of the native conformation[23, 24], thus,
altering the binding properties of the binding site.

is a combination of hydrophilic (charged amino acids:

side chains. Three out of five mutations are
hydrophilic, and most mutations have a relatively small

type protein. They form short-range interactions

cooperative transition to interact with mRNA or

expression.

Predicted Binding Site by msTALI

The results of the structural alignment of the
thirteen proteins listed in Table 2 using msTALI are
shown in Figure 7. In this figure, a higher score implies
a higher significance of the conserved region. The
larger spikes shown in this figure clearly indicate four
significant regions that are shown in Table 6. There are
two particularly interesting observations. The first
clearly indicates the importance of the region 74-80,
which is one of the implicated functional regions of
nsp1. The second observation relates to the nearcomplete absence of any reported significance for the
region 55-60. In summary, in the context of structural
similarity to other proteins with relevant binding
properties, the region 74-80 is the more likely initial
binding site to the rRNA complex. Based on this result,
it can be hypothesized that the three critical and buried
conserved regions are the requisite structural
requirement to form the structure of this protein and
facilitate the docking process at residues 74-83.

relationship. Therefore, here we present the results for
a window size of 7, although a window size of 6 also
presented some interesting relationships. Table 7
summarizes the most notable regions for a PDBMine
search of a window size of 7. The first and second
columns of this table represent the region and the
corresponding sequence of nsp1, respectively, with
which other proteins shared identity. The last column
indicates the number of proteins that contained the
exact sequence listed in the second column. Although
not explored here, further analysis of these particular
proteins can provide critical information to provide
additional insight into the function of nsp1. For
instance, in our investigation, there is substantial
similarity between the findings of msTALI (in Table 6)
and PDBMine search including the highlighted region
of 70-76. Of additional interest, nsp1 exhibits a 7-mer
identity starting at residue 167 (SGALREL) with
proteins 5JHQ and 4YSB. This segment of a sequence
exhibits the conserved helical structure shown in
Figure 8. Based on our initial results, this helical region
may be the only structured region in the entire
unstructured region of nsp1 (residues 128-180) and
may play a significant role in further recognition of its
substrate.

5. Conclusion and Future Direction
The traditional study of structure-function relation
of nsp1 by investigating energetics suggests that these
two mutations function by distinctly different
mechanisms. The mutations in the 55-59 region
stabilize the protein, while the mutations in the 73-80
region destabilize the protein. Since flexibility is the
key feature of nsp1, each mutation can function
differently in the presence of host factors (RNA and
proteins).
While both mutations amplify the host shutoff
function of nsp1, mutations to positively charged
alkaline amino acids in the 55-59 region display an
increase of side chain length that may favor long-range
binding as well as interaction with nucleic acids. The
mutations in the 73-80 region do not change the charge
distribution or side chain length significantly but might
support binding host factors due to its inherent
flexibility.
The msTALI studies clearly identified the region
75-80 as the critical binding site in the context of the
ribosomal binding function, while excluding the region
55-60. Furthermore, the region 72-80 was the only
surface-exposed conserved region, which further
supports this region's binding propensity. Finally, three
other regions became identified as significantly
conserved across all thirteen proteins. To speculated
that these three buried regions indirectly support the
function of nsp1 by forming the hydrophobic core of
the nsp1, partial surface accessibility of some of these
regions may also assist the critical interactions with the
substrate of this protein.
The PDBMine search corroborated along with the
results of msTALI, moreover it provided additional
information that could pave the future of our
investigations. There are two important contributions
that require further investigation. The first relates to the
52 identified proteins that share the same 7-mer
(residues 70-76) as nsp1. Examining the regions
corresponding to this heptamer may provide additional
information regarding the functional importance of this
region starting at residue 70-76. The second area of
investigation will focus on the short but stable helix
(residues 167-173) identified in the unstructured region
of nsp1. This short helical region may be the critical

step in shaping the flexible region of nsp1 around the
bound substrate.
