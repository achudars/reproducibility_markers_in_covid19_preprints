Abstract
When the novel coronavirus disease SARS-CoV2 (COVID-19) was officially declared a
pandemic by the WHO in March 2020, the scientific community had already braced
up in the effort of making sense of the fast-growing wealth of data gathered by national authorities all over the world. However, despite the diversity of novel theoretical
approaches and the comprehensiveness of many widely established models, the official figures that recount the course of the outbreak still sketch a largely elusive and
intimidating picture. Here we show unambiguously that the dynamics of the COVID19 outbreak belongs to the simple universality class of the SIR model and extensions
thereof. Our analysis naturally leads us to establish that there exists a fundamental
limitation to any theoretical approach, namely the unpredictable non-stationarity of
the testing frames behind the reported figures. However, we show how such bias can
be quantified self-consistently and employed to mine useful and accurate information

1

from the data. In particular, we describe how the time evolution of the reporting rates
controls the occurrence of the apparent epidemic peak, which typically follows the true
one in countries that were not vigorous enough in their testing at the onset of the outbreak. The importance of testing early and resolutely appears as a natural corollary of
our analysis, as countries that tested massively at the start clearly had their true peak
earlier and less deaths overall.

Introduction
In December 2019 the novel coronavirus disease SARS-CoV2 (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan,
China. Despite the drastic containment measures implemented by the Chinese government,
the disease quickly spread all over the world, officially reaching pandemic level in March
2020. 1 From the beginning of the outbreak, the international community braced up in the
commendable effort to rationalise the massive load of data, 2,3 painstakingly collected by
local authorities throughout the world. However, epidemic spreading is a complex process,
whose details depend to a large extent on the behaviour of the virus 4,5 and of its current
principal vectors (we, the humans). Additionally, recorded data necessarily suffer from many
kinds of bias, so that much information is intrinsically missing in the data released officially.
For example, the total number of reported infected bears the imprint of the growing size of
the sampled population. This major source of non-stationarity should be properly gauged if
one aims at explaining the observed trends and elaborate forecasts for the epidemics evolution. Similarly, the time series of recovered individuals that are released officially are heavily
unreliable, due to the uneven ability of different countries to trace asymptomatic or mildly
symptomatic patients.
In this letter, we demonstrate that overlooking these effects inevitably leads to fundamentally wrong predictions, irrespective of whether mean-field, compartment-based models 6,7
or more sophisticate individual-based, stochastic spatial epidemic models 8,9 are employed.
More precisely, it is important to realise that the populations of infected reported by na2

tional agencies do not provide a reliable picture to correctly identify the epidemics peaks.
The primary cause resides in the marked non-stationary character of the testing activity.
However, while sources of bias due to differences in sampling and reporting policies among
different countries are generally acknowledged, notably by studies applying Bayesian inference 10,11 and causal models, 12 surprisingly the critical issue of non-stationarity appears to
have been significantly overlooked in the literature on COVID-19. Nonetheless, as we show
in the following, save few creditable exceptions, the reporting rate has generally increased
substantially as the outbreak was gathering momentum, along with the stepping up of the
number of tests conducted. Let us stress this point once more – any modelling efforts will
be pointless unless non-stationarity of reporting is properly accounted for.
While infected and recovered bear the marks of the convolution with unpredictably nonstationary reading frames, it can be argued that the time series of deceased individuals
provide a more reliable picture of the true, bias-free underlying dynamics of the disease. In
fact, while there might have been inaccuracies in attributing deaths to COVID-19, it can be
surmised that these should lead to systematic and reasonably stationary errors.
Contrary to intuition, and to an excellent degree of accuracy, a death-only analysis of the
data shows that COVID-19 outbreaks in all countries fall in the simple SIR universality class,
mean-field compartmental models originated by the the seminal 1927 paper by Kermack and
McKendrick. 13 Importantly, this fact can only be brought to the fore in the reduced space
of deaths and their time derivatives, as this allows one to filter out virtually all spurious
effects associated with non-stationary reading frames, which have been systematically underestimated in the vast majority of reports.
Taken together, our analysis suggests that simple mean-field models can be meaningfully
invoked to gather a quantitative and robust picture of the COVID-19 epidemic spreading.
Additionally, as a natural byproduct of our reasoning, we were able to calculate the timedependent reporting fractions for infected and recovered individuals. These provide a clear
a-posteriori reading frame for the relative position of the true epidemic peak and that ob-

served from the reported data, which is found to be typically shifted away artificially in the
future. Furthermore, casting the SIRD dynamics as a function of the deaths time series and
its derivative leads us to derive simple formulae that prove invaluable for real-time monitoring of the disease. As an important corollary of our analysis, doubts can be cast on all
procedures targeted at estimating the reproduction index of the epidemics based on the raw
time series of infected (and recovered), i.e. not corrected for non-stationary testing.

How to look at the reported figures
Within a simple mean-field compartmental model, people are divided into different species. 14
For example, in the susceptible (S), infected (I), recovered (R), dead (D) scheme (SIRD), 15
any individual in the fraction of the overall population that will eventually get sick belongs
to one of the aforementioned classes. The latter represent the different stages of the disease
and their size is used to model its time course. Let S0 = S(0) be the size of the initial pool of
susceptible individuals. Then the SIRD dynamics is governed by the following set of coupled
differential equations

where Ẋ stand for the time derivative of X = S, I, R, D. The parameter r represents the
infection rate, i.e. the probability per unit time that a susceptible individual contracts the
disease when she enters in contact with an infected person. The parameters a and d denote
the recovery and death rates, respectively. Note that, S(t) + I(t) + R(t) + D(t) = S0 + I0
is an invariant of the SIRD dynamics, i.e. it remains constant as time elapses

It is reasonable to assume that R(0) = 0 as this coronavirus has never been in contact with humans
before. Furthermore, S(0)  I(0) ' O(1), which justifies the way Eqs. (1) are written down (see also

one could attempt to calibrate model (1) against the available time series for the infected,
recovered and deaths, so as to determine the best-fit estimates of r, a, d and S0 . However,
it may be argued that this procedure amounts to over-fitting, due to the intrinsic high
correlation between r and S0 in the model. More commonly, a face-value figure for S0 is
assumed from the start, e.g. the size of a country or of some specific region. However, this
choice is somehow arbitrary, as the true basin of the epidemics can in principle be determined
meaningfully only a posteriori.
More importantly, as argued above, there is a more fundamental limitation to any attempt
of adjusting a model to the raw figures beyond specific, model-dependent issues. The cause
is the time-varying bias in the reported data. Essentially, this translates into an a-priori
unknown discrepancy between the true size of infected and recovered and the figures released
officially. The key observation at this point is that the time series of deaths, D(t), can be
regarded as the only data set that returns a faithful representation of the epidemics course.
More precisely, it appears reasonable to surmise that all unknown sources of errors on deaths
can be considered as roughly stationary over the time span considered.
It is well-known that the SIR dynamics can be recast in a particularly appealing form
in the space (Ṙ, R), R denoting in this case the overall class of recovered and deceased. 16,17
When one distinguishes between the two populations D and R (the recovered), as in the
SIRD dynamics (1), a similar manipulation leads to (see Methods)

def
Ḋ = f (D) = γ 1 − e−ξD − βD

(2)

where γ = dS0 , ξ = r/(dS0 ) and β = a + d. The differential equation (2) is equivalent to
the full set of equations (1) and the associated conservation law. Overall, it provides an
expedient and virtually bias-free means of testing whether the time evolution of an outbreak
is governed by a SIRD-like dynamics.
Fig. 1 shows very clearly that the COVID-19 outbreak falls in the SIRD universality

When analysed in this space, outbreaks in different countries are described by the same

class. The data reported by national authorities in different countries are plotted in the
plane (Ḋ,D) and compared with three-parameters fits performed with Eq. (2). The quality
of the fits appears remarkably good, irrespective of the country and the actual severity of
the epidemics in terms of deaths and deaths per day. Residual oscillations about the meanfield interpolating trends are visible, pointing to interesting next-to-leading order corrections,

which would deserve further attention.
It appears remarkable that a process that is inherently complex and unpredictably manyfaceted can be accurately described in terms of an effective, highly simplified mean-field
scheme, where many factors are deliberately omitted, such as space and different sorts of
population stratification. Of course, the effectiveness of SIR schemes and simple modifications thereof are well-known. 19,20 For example, a recent work shows that a modified SIR
model where the infection rate is let vary with time can be employed to infer change points
in the epidemic spread to gauge the effectiveness of specific confinement measures in Germany. 18 In an earlier work, two of the present authors had considered a similar approach to
elaborate predictions of the outbreak in Italy that proved fundamentally right when compared with the evolution observed afterwards. 14 What Fig. 1 critically adds to the picture
is a bias-free confirmation that simple mean-field schemes can be used meaningfully to draw
quantitative conclusions.
The best-fit values of the reproduction number R0 extracted from the above analysis
should be considered as effective estimates of the overall severity of the outbreak in different
countries. In particular, it can be argued that these should incorporate all sources of nonstationarity left besides the time-dependent bias associated with the evolution of the testing
rate. Most likely, these amount to different degrees of (time-dependent) reduction of the
infection rate r, following the containment measures. Interestingly, we find that, rather generally, the evolution of such non-stationary SIRD dynamics falls into the same universality
class in the plane (Ḋ, D) as signified by f (D), Eq. (2) (see also section 3 in the supplementary
material). More precisely, it turns out that a reduction of r by a factor f < 1 over a certain
time window simply corresponds to a proportional rescaling of the reproduction number to
a lower value, R0 → R0 f . A similar conclusion holds if the non-stationarity causes the
opposite effect, that is, f > 1. This might be the case, for example, of overlooked hotbeds or
large undetected gatherings that cause the infection to accelerate at a certain point in time.
Remarkably, whatever the direction, it can be proved that this rescaling is independent of

7

the typical time scale over which the transition r → f r unfolds, as well as the point in time
that marks its onset (see supplementary material).
An important corollary of our analysis is that the observed epidemic peak displayed by
the time series of the measured infected, IM (t), typically occurs later than the true peak,
the more so the more the testing rate is ramped up during the outbreak. The correct occurrence of the peak and a comprehensive understanding of how the testing activity controls the
apparent evolution of the epidemics can be obtained with the following simple argument.
In general, one can define two time-dependent reporting fractions, gauging the unknown
disparity between the true and the measured populations

αI (t) =

IM (t)
I(t)

αR (t) =

RM (t)
R(t)

(3)

where RM (t) refers to the reported population of recovered persons. Taking into account
the first definition in Eqs. (3), differentiation of the last equation in (1) with respect to time
gives
D̈(t) =

d ˙
d
IM (t) − 2 IM (t)α̇I (t)
αI (t)
αI (t)

(4)

The apparent epidemic peak occurs when I˙M (t) = 0, whereas we know from the fact that the
epidemics is governed by a SIRD-like dynamics that the true peak occurs when D̈ = 0, i.e.
when the number of deaths/day reaches a maximum. Thus, from Eq. (4) one immediately
sees that whether the apparent peak is observed before or after the true peak depends on
the sign of the rate of reporting, α̇I (t). More precisely, if the testing activity is steadily
ramping up (α̇I > 0), the true peak will occur earlier than the apparent one. This is because
the reported infected will have a maximum for D̈ < 0, i.e. past the maximum of the Ḋ.
Conversely, if the testing rate decreases, this will anticipate the apparent peak, giving the
false impression that the worst might be over while the true number of infected is in fact still
increasing. We find that this analysis applies to all countries considered in this paper (see
also supplementary material), whereby either the former or the latter scenarios are invariably

def
I0 (t) = ḊαI (0)/d, i.e. the infected that would have been reported if the reporting fraction
had remained constant at its initial value αI (0). Technically, δ = d/αI (0) is obtained as the
slope δ of a linear fit of Ḋ vs IM in the very early stage of the outbreak. The shaded regions
correspond to the least-square errors found on δ. As soon as the testing rate starts varying
appreciably, the two trends I0 (t) and IM (t) diverge. If the testing rate is ramped up, the
infected reported seem to flag an increase in the outbreak severity (Italy). Conversely, if
the testing rate slows down (Germany), the reported infected underestimate the true peak.
In particular, in this case the peak can be alarmingly anticipated. China shows a marginal
behaviour, where the two peaks coincide, consistently with a remarkably stable reporting
fraction of infected.
observed.
Fig. 2 illustrates the above considerations for the outbreak dynamics in three representative countries, each displaying one of the two characteristic behaviors. Technically, in order to
compute the reporting fractions αI , αR , one needs to know the mortality m = d/β = d/(a+d).
A good country-independent estimate for m has been reported recently by looking at the
infinite-number of test extrapolation, 21 which yields m = 0.012. Hence, combining Eqs. (1)

with the definitions (3), it is not difficult to obtain

αI (t) = mβ

Ḋ(t)

αR (t) =

(5)

where β is estimated from the fits of the SIRD model in the plane (Ḋ, D). Direct inspection
of Fig. 2 confirms the above reasoning on the relative position in time of the apparent and
true peaks. For example, it can be seen that tests have increased exponentially in Italy,
starting from the end of March, which caused the apparent peak to occur nearly a month
after the true one. Conversely, the testing activity has been vigorous in Germany at the
onset of the outbreak, but appears to have slowed down substantially as the epidemics
progressed. As a consequence, the apparent peak has been reported while the epidemics
was still growing. In both cases, our estimate is consistent with the fact that only 15 % of
infected persons are effectively reported. China seems to provide an instance of the marginal
case α̇I = 0. Despite an early ramping up, the reporting fraction of infected appears to be
remarkably stable, which is consistent with the co-occurence of the true and the apparent
peaks. According to the data, the testing activity has been resolute since the beginning (only
about half of the infected eluding tracing), and has culminated with a scenario compatible
with virtually all infected individuals being traced.
The calculations reported in Fig. 2 also confirm that counting instances of recovery is a
much subtler task. Typically, countries seem to have needed some adjustment time to set
up robust counting protocols, as it is apparent from the large fluctuations that are often
observed in the trends of αR at early times (see also supplementary material). Another
interesting feature that emerges clearly from the comparison of αI and αR is the average
recovery time, which can be inferred for example by direct inspection of the testing activity
in Italy. The curve αR (t) appears to be shifted in the future by about 10 days with respect to
αI (t), which is consistent with the present consensus estimate of an average time for recovery
of two weeks.

Figure 3: The true epidemic peak occurs within 30 days after the first ten deaths,
the earlier the higher the initial testing rate. When shifted so that they coincide at the
day where ten new deaths were first reported, the Ḋ time series reveal that the true epidemic
peak occurs inevitably rather early in the outbreak, visibly not later than one month after
the first ten casualties reported. Earlier vigorous testing is obviously key in containing the
outbreak (see also discussion in the text).
Our analysis shows how to pinpoint the true peak of the epidemics – the maximum of
the deaths/day time series, Ḋ. It is thus natural to investigate how the different true peaks
compare among different countries once these time series have been brought to a common
time origin. This is illustrated in Fig. 3 for a number of European countries. It can be clearly
appreciated that the apogee of the outbreak in different countries does not occur later than
about one month after the first ten deaths reported. It is interesting to observe that in
countries where the testing rate was vigorous at the onset of the outbreak (large hαI i0 ), e.g.
Austria, Switzerland, Belgium, Germany 2 , the peak seems to occur earlier with respect to
countries that have started ramping up their testing capacity later into the outbreak, such as
2

Netherlands seem to be a remarkable exception to this observation (see supplementary material).

11

Italy, Spain, France and U.K. (see supporting information). This might just have the obvious
explanation that early tracking of infected individuals enables more effective isolation from
the start, thus leading to a less severe evolution of the outbreak as there simply are less
contagious people able to propagate the disease. It is also interesting to observe that peak
position and height show some correlation with the initial reproduction numbers measured
in the (Ḋ, D) plane (see again Fig. 1 and Tables S1 and S2 in the supplementary material).
With some notable exceptions (again Netherlands and Denmark), countries that totalised
higher deaths/day at peak tend to be characterised by higher values of R0 . Overall, effective
and timely testing seems to have been the key to successful containment strategies, as it is by
now widely advocated, 22 as opposed to muscular lockdowns imposed later into the outbreak.

Summary and discussion
In summary, the observed behavior of the early 2020 COVID-19 outbreak has raised many
diverse and puzzling issues in different countries. Many of them have adopted drastic containment measures, which had some effect on the spread of the virus but also left large
sectors of the population world-wide grappling with the daunting perspective of pernicious
economic recessions. On their side, scientists from all disciplines are having a hard time identifying recurring patterns that may help design and tune more effective response strategies
for the next waves. In this letter we have shown that the spread of the epidemics caused by
this elusive 4 pathogen falls into the universality class of SIR models and extensions thereof.
Based on this fact, an important corollary of our analysis is that early testing is not only
key in making sense of the reported figures, but also in controlling the overall severity of the
outbreak in terms of casualties.
It is intrinsically difficult to disentangle the effects imposed by containment measures
from the natural habits of a given community in terms of social distancing. For example,
Italy is recording three times as many deaths per inhabitant than Switzerland as we write.

12

However, while it is true that Switzerland seemed to have tested nearly ten times as much
initially (see supplementary material), it is also true that that country has never been put in
full lockdown as it was decided in Italy. At the same time, Swiss people are known for their
law-abiding attitude and social habits that make (imposed or suggested) social distancing
certainly easier to maintain than in southern countries such as Italy.
The key message of this letter is that simple models should not be dismissed a priori
in favour of more complex and supposedly more accurate schemes, which unquestionably
go into more detail but at the same time rely necessarily on a large number of parameters
that it is hard to fix unambiguously. All in all, we can state with certainty that vigorous
early testing and accurate and transparent self-evaluation of the testing activity, assuredly
virtuous attitudes in general, should be considered all the more a priority in the fight against
COVID-19.

Taking into account that by definition I(t) = Ḋ/d, the conservation law, S(t) + I(t) + R(t) +

an expression which can be in principle employed to track the evolution in time of the
epidemics. Recall, however, that only IM (t) and RM (t) are accessible to direct measurements.
The associated reporting fractions are not known a priori and this may severely bias the
analysis if the reported figures are used in Eq. (M.10) or extensions thereof. To overcome
this limitation, it is expedient to combine the definition (M.8) with Eq. (M.2) to obtain a
closed expression for R that only depends on D, namely

R(D) = R0 e−ξD

(M.11)

Eq. (M.11) can be used to estimate the time evolution of the reproduction number without
the bias introduced by the non-stationarity of the reporting activity. In the supplementary
material, it is shown that the curve of the infected I peaks at D = γ log R0 /βR0 . Plugging
the latter expression into the right-hand side of Eq. (M.11) yields R(D) = 1, as it should
for consistency requirements.

Figure 4: Number of deaths at the true infection peak vs effective population size
estimated self-consistently (see Table 2). A direct proportionality is observed, in agreement
with relation (S.1). The vertical and horizontal bars denote the errors reported in Table 2,
calculated according to standard error propagation from the formulae used to compute the
two quantities. The orange dashed line is the arbitrary proportionality relation D = S0 /100,
drawn to provide an order of magnitude of the ratio between deaths at peak and effective
size of the infection basin.

Infection peak
In this section we derive some useful relations about key quantities at the infection peak,
namely the time t at which the number of infected persons, I(t), reaches its maximum value,
˙ = 0. From the fourth equation
I = I(t). This can be determined from the condition I(t)
of (1) in the main text, we get D̈(t) = 0, then using the definition of f (D) we can write

0 = D̈(t) = f 0 (D)Ḋ(t) ,

where D = D(t). Being D a monotonic increasing function we have, Ḋ(t) > 0 for all t, hence
the latter condition is equivalent to

0 = f 0 (D(t)) ,

where the 0 stand for the derivative of f with respect to the variable D. This equation can
be straightforwardly solved to give

D=

where R0 = r/(a + d) (see also Methods in the main text). We are now able to compute the
remaining key quantities at the peak time t. Indeed, the relations developed in the Methods

Let us observe that these quantities, as well as D, scale proportionally to the system size,
S0 , as one can appreciate from Fig. 4 where we report D as a function of S0 . The latter is
18

computed as S0 = γ/d (see main text). Here d = δαI (0), where δ is the slope of a linear fit
Ḋ vs IM at short times and γ is a parameter of the function f (D) obtained from a fit in the
plane (Ḋ, D) (see Fig. 1 in the main text).

Rescaled variables
In the main text we have shown (see Fig.1) that the epidemic spreading of the COVID-19
falls for a large number of countries in the SIR universality class, once read in the plane
(Ḋ, D). Indeed, all the data fit very well on the curve Ḋ = f (D), the latter depending on
three parameters. One can go one step forward and show that there is a particular choice
of rescaled variables such that all the curves Ḋ = f (D) collapse on a one-parameter family
of curves, indexed by the effective basic reproduction number, R0 . Let the define a new
variable x and a new time t0 by

x=

where we have used the relation R0 = ξγ/β. The universal function is unimodal, φ(0; R0 ) = 0
for all values of R0 and there is a single positive root, x̃(R0 ), which converges to 1 for
R0 → ∞. The function φ is linear for small values of x with slope R0 − 1, while at x̃(R0 )
one has
φ0 (x̃(R0 ); R0 ) = R0 [1 − x̃(R0 )] − 1

Figure 5: Universal behaviour of the COVID-19 outbreak in the rescaled plane
(x0 , x). Symbols stand for the data Ḋ, D rescaled according to the prescriptions (S.3)
and (S.2), respectively. The green and red shaded regions highlight the intervals 4 ≤ R0 ≤ 5
and 8.5 ≤ R0 ≤ 9.5, respectively. The thick green and red lines denote the data from the
outbreaks in China (R0 = 2.2 ± 0.2) and the United States (R0 = 20.0 ± 0.1), respectively.
It is easy to see that φ0 (x̃R0 ; R0 ) → −1 as R0 → ∞.
Fig. 5 reports the same data as plotted in Fig. 1 in the main text, but in the rescaled
plane (x0 , x). It is apparent that there exist two main clusters of outbreaks, one with values
of R0 between 4 and 5 and one with values of R0 between 8.5 and 9.5. The outbreak in
China is the only observed case where x̃(R0 ) < 1, due to the low value of R0 = 2.2 ± 0.2
computed from the fit.

20

Non-stationary reduction of the infection rate and the effective reproduction number
The reproduction numbers measured from the fits performed in the (Ḋ, D) plane should be
considered as effective values. These most likely incorporate all sources of non-stationarity
left besides the time-dependent bias associated with the evolution of the testing rate. In
particular, when imposed on the population, the effect of a lockdown is that of reducing over
a characteristic (possibly rather short) period of time the rate of infection r. The question
then arises whether the portrait in the (Ḋ, D) plane of a SIRD evolution where the rate of
infection r is a time-dependent function will still be described by the same universal function
f (D) but with an effective reproduction number Reff
0 . It turns out that the answer is in the
affirmative and the rationale for this is deceptively simple.
In order to explore this question, we consider a modified version of the SIRD model (Eqs.
(1) in the main text), where the infection rate r is let vary with time. 14 More precisely, if
some containment measures were enforced at time t∗ , causing their effect on a typical time
∆t, we may take
r(t) =




r

for t ≤ t∗

0

(S.5)



r0 (1 − f )e−(t−t∗ )/∆t + f r0

for t > t

∗

where r0 is the initial, pre-lockdown infection rate that defines the true initial reproduction
number, R0 = r0 /(a + d). The fraction f gauges the asymptotic reduction (if f < 1) of
the infection rate afforded by the containment measures. Of course, this kind of description
can be easily adapted to the case where the non-stationarity causes the opposite effect, that
is, f > 1. This might be the case, for example, of overlooked hotbeds or large undetected
gatherings that cause the infection to accelerate on average at a certain point in time.
Whatever the effect of the non-stationarity introduced by r(t), the effect in the rescaled
plane (x0 , x) turns out to be extremely simple and apparently robust with respect to the
choice of the characteristic time scales t∗ , ∆t and also of the specific functional form that

21

Figure 6: SIRD-like behaviour in the rescaled plane (x0 , x) is observed for nonstationary infection rate with an effective reproduction number. Starting from
a given set of parameters, r0 = 0.275 days−1 , a = 0.0309 days−1 , d = 0.00235 days−1 ,
corresponding to R0 = 8.24, we have generated different artificial SIRD dynamics starting
from the same initial conditions, S0 = 528747, I0 = 1 according to Eq. (S.5) with f ∈ [0.1, 3],
t∗ = 20 days and ∆t = 3.5 days. Each non-stationary SIRD dyamics has been fitted in the
eff
(x0 , x) plane with the function φ(x; Reff
0 ) = 1 − exp(−R0 x) − x (two instances are plotted
in the left panel). The effective reproduction numbers are plotted in the right panel against
the corresponding reduction of infection rate, f . These seem to be described by the same
universal linear reduction, Reff
0 (f ) = R0 f , irrespective of the characteristic time scales that
govern the non-stationarity and even of the specific function the drives the reduction from
r0 to f r0 < r0 (see text).
describes the reduction from r0 to f r0 . This is illustrated in Fig. 6 for a choice of f in the
interval [0.1, 3]. The evolution of outbreaks generated from a given root one, that is, one with
a given infection rate r(0) = r0 , can always be described by the same one-parameter function
eff
φ(x; Reff
0 ) with an effective reproduction number R0 that only depends on f . Moreover,

Reff
0 for f < 1 is simply the t = 0 value reduced by the same factor, that is
Reff
0 (f ) = R0 f

22

(S.6)

Remarkably, this conclusion, for f < 1, does not depend on the particular choice of the time
scale ∆t, nor on the onset time t∗ , nor on the particular choice for the function that describes
the fading of the infection rate. For example, a function of the kind 1/(1 + x) instead of an
exponential damping in Eq. (S.5) yields exactly the same result (S.6), that we might then
consider a general fact.
