Abstract
A simple analytical model for modeling the evolution of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic is presented. The model is based on the numerical solution of the widely used Susceptible-InfectiousRemoved (SIR) populations model for describing epidemics. We consider an expanded version of
the original Kermack-McKendrick model, which includes a decaying value of the parameter β (the
effective contact rate) due to externally imposed conditions, to which we refer as the forced-SIR
(FSIR) model. We introduce an approximate analytical solution to the differential equations that
represent the FSIR model which gives very reasonable fits to real data for a number of countries
over a period of 100 days (from the first onset of exponential increase, in China). The proposed
model contains 3 adjustable parameters which are obtained by fitting actual data (up to April 28,
2020). We analyze these results to infer the physical meaning of the parameters involved. We
use the model to make predictions about the total expected number of infections in each country
as well as the date when the number of infections will have reached 99% of this total. We also
compare key findings of the model with recently reported results on the high contagiousness and
rapid spread of the disease.

The recent pandemic due to the COVID-19 virus has created unprecedented turmoil and
changed the daily life of people over the entire planet. It has also yielded a grim toll of victims
that succumb to its attack. While there is great expertise in the medical community and
the community of statisticians in dealing with epidemics, less is known about this particular
disease to make reliable predictions for the evolution of the current pandemic.
In studying past epidemics, scientists have systematically applied “random mixing” models which assume that an infectious individual may spread the disease to any susceptible
member of the population, as originally considered by Kermack and McKendrick [1]. More
recent modeling approaches considered contact networks in which the epidemic spreads only
across the edges of a contact network within a population ([2] [3] [4]), Bayesian inference
models [5], models of spatial contacts in large-scale artificial cities [6], and computational
predictions of protein structures [7], to name just a few of the modeling efforts.
In the case of COVID-19, there is considerable uncertainty in the data collected about infected individuals due to the difficulty of testing large numbers of suspected cases. Although
a avalanche of research studies are currently investigating the COVID-19 epidemiological
characteristics ([8] [9] [10] [11] [12]), it appears that a simple model which can capture the
basic behavior of the pandemic phenomenon, in spite of the large uncertainty in the data,
can possibly offer useful guidance for its near-term and longer-term evolution. This paper
aims to provide such a simple model with very few adjustable parameters.

I.

THE MODEL
A.

Derivation of the model

The original mathematical description of the spread of an infectious disease in a population is the so-called SIR model, due to Kermack and McKendrick [1] which divides the
(fixed) population of N individuals into three groups:
• S(t) the number of individuals susceptible but not yet infected with the disease;
• I(t) the number of infected individuals;
• R(t) the number of individuals removed (recovered) from the infected group, either by
becoming healthy again with long-term immunity or by passing away.
2

The SIR model involves two positive parameters, β and γ which have the following
meaning:
- β describes the effective contact rate of the disease: an infected individual comes
into contact with β other individuals per unit time (the fraction that are susceptible to
contracting the disease is S/N );
- γ is the mean removal (recovery) rate, that is,

1
γ

is the mean period of time during which

an infected individual can pass it on before being removed from the group of the infected
individuals.

This model obeys the following differential equations:

Many recent studies have attempted to model the data of the COVID-19 pandemic by
imposing time-dependence conditions on the rates β and γ involved in the original SIR
model, in order to account for the imposition of social-distancing measures, quarantine of
infected individuals, and other interventions designed to slow down the spread of the disease.
Motivated by such considerations, we will introduce a variation of the original model in which
the parameter β is a time-dependent, monotonically decreasing function. This change can
drastically affect the evolution of the populations. We give below a specific example to
illustrate this point. Since the presence of time-dependence in β introduces a forcing term,
which for reasonable parameter values lowers the number of infected individuals (“flattens
the curve”).
The system of equations that describe the SIR, with or without the time-dependence in
the parameter β, can be easily solved numerically, as shown in Fig. 1, giving the three group
populations (S, I, R) as a function of time. Kermack and McKendrick pointed out the “it
is impossible from these equations to obtain I(t) as an explicit function of t” (p. 713, [1]),
but provided approximations valid under certain conditions. Here we aim to give a simple
approximate analytical solution inspired by the numerical solution.
We observe from the numerical solution shown of the SIR model, shown in Fig. 1,
that both the susceptible and the removed populations (S and R, respectively) behave like

I(t) (red points) and removed R(t) (green points) populations as functions of time t in days; the
corresponding colored lines give the approximate solutions obtained by the analytical expressions,
Eq. (3). Left: The SIR model, with parameter values β = 0.25 and γ = 1/10; the parameter β is

sigmoids, which is the typical behavior of solutions to differential equations that involve
exponential growth and decay. Moreover, the infected population is always given by the
following expression
I(t) = N − S(t) − R(t)

(2)

From these observations, we take the approximate solutions to be given by:
S̃ = N −

N0

(3a)

1 + e−α1 (t−t1 )
N0
R̃ =
1 + e−α2 (t−t2 )
I˜ = N − S̃(t) − R̃(t) =

(3b)
N0
1 + e−α1 (t−t1 )

−

N0
1 + e−α2 (t−t2 )

(3c)

where N 0 , α1 , α2 , t1 , t2 are treated as adjustable parameters, with t1 and t2 representing the
times at which the S̃ and R̃ populations reach their sigmoid midpoint values, respectively.
Interestingly, the analytical expressions introduced above fit even better the numerical solution of the model with a time-dependent β parameter. In Fig. 1 we give examples of
4

how well the approximate analytical expressions fit the “exact” numerical ones. In these
examples, for the model with time-dependent β we assumed β(t) = β0 exp(−t/λ), although
we emphasize that this assumption is for illustrative purposes only and does not affect the
general behavior of the model. Indeed, as we show below, β(t) has the behavior of a sigmoid.
For the SIR model in the example of Fig. 1, the fit to the analytical expression of Eq. (3)
has an RMSE value of 9.4 and the integral of the I(t) values differs from the exact result by
−9.5%. For the model with time-dependent β in the example we considered, the fit to the
analytical model of Eq. (3) has an RMSE value of 8.3 and the integral of I(t) differs from
the exact result by 0.3%.
Since the analytical model of Eq. (3) can capture the behavior of the SIR model including
a time-dependent β, which represent the “forcing” or “flattening” of the curve of infected
individuals, we refer to it as the “FSIR” model.

B.

Analysis of the model

Here we derive relations between the parameters used in the model of Eq. (3), and the
parameters of the original set of differential equations, Eq. (1). To keep the expressions
simple, we will assume α1 = α2 = α and define ∆t = t2 − t1 . By inserting the expressions
for S̃ and I˜ in Eq. (1b) we find:
α
β(t) = α∆t
e
−1



1 + e−α(t−t1 ) eα∆t
1 − n0 + e−α(t−t1 )


(4)

where we have defined n0 = N 0 /N . Similarly, by inserting the expressions for R̃ and I˜ in
Eq. (1c) we obtain:
α
γ(t) =
1 − e−α∆t



1 + e−α(t−t1 )
1 + e−α(t−t1 ) eα∆t


(5)

Thus, in the approximate model described by Eq. (3), the parameters β and γ of the original
SIR model become time-dependent, if we treat α as constant to be determined by fitting
the data (see next section). In the FSIR model the effect of interventions and measures can
be inferred from the values of the adjustable parameters t1 , ∆t and N 0 , as will be explained
in the next section, so that there is no need to impose specific time-dependent conditions
on the model parameters themselves.
The quantity n0 = N 0 /N we defined in the expression of β(t) is the fraction of the
original susceptible population that was infected, and thus does become part of the removed
5

population. There are two possible limiting values for this quantity: n0 → 1, the limit
in which the entire susceptible population was exposed and eventually becomes removed
population, and n0 → 0, the limit in which only a tiny fraction of the susceptible population
was exposed. In the first limit we obtain:
n0 → 1 ⇒ β1 (t) =


α
α(t−t1 )
α∆t

+
e
eα∆t − 1

(6)

while in the second limit we obtain:

n → 0 ⇒ β2 (t) = α∆t
e
−1
0



1 + e−α(t−t1 ) eα∆t
1 + e−α(t−t1 )


(7)

From the first expression we see that for t  t1 the value of β1 (t) increases exponentially,
which is an unphysical result. From the second expression, we see that β is a monotonically
decreasing function of time and for t  t1 tends to the constant value
lim β2 (t) = α/(eα∆t − 1),

tt1

which is the expected behavior in the FSIR model.
For t  t1 and assuming that α∆t > 1 we find that
β2 ≈ α

eα∆t
≈ α,
eα∆t − 1

which relates the adjustable parameter α of the analytical model to the value of the parameter β appearing in the original SIR model.
The quantity R0 = β/γ of the SIR model is used to estimate the value of the basic
reproduction number of an epidemic. From our analytical model, in the limit n0 → 0, the
quantity β/γ takes the form
−α∆t



β/γ = e

1 + e−α(t−t1 ) eα∆t
1 + e−α(t−t1 )

2
(8)

For t = 0, and assuming that αt1  1 (as is the case for the fits to reported data discussed
in the next section), this quantity becomes
t=0:

−α∆t



β/γ = e

1 + eαt1 eα∆t
1 + eαt1

For t  t2 , the quantity β/γ becomes
t  t2 :

β/γ ≈ e−α∆t .
6

2

≈ eα∆t .

The first number is very large for typical values of the parameters in the FSIR model obtained
from fits to reported data, while the second value is very small, close to zero. Neither result
is realistic. In the important range t1 < t < t2 , we find from numerical results that this
quantity is approximately described by a decaying exponential in time
t1 < t < t2 :

β/γ ∼ e−t/λ ,

with λ ≈ 1/2α. This result implies that in this range we would expect β ∼ e−αt (the
functional form we assumed for illustrative purposes in Fig. 1), and γ ∼ eαt . From this last
expression, taking the time average of γ in the range t1 < t < t2 = t1 + ∆t, which we call γ,
we find

t2 − t1

where we have used
γ2 ≈

from the expression of Eq. (5), a reasonable approximation for t & t2 . The last relation for
the average value of γ is obeyed to a good approximation for each case of reported data we
examined.
Using the preceding analysis that led to the relations β ≈ α for the initial value of β
and γ ∼ 1/∆t for the average value of γ, we suggest that a reasonable representation of the
quantity β/γ is given by the value of α∆t. Thus, we will use this value as a proxy for R0 ,
and will refer to it as R0 . The parameters estimated from the fit of our analytical model to
reported data give a value of R0 which is in agreement with the recently reported median
value of R0 for the pandemic.

II.

APPLICATION TO REPORTED DATA

We use our analytical FSIR model to fit the behavior of infected populations of different
countries, as obtained from [13], for a period ending on April 28, 2020 which corresponds
to approximately 100 days from the onset of the exponential growth of reported cases in
China.
In order to obtain a meaningful fit, we had to consider data for each country that show
a monotonic increase at the beginning. This means that a few data points in each case
were excluded, as they corresponded to sporadic reports of very few isolated cases, typically

FIG. 2:

The values of the parameters t1 and t2 = t1 + ∆t for 50 countries, obtained by fitting

the FSIR model with data up to 28 April 2020. The dashed lines give the average values of the
parameters, ht1 i (red) and ht2 i = ht1 i + h∆ti (blue) of the FSIR model defined by Eq. (3). The
countries with label are used to examine the behavior of the model in more detail.

1 to 10 in a given day, interspersed by several days of zero cases. In practice this means
that the fitting begins at a certain cutoff day denoted as t0 . In order to make the fit more
robust and simpler, we chose α1 = α2 = α. Moreover, we found by trial-and-error that
the value α = 0.25 is the optimal choice for all the countries we considered. This leaves
three adjustable parameters in the model that can be varied to obtain the best fit to the
data, namely t1 , t2 and N 0 ; instead of t1 and t2 , we elected to use instead as independent
parameters t1 and ∆t = t2 − t1 . The best fit here is defined in the Root-Mean-Square (RMS)
sense.
We were able to obtain reasonable fits for 50 countries from the entire database [13].
The resulting values for the parameters t1 , t2 , are shown in Fig. 2 (∆t = t2 − t1 is the
distance between each pair of values). The averages and standard deviations for this set are
ht1 i = 17.81 ± 6.58, h∆ti = 29.20 ± 9.16, giving ht2 i = ht1 i + h∆ti = 47.19. The values of the
parameters involved span a wide range. For other countries in the database, the data are
either too noisy or have not reached the point where the FSIR model can provide a good
fit: specifically, the model needs to include data up to the maximum of the curve, otherwise
8

it does not give meaningful values for the fitting parameters.
Instead of including all 50 countries in the following discussion, we have chosen to focus
on 10 countries that span the whole range of parameter values and could hopefully provide
some insight to the behavior of the pandemic. The choice of the 10 countries also aims to
represent parts of the world more heavily or less heavily impacted by the disease, as well as
more typical cases. Here we defined the impact as the total number NT of infected individuals
during the first wave of the pandemic, as predicted by the FSIR model; this number is scaled
by the population of the country, NP , in Fig. 3. In particular, we have included 3 countries
in which the impact was small, China, Greece and Australia for which (NT /NP ) < 500
infected per million, 3 countries in which the impact was moderate, Denmark, Germany
and France for which 1, 000 < (NT /NP ) < 2, 000 infected per million, and four countries
where the impact was large, Switzerland, Italy, USA and Spain for which (NT /NP ) > 3, 000
infected per million. The average value for t1 for this set of 10 countries is ht1 i = 20.04 and
for ∆t it is h∆ti = 27.31.

values for the expected total number of cases NT when the number of infections has dropped to

Qfit =

RMSE
N0

(9)

which is expressed as a percentage (multiplied by a factor of 100). The resulting values of
the parameters, including our choices of t0 , are given in Table I.
The values of the parameters obtained reveal interesting behavior.
• t0 : The value of this parameter is similar for all countries, except for China with
t0 = 17. This simply reflects the fact that the pandemic originated in China and then
spread through the rest of the world. The rest of the countries have starting dates of
10

the exponential increase within one week from the earliest, Italy (with t0 = 53) to the
latest, such as Greece and Denmark (with t0 = 65, and 75, respectively). The time
lag between most countries and China is approximately 6 weeks.
• t1 : This value indicates the position of the mid-point of the sigmoid representing the
behavior of the susceptible population, S. The shorter it is, the sooner the country
experiences the exponential increase in the infected cases, thus urgently necessitating
the introduction of health interventions and measures to limit the spread of the disease. The three countries with the shortest t1 values are Greece, Denmark and China;
unsurprisingly, these countries also have of the lowest number of cases per million, as
shown in Fig. 3.
• ∆t: This value indicates the lag between the sigmoid that describes the recovered
population (R̃) and the sigmoid of the susceptible population (S̃). As such, it can be
interpreted as the effective rate of removal (γ in the SIR model). In Table I we present
the values of ∆t for each country. The average of ∆t is close to 27.5 days (∼ 4 weeks),
a value consistent with a recently reported estimated median time of approximately
2 weeks from onset to clinical recovery for mild cases, and 3–6 weeks for patients
with severe or critical disease ([14], [15], [16]). Australia and China show an unusual
low value, ∆t= 5.7, and 11.1 days, respectively. The value of this parameter has a
significant effect on the total expected number of cases (see below).
• N 0 : the value of this parameter is representative of the number of daily cases near the
peak of the I˜ curve. It is close to reported values for this quantity for all the countries.
Interestingly, if we assume that the total number of susceptible individuals is close to
the population of each country, which in all cases is in the range of N ∼ 107 − 109 ,
then the ratio n0 = N 0 /N → 0, as we assumed for the FSIR model earlier.

In Table I we also include the values for the quality of the fit, which range from 6.6
(AUS) and 12.6 (USA) to 36.8 (Greece), representing a measure of the relative noise in the
data; the noise is largest for Greece because the numbers are rather small. We have also
considered fitting the FSIR model to seven-day running averages of the reported cases, and
this in general makes almost no difference to the value of the parameters or the quality of
11

the fit (see Fig. 4 for examples).
˜ we can extrapolate to long times and try to obtain
Using the analytic expression for I(t)
an estimate for the total value of cases over a long period, when the number of daily cases

of infection have essentially dropped to negligible levels (this corresponds to I(t)
call this asymptotic value NT and report it in Table I.
The average (over all countries in the set) of ∆t is 27.31 ± 11.35 (median of ∆t is 29.48),
the average of γ is 0.058 ± 0.042, and the average of 1/∆t is 0.052 ± 0.047, (all numbers
reported to 3 significant digits). It should be noted that the average of ∆t over the set of
the 50 countries mentioned earlier is 29.20 ± 9.16.
The FSIR-estimated average of ∆t = 27.31±11.35 yields an average reproduction number
of R0 ≈ 6.83 ± 2.84 (7.37, if we consider the median value of ∆t). Initial estimates of the
early dynamics in Wuhan, China, suggested a value for R0 in the range 2.2–2.7. For China,
the FSIR model estimates R0 = 2.77. However, the FSIR estimates for the rest of the
countries in the set, suggest much higher values of R0 . By conducting an elaborate analysis
of datasets and data sources, estimating distributions of epidemiological parameters, and
integrating uncertainties in parameters values, Sanche et al.[8] reported a median R0 = 5.7
(95% CI 3.8 – 8.9) for China. The FSIR estimated values of R0 for the countries we study
fall almost entirely within this range.
Fig. 5 depicts the FSIR-obtained values of γ, plotted in conjuction with the 1/∆t values,
for the 10 countries considered. For each country, the values are very close in magnitude,
as was explained in a previous section. It should be noted that γ is calculated as the time
average of the coefficient γ(t), as presented in Eq. (5), over the time period starting from t0
until the expected total number of infected people, NT , has reached 99% of its final value.
Fig. 5 also depicts the R0 values for each country (calculated as R0 ≈ α∆t, where α ≈ 0.25
and the value of each country’s ∆t is presented in Table I).
As measured by the estimate of the basic reproduction number R0 , Italy is the country
most adversely affected by the disease (R0 ≈ 10.69), followed by the USA (R0 ≈ 9.78),
Denmark (R0 ≈ 8.0), Greece (R0 ≈ 7.53), Germany (R0 ≈ 7.44), France (R0 ≈ 7.30),
and Spain (R0 ≈ 7.17). Greece, although it suffered relatively small number of cases,
has a large value for the basic reproduction number (R0 ≈ 7.53). USA, Spain, and Italy
suffer the highest numbers of expected total cases (NT ), whereas in the case of Greece the
expected total number of cases is one of the lowest in the set, presumably due to the fast
12

implementation of measures imposed by the government and followed by the citizens. It
should be noted that Greece has one of the smaller t1 values. Australia, with R0 ≈ 1.42, has
the lowest value of the basic reproduction number, making the pandemic in this country to
resemble the epidemiological characteristic of a seasonal flu.
It is interesting to speculate on the meaning of these results. NT , the total number of
reported infections, is an important quantity because the number of fatalities (case fatality)
is roughly proportional to this number, although the constant of proportionality varies in
each country, ranging from a high of about 0.15 for Belgium, 0.14 for France, 0.13 for Italy,
to a low of about 0.01 for Australia, and about 0.05 for Greece, China, and Denmark [17].
Fig. 6 presents the case fatality ratio and the deaths (COVID-related deaths) per 100K of
the population, for each country. The case fatality ratio represents the mortality per absolute
number of cases, that is, the total confirmed cases within a country. Greece, Denmark, and
China have low values of case fatality ratios and deaths per 100K of the population, and so
have Germany and USA. Australia has the lowest ratio. On the other hand, France, Italy,
and Spain have the highest ratios. In the scaled data, it is clear that Greece, China, and
Australia are atypical cases (”outliers”) as having very low number of scaled deaths, while
Spain, Italy, and France have the largest number of scaled deaths, in descending order; all
sets represent deaths per 100K of the population of the respective country. Apparently, a
low value of t1 tends to imply a low NT and a low case fatality ratio and deaths, as the
examples of China, Greece and Denmark demonstrate. In other words, early adoption of
measures to contain the spread of the disease pay off. On the other extreme, the countries
with high values of t1 tend to have high values of NT , especially Spain, which, along with
Italy and France have very high case fatality ratios and deaths.

FIG. 4:

Data for China (CHN), Greece (GRC), USA and Spain (ESP) and the United States of

America (USA). Red dots are the daily data reported in Ref. [13], the green lines are the fits by the
FSIR model. The blue dots are seven-day running averages and the blue dashed lines are the fits
by the FSIR model; in all cases the green and blue-dashed lines are essentially indistinguishable,
except for USA near the end of the examined period.

FIG. 5:

Left: γ and 1/∆t estimates for the 10 countries considered. The ”filled x” symbols

depict values of γ, which is calculated as the time-average of the coefficient γ(t) (Eq. (5), over the
time period starting from t0 until the expected total number of cases NT has reached 99% of its
final value. The filled circles depict values of 1/∆t. An explanation of the close proximity of the
values of γ and 1/∆t is presented in Section B (Analysis of the model). Right: FSIR-estimated
values for the reproduction number R0 for the 10 countries considered. The larger the value R0 ,
the more adversely affected by the disease the country is.

FIG. 6:

Left: Case fatality ratios as reported in [17] for 10 countries. Right: Deaths per 100K

inhabitants for each country; these values closely follow the trends of the expected total number
of infections scaled by the population, see Fig. 3.
