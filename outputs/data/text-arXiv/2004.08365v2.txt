We discovered that the time evolution of the inverse fractional daily growth of new infections,
N/∆ N , in the current outbreak of COVID-19 is accurately described by a universal function, namely
the two-parameter Gumbel cumulative function, in all countries that we have investigated. While
the two Gumbel parameters, as determined bit fits to the data, vary from country to country (and
even within different regions of the same country), reflecting the diversity and efficacy of the adopted
containment measures, the functional form of the evolution of ∆ N/N appears to be universal. The
result of the fit in a given region or country appears to be stable against variations of the selected
time interval. This makes it possible to robustly estimate the two parameters from the data even
over relatively small time periods. In turn, this allows one to predict with large advance and wellcontrolled confidence levels, the time of the peak in the daily new infections, its magnitude and
duration (hence the total infections), as well as the time when the daily new infections decrease to
a pre-set value (e.g. less than about 2 new infections per day per million people), which can be very
useful for planning the reopening of economic and social activities. We use this formalism to predict
and compare these key features of the evolution of the COVID-19 disease in a number of countries
and provide a quantitative assessment of the degree of success in in their efforts to countain the
outbreak.
I.

INTRODUCTION

In absence of containment measures, the early phase
of an pandemic outbreak, such as the current COVID19 (ref. [1–9]) is characterised by an exponential growth
with time of the number of infected people, N (t) ([28-33].
In this phase, the rate of new infections as a function of
time, Ṅ (t) = dN/dt, such as the number of daily new infected ∆ N (t), is exponential as well. If left unimpeded,
the epidemic naturally evolves and slows down, with N (t)
departing from the initial exponential growth and ∆ N
reaching a peak value before starting to decrease. This
happens when a sufficiently large fraction of the initial
population has become infected that the number of new
infections become progressively more inefficient and is
matched and eventually surpassed by the rate of deaths
and recovered individuals. Such an outcome, however,
is not acceptable in the case the current COVID-19 outbreak, since it would result in a very large loss of life.
Containment measures are necessary to limit the deaths
and avoid saturating health care capabilities, their merit
and efficiencies have been discussed in a number of recent studies as soon as the COVID-19 epidemics started
spreading (cfr. Refs. [1–9]). Given the relatively long
incubation period of the disease, from 2 up to 28 days,
and the fact that a large fraction of the infected population appears to be asymptomatic or hypo-symptomatic,
however, how can a government monitor the effectiveness

of the adopted containment measures and adjust them so
that the number of new infected reaches a peak as quickly
as possible? How can one predict when ∆ N will peak
and when its decrease will begin and reach a low, pre-set
value of production of new infected to be manageable?
A substantial effort is already ongoing to attempt modelling the number of various observables, including newly
infected individuals, deaths and recoveries, and using a
variety of methods from machine learning to the use of
standard SIR approaches (cfr. Refs. [10–18]). The goal
of this paper is to introduce and describe a simple phenomenological model that can be effectively used to predict the time of arrival of the peak, and its width, solely
based on the observed time evolution of the number of
known newly infected individuals ∆ N (t). The model is
interesting in practice because it is based on the data
themselves, without the need of any further assumption.
It is also conceptually attractive because, as we shall see,
the data show that, in presence of containment measures,
the functional dependence with time of the key observable ∆ N/N , the fractional number of daily new infected,
appears to be universal and characterized by only two
parameters, µ and a, as we will describe later. In other
words, the presence of containment measures changes the
growth of the epidemic from exponential into another
functional form, which is universal, independently of the
types and magnitude of the measures adopted by various
countries to oppose the spread of COVID-19. These measures determine the parameters of the functional form of
∆ N/N but not its general expression. In fact, even the
exponential function can be considered as a special case
of our general function, in the limit in which one of its
parameters (the evolutionary timescale) goes to infinite.

FIG. 1. Left: The double log of the ratio of total infected to newly infected is plotted as a function of time (black points).
The line is the best fitted Gumbel function, as defined in Section II. In the case of a pure exponential (N ∝ et/τ ), this ratio
is equivalent to the characteristic evolutionary timescale τ (if the growth from one day to the next were to be considered
exponential). The increase in the ratio, as shown in this plot, is thus a direct visualisation of the deceleration in the spread
of the disease. Red points shows the same quantities for deaths, delayed by 4 days: it can be seen that deaths follow the
same evolutionary rate with typical delays that were of 6-7 days at early times and get to 3-4 days more recently, due to the
increasing number of recovered patients (deaths are a more accurate delayed function of Nactive , but exploring this is beyond
the scope of this work). Right: We show daily values of ∆N for infected (black) and deaths (red, delayed as in the left panel).
The solid curves correspond to the Gumbel best fitting function from the left panel (delayed for deaths and scaled down by
the integrated CFR); dotted line shows the extrapolation of the same function; dashed lines show the 1σ range around the
forecasted trend. The red long-dashed line shows the extrapolation of the sum of deaths and recovered: when this long-dashed
line rises above the dotted black line, ∆Nactive becomes negative and Nactive thus starts decreasing, hence corresponding to the
peak of Nactive . Throughout this work we refer instead to the peak of ∆N , as shown in this figure. The horizontal line shows
the level of 2/day/1M new infected, that we set as the floor to a regime where the outbreak can be controlled as seen in South
Korea.

This work is organized as follow: in Section II we introduce the mathematical framework and fitting methods.
In Section III we describe the meaning of the Gumbel
parameters and some of its properties. We further verify
the forecasting capability of the method in Section IV. In
Section V we evaluate quantitatively the performances in
countering the outbreak by various countries. We discuss
our results in Section VI and conclude in VII.
II.

MATHEMATICAL FRAMEWORK

Let’s call N (t) the total number of known infected people at a given time t. We define:
dN = rN dt

(1)

where r, which we call ”the reproductive rate per unit
time”, at any given time, is related to the R0 parameter (generally introduced in so-called SIR models) by the
relation r = (R0 − 1) γ (where γ in SIR models is the inverse of the average duration of the infectious period). In

an unchecked epidemic outbreak, r and R0 are constant
and the outbreak grows exponentially until a significant
fraction of the population has been infected. If containment measures are present, however, r is not a constant
even in the early phases but is a a function of time as a
result of the measures put in place to slow and halt the
outbreak.
Empirical analysis of the best studied case of the time
evolution of r in the COVID-19 outbreak, for example in
Italy, Spain, South Korea and the US, shows that a rather
accurate description of the observed data is provided by
the Gumbel (1935; [19]) cumulative distribution function:
(t−µ)/a

dN/dt/N = r = e−e

(2)

as Figure 1 and 2 illustrate (note that this actually is a
reflected Gumbel, given that a is positive). This function, which is specified by only 2 parameters that are
determined by fits to the data, provides an excellent representation of the observations in all cases that we have
considered, namely countries where the type, implementation and timing of the preventive measures are rather

different. As the case of Italy shows, the Gumbel function provides an excellent representation of the data for
the country as a whole, and also for the data of individual
regions of Italy as well (cfr. Figure 1 and Figure 3). Since
the fractional rate of new infected individuals is modeled
as a double exponential, the implication is that r has its

own ”reproductive rate per unit time” which is itself a
function of time and decays exponentially, following the
equation:

dr = −re(t−µ)/a dt.

(3)

4
Fig. 1-left shows the Gumbel fit for Italy over the last
45 days (here and in the following we are using dt = 1
day). We have collected data from Worldometer [21] and
official Github repositories [22; 23], and included them in
our analysis as they reached a daily production of new
infected close to the 1–2/day/M in each country.
To determine the parameters of the Gumbel function
we perform a least-square fit of a linear function to the
logarithm of the logarithm of N/∆N with no weights,
thus equally counting each data point, regardless of the
Poisson errors, since it can be readily seen from the figure
that the scatter of the points around the best-fit function is fairly constant in double-log space as a function
of time (except perhaps very early phases that appear to
be noisier). This suggests that the uncertainty of each
measurement is likely dominated by fluctuations in the
reporting and sampling systems rather then by counting (Poisson) errors, and therefore it must be related to
the effectiveness and of the testing and reporting capabilities of each countries, as discussed later. We tried
different approaches such as fitting the cumulative Gumbel function to the N time series, and the differential
Gumbel function to the ∆N time series, but none provided as good a fit as with the one we found with our
approach. This conclusion, we believe, is already apparent in the N/∆N time series plots in Figures 1–3, where
there is no hint that the functional form of the double
log of these series ever significantly departs from a linear relation. We notice that a recent study (Bianconi et
al 2020; [20]) discuss modeling of the doubling time of
newly infected patients as a function of time, which is
equivalent to the quantity r in our study (it’s inverse).
They argue that two asymptotic behaviours are present
at early and late phase of the outbreak with different
slopes in log space. When using a Gumbel function the
need for ad-hoc change of slopes is removed, and the data
evolution remain linear in double-log space.
III.

THE MEANING AND DETERMINATION
OF GUMBEL PARAMETERS

Once the best-fit parameters µ and a have been determined from the data by a fitting procedure, the Gumbel function provides an excellent description of the past
time evolution of the COVID-19 disease and allows us to
make predictions of the future evolution of the outbreak,
including the peak in the number of new infections, as
it is illustrated for the predicted evolution of ∆ N with
time in the case of Italy (Fig. 1-right). The parameter a,
which has the physical dimension of time (we have chosen
here the day as unit), sets the overall shape of the function, including the width of the peak where a larger value
of a implies a longer turnaround time for the outbreak.
In particular, we find that the FWHM (Full Width at
Half Maximum) of the peak can be approximated as
FWHMPeak ∼ 0.63 × a + 4.3.

(4)

The parameter µ sets the timescale of the outbreak
and thus allows one to predict the time (day) of the peak
in ∆N (tpeak , as we shall see below). Finally, there also
is an overall normalization coefficient that can be set to
reproduce the total number of infected people at the time
of the peak, N (tpeak ). Notice that the time of the peak
can be derived from the equation ex + x = ln(a), where
x = (tpeak − µ)/a, which has the solution
tpeak = µ + a(ln(a) − W (a))

(5)

where W is the Lambert function. In Table I we report
tpeak , instead of µ, since they are effectively equivalent
parameters but the former has more immediate utility
than the latter. Also notice that Eq. 2 cannot be analytically inverted to solve for dN/dt and N , and thus we
have proceeded to numerically inverting it, integrating
over the natural reporting timescale ∆t = 1 day.
It’s interesting to emphasize that in the limit of a
purely exponential growth, N/∆N = τ is constant, corresponding to a Gumbel function with a that tends to ∞
and with exp(exp(−aµ))= τ . The exponential growth is
thus a special case in the Gumbel growth we are describing, with infinite timescale a.
IV.

VERIFYING THE ACCURACY OF THE
MODEL’S PREDICTIONS

If the future evolution continues along the same trend
of the best-fit function, i.e. with the same functional form
and identical parameters, as the data suggest, the Gumbel function can be used to predict the near future evolution of the outbreak, including providing an estimate
of the uncertainty. Such a prediction is shown for the
Italian data in Fig. 1-right. Similar predictions for South
Korea, Spain, France and the US are also shown in Fig. 2.
At the time of this writing, Italy, Spain, France and the
US are the countries with the largest number of reported
cases. As the plots show (data updated as of April 13),
according to our analysis, all of them have already (cumulatively, not necessarily on a region-by-region case)
passed the peak of the daily new infected (∆ N ). South
Korea has actually reached a steady state of daily new
infection with ∆ N ≈ 50–100 (not included in the plots
shown; see worldometer), thus demonstrating that such a
low level can be kept constant over several weeks at least,
preventing further exponential diffusion of the infection.
The excellent fit provided by the Gumbel function to
the time dependence of ∆ N/N , with constant parameters a and µ over a large time interval (Eqs. 2), as shown
in left panels of Figures 1–3, suggests that, with adequate sampling, the same best fitting parameters could
have been determined significantly earlier on during the
diffusion of the COVID-19 infection in each country. If
that could indeed be made possible one would have been
able to predict key properties of the evolution of the outbreak, such as the timing of the peak in ∆ N and its

FIG. 4. Top panels: Forecasting the peak in ∆N as a function of time for different countries, as labeled. Solid line shows best
prediction and dotted line its 1σ range, at each day. For Italy the peak forecast was accurate within 5 days, 20 days in advance
of the peak, and about 10 days for the US and Spain. The peak was predicted only a few days in advance for South Korea,
that reached the peak very rapidly. Bottom panels: Forecasting when various countries (as labeled) will reach a production
rate of new infected per day (∆N ) at the level of 2 per milion abitant, post peak. Lines are as in the top panels. For Italy
accurate prediction of that regime is obtained with 30 days of advance, about 10-15 days for the US and Spain and 13 days for
South Korea. We emphasize that as of the time of writing only South Korea has actually reached this level, and was able to
maintain it for at least one month.

width, the point in time when ∆ N reaches a pre-set value
determined to allow a country to maintain a manageable
steady state control of the disease, for example similar to
what achieved by South Korea.
To further investigate the feasibility of such predictions
in the countries considered here, we have performed the
following simulation: we have fit the time series of ∆ N/N
only up to a given day in the past, ignoring the additional
data points after that, and compared the prediction obtained in this way with the one obtained using the full
data set available at this time, including a detailed analysis of the relative uncertainties. Fig. 4 top-panels shows
the results of this simulation to illustrate the ability of
our methodology to predict the peak in ∆N . The graphs
clearly show that the peak could have been predicted as
much ahead in time as about 3 weeks for Italy and 12 weeks for the other countries. For most values of the
time lapse that we have considered, a reasonable 1σ uncertainty for the peak is also predicted, which in fact
brackets the true date of the peak. For Italy and South
Korea a small underestimate of the peak time is observed
using the earliest data points. We also observe a similar
behaviour in other countries that we have inspected, a
fact that we interprete as due to the progressive settling
of the reporting mechanisms and procedures for testing
adopted by the various governments rather than a short-

coming of our model.
The bottom panels of Fig.4 show the prediction of the
time, after the peak, when the epidemic outbreak can be
considered to be under control: in South Korea that time
was when it reached ∆ N ∼ 100 per day, a level that has
been so far maintained for about 1 month without the
occurrence of a second outbreak wave. This corresponds
to approximately 2 new infected per day per million people. Using our model, such crucial moment in time can
be predicted with large anticipation, up to about 35 days
in the case of the Italian data. Of course, this assumes
that the evolution continues with the same Gumbel parameters down to this floor: so far, only in the case of
South Korea such a level has been convincingly reached.

QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT OF
COUNTRIES PERFORMANCES IN
COUNTERING COVID-19

Our quantitative analysis of the evolution of the
COVID-19 in various countries allows us to measure their
efficiency in countering the virus spread from various parameters. This is based for simplicity in the countries
with the largest number of cases, as a reference. We

A.

Rapidity in halting and suppressing the
infection spread

The parameter a, the slope of the double log of ∆N/N ,
is the most important parameter because it sets the du-

ration of the outbreak: the Duration of the ∆N curve
defined as the number of days during which more than
2/day/M new infected are produced. We find that this
Duration can be estimated as 1.75 × a (Table I).
Figure 5 compares the performance of various countries
in containing the disease: in Spain, the US and Austria
the virus countering measures seem to be more effective
than Italy and Germany, since the former countries have
shorter outbreaks and more the reproduction rate of the
virus declines faster. By far, South Korea has been overperforming all other countries in terms for its rapidity in
suppressing the outbreak.

B.

Timeliness of the response

The total number of people infected in a country
(NTotal ), depends on the rapidity in containing the spread
of the virus (larger a brings more total infections) but
also on how early measures are taken, i.e. the rapidity
in changing the behaviour of N/∆ N from almost constant (exponential growth) into a Gumbel-like deceleration. The following formulation is a very good description

7

FIG. 5. We compare performances in countering the break
from various countries. The x-axis shows the duration of the
outbreak, defined as the time during which the number of
new infected (∆N ) was higher than about 2/day/M. The yaxis shows the total (at the end of the wave, not just until
observed) number of known infected people in the outbreak.
Among this four, Italy and France have been the poorest performers in terms of speed in countering the outbreak, probably evidence of lower efficiency in the countermeasures. Spain
reached the highest number of infected people per 1M population, suggesting they started countering the virus late. South
Korea did outperform the other countries by over one order
of magnitude in terms of number of infected per million, and
by a factor of 3-4 in terms of duration.

of our data: NTotal = ∆NPeak × (0.66a + 4.8). However,
∆NPeak grows linearly with a at fixed normalization, implying that NTotal goes like a2 . However, also the normalization increases NTotal linearly. Fig. 5 shows that
at fixed outbreak duration, Spain is producing twice the
number of infected people per million than Austria and
the US: we suggest that the worse performance is due to
the longer delay before substantial containment measures
have been adopted. Similarly, Italy and France appear
to have responded later than Germany.

FIG. 6. Bottom: Correlation of infected to total test ratios
versus total number of infected per milion in selected countries (from left to right points are from South Korea, Austria,
Germany, US, Spain, Lombardia and France – we use Lombardia in representation of Italy as it carries the vast majority

trated by time series of deaths D/∆ D that appears to be
roughly constant with time and impossible to correlate
with the corresponding data for the infections, after accounting for an appropriate delay time. Hence we set the
delay to zero for display purposes in Fig.3, but estimate
the delay to be actually quite long, as demonstrated that
deaths are still counted in significant numbers to today
(see worldometers).

Relation to testing rates

Reliability in reporting

The rms scatter of the residual from the Gumbel fit
to the N/∆ N N time series, and/or the Pearson correlation coefficient, can be related to the day-to-day consistency and reliability in reporting data (Table I). The best
performing countries appear to be Italy and the United
States, while France appears to be the least well performing. South Korea also did not appear to provide very
careful day-to-day reporting, which is also very well illus-

Different values of the ratio of infected to total tests are
observed, too. When a large fraction of tested patients
is found to be positive for the COVID-19 infection, one
can argue not only that a substantial fraction of infected
people are not censed, but also that in general the quality of the virus countering efforts are inadequate. This
is illustrated by Figure 6, where we show the correlation
(Pearson correlation coefficient 0.94) between the number of infections per million versus the fraction of posi-

FIG. 7. Correlation of infected to total test ratios versus the
integrated CFR (bottom) and the delay between infected and
deaths (top), for the same countries as in Fig. 6. The delay

in the µ parameters from the Gumbel fit.

than the naive estimates of < 0.3% from the reported
infections.
This might still largely underestimate the actual number of infections in a country: when a substantial fraction of COVID-19 patients remain untested, it is reasonable to believe that also deaths are undercounted as
well. Estimates based on registries of deaths in various
municipalities in Italy have shown [24; 25; 26] that this
deaths under-reporting factor can reach up to 4–6×. We
make the ad-hoc assumption that this further correction
scales with the fraction of positive tests in exactly the
same way as for the previous one (ratio of observed CFR
to an intrinsic CFR of 2%). We are of course aware
that this calculation is affected by uncertainty and a reliable assessment will require a widespread program of
population testing to search for the prevalence of antibody to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. It is interesting that
the numbers suggest that up to 15-20% of the population will infected (by the end of current outbreak waves)
in Spain, Italy and France, a level not too far from the
herd immunity (the numbers are much lower in other
countries). This implies that containment in these three
countries has been the least efficient. It is intriguing that
in the Diamond Princess ship, despite the very confined
environment, which favored close contacts with infected
passengers, only about 20% of the passenger eventually
tested positive, a fractions similar to the one inferred for
Italy, Spain and France.

tive tests. Similar levels of correlation are also observed
with the parameter a (not surprisingly, given Fig. 5) and,
more interestingly, with the integrated case fatality rate
(CFR), see Fig. 7-bottom. We derive the CFR in each
country in which the outbreak is still actively occurring
by taking into account the delay between the fractional
growth rate of infected and deaths. In fact, an excellent correlation is observed for CFR with this time delay
between N ∆N of infected and D/∆D of deaths (Fig. 7top). This is obvious when considering that larger testing
rates will discover larger numbers of less severely infected
patients on average, and with the COVID-19 disease at
an earlier stage.
Assuming that the intrinsic fatality of the virus is the
same in all countries, Fig. 7 suggests that we can correct
for the unaccounted infections by normalizing each country to the same CFR of 2% as observed in South Korea,
and consistent to what seen in the Diamond Princess ship
outbreak (Russell et al 2020; [27]), where everyone of the
3711 passengers were tested. Using this procedure, we
derive the numbers listed in Table II (see CFR-corrected
column). This suggests that when the current outbreak
waves have subsided, up to about 1-2% of the population
of several countries will have been infected, quite larger

DISCUSSION

A Universal description of outbreaks evolution

A significant finding of this study is that, in presence of
containment measures, the evolution with time of ∆N/N ,
the fractional rate of new infections in an epidemic outbreak, is remarkably well modeled by the Gumbel function, i.e it has a universal shape regardless of the type of
adopted measures. In other words, while the Gumbel parameters a and µ (i.e., tPeak ) vary from country to country, and from region to region within the same country
(e.g. Italy), reflecting the diversity and degree of effectiveness of the adopted containment measures, the time
evolution of new infections, which would be exponential
in absence of any measure, always converges to the same
functional relationship, i.e. the Gumbel function.
It is fundamental to notice that, as a result of the often
highly inadequate and biased testing procedure adopted
by each country, we do not actually have either complete or unbiassed measures of the true number of infected people (very often only people with severe symptoms of the COVID-19 disease get tested for the virus,
which bias the sample towards individual who most susceptible to the disease, and only relatively small numbers of tests are conducted). These systematic effects
combine with the varying effectiveness of the containment measures adopted by the specific country (degree

9
of enforcement of social distancing, number and types of
allowed essential activities, availability of protective devices) to produce the ”effective” metrics that are used
in studies such as ours (in this case the variable N (t)).
The fact that these ”effective metrics” all obey the same
functional relationship in such different societies as South
Korea, Spain, Italy and the US, strongly suggests that
this functional relationship is relatively insensitive to all
systematics combined together. These systematics seem
to always affect available metrics of the spread of the epidemic in the same way. This is most likely the result of
using the ratio of the rate of increase ∆ N to N itsef:
even if N is affected by a bias, which we can think of as
a multiplicative factor, since the variable of relevance is
actually r = ∆ N/N , to first order the bias is largely eliminated in the ratio. To us, this seems a non-trivial result,
reminiscent of a situation where the combined effect of
a large number of independent causes result in the welldefined, universal final behavior of a random variate (e.g.
normal distribution and the Central Limit Theorem). In
this case, dr/r, namely the daily fractional change of r,
which is the same as dR0 /R0 , diverges exponentially with
time towards more and more negative values (Eq. 3).
B.

Relation to the standard SIR model

It is instructive to compare our model to the standard
SIR model which is commonly used to describe epidemic
outbreaks ([28-33]). In the SIR model a total population
T of individuals experience an infectious epidemic is divided into S, I and R groups, namely are the numbers
of susceptible, infected and recovered (or killed by the
disease) individuals (notice that we have adopted the notation N instead of I, that we keep in the following for
clarity), where T = S + N + R (all normalized to the
total number of individuals to that T so that T = 1).
The rates at which people are infected is regulated by
the constants β and γ, such that dS/dt = −β S N ,
dN/dt = β S N − γ N and dR/dt = γ N . In this model,
which provides a description of an outbreak in absence of
any measure aimed at slowing and reversing the spread of
the disease, the quantities γ and β are constant in time.
The parameter R0 = β/γ ([34]), usually called ”the reproduction number”, which measures the average number of secondary infected individual created by 1 primary
infected primary, is often used as a metric of the effective
power of the contagion in the outbreak. The early phase
is characterized by I = Ii ≪ 1 and Si = 1 − I≈ 1 and thus
N (t) = Ni e(R0 −1) γ t .

(6)

If R0 > 1 one has an epidemic outbreak. If left
unchecked, the epidemic will continue until S substantially decreases and N and ∆ N eventually deviates from
the exponential growth and ∆ N , in particular, reaches a
peak: as a result of the decreased efficiency of new infections and the decrease of N (t) as a result of people who

recover or die. Letting an epidemic evolve in this way
would result in unacceptable loss of life and containment
measures must be set in place to break the exponential
growth during the early phases. Such containment measures basically aim at breaking the exponential growth
during the early phase by making R0 (r in our model)
become a function of time and bring it to R0 ≤ 1. It
is important to realize that the peak that an unchecked
epidemic would reach is qualitatively different from the
peak that happens as a result of containment measures.
The former basically happens because the population becomes depleted of Susceptible individuals; the latter is
the direct result of the containment, which continuously
shorten R0 , or r, which in effect is the inverse of the continuously increasing τ time-scale factor of the exponential
growth (there is no exponential growth in an unchecked
epidemic approaching the peak).
In the previous section we have suggested that, even if
the available diagnostics of an epidemic are biased (e.g.
the available number of infected individuals is both an
incomplete and biased estimator of the true value), a fortuitous property of how all the biases combine together
makes the time evolution of the resulting ”observed fractional growth rate”, ∆ N/N , a universal function of time.
In addition, the fact of using the ratio of the first derivative of a variable to the variable itself greatly diminishes
the effect of any systematic bias. This universal function
of time turns out to be very useful to predict both the
time occurrence of the peak, its width and the time when
the infection is basically under control. That said, it is
nonetheless of considerable interest to estimate the total
number of infections at a given time during the outbreak
(as we have attempted in Section V D), since this can be
used to inform the testing strategy, optimize the containment measures, as well as to obtain a fair estimate the
CFR of the disease, both cumulative and as a function
of the age of the patients, useful to inform the clinical
response.

VII.

CONCLUSIONS

There are two main conclusions from this work, a conceptual one and a practical one. The conceptual one is
that during the exponential phase of a pandemic outbreak and in presence of containment measures, the time
evolution of the fractional growth rate of new infections,
∆ N/N , follows a universal functional form, which is very
well modeled with the two-parameter Gumbel function.
Fits to the data show that the two Gumbel parameters
vary from country to country (and even from region to
region within the same country), reflecting the specifics
of the adopted containment measures. Remarkably, however, the functional form, remains the same. Since in absence of the containment measures, the evolution of the
pandemic at this stage would still be in the exponential
phase (as we have shown, the total number of infected is
still small compared to the population (see Table II), it is

10
possible that the containment measures modify the constant time scale of the exponential into a time-variable
one, whose time-dependence is described by the Gumbel
function. This is specified by two parameters µ and a,
which we have fitted from the available data in a number
of countries (Table I) and found that these parameters
can be robustly constrained from the whole time span,
or subsets of it, from the onset of the outbreak to the
current time, and their value remain unchanged in each
country.
The main practical message of this work, which stems
from the stability of the Gumbel parameters in each
country, is that reliable predictions of the future evolution of the COVID-19 outbreak, including key events, can
be obtained with substantial advance to inform critical
strategic decisions. These events include the time of the
peak and the time when the rate of new infections reaches
pre-set low level such that the epidemic can be managed
and social and economic activities can be resumed. All

that is required would be well-controlled and stable strategy of testing and measure of infections and tracking of
the evolution of the daily fraction of new infections. This
should be possible for most countries, provided that testing is carried out in a stable and well-controlled manner
that ensures that the daily rate of new infections is robustly and consistently measured and reported. At the
same time, such an analysis provides an effective monitor of the outbreak, helping governments to keep it at
a manageable level by strengthening (or softening) the
containment measures as needed.
