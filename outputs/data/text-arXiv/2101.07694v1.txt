Abstract
With a large proportion of the population currently hesitant to take the COVID-19 vaccine, it is important that people have access to accurate information. However, there is a
large amount of low-credibility information about the vaccines spreading on social media. In this paper, we present
a dataset of English-language Twitter posts about COVID19 vaccines. We show statistics for our dataset regarding the
numbers of tweets over time, the hashtags used, and the websites shared. We also demonstrate how we are able to perform analysis of the prevalence over time of high- and lowcredibility sources, topic groups of hashtags, and geographical distributions. We have developed a live dashboard to allow people to track hashtag changes over time. The dataset
can be used in studies about the impact of online information
on COVID-19 vaccine uptake and health outcomes.

Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic has killed two million people and
infected 93 million around the world as of mid-January,
2021 (Dong, Du, and Gardner 2020).Vaccines will be critical in our fight to end the COVID-19 pandemic (Orenstein
and Ahmed 2017). It is estimated that around 60-70% of
the population will need to be vaccinated against COVID19 to achieve herd immunity so that virus spread can be effectively suppressed (Aguas et al. 2020). However, recent
surveys have found that only 40-60% of American adults
reported that they would take a COVID-19 vaccine (Funk
and Tyson 2020; Hamel, Kirzinger, and Brodie 2020). With
these currently predicted levels of vaccine hesitancy, it is unlikely we will reach herd immunity; COVID-19 will remain
endemic in our population.
A possible driver for vaccine hesitancy is the antivaccination movement. This movement has been on the rise
in the U.S. for two decades, beginning with unfounded fears
over a Measles, Mumps and Rubella (MMR) vaccine (Hussain et al. 2018). The vocal online presence of the antivaccination movement has undermined confidence in vaccines. Worse, resistance to the COVID-19 vaccines is cur*

rently much more prevalent than resistance to the MMR vaccine. Since COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and its drivers remains understudied, a goal of our project is to help address
this gap.
There is a growing body of evidence linking social media and the antivaccination movement to vaccine hesitancy (Broniatowski et al. 2018; Burki 2019; Johnson et al.
2020). Studies show that vaccine hesitancy in one’s peer
group is associated with future vaccine refusal (Brunson
2013), and that misinformation spread on social networks is
linked to poor compliance with public health guidance about
COVID-19 (Roozenbeek et al. 2020). Based on these findings, the core hypothesis behind this project is that the social
spread of vaccine misinformation and vaccine hesitancy will
impact public health outcomes such as vaccine uptake and
COVID mortality rates.
Here we present a collection of English posts related to
the COVID-19 vaccines on Twitter. The collection is exempt
from IRB review as it only includes tweet IDs of public messages. This allows us to comply with the Twitter Terms of
Service while making the data available to both researchers
and the general public. Although there has been previous
work presenting COVID-19 Twitter datasets (Chen, Lerman,
and Ferrara 2020; Huang et al. 2020; Lamsal 2020), our
work focuses specifically on discussion of COVID-19 vaccines and related public health outcomes.
The CoVaxxy dataset will enable researchers to study vaccine misinformation and hesitancy, and their relationship to
public health outcomes. We will use established techniques
to track vaccine misinformation within the data, along with
misinformation superspreaders, coordinated campaigns, and
automated accounts (Yang, Hui, and Menczer 2019; Yang
et al. 2020; Pierri, Piccardi, and Ceri 2020a,b; Pacheco et al.
2020). We will also relate this social media data to geographic public health data (such as COVID-19 mortality and
vaccine uptake rates) by using geolocation data within the
dataset.
This paper describes relevant aspects of the CoVaxxy
dataset, which cover data collection, descriptive analyses of
the data and its potential usage, and a live dashboard intended for the public to track key insights drawn from the
data. Opportunities and limitations of the dataset are dis-

cussed as we draw conclusions.

Dataset curation
Our key data collection goal is to download a complete a set
of Twitter posts related to COVID-19 vaccines. In this section we describe our methodology for selecting appropriate
keywords to achieve such a coverage. We then describe our
architecture with server redundancy to maintain an unbroken
stream of Twitter data containing these keywords.

Identifying COVID-19 vaccines content
To create as complete a set of Twitter posts related to
COVID-19 vaccines as possible, we carefully select a list of
keywords through a snowball sampling technique (Conover
et al. 2012; Yang, Hui, and Menczer 2019). We start with
the two most relevant keywords, i.e., covid and vaccine,
as our initial seeds. Note that keywords also match hashtags, URLs, and substrings. For example, covid matches
“cnn.com/covid” and “#covid19.” Next, we gather tweets
utilizing the filtered stream endpoint of the Twitter API1 for
three hours. From these gathered tweets, we then identify
potential keywords that frequently co-occur with the seeds,
adding them to our seed list only after manually ensuring
they are closely related to our topic. This process was repeated six times between Dec. 15, 2020 and Jan. 2, 2021
with each iteration’s data collection taking place at different
times of the day to capture tweets from different geographic
areas and demographics. The seed list serves as our initial
keyword list.
We further refine the keyword list by manually combining certain keywords into composites, leveraging the query
syntax of Twitter’s filtered stream API. For example, using
covid19 pfizer as a composite matching phrase will
capture tweets that contain both “covid19” and “pfizer.” On
the other hand, including covid19 and pfizer as separate keywords will capture tweets that contain “covid19” or
“pfizer.” Constructing various composites of relevant keywords in this way ensures the dataset is broad enough to include most relevant (English) conversations while excluding
tweets that are not related to the vaccine discussion.

Content coverage
To demonstrate the effectiveness of the snowball sampling
technique introduced above, we calculate the popularity of
each (single or composite) keyword by the number of unique
tweets and unique users associated with it.
Figure 1 shows the effect of adding new keywords into the
list of streaming filters. The keywords are ranked by popularity. The diminishing growth of popularity suggests that
the inclusion of additional keywords is redundant for coverage of users and tweets. The diminishing returns are due
to the co-occurrence of multiple keywords and hashtags in
a single tweet, especially for the most popular terms. Thus,
we believe that our set of keywords provides reasonable coverage and is representative of tweets communicating about
COVID-19 vaccines.

matched tweets (purple, left) and unique users who posted
those tweets (green, right), in millions.

As the collection of tweets is intended to persist over time,
new keywords will emerge. To ensure that the keyword list
remains comprehensive throughout the data collection period, our team will continue to monitor the ongoing public
discussion related to COVID-19 vaccinations, should it become necessary to update the list with important emerging
keywords.

CoVaxxy system
System architecture
Our server architecture (Figure 2) is designed to collect and
process large quantities of data. The infrastructure is hosted
on Jetstream virtual machines (VMs) (Towns et al. 2014;
Stewart et al. 2015). To maintain the integrity of our tweet
streaming pipeline, we have incorporated redundancy. We
maintain two streamer (stream collection) VMs in different
U.S. states so that if one suffers a fault we can use data from
the other. These servers connect to Twitter’s filtered stream
API to collect tweets that match any of the keywords in real
time. We use the language metadata to filter out non-English
tweets.
The data from the two streamers is collated on a general
purpose server VM where we run data analysis. The server
VM is also linked to Anonymous University’s high performance computing infrastructure for running advanced analyses.
We will upload data files to a public data repository on
a regular basis. In compliance with Twitter’s Terms, we are
only able to share tweet IDs with the public. One can rehydrate the dataset by querying the Twitter API or using
tools like Hydrator2 or twarc3 .
Finally, a web server provides access to the data on the
server VM through applications. An example is the interactive dashboard, described next.

Dashboard
Existing COVID-19 visualization tools include those by
Johns Hopkins University (Dong, Du, and Gardner 2020)
and The Atlantic.4 These trackers address hospitalization
and mortality. Another dashboard from the Fondazione
Bruno Kessler covers the infodemic, reporting on the proportions of misinformation and epidemic-related stats (confirmed and death cases) per country.5 Finally, the Our World
in Data COVID-19 vaccination dataset publishes vaccine
uptake information by country. 6
A tool to concurrently explore the relationships between
COVID-19 vaccine conversations, vaccine uptake, and epidemic trends is missing. We plan a web-based visualization
to fill this void. The CoVaxxy dashboard will track and quantify credible information and misinformation narratives over
time, as well as their sources and related popular keywords.
The dashboard will focus on the U.S. at the state-level. It

will be updated daily. Figure 3 illustrates a simple prototype
that displays hashtag sharing behavior at the hourly level.
This data will be displayed alongside COVID-19 pandemic
and vaccine trends. By highlighting the connection between
misinformation and public health actions and outcomes, we
hope to encourage the public to be more vigilant about the
information they consume on their daily social media feeds
in the fight against COVID-19.

Data characterization
Our system started to gather tweets on Jan. 4, 2021. Table
1 provides a breakdown of the dataset (as of January 11)
in terms of the number of unique users, number of tweets
they shared, and numbers of unique hashtags and URLs contained in these tweets.

Volume
We show in Figure 4 a time series for the number of tweets
collected in our dataset, on an hourly basis. We can notice
a decrease in the number of tweets after January 6, which
might be driven by the increased media attention surrounding the storming of the U.S. Capitol.7 In fact, the mean daily
number of tweets decreases from 900k tweets in the period
of Jan 4–6 to 400k tweets in the period of Jan 7–11.
In Figure 5 we show the distribution of the tweets geolocated in the contiguous United States. We use a naive approach to match tweets to U.S. states: we first extract the
user location from the profile (if present) and then match it
against a dictionary of U.S. states. Finally, we compute the
number of tweets for each state based on the activity of users
geo-located in that state. Over 1M users in our dataset have
location metadata in their profile; we were able to match approximately 40k users resulting in 600k geo-located tweets.
Providing an accurate methodology to geo-locate users is
outside the scope of this paper; the reader should consider
these results only as an illustration of the insights that can
be gained from the CoVaxxy data.

Hashtags
Figure 6 lists the most tweeted hashtags in our dataset. We
can see that they are largely related to the SARS-CoV-2
vaccine, with one (“#covidiots”) referring to COVID-19 deniers.
Many different conversations can occur concurrently on
Twitter, using different hashtags for different topics. To cluster related hashtags, we have grouped them together using a
network algorithm. We form a co-occurrence network with

mation sources. However, one low-credibility source — “zerohedge.com” — also makes this list (see below for details
on the classification). We also observe a large number of
links to YouTube, which suggests further investigation will
be needed to assess the nature of this shared content.
Figure 9 provides a time series for the prevalence of lowand high-credibility information. We follow an approach
widely adopted in the literature (Lazer et al. 2018; Shao
et al. 2018; Bovet and Makse 2019; Grinberg et al. 2019;
Yang et al. 2020) to label links to news articles based on
source reliability. In particular, we use a third-party list of
675 low-credibility sources8 and 26 hand-selected mainstream sources. Overall, links to low-credibility sources accounts for 24,841 tweets compared to 72,680 tweets linking
to our sample of mainstream sources. Readers should note
that these numbers do not fully capture the news circulating
on Twitter, as the lists we employ cannot be exhaustive.
We further list in Figure 10 the 20 most shared news websites, including both source classes. We notice several unreliable sources (cf. “zerohedge.com” and “bitchute.com”)
that exhibit prevalence comparable to more reliable websites.

clustered using the Louvain method (Blondel et al. 2008).
Groups with hashtags that are used the most are plotted in
Figure 7. We observe groups of hashtags associated with
vaccine conspiracy theories (“#greatreset,” “#billgates”) as
well as positive messages (“#stayhome”).

In this paper we present a new public dataset tracking discourse about COVID-19 vaccines on Twitter. We characterize the data in several ways, including prominent keywords, geographic distribution of tweets, and clusters of related hashtags. We also present a prototype data dashboard
that will visualize statistics and insights from this data.
In future work, we intend to explore the relationship between online discussion of COVID-19 vaccines and public
health outcomes, like COVID-19 mortality and vaccine uptake. We will also leverage existing social media analysis
tools to track emerging narratives and suspicious accounts,
such as bots, coordinated campaigns, and troll farms (Yang,
Hui, and Menczer 2019; Yang et al. 2020; Pierri, Piccardi,
and Ceri 2020a,b; Pacheco et al. 2020). Finally, we plan to
explore models to better understand how vaccine misinformation and anti-vaccine sentiment spreads on social media.

This dataset has a few key limitations. First and critically,
Twitter users are not a representative sample of the population, nor are their posts a representative sample of public opinions (Wojick and Hughes 2020). The Twitter filtered
stream API also imposes a rate limitation of 1% of all public tweets, which could in future limit our ability to capture
all the relevant content. Another potential source of bias is

ally we are unable to fully exclude irrelevant material using
only keyword-based content filtering.
The long-term aim of this project is to tackle the ambitious challenge of linking social media observations directly
to public health. We hope that researchers will be able to
leverage the CoVaxxy dataset to obtain a clearer picture of
how vaccine hesitancy and misinformation affect health outcomes. In turn, such insight might enable public health officials to design better strategies for confronting vaccine hesitancy and refusal.

Data supplement
Along with this submission we will include a data file titled
covaxxy.tgz. Within that file there is a collection of tweet ids,
the list of keywords, and the lists of low- and high-credibility
websites. This content will be shared on websites in the future but these will not be anonymous so we can’t list them
here.
