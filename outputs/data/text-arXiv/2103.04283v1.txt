ABSTRACT
The widespread of Coronavirus has led to a worldwide pandemic
with a high mortality rate. Currently, the knowledge accumulated
from diﬀerent studies about this virus is very limited. Leveraging
a wide-range of biological knowledge, such as gene ontology and
protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks from other closely related species presents a vital approach to infer the molecular impact of a new species. In this paper, we propose the transferred
multi-relational embedding model Bio-JOIE to capture the knowledge of gene ontology and PPI networks, which demonstrates superb capability in modeling the SARS-CoV-2-human protein interactions. Bio-JOIE jointly trains two model components. The
knowledge model encodes the relational facts from the protein and
GO domains into separated embedding spaces, using a hierarchyaware encoding technique employed for the GO terms. On top of
that, the transfer model learns a non-linear transformation to transfer the knowledge of PPIs and gene ontology annotations across
their embedding spaces. By leveraging only structured knowledge,
Bio-JOIE signiﬁcantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in PPI type prediction on multiple species. Furthermore, we
also demonstrate the potential of leveraging the learned representations on clustering proteins with enzymatic function into enzyme commission families. Finally, we show that Bio-JOIE can
accurately identify PPIs between the SARS-CoV-2 proteins and human proteins, providing valuable insights for advancing research
on this new disease.

1 INTRODUCTION
The outbreak of COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease-2019) has infected
over millions of people and caused high death tolls since the end of
2019, as worldwide social and economic disruption. Tremendous
eﬀorts have been made to discover the infection mechanism of
the causative agent, named SARS-CoV-2. One important and urgent task is to understand the mechanism in which viral proteins
interact with human proteins. The new ﬁndings will enrich the
annotation of viral genomes [12] in biomedical knowledge bases
(KBs). Constructing and populating such biomedical KBs can signiﬁcantly improve our understanding of the processes by which
SARS-CoV-2 aﬀects diﬀerent cells in human body and will serve
as the foundation for many important downstream applications
such as vaccine development [17], drug repurposing [12, 36] and
drug side eﬀect detection [37].

In general, biological KBs, often stored as knowledge graphs
(KGs), consist of various biological entities, their properties and
relations. These KBs can be categorized in diﬀerent domains, such
as gene annotation, functional proteomic analysis, and transcriptomic proﬁling. Speciﬁcally, gene ontology (GO) [10, 16] is the
most widely used resource for gene function annotation; STRING

on three representative SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 proteins,
which possess multiple properties across three biological aspects: biological processes, cellular components and molecular functions.

[29], PDB [2] and neXtProt [19] collect the knowledge accumulated from functional proteomic analysis; Expression Atlas [25] is
a database facilitating the retrieval and analysis of gene expression
studies. While those KBs provide the essential sources of knowledge for in silico research in the corresponding domains, such domainspeciﬁc knowledge is often sparse and costly to apprehend [21, 30].
For example, PPI networks can be far from complete given the information supported by experimental results or suggested by computational inference [14, 21]. Makrodimitris et al. [21] indicate that
the numbers of PPIs in BIOGRID [24] for non-model organisms are
far less than expected, speciﬁcally, there are only 107 interactions
for tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) and 80 interactions for pig (Sus
scrofa). Evidently, relying on the KG from a single domain presents
the risk of learning from limited and scarce information.
The stored knowledge is often interrelated across diﬀerent perspectives. Hence, the missing knowledge in certain KBs can be
transferred from other KBs, and thus provide a more comprehensive representation of the biological entities. Taking the proteinprotein interaction (PPI) examples of the new SARS-CoV-2 proteins as illustrated in Figure 1, SARS-CoV-2 M protein interacts
with a list of human proteins, and ﬁve of them are involved in the
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) morphology process as suggested by
the gene ontology annotation (GO:0005783). Similarly, the SARSCoV-2 ORF3a also interacts with a list of human proteins. Among
these proteins, VSP39 and VSP11 are the core subunits of HOPS
complex, presenting a binding action as suggested by the STRING
database. While aligning the gene ontology annotations of the SARSCoV-2 M protein as demonstrated in Figure 2, the SARS-CoV M
protein presents a similar set of gene ontology annotations, such
as “host immune mitigation” and “virion membrane”, suggesting
that the side knowledge of gene ontology annotations can facilitate the inference of interactions for related proteins. More generally, the sparse domain information can always beneﬁt from the
supplementary knowledge from other relevant domains, therefore
calling upon a plausible method to support the fusion and transfer
of knowledge across multiple biological domains.

Regardless of the importance and advantages of knowledge fusion across diﬀerent domains [3, 5], fewer eﬀorts have been devoted to incorporating knowledge from diﬀerent domains for a speciﬁc task in computational biology studies. Onto2vec [27] presents
one state-of-the-art learning approach that successfully bridges
gene ontology annotations with the protein representation. However, the known PPI information is neglected and not encoded in
the obtained protein embeddings.
To combine multiple domain-speciﬁc biological knowledge, and
facilitate knowledge transfer across diﬀerent domains, we purpose
Bio-JOIE, a JoInt Embedding learning framework for multiple domains of Biological KBs. In Bio-JOIE, two model components are
jointly learned, i.e., a knowledge model characterizes diﬀerent domainspeciﬁc KGs in separate low-dimensional embedding spaces, and
a transfer model captures the cross-domain knowledge association.
More speciﬁcally, the knowledge model encodes the relational facts
of entities in each view into the corresponding embedding space
separately, with a hierarchy-aware technique designated for the
hierarchically-layered domains. Besides, the transfer model seeks
to transfer the knowledge between pairs of domains by employing a weighted non-linear transformation across their embedding
spaces. In evaluation, we apply the Bio-JOIE on several PPI networks with Gene Ontology annotations and the entire gene ontology and evaluate by PPI predictions. We compare Bio-JOIE with
that of the state-of-the-art representation learning approaches on
multiple species, including SARS-CoV-2-Human PPIs, with diﬀerent model settings. Our best Bio-JOIE outperforms alternative approaches by 7.4% in PPI prediction.
Our contributions are 4-fold. First, we construct a general framework for learning representations across diﬀerent domain-speciﬁc
KBs, including the dynamically changing SARS-CoV-2 KB. Second,
we emphasize and demonstrate that cross-domain representation
learning by the proposed Bio-JOIE can improve the inference in
one domain by leveraging the complementary knowledge from another domain. Extensive experiments on diﬀerent species conﬁrm
the eﬀectiveness of cross-domain representation learning. Third,
Bio-JOIE also demonstrates cross-species transferability to improve
PPI predictions among multiple species by knowledge population
from gene ontology. Fourth, the protein representations learned
from Bio-JOIE can be leveraged for diﬀerent tasks. Speciﬁcally,
we show that the protein embeddings trained on PPI network and
gene ontology present the potential to better group enzymes into
diﬀerent enzyme commission families. Tremendous eﬀorts have
been made to discover the infection mechanism of the causative
agent, named SARS-CoV-2.

2 MATERIALS AND METHOD
In this section, we present the proposed method to support representation learning and cross-domain knowledge transfer on biological KBs. Without loss of generality and aligned with the evaluation of the proposed Bio-JOIE, we refer two domain-speciﬁc KGs
in the following section to PPI networks and the gene ontology
graph. We begin with the formalized descriptions of the materials
and tasks.

Joint Representation Learning of Biological Knowledge Bases

2.1

Preliminary

Materials. A typical biological KB can be viewed as relational data
that are presented as an edge-labeled directed graph G, which is
formed with a set of entities (e.g. proteins) E and a set of relations
(e.g. interaction types) R. A triple (𝑠, 𝑟, 𝑡) ∈ G represents a 𝑟 ∈ R
typed relation between the source and target entities 𝑠, 𝑡 ∈ E, As
stated, we continue with the modeling on KGs of two domains,
PPI and gene ontology. For example, in the PPI network, a triple
(FBgn0011606, binding, FBgn0260855) simply states the fact
that two proteins (from ﬂy) have binding interaction; and in gene
ontology, a triple (GO:0008152, is a, GO:0008150) similarly
represents that GO:0008152 (a unique identiﬁer of “metabolic process”) is one subclass of GO:0008150 (a unique identiﬁer of “biological process”). Our model seeks to capture the protein information
in the triples (𝑠𝑝 , 𝑟 𝑝 , 𝑡𝑝 ) of PPI graph G𝑝 in a 𝑘𝑝 -dimensional embedding space, where we use boldfaced notations such as s𝑝 , r𝑝 , t𝑝 ∈
R𝑘𝑝 to denote the embedding representation. Similarly, gene ontology is another graph G𝑜 formed with a set of GO terms E𝑜 and
a set of semantic relations R𝑜 . The triple (𝑠𝑜 , 𝑟𝑜 , 𝑡𝑜 ) ∈ G𝑜 identiﬁes a semantic relation of GO terms, while we also observe hierarchical substructures formed by “subclass” or “is_a” relation as
the aforementioned example. The gene ontology is embedded in
another space R𝑘𝑜 , such that 𝑘𝑝 and 𝑘𝑜 may not be equivalent. We
use (𝑜, 𝑝) ∈ A to denote a GO term annotation where a GO term
𝑜 ∈ E𝑜 describes a protein 𝑝 ∈ E𝑝 of its corresponding functionality, and A denotes the set of such associations. As introduced in
Section 1, we consider SARS-CoV-2-Human interaction as a similar (but signiﬁcantly smaller) KBs with the same structures as G𝑝 ,
which serves as an extension of human PPI networks.
Tasks. To validate the learned embedding of biological entities
(proteins and GO terms in this context), we address the following two tasks. (i) PPI type prediction aims at predicting the interaction type between two interacting proteins, including SARS-CoV2 related PPIs; (ii) Protein clustering and family identiﬁcation aims
at clustering the existing proteins and helps identify the clusters
based on Enzyme Commission (EC) numbers.
Methods. The model architecture of Bio-JOIE is shown in Figure
3. The proposed Bio-JOIE jointly learns two types of model components to connect the two views of structured knowledge. Knowledge models are responsible for representing the relational knowledge of PPI and that of GO term into two separate embedding
spaces R𝑘𝑝 and R𝑘𝑜 by using KG embedding and hierarchy-aware
regularization. On top of that, a transfer model learns a transformation to connect between the representations of GO term relation
facts and PPI based on partially provided GO term assignments.
In particular, we investigate weighted transfer techniques to better
capture the knowledge transfer, for which the weights reﬂect the
speciﬁcity of the assigned GO term to a protein. The following of
this section describes the model components and the learning objective of Bio-JOIE in detail.

2.2

Knowledge Model

The knowledge models seek to characterize the semantic relations
of GO terms and PPI information into separate embedding spaces.
In each embedding space, the inference of relations or interactions
is modeled as speciﬁc algebraic vector operations. As mentioned,

Model seeks to encode relational facts in each domain respectively (such as proteins and gene ontology). Meanwhile,
the Transfer Model learns to connect both domains and enable knowledge transfer across protein and gene ontology.
the two views of gene ontology and PPI are embedded to separate
embedding spaces.
To capture a triple (𝑠, 𝑟, 𝑡) from either of the two domains, a
cost function 𝑓𝑟 (𝑠, 𝑡) is provided to measure its plausibility. A lower
score indicates a more plausible triple. We can adopt multiple vector operations in the deﬁned embedding space with three representative examples deﬁned as follows, i.e. translations (TransE [4]),
Hadamard product [33] and circular correlation (HolE [23]). The
cost functions are given as follows, where the symbol ◦ denotes
Hadamard product, and ★ : R𝑑 × R𝑑 → R𝑑 denotes circular correÍ
lation deﬁned as [a ★ b]𝑘 = 𝑑𝑖=0 𝑎𝑖 𝑏 (𝑘+𝑖) mod 𝑑 .
𝑓𝑟Trans (s, t) = ||s + r − t|| 2
𝑓𝑟Mult (s, t) = −(s ◦ t) · r
𝑓𝑟HolE (s, t) = −(s ★ t) · r
Since most of the relations in PPI networks are symmetric (such
as binding and catalysis), we apply the Hadamard product based
function. The learning objective of a knowledge model on a graph
𝐺 is to minimize the following margin ranking loss,

where 𝛾 G

is a positive margin, and a negative sample (𝑠 ′, 𝑟, 𝑡 ′ ) ∉ G
is created by randomly substituting either 𝑠 or 𝑡 using Bernoulli
negative sampling [32]. With regard to the two domains of relational knowledge (proteins and gene ontology) G𝑝 and G𝑜 , we deG

note the learning objective losses as L𝐾 𝑝 and L𝐾G𝑜 .
Hierarchy-aware Encoding Regularization As mentioned in
Section 2.1, it is observed that some ontological knowledge can
form hierarchies [8], which is typically constituted by a relation

BCB ’20, September 21–24, 2020, Virtual Event, USA

with the implicit hierarchical property, such as “subclass_of”, as
substructures. In gene ontology, more than 50% of the triples have
such relations. To better characterize such hierarchies, we model
such substructures diﬀerently from the aforementioned DistMult
and many others by adding hierarchy regularization. More specifically, given entity pairs (𝑒𝑙 , 𝑒ℎ ) ∈ 𝑆 where 𝑒𝑙 is a subclass of 𝑒ℎ ,
we model such hierarchies by minimizing the distance between
coarser concepts and associated ﬁner concepts in embedding space.
Hence, the loss is simply deﬁned as
Õ
1
L (HA) =
[||𝑒𝑙 − 𝑒ℎ || 2 − 𝛾 HA ] +
|𝑆 |
(𝑒𝑙 ,𝑒ℎ ) ∈𝑆

where [𝑥] + = max{𝑥, 0} and 𝛾 HA is also a positive margin parameter. This penalizes the case where the embedding of 𝑒𝑙 falls out the
𝛾 HA -radius neighborhood centered at the embedding of 𝑒ℎ .
Relation Inference. Given the learned embeddings and a pair of
query proteins ((𝑝 1, 𝑝 2 )), we can predict the most plausible interaction type 𝑟 by selecting the optimal 𝑓𝑟 (𝑝 1, 𝑝 2 ) score. We can also
provide predictions for possible protein targets given the query of
the subject protein and speciﬁc interaction type (𝑝, 𝑟, ?𝑡) by populating the selection proteins with top score 𝑓𝑟 (𝑝, 𝑡) from the knowledge model. Details about each task are curated in Section 3.3 and
3.5.

2.3

Transfer Model

The transfer model learns to connect between the above two relational embedding spaces via a non-linear transformation. The
transformation is induced based on the GO term assignments, towards the goal to collocate the associated GO terms and proteins
in an embedding space after transformation. Hence, the aﬃnity of
embedding structures of gene ontology and PPIs can be captured.
This allows the relational knowledge to transfer across and complement the learning and inference on both domains.
Given each GO term assignment (𝑜, 𝑝) ∈ A, following function
𝑓𝑇 (𝑜, 𝑝) measures the plausibility of the transformation that is favored to be minimized.
𝑓𝑇 (𝑜, 𝑝) = k𝜎 (M𝑇 · p + b𝑇 ) − ok 2
M𝑇 ∈ R𝑘𝑜 ×𝑘𝑝 thereof is a weight matrix and b𝑇 ∈ R𝑘𝑝 is a bias
vector. 𝜎 is either the identify function, or a non-linear function as
tanh, the latter thereof aim at smoothing the transformation with
additional non-linearity.
2.3.1 Basic Transfer Model. The basic strategy to learn the transfer model is to treat each GO term assignment evenly, and thereby
minimizing the following learning objective loss.

terms and proteins, in contract to general GO terms, more speciﬁed GO terms necessarily carry more precise descriptions to the
proteins. Hence, an improved transfer model weights among GO
term associations to a protein for the purpose of more attentively
capturing those with more speciﬁc GO terms. Let 𝜔 (𝑜) be a weight

Figure 4: Explanation of weighted transfer model for modeling hierarchical gene ontology.
Exemplarily, there could be several ways to calculate the association weight.
Level-based weight. The level of the node in one hierarchical
taxonomy is a natural indicator of its speciﬁcity. Accordingly, the
weight can be deﬁned as,
𝑙
𝜔 (𝑜) =
𝑙 max
where 𝑙 is the term’s current depth and 𝑙 max is the maximum length
of the associated branch in the gene ontology DAG.
Degree centrality weight. A small node’s degree centrality in the
graph roughly reﬂects its specialty and we apply
1
𝜔 (𝑜) =
𝑑 (𝑜)
as the balance factor for diﬀerent GO term specialty.
In practice, incorporating a speciﬁcity-based weight to the transfer model essentially enhances the inference in the protein domain,
as we have observed in the evaluation in Section 3. However, the
above weight options generally yield similar performance gain,
and we ﬁx the weight option as the level-based weight in our experimental setting.

2.4 Joint Learning Objectives

𝑝 ′,

Bio-JOIE jointly learns two knowledge models respectively for
GO term relations and PPIs, and a transfer model to support knowledge transfer between these two. Therefore, the joint learning objective minimizes the following loss,

∉ A thereof is a negative sample by randomly substituting
and 𝛾 A is a positive margin.

2.3.2 Weighed Transfer Model. Since some ontological knowledge,
such as gene ontology, may form hierarchical structures, where GO
terms in lower levels typically describe more speciﬁed gene functionality. During the characterization of associations between GO

G𝑝

L = 𝜆𝑡 L𝑇 + 𝜆𝑝 L𝐾 + L𝐾G𝑜

Joint Representation Learning of Biological Knowledge Bases

𝜆𝑝 and 𝜆𝑡 are two positive hyperparameters. We use Adam [18]
to optimize the learning objective loss. The learning process uses
orthogonal initialization [26] to initialize the weight matrix, and
Xavier normal initialization [11] for vector parameters. A normalization constraint is enforced to keep all embedding vectors of GO
terms and proteins on unit hyper-spherical surfaces, which is to
prevent the non-convex optimization process from collapsing to a
trivial solution where all vectors shrink to zero [4, 13, 20, 33].
Note that Bio-JOIE is suitable for joint representation learning
on proteomic knowledge of diﬀerent species. In this protein-GO
example, the proteins of these species are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent
from each other. However, they share the same set of annotations
in the GO domain. Therefore, More speciﬁcally, if we have multiple PPI networks G𝑖 , 𝑖 = 1, 2, . . . , 𝑚 where 𝑚 denotes the number of
independent species, 𝑛 knowledge models are trained respectively.
Consequently, one unique transfer model is also trained to facilitate the protein-GO knowledge transfer regarding each species.
The learning objective on the multi-species setting is changed accordingly as,

L=

𝑚
Õ
𝑖=1

𝜆𝑖𝑡 L𝑇 +

𝑚
Õ
𝑝 G
𝜆𝑖 L𝐾 𝑝 + L𝐾G𝑜
𝑖=1

with the assumption that the knowledge model for gene ontology
remains unchanged.
In addition to joint learning on multiple species, Bio-JOIE can
also be re-trained from new observations of PPIs. For example,
suppose newly discovered SARS-CoV-2-Human PPI knowledge extends the original human PPI networks, we can ﬁne-tune the Bio-JOIE
from the saved model and obtained embeddings, by only optimizing the Bio-JOIE on the new triples and hence fast obtain representations for all new proteins, without a long time for retraining
the Bio-JOIE from scratch.

RESULTS

In this section, we evaluate the embeddings learned from Bio-JOIE
with two groups of tasks: PPI type prediction (Section 3.3) and protein clustering based on enzymatic functions (Section 3.4). Furthermore, we provide an extensive case study in Section 3.5 on SARSCoV-2 related PPI prediction and classiﬁcation.

3.1

Dataset

The protein-protein interactions for yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae),
ﬂy (Drosophila melanogaster), and human (Homo sapiens) are collected from the STRING [29] database. There are seven types of
interactions annotated in the STRING database. To preserve a balanced and suﬃcient number of cases in each class, we randomly
choose the protein pairs from four types of interaction: activation,
binding, catalysis, and reaction. In total, there are 21704, 10000,
36400 pairs of proteins for yeast, ﬂy, and human, respectively; each
type contains roughly the same number of interactions. Table 1
summarizes the PPI information for each species. Note that, the
human PPI dataset does not contain the virus-generated proteins,
but the set partially overlaps with the virus-human pan-PPI networks.

BCB ’20, September 21–24, 2020, Virtual Event, USA

The gene ontology annotations for each protein are extracted
from gene ontology Consortium [10], including all three biological aspects: biological process (BP), cellular components (CC), and
molecular function (MF). Table 2 summarizes the number of relations between proteins and GO terms. The relations between GO
terms include is-a, part-of, has-part, regulates, positively-regulates,
and negatively-regulates.

For the SARS-CoV-2 dataset, we collect the latest virus-protein
interaction from BioGrid1 and the limited GO annotations for SARSCoV-2 from Gene Ontology Consortium2 , as last updated on early
April. In summary, there are 26 SARS-CoV-2 generated proteins
and 332 human proteins presenting the evidence of viral-human
protein interactions as suggested by Gordon et al. [12]. The selection is based on a high MIST score and a low SAINTexpress BFDR
from Aﬃnity Capture-MS. Out of the same experiment, we select
1131 viral-human protein pairs with MIST scores lower than 0.01
as our negative samples. The 26 SARS-CoV-2 generated proteins
are annotated with 282 GO terms. In addition to SARS-CoV-2, BioGrid also includes 30 viral proteins from SARS-CoV and MERSCoV, which are two similar contagious viruses causing respiratory
infection. These 30 viral proteins are annotated with 630 GO terms,
and display 326 interactions with human proteins. All processed
datasets are available at https://www.haojunheng.com/project/goterm.

3.2 Baselines
We compare Bio-JOIE with the most applicable state-of-the-art
approach, Onto2Vec [27], on learning the representation of proteins. Onto2Vec considered the annotation from gene ontology for
representation learning. In addition, we compare Bio-JOIE with
a simpler setting, Bio-JOIE-NonGO, where we only consider the
single-domain knowledge of PPI.

to be an improved version of Onto2Vec. Similar to Onto2Vec, it
only considers the direct relationship between a protein and a GO
term, without parents and ancestors. We ﬁnd that OPA2Vec performs slightly better than Onto2Vec on Yeast and Fly, but worse on
Human. In addition, OPA2Vec falls short when compared to any of
the Bio-JOIE variants, indicating that incorporating the metadata
of GO terms is insuﬃcient for protein representation learning.
It is noteworthy that unlike Onto2Vec, which achieves its best
performance with the help of full gene ontology (i.e. Onto2VecAncestor), our Bio-JOIE model can utilize only the GO terms that
are directly annotated with the proteins to accomplish the highest accuracy score. This also makes Bio-JOIE training processes
more time eﬃcient. We hypothesize that for Bio-JOIE in the PPI
type prediction task, GO terms that are directly related to associated proteins with high speciﬁcity are suﬃcient for the transfer model to model the protein-GO association in the embedding
spaces. In contrast, Onto2Vec needs entire structured information
of GO terms for its word2vec module to construct an exhaustive
context of protein features.

We further explore the eﬀects of three diﬀerent aspects of gene
ontology in predicting the types of PPIs. To achieve this, we train
Bio-JOIE in settings where only speciﬁc aspects of gene ontology
annotations are used. Results are shown in Table 4, in which BP, CC
and MF respectively refer to the cases where GO terms of biological
processes, cellular components and molecular functions are used. “BP
+ CC” denotes that the GO terms from both biological processes
and cellular components are included in training. We observe that
Bio-JOIE performs the best with GO terms from all aspects (full
gene ontology). This phenomenon is consistent among all three
species, indicating that the protein representations are more robust when learning from a more enhanced knowledge graph. It is
also interesting to see that the accuracy of the task is generally
higher when we include the GO terms from biological processes.
This leads to 2.61% improvement in accuracy over CC, and at least
2.13% of improvement over MF when evaluating individually. In
the two-aspect evaluation, “BP+CC” is in average leads to 0.7% better accuracy than “CC+MF”. This is attributed to the fact that BP
is the largest group in the gene ontology, containing more entities
and relational facts. Consequently, Bio-JOIE achieves the best performance with all three aspects of gene ontology annotations incorporated. This indicates that the characterization of PPIs beneﬁts
from more comprehensive gene ontology annotations.
In addition to joint learning from two diﬀerent domains (i.e. GO
terms and PPIs), as mentioned in Section 2.4, Bio-JOIE can be

trained to capture PPIs for multiple species with several speciesspeciﬁc knowledge models, along with transfer models that bridge
the universal gene ontology. To validate the beneﬁt of joint learning on multiple species together, we consider three following conﬁgurations of Bio-JOIE: (i) the “multi-way” setting uses one unique
knowledge model and one transfer model to the universal gene
ontology for each species; (ii) the “concat” setting uses one uniﬁed knowledge model to capture all species of PPIs, together with
one transfer model to learn protein-GO alignments, that is, simply concatenate all PPI triples and all gene ontology annotations
of proteins in multiple species; (iii) the “single” setting trains separately on each species, which is exactly the same as in the setting
in Table 3. We summarize the results in Table 5. It is observed that
the “multi-way” setting can slightly improve PPI performance in
comparison to the “ single” setting that trains separately on each
species. Also in the “concat” setting with one shared transfer model
and knowledge model, the performance signiﬁcantly drops with a
2.8% decrease of accuracy on average compared to the “single” setting. Such results suggest that each species has unique patterns
of PPIs, such diﬀerences are better diﬀerentiated in separate embedding spaces. Hence, the multi-way setting better encodes the
species-speciﬁc knowledge and model, which helps the type prediction of PPIs for each species by Bio-JOIE that are jointly trained
on multiple species.

3.4 Identifying Protein Families And Enzyme
Commission Based Clustering
Besides inferring PPI types, the embedding representations of proteins can also be used to identify potential protein families based
on their functions. This can be achieved by performing clustering
algorithms on the learned protein embeddings.
The Enzyme Commission number (EC number) deﬁnes a hierarchical classiﬁcation scheme that provides the enzyme nomenclature based on enzyme-catalyzed reactions. The top-level EC numbers contain seven classes: oxidoreductases, transferases, hydrolases, lyases, isomerases, ligases, and translocases. In this experiment, we select 1340 yeast proteins in total with enzymatic functions. We learn the protein representations using all the triples of
PPI networks and the annotation from gene ontology and evaluate the learned representations of these proteins by performing
the k-means clustering algorithm to group them into seven nonoverlapping clusters. These clusters are compared with the toplevel of enzyme commission classiﬁcation. Purity score is reported
as evaluation metrics.
The evaluation of the clustering results is shown in Table 6.
Bio-JOIE achieves the best clustering performance on yeast by
a relative increase of 9.7%, which demonstrates that Bio-JOIE has

BCB ’20, September 21–24, 2020, Virtual Event, USA

the good model capability to representation learning and empirically show the validity of the learned embeddings to measure the
similarity. We hypothesize that Bio-JOIE better incorporates protein annotation resource and utilizes the complementary knowledge in the gene ontology domain, while Bio-JOIE also captures
PPI information and encode it into protein embeddings. This in
the end results in comprehensive representations for proteins and
helps to identify protein EC classes by clustering.

Case Study: SARS-CoV-2-Human Protein
Target Prediction

The COVID-19 pandemic requires many eﬀorts and attentions from
scientists of diﬀerent ﬁelds. However, there is very limited knowledge of the molecular details of SARS-CoV-2. In this subsection,
we apply Bio-JOIE to gain more insights of the PPI network between SARS-CoV-2 and human proteins. Speciﬁcally, we explore
the potential of Bio-JOIE on predicting whether a pair of human
and SARS-CoV-2 proteins interact or not. This is modeled as a binary prediction task. Correspondingly, results from the binary predictions can serve as a guide to identify the targeted proteins by
SARS-CoV-2. We ﬁrst use the known interactions between these
two species to validate the eﬀectiveness of Bio-JOIE. These interactions are experimentally veriﬁed as described in Section 3.1. In
this setting, we particularly study the contribution of the knowledge of other closely related viruses (SARS-CoV and MERS) on
supporting PPI prediction. We also show the high-conﬁdence candidates of targeted human proteins predicted by Bio-JOIE for four
selected SARS-CoV-2 proteins.
Experimental setting. In this experiment, we randomly split the
known positive human-virus PPIs into train and test sets with a
ratio of 80% and 20%. We train Bio-JOIE on this train set along
with human PPIs. For evaluation, positive test samples and selected
negative samples, mentioned in Section 3.1 are used to perform

on SARSCoV-2 PPI prediction. From the observation in Section 3.3, two important factors are considered: three aspects in the gene ontology
domain and the scope of input SARS-CoV-2-Human PPIs. More
speciﬁcally, we deﬁne increasingly four scopes of input PPIs, as
shown in Figure 5, i.e. (1) S1: Only using the train folds of SARSCoV-2-Human PPIs; (2) S2: Using SARS-CoV-2-Human PPIs with

PPIs with all protein interactions in S3 plus all SARS-CoV and
MERS PPIs. As for the aspects of the gene ontology domain, similar
to Table 4 in Section 3.3, we adopt eight options, i.e. one without
gene ontology information (NonGO), three using a single aspect
of GO terms (BF, CC, MF), three options using two of the aspects
(BF+CC, etc) and one using all three aspects (AllGO).
The results are summarized in Table 7. In terms of gene ontology aspects, we observe that CC contributes the most compared
to other aspects of gene ontology annotations, and the best performance is achieved by adopting CC+MF in Bio-JOIE learning. One
explanation is that most of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins have CC annotations and these annotations make up over 70% of all currently
available annotations on average. However, less than 5 proteins
(such as NSP and ORF 1a) have BF and MF annotations, possibly
due to insuﬃcient knowledge on understanding SARS-CoV-2 biological mechanism. As for the input ﬁelds, we ﬁnd that the performance drastically increases with the expansion of input from S1
to S2, which indicates that interactions of 2-hop neighbor proteins
can beneﬁt SARS-CoV-2 PPI prediction. However, such a trend is
not clearly observed when expanding the input ﬁeld from S2 to S3.
We hypothesize that proteins that are not within 2-hop neighbors
may not be very related to SARS-CoV-2 or provide beneﬁcial insights. Interestingly, when adding interactions of two related coronaviruses (SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV) that cause respiratory infection,
the performance continues to improve with a relative gain of 3.4%.
As shown in Figure. 2, viruses that are closely related to SARS-CoV2 tend to share important properties. This strongly suggests that

Joint Representation Learning of Biological Knowledge Bases

it is crucial to leverage their interactions and gene ontology annotations as augmented knowledge for drastically emerging SARSCoV-2.

Besides providing PPI prediction, the proposed model can help
by identifying high-conﬁdence candidates for potential human protein targets; this is considered as a link prediction task. When a
viral protein (such as SARS-CoV-2 M protein) is given as the query,
along with a speciﬁc relation (such as “binding” under the experiment system type of “Aﬃnity Capture-MS”), Bio-JOIE can output
a list of most likely protein targets by enumerating the triples with
top 𝑓𝑟 (ℎ, 𝑡) scores. The predictions are listed in Table 8. It is our observation, Bio-JOIE can successfully predict the high-conﬁdence
human protein targets in the test set from by [12] among its top
predictions (marked as boldfaced entities). Other than the proteins
in the test set, Bio-JOIE can also provide a list of reasonable candidates that possess a relatively high MIST score. For example,
P62834 is one of the top-ranked protein targets of SARS-CoV-2
NSP7 by our Bio-JOIE, which has a MIST score of 0.658. Diving
deep into the facts for P62834, though P62834 is not considered
as a high-conﬁdence target by [12], we observe that both P62834
(RAB1A_HUMAN) and SARS-CoV-2 NSP7 interacts with protein
P62820 (RAB1A_HUMAN). Besides, they are both annotated with
the cellular component GO:0016020 (membrane) and enables molecular function GO:0000166 (nucleotide binding), which are possibly
the reasons for Bio-JOIE making such prediction with a high rank.
Furthermore, Bio-JOIE’s predictions include proteins that are not
covered by [12], which inspires further scientiﬁc research to verify.
We further investigate how the information suﬃciency of SARSCoV-2 related PPIs in training set aﬀect the performance. We deﬁne
the train-set ratio parameter as means the proportions of the SARSCoV-2-Human PPIs that are used for training Bio-JOIE and follow
the aforementioned evaluation protocol on “NonGO/S3”, “CC/S3”,
“CC+MF/S3” and “CC+MF/S4” as input other than the control of
SARS-CoV-2-Human PPIs part. We plot the PPI results in Figure
6. As expected, when the proportion of SARS-CoV-2-Human PPIs
used for training increases from 20% to 80%, the F1 score improves
from 0.2-0.3 to around 0.8, which strongly conﬁrms that the known
SARS-CoV-2-Human PPIs serve as one signiﬁcant factor to the PPI
prediction. Moreover, the more knowledge we know about existing SARS-CoV-2 interaction, the more powerful the model is to
predict SARS-CoV-2. We also observe that the performance is not
saturated when the training ratio is approaching 100%, which possibly results from the fact that as a novel coronavirus, the current

advances based on new discoveries.

4 RELATED WORK
In the past decade, much attention has been paid to representation
learning of KBs. Methods along this line of research typically encode entities into low dimensional embedding spaces, where the
relational inference [32], proximity measures and alignment [9]
of those entities can be supported in the form of vector algebras.
Therefore, they provide eﬃcient and versatile methods to incorporate the symbolic knowledge of KGs into statistical learning and
inference. Some existing approaches focus speciﬁcally on computational biology studies [1, 6, 15, 27, 34], which similarly embed
features of biological entities within low-dimensional representations. One representative work related to ours is Onto2Vec [27],
in which protein representations are learned by incorporating the
full semantic content of gene ontology in the feature learning using
Word2Vec [22]. However, Onto2Vec replies on the ontology information, while falls short of capturing the multi-relational semantic
facts that are important to characterize the proximity of biological
entities. For example, regarding the protein and GO terms, the PPI
knowledge and the non-hierarchical relationships between gene
ontology entities (such as “regulates”) are not considered.
Another thread of related work is joint representation learning
for multiple KGs, where embedding models are learned to bridge
multiple relational structures for tasks such as entity alignment
and type inference. MTransE [9] jointly learns a transformation
across two separate translational embedding spaces based on oneto-one seed alignment of entities. Later extensions of this model
family, such as KDCoE [7], MultiKE [35] and JAPE [28], require
additional information of literal descriptions [7] and numerical attributes of entities [28, 31, 35] that are generally not available for
biological KB. Our recent development on this line of research, i.e.
JOIE [13] learns a many-to-one mapping between entity embeddings and ontological concept embeddings, and aims at resolving

BCB ’20, September 21–24, 2020, Virtual Event, USA

the entity type inference task using the latent space of the type ontology. One of the caveats is that JOIE does not speciﬁcally incorporate the speciﬁcity of concepts in the ontology in the transfer process, for which we ﬁnd to be particularly beneﬁcial in this problem
setting. Besides, the aforementioned methods are mostly for general encyclopedia KBs (such as Wikidata, DBpedia) and have not
been adapted for the purpose the modeling biological KBs. More
speciﬁcally, in contrast to these methods, our method features the
characterization of more complicated many-to-many associations
between proteins and GO terms. Besides, instead of predicting the
alignment of entities, we focus on transferring relational knowledge from one domain to enhance the prediction on the other.

CONCLUSION

In this paper, we present a novel model Bio-JOIE, that enables endto-end representation learning for cross-domain biological knowledge bases. Our approach utilizes the knowledge model to capture
structural and relational facts within each domain and motivates
the knowledge transfer by alignments among domains. Extensive
experiments on the tasks of PPI type prediction and clustering
demonstrate that Bio-JOIE can successfully leverage complementary knowledge from one domain to another and therefore enable
learning entity representation in multiple interrelated and transferable domains in biology. More importantly, Bio-JOIE also provides
interaction type predictions on SARS-CoV-2 with human protein
targets, which potentially brings reliable computational methods
seeking new directions on drug design and disease mitigation.
In our main directions of future research, we plan to enhance
and extend entity representations by systematically incorporating
important multimodal features and annotations. For example, primary sequence information and secondary geometric folding features can be modeled simultaneously in protein networks and their
combined representation can lead to a comprehensive understanding that will greatly beneﬁt many downstream applications.
