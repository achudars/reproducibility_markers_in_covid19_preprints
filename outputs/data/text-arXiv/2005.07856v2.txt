ABSTRACT
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has impacted almost every part of human
life worldwide, posing a massive threat to human health. There is no specific
drug for COVID-19, highlighting the urgent need for the development of effective
therapeutics. To identify potentially repurposable drugs, we employed a
systematic approach to mine candidates from U.S. FDA-approved drugs and
preclinical small-molecule compounds by integrating the gene expression
perturbation data for chemicals from the Library of Integrated Network-Based
Cellular Signatures project with a publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing
dataset from mild and severe COVID-19 patients. We identified 281 FDAapproved drugs that have the potential to be effective against SARS-CoV-2
infection, 16 of which are currently undergoing clinical trials to evaluate their
efficacy against COVID-19. We experimentally tested the inhibitory effects of
tyrphostin-AG-1478 and brefeldin-a on the replication of the single-stranded
ribonucleic acid (ssRNA) virus influenza A virus. In conclusion, we have identified
a list of repurposable anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs using a systems biology approach.

INTRODUCTION
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious respiratory disease
resulting from a life-threatening novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It has spread rapidly across the globe,
resulting in over 42.5 million confirmed cases and 1.1 million deaths as of
October 25, 20201, 2. SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped RNA virus that belongs to the
genus Betacoronavirus of the family Coronaviridae, which includes well-known
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East
respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)3. Advancement in the

management of these coronaviruses and other viruses, such as influenza virus
H1N1 and Ebola infections, has provided insight into treating COVID-19.
More than 3,600 active clinical trials for COVID-19 are being performed4, 5.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there are more than 154
candidate vaccines in preclinical evaluation and 44 candidate vaccines in phase
1 trials or beyond (last updated: October 25, 2020), several of which have
entered phase 3 large-scale randomized clinical trials and shown benefits6.
Unexpected side effects and immune-escape mutations pose a great challenge
for the safety and efficacy of vaccines7. Chloroquine8, 9 and its hydroxyl analog
hydroxychloroquine10, lopinavir/ritonavir11-13, and remdesivir9, 14, developed for
treating malaria, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and Ebola virus,
respectively, have been previously suggested to treat COVID-19 and are being
tested in clinical trials. However, at present, some clinical trials have shown that
these drugs have little or no effect on the treatment of hospitalized COVID-19
patients15-19. Hence, there is an urgent need to search for new repurposed drugs.
COVID-19 is not the first outbreak of zoonotic coronaviruses. The severe
acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak, first identified in the Guangdong
Province of southern China in 2002, lasted for eight months, resulting in 8,098
confirmed human cases in 29 countries, with 774 deaths (case fatality rate of
9.6%)20, 21. Approximately ten years later, in 2012, Saudi Arabia isolated another
highly pathogenic coronavirus, MERS-CoV, from the sputum of a male patient
who died of acute pneumonia and renal failure22. MERS-CoV caused an
outbreak with 2,260 cases and 803 deaths (case fatality rate of 35.5%)23, 24.
Although COVID-19 is less fatal than SARS and MERS, older patients
with comorbidities tend to experience more severe symptoms, making them more
vulnerable. Most SARS-CoV-2-infected patients display mild symptoms and
generally have a good prognosis, classified as mild COVID-1911, 25. However, a
large proportion of patients, especially older men with underlying chronic
diseases, have rapidly progressed to severe COVID-19 and suffered from
respiratory distress requiring emergent medical interventions26. Unfortunately,

there are no FDA-approved vaccines or specific and effective drugs for COVID19 yet4, 5.
Additionally, recent studies have shown the critical roles of host immune
responses in protection and the pathogenesis of respiratory viral infections, for
instance, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and influenza A viruses27, 28. Liao et al. 29
reported that an increase in CD8+ T cells in COVID-19 patients correlates with an
improved outcome. They also proposed therapeutic strategies by targeting the
myeloid cell compartment to treat COVID-19-associated inflammation.
It is critical to find potentially useful drugs for COVID-19 among currently
available drugs. Drug repurposing is an essential and universal strategy in
developing new drugs and a potentially important strategy for discovering
existing medicines to tackle COVID-1930. It may facilitate the discovery of new
mechanisms of action for existing drugs, which is less time consuming and is
cost effective, and moreover, the pharmaceutical supply chains for formulation
and distribution already exist31, 32. Gordon et al.33 also reported 69 repurposable
known compounds targeting 66 human proteins based on 332 high-confidence
SARS-CoV-2-human protein-protein interactions, which were physically
associated by using affinity-purification mass spectrometry. Another study34
presented data on the antiviral activity of 20 FDA-approved drugs against SARSCoV-2 that have previously been shown to inhibit SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Another research team35 conducted a high-throughput analysis of the ReFRAME
library to identify 30 candidate existing drugs that prevent SARS-CoV-2 from
replicating in mammalian cells. In a study36 based on public data of patients with
pulmonary fibrosis and the Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular
Signatures (LINCS)37, several drugs targeting ACE2 were identified to be
repurposable against COVID-19.
Considering that an RNA virus exhibits a considerable degree of sequence
variation, drugs targeting host factors may cause less mutational resistance with
more significant and broad antiviral spectrum potential38. Hence, there is an
urgent need to identify potential therapeutics with new strategies for emerging

infectious diseases. Repurposing clinically assessed drugs represents one of the
most practical strategies for rapidly identifying treatments to combat COVID-19.
In this study, we analyzed a publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing
(scRNA-seq) dataset of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) collected from mild
and severe COVID-19 patients as well as separate bulk RNA-seq data of BALF
from COVID-19 patients (Figure 1). Data mining was performed by using the
drug perturbation database LINCS to identify potential therapies for COVID-19. A
total of 281 candidates with different courses of COVID-19 independent of cell
subtypes were identified. Additionally, we identified and validated two candidates
without adverse drug reactions (ADRs), tyrphostin-AG-1478 and brefeldin-a,
exhibiting antiviral activity against the single-stranded ribonucleic acid (ssRNA)
virus influenza A virus (IAV). Our findings may aid in the rapid preclinical and
clinical evaluation of these therapeutics and provide an important drug discovery
pipeline to accelerate and facilitate the development of potential treatments for
COVID-19.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
ScRNA-seq data analysis and sample aggregation
The gene-barcode matrix files of all 6 COVID-19 donors containing 3 mild cases
and 3 severe cases (lung BALF) and 3 healthy controls (lung tissues) were
downloaded from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus database (accession ID:
GSE145926)29. The expression matrices were loaded into the R statistical
analysis platform using Seurat v339, keeping only the cells with gene numbers
between 200 and 6,000, unique molecular identifier (UMI) count above 1,000,
and mitochondrial gene percentage below 0.1. A total of 43,914 cells from 9
samples were used for our further analyses. In addition to these scRNA-seq
data, we also collected a list of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in a
separate cohort of SARS-CoV-2-infected lung BALF using a bulk RNA-seq
analysis to compare against the single cell-based data. This DEG list was
obtained from the Chinese National Genomics Data Center
(https://bigd.big.ac.cn/; accession ID: CRA002390)40.

Dimensionality reduction and clustering
The LogNormalize method in Seurat was used for normalizing the filtered genebarcode matrix. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed by using the
top 2,000 most variable genes. Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection
(UMAP) was performed on the top 50 principal components for visualizing the
cells. Graph-based clustering was performed on the PCA-reduced data with
Seurat.
Differential analysis for clusters among the three groups
MAST, a generalized linear model framework treating the cellular detection rate
as a covariate, was used to perform differential analysis. DEGs were identified by
comparing each cluster between all three groups. Genes with average |log2FC| >
0.25 and adjusted p-value < 0.05 were deemed DEGs.
Drug repurposing using the LINCS drug-perturbation data
DEGs were first sorted by the log2FC values. The upregulated and
downregulated genes were then chosen to identify drugs and compounds against
the LINCS database using the Connectivity Map Linked User Environment
(CLUE: https://clue.io) platform37. The drug connectivity score (CS) with a
negative value smaller than -90 was used to determine candidate drugs and
compounds. The COVID-19 database from the International Clinical Trials
Registry Platform (ICTRP) (https://www.who.int/ictrp/en/, updated on Oct 25th,
2020) was searched for clinical trial information associated with these drugs.
Adverse drug reaction analysis
Both on-label and off-label adverse drug reactions (ADRs) of all candidate drugs
with CS values smaller than -90 were collected from the SEP-L1000 database
(https://maayanlab.net/SEP-L1000/). The SEP-L1000 data include on-label ADRs
of FDA-approved drugs collected from SIDER41 and off-label ADRs from the

PharmGKB database42 based on the postmarketing ADR reports in the FDA
Adverse Event Report System (FAERS).
Cells and virus
Calu-3 and Vero E6 cells were maintained in Eagle’s minimum essential medium
(EMEM, Quality Biological Inc) supplemented with 10% heated-inactivated fetal
bovine serum (FBS, Gibco) and penicillin and streptomycin (100 U/ml; Gibco) at
37°C with 5% CO2. Influenza A virus (IAV, Puerto Rico/8/1934(H1N1)) viral
stocks were titered by TCID50, as described previously43. These experiments
were performed under biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) conditions.
Antiviral assay
The drug-induced cytotoxicity of the test drugs (tyrphostin-AG-1478 and
brefeldin-a) on Calu-3 and Vero E6 cells was determined by a cell counting kit 8
(CCK-8, APExBIO). Cells were cultured overnight in 96-well cell-culture Petri
dishes at a density of 1 × 104 cells/well. A 10 mM stock of drug was serially
diluted in 100% DMSO to obtain a 10-point dilution series. Plates were cultured
with fresh drug-containing medium at 37°C for 24 h. The DMSO concentration
remained constant under all conditions at 0.05%. The absorbance of each well
was determined by using a 96-well multiscanner. After subtracting background
absorption, the results were expressed as a percentage of viability relative to that
of control cultures that received no drug. Drug concentrations that inhibited cell
viability by 50% (IC50) were determined by using GraphPad Prism 8 software.
To evaluate the antiviral efficacy of these drugs, Calu-3 and Vero E6 cells
were plated in 48-well cell culture Petri dishes at a density of 5 × 104 cells/well.
Cells were inoculated with IAV (MOI of 1) for 1 h and rocked manually every 10
min to redistribute the inoculum. At 24 h post-infection (hpi), the cells were further
treated with the same 10-point dilutions of drugs as described above.
Supernatants were collected and processed by heat inactivation (10 min at 95°C)
or stored at -80°C until use. Then, viral RNA levels in the supernatant of infected
cells were quantified by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR),

representing the quantity of IAV replicated and secreted from cells44. A standard
curve of 1:5 dilutions of IAV PCR target fragments from 1.5 × 1010 to 7.5 × 105
copies/ml was used to quantify the viral RNA with specific primers (fwd,
CAAGCAGCAGAGGCCATGGA; rev, GACCAGCACTGGAGCTAGGA).
Additionally, the infected cells were harvested with TRIzol, and total cellular RNA
was extracted, reverse transcribed into cDNA and subjected to qPCR as
previously described45. mRNA levels of MX1, ISG15, IFNB1, ACE2 and the
housekeeping gene GAPDH were measured with specific primers (MX1: fwd,
GTTTCCGAAGTGGACATCGCA, rev, CTGCACAGGTTGTTCTCAGC; ISG15:
fwd, CGCAGATCACCCAGAAGATCG, rev, TTCGTCGCATTTGTCCACCA;
IFNB1: fwd, GCTTGGATTCCTACAAAGAAGCA, rev,
ATAGATGGTCAATGCGGCGTC; ACE2: fwd, ACAGTCCACACTTGCCCAAAT,
rev, TGAGAGCACTGAAGACCCATT; and GAPDH: fwd,
GGAGCGAGATCCCTCCAAAAT, rev, GGCTGTTGTCATACTTCTCATGG). Fold
changes were calculated by using the ΔΔCT method compared with untreated
noninfected cells. Three technical replicates were used for each sample.
RESULTS
Study design and analysis of single-cell data
Our study highlighted the identification of different therapeutic effects during
various disease courses by using publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing
data. With the high variability of the cellular compartments underlying disease
progression, our drug repurposing profiles from major cell subtypes included T,
B, NK, epithelial cells, and macrophages. A total of 9 scRNA-seq BALF samples,
including 3 healthy cases, 3 mild cases, and 3 severe cases, were collected from
publicly available scRNA-seq data (Supplemental Table S1). After quality
filtering, approximately 250,000 gene expression values from 43,914 cells were
obtained. The clustering analysis identified six major clusters of macrophages,
NK cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, B cells, and epithelial cells (Supplemental
Figure S1), which were determined based on the unique signature genes CD68
(macrophage cell), IL7R, CD4 (CD4+ T cell), CD8A (CD8+ T cell), MS4A1 (B

cells), and TPPP3 (epithelial cells), respectively (Supplemental Figure S2). We
then compared these six major clusters across the healthy, mild, and severe
COVID-19 cases and identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between
any of the two courses, as summarized in Supplemental Table S2. Briefly, the
mild-vs-healthy comparison (Supplemental Table S3) had 439 (CD8+ T cell) ~
1,639 (B cell) DEGs, while the severe-vs-healthy comparison (Supplemental
Table S4) had 255 (CD8+ T cell) ~ 1,127 (epithelial cell) and the severe-vs-mild
comparison (Supplemental Table S5) had 467 (CD8+ T cell) ~ 1,132
(macrophage cell).
An overview of drug repurposing via the LINCS database
Connecting to the LINCS database of small-molecule perturbations of gene
expression, we identified candidate drugs and compounds that can reverse the
upregulation and downregulation of these genes via the CLUE platform. The
closer the connectivity score (CS) is to -100, a score indicating a complete
reversal, the higher the chance of identification of drug-adverse effect
associations with upregulated or downregulated DEGs. In other words, drugs
may show a better response to reverse expression of DEGs upregulated or
downregulated in major cell subtypes in the BALF. A total of 281 candidates were
selected by CLUE with a CS lower than -90 based on DEGs among all three
comparisons between two courses (Supplemental Table S6). These candidates
include potential anticoronavirus agents, focusing on FDA-approved drugs and
experimental agents that have already been tested in clinical trials. To prioritize
known drugs for preclinical and clinical evaluation of the therapeutic effect of
SARS-CoV-2, we selected candidates shared by at least three cell types and in
ongoing COVID-19 clinical trials, as listed in Tables 1-3.
Repurposing analysis in mild COVID-19 patients
To search for candidates for mild cases, we ranked drugs and compounds
according to their CSs (Supplemental Table S7). A total of 133 candidate drugs
were found to be a potential candidate in at least one cell type among the mild-

vs-healthy group, and 53 of them were included in more than one cell subtype
(Figure 2A, Supplemental Table S8). The ten drugs identified in three or more
cell types included tubulin inhibitors (flubendazole, mebendazole, nocodazole,
and vincristine), DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (azacytidine), BCL inhibitor
(ABT-737), M5 modulator (VU-0365114-2), calcium channel blocker
(calmidazolium), apoptosis stimulant (kinetin-riboside), and opioid receptor
antagonist (JTC-801). Six additional drugs are currently undergoing COVID-19
clinical trials (Table 1), including the HIV protease inhibitor lopinavir/ritonavir46
combination (phase 4), glucocorticoid receptor agonist dexamethasone (phase
3/4)47, DNA replication inhibitor niclosamide (phase 2/3), antineoplastic agent
lenalidomide (phase 4), and calcineurin inhibitor tacrolimus (phase 3)48.
Repurposing analysis in severe COVID-19 patients
A total of 60 drugs were also found to have the potential to be effective in severe
cases compared to in controls (severe vs. healthy group) according to their
average CS between the replicates, and 25 of them were involved in more than
one cell subtype (Figure 2B, Supplemental Tables S9 & S10). As listed in Table
2, nine drugs presented in at least three separate cell types, including ABT-737
(BCL inhibitor), brefeldin-a (protein synthesis inhibitor), indirubin (CDK inhibitor),
TPCA-1 (IKK inhibitor), lopinavir (HIV protease inhibitor), GW-441756 (growth
factor receptor inhibitor), treprostinil (prostacyclin analog), tyrphostin-AG-1478
(EGFR inhibitor) and epoxycholesterol (LXR agonist). In this group,
lopinavir/ritonavir and hydrocortisone are ongoing in COVID-19 clinical trials.
Repurposing analysis in severe COVID-19 patients compared to mild patients
A total of 111 candidate drugs were identified in severe cases compared to mild
cases (severe-vs-mild group), 39 of which were involved in more than one cell
subtype (Figure 2C, Supplemental Tables S11 & S12). As listed in Table 3, nine
drugs (those for which drugs were selected in three separate cell types or more),
including fostamatinib (SYK inhibitor), VER-155008 (HSP inhibitor), KU-0063794
(MTOR inhibitor), PIK-90 (PI3K inhibitor), linsitinib (IGF-1 inhibitor), TAK-715

(p38 MAPK inhibitor), Y-27632 (Rho-associated kinase inhibitor), AZ-628 (RAF
inhibitor) and lestaurtinib (FLT3 inhibitor), were identified. In this group, except
lopinavir, we also assessed the 8 listed drugs in clinical trials for the treatment of
COVID-19 in Table 3, including the insulin sensitizer metformin (phase 3),
HMGCR inhibitor atorvastatin (phase 2/3), phosphodiesterase inhibitor sildenafil
(phase 3), calcium channel blocker verapamil (phase 2/3), phosphodiesterase
inhibitor sildenafil (phase 1/2/3), HMGCR inhibitor rosuvastatin (phase 3), CC
chemokine receptor antagonist maraviroc (phase 1/2), and dipeptidyl peptidase
inhibitor sitagliptin (phase 2/3).
Shared candidates based on all three comparisons
As shown in Figures 3A & 3B and Supplemental Table S6, lopinavir was the only
one identified in all three comparisons (mild vs healthy, severe vs healthy, and
severe vs mild), and interestingly, ritonavir was shared in the mild-vs-healthy and
severe-vs-healthy comparisons. There were 23 additional drugs identified in all
three comparisons, including SB-216763, ABT-737, JTE-907, brefeldin-a,
PKCbeta-inhibitor, indirubin, GW-441756, flubendazole, tyrphostin-AG-1478,
memantine, calyculin, kinetin-riboside, ascorbyl-palmitate, ON-01910, mirin,
verrucarin-a, emetine, TPCA-1, RHO-kinase-inhibitor-III[rockout], PD-158780 and
NVP-AUY922. For example, the glycogen synthase kinase (GSK) inhibitor SB216763 acts as a neuroprotectant49 and prevents cardiac ischemia50. JTE-907 is
a cannabinoid receptor inverse agonist that produces antiinflammatory effects51.
To further demonstrate the usefulness of the drug repurposing strategy,
we identified potential therapeutic drugs based on the transcriptional changes in
BALF of COVID-19 patients obtained by using bulk RNA-seq data40. Ten
candidate drugs were identified using the same analysis pipeline, two of which,
including the GSK inhibitor SB-216763 and PPAR receptor antagonist GW-6471,
were also included in the single cell-based candidate lists (Supplemental Table
S13).
Adverse drug reaction analysis

To prioritize the candidates for COVID-19 treatment, we characterized these
candidates’ known ADRs, which are a central consideration during drug
development52. We conducted a computational approach using the SEP-L1000
database to predict relationships between drugs and the emergence of ADRs
(Supplemental Tables S14 & S15). Figure 4 shows a heatmap of the top 50 drugADR associations for on-label (Figure 4A) and off-label (Figure 4B) ADRs.
Interestingly, the majority of the candidate drugs were shown with few ADRs.
Only lopinavir (associated with 7 off-label ADRs), ritonavir (13 off-label ADRs),
and memantine (unexpectedly, 44 on- and 8 off-label ADRs) were included in two
or more comparisons. In addition, for mild cases, mebendazole (6 off-label),
vincristine (31 on-label), dexamethasone (20 on-label and 37 off-label) and
lenalidomide (18 off-label) showed drug-associated ADRs; for severe cases,
there were two drugs, treprostinil (35 on- and 6 off-label) and valproic acid (44
on-label); and for comparison between mild and severe cases, metformin was
associated with 31 on- and 25 off-label ADRs, atorvastatin 32 off-label, sildenafil
44 on-label, verapamil 32 on- and 27 off-label and dasatinib 45 on- and 22 offlabel ADRs. These findings highlighted drug-ADR associations and may lead to
informed clinical decisions regarding treatments for COVID-19.
Potent antiviral activity of candidates against ssRNA viruses in cell culture
Two candidates, tyrphostin-AG-1478 (AG-1478) and brefeldin-a (BFA), were
selected as our top candidates and examined for potent activity against the
ssRNA virus influenza A virus (IAV; strain Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1)). IAV is a
negative-sense ssRNA virus with eight genomic segments of different lengths
(ranging from 0.89 to 2.3 kb). IAV was chosen because both SARS-CoV-2 and
IAV are contagious ssRNA viruses that cause respiratory tract infection. AG1478, an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor and a cancer
chemotherapy agent, inhibits hepatitis C virus and encephalomyocarditis virus in
cells53. BFA blocks the envelopment and egress of a mature viral particle by
inhibiting protein transfer from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cis-Golgi54. BFA
treatment inhibits the egress of both DNA viruses (herpes simplex virus)54 and

RNA viruses (Newcastle disease virus)54, the entry of human papillomavirus and
polyomavirus55, and the replication of mouse hepatitis coronavirus56 and human
immunodeficiency virus type 157.
We tested whether these two drugs reduce viral RNA levels in Calu-3 and
Vero E6 cells after infection with IAV by measuring IAV viral RNA levels in the
cell culture supernatant by RT-qPCR. Upon treatment, both AG-1478 and BFA
reduced IAV viral RNA levels dose dependently at 24 h post-infection (Figure 5A,
Supplemental Figure S3A-C). Neither compound caused significant cytotoxicity,
but BFA slightly reduced viability in Vero E6 cells at high concentrations.
Consistent with the reduction in viral replication, we observed that AG-1478
treatment elevated the mRNA levels of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs)
(ISG15 and MX1) and IFNβ in Calu-3 cells (Figure 5B). The cellular receptor
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a key mediator of SARS-CoV-2 host
cell entry58. We found that cellular mRNA levels of ACE2 increased in AG-1478treated Calu-3 cells. In contrast, BFA treatment significantly reduced the
expression of ACE2, MX1, ISG15, and IFNβ (Supplemental Figure S3D). These
results showed that AG-1478 and BFA exhibit a good antiviral effect on IAV,
which provided novel possibilities for further preclinical development research
and validated clinical therapeutic applications.
DISCUSSION
COVID-19 has spread rapidly worldwide; however, no proven vaccine or drug
has yet been developed. Various types of drugs, including antivirals, smallmolecule drugs, biologics, and vaccines4, 5, could potentially be used to control or
prevent emerging coronavirus disease. However, due to the lack of effective
therapeutic agents and long development cycles of vaccines, it is reasonable to
consider repurposing existing drugs and compounds for COVID-19 as an
alternative approach.
Both IAV and CoVs are common respiratory viruses. The flu season
occurs annually, and its symptoms are similar to the respiratory symptoms
caused by coronaviruses. In the United States, IAV has caused approximately

9.2 to 35.6 million illnesses with a mortality rate of 0.04%-0.83%59, while COVID19 has caused more than 8 million positive cases and 220,000 deaths, with
mortality rates of approximately 2.7%1. Although COVID-19 has higher morbidity
and mortality than IAV infections, plasma cells were increased significantly in
both COVID-19 and IAV-infected patients60. T cells and NK cells also were
activated in both types of patients, which may contribute to defense against the
viruses60. SARS-CoV-2 needs to be manipulated in BSL-3 conditions for
biosafety consideration, while certain IAV strains allow rapid assessment of
antiviral activity in vitro in a BSL-2 laboratory.
Our approach is different from previous methods33-36 for drug repurposing
for coronavirus, since it does not merely rapidly identify likely effective
therapeutic agents in preventing or treating COVID-19 but tries to filter specific
medications targeting immune reactions and specific modulators during the
patients’ disease courses. Furthermore, the scRNA-seq and transcriptome data
were derived from human COVID-19 patients at different disease states (mild vs
severe), and two independent publicly available datasets were used for this
study.
Several top-scoring drugs out of the 281 drugs we identified have already
shown antiviral potential and are even undergoing clinical trials. The tubulin
inhibitor flubendazole, widely used in treating intestinal parasites, is a potent
inducer of autophagy initiation and can block HIV transfer from dendritic cells to T
cells61. Azacytidine partially reversed aberrant DNA methylation. Azacytidine
combined with chemotherapy (fludarabine and cytarabine) in treating childhood
leukemia is in a phase 1 clinical trial, and azacytidine in conjunction with APR246 for myelodysplastic syndrome is in a phase 3 clinical trial62. The BCL
inhibitor ABT-737 exhibits potential proapoptotic and antineoplastic activities63, 64.
The protein synthesis inhibitor brefeldin-a has been widely used to inhibit the
entry of some viruses, such as human papillomavirus and polyomavirus65, and
egress of others, such as herpesviruses and paramyxoviruses66. Indirubin, an
active ingredient of the traditional Chinese medicine “Danggui Longhui Wan”, has
potent activity against myelocytic leukemia67 and therapeutic potential as an

antiviral agent against IAV68. The SYK inhibitor fostamatinib produced clinically
meaningful responses for adult persistent and chronic immune thrombocytopenia
in two parallel, phase 3 randomized trials69. Fostamatinib is now in a phase 2
COVID-19 trial owing to reducing the protein abundance of mucin-1, a biomarker
of acute lung injury and respiratory distress syndrome70. The HSP inhibitor VER155008 could regulate Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus lytic replication,
highlighting its potential as a novel antiviral agent71. The FLT3 inhibitor
lestaurtinib has secured orphan drug approval from the FDA for acute myeloid
leukemia72 and is in a phase 2 trial for advanced multiple myeloma and phase 1
trials for prostate cancer.
We also explored the underlying risk factors associated with some side
effects of the candidates. Understanding toxic on- and off-label ADRs linked to
drugs affecting vital organs can improve patient safety and reduce financial
costs73. Although the mechanisms of ADRs are complicated and not well
understood, SEP-L1000 provides insights into the connection between general
structural information and ADRs74. Notably, our candidate drugs did not show
many ADRs.
The selection and validation of AG-1478 and BFA were performed
because 1) both were shared in the drug repurposing analysis of mild and severe
COVID-19 patients; 2) both were expected to be effective in multiple immune cell
types (Figure 3B); 3) they can inhibit viruses according to recent reports53-57; and
4) no adverse side effects were found in our analyses. These two candidates
also showed robust antiviral activities against IAV in vitro in cell lines.
Interestingly, AG-1478 or BFA treatment enhanced or inhibited the expression of
IFNβ and ISGs, respectively. It is known that type I interferons (IFN-Is) and ISGs
confer antiviral activities to host cells. However, inappropriate IFN-Is and ISGs at
the wrong time results in excessive inflammation and tissue damage, especially
for severe or critical COVID-1975. Although ACE2 mediates the cell entry of
coronavirus, it also offers protection in acute lung injury against SARS-CoV-276.
Recombinant human ACE2 therapy to prevent S-protein interactions with
endogenous ACE2 is currently in a phase 2 clinical trial in Europe77. Thus, these

candidates have therapeutic potential for rational selection to target mild or
severe COVID-19 patients. Overall, our data serve as a basis for future
pharmacological studies in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 and will guide the
future development of therapies for the different severities of COVID-19 and
other viral respiratory infections.
This study may also possess several limitations. First, the public scRNAseq data had a small number of clinical samples (n=9) without detailed patient
information available, making comparisons between studies difficult and making
it impossible to dissect the patient’s clinical features with the particular cell typemediated immune responses. Second, IAV was chosen to test candidate drug
antiviral activity; however, although similar, the immune responses and gene
expression patterns during SARS-CoV-2 infection are not the same as those
during IAV infection. Future work on large-scale data mining and experimental
validation in COVID-19 models would help us better identify antiviral drugs.
CONCLUSIONS
The COVID-19 pandemic represents the greatest global public health crisis. To
date, no proven vaccines or therapies have been developed. We investigated
potentially repurposable candidates for the treatment of COVID-19 progression.
The findings can guide additional repurposing studies tailored to different stages
of disease progression.

FIGURE LEGENDS
Figure 1. Workflow of drug repurposing for treating different durations of
COVID-19. Publicly available scRNA-seq data and transcriptomic data of BALF
from COVID-19 patients were input against the LINCS database using the CLUE
platform. Candidates are selected that can reverse the expression of upregulated
DEGs upon drug treatment and were compared by connectivity score and the
number of major cell subtypes across healthy, mild, and severe groups. This
figure was created by modifying from Servier Medical Art (SMART) and
Vecteezy.com.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION
Supplementary Figure S1. UMAP presentation of a single-cell atlas of BALFs
showing 6 major cell types.
Supplementary Figure S2. The violin plot shows the expression of signature
genes (CD68, IL7R, CD4, CD8A, MS4A1, and TPPP3) from major cell types.
Supplementary Figure S3. The antiviral activities of tyrphostin-AG-1478 and
brefeldin-a against IAV in vitro. (A-C) Antiviral activity and dose-response
curves of tyrphostin-AG-1478 (AG-1478, 0 to 10 µM) and brefeldin-a (BFA, 0
to 10 µM) in Calu-3 cells (B) and Vero-E6 cells (A, C) infected with IAV PR8
(H1N1, MOI of 1) at 24 hpi. Cell viability is depicted in black. The IC50 was
calculated based on normalization to the control and fitted in GraphPad
Prism. (D) Bar plots showing mRNA levels of cellular ACE2, MX1, ISG15,
and IFNB1, calculated with ΔΔCT over noninfected Calu-3 cells. Calu-3 cells
were treated with BFA (0 to 10 µM) and infected with IAV (MOI of 1). Data
are represented as the mean ± SD with 3 technical replicates each.
Statistical significance was determined using one-way ANOVA. **P < 0.01,
****P < 0.0001.
Supplemental Table S1. Clinical data of the enrolled subjects (SARS-COV-2
confirmed).
Supplemental Table S2. The numbers of differentially expressed genes in
different cell types (clusters) among three group comparisons.
Supplemental Table S3. Differentially expressed genes between mild and
healthy samples in B cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, epithelial cells, NK
cells and macrophages.
Supplemental Table S4. Differentially expressed genes between severe and
healthy samples in B cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, epithelial cells, NK
cells and macrophages.
Supplemental Table S5. Differentially expressed genes between severe and
mild samples in B cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, epithelial cells, NK cells
and macrophages.

Supplemental Table S6. Full list of overlapping potential drugs among three
comparisons (mild vs healthy, severe vs healthy and severe vs mild).
Supplemental Table S7. Full list of potential drugs for treating COVID-19 based
on the LINCS database and DEGs between mild and healthy samples in B
cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, epithelial cells, NK cells and macrophages.
Connectivity scores were calculated from the CLUE platform.
Supplemental Table S8. Overlapping potential drugs based on DEGs among
different cell clusters between mild and healthy patients.
Supplemental Table S9. Full list of potential drugs for treating COVID-19 based
on the LINCS database and DEGs between severe and healthy samples in B
cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, epithelial cells, NK cells and macrophages.
Connectivity scores were calculated from the CLUE platform.
Supplemental Table S10. Overlapping potential drugs based on DEGs among
different cell clusters between severe and healthy patients.
Supplemental Table S11. Full list of potential drugs for treating COVID-19
based on the LINCS database and DEGs between severe and mild samples
in B cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, epithelial cells, NK cells and
macrophages. Connectivity scores were calculated from the CLUE platform.
Supplemental Table S12. Overlapping potential drugs based on DEGs among
different cell clusters between severe and mild patients.
Supplemental Table S13. A list of potential drugs for treating COVID-19 based
on DEGs from RNA-seq data between patient and healthy samples and the
LINCS database.
Supplemental Table S14. A complete list of on-label ADRs of all candidates.
On-label ADRs of drugs were downloaded from the Side Effect Resource
(SIDER). The ADR terms are mapped to Preferred Terms (PTs) coded in
MedDRA v16.0.
Supplemental Table S15. A complete list of off-label ADRs of all candidates.
Off-label ADRs were processed data from the postmarket ADR reports within
the FDA Adverse Event Report System (FAERS). The ADR terms are
mapped to Preferred Terms (PTs) coded in MedDRA v16.0.
