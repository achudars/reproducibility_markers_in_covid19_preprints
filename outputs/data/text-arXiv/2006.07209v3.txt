Abstract
Aims: Nonpharmaceutical interventions against the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Germany
included the cancellation of mass events (from March 8), closures of schools and child day
care facilities (from March 16) as well as a “lockdown” (from March 23). This study attempts
to assess the effectiveness of these interventions in terms of revealing their impact on
infections over time.
Methods: Dates of infections were estimated from official German case data by incorporating
the incubation period and an empirical reporting delay. Exponential growth models for
infections and reproduction numbers were estimated and investigated with respect to change
points in the time series.
Results: A significant decline of daily and cumulative infections as well as reproduction
numbers is found at March 8 (CI [7, 9]), March 10 (CI [9, 11] and March 3 (CI [2, 4]),
respectively. Further declines and stabilizations are found in the end of March. There is also
a change point in new infections at April 19 (CI [18, 20]), but daily infections still show a
negative growth. From March 19 (CI [18, 20]), the reproduction numbers fluctuate on a level
below one.
Conclusions: The decline of infections in early March 2020 can be attributed to relatively
small interventions and voluntary behavioural changes. Additional effects of later interventions
cannot be detected clearly. Liberalizations of measures did not induce a re-increase of
infections. Thus, the effectiveness of most German interventions remains questionable.
Moreover, assessing of interventions is impeded by the estimation of true infection dates and
the influence of test volume.

Background
Assessing the effectiveness of nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) in the SARS-CoV2/COVID-19 context is a topic of growing relevance. Nevertheless, findings documenting the
impact of these measures have not been homogeneous within the literature; whether with
respect to single countries [1-11], or in terms of international comparisons [12-17]. The
question of whether “lockdowns” – including contact bans, curfews or closures of schools and
child day care facilities – succeed or fail in reducing infections is a key concern for
policymakers, as such measures are accompanied by consequences in terms of economic,
social and psychological effects on societies. All European countries introduced NPIs to
reduce infections, ranging from appeals to voluntary behaviour changes and the cancellation
of mass events (Sweden) to strict curfews (e.g. France, Italy). Being one of the most affected
countries (in terms of confirmed prevalence), Germany introduced a strict strategy
incorporating three bundles of measures (1. cancellation of mass events after March 8, 2.
closure of schools and child day care facilities between March 16 and 18, and 3. a contact
ban, bans of gatherings and closures of “nonessential” services from March 23).
There have been some approaches to assessing the interventions in Germany: Dehning et al.
[1] utilized epidemiological models (the SIR [susceptible-infected-recovered] model and its
extensions) combined with Bayesian inference to find change points in infections over time
with respect to the aforementioned measures. They identified impacts of all three bundles of
interventions and on this basis have explicitly outlined the importance and necessity of the
contact ban for reducing new infections. In a series of studies [2-5], German economists
investigated structural breaks in time series of cumulated infections and growth rates. Their
inferred change points have been interpreted in a similar way, i.e., in support of the measures.
An additional modelling approach using a modified SIR model [4] also outlines the impact of
NPIs on infections.
The common denominator in the approaches mentioned above [1-5] is the application of
disease case data from the Johns Hopkins University (JHU). This data differs from the official
German case data provided by the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) in terms of both precision and
detail, with importantly, the latter dataset including information about the date of onset of
symptoms for most cases [18,19]. This information is essential because it helps to estimate
the true infection dates. In the aforementioned studies [1-5], information of this type was not
available, which has therefore required assumptions to be formulated regarding the time
between infection and reporting. The SIR modeling study [1] has already been criticized in
terms of its underestimation of this delay and the related results [20]. Moreover, studies
utilizing epidemiological models [1,4,6] require assumptions on the transmission process of
the disease (e.g., spreading rate, contacts per capita) or other unknown epidemiological
parameters. Both aspects raise the question whether the previous assessments of NPIs in
Germany are reliable.
Aims
The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of NPIs towards the SARS-CoV-2 spread
in Germany (from March 8, 16 and 23, respectively), while overcoming the data-related
problems mentioned above. The measures are analysed in terms of revealing their impact on
infections over time. By using official case data [19], true dates of infection are estimated.
Inspired by the methodical approach in previous studies [2-4,11], change points in time series
of three indicators (daily and cumulative infections as well as reproduction numbers, all of

which were calculated based on the estimated infection dates) were detected. The data covers
infections from February 15 to May 31, 2020, which means that also possible effects of the
easing of measures (from April 20) and the introduction of face masks (from April 27) can be
assessed.
Estimating the dates of infection
To assess the effectiveness of NPIs, it is the dates of infections of the reported cases which
must be regarded, rather than the date of report. However, the real time of infection is
unknown, thus, it must be estimated using the reported cases. In simple terms, the time
between infection and reporting consists of two time periods: a) the time between infection
and onset of symptoms (incubation period), and b) the time between onset of symptoms and
the date of report (reporting delay). Thus, to estimate the date of infection, both periods must
be subtracted from the date of report [1-5,8,11].
There are several estimations of the SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 incubation period, ranging from
median values of 5.0 to 6.4 days [21,22]. Incorporating the reporting delay, however, is much
more difficult. Previous studies investigating the effectiveness of interventions in Germany [15] have employed data from the Johns Hopkins University (JHU) which only includes daily
infection and death cases. The reporting delay is either assumed to be equal to 2-3 days [24] or estimated in the model parametrization [1,5]. In contrast, the data on German cases from
the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) includes the reporting date and, for the majority of cases, casespecific dates of onset of symptoms, socio-demographic information (age group, gender), and
the corresponding county [18,19]. The data used here is the RKI dataset from June 28, 2020
[19]. In this dataset, there were 193,467 reported infections, for which, the date of onset of
symptoms is known in 135,967 cases (70.28 %). The arithmetic mean of the time between
onset of symptoms and report (reporting delay) is equal to 6.71 days (SD = 6.19) and the
corresponding median equals 5 days. 95 % of the reporting delays lie between 0 (2.5 %
percentile) and 21 (97.5 percentile) days. On this basis, we clearly see that assuming this
value to be equal to 2-3 days [2-4] is an obvious underestimation. Moreover, exploring the
dataset reveals that the reporting delay varies between the age and gender groups of the
reported cases and over time, as well as between German counties. These differences
indicate that it is difficult to assume or estimate average values for the reporting delay [1,5].
Thus, the estimation of the true infection dates of reported cases was conducted using the
information from the RKI case data. In line with previous studies [1-5], the incubation period is
assumed to equal 5 days, which is the minimum value reported in the literature [21,22]. Given
this time period for the records in the case dataset with known date of onset of symptoms, the
date of infection of case i, DIi, is calculated as the date of onset of symptoms (DOi) subtracted
by the incubation period (IP):
𝐷𝐼𝑖 = 𝐷𝑂𝑖 − 𝐼𝑃

Based on the cases with full information, a dummy variable regression model was estimated
for the interpolation of the reporting delay for the remaining 57,500 cases. As the reporting
delay differs across case-specific attributes, the reporting delay for case i (RDi,agcwt) was
estimated by including dummy variables for age group a (a = 1, …, A), gender group g (g = 1,
…, G), county c (c = 1, …, C) and weekday w (w = 1, …, W) as well as the time trend t:

where α is the estimated constant, βa, γg, δc and ζw represent sets of empirically estimated

is the empirically estimated parameter for the time trend and εi,agcwt is the stochastic
disturbance term. The model parametrization was conducted via Ordinary Least Squares
(OLS) estimation.
In those cases lacking the information on onset of symptoms, the date of infection was
calculated as the date of report (DRi) subtracted by the estimated reporting delay and the
incubation period:
𝐷𝐼𝑖 = 𝐷𝑅𝑖 − 𝑅𝐷𝑖,𝑎𝑔𝑐𝑤𝑡 − 𝐼𝑃

Infection indicators and detection of change points over time
Previous studies with respect to the assessment of interventions have focused on only one
indicator such as daily infections [1], cumulative infections [2-5,8,11,15], or reproduction
numbers [7,17]. To arrive at a more holistic picture, three indicators are used: a) the daily new
infections, b) cumulative infections and c) the daily reproduction numbers. The estimated
infections dates (DIi) were summarized over days which results in the daily new infections at
time t (IDt) and the corresponding cumulative infections at time t (ICt). The reproduction number
for time t (Rt) was computed according to the calculation provided by the Robert Koch Institute
[18] as the quotient of infections in two succeeding 4-day intervals (implying a generation
period of 4 days):
Rt =

∑𝑡−3
𝐼𝑡𝐷
𝑡
𝐷
∑𝑡−7
𝑡−4 𝐼𝑡

The period under study includes the infections from February 15 (first proven “super spreading
event” in Germany, the “Kappensitzung” in Gangelt, North Rhine Westphalia) to May 31,
resulting in N = 107 daily observations. The final date is estimated by the last available date
of report (June 27) subtracted by the 97.5 % percentile of the incubation period (5.6 days) and
the 97.5 % percentile of the reporting delay (21 days).
For the analysis of infections over time, phenomenological models have the advantage that
they only incorporate time series of infections and do not require further assumptions
concerning the transmission process of the disease under study [23,24]. Thus, the time series
of all three indicators were analysed using exponential growth models in their semilog form,
which means that the dependent variables (IDt, ICt and Rt) were transformed via natural
logarithm. The model parametrization was conducted via Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)
estimation. The corresponding slope parameter of the independent variable (time), here
denoted as λ, represent the average growth rate per time unit (days) and λ*100 equals the
percentage change per day:
ln(𝐼𝑡𝐷 ) = 𝛼 𝐷 + 𝜆𝐷 𝑡 + 𝜇𝑡𝐷
ln(𝐼𝑡𝐶 ) = 𝛼 𝐶 + 𝜆𝐶 𝑡 + 𝜇𝑡𝐶
ln(𝑅𝑡 ) = 𝛼 𝑅 + 𝜆𝑅 𝑡 + 𝜇𝑡𝑅

where αD, αC, αR, λD, λC and λR are the parameters to be estimated and μDt, μCt and μRt represent
the stochastic disturbance term in each model.
The detection and dating of change points was conducted using a fluctuation test (recursive
estimation test) and F statistics, which incorporates comparing the regression coefficients of
a time series with M breakpoints (and, thus, M+1 segments) to the full sample estimates (no
segmentation). Within these tests, structural breaks in the time series can be identified. The
optimal number of breakpoints and their attribution to the specific observation at which point
they occur (which means a dating of the breakpoint, including the computation of confidence
intervals) was conducted using the Bai-Perron algorithm. The statistically optimal number of
M breakpoints is inferred by comparing model variants with zero to five breakpoints
(corresponding to one to six segments). The variant which minimizes the residual sum of
squares (RSS) and the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) is considered to be the optimal
solution [25,26]. Thus, the exponential growth functions shown above are divided into M+1
segments, in which the regression coefficients in each m segment (m = 1, …, M+1) are
constant. The analysis was conducted in R [27] using the package strucchange [26].
Results
Fig. 1 shows the daily reported cases in the RKI dataset, the corresponding daily onsets of
symptoms (incorporating the reporting delay) and the daily infections (incorporating the
reporting delay and the incubation period) from February 15 to May 31, 2020. Fig. 2 presents
the estimated infections and reported cases on the level of calendar weeks along with
additional information about the number of conducted SARS-CoV-2 tests [28]. Obviously, the
time series are not simply shifted by the average delay between infection and report. The
differences between the temporal development of infection and report curves can be attributed
to temporal, case-specific, and regional differences in the reporting delay. Furthermore, all
results emerging from time series of infections shown below have to be interpreted whilst
taking into consideration the changing number of tests conducted weekly. Specifically, we can
see an increase in the number of tests by a factor of 2.73 from calendar week 11 (127,457
tests) to 12 (348,619 tests), followed by smaller fluctuations in the succeeding weeks.
Fig. 3, 4 and 5 show the results of the time series analysis of daily infections, cumulative
infections, and reproduction numbers, respectively. The top-left plot shows the optimal
structural breaks in time series and the corresponding slopes (exponential growth rates) for
each model segment. The top-right plot displays the explained variance (R2) and the point
estimate confidence intervals for each model segment. The bottom-left plot presents the
corresponding model diagnostics (BIC and RSS) for the model variants with one to five
segments, and the adjacent plot shows the model fit on condition that no structural breaks
occur. With respect to daily infections (fig. 3), the best model fit minimizing BIC and RSS
incorporates three breakpoints and four model segments, respectively. Obviously, a model
without breakpoints does not fit the time series appropriately. The three significant structural
breaks are on March 8 (95 % confidence intervals: March 7 to March 9) and March 24 (CI [23,
25]) as well as April 19 (CI [18, 20]). The first break on March 8 reduces the growth rate from
0.229 (CI [0.217, 0.240]), which represents an average daily increase of 22.9 % (February 15
to March 8), to -0.013 (CI [-0.025, -0.001]), which means a daily decrease equal to 1.3 %
(March 9 to March 24). From March 25, the daily infections decrease by 5.4 % per day (-0.054,
CI [-0.057, -0.050]) until April 19. From April 20, the decline of new infections slows down but
the daily growth rate is still negative with -3.0 % (-0.030, CI [-0.033, -0.028]).

to 31 May 2020.

from calendar week 10 to 25.
The best model solution for the cumulative infections over time also incorporates three
breakpoints. The first break occurs on March 10 (CI [9, 11]), at which point the daily growth
rate was reduced from 22.8 % (0.228, CI [0.224, 0.232]) to 6.6 % (0.066, CI [0.059, 0.073]).
The second break on March 26 (CI [25, 27]) documents a further decrease in daily growth
from 6.8 % to 1.9 % (0.019, CI [0.017, 0.020]). The last structural change is detected on April
13 (CI [12, 14]), at which time the daily growth rate shifted from 1.9 % to 0.4 % (0.004, CI
[0.003, 0.004]).
With respect to the reproduction number (R), three structural breaks can also be identified.
After the first break on March 3 (CI [2, 4]), R starts to decrease by 9.7 % per day (-0.097, CI
[-0.107, -0.087]) until March 19 (CI [18, 20]). The break around March 19 initiates a
stabilization of the R value with a decrease equal to 0.7 % per day (-0.007, CI [-0,008, -0,005]).
From the last change point which occurs at April 23 (CI [22, 27]), the reproduction number still
fluctuates on a low level with a daily increase of 0.3 % (0.003, CI [0.000, 0.005]). With few
exceptions, from March 19, the daily reproduction number remains below one (ln R < 0).

All in all, we find concordant structural breaks for all three indicators in the first third of March
2020. Around March 8, the daily new infections turn from exponential growth to decay and the
growth rate of cumulative infections has its highest decrease. This decline occurs although
the test volume increased strongly in the succeeding weeks (see fig. 2). Unfortunately,
conducted tests cannot be linked to reported cases as both information stem from different
data sources. However, the massive increase of testing must have had an influence on the
detection of SARS-CoV-2 infections occurred before. It is therefore plausible to assume that
if test volume had remained constant over time, fewer infections would have been detected
and the decrease of (confirmed) infections would have been stronger. The other breakpoints
are not coincident: Whilst structural changes in the daily and cumulative infections occur in
the last third of March, there is no corresponding break with respect to reproduction numbers.
In the last third of April, we find structural changes with respect to daily infections and

reproduction numbers, but the growth rate of infections still remains negative. From March 19,
the reproduction numbers, with few exceptions, fluctuate on a level below one (ln R < 0).
Discussion
Regarding all three indicators, we find consistent results with respect to a significant decline
of infections in the first third of March – about one week before the closing of schools and child
day care and two weeks before the full “lockdown” (including the contact ban) came into force.
The effect coincides with the cancellation of mass events recommended by the German
minister of health, Spahn, on March 8. However, the increased awareness in the general
population could have also had a significant impact in terms of voluntary changes in daily
behaviour (e.g., physical distancing to strangers, careful coughing and sneezing, thorough
and frequent hand washing). Surveys demonstrate an increased awareness towards the
Corona threat already in the middle of February [29]. Additionally, voluntary cautious
behaviour in the Corona context could also explain the abrupt and unusual decline of other
infectious respiratory diseases in Germany starting in early March [30].
Previous studies have also found a first slowing of infections in the first third of march [1-5],
but the results of the present analysis contradict their findings as the change point in the 10th
calendar week is a) the clearest structural break given that it is present for all three indicators,
b) the break which initiated a trend change in terms of a decline of daily new infections and c)
the most influential break with respect to cumulative infections. Dehning et al. [1] state: “Our
results indicate that the full extent of interventions was necessary to stop exponential growth
[…] Only with the third intervention, the contact ban, we found that the epidemic changed from
growth to decay”. These statements are based on a negative growth rate (-3 %) having not
become apparent before the contact ban came into force. In contrast, given the estimated
infection dates in the present study, we see that the growth rates of new infections and
reproduction numbers already turn negative on March 3 and 8, respectively. At the same time,
the growth rate of the cumulative infections has its biggest decrease across all four segments
of the time series. Thus, a decline in infections occurred before school closures and the
contact ban came into force.
In the time series studies on the German case [2-5], the closing of infrastructures (schools
etc.) in mid-March was found to be the most influential break with respect to cumulative
infections. This conclusion cannot be confirmed in the present study, as we cannot find any
referring breakpoint with respect to the daily and cumulative infections. If the closures of
schools and child day care facilities would have had an impact on infections, there would have
been a significant decline of new infections from March 16 to 18 on. The structural break in
the reproduction numbers on March 19 initiates a stabilization of the reproduction numbers
but not a further decline. Therefore, an impact of school and child day care closures cannot
be detected. The influence of the third intervention (“lockdown” including contact ban), which
was found to be the most influent factor in the SIR modelling study [1], and an important factor
in the previous time series analyses [2-5], remains unclear in the present study as well. There
is no structural break in the reproduction numbers which coincides with the contact ban.
Significant breaks in daily and cumulative infections occur after the social ban came into force,
but not immediately. The mismatches between the present and previous results are obviously
related to different data sources, a point underscored by the fact that the modelling approach
is similar to some of the previous studies [2-4].

The impact of first liberalizations of measures from April 20 (e.g., reopening of some
“nonessential” retail shops) is plausibly reflected in the temporal development of new
infections and reproduction numbers. However, there is no re-increase of new infections as
the corresponding growth rate remains negative and the reproduction numbers remain, with
few exceptions, below the critical value of one. Moreover, no effect of the implementation of
compulsory face masks in retail shops and public transport (starting from April 27) can be
detected, as there is no further significant structural break. However, this intervention was
implemented at a time where infections were already on a low level. Thus, the effectiveness
of this measure cannot be definitely assessed. Further liberalizations starting in the first half
of May (e.g., reopening of schools for some age groups, extending emergency childcare) do
not show any impact as well.
The current findings support results for Germany inferred from logistic growth models which
show a trend change before the contact ban came into force [8]. In addition, a Spanish time
series study revealed breakpoints in cumulative infections, with the first occurring about two
weeks before the nationwide “lockdown” [11]. Furthermore, the present results tend to support
other studies of international comparisons which have found a decline of infections with or
without strict interventions [12-16].
Strengths and limitations
One strength of the present study is the relative simplicity of the analysis. The current
approach allows for a time-related analysis of NPIs based on a rather simple model which
does not require further assumptions concerning the disease under study. Thus, the
methodology can be easily transferred to other pandemics, countries, or regions as only time
series of infections are necessary. In the future, the research design should be applied to
international comparisons, incorporating both Scandinavian and South-European countries.
Another strength is the utilization of realistic infection dates, which was not incorporated in
previous studies. Moreover, regarding three different indicators allows for a more differentiated
picture of infections over time.
The temporal development of the three indicators was also contrasted with conducted tests
over time. However, in the absence of daily test data, the impact of changing test volumes
was not assessed directly. Another limitation results from the phenomenological nature of the
regression models utilized for time series analysis. As the only explanatory variable is time,
we can question the impacts of the regarded interventions but cannot explain the factors
causing the temporal development of infections directly.
Conclusions
This study finds clear evidence of a decline of SARS-CoV-2 infections in Germany at the
beginning of March 2020, which can be attributed to relatively small nonpharmaceutical
interventions (cancellation of mass events) and voluntary behavioral changes. A trend change
of infections from exponential growth to decay was not induced by the “lockdown” measures
but occurred earlier. Additional impacts of later NPIs cannot be clearly detected: Firstly, there
is no significant effect with respect to infections that could be attributed to school and day-care
closures. Secondly, effects which could be related to the contact ban a) do not appear with
respect to all three indicators, b) differ in strength and tend towards lower impacts, and c) do
not match the time the measure came into force. Thus, the necessity of the second (March
16-18) and the third bundle of interventions (March 23) is questionable because a) the related

effects on infections (if any) cannot be unequivocally validated, b) a trend change had already
occurred long before they came into force, and c) liberalizations of these measures did not
induce a re-increase of infections. We cannot deduce conclusions towards the necessity of
compulsory face masks, as this intervention was introduced late. Furthermore, the time series
of (confirmed) infections is substantially influenced by temporal changes in the test volume,
which leads to a high degree of uncertainty with respect to the data source. Therefore, a future
evaluation of NPIs towards SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 in Germany should consider these
questionable effects and uncertainties.
The study reveals three methodological issues for assessing the impact of NPIs which may
influence the results enormously. Firstly, the key challenge is the estimation of realistic
infections dates from official statistics (which typically do not include this information). This
information is essential for the assessment of measures which aim at the reduction of new
infections. It is particularly important to include a realistic and differentiated reporting delay.
An underestimation of the time between infection and reporting leads to the estimation of
infections to a later date than actually occurred in reality. As a consequence, trend changes
will also be dated too late, and thus, are attributed erroneously to specific interventions.
Secondly, it is important to incorporate several indicators for the pandemic spread. Daily and
cumulative infections as well as reproduction numbers, though based on the same initial data,
have different meanings. As the results of this study show, significant change points may be
found for some indicators but not for others. Thus, assessment of effectiveness of
nonpharmaceutical interventions depends on the indicator used which leads to the conclusion
that the temporal development of the indicators chosen should be carefully compared. And
lastly, quantitative investigations based on empirical case data implicitly assume constant test
volumes, which is obviously not true. In the German case, the number of conducted tests for
SARS-CoV-2 is not constant over time. An increase (or decrease) of tests may result in an
artificial increase (or decrease) of reported infections. Thus, increasing test capacity – which
is a key parameter in fighting a pandemic – may result in a statistical source of error when
analyzing pandemics over time. All these issues exist regardless of the chosen modeling
approach, which suggests a need to shift study design toward prioritizing the handling of data
sources rather than refining models.
