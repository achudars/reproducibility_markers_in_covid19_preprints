Abstract
We consider the task of discovering categories
of non-pharmaceutical interventions during the
evolving COVID-19 pandemic. We explore topic
modeling on two corpora with national and international scope. These models discover existing
categories when compared with human intervention labels while reduced human effort needed.

1. Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic has seen varying government responses in countries around the world. More than 2.24 million confirmed cases and 152.5 thousand deaths worldwide
(January 1, 2020 - April 19, 2020) (WHO, 2020) are attributed to novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). Due to the
high transmission rate, non-pharmaceutical interventions
(NPIs) play a critical role in stemming the spread of the
virus (Ferguson et al., 2020). Studies assess the effectiveness of interventions in ”flattening the curve” (Koo et al.,
2020; Tuite et al., 2020), using individual or compartmental models (Biswas et al., 2014) to simulate scenarios for
fixed parameters. Broad categories encompassing physical distancing, business closures, and travel restrictions, are
used and tailored to the specific country or region the model
focuses on (Wang et al., 2020). More specific interventions
are less likely to be tracked, leaving the effects of increased
funding, stratified closure, and administrative flexibility unestimated. Increasing the granularity of NPIs recorded is
limited by manual labor involved in intervention identification and evaluation. This is seen in the categorizations used
by four projects currently compiling data (McCoy et al.,
2020; HIT COVID, 2020; ACAPS, 2020; Hale et al., 2020)
which record 63, 23, 35, and 13 NPI types respectively.
In this study we leverage the availability of global text data
on intervention announcements to automate the task of intervention category discovery, which will speed up the identification of interventions with strong effects on transmission.

We propose a method for using topic modeling to discover
intervention categorizations. This method uses two wellknown topic modeling algorithms, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes (HDP),
combined with the unique structure of the NPI category discovery problem. We introduce evaluation methods for comparing unsupervised discovery models with existing intervention labels and demonstrate that our approach discovers known categories of NPIs as seen in the selected topics in Table 1. Our method has shown useful performance
on datasets with global scope, suggests that better categorizations can be learned by pooling knowledge across countries.

2. Datasets, Method, Results
2.1. Datasets
This paper uses two datasets: 1) the Oxford COVID19 Government Response Tracker v4.0 (Hale et al., 2020)
(DOXF ), which contains 13 intervention categories from
156 countries, and 2) CAN-NPI dataset (McCoy et al.,
2020) (DCAN ), which contains 63 intervention categories
found in Canada. The former provides notes for each
change to the status of an intervention citing public announcement texts, quotes, email interactions with public
health authorities, and links. In contrast, the latter provides
more standardized full-text articles for each intervention
tagged at the provincial, territorial, and municipal level in
a single country. The DCAN dataset also links all eligible
interventions from the Oxford intervention categories. For
consistency of results, the period of January 1, 2020 - April
19, 2020, is used for both of the datasets. Table 2 compares dataset size and composition. It is also essential that

international data is evenly sampled from across regions.
In DOXF , countries have similar distributions of average
note counts in Asia (31), Europe (28), Africa (29), and the
Americas (29).

2.2. Method

AND

T OPIC M ODELING

A corpus is constructed from each dataset. We preprocess
the documents in each dataset to remove default english
stopwords from NTLK (Bird et al., 2009) and geographic
words (eg. province or country names) from data labels.
Bigrams are constructed from word pairs that generally occur together (eg. public health) and are added as well.
We apply LDA (Blei, 2012) and HDP (Teh et al., 2004)
using gensim (Řehůřek & Sojka, 2010) to generate topics for each corpus. Topic coherence, Cv , is calculated
as a measure of topic interpretability using co-occurence
of words and cosine similarity between each top word and
the total of all top words (Röder et al., 2015; Syed & Spruit,
2017). LDA is run to generate a specific number of topics,
K, then coherence is calculated for each K. For LDA, the
maximum coherence is associated with the near-optimal
number of topics found from a corpus. HDP predetermines the number of topics and calculates a single coherence over all of them. The online nature of these algorithms
allows for topics that can be easily extended when more
data is gathered, helping researchers respond quickly in a
fast-moving pandemic.
2.2.2. S IMILARITY E VALUATION
We evaluate the suitability of a topic as an intervention category by comparing with existing labels from subject matter experts (SMEs). Mean cosine similarity (S) between
weighted topic occurrence per document (T ∈ [0, 1]D×T )
and label occurrence (L ∈ [0, 1]D×C ) for D documents, C
labels, and T topics is one metric. This is calculated as:
T
C
1 XX ⊤
(T L)i,j
CT i=1 j=1

A higher similarity shows that topics are similar in structure
to given labels. We evaluate individual label discovery by

assuming that each topic can correspond to at least one intervention category. To determine the coverage (Cov) we
select the topic with the highest similarity for each label
and count the number of distinct topics used to cover all
labels. Coverage ratio (Cov(%)) is found with Cov/C.
Coverage ratio combined with high similarity indicates the
discovery of label categories. Combining these metrics
enables model performance evaluation without additional
work by SMEs.
2.3. Results
We summarize the results of category discovery with topic
modeling on DCAN and DOXF datasets in Table 3 using
K ∈ {10, 25, 50, 100}. HDP leads to topics with significantly more coherence, while a clear tradeoff must be made
between overall similarity and coverage. Similarity drops
less precipitously as the number of topics increases when
using LDA as opposed to HDP. DOXF has a much smaller
number of categories, so there is a clear early convergence
in coverage. In practice, a higher number of topics will
be harder for humans to check for interventions but should
lead to coverage of existing categories and aid with discovery.

3. Conclusion and Future Work
In this paper, we briefly demonstrate LDA- and HDP-based
methods for NPI discovery on DCAN and DOXF . As our
results have verified, combining coherence, topic similarity, and coverage can provide provide intervention category

suggestions for experts to explore and find new NPIs leveraging national and international data. For future work, we
will explore prediction-focused supervised LDA and identification of NPIs in an online manner.
