Abstract
Recently in various theoretical works, path-breaking progress has been made in recovering the well-known Page Curve of an evaporating black hole with Quantum Extremal
Islands, proposed to solve the long-standing black hole information loss problem related
to the unitarity issue. Motivated by this concept, in this paper, we study cosmological circuit complexity in the presence (or absence) of Quantum Extremal Islands in negative (or
positive) Cosmological Constant with radiation in the background of Friedmann-LemaîtreRobertson-Walker (FLRW) space-time. Without using any explicit details of any gravity
model, we study the behaviour of the circuit complexity function with respect to the
dynamical cosmological solution for the scale factors for the above mentioned two situations in FLRW space-time. using squeezed state formalism. By establishing a relationship
among cosmological circuit complexity, Out-of-Time Ordered Correlators (OTOC) and entanglement entropy in the presence of Quantum Extremal Islands for the range of values
of Cosmological Constant which represent the chaotic parameter space. Last but not the
least, we also comment on the range of the values of Cosmological Constant that represent the non-chaotic regime for which we have studied various other underlying features
of circuit complexity function for the present cosmological paradigm.
Keywords: Quantum extremal surface, Cosmological Complexity, Cosmological Islands.

Prologue

In recent times, various outstanding quantum information theory concepts have been
extensively used to decode the enormous number of hidden secrets of a quantum theory
of gravity. Among all of these well known successful tools and techniques, in this paper,
we mainly concentrate on the underlying physics of circuit complexity [1]. The notion
of circuit complexity was first introduced in physics by Professor Leonard Susskind to
understand the mysteries of quantum aspects of black holes. It has been an important
and very successful probe in diagnosing certain interesting features underlying the system.
Before going into the details of this paper’s subject material, let us familiarize the readers
with the bigger picture to develop the strong background motivation of this paper.
The concept of quantum extremal islands [2, 3] has been a very successful theoretical
concept in reproducing the Page Curve for an evaporating black hole [4] from semi-classical
considerations, which has been recently studied in various remarkable works [2, 5–8]. This
program came into the picture to propose a possible solution to the long-standing famous Hawking Information Loss paradox [9–11]; related to the preserving unitarity in
evaporating black holes. A better understanding of Von-Neumann entropy was needed to
understand Hawking radiation. As a result, the idea of page curve remained incomplete
and led to many contradicting views. It was found that the consistent way of computing
the entropy involved an area of a surface that is not the horizon. It is the surface that
extremizes the generalized entropy, and hence the name arises Quantum Extremal Surface
(QES) in the associated literature. In refs. [2, 5, 6, 12], the authors explicitly showed that
using QES, one can systematically start from a pure quantum state black hole. During
the entire process of evaporation, a consistent definition of the fine-grained entropy can be
given. The curve displayed by this entropy shows that the expected Page curve is devoid
of any contradictions. Hence, the entropy computed, including QES was consistent with
the unitary evolution as expected from quantum mechanics. To successfully describe the
process, we need to add a bulk region in the QES after the Page transition time, which
aids in reproducing the Page curve. These bulk regions are known as Islands.
Over the years, many formulations for entanglement entropy came into the picture and
were applied in various cases [13–18]. However, the computation of this entanglement
entropy is not always very trivial. One can expect to find various underlying unexplored
features of entanglement entropy by studying complexity without going into the technical
details of computing the entanglement entropy from a given gravitational paradigm taking
motivation from Leonard Susskind’s path-breaking idea [19]. He explicitly showed the
rate of change of complexity [20–22] is equal to the product of entropy. The equilibrium
saturation temperature is given by [19] ¶ :
¶

Within the framework of Island FLRW Cosmology, the following simplified expression can represent

2

Complexity rate as generalised entropy :

dC
= ST
dt

,

(1.3)

Using this connecting relationship, we have explicitly shown that the cosmological circuit complexity is intimately related with the notion of Out-of-Time-Ordered Correlation
(OTOC) functions [23–27] which is generally used as a probe of quantum chaos [28]. Now
using the expression mentioned above for the rate of complexity, we have further established a functional relationship between the generalized entanglement entropy and the
quantum chaos for Cosmological Islands in FRW spacetime, which is given as follows ‖ :

Cosmological Island bound :



S
OTOC = exp(−c̄ exp(λa)) = exp(−C) ≥ exp −

(1.4)
where the equality holds for the maximal chaos inside the Island-inspired bulk region in
the FLRW cosmological background. Here the quantity, c̄ ∼ N −1/2 , where N represents
this relationship:

H(τ )

,

(1.1)

where the following expression defines the conformal time-dependent Hubble parameter:
H(τ ) =

1 da(τ )
.
a(τ ) dτ

(1.2)

We will provide the detailed derivation of this expression later in this paper as we proceed with the technical
developments on the paper’s subject material. For the solution of the Friedmann equations in terms of the
scale factor in the framework of Cosmological FLRW Islands, we consider two specific types of physically
important solutions, in AdS and dS background in the presence of radiation, respectively in the latter half
of the paper. We found that the AdS-radiation solution reproduce the Page Curve in Cosmological Island
prescription. On the other hand, dS-radiation cannot do so. However, both the solutions are consistent
with Quantum Chaos and Complexity descriptions in the present framework.
‖
This relationship between OTOC, Complexity and the entanglement entropy in presence of Quantum
Extremal Islands within the framework of FLRW Cosmology, particularly for the two solutions for the
scale factors are not universal. This simple connecting relationship is only true for a specific parameter
space in which we are interested in in this paper. We have not explicitly derived the expression for the four
point functions and related OTOC in this paper. However, the expression for the circuit complexity from
the present cosmological solutions can also be computed in the other parameter regions where the above
mentioned relationship between circuit complexity and OTOC not holds good, but still the connection
between the rate of change of the circuit complexity function with respect the scale factor and the Island
entropy holds perfectly. In this specific case instead of getting the desired initial exponential growth for
chaos and fall after certain value of scale factor (just like Page Curve) one would expect different types of
behaviour for the circuit complexity function depending on the various choices of the parameter space. To
differentiate both of these possibilities we will explicitly study and discuss the underlying features of all
of these possible types of behaviour of cosmological circuit complexity function with respect to the above
mentioned scale factors in the later half of the paper.

the number of degrees of freedom. Additionally, it is important to note that, the Quantum
Lyapunov Exponent, to describe the quantum description of the chaotic phenomena has to
satisfy the following constraint, commonly cited as the Maldacena Shenker Stanford (MSS)
bound in the associated literature, as given by [28] ∗∗ :
MSS bound :

β

where β =

1
in ~ = 1, c = 1, kB = 1 .(1.7)
T

Here β represents the inverse equilibrium temperature of the chaotic system during saturation of the OTOC at a large evolutionary scale. In this connection, here, it is essential to
note that recently in ref. [29], Tom Hartman and co-authors investigated the Cosmological
Islands and the conditions for them to appear in gravitational curved spacetime without
singularities. They showed that islands appear in the four-dimensional FLRW cosmology
with radiation and negative cosmological constant(cc). In contrast, in the positive cosmological constant case, islands are absent in the bulk region. We take a leaf from this
paper, and using the above relation between complexity and entropy as our primary guiding principle; we reinvestigate these two particularly well-known cases from the perspective
of quantum chaos. In this paper, we show that the complexity for four-dimensional FLRW
with radiation and negative cc (AdS case) exhibit Page curve behaviour is absent for the
positive cc (dS case). We also compute the entanglement entropy in regions where the
complexity is not related to the four-point correlation function. Here there is no connection between complexity and OTOC as such, but entanglement entropy can be calculated
using universal relation, and the entropy at this non-chaotic regime can be observed for
the models we choose.
The organization of the paper is as follows:
• In Sec. 2, we provide a brief review of the long-standing Black hole information loss
problem and various proposals given till date to solve it, focussing mainly on the
Island proposal as our prime motivation to study the cosmological extension of this
concept.

A brief review on Islands Paradigm

Black holes are thought to hold the key for quantum aspects of the gravitational
paradigm. It has kept everyone puzzled ever since its appearance in Einstein’s theory
of General Relativity. One of the biggest conundrums in quantum mechanics of black hole
physics, for half a century or so, has been the problem of unitarity or, in other words,
the Black Hole Information loss problem. Over the years, many proposals have tried to
solve this problem viz. Black Hole Complementarity principle [30, 31], Fuzzball paradigm
[32–39], and Firewall paradigm [40, 41].
2.1

Pedagogical details

In 2019, many renowned physicists came up with the path-breaking concept of tackling
the Black Hole information loss problem by introducing Islands [2, 3, 5, 6, 43–48]. They
proposed that the contribution to the black hole entropy came not only from inside the
horizon (bulk) region but also from the outside horizon region of the evaporating black hole.

5

Figure 2.1: Schematic diagram showing the entropy of the outgoing radiation of the
evaporating black hole as a function of physical evolutionary time scale. This schematic
diagram was taken from [42].
Considering the generalized quantum entanglement entropy that includes the contribution
from outside the black hole, the unitarity issue can be solved perfectly and consequently;
the black hole information loss paradox can be resolved.
It is important to mention here that, without the inclusion of the Island, the associated
entropy of the Hawking radiation increases monotonically with respect to the evolutionary
time scale. On the other hand, quantum mechanics demands that the final state of a black
hole should be a pure state, and the entanglement entropy should go to zero after a long
time. The Island proposal provides a quantum correction in the result for the Bekenstein
Hawking entropy, for an evaporating black hole. By considering the existence of the Island
region, it has been shown that after the Page time, the Island corrected entropy starts
to decrease to reach zero after a long time, which means there is no entanglement at the
very late time. Hence, the fundamental notion of unitarity of the black hole information
is restored, as shown in figure 2.1.

Technical details

Island formula generalizes the well known Ryu-Takayanagi formula used to quantify
the holographic entanglement entropy [13–18, 49–51]. Let us consider, R to be a nongravitational system which is entangled with a gravitational system. Then von Neumann
entropy of the region R is given by the following Island formula:
S(R) = min extI Sgen (I ∪ R) ,

Island formula :

(2.1)

where the generalized entropy is given by the following expression †† :

Generalized entropy :

Sgen (I ∪ R) =

Area(∂I)
+ Sm (I ∪ R) − Sdiv (∂I) . (2.2)
4

Here I is the region in the gravitational system known as Island, Sm (I ∪ R) is the
von Neumann entropy of the region (I ∪ R) and Sdiv (∂I) is the UV divergent entropy of
boundary of I i.e. ∂I. Region I is entangled with region R i.e. degrees of freedom of I
are encoded in R. It means that the operators in I can be rewritten as operators in R no
matter how complicated the form is.
Initial work on the Island prescription was done in the context of two dimensional
dilaton gravity [5, 43, 52–59]. The representative action for this system is given as follows:
Action in 1 + 1D :

1
S=
2

Z


√
d2 x −g φ R + K(φ)(∂φ)2 − 2V (φ)

,

(2.3)

where the dilaton dependent coupling K(φ) and the representative potential V (φ) are
defined by the following expressions:
Jackiw − Teitelboim (JT) gravity :
K(φ) = 0,

V (φ) = −λ2 ,

Callan − Giddings − Harvey − Strominger (CGHS) gravity :
1
V (φ) = −2λ2 .
K(φ) = 2 ,
φ

(2.4)

(2.5)

Recently in refs. [60, 61], the authors has shown the existence of Islands in higher dimensional space-time as well. Further in refs. [62–64], Professor Robert C. Myers and co. also
have studied quantum extremal Islands in arbitrary space-time dimensions. Such Islands

can exist even without the presence of black holes. In this D + 1 dimensional space-time
the representative Island action can be written as:
Action in D + 1 :

1
S=
2

Z


√
dD+1 x −g φ R + K(φ)(∂φ)2 − 2V (φ)

.

(2.6)

In this paper, we consider 3+1 dimensional spacetime model to study the circuit complexity
in FLRW Islands to have realistic cosmological implications since our observed universe
is 3 + 1 dimensional. Recently, Hartman and collaborators in ref. [29] has studied the
presence of such Islands in 3 + 1 dimensional FLRW space-time.
In 3 + 1 dimensional FLRW cosmological space-time the representative Island action
can be expressed as:
Action in 3 + 1 D (Jordan) :

1
SJ =
2

Z


dτ d3 x a4 (τ ) φ R + K(φ)(∂φ)2 − 2V (φ)

(2.7)
Now, to extract the underlying the physical insight from the above mentioned model, we
need to perform conformal transformation on the above mentioned action. This allows us
to express the Island action written in Jordan frame to the Einstein frame, which is given
by:
Action in 3 + 1 D (Einstein) :

1
SE =
2

Z

dτ d3 x a4 (τ )

n
o
R̃ + (∂ φ̃)2 − 2V (φ̃)
.

(2.8)
where in the newly defined Einstein frame the redefined field can be expressed in terms of
the old frame field content as:
Field in Jordan frame :

Z p
(2K(φ) + 3)
dφ
φ̃ =
φ

,

(2.9)

where we have throughout used the following conformal transformation in the metric:
Einstein to Jordan frame :

g̃µν = Ω2 (φ) gµν

where Ω2 (φ) := φ

. (2.10)

The above mentioned transformed action is in perfect form to analyse the cosmological
perturbation theory, as it is representing the simple Einstein gravity minimally coupled
to a canonical scalar field in the Einstein frame. This will further help us to study the
cosmological imprints from the above mentioned Island action expressed in FLRW spatially
flat (k = 0) background space-time. To avoid any confusion here it is important to note

8

.

that, for further computational purpose we will drop the ˜ symbol from our analysis which
actually distinguish the Einstein and Jordan frame explicitly.
The conditions for such Islands to appear in any gravitational spacetime and quantum
state are already discussed in greater detail in [29]. Below we summarize the conditions.
• Condition I :
Bekenstein area bound for entropy must be violated in the following way within
the Island prescription:
S̃m ≥

Area(∂I)
4

,

(2.11)

Here S̃m is the finite matter entropy after subtracting the UV divergences appearing
at the boundary.
• Condition II :
The region I can be treated as the quantum normal if the following criteria holds
good for the generalized entropy:

±

d
Sgen (I) ≥ 0
dλ±

,

(2.12)

d
is the null derivative (+ for outward, − for inward) with respect to Island
dλ±
region I.

where

• Condition III :
The region G can be treated as the quantum normal if the following criteria holds
good for the generalized entropy:

∓

d
Sgen (G) ≤ 0
dλ±

,

(2.13)

d
is the null derivative (+ for outward, − for inward) with respect to Island
dλ±
region I.

where

Usually, calculating entanglement entropy is not a very easy task. We want to bypass this cumbersome task in a comparatively easy way by considering the use of circuit

9

complexity within the framework of FLRW Cosmology. We do not do any computation
from the gravitational theories to calculate the entanglement entropy in the presence of
quantum extremal Islands. Instead of doing a complicated computation, we consider the
FLRW metric with radiation along with the negative (AdS) and positive (dS) signature
of the Cosmological Constant as our initial ingredient for the present computational purpose. To understand the effects of quantum mechanics, we must perturb the usual classical
FLRW metric in 3 + 1 dimensional spacetime, out of which we will consider only the scalar
modes in this paper. In this paper, we study cosmological circuit complexity from squeezed
state formalism for both positive (dS) and negative (AdS) cosmological constant with radiation and re-examine the Island paradigm in both cases from a cosmology-complexity
connecting point of view. We will explicitly show that cosmological circuit complexity for
the AdS case will be precisely consistent with the Island paradigm, which can produce the
Page curve and resolve the well known black hole information loss paradox without exactly
computing any gravitational entropy.

Circuit Complexity and its purposes

Complexity as a measure was first suggested by Susskind et al. [65, 66] and a series of
other papers to explain the increasing size of an ER bridge inside an eternal black hole
that connects two copies of the dual CFT. To describe the interior, we need a measure
of information that evolves for much longer times after the boundary CFT has reached
thermal equilibrium [65, 67]. One can think of complexity as the information about the
processes in a system. A system with more processes (thermodynamic, mechanical or energy dissipation) can be considered to be of higher complexity than a system with lesser
processes happening. A definition of circuit complexity can then be extended as the minimum number of processes that follow a path along a circuit between a reference state and
a target state. In the language of quantum mechanics, we can look at processes as unitary
gates and the reference and target quantum mechanical states can be chosen based on our
model. In [68, 69] Nielsen had shown the minimization of unitary gates of a circuit between
reference and target state is the minimization of geodesic length in circuit space. One can
start with a simple evolution of a reference state into the target state with some unitary
transformation U .
Target state from initial reference state :

|ΨT i = U |ΨR i ,

(3.1)

where the representative unitary operation for the circuit complexity can be represented

10

by n consecutive operations, as given by:

Unitary operator :

U=

n
Y

giα .

(3.2)

α=1

There is no unique choice in determining the circuit. We can work directly with the
wavefunctions [70] using Nielsen’s geometric approach, or we can use an alternative definition through Fubini-Study metric [71]. We adapt the approach given in [70] where they
work on a lattice of infinite harmonic oscillators and constructing the desired U using path
ordered exponential of Hamiltonian in the space of circuits parametrized by s.

Unitary as path ordering :


 Z s
←
−
0
0
ds H(s )
U (s) = P exp −i
.

(3.3)

0

←
−
P indicates a path ordering such that the Hamiltonian at the earlier times is applied to
the first state. U (s) represents a family of unitaries ranging from U (s = 0) - the identity
matrix to U (s = 1) which is the final unitary satisfying Eq. (3.1). The Hamiltonian H(s)
can be expanded in terms of generalized Pauli matrices as,
Hamiltonian :

H(s) =

X

Y I (s)MI ,

(3.4)

I

where MI represents the generalised Pauli matrices, and the coefficients Y I (s) are control
functions that tell which gate to act at a particular value of s. These functions specify
tangent to the trajectory in the space of unitaries and hence solve the Schrödinger equation
Path evolution of unitary operator :

dU (s)
= −iY (s)I MI U (s) .
ds

(3.5)

The idea then is to define a cost functional for all possible paths, and minimizing this will
give us the optimal circuit.
Z
Definition of cost functional :

D(U (s)) =

1

dt F (U (s), Y I (s)) ,

(3.6)

0

where F is a local cost functional depending on the position U (s) and velocity Y I (s).
This problem is now similar to minimizing action on a given Lagrangian - F (U (s), Y I (s)).
The cost function needs to satisfy certain properties for it to be physically reasonable. He
identified the problem of finding the optimal circuit with the problem of finding extremal

11

curves or geodesics in a Finsler geometry, with the cost functional acting as the Finsler
metric. Complexity is then identified with the length of the geodesic.
Among the many known, the most studied cost functionals are the linearly weighted
and the geodesically weighted cost functional and are defined as
X
Linear cost functional :
F1 :=
|Y I (s)|,
(3.7)
I

sX
F2 :=
(Y I (s))2 ,

Quadratic cost functional :

(3.8)

I

The purpose of computing complexity from two different types of cost functional will
enable us to comment on which cost functional is better for probing the underlying quantum
chaotic features of a system.
The final step will be to get explicit expressions for the velocity. In our particular case
working with squeezed vacuum state and unsqueezed vacuum state Sec. 5, we can write
2
the wave functions as Gaussian e−x . By suitably diagonalizing we can represent the wave
function in a general form:


1
ψ ≈ exp − xa Aab xb
2

General Wave Fuction :


.

(3.9)

Our reference and target states can then be specified in terms of the positive symmetric
matrices A. One can then find an expression of gates in their matrix forms that act on A
to produce the target state from the reference state. These gate action is defined by a set
of generators MI .
Gate Action :

Qab = exp[Mab ]

,

(3.10)

where MI are suitable generators decided by the Hamiltonian of the model. and  is
a parameter. We can then find explicit expressions for the velocity Y I (s) by rewriting
equation 3.5 in the following form:
Y I (s)MI = i(∂s U (s))U −1 (s)

.

(3.11)

Often the basis generators are simple enough to produce simple inner products seen in
many cases [70, 72, 73] given by
Inner Product :

Tr(MI MJT ) ≈ δIJ

12

.

(3.12)

With this one can get a straightforward equation of velocity.
Velocity :

Y I (s) = Tr(i(∂s U (s))U −1 (s)MIT )

.

(3.13)

Using this, we can write the velocity in terms of the Unitary operation that can be
identified from the diagonalized representation of the reference and target state derived
from the model’s Hamiltonian. We have done this using squeezed state formalism in
Cosmological perturbations in the following sections for our given model.
To give some motivation about the necessity of complexity in theoretical physics, we
review here some of the important aspects of complexity that has been used by many
people in this field:
• Motivation I:
The motivation to study circuit complexity in high energy physics arose when it
was applied to quantum field theory and gravity sector [70, 73–99], particularly from
attempts to apply AdS/CFT duality in certain black hole settings. Susskind et al.
in ref. [19] proposed ways of probing the interior regions of the black hole horizon.
They showed that these probes can be somehow related to a Quantum informationtheoretic measure, namely, ”Complexity”. Two famous conjectures came into the picture, which opened many new areas of research in the branch of theoretical physics
connecting condensed matter and high energy physics with quantum information
science being the heart. The two conjectures are famously known as the ”Complexity=Volume” and ”Complexity= Action” [1, 65, 66, 100].
• Motivation II:
Apart from its use in the gravity sector, the notion of circuit complexity has found
its application in various other areas. Having a close relationship with the Out of
time-ordered correlation functions (OTOC’s) circuit complexity has recently been
used as a diagnostic of quantum chaos and randomness [101, 102]. Complexity has
been found to provide many important details that are of utmost significance when
one speaks about a chaotic system. It can be used to predict the Lyapunov exponent
[103], scrambling time [104], equilibrium temperature, and many other important
properties of a chaotic system. Also in the non-chaotic regime where one cannot
connect the circuit complexity function with OTOC through a simple relationship,
the present analysis acts a significant theoretical probe to study the underlying various unknown physical properties of the system under consideration. We will show
later that instead of getting exponential growth, in the non-chaotic regime which
can be studied with very tiny values of the Cosmological Constant values we get

13

decreasing behaviour.
• Motivation III:
Recently people have tried to study and quantify chaos in different cosmological
frameworks using the notion of circuit complexity and OTOC’s [20–23, 105]. By
following the same research trend in this article we have studied the same issue for
the given model in detail. Though we have not restricted ourself to study only the
chaotic features, but also we have explored the other parameter space (tiny value
of the Cosmological Constants) where all the non-chaotic decreasing feature in the
circuit complexity function as well the Island entropy function can be observed with
respect the two possible solutions of the dynamical scale factors obtained for spatially flat FLRW cosmological background in presence of radiation and two possible
signatures of Cosmological Constant.

Cosmological models for Islands

In this section, we briefly discuss the cosmological models that we are considering in this
paper by following ref. [29]. We consider the solution of FLRW cosmology with radiation
along with the negative (AdS) and positive (dS) cosmological constant. The technical
details of these

It the context of cosmology literature, people generally use conformal time instead of
physical time. Hence, it is useful to convert the scale factors in conformal time which is
related to the physical time by the following relation

Quantum Complexity from squeezed quantum states
Squeezed states from perturbation FLRW cosmology

In this section, we will study squeezed state formalism within the framework of cosmological perturbation theory for FLRW spatially flat background. As already discussed
in the earlier section, we consider the Island action in the 3+1 dimension in the Einstein
frame given by
Z

1
SE =
dτ d3 x a4 (τ ) R + (∂φ)2 − 2V (φ)
(5.1)
2
We again remind the reader that in the above equation, we have deliberately removed the
tilde sign from the field variable for the sake of notational simplicity. It is to be noted
that the field variable φ in the above equation represents the redefined field in the Einstein
frame. We now consider the following perturbation in the scalar field:
φ(x, τ ) = φ(τ ) + δφ(x, τ )

(5.2)

and the whole dynamics can be expressed in terms of a gauge invariant description through
a variable given by:
ζ(x, τ ) = − 

H(τ )
 δφ(x, t).
dφ(τ )
dτ

(5.3)

We fix some gauge constraints that re-parametrizes space-time for the first order perturbation theory:
δφ(x, τ ) = 0, gij (x, τ ) = a2 (τ ) [(1 + 2ζ(x, τ )) δij + hij (x, τ )] , ∂i hij (x, τ ) = 0 = hii (x, τ ),
This gauge, conserves the curvature perturbation variable is outside the horizon.

(5.4)

We apply ADM formalism to compute the second-order perturbed action for scalar
modes. The action, after gauge fixing is:

(5.5)

To re-parametrize the second-order perturbed action, we introduce the following space-time
dependent variable:
v(x, τ ) = z(τ ) ζ(x, τ ),

p
where z(τ ) = a(τ ) (τ ),

(5.6)

which transforms the perturbed action to a familiar form of canonical scalar field. This is
known as the Mukhanov variable. Additionally, note that the newly defined quantity, (τ )
is the conformal time dependent slow-varying parameter:

We vary the second-order perturbed action with respect to the perturbed field variable in
the Fourier space, and we get:
vk00 (τ ) + ω 2 (k, τ )vk (τ ) = 0.

(5.13)

This is known as the Mukhanov-Sasaki equation and represents the classical equation of
motion of a parametric oscillator where the frequency of the oscillator is conformal time
dependent and in the present context of discussion, given by :
ω 2 (k, τ ) := k 2 + m2eff (τ ),

(5.14)

where we have introduced a conformal time dependent effective mass, quantified by:

The conformal time dependent mass parameter can be calculated for the two models considered in this paper as follows. In the Friedman equations the effective fluid in
the presence of radiation and a negative (AdS) / positive (dS) cosmological constant are
described by the following effective pressure and energy densities, which are given by:

Squeezed state formalism in Island Cosmology

Following [106, 107], we factorize the unitary evolution operator produced by the above
Hamiltonian U, as follows
U(τ, τ0 ) = Ŝ(rk (τ, τ0 ), φk (τ ))R̂(θk (τ )),

(5.55)

where R is the two mode rotation operator, defined as:
R̂(θk (τ )) = exp −iθk (τ ) âk â†k + â†−k â−k

(5.56)

and Ŝ is the two-mode squeezing operator, defined as:
Ŝ(rk (τ ), φk (τ )) = exp

!

rk (τ ) 
exp(−2iφk (τ ))âk â−k − exp(2iφk (τ ))â†−k â†k .

(5.57)

The time-dependent parameters, rk (τ ) and φk (τ ) describes the squeezing amplitude and
the squeezing angle respectively. The two-mode rotation operator, R̂, also produces an
irrelevant phase factor exp(iθk (τ )) while acted upon the initial quantum vacuum state
and can be safely ignored. The appearance of the squeezed quantum state can be realized through the interaction of the cosmological perturbation with the conformal timedependent scale factor. This leads to a conformal time-dependent frequency for the parametric oscillator, whose quantization is described in terms of the two-mode squeezed state
formalism as described in [106]. We choose the ground state of the free Hamiltonian as
the initial quantum mechanical state:
âk |0ik,−k = 0

∀ k,

(5.58)

which is basically a Poincare invariant vacuum state in the present context of discussion.
The action of the squeezed quantum operator Ŝ on the above initial vacuum state
produces a two-mode squeezed quantum vacuum state, as:
|Ψsq ik,−k = Ŝ(rk (τ ), φk (τ )) |0ik,−k

Time evolution in squeezed state formalism

We begin by expressing the creation and annihilation operators of the parametric oscillator in terms of the squeezed states and using the factorized form of the unitary operator
introduced in the previous subsection, the expression for the creation and annihilation
operator can be written at any arbitrary time scale as:
âk (τ ) = Û † (τ, τ0 ) âk Û(τ, τ0 )
= R̂† (θk (τ ))Ŝ † (rk (τ ), φk (τ )) âk R̂(θk (τ ))Ŝ(rk (τ ), φk (τ ))
= cosh rk (τ ) exp(−iθk (τ )) âk − sinh rk (τ ) exp(i(θk (τ ) + 2φk (τ ))) â†−k , (5.62)
â†−k (τ ) = Û † (τ, τ0 ) â†−k Û(τ, τ0 )
= R̂† (θk (τ ))Ŝ † (rk (τ ), φk (τ )) â†−k R̂(θk (τ ))Ŝ(rk (τ ), φk (τ ))
= cosh rk (τ ) exp(iθk (τ )) â†−k − sinh rk (τ ) exp(−i(θk (τ ) + 2φk (τ ))) âk . (5.63)
Consequently, the quantum operator associated with the cosmological perturbation field
variable for the scalar fluctuation and the its canonically conjugate momenta can be expressed as:
!
v̂k (τ ) = vk (τ0 ) âk (τ ) + â†−k (τ )

Quantum complexity from squeezed quantum states in Island cosmology

To compute the complexity from squeezed formalism we use the wave function formalism

28

of computing circuit complexity developed by [70] and used extensively in [21, 22, 74]. We
fix a reference state |0ik,−k , commonly used in cosmological perturbations. The squeezed
two-mode vacuum state |Ψsq ik,−k becomes the target state.
The reference two-mode vacuum state wave function is given by:
âk |0ik,−k = 0 ∀ k

Connecting Complexity with Quantum extremal Island entropy in
FRW spacetime

Prof Leonard Susskind introduced the concept of complexity in an attempt to solve
black hole puzzles. It was based on the observation that the spatial volume of the Einstein
Rosen bridge keeps on growing forever, whereas the entropy attains saturation in a quick
time in the AdS black hole. A correspondence exists in black hole physics and quantum
circuit physics; the black hole entropy S corresponds to the number of qubits (Let us say
K) in the quantum circuit, and Rindler time t corresponds to clock time of quantum circuit
[19]. Using this correspondence, the following relationship for complexity with entropy can
be derived.

task and involves many technicalities. However, a closer look at the above equation and
doing certain manipulations, it can be shown that the above relation can be expressed in
terms of the scale factor (which gives us all the relevant information about the space-time
we are dealing with) in the context of Cosmology. Keeping this in mind, we write equation

For maximal chaos we further get:

Sgen = 2πC = −2π log(OTOC) ⇒ OTOC = exp(−C) = exp(−Sgen /2π)

(6.11)

From the above calculation, it is easy to see that there exists a relationship between
complexity and entropy. We will explicitly examine this in the following section, where we
consider four-dimensional FLRW cosmology with radiation and positive/negative cosmological constant. However it is important to note that, this relationship between OTOC,
Complexity and the entanglement entropy in presence of Quantum Extremal Islands within
the framework of FLRW Cosmology, particularly for the two solutions for the scale factors
are not universal. This simple connecting relationship is only true for a specific parameter space, for Cosmological Constant 10−2 ≤ Λ ≤ 10−10 in which we are interested in in
this paper. However, the expression for the circuit complexity from the present cosmological solutions can also be computed in the other parameter regions where the above
mentioned relationship between circuit complexity and OTOC not holds good, but still
the connection between the rate of change of the circuit complexity function with respect
the scale factor and the Island entropy holds perfectly. We found that in the region region,
10−20 ≤ Λ ≤ 10−80 we get decreasing behaviour in the circuit complexity function and its
associated Island entropy function with respect to the variation in the scale factor in the
present context. These statements will be more clear once we show the plots and interpret
them in the next section elaborately.

Numerical study with Cosmological Islands

Our objective is to numerically solve the time evolution differential equations satisfied
by the squeezed state parameters in this section. We have used the scale factor as the
dynamical variable instead of the conformal time, making our computation physically
justifiable. This change in the variable is commonly known as field redefinition. Once we
solve the differential equations, it will enable us to compute the circuit complexity between
two reference states within the framework of cosmological perturbation theory. The effects
of quantum fluctuations are treated in terms of squeezed states. We numerically plot

32

the complexities calculated from two different cost functionals for both the models of the
cosmological scale factors. Using the logic given in [20], we write the expression for the
complexity in the exponentially increasing region as
Ci (a) ≈ ci exp(λi a)a=aexp

∀ i = 1, 2

(7.1)

It is to be noted that the above equation is valid only for the exponentially rising region;
hence the subscript aexp has been used, which we indeed observe for both the measures
of complexity in both the models. The index ”i” in the above equation indicates which
measure of complexity is being used. The slopes and the amplitudes are written with
index i to indicate that they are different for different models. Mathematically, this can
be represented as

λi =

d ln Ci (a)
da


∀

i = 1, 2,

(7.2)

One can also conjecture a similar relation between OTOC and complexity for the
exponentially rising region keeping in mind that complexity and OTOC are related by
C = −ln(OT OC). Hence for the exponentially rising region, the out-of-time ordered
correlation function can be written as
OTOC ≈ exp(−c exp(λa))

(7.3)

In reference [20], the authors identified the slope λ as the quantum Lyapunov exponent
which captures the effect of chaos in the quantum regime and showed the existence of a
universal relation between the different measures of complexity. It is represented as
C = − ln (OTOC) ≈ Ci ∀ i = 1, 2

(7.4)

The above universal relation between the complexities can be translated to the Lyapunov
exponent through the MSS bound. Thus,
λi - λ ≤

2π
∀ i = 1, 2
β

(7.5)

This relation can further be used to estimate the lower bound on the equilibrium tem-

perature, which can be done using the following relation

For our purpose, we have numerically estimated the values of the Lyapunov exponents
for the both the models of scale factors using the following relation
λi =

ln Ci (apeak ) − ln Ci (arise )
apeak − arise

(7.7)

The use of the above relation simplifies our task and prevents the complications of implementing numerical differentiation. Furthermore, using the relation between the circuit
complexity and entanglement entropy, we numerically plotted the entropy with respect to
the scale factor.

complexity and OTOC cannot be connected.
• In Fig. 7.9 and Fig. 7.10 we have plotted complexity measures in the non-chaotic
region. Here the connecting relationship does not hold. We see that the graph
increases and appears to saturate at a given value.
• In Fig. 7.11 and Fig. 7.12, we have plotted the behaviour of the entanglement entropy
calculated from the complexity measures C1 and C2 in the non-chaotic region, where
the connecting relationship between circuit complexity, OTOC and entanglement
entropy does not hold. The overall behaviour of the entropy in this regime calculated
from the different complexity measures has an identical behaviour. We observe an
initial decrease in the value of the entanglement entropy, followed by two dips. At
large scale factor, the decreasing behavior is again observed. Thus we conclude that,
only for a certain parameter space i.e high values of Cosmological constants, the
connecting relationship between circuit complexity, OTOC and entanglement entropy
holds good, and we get a resemblance with the page curve in the entanglement
entropy plot. However, for very low value of Cosmological Constant, the parameter
space is unsuitable and the connecting relationship does not hold. The entanglement
entropy shows a random decreasing behavior and has no resemblance with the page
curve.

factor, so we start observing deviations from the linear graph. Moreover, in Fig. 7.14, we see
an initial rise, followed by saturation and then a sharp upward deviation at particular values
of the scale factor. We expect complexity measures also to experience similar deviation
near particular values of the scale factor.

Figure 7.18: Predicted OTOC from geodesically weighted cost functional plotted against
scale factor
• In Fig. 7.15 and Fig. 7.16 the behaviour of the circuit complexity computed from
the linearly weighted and geodesically weighted cost functional is shown with respect
to the scale factor. Although the overall behaviour of the complexity measures is
identical, some noticeable differences are mentioned below:

44

– The complexity measure C1 (linearly weighted measure) is larger than C2 for the
entire range of scale factor.
– The peak in C1 is a non-uniform double peak, whereas for C2 this becomes a
more uniform and smooth peak at the top.
– The initial rise in C1 is more linear when compared to the initial rising part of
C2 . We also observe the rise begins a little later in the case for C2 .
• The general trend that we observe for the family of complexity values is that it
initially rises, reaches a peak and then falls. The most peculiar difference is the
deviation at particular values of scale factor for each cosmological constant. Although
the overall trend resembles a page curve, one can not associate a page curve
with the sinh model, due to the deviation at the cut off value. The values become
unsolvable, signifying a blow-up or erratic behaviour after a point. Hence it is not
a smooth page curve, although the initial trend resembles the Page Curve. This
further confirms the absence of islands in this model.
• Fig. 7.17 and Fig. 7.18 shows the plots of Out-of-Time-Ordered correlation functions.
Up to a certain value of scale factor, the OTOC decreases exponentially. However,
after a certain transition scale factor, it starts increasing exponentially. Here too,
we observe the deviations of the curve after a given value of scale factor for a chosen
value of the cosmological constant.

differences in the values in the 3rd or 4th decimal places as we go to smaller values of the
cosmological constant.

only after a few decimal places, and they are only significant in smaller values of the
cosmological constant and higher cost functional family. This shows a higher sensitivity in
smaller cosmological constant and higher-order cost functional.

Figure 7.24: Entanglement entropy computed from C2 plotted against scale factor in the
non-chaotic region.
• In Fig. 7.19 and Fig. 7.20, we have plotted the behaviour of the entanglement entropy
for the regime where Eq. (1.4) holds good. We again observe, that though the
initial increasing region may show similarities, with the page curve, the decreasing
region after the transition point ends at arbitrary scales, indicating a non-uniform

48

behaviour. Thus one cannot attribute the page curve like behaviour for this case
where islands are absent.
• In Fig. 7.21 and Fig. 7.22 we have plotted the complexity measurement for the NonChaotic region. This determines the behaviour of the entropy in the region. As we
can see the values is decreasing with slight convexity.
• The behaviour of the entanglement entropy in the non-chaotic region, where the
relation between complexity and OTOC does not hold, has been plotted in Fig. 7.23
and Fig. 7.24. Interestingly, the behaviour in the non-chaotic region for both the AdS
and the dS case, i.e with and without islands show similar decreasing behaviour. Thus
one can say, in the non-chaotic regime, it is difficult to comment on the contribution
of islands atleast from the perspective of circuit complexity.

Conclusion and Prospects
From our study of cosmological Islands, we have the following final remarks:
• Remark I:
The notion of circuit complexity and OTOC has a deep connection with entanglement
entropy. For maximal chaos, a closed relation can be established explicitly between
them, as given in the paper. Thus without going into the computational details of
the entanglement entropy from the gravitational point of view, one can comment on
this issue just by knowing the circuit complexity within the framework of spatially
flat FLRW cosmology in the presence of quantum extremal Islands, having AdS with
radiation and dS with radiation.
• Remark II:
Using the established relation between complexity and quantum entanglement entropy as the guiding principle, it has been shown that with the introduction of Quan-

50

tum extremal islands in FLRW cosmology, the complexity plots resembles the Page
Curve for the case AdS with radiation.
• Remark III:
It can be noted that at the transition point, the scale factor is only dependent on
the model parameter values and independent of the cost functional used to calculate
the complexity measure.
• Remark V:
The Quantum Lyapunov exponent and equilibrium temperature calculated from different complexity measures satisfy the universality relation established in ref. [20].
• Remark VII:
In the Sine hyperbolic model (without islands), one can see the initial portion of
the complexity curve resembling a Page curve. However, due to the deviation at
different cut-off values of the scale factor, we cannot associate a page scale to this
model during the decreasing part.
• Remark VIII:
In the case without Islands, the Lyapunov exponent (and the equilibrium Temperature) show very slight deviation due to the initial rising period being nearly the
same.
• Remark IX:
We have seen the entropy in the non-chaotic region decreases in a similar manner for
both the cases of Islands and No Islands.
Some of the prospects can be in the following direction:
• Prospect I:
As discussed earlier, apart from the quantum extremal surface or Island prescription,
other proposals have also been suggested to solve the black hole information paradox.
However, none of them has been studied using the notion of circuit complexity and
OTOC. A very intuitive study will be to try and predict the entanglement entropy
from the computation of circuit complexity for the other proposals. One can then
comment on the best proposal for reproducing the page curve from the perspective
of Circuit complexity and OTOC.
• Prospect II:
It is a well-known fact that black holes are highly chaotic systems. One can then ask
the question from the perspective of black hole chaos about which one is a better
proposal in reproducing the page curve and revealing the chaotic features of black
holes. This question can be addressed from the study of circuit complexity and
OTOC, which are the most relevant probes of quantum chaos.

51

• Prospect III:
An extension of the present work can be done for the primordial gravitational waves,
requiring the inclusion of the tensor mode fluctuations generated from cosmological
perturbations in the spatially flat FLRW background rather than the scalar modes
considered in this case. It would be an interesting study as to how the two-mode
squeezed state formalism brings about the phenomenon of chaos and complexity in
primordial gravitational waves.
• Prospect IV:
A model-independent notion of circuit complexity can be given from the perspective
of Effective Field theory, where one starts from a single EFT action and derives
all models under various constraints satisfied by the action’s parameters. Squeezed
state formalism for such a universal action can be developed to generalize an give a
model-independent prescription of complexity.
• Prospect V:
Recently there has been a study of the Islands contribution in the Entanglement negativity [108]. This motivates us to rethink various entanglement-related phenomena
studied in [109–112] and whether those aspects can be studied from the perspective
of Islands.
• Prospect VI:
Recently, there have been many studies in the field of Open Quantum Systems (OQS)
[113–115]. It is natural to expect that an OQS will exhibit chaotic behaviour due to
its constant interaction with its immediate surroundings. One can utilize the concept
of circuit complexity and OTOC to probe the chaos shown by an OQS.

Horizon constraints on the FLRW cosmological Islands

In Sec. 5.4 we have imposed the constraint kτ0 = −1. It is important to note what
constraint this places on the scale factor, when we consider the Cosmological Horizon for
Islands. The cosmological Horizon is given by
DH :=

Dispersion relation in Cosmological Islands

In this appendix, our prime objective is to derive the expression for the dispersion
relation in terms of the squeezed parameter rk (τ ) and the squeezed angle φk (τ ), where the
dispersion relation appears in the Hamiltonian after quantization that we studied in the
paper explicitly.
Let us first write down the expression for the conformal time dependent dispersion
relation Ωk in terms of the canonical field variable and its associated canonically conjugate
momentum that appears after performing the cosmological perturbation theory for a single
scalar field:
(

(
=

!)

|πk (τ )|2 + k 2 |vk (τ )|2 + λk (τ ) πk∗ (τ )vk (τ ) + vk∗ (τ )πk (τ )

,

Now, we plug in the expressions for πk (τ ) and vk (τ ), which are reproduced here for
convenience :
!
vk (τ ) = vk (τ0 ) cosh rk (τ ) exp(iθk (τ )) − sinh rk (τ ) exp(i(θk (τ ) + 2φk (τ ))) ,

(B.1)

!
πk (τ ) = πk (τ0 ) cosh rk (τ ) exp(iθk (τ )) + sinh rk (τ ) exp(i(θk (τ ) + 2φk (τ ))) ,

(B.2)

and after doing algebraic manipulation we get the following result:
!
Ωk (τ ) =

|πk (τ0 )|2 + k 2 |vk (τ0 )|2

!
cosh2 rk (τ ) + sinh2 rk (τ )

Here we have chosen the initial condition at the time scale τ = τ0 by considering, −kτ0 =

conjugate momentum obtained for scalar fluctuation. We finally get:

which is basically dependent on the co-moving wave number and the time dependent

∆AdS (a) and ∆dS (a) are appearing as a correction terms due to its smallness the by applying
