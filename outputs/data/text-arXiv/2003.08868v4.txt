Abstract: Here, we focus on the data analysis of the growth of epidemic spread of
Covid-19 in countries where different policies of containment were activated. It is known
that the growth of pandemic spread at its threshold is exponential, but it is not known how to
quantify the success of different containment policies. We identify that a successful
approach gives an arrested phase regime following the Ostwald growth, where, over the
course of time, one phase transforms into another metastable phase with a similar free
energy as observed in oxygen interstitial diffusion in quantum complex matter and in
crystallization of proteins. We introduce the s factor which provides a quantitative measure
of the efficiency and speed of the adopted containment policy, which is very helpful not only
to monitor the Covid-19 pandemic spread but also for other countries to choose the best
containment policy. The results show that a policy based on joint confinement, targeted
tests, and tracking positive cases is the most rapid pandemic containment policy; in fact,
we found values of 9, 5, and 31 for the success s factor for China, South Korea, and Italy,
respectively, where the lowest s factor indicates the best containment policy.

1. Introduction
While theories on epidemic spread in complex systems were developed in the
last few years [1–6], the rapid Covid-19 epidemic spread in the strongly
interconnected human world community in 2019 and 2020 provides an
extraordinary challenge for the science of complex systems. Many researchers all
around the world are currently engaged in the quantitative determination of the
Covid-19 pandemic spread in almost all countries [7,8]. Open-source data provided
by official health agencies are the essential tool for the scientific community to
understand the type of diffusion process and determine the mathematical laws of

A. Bianconi et al Condens. Matter 2020, 5, 23; doi:10.3390/condmat5020023 arXiv:2003.08868

the diffusion of the virus. Fortunately, few countries, e.g., China, South Korea, Italy,
Singapore, and others provided verified data and chose the policy of transparency
and containment of contagion through isolation of the population and other
restrictive measures on the movement of people. Our data analysis of the pandemic
growth curves was carried over about 28 days from the onset t0 where the
exponential growth rate characterized by the doubling time, called Td , assumes the
value Td0 of about two days in the three different countries.
2. Results and Discussions
Considering the large database now available, it is possible to analyze the
dynamics of the epidemic spread in different countries. The evolution of the
epidemic spread shows the universality of the complex growth curves, pointing to
the occurrence of multiple phases with transitions in a time-evolving process out of
equilibrium. The first phase is the “pre-threshold phase” (PTP), showing random
scattered events. This phase is characterized by a limited number of infected people
which could cover very different laps of time in different sites depending on the
local space topology, human density, public transport, social habits, and frequency
of face-face interactions at short distance.

Figure 1. Number of contagion cases present in one day of 2020 in China (blue), South
Korea (orange), and Italy (green). The curve of each country is characterized by the day t0
where the transition of the system from the “below threshold” regime to the exponential
regime characteristic of the pandemic spread which is indicated by a straight line in the
semi-log plot in panel (a). At each time ti, we extracted the time-dependent doubling time
Tdi by fitting the data over a five-day period centered at the selected time ti as indicated by
the red line in panel (a). The efficiency of the containment policy is indicated by the
curvature of experimental curves. The curvature of the growth curves changes with time.
Panel (b) shows the three growth curves in a semi-log scale in a common time scale using t0
shown in panel (a) for each country as the starting time. The counts of the Italy and China
cases are multiplied by 1.5 to overlap all curves in the near-threshold phase (NTP). The
growth curve for pandemic spread in Italy is fitted with a stretched exponential. Panel (c)
shows the growth curves in China and South Korea which show the arrested Oswald
growth in the log–log scale after a time t*, which is typical of the arrested or frustrated
growth in a complex potential landscape.

In Figure 1, we report the number of positive Covid-19 cases after the critical
time t0 for the onset of epidemic spread. The data show the growth regime in the
second, third and fourth phases. The second phase starts on a day t0 where the
growth for t > t0 shows the typical exponential law of the pandemic spread. This
behavior is similar in the three countries considered and it is characterized by a
doubling time Td0 of about two days (1.5 < Td < 2). If the process remains free,
without introducing containment measures, the number of people infected would,
therefore, double in less than three days. Under these conditions, about 10 million
people would be infected in a three-week period as indicated by the straight lines in
Figure 1a. Figure 1b shows the three different curves on the same time scale using t0
of each curve as a zero time for the explosion of the epidemic spread.
The pandemic control policies put in place by Italy, China, and South Korea
managed to modify the exponential growth. In the third regime, the
“near-threshold phase” (NTP), common in all curves, is where the starting
exponential regime shows a deceleration of the exponential growth. In the NTP
regime, the growth curves show an exponential behavior with an increasing
doubling time. The growth process of the Covid-19 in the near-threshold phase
(NTP) of the containment measures was found in the Italian growth curve over a
large time range shown in Figure 1b. We show that it does not follow the standard
logistic curve or the Kolmogorov law, but a stretching exponential.
The fourth phase, called Ostwald phase (OP), can be identified in the log–log
plot of data in Figure 1c where the growth curve of South Korea (China) is fitted
from t* = 5.58 d to 30 d (from t* = 16.62 d to 60 d) after the threshold by using the
formula of the Ostwald growth rate.

The fit by the Ostwald formula (Equation (1)) of both curves of China and South
Korea pandemic growth in Figure 1c in the arrested Ostwald phase (OP) show the
same half time t = 6.7 d.
The South Korea and China growth curve were fitted by the Ostwald growth
formula (Equation (1)) with a characteristic time scale t of the Ostwald regime of 6.7
days, which indicates that the same time scale 2t = 13.4 days is needed to reach the
pandemic saturation level. Therefore, it is possible that the time scale 2t = 14 days is
a characteristic time scale to suppress the pandemic spreading by targeted test,
mobile phone tracking, and geo-localization used in South Korea and China. The
Ostwald arrested or frustrated growth phenomenon which we observed in the
Ostwald phase is typically observed in diffusion processes in complex systems
[9,10], as found by our research group in quantum materials [11–13]. Indeed, this
trend is typically observed in non-homogeneous complex systems with “domain
walls” or “topological solitons” that slow down the growth, with a function having
a doubling time Td that changes continuously [14], which shows, that over the
course of time, one phase transforms into another metastable phase with a free
energy similar to that observed in the processes of crystallization of proteins [15]
and metal phosphates [16].

To quantify the success of the containment policies, we show in Figure 2 the
value of the doubling time Td as a function of time, for China, blue curve (panel a),
Korean, orange curve (panel b), and Italy, green curve (panel c), over a period of
time covering both NTP and OP phases. An increase in doubling time denotes an
improvement in the efficacy of the adopted strategy. It is clear that, at present, the
South Korea policy is the most effective. Looking at the experimental behavior, the
Ostwald growth is confirmed by the presence of kinks or steps in all curves, which
indicate the occurrence of successive phase transitions from a metastable phase to
another with a similar free energy, which are signatures of the dynamical
inhomogeneity of the process.
The increasing doubling time indicates that the count N of infections per day is
less than what would have been observed in the case of non-governed exponential
growth. The observed increasing value of Td as a function of time in the NTP and
OP regimes are shown to follow an empirical exponential law,
𝑇4 𝑡 = 𝐴 𝑒 ,/6 ,

(2)

measuring the slowdown of the rate of growth of the infection both in the
near-threshold phase and in the Ostwald arrested phase. The success of the
containment policy is measured by the shortest possible time to reach the day
where there are no infected people per day. This state corresponds to an infinite
doubling time Td achieved in China and in South Korea.

Figure 2 Evolution of the doubling time in the three countries: (a) South Korea, (b) China,

and (c) Italy. The figure shows the occurrence of steps in all curves, a phenomenon we
associate with the occurrence of transitions to successive different phases. The “s factor” is
the parameter obtained by exponential fit of the curves 𝑇4 (t) of the doubling time vs. time
over a period of days longer than 14 days 𝑇4 𝑡 = 𝐴 𝑒 ,/6 . The average period of time to get
the s factor in this work was 40, 15, and 30 days for China, Korea, and Italy respectively.
The results show that our success s factor probes the speed of the containment measures to
reach the epidemic saturation point. A small success s factor measures the success of the
confinement policy to keep the epidemic spread under control in a short time. The speed of
the Italy policy is about six times slower that the Korea policy.

As can be seen, even if to a different extent, the three approaches were
successful, whereby the different impact of the strategies can be immediately
recognized. South Korea seems to have been able to reach the goal in a shorter time.
This trend was quantified with the s factor, which must be as small as possible in
order to reach the goal of zero people infected per day in the shortest possible time.
We call this the success s factor of the strategy to stop the pandemic spread,
which was introduced in Reference [17]. The evolution of the doubling time
reported in Figure 2 for the three different countries is fitted by an exponential
functional dependence 𝑇4 𝑡 = 𝐴 𝑒 ,/6 over a period of time longer than the five
days used to calculate Td. The average period of time to get the s factor was 40, 15,
and 20 days for China, South Korea, and Italy, respectively. The success s factors for
the three countries are s = 9 for China, s = 5 for South Korea, and s = 31 for Italy.
The emerging question to answer is why in South Korea the arrested phase
started before the Chinese one. We can reasonably hypothesize that the protocol of
positive cases tracing in South Korea started quickly. South Korea made over
250,000 tests corresponding to ~0.5% of its population, quickly identifying a large
number of asymptomatic infections that were placed in quarantine [7], and tracking
movements of positive cases is clearly correlated with the arrested growth rate.
Moreover, only space confinement of the population is not enough; in fact, in the
last 10 days since the first experimental report of 15 March [17], the success factor in
Italy shows practically no changes, and in Italy the growth rate is still in the
near-threshold phase (NTP) 30 days after the threshold, while the arrested Ostwald
regime has not started. This may be due to a lack of mobile phone tracking being
activated, although strict space confinement measures were taken.
3. Conclusions
In conclusion, our interdisciplinary biophysical research provides a new
application of mathematical data analysis developed in the new field of quantum
complex matter physics [11–13] to epidemic viral infection dynamics in humans.
We present a comparison of the growth of epidemic spread of Covid-19 in
countries where a different policy of containment was activated. Our approach
introduces the quality “s” success factor to provide a quantitative evaluation of the
speed and efficiency of policies for arresting epidemic spreading. Our approach is
based on the study of the physical evolution of pandemic spread, which shows the
universality of the complex growth curve with multiple phases and transitions vs.
time within the framework of out-of-equilibrium processes. In this framework, the
results of our data analysis and, in particular, the introduction of the success s factor
are not influenced by the large indeterminacy in the number of infected people and
the lack of information on asymptomatic cases which indeed may hardly emerge.
For Covid-19, it is known that, at the threshold of the pandemic spread, the
growth is exponential with a doubling time Td0 of about two days. However, it was
not known how to quantify the different policies addressed to stop epidemic
growth curves. Our analysis clearly shows that South Korea and Chinese
approaches were more effective than the Italian one, probably due to prompt action
5

A. Bianconi et al Condens. Matter 2020, 5, 23; doi:10.3390/condmat5020023 arXiv:2003.08868

based on tracking positive cases. We show that, once data are shifted to the same
time origin, as in Figure 1b and 1c, there is a large difference in the time lapse for the
onset of the Ostwald arrested phase for different control strategies but when the
Ostwald phase starts it can reach its goal in 14 days.
The Korean approach could also be applied in other countries, and the results
show that governments and regional stakeholders must promote and make possible
the use of this practice. This study strongly suggests to extend the mobile tracking
approach in Italian regions and all over the world, in particular when the overall
number of contagious persons is limited and the spreading process is in the
pre-threshold phase (PTP) or in the near-threshold growth phase. At the present
stage, numerous experts and institutions are in favor of targeted testing and mobile
phone tracking of positive cases. People should be able to request free tests for
themselves since the limitation of tests to only people with symptoms is
unfortunately not an effective strategy, despite suggested by the World Health
Organization (WHO) [18].
We think that the choice of WHO was made in the initial phase of the new
epidemic phenomenon when data on the speed of Covid-19 epidemic spread and
age-dependent lethality in different countries with different average life-long
expectation were not known. The application of the success s factor can now
provide a very fast method to help WHO to modify their prescriptions based on a
quantitative measure of different velocities of different policies addressed to arrest
the Covid-19 pandemic, which was not available before. We can freely provide the
computer code we developed if requested to help non-profit organizations
maintain control over this rapidly evolving epidemic spread. The s factor can be
used to measure the efficiency of the needed confinement of infected people in
order to cut interpersonal contact for the duration of quarantine of individuals
during the peak of the epidemic phenomenon.
Finally, the results presented here show the capability of applying and tuning
strategies in any country, ruling out the option of any “non-containment” strategy
that exposes citizens to unacceptable risks. The main result of our work led to the
introduction of the success s factor for a quantitative measure of policies to arrest
the epidemic spread. Tracking positive cases with targeted tests represents the most
rapid pandemic control policy; in fact, it can be easily arrested in a short time 2t = 14
days as shown in both China and Korea, or it can be used to keep the epidemic
spread under the threshold phase, thereby stopping the explosion of exponential
growth as shown in both Singapore and Israel.
