Abstract
The main objective of this study is to check short term stress of COVID-19 on the American, European,
Asian, and Paci c stock market indices, furthermore, the correlation between all the stock markets during
the pandemic. Secondary data of 41 stock exchange from 32 countries have been collected from
investing.com website from 1st July 2019 to 14th May 2020 for the stock market and the COVID-19 data
has been collected according to the rst cases reported in the country, stocks market are classi ed either
developed or emerging economy, further divided according to the subcontinent i.e. America, Europe, and
Paci c/Asia, the main focus in the data is the report of rst COVID-19 cases. The study reveals that there
is volatility in the all the 41 stock market (American, Europe, Asia, and Paci c) after reporting of the rst
case and volatility increase with the increase of COVID-19 cases, moreover, there is a signi cant negative
relationship between the number of COVID-19 cases and 41 major stock indices of American, Europe,
Asia and Paci c, European subcontinent market found more effected from the COVID-19 than another
subcontinent, there is Clustering effect of COVID-19 on all the stock market except American's stock
market due to smart capital investing.

1. Introduction
Coronavirus is known as COVID-19 which affects the Wuhan, China in December 2019 and became the
cause of the crisis in Hubei China and then for the rest of the world, all of sudden COVID-19 became a
global pandemic. The entire world faced volatility in the stock market and a signi cant decline in the
equity market. This is the biggest volatility level seen in the United State stock market after October 1987
and December 2008. (Baker, S., Bloom, N., Davis, S. J., Kost, K., Sammon, M., & Viratyosin, T. 2020)
The WHO (World Health Organization) o cially declared a global pandemic to the COVID-19 outbreak on
11th March 2020. According to the WHO number of con rmed cases has been reached up to 4 307 287
on 14th May 2020 and it continues increasing day by day, Further as per reported by the WHO 216
countries has been affected by this pandemic and most number of con rmed cases has been reported in
the USA with 1,361,522 con rmed cases (WHO). The COVID-19 has signi cant effect the world economy
in short term as well as in the long term, in shorter-term consequence is limited activity in the economy
due to strict lockdown, in the longer-term impact of the COVID-19 many small businesses will be closed
and unemployment will be increased, the number of industries will suffer i.e. tourism airlines and hotels
(Zhang, D., Hu, M., & Ji, Q. 2020).
The question of this research is addressed the predominant importance equally for the market
policymaker, institutional investors, and individual investors. 12% decrease has been recorded in the Dow
Jones Industrial Average index which was the 2nd highest decline in the market history since 124 years on
16th of March 2020, although US government has taken many actions intended to improve the market

Page 2/35

which includes economy relief program and scal stimulus package the market did not improve
(Gormsen & Koijen 2020).
This paper aims to study the short term stress of COVID-19 on the performance of the major stock indices
of the 32 countries. In this research to recognize the systemic risk pattern in the stock market we are
going to answer the following questions through available data, How will we react to the stock market
during this pandemic? Does systemic risk escalate all over the world? Do the clustering effect exits in the
stock market return?
The structure of this paper is as follows. Section 2 consists of a literature review. Section 3 methodology.
Section 4 results and nancings, Section 5 discussion and conclusion.

2. Literature Review
After the outbreak of the COVID-19 so far research paper has been published about the impact of COVID19 on the stock market and the world economy before this pandemic there is literature available on the
Asian u 1957 and SARS 2003 which shows that the negative impact on the stock market all over the
world.
Barro, R., Ursua, J., & Weng, J. (2020) compared the Spanish Flu losses with COVID-19 and predict the
consequences of COVID-19 on the world economy, further they that the COVID-19 has caused to market
crashes, volatility, decline in the interest rate and decrease in the economic activities. The research used
forecasting model to identify future dividend and its growth, results reveal that the signi cant decrease in
the dividend growth 16% and 23% in the USA and Europe respectively and decline in the growth of GDP
expected to 3.6% and 5% in the USA and Europe respectively till 12th of May, 2020, further result reveal
that within the two years of period expected dividend growth will -29% and -38% in the USA and Europe
respectively (Gormsen, N. J., & Koijen, R. S. 2020).
Cajner, T., Crane, L. D., Decker, R. A., Hamins-Puertolas, A., & Kurz, C. (2020) researched the developments
the labor market during COVID-19, the results show that 13 million people lost their jobs in just two weeks
from 14 March to 28 March 2020 in the USA, further they compared that 9 million jobs people lost their
jobs in the Great Recession in the USA, moreover most effected sector from the COVID-19 is hospitality
30% decline in the employment which is almost 4 million people lost their jobs. Humphries, J. E., Neilson,
C., & Ulyssea, G. (2020) surveyed 8 thousand small business owners USA based and they show main
three ndings in their research, the rst one is that the 60% of the business owners already red one
worker from the job as they don’t aware with the CARES act by USA government which is also 2nd nding
of the research, and the third one is 46% of the business owner that the COVID-19 negative impact will
remain for next two years.
Bartik, A. W., Bertrand, M., Cullen, Z. B., Glaeser, E. L., Luca, M., & Stanton, C. T. (2020) has surveyed 5,800
owners of the USA based small business and reveal some important nding that the 43% of the business
has been stopped their activities which means they closed their business temporary and the 40%
Page 3/35

decreased seen in the employment rate, the number of business has been disabled nancially and
numbers of business are awaited for the Government aids.
Alfaro, L., Chari, A., Greenland, A. N., & Schott, P. K. (2020) researched the change in the market return due
to COVID-19 and research shows that 4% to 11 % signi cantly decline has been seen in the total market
value and further they nd that the increase in the number of cases causes a decrease in the volatility of
the market returns.
Zhang, D., Hu, M., & Ji, Q. (2020) research about the impact of COVID-19 on world nancial markets, they
argue that the due to COVID-19 record level of risk increase in the market which affected the investors in
very limited time. Onali, E. (2020) investigate the COVID-19 effect in term of the number of cases and
deaths on US and Europe stock markets and results reveal that there is no impact of COVID-19 on the
market returns of US Stock market also he nds that there is a negative relationship between COVID-19
cases and market returns of the Italy and France stock exchange. Nozawa, Y., & Qiu, Y. (2020) investigate
the market reaction of the corporate bonds during the COVID-19 and they nd that the Central bank
promised to support cut down the default risk for loan borrowers and further, the result shows mixed
evidence about the market reactions caused by the market segments and liquidity channels.
Ortmann, R., Pelster, M., & Wengerek, S. T. (2020) investigate the impact of COVID-19 outbreak on the
retail investors, the ndings show that the signi cant increase has been seen in the stock trading while
increase in the cases speci cally older age and male investors, 13.9 % trading in stock increased in the
week which affects the stock index and 9.99% decline recorded in Dow 30 on 12th March 2020.
Liu, H., Manzoor, A., Wang, C., Zhang, L., & Manzoor, Z. (2020) investigate the impact of COVID-19 on
world 21 major stock indices in short term, the results show that the word major stock markets have
directly affected due to COVID-19 and signi cantly decreased after the COVID-19 outbreak has been
recorded, moreover their results show that Asian countries are more affected than the other regions.
Further, regression analyses reveal that there is a negative relationship between the increase in the
number of cases and stock indices return.
Çıtak, F., Bagci, B., Şahin, E. E., Hoş, S., & Sakinc, İ. (2020) investigate the effect of COVID-19 on the stock
market they found that there is an existence of signi cant and negative impact of COVID-19 on the Stock
market of all the countries. Heyden, K. J., & Heyden, T. (2020) investigate that what impact on the stock
market of USA and European after the report of rst COVID-19 case in the country, the result shows that
there is a negative relationship between the report of the rst case and the stock market, further they
identify that the scal policy also negatively impacted on the stock market returns, improvement in the
stock market has recorded after the announcement of monetary policy.

The table above, exhibiting Indices Name, Alphabetical Codes, Country, Market, and Region Classi cation,
we have categorized market and region according to the indexes of Morgan Stanley Capital International.
This study had encountered 41 the best performing indexes around the globe categorized by
Investing.com, further alphabetical codes were used in the model construction.
3.1 Research Procedure
Page 6/35

3.1.1 Independent and Dummy Variables:
In this research we used dummy variable as reported Covid-19 cases in each of the countries since the
very rst case by assigning as 1 to the Covid-19 reported cases in the EGARCH Equation, however not
only we use a dummy variable to measure clustering effects in the model but also we employed
cumulative Covid-19 cases in place of dummy variable but this sort of model we not giving logical results
so we dropped these model and decided to use dummy variable in the research. In the regression model,
we used % change of Covid-19 cases daily in each of the countries then regressed these % changes of
Covid-19 cases to the daily indexes returns.
3.1.2 Dependent Variables:
Daily market average returns are used to as dependent variable in the regression and individual EGARCH
models, and in the classi cation wise models, we have averaged out indices daily market return
concerning their region and market classi cation and then create a single index such as Index of
Developed Market, Emerging Market, American, European, Asian and Paci c & Gulf markets.
3.1.3 Hypothesis
Null Hypothesis: There is no signi cant impact on the returns on each selected indices by the Coronavirus
Pandemic.
Alternative Hypothesis: There is a signi cant impact on each return on selected indices by the
Coronavirus Pandemic.
Null Hypothesis: There is no presence of clustering effects in the returns and volatility of each selected
indices, Developed and Emerging Markets, and Continental Markets during the Coronavirus Pandemic.
Alternative Hypothesis: There is a presence of clustering effects in the returns and volatility of each
selected indices, Developed and Emerging Markets, and Continental Markets during the Coronavirus
Pandemic.

3.1.5 Plan of Analysis / Statistical Tools
In the rst step, we examined shifts in the global indices by using descriptive statistics from 1st July 2019
to 14th May 2020 to compare pre and post-pandemic situation, shifts are classi ed as Median, Standard
Deviation, and Relatives Ranking of each index, Median and Standard Deviation is calculated based on
daily return and compressed to the monthly returns and then this monthly median and the standard
deviation is used to assign relative rankings.
In the second segment, we quanti ed the Correlation matrix before and after the pandemic to see the
international indexes joint movement to each other, is this segment we developed two matrixes and its
analysis.
The third phase represents the impact of COVID-19 on indices return in the continent, for that we
individually run regression model by using linear regression model using the daily basis data starting
from the rst case reported of COVID-19 in the country to 14th of May, 2020 and see constructed a
comprehensive table which illustrates how each index is effect by the % change in Covid-19 cases by its
coe cient and p-values.

Page 8/35

Not only we set the regression for each index, but also we see the clustering effect in each index in phase
four by using EGARCH model to use of daily basis data from 1st July 2019 to 14th May 2020 and see the
clustering effect by dividing them into two broad categories as Developed and Emerging Market as per
the guideline of MCSI.
Now in the fth phase of the research, we constructed a single index by averaging daily returns of
respective indices in two broad categories as Developed and Emerging Market, this time we tested the
joint clustering effect on Developed and Emerging Markets by assigning it a single index through
Averaging.
In the last segment phase 6 we use the same methodology as in step ve, but this time we jointly tested
the clustering effects in all of the 4 sampled continents by using the EGARCH model.
We have employed Descriptive Statistics, Ordinary Least Square (OLS), Correlation Matrixes, ARCH,
GARCH, TARCH, EGARCH and PARCH model, therefore we did not nd TARCH and PARCH suitable for this
study so we dropped these model, then from GARCH and EGRACH we selected EGARCH model according
to the Information Criterion Tests (AIC, HIC, and HQC) and in the last of every EGARCH model, we use
ARCH-LM test to diagnose the ARCH type of effect in the model.
OLS, GARCH, TGARCH, and EGARCH models were estimated and the model with the lowest values of AIC,
SC, and HQC criterions was selected.
The following EGARCH model was assessed for the study.
3.1.6 Exponential Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (EGARCH)

The equation above denotes the constant of the variance equation; is the βlog + (σ2t-1) GARCH term
which evaluates the size of the group effect in the restricted volatility of the selected indices returns. α
⌊(Et-1)/(σt-1)⌋ is the ARCH term which measures the closeness and scope of ARCH in uence in the
measured conditional uctuation. Is the asymmetric γ (Et-1)/(σt-1) expression which evaluates the
vastness of asymmetric effect. Asymmetric term measures the size of the uneven effect in the restricted
variations of the selected indices return. Adverse innovation, normally principals for the greatest part
stimulates higher next period volatility distinguished with positive development. This component is
known as Asymmetric impact (Ding et al., 1993).

The purpose of keeping above mentioned statistic was to analyze the median shift in the returns of the
each index, therefore not only we reported the shift in the median as well as encountered the risk
associated with the return in term of standard deviation it has been measure, shift of median showcased
that since Novel Covid-19 has not been declared as pandemic, the indexes above exhibiting the strong
stability with steady risk associated, on 11 March Novel Covid-19 declared as pandemic by the World
Health Organization (WHO), then stock market aggressively shown the abnormal change and huge shift
in the average returns, we have target the indexes classi ed into American region, whereas the virus
largely hit the world biggest economy so perceive consequences in term of stock markets could be seen
into American stock market, therefore the shift of median from month to month trailing 11 months
encountered in this research exhibited massive change each American index, Covid-19 declared
pandemic outbreak in the month of March and the massive change have been detected into each
American indexes, the best ranked index become eventually the worsen such as Dow 30, S&P 500,
Nasdaq, SmallCap 2000 and S&P 500 VIX ranked 39, 42, 30, 36 and 43 in Mar20 (Jul-19, 17, 5, 3, 15 and
13) on basis of monthly median returns respectively, further we had ranked entire indices classi ed by the
investing.com, hence S&P/TSX (Canada) and Hang Seng (Hong Kong) indexes were removed due to
insu cient data of Covid-19, moving forward in term of standard deviation the highest ranked indexed
best and vice versa, meaning indices with bigger rank number are consider best because risk associated
with them are on very low level therefore comparing to this phenomena again American indexes reported
the worsen ranked in term of risk, such as one to ve indexes shown the shift in risk 8, 11, 10, 2 and 1 in
Mar20 (Jul-19 41, 38, 23, 19, 1) respectively. The information also claims, when Covid-19 cases shown
signi cant increment in American ultimately put the impact on the American stock market and stood the
stock market on the verge of collapse. Therefore the American stock market was classi ed as the highest
vulnerable stock market around the globe. Not only there is a signi cant shift into the rank but also the
aggressive shift has been observed into the American stock market within 5 months only especially in the
month of March-2020 after declaration as a pandemic.

reported steady risk and stable returns, going towards Chinese stock market which showcases the
massive median shift in the month of February-2020 in each Chinese indexes, it is very interesting before
pandemic declaration the Chinese market more vulnerable and later proclaimed the signi cant stability in
term of Monthly Average Returns, Standard Deviation, Median and Standard Deviation ranks. The number
indicates that when there is a massive change in the number of Covid-19 reported cases in January and
February then the market lost its stability. Coming towards rest of the stock market into Asia, Indian stock

Panel 4 consists on Paci c and Gulf indexes, gulf region countries are least victim countries, business
activities are impacted heavily due to coronavirus pandemic in the paci c region and the shift of abovementioned factors support the statement, the major shift into the factors is being seen in Nikkei 225
(Japan) and STI Index (Singapore) in March. Nikkei 225 reports median average return -1.13% in Mar-20
(Jul-19 0.03%) and Median rank 35 in Mar-20 (Jul-19 20), however, STI Index exhibited monthly average
return at -0.95% in Mar-20 (Jul-19 -0.07%) with ranking as 33 in Mar-20 (Jul-19 31), in term of ranks STI is
not hit as much higher as Japan, the most considerable thing in the pandemic, according to survey Covid19 attacks quickly on people who are above 40 years, hence a noticeable thing that Japan inherent
skewed population in term of age group, there are more aged people compare to the teenage or young,
further the people in an age of 30 to 35 are in established phase and they are potential investors,
Page 17/35

therefore it can be perceived that Japan’s market was given hit due to withdrawal of potential aged
investors.

We have taken the date before and after the pandemic, hence above mentioned correlation matrix are
before Coronavirus cases, there are few indexes which have strongly signi cant correlation such as
American and European indexes, therefore the purpose was to see the relationship of the global indexes
to each other, hence in the second correlation matrix, we found very different results.

The European region is considered the most effective countries by Covid-19, above matrix, was
constructed after the very rst case of Covid-19 till 14 of May 2020, therefore it is being witnessed that
before pandemic the market was stable and have very least correlation but after the Coronavirus
pandemic entire European capital market started to travel in the same direction highlighted as in red. As
per the theory of Forbes and Rigobon (2002) the domino effect of one market to another one, if one
market crashed in the same region then there many chances that it will affect some other market, and
Page 18/35

this what is seen in the correlation matrix after the very rst case of Covid-19 to the current date, the
correlation markets indicates market to market impact in American & European regions, and these are the
regions which are badly affected by the virus.

By using linear regression model, we quanti ed the relation of % change in Coronavirus cases to index
returns, panel 1 consists on American indices, the indices from A to DI witnesses negative signi cant
relationship between % change in cases to the index returns, as much higher the percentage as much will
be a decline into the stock market, hence America is the highest affected region by Novel coronavirus and
off course due to complete lockdown in the entire states of America brought signi cant decline into the
capital market, many businesses closure and compressed of demand of basics products put the market
in trouble, supporting to above statement these are the major indices in America which have potential
represent entire American region collectively.
Panel 2 comprised on Asian region stock indexes, due to rapid increase in Covid-19 cases in China,
Thailand and Philippine impacted heavily on the economy of these countries including the stock market
as well, the outbreak took its rst breath in Wuhan (China Mainland) and travels from China to the entire
world, therefore table above showing the signi cant relationship with major indices of Chinese capital
market, increment in Covid-19 cases re ects into Chinese capital market, even not China is only one
which is lack behind, Thailand and Philippine also shown the impact of percentage change into Covid-19
cases with stock market downfall.
Panel 3 categorized one European based indexes, interestingly RTSI (Russia) and Budapest SE (Hungary)
did not have any signi cant impact on the % change in Covid-19 cases with stock market return perhaps
the had some smart policy to deal with the global pandemic, but rest of the entire European region capital
markets are badly damaged by the virus pandemic that what was analyzed in the above-mentioned
segment in the correlation matrix, we have further examined the effected indexes by assigning them
ranks according to their Coe cients driven from linear regression model as below.

We have excluded Russian RTSI (Russia) and Budapest SE (Hungary) from the rankings because Covid19 has no impact on these indexes, we used coe cient to account for the minor and major change in the
Page 20/35

% change in cases bring the unit to change into index return, therefore above mentioned ranks allow us to
pass comments that Austria is the highest in uential country in term of coe cient increment, suppose
1% changes are detected in % change of cases so it will bring 3.30% change into the stock market returns
of ATX index, although Worldsdometer ranks Italy, Spain, Germany, and Turkey into to ten effected
countries but above grid shows indeed a signi cant inverse relationship between % change in cases and
index return the effect is very nominal.
Panel 4 is quanti ed on Paci c and Gulf-based indexes, S&P/ASX 200, STI Index and Tadawul All Share
show a signi cant negative relationship between coronavirus cases and stock market returns, the
coe cient of the equations are very low that means there is a very minor type of effect on the indexes by
the increment in the Covid-19 cases within the country, therefore the relationship still exists and can’t be
ignored at all.

Not only we detected the effect and intensity of the Covid-19 on stock indices but also we have
encountered clustering effects into each index classi ed as Developed and Emerging markets, to
measure volatility in the stock indices we have used ordinary least square (OLS), GARCH, TARCH, PARCH
and EGARCH models, as per the information criterions (AIC, HIC, and HQC) the least valuable one model
is the best, we have selected to used EGARCH model in both of the panels, we have tested every single

It has discussed previously, America found the highest affect country around the globe; around 1.3m
cases are reported in US and New Zealand as the least cases around the world. Anyhow, according to
above mentioned EGARCH equation witnessed the smart policies of Portugal and Australia because the
PSI 20 & S&P/ASX 200 asymmetry term is insigni cant, which indicates that in both of the indexes there
is no instable uctuation which harms market decorum, therefore it is also noticeable that these both
market are saved from markets shocks generated by the bad news. Coming towards the rest of the
indices, almost every index reported the clustering effects because p-value of the EGARCH Term is under
accepted regions, meaning we cannot reject the alternative hypothesis, there are clustering effect in the
model, meaning period of low volatility is followed by period of low volatility for prolonged period and
period of high volatility is followed by period of high volatility, if one day return is negative then there
possibilities that next will be negative too and this pattern remains same with a certain time, and what
has been seen in the rest of the indexes in developed market. It is also noticeable that most of the indexes
categorized into the developed market are from America or Europe and that is the red zone area of Covid19, since it is declared a global pandemic entire markets shows negatives returns mentioned by the
model above.

In the emerging market, most of the countries are from Asian and Paci c regions, apart from the China
cross border countries to China are declared red zone in the pandemic. In above table Fourth and Fifth
column is the mean equation in the EGARCH model and rest of the columns for the EGARCH, result from
the emerging market are far different from the developed market such as the biggest index of china and
India DJ Shanghai and BSE Sensex had no clustering effect on pandemic even PSEi Composite does not
have any clustering effect because p-value of Asymmetry term (EGARCH Model) more than 0.10% which
means negative news or shock does not impact the market equilibrium, therefore smart policies and
initiative to retain the capital taken by the Indian, Chinese and Philippine looks fruitful stabilized the
market equilibrium. EGARCH refers to two broad criteria such as it measures the volatility into the stock
market as well as the role of information meaning negative and positive shocks into the market, before
moving forward we mentioned the table which indicated cumulative cases in Emerging Markets.

Russia, Brazil, and Turkey show the highest reported cases the in the above-mentioned table, whereas
Chine remains on the number, therefore in the indexes of Russia, Brazil and Turkey strong clustering
effect has been detected by EGARCH model, whereas in rest of the Chinese indices show aggressive
clustering effect apart from Shanghai index, we have dummy variable in the palace of every reported
case to developed EGARCH equation, hence almost every index individually effect by the Covid-19
reported by the regression model above and there are few indexes which have Covid-19 impact but not
clustering effect. Further, in the above-mentioned table, the emerging market indicates that there is a
clustering effect in each index apart from the Shanghai, BSE Sensex, and PSEi Composite.

In every individual phase of this research paper, we found European market is the most affected market
by the Covid-19 and most of the indexes are in the developed market comes under European region,
therefore we needed to hypothesize the Covid-19 clustering effect on Developed and Emerging Market
collectively, before this segment we analysis the market on an individual basis by using regression and
Page 24/35

EGARCH Model, but in this segment, we have averaged out the daily return of each index and plugged this
into the respective category and created single indexes for developed and emerging markets.
Initially, we tested the ARCH effect in the both constructed equation and found ARCH effect because pvalue of AR(1) is less than 0.05 or 5% which allow us to use ARCH family model, therefore we use
Ordinary Least Square, GARCH, TARCH, EGARCH and PARCH model, we selected EGARCH model
according to least value of AIC, SIC, and HQC.
Interesting both of the Developed and Emerging Markets exhibited positive returns in these 11 months on
the average basis shown by the mean driven equation the rst part of the model, invariance equation, it
has been witnessed that developed and emerging markets have strong clustering effect because p-value
of Asymmetry term is negative and less than 0.05 or 5% which further claims that the negative shock
within the market effect more rather than the positive shocks, which means huge increment in cumulative
cases make signi cant persistent volatility for long period, further coe cients of the mean and variance
equation are higher in the Developed Market compare to the Emerging Market, meaning Developed
Market is more volatile and have persistent clustering effect. Finally, we use diagnostic as ARCH-LM test
which indicates that equations do not have the ARCH type of effect; therefore p-value of ARCH-LM test in
both markets is more than 0.05 or 5% which proclaims that both equations do not have the ARCH type of
effect.

As per the Morgan Stanley Capital International region classi cation guideline, we have further divided
our model continent wise; the above table has the segments, (1) Mean Equation and (2) Variance
Equation. We can understand the Covid-19 cases globally by the below-mentioned table and pie chart.

Page 26/35

The table above shows the cumulative cases and percentage of the Covid-19 cases on the last terminal
day of this research as of May 15, 2020. Europe stood on rank 1 by having around 45.57% cases in the
continental ranking, while testing the Covid-19 Effect in correlation and regression model we found the
heavy intervention of pandemic to shock the European markets, but in this segment, we have to test the
volatility or clustering effect in each of the continents, we have averaged out the returns of all indices
which come under European region and us single index as European index then we regressed this on the
cumulative cases in the European region, in mean equation AR(1) show p-value less than 0.05 or 5%
which allow us to use the ARCH family model, as per the Information criterion AIC, SIC, and HQC we
selected EGARCH model is the most suitable model. p-value of Asymmetry term in European Market
Model is less than 0.05 or 5% with a negative coe cient, which supports the negative shocks impact
more rather than the positive news, Covid-19 is one of the kinds of a negative shock to the stock market
and the value of the coe cient of European Market Model the highest amongst all of them for models,
that further indicates the presence of stock market anomalies with market clustering in European indices,
moreover below is the bar chart of countries in the European region with cumulative percentages Covid19 Cases on last terminal day of this research.
By using the same methodology as above, we have averaged out all index and constructed the single
index as Paci c and Gulf, hence again AR(1) do not limit us to use ARCH family model, therefore by using
EGARCH Model we have driven mean and variance equation and came to the ndings by de ning the
clustering effect into the region, in the last segment we employed diagnostic test as ARCH-LM test and
the p-value is more than 0.05 or 5% which means there is no ARCH type of effect in the model and model
is t to predict results. The further below-mentioned graph illustrates country name along with % of
cumulative Covid-19 cases in the European region.

See Figure 3 uploaded in gure section.
By using same methodology as above, in paci c region, which is considered the second least affected
continent by the Covid-19 but it has the second-highest clustering effect, because the countries under this
region started lockdown earlier then Asia and the region has more reported Covid-19 cases compare to
Asia, which became the cause of clustering effect into the Paci c and Gulf region, however market
exhibits the instability in term of daily volatility witnessed by the negative coe cient and p-value (< 0.05
or < 5%) of Asymmetry term, initially ARCH test did not limit us to use ARCH family models, hence we
employed GARCH, TARCH, EGARCH and PARCH model, and found EGARCH as the most suitable model to
measure Covid-19 clustering effects into Paci c and Gulf Market which further proclaims that negative
news or shocks impact a lot than the positive news of shocks to the stock market, therefore rapid
increment in Covid-19 on daily basis created signi cant negative news/shocks and that is noticeable sign
for the clustering effect into the Paci c and Gulf region. In the last segment, we employed a diagnostic
test as ARCH-LM test and the p-value is more than 0.05 or 5% which means there is no ARCH type of
effect in the model and the model is t to predict results. Further, the graph below exhibits the comprised
countries and % cumulative Covid-19 cases on the last terminal day of this research.

Page 27/35

See Figure 4 uploaded in gure section.
To drive result for Asian Stock market we use the same pattern of calculating index and regressed it for
EGARCH model as above, initially we applied the ARCH test to see whether long term volatility is followed
by another period of long term volatility or in easy words can ARCH family models be used to witness
clustering effect into the region, hence the test allowed us to use ARCH family models, we found EGARCH
model is the best-suited model, Asian markets reported the negative abnormal returns, meaning as Covid19 cases increases in the market produce the negative downwards, going forward it has also been
noticed that market has strong clustering effect in the pandemic period. According to worlddometer and
rest of the other authentic sources, Asia is the least affected region by Covid-19 (Apart from China), two
factors became the cause of cushion or savior for Market from the virus effect, (1) Smart LockDown in
the Market and (2) Rapid Recoveries from the Virus, further, we can’t ignore the role of cumulative cases
in Asia which still lesser than rest of the other regions, and we found the least volatility into the market.
We employed the ARCH-LM test to check model tness and the p-value is less than more than 0.05 or 5%
which further indicates there is no ARCH type of effect in the model and model is t to use for prediction.
Below is the graph which illustrates % of Covid-19 cases in the pandemic.

See Figure 5 uploaded in gure section.
America is considered second the highest affected region by Covid-19, interestingly we could not nd
clustering effect into American stock market, by using the same methodology as above we employed the
EGARCH model and found indeed there is a signi cant relationship between individual American Index
and Covid-19 cases, but there is no clustering effect as illustrated by the value of the Asymmetry term
market is not effect by the negative shock or news in the pandemic, in the light of the above numbers we
can claim that America uses good Standard Operating Procedure (SOPs) to stabilize the capital market in
America. ARCH-LM test de nes the model tness because p-value is more than 0.05 or 5%, further below
is the graph of % of Covid-19 cases in the American Countries.

See Figure 6 uploaded in gure section.
We have also constructed model with continent indexed daily average returns with cumulative cases in
the continent and also with dummy variable by replacing cumulative cases into EGARCH model,
employed data is divided into categories (1) before the Covid-19 cases not a single case reported in the
region (we use 0 as dummy variable) and (2) After the very rst cases Covid-19 (we use 1 as dummy
variable). We found the rst model not suitable because nding were against logics so we dropped that
model and decided to select the second model with the dummy variable and the model is with the logic
and realities.

5. Discussions And Conclusion
5.1 Discussion: the purpose of this study is to encounter Covid-19 impact on global indices; hence we
have selected the best performing indices around the globe classi ed by the investing.com, we have used
Page 28/35

umbrella approach to see market movement before and after pandemic by using different models, in the
rst phase of the research we used descriptive statistics by classifying it region-wise as per the
methodology of MSCI, in which we see the median shift, standard deviation shift and relative rank shifts
before and after the pandemic, plus also try to relate the cumulative cases with these shifts into each
sampled index. In the second phase, we have seen the correlation matrix where is used to see the joint
movement of entire sampled indexes to each other before and after the pandemic, in the third phase we
tested linear regression model for each index by categorizing them region-wise as per the MCSI
classi cation to see the impact of % change into Covid-19 with single individual index, not only the
impact of Covid-19 to index return we also encountered the clustering effect-Volatility in each index by
using EGARCH model in this is classi ed as Developed and Emerging Market as per the methodology of
MSCI this is in phase four. With the same method by dividing markets into two broad segments as
Developed and Emerging Market, we collectively tested clustering effect by using EGARCH model in
phase ve, in the last phase six we classi ed the indexes into four broad categories as America, Asia,
Europe, and Paci c & Gulf by assigning them a single index and constructed variance equation by using
EGARCH model.
5.2 Conclusion: as per international reports, articles and other authentic source, region Europe found the
highest affected region around the globe, hence our research found the European Market in much
vulnerable and risk, shifts in descriptive statics shown the trend how European market goes from better to
good and worse nally, in these 11 months shifts indicates not only returns are affected by the Covid-19
in European capital market but also ranking with peer group became worsen, further the correlation
matrix illustrated after the rapid increase in the Novel Coronavirus Cases entire European market
exhibited highly correlated market, means almost all big indexes in Europe move closely to each other
and the linear regression model supported the this movement by illustrating the signi cant impact on the
Market Returns, moreover in MSCI index classi cation most indexes in Developed Market are from
European countries, due to this Developed ARCH model reported clustering effect in the developed
markets, and nally in the last model we have found European Market has the highest volatility in relation
to Covid-19.
With the rapid increase of Covid-19 cases in America affected American indexes, we found that American
indexes exhibited signi cant shifts in term of average monthly returns, standard deviation, and relative
rankings before and after the announcement of the pandemic by World Health Organization, we found
American Indices as stable because of intellectual and smart investment policies for capital markets,
indeed there is a signi cant and strong impact of Covid-19 on indices returns but no evidence found for
clustering effect/volatility in American indices.
Paci c & Gulf region countries reported the third-highest Covid-19 cases, therefore we found the great
shift in medians, standard deviation and relatives ranking in Paci c & Gulf indices, further we also
detected Covid-19 impacts on indexes daily returns, therefore in the last segment we found the Paci c &
Gulf indexes are classi ed as the second highest volatile market having strong clustering effect in
contrast to Covid-19 cases.
Page 29/35

Due to fewer cases reported in the Asian region and smart lockdown policy, we found that Asian stock
index indeed has Covid-19 impact on indexes but least clustering effect compare to Europe and Paci c &
Gulf, median shift indicated that after the declaration of pandemic (11-March-2020) market reported a
signi cant change in each index on Asian capital Market, therefore we can conclude Asian Capital Market
has the third effect market by the Covid-19.
