Abstract. In an earlier paper we proposed a recursive model for epidemics; in the present
paper we generalize this model to include the asymptomatic or unrecorded symptomatic people,
which we call dark people (dark sector). We call this the SEPARd -model. A delay differential
equation version of the model is added; it allows a better comparison to other models. We carry
this out by a comparison with the classical SIR model and indicate why we believe that the
SEPARd model may work better for Covid-19 than other approaches.
In the second part of the paper we explain how to deal with the data provided by the JHU, in
particular we explain how to derive central model parameters from the data. Other parameters,
like the size of the dark sector, are less accessible and have to be estimated more roughly, at
best by results of representative serological studies which are accessible, however, only for a few
countries. We start our country studies with Switzerland where such data are available. Then
we apply the model to a collection of other countries, three European ones (Germany, France,
Sweden), the three most stricken countries from three other continents (USA, Brazil, India).
Finally we show that even the aggregated world data can be well represented by our approach.
At the end of the paper we discuss the use of the model. Perhaps the most striking application
is that it allows a quantitative analysis of the influence of the time until people are sent to
quarantine or hospital. This suggests that imposing means to shorten this time is a powerful
tool to flatten the curves.

Introduction
There is a flood of papers using the standard S(E)IR models for describing the
outspread of Covid-19 and for forecasts. Part of them is discussed in [19]. We
propose alternative delay models and explain the differences.
In [10] we have proposed a discrete delay model for an epidemic which we call
SEPAR-model (in our paper we called it SEP IR model). In this paper we explained why and under which conditions the model is adequate for an epidemic. In
the present note we add two new compartments reflecting asymptomatic or symptomatic, but not counted, infected which we call the dark sector. We call this model
the generalized SEPAR-model, abbreviated SEPARd , where d stands for dark. This
is our main new contribution. We will discuss the role of the dark sector in a theoretical comparison of the SEPARd -model with the SEPAR model. We will see,
that – as expected – as long as the number of susceptibles is nearly constant, the
difference of the two models is small, but in the long run it matters.
A second topic in this paper is a comparison with the standard SIR model. This
comparison has two aspects, a purely theoretical one by comparing the different
fundaments on which the models are based, and a numerical one. For comparing
two models it is helpful to derive them from similar inputs. For this we pass from
the discrete model leading to difference equations to a continuous model, replacing
difference equations by differential equations. These differential equations fit into
the general approach developed by Kermack/McKendrick in [9], as we learnt from
O. Diekmann. The analytic model resulting from our discrete model has been introduced independently by J. Mohring and coauthors [12] and, more recently, by B.
Shayit and M. Sharma [20]. Also F. Balabdaoui and D. Mohr work with a discrete
delay approach with additional compartments and a stratification into different age
layers adapted to the Swiss context [3]. Recently y R. Feßler has written a paper [7]
in which different differential equation models are discussed and compared, including the classical S(E)IR-model and the analytic version of our model. Some hints
to earlier papers on the analytic delay approach can be found there.
In the second part of the present paper we apply the SEPAR model to selected
countries and to the aggregated data of the world. To do so we first lay open
how to pass from the data provided by the Humdata project of the JHU to the
model parameters. The data themselves are obviously not reflecting the actual
outspread correctly, which is most visible by the lower numbers of reported cases
during weekends. But in addition there are aspects of the data which need to be
corrected like for example a delay of reporting of recovered cases. All this is discussed
carefully. Reliable data about the size of the dark sector are only available in certain
countries where such studies were carried out. We found such studies for Germany
and Switzerland, for other countries we estimate these numbers as good as we can.
The case of Switzerland is particular interesting since the effect of the dark sector

SEPAR – COVID-19

which started to play a non-negligible role for the overall dynamics of the epidemic
in the later part of 2020 for the majority of the countries discussed here (India, USA,
Brazil, France) can be studied there particularly well. For that reason we begin with
this country and discuss the role of the dark sector in detail.
The paper closes with a discussion about what one can learn from the applications
of the SEPAR model. We address three topics: The role of the constancy intervals,
the role of the dark sector and the the influence of the time between infection and
quarantine. The latter is perhaps the most striking application of our model offering
a door for flattening the curves by sending people faster into quarantine, a restriction which imposes much less harm to the society than other means.

PART I: Theoretical framework
1. The SEPAR model and its comparison with other models
1.1. The SEPARd model. We begin by pointing out that we have changed our
notation from [10]. The compartment consisting of those who are isolated after sent
to quarantine or hospital, which there was called I, is now being denoted by A like
actually infected, in some places also described – although a bit misleading – as
“active” cases (e.g. in Worldometer). This is why we speak now of the SEPAR
model rather than of SEPIR.
Let us first recall the compartments introduced in [10]. We observe 5 compartments which we call S, E, P , A, R, which people pass through in this order: Susceptibles in compartment S moving after infection to compartment E, where they
are exposed but not infectious, after they are infected by people from compartment
P which comprises the actively infectious people, those which propagate the virus.
After e days they move from E to the compartment P , where they stay for p days.
After diagnosis they are sent into quarantine or hospital and become members of
the compartment A, where they no longer contribute to the spread of the virus
although they are then often counted as the actual cases of the statistics. In order
not to overload the model with too many details, we pass over the recording delay
between diagnosis and the day of being recorded in the statistics. After another
q days the recorded infected move from compartment A to the compartment R of
removed (recovered or dead).
We add two more compartments reflecting the role of the dark sector. There are
two types of infected people, those who will at some moment be tested and counted,
and those who are never tested, which we call people in the dark. This suggests
to decompose compartment P into two disjoint sub-compartments: Pc of people

4

M. KRECK, E. SCHOLZ

who after pc days will be tested and counted and move to compartment A, and the
collection Pd of people who after a longer period of pd days get immune and so move
into a new compartment Rd of removed people in the dark. To distinguish these
removed people in the dark from those who come from compartment P after recovery
or death we introduce another new compartment Rc of those removed people who
occur in the statistics. Of course R = Rc ∪ Rd .
The introduction of the dark sector in addition to the sector of counted people
leads to the picture that for the infected persons leaving compartment E there is a
branching process: a certain fraction α(k) of people from E moves to compartment
Pc at day k, whereas the fraction 1 − α(k) of people moves to compartment Pd .
The existence of these compartments is a fundamental assumption which distinguishes the SEPARd model from many other models including standard SIR. The
existence of these compartments is closely related to our picture of an epidemic like
Covid-19. Of course this is a simplification. If one assumes that the passage from
compartment S to compartment E takes place at a certain moment, the duration
of the stay in the next compartments varies from case to case. But it looks natural
to take the average of these durations leading for the different lengths e, pc , pd , and
q. All these have to be estimated from available information.
Once one has agreed to this there is another fundamental assumption. This
concerns the dynamics of the epidemic. Each person in compartment P has a
certain average number κ(k) of contacts at day k. Depending on the strength of the
infectious power of an individual the contacts will lead to newly exposed people. It
is natural to model this development of the strength of infectiousness by a function
A(τ ), which measures the strength τ days after entry into compartment P . Again
we simplify this very much, by replacing A(τ ) by a constant γ, the average value
of this assumed function. We will discuss this assumption later on in the light
of information available for Covid-19. Given the parameters κ(t) and γ our next
assumption is that, if we ignore the dark sector and set η(k) := γκ(k), the dynamics
of the infection can be described by the following formula:

(1)

Enew (k) = η(k − 1)

S(k − 1)
P (k − 1).
N

Here Enew (k) is the number of additional members of compartment E at day k
infected at day (k − 1) by people from compartment P and N the total number of
the population. This is a very plausible formula. We call η(k) the daily strength of
infection. It is an integrated expression for the averaged contact behaviour of the
population and the aggressiveness of the virus.
This is the dynamics if we ignore the dark sector. But members of compartment
Pd also infect. We assume that the contacts are equal to those in compartment Pc .
But the average of the strength of infection of people from Pd may be smaller than

SEPAR – COVID-19

5

for those in compartment Pc , since in general they can be expected to stay longer in
their compartment until they are immune and the strength of infection goes further
down. Thus we introduce a separate measure γc for those in compartment Pc and
γd = ξγc , with 0 ≤ ξ ≤ 1, for those in compartment Pd .
Using this the equation (1) has to be replaced by:
Enew (k) = s(k − 1)η(k − 1)[Pc (k − 1) + ξPd (k − 1)].

(2)

Given this infection equation the rest of the model just describes the time shifting
passage of infected from one compartment into the next and counts their cardinality
at day k. As usual we denote the latter by S(k), E(k), Pc (k), Pd (k), A(k), Rc (k)
and Rd (k). How such a translation is justified is explained in [10]. So we can just
write down the self explaining formulas here:
Introduction (definition) of the discrete SEPARd model: Let e, pc , pd ,
q be integers standing for the duration of staying in the corresponding compartments, 0 ≤ α(k) ≤ 1 be branching ratios at day k between later registered infected and those which are never counted, η(k) be positive real numbers describing the daily strength of infection for k ≥ 0, while η(k) = 0 for k < 0, and
ξ ≤ 1 a non-negative real number. Using s(k) = S(k)
the quantities S(k), E(k),
N
Enew (k), Pc (k), Pd (k), A(k), Rc (k), Rd (k) of the SEPARd model are given by
a) the start condition:
since the model is recursive we need an input for the first e + pd days (which
we shift to negative values of k), i.e. start data Estart (k) for
1 − (e + pd ) ≤ k ≤ 0, while Estart (k) = 0 for all k > 0,
Pc (k) = Pd (k) = A(k) = Rc (k) = Rd (k) = 0 (or some other well defined
start values, cf. sec. 2.3) for k < 1 − (e + pd );
b) the recursion scheme for k ≥ 1 − (e + pd ):
Enew (k)
E(k)
Pc (k)
Pd (k)
A(k)
Rc (k)
Rd (k)
S(k)
with

= s(k − 1)η(k − 1)[Pc (k − 1) + ξPd (k − 1)] + Estart (k)
= E(k − 1) + Enew (k) − Enew (k − e)
= Pc (k − 1) + α(k) Enew (k − e) − α(k − pc ) Enew (k − e − pc )
= Pd (k − 1) + (1 − α(k)) Enew (k − e) − (1 − α(k − pd )) Enew (k − e − pd )
= A(k − 1) + α(k − pc ) Enew (k − e − pc ) − α(k − pc − q) Enew (k − e − pc − q)]
= Rc (k − 1) + α(k − pc − q) Enew (k − e − pc − q)
= Rd (k − 1) + (1 − α(k − pd )) Enew (k − e − pd )
= N − E(k) − P (k) − A(k) − R(k)
P (k) = Pc (k) + Pd (k), R(k) = Rc (k) + Rd (k)

M. KRECK, E. SCHOLZ

The reason for this definition is easy to see. Additional people in, for example,
compartment Pc at the day k are (Pc )new (k) = α(k)Enew (k − e), while α(k)Enew (k −
(e + p)) move to the next compartment. Similar formulas hold for the compartments
Pd , A, Rc and Rd .
An important parameter in an epidemic is the reproduction number ρ, the number
of people infected by a single infectious person during its life time. If we assume
that κ(k) and s(k) may be considered as constant during pd days about k, we can
derive this number from the equations. It is

ρ(k) = (1 + δ)−1 κ(k) s(k) γc pc + δγd pd ,
where δ = 1−α
. For s(k) = 1 it is usually called the basic reproduction number, in
α
order to distinguish it from the effective reproduction number with s(k) < 1. In part
I of this paper we usually mean the basic reproduction number when we speak of
reproduction number, while in the part II the decreasing s(k) hast to be taken into
account and we usually speak of the effective reproduction number, also without use
of the attribute “effective”.
If we set α(k) = 1, Pd = 0 and Rd = 0, we obtain the SEPAR model without dark
sector as a special case of the SEPARd model. Effects of vaccination can easily be
implemented by sending the according number of persons directly from S to R.
For later use the following observation is useful. The number of people in a given
compartment at day k is the sum of additional entries at previous days, for example
E(k) =

e−1
X

Enew (k − j),

j=0
pc −1

Pc (k) = α(k)

X

Enew (k − e − j),

j=0

and so on for Pd (k) and A(k).
We abbreviate
(3)

H(k) = E(k) + P (k) + A(k) + R(k) ,

the number of herd immunized (without vaccination). Then the recursion scheme
implies:
H(k) − H(k − 1) = Enew (k)
P
Putting this into the formula above: E(k) = e−1
j=0 Enew (k − j), we obtain:
E(k) = H(k) − H(k − e)
and similarly
(4)

Pc (k) = α(k) H(k − e) − α(k − pc ) H(k − e − pc )),
Pd (k) = (1 − α(k)) H(k − e) − (1 − α(k − pd )) H(k − e − pd )),

SEPAR – COVID-19

A(k) = α(k − pc ) (H(k − e − pc ) − α(k − pc − q) H(k − e − pc − q)).
Using Rc (k) − Rc (k − 1) = α(k − pc − q)Enew (k − e − pc − q) = α(k − pc − q)H(k −
e − pc − q) − α(k − pc − q − 1) H(k − e − pc − q − 1) we conclude:
Rc (k) = α(k − pc − q)H(k − e − pc − q)
and similarly
Rd (k) = (1 − α(k − pd ))H(k − e − pd ).
This gives a very simple structure of the model in terms of a single recursion equation.
SEPARd -model: The recursion scheme of the SEPARd model is given by a single
recursion equation:
(5)

H(k) − H(k − 1) =

s(k − 1)η(k − 1) α(k − 1) H(k − 1 − e) − α(k − 1 − pc ) H(k − 1 − e − pc )


+ ξ (1 − α(k − 1)) (H(k − 1 − e) − (1 − α(k − 1 − pd )) H(k − 1 − e − pd ))

and the functions S(k), E(k), Pc (k), Pd (k), A(k), Rc (k) and Rd (k) are given in
terms of H(k) by the equations above.
If we pass from a daily recursion to a infinitesimal recursion, replacing the difference equation by a differential equation, we obtain the continuous recursion scheme,
where now all functions are differentiable functions of the time t:

H (t) = s(t)η(t) α(t) H(t − e) − α(t − pc ) H(t − e − pc ))


+ξ (1 − α(t)) H(t − e) − (1 − α(t − pd )) H(t − e − pd )
0

(6)

In both cases, discrete and continuous, consistent start conditions in an interval of
length e + p have to be added. For the discrete case see sec. 2.3. If we remove the
dark sector, the continuous model was independently obtained in [12].
The branching ration α and with it the number δ ≈ 1−α
of unrecorded infected for
α
each newly recorded one varies drastically in space and time, roughly in the range
1 ≤ δ ≤ 50. For Switzerland and Germany serological studies in late 2020 conclude
δ ≈ 2, for the USA a recent study finds δ ≈ 8 and in part of India (Punjab) a

M. KRECK, E. SCHOLZ

serological study found values indicating δ ≈ 50.1 For our choice of the model
parameter see below, section 3.
Besides the determination of α one needs to know the difference between pc and
pd and between ηc (k) and ηd (k), if one wants to apply the SEP ARd -model. As
explained above we estimate pc = 7. The mean time of active infectivity of people
who are not quarantined seems to be not much longer, although in some cases it is.
According to the study [21, p. 466] “no isolates were obtained from samples taken
after day 8 (after occurrence of symptoms) in spite of ongoing high viral loads”.
This allows to work with an estimate pd = 10, and so it is not much larger than pc .
A comparison of the SEP ARd model with a simplified version, where we assume
pc = pd =: p and ηc (k) = ηd (k) =: η(k) shows that with these values the difference
is very small (see figure 1). In the following we therefore work with the simplified
SEP AR: d model setting pc = pd =: p.
Recent studies indicate that the number of asymptomatic infected is often as low
as about 1 in 5 symptomatic unrecorded and is thus much smaller than originally
expected [13]. Although asymptomatic infected are there reported to be considerably
less infective than the symptomatic ones, their relatively small number among all
unreported cases justifies to work in the simplified dark model with the assumption
ηd (k) ≈ ηc (k) =: η(k). If we set P (k) = Pc (k) + Pd (k) as above, we see that
Pc (k) = α(k)P (k) and Pd (k) = (1 − α(k))P (k).

In part II we discuss how the time dependent parameter η(k) can be derived from
the data and a rough estimate of the dark factor δ can be arrived at, although it
lies in the nature of the dark sector that information is difficult to obtain.

1.2. The S(E)IR models and their assumptions. Whereas the derivation of
the SEPARd -model is based on the idea of disjoint compartments, infected people
pass through in time, there is a different approach with goes back to the seminal
paper [9]. A special case is the standard SIR-model or SEIR model. It seems that
most people use this as a black box without observing the assumptions on which it
is built. One should keep these assumptions in mind whenever one applies a model.
There is a modern and easy to understand paper by Breda, Diekmann, and de Graaf
with the title: On the formulation of epidemic models (an appraisal of Kermack and
McKendrick) [4], which explains the general derivation. In the introduction the authors state that the Kermack/McKendrick paper was cited innumerable times and
continue: ”But how often is it actually read? Judging from an incessant misconception of its content one is inclined to conclude: hardly ever! If one observes the
principles from which the S(E)IR models are derived one should be hesitant to apply
it to Covid-19.
Following [4] we shortly repeat the assumptions on which the general Kermack/McKendrick
approach is based . The general model considers a function
S(t) := density (number per unit area) of susceptibles at time t
and related to this a function
F (t)

10

M. KRECK, E. SCHOLZ

called the force of infection at time t. By definition, the force of infection is the
probability per unit of time that a susceptible becomes infected. So, if numbers are
large enough to warrant a deterministic description, we have
Inew (t) = F (t)S(t),
where Inew (t) is defined as the number of new cases per unit of time and area. The
functions S and I are related by the equation:
S 0 (t) = −F (t)S(t)
Then the central modelling ingredient is introduced:
A(τ ) := expected contribution to the force of infection τ units of time ago.
Alone from this ingredient an integral differential equation is derived, which gives
the model equations. For more details we also refer to a recent paper by Robert
Feßler who derived the integral equation independently [7].
Already here we see a different view of an epidemic. No compartments and their
cardinality are mentioned; in their place the authors mention only certain functions.
If the function A is assumed to decay exponentially,
A(τ ) = αe−βτ
with constants α, β. The model derived from this input is called the standard SIRmodel. It leads to two ordinary differential equations in the variable t:
I 0 = αsI − βI
R0 = βI
S(t) = N − I(t) − R(t),
where N as before is the number of the population and s(t) = S(t)
.
N
For the standard SEIR-model there is an additional function E(t) measuring the
exposed and the input function is now
β
A(τ ) = α
(e−γτ − e−βτ )
β−γ
This leads to 3 ordinary differential equations in t
E 0 = αsI − βE
I 0 = βE − γI
R0 = γI
S(t) = N − E(t) − I(t) − R(t),
where N as before is the number of the population. The infection function A(τ )
considered here determines the convolution part of an integral kernel in Feßler’s
approach mentioned above.

SEPAR – COVID-19

11

If Breda et al. are right, readers should be critical to papers applying the S(E)IR
models without explaining why the models, given their fundaments, are applicable.
As far as we can see, the assumption of an exponential decay A(t) is often not
mentioned by authors applying it in situations where it would be necessary to discuss
whether this assumption can be reasonably made. In a situation like Covid-19 where
infectious people are isolated as soon as possible, it seems questionable whether
this assumption holds. We are surprised that in most of the papers we have seen,
which apply the S(E)IR model to an analysis of Covid 19, this problem is not
even mentioned. This includes the papers of the group around Viola Priesemann
which play an important part in the discussion about how to deal with Covid 19 in
Germany [6], [5].
1.3. Comparing SIR with SEPAR. When we want to compare the SIR models
with the delay SEPAR model we have to lower, in a first step, the number of compartments by removing E, P and A and to replace them by a single compartment,
called I, of infected people which are at the same time infectious. For this model we
assume that infected susceptibles move right away to compartment I, where they
stay for p days. In contrast to the SEPAR model it is assumed that these people
are counted as actual infected people at the moment they are infected. After p days
they are counted as recovered or dead. So it is a strong simplification of the SEPAR
model, but it follows the same pattern as the SEPAR model since it is a delay
model. We call it d-SIR-model (“d-”for delay) to distinguish it from the standard
SIR-model. The equations for this model are based on the same principles as the
SEPAR model:
The continuous delay d-SIR model: Let p be a positive real number standing
for the duration of staying in the compartment I of infected and infectious people.
Let η(t) be a differentiable function measuring the strength of infection (including
the effects of social constraints). The quantities S(t), I(t), R(t) of the delay SIR
model are given by
a) the start condition:
A differentiable function I(t) for 0 ≤ t < p ,
b) and the delay differential equations:
I 0 (t) = η(t)s(t) I(t) − η(t − p)s(t − p) I(t − p)
R0 (t) = η(t − p)s(t − p) I(t − p)
S(t) = N − I(t) − R(t)
To compare this model with the standard SIR-model above we note that also the
d-SIR model (like the continuous SEPARd model) can be derived from the principles
of Kermack/McKendrick, as explained in [7]. One only has to take the product of
the characteristic function of the interval [0, p] with η = γκ as the function A(τ ).

M. KRECK, E. SCHOLZ

12

To compare the two models one has to relate the input parameters. In the case of
the d-SIR model they are η (for the comparison we assume that the contact rate is
constant) and p, whereas for the SIR-model they are α and β. The role of η is that of
α in the SIR-model, so we set α = η. There are several ways to relate the paramter
β of the SIR model with p occurring in the d-SIR model. One is to assume that the
total force of infection has to be the same if they describe the same developments,
i.e. with the function A(τ ) which is the product of the characteristic function of the
interval [0, p] with η one has the condition:
Z ∞
Z ∞
−βt
A(t)dt
αe dt =
0

0

Then the second relation:

α
β

= p η = p α and thus
1
β= .
p

In both cases the reproduction number is αβ = p α = p η.
If one applies this then there is a problem to find parameters so that at least at
the beginning the two models are approximatively equal. Thus one can relate the
tow models in a second way by choosing the parameters so that this is the case. For
this we fix values for α and β and chose the start conditions of the d-SIR model so
that they agree with the SIR-model during the first days. By construction of the
SIR-model the function I is nearly an exponential function as long as the function
S is nearly constant. Thus we chose the same exponential function as start values
for the d-SIR model.
Then the question is whether there are differences of the model curves in the long
run and how large the differences are. One should expect that the assumptions of
an exponential decay regulating the strength of infection of an infectious person in
the case of the SIR-model versus a period of p days, where the strength of infection
is constant and after that goes immediately down to 0 in the case of the delay dSIR, should result in higher values for the functions I(t) and Itot (t) = I(t) + R(t),
the total number of infected until time t of the SIR model. The following graphics
in which we assume a constant reproduction rate slightly above 1 show, in fact, a
dramatic difference supporting the expectation. A similar observation can be found
in [7, fig. 5, 6]
This has an interesting consequence for a situation in which a high rate of immunity is achieved either by “herd” effects or by vaccination. According to a simple SIR
model with constant reproduction number ρ = 1.5 and a population of 80 million
people (like in Germany) a little bit more than 0.6 · 80 = 24 million people would
have to be infected or vaccinated to achieve herd immunity, whereas according to the
delay model “only” about 0.3 · 80 = 12 million have to be infected (see fig. 3). The
difference corresponds to the fact that equal initial exponential growth is related to

different reproduction rates in the two models of the example given: ρSIR = αβ = 1.5
and ρd−SIR = p η ≈ 1.2. Such a difference matters because, according to the plausibility arguments given above, the delay model may very well be more realistic than
the SIR model for Covid-19.
Next we discuss the differences between the SIR model and the delay SIR model
during a time when s is still approximately equal to 1, both have constant reproduction numbers, and α = η like above. Moreover we assume that the initial growths
functions of both models are approximately identical to the same exponential function (because both are designed to modelling the same growth process).
In reality one observes longer periods in the data where the reproduction number
is approximately constant until it changes in a short transition period to a new
approximately constant value. Such changes may be due to containment measures
(non-pharmaceutical interventions) imposed by governments, which influence the
contact rate κ(t). In the next graphics we show the effect of such a change for both
models.
In figure 4 we let the dSIR and the SIR curves start with identical exponential
functions based on constant reproduction numbers. Then we lower the reproduction
rate by 40 percent within three days. As expected the SIR curves have a cusp since
one exponential function jumps into another, whereas the dSIR equation due to
the delay character shows a slightly smoother transition. The second and more
dramatic effect is that a similar phenomenon like in the long term comparison can
be observed: the SIR solution is far above the dSIR solution. The reason seems to
be the same, the different assumptions made by the two approaches about the decay
of the strength of infection.

These considerations show that the choice of the model may result in important
differences for the medium and long range development of the epidemic. We have
given arguments why we consider the delay SIR model more realistic for Covid-19
than the standard SIR approach.
But also the delay SIR model has defects when comparing it to the data. The
reason is that in reality it is not the case that an infected person gets infectious
the same day, and also it takes some time until an infectious person shows symptoms. This speaks in favour of the delay SEPAR approach. In part II we apply the
SEPARd model to data of selected countries. Here the model shows its high quality.
Since data about the dark sector are insecure we check how much the dark sector
influences the overall dynamics of the epidemic in the discussed countries up to the
present (until the end of 2020) and choose the dark factor of the model on the basis
of the analysis and given estimates for the respective countries.

PART II: Applications of the SEPAR model
2. Determining empirical parameters for the model
2.1. JHU data.
The basic data sets (JHU). The worldwide data provided by the Humdata project
(Humanitarian Data Exchange) of the Johns Hopkins University provides data on
the development of the Covid-19 pandemic for more than 200 countries and territories.2 The data are compressed into 3 basic data sets for each country/territory
Conf (k), Rec(k), D(k)
where Conf (k) denotes the total number of confirmed cases until the day k (starting
from January 22, 2020), Rec(k) the number of reported recovered cases and D(k)
the number of reported deaths until the day k. The last two entries can be combined
to the number of redrawn persons of the epidemic, captured by the statistic,
R̂(k) = Rec(k) + D(k) .
Empirical quantities derived from the JHU data set will be endowed with a hat, like
R̂, to distinguish them from the corresponding model quantity, here R.
The (first) differences of Conf (k) encode the daily numbers of newly reported and
acknowledged cases:
(7)

Ânew (k) = Conf (k) − Conf (k − 1)

The other way round, the number of confirmed cases is the complete sum of newly
reported ones, and may be considered as the total number of acknowledged cases
(8)

Âtot (k) =

k
X

Ânew (j) = Conf (k) ,

j=1

while the difference
(9)

Â(k) = Conf (k) − R̂(k) ,

is the empirical number of acknowledged, not yet redrawn, actual cases. Some authors call it the number of “active cases”;3 but this is misleading because the phase
of effective infectivity is usually over as soon as an infection is diagnosed and the
person is quarantined.
The number Rec(k) of recovered people is often reported with much less care than
the daily new cases and the deaths. By this reason the recorded number of redrawn,

3E.g.

in [19, p. 182] . . . A similar identification underlies the numbers for the active case in the
Worldometer https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/.

M. KRECK, E. SCHOLZ

R̂(k), may be heavily distorted, with the result that neither itself nor the derived
numbers Â(k) can be be taken at face value. The most reliable basic data remain
therefore
Ânew (k) , Conf (k)
and D(k) .
Even Ânew (k) has its peculiarities due to the weekly cycle of reporting activities. In
this paper we abstain from discussing mortality rates and consider the first two data
sets of the mentioned three only. R̂ and Â play an important role for a complete
image of an epidemic, but they are reliable only for a few countries; for the majority of countries they have to be substituted or complemented by more adequate
quantities derived from the basic data (see eq. 12).
Smoothing the weekly oscillations of Ânew . For all countries the reported number
of daily new infections shows a characteristic 7-day oscillation resulting from the
reduction of tests over weekends and the related delay of transmission of data. A
3-day sliding average suppresses fluctuations on a day-to-day scale and shows the
weekly oscillations even more clearly.

In some countries these oscillations are corrected for transmission delay by central
institutions,4 but such corrections are not implemented in the JHU data. A simple
method for smoothing the weekly oscillations consists in using sliding centred 7-day
averages:
(10)

Ânew,7 (k) =

3
1 X
Ânew (k + j)
7 j=−3

and similarly for the centred 3-day average Ânew,3 (k). Note that in order to avoid
a time shift effect which would arise from using a purely backward sliding average,
we use a sliding average over 3 days forward and 3 days back. For most countries
this suffices for carving out the central tendency of the new infections quite clearly
(fig. 5).
4

This is done by the Robert Koch Institut for the German case.

SEPAR – COVID-19

17

For some countries already the daily fluctuations of Ânew are extreme. The French
data even indicate negative values for Ânew for certain days, although this ought
to be excluded by principle. Such effects indicate a highly unreliable system of
data recording and transmission; they may be due to ex post corrections of earlier
exaggeration of transmitted numbers. But even under such extreme conditions the
sliding 7-day average leads to reasonable information on the mean motion of the new
infections, so that we don’t have to exclude such countries from further consideration
(sec. 3.1).
2.2. Data evaluation.
The “actual” cases in the statistical sense. The difference Â(k) = Âtot (k) − R̂(k) (8)
can in principle be considered as an expression for the number of actual cases; but
it is corrupted by the fact that the number of daily recovering Rec(k) is irregularly
reported. For a critical investigation of this number we start from the truism that
any actually infected person recorded at day k has been counted among the Ânew (l)
at some earlier day, l ≤ k. The smallest number q̂(k) of days preceding k (including
the latter) necessary for supplying sufficient large numbers of infected Â(k),
l
hX
i
(11)
q̂(k) = min
Ânew (k − j) ≥ Â(k) ,
l

j=0

is a good indicator for the mean time of sojourn in the collective of infected which
are recorded as “actual cases”. As long as the number of severely ill among all
infected persons is relatively small and the time of severe illness well constrained,
we may expect that the mean time of actual illness does not deviate much from the
time of prescribed minimal time of isolation qmin for infected persons. In the case of
Covid-19 q(k) surpasses qmin ≈ 14 only moderately for India, Germany, Switzerland
etc. (fig. 6). For many other countries q̂(k) behaves differently. It starts near the
time of quarantine or isolation but increases for a long time monotonically with
the development of the epidemic, before often – although not always – it starts to
decrease again after the (local) peak of a wave has been surpassed. This is the case,
e.g., for Italy and the US; in the last case the deviation is extreme, q̂(k) surpasses
100 and shoots up a little later (see fig. 7)
This effect cannot be attributed to medical reasons; the major contribution rather
results from the unreliability of the statistical book keeping: With the growing
overload of the health system, the time of recovery of registered infected persons is
being reported with an increasing time delay, sometimes not at all (e.g., Sweden,
UK). The difference Â(k) = Âtot (k) − R̂(k) gets increasingly confounded by the lack
of correctness in the numbers Rec(k). In these countries it is an expression of the
number of “statistically actual” cases only with, at best, an indirect relation to the
real numbers of people in quarantine or hospital.

Figure 7.

Daily values of the mean time q̂(k) of being statistically counted as actual
infected for Italy (left) and USA (right)

The information gathered for Covid-19 proposes the existence of a stable mean
time q of isolation of infected persons (including hospital) for long periods in each
country. It is usually a few days longer than the official duration of quarantine
prescribed by the health authorities. Given q, the sum
(12)

Âq (k) =

q−1
X

Ânew (k − j)

j=0

can be used as an estimate of the number of infected recorded persons who are
in isolation or hospital at the day k. Here we do not use 7- or 3- day averages,
because the summation compensates the daily oscillations anyhow. The accordingly
corrected number of redrawn R̂q is of course given by
(13)

R̂q = Â + R̂ − Âq .

Figure 8 shows Â(k), Âq (k) for the USA (with q = 15). It demonstrates the
difference between Â(k) (dark blue) and Âq (k) (bright blue) and shows that Âq (k)
is a more reliable estimate of actually infected than the numbers Â(k) (the “active
cases” of the Worldometer).
For countries with reliable statistical recording of the recovered we find q̂(k) ≈
const. In this case we choose this constant as the value for the model q. For other

countries one may use a default value, inferred from comparable countries with a

Simplifying assumptions on the duration e of exposition and the duration p of effective infectivity. For Covid-19 it is known that there is a period of duration say e
between the exposition to the virus, marking the beginning of an infection, and the
onset of active infectivity. Then a period of propagation, i.e. effective infectivity,
with duration p follows, before the infection is diagnosed, the person is isolated in
quarantine or hospital and can no longer contribute to the further spread of the
virus. Although one might want to represent the mentioned durations by stochastic
variables with their respective distributions and mean values, we use here the mean
values only and make the simplifying assumption of constant e and p approximated
by the nearest natural numbers.
The Robert Koch Institute estimates the mean time from infection to occurrence
of symptoms to about 4 days [16], (5.). This is divided into e plus the time from
getting infectious to the occurrence of symptoms. According to studies already
mentioned above the latter is estimated as 2 days, so as a consequence we estimate
e = 2. In section 3 we generically use p = 7. We have checked the stability of the
model under a change of the conventions of parameter choice inside the mentioned
intervals.
Estimate of the daily strength of infection. As announced in part I we work with
the simplified SEPARd model. This means that the duration in compartments Pc
and Pd is equal, here denoted by p, and also the strength of infection is assumed to
be equal: ηc = ηd = η. Furthermore, if P (k) = Pc (k) + Pd (k) there is a branching
ratio α, which has to be estimated for each country, such that Pc (k) = αP (k) and
Pd (k) = (1 − α)P (k). For every counted infected there are then
1−α
δ=
α
uncounted ones. We call δ the dark factor.

M. KRECK, E. SCHOLZ

20

Once e and p are given (or fixed by convention inside their intervals) one can determine the empirical strength of infection η(k) using the model equations. Namely
η(k) =

Enew (k + 1)
.
s(k)P (k)

In terms of the total number of infected H(k) (see (4) and with constant α this is
η(k) =
H(k + 1) − H(k)


s(k) α H(k − e) − H(k − (e + pc )) + ξ (1 − α) H(k − e) − H(k − (e + pd )))


For the simplified SEPARd model we have αEnew (k) = Anew (k + e + p) and
P
αP (k) = pj=1 Ânew (k + j). Thus α cancels and we obtain:
(14)

η(k) =

Anew (k + e + p)
P
s(k) pj=1 Anew (k + j)

Denoting, as before, the values we obtain from the data by η̂(k) etc. we obtain
(15)

η̂(k) =

Ânew (k + e + p)
P
ŝ(k) pj=1 Ânew (k + j)

resp. η̂7 (k) =

Ânew,7 (k + e + p)
,
P
ŝ(k) pj=1 Ânew (k + j)

where in the second equation we work with the weekly averaged data.
An estimation of the total number of new infections induced by an infected person
during the effective propagation time (and thus the whole time of illness) is then
(16)

ρ̂(k) =

p−1
X

η̂(k + j)ŝ(k + j) ;

j=0

and similarly for ρ̂7 (k). In the following we generally use the latter but write just
ρ̂(k). Note also that the determination of the strength of infection η̂(k) by (15)
needs an estimation of the dark factor δ because the latter enters into the ratio of
susceptibles ŝ(k),while it cancels in the calculation of the empirical reproduction
rate ρ̂(k) (17).
This is an empirical estimate for the reproduction number ρ(k). In periods of
nearly constant daily strength of infection one may use the approximation
p Anew,7 (k + e + p)
(17)
ρˆ7 (k) ≈ p ηˆ7 (k)ŝ(k) = Pp
j=1 Anew (k + j)
Inspection of transition periods between constancy intervals for Covid 19 shows that
this approximation is also feasible in such phases of change. For p = 7 this variant
of the reproduction number stands in close relation to the reproduction numbers
used by the Robert Koch Institut, see appendix 4), which gives additional support
to this choice of the parameter.

SEPAR – COVID-19

2.3. SEPARd parameters. For modelling Covid-19 in the simplified dark approach we use the parameter choice e = 2, p (= pc = pd ) = 7 as explained in sec.
2.2. Where we differentiate between pc and pd we usually use pc = 7 and pd = 10.
The value for q depends on the reported mean duration of reported infected being
counted as “actual (active)” case for each country (sec. 2.1); in the following reports
it usually lies between 10 and 17. For each country we let the recursion start at
the first day k0 at which the reported new infections become “non-sporadic” in the
sense that no zero entries appear at least in the next e + pd days (Ânew (k) 6= 0 for
k0 ≤ k ≤ k0 +(e+pd )). For k ≥ k0 −1 the values η̂(k) are calculated in the simplified
case, p = pc = pd according to (15). Otherwise the formula above (14) has to be
used.
Start values. For the numerical calculations we use the recursion (5), with start
values given by time shifted numbers of the statistically reported confirmed cases,
expanded by the dark factor, for k in the interval J−1 = [k−1 , k0 − 1] where k−1 =
k0 − 1 − (e + pd ):
Ĥ(k) = (1 + δ)Conf (k + e + pc ) = (1 + δ)Âtot (k + e + pc )
Note that the time step parametrization in the introduction/definition of the SEPAR
model in sec. 1.1 works with k0 = 1.
If we set the model parameters η(k) = 0 for k < k0 − 1 and η(k) = η̂(k) for
k ≥ k0 − 1, the recursion reproduces the data exactly, due to the definition of
the coefficients. Then and only then it becomes tautological. Already if we use
coefficients η̂7 (k) for k ≥ k0 from time averaged numbers of daily newly reported
according to eq. (15), the model ceases to be tautological. In this case the parameter
η0 = η(k0 − 1) may be used for optimizing (root mean square error) the result for
the total number of reported infected Atot in comparison with the empirical data
(8). The model acquires conditional predictive ability, if longer intervals of constant
coefficients are chosen.
One may prefer to replace Anew by the 7-day averages Ânew,7 by introducing
Conf 7 (k) =

k
X

Ânew,7 (j) (+const)

j=k−1

and Ĥ7 (k) = (1 + δ) Conf7 (k + e + pc ). For constant α(k) = α the replacement of
the Ânew in the denominator of (15) then boils down to defining
η̂7 (k) =

Ĥ7 (k + 1) − Ĥ7 (k)


ŝ(k) α Ĥ7 (k − e) − Ĥ7 (k − (e + pc )) + ξ(1 − α) Ĥ7 (k − e) − Ĥ7 (k − (e + pd ))

M. KRECK, E. SCHOLZ

22

Then the model becomes tautological also for the use of daily varying η̂7 (k) and
ceases to be so only after introducing constancy intervals as described in the next
subsection.
Main intervals. The number of empirically determined parameters can be drastically
reduced by approximating the daily changing empirical infection coefficients η̂7 (k)
(k = k0 , k0 + 1, . . .) by constant model values ηj (1 ≤ j ≤ l) in appropriately chosen
intervals J1 , . . . Jl . We call them the constancy, or main, intervals of the model.
Their choice is crucial for arriving at a full-fledged non-tautological model of the
epidemic.
We thus choose time markers kj (“change points”) for the beginning of such intervals and durations ∆j for the transition between two successive constancy intervals,
such that:
Jj = [kj , kj+1 − ∆j+1 ] ,
j = 1, . . . , l
In the main interval Jj the model strength of infection ηj (this is the constant daily
strength of infection during this time) are generically chosen as the arithmetical
mean of the empirical values mean{η̂(k) | k ∈ Jj }. Small deviations of the mean,
inside the 1 σ range of the η̂-fluctuations in the interval, are admitted if in this way
the mean square error of the model Atot can be reduced noticeably. The dates tj of
change points kj can be read off heuristically from the graph of the η̂7 and may be
improved by an optimization procedure. k1 is chosen as the first day of a period in
which the daily strength of infection can reasonably be approximated by a constant.
In the initial interval J0 = [k0 , k1 − 1] the model uses the empirical daily strength
of infection: η(k) = η̂7 (k) for k ∈ J0 . In the transition intervals [kj − ∆j , kj ] the
model strength of infection is gradually, e.g. linearly, lowered from ηj−1 to ηj .5
For the labelling of the days k there are two natural choices; the JHU day count
starting with k = 1 at 01/22/2020, or a country adapted count such that k0 = 1,
where k0 labels the first day for which the reported new infections become nonsporadic (see above). Both choices have their pros and contras; in the following we
make use of both in different contexts, declaring of course which one is being used.
Influence of the dark sector. Proceeding in this way involves an indirect observance
of the dark sector’s contribution to the infection dynamics of the visible sector. An
unknown part of the counted new infections Ênew (k) is causally due to contacts with
infectious persons in Pd of the dark sector, eqs. (2) or (5)). According to estimates
of epidemiologists there is a wide spectrum of possibilities worldwide, 0 ≤ δ ≤ 100,
for Covid-19, while we have only rough guesses for the different countries. In the following country reports we work with the simplified dark approach, pd = pc = p = 7

we use the smoothing function described in [10]. Also an elementary optimization procedure for determining the main intervals is described in this paper.

and ξ = 1 (γc = γd ) and use estimates for the dark factor δ explained in the respective country section.

3. Selected countries/territories
In our collection we include four small or medium sized European countries
(Switzerland, Germany, France, Sweden), three large countries from three different continents (USA, Brazil, India), and a model for the aggregated data of all
world countries and territories. For the first country analysed here, Switzerland,
relatively reliable data on the dark sector are accessible. We take it as an example
for a discussion of the effects of different assumptions on the branching ration α,
respectively the factor δ, of the dark sector. For the other countries we lay open on
which considerations our choice of the model the dark factor is based.
3.1. Four European countries; Switzerland Germany, France, Sweden.
The four European countries discussed here show different features with regard to
the epidemic: Switzerland and Germany have a relatively well organized health and
data reporting system; the overall course of the epidemic with wave peaks in early
April and in early November 2020 and a moderately controlled phase in between is is
typical for most other European countries. France, in contrast, shows surprising features in the documentation of statistically recorded new infections (negative entries
in the first half of the year); and Sweden has been chosen because of a containment
strategy of its own. In the case of Switzerland and Germany first results of representative serological studies are available. They allow a more reliable estimate of the
size of the dark sector than in most other cases. We therefore start our discussion
with these countries.
Switzerland. The numbers of reported new infected ceased to be sporadic in Switzerland at February 29, 2020; we take this as our day t0 = 1. For the reported daily
new infections (3-day and 7-day sliding averages) see figure 9. At Feb 28 recommendations for hygiene etc. were issued by the Swiss government and large events
prohibited, including Basel Fasnacht (carnival). These regulations were already active at our day t0 = 1 (Feb 29) and explain the rapid fall of the empirical strength
of infection (7-day averages) η̂7 (k) at the very beginning of our period. During the
next 15 days a series of additional general regulations were taken: Mar 13, ban of
assemblies of more than 100 persons, lockdown of schools; Mar 16 (t = 12) lockdown
of shops, restaurants, cinemas; Mar 20 (t = 16), gatherings of more than 5 persons
prohibited. This sufficed for lowering the growth rate quite effectively. The SEPAR
reproduction number started from peak values close to 5 and fell down to below the
critical value at March 23, the day t1 = 24 in the country count (fig. 10, left). Here
it remained with small oscillations until mid May, after which it rose (we choose

M. KRECK, E. SCHOLZ

24

t2 = 85, May 23, as the next time mark), with strong oscillations until late June,
before it was brought down to close to 1 in late June (t3 = 158, June 23). A long
phase of slow growth (ρ ≈ 1.1) followed until mid September. An extremely swift
rise of the reproduction number to values above 2 in late September (t4 = 242, Sep.
26) brought the number of new infections to heights formerly unseen in Switzerland.
In spite of great differences among the differently affected regions (Kantone) the
epidemic was brought under control at the turn to November (t5 = 272, Oct. 27).

Figure 10. Left: Empirical reproduction rates ρ̂(k) for Switzerland.
Right: Daily strength of infection η̂7 (k) (yellow) with model parameters ηj (black dashed) in the main intervals Jj for p = 7 and δ = 2.
The empirical values of the infection strengths η̂7 (k) determined on the basis of
the 7-day sliding averages Ânew,7 depend on estimates of the dark factor δ (cf. eq.
15). Recent serological studies summarized in [11] conclude δ ≈ 2. We choose this
value as generic for the simplified SEPARd model. The values of η̂7 (k), assuming a
dark factor δ = 2, are shown in fig. 10, right. How its values are affected by different
assumptions for the dark sector can be inspected by comparing with the results for

only late in the year 2020.

Figure 11. Comparison of empirical values η̂7 (k) assuming dark factor δ = 0 (left) and δ = 4 (right); for comparison with generic choice
δ = 2 see last figure.
With the time markers between different growth phases of the epidemic indicated
above we choose the following main intervals for our model: J0 = [1, 22], J1 =
[24, 78], J2 = [85, 117], J3 = [119, 204], J4 = [211, 230], J5 = [242, 264], J6 =
[270, 321], end of data (teod = 321) at Jan 14, 2021. The model values ηj in the
Intervals Jj are essentially the mean values of η̂7 (k) in the respective interval, where
small deviations inside the 1 sigma domain are admitted if the (root mean square)
fit to the empirical data Âtot can be improved. They are given in the table below and
indicated in fig. 10 (black dashed lines). (Note that η0 has no realistic meaning; it is a
free parameter of the start condition for modelling on the basis of the 7-day averages
η̂7 (k), see sec. 2.3.) The reproduction rates ρj in the table refer to the beginning
of the intervals; in later times the decrease of s(k) can lower the reproduction rates
until the end of the intervals considerably. In the case of Switzerland the latter
crosses the critical threshold 1 inside the last constancy interval (see below).

The course of the new infections is well modelled with these values (fig. 12); the
same holds for the total number of counted infected (fig. 15 below).
The count of days q̂(k), necessary for filling up the numbers of reported actual
infected by sums of newly infected during the directly preceding days shows a relatively stable value, q̂(k) ≈ 15, until early November. Since then the mean time
of reported sojourn in the department A increases steeply (fig. 13, left). Initially
this may have been due to a rapid increase of severely ill people during the second

wave of the epidemic; but the number does not fall again with the stabilization in
December 2021. A comparison of the statistically recorded actual infected Â(k) with
the q-corrected one Âq (k) (eq. 11) shows an ongoing increase of the first while the
second one falls again after a sharp peak in early November (same figure, right). We
conclude from this that from December 2020 onward the numbers of recovered are
no longer reliably reported even in Switzerland.

infection q̂(k) for Switzerland. Right: Comparison of reported infected
Â (dark blue) and q-corrected number (q = 15) of recorded actual
infected Âq (bright blue) from the JHU data in Switzerland.
Both quantities cam be well modelled in our approach (fig. 14), although we
consider Âq (k) as a more reliable estimate for actually ill persons.
On this basis, the SEPARd model expresses the development of the epidemic in
Switzerland on the basis of only 6 constancy intervals for the parameters η for the
whole year 2020. The three main curves of the total number of recorded infected,
Atot (k), the number of redrawn R(k) and the number of diseased counted as statistical “actual” cases A(k) are shown in figure 15.

Figure 15. Empirical data (solid coloured lines) and model values
(black dashed) in Switzerland for numbers of totally infected Âtot
(brown), redrawn R̂ (bright green), and actual numbers Â, according to the statistic (blue).
This may encourage to look at a conditional 30-day prediction for Switzerland
given by the SEPARd model, the condition being the hypothesis of no considerable
change in the contact behaviour of the population and no increasing influence of
new virus mutations, i.e., a continuation of the recursion with η6 , the strength of
infection in the last constancy interval (fig. 16).
The figures show clearly that, under the generic assumption δ = 2 for Switzerland,
the ratio of infected s(k) starts to suppress the rise of new and actual infections
already in January 2021 even for the upper bound of the 1-sigma estimate for the
parameter η7 (fig. 16, top). Of course the question arises what would be changed
assuming different values for the dark factor. Figure 17 shows how strongly the ratio
of susceptibles is influenced by the choice of δ already at the end of 2020.

1-sigma region dotted).

Assuming a negligible dark sector (δ = 0) and the upper boundary of the 1-sigma
interval of η7 , the number of new infected would continue to rise deeply into the first
quarter of 2021. In all other cases the effective reproduction number is suppressed
below the critical value by the ratio of susceptibles s(k) already at the turn to the
new year. We conclude that the role of the dark sector starts to have qualitative
impact on the development of the epidemic in Switzerland already at this time.

Germany. The epidemic entered Germany (population 83 M) in the second half of
February 2020; the recorded new infections seized to be sporadic at t0 = Feb. 25,
the day k0 = 1 in our country count. With the health institutions being set in a first
alarm state and public advertising of protective behaviour, the initial reproduction
rate (as determined in our model approach) fell swiftly from roughly ρ ≈ 4 to about
1.5 until mid March. At May 25 (t1 = 30) it dropped below 1 and stayed there,
with an exceptional week (dominated by a huge infection cluster in the meet factory
Tönnies) until late June 2020 (fig. 19 left). The peak of the first wave was reached
by the 7-day averages of new infections Ânew,7 at March 30; 6 days later, i.e. April
6, the local maximum for the actual numbers of reported infected Â followed.
Serological studies in the region Munich indicate that during the first half of 2020
the ratio of counted people was about α = 0.25 in Germany, i.e. for each counted
person there were δ ≈ 1−α
= 3 persons entering the dark sector [14]. Of course this
α

M. KRECK, E. SCHOLZ

ratio varies in space and time, for example if the number of available tests increases
or, the other way round, it is too small for a rapidly increasing number of infected
people. The rapid expansion of testing,in Germany during early summer seems to
have increased the branching ratio to about α ≈ 0.5. In follow up investigations the
authors of the Munich study come to the conclusion that during the next months
the ratio of unreported infected has decreased considerably; this brought the factor
δ down to ≈ 1 in early November 2020.6 Since the dark segment influences our
model mainly through its contribution to lowering of the ratio of susceptibles s(k),
it is nearly negligible in the first six months of the epidemic. We therefore simplify
the empirical findings by setting δ = 1 for the SEPARd model of Germany.
Contrary to a widely pronounced assessment (including by experts) according to
which the epidemic was well under control until September, the reproduction rate
rose to ρ ≈ 1.3 already in July and the first half of August. Only the low level of
daily new infections, reached in late May, covered up the expanding tendency and
gave the impression of a negligible increase. After a short lowering interlude about
mid August the rise came back in late August with ρ ≈ 1.2, before it accelerated in
late September, brought the reproduction rate to about 1.5, and led straight into
the second wave. Here the weekly oscillations of recorded new infections rose to an
amplitude not conceived before (fig. 20). The levels of the mean daily strength of
infection used in the model (proportional to the corresponding reproduction rates)
are well discernible in the next figure 19, right.

The dates tj of the time markers kj used for our model in the German case are

here teod = 01/15, 2021. In the country day count, where t0 = 1 (∼ 35 in JHU
day count) the main intervals are J0 = [1, 27], J1 = [29, 59], J2 = [62, 100], J3 =
[103, 108]; J4 = [113, 128], J5 = [132, 165], J6 = [175, 179], J7 = [186, 207]; J8 =
[216, 241], J9 = [250, 270], J10 = [278, 285], J11 = [294, 326]. The strength of
infection and reproduction numbers in the main intervals are given in the following
table.

With these parameters the SEPAR model reproduces (pre- or better “post”-dicts)
the averaged daily new infections and the total number of reported infected well (fig.
21), while one has to be more careful for treating the reported number of actual
infected Â.
If one checks the mean duration of being recorded as actual case in the JHU
statistics for Germany by eq. (12) one finds a good approximation q ≈ 15 after the
early phase; but the result also indicates that in May/June, and again in the second
half of November, the reported duration of the infected state surpassed this value
(fig. 22 left). Accordingly the empirical data Â and the corrected ones Âq (q = 15)
drop apart in late November (same figure, right).

France. The overall picture of the epidemic in France (population 66 M) is similar
to other European countries. But the French JHU data show anomalies which are
not found elsewhere: The differences of two consecutive values of the confirmed
cases, which ought to represent the number of newly reported, is sometime negative!
This happens in particular in the early phase of the epidemic (until June 2020)
where, e.g., Ânew (58) = −2206, and there are other days with negative entries.
Presumably this is due to ex-post data corrections necessary in the first few months
of the epidemic. Later on the control over the documented data seems to have been
improved; negative values are avoided, although null entries in Ânew still appear. So
the French data are a particular challenge to any modelling approach. Even in this
extreme case the smoothing by 7-day sliding averages works well, as shown in fig.
26.
Another surprising feature of the French (JHU) statistics is an amazing increase
in the number of days which infected persons are being counted as “actual cases”.
It starts close to 15, but shows a monotonous increase until late October where
a few downward outliers appear, before the curve turns moderately down in early
November 2020 (fig. 27, left).
As a consequence the peak of the first wave in early April (clearly visible in the
number of newly reported) is suppressed in the curve of the actual infected; Â(k)

has no local maximum in the whole period of our report. It even continues to rise,
although with a reduced slope, after the second peak of the daily newly reported,
Ânew , in early November. The decrease of the slope of Â starts shortly after this
peak, accompanied by a local maximum of the q-corrected values for the actual
infected reaches Âq (fig. 27). Both effects seem to be due to a downturn of q̂(k)
. This extreme behaviour of the data cannot be ascribed to medical reasons; quite
obviously it results from a high degree of uncertainty in data taking and recording
in the French health system.
The reproduction numbers are shown in figure 28, left. For the determination of
the daily strength of infection we have to fix a value for the dark factor. Lacking
data from representative serological studies in France we assume that it is larger
than in Switzerland and choose as a reference value for the model δ = 4. With
this value the determination of the η̂7 (k) are given in figure 28, right, here again
with dashed black markers for the periods modelled by constancy intervals in our
approach.

Sweden. Sweden (population 10 M) has chosen a path of its own for containing
Covid-10, significantly different from most other European countries. In the first
half year of the epidemic no general lockdown measures were taken; the general
strategy consisted in advising the population to reduce personal contacts and to go
into self-quarantine, if somebody showed symptoms which indicate an infection with
the SARS-CoV-2 virus. One might assume that the number of undetected infected,
the dark sector, could be larger than in other European countries. As we see below
such a hypothesis is not supported by the analysis of the data in the framework of
our model.
Under the conditions of the country (in particular the relative low population
density in Sweden) the first wave of the epidemic was fairly well kept under control,

if we abstain from discussing death rates like in the rest of this paper. Once the
initial phase was over (with reproduction numbers already lower than in comparable
countries, but still up to about ρ ≈ 2), the reproduction rate was close to 1 for about
two weeks in late June, and even lower in early July (fig. 32, right). In the second
half of October 2020, however, Sweden was hit by a second wave like all other
European countries. After a sharp rise of the daily new infections in early October
(fig. 32, left), the Swedish government decided to decree a (partial) lockdown. By
this the reproduction number, which already in late August had risen to above 1.2
and went up to 1.45 in mid October, was brought down to the former range (ρ ≈ 1),
although now on a much higher level of actual infected than during the first wave.

The higher the assumptions for the dark sector, the larger the calculated values
for η̂(k) on the basis of the same data, and vice versa. Figure 33 shows the differences of η̂7 (k) in the case of Sweden under the hypotheses δ = 0, 4, 15, 25.

Until July/August 2020 the four curves show minor differences and indicate relative
stable values for the infection strengths leading to reproduction rates close to 1. In
September/October the values rose considerably; they went down after the October
lockdown only under the assumption of a small dark sector, δ = 0 or 4, while for the
larger dark factors δ = 15, 25 the values of the daily strength of infection continues
to increase. This seems implausible.7 We therefore choose δ = 4 also for Sweden.

for Sweden, assuming different dark factors δ. Top: δ = 0 (left) and

In our definition the new infections in Sweden ceased to be sporadic at t0 = 03/02,
2020, the day 41 in the JHU day count. After a month of strong ups and downs of the
strength of infection, the approach of constancy intervals gains traction; with time
markers of the main intervals t1 = 03/31, t2 = 05/17, t3 = 06/18, t4 = 07/17, t5 =
08/25, t6 = 10/10, t7 = 11/05, t8 = 12/12, end of data teod = 12/30, 2020. In the
country count the main intervals are J0 = [1, 29], J1 = [30, 75], J2 = [77, 99], J3 =
[109, 126]; J4 = [138, 169], J5 = [177, 218], J6 = [223, 214], J7 = [223, 284], J8 =
[286, 303].
7Such

a hypothesis for the dark sector could be explained only by a drastic and irresponsible
change of contact behaviour of the Swedish population or an increased infectivity of the virus.
Neither of these explanations is supported by available empirical evidence.

Although one might want to refine the constancy intervals, already these intervals
lead to a fairly good model reconstruction of the mean motion of new infections
and the total number of infected (fig. 34). Note that since early September the
reported numbers of new infections show strong weekly oscillations between null at
the weekends and high peaks in the middle of the week.

Total number of reported infected (brown); empirical Âtot solid, model
Atot dashed.
The JHU statistics does not register recovered people for Sweden at all; only
deaths are reported. In consequence the usual interpretation of (9) as characterizing
the “actual” infected breaks down for Sweden8 and the estimation (11) for the mean
duration of illness becomes meaningless (fig. 35, left). An indication of the extent of
reported actual diseased is given by the q-corrected number Âq (same figure, right).
In this sense, the synopsis with a collection of the “3 curves” can be given for
Sweden like for any other country (fig. 37). Of course the model reproduces the
empirical values Â(k) even in such an extreme case if the time dependent empirical
values of (11) are used for the the model calculation, q(k) = q̂(k), while it reconstructs the q-corrected numbers for the estimate of actually infected Âq (k) if the
respective constant is used, here q = 15 (fig. 36).

3.2. The three most stricken regions: USA, Brazil, India. In this section
we give a short analysis of the course of the pandemic during 2020 for the three
countries which have to bemoan the largest numbers of deceased and huge numbers
of infected (USA, Brazil, India). We expected higher dark factors δ than for the European countries discussed above and checked this expectation by the same heuristic
approach as used for Sweden, i.e. by a comparative judgement of the changes of
the empirically determined strength of infection η̂7 (k), which result from different
assumptions of the values for δ. To our surprise we found no clear evidence for an
overall larger dark factor for the USA than for the European countries and work here
with δ = 4, while for India there are strong indications of a large dark factor which
we estimate as δ ≈ 35 (see below). For Brazil we consider δ ≈ 8 a reasonable choice
for the overall development of the epidemic. Don’t forget, however, that all these are
plausibility considerations which are not based on representative serological studies.
USA. At the beginning of the pandemics the United States of America (population
333 M) suffered a rapid rise of infections with an initial reproduction rate well
above 5. In early April 2020 this dynamics was broken and a slow decrease started
for about 2 months. In mid June a second wave with an upswing for about a
month and a reproduction rate shortly below 1.3 followed. In late August and early
September the subsequent downswing faded out. After a short phase of indecision
the beginnings of a third wave became clearly visible; it lasted until (at least) mid
December. Figure 38 shows the daily new infections, the reproduction rate ρ̂(k)
determined from the JHU data and the strength of infection η̂7 (k) assuming δ = 4 .
Figure 39 displays three variants of η̂7 (k) for δ = 0, 4, 8. The third one shows an
implausible increase for the strength of infection at the end of the year, which would
seem reasonable only if one of the new, more aggressive mutants of the virus had
started to spread in the USA in September 2020 already. Without further evidence
we do not assume such a strong case. As δ = 0 contradicts all evidences collected on
unreported infected, we choose δ = 4 for the SEPARd model of the USA. Also here
we find a moderate increase of the mean level of the η̂7 . To judge whether this may
be due to the inconsiderate behaviour of part of the US population (supporters of
the outgoing president) or the first influences of a virus mutation and/or still other
factors is beyond the scope if this paper and our competence.
In section 2 it was already noted that the estimation of the time of sojourn in
the “actual” state of infectivity, suggested by the statistics for the USA, leads to
surprising effects. It rises from about 15 in March 2020 to above 100 in early
November, with a moderate platform in between; then it starts falling,before it
makes an abrupt jump (fig 40, left). The jump of q̂(k) is an artefact of a change
in the record keeping: from December 14, 2020 onward the reporting of data of

Figure 40. Left: Daily values of the mean time of statistically actual
(“active”) infection q̂(k) for USA. Right: Empirical data (JHU) for
statistically actual cases Â(k) (dark blue) versus q-corrected ones,
q = 15, Âq (k) (bright blue) for the USA.
The main (constancy) intervals of the model are visible in the graph of the daily
strength of infection η̂7 (k) in fig. 38, bottom right. The dates of the time marker
between the intervals are: t0 = 02/29 2020; t1 = 04/02, t2 = 06/10, t3 = 07/19, t4 =
09/04, t5 = 10/21 t6 = 11/11, end of data teod = 12/30. Expressed in terms of the
country day count with k0 = 1 (∼ 39 in the JHU day count) the main intervals for the
USA are: J0 = [1, 33], J1 = [34, 92], J2 = [103, 118], J3 = [142, 185], J4 = [189, 222],
J5 = [236, 249], J6 = [257, 322].
The start parameter for the strength of infection η0 and a slightly adapted choice
of parameter values ηj inside the 1-sigma domain of the respective interval Jj are
given by the following table.

—
0.97 1.28 0.94 1.08 1.30 1.12
Here, as for the other countries, the ρj denote the model reproduction rates at the
beginning of the respective intervals. Assuming the dark factor δ = 4, the effective
reproduction rate ρ(k) changes considerably from the beginning of J6 until the end
of the year, s(11/11 2020) = 0.82 to s(12/31) = 0.67, (cf.fig. 41).
In consequence, the reproduction rate at the end of the year is down to ρ(12/31) =
0.86; and the newly reported infected are expected to reach a peak in late December
(fig. 42, right). Apparently this does not agree with the data, while the total
number of infections is well reproduced by the SEPARd model (same figure, left).
The difference for the new infected may be an indication that our estimate of the
dark factor δ is wrong or the strength of infection at the beginning of the new year
2021 is drastically boosted, e.g., by a rapid spread of a new, more aggressive mutant
of the virus.

7-day averages (red); empirical Ânew solid red, model new black dashed
(δ = 4).

As noted above, the recovered people are documented with increasingly large
time delays in the records for the USA. Therefore it seems preferable to compare
the model value of actually infected, A(k), with Âq (k) rather than with Â(k) (fig.
43). The empirical determined values of Âq (k) are shown in bright blue in the figure.
They are marked by three local maxima indicating the peak values of three waves
of the epidemics in the USA. These peaks are blurred in the graph of Â because too
many of the effectively redrawn are dragged along as acute cases in the statistics.
Due to under-reporting at the end of the year, the local extremum in December may
be fuzzier than it appears here. But keep in mind that the SEPARd model with
δ = 4 predicts a local maximum inside the interval J6 , if the contact behaviour and
the resulting strength of infectivity η6 do not change considerably.

By using time dependent values q(k), like, e.g., in the case of Germany, SEPARd
is able to model the statistically “actual” cases also here (fig. 44, right). Because
of the growing fictitiousness of the numbers Â(k) in the case of the USA we prefer,
however, to look at the corrected values Âq (k), as stated already.

of actual infected Â(k) was surpassed in early August 2020 with a decreasing phase
until late October, after which a second wave started (fig. 45 left). In contrast to
the USA we find here a comparatively stable estimate for the mean time q̂(k) ≈ 14
(fig. 45 right).

blue) in comparison with q-equalized number Âq (k) (bright blue) for
Brazil (q = 14). Right: Empricial estimate q̂(k) of mean duration of
active infective according to the statistics for Brazil.
The outlier peak of Â(k) about October 25 appears also as an exceptional peak
in the q̂(k). Apparently it is due to an interruption of writing-off actual infected
to the redrawn (compare fig. 51). Up to this exceptional phase there is a close
incidence between the Â(k) and the q-corrected number Âq (k). The minimum of
the mean square difference is acquired for q = 14. The numbers of newly reported
Ânew (k) show strong daily fluctuations which are smoothed by the 7-day sliding
average Ânew,7 (k) (fig. 46).
A comparison of different strengths of infection η̂7 (k) indicates a value between
δ = 0 and δ = 8 as a plausible choice (fig. 47). For higher values an unnatural
increase of the infection strength would appear close to the end of the year (if not
due to a new mutant. As we assume that in Brazil the dark factor is higher than in
European countries, we use δ = 8 as a plausible model hypothesis.
The daily reproduction numbers ρ̂(k) (independent of δ) start from a lower level
than for many other countries, slightly above 2. They show a relatively stable
downward trend, falling below 1 for a few days in early June and for longer periods
after June 22, 2020 (fig. 48, left). But already at the end of March, when the

Also here the ρj designate reproduction numbers at the beginning of the j-the
interval and the fall of s(k) makes the reproduction number cross the critical value
in the last main interval (cf. 49). This does not mean that it will stay there.
The resulting model curves and their relationship to the empirical data for new
infections and acual infections are shown in fig. 50. A panel of the three curves
Atot , A, R is shown in fig. 51. Here one sees clearly that the outlier bump of Â(k)
is accompanied by an inverse outlier in R̂(k).

India. The recorded data on Ânew (k) for India (population 1387 M) start to be
non-sporadic at t0 = March 4, 2020. From this time on we find a steady growth
of the number of reported actual infected Â(k) until early September. Because the
size of the country and the life conditions in large parts of it a comparatively high
number of unrecorded infected may be assumed, with a dark factor at the order of
magnitude δ ∼ 10 probably 20 ≤ δ ≤ 50.9 In early September the tide changed and
a nearly monotonous decline of actual infected started. With the exception of a short
intermediate dodge the decline continues at the end of 2020 (fig. 52, left). Although
in late December 2020 there were only about 0.7 % recorded infected in India, the
high quota of unreported infected poses the question whether the downturn in late
summer may already be due to a the decrease of the fraction of susceptibles s(k).
Before we discuss this point let us remark that the time of being statistically
recorded as actual case is relatively stable in the Indian data, with a good approximative constant value q ≈ 11 (fig. 52, right). In consequence Â(k) does not differ
much from Âq (k) (same fig. left). This allows to use the recorded data Â in the
following without the proviso to be made in the case of the USA.

The reproduction number fell rapidly from roughly 3.5 at the beginning to below
1.5 in early April, and 1.2 in late May, after which it continued to decrease with
minor fluctuations. In early September it dropped below the critical value 1, where
it stayed with few exceptional fluctuations until December (fig. 54). It runs, of
course, parallel to the daily strength of infection η̂(k) calculated from the 7-day
averages if abstraction is made from the dark sector, δ = 0 (fig. 55, left). Here we
confront it with the more realistic graph of η̂7 calculated under the assumption of a

figure, right). Here one finds a daily strength of infection moderately fluctuating
in a narrow band between 10 and 20 % above the critical value ηcrit = 71 ≈ 0.147,
rather than dropping below it in early September like in the first case. We do not
know of any indications for a changing contact behaviour of the population in India;
neither can we assume a decreasing aggressiveness of the virus. Therefore the first
scenario (δ ≈ 0) looks highly unrealistic. In both cases the empirically determined
reproduction rates ρ̂(k) are the same (fig. 54). In the second case the fall of ρ̂(k)
below 1 in early September is due to the lowering of ŝ(k), i.e. as an effect of an
incipient herd immunization.
But how can that be with a herd immunization quota of (1 + δ) ÂtotN(k) ≈ 12 %,
even with δ = 35, in September 2020?10 The reason lies in the comparatively low
overall daily strength of infection. Between May and December 2020 it fluctuated
between 10 and 20 % above the critical level (fig. 55, right). Even if part of the low
level had to be ascribed to an intentional under-reporting of the Ânew (k), this would
mean an increasing size of the dark sector; the overall effect would be the same.11
For modelling the epidemic in India we can do with 7 constancy intervals. After
the initial interval J0 = [1, 30] in the day count of the country (k0 ∼ 43 in the JHU
count) the main intervals are J1 = [31, 70], J2 = [74, 137], J3 = [142, 161], J4 =
[169, 179], J5 = [191, 228], J6 = [234, 256], J7 = [260, keod ], with end of data keod =
297. The date of the interval separators are t0 = 03/04, t1 = 04/03, t2 = 05/16,
t3 = 07/23, t4 = 08/19, t5 = 09/10, t6 = 10/23, t7 = 11/18, end of data teod = 12/26
2020.
10In

12/2020 it was already twice as much.
a permanently increasing amount of under-reporting could emulate a fake picture of a
non-existing downswing of the epidemic for several months. We exclude such a hypothesis.

Similar to the Brazilian case, the reproduction rate surpasses 1 in the first four
main intervals; only in mid September a downswing of the epidemic started, interrupted by an intermediate dodge at the beginning of November. In mid September
the total number of acknowledged infected was roughly Atot (240) ≈ 5 M , about 3.8
per mill of the total population; but with a dark quota of δ = 35 the total number
of infected had probably already risen above the 10 % margin (see above).
The start parameter of the model η0 is chosen according to the best adaptation to
the 7-day averaged data (without a claim for a directly realistic interpretation) and
the parameter values ηj essentially as the mean values of the η̂(k) in the respective
interval Jj . They are given in the table.

3.3. Aggregated data of the World. Let us now see how the aggregated data of
all countries and territories documented in the JHU data resource can be analysed
in our framework, and how they are reproduced by the SEPARd model. For the
sake of simplicity we speak simply of the World. The number of daily new infections
Ânew shows clearly three or four steps, expressed by phases of accelerated growth of
Ânew between February and December 2020 (fig. 59): March (European countries),
May to July (two waves in the US, bridged by rising numbers in Brazil and India),
October (second wave in Europe and Brazil, third wave in US), and less visible the
January/February wave in China and South-Korea.

and use the following time separators for the main (constancy) intervals t1 = 03/29,

Right: Total number of reported infected (brown); empirsolid, model Atot dashed.

Because of the lack of reliable reporting for recovering dates in several countries,
among them some large ones like the USA, we cannot expect a balanced value for
the sojourn in the state of actual disease, documented in the statistics. Fig. 62,
left shows that the estimated values q̂ keeps close to 15 or even 20 until late March.
Later on the weight of the countries with reliable documentation of recovering dates
is large enough to keep the mean number of q̂(k) between 30 and 40, even with
the rise of the pandemic after May 2020 (fig. 62, left). Accordingly the q-corrected
number of actually infected Âq separate from the the ones given directly by the
statistics Â(k) only in mid April. Since October 2020 they difference between the
two is rising progressively (same figure, right).

4. Discussion
The data evaluation in sec. 3 shows clearly that the SEPARd model works well for
countries or territories with widely differing conditions and courses of the epidemic.
For the “tautological” application of the model with daily changing coefficients of
infection η(k) this is self-evident, while it is not so for the use of a restricted number
of constancy intervals. The examples studied in this paper show that in this mode
of application the model is well-behaved, able to characterize the mean motion of an
epidemic and to analyse its central dynamic. In the country studies we have shown
that this is the case not only for the number of acknowledged daily new reported,
our Anew (k) but also for data which, in the standard SIR approach, are not easily
interpretable like the number of actual infected persons, A(k)or the q-normalized
number Aq (k).
What is the SEP ARd model good for? It is clear that it cannot predict the
future. The main reason for this is that nobody knows how the contact rates are
changing in the future. It allows – though – a prediction under assumptions. In the
different countries we carried this out with different scenarios.
The main value of the model is as a tool for analysing the development, and to
learn from such an analysis. We will discuss three such topics:
– the role of constancy intervals
– the role of the dark sector
– the influence of the time between infection and quarantine
The role of constancy intervals. The empirical values of the infection strength η̂(k)
are calculated from data on reported new infected and are therefore subject to irregularities in data taking and reporting. The most drastic consequences of this
are the obvious weekly fluctuations. Different methods can be applied to smooth
these weekly fluctuation, sliding 7-day averages (used here), stochastic estimate
used by the RKI (see appendix), band filter etc. Independent of the applied method
there remain effects (e.g. non- weekly reporting delays) which distort the calculated
numbers away from being correct empirical values for the intended quantities (e.g.
η(k) = γκ(k)). Even if they were, one would encounter day to day fluctuations
resulting from the variation of intensities of contacts and of the strengths of infectiousness involved, which one is not really interested in if one wants to gain insight
into the dynamics of the epidemic. For this one needs to distil a cross-sectional
picture of the process. In our approach this is achieved by constructing constancy
intervals (main intervals) Jj and model strengths of infection ηj , read off from the
data, and to apply the infection recursion (5).
The role of the dark sector. With increasing numbers of herd immunized, the influence of the dark sector on the ratio s(k) of susceptibles in the total population

M. KRECK, E. SCHOLZ

60

gains increasing weight, in particular for countries in which a high dark ratio δ may
be expected. In most of the European countries studied here we find the ratio of
recorded infected at the order of magnitude of 1 % all over the year 2020. With
the non-reported ones added it can easily rise to the order of magnitude 10 % and
start to have visible effects. If our estimated values of the dark factor δ are not
utterly wrong, our model calculation shows that in nearly all countries of the study,
Germany being the only exception, the development of the epidemic is already noticeably influenced by the dark sector at the beginning of the year 2021. The latter
contributes essentially to turning the tide of the reported new infected, if one assumes constant contact ratios κ(k) and mean infection strength γ of the virus. Of
course the appearance of new mutants may change γ, and counteract the decrease of
the numbers of infected predicted by the model. This seems to be the main problem
for the early months of 2021.

Figure 64. Ratio of susceptibles s(k) = S(k)/N for Germany
(dashed) and Switzerland (solid line) at the end of the year 2020,
assuming a dark ratio δ = 2 for Switzerland and δ = 1 for Germany.
This becomes particularly succinct by a comparing the Swiss situation with Germany at the end of the year 2020 (fig. 64). In both countries containment measures
were taken after a rise of the reproduction rate to 1.4 to 1.5 in late September /early
October, although with different degrees of resoluteness and results (figs. 10, 19).
The weight of the dark sector is much stronger for the non-European countries of
our study. In the case of the USA and Brazil it has started to suppress the effective
reproduction number below the critical value 1, according to our model assumptions
on the dark factor. But even if one would set it dowm to δ = 1 or 2 the effect would
already occur, although a bit later and weaker. That this is not yet reflected in the
numbers of newly infected may have different reasons; one of it would, of course be,
that the model can no longer be trusted in this region. Others have been mentioned
in the country section. And finally it could be that persons infected some months
ago need not necessarily be immune against a second attack. If virologists come to

SEPAR – COVID-19

61

this conclusion, the whole model structure would need a revision. At the moment
it is too early to envisage such a drastic step.
The influence of the time between infectivity and quarantine. A central input into
the SEP ARd model is the assumption that there is a rather short period of length
pc , where people, who later are positively tested, are infectious. This is closely
related to the fact that people with positive test results are sent to quarantine or
hospital. One can wonder what would happen, if the time between infectivity and
quarantine or hospital is changed.
It is a bit confusing, but there are two answers to this question. To explain the
difference we recall the role of pc in our model. We usually derive the η parameters from the data (eq. 15). For the reproduction number (17) in the simplified
SEP ARd -model with pc = pd = p and a constant coefficient η this means:
η
η
ρ(k) = p η s(k) = (pc + pd ) s(k)
2
2
Here we assume that pc is given. This number is only a rough estimate and may be
chosen slightly differently. So, for each choice of the estimated number pc one gets
model curves and one might ask, how much these model curves differ, in particular
how much the reproduction rates would differ. The answer is: not very much. The
reason is that pc enters implicitly also in the formula (14) for η, since the denominator
is a sum over pc values of the daily newly infected. If we assume that this number is
constant (which often is approximately the case) then in the denominator we would
have the factor pc and in the formula for ρ it cancels out. Thus in this situation the
reconstruction of ρ from pc and η is independent of the choice of pc . If the values
of the newly infected changes more drastically this is not the case and one has to
use the general formula (16), but the difference is not dramatic. So the first answer
to the question is: A different estimation for pc does not have a noticeable influence
for the model curves.
For understanding the second very different answer we have to recall that η may
be interpreted as the product of the contact rate κ (as measured in the model)
and the strength of the infection γ. If we assume that γ is constant, the change of
pc discussed above amounts to a change of the model-κ, which does not express a
changing contact behaviour. This means that our measure for the contact rate is
related to our choice of pc .
Now we come to the second answer. Here we assume that the contact rate remains
the same, the contact behaviour of the society is not changed. But suppose that by
some new regulations the value of pc is changed. Then, as expected, if the contact
behaviour is unchanged the reproduction number changes proportionally and so the
curves are different. This second answer is what we are interested in here. Let us
assume that one finds means by which the time until the people go to quarantine or

M. KRECK, E. SCHOLZ

62

hospital is reduced. Then less contacts take place and so the curves are flattened.
This fact is well known, e.g., [2, appendix].12 But how much?
For answering this question we have taken the model description for Germany,
lowering the value of pc from 7 to 6 days from a certain moment on. Here we have
to discuss an important point. One can only influence the time until quarantine or
hospital for those who are registered, while the infected people who end up in the
dark sector behave as before. At this moment we have to give up our assumption
that pc = pd . So, from a certain moment on we assume that pd is still 7 but pc is 6.
We have carried this out in two different scenarios for the expected numbers of
daily new recorded infected Anew (k) and the numbers of actual infected A(k). In the
first one we compare the past development in Germany during the year 2020 with a
fictitious reduction of pc from 7 to 6 during May 2020, keeping pd = 7 fixed (fig. 65).
In a second one we take a look into the future, perpetuating the contact rate of the
last constancy interval, i.e., assuming that the contact behaviour of the population
is unchanged for a while and assume the same fictitious reduction as above in the
second half of January 2021 (fig. 66). This doesn’t mean that we make a prediction

lower pc from 7 to 6. The lowering of the numbers of infected, newly recorded and
actual ones, are very impressive.

In the past none of the regulations imposed by the German federal authorities
made an attempt to reduce the time until people got to quarantine or hospital aside
from raising the number of tests. Our considerations suggest to make a serious attempt in this direction. It has the big advantage that it does not require additional

Appendix
Comparison with RKI reproduction numbers . The estimates of the reproduction
numbers for Germany by the Robert Koch Institut (RKI), Berlin, are based on an
approach using the generation time as crucial delay time. The generation time τg of
an epidemic is defined as the mean time interval between a primary infection and
the secondary infections induced by the first one; similarly the length τs of the serial
interval as the mean time between the onset of symptoms of a primary infected and
the symptom onset of secondary cases. There are various methods to determine
time dependent effective reproduction numbers on the basis of stochastic models for
infections using both intervals. In our simplified approach with constant e and p
these numbers correspond to τg = τs = e + p−1
.

The RKI calculation uses a method of its own for a stochastic estimation of the
numbers of newly infected, called E(t), from the raw data of newly reported cases,
described in [1]. The calculation of the reproduction numbers works with these
E(t) and assumes constant generation time and serial intervals of equal lengths

τg = τs = 4 [17].13 Two versions of reproduction numbers are being used, a dayE(t)
sharp and therefore “sensitive” one ρrki, 1 (t) = E(t−4)
, and a weekly averaged one,
P6
j=0 E(t − j)
ρrki, 7 (t) = P6
,
j=0 E(t − 4 − j)
which we refer to in the following simply as ρrki (t).
The paper remarks that the RKI reproduction numbers (“R-values”) ρrki (u) indexed by the date u of calculation refer to a period of infection which, after taking the
incubation period ι between 4 and 6 days into account, lies between u − 16, . . . , u − 8
(with central day u − 12 in the interval). We reformulate this redating by setting
P6
j=0 E(t − j)
,,
(18)
ρ̂rki (t − 12) = P6
E(t

j=0
For a comparison with the SEPAR reproduction numbers we write (17) as
p P6
j=0 Ânew (k − j)

ρ̂(k − (e + p + 3))) = Pp−1
,
Â
(k

(e

j=0
which for e = 2, p = 7 boils down to
P6
ρ̂(k − 12)) = P6

j=0

j=0

Ânew (k − j)

Ânew (k − 4 − j)

.

This is very close to (18). The main differences lie in the usage of different raw data
bases (RKI versus JHU) and the adjustment of the raw data (stochastic redistribution E(t) versus sliding 7-day averages Ânew,7 ). This may explain the differences in
the level of low or high plateaus shown in fig. 67 (with 1 day additional time shift).
In this sense, our model supports the claim of the RKI that their reproduction
numbers can be used as indicators of “a trend analysis of the epidemic curve” [17,
p.1].

e = 2 this would correspond to p = 5, while for τg = τs = 5 we arrive at our p = 7.
