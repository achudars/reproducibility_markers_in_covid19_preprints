Abstract
The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19),
emerged late December 2019 in China, is now
rapidly spreading across the globe. At the time of
writing this paper, the number of global confirmed
cases has passed two millions and half with over
180,000 fatalities. Many countries have enforced
strict social distancing policies to contain the spread
of the virus. This have changed the daily life of tens
of millions of people, and urged people to turn their
discussions online, e.g., via online social media
sites like Twitter. In this work, we describe the
first Arabic tweets dataset on COVID-19 that we
have been collecting since January 1st, 2020. The
dataset would help researchers and policy makers
in studying different societal issues related to the
pandemic. Many other tasks related to behavioral
change, information sharing, misinformation and
rumors spreading can also be analyzed.

Introduction
On December 31, 2019, Chinese public health authorities
reported several cases of a respiratory syndrome caused by
an unknown disease, which subsequently became known
as COVID-19 in the city of Wuhan, China. This highly
contagious disease continued to spread worldwide, leading
the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare a global
health emergency on January 30, 2020. On March 11, 2020
the disease has been identified as pandemic by WHO, and
many countries around the world including Saudi Arabia,
United States, United Kingdom, Italy, Canada, and Germany have continued reporting more cases of the disease
(World Health Organization and others 2020). As the time
of writing this paper, this pandemic is affecting more than
208 countries around the globe with more than one million
and half confirmed cases (World Health Organization 2020).
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, many governments
around the world enforced different measures to contain the
spread of the virus. The measures include travel restrictions,
curfews, ban of mass gatherings, social distancing, and probably cities lock-down. This has impacted the routine of
people around the globe, and many of them have turned to

social media platforms for both news and communication.
Since the emergence of COVID-19, Twitter platform plays
a significant role in crisis communications where millions
of tweets related to the virus are posted daily. Arabic is the
official language of more than 22 countries with nearly 300
million native speakers worldwide. Furthermore, there is a
large daily Arabic content in Twitter as millions of Arabic
users use the social media network to communicate. For
instance, Saudi Arabia alone has nearly 15 million Twitter
users as of January, 2020 (Statista 2020). Hence, it is important to analyze the Arabic users’ behavior and sentiment during this pandemic. Other Twitter COVID-19 datasets have
been recently proposed (Chen, Lerman, and Ferrara 2020;
Lopez, Vasu, and Gallemore 2020) but with no significant
content for the Arabic language.
In this work, we provide the first dataset dedicated to
Arabic tweets related to COVID-19. The dataset is available at https://github.com/SarahAlqurashi/
COVID-19-Arabic-Tweets-Dataset.
We have
been collecting data in real-time from Twitter API since
January 1, 2020, by tracking COVID-19 related keywords
which resulted in more than 3,934,610 Arabic tweets so far.
The presented dataset is believed to be helpful for both researchers and policy makers in studying the pandemic from
social perspective, as well as analyzing the human behaviour
and information spreading during pandemics.
In what follows, we describe the dataset and the collection methods, present the initial data statistics, and provide
information about how to use the dataset.

Dataset Description
We collected COVID-19 related Arabic tweets from January
1, 2020 until April 15, 2020, using Twitter streaming API
and the Tweepy Python library. We have collected more than
3,934,610 million tweets so far. In our dataset, we store the
full tweet object including the id of the tweet, username,
hashtags, and geolocation of the tweet.
We created a list of the most common Arabic keywords
associated with COVID-19. Using Twitters streaming API,
we searched for any tweet containing the keyword(s) in the
text of the tweet. Table 1 shows the list of keywords used
along with the starting date of tracking each keyword. Furthermore, Table 2 shows the list of hashtags we have been
tracking along with the number of tweets collected from

each hashtag. Indeed, some tweets were irrelevant, and we
kept only those that were relevant to the pandemic.

Table 1: The list of keywords that we used to collect the
tweets.
A summary over the dataset is given in Table 3. While
collecting data, we have observed that the number of
retweets increased significantly in late March. This is likely
due to the exponential increase in confirmed COVID-19
cases worldwide, including the Arabic speaking countries.
A relatively small percentage of tweets were geotagged. Figure 1 presents the location of tweets observed as of 14 April
2020.

page.

Future Work
We are continuously updating the dataset to maintain more
aspects of COVID-19 Arabic conversations and discussions
happening on Twitter. We also plan to study how different groups respond to the pandemic and analyze information
sharing behavior among the users.
