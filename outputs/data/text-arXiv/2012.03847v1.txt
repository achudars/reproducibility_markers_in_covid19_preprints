Abstract: The purpose of this study has extremely dedicated to
expose the correlation between coronavirus pandemic and space
observation on unhealthy air quality in India. The world has
undergone in lockdown to break the chain of corona virus infection.
The Air Quality Index (AQI) has started to improve after the
commencement of lockdown due to industrial and transportation
sectors temporally closed. This study compiled the data recently
released by NASA (National Aeronautics and Space
Administration), ESA (European Space Agency) and ISRO (Indian
Space and Research Organization). In this paper, we have discussed
about the space observation on Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), Aerosol
Optical Depth (AOD), PM2.5, and PM10 influenced the air quality
across the various region of India. We analyzed the detoxing of air
quality before and during the lockdown period over the same time
frame of current and the previous year. The result has shown the
positive impact on the detoxing of unhealthy air quality during
lockdown stated as the emission of NO2 has reduced to 40% - 50%
and optical level of aerosol indexed at low compared to the last 20
years in northern India.

I. INTRODUCTION
This The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the
COVID-19 as a global pandemic across the world, was the first
case acknowledged in the Wuhan city, China in late December
2019 (Chen et al., 2020; WHO, 2020). The human to human
transmission properties of coronavirus becomes a critical
situation to control overspreading the infection. As of March 7,
2020, a total of 212 countries and territories around the world
have got affected with 3,834,142 confirmed cases and 265,240
deaths (Countries where Coronavirus has spread Worldometer, n.d.). The clinical characteristics of COVID-19
have initial symptoms included as fever, cough, dyspnea,
myalgia or fatigue, sputum production, headache, hemoptysis,
and diarrhea (Jiang et al., 2020). The fatality rate of COVID-19
in Italy and China is similar, approximately 2-3% (Porcheddu et
al., 2020). The coronavirus has covered all the major cities of
China very quickly and explored more than 20 countries on
January 30, 2020. By the analysis of the COVID-19 influencing
rates and death rates, the China government has declared the
Wuhan city under quarantine on January 23, 2020 (Muhammad
et al., 2020) , and subsequently, the whole country also falls
under lockdown to slow down the affection. The isolation,
quarantine, social distancing, and community containment are a
powerful way to break the chain of human to human

transmission of coronavirus (Wilder-Smith & Freedman, 2020).
The worldwide public health emergency was declared by WHO
on January 30, 2020.
The Ministry of Health & Family Welfare of India has
confirmed the COVID-19 pandemic was reported on January 30,
2020, in Kerala, India (PIB Delhi, 2020). Maharashtra is now the
most affected state of COVID-19 confirmed cases and the
second most affected state in Gujarat. As on June 07, 2020,
01:44 AM IST, the total confirmed 2,46,622 cases, 1,20,968
active cases, 1,18,695 recovered (including 1 migration) and
6,946 people deaths in the country (Coronavirus Outbreak in
India - covid19india.org, 2020; MoHFW | Home, n.d.). The
Indian government also committed to taking all necessary
actions to outbreak the spreading of coronavirus. The public
curfew for 14-hours was declared on March 22, 2020, when the
number of positive cases crossed 500 in India. Approximately,
1.3 billion people of India imported a self-imposed quarantine
for 14 hours to save the nation (India coronavirus: Millions
under lockdown as major cities restrict daily life - CNN, n.d.).
The prime minister of India announced the completely nationwide lockdown for 21-days (25 March – 14 April) on March 24,
2020, to stay the 136 million people at home (India, Day 1:
World’s Largest Coronavirus Lockdown Begins - The New York
Times, n.d.). After completion of lockdown 1.0, the Prime
Minister Narendra Modi announced that India remains in
lockdown till May 3, 2020, fall in lockdown 2.0 (In coronavirus
lockdown extension, Modi wields stick, offers carrot on exit
route - Coronavirus Outbreak News, n.d.). The Government of
India (GoI) and Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) have extended
the period of lockdown for two weeks till May 17, 2020,
announced on May 1, 2020 and lockdown 3.0 going on (India
Lockdown Extension News: Lockdown extended by 2 weeks,
India split into red, green and orange zones - The Economic
Times, n.d.).
Due to the lockdown in the whole country, public
transportation services (either road or air) and industrial services
are finally stopped excluding emergency services such as
medical. The health advisors are also recommended to the
people to stay safe and stay at home. According to the CNNreport, the airplane passengers have dropped traveling up to 96%
due to coronavirus pandemic (Airlines and TSA report 96% drop
in air travel - CNNPolitics, n.d.).
The Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology,
Government of India launched smartphone-based application
“Aarogya Setu”, available at Google Play Store (for Android
phones) and Apple App Store (for ioS) (Aarogya Setu Mobile

App | MyGov.in, n.d.). This application continuously monitors
someone tested as corona positive and quickly notifies the users.
The tracking functionality is done through Bluetooth and GPSbased location services (aarogya setu app: How to use Aarogya
Setu app and find out if you have coronavirus symptoms - The
Economic Times, n.d.).
The contribution of our work is to assess the quality of air
including the primary pollutants in the atmosphere during
COVID-19 fatality in India. This work is accomplished with
regards to NASA Earth Science Data (Earthdata, n.d.), Giovanni
(Giovanni, n.d.), ISRO (Indian Space and Research Origination)
and European Space Agency (European Space Agency, n.d.).
The remaining sections of this paper are arranged as the second
section contains related studies, Community Mobility Report
mentioned in the third section, the assessment of air quality
observation described in the fourth section and discussion and
conclusion are in the fifth section.

pollutants nitric acid (HNO3) and ozone (O3) (Khoder, 2002).
The WHO has intentionally advised that instance of polluted airs
including NO2, SO2, O3, and particulate matters are responsible
for significantly affect human health (Air pollution and health Air Pollution - Environmental Policy - UNECE, n.d.).
III. COMMUNITY MOBILITY REPORT DURING COVID-19
PANDEMIC IN INDIA
Google has released the report on community mobility from
March 21, 2020, to May 02, 2020 (COVID-19 Community
Mobility Reports, n.d.). This comparison report is based on
traveling and staying days at different places, compared with the
baseline period for five weeks (January 3, 2020 – February 6,
2020). The reported community places are marked noted as
Grocery & pharmacy, Parks, Transit stations, Retail &
recreation, Residential, and Workplaces. The community
mobility report on alphabetically order from the top five states
and also in overall India is presented in figure 1 (COVID-19
Community Mobility Reports, n.d.).

II. RELATED STUDIES
One of the famous English quotes stated by Billy Graham
“When wealth is lost, nothing is lost; when health is lost,
something is lost; when the character is lost, all is lost”. The
COVID-19 has made the nastiest crisis and horrific effect on
human health and the world economy. However, the positive
side of environmental pollution due to the limited exercise of
transportation and industrial sectors (Dutheil et al., 2020). The
transportation sector is an extremely impressive source of
Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) for environmental pollution (He et al.,
2020). The emission of global carbon dioxide (CO2) in the
world (2020), has also reduced to 0.3% to 1.2% (The
Coronavirus Outbreak Is Curbing China’s CO2 Emissions IEEE Spectrum, n.d.). Analysis of the consumption rate of coal
and crude oil for two week period, the emission of CO2 has
reduced to 25% predominantly in China and 6% globally
(Analysis: Coronavirus temporarily reduced China’s CO2
emissions by a quarter, n.d.). The quality of air directly
influences the human health and immune system, also
responsible for respiratory diseases such as asthma, chronic
obstructive pulmonary
disease (COPD), pulmonary fibrosis,
pneumonia, and lung cancer (Brauer, 2010). The burden of
disease data from 1990 to 2015 has analyzed at various factors
including global, regional, and country-based, we get
approximately 4·2 million human deaths and 103·1 million
human lost their healthy life in 2015 (Cohen et al., 2017). The
Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) has responsible for 3.6 million
humans life losses annually in European nations (Thematic
Strategy on air pollution (Text with EEA relevance), n.d.). The
United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reported
that 92% of the population of China experienced more 120-hour
unhealthy air and 1.6 million human deaths per year covered
17% of all deaths (Rohde & Muller, 2015). The long-term
emission of NO2 is statistically proportional to increasing
respiratory mortality (Beelen et al., 2008). The chemical
reactions among primary pollutants in the atmosphere are
responsible to generate the secondary pollutants i.e. very
harmful for human health such as acid rain, ground-level ozone,
etc. The conversion rate of NO2 and Sulfur dioxide (SO2) are
significant because of the source of some harmful secondary

IV. ASSESSING AIR QUALITY DURING THE LOCKDOWN IN
INDIA
Air pollution is a worldwide problem for both developing and
developed countries that affect human health. According to the
most recent World Air Quality Report from IQAir, the ten most
polluted cities in the world contain six Indian cities (India
dominates the list of the world’s most polluted cities | World
Economic Forum, n.d.). The WHO estimates that approximately
4.2 million people are dying due to the worst outdoor air
pollution (Air pollution, n.d.).
The ESA (European Space Agency), NASA (National
Aeronautics and Space Administration) and Indian Space
Research Organization (ISRO) released the considerable
evidence regarding the improvement of air quality in various
regions of India during the lockdown period using their weather
satellites. These satellites produced various satellite images
before and during the lockdown period. The contribution of

listed space agencies monitoring the air quality while lockdown
in India, described in the following sub-sections.
A. Copernicus Sentinel-5P satellite
Recently, the lockdown not only assists to break the chain of
spreading coronavirus but also responsible for the reduction of
NO2 concentrations across the major cities of India. The major
sources of NO2 in the atmosphere are industrial, transportation,
and power plant sectors. The satellite image produced using data
from Copernicus Sentinel-5P satellite, from the European Union
Copernicus program, shown that decline of seeing level around
40-50% during nationwide lockdown (ESA - Air pollution drops
in India following lockdown, n.d.). Figure 1 demonstrates the
comparison of NO2 concentrations between currently specified
periods and at the same time frame of last year. The current
period dated as before lockdown (January 01, 2020 – March 24,
2020) and during lockdown (March 25, 2020 – April 20, 2020)
compared with last year same period dated as (January 01, 2019
– March 24, 2019) and (March 25, 2019 – April 20, 2019)
respectively. The dark red color shows the highest emission and
white color marks show a low emission of NO2 in figure 2.

Fig. 2. Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) concentrations over India (ESA 2020,
n.d.).

We observed the negligible dissimilarity of emission before the
lockdown mentioned period compared with last year at the same
time frame. During the lockdown, the specified period got
interesting reducible up to 40-50% emission rate of NO2 as
released in last year. After the announcement of nationwide
lockdown on March 25, 2020, 136 million people resident at
their home and avoid the use of non-essential services like as
shops, markets and worship places were closed and only nonavoidable services such as water supply, electricity, medicals are
remaining active. Due to avoiding all types of non-essential
services are played the major roles in the reduction of NO2 in
the atmosphere
B. NASA’s Terra satellite
The NASA satellite produced the level of aerosol in northern
India, using data retrieved from Moderate Resolution Imaging
Spectroradiometer (MODIS) (MODIS Web, n.d.). The aerosol

level observed significantly low as compared to the last 20 years
record in northern India (Airborne Particle Levels Plummet in
Northern India, n.d.).
The industrial and transportation sectors are also responsible
for increasing the aerosol level in the atmosphere. The aerosol is
available in the form of liquid and solid and reduces the
visibility on the earth. This also makes a harmful effect on the
human lungs and hearts. The depth of aerosol does not exist in
hazy condition until its thickness occurs less than 0.1, but when
crossed 1 or more, the hazy condition arise. The AOD measures
the prevention rate of reaching the sunlight to the earth's surface.
The aerosol particles in the atmosphere help to block or scattered
the sunlight (ESRL Global Monitoring Laboratory - Global
Radiation and Aerosols, n.d.). The observation of Aerosol
Optical Depth (AOD) is shown in figure 3 over the last five
years (2016-2020).

Fig. 3. Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) level in Northern India(AOD in
India (2016-2020), n.d.).

The data has captured during the same periods from March
31, 2020, to April 5, 2020, for each year of 2016-2020. In figure
2, the first five maps have shown the spreading of AOD in India
over the years of 2016 to 2020. The last map shows AOD in
2020 of specified periods and compared with an average depth
of aerosol from 2016 to 2019. This is observed that AOD goes
down as compared to the average depth rates of the last five
years.
C. INSAT-3D
The ISRO launched INSAT-3D, an advanced weather
forecasting satellite that monitors the humidity and temperature
of the atmosphere for disaster management (INSAT-3D - ISRO,
n.d.). The AOD level, PM2.5 and PM10 have measured before
and during lockdown periods and satellite maps given in figure
4. The AOD including PM2.5 and PM10 has reduced in during

lockdown period (March 25, 2020 – April 05, 2020) compared
with before lockdown period (March 15, 2020- March 24, 2020).
The analysis of reduced rates of aerosol levels has been dropped
on the average of 28-40% overall country during lockdown
period (Space based observation on changes in Air Quality
during COVID-19 Lockdown period, n.d.). The air quality is
being improved and the sky gets back to its original color i.e.
bluer.

In figure 5, the first map presents the averaged time map of
NO2 spreading over India before the lockdown period (March
10, 2020 – March 24, 2020), and second last represents the
spreading map during the lockdown period (March 25, 2020 –
April 07, 2020).

Cloud Screened) over the before and during lockdown period.

lockdown period in India.

D. GIOVANNI – The Bridge between data and science
The NASA Goddard Earth Sciences (GES) Data and
Information Services Center (DISC) launched the web-based
application GIOVANNI (Giovanni, n.d.). This application
provides an interactive and simple way to visualize and analyze
the remote sensing data (GES DISC Tools: Giovanni, n.d.). The
multi-disciplinary areas such as Aerosols, Atmospheric
Chemistry, Atmospheric Dynamics, Cryosphere, Hydrology,
Ocean Biology, Oceanography, and Water and Energy Cycle are
integrated into the GIOVANNI platform. Various atmospheric
affecting parameter values such as Aerosol Optical Depth, Air
Temperature, CO2, Incident Radiation, NO2, SO2, SO4, Sea
Surface Temperature, UV Exposure, etc. through the world-wide
or particular areas can be easily visualized. The remote sensing
data can be plotted in various ways such as Time Averaged Map,
Monthly and Seasonal Averages, Scatter, Area Averaged
(Static), Scatter, Time-Averaged (Interactive), Cross Section,
Latitude-Pressure, Cross Section, Longitude-Pressure, AreaAveraged Differences, Area-Averaged, Zonal Mean, Histogram,
etc. The starting and ending period can also be declared to
extract the data and visualize the map for specified periods.

The dark red dots represent the great emission of NO2 over
the specified area. The north-east region of India posses a high
reduction of NO2 as compared to other regions during the
lockdown.
V. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
The COVID-19 has declared as a global pandemic for human
beings but a blessing for the environment to regain itself where
the pollution reduced. The positive impact on the environment
may be temporary, but lockdown will be treated as one of the
ways to control pollution. The space observation on emission
rates of pollutant particles in the atmosphere is summarized in
table 1. In this study, we analyzed the reduction of poor air
quality in the atmosphere during the lockdown period as
compared to before lockdown with the help of different weather
and air quality observing satellites. We observed that some
regions of India surely observed pure air quality as compared to
the previous lockdown period. According to these observations,
more future works should be conducted which covered
additional factors. This study contained only atmosphere health
