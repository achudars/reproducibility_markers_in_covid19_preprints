Abstract
We study the effects of physical distancing measures for the spread of COVID-19 in regional areas within British Columbia, using the reported cases of the five provincial Health
Authorities. Building on the Bayesian epidemiological model of [Anderson et al., 2020],
we propose a hierarchical Bayesian model with time-varying regional parameters to account for the relative reduction in contact due to physical distancing and increased testing
from March to December of 2020. In the absence of COVID-19 variants and vaccinations
during this period, we examine the regionalized basic reproduction number, modelled
prevalence, fraction of normal contacts, proportion of anticipated cases, and we observed
significant differences between the provincial-wide and regional models.

Introduction

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) to be a global
pandemic on March 11, 2020. The virus and its associated illness have, in the past year, spread
from their origin in Wuhan, China to nearly every corner of the world. The first reported
case of COVID-19 arrived in the province of British Columbia (BC) in Canada on January
28, 2020 [The Canadian Press, 2021]. As of the one-year anniversary of the pandemic being
declared by the WHO, March 11, 2021, BC has had 86,219 positive cases and 1,397 deaths
[Government of Canada, 2021a].
Prior to the development of vaccines and with the currently on-going COVID-19 immunization plan, many countries around the world and their associated provinces, states, or subregions, including BC, have been relying on non-medical interventions to control the transmission of the virus. The application of these interventions — including mask-wearing, physical
distancing, increased hand hygiene, travel restrictions, and putting limits on or banning social
gatherings — can be either fixed or dynamic and is intended to prevent overwhelming the health
care system. Fixed interventions are in place for a set duration of time and dynamic interventions are cycled on and off in response to the demand on the health care system. The latter can

potentially be more effective at mitigating health care system strain, while concurrently providing the population with intermittent economic and psychological relief [Tuite et al., 2020].
However, the periods of tightening and relaxation of COVID-19 restrictions can have a dramatic
effect on the number of new COVID-19 case incidences over time and the overall duration of the
pandemic [Shafer et al., 2021]. Thus some countries, including New Zealand, have preferred a
“COVID zero” approach where these non-medical interventions are strictly enforced with the
goal being to completely eliminate COVID-19 infection within a specific geographic region,
which goes farther than trying to control hospitalizations [McKee, 2020]. In contrast, BC has
applied dynamic non-medical interventions to control the strain on the health care system. Although BC is in the midst of its COVID-19 immunization roll-out, vaccine supply issues from
international suppliers and the vast task of inoculating every interested eligible resident of BC
have prolonged the necessity of using non-medical interventions to reduce the spread of the
virus.
Urban and rural areas, including those within BC, are heterogeneous regarding population
density, cultural profile, the social determinants of health, and attitudes towards COVID19 restrictions. According to the [OECD, 2020], 60% of Indigenous Canadians live in rural
regions; therefore, there is a larger proportion of Indigenous people residing in rural versus urban areas of the country. Many rural areas fall behind urban regions when it comes
to the social determinants of health. Specifically, there is an inherent lack of availability
of health services in rural areas and there are significant geographical barriers to accessing
health services [Garasia and Dobbs, 2019]. On average, rural residents have to travel four
times farther than those in urban regions to visit a physician [Garasia and Dobbs, 2019]. Finally, non-medical interventions rely on the collective goodwill of the people to comply with
public health orders and the perceived threat of COVID-19. These behaviours and perceptions are known to vary between urban and rural regions. Specifically, rural residents
have been found to be less likely to adapt their behaviour in response to COVID-19 and
to have more negative perceptions of the effectiveness of the non-medical interventions available to reduce COVID-19 [Chen and Chen, 2020]. While these significant differences of urban and rural areas persist, BC has seen predominantly blanketed restrictions across the
province based on COVID-19 projections using data sourced from urban centres for the majority of 2020. Thus, macro-level modelling at the provincial or territorial level may be ignoring
the nuances of rural living and limiting the specificity of these models to non-urban areas
[Lavoie et al., 2016]. One metric utilized for quantifying these regional differences is the basic reproduction number, R0 , defined as the expected number of new cases a single infectious
person will generate. For example, [Turk et al., 2020] conducted a COVID-19 modelling study,
comparing R0 for North Carolina, USA to that of the Charlotte Metropolitan Region within
North Carolina. They found that R0 was lower for the central urban area than it was for
the state as a whole. Moreover, those living in rural regions are currently facing inequities
in access to COVID-19 vaccines. While the Pfizer vaccine is currently the most predominant source of Canada’s COVID-19 vaccine [Government of Canada, 2021b], it must be kept
at temperatures between -60 to -80 degrees Celsius before administering vaccine injections
[Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, 2021]. This requires specialized freezers and is
less readily available in remote regions, as indicated by the fact that Canada’s northern territories - Yukon, Northwest Territories, and Nunavut - have not currently been delivered the Pfizer
vaccine [Government of Canada, 2021b]. Thus, the non-medical interventions will likely still
be relevant during the current vaccination phase, further providing justifications for regional
modelling for COVID-19 transmission.
Mathematical modelling is an indispensable part of infectious disease epidemic/pandemic
response plans. These models inform policymakers regarding how infectious diseases would
behave and, thus, allow measures to be put in place to help mitigate and prevent the spread of
2

disease [Overton et al., 2020]. Compartmental epidemiological models [Hethcote, 2000], such as
susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) or susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) models, are essential for modelling and making predictions about the spread of infectious diseases.
As individuals within a population move through the various compartments in these models
(susceptible, exposed, infectious, and recovered), key characteristics can be observed, such as
estimates on the duration of epidemics, epidemiological parameters, and prediction on modelled prevalence. Recently, these compartmental models have been used to gain insight into the
COVID-19 pandemic in many countries around the world [Lin et al., 2020, Youssef et al., 2020,
Grave et al., 2021].
In BC, a compartmental mathematical modelling study by [Anderson et al., 2020] played
an instrumental role at informing the provincial government on devising reopening plans after
it shut down all but essential services on March 17, 2020. Their model assessed the spread of
COVID-19 in BC and provided projections based on various levels of physical distancing. Their
model was a modified SEIR model which contained the following compartments: susceptible
(S); exposed (E1 ); exposed, symptomatic, and infectious (E2 ); quarantined (Q); and recovered
or deceased (R) [Anderson et al., 2020]. Furthermore, this model differs from typical SIR/SEIR
models in that each compartment in the model was replicated such that there were a series
of two parallel compartments for those who did and did not engage in physical distancing.
Moreover, this model contained a secondary exposed category and one for those who were in
quarantine. While this model was vital in BC’s response to COVID-19 at the beginning of the
pandemic, it did not account for the inherent and aforementioned differences between urban
and rural regions. Furthermore, there were parameters included in this model that were derived
from urban data sources.
In this work, we expand on the compartmental model introduced by [Anderson et al., 2020]
to account for the differences in rural and urban regions. Specifically, we propose a hierarchical
Bayesian epidemiological model for COVID-19 for each of BC’s five regional health authorities: Vancouver Coastal Health, Fraser Health, Interior Health, Island Health, and Northern
Health. In this paper, we will refer the five regional health authorities respectively as Coastal,
Fraser, Interior, Island and Northern and often refer them as regions. The former two regions
contain the most populated urban areas in BC, including Greater Vancouver and the Fraser
Valley, whereas the latter three regions are primarily rural and less populated. Since previous
research has highlighted the inverse relationship between rurality and the likelihood of modified
behaviours in response to the pandemic, model parameters such as the effectiveness of physical
distancing and the effectiveness of COVID-19 testing will be regionalized to these five regions
of BC. Other parameters, such as the basic reproduction number inherent to COVID-19, are
common to all the regions, thus providing a hierarchical model structure. The purpose of these
models is to assess the effectiveness of regional distancing measures within each region and
compare these results with the predictions of a provincial-wide model, scaled by the relative
proportion of population in each region. Despite the current COVID-19 immunization phase,
this research is important and still relevant as BC continues to rely on non-medical interventions, such as physical distancing, to slow the spread of the virus until the province reaches
herd immunity.
This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe an extension to the Bayesian
epidemiological model introduced by [Anderson et al., 2020]. Specifically, in Section 2.1 and 2.2,
we introduce a hierarchical Bayesian model for the five regional Health Authorities of British
Columbia and discuss their regional time-varying specific parameters, such as regional relative
contact reduction due to physical distancing and regional proportion of anticipated cases due
to improvement in testing. In Section 3, we present our results and compare the differences in
prevalence and parameters between the provincial-wide and regional specific models. Finally,
we summarize our work and discuss limitations of our regional model, along with future work.

Modelling

In this section, we introduce an extension of the mathematical and statistical framework
presented in [Anderson et al., 2020] for modelling the spread of COVID-19 throughout BC,
Canada. We choose to build upon this model as it captures many of the key features required
for modelling COVID-19. For example, the epidemiological model contains COVID-19 specific compartments, such as, exposed but not infectious, infectious but not symptomatic, and
quarantining. In addition to these compartments, individuals practising physical distancing
are accounted for, with reductions in exposure being time-dependant based on government
lockdown protocols. The model also accounts for changes in test availability by allowing the
proportion of infected individuals being tested to change over time while also accounting for
potential delays between the onset of symptoms and getting a positive test. The resulting
epidemiological model is then utilized within the statistical framework to compute the likely
values of the unknown model parameters. As in [Anderson et al., 2020], we take a Bayesian
approach to parameter estimation and sample values of parameters from their posterior distribution via Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC). Computations are carried out in R, with use
of the Stan package [Carpenter et al., 2017]. Further details regarding the statistical approach
are discussed in Section 2.2.
Before we proceed to the model specifics, we highlight our proposed extensions to the model
presented in [Anderson et al., 2020]. First and foremost, we regionalize the model to describe
the spread of COVID-19 in each of the five major health regions of BC: Coastal, Fraser, Interior,
Island, and Northern. This entails having a distinct set of differential equations in each of these
regions, with certain parameters being region-specific and others shared provincial-wide. We
also extend the modelling period to the end of December 2020, therefore we have included seven
different physical distancing periods, based on government protocol, and four different testing
periods accounting for improved test availability.
We have restricted our modelling period from March to December 2020 for two main reasons. Beginning in January 2021, BC began rolling out vaccines [Migdal A., 2020]. Accounting
for this would require alterations to the epidemiological model, while this extension is well
studied in the literature, this is not the main goal of this work. In addition to vaccinations, COVID-19 variants began spreading throughout BC and the rest of Canada starting
in mid-December of 2020 [Martins N., 2021]. Moreover, certain variants are known to be far
more infectious [BC Centre for Disease Control, 2021a], and therefore, significant changes to
the modelling framework would be required to study their impact. Given that our main objective is to study the impacts of regional versus provincial-wide modelling, we have focused our
attention on data between March 2020 and December 2020.

2.1

Epidemiological Model

We now present a regionalized version of the epidemiological model of [Anderson et al., 2020].
This is an SEIQR type model, meaning we include individuals in health region i which are
susceptible (S i ), exposed but not infectious (E1i ), exposed and infectious but not symptomatic
(E2i ), infected (I i ), quarantined (Qi ) and recovered (Ri ). Due to the relatively small death rate
for COVID-19, deaths are not accounted for in this model. In additions to these compartments,
i
i
a secondary set of equations Sdi , E1d
, E2d
, Idi , Qid and Rdi , is included for individuals in health
region i practising physical distancing. The strictness of the physical distancing measures will
vary in time due to policy changes throughout the different lockdown phases between March 1,
2020 and December 31, 2020.
Within the ith health region with population N i , the epidemiological model for individuals

The vast majority of the parameters in this model are taken constant throughout the
province as they are inherent to COVID-19. For example, the parameter β captures the rate of
transmission from the infectious to the susceptible individuals. One may argue that this should
be region specific, since regions with higher population density will tend to have higher rates of
transmission. Instead we take f i (t) to be region specific, where f i (t) accounts for the relative
reduction in contacts for individuals practising physical distancing. We take f i (t) to be a continuous piecewise constant function, taking constant values in (0, 1) during different phases of
lockdown, with smaller values of f i resulting in reduced transmission from physically distanced
individuals. The parameters k1 , k2 and D1 quantify the progression of individuals through the
compartments from E1i through E2i to Ri , whereas q captures the rate at which infected individuals begin quarantining. The parameter ud represents the rate at which individuals switch
their behaviour to begin physical distancing and ur represents the rate at which they return
to normal behaviour. We choose to take k1 , k2 , D, q, ur , and ud to be fixed throughout the
province. As shown below, ur and ud also describe the asymptotic proportion of population
who are practising physical distancing. Therefore, if this model is being applied in a variety
of regions with drastically different perspectives on the value of physical distancing, then we
would additionally suggest taking ur and ud to be region specific. It is important to note that
this model accounts for infected individuals who do not quarantine, for example asymptomatic
individuals, which may be contributing greatly to the proliferation of the disease.
Within the ith health region, individuals practising physical distancing have their own set

The equations for the physical distancing individuals mirrors (1) almost exactly, with the
modification that susceptible individuals have a reduced rate of infection, as seen by the additional factor of f i (t). As discussed above, f i (t) is taken to be constant during each phase of
lockdown and between other key dates throughout the year, with one week transitions taken
as a linear interpolant between each constant value. This results in,

As discussed above, ur and ud also determine the asymptotic proportion of the population
following physical distancing protocols. This follows by defining P i (t) = S i (t) + E1i (t) + E2i (t) +
i
i
I i (t) + Ri (t) + Qi (t) and Pdi (t) = Sdi (t) + E1d
(t) + E2d
(t) + Idi (t) + Rdi (t) + Qid (t), to represent the
non-physically distanced population and the physically distanced population in the ith health
region respectively. Using the systems (1) and (2) we obtain dtd P i (t) + dtd Pdi (t) = 0, implying
P i (t) + Pdi (t) = N i , the total population of our modelled region. This is as expected, since we
are not accounting for birth or death. Taking P i (t) = N i − Pdi (t), we obtain the differential
d
N i is a globally
equation dtd Pdi (t) = ud N i − (ur + ud )P i (t), which implies that Pd (t) = uru+u

asymptotically stable fixed point of dtd Pdi (t). Therefore, the system of differential equations

distancing.
Throughout this paper we will distinguish between the basic reproduction number inherent to the disease, denoted R0b , and the regionalized basic reproduction number, denoted R0i ,
where factors such as physical distancing and quarantining are taken into account. We obtain R0b by computing the basic reproduction number of a simplified version of (1), without
physical distancing or quarantining. This can be done, for example, using the next-generation
method [Diekmann et al., 1990, van den Driessche and Watmough, 2002], where E1i , E2i , and
β
I i are taken as the disease states. This yields R0b = D+1/k2
which is constant throughout
the province since β, D, and k2 are not regionalized constants. As shown in Appendix A of
[Anderson et al., 2020], the next-generation method can also be used to compute the regionalized basic reproduction number R0i , given by

Given that R0i (t) depends on f i (t), it therefore varies in time as f i (t) transitions from tFj to
S
tj+1 , j = 1, . . . 6, and varies based on the region i. With the epidemiological model established,
we now shift our focus to the statistical aspects of our model.

2.2

Statistical Modelling

The ordinary differential equations (1) and (2) are solved within Stan using a numerical ODE
solver that includes arguments: t (independent variable time), state (the ODE system at the
time specified), θ (the ODE arguments that depend on parameters), xr (the ODE arguments
that depend on data only) and xi (the integral data values used to evaluate the ODE system).
To relate the flow of individuals from the compartments of (1) and (2) to testing data, we
define the expected number of reported cases on day r to be µr , given by

µr = ψ (r)

where ψ (r) is the proportion of anticipated cases in the ith health region on day r that are
tested and reported, and w(s) is the density function of delay s, with a maximum delay of 45
days, where w(·) denotes the Weibull distribution. The histogram of times between symptoms
onset and case reporting was fitted using Weibull distribution [Anderson et al., 2020], in which
the 99.99992% quantile of 45 days is set to be the maximum delay.
Furthermore, given that testing protocol and availability evolved throughout the pandemic,
we define ψ i (r) to be the piecewise function

We chose these change points for ψ i (r) because starting on March 16, 2020, the testing
shifted focus to healthcare workers, long-term care residents, and community clusters not linked
to travel. Then from April 9, 2020, expanded testing included residents in remote regions, people in homeless or unstable housing, first responders and returning travellers to Canada. Finally
from April 21 and onwards, any individual with COVID-19 symptoms was eligible to get a test.

Figure 1: This depicts the hierarchical structure of the model dependence on parameters. R0b
is shared between all regions and f2 , . . . , f7 , ψ2 , . . . , ψ4 and φ are individualized to each region.
There are certain disadvantages in having purely regional models. For example, for a small
region like Northern, the number of cases being sampled is very low. Since we have a small
sample size, there is a lot more variability, which may lead to unreliable estimates. To deal
with this problem, we used hierarchical modelling to have all five regions share the same R0b
with the prior Lognormal (log(2.6), 0.2), as illustrated in Figure 1. This combines regional
and information from throughout BC to help smooth out the estimates, meaning the estimates
are not purely driven by local dynamics. As discussed in Section 2.1, R0b represents the basic
reproduction number inherent to COVID-19, thus we model R0b to be constant across all
regions. The rate of spread within each region is then determined through the regional specific
parameters f2i , . . . , f7i . For various values of R0b , we expect the epidemiological model (1) to
alter its prediction, with larger R0b resulting in an increased number of predicted cases. This
β
. As discussed in Section 2.3, the parameters D and k2
is indeed the case, since R0b = (D+1/k2)
are fixed, therefore we ensure that the dynamics of (1) reflect a given value of R0b by setting
β = R0b (D + 1/k2).
For each region in the hierarchical model, we used a negative binomial observation model
to link the expected case count in region i, µir from the structural model, and the observed case
count data in region i, denoted by Cri :

loosening of restriction between March 21, 2020 and November 6, 2020, and tightening of
restrictions starting from November 7, 2020. In general, these priors encode our knowledge of
policy and testing protocols, while being flexible enough (via prior standard deviations of 0.2
for f2i . . . f7i and 0.05 for ψ1i , . . . , ψ4i ) to allow the data to inform the final parameter estimates.

Provincial and Regional Model Inputs

Table 3 shows the populations of each region [Interior Health, 2020]. This was used for initialization and comparison with the provincial-wide model. Moreover, we have used the value of
N =5,100,000 in our provincial-wide model for the population of BC1 .

Table 3: Populations of each regional Health Authority in BC.
For a given set of parameters f1i , . . . , f7i and R0b , or equivalently β, we need to solve the
equations (1) and (2) in each region. To do this we need appropriate initial conditions for

Although the sum of the regional population is 5050481, we have used the same provincial-wide population
as [Anderson et al., 2020] for consistency.

the differential equations, requiring initial values for all model compartments in all five regions. These values were obtained for the provincial-wide model, as discussed in [Anderson et
al.,2020], by initializing the model on February 1 with 8 individuals shared between compartments E1 , E2 , I and E1d , E2d and Id . The specific initial conditions among these compartments
is displayed on Table 2 of [Anderson et al.,2020]. Using these initial conditions, equations (1)
and (2) are solved throughout February using ψ(r) between 10% and 30%, and without incorporating any additional data. The resulting distribution of values throughout the compartments
on March 1 was then taken as the initial condition for computations starting on March 1. We
follow this same methodology to obtain initial values in each of the five regions by scaling down
provincial-wide compartmental values on March 1 based on the relative population. For exi
ample, S i (March 1) = NN S(March 1), where S denotes total number of susceptible individuals
provincial-wide and N is the total population of BC.
As discussed in Section 2.1, the parameters k1 , k2 , ur , ud , q and D are taken to be constant
across all five regions. Although ur and ud were discussed in detail within Section 2.1, it
remains to justify this choice for the other parameters. Note that k1 and k2 describe the rates
of transition from E1i to E2i and E2i to I i respectively. This rate is inherent to the virus as it
describes the evolution of the disease, for example, k1 represents the rate of transition from
exposed and not infectious to exposed and infectious but not symptomatic. Similarly, parameter
D represents the mean duration of the infectious period (the average time spent in compartment
I i in the absence of quarantining). Parameter q however, represents the rate at which infectious
individuals begin fully quarantining. As discussed in [Anderson et al., 2020], it was estimated
early in the pandemic that one fifth of all severe cases eliminated transmission by rather fully
quarantining, or ending up in the hospital (both of these outcomes are considered to be within
compartment Qi ). Referencing equation (1), individuals can leave compartment I i and remain
in the non-distanced group, by staying in I for the full duration D then entering compartment
Ri , or by beginning to quarantine at rate q. Therefore, the proportion of individuals exiting I i
q
. Equating this ratio
to quarantine versus staying in I for the full duration is given by q+1/D
to 1/5 and setting D = 5 yields our choice of q = 0.05. One may argue that this value may
have changed throughout the year or may be regionally dependent. However, allowing this to
vary would directly impact the resulting values of f i (t), therefore, to accommodate any changes
that may occur throughout the year or regionally, we let the physical distancing parameter f i (t)
vary to compensate. The remaining values for these parameters are as follows: k1 = 0.2 days−1 ,
k2 = 1 days−1 , see [Tindale et al., 2020, Ganyani et al., 2020], and (ud , ur ) = (0.1, 0.02), see
[Korzinski D. and Kurl S., 2020].
The data used in this research is publicly available from the British Columbia Centre for
Disease Control website [BC Centre for Disease Control, 2021b]. At the time that this project
commenced, the data for all health authorities was downloaded in a single CSV file and were
manually organized by region. During the time frame under investigation in this work, BC
experienced two waves of COVID-19 cases. The first occurred from March to early April of
2020, where the seven-day moving average of cases reached approximately 50 cases per day.
From the beginning of April onward, case numbers were very low and remained that way until
they started climbing at the beginning of July 2020. The second wave surge commenced at the
end of October 2020. The seven-day moving average of cases skyrocketed from 150 cases per
day to just under 800 cases per day by the beginning of December 2020 before tapering off and
plateauing at approximately 500 cases per day for the remainder of 2020.

Results and Discussion

In this section, we present numerical results which highlight the differences between provincial
and regional modelling. We focus on two comparisons, the first being a full analysis using
reported cases from March 1 to December 31, comparing the prevalence between the provincialwide and regional models. The second comparison is a predictive test, where we use the data
from March 1 to November 7 and let both models predict the future prevalence. Overall
both comparisons show significant differences between the regional and provincial-wide models.
Below, we present a detailed discussion of these results and the associated figures. To obtain
the numerical results, we used Stan 2.21.0 and R 4.0.2, running 2000 HMC iterations and 4
chains for all our runs. All 4 chains were observed to have converged as shown in the trace
plots of Figures 8-11 from Appendix A.
Before analyzing the results, we clarify how we compute the provincial-wide model and
compare its results with the regional model. For the provincial-wide model, we have a single set
of differential equations (1) and (2), with the same initial conditions in [Anderson et al., 2020].
To ensure a fair comparison between the regional and provincial-wide models, we impose the
same model structure on the provincial-wide model. Specifically, we introduce the same change
points for f2 , . . . , f7 and ψ1 , . . . , ψ4 , with the same priors on all model parameters. Finally we
take N to be the entire population of the province. To compare with regional specific results,
we have scaled our provincial-wide results using the regional population ratios, with Coastal
by 0.24, Fraser by 0.37, Interior by 0.16, Island by 0.17 and Northern by 0.06.

3.1

Comparison between Provincial-wide and Regional Models

In this section, we compare the results between the regional and provincial-wide models, using
data from March 1 to December 31. In particular, our objective is to compare the differences
in COVID-19 prevalence arising between the regional and provincial-wide models. Recall that
by prevalence, we refer to the total number of COVID-19 cases, not just the cases accounted
for via testing. Figure 2 displays the estimated densities for R0b of the hierarchical regional
model in blue and the provincial-wide model in red. The difference between these densities
is negligible, with the means being 3.07 and 3.06 for the hierarchical regional model and the
provincial-wide model respectively.
The plots in Figure 3 showcase the differences between the regional f2i , . . . , f7i and the
provincial-wide f2 , . . . , f7 , where we recall that fji represents the fraction of normal contacts
in region i during phase j. Our first observation is that within the more populous Fraser and
Coastal regions, the differences in regional and provincial-wide fi are minimal. Alternatively,
there is significant variation between the regional and provincial-wide fi in the Island, Interior
and Northern regions. Moreover, we can study each region to compare the resulting fji versus
fj . For example, we see that the provincial-wide and regional models in the Northern region
have similar f2 , f3 , and f4 . However, we see differing values for f5 , f6 and f7 . These differences,
as discussed below, result in wildly different prevalence. Similar observations can be made in
other regions as well.
Combining the results of the hierarchical regional R0b and the provincial-wide R0b from
Figure 2 and the mean values of the regional fji and the provincial-wide fi from Figure 3,
equation (4) was used to compute Table 4. Here we see the resulting values of R0i along with its
regional weighted average R0 and the provincial-wide R0 . We note that there is good agreement
between the regional weighted average R0 and the provincial-wide R0 . Using these observations
on the regional and provincial-wide R0 values, we focus next on the differences in predicted
prevalence between the regional and provincial-wide model.

Table 4: Listed are the values for the regionalized basic reproduction number R0i using mean
values of fji and R0b , the weighted average of the R0i based on the regional population ratio,
and the provincial-wide basic reproduction number R0 .
Figure 4 shows the discrepancies between the regional and provincial-wide model prevalence
of COVID-19 between March 1 and December 31, 2020. First, we see vast differences in the
prevalence in the Interior region, Island region and Northern region. Within the Island region
for example, the provincial-wide model grossly overestimates the number of cases, whereas
in the Interior and Northern regions the provincial-wide model predicts decline through late
November and December, when in fact the prevalence in these two regions were increasing. In
Figure 5, we observed that the regional model is in good agreement with the reported cases
and hence we believe the regional model provides a more accurate estimate of the modelled
prevalence in Figure 4. Moreover, we observed that the values of R0i and R0 are consistent
with the plots in Figure 4. For example, the first vertical dashed line is where f2 begins.
Referring to Table 4, we see that the R0i values corresponding to the f2 column are all less than
1, meaning the prevalence should decrease, which is exactly what we observe in each region
of Figure 4. Similarly for f3 and f4 columns of Table 4, we see that the R0i values are larger
than 1 for the Coastal, Fraser, Island and Northern regions, which is in good agreement with
their increase in prevalence during the same period. Moreover, for the R0i values in the f5
column of Table 4, the R0i values of the Fraser and Interior region are larger than 1, while the
Coastal, Island and Northern regions are less than 1. These values are in good agreement with
the regional prevalence of Figure 4 in that time period. These patterns hold in the remaining
regions and phases, as we see the correct correlation between rise and fall of the prevalence and
the respective R0i being greater or smaller than 1.
Overall, the results in this section indicate that a provincial-wide model is unable to accurately capture the modelled prevalence throughout all regions. For instance, during the December period, the differences in the Island region are so significant that government regulations
based on provincial-wide modelling may be overly restrictive. Alternatively, the provincial-wide
model would indicate a large decline of cases in the Interior and Northern regions, potentially
leading to a loosening of restrictions. However, based on the rising cases in regional modelled
prevalence, loosening of restrictions would be the incorrect course of action for these regions.

Figure 6: Comparison of estimated densities for ψ1 , . . . , ψ4 by regions (blue) and provincial-wide
(red).
Finally, Figure 6 plots the estimated densities of ψ1 , . . . , ψ4 , namely the proportion of anticipated cases that are tested and reported, shown in blue for each region. Again for comparison,
the corresponding density estimates for these parameters in the provincial-wide model are shown
in red. There are some apparent differences between the regionally and provincially estimated
ψ1 and ψ2 . As these are the early weeks of the pandemic, this indicates that there may be
uneven testing availability in the province. Furthermore, there is uncertainty arising from the
assumed initial conditions for the model (due to low initial case counts) that may account for
16

these differences. Once testing became widely available (April 21 onwards, represented by ψ4 ),
it appears that all the individual regions stabilize at detecting about 40% of their anticipated
cases, which thus matches the overall provincial estimate.

3.2

Comparison on Prediction between Provincial-wide and Regional
Models

For this comparison, we used data from March 1 to November 7, 2020 to fit the models, and
subsequently predict the prevalence of COVID-19 cases in the time period between November
8 and November 31, 2020. The resulting plots are shown in Figure 7. In many ways, this set
of plots is the most impactful of our presented results, as we now explain.
The epidemiological model described by (1) and (2), with parameters estimated via the
statistical methodology presented in Section 2.2, yield our best estimates of how the pandemic
is evolving at a given time, and quantify the uncertainty associated with those estimates (via
credible intervals). We verified that these parameters allow us to fit the regional data remarkably well, as seen in Figure 7. The final step is to use this model for prediction, as shown in
the light grey portions of the plots. Focusing our attention to the Interior, Island and Northern
region plots of Figure 7, we see a very large overestimation of cases by the provincial-wide
predictions. As discussed in the modelled prevalence in Section 3.1, this overestimation may
lead to overly restrictive government lockdown. Conversely, focusing now on the Fraser region,
we see that the regional model predicts slightly more cases than the provincial-wide model,
indicating further restrictions may be needed to prevent overwhelming the regional health care
system. Overall, these results further emphasize the importance of regionalized modelling for
accurate estimation of future prevalence.

Conclusion

This paper presented a hierarchical regional approach for the modelling of COVID-19 prevalence in BC, to assess the effectiveness of public health measures in reducing physical contacts in
2020. Compared to previous applications of this epidemiological compartment model, we introduced an additional hierarchical structure to facilitate regional-level modeling, with parameters
specified such that some are region-specific and others are common to all regions. The results
showed important differences between this regional model and the corresponding provincialwide model, in both prevalence estimates and also for prediction. This in turn suggests that
regionalized models and interventions can be crucial for addressing the future prevalence of
COVID-19.
The model presented nonetheless has certain limitations. The ODE systems do not account
explicitly for migration between regions; such migration could have played a key role especially
during the initial spread of COVID-19 to the different regions of the province. Also, we did not
attempt to incorporate time-varying or region-specific parameters ud and ur which govern the
attitudes towards physical distancing, but rather captured their effects within the fi parameters
for simplicity. For example, ud and ur may have changed as the pandemic progressed due to
lockdown fatigue. We also note that data on the number of tests performed and positivity rates
have not been used in the model; intuitively, these may have some relationship to ψi but their
actual role is difficult to determine, without random testing.
Furthermore, upon finishing our work, we have noticed that the BC Centre for Disease
Control has started reporting regional predictions in their weekly report as of the week of
April 14, 2021 [BC Centre for Disease Control, 2021c] as well as in their recent annual report
[BC Centre for Disease Control, 2021d]. Thus, another extension to this work would be to
modify our hierarchical Bayesian epidemiological model to incorporate vaccinated individuals
and additional modifications to account for more infectious variants of COVID-19. With additional change points to account for recent restrictions in 2021, the modified model would allow
predictions to be made with the current 2021 data for comparison with the regional predictions
from the BC Centre for Disease Control.
