ABSTRACT
Group testing allows saving chemical reagents, analysis time, and costs, by testing pools of samples
instead of individual samples. We introduce a class of group testing protocols with small dilution,
suited to operate even at high prevalence (5% − 10%), and maximizing the fraction of samples classified
positive/negative within the first round of tests. Precisely, if the tested group has exactly one positive
sample then the protocols identify it without further individual tests. The protocols also detect the
presence of two or more positives in the group, in which case a second round could be applied to identify
the positive individuals. With a prevalence of 5% and maximum dilution 6, with 100 tests we classify
242 individuals, 92% of them in one round and 8% requiring a second individual test. In comparison,
the Dorfman’s scheme can test 229 individuals with 100 tests, with a second round for 18.5% of the
individuals.
Group Testing; COVID-19; Pooling.

Introduction
We consider those situations where it is necessary to check if some individuals are positive with respect to
a given disease. With a direct approach, samples taken from the individuals can be tested one by one, with
a number of tests equal to the number of individuals under test. In many cases, however, it is possible
to pool samples taken from different individuals and test the pool: if the pool is negative then all the
corresponding individuals are declared as negative, while if the pool is positive it means that at least one is
positive. Several group testing (GT) techniques based on pooling to reduce the number of tests have been
proposed, starting from the work by Dorfman1 . When the disease prevalence is not too large, this brings
considerable savings in terms of tests and therefore chemical reagents, analysis time, effort, and costs.
Recently, due also to the cost of sophisticated tests like those based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or
transcription mediated amplification (TMA), the use of group testing has been advocated to enable mass
screening in the context of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic,
with experimental campaigns implemented in a few countries2 . In adaptive group testing, the tests are
performed in sequence, with pools that are created based on the outcomes of the previous tests3, 4 . On the
contrary, in non-adaptive group testing all pools are a-priori set, and tests are carried out in parallel. Both
approaches have advantages and shortcomings: adaptive strategies can identify the status of individuals
with fewer tests. Nevertheless, considering the time required to carry out each test, a pure adaptive strategy
may require an excessive amount of time. Non-adaptive schemes require typically more tests to succeed,
but they are faster as tests can be performed in parallel. To combine the advantages of both techniques,
while mitigating their limitations, it is sometimes preferable to implement a hybrid approach, where a first
screening is performed via a non-adaptive testing step, followed by an adaptive (or even individual) one
for the population members that are identified as potentially infected. Approaches of this kind, which date

back to the original work of Dorfman1 , enable remarkable savings in the number of tests. Several current
investigations on the use of group testing for SARS-CoV-2 screening follow this line5–10 .
In this paper we describe a new class of protocols for group testing where the main objective is
to maximize the probability that classification of samples is completed within the first round of tests.
Precisely, if the tested group has exactly one positive sample, then the protocols detect that there is only
one positive and identify it without the need for a second round of individual testing. The protocols
also detect the presence (without identification) of two or more positives in the group, in which case a
second round must be applied to identify the positive individuals. These protocols are thus analogous
to error control codes able to correct one error and detect two or more errors occurring in a group11 .
Due to this capability to directly identify one positive in the first round, this work is specially suited for
high prevalence (5% − 10%) scenarios, differently from other methods which address the low prevalence
case2, 5–7, 10 . Also, due to the problem of dilution which can lead to false negatives, this work is particularly
focused on those pool sizes which can be realistically used in a diagnostic laboratory.

Results
In the following we will refer to PCR for the test, but the procedure is general for any possible test. With
“prevalence” we will indicate the probability that an individual is positive. The direct approach to testing
consists of performing individual tests, with one PCR for each individual sample, to determine if it is
positive or negative. The number of tests in this case equals the number of samples to classify.
In group testing (GT), individual samples are grouped (pooling), and the pools are tested: if a pool is
negative it is assumed that all individuals participating to that pool are negative. Thus, the number of PCR
tests can be reduced with respect to individual testing, if the prevalence is not too high. The saving is more
marked for low prevalence. In this paper we will refer to GT with a first round of pooled tests, possibly
followed by a second round of some (hopefully few) individual tests to complete the classification. While
the advantage is clear, it must be considered that implementing GT imposes a reorganization of the testing
process, whose impact should not be underestimated. In fact, with GT a phase of preparation of the pools
is necessary. This phase should be automated to avoid errors in the processing: this is already possible, as
machines currently available in many diagnostic laboratories can be suitably reprogrammed for pooling.
Also, while individual testing ends in a single round of PCR, in the case of GT it is sometimes necessary
to carry out a second round of PCRs for some individuals (thus requiring additional time). If the number
of samples to retest is large, managing the second round, where individual samples needing an individual
PCR must be reexamined, should be automated to avoid errors and contamination. When full automation
of the process is not available, it would be preferred to adopt GT schemes with a low fraction of samples
needing an individual retest. Also, it must be remarked that large pool sizes can lead to a dilution of the
viral load affecting the sensitivity of the test, therefore causing false negatives. For this reason, we will
concentrate on schemes with limited pool sizes, which justifies our assumption that the false negative rate
is negligible.
The baseline protocol is that originally proposed by Dorfman in 1943, where: individuals are grouped
into groups of n; one pool is used to analyze all n individuals (dilution n); the mother tubes of the n
individuals are set aside; the single pool is tested. If the pool is negative, all n individuals are declared
negative, and no other tests are needed. If, on the contrary, the pool is positive, it is necessary to carry out
a second round of individual tests on all n individuals1 .

Identification-Detection for Group Testing: the Pnp Protocols
We propose a new class of pooling schemes with small dilution, for high prevalence testing scenarios.
Assume a group test employing p pools P1 , P2 , . . . , Pp to test a group of n > p individuals I1 , I2 , . . . , In . The
pooling can be described by a test matrix, where each row is a pool and each column is an individual. The
matrix elements are 0 or 1, where a 1 in row i and column j indicates that individual I j participates in pool
Pi .
For identification-detection we propose to use test matrices composed by columns all with a fixed
number c of 1s, so that each individual sample is copied into exactly c pools. With this choice, there would
be c positive pools if and only if the group has exactly one positive individual. A number of positive pools
larger than c indicates that there are two or more positive individuals in the group. The largest group size
n for a given number of copies c and pools p is
 
p
n=
.
(1)
c
We will assume always the largest n, as for GT the objective is to test the largest possible number of
individuals for a given p. The pooling matrix columns are thus all possible vectors with p − c elements to
0 and c elements to 1. The number of individuals per pool (dilution) is indicated as d. It can be checked
that the dilution for p pools and n individuals, each participating in c pools, is


p−1
d=
.
(2)
c−1
Hence, by testing the p pools (first round), the scheme allows to classify immediately the cases of zero
positives per group or one positive per group. Therefore, for up to one positive per group there is no need
for individual tests. The scheme also detects the presence of two or more positives per group, in which
case a second round of individual tests is required.
To keep the dilution as small as possible, we investigate in particular the case c = 2, where each sample
is copied in two pools. With this choice, from (2) the dilution is d = p − 1. We now explicit the test
matrices for dilution up to d = 6.
Protocol P64
From (1), the smallest group size for which n > p is obtained with p = 4 pools, each individual participating
in c = 2 pools, and therefore with a number of individuals per group n = 6. The test matrix for P64 is
reported in Fig. 1.
Each pool contains the samples from exactly three individuals, so the dilution is d = 3, as given by (2).
The protocol is described as follows: individuals are arranged into groups of n = 6 (indicated in the figure
as I1 , ..., I6 ); p = 4 pools are used to analyze the 6 individuals; each individual participates in c = 2 pools
3/11

according to the scheme in the figure, with exactly 3 individuals in each pool; the mother tubes of the 6
individuals are set aside; the 4 pools are tested (e.g., by PCR).
Based on the results of the 4 tests, the following cases may arise (see Table 1):
• All 4 pools are negative: in this case all 6 individuals are declared as negative. No other tests are
needed.
• Exactly 2 out of the 4 pools are negative: in this case only one individual is positive, uniquely
identified according to the decoding table. No other tests are needed.
• One pool is negative and the other 3 are positive: a second round of individual tests is required
for three individuals according to the scheme of Table 1 (or, to simplify, individual test on all 6
individuals).
• All 4 pools are positive: a second round of individual tests is required for all 6 individuals.

In this case the dilution is d = 6. This matrix identifies one positive and detects two or more positives per
group of n = 21 individuals.
Other protocols, even for different values of c, can be similarly designed. For all protocols, the decoding
rule can be reformulated succinctly as follows: in the first round, classify as negative all individuals
participating in a negative pool, and test individually the others.
Performance
We present the performance of our protocol compared with the Dorfman’s protocol, for dilutions ranging
from d = 3 up to d = 6. Considering both the first round of test on p pools and the occasional second
round on some or all individuals, for a generic protocol we define the performance in terms of:
• efficiency, quantified by the average number of individuals tested with 100 PCR tests;
• probability that an individual is tested in a second round.
We assume a prevalence ε and independent positivity from individual to individual. Results as
functions of the prevalence are shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, where the probability of a second testing for an
individual, given by (6) and (8), and the efficiency, given by (3) and (9), are reported. For example, with
P64 we find that, with a prevalence ε = 5%, about 146 individuals are classified with 100 PCR tests. Of
all individuals, 98% are classified in the first round, and only 2% need a second round.
For the Dorfman’s scheme the results, shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, have been derived by using (10) and
(11). The exact numbers are shown for prevalence of 5% and 10% in Table 2. For example, with a pool of
n = 4 individuals and a prevalence ε = 5%, an average of 229 individuals are tested with 100 PCR tests
with Dorfman’s scheme. However, about 18.5% of all individuals need a second round of individual tests.
We note that, for prevalence values in the range 5% − 10%, the best performance in terms of efficiency
is obtained with P217, which outperforms all the others, while still having a low rate of second round

round individual tests of about 8%. In the same range of prevalence, the best performance in terms of
minimizing the second rounds is obtained with P64, which has a rate of individual retest of 2% at ε = 5%
and of 7% at ε = 10%.

Discussion
We have investigated group testing consisting of a first round of pooled tests, followed by individual
testing, applied to a population with high prevalence, to save resources.
Two main issues must be discussed for a practical usage of group testing. First, one should consider
that the maximum pool size is limited due to the dilution of the sample viral load and the consequent
problem of false negatives. For COVID-19, a conservative current estimation suggests that dilutions in
the order of 5 − 8 would still allow a negligible false negative rate, although higher dilutions have been
investigated, with some conflicting reports2, 7, 9, 12–14 . Second, for group testing the diagnostic laboratory
must be organized to handle the whole process (pooling, first round of tests, reopening and second round
of tests). Automation systems and robots, currently available in many diagnostic laboratories, can be
suitably reprogrammed for pooling. The main issue is related to the management of the second rounds of
tests. If the fraction of samples to retest is large, picking back the original samples of some individual to
be reexamined should be automated, to avoid errors and contamination. When the process is not fully
automated it could be necessary to use protocols able to complete the positive identification mostly within
the first round of tests, with a small rate of individuals to be retested. In fact, with low rates of second
rounds it may be possible to handle the retesting process even manually, thus simplifying the organization
of a diagnostic laboratory. Reducing the second round tests will also have the advantage of giving a faster
classification.
Limiting the discussion to dilutions up to 6, we have found that in the range of prevalence 5% − 10%
the best choice is represented by the identification-detection scheme P217, which performs better than the
Dorfman’s scheme both in terms of efficiency and rate of second round individual tests. Compared with
the proposal, the Dorfman’s schemes are in fact less efficient and have much larger rates of individuals
tested twice (one time in group, then individually). They are therefore not suitable at high prevalence.
Identification-detection schemes with dilutions 3 − 5 give less advantages in terms of number of tests, but
offer a smaller rate of second round tests. The scheme P64, with dilution 3, is the one with the smallest
rate of retested individuals. The choice of the specific protocol imposes therefore, for a given maximum
7/11

dilution, a trade-off among efficiency and second round rates.
Having to handle few second round tests, all new protocols seems suitable even for non automated
laboratories at prevalence 5%, with few percent of the individuals needing a second round. At prevalence
10% the only protocols with small probability of second round are P105 and P64, with respectively 12.7%
and 7% of the individuals which need retesting.
We derived also analytical expressions for the performance of the new protocols, allowing the design
of identification-detection group testing pooling schemes for arbitrary dilutions and for the targeted
prevalence rates.

Methods
Performance of the Pnp protocols
In this section we derive expressions for the performance of the proposed protocols assuming c = 2, which
is the most effective value of c to limit dilution. The analysis can however be generalized to other values
of c.
Let us denote as X the number of positive individuals in a group of n individuals, and as Y the number
of positive pools out of the p pools. Also, we indicate with Tg the number of tests needed to identify all
positives in the group, so that the average number of tests per individual is E Tg /n. Therefore, on the
average, with 100 PCRs we classify a number of individuals equal to:
n
100 
E Tg

[individuals classified with 100 tests] .

For an identification-detection protocol able to identify one single positive in a group of n and detect
two or more positives, the probability that the group must be reopened for a second round is

To derive a precise analysis we must consider that the second round occurs on subsets of the group,

that, for example, it is a(1, 2) = n. The values of a(x, y) for arbitrary x, y can be derived by combinatorial
analysis. Specifically, we prove at the end of the paper that a(x, y) is given by the recursion

and the number of individuals tested with 100 tests, defined by (3), is rewritten as 100/(p/n + PSR ).
Performance of the Dorfman’s scheme
For completeness, we review also the performance for the Dorfman’s protocol1 . In the same hypothesis
above, the probability that a second round is needed for the Dorfman’s scheme (in this case all individuals

E Tg = 1 + n PSR .

The number of individuals tested with 100 tests is then 100/(1/n + PSR ).
Recursive Computation of a(x, y)
When c = 2, the pooling matrix is amenable of a simple graphical description. In particular, a pooling
matrix with p rows and n columns can be represented as a graph G with p vertices, each one associated with
a matrix row (equivalent, with a pool), and n edges, each one associated with a matrix column (equivalently,
with an individual). An edge connects two vertices if and only if the individual corresponding to the edge
participates in the two pools corresponding to the vertices. An example is provided in Fig. 4 for the P64
pooling matrix.

Figure 4. Left graph: the P64 matrix with four pools (vertices) and six individuals (edges). The four
graphs on the right represent the cases with three positive individuals (red edges) producing three positive
pools (red vertices).
The value of a(x, y) equals the number of sub-graphs of G having having y vertices (with nonzero
degree) and x edges. Since the pooling matrix columns are all length-p binary vectors with two 1s, we can
focus on a specific subset S of vertices with cardinality y and search for the number of sub-graphs of G
with y vertices (with nonzero degree) and x edges, all vertices belonging to S. This number is denoted by
ã(x, y) and is related to a(x, y) by
 
p
a(x, y) =
ã(x, y) .
(12)
y
The value of ã(x, y) equals the number of ways in which, given the set S of y vertices, we can place x
edges in such a way that each vertex is connected to at least one edge. This is equal to the total number of
ways in which the x edges can be placed, y(y − 1)/2, minus the number of edge configurations in which
only ` nodes are “touched”, for ` ∈ {1, 2, . . . , y − 1}. This yields

 y−1
 
y(y − 1)/2
y
ã(x, y) =
− ∑ ã(x, `)
x
`
`=1

(13)

which in particular gives ã(x, 2) = 1 if x = 1 and ã(x, 2) = 0 otherwise. Incorporating (13) into (12) gives,
after some simplifications, equation (7).
