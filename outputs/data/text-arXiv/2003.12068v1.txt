Modelling Recovered Cases and Death Probabilities

for the COVID-19 Outbreak

Abstract: From March 23rd, the data for the recovered cases of COVID-19 are
missing from the standard repository maintained by the Johns Hopkins University
in collaboration with the WHO. But since data concerning recovered patients are
extremely important for modelling the COVID-19 outbreak, a method for estimating the missing data is provided and tested. As a byproduct, it produces estimates
for the probabilities to die k days after confirmation, or to survive after d days.

1 Available Data
The COVID-19 repository [1] at Johns Hopkins University provides cumulative
data on
• Confirmed infected persons (C) and
• Deaths (D)
per territory, as integer-valued time series beginning on Jan. 22nd, 2020. Up to
March 23rd, there was a count of Recovered (R) as well, but this was stopped for
various reasons. One reason that applies for Germany is that there simply is no
defined registration for the Recovered. Authorities only report confirmed cases
and deaths, but they say [2] that a person with mild or no symptoms is considered
to be recovered after 14 days.
However, the Recovered are extremely important for analysis of the COVID-19
outbreak. They are the major R part of standard models like SIR and SEIR [3],
and they define the Infectious I = C − D − R that hopefully have a peak at some
time from the exponential outbreak. Prediction of this peak is the central problem
for any analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic.

2 A First Failure
To illustrate the problem, let us assume a form of the 14-day-rule:
If a confirmed person survives for d days after confirmation, the person is
counted as recovered.
To analyze this, let Di, j be the count of deaths on day j of the new registered of
day i, i.e. i < j ≤ i + d. Then the new casualties on day j are
j−1

∑

D j − D j−1 =

Di, j

i= j−d

and the new Recovered R j at day j are the new Confirmed at day j − d − 1 minus
all casualties of Confirmed at day j − d − 1 and died up to day j − 1, i.e.
j−1

∑

R j − R j−1 = C j−d−1 −C j−d−2 −

D j−d−1,k .

k= j−d

Summing over j up to some n yields
j−1

Rn = Cn−d−1 −

k=−∞ i=k−d
n−1

∑

(Dk − Dk−1 )

k=−∞

= Cn−d−1 − Dn−1
which is quite a simple formula, but the count should be cumulative. This fails
for various countries, unless d is chosen to be intolerably small. For example, the
data for Italy at day n = 52 (March 14th) have Cn−14 − Dn = 888 − 1266 = −378.
Furthermore, while the general assumption makes sense for large d, the above
solution will then necessarily fail.

3 Probabilistic Approach
Assume that pk is the probability to die at day k after confirmation, after still alive
at day k − 1. These events are assumed to be stochastically independent. The

probability to die at day k after confirmation then is
k−1

qk = pk ∏ (1 − p j ).

(1)

j=1

Now the deaths at day n can be expected to be
d

Dn − Dn−1 =

∑ qm(Cn−m −Cn−1−m ),

(2)

m=1

and it is clear how to set up a nonlinear constrained least-squares fit to estimate
the probabilities. The above equations are set up for various n, using the newest
available data, and leading to more than d equations for the d unknowns p1 , . . ., pd
that enter nonlinearly into the qk by (1). Then the sum of squares of the residuals
is minimized.
The probability to be still alive on day d after confirmation is
d

∏ (1 − p j )
j=1

and therefore the Recovered can be modelled by
d

Rn − Rn−1 = (Cn−d −Cn−d−1 ) ∏ (1 − p j ).
j=1

This is automatically cumulative and maintains the integrity of person counts between the Confirmed, Deaths, and Recovered. All confirmed persons end up some
time later as recovered or dead.
As a byproduct, the above approach provides estimates for the probability to die
on day k after confirmation, or to survive after d days. Of course, this is strongly
dependent on how and when confirmations are done in a certain territory, and it
only applies to persons with confirmed COVID-19 by the rules applied there.

for a fixed decision time of d = 14 days, and setting up 2d equations (2) for the
latest available data. The results will vary somewhat if d is changed or if more
data are used, but we wanted to avoid any country-dependent tuning.
The corresponding figures show the Confirmed (C) and Deaths (D) from the Johns
Hopkins data source after smoothing with the weights (1, 4, 6, 4, 1)/16. The R
values are the Recovered estimated by the above procedure, entering into the Infectious I = C − R − D. The dotted green values are the R data from the old data
set, as far as available. The deviations from the dotted and the continuous R values
are not necessarily failures of the method, because the old R data were questionable anyway and might not maintain data consistency. France has not reported
any Recovered for quite some time, and the data from Germany is doubtful for the
procedural reasons mentioned above.
The survival probabilities in the last row of Table 1 are low for countries before
and after the full outbreak, while they are large for countries in a critical phase.
When testing different decision times d, in particular larger d, the estimated survival probabilities do not change much, while the death probabilities continue
their tendency to have peaks around day 5 and day 14. There is no attempt to
interpret the findings to more detail, in particular towards medical, social, or political implications. In further work, the obtained data for the Recovered should
enter into predictions of a possible peak of the Infectious.
