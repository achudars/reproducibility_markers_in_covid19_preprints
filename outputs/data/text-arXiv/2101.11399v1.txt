Abstract: We go beyond a systematic review of several main mathematical models employed to describe the diffusion of infectious diseases and demonstrate how the different
approaches are related. It is shown that the frameworks exhibit common features such as
criticality and self-similarity under time rescaling. These features are naturally encoded
within the unifying field theoretical approach. The latter leads to an efficient description of
the time evolution of the disease via a framework in which (near) time-dilation invariance
is explicitly realised. When needed, the models are extended to account for observed phenomena such as multi-wave dynamics. Although we consider the COVID-19 pandemic as an
explicit phenomenological application, the models presented here are of immediate relevance
for different realms of scientific enquiry from medical applications to the understanding of
human behaviour.

Introduction

Several mathematical models have been designed to describe epidemic dynamics, such as
that of COVID-19. These stem from processes involving individuals to statistically based
approaches aimed at capturing the global properties of the system. Examples include the
time-honoured compartmental models, such as SIR and its variations (see e.g. [1‚Äì3]), the
epidemiological Renormalisation Group (eRG) framework [4, 5], and first principles field
theoretical [6] and percolation lattice methods (see e.g. [7]).
The aim of our work is to summarise, review and connect the various approaches in
order to provide a useful dictionary for understanding the current and future pandemics. In
fact, the study via various mathematical approaches of the spread of communicable diseases
has a long history, dating back almost a century (see the pioneering 1927 paper [8]). The
goal of all approaches is to describe (and predict) the spread of a disease as a function of
time: very generally speaking, new infected individuals can appear when an uninfected one
(usually called a susceptible individual) gets in contact with an infectious individual such that
the disease is passed on. After some time, infected individuals may turn non-infectious (at
least temporarily) via recovering or dying from the disease or by some other means of removal
from the actively involved population. Very broadly speaking, there are two different ways of
mathematically modelling these processes (see Fig. 1 for a schematic overview):
‚Ä¢ Stochastic approach: all (microscopic) processes between individuals are of a probabilistic nature, i.e. the contact between a susceptible and an infectious individual has
a certain probability to lead to an infection of the former; infected individuals have a
certain probability of removal after a certain time, etc. In these approaches, time is
understood as a quantised variable and time-evolution is typically described in the form
of differential-difference equations (called master equations). The solutions depend on
a set of probabilities (e.g. the probability of a contact among individuals leading to an
infection), geometric parameters (such as the number of ‚Äôneighbouring‚Äô individuals that
a single infected can potentially infect) as well as the initial conditions. Furthermore,
in order to make predictions or to compare with deterministic approaches, some sort of
averaging process is required.
‚Ä¢ Deterministic approach: the time evolution of the number of susceptible, infected
and removed individuals is understood as a fully predictable process and is typically
described through systems of coupled, ordinary differential equations in time (the latter

is understood as a continuous variable). Solutions of these systems are therefore determined by certain parameters (such as infection and recovery rates) as well as initial
conditions (e.g. the number of infectious individuals at the outbreak of the disease).
While particular approaches following either of these two strategies can be very different,
their solutions typically exhibit several common features:
(i) Criticality: depending on the parameters of the model and of the initial conditions,
the solutions feature either a quick eradication of the disease where the total number
of infected (i.e. the cumulative number of individuals that get infected over time)
remains relatively low, or a fast and wide spread of the disease, leading to a much
larger total number of infected. Which of these two classes of solutions is realised is
usually governed by a single ordering parameter (e.g. the average number of susceptible
individuals infected by a single infectious), and the transition from one type to the other
can be very sharp.
(ii) Self-similarity and waves: depending on the disease in question, solutions may exhibit
distinct phases in their time evolution in the form of a wave pattern, where phases of
exponential growth of the number of infected individuals are followed by intermediate
periods of near-linear growth. Each wave typically looks similar to the previous ones.
Furthermore, certain classes of solutions may also exhibit spatial self-similarities, i.e.
the solutions describing the temporal spread of the disease among individuals follow
similar patterns as the spread among larger clusters (e.g. cities, countries etc.).
(iii) Time-scale invariance: several solutions exhibit a (nearly) time-scale invariant behaviour, which is a symmetry under rescaling of the time variable and of the rates (infection, removal, etc.). If the solution exhibits a wave-structure, these near-symmetric

‚Äì2‚Äì

regions can appear in specific regimes, e.g. in between two periods of exponential
growth.
These properties are familiar in field theoretical models in physics, e.g. in solid state and
high energy physics, which deal with phase transitions. Indeed, over the years, it has been
demonstrated that the various approaches mentioned above can be reformulated (or at least
related to) field theoretical descriptions. The latter are typically no longer sensitive to microscopic details of the spread of the disease at the level of individuals, but instead capture
universal properties of their solutions. They are therefore an ideal arena to study properties
of the dynamics of diseases and the mechanisms to counter their spread.
In the following we shall start by presenting examples of deterministic and stochastic approaches and show how they can be related to field theoretical models. We start in Section 2
with analysing the direct percolation approach, which is based on a microscopic stochastic
description of the diffusion processes. We shall see that the approach, in the mean field approximation, naturally leads to compartmental models. The latter (as well as generalisations
thereof) are reviewed in Section 3: we commence this investigation with a basic review of
the SIR model and then investigate how to incorporate multi-wave epidemic dynamics paying
particular attention to the inter-wave period. In the context of the COVID-19, the latter has
recently been shown to be crucial to tame the next wave of pandemic, as was first discovered
within the complex eRG (CeRG) framework [9, 10] .
As natural next step we summarise the most recent approach to epidemic dynamics, i.e.
the eRG [4, 11] in Section 4. The latter is inspired by the Wilsonian renormalisation group
approach [12, 13] and uses the approximate short and long time dilation invariance of the
system to organise its description. for the COVID-19, the eRG has been shown to be very
efficient when describing the epidemic and pandemic time evolution across the world [14] and
in particular when predicting the emergence of new waves and the interplay across different
regions of the world [15, 16]. We finally provide a map between the traditional compartmental
models and the eRG.
The discussion of sections 2, 3 and 4 is general in the sense that the methods apply to
general infectious diseases and populations. In Section 5 we consider particular features of
the current ongoing COVID-19 epidemic, and discuss how the different approaches can be
adapted to it.
Several excellent reviews already exist in the literature [1‚Äì3, 17]. Our work complements
and integrates them, adds to the literature on the field theoretical side and further incorporates more recent approaches.

2.1

Percolation Approach
Lattice and Percolation Models

Arguably the most direct way to (theoretically) study the spread of a communicable disease
is via systems that simulate the process of infection at a microscopic level, i.e. at the level of

‚Äì3‚Äì

individuals in a (finite) population. The most immediate such models are lattice simulations,
in which the individuals are represented by the lattice sites, some of which may be infected
by the disease. These lattice sites can spread the disease with a certain probability to neighbouring sites, following an established set of rules. Lattice models, therefore, allow to track
the spread of the disease in discretised time steps and, after taking the average of several
simulations, allow to make statements about the time evolution (and asymptotic values) of
the number of infected individuals. As we shall see in the following, even simple models of
this type show particular time-scaling symmetries, as well as criticality (i.e. the fact that the
asymptotic number of infected individuals changes rapidly, when a certain parameter of the
model approaches a specific critical value).
A larger class of models that work with a discrete number of individuals (as well as
discretised time) consists of percolation models, which broadly speaking consist of points
(sites) scattered in space that can be connected by links. Depending on the specific details,
one distinguishes:
‚Ä¢ Bond percolation models: in this case the points are fixed and the links between them
are created randomly. Examples of this type are (regular) lattices in various spatial
dimensions with nearest neighbour sites being linked.
‚Ä¢ Site percolation models: in this case the position of the points is random, while the links
between different points are created based on rules that depend on the positions of the
points.
More complex models can also incorporate both aspects. An important quantity to compute in
any percolation model is the so-called pair connectedness, i.e. the probability that two points
are connected to each other (through a chain of links with other points). Assuming the system
to extend infinitely (i.e. there are infinitely many sites), we can importantly distinguish
whether it is made of only local clusters (in which finitely many sites are connected) or
whether it is in a percolating state (where infinitely many sites are connected). The probability
of which of these two possibilities is realised usually depends on the value of a single parameter
(typically related to the probability p that a link exists between two ‚Äòneighbouring‚Äô sites),
in such a way that the transition from local connectedness to percolation can be described
as a phase transition (see e.g. [18]). The system close to this critical value pc lies in the
same universality class of several other models in molecular physics, solid state physics and
epidemiology: this implies that the behaviour of certain quantities follows a characteristic
power law behaviour that is the same for all the theories in the same universality class. For
example, the probability P (p) for a system of be in the percolating state (as a function of p)
takes the form
lim P (p) ‚àº (p ‚àí pc )ŒΩ ,

p‚Üípc

(2.1)

where ŒΩ is called a critical exponents. Models within the same universality class share the
same critical exponents despite the fact that the concrete details of the theory (in particular

‚Äì4‚Äì

the concrete meaning of the quantity P in Eq. (2.1)) may be very different. This connection
makes percolation models very versatile and many of them have been studied extensively (see
[7] and references therein).
In the following, we shall first present a simple lattice simulation model, which allows us to
reveal important properties of the time evolution of the infection (notably criticality and timerescaling symmetry). Furthermore, we shall discuss a percolation model that, near criticality,
is in the same universality class as time-honoured epidemiological models, along with some of
its extensions and generalisations. Furthermore, we shall consider numerical simulations on a
simple lattice model to illustrate its critical behaviour (and also to illuminate several aspects
that play an important role in the epidemiological process).
2.2

Numerical Lattice Simulations, Time Rescaling Symmetry and Criticality

The simplest (and most direct) way to study percolation models is to simulate the time
evolution of the spread of a disease via stochastic processes on a finite dimensional lattice.
(N )
The detailed rules for a simple model in 2 dimensions (on a cubic lattice Œì2 of (2N + 1) √ó
(2N + 1) lattice sites, generated by an orthonormal set of basis vectors (e1 , e2 )) are described
in appendix A. These rules put the following two basic mechanisms into an algorithm that
simulates the spread of the disease throughout the finite and isolated population in discretised
time steps: the infection of other individuals in the vicinity of an infectious one and the
removal (recovery) of an infectious individual (so that it can no longer infect other individuals).
In the following we shall highlight some of the key-features of this model as functions of three
parameters:
‚Ä¢ The infection probability g ‚àà [0, 1] for an infectious individual to infect a neighbour
site. In practice, the probability of a single individual in the neighbourhood (defined in
terms of the coordination radius, see below) to be infected is equal to g divided by the
number of sites within a radius r from the infectious one. This choice, as we shall wee,
allows us to draw a more direct relation between g and the infection rate parameter
defined in Compartmental Models.
‚Ä¢ The removal probability e ‚àà [0, 1] for an infectious individual to be removed from the
active population.
‚Ä¢ The coordination radius r ‚àà R+ , which is a measure for the distance (on the lattice)
over which direct infections between individuals can take place, i.e. only sites within a
distance r from the infectious one can be infected.
A plot of the evolution of the number of infected as a function of the discretised time-steps
is shown in Fig. 2 for a sample choice of the parameters. At large t, the number of infected
approaches an asymptotic value, which is a function of (g, e) as well as of the coordination
radius r. Varying these parameters leads to substantially different asymptotic values, as is
shown in Fig. 3: in the four panels, we plot the asymptotic values as a function of the infection
probability g. We used a lattice with N = 100 and fixed e = 0.1. For each point, we repeated

‚Äì5‚Äì

the process 50 times to compute the
shown mean and standard deviation. As expected, the larger g the
higher the fraction of infected cases
at the end of the process. The plots
also show the critical behaviour of
the system, as the asymptotic value
jumps from a very small value at
small g to a value of the same order of the total population (i.e. the
number of sites in the lattice). For
each value of r, one can define a Figure 2: Number of infected individuals as a function

0.7, e = 0.1 and coordination radius r = 1.
In the simulations in Fig. 3 we
use the same initial condition, where all the sites within a radius 5 (in lattice units) from the
centre of the lattice are set to the infectious state, thus having initially 81 cases. Due to the
stochastic nature of the process, the final number of infected cases does depend non-trivially
on the initial state, especially for small coordination radius r. For r = 1 and e = 0.1, this
dependence on the initial infected NI is shown in the left panel of Fig. 4, where we plot the
asymptotic value of infected as a function of NI , randomly distributed on the lattice. We
plotted the results for three different values of g = 0.4, 0.5and 0.7, where the middle value
is close to the critical gc . The critical behaviour described above seems also sensitive in NI .
This could be due to finite volume effects, as the evolution of the infections is expected to
depend crucially on the density of initial infected cases in the lattice and on their spatial
distribution. This effects should disappear at infinite volume. Especially near the critical
value, we observe a large spread of the values of the asymptotic values. This is particularly
evident for small densities of initial infections, where stochastic effects become relevant. As
an example, we show a bundle of 50 solutions near the critical value in the right panel of
Fig. 4.
2.3

Master Action and Field Theory

Here we briefly summarise the percolation approach and the derivation via field theory of
the reaction diffusion processes. We follow Pruessner‚Äôs lectures [19] and borrow part of his
notation. The overarching goal is to reproduce and extend the action given in the seminal
work of Cardy and Grassberger [6].
We, therefore, consider a model of random walkers described by a field W diffusing
through a lattice, reproducing themselves and dropping some poison P as they stroll around.
The poison field P does not diffuse but kills walkers if they hit a poisoned location. Interpreting the positions of the walkers as infected sites and those of the poison as simultaneously
representing either the immune or removed individuals, the model effectively describes a

disease diffusion process featuring infection and immunisation dynamics. The microscopic
processes considered in [6] (see also [20, 21]) can be diagrammatically summarised as:
W ‚Üí W +W ,

W ‚Üí W +P ,

with rate Œ± ,

W +P ‚Üí P ,

with rate Œ≤ .

(2.2)

The first branching process corresponds to infection, while the last two processes describe immunisation. In addition we will consider a process of spontaneous creation, by which infected
can appear at one site independently from the presence of other infected at neighbouring
sites, with a rate Œæ.

point with e = 0.1 and g = 0.5. Right panel: Time evolution of the infected cases for 50
simulations with e = 0.1,g = 0.5,NI = 2 and r = 1.

whereD = lima‚Üí0 Ha2 /q is the hopping rate in the continuum (a is the lattice spacing). The
action in Eq. (2.9) corresponds to the result in [6] augmented here by the last source term
due to spontaneous generation. This produces a background of infected and it is responsible
in this approach for the strolling dynamics, as we motivate in the next section and illustrate
by numerical studies in the last section of the paper.
The renormalisation group equations stemming from the action (2.9), which follow closely
to that of other theories (such as directed percolation models or reggeon field theory [25, 26]),
have been analysed in [6]. In particular, the Fourier transform of the correlation function of
a field W and a field W + was computed and shown to satisfy the following scaling law near
criticality

for some function Œ¶. Here ‚àÜ is a measure for the proximity to criticality (i.e. it is proportional
to p‚àípc of Eq. (2.1) in the context of the percolation model) and (Œ∑, ŒΩt , ŒΩ) are critical exponents
determining the universality class of the model.1 The quantity above is a measure for the
probability of finding a walker at some generic time and position (~x, t) ‚àà R6 if there was one
at the origin, where d = 6 corresponds to the critical dimension of the system [6].
2.4

Relation to Compartmental Models

As mentioned before, the model described by the action in Eq.(2.9) is in the same universality
class as numerous other models that are directly relevant for the study of epidemic processes.
As shown in [6] the particular choice Œæ = 0, in fact, includes the SIR model, which is the most
prominent representative of compartmental models. To make the connection more concrete,
we return to studying the time evolution of a disease on a lattice Œì and divide the individuals
that are present at a given lattice site x ‚àà Œì into three classes (compartments):2
‚Ä¢ Susceptible: these are individuals that are currently not infectious, but can contract
the disease. We do not distinguish between individuals who have never been infected
and those who have recovered from a previous infection, but are no longer immune. We
shall denote nSx the number of susceptible individuals at x.
‚Ä¢ Infectious: these are individuals who are currently infected by the disease and can
actively transmit it to a susceptible individual. We shall denote nIx the number of
infectious individuals at x.
‚Ä¢ Removed (recovered): these are individuals who currently can neither be infected themselves, nor can infect susceptible individuals. This comprises individuals who have
(temporary) immunity (either natural, or because they have recovered from a recent infection), but also all deceased individuals. We shall denote nR
x the number of removed

3.1

Compartmental Models
SIR Model, Basic Definitions

Independently of percolation models and epidemic field theory descriptions, the differential
equations (2.17) have been proposed as early as 1927 to describe the dynamic spread of
infectious diseases in an isolated population of total size N  1. It is the first (and relatively
simple) example of a class of deterministic approaches that are called compartmental models,
whose hallmark is to divide the population into several distinct classes. As the name indicates,
in the context of the SIR model these have already been described in detail in subsection 2.4:
‚Ä¢ Susceptible: the total number of susceptible individuals at time t shall be denoted
N S(t).
‚Ä¢ Infectious: the total number of infectious individuals at time t shall be denoted N I(t).
‚Ä¢ Removed (recovered): the total number of removed individuals at time t shall be denoted
N R(t).
We assume that the total size of the population remains constant, i.e. we impose the algebraic
relation
‚àÄt ‚àà R+ ,

1 = S(t) + I(t) + R(t) ,

(3.1)

where (without restriction of generality), we assume that the outbreak of the epidemics starts
at t = 0. We shall also refer to S, I and R as the relative number of susceptible, infectious
and removed individuals respectively. Furthermore, we assume that N is sufficiently large
such that we can treat S, I and R as continuous functions of time:
S ,I ,R :

R+ ‚àí‚Üí [0, 1] .

(3.2)

While in section 2.4 the differential equations (2.17) are a consequence of the basic microscopic
processes in Eq.(2.12) on the lattice Œì, within the SIR model they are independently argued
on the basis of dynamical mechanisms that change (S, I, R) as functions of time:
‚Ä¢ Infectious individuals can infect susceptible individuals, turning the latter into infectious
individuals themselves. We call an ‚Äòinfectious contact‚Äô any type of contact that results
in the transmission of the disease between an infectious and a susceptible and we denote
the average number of such contacts per infectious individual per unit of time by Œ≥. In
the classical SIR model [8], Œ≥ is considered to be constant (i.e. it does not change over
time), however, in the following sections we shall not limit ourselves to this restriction.
The total number of susceptible individuals that are infected per unit of time (and thus
become infectious themselves) is thus Œ≥ N S I.

‚Äì 13 ‚Äì

‚Ä¢ Infectious individuals can be removed by recovering (and thus gaining temporary immunity) or by being given immunity (e.g via vaccinations), by death or via any other form
of removal. We shall denote  the rate at which infected individuals become removed.
As before, we consider  as a function that may change with time.
‚Ä¢ Removed individuals may become susceptible again after some time or, conversely,
susceptible individuals may become directly removed. In both cases we shall denote the
respective rate by Œ∂, which, however, may be positive or negative. If removed individuals
are only temporarily immune against the disease, they can become susceptible again.
In this case Œ∂ > 0, which corresponds to the rate at which removed individuals become
susceptible again. Susceptible individuals may become immunised against the disease
(e.g. through vaccinations). In this case Œ∂ < 0. We remark that this is not the only
way to implement vaccinations to compartmental models, as the most direct way is to
add a specific compartment.
The flow among susceptible, infectious and removed is schematically shown in Fig. 11. Furthermore, we denote the number of relative susceptible, infectious and removed individuals
at time t = 0 as
S(t = 0) = S0 ,

I(t = 0) = I0 ,

R(t = 0) = 0 ,

(3.3)

where S0 , I0 ‚àà [0, 1] are constants that satisfy S0 + I0 = 1. Without loss of generality we
start with zero removed at the initial time. With this notation, the time dependence of S, I
and R as functions of time is described by the following set of coupled first order differential

Numerical Solutions and their Qualitative Properties

The Eqs (3.4) can be solved analytically for Œ∂ = 0 as we will discuss in the next subsection.
First, we shall present some qualitative remarks that can be obtained by considering numerical
solutions, which we obtained by using a simple forward Euler method. We first consider Œ∂ = 0,

These equations coincide to Eq.(2.17) upon identifying qŒ≥ÃÇ ‚â° Œ≥, ÀÜ ‚â° , and for Œ∂ = 0. Spontaneous
generation of infectious individuals can be added straightforwardly.

for which the temporal evolution of (S, I, R) is illustrated in Fig. 12 in two qualitatively
different scenarios, depending on the value of the initial effective reproduction number Re,0 ,
that we define as [28]
Re,0 = S0 œÉ ,

œÉ=

Œ≥
.


(3.5)

The quantity œÉ, often called basic reproduction number (R0 ), can be interpreted as the average
number of infectious contacts of a single infectious individual during the entire period they
remain infectious, in other words, the average number of susceptible individuals infected by
a single infectious one. In the left panel of Fig. 12, (Œ≥, , S0 ) have been chosen such that
Re,0 < 1: in this case, even though at initial time a significant fraction of the population (8%)
is infectious, the function I(t) decreases continuously, leading to a relatively quick eradication
of the disease. In the right panel of Fig. 12, we chose Re,0 > 1: the number of infectious
cases grows to a maximum and starts decreasing once only a small number of susceptible
individuals remain available.
This behaviour is more clearly visible in the asymptotic number of susceptible (i.e.
S(‚àû) = limt‚Üí‚àû S(t)) or (equivalently) the cumulative number of individuals that have
become infected throughout the entire epidemic. Both quantities are a measure of how
far the disease has spread among the population. For later use, we define the function
Ic (t) : [0, ‚àû) 7‚Üí [0, N ] as
Z
Ic (t) = N I0 +

t

dt0 Œ≥ N I(t0 ) S(t0 ) .

(3.6)

0

It quantifies the cumulative total number of individuals who have been infected by the disease
up to time t. The definition (3.6) can be used for generic Œ∂ as a function of time. For Œ∂ = 0,

‚Äì 15 ‚Äì

using Eqs (3.4), we obtain the identity Œ≥ I S =

d
dt (I

+ R) that allows to simplify Eq.(3.6) to:

Ic (t) = N (I(t) + R(t)) = N (1 ‚àí S(t)) ,

for

Œ∂ = 0.

(3.7)

For Œ∂ = 0, we also have that limt‚Üí‚àû I(t) ‚Üí 0, thus we find the following relations at infinite
time:
Ic (‚àû) = lim Ic (t) = 1 ‚àí S(‚àû) = R(‚àû) = lim R(t) .
t‚Üí‚àû

(3.8)

S0 ‚Üí 1, the solutions discontinuously jump to

Qualitatively, this plot shows that for Re,0 < 1, the disease becomes eradicated before a
significant fraction of the population can be infected. However for Re,0 > 1 the cumulative
number of infected grows rapidly.
For Œ∂ 6= 0, we can distinguish two different cases, depending on the sign:

C

‚Ä¢ Re-infection Œ∂ > 0: a positive Œ∂ implies that removed individuals become susceptible again after some time. This can be interpreted to mean that recovery from the
disease only grants temporary immunity, such that a re-infection at some later time is
possible. At large times t ‚Üí ‚àû, the system enters into an equilibrium state, such that

and

(3.14)

which are not compatible with (3.4).4 The two qualitatively different solutions of (3.4)
that lead to the asymptotic equilibria (3.13) are plotted in Fig. 14: for œÉ < 1 (left panel),
the disease is eradicated and the individuals that have been infected eventually move
back to be susceptible; for œÉ > 1 (right panel), after some oscillations, an equilibrium
is reached between the infections and the end of immunity and the total of infectious
individuals tends to the non-zero constant given in (3.13) (endemic state of the disease).
The distinction between eradication of the disease and the endemic phase now does
not depend on S0 (except for the trivial initial condition S0 = 1) but only on the
basic reproduction number œÉ. This fact can be intuitively understood as the rate Œ∂
dynamically increases the number of susceptible individuals, thus the regime becomes
independent on the initial condition.
‚Ä¢ Direct immunisation Œ∂ < 0: a negative Œ∂ implies the possibility that over time susceptible individuals can become removed and thus immune to the disease, proportionally
to the number of removed individuals. The immunisation mechanism could be due to,
e.g., vaccinations. Schematically, different solutions are shown in Fig. 15. For Œ∂ < 0
the dynamics always leads to the asymptotic values (S(‚àû) , I(‚àû) , R(‚àû)) = (0, 0, 1) at
large t ‚Üí ‚àû.
3.3

From Lattice to SIR

The relation between Compartmental Models and Percolation Field Theory has already been
established. However it is also possible to link the numerical simulations to the SIR model, as

Furthermore, the only solutions of the conditions ddt2S (t) = dI
(t) = ddtR
2 (t) = 0 are in fact the two
dt
equilibrium points (3.13) (where in fact all derivatives of (S , I , R) vanish). This therefore suggests that there
are no solutions that are continuous oscillations with non-decreasing amplitudes and the system indeed reaches
an equilibrium at t ‚Üí ‚àû. This is indeed what is found by the numerical solutions in Fig. 14.

the rules they follow are very similar to the microscopic process of the field theory approach.
To visualise this we used the results in Fig. 3, where the lattice is of size 201 √ó 201 (i.e. a
population of 40401) and the recovery probability is fixed to 0.1. Once the recovery rate
and the initial number of susceptible individuals S0 is fixed, in the SIR model the value of
the infection rate completely determines the asymptotic number of total infected (3.11). For
each coordination radius, we look for the best rescaling of the infection probability that could
reproduce the behaviour in Fig. 3, i.e. we compute the optimal œÅ such that changing g ‚àí‚Üí œÅg
gives the best fit of the numerical results. We show the solution in Fig. 16.

œÅ = 0.27, 0.42, 0.50, 0.99.
The results clearly show that increasing the coordination radius improves the match of
the lattice and SIR model results. The reason for this is simple: for maximal coordination
radius, by applying the mean-field approximation to Eq. (2.13) leads directly to the SIR
equations. The reason is that any infectious site can infect any susceptible site on the lattice.
3.4

Parametric Solution of the Classical SIR Model

Apart from the numerical solutions, we can also gain insight into analytical aspects by discussing a parametric solution of the classical SIR model [29]. For simplicity, we assume Œ∂ = 0,

‚Äì 19 ‚Äì

such that the system (3.4), (3.1) and (3.3) reduces to
dS
dt (t) = ‚àíŒ≥ I(t) S(t) ,
dI
dt (t) = Œ≥ I(t) S(t) ‚àí  I(t) ,
dR
dt (t) =  I(t) ,

S(t = 0) = S0 > 0 ,
with (S + I + R)(t) = 1 and

I(t = 0) = I0 > 0 ,
R(t = 0) = 0 .

(3.15)

Since (3.1) allows to solve, e.g., for R(t) = 1 ‚àí S(t) ‚àí I(t), it is sufficient to consider the
differential equations for S and I. Dividing the latter by the former, we obtain a differential
equation for I as a function of S

for different initial conditions and œÉ = 0.9 and œÉ = 3 is shown in Fig. 17. An interesting
feature of the SIR model, which is visible from these graphs, is the fact that the solution
I(S) in (3.18) has a maximum at Imax = 1 ‚àí œÉ1 (1 + ln(œÉS0 )), which lies inside of P only if
the initial effective reproduction number defined in Eq. (3.5) is Re,0 ‚â° œÉS0 ‚â§ 1. Since S(t) is
a monotonically decreasing function of time, as demonstrated in [29], this implies:
‚Ä¢ If Re,0 ‚â§ 1, then I(t) tends to 0 monotonically for t ‚Üí ‚àû.
‚Ä¢ If Re,0 > 1, I(t) first increases to a maximum equal to 1 ‚àí œÉ1 (1 + ln(œÉS0 )) and then
decreases to zero for t ‚Üí ‚àû. The limit S(‚àû) = limt‚Üí‚àû S(t) is the unique root of

Extensions of the SIR Model

The SIR model, with 3 compartments (S, I, R) and constant rates Œ≥,  and Œ∂ furnishes a
simple, but rather crude description of the time evolution of an epidemic in an isolated population. This description can be refined and extended in various fashions. The most common
way consists in adding more compartments, with more refined properties, like SIRD (including Deceased separately), SEIR (including Exposed individuals, in presence of a substantial
incubation period), SIRV [30] (including vaccinated individuals), an so on [17]. Here, we are
mainly interested in modifications of the rates, or couplings, between the three SIR compartments. In the following we indicate some of these and along with certain aspects of their
solutions.
3.5.1

Time Dependent Infection and Recovery Rate

In the classical SIR model (3.4), the rates (Œ≥, , Œ∂) are considered to be constant in time.
This assumption is difficult to justify, in particular for epidemics that last over a longer
period of time: for example, even in the absence of an effective vaccine, populations may
take measures to prevent the spread of the disease by imposing social distancing rules or
quarantine procedures, thus changing the (effective) infection rate Œ≥. Pathogen mutations
and various forms of immunisations (including vaccines) can also increase of reduce the value
of Œ≥ over time. With a prolonged duration of an epidemic, more data about the disease can

‚Äì 21 ‚Äì

be collected, leading to better ways to fight it on a biological and medical level, thus changing
the recovery rate . Similarly, the disease may mutate and bypass previous immunisation
strategies, thus changing the rate Œ∂ at which removed individuals may become susceptible
again. Modelling such effects and gauging their impact on the time evolution of an epidemics
requires (Œ≥, , Œ∂) to change over the duration of the pandemic. This can either be achieved by
interpreting them as (explicit) functions of t ‚àà R (i.e. (Œ≥(t), (t), Œ∂(t))), or (as a particular
case) to consider them to be functions of the relative number of susceptible and/or infectious
individuals (i.e. (Œ≥(S, I), (S, I), Œ∂(S, I))). Since (S, I) themselves are functions of time, the
latter possibility induces an implicit dependence on t. The functional dependence can be
used, for example, to model population-wide lockdowns, i.e. quarantine measures that are
imposed if the relative number of infectious individuals exceeds a certain value.
In the following we shall provide a simple (numerical) example of how the time dependence
of different parameters affects the time-evolution 1.0
of the pandemic. We start by a simple model that
can be used to qualitatively assess the efficiency 0.8
of lockdown measures. To this end, we assume a 0.6
‚Äòbase‚Äô infection rate Œ≥0 =const., but assume that
the population takes measures (social distancing, 0.4
lockdowns, etc.) to ensure that the actual infec- 0.2
tion rate Œ≥(t) is reduced by a percentage w if the

a certain value ‚àÜI. To model such social distancing measures in a very simplistic fashion, we Figure 18: Numerical solution of the SIR
can for example introduce the following implicit equations (3.4) for the time-dependent intime-dependence:
fection rate (3.22) with S = 0.99,  =

Œ≥(I) = Œ≥0 [1 ‚àí w Œ∏(I(t) ‚àí ‚àÜI)] ,
(3.22) 0.05, Œ∂ = 0, Œ≥0 = 0.1, w = 0.1 and
‚àÜI = 0.05.
5
where Œ∏ is the Heaviside theta-function. We hasten to add that (3.22) is evidently only a very crude depiction of lockdown and quarantine
measures taken by societies in the real-world: indeed, decisions on whether or not to impose
a lockdown (or other social distancing measures) are usually based on numerous indicators
which would (at least) require a more complicated dependence of Œ≥ on I (e.g. its derivatives
or averages of I over a certain period of time prior to t). Furthermore, the conditions when
a lockdown is lifted are typically independent of those when it is imposed.
An exemplary numerical solution of (3.4) for the particular Œ≥ in (3.22) is shown in Fig. 18.
For better comparison we have also plotted Ino-q (t), which is the solution for I(t) in the case
of constant Œ≥ = Œ≥0 = const. (i.e. with no reduction of the infection rate) and all remaining
5

To be mathematically rigorous, since Œ∏ is not a continuous function, using such an infection rate in (3.4),
would require to interpret (S(t), I(t), R(t)) as distributions. This can be circumvented by replacing Œ∏(I(t)‚àí‚àÜI)
by 1+tanh(Œ∫0 (I(t)‚àí‚àÜI)) with Œ∫0 a parameter that ‚Äôsmoothens‚Äô the step function. For the following discussion,
however, this point shall not be relevant.

‚Äì 22 ‚Äì

parameters chosen the same. Despite its simplicity and shortcomings, the model allows to
make a few basic observations: the plot shows that the time-dependent infection rate leads to
a reduction of the maximum of infectious individuals (‚Äôflattening of the curve‚Äô). Moreover, this
simple model allows to compare the effectiveness of the quarantine measures as a function
of w and ‚àÜI. To gauge this effectiveness, we consider the cumulative number of infected
individuals, which is plotted for different values of w and ‚àÜI in Fig. 19. These plots, confirm
the intuitive expectation that lockdown measures are the more effective the stronger the
reduction of the infection rate is and the earlier they are introduced. However, due to its
simplicity, the model also misses certain aspects compared to the time evolution of real-world
communicable diseases in the presence of measures to prevent its spread: for example, possibly
due to non-zero incubation time of most infectious diseases, the effect of quarantine measures
on the number of infectious individuals can be detected only a certain time after the measures
have been imposed (see [31‚Äì34] where this has been established for the COVID-19 pandemic).
To include the latter would require a refinement of the model.

3.5.2

Spontaneous Creation and Multiple Waves

In Section 2.3, in the context of percolation models, we have discussed (microscopic) processes
that correspond to the ‚Äôspontaneous‚Äô creation of infected individuals. Such processes can,
for example, simulate the infection of individuals through external sources (e.g. pathogen
sources, contaminated food sources, wildlife, etc.), but may also be used to model the infection
of susceptible individuals through asymptomatic infectious individuals or the appearance of
infectious individuals from outside of the population through travel. How to introduce this
process in SIR-type models has been discussed at the end of section 2.4. Mathematically, the

which still needs to be solved with the initial conditions (3.3). Here Œæ ‚àà R+ is a constant
that governs the rate at which new infectious individuals appear in the population. The latter corresponds to a qualitative change in the basic infection mechanisms: since susceptible
individuals can contract the disease even if there are no infectious individuals present in the
population, the epidemic can not be stopped before the entire population becomes infected.
As a consequence, the cumulative number of infected tends to N for t ‚Üí ‚àû. This is schemat1.0

3.5.3

Superspreaders

Another generalisation of the SIR models consists in adding multiple compartments of infectious individuals, i.e. new subgroups that allow to refine the study of the disease spread
in a not-so-uniform population. These additional compartments can, therefore, distinguish
individuals based on biological/medical indicators (e.g. gender, age, preexistent medical conditions, etc.), geographic distribution, social behaviour and/or may be used to introduce
additional stages in the progression of the disease, such as latency periods or different stages
of symptoms. Inclusion of more compartments naturally renders the relevant set of differential equations more complicated and is more demanding in terms of computational costs (see
[35] as an example).
In the following we shall present one simple example of including an additional class of
individuals which is useful when modelling different (social) behaviour among individuals.
Indeed, in general, the infection rate Œ≥ is not homogeneous throughout the entire population,
since it depends on various factors
Œ∂NR
such as geographical mobility, social
behaviour etc., which may vary conŒ≤(Œ≥1 I1 + Œ≥2 I2 ) N S

regard is the existence of so-called suNS

ing the disease. The presence of superspreaders can be described by introducing two groups of infectious individuals I1,2 , with different infection rates Œ≥1,2 and
appearing with a relative ratio Œ≤ ‚àà [0, 1]. Extending Fig. 11, the new flow between susceptible, infectious and removed individuals is shown in Fig. 22 (for Œ∂ = 0), and can be described
by the following differential equations [36]:
dS
= ‚àí(Œ≥1 I1 + Œ≥2 I2 ) S ,

together with the algebraic relation

(3.25)

as well as the initial conditions
S(t = 0) = S0 ,

I1 (t = 0) = I0,1 ,

(3.27)

In [36] the parameters Œ≤, Œ≥1,2 , and  were assumed to be constant in time. By defining an
effective infectious population J = (Œ≥1 I1 + Œ≥2 I2 )/Œª, we can extract the following differential
equations for (S, J) 6
dS

dt

dJ
= ŒªJ S ‚àí J ,
dt

with

Œª = Œ≥1 Œ≤ + (1 ‚àí Œ≤) Œ≥2 .

(3.28)

Thus, for S and J we obtain the same equations as in the classical SIR model, which can be
solved along the lines of section 3.4: we extract the following non-linear first-order equation
for S:
dS
= Œª S 2 ‚àí  S ln S + c0 S ,
dt

with

c0 =  ln S0 ‚àí Œª S0 ‚àí (Œ≥1 I0,1 + Œ≥2 I0,2 ) .

(3.29)

which leads to the asymptotic number of susceptible S(‚àû) implicitly given by
0 = Œª S(‚àû) ‚àí  ln S(‚àû) + c0 .

(3.30)

As was pointed out in [36], the SIR model with superspreaders leads to the same dynamics
as the classical SIR models, albeit with a larger-than-average infection rate Œª, due to the
contribution of superspreaders. With constant infection and recovery rates and monotonically diminishing number of susceptible (i.e. for Œ∂ = 0), the impact of superspreaders is
conceptually not detectable. Nevertheless, from the perspective of the total number of infected, superspreaders may have a significant impact in driving the epidemics. In Fig. 23
(left) we have plotted the time evolution of a typical solution, which indeed follows the same
pattern as the usual SIR model. However, as visible from Fig. 23 (right), even the presence
of a relatively small number of superspreaders can have a strong impact on the cumulative
number of infected.
Finally, it was argued in [36] that in situations in which the number of susceptible individuals is no longer a monotonic function (which can for example be achieved by allowing
for a non-trivial Œ∂), the time evolution of the SIR model looks qualitatively different in the
presence of superspreaders.

The SIR model as a Renormalisation Group Equation
Wilsonian Renormalisation

As we have seen from simple numerical studies in section 3.2, solutions (S(t), I(t), R(t))
of the classical SIR equations (3.4) exhibit interesting properties as functions of time, which
structurally remain valid for many of the generalisations discussed in section 3.5. In particular,

the solutions show a qualitatively different behaviour when a key parameter (in the classical
SIR model, the initial effective reproduction number Re,0 = S0 œÉ) exceeds a critical value.
This seems to play a similar role to an ordering parameter in physical systems undergoing a
phase transition. A further related observation is the fact that Eqs (3.4) are invariant under
a re-scaling of the time-variable, if simultaneously all the rates are also re-scaled:

Œ≥ ‚Üí ¬µŒ≥ ,

 ‚Üí ¬µ,

‚àÄ¬µ ‚àà R \ {0} .

(3.31)

This rescaling of the time-variable is structurally not unlike the change of the energy scale
in (quantum) field theories that is used to describe the Wilsonian renormalisation of the
couplings among elementary particles [12, 13]. The renormalisation flow can also feature
similar symmetries to the ones of the solutions of the SIR equations. Compartmental models
can be formulated in a way that is structurally similar to Renormalisation Group Equations
(RGEs) [4, 5], and this analogy lead to the formulation of an effective description called
epidemiological Renormalisation Group [4, 11], which we will introduce in the next section.
To understand the analogy, we recall that most (perturbative) quantum field theories are
effective models: they are typically based on an action that encodes fundamental interactions
of certain ‚Äôbare‚Äô fundamental fields, whose strength is described by a set of coupling constants
{Œªi } (where i takes values in a suitable set {S}). Each effective description, however, is generally well adapted only at a certain energy scale, beyond which new degrees of freedom are
more appropriate and new interactions may become important. In practice, one introduces a
cut-off parameter (or some other regularisation form), beyond which the effective description
is no longer valid. The Lagrangian can thus be interpreted as encoding all effective interactions, after having integrated out all interactions at an energy scales higher than the cut-off.

‚Äì 27 ‚Äì

From this perspective it is clear that changing the energy scale (and thus the cut-off) will lead
to different interactions being integrated out and thus has a strong impact on the Lagrangian
(along with the fundamental degrees of freedom used to describe it). The process of arriving
at the new effective theory is called renormalisation. To describe this process, we study universal quantities that are invariant under the renormalisation, first and foremost the partition
function Z({Œªi }), which depends on the set of coupling constants mentioned earlier. If {Œª0a }
(with a taking values in a new set {S 0 }) is the new set of renormalised couplings and Z 0 the
partition function of the renormalised theory, invariance of the partition function implies
Z({Œªi }) = Z 0 ({Œª0a }) .

(3.32)

Thus continuously changing the energy scale, the theory will sweep out a trajectory in the
space of all possible effective theories, called the renormalisation group flow, which is governed
by the invariance (3.32). From the perspective of the Lagrangian, the theory sweeps out a
trajectory in the space of all couplings Œªi . This is governed by the beta-functions Œ≤i (Œªk ),
defined as the derivatives of the couplings Œªi with respect to the logarithm of the cut-off
parameter, and are functions of the couplings Œªi . The flow is thus described in terms of a
system of differential equations, like the SIR model does, whose fixed points (i.e. zeros of the
beta functions) denote critical (i.e. scale invariant) points of the theory.
Before making the connection to epidemiology, we remark that physical theories in general
allow for field redefinitions, which means that they can equivalently be formulated using
different bare fields. This implies that the coupling set {Œªi } is not unique, but should rather
be thought of as a (local) choice of basis in the space of couplings. A specific choice of a
set of {Œªi } is called a (renormalisation) scheme. While a priori the specific form of the betafunctions depend on the scheme (in particular their perturbative expansions as functions of
the {Œªi }), a change of scheme can be understood as an analytic transformation in the space
of couplings.
In [4], and subsequent works [9, 11, 14], it was suggested to interpret the time evolution
of the spread of a disease (specifically COVID-19) within the framework of the Wilsonian
renormalisation group equation. We shall explain this description in more detail in section 4.
In the following, however, we shall show how such a description can at least qualitatively be
obtained from the SIR equations by allowing time-dependent infection and removal rates, as
first pointed out in [11].
3.6.2

Beta Function

In preparation of section 4, we notice that the SIR model (with Œ∂ = 0, but time-dependent
infection and recovery rates Œ≥(t) and (t)) can be written in a form which is strongly reminiscent of a renormalisation group equation. To this end, we return to (3.15) and repeat the
same steps as in section 3.4 except for allowing œÉ : [0, 1] ‚Üí R+ to be a priori a function of S.
Thus, we can integrate equation (3.16) in the following form
Z S
du
I(S) = 1 ‚àí S +

S0 u œÉ(u)

‚Äì 28 ‚Äì

which is compatible with the initial conditions in Eq.(3.15) at t = 0. Inserting this relation
into the first equation of (3.4) (for Œ∂ = 0) yields

where œÜ : [0, N ] ‚Üí R is a strictly monotonically growing, continuously differentiable function
(with non-vanishing first derivative).7 In [4] (in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic) œÜ was
chosen to be the natural logarithm, while in [9, 10] œÜ(x) = x was chosen. For the moment, we
shall leave œÜ arbitrary, which mimics the liberty to choose different renormalisation schemes
in the framework of the Wilsonian approach. Upon defining formally the Œ≤-function as

7

A priori, œÜ could also explicitly depend on t (not only through Ic (t)). In the following we shall not explore
this possibility.

‚Äì 29 ‚Äì

Further (structural) evidence can be given by considering concrete solutions. A concrete
example for the interplay between the beta-function and œÉ is provided in appendix B. Furthermore, independently of its connection to compartmental models, a renormalisation group
approach can be used to model and describe the dynamics of an epidemic, as we discuss in
the following Section.

Epidemic Renormalisation Group

4.1

Beta Function and Asymptotic Fixed Points

As already mentioned in the previous section, it has been proposed [4, 14] to study the
spread of a communicable disease within the framework of the Wilsonian renormalisation
group. We have already pointed out that the SIR model (3.4) can be formulated in a fashion
that is structurally similar to a RGE. In this section we will, therefore, review the new
framework proposed in [4, 14], dubbed epidemic Renormalisation Group (eRG). The latter
is an effective description in which microscopic interactions have been ‚Äúintegrated out‚Äù, and
details of the other approaches are taken into account in an effective way. This leads to a
much more economical description in terms of calculation complexity. This has been used
to to characterise a single epidemic wave, to study inter-region propagation of the disease
[14‚Äì16] or the effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions [34].
The main hint for this new framework came from data of the Hong Kong (HK) Sars2003 outbreak, as well as the COVID-19 pandemic during the spring of 2020: as pointed out
firstly in [4], the time dependence of the cumulative total number of infected cases in various
regions of the world shows the same characteristic behaviour. In this framework, therefore,
the relevant quantity is the number of all individuals that have been infected with the disease
until the given time. However, the same framework can be also applied to the number of
hospitalisations or the number of deceased inI
20 000
dividuals. In [4], it was shown that the timedependent cumulative number of infected individ15 000
uals, Ic (t) ‚àº f (t), can be described in terms of a

(4.3)

corresponding to the zeros of the derivative df

to (a function of) the asymptotic number of infected cases during the epidemic wave. On the
other hand, Œ∫, which has dimension of a rate, measures how fast the number of infections
increase, while B corresponds to a shift of the entire curve in time and determines the beginning of the infection increase. More details about the properties of this function and its
epidemiological interpretation can be found in [4] and will not be repeated here. It is, however, important to notice that the parameters Œ∫ and A can be removed from the differential
equation by a simple rescaling of the function and of the time variable:
f (œÑ /Œ∫)
dfÀú
= fÀú(œÑ ) (1 ‚àí fÀú(œÑ )) ,
œÑ = Œ∫t , fÀú(œÑ ) =

While A is a mere normalisation, Œ∫ can be thought of as a ‚Äôtime dilation‚Äô parameter. Once
the normalised solutions are shown in the ‚Äôlocal time‚Äô œÑ , therefore, all epidemic waves reveal
the same temporal shape.
Qualitatively, the solution f (t) interpolates between a fixed point at t ‚Üí ‚àí‚àû (which
corresponds to the absence of any infected) to a fixed point at t ‚Üí ‚àû (which corresponds to
the asymptotic value of all infections after the eradication of the disease). Furthermore, the
fixed point at t ‚Üí ‚àí‚àû is repulsive, i.e. a single infectious individual will trigger the spread of
the entire disease, while the fixed point at t ‚Üí ‚àû is attractive and represents the end of the
epidemic. In [4, 9, 14] therefore the following dictionary between the spread of an epidemic
and the Wilsonian renormalisation group was proposed:
‚Ä¢ The time variable is identified with the (negative) logarithm of the energy scale ¬µ
 
t
¬µ
= ‚àí ln
,
(4.5)
t0
¬µ0
where t0 /¬µ0 set the scale for the time and energy (for simplicity, and without loss of
generality, we will fix t0 = 1). With this identification, Eq. (4.2) is similar to the RGE
for the gauge coupling in a theory that features a Banks-Saks type fixed point [37], i.e.
an interactive fixed point at low energies (Infra-Red).
‚Ä¢ The solution can be associated to a coupling constant in the high energy physics RGEs,
f ‚â° Œ±. The epidemic coupling strength is defined as a monotonic, derivable and bijective, function œÜ of the cumulative number of infected cases
Œ±(t) = œÜ(Ic (t)) .

(4.6)

In [4, 9] œÜ was chosen as the natural logarithm œÜ(x) = ln(x), while in [9, 10] it was chosen
œÜ(x) = x. The choice was justified by a better fit to the actual data of the COVID19 pandemic, while from the perspective of the Wilsonian renormalisation group, the
difference corresponds to a different choice of scheme.

Since œÜ is a monotonic function, fixed points of the Œ≤-function correspond to zeroes of the

where Œ±‚àó = œÜ(Ic‚àó ) is the epidemic coupling constant at the fixed point. Negative (positive)
scaling exponents correspond to a repulsive (attractive) fixed point.
In order to better model the respective data of various countries during the COVID-19
pandemic, it was furthermore proposed in [9, 10] to consider the more general beta-function8

4.1.1

Generalisation to multiple regions

The approach discussed so far assumes an isolated population of sufficient size. However, the
simplicity of the eRG approach allows for a simple generalisation to study the interaction
between various regions of the world [14] via the travel of individuals. For M separated populations (labelled by i = 1, . . . , M ) of size Ni whose cumulative number of infected is denoted
Ic,i , it was shown in [14] that infections can be transmitted between these populations by
travellers. Thus, the epidemic diffusion can be described by M coupled differential equations,
in the form of Eq.(4.9) for each population, with the addition of the following term:

(4.10)

j=1

where kij ‚àà R is a measure for the number of travellers between populations i and j. The
contribution to the beta function can be obtained by replacing Ic,i ‚Üí œÜ‚àí1 (Œ±i ), where Œ±i is
the epidemic coupling in each population. For more details, see Ref. [14].
This new term couples the epidemic couplings in each region, and can explain the diffusion
of the virus among regions. It has been validated by predicting the second wave of COVID-19
that has hit Europe in the fall of 2020 [15] and by explaining the wave pattern observed in
the United States [16].

In order to avoid confusion with the parameters appearing in the SIR model (notably Eq. (3.4)), we have
renamed the overall coefficient in (4.9) Œª instead of Œ≥.

Complex (fixed point) epidemic Renormalisation Group

Although the beta-function in Eq. (4.9) is relatively simple and contains only two parameters,
it describes the time evolution of short-time epidemics (such as HK SARS-2003 and each
wave of COVID-19) quite efficiently, as the flow from a repulsive to an attractive fixed point
(or from an ultraviolet to an infrared fixed point in the language of high-energy physics).
However, this beta-function is too simple to describe correctly longer lasting pandemics with
a more intricate time-evolution (such as subsequent waves of COVID-19): the attractive fixed
point at t ‚Üí ‚àû corresponds to a complete eradication of the disease and (4.9) thus describes
outbreaks that follow a single wave.
In particular, COVID-19 epidemiological data has clearly shown that most waves, defined
as periods of exponential growth in the number of new infected cases, are followed by periods
where the number of new cases remains constant. This leads to a linear growth in the cumulative number of infections, Ic . In [9] it was proposed that this linear phase is evidence for
a near time-scale invariance symmetry in the dynamics governing the diffusion of the virus.
The time-evolution of pandemics can still be described within the framework of a renormalisation group equation, however with a more complicated beta-function that features a richer
structure of (complex) fixed points. The new framework was called the Complex epidemic
Renormalisation Group (CeRG). In the CeRG approach, the beta function of Eq. (4.9) is
modified as follows:

in the next subsection. The eRG equation can be recovered for Œ¥ ‚Üí 0. For non-vanishing Œ¥,
instead of only two asymptotic fixed points, this functions has three fixed points

(4.12)
with Ic,¬± ‚àà C complex. Besides the (repulsive) fixed point at Ic‚àó = 0 which remains, the
attractive fixed point splits into two complex fixed points. Since the (cumulative) number
of infected individuals is a strictly real number, the system cannot actually reach the latter
fixed points and thus cannot exactly enter into a time-scale invariant regime at infinite time.
Instead, for small |Œ¥|, when the solution approaches the would-be fixed point at Ic ‚âà A, the
time evolution will be strongly slowed down due to the effect of the nearby complex fixed
point. This results in a near-linear behaviour of the solution, as shown in the left panel of
Fig. 25. Thus, the new beta function (4.11) realises an approximate time-scale symmetry in
the solution. Concretely, the precise form of the flow in the vicinity of these (complex) fixed
points depends on |Œ¥|:

, the beta-function has a local maximum and Ic enters into a
regime of near linear growth characterised by

(4.13)

In the context of epidemics, the linear growth phase can be associated to an endemic
phase of the disease, when the virus keeps diffusing within the population without an
exponential growth in the number of new infected (this corresponds to a situation with
reproduction number R0 = 1, which keeps the number of infectious cases constant).
‚Ä¢ In the CeRG, the linear growth is only an intermediate phase, which preludes to a new
exponential increase in the number of infections. The duration depends on |Œ¥|, and can
can be estimated as [9]

‚àÜtendemic = ‚àí2

(4.14)

This time is plotted for different values of p as a function of Œ¥ in the right panel of
Fig. 25.
‚Ä¢ For |Œ¥| ‚â• Œ¥max the beta-function no longer has a local maximum and Ic keeps growing
exponentially, without a linear growing phase.
The endemic linear-growing phase, therefore, is the prelude of a new wave of the epidemic
diffusion. The CeRG approach can describe this endemic phase and the beginning of the next
wave, however the number of infections would continue to grow indefinitely. In the following
section we will further extend the approach to take into account the multi-wave pattern.

‚Äì 34 ‚Äì

4.3

Multi-wave pattern explained

Pandemics like the 1918 Spanish flu [38] and COVID-19 have shown the appearance of multiple
consecutive waves of exponential increase in the number of infections. In the case of COVID19, the data support the fact that an endemic linearly-growing phase is always present in
between two consecutive waves [10]. The CeRG model can be extended to take into account
this structure, in a way that reproduces nicely the current data [16].
The multi-wave beta function, for an epidemic with w consecutive waves, can be written
as:
#pœÅ
"

w
Y
Ic 2
1 ‚àí Œ∂œÅ
‚àí Œ¥œÅ
,
(4.15)
‚àíŒ≤multi‚àíwaves (Ic ) = ŒªIc
A
œÅ=1

with Œ∂œÅ ‚â§ 1, |Œ¥œÅ |  1 and pœÅ > 0 for œÅ ‚àà {1, . . . , w}. The normalisation A can be fixed to
match the first wave, so that
0 < Œ∂w < ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ < Œ∂2 < Œ∂1 = 1 .

(4.16)

Besides the repulsive fixed point at Ic‚àó = 0, the equation has a series of complex fixed points
ruled by the parameters Œ¥œÅ . Without loss of generality, we can fix Œ¥w = 0 so that the disease is
extinguished after the last wave, and the total number of infection during the whole epidemic
is given by limt‚Üí‚àû Ic (t) = A/Œ∂w . This description, however, only works for Œ±(t) ‚àù Ic (t), for
which the value of the various fixed points are well separated [10], but not for Œ±(t) ‚àù ln Ic (t).

COVID-19

The methods that we have discussed so far are in principle applicable to a large number
of different diseases. The main differences are in key parameters (method of transmission,
incubation time, mortality rate etc.) and have an impact on the resulting time evolution of
the epidemic (such as total duration of the epidemic, total number of infected and fatalities,
etc.). The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has shown interesting features concerning its time
evolution, namely a distinct multi-wave structure of repeated phases of exponential growth in
the number of infected individuals interspersed with phases of (quasi-)linear growth. These
phases can be modelled (and studied) within some of the models discussed above such as the
eRG framework that makes use of near fixed point dynamics. After recalling the data for
COVID-19 we will further discuss how SIR-like models can take into account the inter-wave
dynamics.
5.1

World Data

As large scale testing is at the heart of many countries‚Äô strategies to combat the COVID-19
pandemic, there are large amounts of data available documenting the spread of the coronavirus across the globe. These data reveal universal trends, which we shall discuss briefly in
the following. We shall limit ourselves to the time-evolution before the advent of vaccinations.

‚Äì 35 ‚Äì

The outbreak of the epidemic is usually characterised by an exponential growth of the
number of infections, followed by an endemic phase of (quasi-)linear growth. The latter in turn
is not a stable phase, but typically leads to another exponential growth phase, resulting in a
wave-like time evolution of the spread of COVID-19. As a prototypical example, the epidemic
data for South Africa are shown in Figure 26: the exponential growth of infections leads to
a local maximum at around calendar week 31 (left panel), followed by a quasi-linear rise of
the cumulative number of infected (right plot), which in turn anticipates a new exponential
growth phase.

Analytic Solution during Linear Growth Phase

In [9, 10] it has been pointed out (and reviewed in the previous subsection) that, in most
countries, the data reflecting the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic show a particular
phase during which the cumulative number of infected grows linearly as a function of time.
This phenomenon has been discussed already within the effective description of the eRG in
Section 4.2. Here we try to understand it from the perspective of the compartmental models:
indeed, we have seen from the explicit solutions in section 2 and 3 that such a behaviour is
not found in simple percolation and compartmental models in which, notably, the probability
or rate of infection remains constant throughout the entire pandemic. However, more general
approaches and extensions of these simple models can have solutions that exhibit such linear
growth phases. Since the phenomenon is seen in the cumulative number of infected (which is
a ‚Äôglobal‚Äô key figure pertaining to the entire population), we shall in the following analyse it
from the perspective of a SIR model, with time-dependent infection and recovery rate.
5.2.1

Simplified SIR Model with Constant New Infections

We consider a SIR model described by the equations (3.4) and the constraint (3.1) as well
as the initial conditions (3.3) with time-dependent Œ≥,  and Œ∂ (see Section 3.5.1). We define
as a linear growth regime a period [t1 , t2 ] for which the cumulative number of infections Ic ,
defined in Eq.(3.6) as:
Z t
Ic (t) = N I0 +
dt0 Œ≥(t0 ) N I(t0 ) S(t0 ) ,
(5.1)
0

is a linear function of time, i.e.
d
Ic (t) = N f = const.
dt

‚àÄt ‚àà [t1 , t2 ] ,

(5.2)

while 0 ‚â§ S(t), I(t), R(t) ‚â§ 1, with f ‚àà R+ . This implies
‚àÄt ‚àà [t1 , t2 ] .

Œ≥(t) I(t) S(t) = f

(5.3)

The condition above allows to analytically solve the SIR equations (3.4) ‚àÄt ‚àà [t1 , t2 ] with the
initial conditions at the beginning of the linear growth
S(t = t1 ) = Ss ,

I(t = t1 ) = Is ,

R(t = t1 ) = Rs ,

with

0 ‚â§ Ss , Is , Rs ‚â§ 1 ,
Ss + Is + Rs = 1 .

(5.4)

To see this, we define
Rt

D (t) = e

t1

(t0 )dt0

,

and

Rt

DŒ∂ (t) = e

t1

Œ∂(t0 )dt0

,

(5.5)

which have the properties
dD
(t) = (t) D (t) ,
dt

dDŒ∂
(t) = Œ∂(t) DŒ∂ (t) ,
dt

‚Äì 37 ‚Äì

D (t = t1 ) = 1 = DŒ∂ (t = t1 ) .

(5.6)

Next, we insert (5.3) into (3.4) to obtain the equation
dI
= ‚àí I + f ,
dt

‚àÄt ‚àà [t1 , t2 ] .

(5.7)

which is only an equation for I (and is decoupled from S and R). Multiplying by D (t), we
find


dI
+  I D (t) = f D (t)
dt
d
[I(t) D (t)] = f D (t)
(5.8)
dt
which can be directly integrated, with the initial conditions (5.4), as:

 Z t

0
0
I(t) =
f
‚àÄt ‚àà [t1 , t2 ] .
D (t ) dt + Is ,
D (t)
t1

(5.9)

For the relative number of recovered, R, we can integrate the last equation of (3.4)
dR
(t) + Œ∂(t) R = (t) I(t) ,
dt

(5.10)

where, inserting the solution for I(t) in (5.9), the right hand side can be understood as an
inhomogeneity. Multiplying by DŒ∂ we obtain, as before,
d
[R(t) DŒ∂ (t)] = (t) I(t) DŒ∂ (t) ,
dt

(5.11)

which can be directly integrated, with the initial conditions (5.4), to give

(5.12)
Finally, S(t) is obtained through the constraint (3.1): S(t) = 1 ‚àí I(t) ‚àí R(t). Notice that the
solutions (5.9) and (5.12) remain valid as long as 0 ‚â§ S(t), I(t), R(t) ‚â§ 1.
5.2.2

Vanishing Œ∂ and Constant 

To simplify the solutions found above, we can adapt the functions Œ∂ and  to reflect more
closely the COVID-19 pandemic: since currently only very few cases of patients contracting
COVID-19 twice are known in the medical literature [39], we can set Œ∂(t) = 0 to simplify the
solutions (5.9), (5.12). Since Œ∂ = 0 also implies DŒ∂ (t) = 1, we find for these solutions
S(t) = Ss ‚àí f (t ‚àí t1 ) ,

We have verified in appendix C that this is indeed a solution of (3.4) that satisfies the correct
initial conditions.
Furthermore, since the recovery rate in most cases depends on the disease in question
and/or the state of medical advancement to cure it,  is difficult to change throughout a
pandemic without significant effort. For simplicity, we therefore consider it in the following
to be constant, i.e.  = const. (in addition to Œ∂ = 0), such that D (t) = e(t‚àít1 ) . In this case,
we can perform the integrations in (5.13)

5.2.3

Constant Active Number of Infectious Individuals

During the linear growth periods, the COVID-19 data also shows that the number of active
infectious individuals remains constant. Intriguingly, this feature is also observed in the

‚Äì 39 ‚Äì

solutions in the left panel of Fig. 28. In this section, we will seek a solution of the SIR model
with this property, i.e.

(5.20)

(5.21)

For the classical SIR model (for which  and Œ≥ are time-independent ‚àÄt and Œ∂ = 0), assuming
that Œ≥ 6= 0, the constraint (5.21) implies that either
‚Ä¢ f = 0, which however is excluded since I 6= 0;
‚Ä¢ or  = 0, in which case dR
dt = 0 ‚àÄt (i.e. not just t ‚àà [t1 , t2 ]). However, with the initial
conditions (3.3) this implies R(t) = 0 and thus
d
S(t) = ‚àíŒ≥ f S
dt

=‚áí

S = c e‚àíŒ≥f t ,

‚àÄt ‚àà [t1 , t2 ] ,

(5.22)

for c ‚àà [0, 1]. On the other hand the relation (3.1) implies that dS
dt = 0 and thus (with
Œ≥ 6= 0 and f 6= 0) S = 0 (consistent with (5.19)), in which case I = f = 1 and the entire
population is infected (and stays infected for all times).
Thus, within the classical SIR model, the only solution with I(t) = f 6= 0 constant is  = 0
(i.e. instead of the SIR model we only consider the SI model) and I = 1. This corresponds to
the late phase of the SI model, where the entire population is infected. We demonstrated that
the traditional SIR model cannot account for the linear growth of the cumulative number of
infected related to (5.18) and observed in the COVID-19 data.

Outlook and Conclusions

In this work we go beyond a systematic review of the main mathematical models used to
describe the diffusion of infectious diseases by showing how the different approaches are
related. We also show how to extend the models to account for observed phenomena, like
multi-wave dynamics and the emergence of time-dependent symmetries such as approximate
time-dilation invariance. The models are, at a more fundamental level, either of stochastic or
deterministic nature and we observe that field theory emerges as a unifying framework.
We start with percolation models and, via numerical analyses, we show that near criticality they merge into a field theoretical description as envisioned by Cardy and Grassberger.
The results seed the link to traditional compartmental models that are ubiquitously found in
epidemiology. We provide an in-depth review of SIR-like compartmental models that, from a
theoretical vantage point, elucidates their mechanics and dynamics. We analyse, review and
extend the models to take into account single-wave dynamics, multi-wave patterns and even
superspreaders. Last but not least, in percolation and compartmental models we identify the
emergence of approximate time-scale invariance of the diffusion solutions. This fact allows
us to naturally introduce and review the most recent entry in mathematical modelling of infectious diseases, i.e. the epidemic Renormalisation Group framework. The latter efficiently
organises the diffusion of diseases around symmetry principles and it yields a novel mathematical understanding of multi-wave dynamics that stems from concepts, such as complex
fixed points, introduced to describe (quantum) phase transitions.
There are a large number of potential spinoffs that one can imagine branching out into
other realms of science: from medical applications that take into account, for example, the
impact of mutations and vaccination campaigns [40, 41] to quantitative studies of the impact
on human behaviour [42, 43].
Although the models are universally applicable to any diffusion mechanism, from infectious diseases to chemical reactions and other realms of social dynamics, we mentioned
COVID-19 to calibrate and exemplify their power and applicability.

2-dimensional Lattice

Let Œì2 ‚äÇ Z2 be a 2-dimensional hypercubic lattice, which is generated by a set of orthonormal
vectors e = {e1 , e2 } (with ei ¬∑ ej = Œ¥ij for i, j ‚àà {1, 2}), such that any lattice site can be
written in the form x = x1 e1 + x2 e2 ‚àà Œì2 with x1,2 ‚àà Z. At any given time t, each lattice site
represents an individual, which can be in one of three different states that is characterised by
the discrete function f : Œì2 √ó R ‚Üí {0, 1, 2} (see Figure 29)
‚Ä¢ f(x, t) = 0: susceptible individuals (drawn as blue sites in Figure 29), representing
individuals that are not infected with the disease, but can contract it

‚Äì 41 ‚Äì

‚Ä¢ f(x, t) = 1: infectious individuals (drawn as red sites in Figure 29), representing individuals that are infected with the disease and are capable of infecting nearby susceptible
sites

‚Ä¢ f(x, t) = 2: removed individuals (drawn as green sites in Figure 29), representing individuals that have been infected with the disease (at some prior stage), but are not
longer capable of infecting nearby susceptible sites

(represented by blue circles in Figure 30) cannot be infected by x (but may become infected
through other sites).

Numerical Simulation

In order to perform numerical simulations, we shall restrict the lattice to be of finite size with
periodic boundary conditions:

= {x1 e1 + x2 e2 ‚àà Œì2 |x1,2 ‚àà {‚àí2N ‚àí 1, ‚àí2N, . . . , 2N, 2N + 1}} .

We shall discuss the relation between the current model and the SIR model in Section 2.4.

‚Äì 42 ‚Äì

(A.1)

On this lattice we prepare a starting configuration at t = t0 = 0 of susceptible, infectious and
(N )
removed individuals, i.e. we define f(x, 0) ‚àÄx ‚àà Œì2 . We then consider a discretised time
(N )
evolution, i.e., we define a discrete ‚àÜt and (given the configuration f(x, t) ‚àÄx ‚àà Œì2 ), we
compute the configuration f(x, t + ‚àÜt) according to a number of stochastic rules shown in the
following:
..
.

1. ‚àÄx ‚àà S(t) : let nx = |{y ‚àà {Nx |f(y, t) = 1}}|, let
k(x, t) ‚àà [0, 1]; if k(x, t) ‚â§ 1 ‚àí (1 ‚àí g/A)nx set

where S(t) = {x ‚àà Œì2 |f(x, t) = 0} is the ensemble
of all lattice suceptible sites at time t, while g ‚àà [0, 1]

is the number of sites inside the circle of radius r called
coordination radius. It is important to realise that the
above rules are stochastic in nature in the sense that
k(y, t) and `(x, t) are randomly generated real numbers, that generate the time evolution of the configuration. This in particular means that by
applying these rules twice to the same configuration at time t will (in general) lead to two
different configurations at times t + ‚àÜt. Thus, in order to obtain meaningful results of e.g.
how many lattice sites are infected at time t + n‚àÜt in the limit of n very large, requires to
run the simulation based on the above rules many times with equivalent initial conditions
and compute an average value at the very end. In this way, we can study the impact of the
parameters g and e, as well as the coordination number q on the spread of the disease on the
(N )
lattice Œì2 .

The SIR Model as an RG Equation: COVID-19 and Constant Recovery
Rate

In this appendix we provide a concrete example of how to formulate a SIR model (with
time-dependent œÉ) in a way that highlights similarities to a renormalisation group equation,
following the logic outlined in Section 3.6.2. In particular, we show how a particular betafunction (which is discussed in detail in Section 4 can be obtained from a time-dependent œÉ,

constant, i.e. the rate of recovery remains constant throughout the pandemic10 , while Œ≥ and
œÉ = Œ≥ are continuous functions of S. Finally (to make contact with (4.11)) we shall consider
the asymptotic limit S0 ‚Üí 1.

However, the integration can be performed numerically, and for different values of (p, Œ¥), œÉ
as a function of Ic is shown in Figure 31. We note that for p ‚â§ 1/2, Im(œÉ) 6= 0 for Ic > A,
thus indicating that the solution does not extend beyond the maximal number of cumulative
infected Ic = A (see Figure 32). Similar plots for Œ¥ 6= 0 are shown in

even be generalised to more general classes of Œ≤-function proposed in [9]

Check of Solution (5.13)

We check explicitly that (5.13) is a solution of (3.4) for Œ∂ = 0. We start with
dS(t)
= ‚àíf ,
(C.1)
dt
which is indeed the first equation of (3.4) (taking into account (5.3)). We next compute

(C.2)

which is indeed the second equation of (3.4) (taking into account (5.3)). where we used (5.6).
Finally, we consider



which is indeed the third equation of (3.4). Furthermore, we can directly check that (5.13)
satisfies the initial conditions
S(t = t1 ) = Ss ,

I(t = t1 ) = Is ,

R(t = t1 ) = Rs .

(C.4)

Thus, (5.13) is indeed the unique solution of (3.4) for Œ∂ = 0 that satisfies (5.4).
11

We remark in passing that we were able compute analytic solutions for other combinations of (p, Œ¥) for
specific combinations of (Œª, ), i.e. for certain fixed ratios Œª .
