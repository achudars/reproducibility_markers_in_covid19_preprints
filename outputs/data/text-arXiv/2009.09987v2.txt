The synthetic control method is an empirical methodology for
causal inference using observational data. By observing the
spread of COVID-19 throughout the world, we analyze the data
on the number of deaths and cases in different regions using
the power of prediction, counterfactual analysis, and synthetic
interventions of the synthetic control and its extensions. We
observe that the number of deaths and cases in different regions would have been much smaller had the lockdowns been
imposed earlier and had the re-openings been done later, especially among indoor bars and restaurants. We also analyze
the speculated impact of herd immunity on the spread given
the population of each region and show that lockdown policies
have a very strong impact on the spread regardless of the level
of prior infections.

tions of what are the best policies in each area to slow down the
pandemic and how to assess the impact of individual policies
remain controversial.
The classical epidemiological models may fail to predict the
exact pattern of COVID-19 spread. The spread of this pandemic
has shown completely different behavior in different regions,
both in the number of cases and in the fatality rate. Figure 1
depicts the the number of cases over time in five different regions of the globe (a), and four different regions of the U.S.
[4] (b)1 . Furthermore, Figure 2 depicts four different examples
of how the spread and fatality rate vary in different states of
the U.S. From these examples, this is apparent that we need a
data-driven, non-parametric way to look at things, and classical
epidemiological models fail to do so. Therefore, we have introduced our synthetic control model to analyze the virus spread
in different regions with different patterns.
Abadie and Gardeazabal [5] and Abadie et al. [6] pioneered
the synthetic control method to address the problem of measuring the impact of a new regulation or a change in a region, and
comparing it to the case that those changes had not happened.
The idea of synthetic control stems from the classical A/B test-

Introduction

In December 2019, an outbreak of an infectious disease was
identified in China, caused severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a.k.a. COVID-19. In March
2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the
COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic [1]. While the first case was
traced back to November 17, 2019, [2], by July 9, 2020, more
than 550, 000 deaths have been reported globally from almost
12 million reported cases [3].
During the spread of COVID-19, different regions took different measures in controlling and containing it. In some, the
lockdowns were very strict and started early on, and mask mandates were strict, whereas in some others, they were more flexible, and the lockdowns started later or were removed quickly
during the spread. Besides the policies, the dominant lifestyle,

the infection level has a stronger impact on the further
spread of the virus compared to social distancing measures. Our results indicate that social distancing measures,
at current infection levels in the US, have a measurable
impact on the spread.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a brief review of the existing related work. In Section 3
we provide a background on synthetic control. Section 4 introduces our methodology to apply robust synthetic control to the
problem of COVID-19 spread and regulations impact, and Section 5 presents our findings. Finally, the paper is concluded in
Section 6.

ing, where two versions of a variable are compared in the otherwise identical environment [7]. A variation of that would be
where one of the variables is a placebo. In that case, the experimental units are called “treatment” and “control” groups, and
the variable changes, i.e., treatments, are applied to the treatment group [8]. Abadie et al. suggested that since in some
problems we cannot have an actual control group, we construct
a “synthetic” control group for the treatment unit, using the untreated units as the donor pool.
The synthetic control is a statistical method used to evaluate
the impact of an intervention in observational data by performing comparative case studies. In comparative case studies, researchers estimate the evolution of aggregate outcomes (such
as mortality rates, average income, crime rates, etc.) for a unit
affected by a particular occurrence of the event or intervention
and compare it to the evolution of the same aggregates estimated for some control group of unaffected units [6].
In the analysis of COVID-19 data on the number of cases
and deaths, there might be some missing data that may cause
an additional noise we need to account for. COVID-19 tests
may not have been done extensively in numerous regions, especially in the early stages of the spread. Furthermore, in most
places, the death data only accounts for hospitalization cases.
Since the classical synthetic control method may not perform
well given some randomly missing data and the high variance
noise, we use robust synthetic control, which is a generalization of the late [9]. The robust synthetic control method performs “de-noising” estimations that are theoretically sound and
computationally efficient. Additionally, we employ the recently
developed extension of the synthetic control method known as
synthetic interventions [10], to predict the impact of different
interventions in different regions.
Our main contributions and findings are listed below:

Related Work

Abadie et al. first introduced synthetic control to measure the
impact of political instability on economic prosperity [5], in
which They investigate the economic impact of conflict, using
the terrorist conflict in the Basque Country as a case study. They
used the combination of other regions in Spain to build a “synthetic” control region which resembles economic characteristics
of the Basque Country before the outset of terrorism attack. After that, the method has been widely applied in econometric of
policy evaluations including studying the effects of laws [11],
legalized prostitution [12] and immigration policy [13].
The method has also been utilized outside economics: in the
social sciences, biomedical disciplines, engineering, etc. For
example, Kreif et al. used the synthetic control approach to a
setting of evaluation of P4P (pay-for-performance) health policy where there were multiple treated units [14]. Opposing to
general belief by that time, they showed that P4P significantly
increased the mortality of nonâĂŘincentivised conditions .On
the other hand, Doris et al investigates if natural disasters help
or hurt politician’s electoral fortunes [15], in which they study
on a case of catastrophic flooding in the American South in
1927, and also showed that use of synthetic control methods

This depends on many factors including the characteristics of
the disease and its spread, and also prevailing societal norms.
There is a vast literature on epidemic modeling including the
classical SIR and SEIR models [16] that consider a fluid approximation for the spread of the infection. While these give a
reasonable approximation in many settings, the model predictions are extremely sensitive to the parameters. Since these are
estimated from noisy time series data, these are inherently subject to statistical estimation error leading to a higher variance in
model predictions. Moreover, these fluid models are largely homogeneous require several simplifying assumptions that limit
the ability to modeling many aspects or features specific to a
particular region. These pose a significant hurdle in reasonably
modeling the impact of various interventions for policy decisions based on these fluid approximations.

Synthetic Control and Proposition 99

A canonical application of the synthetic controls method is the
analysis of the policy of Prop99 on cigarette sales. In November
1988, California voters approved the California Tobacco Tax
and Health Protection Act of 1988, also known as Prop 99 [17].
This initiative increased the state cigarette tax by 25 cents per
pack and added an equivalent amount on other tobacco products. Aside from making tobacco products more expensive to
the customers, the revenue raised was used for various environmental and health care programs, talks in schools and colleges
on the harms of tobacco, and anti-tobacco advertisements and
research. Eventually, after this proposition, smoking reduced
in the state of California. But there is an important question
regarding the effectiveness of this policy: was the reduction of
smoking because of Prop 99 or did society move on from smoking? Since the nationwide data showed the reduction of smoking on average as well, the question is how to assess the role
Prop 99 played in that reduction in California.
One way to answer this question in an ideal world would be if
we had two California states, one with Prop 99, and one without
it. But unfortunately, this cannot happen. To answer this question, Abadie et al. [6] proposed the synthetic control model
to represent California as a linear combination of the other 49
states of the U.S.
Suppose we have a smoking matrix for the U.S. Let’s assume the columns of this matrix are the time series of per-capita
smoking, and each row represents a different state. Although
smoking habits are not the same in different states, there are
some correlations among per-capita smoking due to the level of
awareness to the smoking, the state of economy, etc. In synthetic control, we take the smoking data of California for a period of time right before Prop 99 was implemented (1988). For
that given period, we try to approximate the time series of California as a linear combination of the other states. The high-level
algebraic idea is that the smoking matrix is approximately lowranked given the correlations among the states, since the rows
would not be linearly independent. By building this approximation of California pre-intervention (before Prop 99), we can
approximate California post-intervention.
Figure 3 shows both the synthetic control view and A/B testing view of the impact of Prop 99. The vertical dashed lines
represent the time when Prop 99 was passed. The solid curve
represents the raw data of California, and the dashed curves
are the synthetic models building California from the rest of 49
states. In the synthetic control view, unlike the Conventional
A/B testing view, the dashed line closely follows the solid line
before Prop 99. Synthetic control gives a more precise and informative answer to the counterfactual “What if there was no
Prop 99”. Hence, in the synthetic control model we observe
that the per-capita cigarette sales decrease more sharply in the
actual California as opposed to the synthetic one. Therefore, we
can claim that Prop 99 did have an impact on smoking.
For any controlled trial, we can ask and answer questions
“what is the impact of this change more precisely. In this work,
we analyze the impact of lockdowns on the spread of COVID19. We answer questions about the start of lockdown such

The goal of this work is to develop approaches to model the
impact of pandemic interventions that overcome the limitations
of standard approaches. In particular, our first goal is to develop a non-parametric approach based on synthetic control to
study the impact of interventions. Most existing methods in epidemiology, including the SEIR model, focus on the dynamics
of the size of the population within each category. These models often involve some differential equations for the dynamics
of population size and relationship among different categories,
which are mostly simple and straightforward. These models remain powerful tools to understand the transmission dynamics
of the coronavirus, however, the model assumptions can be violated due to complicated circumstances, especially when various non-pharmaceutical interventions are implemented day by
day.
These concerns motivate us to develop more flexible and
non-parametric approaches to understand the dynamics of the
spread of the coronavirus. Another concern, especially when
trying to understand the intervention effects, is possible bias
from naive comparisons as discussed a lot in the causal inference literature. Specifically, the usual comparison between preintervention and post-intervention periods may suffer from biases due to unobserved time trends. For example, the reduction
in transmission rates of the coronavirus may be due to weather
change instead of the new social distancing policy. Also, the
usual comparison between intervened city/country and nonintervened one may suffer from selection bias. For example, the
city which implemented strict policies (such as stay-at-home)
may suffer from a more severe attack of the coronavirus, and
simply comparing cities with and without stay-at-home policy
may underestimate the policy effects.
Due to the concerns listed above, we propose to use synthetic
control to infer the causal effects of the interventions of interest,
based on which we hope to provide useful policy suggestions to
mitigate the spread of the coronavirus. The synthetic control
methods try to find a linear combination of non-intervened regions as an approximation (i.e., a synthetic control) of the intervened region, by matching pre-intervention characteristics such
as population size and socioeconomic status. We then compare
the post-intervention period of the intervened region and the
synthetic control to estimate the intervention effects.

where M1t = f (θ1 , ρt ) for some latent parameter θ1 ∈
Rd1 , ρt ∈ Rd2 . If a unit had no intervention then equation (2)
would apply to both pre- and post-intervention periods. [9] indicates that the outcome random variables for all donor dispatch
areas follow the model relationship defined by equations (3) and
(1). Therefore, the “synthetic controlâĂİ would ideally help estimate the underlying counterfactual means M1t = f (θ1 , ρt )
for T0 ≤ t ≤ T by using an appropriate combination of the
post-intervention observations from the donor pool. In other
words, M1t are the estimated metrics if there was no intervention applied to the treatment unit.
The last step in the process is to obtain the final synthetic
control, i.e., the weights βi ’s. To that end, we assume that
the mean vector of the treatment unit over the pre-intervention
period, i.e., the vector M1− = [M1t ]t≤T0 , lies within the
span of the mean vectors within the donor pool over the preintervention period, i.e., the span of the donor mean vectors
Mi− = [Mi t]2≤i≤N,t≤T0 . More precisely, we assume there

as “what if there was no lockdown” or “what if schools were
closed earlier”, and in case of opening up the states, “what if
they were opened a few days or a few weeks earlier or later”.
If the treatment unit is in its evolution, but the donor pool
is ahead in its evolution, then we can predict how the treatment unit is going to behave. This way, we may build synthetic
control models for both counterfactuals as well as predictions.
In this work, we build a model to achieve both by analyzing
COVID-19 data.

Robust Synthetic Control

The robust synthetic control method is a generalization of
the classical synthetic control method [9]. It makes the synthetic control estimation robust to randomly missing data and
high variance noise. This generalization estimates the synthetic control weights using the unobserved mean values instead of the noisy observations. This estimation is done by
“de-noisingâĂŹâĂŹ the data matrix using matrix completion
and then using least squares regression to determine the synthetic control weights. It is a computationally efficient method
with intuitive theoretical guarantees. Furthermore, the counterfactual outcome can be estimated by any linear combination of
the donor units, relaxing the convex constraints on the weights
in classical synthetic control.

model has been trained for 20 days and used for ≈ 100 days of
prediction.

Results

In this section, we start by presenting how our synthetic control model works to predict the spread of the disease in different regions, as well as counterfactual and synthetic intervention analysis. The counterfactual analysis aims to show how the
evolution of the disease would have looked had the lockdown
measures put in place earlier or later. Furthermore, using counterfactuals and synthetic interventions, we show how different
policy measures impact the spread of the disease.

Figure 8 depicts the number of cases and deaths in New York
using our synthetic control model. The donor pool is selected
from Western Europe, and the graphs on the left show the normalized weight of each region, where 8 regions with the highest
weights are selected to be shown.
We observe that the countries where COVID-19 hit more
heavily have higher weights in the synthetic control model as
opposed to the countries that managed to keep the number of
cases low. Furthermore, note that a bump which is observed in
the number of deaths after day 90 comes from the data source
and is due to the different measurement methods applied on
those days, which since occurs in all the regions, the synthetic
control model predicts it as well, and the shift is because Western Europe was mostly ahead of New York during the spread.

Predictions

We present an example of applying synthetic control to predict
how the spread of COVID would look in New York and compare it to how it actually looked in New York. Furthermore, we
do a counterfactual analysis of the impact of lockdown imposing dates. New York (City) had the closest correlation both in
terms of demographics as well in the spread of the virus with
Western European countries in the early days, and we use West- 5.2 Impact of lockdown: counterfactual analyern Europe as the donor pool. Additionally, besides the similarsis

earlier in NY, the number of cases would have decreased considerably. Note that compared to Figure 8(b), the weight of
countries in which COVID-19 spread was more controlled has
increased since they have started the lockdown early on during
the spread, and if NY had locked down only 10 days earlier,
its spread pattern would have been more similar to those countries, with a significantly reduced death count. While the precise
values are not important and our results should be taken more
qualitatively, our models show that deaths in New York could
have been reduced by over 80% by pushing the lockdown 10
days ahead of when it was finally done.
Note that in performing predictions and building counterfactuals, it is important to pick the right set of donor pool elements.
While in the early phase conditions matched between New York
and Western Europe, things have looked different in the summer of the northern hemisphere. Western Europe is undergoing
a significant second wave, whereas it is largely under control
in New York, and this can be seen in Figure 10 where the actual cases and deaths in New York are significantly lower than
the counterfactual built using the Western European donor pool.
One of the speculated reasons is that Western Europe opened
up indoor dining and bars whereas they are still banned in New
York. Also, consistent with the dynamics of the disease, deaths
are lagging cases by roughly three weeks in Western Europe.

One of the postulated reasons for the second wave in the US has
been the summer heat and increased use of ACs, which cause
the virus droplets to recirculate. We employ (simple k-means)
clustering to divide the U.S. states into different regions, based
on their daily temperature after memorial day. Figure 11 depicts
that when the U.S. is divided into four regions based on temperature. The graphs show the daily number of cases per million,
where the hottest states suffer the worst outbreak after memorial day. Especially in the southern regions (cyan) which is the

Impact of Bars and Indoor Dine-In

We use the data from [25] to depict the impact of Bars and indoor dinings on the spread of the virus. New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts2 , and Connecticut banned all indoor dineins, while in New Mexico, Kansas, District of Columbia, Rhode
Island, and North Carolina, indoor bar service was not allowed.

Google’s mobility data on ‘retail and recreation”.

We group the rest of the states together as ones that allow indoor dining and bars. Figure 12 depicts this impact on the three
groups.
We observe that in states where indoor dining and bars were
not allowed, the number of cases reached to its maximum earlier than the rest of the states, and then decreased very quickly
until it became much smaller than the number of cases in those.
The early peak was due to the early arrival of the virus on
those regions, which spread quickly before the lockdown policies were imposed. In the states where indoor dining and bars
were allowed, the number of daily cases per million kept increasing until it became higher than the other two groups, even
though the initial number of daily cases was lower. Therefore,
we conclude that indoor dinings increase the spread of the virus,
and indoor bars increase it even further3 .

fairly quickly after the lockdown, whereas in cluster 0, the mobility stays low for a longer period of time. Furthermore, comparing clusters 1 and 3, we observe that the mobility keeps increasing and decreasing after the lockdown, respectively. Needless to say, there might be some regions clustered into a certain
group by the clustering model, and may not be sensible by looking at the graphs.
Figure 14 depicts the regions belonging to each cluster, as
well as the moving average of their daily cases. We observe
that in clusters 0, 1, and 3, the number of daily cases continues
to rise, and their peak happens much later than that of cluster
2. However, in cluster 2, the number of daily cases reaches to
a maximum earlier and then begins to drop. In this figure, region 2 represents the North-East minus Pennsylvania. However,
comparing this to Figure 1, we observe that if we consider Pennsylvania in the North-East, the number of daily cases would be

depicts different comparisons of this type. We picked counties
with varying levels of cases per million on Memorial Day and
constructed synthetic control models for all of them based on
a donor pool of counties from the North-East cluster. This is
in effect demonstrating a Synthetic Intervention [10], i.e. behavior of those counties had they mandated rules similar to the
ones in the North-East. In each of the examples depicted, we
can observe that the prediction for the counties in the NorthEast cluster closely follows the actual behavior, whereas, for all
the example counties picked from other regions, there is a significant departure (for the worse) from the counterfactual of the
actual cases. This indicates that the policies implemented in the
North-East states did have a significant effect on the spread of
the virus, and the difference in behavior from the other counties cannot be explained by infection level or "herd immunity"
alone.
To move from the anecdotal to statistical evidence of the impact of herd immunity, and whether or not, in reality, it impacts the spread we look at data across all counties of the US.
We examine if it plays a part, and if so at what level, and we
again start with the counties that have a similar number of infections per million on Memorial Day, and pick a donor pool
from the North-East. We compare the predictions for the North
East counties vs counterfactual for the other counties, and compare the mean squared errors across the two sets. To see at what
level herd immunity may occur, we use different bins of cases
per million, e.g. 6000, 8000, 10000, 12000, etc. and see if at
any number of cases, will the synthetic control model versus
actual model look similar across different regions.
Figure 16 depicts a comparison of the normalized mean
square error (normalized by total number of cases on Memorial
Day) of the prediction versus actual cases for the North-East
counties and for that of other counties. We observe that there is
a large gap between the mean squared error of the predictions
for the North-East and the other regions on the graph, which illustrates how strongly the social distancing policies can impact
the spread given the different density of cases. This also confirms that the lockdown policies, including indoor dining prohibition and mask mandates, have a much stronger impact on the
spread compared to "herd immunity" or infection levels. As the
case density starts to increase, there is a general trend of reduction of the difference, which is consistent with the models (e.g.,
SIER) that predict a natural slowing down of the spread of the
virus as the number of susceptible people decreases, however
as we can see by the sizes of the sets of counties (represented as
the size of the markers), the vast majority of the country is far
away from any herd immunity effects.

to be our donor pool which is New England +(New York and
New Jersey)4 . Then, we filter the donor pool to only include
counties at “similar stages” of coronavirus spread, i.e. counties that had similar case numbers, when the population was
adjusted. To do so, we first consider the number of cases per
million in each region, and then we pick donor counties in similar range, within 50% of the cases of the target county. Furthermore, to avoid overfitting, we use a low rank approximation
where we use three singular values for the matrix that has a
nominal rank at least 10x that number. Then, we compare the
synthetic model of each county with its actual behavior.
One factor which might have played a role in our analysis
is that since the spread started early in the North-East, enough
people may be infected and have “herd immunity”, which in
turn has slowed down the virus spread. Classical epidemiological models like SEIR show a natural slowdown in the disease
spread as the fraction of people susceptible goes down, and
“herd immunity” as a concept is often discussed [26]. While
the number is still being debated, scientists believe that when a
certain fraction of the population (20% − 70% are the figures
currently under debate) have already been infected and immune
to the disease, the region will reach herd immunity. A natural
question to explore given our dataset is that the different behaviors we observe can be simply attributed to "herd immunity"
or do other factors like active interventions play a part in the
spread of the disease. Our prior analysis has shown that the
North-Eastern states have generally had stricter lockdown measures, whether it is the speed of reopening or mask mandates or
restricting group indoor activities like bars and dining.
One experiment to conduct and resolve this question is to
look into the data at a county level. Different counties in the
same state have had different levels of infection, and if state
policies don’t matter as much as herd immunity levels, then
the spread of the disease in different counties post-Memorial
Day would be very different, depending on the infection level.
Moreover, different counties in the different clusters we identified can likely have similar behavior to each other, as long as 6 Conclusion

COVID-19. Our models indicate that an earlier lockdown could
have resulted in a significantly lower death count in New York,
and this is true of most other places. Further, by analyzing the
post-Memorial Day data at a county level, we show that intervention policies like mask mandates, mobility, and indoor dining/bar rules matter significantly in the spread of COVID-19.
Counties that have stricter lockdown and social distancing mandates behaved significantly better than equivalent counties (i.e.
with a similar infection level per capita) elsewhere with looser
rules.
