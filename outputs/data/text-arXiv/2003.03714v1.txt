Abstract
We comparatively analyzed the spatiotemporal fluctuations of the 2019-novel coronavirus
(COVID-19) and SARS outbreaks to understand their epidemiological characteristics.
Methodologically, we introduced TPL (Taylor’s power law) to characterize their spatiotemporal
heterogeneity/stability and Hubbell’s (2001) unified neutral theory of biodiversity (UNTB)
[specifically Harris et al. (2015) HDP-MSN model (hierarchical Dirichlet process—multi-site
neutral)] to approximate the metapopulation of coronavirus infections. First, TPL analysis
suggested that the coronaviruses appear to have a specific heterogeneity/stability scaling
parameter (TPL-b) slightly exceeding 2 for cumulative infections or exceeding 1 for daily
incremental infections, suggesting their potentially ‘chaotic’, unstable outbreaks. Another TPL
parameter (M0) (i.e., infection critical threshold) depends on virus kinds (COVID-19/SARS),
time (disease-stages), space (regions) and public-health interventions (e.g., quarantines and
mobility control). M0 measures the infection level, at which infections are random (Poisson
distribution) and below which infections follow uniform distribution and may die off if M0
coincides or below the level of Allee effects. For example, M0=5.758 (COVID-19, China, or
196=M0x34 in total) vs. M0=2.701 (COVID-19, World) vs. M0=9.475 (SARS, World) suggested
that the potentially ‘stabilized’ infection level of COVID-19 in China is nearly ½ lower than that
of SARS worldwide, but twice higher than that of COVID-19 worldwide. This may indicate that
COVID-19 outbreak seems nearly twice more risky than SARS, and the lower infection
threshold may be due to its lower lethality than SARS since lower fatality rates can facilitate the
survival and spread of pathogen. Second, metacommunity UNTB neutrality testing seems
appropriate for approximating metapopulation of coronavirus infections. Specifically, two
parameters θ and M, borrowed from neutral theory, may be used to assess the relative
1

significance of “infection through local contagion” vs. “infection through migration”, both of
which may depend on time, space, virus kinds, and particularly public-health interventions. Third,
comparing the levels of TPL-M0 and θ may leverage the complementary nature of TPL analysis
and metapopulation modeling. For example, their difference (θ–M0=0.6) for the COVID-19 in
China confirmed the critical importance of controlling migration (mobility) in suppressing the
outbreak, although migration may have been a primary driving force for the initial outbreaks in
several regions of China.

Introduction
The spatial and/or temporal distributions of many biological populations including microbes and
humans follows Taylor’s power law (TPL) (Taylor 1961, Taylor et al. 1977, 1983, 1988), and
recent studies have also revealed its applicability at the community scale (Ma 2012a, 2015, Li &
Ma 2019, Taylor 2019, Ma & Taylor 2020). TPL has been verified by hundreds if not thousands
of field observations in nature (Taylor 2019), and it has also found cross-disciplinary
applications beyond its original domains of biology and ecology in disciplines such as computer
science, natural disaster modeling, and experimental physics (Eisler et al. 2008, Ma 2012b, 2013,
Tippett & Cohen 2016, Helmrich et al. 2020). Despite that TPL was proposed more than a half
century ago (Taylor 1961) and there is not yet a consensus on the underlying mechanisms
generating TPL (Eisler 2008, Stumpf & Porter 2012), there seems to be a recent resurgence of
interests in this near universal model that captures the relationship between the population mean
(m) and variance (V) in the form of a simple power function (i.e., V=amb) (e.g., Cohen &
Schuster 2012, Cohen & Xu 2015, Giometto et al. 2015, Kalinin et al. 2018, Oh et al. 2016,
Reuman et al. 2017). Among the numerous existing studies on TPL, there have already been its
applications to the analyses of spatial variation of human population (Cohen et al. 2013), human
mortality (Bohk et al. 2015), and epidemiology (Rhodes & Anderson 1996). Given these
previous applications to human demography and epidemiology, we postulate that TPL should
also be applicable to the outbreak analyses of coronavirus infection diseases such as the still
ongoing 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) or COVID-19 (coronavirus-infected Pneumonia
disease) (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019) (Li et al. 2020,
2

Thompson et al. 2020, Kucharski et al. 2020, Zhang et al. 2020) and 2003 SARS (Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome) (https://www.who.int/csr/sars). In the present report, we test this
hypothesis and further explore possible epidemiological processes (mechanisms) underlying the
outbreak of COVID-19 infections.
While TPL can be harnessed to investigate the spatiotemporal fluctuations of coronaviruses,
specifically, the scaling (changes) law of coronaviruses infections over space and time, we also
aim to understand the spread of the virus infections from both local contagion (endemic) and
external migration (epidemic and pandemic) perspectives. Nevertheless, this can be rather
challenging given the lack of controlled experimental data, which is ethically infeasible to collect
obviously. In principle, all of the infections existing globally constitute a metapopulation of
people infected by the coronavirus, but constructing standard epidemiological models (e.g.,
Wang et al. 2018, Rivers et al. 2019) with existing data is rather difficult. We realized that
Hubbell’s (2001) neutral theory of biodiversity, which is one of the four major metacommunity
models (the other three include species sorting, mass effect, and patch dynamics) (Rosindell et
al. 2011, 2012; Vellend 2010, 2016), might be adapted to approximate the meta-population
dynamics. This approximation allows us to obtain, to the minimum, an educated guess for the
local contagion spread and global dispersal (migration) parameters of the coronavirus infections.
Overall, this study sets two primary objectives: (i) to investigate the spatiotemporal fluctuation
scaling law and (ii) to obtain an educated guess for the local contagion spread and global
migration parameters of the COVID-19 infections. In addition, we also perform comparative
analyses with the SARS to get more general insights on the epidemiology of coronavirus
infections. To the best of our knowledge, this should be the first systematic application of TPL
and UNTB in epidemiology, and obtained scaling/contagion/migration parameters should also be
of significant biomedical importance.

Datasets and Methods
Datasets of COVID-19 and SARS infections
We collected the worldwide, daily incremental and cumulative infections of 2019 novel
coronavirus (COVID-19) and SARS, respectively. For the datasets collected in China, the unit of
data collections was set to Chinese provinces. In addition, for the COVID-19 infections, we also
collected the datasets of 17 cities of Hubei province of China. For the worldwide COVID-19
3

infections, the unit of data collections was set to country or region recognized by the WHO
(world health organization). The date range for collecting the SARS data was between March
17 and August 7 of 2003 (136 days), and that for COVID-19 was between January 19 and Feb
29, 2020 (40 Days). Since the COVID-19 infections are still continuing, the analyses conducted
in this report may be updated periodically.
TPL (Taylor’s power law) fluctuation scaling law for the infections of coronaviruses
Taylor (1961) discovered that the relationship between mean abundance (m) and corresponding
variance (V) of biological populations follows the following power function,
V = am b ,

(1)

where b is termed population aggregation parameter and is thought to be species-specific, and a
is initially thought to be related to sampling schemes used to obtain the data. The relationship is
€
known as Taylor’s power law (TPL) in literature, and it has been validated by hundreds, if not
thousands of field observations worldwide (Taylor 2019). With a simple log-transformation, TPL
can be converted into the following log-linear model:
ln(V ) = ln(a) + bln(m) .

(2)

TPL was initially discovered in fitting the spatial or cross-sectional sampling data (Taylor 1961)
and later found that it is equally applicable to temporal or time-series sampling data (Taylor
€
2019). In the context of time-series modeling, b measures the population stability (variability).
More recently, it was found that TPL can be extended to community level from its original
population level (Ma 2015). At the community level, the four Taylor’s power law extensions
(TPLE), can be used to measure the community spatial (temporal) heterogeneity (stability) (Type
I & II), as well as mixed-species level spatial (temporal) heterogeneity (stability) (Type III & IV)
(Ma 2015, Li & Ma 2019, Ma & Taylor 2020). Note that the term aggregation at the population
level can be considered as the counterpart of heterogeneity at the community level.
In general, there are two important aspects related to the applications of TPL. First, test the
fitting of the TPL model to the datasets under evaluations (such as SARS or COVID-19
infections). The testing determines the applicability of TPL based on well-established statistics
such as p-value or R (linear correlation coefficient). Second, interpret the TPL parameters based
on both the general principle of TPL (explained above) and system- or data-specific information
(such as the biology of COVID or SARS).

4

Specifically, regarding the first aspect or the fitting of TPL, we adopt two fitting approaches: one
is the simple linear regression via log-transformation [Eqn. (2)] and another is the geometric
mean regression (GMR) (Clark and Perry 1995, Warton et al 2007). The advantage of the first
approach is its computational simplicity and the advantage of the second or GMR is that it is
more robust for small sample size (N<15 according to Clark and Perry 1995). Both approaches
preserve the scale invariance of power law. Regarding the second aspect or the interpretation of
the TPL, there is controversy on the claim that TPL parameter (b) is species specific, in
particular when there are changes in sampling method, life stage, environment or spatial scale
(Taylor et al. 1988, Clark and Perry 1995). Our opinion is that, unlike parameter a, parameter b
is primarily shaped by evolutionary forces and less influenced by ecological or environmental
factors. However, we do not take the “invariance” or “constancy” at ecological time scale or with
environmental factors as granted. Instead, we draw conclusions based on rigorous statistical tests
of the differences in parameter b among treatments. In the case of this study, we perform the
permutation (randomization) test to judge whether or not the TPL parameters are invariant. For
further information on the randomization test, readers are referred to Collingridge (2013).
To further harness the TPL parameters, Ma (1991, 2012a, 2015) derived a third parameter (M0)
for TPL or its extensions at the community scale, population aggregation critical density at the
population scale or community critical heterogeneity at the community scale, which is in the
form of:
M 0 = exp[ln(a) /(1 − b)]

(a > 0, b ≠ 1),

(3)

where a & b are TPL parameter. M0 is the level of mean population abundance, the COVID-19
or SARS infection level in the case of this study, at which the fluctuation (dynamics) of virus
€
infection is random (following Poisson statistical distribution generally). When m>M0, the
population (infection) fluctuation (dynamics) is more irregular than random (often following
highly skewed distributions such as the negative binomial distribution or power-law statistical
distribution). In this case, population is highly unstable and the infection may expand
continuously. When m<M0, the infection fluctuation is regular and may follow the uniform
statistical distribution. In this case, the inflection level should be stabilized or might even die off.
When m=M0, the infection is random and should follow Poisson distribution statistically. In the
context of this study, we term PACD or M0 as mean infection critical threshold or mean infection
threshold, which is similar to classic Allee effects (Allee 1927). Although the both are similar
conceptually, it should be emphasized that they have different ecological interpretations. In
particular, when m=M0, it means that the population spatial distribution or temporal stability
5

(variability) is random; when m<M0, the distribution or stability is regular or uniform. Whether
or not the population may die off is uncertain. If m happens to coincide with the threshold of
Allee effects, population (infections) may indeed die off.

Approximating metapopulation with metacommunity model: Hubbell’s (2001)
UNTB and Harris et al. (2015) HDP-MSN model
Hubbell’s (2001) UNTB (Unified Neutral Theory of Biodiversity) conceptually distinguishes
between local community dynamics and metacommunity dynamics, both of which are assumed
to be driven by similar neutral processes—stochastic drifts in species demography, local
speciation and global dispersal (migration). The UNTB has two key parameters (elements): (i)
the immigration rate (Ii) that controls the coupling of a local community to the metacommunity;
(ii) the speciation rate (also known as the fundamental biodiversity number θ) that can be
interpreted as the rate at which new individuals are added to the metacommunity due to
speciation. The UNTB assumes that the SAD (species abundance distribution) of each
community sample can be described by the multinomial (MN) distribution, which is
parameterized by the previously mentioned two parameters. Testing the UNTB model is then
computationally equivalent to testing the goodness-of-fitting to the MN distribution. However, a
fully general case of fitting multiple sites UNTB with different immigration rates is
computationally extremely challenging (actually intractable) even for small number of sites. In
other words, to test the UNTB in truly multi-site (multiple local communities), approximate
algorithms must be used (Harris et al. 2015). It was Harris et al. (2015) that developed an
efficient Bayesian fitting framework for testing the UNTB by approximating the neutral models
with the hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP). For this reason, we refer to the computational
framework developed by Harris et al. (2015) as HDP-MSN (hierarchical Dirichlet process—
multi-site neutral) model.
It was found that for large local population sizes, assuming a fixed finite-dimensional
metacommunity distribution with S species present, the local community distribution (πi) could
be approximated by a Dirichlet distribution (Sloan et al 2006 & 2007). Based on this finding,
Harris et al. (2015) developed their computationally efficient, general framework for
approximating the UNTB. Assuming a potentially infinite number of species can be observed in
the local community, the stationary distribution of observing local population i can be modeled
with a Dirichlet process (DP), i.e.,
6

π i Ii , β ~ DP(Ii , β)

(4)

where β = ( β1,..., βS ) is the relative frequency of each species in the metacommunity.

€

€
At the metacommunity level, a Dirichlet process is also applicable and the metacommunity

distribution can be modeled with a stick breaking process, i.e.,
(5)

β ~ Stick(θ )

Given that both local community and metacommunity follow Dirichlet processes, the problem
can be formulated as a hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP) in the domain of machine learning
€
(Teh et al. 2006, Harris et al. 2015).
Furthermore, Dirichlet process (DP) can be formulated as the so-called Chinese restaurant
process, from which Antoniak equation (Antoniak 1974) can be derived. The Antoniak equation
represents for the number of types (or species) (S) observed following N draws from a Dirichlet
process with concentration parameter θ, and is with the following form:
P(S θ ,N) = s(N,S)θ S

Γ(θ )
Γ(θ + N)

(6)

where s(N, S) is the unsigned Stirling number of the first kind and Γ(.) is the gamma function.
€
By combining previous equations (4-6) and the previously mentioned multi-nominal (MN)

distribution of the community samples, Harris et al. (2015) obtained their full HDP-MSN model
(hierarchical Dirichlet process—multisite neutral). They further developed an efficient Gibbs
sampler for the UNTB-HDP approximation, which is a type of Bayesian Markov Chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) algorithm.
By treating the coronavirus infections at different sites (e.g., provinces of China, or different
countries/regions of the world, in this study) as a “metacommunity” consisting of N local
communities (e.g., each local community corresponding to a province), the above-described
metacommunity model can be built with the dataset of daily incremental infections, nationally or
internationally. Different from traditional metacommunity concept, here the “metacommunity”
is actually a metapopulation consisting of N local populations. However, if we treat the local
infections at a particular time point (e.g., day) as a local sub-population, then the virus subpopulations at different time points can be considered as a total population (or “species” in the
terminology of community ecology). With this conceptual transformation, the concept and
7

models for metacommunity and Hubbell’s UNTB can be readily applied to the metapopulation
of coronavirus infections without a need to revise the models. With this adaptive scheme, the
fundamental biodiversity number (speciation rate: θ) from the previously introduced HDP-MSN
model can be used to approximate the average local (contagion) infection rate. Similarly, the
fundamental dispersal number (M) can be used to approximate the average infection rate through
migration. The migration probability (m), which is a function of M, has a similar interpretation
as M, but simply in the form of probability.
As a side note, we expect that the coronavirus infections should follow Hubbell’s (2001) UNTB
theory, which is not surprising to us, due to our treatment of metapopulation as metacommunity.
This is because the “species” in our “metacommunity” are, in fact, populations of a single virus
species, and they should be “equivalent” in terms of the neutral theory. Therefore, whether or not
the coronavirus infections satisfy the neutral theory model, specifically Harris et al. (2015) HDPMSN model, is not our focus. Instead, we focus on the estimated parameters from HDP-MSN
modeling and their interpretations to explore their implications to the outbreak of virus infections.
Of course, if the neutral theory model fails to fit the virus infections data statistically, we stop
pursuing the interpretations of their parameters.

Results
From Tables 1-2, which were summarized from Tables S1-S8 in the OSI (online supplementary
information), we obtain the following findings, which are also illustrated with Figs 1-7.
(i) The spatiotemporal fluctuation scaling (changes) of COVID-19 infections follow TPL
(Taylor’s power law) at all scales (schemes) tested, including world-wide, country-wide,
cumulative and daily incremental infections, as well as gradually shrunken partial datasets to test
TPL robustness, as evidenced by the p-value<0.001 from the TPL fittings. The brief results were
summarized in Table 1 and the detailed results were displayed in Tables S1-S2 and S4-S7. It was
discovered that the infections of COVID-19, like populations of other organisms, follow seeming
universal power law. This implies that the infection of the novel coronavirus is highly contagious
and its outbreak (spread) is chaotically unstable in general, as indicated by the b-values
exceeding 1 (for daily incremental infection) or exceeding 2 (for cumulative infections).

8

(ii) The TPL aggregation (stability) parameter (b) for COVID-19 seems rather stable or even
invariant, as evidenced by the randomization tests (Tables S3 & S8). The randomization tests
were performed by statistically comparing the model parameters fitted with the whole datasets
and those fitted with the “partial datasets.” The schemes of partial datasets were devised by
removing 1, 2, … ... 15 days data from either head or tail of the dataset to test the robustness of
TPL model and to test the invariance of the model parameters. It was found that, while TPL-b
seems rather stable and even invariant with disease kinds (COVID-19 or SARS). Instead, the
TPL parameters a & M0 seem variable, suggesting their potential roles in assessing and
interpreting the stability of the virus infections. For example, the difference in TPL-b values for
worldwide COVID-19 and SARS infections (2.076 vs. 2.023) is not statistically significant (pvalue=0.874 (Table S8 for cumulative TPL modeling). Therefore, we postulate that the TPL-b
may be coronavirus specific and may be primarily shaped by evolutionary forces.
(iii) The population aggregation critical density (PACD or M0) (i.e., infection critical threshold)
seems to depend on disease kinds (COVID-19 or SARS), space (regions), and time (stage of
disease outbreak), as indicated by the randomization test results (Table S3 & S8). Given that M0
measures the infection threshold at which infections are random (or follow Poisson distribution),
a lower M0 may indicate a lower infection “tolerance” level since crossing the level of M0 may
signal the highly variable (unstable) infections. For example (see Table 1), M0=5.758 for
COVID-19 in China, M0=2.701 for COVID-19 worldwide, M0=9.475 for SARS worldwide may
suggest that the infection tolerance level of COVID-19 in China is about twice higher than that
of the worldwide, but about ½ lower than that of worldwide SARS infections. In other words, the
COVID-19 infections seem more “dangerous” than SARS from a public health perspective.
Note that M0 is the mean infection level; therefore, it can be more meaningful to convert it into
absolute value from a biomedical perspective. For example, M0=5.758 for COVID-19 in China,
when converted to total national infection level, would be 5.758x34 (provinces)=196. This
threshold number may suggest that when the number of total infections nationally is at this level,
the infections are random. When infections exceed this threshold level, the infections can be nonrandom and highly unstable. When infections are below this threshold level, the infection should
be rather stable (following a Uniform distribution statistically) or may even die off if the
threshold level coincides with the level of Allee effects. Since the level of Allee effects is still
unknown, whether or not the infections under M0 will die off is still an open question.
9

(iv) As expected, all datasets passed the neutrality tests of HDP-MSN model as indicated by the
p-value>0.05 (Table 2). We use the ratio of Q=M/θ as a measure of the relative importance of
“infection spread via migration” vs. “infections spread via local contagion” in spreading the
infections, with larger Q indicating higher migration role and smaller Q indicating higher local
contagion. The ratio of Q=133.581/6.325≈21 (Table 2) indicating that spread via migration is
approximately 21 times more significant than spread via local contagion on average nationally in
China. However, the worldwide Q ratio is approximately Q=1 (8.037/10.801). Therefore, the
ratio Q is dependent on time (disease stages), space (regions), and disease-kinds (COVID-19 or
SARS), and perhaps most importantly, public-health interventions such as quarantines and/or
mobility control.
Compared with COVID-19, SARS appeared to exhibit a different pattern of the relative
importance of migration vs. local contagion in spreading the infections. We postulate that this
difference might signal the higher risk of pandemics of COVID-19 compared with SARS.
Nevertheless, we cannot exclude the possibility that the range of SARS datasets were complete,
while COVID-19 infections are not over yet.
The third parameter (m) or immigration probability suggests the level of infection via migration.
The m=0.052 in China vs. m=0.003 worldwide for COVID-19 suggested that the risk of infection
via migration within China is approximately 10 times higher than that of worldwide migration.
This is most likely due to the disruption of international travels. Comparing the m for COVID19 and SARS for worldwide data (0.003 for COVID-19 vs. 0.040 for SARS) may simply be due
to stronger travel restrictions imposed for controlling COVID-19 outbreaks. Similar to the above
comparison, this difference may be due to the difference in the data range.
(v) Comparing the PACD (M0) (Table 1) and θ in (Table 2) exhibited a very interesting
phenomenon. For the cumulative infections in China, both parameters (M0 and θ) are rather close
to each other. For example, the difference between M0=5.758 of COVID-19 in China (Table 1)
and θ=6.325 of COVID-19 in China (Table 2) is only approximately 0.6. We postulate that,
when the “local speciation (contagion)” (θ) approximates the population aggregation critical
density or infection critical threshold (M0), the infections could become random (suggesting a
potentially stabilized infection level). That is, without inputs from external migration, local
infections via local contagion (measured by θ) could become random (as indicated by M0). If this
10

postulation is true, then it may suggest that the mobility control (such as travel restrictions or
quarantines) can be critically effective in stabilizing outbreaks. This finding indicates the
complementary nature of the two approaches we adopted in this study. Nevertheless, it is
important to reiterate that this closeness between M0 and θ (M0≈θ) is likely to be an exception,
rather than the “norm”, for the reasons explained below.
As to the lack of closeness between M0 and θ of COVID-19 at worldwide scale (M0=2.701 vs.
θ=10.801), this may indicate that control mobility is not sufficient to stabilize infections world
widely anymore at the current stage.

In the case of SARS, the worldwide M0=9.475 vs.

θ=27.169, indicated that local contagion (θ) alone already exceed the infection critical threshold
(M0). Therefore, θ >> M0 (PACD) may be the “norm.”

Conclusions and Discussion
We aimed to discover critical insights on the endemic/epidemic/pandemic characteristics of the
coronavirus outbreaks. Methodically, we first apply the TPL (Taylor 1961, 2019) scaling law for
measuring spatial (temporal) heterogeneity (stability) to shed important lights on the stability of
coronavirus infection outbreak. We then apply Hubbell’s (2001) UNTB (specifically Harris et al.
2015 HDP-MSN model) to approximate the metapopulation of coronavirus outbreak and to
estimate the critical metapopulation parameters that may offer insights on the relative importance
of migration vs. local contagion in driving or suppressing virus outbreaks. Furthermore, both
TPL and metapopulation modeling complemented each other and revealed the five findings
explained in the previous sections, from which we further summarize the following insights and
discuss their implications below.
First, the coronavirus infections, including both COVID-19 and SARS appear to possess
characteristic stability parameter (b) values, slightly exceeding 2 in terms of the daily cumulative
infections and exceeding 1 in terms of the daily incremental infections. As suggested by the
literature of TPL, when the TPL parameter (b) exceeds 2, the population dynamics can be rather
chaotic, indicating potentially chaotic behavior of coronavirus outbreaks. The TPL-b values for
both the coronaviruses are at the high end of the b-value range in population ecology, compared
with the b-values of most microbial and macrobial species in existing literature, which are
usually b<2.
11

While TPL-b appears rather stable or even invariant with time and/or space, the population
aggregation critical density (PACD) (i.e., M0 or infection critical threshold), which is the level at
which infections are random and below which infections may be stabilized, can depend on
disease kinds (COVID-19 or SARS), time (disease or outbreak stages), and space (regions). We
postulate that M0 should also be influenced by public-health interventions such as quarantines
and travel restrictions. Therefore, M0 can be an important epidemiological parameter for
evaluating the characteristics of disease outbreaks.

For example, COVID-19 exhibited

significantly lower threshold (M0) than SARS, suggesting a potentially lower infection
“tolerance” threshold of COVID-19. Nevertheless, it should be cautioned that the “tolerance”
threshold only means the level of random infections, which may signal the level of stabilized
infections. However, whether or not the “tolerance” threshold is biometrically tolerable or safe
depends on other biomedical characteristics, among which Allee effects can be a critical factor to
determine whether or not the infections will die off or persist. We postulate that if M0 coincide or
is below the level Allee effects in action, the infections may die off.
Second, all datasets we tested easily passed the neutrality test with HDP-MSN and indicated that
the approximation of the metapopulation with metacommunity in the case of coronavirus
infections is feasible. Two parameters from the HDP-MSN, i.e., fundamental biodiversity
number (θ) and fundamental dispersal number (M) measure the average infections from local
“speciation” (i.e., local contagion) and average infections from “dispersal” (migration) from
other local populations. In other words, θ measures the spread level from local contagion and M
measures spread level from external migration. A third parameter migration probability (m) is a
function of fundamental dispersal number (M), measures the probability of infections from
migration. All three parameters can depend on disease kinds (COVID-19 or SARS), time
(disease stage), space (regions), as well as public-health interventions (such as quarantines,
mobility control and/or isolation for treatments).
The ratio of Q=M/θ may be used as a measure of the relative importance of “infection spread via
migration” vs. “infections spread via local contagion” in spreading the infections, with larger Q
indicating higher migration role and smaller Q indicating higher local contagion.
Third, both the TPL scaling law and metapopulation modeling may complement each other. The
difference (closeness) between M0 (the infection critical threshold from TPL) and θ (local
12

contagion or “speciation” rate from metapopulation modeling) may signal the effectiveness of
completely blocking the migration (dispersal) in spreading infections. For example, in the case of
COVID-19 infections in China, both parameters (M0 and θ) are rather close to each other and
their difference is only approximately 0.6, suggesting that, without external inputs, the infections
from local contagion is only approximately 0.6 higher than the infection critical threshold (M0).
This makes the mission of controlling local contagion for stabilizing infections much less
challenging than the mission when θ >> M0.
Finally, we suggest that the approaches demonstrated previously should be of general
applicability for epidemiological research. In particular, we consider TPL-b can be a pathogen
specific parameter, primarily shaped by evolutionary forces. Another TPL parameter, Ma (1991,
2015) PACD (population aggregation critical density) or infection critical threshold (M0), as
renamed in this study in the context of coronavirus infections, may be particular useful for
assessing critical threshold for stabilizing infections (outbreaks). A lower M0 may signal a lower
threshold for the occurrence of outbreak, which may imply higher outbreak risk from a public
health perspective. Previously, we have shown that COVID-19 appears to have a higher outbreak
risk compared with SARS. Given that both of the coronaviruses appear to have virtually equal bvalues, then one wonders if they have any essential differences, revealed in this study, from the
epidemiological or public-health perspectives. M0 (infection critical threshold) seems to be such
an effective indicator (property) for assessing outbreak threshold (risk). Our study suggested that
COVID-19 possesses a lower infection critical threshold (M0) than SARS does may be explained
by its lower fatality rate compared with SARS. Obviously lower lethality to hosts should actually

*Given the minor differences from both LLR and GMR approaches and N>15, we adopted the results from LLR.
**P-value<0.001 indicated that all the model fittings are statistically significant. R (linear correlation coefficient)
further confirmed exceptional significance level of TPL fittings.

*θ: Local contagion rate; M: Mean migration rate; m: immigration probability; N=2500 is the number of Gibb
samples selected from 25000 simulated communities performed to test the fitting of Harris et al. (2015) HDP-MSN
model; NM & NL are the number of simulations that passed the neutrality test (by comparing with actual daily
incremental infection numbers), respectively. PM and PL are the pseudo-P values from performing the neutrality test
at metapopulation and local population levels, respectively. When pseudo-P value>0.05, it indicates that the dataset
satisfied the neutral model, and the parameters (θ, M, and m) can be harnessed to assess and interpret the relative
importance of local contagion vs. migration in driving outbreaks of coronaviruses infections.
