Abstract— COVID-19 has been one of the most severe diseases,
causing a harsh pandemic all over the world, since December 2019.
The aim of this study is to evaluate the value of Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM) Networks in forecasting the total number of
COVID-19 cases in Turkey. The COVID-19 data for 30 days,
between March 24 and April 23, 2020, are used to estimate the next
fifteen days. The mean absolute error of the LSTM Network for
15 days estimation is 1,69±1.35%. Whereas, for the same data, the
error of the Box-Jenkins method is 3.24±1.56%, Prophet method
is 6.88±4.96% and Holt-Winters Additive method with Damped
Trend is 0.47±0.28%. Additionally, when the number of deaths
data is also provided with the number of total cases to the input of
LSTM Network, the mean error reduces to 0.99±0.51%.
Consequently, addition of the number of deaths data to the input,
results a lower error in forecasting, compared to using only the
number of total cases as the input. However, Holt-Winters
Additive method with Damped Trend gives superior results to
LSTM Networks in forecasting the total number of COVID-19
cases.

I. INTRODUCTION
COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It was first
identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has since
spread globally, resulting in an ongoing pandemic. The
governments have been making an effort to oversee the cases
and fatalities in their countries; to forecast their future position,
evaluate how effective taken decisions are, what would happen
if the public conforms to the restrictions. The estimation of
COVID-19 cases has been the subject of many studies since the
novel coronavirus disease.
Time series forecasting methods have been applied in a
variety of fields such as finance, supply and demand prediction,
signal processing, tracking corporate business metrics, and
health monitoring. As a given vector of historical time series
values T = [t1, t2, . . ., tN] ∈ R N, a prevalent task in time series
analysis is to forecast future values ťN+1,ťN+2, . . . based on the
time-series data. Time series forecasting methods basically can
be defined under two main categories: traditional statistical
methods and methods based on machine learning models [6].

A variety of statistical and machine learning models, such as
Box-Jenkins (ARIMA), Prophet, Holt-Winters Additive Model
(HWAAS), and Gauss Model, have been used to forecast the
number of cases of COVID-19 [1,2,5,18].
Hu, et.al. developed a modified stacked auto-encoder for
modeling the transmission dynamics of the epidemics. They
applied this model to real-time forecasting the curves of
cumulative confirmed cases of Covid-19 across China from
January 20 to April 20, 2020. Using the multiple-step
forecasting, the estimated average errors of 6-step, 7-step, 8step, 9-step and 10-step forecasting were 1.64%, 2.27%, 2.14%,
2.08%, 0.73%, respectively [2].
In Yonar, et.al. [1], the number of COVID-19 cases of the
selected G8 countries, Germany, United Kingdom, France, Italy,
Russian, Canada, Japan, and Turkey between January 22 and
March 22, 2020 have been estimated using curve estimation
models, namely; Box-Jenkins (ARIMA) and Brown/Holt linear
exponential smoothing. The mean absolute percentage error of
ARIMA (1,4,0) for Turkey was reported as % 2.578 [1].
According to Papastefanopoulos, et.al., Holt-Winters
Additive Model (HWAAS) model showed the best performance
compared to the others models in forecasting the active cases per
population in Turkey [18].
In the last years, despite many models, Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM) neural network has shown great performance
in time series forecasting [4,7]. The LSTM neural network is a
special kind of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), capable of
learning long-term dependencies. LSTMs were introduced by
Hochreiter&Schmidhuber [9] and were refined and popularized
by many studies. The LSTM architecture was able to take care
of the vanishing gradient problem in the traditional RNN.
The main purpose of this study is to help nations and their
health care systems by forecasting positive cases in Turkey using
LSTM neural network. We propose that LSTM networks are
effective tools in short-term time series forecast the COVID-19
confirmed cases in Turkey.

II.METHOD
A.Dataset
The official total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases and
deaths between 11 March 2020 and 8 May 2020, which are
reported by the Republic of Turkey Ministry of Health, are used
in the study [8]. The links to dataset, as well as the source codes
are provided in the Appendix.
B.The LSTM Architecture
The network consists of an LSTM Block which is followed by
the dense layer (the regular fully-connected neural network
layer). The LSTM layer has 32 units which is the
dimensionality of the hidden state at the proposed network. The
network is designed as a cycle for recursive multi-step time
series forecasting values of multiple future days [4]. The
diagram of the network architecture is illustrated in Fig.1. In
this cycle, the output is to be used as a new input to complete
multi-step forecasting. Finally, all outputs, before going into the
loop, are stored as results. The input is normalized to the range
of 0 to 1. The optimization is done with the “Adam” [19]. The
network is trained with 2000 epochs and one batch size.

Fig. 2. The diagram of LSTM Block.

C. Forecasting Schemes of The LSTM Neural Network
Three different forecasting schemes have been used:
1) The First Schema (u1): The first schema is one-step
prediction of the next day. The total number of cases in Turkey
is used to estimate the next day’s result. The input data is based
on 30 days between March 24 and May 8, 2020.
2) The Second Schema (u2): The total number of cases for
the next fifteen days are estimated using recursive approach in
the second schema (see Fig. 1.). In the u2 schema, the number
of total cases for 30 days between March 24 and April 23, 2020,
is used as the input data.
3) The Third Schema (u3): The third schema is to estimate
next 15 days recursively, similar to u2. The difference is that
the total number of deaths was added to the input data of the
third schema. The total number of confirmed cases and deaths
for 30 days, between March 24 and April 23, 2020 in Turkey
are used as the input data.

Fig. 1. The Network Architecture for the Recursive Forecasting

The LSTM block, given in the diagram in Fig. 2., has four main
parts: an input gate, a forget gate, an output gate, and selfconnected memory cells. The input gate decides which new
information will enter the memory cell. The output gate decides
what cell activations to filter at the output. The forget gate helps
the network to forget the past input data and reset the memory
cell [4]. The LSTM block, used in this study, is defined by the
following equations [3]:
𝑖𝑡 = 𝜎(𝑊𝑖𝑥 𝑥𝑡 + 𝑊𝑖ℎ ℎ𝑡−1 + 𝑏𝑖 )
𝑓𝑡 = 𝜎(𝑊𝑓𝑥 𝑥𝑡 + 𝑊𝑓ℎ ℎ𝑡−1 + 𝑏𝑓 )
𝑜𝑡 = 𝜎(𝑊𝑜𝑥 𝑥𝑡 + 𝑊𝑜ℎ ℎ𝑡−1 + 𝑏𝑜 )
𝑐𝑡 = 𝑓𝑡 ⊙ 𝑐𝑡−1 + 𝑖𝑡 ⊙ 𝑔(𝑊𝑐𝑥 𝑥𝑡 + 𝑊𝑐ℎ ℎ𝑡−1 + 𝑏𝑐 )
ℎ𝑡 = 𝑜𝑡 ⊙ 𝑔(𝑐𝑡 )

(1)

where it , ft , ot , and ct represent input gate, forget gate, output
gate, and memory cell, respectively. Input, and hidden layer
activation at time t are xt and ht. W’s and b’s denote weights and
biases, respectively. σ represents the logistic sigmoid function.
In this study, exponential linear unit (elu) is used as the g
function. ⊙ denotes element-wise multiplication.

D. Other Models
In order to compare with the proposed LSTM neural network,
the Box-Jenkins (ARIMA) method, Prophet, Holt-Winter’s
Additive Model with Damped Trend are implemented. In these
models, the total number of cases for 30 days in Turkey,
between March 24 and April 23, 2020, are used to estimate the
next fifteen days.
1) Box-Jenkins Method (ARIMA): The Autoregressive
Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model is a combination
of the differenced autoregressive model with the moving
average model. The ARIMA model is effective in fitting
historical data with this combination approach and helpful for
forecasting future points in a time series [11]. Box-Jenkins
method contains ARIMA models that were applied to the series
that are non-stationary but are made stationary with the
difference operation on the series, and widely used for time
series analysis [2,10]. In this study, ARIMA model is used with
(6,1,0) orders.
2) Prophet, Automatic Forecasting Procedure: Prophet,
Automatic Forecasting Procedure [13] is a method of
forecasting time series data based on an additional model where
non-linear trends are fit with yearly, weekly, daily, seasonal,
and, holiday effects. Also, it shows the best performance with
time series that have strong seasonal effects and historical data
of several seasons[12]. In its structure, it is a regression
procedure with interpretable parameters. Prophet, Automatic

Forecasting Procedure is robust to lacking data and shifts in the
trend, and typically performs outliers well [13].
3) Holt-Winter’s Additive Model With Damped Trend: Holt
(1957) and Winters (1960) [16] extended Holt's method [15] to
capture seasonality. Also, Gardner & McKenzie (1985) came
up with a parameter that "dampens" the trend to a flat line
sometime in the future [14]. A method that often provides
accurate forecasts for seasonal data is the Holt-Winters method
with a damped trend and multiplicative seasonality [16,17]. In
this study 0.96 is used as the ratio of damping slope.

estimation results of different methods are given in Table 2 and
Fig. 4. In Fig. 4, U2 schema of the LSTM network is reported
to have exactly the same input for all methods.

III.RESULTS
The whole training process of all schemes of LSTMs has
taken about 15 minutes with an NVidia GeForce GTX 960M
GPU, whereas the other models were completed in a short
duration.
For each method, the error in estimated total number of
cases are quantified by the absolute percentage error (APE)
metric, according to (3) and given in Table 1.

In order to compare the effect of the chosen activation
function g in (1), the LSTM schemes are implemented with
hyperbolic tangent function and exponential linear unit (elu).
Mean estimation errors are given in Table 1. In line with these
results, for the rest of the study, the exponential linear unit (elu)
is used as the activation function of the LSTM network.

IV.DISCUSSION
In this study, the value of Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) Networks in forecasting the total number of COVID19 cases in Turkey was evaluated.
The LSTM Network was implemented with two different
activation functions. Using exponential linear unit (elu) instead
of common choice of hyperbolic tangent (tanh) resulted better
performance in forecasting the total number of COVID-19
cases.
LSTMs neural network has shown more successful
performance, compared to the ARIMA model (6,1,0) and
Prophet. However, Holt-Winters Additive method with
Damped Trend gave superior results to LSTM Networks in
forecasting the total number of COVID-19 cases. Prophet has
shown the worst performance.
Addition of the number of deaths data to the input of the
LSTM Network, resulted a lower error in forecasting, compared
to using only the number of total cases as the input.
In conclusion, it has been observed that the artificial
intelligence neural network can be used in the medical field,
especially for the prediction of conditions in a severe pandemic
such as Covid-19. Therefore, nations can be more prepared to
take the necessary precautions in advance, impose the required
restrictions in time and be able to observe the possible scenarios
that may occur in a case of alteration.
