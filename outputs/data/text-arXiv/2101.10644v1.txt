Abstract. In this paper, we propose a time-dependent Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-RecoveredDied (SEIRD) reaction-diffusion system for the COVID-19 pandemic and we deal with its derivation from a kinetic model. The derivation is obtained by mathematical description delivered at
the micro-scale of individuals. Our approach is based on the micro-macro decomposition which
leads to an equivalent formulation of the kinetic model which couples the microscopic equations
with the macroscopic equations. We develop a numerical asymptotic preservation scheme to
solve the kinetic model. The proposed approach is validated by various numerical tests where
particular attention is paid to the Moroccan situation against the actual pandemic.

1. Introduction
In December 2019, the outbreak of the new coronavirus called COVID-19 caused by severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) first occurred in Wuhan, China. It is
spreading so fast and has spread to almost other countries around the world. Therefore, the
World Health Organization declared it to be a pandemic since March 11, 2020. Unfortunately, this
pandemic so severely affects the economy, health, security of society. Currently, as of January 17,
2021 more than 95,013,471 people are infected and more than 2,032,253 have died from this virus,
see update data in [1].
As it is known, mathematical models can help in many tasks, for example verifying different
epidemic scenarios, estimating transmission parameters, testing various hypotheses, and better understanding the mechanisms of contagion. In fact, it provides decisions to optimize possible control
strategies, such as containment measures, lockdowns, and vaccination campaigns. However, several models have been proposed to describe the evolution of epidemics which can be collective
models or network models. We mention that collective models describe the spread of the epidemic
in a population using a limited number of collective variables with a small number of parameters. We can find logistic models [26, 41], generalized growth models [15], Richards models [33],
Susceptible-Infected-Recovered models (SIR) [6, 26] and SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-InfectiousRemoved) models [15]. Note that SIR, SEIR, and other similar models belong to the class of
compartmental models, see [12, 15, 35]. On the other hand, network models treat a population
as a network of interacting individuals, and the contagion process is described at the microscopic
level, see for example [23, 42].
Recently, several mathematical models have been proposed and developed to understand the
dynamics of COVID-19, see e.g [4, 8, 13, 17, 18, 19, 27, 28, 30, 31, 37, 39, 43]. However, in this
paper we are interested in a collective modified SEIRD model. Specifically, the improved model is

In all of the above equations, the constants di ; i = 1, · · · , 4 are the diffusivity constants. A
description of all variables and parameters used in the aforementioned system (1.1) is presented
in tables 1 and 2 respectively. The scheme is illustrated in Figure 1. Note that if A = µ = 0 and
xi = ∞, the (1.1) system is reduced to the classic SIR system which means that it has no latent
period. Let us now briefly describe the significance of the variables: S is the number of individuals
likely to be exposed, while E is the number of individuals exposed, this number constitutes a
class where the disease is latent and the individuals are infected and non-infectious. Different
processes can occur. For example, Susceptible may become Exposed due to contact with infectious
individuals and transmission function. Additionally, Exposed can become infectious with a ξ rate
and infectious recover with a γ rate. We recall that we consider a time-dependent transmission
rate function, which incorporates the impact of government action (i.e total or partial lockdown),
wearing the mask and respecting sanitary protocol such as the social distance. A typical example
is a step-wise function, see Section 4.

KINETIC DERIVATION OF A TIME-DEPENDENT SEIRD REACTION-DIFFUSION SYSTEM FOR COVID-19 3

Figure 1. The flow diagram of spatially homogeneous SIERD model
Note that in the absence of the diffusion terms (di = 0, i = 1, · · · 4) and that the transmission
rate is constant (i.e β(t) = β), system (1.1) reduces to a spatially homogeneous SEIRD problem,
see for e.g. [3, 16, 21, 22, 24, 32]. However, if we assume that di 6= 0 we obtain a spatially
inhomogeneous SEIRD problem, among others we cite [29, 36]. Comparing to the mentioned
papers above, in this paper we propose a time-dependent SEIRD reaction-diffusion system, where
the aim is to take into account the fast change in time of the transmission rate function. In fact,
this help to well model the different strategies taken to defeat the virus, for instance partial or
total lockdown and now the vaccination. In passing, we would like to mention that the basic
reproduction ratio, denoted by R0 , is the classical epidemiological measure associated with the
reproductive power of the disease. It is used to estimate the growth of the viral epidemic. For our
system (1.1) it is given by
ξ
R0 (t) =
β(t).
(1.4)
(ξ + µ)(γ + α + µ)
Note that R0 (t) provides a threshold for disease-free equilibrium point stability. Precisely, if
R0 (t) < 1, the disease goes out; while if R0 (t) > 1, an epidemic occurs, see e.g. [21, 40].
In this paper, we deal with the derivation of the time-dependent SEIRD reaction-diffusion
system (1.1) from kinetic model by using the micro-macro decomposition method. The main idea
of this method consists in rewriting the kinetic model as coupled system of microscopic part and
macroscopic one. Many works used this method within different fields of application. For instance,
chemotaxis phenomena in the basis of the famous Keller-Segel model [7], formation of patterns
induced by cross-diffusion in a fluid [5, 11]. In fact, this technique has been adopted to design a
numerical scheme that preserves the asymptotic property introduced by [20, 25]. In other words,
a stable numerical scheme in the limit along the transition from kinetic to macroscopic regimes.
This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we summarize the micro-macro method which
leads to the derivation of system (1.1) from a kinetic model. Section 3 is devoted to the development
of an asymptotic preserving numerical (AP)-scheme in one dimension, inspiring from the paper
by [5]. In other words, the uniform stability with respect to the parameter ε and the consistency
with the reaction-diffusion limit. In Section 4, we present the numerical simulations obtained
from micro-macro formulation and from the macroscopic scheme, where we show the asymptotic
preserving scheme property. Moreover, we demonstrate the effect of presence of the diffusion terms
in system (1.1), and its sensitivity with respect to the different choices of the reproduction ratio
R0 . Finally, particular attention is paid to the Moroccan situation against the actual pandemic.
2. From kinetic model to SEIRD reaction-diffusion system
This section aims to derive briefly SEIRD reaction-diffusion system (1.1) from kinetic model
using micro-macro decomposition method by following the line of paper [5]. We present the
properties of the aforesaid model. On the basis of the micro-macro decomposition technique, we
give an equivalent appropriate system.

where f1 (t, x, v), · · · , f4 (t, x, v) are the distribution functions describing the statistical evolution
of susceptible, exposed, infected and recovered individuals, respectively. t > 0, x ∈ Rd , v ∈ V
are respectively, time, position and velocity. The term Ti is the stochastic operator representing a
random modification of direction of individuals and the operator Gi (i = 1, . . . , 4) describing the
gain-loss balance of individuals. The mean free path ε measures the distance between individuals.
We mention that we adopt the parabolic-parabolic scaling limit, see for more details [5].
The micro-macro decomposition method is based on the following assumptions. The turning
operator Ti are given by

Ti (fi ) =
Ti∗ (v ∗ , v)fi (t, x, v ∗ ) − Ti (v, v ∗ )fi (t, x, v) dv ∗ ,

where Ti is the probability kernel for the new velocity v ∈ V given that the previous velocity was
v ∗ . We assume that the operators Ti satisfy
Z

Moreover, we assume that there exists a bounded velocity distribution Mi (v) > 0 for i = 1, . . . , 4
independent of t and x such that

2.2. Micro-macro formulation. This subsection is devoted to obtain an equivalent micro-macro
system of nonlocal kinetic-fluid model (2.1). The obtained equivalent system contains microscopic
and macroscopic components.
The main idea of the micro-macro method is to decompose the distribution function fi for i =
1, . . . , 4 as follows
fi (t, x, v) = Mi (v)ui (t, x) + εgi (t, x, v),
where
Z
ui (t, x) = hfi (t, x, v)i :=

fi (t, x, v) dv.
V

We have hgi i = 0 for i = 1, . . . , 4. Inserting fi in kinetic model (2.1) and using the above
assumptions and properties of the interaction and the turning operators, we get

∂t (Mi (v)ui ) + ε∂t gi + vMi (v) · ∇ui + v · ∇gi = Ti (gi ) + Gi (f1 , . . . , f4 ),
ε

(2.8)

The micro-macro decomposition method is based on two steps. First, we use the projection
technique to separate the macroscopic density ui (t, x) and microscopic quantity gi (t, x, v) for i =
1, . . . , 4. For that, we consider PMi the orthogonal projection onto N (Ti ), for i = 1, . . . , 4. It
follows

PMi (v) (h) = hhiMi (v), for any h ∈ L V,

Now, inserting the operators I − PMi into Eq. (2.8), and using known properties for the
projection PMi i = 1, · · · 4 yields the following micro-macro formulation

The following proposition shows that micro-macro formulation (2.9) is equivalent to nonlocal
kinetic-fluid equation (2.1).
Proposition 2.1. i) Let (f1 , . . . , f4 ) be a solution of kinetic model (2.1). Then
(u1 , . . . , un , g1 , . . . , g4 ) (where ui = hfi i and gi = 1ε (fi − Mi ui )) is a solution to coupled system
(2.9) associated with the following initial data for i = 1, . . . , 4

Mi ui + εgi ) is a solution to kinetic model (2.1) with initial data fi,0 = Mi ui,0 + εgi,0 and we have
ui = hfi i and hgi i = 0, for i = 1, . . . , 4.
ui (t = 0) = ui,0 = hfi,0 i,

gi (t = 0) = gi,0 =

Next, in order to develop asymptotic analysis of system (2.9), we assume that Gi satisfy the
following asymptotic behavior ε → 0

(2.11)
for i = 1, . . . , 4 . Now, we show that micro-macro formulation (2.9), which is equivalent to kinetic
equation (2.1), allows to obtain a general macroscopic model as ε goes to 0. Indeed, using (2.11)
and (2.9), we obtain for i = 1, . . . , 4
Ti (gi ) = vMi (v) · ∇ui + O(ε).

3. Numerical methods
In this section we develop an asymptotic preserving numerical schemes(AP) in one dimension.
In other words, the uniform stability with respect to the parameter ε and the consistency with the
reaction-diffusion limit. The discretization of problem (2.9)) is carried out with respect to each
independent variable (time, velocity and space).
3.1. Semi-implicit time discretization. In this first step, we present a time discretization of
our coupled system. We denote by ∆t a fixed time step, and by tk a discrete time such that
tk = k ∆t k ∈ N. The approximation of u1 (t, x) and gi (t, x, v) at the time step tk are denoted
respectively by uki ≈ ui (tk , x) and gik ≈ gi (tk , x, v).
In the first microscopic equation of (2.9), the only term which presents a stiffness in the collision
1
part, for small ε, is Ti (gi ). Hence, we take an implicit scheme to ensure the stability for this
ε
term, while the other terms are still explicit, then on has

4. Numerical simulations
In this section we provide some numerical simulations obtained from micro-macro formulation scheme
presented in Section 3 and from the finite difference scheme of system (1.1). Firstly, we show the asymptotic preserving scheme property, such as the uniform stability with respect to the parameter ε and the
consistence with the diffusion limit. Secondly, we demonstrate the effect of presence of the diffusion terms
in system (1.1), and its sensitivity with respect to the different choices of the reproduction ratio R0 . Finally, we attempt to model the COVID-19 pandemic in Morocco, where the data is available at [2] where
we demonstrate the importance in considering a time-dependent rate transmission.
For the numerical simulations, the velocity space is V = [−1, 1] with number of grids Nv = 164, which
can provide sufficient accuracy for numerical simulations (see, e.g., [14]) and the time step is t = 10−3 ,
and we consider the space domain x = [−2, 2] with number of cells Nx = 200 and the periodic boundary
condition. Moreover, we adopt a set of parameters as an example to analyse the results by varying some
of them: µ = 1/83, α = 0.06, ξ = 1/4, γ = 1/8 as in [13]. For the diffusion coefficients, two cases are
considered: i) case without diffusion and case of diffusion coefficients d1 = 0.05, d2 = 0.025, d3 = 0.001,
and d4 = 0, similarly to [36]. Finally, we use the following two different cases of initial conditions:

In Figure 2, we present the numerical results obtained of susceptible, exposed and infected individuals from the (AP)-scheme and from the reaction-diffusion scheme with initial conditions i) at successive
times t = 0.5, 1, 5, 10. We observe that the results obtained from the two schemes have almost the same
profiles in the limit when the parameter ε = 2 × 10−k , with k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 goes to zero. This confirms
that the asymptotic preserving scheme is uniformly stable along the transition from the kinetic regime to
the macroscopic regime. Furthermore, we see that the asymptotic-preserving scheme converges better in
time (see the zoomed windows). Figure 3 shows the snapshot of the obtained numerical solutions from
(AP)-scheme with ε = 10−6 of S (sub-figure (a)), E (sub-figure (b)), I (sub-figure (c)), R (sub-figure
(d)) at successive time t = 0, 7, 12, 30, 40, 60 and their spatial variation at x = 0 (sub-figure (e)), while
(sub-figure (f)) is for the population of died individuals for the reproduction ratio R0 = 2.
To demonstrate the diffusion effect on individuals interactions, we consider the initial conditions ii)
with the reproduction ratio value R0 = 2. Figure 4 provides the obtained results of susceptible, exposed
and infected individuals from the (AP)-scheme with ε = 10−6 in the case without diffusion (see sub-figures
(a)-(b)-(c)) and with diffusion (see sub-figures (d)-(e)-(f)). We observe that the individuals are all centred
around x = 0 in the absence of diffusion (di = 0). While when the diffusion is considered, it is clear that
the individuals are more spread along the x−axis.
To well demonstrate the sensitivity of the evolution of the individuals with respect to the transmission
rate, we consider different constants values β = 0.03, 0.075, 1.12, 0.1799, 0.7497, 2.2491 (the corresponding
reproduction ratio is R0 = 0.2, 0.5, 0.8, 1.2, 5, 15). In Figure 5, we show the time variation of susceptible,
exposed and infected individuals for different values of the transmission rate β with diffusion at x = 0
using the initial condition i). We notice that for small values of the transmission rate, the proportion
of the infected population is small. The steady-state ends up with a relatively small proportion of the
population in the compartment R, while the main proportion of the population remains in the susceptible
compartment S (did not catch the disease). However, for relatively higher and moderate values of β, an
important proportion of the population ends up (at the steady-state) in the compartment R (i.e. most of
the individuals of the population caught the disease and have been infected then they have recovered). In
this case, just a relatively small proportion of the population remains in the compartment S. We notice
also that the infected and exposed individuals vanish after a reasonable amount of time, while the susceptible and the recovered individuals reach a non zero constant steady-state value.
In Morocco, on August 01, 2020 the number of active cases was 25,015 cases and 367 deaths, but as of
January 17, 2021 this number increases so fast (458,865 infected and 7,911 deaths). It can be classified into
two phases, namely before and after Eid Aldha which was on July 31, 2020. In this religious celebration,
peoples used to spend it with their families and visited neighbours. So, many people traveling from city
to other ones. On the other hand, unfortunately people do not respect the authority’s orders, for instance
the partial lockdown in some cities, the obligation to wear a mask and social distance. This leads to
a high number of infected and deaths, see Figure 6. This situation can be modeled by considering a
time-dependent transmission rate β(t). We assume the following step-wise functions
β(t) = 0.0751[0,T /2] (t) + 1.49951]T /2,T ] (t),

(4.3)

β(t) = 0.0751[0,T /3] (t) + 1.49951]T /3,2T /3[ (t) + 0.051]2T /3,T ] (t),

(4.4)

where T = 50, and
where T = 100. It is very clear that the variation in the curves of the infected and deceased populations in
Figure 7 corresponds to the situation in Morocco described above. In Figure 8, we notice that the number

10

MOHAMED ZAGOUR

of infected and deceased populations decreases, while the number of people recovered increases at time
T > 50. This happened thanks to the choice of the transmission rate function β(t) given by Eq. (4.4) where
we take a small value of R0 = 0.2 < 1. Then, we believe that the partial lockdown in Moroccan applied
from December 24, 2020 and the national vaccination campaign against COVID-19 in the upcoming weeks
stated from the Royal Office announced November 9, 2020 will gradually eliminate the virus over the next
few months.

5. Conclusion and perspectives
In this paper, a time-independent SEIRD reaction-diffusion system for individual populations has
been proposed. This system has been derived from kinetic model (2.9) by using the micro-macro decomposition method. It has been shown that the proposed (AP)-scheme is uniformly stable along the
transition from kinetic to macroscopic regimes. Various promising numerical simulations have been provided. Specifically, it has shown that the presence of the diffusion terms in system (1.1) influences the
spreading of the pandemic. On the other hand, the sensitivity to the transmission rate is demonstrated.
Indeed, for small values of the transmission rate β, the proportion of the infected population is small, and
the steady-state ends up with a relatively small proportion of the population in the compartment R, while
the main proportion of the population remains in the susceptible compartment S. While, for relatively
moderate and higher values of β, an important proportion of the population ends up at the steady-state in
the compartment R, and the infected and exposed individuals vanish after a reasonable amount of time,
while the susceptible and the recovered individuals reach a non zero constant steady-state value. Finally,
the importance in considering a time-dependent rate transmission has been demonstrated. The obtained
numerical results describe the Moroccan actual situation where the go back to partial lockdown decreases
the high numbers of the infected cases and deaths. However, the vaccination campaign, which will be
implemented soon, will gradually eliminate the virus over the next few months. We believe that this paper
opens such interesting perspectives: Numerical study of the proposed system for the real empirical data,
extension of the macroscopic model by considering a time-space diffusions di (t, x) and the rate transmission β(t, x). Moreover, we think that it is interesting to apply the presented method in this paper to other
applications, for instance mechanism of normal and infected cells. An interesting macroscopic models can
be found in the papers by [9, 38].
