Abstract
Repeated history of pandemics, such as SARS, H1N1, Ebola, Zika, and COVID-19, has shown that
pandemic risk is inevitable. Extraordinary shortages of medical resources have been observed in many
parts of the world. Some attributing factors include the lack of sufficient stockpiles and the lack of
coordinated efforts to deploy existing resources to the location of greatest needs.
The paper investigates contingency planning and resources allocation from a risk management perspective, as opposed to the prevailing supply chain perspective. The key idea is that the competition
of limited critical resources is not only present in different geographical locations but also at different
stages of a pandemic. This paper draws on an analogy between risk aggregation and capital allocation in
finance and pandemic resources planning and allocation for healthcare systems. The main contribution is
to introduce new strategies for optimal stockpiling and allocation balancing spatio-temporal competitions
of medical supply and demand.

Introduction
Lessons from Recent Pandemics
An epidemic is an outbreak of a disease that spreads rapidly to a cohort of individuals in a wide area.
According to the definition of the World Health Organization (WHO), “a pandemic is the worldwide spread
of a new disease.” Because human has little immunity to the new disease, a pandemic can emerge quickly
around the world. One of the most disastrous pandemics in the recent history is the 1918 flu pandemic which
infected around 500 million and resulted in the deaths of estimated 50 million people worldwide, more than
those died from the World War I. Most recently, the novel coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) is an
infectious disease caused by a new virus that only emerged in late 2019 and has since spread out to nearly
every country in the world. According to Cutler and Summers, the COVID-19 could cause financial losses
that sum up to $16 trillion, or roughly 90% of the annual GDP in the United States (Cutler and Summers,
2020). However, its far-reaching impact and consequent economic fallout due to the loss of productivity is

yet to be realized; as of November 28, 2020, the number of infected cases has accumulated to over 61 million
worldwide with the death toll reaching over 1.4 million (see, for example, The Atlantic (2020)).
The repeated history of pandemics in recent decades, such as SARS, swine flu, Ebola, and the most recent
COVID-19, has taught us that pandemic risk is inevitable. Recent research studies (see, for instance, K. E.
Jones et al. (2008) and Morse (1995)) have shown that the frequency of pandemics has increased over the past
century due to increased social connectivity, long-distance travel, urbanization, changes in land use, trade and
consumption of wild animals, and greater exploitation of the natural environment. Figure 1 visualizes both
frequency and severity of well-recognized pandemics and public health emergencies of international concern
declared by the WHO since 1900s. The vertical axis represents the number of documented infections on a
logarithmic scale. Both the size and the color scale of the circles indicate the number of deaths resulting
from the pandemics and public health emergencies. The alarming pattern of increased frequency clearly
points to the critical importance of pandemic risk management.

Governments around the world have been taking blames for their failure to promptly implement appropriate policies to contain the pandemic. Many countries experienced severe shortages of resources. Ranney,
Griffeth, and Jha (2020) studied the critical role of scarce resources, such as ventilators and personal protective equipment (PPE), in shaping the direction of COVID-19. Such an unprecedented challenge exposes the
inadequacy in contingency planning and resources allocation strategies of public health systems. The lack
of planning drives policymakers to make impromptu decisions on resources acquisitions and allocations that
may have exacerbated the extraordinary shortage.
The United States boasts one of the best healthcare systems with a large network of healthcare professionals, best-equipped medical facilities and hospitals, and most advanced medical technology. Yet, the country
is under-prepared for the COVID-19 pandemic. There were severe shortages of diagnostic and preventative
medical supplies both for healthcare providers and the general public in many states in the early stage of
the pandemic, which made it difficult for public authorities to contain the pandemic. According to a recent
report by President Obama’s former advisors on science and technology (Holdren et al., 2020), there are
several contributing factors to the lack of medical resources: (1) National reserves of critical medical supplies
were not replenished sufficiently prior to COVID-19. Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) was established by
2

the government in 2003 as the national repository of pharmaceutical and vaccination stockpiles. The SNS
relies on the appropriation of funding from the Congress. Much of the mask stockpile was depleted during
the 2009 H1N1 pandemic and the Congress has not acted quickly to provide the funding to replenish the
stockpile to an appropriate level projected by many studies. (2) In order to minimize inventory cost and
improve efficiency, many manufacturers and supply chain management of medical supplies have shifted to
just-in-time (JIT) inventory system prior to the pandemic. Goods are only received just in time for production and distribution. The JIT system relies the ability of manufacturers to accurately predict the demand.
The initial public policies such as lock-downs caused major disruptions to supply chains around the world
and there were not sufficient inventories to absorb surge demand. (3) There was a lack of sufficient coordination among federal and state governments to deploy existing resources to the most devastated areas in the
country. Healthcare professionals are put at high risk to treat patients without sufficient personal protective
equipment. It was difficult to uncover and contain the spread of disease without adequate testing. Several
states in the United States acted on their own to secure supplies from foreign manufactures and engaged in
a price bidding war for limited supplies (Estes, 2020). Existing resources are not necessarily distributed on
a basis of health need (Tobin-Tyler, 2020). Many hardest hit states have to ration care, while other states
have low utilization of their resources.
While there are policy related issues that require policymakers’ actions, academics can contribute to
the understanding of pandemic evolution and the resulting dynamics of demand and supply. There is a
clear need for the development of scientific foundation for adaptive strategies for balancing demand and
supply and rationing limited resources. Contingency planning and resources allocation in a centralized
form have been advocated as two coherent strategies to mitigate catastrophic economic consequences from
a pandemic; see for example Jamison et al. (2017). Ranney, Griffeth, and Jha (2020) argued that the
government should have tracked the use of resources and the projection of needs in all subsidiaries, and
should have coordinated allocation of resources to reduce shortage across subsidiaries and over time in the
course of a pandemic. A comparable example of centralized planning is the Federal Emergency Management
Agency, which administers many pre-disaster risk mitigation programs, such as national flood insurance,
mitigation grants, and post-disaster response plans including search and rescue team, medical assistance
teams, monetary reliefs, etc; see Vanajakumari, Kumar, and Gupta (2016) and Stauffer and Kumar (2020)
for information.
Centralized planning and resources allocation have long been practiced as risk management strategies in
the financial industry. For example, banks and insurers are heavily regulated by governments to ensure their
capabilities to absorb severe financial losses and endure adverse economic scenarios (Segal, 2011). The central
hypothesis of this paper is that many risk aggregation and capital allocation techniques drawn from financial
and insurance literature can be extended and applied to pandemic resources planning and allocation.

Case Study
Figure 2 depicts the daily confirmed COVID-19 cases in the State of New York (NY), Florida (FL), and
California (CA) in 2020. One could observe that, among these three states, NY was first hit the hardest
by the pandemic in April, while both FL and CA experienced a peak of cases around July and August;
moreover, although both NY and FL showed comparatively fewer cases in May and June, CA was savaged
by the COVID-19 around that time.
Let us take a thought experiment for the moment. Imagine that these three states established resource
pooling alliance prior to the pandemic. They could have complemented each other by delivering one state’s

surplus resources to aid another in deficit. For example, in April, the alliance could have coordinated the
efforts to send initial stockpile and increase emergency production to support the NY; in May and June,
remaining resources, together with additional production, should have been redirected from both NY and FL
to CA; by July and August, when both FL and CA were hit the hardest, unused resources in the NY could
be made available to both FL and CA. Such a coalition is not unimaginable even in a decentralized political
system like the United States. In April 2020, six northwestern states including New York, Connecticut, New
Jersey, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, and Delaware, formed a government procurement coalition for critical
medical equipment in an effort to avoid a bidding war (Holveck, Racioppi, and Shanes, 2020).
The purpose of this paper is to propose an overarching framework for different regions to optimize stockpiling and resources allocation at different pandemic stages in order to best utilize limited resources. While
we use inter-state resources pooling as an illustrative example, applications can also include international
collaboration on the production, procurement, distribution and pooling of critical medical resources such as
masks, ventilators, pharmaceuticals, vaccines, etc.

Pandemic Risk Management Framework and Contribution
A vast amount of recent literature on COVID-19 focus on the prediction of transmission dynamics (e.g.
Fernández-Villaverde and C. I. Jones (2020) and Hortaçsu, Liu, and Schwieg (2020)), infected cases (e.g.
Giordano et al. (2020)), economic impact (e.g. Acemoglu et al. (2020) and Gregory, Menzio, and Wiczer
(2020)), and the effect of non-pharmaceutical intervention and other public policies (e.g. Charpentier et al.
(2020)). However, to the best of our knowledge, academic research on quantitative framework for contingency
planning and resources allocation in response to pandemic risk are rare. While the banking and insurance
industries have long had a rich tradition of developing technologies for robust risk management, the focus
has been largely on financial and insurable risks. This paper aims to take advantage of the vast medical
literature on epidemic modeling and apply classic concepts from risk management and insurance literature
such as reserving and capital allocation to pandemic risk management.
A strategic pandemic planning requires scientific assessment, rather than on-the-fly ad-hoc decisions and
patchworks for damage control. In accordance with current practices of national pandemic preparedness and
control strategies around the world, we summarize and propose a three-pillar framework for quantitative

pandemic risk management:
Pillar I: Regional and Aggregate Resources Supply and Demand Forecast. Any pre-pandemic preparation plan should consist of supply and demand assessment and forecast. The supply side should
include inventory assessments of critical resources and supplies, the maximum capacity of services, the
capability of emergency acquisition and production. The demand side requires an understanding of
the dynamics of a potential pandemic across regions and across borders. Historical data and predictive
models can be used to project the evolution of a pandemic and the resulting surge demand around a
healthcare system.
Pillar II: Centralized Stockpiling and Distribution. A central authority coordinates the efforts to develop
a national preparedness strategy and to set up reserves of critical resources including preventative,
diagnostic and therapeutic resources. A response plan is also necessary to understand how the central
authority can deliver resources to different region quickly to meet surge demands and to balance
competing interests and priorities.
Pillar III: Central-Regional Resources Allocation. A pandemic response plan is critical for a central
authority to contain and control the spread of a pandemic in regions under its jurisdiction. As demand
may exceed any best-effort pre-pandemic projection, the authority needs to devise optimal strategies
that best utilize limited existing resources and minimize the economic cost of supply-demand imbalance. A coordination strategy needs to be in place to ensure smooth communications with regional
5

authorities. The allocation strategy should be based scientifically sound methods taking into account
spatio-temporal differences across regions to ensure fairness and impartiality.
It should be pointed out that, while the first pillar is not the focus of this paper, it plays a critical
role in ensuring the adequacy and effectiveness of planning and responses in second and third pillars. The
proposed framework applies regardless of predictive models for projecting reported cases. The main technical
contribution of this paper lies in second and third pillars for which we propose centralized resources stockpiling,
distribution, and allocation strategies.

Table 1: Comparison between capital and pandemic risk managements

The paper draws inspirations from two sources in insurance and risk management literature. (1) Insurance
applications of epidemic models. Early applications of epidemic compartment models appeared in Hua and
Cox (2009), in which real option pricing is used for operational risk management, and Feng and Garrido
(2011), which analyzed epidemic insurance coverage. The study of epidemic insurance was extensively
developed in stochastic setting in Lefèvre, Picard, and Simon (2017), Lefèvre and Picard (2018), and Lefèvre
and Simon (2020), and more recently to cyber risk assessment by Hillairet and Lopez (2020). All of these
compartmental models can be used in Pillar I. (2) Capital allocation. The subject of capital management
is well-studied in the insurance literature. The applications of reserving and capital allocation form the
basis of the proposed Pillars II and III. Table 1 reveals how our proposed framework shadows the classical
capital management. While spatial balancing of allocation is well-known in banking and insurance (see, for
instance, Dhaene et al. (2012), and Chong, Feng, and Jin (2020)), this paper develops a novel spatio-temporal
balancing of resources distribution and allocation, which, to the best of our knowledge, was not previously
studied in either financial or management literature.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Each of the next three section provides detailed discussion
of one of the three pillars in the proposed pandemic risk management framework as well as economic interpretations of resulting optimal strategies. Numerical examples are embedded in the discussion for better
readership. We conclude in the last section with discussions of potential applications and future work.

Pillar I: Regional and Aggregate Resources Demand Forecast
In the pre-pandemic time, a central authority should first model the pandemic transmission dynamics in
each region. Regardless of the choice of epidemiological models, the central authority should calibrate the
model in each region by its preparedness and other contingency measurements. Indeed, epidemic forecast
models have been used for healthcare policy making and public communications; see, for example, Leung
et al. (2020) and Tian et al. (2020). In this paper, in line with Covid Act Now (2020) and Hill et al. (2020),
the population in each region is divided into seven mutually exclusive compartments, namely, the susceptible
(S), the exposed (E), the mild infected (I1 ), the infected with hospitalization (I2 ), the infected with intensive

6

care (I3 ), the recovered (R), and the deceased (D). The dynamics, among these seven compartments, are
governed by a set of ordinary differential equations, and the model is, in short, called the SEIRD.
This SEIRD model is characterized by a set of ordinary differential equations that describe population
flows among all aforementioned compartments:
dS(t) = −(β1 I1 (t) + β2 I2 (t) + β3 I3 (t))S(t) dt,
dE(t) = [(β1 I1 (t) + β2 I2 (t) + β3 I3 (t))S(t) − γE(t)] dt,
dI1 (t) = [γE(t) − (δ1 + p1 )I1 (t)] dt,
dI2 (t) = [p1 I1 (t) − (δ2 + p2 )]I2 (t)] dt,
dI3 (t) = [p2 I2 (t) − (δ3 + µ)I3 (t)] dt,
dR(t) = [δ1 I1 (t) + δ2 I2 (t) + δ3 I3 (t)] dt,
dD(t) = µI3 (t) dt.
All parameters in the set of equations bear clinical meanings; βi , i = 1, 2, 3, is the transmission rate of the
infected class Ii ; 1/γ is the average latency period; 1/δi , i = 1, 2, 3, is the average duration of infection in
the class Ii before recovery to the class R; pi , i = 1, 2, 3, represents the rate at which conditions worsen and
individuals require healthcare at the next level of severity; µ is the rate for most severe cases in the class I3
to the deceased class D. Suppose that the total number of individuals in the entire popluation is N. Each
of the ordinary differential equation represents a decomposition of instantaneous change in the population
of a compartment. For example, the first equation shows that the instantaneous rate of reduction in the
number of susceptible, − dS(t) matches the sum of the rates of infection due to contacts with the infected
of all classes, β1 I1 (t)S(t) + β2 I2 (t)S(t) + β3 I3 (t)S(t). The products are due to the law of mass action in
biology. For example, the rate of secondary infection by the mildly infected, (β1 N )I1 (t)(S(t)/N ) can be
interpreted as the number of adequate contact each infected makes to transmit the disease β1 N multiplied
by the number of infected I1 (t), multiplied by the percentage that each contact is made with a susceptible,
S(t)/N. All other equations can be explained in similar ways. The estimation of these model parameters
are well-studied in the literature for the COVID-19 as well as other pandemics, such as Wu and McGoogan
(2020), P. Yang et al. (2020), and X. Yang et al. (2020). Based on these parameters, the basic reproductive
ratio R0 of a pandemic is given by:
R0 =

N
p1 + δ1


β1 +

p1
p2 + δ2


β2 + β3

p2
µ + δ3


.

The basic reproductive ratio R0 can be estimated by empirical data and is often used to calibrate other
parameters. In what follows, we shall use discretized version of the compartmental model. For example,
we use the notation I1,j = I1 (j∆t) to indicate the number of mild cases projected on the j-th period each
with the length ∆t. We sometimes omit the information on ∆t as the time unit may vary depending on the
reporting period.
Based on predictive models such as the above-mentioned regional SEIRD models, a central authority
could predict, prior to a pandemic or at the onset of a pandemic, changes in demand over the course of the
pandemic. Resources require different stockpiling and allocation strategies, depending on their shelf lives.
In this paper, we consider two types of medical resources, namely durable and single-use. Durable resources
refer to those that can perform their required functions for a lengthy period of time without significant

7

expenditures of maintenance or repair. Single-use resources are those that are designed to be used once
and then disposed of. Mechanical ventilators and PPE are used as representative examples of durable and
single-use resources respectively in this paper.

Table 2: Percentage of severe ICU infected cases requiring ventilators
Durable Resource: Ventilator
Based on the findings in medical literature (references within Table 2), there are estimates of the percentage α of the infected with intensive care that require the use of mechanical ventilators. These regional
differences can be addressed in separate regional compartment models. We can use these estimates to project
VEN(i)

the ventilator demand by Xj

(i)

= αI3,j , where i indicates the i-th region in the alliance and j indicates

the j-th day of the pandemic. The model can also be extended to include time-varying percentage of severe
patients requiring ventilators. The calculations in the rest of the paper would carry through. Figure 4(a)
shows the projected ventilator demands in New York, Florida and California based on the SEIRD model
proposed by Covid Act Now (2020), which is calibrated to publicly available reported cases as of September
12, 2020, and demand assessment parameters in Appendix B.
Single-Use Resource: Personal Protective Equipment
The assessment of need for PPE sets varies by the patients’ class and severity of medical conditions
in care, and the function of medical professionals. Table 3 offers an example of such need assessment by
European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (2020). Given these estimates, we can project the
PPE(i)

regional PPE set demand by Xj

(i)

(i)

(i)

(i)

= θE (Sj−1 − Sj ) + θI2 I2,j + θI3 I3,j , where θE is the number of PPE

sets per exposed case, θI2 is the number of PPE sets per day per hospitalized patient, and θI3 is the number
of PPE sets per day per intensive care patient. Note that Sj−1 − Sj represents the daily exposed cases
whereas I2,j and I3,j keeps track of existing infected cases that require medical attention. Figure 4(b) shows
how ventilator and PPE demands are projected to evolve over time for New York, Florida, and California,
based on the model by Covid Act Now (2020) and the PPE need assessment in Appendix B.
In the first pillar, the central authority is expected to work with regional authorities and healthcare
professionals to predict the dynamics of regional demands. All regional data are then compiled and aggregated to form the basis of forecast for the system-wide resource demand. Suppose that there are a total
of n regions in a healthcare system or medical resource alliance. For example, the aggregate ventilator dePn
VEN(i)
mand can be determined by XjVEN = i=1 Xj
, while the aggregate PPE set demand may be given by
P

Xj
= i=1 Xj
. Figure 5 shows how the aggregate ventilator and PPE demand prediction for the
COVID-19 pandemic could have been made in the hypothetical example of a three-state resources pooling
alliance. Observe that projections for ventilators and PPE sets show very similar patterns as both were
driven by the same SEIRD model. The peaks in demand for ventilator are delayed compared with those

It should be pointed out that predictive models in Pillar I, such as the SEIRD model introduced in this
section, are used for multiple purposes as shown in Figure 3. First, they need to be developed prior to a
pandemic using historical data and to form the basis of demand forecast for contingency planning in Pillar
II. Then, as a pandemic starts to emerge, the predictive models also need to be re-calibrated and updated
with latest medical knowledge and reported cases. New forecasts would then be fed into models to determine
optimal allocation strategies in Pillar III. As medical knowledge of the viral disease evolves and predictive
models improve over time, Pillars I and III may be revisited from period to period. When a distribution
schedule of resources requires an update, we can go back to Pillar II. Therefore, the three-pillar framework
may be utilized in circles such as Pillars I, II, III, I, III, I, III, I, II, III, etc.

Pillar II: Centralized Stockpiling and Distribution
As the pandemic unfolds, many hospitals and healthcare facilities may run out of pharmaceuticals and other
essential resources before emergency production can pick up and additional supplies become available. To
meet the surge demand at the onset of a pandemic, many countries maintain national repositories of antibiotics, vaccines, chemical antidotes, antitoxins, and other critical medical supplies. A centralized stockpiling
strategy is intended to provide a stopgap measure to meet the surge in resources demand at the early stage of
the pandemic. There has been well-established literature on stockpiling strategies for influenza pandemics;
see, for example, Greer and Schanzer (2013) and Siddiqui and Edmunds (2008).
One should keep in mind that a practical stockpiling strategy is often an act of balance between adequate
supply and economic cost. On one hand, under-stocking is a common issue as resources and their storage can
post heavy cost, and the actual demand during the pandemic outbreak could deviate from the projection;
for example, Ellison (2020) claimed that as many as 20 states in the United States are expected to encounter
shortage in ICU beds when the COVID-19 cases peak. On the other hand, excessive stockpiling for long
term could lead to unnecessary waste, especially for disposable and perishable resources; for instance, Facher
(2020) reported that, in March 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Strategic National Stockpile in
the United States stocked 13 million N95 masks, of which as many as 5 million may have expired, partly
contributing to the nation-wide shortage of masks.
In the second pillar of our proposed framework, based on the estimated aggregate resources demand,
the central authority could then develop stockpiling and distribution strategies in regular time before a
pandemic. Notice that durable resources such as ventilators can be reused throughout the pandemic, while
single-use resources such as PPE sets must be disposed of after one-time usage. Hence, we have to treat
them separately for optimal centralized stockpiling and distribution strategies.

Durable Resource: Ventilator
It is typical that a central authority has to determine an optimal initial stockpile size K0 of resources to
maintain in some centralized location. In addition, to meet surge demand, the authority may need to
reach contractual agreements with suppliers for emergency orders, which may be limited by the maximum
production rate of a units per day during a pandemic. Since ventilators are durable, the stock of ventilators
does not decrease over time due to usage. We assume that they can be deployed to different regions at
negligible cost. Therefore, the total number of available ventilators in the entire alliance is given by Kj =
K0 + aj, on the j-th day since the onset of the pandemic. Hence, the only decision variable of the central
authority in the case of ventilators is the initial stockpile size K0 .

Figure 6: Two extreme scenarios of initial stockpile size K0 for ventilators
To better explain the need for an optimal initial stockpile size K0 , consider two extreme cases in Figures
6a and 6b for the three-state alliance. On one end of the extreme, the central authority may decide not to
hold any initial stockpile but simply rely on the maximum emergency production limit during the pandemic;
Figure 6a shows a clear extreme shortage at the first peak time of aggregate ventilator demand. On the
other end, suppose that the central authority decides to hold an extraordinary amount of initial stockpile for
ventilators to meet the highest peak of aggregate ventilator demand; Figure 6b illustrates a clear extreme
oversupply of ventilators during most of the time of pandemic; also, in this case, the economic cost of severe
storage can be huge. Therefore, the central authority has to take a delicate balance on an initial stockpile
size K0 that takes into account the economic cost of shortage, oversupply, as well as storage costs.
Consider the following optimization model for an initial stockpiling size.

where m is the number of days of the pandemic, ωj is a weight for significance of precision for the costs on
the j-th day of the pandemic, θj+ is an economic cost per squared unit of shortage, θj− is an opportunity
cost per squared unit of oversupply, cj is the aggregate cost of possession per unit of ventilators per day,
c0 is the initial stockpile cost, which may include both the acquisition cost and expected cost of possession
(storage, maintenance, inventory logistics, opportunity cost). The quadratic form can be interpreted as
follows. While one copy of the quantity XjVEN − (K0 + aj) represents the amount of resource imbalance
(shortage or surplus), the other copy (θj± /2)[XjVEN − (K0 + aj)]± can be viewed as the (linear) variable
cost of the imbalance. In other words, the larger the imbalance, the higher the price to pay. The quadratic
form is the product of cost per unit and the unit of imbalance, which yields the overall economic cost of
imbalance. The weight wj can be used for different purposes. For example, it may be reasonable to assume
that the precision of meeting demands in near future is more important than that in the far-future given the
uncertainty with prediction. Another case may be to make the weight proportional to the daily demand Xj
as the demand-supply imbalance can have a greater impact on population dense areas than otherwise.
To understand the analytical solution to this problem, we need to look at the projected shortage without

Figure 7: Optimal initial stockpile K0 relative to projected shortages without initial stockpile
any initial stockpile, Yj := XjVEN − aj, for j = 1, · · · , m, which is the accumulated demand less the accumulated supply apart from the initial stockpile. Note that we consider the accumulated supply because the
resources are durable and can be reused. When Yj > 0, there is a drain on the initial stockpile as current
demand exceeds the accumulated supply. Otherwise, the stockpile increases as supply exceeds demand.
Because the economic costs of shortage and surplus are weighed differently, the value of this objective function depends on the number of days with decreasing stockpile (Yj > 0) and those with increasing stockpile
(Yj < 0). The analytical solution to this problem requires sorting projected shortages in an ascending order.
Let us denote the sorted sequence by {Y[j] , j = 1, · · · , m}, where Y[j] represents the j-th smallest projected
shortage. In the objective function (1), the cost coefficient θj± applies according to whether or not stockpile
exceeds demand. If K0 is placed below Y[j] , there is a shortage in the healthcare system and hence the cost
coefficient θ+ is applied. Otherwise, there is a surplus in the system and the cost efficient θ− is applied.
The optimality is achieved when K0 is kept at a delicate position. See Figure 7. The nature of the sum of
squared shortages in (1) determines that the optimal initial stockpile K0∗ should be squeezed between Y[J−1]
and YJ in such a way that

The proof of this result can be found in Appendix A.1. This result shows that the optimal initial stockpile
K0 is the weighted average of all projected shortages discounted by the cost of possession relative to the

economic cost of shortage, Y[j] − c[j] /θ[j]
. The adjustment term c[j] /θ[j]
indicates that, the higher cost of

possession relative to economic cost of imbalance, the fewer ventilators should be acquired. It is logical that,
if the cost of possession for durable resource is too high, the central authority in a poor country may have
little financial means to pay for stockpiling and be left with no choice but to deal with the demand-supply
imbalance. In contrast, if the economic cost of imbalance is too high due to lost productivity or even the
society’s resentment on government’s failure to meet demand, then the central authority would ignore the

Figure 8: Optimal initial stockpile size K0 for ventilators according to different weights of economic cost
Figure 8 depicts optimal initial stockpile size in the case study. The model parameters are provided in
Appendix B. Observe that optimal initial stockpiles are chosen to reduce shortage in the early stages and
oversupply in the late stages of the pandemic, compared with those strategies shown in Figure 6. When the
resource shortage costs the same or less than the resource surplus, Figure 8a shows that the strategy requires
less initial stockpile due to the excessive amount of supply after the pandemic dies down. In contrast, if the
shortage weighs more than the surplus, the strategy is to reduce shortage in early stages at the expense of
increasing oversupply in late stages; see Figure 8b.

Single-Use Resource: Personal Protective Equipment
Similar to the case of durable resources, the central authority needs to set up an initial stockpile size K0
of single-use resources such as PPE and make contractual agreements with emergency suppliers, which can
provide additional supply at the production rate a units per day. Since PPE is of single-use, during the
pandemic, the central authority has to stockpile PPE sets not only for the present but also to potentially
deploy them for later time in order to meet surge demand. Therefore, the central authority needs to
plan for both initial stockpile size K0 and the amount of distribution kj to all regions on day j. The
dynamics of the centralized storage {Kj , j = 0, 1, . . . , m} is determined by the recursive relation Kj =
Kj−1 + a − kj + (kj − Xj )+ for j = 1, . . . , m. The relation can be interpreted as follows. The current
stockpile Kj is based off the previous period’s stockpile Kj−1 , increased by the net surplus of new supply
a less the arranged distribution up to the total demand, max{kj , Xj }. In other words, if we arrange to
distribute kj units but can only consume Xj < kj , then the unused amount should count towards the
centralized storage for future use.

equipment for the three-state resource pooling alliance
Consider two extreme cases in Figures 9a and 9b in the case study. In an extreme case, assume that
the central authority decides to distribute as much as possible to meet the demand until the centralized
storage is exhausted. This aggressive early distribution strategy is depicted in Figure 9a. After the storage
depletion, the system relies only on the new supply, which clearly is not sufficient to meet demands and can
cause severe shortage at the time of second peak. In the other extreme, the central authority may choose
to hold off dispersing any equipment at all till the point that the storage is believed to be sufficient to cover
all future demands. Such a conservative distribution strategy is illustrated in Figure 9b. The challenge with
this strategy is that the central authority would have to deal with the repercussion of not providing any
assistance in the early stage of the pandemic. Therefore, it is sensible that the central authority develop a
distribution schedule that takes a temporal balance of varying needs from all regions. Here we introduce the
optimization problem for both an initial stockpile and the distribution schedule of single-use resources.

for j = 1, 2, . . . , m,

where cj is the centralized cost of possession per unit of PPE per day. It should be pointed out that the
centralized storage should be kept non-negative for practical purposes and the distribution amount should
also be kept non-negative. Negative distribution could mean confiscation of regional resources for system
wide re-distribution, which is not considered in this paper.
Figure 10 depicts the case of optimal distribution schedule for the three-state alliance. Observe that
the optimal supply distribution schedule stays below the trajectory of demand. The slight shortage results
from the consideration of the cost of possession. Should the cost of possession be zero, the optimal supply
would be to match the demand exactly at all times. The initial stockpile can be set artificially high so that
any desired amount can be carried over from period to period and last long enough to support all future
demands. In the presence of possession cost, Figure 10 also reveals a distribution strategy that in essence
ignores the demands at the start of a pandemic and after the pandemic dies down and instead focuses on
meeting demands at the first peak of the pandemic. Keep in mind that the weight of significance ωj in
this example is set to be proportional to the size of demand. Therefore, the strategy prioritizes meeting the
demand in the first peak over other periods due to its high demand. If we were to choose the same weight
ωj for all periods, the shortage would be more balanced among all periods.
This optimization problem is cumbersome to be solved analytically. However, it is straightforward to
show that any oversupply distribution scheme kj > XjPPE must be sub-optimal, and hence the problem can
be simplified as follows.

Because of the convexity, it can be solved numerically using Disciplined Convex Programming (DCP), which
requires minimal computational time (Grant, Boyd, and Ye, 2006). The solution shown in Figure 10 is
obtained with the help of an R package CVXR developed based on the DCP method (Fu, Narasimhan, and
Boyd, 2020).

Pillar III: Centralized Resources Allocation
In the time of severe resources shortage, a coordinated effort becomes necessary to obtain additional supplies
and to ration limited existing resources. Existing resources are not necessarily distributed on a basis of
health need or justice (Tobin-Tyler, 2020). Many hardest hit states have to ration care, while other states
have low utilization of their resources. As alluded to earlier, not all regions experienced surge in demands
at the same time (see Figure 2), it has been long argued that United States federal government should have
tracked the current use and the projection of needs in all states and coordinated allocation of resources to
reduce shortage across regions and over time, during the COVID-19 pandemic (Ranney, Griffeth, and Jha,
2020).
There are two common types of resources allocation problems in the course of a pandemic, both of which
can be formulated and cast in the Pillar III of our proposed framework.
1. Macro level resources pooling. A central authority acts in the best interest of a union of many regions
15

to increase supply as well as to coordinate the distribution of existing and additional resources among
different regional healthcare providers.
2. Micro level rationing. Facing an imbalance of demands and supplies in medical equipment and resources, hospitals often have to make difficult but necessary decisions to ration limited existing resources
as well as new supplies.
While in both cases the aim of allocation is to deliver limited resources to where they are needed the most,
the macro level pooling large addresses spatio-temporal differences and the micro level rationing focuses on
healthcare effectiveness and justice. The setting of standards, protocols and policies can have profound
impact on the functioning of a healthcare system at the time of crisis. Therefore, the best practice of
resources allocation should be based on scientific assessment and evaluation rather than on-the-fly ad-hoc
decisions and a patchwork of damage-control rules.
1. Resources allocation should be based on a holistic approach to address concerns of all stakeholders.
There are often conflicting interests and priorities for using limited resources. For example, when
medical supplies are scarce, many countries, states and cities are competing for resources. While
each state acts in its best interest to acquire medical devises and protective equipment, a federal
government may see the urgent need to seize control of the cargo to boost a centralized stockpile. A
holistic approach aims to strike a balance among different objectives for various stakeholders.
2. Scientific methods for resources allocation should be developed under a set of optimization objectives,
meet certain ethical and humanitarian criteria, take into account logistic and budgetary constraints.
When a pandemic breaks out, it often spreads from one cluster to another in geographic areas due to its
transmission dynamics and affects different sectors of a healthcare system in a chain reaction. Medical
needs can vary greatly by demographics and other socio-economics factors. While there is no universal
“one-size-fits-all” solution for allocation problems, there are a set of quantifiable and justifiable criteria.
While it is difficult address all of these criteria in a single model, we believe that they can be formulated
similarly as in this section.
• Minimization of shortage and oversupply
Decision makers need to take into account spatio-temporal differences in demand and supply over
the course of a pandemic. It is imperative for authorities to allocate more resources to epicenters
of a pandemic than other regions under less imminent threat. For example, New York City was the
first in the State of New York to witness the COVID-19 pandemic, when other counties had little
to no reported cases (Associated Press, 2020). The State governor issued an executive order to
take ventilators and other protective gears from underutilized private hospitals and companies. As
infected cases stabilize or even decline in pandemic-savaged regions, a central authority may need
to shift its attention to other areas of potential outbreaks and allocate resources in anticipation of
new waves. This was also evident when many states in the United States in early stages of outbreak
during the COVID-19 took preemptive measures to procure medical supplies from countries like
China and South Korea which have developed production capacities after the local epidemics are
under control. Therefore, it is sensible to develop an allocation strategy that minimizes shortage
and oversupply across different regions and over the life-cycle of a pandemic.

16

• Promoting and rewarding instrumental value
Critical preventive gears and medical care should be provided first to healthcare workers in the
front line, employees in essential businesses and critical infrastructures. Not only because they are
at high risk due to their exposure to infectious disease, but also the society bears heavy economic
cost when these workers fall ill and are unable to return to work. The lack of sufficient front-line
workforce may cause severe disruptions to public services, which can have rippling effect on the
rest of the economy. Priority access to medical care can be a critical incentive for retention.
• Prioritizing the worst off
The ultimate goal of a healthcare system is to save lives. Access to critical medicare treatment
should be reserved for patients facing life-threatening conditions, when there is an insufficient
supply of equipment such as ventilators.
• Maximization of benefit from treatment
Maximization of the benefit requires prognosis on how patients are likely to survive with treatment.
Some recent study of COVID-19 patients in the United States finds that most patients do not
survive after being placed on mechanical ventilators (Preidt, 2020). To maximize the benefit,
access to ventilator treatment should be prioritized for younger patients who can benefit the most
and have the higher chance of survival. For example, many hospitals in Italy lowered the age
cutoff from 80 to 75 in order to ration limited ventilators (Rosenbaum, 2020). Such a strategy
often leads to ethical dilemma when in conflict with prioritizing the worst off.
The third pillar of the proposed pandemic risk management framework is to allocate limited resources
for different regions, building on the proposed optimal centralized stockpiling and distribution strategies.

i-th region. Bear in mind that there could still be aggregate shortage of supply for ventilators and PPE sets
to all regions in the alliance. The central authority would have to take a holistic view of competing interests
of participating regions. On each day in the pandemic, when the aggregate demand exceeds the aggregate
supply, the central authority should choose to allocate resources taking into account spatial differences in
demand and supply. This motivates the optimization model for ventilator allocations:

and the total unit of imbalance Xj − Kj . The economic cost is used to account for both potential
loss of lives due to the lack of resources and the opportunity cost of idle medical sources due to oversupply.
The structure of economic cost is used not only for its mathematical tractability, but also to penalize large
(i)

imbalance of demand and supply. The weight ωj can be used to measure the relative importance of resource
allocation for region i at time tj to other regions and time points. There are some examples of its applications
under various criteria for resource pooling or rationing. For example, in a national contingency planning,
where X (i) is used as predicted demand from each region, a metropolitan area with a large population may
carry more weight than a rural area with a small region for political reasons. When hospitals have to ration
limited resources, they may implement the strategy to maximize the benefit from treatment. In such a
setup, X (i) represents the demand from a particular cohort. A decision maker may give higher weight to
age cohorts with more remaining life years than age cohorts with less remaining years. It is also a common

18

strategy to give priorities for access to medical resources to healthcare workers. In both cases, the set of
(i)

weights ωj reflects the management’s priorities and preferences over time.
Pn
(i)
The constraint i=1 Kj = Kj indicates that resources allocated to different regions must add up to
the total amount of supply available to the central authority. The evolution of supply {Kj , j = 1, 2, . . . , m}
is based on the centralized stockpiling strategy discussed in previous sections. The evolution of demand
(i)

{Xj , i = 1, . . . , n, j = 1, 2, · · · , m} can be based on forecasts from epidemiological models fitted to most
recent local data.

Single-Use Resources: Personal Protective Equipment
The allocation of single-use resources is similar to that of durable resources. The key difference lies in the
amount of stockpile to be released each period. For durable resources, the central authority distributes the
accumulated stock Kj at any given time j. Because single-use resources cannot be reused, the central authority can only distribute incremental amount according to some distribution schedule. With this difference
in mind, we formulate the allocation of single-use resources by an optimization problem.

Note that the distribution amount kj could be determined prior to a pandemic by some contingency planning
or during a pandemic by an adjusted distribution schedule. The “Single-Use Resources: Personal Protective
Equipment” section offers an example of how such a distribution schedule can be determined to take into
temporal competition of single-use resources.

Holistic Allocation Algorithms
Because both allocation problems take the same form, their analytical solutions can be derived in the same
way. Because the allocation is done from period to period in the solution, we shall suppress the subscript j
for brevity. To simplify notation in the solution, we will use X (i) without the indicator of resource type for
the demand in region i, and use K (i) for the quantity of allocated resources in region i.
Here we discuss the analytical solutions to the optimization problems presented above, from which we can
glean economic insights. The proofs of these solutions are relegated to Appendix A.2. The central authority
has to first determine whether or not there is a system wide surplus or shortage. The allocation strategy
differs under these scenarios.
System wide surplus
If there is an overall surplus in the healthcare system at time j, i.e., K >

X (r) = X, then only the

(2)

r6=i

Observe that the allocation formula (2) has an explicit economic interpretation, which shows that the optimal
supply for region i results from a balance of two competing optimal solutions.
• Self-concerned optimal supply: X (i)
If region i can ask for as much as it needs, then this amount shows the ideal supply in the best interest
of the region alone. The demand and supply for all other regions are ignored in its consideration.
Pn
• Altruistic optimal supply: K − r=1;r6=i X (r)
If the region i places interests of all other regions above its own, then the medical supply goes to other
regions and region i ends up with the leftover amount.
The central authority has the responsibility to mediate among regions competing for resources. The formula
(2) indicates that the optimality for region i in consideration of the entire system is the weighted average of
two extremes, namely the self-concerned optimal and the altruistic optimal supplies. It should be pointed
.P

that the average of two optimal supplies is determined by the harmonic weighting ω(i) θ1−(i)
as
ω (r) θ −(r)

.P

opposed to arithmetic weight ω (i) θ−(i)
ω (r) θ−(r) . It is known in Chong, Feng, and Jin (2020) that in
r=1

multi-objective Pareto optimality the harmonic weighting is always used for balancing competing interests of
participants in a group whereas the arithmetic weighting serves the purpose of balancing competing objectives
of the same participant. The pandemic resource allocation problem is in essence a model of Pareto optimality
with regards to competing interests of members in a group.

It follows from (3) that the allocated resource is always presented as an adjustment to the actual demand.
When there is a surplus in the system supply after optimal supplies have been fully distributed to all regions,
then additional resource can be made available for region i and each region obtains a portion determined by
Pn
Pn
harmonic weighting. Observe that i=1 K (i) = K as expected since i=1 B (i) = 1.
System wide shortage
If there is an overall shortage in the healthcare system at time j, i.e., K ≤

Pn

r=1

X (r) = X, it turns out

that the optimal allocation strategy is to deliver the resources where they are needed the most. We can
summarize the algorithm in three steps:
Step 1: Demand ranking.

The first order of business is to sort regional demands {X (i) , i =

1, . . . , n} in a descending order. We use the subscript [i] to indicate the i-th largest order statistic, i.e.,
X [1] ≥ · · · ≥ X [n] ≥ 0. The ranking of regional demands determines the order in which the regions are
considered for resource allocation in the next step.
20

Step 2: Frugality test.

The algorithm first tests cases that perform allocation rules in a similar

way to (3). For any fixed I = 1, · · · , n, consider the holistic allocation rule that provides for I regions
with largest demand by

.

(4)

To find the optimal number I of regions to provide support to, the algorithm ensures that the allocation
rule should be frugal to meet the following criteria:
(i) The total supply K is only almost enough to meet the demands for all I regions;
K≤

I
X

X [r] .

r=1

(ii) When the allocation rule (4) is forcefully applied to all regions, the I regions with highest demands
should receive non-negative allocation and the rest of the group receive negative allocation.
K̃ [1] , · · · , K̃ [I] ≥ 0 > K̃ [I+1] , · · · , K̃ [n] .
There is a unique value of I that passes the frugality test. As the aim of the strategy is to cover as
many regions of highest demand as possible, the search algorithm stops after the total demand of I
regions exceeds the available supply. The algorithm would reach a rule that can be rewarding for those
I regions but discourages allocations to the rest.
Step 3: Holistic allocation. Once the algorithm settles on the value of I, all existing resources are
divided among the I states according to the holistic allocation principle. In other words, the allocation
of supply to the i-th region is given by
K [i] = K̃ [i] ,

∀i = 1, 2, · · · , I;

K [I+1] = · · · = K [n] = 0.
The general idea of the holistic allocation is illustrated in Figure 13. The burden of shortage Y :=
PI
[r]
− K is carried by all I states in proportion to their respective harmonic weight B̃ [i] . Therer=1 X
fore, each region receives its demand less its “fair” portion of system-wide shortage, i.e. X [i] − B̃ [i] Y.
The solution to the three-state alliance for pooling ventilators and PPE sets are shown in Figures 11 and
12. Figure 11b depicts the case of optimal allocation strategies for ventilators, which confirms the intuition
in the “Case Study” Section. In April, the central authority could have optimally reallocated all available
aggregate ventilators in the alliance to NY; This is owing to the fact that NY has the highest demand of
all three states. By May and June, ventilators in NY could have gradually reallocated to both FL and CA;
in July and August, with the reallocated resources from NY, both FL and CA should have experienced no
shortage of ventilators at all. Figure 12b illustrates optimal allocation strategies for PPE sets in the case
study. In April, the central authority could distribute stockpiled PPE sets and have all sent to NY for
emergency response; As the pandemic dies down for NY and picks up for CA and FL, the resources are more
evenly spread in June. By August, all PPE sets should be released to CA and FL both with high demands.

Figure 13: Holistic allocation of resources in face of system wide shortage

Conclusions and Limitations
The COVID-19 pandemic has placed extraordinary demands and constraints on public healthcare systems,
exposing many problems such as the lack of adequate planning and coordination among others. This paper
investigates what could have been done better to reduce the imbalance of medical resources demand and supply. Inspired by classical theory of risk aggregation and capital allocation, this paper proposes a three-pillar
resources planning and allocation framework — demand forecast, centralized stockpiling and distribution,
and centralized resources allocation. This paper further develops a novel spatio-temporal balancing of resources and can potentially used by public policymakers as quantitative basis for making informed decisions
on planning, funding and rationing of critical resources.
It should be pointed out that the paper focuses on managerial insights that can be drawn from the
optimization framework and its analytical solutions. There are admittedly a number of limitations in the
hypothetical example of a three-state resources pooling arrangement. The three states are chosen for the
most drastic effects of planning and allocation of existing resources for the purpose of illustration. It is beyond
the scope of this paper to consider the political reality that may prevent such arrangements. In theory, the
methodology can be applied to the actual voluntary coalition formed by six northwestern states in the US,
although the coalition was formed largely to avoid price competition in government procurement. Another
limitation of this example is the egalitarian approach to shortages in different regions, which ignores ethical
issues that may arise from freely moving resources from one region to another. While it may be economically
optimal to deliver all resources in the system to the place where they are needed the most, it may be
politically challenging to leave other places with less severe shortage without support. A potential remedy
would be to introduce additional constraints in the optimization problems that require some minimal support
for each region.

If K00 < 0, then the optimal initial stockpile, which minimizes the objective function above, K0∗ = 0, and if
K00 ≥ 0, then K0∗ = K00 .
Proof. Let Yj = Xj − aj, ∀j = 1, 2, · · · , m. Let Y[1] ≤ Y[2] ≤ · · · ≤ Y[m] be the increasingly ordered sequence
of Y1 , Y2 , · · · , Ym . In that case, Yj represents the daily shortage when the initial stockpile is completely
missing. Then the objective function becomes

Then ∃ K̃0 ∈ Y[1] , Y[m] such that G0 (K̃0 ) = 0. Since S = j=1 ωj cj + c0 ≥ 0, ∃ K00 ∈ (−∞, Y[m] ] such that


F 0 (K00 ) = 0, i.e., ∃ J = 1, · · · , m such that K00 ∈ Y[J−1] , Y[J] , where we define Y(0) = −∞, and F 0 (K00 ) = 0.
Here, we are relaxing the constraint that the initial stockpile has to be non-negative, but we will add it
back in the end. The key observation is that given all the (Y[j] )j∈{0,...,m} , we can always find a K00 between
two adjacent Y[j] ’s, Y[J−1] and Y[J] , that minimize the objective function. That is,
F 0 (K00 ) =

Case 1: Coexisting surpluses and shortages
First, let us consider the case in which some regions are having surpluses, whereas other regions are
experiencing shortages at the same time. We shall show below that this case is impossible regardless of the
non-negative constraints. That is, suppose that K (1) , K (2) , . . . , K (n) lie locally in a feasible set, such that I

However, ∀i = 1, 2 . . . , I, K (i) > X (i) , and ∀i = I + 1, . . . , n, K (i) ≤ X (i) , which implies K > r=1 X (r)

and K ≤ r=1 X (r) , and thus we have a contradiction. This result shows that it is impossible for some
regions to have surpluses while other regions are experiencing shortages. Therefore, it suffices to only consider
the scenarios that there is a system wide surplus and that there is a system wide shortage.

Apart from the given condition that

optimization problem. Hence, we make use of Karush-Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) conditions as follows.

ω (i) θ+(i) (K (i) − X (i) ) − λ1 + λ2 + µ = 0,

(i)

λ2 (K (i) − X (i) ) = 0,

λ1 ≥ 0,

(i)

λ2 ≥ 0,

(i)

for all i = 1, · · · , n. Regarding the values of λ1

(i)

and λ2 , we can consider the following four mutually

exclusive cases,
(i)

(i)

(i) λ1 > 0 for some i = 1, · · · , n, and λ2 > 0 for some i = 1, · · · , n;
(i)

(i)

(ii) λ1 = 0 for all i = 1, · · · , n, and λ2 > 0 for some i = 1, · · · , n;
(i)

(iii) λ1 > 0 for some i = 1, · · · , n, and λ2 = 0 for all i = 1, · · · , n;
(i)

(i)

(iv) λ1 = 0 for all i = 1, · · · , n, and λ2 = 0 for all i = 1, · · · , n.
Each of them will be discussed as follows.
(i)

(i)

Case 3.1: λ1 > 0 for some i = 1, · · · , n, and λ2 > 0 for some i = 1, · · · , n.
We will show that this case will lead to a contradiction, and thus is impossible. Because the ordering of
(i)
λ1

(i)

and λ2 does not affect the conditions, for simplicity, we rearrange them in such a way that there is an
I = 1, 2, . . . , n − 1, and an I˜ = 1, 2, . . . , n − 1, for which

[i]

λ1 > 0,

∀i = 1, . . . , I,

We also have the condition that I ≤ n − I,

˜ is at least the number of λ[i]
implies λ2 = 0. Therefore, the number of λ2 that are equal to 0, i.e., n − I,

that are greater than 0, i.e., I. Then by the complementary slackness conditions in the KKT conditions
above, K [i] = 0, ∀i = 1, 2, · · · , I and, K [i] = X [i] , ∀i = n − I˜ + 1, · · · , n.

from which we can observe the following contradiction that,

[1]

µ = ω [1] θ+[1] X [1] + λ1 > 0.
Therefore, we can conclude that if I˜ = 1, · · · , n − 1, then I = 0 or n, and its contrapositive is also true,
which states that if I = 1, · · · , n − 1, then I˜ = 0 or n. These two statements correspond the second and
third cases respectively, and they are considered as follows.

As in the previous case, We use the rearranged λ1 and λ2 , so now λ2 = 0, for all i = 1, . . . , n − I,

i = n − I˜ + 1, . . . , n.

In this case, the KKT conditions become

ω [i] θ+[i] (K [i] − X [i] ) + µ = 0,

This result can actually be seen as a special case of Case 3.3, where I = 0, and therefore, we can combine

In summary, the result depends on whether there is a system wide surplus or shortage. In the event of a
system wide surplus, i.e., K (i) > X (i) for i = 1, . . . , n, the optimal allocation in each region is given by
