Abstract
We present a stochastic optimization model for allocating and sharing a critical resource in the case of
a pandemic. The demand for different entities peaks at different times, and an initial inventory for a
central agency is to be allocated. The entities (states) may share the critical resource with a different
state under a risk-averse condition. The model is applied to study the allocation of ventilator inventory
in the COVID-19 pandemic by FEMA to different US states. Findings suggest that if less than
60% of the ventilator inventory is available for non-COVID-19 patients, FEMA’s stockpile of 20,000
ventilators (as of 03/23/2020) would be nearly adequate to meet the projected needs. However, when
more than 75% of the available ventilator inventory must be reserved for non-COVID-19 patients,
various degrees of shortfall are expected. In an extreme case, where the demand is concentrated in
the top-most quartile of the forecast confidence interval, the total shortfall over the planning horizon
(till 05/31/20) is about 28,500 ventilator days, with a peak shortfall of 2,700 ventilators on 04/12/20.
The results also suggest that in the worse-than-average to severe demand scenario cases, NY requires
between 7,600-9,200 additional ventilators for COVID-19 patients during its peak demand. However,
between 400 to 2,000 of these ventilators can be given to a different state after the peak demand in
NY has subsided.

Introduction

COVID-19 was first identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019 [21]. It has since become a global
pandemic. As of March 31, 2020 the United States has overtaken China in the number of deaths due
to the disease, with more than 3,900 deaths. Italy, which has 12,428 deaths, and Spain, which has
8,464, are the only two countries with higher death tolls. However, United States tops both of these
countries in the current number of confirmed COVID-19 cases (189,035) [5]. Confirmed cases in the
United States have more than doubled every three days in the time period since the first 100 cases were
detected. This is even faster than the increases observed in Spain and Italy at the same point in the
course of their epidemics [6]. In Northern Italy, one of the global epicenters of the pandemic, COVID19 has completely overwhelmed the healthcare system, forcing doctors into impossible decisions about
which patients to save. Physicians on the front lines have shared accounts of how they must now
weigh factors like age, comorbidities and probability of surviving prolonged intubation when deciding
which patients with respiratory failure will receive mechanical ventilation [24]. This experience is a
warning of what awaits the United States.

1.1

A Resource Constrained Environment

While approximately 80% of COVID-19 cases are mild, the most severe cases of COVID-19 can result
in respiratory failure, with approximately 5% of patients requiring treatment in an intensive care unit
(ICU) with mechanical ventilation [29]. Mechanical ventilation is used to save the lives of patients
whose lungs are so damaged that they can no longer pump enough oxygen into the blood to sustain
organ function. It provides more oxygen than can be delivered through a nasal cannula or face mask,
allowing the patient’s lungs time to recover and fight off the infection. Physicians in Italy have
indicated that critical COVID-19 patients often need to be intubated for a prolonged period of time
(15-20 days) [24], further exacerbating ventilator scarcity.
Limiting the death toll within the US depends on the ability to allocate sufficient numbers of
ventilators to hard hit areas of the country before infections peak and ensuring that the inventory
does not run out. Harder hit states (such as New York, Michigan and Louisiana) are now desperately
trying to acquire additional ventilators in anticipation of significant shortages in the near future. Yet
in the absence of a coordinated federal response, reports have emerged of states finding themselves
forced to compete with each other in order to obtain ventilators from manufacturers [1]. According to
New York’s Governer Cuomo, the state has ordered 17,000 ventilators at the cost of $25,000/ventilator,
but is expected to receive only 2,500 over the next two weeks [3]. As of 03/31/2020, according to
the US presidential news briefing, more than 8,100 ventilators have been allocated by FEMA around
the nation. Of these, 400 ventilators have been allocated to Michigan, 300 to New Jersey, 150 to
Louisiana, 50 to Connecticut, and 450 to Illinois, in addition to the 4,400 given to New York [9].
Going forward, the federal response to the COVID-19 pandemic will require centralized decisionmaking around how to equitably allocate, and reallocate, limited supplies of ventilators to states in
need. Projections from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, which assume that all states will institute strict social distancing practices and maintain them
until after infections peak, show states will hit their peak demand at different time points throughout the months of April and May. Many states are predicted to experience a significant gap in ICU
capacity, and similar, if not greater, gaps in ventilator capacity, with the time point at which needs
will begin to exceed current capacity varying by state [26].

Our Contributions

In response to the above problem, this paper presents a model for allocation and possible reallocation
of ventilators that are available in the national stockpile. Importantly, computational results from the
model also provide estimates of the shortfall of ventilators in each state under different future demand
scenarios.
This modeling framework can be used to develop master plans that will allocate part of the ventilator inventory here-and-now, while allocating and reallocating the available ventilators in the future.
The modeling framework incorporates conditions under which part of the historically available ventilator inventory is used for non-COVID-19 patients, who also present themselves for treatment along
with COVID-19 patients. Thus, only a fraction of the historical ventilator inventory is available to
treat COVID-19 patients. The remaining demand needs are met by allocation and re-allocation of
available ventilators from FEMA and availability of additional ventilators through planned production. The availability of inventory from a state for re-allocation incorporates a certain risk-aversion
parameter. We present results while performing a what-if analysis under realistically generated demand scenarios using available ventilator demand data and ventilator availability data for different
US states. An online planning tool is also developed and made available for use.

Literature Review

A review on the role of operations research to ensure equity in global health is provided in [14]. The
paper points out that poor availability of representative and high quality data, along with a lack of
collaboration between operations research scientists, healthcare practitioners, and stakeholders are
common challenges for effective operation research modeling in global health. A medical resource
allocation problem in a disaster is considered in [30]. Victims’ deteriorating health conditions are
modeled as a Markov chain, and the resources are allocated to optimize the total expected health
recovery rate and reduce the total waiting time. Certain illustrative examples in a queuing network
setting are also given in [30]. The problem of scarce medical resource allocation after a natural
disaster using a discrete event simulation approach is investigated in [15]. Specifically, the authors in
[15] investigate four resource-rationing principles: first come-first served, random, most serious first,
and least serious first. It is found that without ethical constraints, the least serious first principle
exhibits the highest efficiency. However, a random selection provides a relatively fairer allocation
of services and a better trade-off with ethical considerations. Resource allocation in an emergency
department in a multi-objective and simulation-optimization framework is studied in [17]. Simulation
and queuing models for bed allocation are studied in [28, 19].
The problem of determining the levels of contact tracing to control spread of infectious disease
using a simulation approach to a social network model is considered in [11]. A linear programming
model is used in investigating the allocation of HIV prevention funds across states [16]. This paper
suggests that in the optimal allocation, the funds are not distributed in an equitable manner. A linear
programming model to derive an optimal allocation of healthcare resources in developing countries
is studied in [18]. Differential equation-based systems modeling approach is used in [10] to find a
geographic and demographic dependent way of distributing pandemic influenza vaccines based on a
case study of A/H1N1 pandemic.
In a more recent COVID-19-related study, the author [22] proposes a probability model to estimate
the effectiveness of quarantine and isolation on controlling the spread of COVID-19. In the context
of ventilator allocation, a conceptual framework for allocating ventilators in a public emergency is
proposed in [31]. The problem of estimating mechanical ventilator demand in the United States
during an influenza pandemic was considered in [23]. In a high severity pandemic scenario, a need
of 35,000 to 60,500 additional ventilators to avert 178,000 to 308,000 deaths was estimated. Robust
models for emergency staff deployment in the event of a flu pandemic were studied in [12]. Specifically,
the authors focused on managing critical staff levels during such an event, with the goal of minimizing
the impact of the pandemic. Effectiveness of the approach was demonstrated through experiments
using realistic data.
A method for optimizing stockpiles of mechanical ventilators, which are critical for treating hospitalized influenza patients in respiratory failure, is introduced in [20]. In a case-study, mild, moderate,
and severe pandemic conditions are considered for the state of Texas. Optimal allocations prioritize
local over central storage, even though the latter can be deployed adaptively, on the basis of real-time
needs. Similar to this paper, the model in [20] uses an expected shortfall of ventilators in the objective
function, while also considering a second criteria of total cost of ventilator stockpiling. However, the
model in [20] does not consider distribution of ventilators over time. In the case of COVID-19, the
ventilator demand is expected to peak at different times in different states, as the demand for each
state has different trajectories. Only forecasts are available on how the demand might evolve in the
future.
In this paper, we assume that the planning horizon is finite, and for simplicity we assume that
reallocation decisions will be made at discrete times (days) t0 , t1 , t2 , . . . . Under certain demand
conditions, the ventilators may be in short supply to be able to meet the demand. Our model is

3

formulated as a stochastic program, and for the purpose of this paper, we reformulate and solve the
developed model in its extensive form. We refer the reader to [13, 27] for a general description of this
topic.

A Model for Ventilator Allocation

In this section, we present a multi-period planning model to allocate ventilators to different regions,
based on their needs, for the treatment of critical patients. We assume that the demand for ventilators
at each planning period is stochastic. We further assume that there is a central agency that coordinates
the ventilator (re)location decisions. The ventilators’ (re)location is executed at the beginning of a
time period. Once these decisions are made and executed, the states can use their inventory to treat
patients. Both the federal agency and the states have to decide whether to reserve their inventory in
anticipation of future demand or share it with other entities.
Before presenting the formulation, we list the sets, parameters, and decision variables that are
used in the model.
• Sets and indices
– N : states (regions), indexed by n ∈ N ,
– T : Planning periods, indexed by t ∈ T ,
• Deterministic parameters
– T : the total number of time periods, i.e, T := [T ], where [T ] := {1, . . . , T },
– Yn : the initial inventory of ventilators in region n ∈ N at time period t = 0,
– I: the initial inventory of ventilators in the central at the beginning of time period t = 1,
– Qt : the number of ventilators produced during the time period t − 1 that can be used at
the beginning of time period t, for t ≥ 1,
– γn : the percentage of the initial inventory of ventilators in region n ∈ N that cannot be
used to meet the demand for patients at the critical level,
– τn : the percentage of the initial inventory of ventilators in region n ∈ N that the region is
willing to share with other regions, among those that can be used to care for patients at
the critical level,
– ρn : the risk-aversion of region n ∈ N to send their idle ventilators to the central agency to
be shared with other regions,
• Stochastic parameter
– d˜n,t : the number of patients in regions n ∈ N at the critical level that need a ventilator at
the beginning of time period t ∈ T ,
• Decision variables
– xn,t : the number of ventilators relocated to region n ∈ N from the central agency at the
beginning of time period t ∈ T ,
– zn,t : the number of ventilators relocated to the central agency from region n ∈ T at the
beginning of time period t ∈ T ,
– yn,t : the number of ventilators at region n ∈ T that can be used towards treating the
patients at the critical level at the end of time period t ∈ {0} ∪ T ,
– st : the number of ventilators at the central agency at the end of time period t ∈ {0} ∪ T .

We will now explain the model in detail. The objective function (1a) denotes the expected total
shortage of ventilators over all time periods t ∈ T and all regions n ∈ N . Constraints (1b) and (1c)
ensure the conservation of ventilators for the regions and the central agency, respectively. Constraint
(1d) enforces that a region is not sending out any ventilator to the central agency if its in-hand
inventory is lower than its safety stock, where the safety stock is determined as ρn d˜n,t , for t ∈ [T ]
and n ∈ N . Constraint (1e) ensures that the total number of outgoing ventilators from the central
agency to the regions cannot be larger than the available inventory, after incorporating the newly
produced ventilators and the incoming ones from other regions. Constraints (1f) and (1g) set the
initial inventory at the regions and central agency, respectively. The remaining constraints ensure the
non-negativity of decision variables.
Note that the objective function and constraints (1d) are not linear. By introducing an additional
variable, the term (d˜n,t − yn,t )+ in the objective function, for n ∈ N and t ∈ T , can be linearized as
en,t ≥ d˜n,t − yn,t ,
en,t ≥ 0.
Furthermore, for each region n ∈ N and time period t ∈ T , constraint (1d) can be linearized as
yn,t − (1 − τn )yn,0 − ρn d˜n,t ≥ M (gn,t − 1),
zn,t ≤ yn,t − (1 − τn )yn,0 − ρn dn,t + M (1 − gn,t ),
zn,t ≤ M gn,t ,
gn,t ∈ {0, 1},
where M is a big number.
As mentioned before, we assume that d˜n,t , for n ∈ N and t ∈ T , in model (1) is a stochastic
parameter. Let us suppose that d˜n,t has a finite support. This, in turns, implies that for each t ∈ T ,
the vectors d̃t := [d˜n,t ]n∈N and D̃ := [d̃t ]t∈T have finite supports as well. We let Ω represent the
finite support of D̃, and use ω to denote an element of this set (i.e., a scenario).
Furthermore, suppose
P
that pω represents the probability of scenario ω ∈ Ω, where pω ≥ 0, and ω∈Ω pω = 1.

By incorporating the finiteness of the support of D̃, a linearized reformulation of model (1) can
be written as a mixed-binary program in the following extensive form:

In our computational experiments in Section 4, we used a commercial
mixed-integer programming

a decision maker will make decisions for the entire planning horizon using the information that is
available at the beginning of planning.

Ventilator Allocation Case Study: The US

The ventilator allocation model (2), described in Section 3, was implemented in Python 3.7. All
computations were performed using GUROBI 9.1, on a Linux Ubuntu environment, using 14 cores of
a PC with 3.4 GHz processor and 128 GB of RAM. An hour time limit was given for all the runs.

4.1

Ventilator Demand Data

Since projected ventilator need is a key input for the model, it is important to use accurate estimates of the demand forecasts. The forecasts of ventilator needs generated by [26] were used in our
computational study. These forecasts were made available on 03/26/2020, and used the most recent
epidemiological data and advanced modeling techniques. The available information closely tracks the
real-time data [4]. This COVID-19 needs forecast data was recently used in a recent presidential news
brief [9]. Although it is difficult to validate the ventilator need forecasts against actual hospital and
state level operational data, as this information is not readily available, we find that this model’s
forecasts for deaths are quite accurate. For example, the model forecasted 217.9 deaths (CI: [176.95,
271.0]) on 03/29/20 for NY state. The number of reported deaths in the state on 03/29/30 were 237.
6

Similarly, the model forecasted 262.2 deaths (CI: [206.9, 340]) on 03/30/20 against the actual deaths
of 253 on that day.

4.2

Demand Scenario Generation

We considered a seventy-day planning period, starting from March 23, 2020 and ending on May 31,
2020. We generated the random demands in ways that correspond to projected future demands under
different mitigation effects. More precisely, we considered four different cases to generate random
samples for the number of ventilators needed to care for COVID-19 patients. These cases are listed
below:
Case I. Average-I: Each of the demand scenarios have equal probability and the distribution is
uniform over the range of the CI provided in [26],
Case II. Average-II: The demand scenarios in the top 25% of CI have 0.25 probability (equally
distributed); and scenarios in the bottom 75% have 0.75 probability,
Case III. Worse than Average: The demand scenarios in the top 25% of CI have 0.50 probability;
and the scenarios in the bottom 75% have 0.50 probability.
Case IV. Severe: The demand scenarios in the top 25% of CI have 0.75 probability; and the demand
scenarios in the bottom 75% have 0.25 probability,
We further discuss the demand generation procedure. A demand scenario contains the demand
data for all days and states. In all Cases I–IV, we assumed that the forecast CI provided in [26], for
each day and for each state, represents the support of the demand distribution.
Case I and II are generated to develop average demand scenario representations that use the
information provided in the CI given in [26] in two different ways. In Case I, it is assumed that the
mean is the median of the demand distribution (i.e., the right- and left-tail of the demand distribution
have 0.5 probability). We randomly generated a number to indicate which tail to sample from, where
both tails have the same 0.5 probability of being chosen. Once the tail is determined, we divided the
tail into 50 equally-distanced partitions, and chose a random partition to uniformly sample from. We
repeated this process for all days and states. We sampled from the same tail and partition for all days
and states, although the range from which we sample depends on the CI. In this case, all scenarios
are equally likely.
In Case II, we randomly generated a number to indicate which tail to sample from, where the
top 25% of the CI (i.e., the right tail) has a 0.25 probability and the bottom 75% (i.e., the left tail)
has a 0.75 probability of being chosen. If the right tail is chosen, we set the weight of the scenario
to 0.25, and we set it to 0.75 otherwise. The rest of the procedure is similar to Case I. In order to
determine the probability of scenarios, we normalized the weights. Demand scenarios in Cases III-V
are generated in the same fashion as in Case II, where the only difference is in the probability of which
tail to choose from, which is determined by the sampling scheme described in the definition of the
case.
For each of the four cases above, we generated 24 scenarios. Note that in each case, different
quantities for the random demand d˜ω
n,t , t ∈ T , n ∈ N , and ω ∈ Ω, might be generated. An illustration
of the trajectory of demand scenarios over time is given in Figure 1 for the US and the States of New
York and California.

4.3

Ventilator Inventory, Stockpile and Production

Another key input to the planning model is the initial ventilator inventory. As of March 23, 2020,
before the rapid rise of COVID-19 cases in NY, FEMA had about 20,000 ventilators in reserve,
i.e., I = 20, 000. We used this for our model which suggests ventilator allocation decisions from
03/23/2020.

California, adapted from the data provided in [26]

Estimates for the initial inventory of ventilators at different states were obtained from [2]. These
estimates are based on a hospital survey [25, 7]. The estimates for new ventilator production were
obtained based on information provided at the US presidential briefings on 03/27/20 [8]. These estimates suggest that the normal yearly ventilator production capacity is about 30,000 ventilators/year.
However, under the US Defense Production Act, with the participation of additional companies, production of approximately 10,000 ventilators/month could be possible [8]. Using this information, for
the baseline case we assumed that the current daily ventilator production rate is 100 ventilators/day;
and it will be increased to 300 ventilators/day starting on April 15th.

4.4

Inventory Sharing Parameters

Recall that in the model, parameter γ is used to indicate the fraction of ventilators used to care
for non-COVID-19 patients. Additionally, a parameter τ is used in the model to estimate a state’s
willingness to share the fraction of their initial COVID-19-use ventilators. Similarly, the parameter
ρ is used to control the state’s risk-aversion to sending their idle ventilators to FEMA for use in a
different state. We suppose that for all states n, n ∈ N , we have γn = γ, ρn = ρ, and τn = τ . In
order to systematically study the ventilator allocations and shortfalls, we fixed the value of ρ to 1.5,
and we used the following parameters: γ ∈ {50%, 60%, 75%} and τ ∈ {0%, 10%, 25%}.

Numerical Results

For each setting (γ, τ ), we solved model (2) under Cases I–IV. A summary of results is reported in

Discussion

The results in Table 1 suggest that when up to 50% of a state’s ventilator inventory is used for nonCOVID-19 patients, FEMA’s current stockpile of 20,000 ventilators is sufficient to meet the demand
imposed by COVID-19 patients. This ventilator use threshold increases to 60% of non-COVID-19
patients, if states are willing to share up to 50% of their excess inventory with other states. However,
if no such sharing is considered, then a moderate number of ventilators (approximately 300) will be
required beyond FEMA’s current stockpile to meet demand in Cases I-IV.
The ventilator availability situation gets worse in the case where 75% (or greater %) of the available
ventilators must be used for non-COVID-19 patients. In this scenario, in Case III (Mildy Worse than
Average) and Case IV (Severe) the inventory shortfall on the worst day (04/12/2020) is between
1,500-2,700. This shortfall decreases moderately to 1,250-2,250 if states are willing to share part of
their initial ventilator inventory.

Concluding Remarks

We have presented a model for procuring and sharing life-saving resources whose demand is stochastic.
The demand arising from different entities (states) peaks at different times, and it is important
to meet as much of this demand as possible to save lives. Each participating state is risk averse
to sharing their excess inventory at any given time, and this risk-aversion is captured by using a
safety threshold parameter. Specifically, the developed model is applicable to the current COVID-19
pandemic, where many US states are in dire need of mechanical ventilators to provide life-support
to severely- and critically-ill patients. Computations were performed using realistic ventilator need
forecasts and availability under a wide combination of parameter settings.
Our findings suggest that the fraction of currently available ventilators that are to be used for nonCOVID-19 patients strongly impacts state and national ability to meet demand arising from COVID19 patients. When more than 40% of the existing inventory is available for COVID-19 patients, the
national stockpile is sufficient to meet the demand. However, if less than 25% of the existing inventory
is available for COVID-19 patients, the current national stockpile and the anticipated production may
not be sufficient under extreme demand scenarios. As expected, the magnitude of this shortfall
increases when one considers more and more extreme demand scenarios.
Overall, the model developed in this paper can be used as a planning tool/framework by state and
federal agencies in acquiring and allocating ventilators to meet national demand. The results reported
in this paper can also provide a guide to states in planning for their ventilator needs. We, however,
emphasize that these results are based on certain modeling assumptions. This include the process of
demand forecast scenario generation, estimates of initial ventilator inventory, and future production
quantities. Each one of these, as well as other model parameters, can be changed in the model input
to obtain more refined results. Nevertheless, an important finding is that a state’s willingness to share
its idle inventory can help address overall shortfall.
While this paper has focused on ventilator needs in the US, such a model can also be adapted
for use in international supply-chain coordination of equipment such as ventilators across countries.
COVID-19 is expected to have different peak dates and demand cycles in other counties, and one or
two additional disease spread cycles are likely until an effective vaccine becomes available.
In conclusion, we point out that the model developed in this paper has a one-time planning
decision, i.e., there are no “wait-and-see” decisions in the model. One can also formulate the ventilator
allocation problem as a time-dynamic multistage stochastic program, where the decision maker can
make recourse decisions as time evolves based on the information available so far on the stochastic
demands and past decisions. We are currently working on such an extension.
