Abstract. As of July 31, 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has over 17
million reported cases, causing more than 667,000 deaths. Countries irrespective of economic status have succumbed to this pandemic. Many
aspects of the lives, including health, economy, freedom of movement
have been negatively affected by the coronavirus outbreak. Numerous
strategies have been taken in order to prevent the outbreak. Some countries took severe resections in the form of full-scale lockdown, while others
took a moderate approach of dealing with the pandemics, for example,
mass testing, prohibiting large-scale public gatherings, restricting international travels. South America adopted primarily the lockdown strategies due to inadequate economy and health care support. Since the social
interactions between the people are primarily affected by the lockdown,
psychological distress, e.g. anxiety, stress, fear are supposedly affecting
the South American population in a severe way. This paper aims to explore the impact of lockdown over the psychological aspect of the people
of all the Spanish speaking South American capitals. We have utilized infodemiology approach by employing large-scale Twitter data-set over 33
million feeds in order to understand peoples interaction over the months
of this on-going coronavirus pandemic. Our result is surprising: at the
beginning of the pandemic, people demonstrated strong emotions (i.e.
anxiety, worry, fear) which declined over time even though the actual
pandemic is worsening by having more positive cases, and inflicting more
deaths. This leads us to speculate that the South American population
is adapting to this pandemic thus improving the overall psychological
distress.

Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic is one the of modern days calamity which currently
affects the population of almost every country in the world. The disease caused
by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV2) a.k.a
coronavirus, which is first identified in the Chinese city of Wuhan. Just over a
month, the pandemic is recognized as Public Health Emergency of International
Concern by the World Health Organization (WHO) [WHO, 2020]. As of July
31, this virus infected over 17 million people causing over 672,000 deaths.
The coronavirus demonstrated a fast growth of infections within and outside
of China and soon spread nearby Asian countries, Europe and North America.
This virus overwhelmed the sophisticated public health infrastructures of the developed countries, e.g. Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States,
consequently took many lives.
Numerous public safety measures have been taken in order to prevent the
fast spreading of the virus. Some countries utilized severe forms of measurement
such as full-scale lockdown strategy while others utilized moderate form of action
including mass testing, drive through testing, social distancing, limiting mass
gathering, travel restriction, etc. These strategies by no means have stopped the
on-going pandemic.
South America, first observed it’s case on 26 February 2020 in Brazil. By
June 26, it has more than 2 million confirmed cases consisting of 81,000 deaths,
eventually became on the main epicenter of coronavirus crisis in the world.
Being a continent consisting of mostly developing countries, South America
faces a unique challenge in dealing with the pandemic. Deprived health care
system and limited testing capability3 are among the main reasons for not dealing with COVID-19 crisis successfully. The primary measurement of most of
the South American capitals to deal with the coronavirus crisis is to limit the
restriction of human movement, e.g. partial to full-scale lockdown, prohibiting
large-scale public gathering, suspending schools. Since the lockdown is not sustainable and in fact, greatly impacting the livelihood of the people of developing
countries, eventually its needed to be lifted over in order to bolster the economy.
Apart from the health and economic crisis due to the COVID-19 outbreak,
limiting the freedom of movement significantly impacts our psychological wellbeing. Amid of lockdown, people are more vulnerable towards the apprehension
of the unforeseeable future. Therefore, understanding the psychological hardship
of the South American population during this pandemic will be a great means
to facilitate the judicious public health decisions during this ongoing pandemic
which is likely to be prevalent for some time period.
Infodemiology[Eysenbach, 2011] is a new research field, with the objective of
monitoring public health[Kamel Boulos et al., 2010] in order to support public
policies based on electronic sources, i.e. Internet. In infodemiology, the data that

to extensive testing.

is used in research is primarily open, and textual having no structure and comes
from different internet services, e.g. blogs, social networks, and websites.
One of the key aspects of making rapid and effective public health actions
is to concurrently observe the situation that demanded a fast response. Infoveillance approach could perform real-time monitoring of the situation by utilizing
so-called social sensors[Wang et al., 2018], where individual or communities of
people share their present status through different social media platforms (e.g.
Facebook, Twitter). The data from social media could effectively be utilized
in real-time in order to make adaptive public health measures to alleviate crisis demonstrating unpredictability in nature such as a pandemic or a disease
outbreak. The infoveillance approach, tailored towards surveillance proposals
has previously been applied to monitor H1N1 pandemic with data source from
Twitter [Chew and Eysenbach, 2010], a Dengue outbreak in Brazil using Social
Sensors and Natural Language Processing[Chire Saire, 2019], COVID-19 symptoms in Bogota, Colombia using Text Mining [Chire Saire and Navarro, 2020].
In this paper, we are trying to understand how COVID-19 is impacting the
psychological health of the population in Spanish speaking South American capitals. We are utilizing the infodemiologyic approach to understand our research
question by analyzing social media data sets. In summery, the contributions
of the paper are as follows:
– We explore how the population living in the Spanish speaking South American capitals facing the psychological distress during COVID19 pandemic.
We demonstrated that the Infoveillance approach of analyzing social media
data, i.e. Twitter, can be effectively utilized to understand people’s mental status during the pandemic. Surprisingly, this has not been considered
before.
– We have collected a large number of Twitter feeds of all the Spanish speaking South American capitals which are cumulatively around 33 million of
data points and applied proper data mining methods in order to effectively
understand our research question (discussed in section 2).
– Our results described in Section 3.2 is counter-intuitive and surprisingly
demonstrated that people’s interest in the pandemic is decreasing, inferring
that the psychological distress is elevating over the months while the actual
pandemic is worsening (discussed in section 4). This is the most important
finding of our work.
– In section 3.3, we have verified our findings with another social media platform, i.e. Google Trend, and demonstrated that similar pattern can also be
observed in Google Search.
– We discuss our overall finding and speculate that this can be a potential
starting point to perform comprehensive research to explore the infoveillance
approach for understanding the psychological impact due to COVID-19 pandemic.
This paper is structured as follows: section 2 explains the Data Process Analysis for our experiments, section 3 presents results and analysis. Section 4 provides
the discussion and Section 5 states the conclusions.

Data Process Analysis

The present analysis is inspired by the Cross Industry Standard Process for Data
Mining(CRISP-DM) [Shearer, 2000] steps, which consists of the frequent phases
of Data Mining tasks. The workflow for data analysis is presented in Fig. 1
consists of five steps.

2.1

Selecting the Scope and Social Network

South America, being one of the most impacted continents of the pandemic, consists of 10 countries where official languages are either Spanish or Portuguese.
Among those, Brazil is the only county where the official language is Portuguese.
The rest of 9 countries in South America where Spanish is the official language are Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay, Per, Uruguay,
Venezuela. Table 1 presents the corresponding data related to Spanish spoken
countries.

can potentially be utilized to inspect an event using interaction in the social media platform through posts/publications. Twitter is the choice of social network
used in this work since the population of all the Spanish speaking countries uses
it. Users on Twitter can send messages up to 240 characters long. It also facilities
and access to data through its Application Programming Interface(API), which
data scientists prefer for the ease of collecting the data.
2.2

Find the Relevant Terms to Search

Initially, we are interested in finding the twitter feeds related of coronavirus
pandemic. In order to perform this, we have chosen terms that are related to
coronavirus such as: coronavirus, covid19, etc. Since the users do not follow a
specific pattern to a keyword when writing a post, where @coronavirus, #covid19, #covid 19 all similar to keyword COVID-19, we have considered variations
of having special characters (i.e. @, #, –, ) in our search terms. Similar strategy
has also been utilized in the work of [Chire Saire, 2020].
2.3

Build the Query to Collect Twitter Data

The query to extract tweets using API uses the next parameters:
–

–
2.4

date: 01-04-2020 to 30-06-2020
terms: the chosen words mentioned in previous subsection
geolocalization: the longitude and latitude of 9 Spanish speaking capitals
language: Spanish
radius: 50 km
Preprocessing of the Data

We have performed the following pre-processing steps in order to filter out unwanted information that could impact our analysis.
–

–
–
2.5

Cleaning urls using regular expressions
Eliminating non-alphabet characters
Converting all text to lowercase only letters
Deleting stopwords, e.g. articles, conjunctions
Visualization

When we are considering visualization, our paper depicts data from two different
sources:
– Twitter data: filtering with 3 specific keywords related to peoples psychological distress which are anxiety, fear and stress.
– Google Trend’s data: for displaying what is trendy for a particular keyword
in google search for our chosen countries.

Evolution of Interest on Twitter related to Psychological
Distress

In this section, we are exploring how the psychological distress that related to
our three terms anxity, fear, and stress evolve over four months of time from
March to June during this pandemic for the 9 capital cities. We have divided 9
capitals among 3 different figures having 3 capitals each which are presented in
Fig. 2,3,4. In these figures, we present the months from March until June in the
x-axis, while in the y-axis, we have reported the corresponding frequency that is
appeared for the corresponding psychological terms for that particular month.

Fig. 4 introduces the outcome for Paraguay, Uruguay and Venezuela. All
three countries demonstrated a decreasing trend in frequency of posts from
March to June for the corresponding three terms: stress, anxiety and fear.
One clear conclusion can be made that all South American countries have a
decreasing trend for these three terms related to psychological distress.

3.3

Validating the Analysis using Google Trend

In order to validate our finding, we have considered the Google Trends to have
a perspective about how South American peoples interest over coronavirus generally appeared in the Google Search.
In Fig. 5, we have displayed the frequency of coronavirus search term appeared in Google Search during March until July, relevant to our 9 countries.

Fig. 5: Google Trends with search term coronavirus (vertical dashed lines separates the months)

Surprisingly, all the countries present a decreasing interest of term coronavirus which is similar to our previous analysis using Twitter data.
In fact, it is quite surprising that the interest of the South American population are similar when it comes to the interest in coronavirus and almost all the
country follows a similar trend.

Discussion

Are people in South America have been accustomed to the pandemic? In order
to understand such phenomena, in Fig. 6, we have depicted the daily new cases
and deaths corresponds to the COVID-19 pandemic for the month of March until
July 2020.

11

From Fig. 6, it is clearly evident that in most South American countries, both
the total number of new cases and death are low at the beginning which increases
over time. Interestingly, at the beginning of March/April, most countries impose
a stricter restriction on peoples freedom of movement, such as forced lockdown,
however, peoples psychological distress was high (demonstrated in two previously Subsections 3.2 and 3.3) even having relatively low number of active cases
and deaths. As the coronavirus pandemic exacerbates by having more positive
cases and deaths, peoples apprehension about the coronavirus is surprisingly
alleviated. This might properly explain why enforced confinement enables psychological distress upon the population.

Conclusions

In this paper, we have employed large scale social-media data (i.e. Twitter) in
order to understand the psychological distress due to COVID-19 pandemic of
the Spanish speaking South American population. We have found that even
though coronavirus pandemic is aggravating with having more active cases and
deaths, people’s interaction in social media related to anxiety, worry, and fear
of coronavirus is decreasing. We are speculating that people are becoming more
accustomed to the pandemic compare to the beginning. This leads us to an
optimistic conclusion that the people mental distress is alleviating reflecting the
innate nature of humanity for overcoming tough-time.
