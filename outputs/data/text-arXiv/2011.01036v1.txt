Abstract
Nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPI) such as banning public events or instituting lockdowns have been widely applied around the world to control the current COVID-19 pandemic.
Typically, this type of intervention is imposed when an epidemiological indicator in a given
population exceeds a certain threshold. Then, the nonpharmaceutical intervention is lifted
when the levels of the indicator used have decreased sufficiently. What is the best indicator to
use? In this paper, we propose a mathematical framework to try to answer this question. More
specifically, the proposed framework permits to assess and compare different event-triggered
controls based on epidemiological indicators. Our methodology consists of considering some
outcomes that are consequences of the nonpharmaceutical interventions that a decision maker
aims to make as low as possible. The peak demand for intensive care units (ICU) and the total
number of days in lockdown are examples of such outcomes. If an epidemiological indicator
is used to trigger the interventions, there is naturally a trade-off between the outcomes that
can be seen as a curve parameterized by the trigger threshold to be used. The computation of
these curves for a group of indicators then allows the selection of the best indicator the curve
of which dominates the curves of the other indicators. This methodology is illustrated using
indicators in the context of COVID-19 using deterministic compartmental models in discretetime, although the framework can be adapted for a larger class of models.

Introduction

After the initial outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, the novel coronavirus SARS-COV-2 has
spread to multiple countries [34] causing over 37 million cases and more than 1 million deaths by
October 12, 2020 [52]. Since the emergence and global spread of COVID-19 in a context where
no approved vaccines, treatments, or prophylactic therapies are available [3], countries have implemented different nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPI) [27]. These prevention, containment,
and mitigation policies have been implemented in order to flatten the peak of critical cases and
consequently, to prevent as far as possible the health systems from being overwhelmed [3, 43].
Public health policy responses to the pandemic aim both to limit the number and duration of
social contact. They include measures such as early detection of cases, and tracing and isolating
infected individual’s contacts (testing and contact tracing), the use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) by health care workers, and social distancing measures, among others [3, 43]. Social
distancing interventions include working from home, school closures, cancellation of public gatherings and restrictions on unnecessary movement outside one’s residence such as national or partial
lockdowns [3, 21, 27, 43]. These measures have been shown to be successful in reducing the spread
of SARS-COV-2 [3, 27]. Lockdowns, in particular, have had a substantial effect on the transmission
as measured by the changes in the estimated reproduction number [27]. In fact, a modeling study
of the demand for hospital services in the UK found that intermittent periods of more intensive
lockdown-type measures are predicted to be effective in preventing health system overload [21].
Beyond the aforementioned health consequences of the pandemic, it also has important economic
consequences [37, 40], throwing many countries into recession and possible economic depression [12].
The economic impact can be direct and indirect [8, 12, 25, 37, 41], at the individual or aggregate
level, affecting firms and different sectors [37, 42], and with effects in the short, medium and long
term [8, 12, 29, 42]. The negative economic effects may vary based on the severity of the social
distancing measures, the length of their implementation, and the degree of compliance [12], and, as
usual, in times of crises the most vulnerable groups are affected the most [13, 36].
Health systems must face direct costs related to the diagnosis and confirmation testing, outpatient and inpatient care, and vaccines and pharmaceutical treatments when these become available
[25, 41]. On the other hand, productivity is affected by both absenteeism (patients and preventive
isolation) and deaths caused by the virus [12, 25, 41, 48].
In this context, authorities are constantly searching for balance between health and economic
consequences; with the latter being the result of not only the former but also of the measures or
policies implemented to confront the health issues. This is the case for the aforementioned lockdowns
that keep the individuals of a certain locality or sector confined and, therefore, reduce the economic
activity. Therefore, it is possible to perceive a trade-off between the extension of lockdowns, and
its impact on productivity, and the health outcomes observed; for instance, the longer lockdown

2

period, the fewer intensive care units (ICU) required (or number of cases, or deaths). In terms of
the objective for the decision makers, it is sought to minimize both the lockdowns duration and the
health consequences [2, 30].
Several countries and cities have used epidemiological indicators to activate, reinstate and release
NPI such as lockdowns. In fact, in [51], the World Health Organization (WHO) has proposed
various public health criteria to adjust public health and social measures in the context of COVID19. The criteria are grouped into three domains: Epidemiology, Health system and Public health
surveillance. Many of these criteria can be expressed in terms of the following indicators: effective
reproduction number, active new cases, positivity rate, and hospitalization and intensive care unit
(ICU) admissions due to COVID-19.
In this context, the government of San Francisco (US) has published on its website [46] various
health indicators used to monitor the level of COVID-19 in the city and assess the ability of its health
care system to respond to the pandemic. These health indicators are grouped into 5 areas: hospital
system, cases, testing, contact tracing and personal protective equipment. The first three areas
are characterized in terms of the following observations: COVID-19 hospitalizations, acute care
beds available, ICU beds available, new cases per day per 100,000 residents, and tests collected per
day. The last two areas consider the indicators related to contact tracing and personal protective
equipment that are beyond the scope of our study. In other places, such as the city of Austin
(US), it was decided to track daily COVID-19 hospital admissions and daily total hospitalizations
across the city and trigger the initiation and relaxation of lockdown periods when admissions cross
predetermined thresholds [24].
In the case of Chile, and in particular its capital, Santiago, which is our main case study, at
the beginning of the outbreak, the government used indicators mainly based on the active cases
(per 100,000 residents and per area) and on the available hospital beds to activate lockdowns
[19]. These lockdowns were dynamically applied to the most affected sectors of the cities. Since
July 2020, a five-steps plan known as “Paso a Paso” (Step by Step), has been used to release
and reinstate various NPI measures including lockdowns [18]. Following the recommendations of
the World Health Organization [51] and of the COVID-19 advisory council [1], an independent
organism conceived to guide the Chilean Ministry of Public Health in the policies that will be
implemented to face the COVID-19 outbreak; this plan now takes into account several dimensions
of the pandemic through the monitoring of the following indicators: ICU beds available, effective
reproductive number, new active cases, positivity rate, and some additional tracing and surveillance
indicators. Thus, lockdowns are now release/reinstate for a given district of a city when the values
of these indicators, computed for such districts, are below/above the predetermined thresholds.
Given the aforementioned situation, our aim is to propose a framework based on control theory
that permits to assess and compare NPI policies based on epidemiological indicators.
It is important to note that the application of NPI strategies to mitigate the effects of the

3

COVID-19 pandemic has been already modeled using optimal control techniques. For instance, in
[22], optimal control theory is used to explore the best strategy for implementation while waiting
for the development of a vaccine. More specifically, they seek a solution minimizing deaths and
costs due to the implementation of the control strategy itself.
The same objective is studied in [45] by the means of an age-structured optimal control model.
Specifically, a model with a double continuous structure by host age and time since infection is
proposed. In [9], the authors also propose an optimal control model with infection age. The main
difference from the previous model is the consideration of the peak value in the objective function
that leads to a problem with state constraints. This work has generated an open access code,
based on the optimal control toolbox BOCOP. An SIR model is studied in [4] to derive a simple
but mathematically rigorous criterion for designing optimal transitory NPIs. In particular, the
authors found that reducing the reproduction number below one is sufficient but not necessary.
This condition may be prescribed according to the maximum health services’ capacity.
In all of the cited articles, (optimal) control strategies are obtained numerically or analytically
in closed-loop form (as in [4]) requiring the assumption that the state variable is perfectly observed.
Moreover, these works consider that the effects of NPIs are perfectly controllable by the decision
maker without taking into account that a decision regarding the application or release of an NPI may
require time for the population to adapt. These considerations are important when the proposed
trajectories are composed by bang-bangs, singular arcs or saturation of constraints, because in
practice, these controls may be very difficult to implement.
Additionally, since NPIs activation/release decisions based on the observation of indicators are
made at specific given moments (for instance, lockdowns may be activated on Mondays for the
whole week, or always at a given time of the day, etc.), they would not be faithfully represented
through the aforementioned approaches. This is a key aspect when one of the objectives of the
study is to provide recommendations to decision makers.
Thus, our first aim is to propose a framework for representing the decision-making process
related to the application of NPIs based on the observation of epidemiological indicators. The
proposed framework uses event-triggered controls in discrete time. To the best of our knowledge,
the notion of event-triggered control was first introduced in [6] and allows to model update instants
(in the decision, or control) by the violation of a condition depending on the state of the system,
instead of assuming a constant or a periodic updating. As mentioned above, the event-triggered
decisions is precisely the framework such as the NPIs that are being applied in several places,
because depending on whether or not some indicators are in violation of their respective thresholds,
the NPIs are applied or lifted.
In recent years, event-triggered control techniques have attracted increasing interest with studies
focusing on the stabilization of event-triggered implementations and the existence of a minimum
interevent time (see for instance [7, 10, 23, 28, 38, 47, 49, 56]). In our work, these topics are not

4

addressed because it is assumed that the stabilization is not an issue, in the sense that we are
not concerned with the final state of the system but rather we seek to be able to determine what
type of indicator-based strategy is more suitable for use. Ensuring the minimum interevent time
is not an issue in our framework, because we impose this minimum interevent time to avoid the
application and lifting (or vice versa) of an NPI in a short period of time, which is the practice we
have observed in cited examples. Moreover, we consider the possibility that decisions can be taken
(apply or release an NPI) only at some prescribed times, for instance, only on Mondays, making
the modeling of the decision-making process more realistic.
In addition to realistically representing the decision-making process based on the observation of
indicators, our approach allows the assessment and comparison of the use of indicators from a costbenefit perspective. Indeed, based on the discussion given in this introduction section, we assume
that a decision maker aims to obtain as few as possible of some outcomes that are consequences
of the NPIs. The peak of ICU beds demand and the total number of days in lockdown are two
examples of such undesired outcomes.
Therefore, if the policy for activating or releasing NPIs is triggered by some observation or, more
specifically, when a given indicator (computed in terms of these observations) is above or below a
certain threshold, we can link all of these thresholds with their respective observations.
Thus, considering the trigger threshold as a parameter, one can construct the curve of outcomes
associated with a given indicator. This curve lies in the space of outcomes and it is called the
trade-off curve. This curve allows the identification of the trade-offs between different outcomes.
Moreover, after computing these curves for several indicators, they can be compared to choose an
indicator that will determine the policy. Indeed, for instance, if one of the curves dominates the
others in the Pareto sense (that is, the curve is below the others), this immediately suggests that
the corresponding indicator is the most suitable for the outcomes considered in the analysis.
On the other hand, when no domination occurs between the curves, a decision can be taken by
setting all but one outcomes as objectives (viewed as upper bounds). This allows the determination
of the best indicator as that with the lowest value for the outcome not considered as the objective.
Thus, the proposed methodology allows the comparison of the use of indicators to trigger either
the application or release of NPIs.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we introduce the proposed framework
that we use to model the making decision process, that is, discrete-time control systems and eventtriggered controls. In section 3, we define the trade-off curve associated with a trigger indicator and
show how to compare these curves in order to choose the best indicator to activate/release NPIs. To
illustrate the proposed modeling framework and methodology for the assessment of the indicators, in
section 4 we discuss two case-studies, corresponding to Chile and China, where different indicators
are evaluated. Finally, some concluding remarks are stated in section 5.

Mathematical framework based on event-triggered controls

2.1

Discrete-time control systems

Given an initial time t0 ∈ N, a horizon time T ∈ N (with T > t0 ), an initial state x0 ∈ X and a
finite sequence of controls u = (u(t))Tt=t0 = (u(t0 ), . . . ,u(T )), we consider the discrete-time control
system:
x(t + 1) = f (t,x(t),u(t)),

t ∈ [[t0 : T ]], x(t0 ) = x0 .

(1)

In this setting, f : [[0 : N ]] × X × U −→ X is the dynamics, X is a vector space, called the state
space, and U is a compact set of a given vector space satisfying 0 ∈ U (representing no action).
The latter is called the control space. Here, when p ≤ q, [[p : q]] denotes the collection of all integers
between p and q (inclusive).
Several epidemiological models can be represented as system (1). For instance, the state x ∈ X
can model the number of individuals in different stages of a disease (e.g., SEIR compartmental
models; See, for instance, [11] and references therein) in different populations (e.g., counties, cities,
age-groups, etc.), and the control u ∈ U can model the application of one or more NPIs to some
groups of the population under study.
We denote by U the collection of all possible controls; that is,

U = u = (u(t))Tt=t0 u(t0 ), . . . ,u(T ) ∈ U ∼
= UT −t0 +1 .

A solution of the control system (1) associated with a control u ∈ U is an element of the space

+1
x(t0 ), . . . ,x(T + 1) ∈ X ∼
X = x = (x(t))Tt=t
= XT −t0 +2 ,
0

that satisfies the initial time condition x(t0 ) = x0 .

2.2

Event-triggered controls

For ∆ ∈ N, with 0 ≤ ∆ < T − t0 , we consider feedback controls based on the recent history of the
state, that is, the state in the current time t and in the previous ∆ times t − 1, . . . ,t − ∆ (if ∆ > 0).
Therefore, for t ∈ [[t0 : T ]], we introduce the notation
x∆ (t) = (x(t − ∆), . . . ,x(t)) ∈ X∆+1 .
If t − ∆ < t0 , in the definition of x∆ (t), we repeat the initial state x0 in the first t0 − t + ∆
components.

6

Motivated by the current practice, we consider x∆ (t) instead of x(t) for defining our policies.
Indeed, as mentioned in the introduction, the use of epidemiological indicators for triggering either
the application, or the release, of NPIs considers the state of the disease in a window of time and
not instantaneously.
To reduce the control variability, we turn to the event-triggered state feedback control based on
the recent history of the state. For this purpose, we introduce an event-triggered set S ⊆ X∆+1
in order to determine the variations in the control law which in turn are produced by a transition
of the recent history x∆ (t), either from S to its complement S c , or vice versa. To compute these
transitions, we define the indicator (XOR) function ϕS : X∆+1 × X∆+1 −→ {0,1} by

ϕS (x∆ ,x̃∆ ) =


 0

if (x∆ ,x̃∆ ) ∈ (S × S) ∪ (S c × S c )
if (x∆ ,x̃∆ ) ∈ (S × S c ) ∪ (S c × S)

 1

for all (x∆ ,x̃∆ ) ∈ X∆+1 ×X∆+1 . The event-triggered set S will then define the application (x∆ ∈
/ S)
or release (x∆ ∈ S) of an NPI.
Now, we define the following event-triggering mechanism

u(t0 ) =

and


 0

if x0 ∈ S

 u ∈U
ref

(2)

if x0 ∈
/S

u(t) = u(t − tk ,x∆ (tk ),u(tk )) tk < t ≤ tk+1 ,

(3)

where the trigger times tk are updated according to rule (5) given below, and the controller u : [[0 :
T − t0 ]] × X∆+1 × U −→ U is defined by

u(τ,x∆ ,u) =


 û− (τ,u)
 û (τ,u)
+

if x∆ ∈ S

(4)

if x∆ ∈
/ S,

with û− , û+ : [[0 : T − t0 ]] × U −→ U reference time-varying controls associated with the NPI to
be applied. Functions û− (·,u) and û+ (·,u) satisfy û− (0,u) = û+ (0,u) = u for all u ∈ U. The
controller u(τ,x∆ ,u) is then defined (in (4)) through two types of policies depending on whether
or not x∆ belongs to the event-triggered set S. Thus, this models the application of a given NPI
or the release of this measure. This policy, consisting of applying or not some NPIs, is eventually
time-varying on the intervals [[tk : tk+1 ]], and can model a variable intensity or an adoption degree
that changes with time. For instance, in a population where an NPI has been applied for a long
period of time, when the intervention is lifted, some time is required to return to the activity levels
(of contact rates, mobility, etc.) identical to those prior to the application of the NPI. In addition,

7

the controller takes into account the last control u applied in the previous interval [[tk−1 : tk ]] with
the aim of allowing (but not limiting to) smooth variations of the applied policies.
The trigger times tk in (3) are given by
tk+1 = tk + tmin + min{t ≥ 0 | ϕS (x∆ (tk ),x∆ (tk + tmin + t)) = 1}.

(5)

In the above definition, we have considered a minimum fixed period of time tmin ∈ [[∆ : T − t0 ]]
during which the event-triggered control is applied, thus imposing a minimum interevent time. The
interevent time is assumed to be greater or equal to ∆ which is the time window where the state
variable is considered in order to have enough time to observe the effects of the application of the
NPI, or of its release. On the other hand, the element
x∆ (tk + tmin + t) = (x(tk + tmin + t − ∆), . . . ,x(tk + tmin + t))
in (5) is the sequence of states obtained from
x(τ + 1) = f (τ,x(τ ),u(τ − tk ,x∆ (tk ),u(tk )))

τ ∈ [[tk : tk + tmin + t − 1]]

with initial condition x(tk ).
More generally, trigger times in (5) can be defined as
tk+1 = tk + tmin + ξday (min{t ≥ 0 | ϕS (x∆ (tk ),x∆ (tk + tmin + t)) = 1}) ,
where the function ξday : [[0 : T − t0 ]] −→ [[0 : T − t0 ]] can be introduced in order to impose a
change in the control policy in the prescribed periods. For instance, if the time unit is day and
the application (or release) of an NPI must start on a Monday, when t0 is a Monday, we take tmin
 
a multiple of seven and the function ξday (t) = 7 7t , where ⌈α⌉ is the smallest integer that is also
greater or equal than α.
To summarize, the event-triggered feedbacks considered in this paper are defined by:
1. Observation time window ∆: period of time in which the state is observed for defining the
closed-loop strategy;
2. Minimum time of implementation tmin : period of time (with tmin ≥ ∆) imposed for avoiding
high variability in the control and in order to observe the effects of the applied measures;
3. Event-triggered set S: set of recent history of states for determining variations in the policy
through transitions from S to S c or in the inverse sense. The definition of set S depends on
∆;

8

4. Controller u: the function defining the control through mechanism described in (2), (3), and
(4). The definition of the controller u depends on functions û− and û+ in (4) and on ∆ and
S.
An event-triggered feedback will be denoted by u = m(x0 ,∆,tmin ,u,S) ∈ U in order to highlight that
the associated control u is completely defined by the event-triggered mechanism (the four elements
listed above) and the initial condition x0 at time t0 .
Hence, given the mathematical formalism described above, the main objective of this paper is
to compare different even triggered controls assuming that all of them have common controllers u
with same functions û− and û+ in (4) (that is, all of the policies apply the same NPI, and in the
same manner). In addition, since the initial state x0 is fixed for all of our analyses, we simplify the
notation of event-triggered feedbacks by u = m(∆,tmin ,S).

NPI strategies based on indicators and their trade-offs

In this section, we specify the event-triggered set S in the definition of event-triggered controls
introduced in section 2.2. The particular forms considered of the set S are provided by an epidemiological indicator (observation). Thus, considering the space of the recent history of states X∆+1
and an indicator I : X∆+1 −→ R, we will work with event-triggered sets S in the form
S = S(∆,I,θ) = {x∆ ∈ X∆+1 | I(x∆ ) ≤ θ},
where θ ∈ R is a threshold for the indicator I.
If in the period of time [[t − ∆ : t]], we consider instantaneous observations of the state, represented by the function O : X −→ R, the following indicators I can be considered:
a) the mean of instantaneous observations:
I(x∆ (t)) =

t
X
1
O(x(τ ));
∆+1
τ =t−∆

b) the mean of differences of instantaneous observations:
I(x∆ (t)) =

1
∆+1

t
X

(O(x(τ )) − O(x(τ − 1))) =

τ =t−∆+1

O(x(t)) − O(x(t − ∆))
;
∆+1

c) variation rate of instantaneous observations:
I(x∆ (t)) =

O(x(t)) − O(x(t − ∆))
;
O(x(t − ∆))
9

d) variation rate of differences of instantaneous observations:
I(x∆ (t)) =

t
X
O(x(t)) − O(x(t − 1))
1
.
∆+1
O(x(t − 1))
τ =t−∆

The specific instances of observations O can be the number of infected people [1, 19, 18, 46, 51],
number of deaths associated with COVID-19 [51], excess mortality due to pneumonia [51], number
of tests [46], positivity rate [18, 51], COVID-19 total hospitalizations [24, 18, 46, 51] and the
number of people in ICU beds [18, 46, 51], among others. Additionally, the formalism introduced
above permits to consider more elaborated indicators I computed from x∆ (t), such as the effective
reproductive number [18, 51].
We update the notation of an event-triggered feedback by u = m(∆,tmin ,I,θ), noticing that the
event-triggered set S now depends on indicator I and threshold θ.

3.1

Trade-offs of event-triggered policies based on indicators

For a fixed initial state x0 ∈ X and a given control sequence u ∈ U, we assume that m ∈ N (m ≥ 2)
outcome measures are observed. These outcomes are represented by a function P : X × U −→ Rm
and, in our convention, we want these to be as low as possible. Examples of these outcomes are
the peak demand of ICU beds, the total number of deaths (directly attributed to the COVID-19
outbreak) and the total number of days of lockdown (i.e., shelter-in-place), or of any other NPI.
The first two outcomes are related to the health cost of to the pandemic, while the third-one is
a proxy for the economic and societal cost of the policy. Intuitively, there should be a trade-off
between the different outcomes, in the sense that a lower outcome of one kind (e.g., peak demand
of ICU beds) will lead to a greater outcome of the other kind (e.g., total time of NPI), as it is
proven in [4]. Of course, one can take a group of outcomes where the mentioned trade-off does
not exist (e.g., peak demand of ICU beds and the total number of deaths), but even in these cases
it is interesting to quantify the links between these outcomes. Therefore, we propose to compute
the outcomes given by an event-triggered feedback u = m(∆,tmin ,I,θ) when the threshold θ varies.
With this information, decision makers can observe the links between the outcomes provided by the
policy based on the indicator I and, for instance, to evaluate the marginal variation of one outcome
when other outcome decreases/increases.
For a given event-triggered feedback u = m(∆,tmin ,I,θ), we define the trade-off curve associated
with indicator I, and parametrized by thresholds θ, as follows
C(x0 ,∆,tmin ,I) = {P(x0 ,u) | u = m(∆,tmin ,I,θ); θ ∈ DI } ⊆ Rm ,
where DI ⊆ R is the domain for the thresholds associated with indicator I.

In fig. 1, we illustrate the trade-off curve C(x0 ,∆,tmin ,I) when the observed outcomes are m =
2, that is, P(x0 ,u) = (P1 (x0 ,u),P2 (x0 ,u)) with u = m(∆,tmin ,I,θ). In this figure, we use the
simplified notation P(x0 ,u) = (P1 (θ),P2 (θ)) ∈ R2 , for highlighting the dependence of the outcomes
on thresholds. In this curve, we represent two outcomes exhibiting a trade-off (i.e., greater value of
one outcome leads to a lower values of the other outcome).

3.2

Comparing event-triggered policies based on indicators

To compare the efficiency of two event-triggered feedbacks based on two different epidemiological
indicators Ia and Ib , we propose to compute the associated trade-off curves described in the previous
section. If the policies based on indicators Ia and Ib consider observation time windows ∆a and
∆b , respectively, and minimum interevent times tamin and tbmin , respectively, then we compare the
trade-off curves Ca = C(x0 ,∆a ,tamin ,Ia ) and Cb = C(x0 ,∆b ,tbmin ,Ib ) defined in (6).
Recall that the outcomes are represented by the function P : X × U −→ Rm , with m ≥ 2, and
the aim is to have the m outcomes P(x0 ,u) = (P1 (x0 ,u), . . . ,Pm (x0 ,u)) to be as low as possible.
Then, the calculation of the trade-off curves Ca and Cb , consists of the evaluation of function P for
event-triggered controls ua (θa ) = m(∆a ,tamin ,Ia ,θa ) and ub (θb ) = m(∆b ,tbmin ,Ib ,θb ) with different
values of thresholds θa and θb .
If a decision maker considers as objective (maximal bounds) the first m − 1 outcomes P̂1:m−1 =
11

a
b
(P̂1 , . . . , P̂m−1 ) (e.g., peak demand of ICU beds), the corresponding m-th outcomes Pm
and Pm

(e.g., total time of NPI) obtained using event-triggered feedbacks based on indicators Ia and Ib
can be computed such that
a
(P̂1:m−1 ,Pm
) ∈ Ca

and

b
(P̂1:m−1 ,Pm
) ∈ Cb .

Thus, the decision maker should consider the policy based on Ia or Ib comparing Pm
and Pm
decision depending on the given objective outcomes P̂1:m−1 . In fig. 2, we show two trade-off curves

for m = 2. In this figure, for small objective values of outcome P̂1 , it is better to use a policy based
on indicator Ib . Otherwise, for larger values of P̂1 , it is recommended to use a policy based on Ia .

If Pm
< Pm
for all objective outcomes P̂1:m−1 , it means that the curve Cb dominates curve Ca
and therefore, the policy based on Ib is always better. This situation is illustrated in fig. 3 for

Finding a control u ∈ U that minimizes the m outcomes given by the vector P(x0 ,u) =
(P1 (x0 ,u), . . . ,Pm (x0 ,u)) is evidently a multicriteria optimization problem. Therefore, we only
propose to compare single outcomes obtained from two policies when the other (m − 1) outcomes
are fixed and treated as objectives. This avoids the need to consider outcomes of different nature
and expressed in different units in a single objective function. On the other hand, to compare two
policies when several outcomes are simultaneously considered (i.e., not fixed) is technically possibly,
although it is not straightforward.

Case study: Metropolitan Region, Chile

For this example, we use a discrete-time compartmental model where the population of Metropolitan
Region, Chile (Santiago) N = 7,112,808 (according to the Chilean Institute of Statistics INE1 ),
assumed to be constant and isolated, is distributed into eight groups corresponding to different
disease stages. Susceptible (denoted by S) are individuals not infected by the disease but who
can be infected by the virus. Exposed (denoted by E) are those in the incubation time after

being infected. In this stage, they do not have symptoms but can infect other people with a
lower probability than those in the infectious group described below. Mild infected or subclinical
(denoted by I m ) is an infected population that can also infect other people. In this stage, they
are asymptomatic or show mild symptoms. They are not detected and thus are not reported by
authorities. At the end of this stage, they pass directly to the recovered state. Infected (denoted by
I) are infected citizens that can infect other people. They develop symptoms and are detected and
reported by authorities. They can recover or enter some hospitalized state. Recovered (denoted by
R) is a population that survives the illness, is no longer infectious, and has developed immunity
to the disease. Hospitalized (denoted by H) are patients hospitalized in basic facilities. After this
stage, hospitalized can recover or get worse and use an ICU bed or die. Hospitalized in ICU beds
(denoted by H c ) are patients in critical care. People in these two last stages may infect other people;
however, in our posterior analysis, we will neglect this source of infection because we assume that
hospitalized individuals are highly isolated. After leaving the ICU bed, they either come back to
the basic facilities in the hospital or die. The term dead (denoted by D) accounts for people who
did not survive the disease.
The evolution of the previous state variables is described by the following discrete-time system,
with states x = (S,E,I m ,I,R,H,H c ,D) ∈ X = R8+ :

The above system is a type of discrete-time SEIR (or SEIRHD) model. It aims to better describe
an outbreak where part of the population has been infected by a virus, with many people with no
symptoms or only mild symptoms. It was found that this is the case for SARS-CoV-2, as has
been reported in several papers in the literature [26, 32, 35]. The model we use can be extended
to consider age ranges and evaluate other indicators or policies such as the schools reopening or
the progressive lifting of quarantines according to age groups as explored in [54, 53]. However, to

14

illustrate the proposed methodology, we have only considered one age class.
The structure of this mathematical model, along with the transitions among the different stages,
is shown in fig. 4.

individuals (S), and different disease states: exposed (E), mild infected (I m ), infected (I), recovered
(R), hospitalized (H), hospitalized in ICU beds (H c ), and dead (D).
We proceed now to describe the main components of system (7). First, we consider the time
interval [[t0 : T ]], with days as the unit of time, where t0 is the initial time from which we start the
assessment of different policies (September 21, 2020) and T is the time horizon. In this example,
the time horizon is the simulation time and must be large enough for all of the considered policies
(NPI triggered by indicators) to be able to reduce the number of infected people to zero (September
15

21, 2025), without considering other interventions.
The contagion rate (see the first and second equation in (7)) is
Λ(x(t)) =

1
(βE E(t) + βI m I m (t) + βI I(t) + βH H(t) + βH c H c (t)),
(N − D(t))

where the specific rates βE , βI m , βI , βH , βH c can be written as the product of the contagion probref

abilities (pE , pI m , pI , pH , and pH c ) and the reference values of contact rates (cref
E , cI m , cI , cH ,
and cref
H c ), each value associated with a contagious stage of the disease (indicated in the subindex).
ref
ref
ref

Therefore, one has βE = pE cref
E , βI m = pI m cI m , βI = pI cI , βH = pH cH , and βH c = pH c cH c .
Our goal is to influence the contagion rate Λ(x(t)) with a control policy u(t), representing the
application of NPI, in this example, a lockdown, having as effect a reduction in the contact rates.
We denote by Λ̂(x(t),u(t)) the controlled contagion rate and we define controlled specific contagion
rates β̂E , β̂I m , β̂I , β̂H , β̂H c as follows

where u = (uE ,uI m ,uI ,uH ,uH c ) ∈ [0,1]5 is the initial vector of control variables that later will be
reduced.
ref
We shall assume that cref
H = cH c = 0 because we suppose that the hospitalized patients are highly
isolated. Therefore, uH and uH c are no longer considered as control variables. This approach is also
used in [33]. Additionally, we assume that the policy for the exposed and mild-infected individuals
is the same and thus uE = uI m , which will be denoted u for simplicity. This means that NPI have
the same effects (in terms of the contact rates reduction) for the people in the incubation stage
and for the infected population with mild symptoms because these populations are not detected, so
that NPI such as lockdowns are assumed to affect them similarly. Finally, we also assume that NPI
do not have additional effects in terms of the contact rates reduction, in the infected population
with symptoms (and then detected and reported by authorities) because we assume that these
individuals are already isolated. Thus, we set uI = 1 − δ̂ with δ̂ ∈ (0,1) representing the fraction
of nonisolated infected (detected) population. Our vector of control variables is then reduced to a

16

single input u ∈ [0,1] and the (controlled) contagion rate becomes
Λ̂(x(t),u(t)) =



1
(1 − u(t))(βE E(t) + βI m I m (t)) + δ̂βI I(t) .
(N − D(t))

(9)

Furthermore, we set 1 − δ̂ as the upper bound for the control variable, thus representing that
NPI cannot isolate people to a greater extent than the isolation already imposed on the infected
and detected population. Therefore, the single control variable u belongs to the control space
U = [0,1 − δ̂]. In the following, we set δ̂ = 0.2.
Now we can write the (autonomous) dynamics f : X × U −→ X, where the state space is
X = R8+ , defining the discrete-time control systems of this example as in (1) as follows

where the controlled contagion rate Λ̂(x,u) is given by (9). The rest of parameters defining the
above dynamics are described in appendix A where we describe the calibration procedure for this
example.
Now we describe the elements for defining the event-triggered controls introduced in section 2.2.
The considered observation time window and the minimum time of implementation (or minimum
interevent time) will be ∆ = tmin = 14 days. The event-triggering mechanism, as described in (2)
and (4), is defined by uref = 1 − δ̂ (associated with u(t0 ) in (2)) and as controllers û− , û+ : [[0 :

17

T − t0 ]] × U −→ U (see (4)), we consider max-linear functions of the form
û− (τ,u) =

û+ (τ,u) =

.

These controllers permit to monotonically decrease/increase the strength of the NPI in tmin days
until saturating it. We have decided to consider that our control saturates in tmin days, coinciding
with the minimum interevent time assuming that at the end of this period of time, the effect of NPI
(or their release) is fully accomplished, producing the maximal isolation (u = 1 − δ̂) or reaching the
normal contact rates equal to those before the pandemic (u = 0).
To define trigger indicators I : X∆+1 −→ R and then the event-triggered sets S, as in section 3,
we consider the following instantaneous observations of the state O : X −→ R:
(O1) Number of hospitalized people in ICU beds:
O(x(τ )) = H c (τ );
(O2) Number of active cases (infectious persons detected):
O(x(τ )) = I(τ ) + H(τ ) + H c (τ ).
As established in section 2.2, given an observation time window of ∆ = 14 days, the indicators
to be used are defined for the recent history of the state
x∆ (t) = (x(t − ∆), . . . ,x(t)) ∈ X∆+1 .
Thus, the indicators considered in this example are computed from the observations defined in (O1)
and (O2) as follows:
(a) the mean of instantaneous observations:
I(x∆ (t)) =

t

O(x(τ ));

(b) the mean of differences of instantaneous observations:

Thus, we will assess four indicators associated with two instantaneous observations (O1) and (O2)
and with two different ways to consider them (a) and (b).
Finally, to compare the performance of different event-triggered controls based on the indicators
introduced previously (as introduced in section 3.1 and section 3.2), we consider two outcomes, that
is, the function of outcomes P : X × U −→ R2 is given by P(x0 ,u) = (P1 (x0 ,u),P2 (x0 ,u)), where
the event-triggered control u is defined by u = m(∆,tmin ,I,θ), for a given trigger threshold θ, from
an initial state x0 at initial time t0 . The outcomes considered are:
(P 1) Peak of ICU demand:
P1 (x0 ,u) =

max

t0 ≤t≤T +1

H c (t);

(P 2) Total number of days in lockdown. This is expressed as a percentage (over the total simulation
time) and is computed differently depending on whether our NPI is applied at the initial time
t0 or not. If the NPI is applied at t0 , it is given by
k

P2 (x0 ,u) =

otherwise, we have
k

P2 (x0 ,u) =

u
100 X
(t2k+2 − t2k+1 ).
(T − t0 )

k=0

We note that in the above expressions, ku is the total number of the switches triggered by
the policy u.
For a given event-triggered feedback u = m(∆,tmin ,I,θ) we recall the definition of the trade-off
curve associated with indicator I, and parametrized by thresholds θ (see section 3.1)
C(x0 ,∆,tmin ,I) = {P(x0 ,u) | u = m(∆,tmin ,I,θ); θ ∈ DI } ⊆ R2 ,
where DI ⊆ R is the domain for the thresholds associated with indicator I. For the four indicators
considered here (two instantaneous observations (O1) and (O2) and two different ways to consider
them (a) and (b)) and the two introduced outcomes (P 1) and (P 2), the trade-off curves are depicted
in fig. 5.
It is observed from fig. 5 that the performance of the indicator corresponding to the mean of
hospitalized patients in ICU beds (observation (O1) considered as (a)), depicted by a blue dashed
curve, is the worst in comparison to the other indicators in the sense that its trade-off curve is above
the other curves; therefore, for any objective in the peak of ICU demand (outcome (P 1)), the use
of this indicator will imply more days in the lockdown (outcome (P 2)). The trade-off curves of the
other three indicators are quite similar. Nevertheless, the indicators based in the number of active

cases (based in observation (O2), depicted by continuous curves) in practice can be less reliable
that the indicator corresponding to the mean of the difference of the hospitalized patients in ICU
beds (based in observation (O1) considered as (b)) that is shown by the orange dashed curve.
In table 1, we present the associated threshold for each indicator, having as objective a peak of
ICU demand of P1 (x0 ,u) = 1,200 beds (see (P 1)). This value corresponds to an approximation of
the total ICU beds available during October 2020 for the Metropolitan Region according to Chilean
official data [20]. In this table, we also show the percentage of days in lockdown P2 (x0 ,u) (see (P 2))
associated with each indicators for the objective mentioned above.

disease: susceptible (S), exposed (E), infectious (I), infectious but undetected (Iu ), hospitalized
that will recover (HR ), hospitalized that will die (HD ), recovered after being detected (Rd ), and
recovered after being infectious but undetected (Ru ), and dead by COVID-19 (D). Thus, the vector
of the state variables is
x(t) = (S(t),E(t),I(t), Iu (t), HR (t), HD (t), Rd (t), Ru (t),D(t)) ∈ X = R9+ .
Since the model in [32] is established in continuous-time, we consider a very small time step
(one hour). Then, we use the standard Euler method to discretize the dynamics in [32] with a
step ∆t = 1/24 to obtain f : X × U −→ X as in (1). Thus, for this case-study, the (autonomous)
dynamics that define the discrete-time control systems are described by the following:

Here, the controlled contagion rate Λ̂(x,u) is given by
Λ̂(x(t),u(t)) =

where a single control variable u ∈ U = [0,1 − δ̂] has been considered. This control is associated
with the implementation of NPIs such as lockdowns. It multiplies all of the contagion rates (βE ,
βI , βIu , βHR and βHD ), because its main effect is to reduce the contact rates among all individuals.
Parameter δ̂ ∈ (0,1) represents the fraction of the population that reduces their contact rates
during a lockdown (or more generally the application of a given NPI). The latter is considered to
be different from zero because, even during lockdowns, some basic services must still operate. In
the following, we set δ̂ = 0.25.
The parameters defining the dynamics f : X × U −→ X in (11) are given by the vector
(β,γ,φ) ∈ R5+ ×R5+ ×[0,1]2 . Vector β = (βE , βI , βIu ,βHR , βHD ) ∈ R5+ contains all of the specific rates
associated with the contagious stages of the disease. Parameters γ = (γE , γI , γIu ,γHR ,γHD ) ∈ R5+
are the mean rates of the transition from these respective stages to the subsequent stage. In other
−1
words, for a disease stage X ∈ {E,I,Iu ,HR ,HD } parameter γX
days represents the mean duration

of stage X. Finally, the vector φ = (φIHR ,φIHD ) ∈ [0,1]2 allows us to describe the distribution from
infected people (I) to the next three stages: infected but undetected (Iu ), hospitalized that will
recover (HR ), and hospitalized that will die (HD ). Indeed, the fraction of infected people that are
not detected is given by 1 − φIHR − φIHD , while φIHR and φIHD represent the fraction passing from
infected to the hospitalized stages HR and HD , respectively. We note that in [32], both fractions
are equivalently written in terms of the case fatality ratio and of the fraction of infected people
that are detected. The values of (β,γ,φ) used in our simulations correspond to those used in [32]
for experiment EXP29M ; see Table 3 in [32].
Additionally, the initial conditions
x(t0 ) = (S0 ,E0 ,I0 , Iu 0 ,HR 0 , HD 0 , Rd 0 ,Ru 0 ,D0 ) ∈ X = R9+
were obtained from the calibration realized with the complete set of data available in [32], that is,
our initial condition vector x(t0 ) corresponds to the last day output (March 29, 2020) of the fitted
model in [32] for experiment EXP29M . These values are given in table 2.
It is important to note that a very strict lockdown was considered in the experiment EXP29M
in [32]. This explains the very low values obtained for the infected stages in table 2. Recall that
our initial time (t0 = March 29, 2020) corresponds to the final time in that experiment after the
application of the lockdowns.
Regarding the other elements necessary to pursue our analysis, the event-triggered controls
introduced in section 2.2 are defined similarly to those in section 4.1. Indeed, the considered

observation time window and the minimal time of implementation (or minimal interevent time)
will be ∆ = tmin = 14 days. The event-triggering mechanism described in (2) and (4) is defined by
uref = 1 − δ̂ (associated with u(t0 ) in (2)) and by controllers û− , û+ : [[0 : T − t0 ]] × U −→ U (see
(4)) that are considered as max-linear functions of the form

As in the previous case-study analyzed in section 4.1, our control saturates in tmin days, coinciding
with the minimum interevent time. Thus, we assume that at the end of this period of time, the
effect of NPI (or their release) is fully accomplished, producing maximal isolation (u = 1 − δ̂) or
reaching the normal contact rates equal to those prior to the pandemic (u = 0).
To define trigger indicators I : X∆+1 −→ R and then the event-triggered sets S (cf. section 3),
we also consider the following instantaneous observations of the state:
(Õ1) Number of hospitalized people:
O(x(τ )) = HR (τ ) + HD (τ );
(Õ2) Number of detected infectious people:
O(x(τ )) = I(τ ).
As established in section 2.2, given an observation time window of 14 days (i.e., ∆ = 14), the

23

indicators to be used are defined for the recent history of the state
x∆ (t) = (x(t − ∆), . . . ,x(t)) ∈ X∆+1 .
Thus, the indicators considered in this case-study are computed from observations defined in (Õ1)
and (Õ2) as follows:
(a) the mean of instantaneous observations:
I(x∆ (t)) =

Finally, for the assessment of the different event-triggered controls policies based on the indicators above, we apply the methodology described in section 3.1 and section 3.2. Thus, we consider
the function of outcomes P : X × U −→ R2 given by P(x0 ,u) = (P̃1 (x0 ,u),P̃2 (x0 ,u)), where the
event-triggered control u is defined by u = m(∆,tmin ,I,θ) (for a given trigger threshold θ, from
an initial state x0 at initial time t0 ), and the outcomes P̃1 (x0 ,u) and P̃2 (x0 ,u) are given by the
following:
(P̃ 1) Peak of hospitalization demand:
u
u
max (HR
(t) + HD
(t)),

P̃1 (x0 ,u) =

t0 ≤t≤T +1

u
u
where HR
(t) + HD
(t) corresponds to the total number of hospitalized patients at period t.

(P̃ 2) Total number of days of lockdown: This outcome was already defined in section 4.1, outcome
(P 2). For the sake of completeness, we recall its computation here:
If the NPI is applied at t0 , it reads as follows
k

P̃2 (x0 ,u) =

u
100 X
(t2k+1 − t2k )
(T − t0 )

k=0

otherwise, we have
k

P̃2 (x0 ,u) =

u
100 X
(t2k+2 − t2k+1 ).
(T − t0 )

k=0

24

We note that in the previous expressions, ku is the total number of the switches triggered by
the policy u.
Hence, the trade-off curves (see section 3.1)
C(x0 ,∆,tmin ,I) = {P(x0 ,u) | u = m(∆,tmin ,I,θ); θ ∈ DI } ⊆ R2 ,
for the four indicators introduced above (two instantaneous observations (Õ1) and (Õ2) and to the
two different ways to consider them (a) and (b)) are depicted in fig. 6.

Figure 6: Trade-off curve for our case-study based on [32] for the spread of COVID-19 in China.
Four indicators are considered: nmber of hospitalized people (observation (Õ1)) considering the
mean (indicator (a), blue dashed curve) and the mean of difference (indicator (b), orange dashed
curve) and the number of active cases (observation (Õ2)) considering the mean (indicator (a), blue
continuous curve) and the mean of difference (indicator (b), orange continuous curve).
fig. 6 shows that the 14-day rolling average of infected and detected people (observation (Õ2)
considered as (a)) is clearly the best indicator among the four analyzed indicators. The second best
indicator is the mean of total hospitalizations due to COVID-19 (observation (Õ1) considered as
(a)), but its performance is considerably weaker. For instance, when we consider an objective peak
hospitalization demand of 7 million of beds (that is, P̃1 (x0 ,u) = 7,000,000; see outcome (P̃ 1)), the
25

percentage of time in lockdowns (outcome (P̃ 2)) for the policies associated with each indicator is
given by P̃2 (x0 ,u) = 31% and 57%, respectively, over the total analyzed time. This demonstrates
the strong advantage of using a policy associated with the rolling average of infected people with
respect to the other analyzed indicators in this case. Therefore, our analysis suggest the use of this
indicator as the basis for an event-triggered policy for this case study.
In Table table 3 we show the percentage of the days in lockdown P̃2 (x0 ,u) (see (P̃ 2)) associated
with each indicator when the objective peak hospitalization demand is P̃1 (x0 ,u) = 7,000,000 beds
(see (P̃ 1)). We also present the associated thresholds θ for these four indicators.

Final remarks

In this work, we addressed two main goals: to propose a modeling framework for representing
the decision-making process related to the application of NPI policies based on the observation
of epidemiological indicators and to introduce a methodology to compare the effectiveness of these
strategies (defined by trigger indicators) with respect to multiple objectives outcomes. The proposed
framework is that of event-triggered controls with some specific details such as considering the state
in a window of time and imposing a minimum intervention time (or minimum interevent time). Both
features were introduced in order to represent the application of the NPIs more realistically.
The two case-studies discussed in section 4 show how our methodology can be used to recommend
an indicator-based policy when some given outcomes are treated as objectives in our analysis.
Nevertheless, our approach should be consider only as a guide to suggest a recommendation. In
practice, decision makers must also undertake a complementary and more in-depth analysis. For
instance, the observability of the indicators under analysis is something that must also be taken
into account. Indeed, when an indicator based on active cases has a similar performance to that of
another indicator based, for instance, on the number of hospitalized patients (as in the case-study
given in section 4.1), a possible recommendation is to consider a policy based on the second type

26

of indicator because the corresponding observations (hospitalized patients) are more reliable and,
consequently, the latter is a more robust NPI policy in practice.
As described in this article, our approach permits to represent the decision-making process based
on the observation of indicators and compare the use of these indicators to define NPI policies from a
cost-benefit perspective. This comparison will depend on the outcomes chosen as objectives and also
on the structure of the dynamic model and on the indicators chosen for this comparison. Both of the
latter mathematical objects are intrinsically related in the sense that the dynamics considered as a
basis in our methodology must allow the computation and simulation of the indicators that we seek
to compare in the analysis. Therefore, for assessment of more elaborate indicators such as positivity
rates, indicators associated with testing and contact tracing and effective reproduction number, it
is necessary to consider dynamical systems with compartmental stages that allows the formulation
of such indicators. On the other hand, our methodology was demonstrated for two SEIR-type
models that are some of the most common mathematical models in epidemiology. Nevertheless,
our methodology can also be adapted to other underlying mathematical models, such as agentbased models. Of course, different dynamics or other underlying mathematical models can lead to
different recommendations. However, this issue is inherent to any real-life decision derived from a
mathematical analysis.
The framework introduced in this paper for assessing indicators-based event-triggered policies
raises some interesting problems to study the further theoretical analysis of which can have important repercussions on the decision-making process. We mention three such problems:
• Time consistency: When the analysis introduced in section 3.2 for determining the best
indicator to use is carried out at time t0 , following the policy induced by this indicator, there
is no guarantee that this strategy will be the best in the long term. Since the trade-off curves
are dynamic objects because they depend on the initial conditions (see (6)), it is possible that
with time, another indicator should be chosen for triggering NPIs, because its performance is
better considering the future state as the initial condition.
In the terms of trade-off curves and the comparison process proposed in section 3.2, the
aforementioned situation occurs when two of these curves (the best chosen at t0 and other),
viewed as curves that evolve in time, intersect in a future time at the level (in the outcomes
space) corresponding to the m − 1 outcomes objectives for which the analysis was carried out
at time t0 . To prove that a future intersection between the trade-off curves will not occur will
clearly require us to assume certain properties of the dynamics and the compared indicators;
this is an interesting problem. A similar problem in the context of linear system where the
performance (i.e., our outcomes) is a quadratic cost, is studied in [5].
On the other hand, it is natural to consider situations where the outcomes objectives can
evolve in time. For instance, at time t0 the situation is analyzed considering a given ICU

27

maximal capacity but perhaps in some months, this capacity will be increased. In summary,
the comparison process of indicators-based event-triggered policies should be implemented
continuously across the evolution of the disease in the population, taking into account eventual
updating of objective outcomes by the decision makers. Due the latter and the dynamics
aspect of trade-off curves, with longer time it is possible that a discarded indicator will in fact
become the best indicator.
• Is it better to consider policies based on more indicators? In the analysis proposed
in this work, we have considered only policies based on a single indicator. That is, to consider
event-triggered sets S, defined in the space of the recent history of states X∆+1 , in the form
S = S(∆,I,θ) = {x∆ ∈ X∆+1 | I(x∆ ) ≤ θ},

(13)

where the indicator I : X∆+1 −→ R takes values in R and θ ∈ R is a threshold for this
indicator. Consideration of more indicators leads to the consideration of a vector-valued
function I : X∆+1 −→ Rp , with p ≥ 2, and the inequality I(x∆ ) ≤ θ in (13) with respect
to the componentwise order for a vector of thresholds θ ∈ Rp . We wonder if the question of
whether more indicators lead to better policies can be formulate as follows: If S(I, θ) ⊆ S(Ĩ, θ)
for all vector of threshold θ (in an appropriate domain) can one conclude that a policy based
on I is better than one based on Ĩ (or vice versa)?
For triggering NPIs it can be natural to consider various indicators, as in the examples cited
in the introductory section, motivated by the reliability (or the lack of) of observations for
making decisions. Nevertheless, assuming that all observations are reliables, it is not clear
that the addition of indicators for triggering the decisions will induce better policies from the
cost-effectiveness viewpoint.
• Stochastic analysis: The framework introduced in this work can be extended considering
stochastic dynamics and indicators. In this case, a possible additional outcome that can be
considered is the maximum probability of satisfying the other outcomes (seen as objectives),
and then the performance of different event-triggered policies can be assessed in terms of that
probability, considering the risk-aversion of the decision makers.
To considering stochastic dynamics, the estimated probabilities distributions of involved parameters can be take as one of the output given by the calibration procedure used in section 4.1
and mentioned in appendix A.
Perhaps using simple models (few state variables) it is possible to provide mathematical proofs
for the questions posed in the first two points of the previous list, that is, to ensure that the trade-off
curves do not intersect and to deduce when an indicator is better than others from the properties of
the event-triggered sets S corresponding to those indicators. Eventually the theoretical analysis can
28

be simpler considering feedbacks based only on the instantaneous observations and time-continuous
dynamics, a framework have purposefully avoided here because the measurability of the involved
functions merits a deeper analysis. The aforementioned problems are beyond the scope of this
paper; however, we plan to study them in future works.

A

Parameter description and calibration procedure of model
in section 4.1

The parameters of system (7) associated with dynamics f : X×U −→ X given by (10) are contained
in the vector (β,γ,φ) ∈ R3+ × R5+ × [0,1]5 , where β = (βE , βI m , βI ) ∈ R3+ is the vector of the specific
rates associated with contagious stages of the disease and that are involved in the definition of the
controlled contagion rate Λ̂(x(t),u(t)) given by (9).
Parameters γ = (γE , γI m , γI ,γH ,γH c ) ∈ R5+ are the mean rates of transition from the respective
−1
stages to the next stage. In other words, for a disease stage X ∈ {E,I m ,I,H,H c } parameter γX
days represents the mean duration of stage X.

The vector φ = (φEI ,φIR ,φHR ,φHD ,φH c D ) ∈ [0,1]5 contains different distribution fractions
between the different stages. Thus, φEI is the fraction of exposed people who become infected (with
symptoms), φIR is the fraction of infected people who recover, φHR is the fraction of hospitalized
(in normal services) people who recover, φHD is the fraction of hospitalized (in normal services)
people who die, and φH c D is the fraction of hospitalized people in ICU beds who die.
The parameters have been estimated using a Hamiltonian Markov chain Monte Carlo estimation
method using the Stan library [15]. The method is a Bayesian approach that allows the approximation of the probability densities for each of the parameters in the system when using a sufficient
number of iterations. We use the Gelman-Rubin (R̂) convergence diagnostic and 12 parallel chains
to ensure that the separate chains converge to the same values. R̂ compares the variance of each
chain to the pooled variance of all chains. Each of the parameters obtained an R̂ ≤ 1.03 where each
chain ran 10,000 iterations of which a half were warm-up.
For each of the parameters, we set upper and lower limits to restrict the parameter search space
to allow realistic combinations only. In addition, we used a weakly informative prior for each of the
parameters with mean values obtained from the literature and broad standard deviations.
In table 4, we state for each parameter its limits, prior probability distribution in the form of
a mean and standard deviation, and some references for the mean of the used prior distributions.
The model was trained on data from June 20, 2020, until September 20, 2020, in the Metropolitan
Region (Chile), considering the total number of COVID-19 cases (symptomatic), the number of
patients in ICU, and the number of deceased, according the information collected and published
by the Chilean Ministry of Science, Technology, Knowledge and Innovation in [20]. We assume an

29

independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) error of σ for all data points.
Since there are no data available of the asymptomatic population, we are not able to train the
trajectory of asymptomatic cases from E to I m and to R. That is, the parameters φEI and γI m are
not trained by maximizing the posterior, except for the small influence through βI m that is difficult
to distinguish from the other sources of contagion. To mitigate this, we will fix φEI = 0.6 where we
assume 60% of the infections to be symptomatic, following [44] and [16, Scenario 5: Current Best
Estimate].

Table 4: Parameter limits, priors, and mean and standard deviation following MCMC estimation.

The initial conditions x(t0 ) = (S0 ,E0 ,I0m ,I0 ,R0 ,H0 ,H0c ,D0 ) ∈ X = R8+ , have been estimated
using weakly informative priors where we take E0 , I0m , I0 , and H0 to have scaled Beta priors
between 0 and N with α = 1 and β = 4 (parameters of Beta distribution), where N = 7,112,808 is
the total population. For the initial number of hospitalized patients in ICU, deceased patients, and
total number of infections to date we assume a lognormal distribution with a standard deviation of
σ around the data. In this setup, S0 and R0 are free variable but we need to restrict at least one
of these variables to solve the system. We propose a rough estimate of R0 to be the total number
of infected patients to date plus the percentage that were mildly infected. Here, we assume that
the number of people that are currently infected, hospitalized, or deceased are small relative to the
total population. S0 then follows from S0 = N − E0 − I0m − I0 − H0 − H0c − R0 − D0 . The obtained
values of initial conditions are shown in table 5.
