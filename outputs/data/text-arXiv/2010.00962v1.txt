In response to the worldwide outbreak of the coronavirus disease COVID-19, a variety of nonpharmaceutical interventions such as face masks and social distancing
have been implemented. A careful assessment of the effects of such containment
strategies is required to avoid exceeding social and economical costs as well as a
dangerous “second wave” of the pandemic. In this work, we combine a recently developed dynamical density functional theory model and an extended SIRD model
with hysteresis to study effects of various measures and strategies using realistic parameters. Depending on intervention thresholds, a variety of phases with different
numbers of shutdowns and deaths are found. Spatiotemporal simulations provide
further insights into the dynamics of a second wave. Our results are of crucial
importance for public health policy.

Introduction
The rapid spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [1–3], has led governments across the globe
to impose severe restrictions on social life, typically denoted “shutdown” or “lockdown”. While
these have been found to be very effective in reducing the number of infections, they have also
been accompanied by high social and economical costs. Moreover, it can be expected that
infection numbers rise again after the shutdown has ended (“second wave”). Consequently, the
development of an effective containment strategy that avoids a collapse of both the economy
and the healthcare system and that takes into account the problem of multiple outbreaks is of
immense public interest.
For this reason, a significant amount of research is currently performed on the effects of
various nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) [3–8] and intervention strategies [3,8,9] on the
spread of infectious diseases. From a political perspective, the costs associated with different
containment measures make it necessary to obtain a detailed understanding of the benefits of
various strategies, the effectiveness of different combinations of NPIs, and of whether one type
of intervention can compensate for another one. Of particular importance is the question at
which stage social restrictions should be imposed and lifted in order to avoid multiple outbreaks
and a large number of deaths.
A useful theory for such investigations is the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model
developed by Kermack and McKendrick [10], which has been generalized in a large variety
of ways in order to incorporate, e.g., governmental interventions [11]. Recently [12], we
have proposed an extension of the SIR model based on dynamical density functional theory
(DDFT) [13–16] that incorporates social distancing in the form of a repulsive interaction potential. It allows to treat different types of NPIs separately and therefore provides more detailed
insights into containment strategies than the simple SIR model while being computationally
more efficient than individual-based models. A further recent development in SIR theory is the
description of adaptive containment strategies, which are relevant for the current pandemic [5],
using hysteresis loops [11, 17, 18].
In this work, we use the SIR-DDFT model and an extended susceptible-infected-recovereddead (SIRD) model with hysteresis to investigate the effects of various containment strategies
with model parameters adapted to the current COVID-19 outbreak in Germany. We compare
the effects of face masks and social distancing/isolation and of various threshold values (of the
number of infected persons) for imposing and lifting restrictions. Our simulations reveal the
existence of various phases with different numbers of outbreaks. This effect needs to be taken
into account when making political decisions on shutdown thresholds, as it can significantly
affect both the total length of the shutdowns and the number of deaths. Moreover, we show
that a second wave can also arise if only one type of restriction is lifted. Finally, it is found
that second waves tend to have a different spatial distribution than first waves, an effect that is a
current public health concern [19]. Our results thereby extend the work in Refs. [6–9], as they
are based on methods from statistical mechanics that allow for deeper insights. Moreover, we
2

break new ground in soft matter physics by developing a DDFT model with time- and historydependent interaction potential, leading to interesting novel dynamical behavior. This model
allows to test a large variety of shutdown strategies and their consequences for the “second
wave” using our freely available code [20].

Nonpharmaceutical interventions: Face masks vs social distancing
The most widely used theory for modeling disease outbreaks is the SIR model [10]. It assumes
that the population consists of three groups, namely susceptible (S), infected (I), and recovered
¯ where ceff is the effective trans(R) individuals. Susceptible persons are infected at a rate ceff I,
mission rate [21]. Infected persons recover at a rate w. Recovered persons are immune to the
disease. An extension is the SIRD model [22], in which infected persons die at a rate m. The
governing equations of the SIRD model are
¯
S̄˙ = −ceff S̄ I,
¯
I¯˙ = ceff S̄ I¯ − wI¯ − mI,

¯ from the number
We use overbars to distinguish, e.g., the total number of infected persons (I)
of infected persons per unit area (I). Due to its simplicity, the SIR(D) model has become very
popular and is used in modeling the current coronavirus outbreak, incorporating real data [7].
At present, it is not clear whether persons that have recovered from COVID-19 are immune
against it, but experiments on rhesus macaques have found that a SARS-CoV-2 infection induces protective immunity against rechallenge [23].
A drawback of the standard SIR(D) model is the fact that it does not include spatiotemporal
dynamics. Moreover, it does not allow to treat various types of NPIs, such as face masks and
social distancing, separately. This is possible in individual-based models, which, however, are
computationally very expensive. Therefore, an intermediate approach that combines the simplicity of the simple SIR model with the flexibility of individual-based models is very promising
in this context. Such an approach is given by the SIR-DDFT model developed in Ref. [12]. It
describes the densities S, I, and R of susceptible, infected, and recovered persons, respectively,
as fields on spacetime governed by the equations

with time t, mobility Γφ for field φ = S, I, R, free energy F , and transmission rate c. The free
energy F = Fid + Fexc + Fext consists of a term Fid describing noninteracting persons (“ideal
gas free energy”), a term Fexc for social interactions, i.e., social distancing and self-isolation of
infected persons, and a term Fext for an “external potential” describing, e.g., travel restrictions
(not considered in this work). In comparison to the SIR model, social distancing is therefore
incorporated explicitly, based on a microscopic model of individual persons staying away from
each other. The interaction strength is measured using two parameters Csd and Csi for social
distancing and self-isolation, respectively (which are negative if the interactions are repulsive).
This model is an extension of the reaction-diffusion SIR model, which has been found to give
accurate predictions for the spread of the Black Death in Europe [24]. Mathematical details on
the SIR-DDFT model are given in the supplementary materials. DDFT is reviewed in Ref. [16].
As discussed in Ref. [12], the transmission rate c should be distinguished from the effective
transmission rate ceff appearing in the standard SIR model: The former measures the transmission rate given contact, where the amount of contacts is determined by the interactions that
incorporate social distancing and self-isolation. On the other hand, the rate ceff depends on both
c and the number of contacts. Consequently, it is possible in the SIR-DDFT model (but not in
the SIR model) to treat these two factors separately.
This is an important advantage, since it allows to distinguish the effects of two of the main
NPIs that were implemented against the COVID-19 outbreak: Face masks and other hygiene
measures such as frequent hand washing reduce c, i.e., they decrease the probability of an
infection in case of contact. Repulsive interactions, on the other hand, reduce the number
of contacts. Hence, performing a parameter scan in c and the interaction strength allows to
distinguish the effects of the two types of measures, and thereby provides insights into the
question to which extent these can supplement or replace each other.
To obtain the phase diagram, we have solved the SIR-DDFT model (Eqs. (4)-(6)) numerically in two spatial dimensions with w = 0.125/d and m = 0.0007/d. These parameter values are adapted to the outbreak in Germany (see supplementary materials). Moreover, we set
ΓS = ΓI = ΓR = 1. We measure time in days (d) and everything else in dimensionless units.
Population numbers shown in the plots are normalized such that the initial total population size
is one. Details on the simulations can be found in the supplementary materials. The resulting
phase diagram, shown in Fig. 1, visualizes the dependence of the normalized maximal number
of infected persons I¯max,n on c and on the strength of the repulsive interactions1 Csd = 31 Csi . It
is found that both a reduction of c and an increase of |Csd | can decrease infection numbers. The
model exhibits three phases, which are characterized by low (no outbreak), intermediate (contained outbreak), and large (uncontained outbreak) infection numbers, respectively. Infection
numbers are small if c is below w (indicated by a green line in Fig. 1). The outbreak can be
(partially) contained by large values of |Csd | (even if c is also large) or by intermediate values of
c and Csd . Therefore, it is possible, to a certain extent, to reduce the amount of contact restrictions (i.e., to decrease |Csd |) without increasing the infection numbers if the transmission rate
1
We choose |Csi | > |Csd |, since people will keep a larger distance from infected than from non-infected
persons.

Fig. 1. Phase diagram for the SIR-DDFT model. The dependence of the normalized maximal
number of infected persons I¯max,n on the interaction strength Csd = 13 Csi and the transmission
rate c is shown. Three phases (uncontained, contained, and no outbreak) are found. A reduction
of contact restrictions (smaller |Csd |) can be compensated for by face masks/hygiene measures
(smaller c). The green line indicates the recovery rate w.
c is also reduced, which is possible by hygiene measures. Consequently, the model shows that
face masks allow to re-open a society after a shutdown in a controlled way. The way in which
the parameter c is changed by implementing face masks depends on their efficacy and on the
adherence in the population, a strong reduction of c is possible if both are large (see Ref. [25]
for a quantitative estimate of the effect of face masks).

Adaptive strategies and multiple outbreaks
Up to now, we have assumed that the mitigation measures are imposed in the same way at all
times, i.e., that the model parameters are constant. In practice, however, they will be imposed
and lifted in an adaptive fashion depending on whether infection numbers rise above or fall
below certain thresholds. Strategies of this form are of significant importance for the COVID19 outbreak [3, 5]. We now discuss how such approaches can be described mathematically,
starting with the simple SIRD model.
Let us assume that a shutdown is started once the number of infected persons is larger than
a threshold value I¯start , and stopped once it falls below a value I¯stop with I¯stop ≤ I¯start . Mathematically, this corresponds to a non-ideal relay operator (also called “rectangular hysteresis
loop” or “lazy switch”), which was incorporated into the SIR model by Chladná et al. [11].
Here, we extend the model from Ref. [11] by also taking into account the fact that the infection
5

rate will not jump immediately when a threshold is crossed, since a society requires some time
to implement restrictions. Thus, we assume that the effective transmission rate ceff converges
exponentially [21] to a value c1 or c0 in the presence or absence of interventions, respectively.
These considerations lead to the dynamical equation

I(t
Here, α is a constant parameter, and the form of Eq. (7) ensures a convergence to c0 or c1 , depending on the infection numbers and the history of the system. Usually, the initial condition
will be ceff (0) = c0 , since social distancing measures are not present at the beginning of an outbreak. As discussed in the supplementary materials, realistic parameter choices for the outbreak
in Germany (which we use for our simulations) are given by α = 0.206/d, c0 = 0.479/d, and
c1 = 0.105/d.
The political decision that has to be made then is the choice of I¯start and I¯stop , i.e., what the
infection numbers should be in order for a shutdown to be started and stopped, respectively. To
investigate this problem, we have solved Eqs. (1)-(3) and (7) numerically with parameter values
w = 0.125/d and m = 0.0007/d for different values of I¯start and I¯stop in order to obtain the phase
diagrams2 . Details on the simulations can be found in the supplementary materials. We adapted
the values of w and m to the current COVID-19 pandemic (see supplementary materials). As
an initial condition, we have used the number of confirmed infections in Germany at the 10th
of March 2020 (reported in Ref. [26] to be 1296) normalized by the population of Germany.
The results are shown in Fig. 2, visualizing (A) the normalized maximal number of infected
persons I¯max,n , (B) the normalized number of susceptibles S̄∞,n at the end of the pandemic (i.e.,
the number of persons that have never been infected), and (C) the normalized total number of
deaths D̄∞,n . As can be seen from Fig. 2A, the maximal peak I¯max,n depends only on I¯start .
Hence, for avoiding a large number of infected persons at the same time and thus a collapse
of the healthcare system, it is primarily important to start the shutdown sufficiently early. The
point at which it is lifted again is less relevant. This observation is in agreement with results
from Ref. [5].
A different and much more complex result is found when considering the final number of
susceptibles S̄∞,n and the total number of deaths D̄∞,n . Here, various distinct phases can be
observed, which have a staircase-shaped boundary that depends on both I¯start and I¯stop . As can
be expected, large values of S̄∞,n correspond to small values of D̄∞,n and vice versa (if fewer
people are infected, fewer people die). For large values of I¯start (i.e., in the phase on the right),
the number of deaths is large. However, within each phase, the number of deaths increases
Note that the values of I¯start (4-8%) and I¯stop (1-3.5%) in the phase diagrams are rather large to ensure that
the behavior is more clearly visible. We have verified that different phases also exist for smaller threshold values.

upon reducing I¯start at fixed I¯stop . This is a remarkable and surprising result, since one would
intuitively expect a smaller shutdown threshold to be beneficial. When reducing I¯stop at fixed
I¯start within a phase, the number of deaths becomes smaller, although it jumps to a larger value
if a phase boundary is crossed from above.
An explanation for the complexity of the phase diagrams can be found in Figs. 2D, 2E, and
2F, which show the number of waves3 of the pandemic Nwaves , the number of shutdowns Nshut ,
and the total shutdown time tshut as a function of I¯start and I¯stop . The difference between the
various phases in Figs. 2B and 2C is the number of shutdowns Nshut . Increasing I¯stop at fixed
I¯start leads to a larger number of waves and shutdowns and a reduced total shutdown time (in
agreement with Ref. [3], where I¯start and I¯stop were not distinguished). However, increasing
I¯start at fixed I¯stop reduces Nwaves and Nshut .
Finally, a very interesting observation is that the phase boundaries for Nwaves and Nshut are
not at the same positions. While a larger number of shutdowns generally corresponds to a larger
number of waves, reducing I¯start below the critical value for n shutdowns (with n ∈ N) does not
immediately lead to n + 1 waves because the critical value of I¯start for n + 1 waves is slightly
smaller. Since it is, as far as the number of deaths is concerned, beneficial to be slightly below
the critical value of I¯start separating regions with n and n − 1 shutdowns, choosing I¯start in such
a way that the wave n + 1 is avoided needs careful adjustment. This requires, of course, that
one is aware of the difference between the phase boundaries for Nwaves and Nshut , which makes
our results highly relevant for political decisions on shutdown thresholds.
¯ R̄, D̄, and ceff are shown for different combinaIn Figs. 2G-2J, the time evolutions of S̄, I,
tions of I¯start and I¯stop . Shutdown periods are shaded in yellow. Figure 2G, corresponding to
I¯start = 6.5% and I¯stop = 1%, shows two shutdowns. After the first shutdown, which is longer,
infection numbers rise again (“second wave”), such that a second shutdown is necessary. A
third wave after the second shutdown is not observed. As can be seen from Figs. 2D and 2E,
I¯start = 6.5% and I¯stop = 1% corresponds to a choice of parameters between the phase boundaries for Nwaves and Nshut . In Fig. 2H, results for the same I¯stop = 1% and smaller I¯start = 4.5%
are shown. Although these parameters also lead to two shutdowns, a third wave of the pandemic
is observed here after the second shutdown. Therefore, the final number of deaths D̄∞,n is larger
in this case. Figure 2I shows the time evolution for I¯start = 6.5% and I¯stop = 3.5%, i.e., I¯stop
is increased at fixed I¯start compared to Fig. 2G. Here, the two shutdowns are shorter and closer
to each other, and D̄∞,n is larger than in Fig. 2G. A third wave is also observed. Finally, Fig.
2J gives results for I¯start = 7.5% and I¯stop = 1%, i.e., I¯stop is the same as in Figs. 2G and 2H,
but I¯start is increased into the region with Nshut = 1. Consequently, there is only one shutdown.
After it ends, a relatively large second wave occurs, leading to a relatively high overall number
of deaths.
Our results have important consequences for political decisions on intervention strategies.
Of course, the best strategy for keeping both I¯max,n and D̄∞,n small is to start the shutdown early
and stop it late (bottom left corner of the phase diagram). However, this is not always possible

The number of waves is measured by the number of local maxima of the function I(t).

due to the social and economical costs associated with a shutdown (as can be seen in Fig. 2F,
the total shutdown time tshut is very long in this case). In practice, a political decision has to be
made regarding the question when to start and end a shutdown given limited resources.
When making a political decision on when to start and end shutdown (choosing I¯start and
¯
Istop ), one needs to take into account the existence of the various phases shown in Fig. 2. A small
variation of the threshold values can lead to a different phase, which changes the number of
outbreaks and shutdowns and thus significantly affects the total number of deaths. The optimal
strategy depends on what one is aiming for:
• If the main goal is to keep I¯max,n small to avoid a collapse of the healthcare system, one
should start the shutdown early (small I¯start ).
• As far as D̄∞,n is concerned, it is beneficial to choose I¯start and I¯stop close to a phase
boundary in such a way that a slight increase of I¯start or decrease of I¯stop would reduce
the number of shutdowns by one.
• The choice of I¯stop also corresponds to a trade-off between D̄∞,n and tshut . Increasing it
within a phase at constant I¯start leads to a larger number of deaths and a shorter shutdown
time.
• Remarkably, strategies with multiple shutdowns can have advantages over strategies with
a single shutdown. While in many cases more shutdowns correspond to more waves, an
additional wave can be avoided after a further shutdown if the threshold values are chosen
close to a phase boundary.

The “second wave” in spatiotemporal dynamics
In practice, contact restrictions will typically be removed earlier than hygiene requirements
such as face masks if infection numbers decrease. Consequently, more detailed insights can be
gained using the SIR-DDFT model, in which effects of face masks and contact restrictions can
(as shown in Fig. 1) be modeled separately. For this purpose, we introduce a dynamic equation
for the interaction strength in the form

contact restrictions are imposed and removed depending on infection numbers while no change
regarding measures such as face masks is made. Investigating the SIR-DDFT model with a
dynamic interaction strength is of significant interest not only for disease spreading, but also for
condensed matter physics, since it corresponds to a DDFT with a time-dependent interaction
potential. Theories of this form are yet to be investigated and can therefore be expected to
exhibit a variety of novel and interesting effects.
To study the effects of dynamic interaction strengths, we have solved Eqs. (4)-(6) and (8)
numerically in two spatial dimensions with ΓS = ΓI = ΓR = 1, c = 0.479/d, w = 0.125/d,
m = 0.0007/d, α = 0.206/d, Csd,0 = Csd,1 = −1, Csi,0 = −1, and Csi,1 = −15. Details on
the simulations and the choice of parameters can be found in the supplementary materials. The
results are shown in Fig. 3. Simulations have been performed for I¯start = 6% and I¯start = 7%,

10

with I¯stop = 1% for both cases. The resulting time evolutions, shown in Fig. 3A, are reminiscent
of the results for the simpler model (Figs. 2G-2J). In both cases, a second wave of the pandemic
is observed after the first shutdown. For I¯start = 6%, a second shutdown is initiated to inhibit
the second outbreak, whereas no second shutdown is observed for I¯start = 7%. The simulation
results thereby confirm the observations from the simpler model. However, they also add to
it an important new aspect: A second wave can also occur if, after a shutdown, only contact
restrictions are lifted while other measures are kept in place (constant c).
An effect of this type was observed in Germany: While face masks are still mandatory in
public places (constant c), contact restrictions have been relaxed after the initial shutdown. In
consequence, infection numbers have risen again [27]. The extended SIR-DDFT model allows
for a detailed investigation of a variety of shutdown strategies by adapting the values of the
model parameters. In Fig. 3, we have chosen c in such a way that it allows to recover the effective reproduction number measured in Germany in early March 2020 (corresponding to an infrequent use of face masks). The choice Csd,0 = Csi,0 = −1 corresponds to the assumption that
there is moderate social distancing in the no-shutdown phase that does not distinguish between
healthy and infected persons (which can arise if infected persons cannot be easily identified as
such, as it is the case for COVID-19 [4,28]). In the case of a shutdown, a strong increase of |Csi |
(large value of |Csi,1 |) then reflects both an increased amount of testing (allowing for a specific
isolation of infected persons) and stronger physical isolation. Other possible scenarios include
a lower value of c (increased use of face masks), larger values of |Csd,0 | and |Csi,0 | (stricter
social distancing in the no-shutdown phase), and larger values of |Csd,1 | and |Csi,1 | with smaller
ratio Csi,1 /Csd,1 (strict physical distancing in the shutdown phase without testing). Hence, the
extended SIR-DDFT model is a flexible and useful tool for analyzing under which conditions
and in which way a second wave will occur for a certain combination of measures. Using our
freely available code [20], simulations can be easily performed for any policy the consequences
of which one wishes to investigate.
Snapshots from the time evolution of the density I(x, y, t) of infected persons as a function
of position ~r = (x, y)T are shown in Fig. 3B for I¯start = 6% and I¯start = 7%. The complete time
evolutions are shown in the supplementary movies S1 and S2. Initially, the infected persons are
concentrated in the middle of the domain and spread outwards radially (t = 5 d). Afterwards
(at t = 35 d), a phase separation effect is observed where the infected persons arrange into
separated spots. This pattern formation, which was discussed in Ref. [12], can be interpreted
as infected persons self-isolating at their houses. When the shutdown ends, the strength of
the interactions is reduced such that phase separation is no longer present (t = 65 d). For
I¯start = 6% (but not for I¯start = 7%), phase separation is observed a second time at t = 95 d
during a second shutdown. The second phase separation differs from the first one in that it
emerges from a distribution that is already rather homogeneous and not from an accumulation
of infected persons in the middle. Finally, at t = 125 d, there are almost no infected persons left
in both simulations.
These findings are very interesting for public health policy, since they show that the first
¯ and R̄ – the only aspect that
and second wave do not only differ by the initial values for S̄, I,
11

can be captured in the simpler model – but also by their different spatial distributions. This can
be seen when comparing the distributions at t = 5 d and t = 65 d, which represent the initial
stages of the first and second wave, respectively. The first wave starts after a radial spread
from the center, i.e., the infection is initially localized. Before the second wave, however,
the disease has already spread over the entire area. This difference is also relevant for the
current spread of COVID-19 in Germany: The first wave was a consequence of infected persons
arriving by travel, and therefore started at isolated positions. In contrast, the second wave
emerges from a more homogeneous spatial distribution [19]. From our model, this can be
expected to be a common feature of second waves. Initially, a disease will always break out
at single spots, which corresponds to an inhomogeneous initial condition I(~r, 0). If contact
restrictions (repulsive interactions) are lifted, the SIR-DDFT model describes a purely diffusive
dynamics that typically leads to a homogeneous distribution. Therefore, the initial condition for
the second wave is more homogeneous than for the first one. On the other hand, as can be seen
from Fig. 3A, the overall infection numbers are smaller for the second wave. The snapshot for
t = 95 d in the bottom row of Fig. 3B shows that phase separation does not occur at the center,
where the concentration of infected persons is lower at t = 65 d (initial stage of the second
wave). Physically, this corresponds to a shutdown that is locally restricted as a consequence of
infection numbers becoming large only in certain regions.

Discussion
In summary, we have employed the SIR-DDFT model and an extended SIRD model with hysteresis to study the effects of different containment strategies. We have found that lifting contact
restrictions can be partially compensated for by stricter hygiene measures. Investigating adaptive strategies showed that different combinations of thresholds lead to various phases. They
differ by the number of waves and shutdowns and, consequently, by the number of deaths
and the total shutdown time, making this effect immensely important for public health policy.
Spatiotemporal simulations have revealed that a second wave can also arise if only contact restrictions are lifted, and that it tends to have a different spatial distribution than the first wave.
By adapting parameter values, the model allows to study the effects of a large variety of containment strategies in any country. Possible extensions of this work include the investigation
of further strategies, such as partial shutdowns or isolation of specific groups. Moreover, the
SIR-DDFT model could be extended to include vaccination [29].

Mathematical details of the SIR-DDFT model
Here, we describe the SIR-DDFT model following Ref. [12]. Dynamical density functional
theory (DDFT), reviewed in Ref. [16], describes the time evolution of a density field ρ(~r, t).
For a single-component fluid, it is given by


δF
~
~
(S1)
∂t ρ = Γ∇ · ρ∇
δρ
with a mobility Γ and a free energy F . Equation (S1) can be derived from the microscopic
dynamics of overdamped Brownian particles using the adiabatic approximation, which approximates the pair correlations of the nonequilibrium system by those of an equilibrium system
with the same one-body density [14]. In the case of multiple fields {ρi }, Eq. (S1) generalizes to


δF
~ · ρi ∇
~
∂t ρi = Γi ∇
.
(S2)
δρi
In our present work, the fields are given by S, I, and R (density of susceptible, infected, and
recovered persons, respectively). In addition, we need to add reaction terms to the DDFT equation (S2) (as done, with other physical motivations, in Refs. [30, 31]), since the “particles” can
change their species, i.e., persons can get infected or recover. The reaction terms are obtained
from the SIRD model. This leads to the model

The free energy F has three terms:
F = Fid + Fexc + Fext .

describes a system of noninteracting particles with the rescaled inverse temperature β, number
of spatial dimensions d, and thermal de Broglie wavelength Λ. In the case F = Fid , Eq. (S1)
simply gives the standard diffusion equation
~ 2ρ
∂t ρ = D ∇

(S8)

with D = Γβ −1 . The term Fext describes the influence of an external potential and is set
to zero throughout this work. Finally, the excess free energy Fexc describes interactions. It
is not known exactly and needs to be approximated. In our case, the interactions are social
interactions such as social distancing and self-isolation. The basic idea is that persons practicing
social distancing can be described as repulsively interacting particles [32]. We assume that the
repulsive interactions can be described by a soft (Gaussian) pair potential. The reason for this
is that, even in the case of social distancing, there will still be a certain (although reduced)
amount of contact. Hence, soft potentials are more appropriate than hard-core interactions. For
interaction potentials as chosen here, the mean-field approximation

Choice of parameter values
The parameters for the simulations presented in the main text have been chosen in such a way
that their order of magnitude is realistic for the current COVID-19 outbreak in Germany. We
use days d as the unit of time and dimensionless units for all other quantities. For Germany, the
effective reproduction number Reff , which in our model is given by [12]
Reff =

ceff S̄
,
w

(S18)

is estimated by the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), the central public health institute of the German
federal government, on a daily basis. If we assume S̄ ≈ N = 1 with the total population size
N , we get
ceff (t)
Reff (t) =
.
(S19)
w
From Eq. (7) of the main text, we can infer that the approach of Reff (t) to its shutdown value
will be governed by a function of the form
Reff (t) = Reff,0 e−αt + Reff,1

(S20)

with Reff,0 = (c0 − c1 )/w and Reff,1 = c1 /w. As shown in Fig. S1, choosing Reff,0 = 2.99,
Reff,1 = 0.838, and α = 0.206/d gives a good agreement with empirical data. Furthermore, we
assume w = 0.125/d, which is consistent with the mean infection duration of 8 days reported in
Ref. [7]. From this, we can infer c0 ≈ 0.479/d and c1 ≈ 0.105/d.
Moreover, we assume following Ref. [35] that the probability of dying from COVID-19 in
the case of available intensive care is pd = 0.005625. This result is given by the probability of
hospitalization (0.045) multiplied by the probability of requiring intensive care given hospitalization (0.25) multiplied by the probability of dying during intensive care (0.5), which results
in pd = 0.045 × 0.25 × 0.5 = 0.005625. Given the probability pd of dying during time T , we
can obtain the death rate m (which is needed for the SIRD model) as [36]
m=−

1
ln(1 − pd ).
T

(S21)

Assuming that persons are infected for T = 8 d and die at a constant rate during this time
(which, of course, is a strong simplification) gives m ≈ 0.0007/d.

Fig. S1. Comparison of the function (S20) for the time evolution of the effective reproduction
number Reff with data from the Robert Koch Institute [34] (Interval: 03-10-2020 to 05-182020). The error bars of the data points are smaller than the data points. Oscillations in the
empirical data arise from differences in reported case numbers between different days of the
week.
For the extended SIR-DDFT model, the same parameter values for w, m, and α can be
used. The parameter c of the SIR-DDFT model is not identical to the parameter ceff of the SIR
model, which is why we discuss here how the value of c can be obtained (which is important
for practical applications of the SIR-DDFT model also to regions other than Germany). In the
simplest case of a homogeneous distribution of the population, the relation between c and ceff is
given by c = ceff A with the domain area A [12]. In this work, we use A = 100. If we set the
total population size to N = 100 and assume S̄ ≈ N , Eq. (S18) gives
Reff ≈

c
cN

w

(S22)

Comparing Eqs. (S19) and (S22) shows that the value used for ceff (0) can also be used for
c under the approximation ceff (0) = c/A if the population size is set to A rather than to 1.
In particular, using c ≈ 0.479/d in the spatiotemporal simulations allows to recover, in the
limiting case of a completely homogeneous distribution, the value of Reff that corresponds to
the values measured in Germany in early March 2020 (inserting c = 0.479/d into Eq. (S22)
gives Reff = 3.832, which is approximately equal to the result Reff (0) = 3.828 obtained from
Eq. (S20)).

Numerical analysis
The simulations for Figs. 1 and 3 have been performed in two spatial dimensions on a quadratic
domain [−L/2, L/2] × [−L/2, L/2] with size L = 10 and periodic boundary conditions. We
have solved the equations of the SIR-DDFT model using an explicit finite-difference scheme
with spatial step size dx = 0.04 for Fig. 1 and dx = 0.01 for Fig. 3 and adaptive time steps.
The shutdown state was updated explicitly every 0.01 d. As an initial condition, we have used
a Gaussian distribution with amplitude ≈ 7.964 and variance L2 /50 centered at (x, y) = (0, 0)

for S(x, y, 0), I(x, y, 0) = 0.001S(x, y, 0), and R(x, y, 0) = 0, such that the mean overall
density was 1. Regarding parameter values not specified in the main text, we have set DS =
DI = DR = 0.01 and σsd = σsi = 100. The simulations for Fig. 2 were also solved via an
explicit finite-difference scheme with adaptive time steps, while the shutdown state was updated
