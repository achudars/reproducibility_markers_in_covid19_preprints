Abstract
In the wake of the 2020 COVID-19 epidemic, much work has been performed on the development of mathematical models for the simulation of the epidemic, and of disease models
generally. Most works follow the susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) compartmental framework,
modeling the epidemic with a system of ordinary differential equations. Alternative formulations
using a partial differential equation (PDE) to incorporate both spatial and temporal resolution
have also been introduced, with their numerical results showing potentially powerful descriptive
and predictive capacity. In the present work, we introduce a new variation to such models by
using delay differential equations (DDEs). The dynamics of many infectious diseases, including COVID-19, exhibit delays due to incubation periods and related phenomena. Accordingly,
DDE models allow for a natural representation of the problem dynamics, in addition to offering
advantages in terms of computational time and modeling, as they eliminate the need for additional, difficult-to-estimate, compartments (such as exposed individuals) to incorporate time
delays. In the present work, we introduce a DDE epidemic model in both an ordinary- and
partial differential equation framework. We present a series of mathematical results assessing
the stability of the formulation. We then perform several numerical experiments, validating
both the mathematical results and establishing model’s ability to reproduce measured data on
realistic problems.

Keywords: Delay differential equations, partial differential equations, epidemiology, compartmental models, COVID-19, stability analysis.

Introduction

The worldwide outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020 has caused unprecedented disruption, leading to
massive damage in terms of both economic cost and human lives. Much of the economic damage
in particular has been due to government efforts designed to retard the spread of the disease; while
undoubtedly effective, the cost of such measures is enormous. In recent months, much research
has focused on the mathematical modeling of the epidemic, and of epidemics generally, in the hope
that such models may ultimately prove useful to decision-makers, and help to inform more targeted,
less-disruptive interventions.
Many modeling approaches have been proposed, with some combining differential equations
and empirical approaches in order to evaluate the effectiveness of various social-distancing measures
1

[7, 9, 10, 19]. In order to incorporate spatial variation across different regions, many of these models
discretize various regions along geopolitical (or similar) lines, using a network structure to represent
movement between the populations in different areas [10, 9, 19].
In contrast to these approaches, in [26, 27, 15, 11, 3, 12], the authors instead modeled the spatial
diffusion of the disease using partial differential equation (PDE) models. The implemented models
followed the compartmental framework, but also incorporated nonlinear heterogeneous diffusion
terms, giving a reaction-diffusion system of equations. While the computational cost of such an
approach is much higher than an ODE model, different numerical experiments showed that this
approach carries several advantages. Notably, the timing of different dynamics across different
areas can be resolved in a continuous manner, offering a richer description of the spatiotemporal
evolution.
In the following, we propose an alternative formulation of the model introduced in [26] and analyzed further and extended in [27, 15, 11, 3]. In particular, we seek to model many of the dynamics,
and in particular the incubation period, with a delay differential equation model. Ordinary delay
differential equation models have been extensively used for the study of epidemics, as well other
types of biological models, such as predator-prey equations [20, 17, 2, 8, 14, 13]. Delayed models
using partial differential equation (PDE) to study epidemics have been discussed and analyzed in
e.g. [25, 23, 29, 28, 6, 30]. Many of these works are restricted to mathematical analysis, though
simple numerical tests were also carried out in [30, 23]. A delay PDE simulation of a realistic
problem over a nontrivial geometry has not, to the authors’ knowledge, been carried out.
There are several advantages in using a delay formulation rather than the system shown in [26].
Notably, the exposed compartment, responsible for the incubation period, may be elimated without
losing the relevant dynamics. For a PDE model in which problem size is relevant, obtaining the
same dynamics with fewer compartments is desirable. However, we do not expect that the dynamics
are exactly the same; we believe in fact that the delay-equation formulation may better capture the
“lag” effect incurred by the introduction of new measures (as seen during the COVID-19 pandemic),
in which there is a delay of several days between the introduction of a new public health ordinance
and when its effects are fist observed. These lags may also change depending on the epidemic
stage, leading to state-dependent delays. Though we will not examine such a case here, a thorough
understanding of the constant-delay case is necessary first and is the objective of the present work.
Such a formulation is also interesting from the mathematical and computational point of view, and
examining such a model is worthwhile, we believe, in and of itself.
This paper is outlined as follows. We begin by recalling the model shown in [26], along with
some of its basic properties and notation. We will then proceed to introduce the delay-equation
formulation of the model for both ordinary and partial differential equation variants, highlighting
important points of difference. Following this introduction, we will present several mathematical
results of the delay-differential equation models including the equilibria solutions and a stability
analysis. We will then perform a series of numerical examples using the ODE and an idealized 1D
problem for the PDE (inspired by [27, 11]) to qualitatively analyze the model behavior and confirm
the mathematical results. We finish our numerical tests with a simulation over the Italian region
of Lombardy using real data, in order to validate the model’s ability to reproduce real-life data on
realistic problems, before concluding with several suggestions for future research in this area.

Model

The COVID-19 PDE model presented in [26] and further analyzed and extended in [3, 27, 15, 11, 12]
reads:
∂t s = αn − (1 − A/n) βi si − (1 − A/n) βe se − µs + ∇ · (n νs ∇s)

(1)

∂t e = (1 − A/n) βi si + (1 − A/n) βe se − σe − φe e − µe + ∇ · (n νe ∇e)

(2)

∂t i = σe − φd i − φr i − µi + ∇ · (n νi ∇i)

(3)

∂t r = φr i + φe e − µr + ∇ · (n νr ∇r)

(4)

∂t d = φd i,

(5)

while a similar ODE variant, neglecting diffusion, reads:
ṡ = αn − βi si − βe se − µs

(6)

ė = βi si + βe se − σe − φe e − µe

(7)

i̇ = σe − φd i − φr i − µi

(8)

ṙ = φr i + φe e − µr
d˙ = φd i.

(9)
(10)

The mechanism of the model is diagrammed in Fig. 1 and operates in the following way: the
susceptible population s is exposed to the disease by contact with exposed individuals in compartment e or infected patients in compartment i at rates βe and βi , respectively. After an incubation
3

period σ, exposed individuals develop symptoms and move to the infected subgroup i. A fraction
of symptomatic patients recover at a rate φr , moving into the recovered subgroup r. However, the
remaining infected patients eventually die at a rate φd . The model also features asymptomatic
transmission, which has been considered a key driving force in the COVID-19 pandemic. To this
end, we include a fraction of the exposed population e that directly moves to the recovered subgroup
r, without ever entering in the symptomatic infected compartment i. Note that:
n=s+e+i+r

(11)

denotes the entire living population.
We briefly make a few additional remarks regarding this model. The first is that this model
operates on the principle of mass-action, with the contact terms βi,e non-normalized and hence
dependent on local population densities, reflected in their units of 1/(Time·Persons) [27, 11, 22, 21,
12]. The spatial dependence of contagion is further augmented by the addition of the Allee term
A, which accounts for the tendency of COVID-19 cases to cluster in areas where n >> A. This
term has been used extensively in other settings, with the form used above inspired directly by
applications in cancer modeling [16, 4]. The Allee term works to reduce transmission in areas where
the population density is under a given threshold A, by bringing the population in the exposed
compartment to the susceptible compartment. Consequently, in such areas, the population in
compartments e and i tends to zero, eventually cancelling out the transfer term. We observe that
as s, i, and e are all less than n by definition, we do not expect blowup of this term, even for very
small n. We note that the Allee term does not appear in the ODE model (6)-(10). While one may
technically include it, the lack of spatial variation in population density limits its usefulness from
the modeling point of view, and conceptually its inclusion only makes sense in the PDE model
(1)-(5) for this reason. The diffusion terms in (1)-(5) are weighted by living population n, as the
model hypothesizes that diffusion of individuals is not homogeneous, but preferential and directly
proportional to the population.
This model was shown in [26] to exhibit reasonably good agreement with measured data for
the region of Lombardy, Italy, with later works [3, 15, 12] showing good agreement in other regions.
Further numerical and mathematical aspects were investigated in [27], where it was also shown
that models of this type can be put in the framework of continuum mechanics, and interpreted
a balance of forces. Although the model demonstrates acceptable agreement with reality and
operates under sound physical assumptions, it relies extensively on unknown data. In particular,
the exposed compartment (which also corresponds to the asymptomatic compartment) e is difficult,
if not impossible, to quantify with accuracy. We therefore propose the following modified model,
which uses a delay differential equation (DDE) formulation:

(14)

∂t d(t) = φd i(t − σ).

(15)

The corresponding ODE version of (12)-(15) reads:
ṡ(t) = αn(t) − βe s(t)i(t) − βi s(t)i(t − σ) − µs(t)

(16)

i̇(t) = βe s(t)i(t) + βi s(t)i(t − σ) − φd i(t − σ) − φr i(t − σ) − µi(t)

(17)

ṙ(t) = φr i(t − σ) − µr(t)
˙ = φd i(t − σ).
d(t)

(18)
(19)

We acknowledge a slight abuse of notation as, strictly speaking, σ is the inverse of the corresponding
value in system (1)-(5), (6)-(10). In general, the delay may be state-dependent; however, for
the current work, we will assume that they are constant in order to simplify our analysis and
computations. Note also that the definition of n is now:
n = s + i + r.

(20)

As one may observe, the first major difference between the systems (1)-(5) and (12)-(15) is
in the influence of the incubation period. Rather than include the exposed compartment e, the
incubation period is incorporated into the system as a delay term on the infected compartment.
A result of this choice is that in (12)-(15), asymptomatic individuals are no longer specifically
accounted for; all infected persons are considered equally. For the specific case of COVID-19, this
may be a more reasonable assumption at this point in time, as testing protocols have improved and
larger portions of asympomatic patients are now detected [18, 24].
The second major difference between (1)-(5) and (12)-(15) is the evolution of the recovered
compartment r and deceased compartment d. As formulated in (1)-(5), all members of the infected
compartment i are equally likely to die or recover at the same time; it does not make any distinction
on these patients based on time of infection. In contrast, the recovery and mortality rates in (12)(14) are delay-dependent, evolve according to the infected population at a previous point in time.
This is a more realistic representation of epidemic dynamics, and may be useful when considering
the allocation of public health resources.

2.1

Relationship between the PDE and ODE

The presented delayed PDE model (12)-(15) and ODE model (16)-(19) are related, since they are
used to describe the same phenomenon , but differ due to the presence of diffusion and the Allee
term A. This spatial information obviously gives the PDE model a richer descriptive capacity;
however, it is also the case that the mathematical analysis and numerical simulations using the
PDE require significantly more effort, both in terms of computational time and the complexity of
the model implementation. For this reason, the question of when the ODE model may provide a
reasonable surrogate for the PDE is an important one.
As our analysis in the following sections will demonstrate, close to the zero equilibrium, that
is when all quantities are small, the spatial (diffusive) terms, which are quadratic, are negligible
and the PDE becomes an ODE with delay terms. In the case when A = 0, which is considered for
example in our 1D simulations, a complete stability analysis of the equation allows to obtain sharp
rigorous stability bounds which emphasize the dependence of stability of the steady state with
respect to the delay. In the case when A is nonzero, such stability bounds can be interpreted in an
approximate way. For reasonably small variations in local population densities, the ODE solution
may still well-approximate the spatially integrated PDE solution. Thus, if the spatial transients
5

are not considered important, as may be the case in certain applications, the ODE model may be a
more practical choice than the PDE model for its computational convenience. We will discuss the
relationship between the two models formally in the analysis section.
Moreover, we will qualitatively compare the behavior of the solutions obtained with the two
models, in order to illustrate the theoretical results in the numerical experiments sections.

Analysis

In this section we will analyze the DDE models (12)-(15), (16)-(19) mathematically. In particular,
we examine the equilibrium solutions of (16)-(19) and (12)-(15) for the case A = 0 and their
stability properties. We then proceed to analyze the scalar linear equation associated to (16)-(19),
(12)-(15) with A = 0, deriving stability conditions in terms of the physical parameters. We then
examine the general case of (12)-(15) for A 6= 0, and analyze the impact of the Allee term on the
stability behavior.

Equilibria and their stability
It is straightforward to note that the only equilibrium of (16)-(19) is
(s∗ , i∗ , d∗ , r∗ ) = (0, 0, 0, 0) .
The linearized system is given by
ṡ(t) = α n(t) − µ s(t)

(21)

i̇(t) = − (φd + φr ) i(t − σ) − µ i(t)

(22)

ṙ(t) = φr i(t − σ) − µ r(t)
˙ = φd i(t − σ)
d(t)

(23)
(24)

By adding equations (22)-(24) to (21) and making use of the variable n (as defined in (20)), instead
of s we may replace (21) with
ṅ(t) = (α − µ) n(t) + µ d(t)

(25)

Due to the last equation (24) of the DDE system, no contractivity arguments can be used to
infer about the asymptotic stability of the solution.

Stability of the scalar linear delay equation
In order to state the stability theorem we need to consider the scalar equation
ẏ(t) = αy(t) + βy(t − τ )

(26)

with the delay τ an arbitrary but fixed positive constant.
By the change of variables t = t/τ , a = ατ , b = βτ we are led to the equation
ẏ(t) = ay(t) + by(t − 1).

behavior of the solution of (27). The general solution is then obtained as a sum of exponentials,

The zeros of (28) are plotted in the left picture of Figure 2 for the case (a, b) = (0.5, −1). Notice
that they all lie in the left half-plane, so that the solution will tend to zero for t → ∞ (despite a
positive a).
We provide the stability region in the right picture of Figure 2 (see e.g [1]). Note that if a = 0
then the zero solution is asymptotically stable for b ∈ (−π/2, 0) and equivalently - referring to
equation (26) - it is asymptotically stable if bτ ∈ (−π/2, 0). The transcendental curve bounding
the stability region is expressed in parametric form as


φ
(a(φ), b(φ)) = φ cot(φ), −
,
φ ∈ (0, π)
sin(φ)
which might be expressed as a monotonically increasing function b(a). Asymptotically the curve
approaches the line b = −a; as φ → 0 it tends to the point (1, −1) and at φ = π/2 it crosses the
point (0, −π/2).

(i) α − µ < 0 or α = µ = 0;
(ii) φd + φr <

π
.
2σ

Then the zero equilibrium of (21)-(24), (25) is stable.
7

Proof. Consider first the DDE
i̇(t) = −µ i(t) − (φd + φr ) i(t − σ)
which has the form (26). By non-negativity of µ we have that if
(φd + φr )σ <

π
2

the characteristic equation has all roots in the negative complex plane so that limt→∞ i(t) = 0.
Moreover it can be shown that the decay is exponential (see [5]).
Next look at
˙ = φd i(t − σ)
d(t)
from which we obtain boundedness of d as a consequence of the exponential decay of i(·). Similarly,
looking at
ṙ(t) = −µ r(t) + φr i(t − σ)
we have exponential decay if µ > 0 and simply boundedness if µ = 0. Finally, for what concerns
the equation
ṅ(t) = (α − µ) n(t) + µ d(t)
we conclude in a similar way, which means that if α − µ < 0 n(t) → 0 as t → ∞; otherwise if
α = µ = 0 the stability statement holds trivially.

3.1

Stability of the equilibrium of the PDE

The analysis of the PDE (12)-(15) when A = 0 leads to the same stability Theorem 3.1. This
follows immediately from the fact that , in the linearization of (12),(13) and (14), the terms
∇ · (n(t) νs ∇s(t)) and ∇ · (n(t)νi ∇i(t)) are quadratic and hence do not influence the analysis .
As a consequence, the linearized system is formally analogous to the one obtained for the simpler
DDE model (16)-(19) .
More in detail, looking at the PDE-based model we have that, at the equilibrium (s∗ , i∗ , d∗ , r∗ ) =
(0, 0, 0, 0). Neglecting second order terms gives the system:


A
∂t s(t) = αn(t) − 1 −
s(t) (βe i(t) + βi i(t − σ)) − µs(t)
(29)
n(t)


A
∂t i(t) =
1−
s(t) (βe i(t) + βi i(t − σ)) − (φd i + φr ) i(t − σ) − µi(t)
(30)
n(t)
∂t r(t) = φr i(t − σ) − µr(t)
(31)
∂t d(t) = φd i(t − σ).

(32)

Observe that:
(a) If A = 0 we formally reobtain the same system (21)-(24) so that Theorem 3.1 applies unchanged. In fact, in such a case, we may view the linearized system (21)-(24) as the system
(29)-(32) integrated in space.

8

(b) The case A 6= 0 is more involved.
By adding equations (30)-(32) to (29) and making use of the variable n instead of s, we may
replace (29) with:
∂t n(t) = (α − µ) n(t) + µ d(t).
Since n(t) = s(t) + i(t) + r(t) and s, i and r are non-negative, we have that:
δ(t) :=

s(t)
∈ [0, 1]
n(t)

∀t.

(33)

which allows us to rewrite (29)-(32) as:
∂t s(t) = αn(t) + Aβe δ(t)i(t) + Aβi δ(t)i(t − σ) − µs(t)
∂t i(t) = −Aδ(t) (βe i(t) + βi i(t − σ)) − (φd + φr ) i(t − σ) − µi(t)
(34)
∂t r(t) = φr i(t − σ) − µr(t)
∂t d(t) = φd i(t − σ).
Looking at the second equation in (34) we recognize a DDE of the form
∂t i(t) = a(t)i(t) + b(t)i(t − σ).

(35)

A well-known asymptotic stability condition for (35) is given by (see e.g. [1])
a(t) + |b(t)| < 0

∀t,

which yields:
−µ − A (βe − βi ) δ(t) + φd + φr < 0.
In the usual case where βe ≥ βi , we obtain that the condition
−µ + φd + φr < 0
implies asymptotic stability (of contractive type) of the solution i independently of the delay
σ.
We remark that this is a sufficient and not necessary condition for a stronger type of asymptotic stability, namely contractivity, of the solution.
Under this condition we have that lim i(t) = 0. The analysis of the remaining equations for
t→∞

the variables r, d and n is analogous to the one provided in the proof of Theorem 3.1.
Note that if we could treat δ(t) as a constant (see (33)), we would get the same sufficient
conditions to asymptotic stability provided by Theorem 3.1, i.e.
π
(i) α − µ < 0 or α = µ = 0;
or
(ii) φd + φr <
.
2σ
thus depending on the delay σ. In a regime where δ(t) ∈ [0, 1] does not exhibit big variations, we
expect that such conditions continue to hold true, at least approximately.

Comments

In some cases we observe non-physical slightly negative values of the modeled quantities. This is
due to the fact that when
1
ν = 0 and φd + φr ≥
,
eσ
the rightmost roots of the characteristic equation are complex conjugate. This is easily seen observing that the equation λ = b e−λ has no real roots if b < − 1e .
1
Instead, when φd + φr <
a real root dominates. However, since the oscillations occur when
eσ
the solution approaches the steady state in the asymptotically stable regime, we may overlook the
potential misbehavior.
Remark 1. If µ < 0 then the stability bound φd +φr <
as µ increases (see Figure 2).

M
σ

can be made larger; that is, M increases

Remark 2. We may understand the bound (ii) of Theorem 3.1 physically as a relationship between
the removal rate, as governed by the parameters φd and φr , and the time delay σ. This bound
states that, for the equations to be stable, the rate of recovery and/or mortality from the disease
must occur over a time scale sufficiently longer than the time delay σ (recall that φd and φr have
units 1/Time, while σ has units Time).

Numerical implementation and experiments

In this section we will perform several numerical tests to evaluate various characteristics of the
model and its numerical solution. In particular, we will perform the following experiments:
1. Several examples using the ODE version of the model (16)-(19). Here, we observe the impact of the delay on aspects of the physical solution, including the effects on contagion and
lockdown measures. We also examine the derived stability bounds and influence of different
parameters.
2. A one-dimensional example using the PDE model (12)-(15) based on the simulation performed
in [27, 11] for different values of σ and problem parameters. These examples seek to examine
the solution characteristics in both quantitative and qualitative aspects on an artificial problem which shares many characteristics with a real-world problem, but remains tractable and
sufficiently simple to analyze in detail. We also seek to confirm the correspondence between
simulations using the ODE and spatially integrated solutions of the PDE.
3. A two-dimensional example using the COVID-19 outbreak in Lombardy, Italy employing the
PDE model (12)-(15). This simulation is similar to the ones carried out in [27, 26], which
were well-validated against the measured data at the time of publication. This example is
designed to show the viability of the delay-equation formulation in reproducing real-world
data, as well as its performance when compared to non-delay models.

ODE Model

In order to perform the simulations for the ODE model (16)-(19), we employ the Matlab solver
DDE23. As initial conditions, we set the total population n = 1000, and as a historic function we

choose i(t) = 1 for t ∈ [−σ, 0]. Assuming r(0) = 0 and d(0) = 0, we end up with s(0) = n − i. The
final time of the simulation is t = 267 days. The parameter values are reported in Table 11 . To
observe the impact of the delay, we run the simulation for different values of σ: σ = 5, 10, 15 and
20 days.
We note that for increasing values of the delay the number of the infections is higher, i.e. in
Fig. 3(left) the infection peak for σ = 5 (black line) is much lower than the peak for σ = 20
(magenta line). Furthermore, we observe that the amplitude of the peak is larger for high values
of the delay. On the other hand, if the delay is too high with respect to the parameters, we could
obtain non physical solutions, as in Fig. 3(left), where the infections becomes negative for σ = 20.
In the following we will investigate the impact of the government restrictions, i.e. the introduction
of lockdowns, and the stability of the model from a numerical point of view.
4.1.1

Effect of lockdowns

Due to the relevance of the pandemic on the dailylife routine, we seek to observe the effect of
government restrictions, i.e., lockdowns, on the evolution of the compartments. To this end, we
run two cases, one without lockdowns, in which the contact rates β are kept constant throughout
the simulation, and one with lockdowns, in which we set β = β/4 at t = 30 days. In fact, the aim
of the lockdown is to reduce the contact rate.
In Fig. 3, we show the evolution of the infected compartment in time, for the different values of
σ without (left) and with (right) restrictions. It is clear that the number of infections increases with
the delay even in the lockdown situation, as expected. However the lockdown restriction reduces
the number of infected people by about 20%. Moreover, we observe the same effect focusing on the
deceased compartment. Indeed, looking at the deaths peak in Fig. 4, the deaths peak is lower in
the lockdown situation.
We also observe that, with larger values for the delay, the effect of the lockdown measures is
less readily observed. One may particularly see this in Fig. 3 on the right, where the decrease of

For the ODE model, these values have been normalized by n(0)=1000, and accordingly has units of Days−1 .

for larger values of σ. This is consistent with our expectations.
4.1.2

Stability of the ODE model

We now investigate the numerical stability of the ODE model, and in particular, we seek to examine
the validity of the bound in Theorem 3.1 and verify it numerically. Looking at the deceased
compartment, Fig. 4 shows that the solution is stable for σ = 5, 10, 15, 20, since we choose the
parameters according to the bounds (i) − (ii) of the Theorem 3.1. Indeed, α = µ = 0, φr =
1/32, φd = 3/640, which means that

On the other hand, modifying the parameters as φr = 3/32 and φd = 1/80 we get an unstable
solution for σ = 15, as shown in Fig. 5. In fact for σ = 15 the oscillations are increasing in time,
while for σ = 10 they are smearing out. This is also consistent with the analysis, as we may expect
oscillations for larger values of σ, however, if the numerical bound is respected, these oscillations
should stabilize and not affect the solution asymptotically.
An interesting behavior that we also observe, is that if we choose φd = 1/80 and φr = 28/320 we
obtain a periodic, non-physical behaviour of the solution for σ = 15, Fig. 6. As shown in the figure,
we observe oscillations that neither increase nor decrease, instead demonstrating what appears to
be a true periodic regime. Indeed the with these parameters we have:

This suggests that, near the limit of the stability bound, solutions exhibit a periodic behavior.
Considering that the oscillations decrease for φr , φd sufficiently below the stability bound, and
increase for φr , φd sufficiently large, this behavior is perhaps to be expected. Whether this is a
mere mathematical curiosity or perhaps indicates relevant biological information is not clear, and
is potentially a subject of future investigation.

1D PDE Model

In this example, we follow basic setup inspired by the one-dimensional example introduced in [27]
and also performed in [11]. We will examine the behavior of the solution under various conditions,
as well as the validity of the stability bound for the partial differential equation.

These conditions are plotted in Fig. 7. Qualitatively, they correspond to a population distribution
with one major population center, one moderate population center, and one lesser population
center, with an initial outbreak centered in the lesser population center.
For the parameters, we use the values shown in Table 1. We discretize in space over the unit
interval with ∆x = 1/2000, and advance in time using the BDF2 scheme with ∆t = .25. It was
demonstrated in [27] that this spatiotemporal discretization resolves all dynamics satisfactorily. We
note also that our choice of time-step ensures that we may use previously computed solutions for
our delay terms, and there is no need for interpolation [1].
We run the simulation for t = 267 days for σ = 5, 10, 15, and 20. We seek to examine the effect
of σ on contagion, but also on the efficacy of public health interventions. To this end, for each value
of σ we run the full time interval both with and without lockdown measures. For the case with no
lockdown, we use the parameters shown in Table 1 over the entire time interval. For the case with
lockdowns, at t = 140 we multiply all diffusive terms ν by 1/2, simulating restricted mobility, and

15

contact terms β by 1/4, corresponding to measures such as bar closures, mask wearing etc. We note
that the problem setup is designed to resemble the ODE simulations in the preceding subsection.
4.2.2

Effect of lockdowns

In Figs. 8, 9, 10, 11 we show the total (i.e., integrated in space) susceptible, infected, recovered, and
deceased compartments in time, respectively for each value of σ and lockdown configuration. We
see that longer σ is associated with higher infective peaks, however cumulative deaths, long-term,
are similar for all σ. This is consistent with our expectations, as reducing infective peaks does not
necessarily correspond to fewer cases overall.
More interesting is the observed effect of σ on lockdown efficacy. Referring to Fig. 11, the
results show that longer σ leads to a noticeable lag in the delay compartment; indeed, one begins
to see a decrease in mortality as a result of the lockdown at a later date for larger σ. In the plot
of the infected compartment in Fig. 9, the impact of lockdowns appears immediate. This is indeed
what we expect, as the definition of this compartment includes pre-symptomatic patients; thus,
while the effects are immediate by this definition, other indicators, such as the aforementioned
deceased compartment, will lag in proportion to σ.
The delay σ appears to not only affect the time at which the effect of lockdowns appear, but
also the sharpness of such effects. While for larger σ, the deceased compartment begins to decrease
later as compared to smaller values, once this decrease begins, it occurs much more rapidly. This is
particularly visible in the infected compartment shown in Fig. 9; around t = 175, the total number
of infections is indeed larger for smaller values of σ .
An important dynamic that we notice for large σ is the emergence of non-physical behavior,
similar to those observed in the ODE case. This is particularly apparent for the case of σ = 20,
where we observe the infected compartment becoming negative, and decreases in the recovered and
deceased compartments, which should be monotonic. While this behavior is non-physical, it is not
mathematically inconsistent with the model behavior and does not represent instability as such.
Indeed, to guarantee positivity, more stringent conditions on the relationship between φr , φd and
σ are likely required.
4.2.3

Stability of the PDE Model

We now examine the validity of the bound (ii) in Theorem 3.1, derived for the ODE model, for the
PDE model. As mentioned in the analysis section, we expect the results to hold identically in this
case. In the preceding, we observe that for the parameters in Table 1:
1
3
π
+
≈ .0359 <
32 640
2σ
for σ=5, 10, 15, 20, thus satisfying the condition for all considered σ. While we see see non-physical
behaviors for both cases of σ = 20, the solution does indeed remain stable. Such behaviors appear
to be independent of both time-step size and time-integration scheme, and represent the model
behavior. Thus, to guarantee physical behavior, stability is necessary but not sufficient.

of σ.
again satisfying the stability condition for all σ, we again see further numerical validation of the
system stability. As shown in Fig. 12, all values of σ are stable. σ = 5 and σ = 10 both show
physical behavior, avoiding oscillations and large decreases in the deceased compartment. While
σ = 15 is stable, the behavior is clearly nonphysical, and we see oscillations and decreases in the
deceased compartment.
For φr = 3/32 and φd = 1/80:

π
+

2σ
for σ = 5, 10 but not for σ = 15. The behavior of σ = 5 is both physical and stable, and σ = 10 is
stable but nonphysical, as shown in Fig. 13. σ = 15 violates the stability bound slightly, and we
observe unstable behavior, with large increasing oscillations. This establishes not only the validity
of the stability bound, but also its strictness. These results confirm the analysis, showing that the
stability bound (ii) in Theorem 3.1, holds for the PDE model. However, as the results also show
clearly, stability does not imply a physical solution, as one still may observe negative values in the
infected compartment and non-monotonic behavior in the recovered and deceased compartments.
For sufficiently small values of σ in comparison to φd , φr , we observe numerically that one may
expect physical behavior in the solution. A positivity condition, a much stronger condition than
stability, is required to guarantee physical solution behavior; this likely depends on the initial data
and is an interesting direction for future work.

Figure 9: Total infected for φr =1/32, φd =3/640. A longer σ is associated with more infections, but
also a more dramatic decrease in infection after lockdowns are initiated. The impact of lockdowns
in the infected compartment is visible more immediately, with the lag effect being more pronounced
in the deceased compartment. We also observe clearly the non-physical behavior for σ = 20 in both
cases, with the infected compartment becoming negative.

well as delaying the efficacy of public health measures. However, while the effects of intervention
are delayed, we note that, once visible, their impact occurs more suddenly. We observe non-physical
behavior for σ = 20, showing that the model may exhibit non-physical behaviors for larger σ.

4.2.4

Relationship with ODE solutions

In this case, we observe that the ODE provides a good approximation to the space-integrated PDE
in 1D. This is expected from our analysis, as in this case we have taken A = 0 and the variation
in population density, while present, is not extreme. As mentioned previously, ODE models are
obviously much less demanding than PDE models from the point of view of both implementation
and simulation time as well as from analytical/stability analysis point of view . For this reason,
if possible, their use may be preferred over PDEs in certain contexts. These simulations confirm
that, near equilibria, for small values of A, and relatively small variation in population density, the
ODE may provide a surrogate for the PDE, if spatial differences are not considered important and
one wishes to instead consider the population independently of space. On the other hand, the
PDE model provides more reliable forecast when these factors are important, due to the presence
of the spatial information.

4.3

Lombardy Simulation

Our final numerical test models the outbreak of COVID-19 in the region of Lombardy, Italy. This
test case was first used to validate a SEIRD model in [26], in which the simulation results showed
good agreement with the measured data. It was then examined in further detail in [27], where
other aspects of the problem, including the model sensitivity to diffusion, were investigated . We
will not discuss such aspects of this model here, as the focus of the present work is on the delay
differential equation model. Hence, for a more detailed discussion of the aforementioned results,

correspond to various restrictions (or relaxtions) taken by the government during the epidemic. We
note that these parameters are not normalized in space.

we kindly refer the reader to [26, 27].
For the spatial discretization, we utilize an unstructured triangular mesh with 41625 elements.
For the temporal discretization, we use the Backward-Euler method with a time step ∆t = .25
days. We solve the nonlinear problem at each time step using a Picard-style linearization, and the
corresponding linear systems are solved using the GMRES algorithm with a Jacobi-style preconditioner. At all boundaries, we assign no-flux boundary conditions, corresponding to total isolation.
The parameter values are reported in Table 2. We note that these differ from those shown in
[27, 26]; this is primarily due to differences resulting from the fact that, in the current delay model,
asymptomatic individuals are now considered within the ‘infected’ compartment.
In Fig. 14, we show how the results compare to two formulations of the problem shown in
[27]: the ‘baseline’ case, which features the same diffusive parameters used here, and the case
with doubled diffusion. Note that we focus here on the deceased compartment, rather than the
infectious compartment, due to the differing definitions ‘infected’ between the two models. We see
similar qualitative behavior to the baseline case, with an R2 correlation coefficient between the of
99.8%. Over the first 40 days, the behavior is nearly identical, with the results beginning to differ
somewhat further in time. The agreement with the baseline case, rather than the high-diffusion
case from [27], suggests that the delay model does not interfere with the diffusive behavior generally.
In Fig. 15, we observe the evolution of the epidemic in space. Starting from the top-left and
moving clockwise, we show the density of infected individuals on days 1, 5, 10, and 20. What
begins as a small cluster of cases in the south of the region moves northward, into the region’s large
cities (Milan, Bergamo, and Brescia). While the initially affected regions improve rapidly, in the
large cities the epidemic continues to grow. This is consistent with the observed data, and with
the simulations using non-delay models shown in [26].
In order to assess the stability bound, we performed a second numerical simulation. We note
that, strictly speaking, as A is nonzero in this case, the assumptions of the stability bound do not
strictly hold. However, in other simulations (not shown), the qualitative behavior of the model
with A = 0 was similar to that shown here, and so we may expect the bound to hold heuristically.
To better observe the stability behavior, we set βi , βe = 3.75 · 10−4 from Feb. 27-Mar. 4, and βi ,

In accordance with the theory, we do not expect stability for this case. Indeed, this is what
we observe. In Fig. 16, we plot the total number of active infections for the stable (previously
discussed) case, as well as the unstable case. While in the stable case we observe the expected
behavior, in which infections remain positive and grow or decrease in response to the pandemicarresting measures in place, we instead observe large oscillations between positive and negative
values for the unstable case. We show this behavior in time and space in Fig. 17, where one sees
the oscillations concentrated in the heavily-affected outbreak zones within the region. The frequency
of these oscillations appears to be nonuniform, and dependent on infection concentration. Whether
this provides any important information is, unclear, though it is an interesting observation and
perhaps worthy of some investigation.

Conclusions

We have presented a new formulation for epidemic models utilizing delay differential equations in
both an ODE and PDE formulation. We have established stability results for the ODE formula2

The remainder of parameter values are the same as in Table 2

tion, which were then confirmed with numerical experiments. For the PDE model, we observed
interesting dynamics regarding the relationship between the delay time and lockdowns, as well as
contagion in general. We further showed, with numerical evidence, that the stability bounds established for the ODE also hold for the PDE, and that in some situations the ODE may a reasonable
surrogate for the PDE. We then concluded with a simulation on a realistic problem, in which we
showed that the delay PDE can reproduce reality at a reasonable level, by obtaining results similar
to non-delay models shown in other work. We also analyzed the spatiotemporal behavior of the
unstable regime, finding it produced large oscillatory behavior between positive and negative values
within the heavily impacted regions.
There are many worthwhile directions for future work on this model, and the area generally.
While we provided theoretical and numerical evidence of stability, we also showed for both the
PDE and ODE that stability does not necessarily guarantee physical solution behavior. A stronger
result, such as a positivity condition, is needed to provide such a result. Lastly, we have restricted
ourselves to the constant delay case as a first step, but the most general and realistic models of this
type should incorporate state-dependent delays. Although such models have many theoretical and
numerical difficulties, many epidemics and other related phenomena exhibit this type of behavior
[22, 21, 1, 5].
