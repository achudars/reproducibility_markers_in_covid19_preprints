Abstract—The novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) is an infectious
disease caused by a new virus called COVID-19 or 2019nCoV that first identified in Wuhan, China. The disease causes
respiratory illness (such as the flu) with other symptoms such
as a cough, fever, and in more severe cases, difficulty breathing.
This new Coronavirus seems to be very infectious and has spread
quickly and globally. In this work, information about COVID-19
is provided and the situation in Arab countries and territories
regarding the COVID-19 strike is presented. The next few weeks
main expectations is also given.
Index Terms—Coronavirus, COVID-19, Arab Countries.

I. I NTRODUCTION
The well known Coronaviruses such as MERS-CoV, SARSCoV and COVID-19 are a group of viruses that infects both
birds and mammals which meaning that they are transmitted
between people and animals. These set of Coronaviruses
cause infections that are related to the common cold and flu
in humans where symptoms vary according to the infected
species [1], [2]. The COVID-19 has reported being a novel
Coronavirus of a typical pneumonia since the date 31/12/2019.
The COVID-19 started in Wuhan city in China and then
spread around the world very fast. Covid-19 is considered as
the second Coronavirus outbreak that affects the Middle East
region, following the MERS-CoV which was reported in Saudi
Arabia in the year 2012. United Arab Emirates (UAE) was
the first Middle East Arab country to report a Coronaviruspositive case, following the Wuhan city Coronavirus outbreak
in China. Recently, on 11/03/2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that the global COVID-19 outbreak is
a pandemic because of the speed and scale of transmission
of the virus. From the 195 countries in the world today,
there are more than 266,100 Coronavirus total cases reported
to Coronavirus resource center until now [3]. Moreover, the
number of total deaths are more than 11,200 cases and the
number of total recovered are more than 87,300 cases. Figure
1 shows the Coronavirus COVID-19 global cases presented
by the center for systems science and engineering (CSSE)
at Johns Hopkins University (JHU) up-to-the-date 20/03/2020
[4].
In this work, the up-to-date information about COVID-19
is provided and the situation in Arab countries and territories
regarding the COVID-19 outbreak is presented.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Section II,
we presented recent related works on COVID-19. The COVID19 basics are discussed in Section III. The situations in Arab
countries and territories are discussed in Section IV while
conclusions are given in Section V.
II. R ELATED W ORKS
Several researchers were working under difficult and dangerous conditions to bring out new Coronavirus disease
(COVID-19) content. In [5], a modeling study on now-casting
and forecasting the potential domestic and international spread
of the 2019-nCoV outbreak originating in Wuhan, China is
presented. In [6], mass gathering events and reducing further
global spread of COVID-19 is presented. An analysis of
International Health Regulations annual report data from 182
countries is given in [7]. Momentous decisions and many
uncertainties of COVID-19 in Italy are proposed in [8]. In
[9], the resilience of the Spanish health system against the
COVID-19 pandemic is discussed. The day level forecasting
for Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) spread analysis is proposed in [10]. In [11], authors introduced essential knowledge
about COVID-19 and nosocomial infection in dental settings
and provides recommended management protocols for dental
practitioners and students in (potentially) affected areas.
III. COVID-19 BASICS
The persons who are infected with Coronavirus COVID-19
may not know that they have symptoms of COVID-19 because
these symptoms are similar to a cold or flu common symptoms.
Symptoms of COVID-19 may take up to 14 days to appear
after the person exposure to COVID-19 virus. These days are
the longest known infectious period for this disease believed
by experts.
COVID-19 symptoms may have included:
∗ fever,
∗ cough,
∗ difficulty breathing,
∗ pneumonia in both lungs.
There are some basic protective measures against the
COVID-19 virus available on the WHO website and through
your national and local public health authority. Most of the
people who become infected experience moderate illness and

heal, but it can be more severe for some cases and for other
cases infection can lead to death. To protect others and take
care, the following instructions is very helpful:
1) Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an
alcohol-based hand rub or simply wash them with soap
and water for 20 second.
2) Maintain at least 1 meter distance between a yourself
and anyone who is coughing or sneezing beside you.
3) Avoid touching the eyes, nose and mouth before
cleaning it carefully.
4) Make sure that you and the people around you are following good respiratory hygiene. Covering your mouth
and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough
or sneeze. Then, get rid of the used tissue immediately.
5) Stay at home if you feel diseased. If you have a fever,
cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention
and call in advance.
6) Follow the directions of your local health authority.
IV. T HE S ITUATION

IN

A RAB C OUNTRIES

The new COVID-19 virus has had a greater proliferation
in a shorter amount of time than its predecessors SARS and
MERS. However, the percentage of deaths remains much
lower. Nearly, about 10% of those infected died during the
SARS outbreak, while 35% died during MERS. Among the
countries with Coronavirus in the Arab world, Qatar has the
highest number of Coronavirus cases, followed by Bahrain
and Saudi Arabia as shown in Table I and Figure 2. Other
Arab world countries that are currently free from Coronavirus
include Syria and Comoros while Libya and Yemen have
suspected cases.
As a precautionary measure, almost all Arab countries
has temporarily banned entry to people and tourists from

Coronavirus-affected countries and other countries as well.
Most of Arab countries also close their borders and stop flights
to/from other countries for different period of time.
In the next few weeks there are more than one scenario that
may happen in the Arab countries as listed here:
1) The best and hopefully scenario that the Arab world
countries will be able to succeed in dealing with the
outbreak and preventing widespread infection among its
population especially with the help of vaccine(in case it
appears).
2) The infection rate will continue in growth and will
soon reach the peak and start return back with the cost
of many infected cases and deaths.
3) The worst case that the infection take more time and
many cases with COVID-19 will still appear with in the
next few months. This is worst and nightmare for many
Arab countries with limited resources.
4) The COVID-19 vaccine will appear in the perfect time
to overcome all this bad expectations.
V. C ONCLUSIONS AND F UTURE W ORK
The novel Coronavirus COVID-19 is declared as an international epidemic on March 2020. The disease causes respiratory
illness (such as the flu) with other symptoms such as a
cough, fever, and in more severe cases, difficulty breathing.
This new Coronavirus seems to be very infectious and has
spread quickly and globally. In this work, information about
COVID-19 is provided and the situation in Arab countries and
territories regarding the COVID-19 strike is presented. The
next few weeks main expectation scenarios is also given.
