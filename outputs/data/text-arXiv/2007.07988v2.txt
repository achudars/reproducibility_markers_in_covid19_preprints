Abstract
COVID-19–a viral infectious disease–has quickly emerged as a global pandemic infecting
millions of people with a significant number of deaths across the globe. The symptoms
of this disease vary widely. Depending on the symptoms an infected person is broadly
classified into two categories namely, asymptomatic and symptomatic. Asymptomatic
individuals display mild or no symptoms but continue to transmit the infection to otherwise healthy individuals. This particular aspect of asymptomatic infection poses a major
obstacle in managing and controlling the transmission of the infectious disease. In this
paper, we attempt to mathematically model the spread of COVID-19 in India under various intervention strategies. We consider SEIR type epidemiological models, incorporated
with India specific social contact matrix representing contact structures among different
age groups of the population. Impact of various factors such as presence of asymptotic
individuals, lockdown strategies, social distancing practices, quarantine, and hospitalization on the disease transmission is extensively studied. Numerical simulation of our
model is matched with the real COVID-19 data of India till May 15, 2020 for the purpose
of estimating the model parameters. Our model with zone-wise lockdown is seen to give
a decent prediction for July 20, 2020.

was reported as a mysterious pneumonia from Wuhan in the Hubei Province of China.
In a short span of time, this infectious disease has rapidly spread across the world and
has catapulted into a global pandemic. As of 15th July 2020, the virus has infected over
13.5 million people with more than 580,000 confirmed deaths globally.
The symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection vary widely with most people only experiencing mild to moderate respiratory illness symptoms. A small proportion of people
develop severe respiratory complications often requiring ICU and ventilator support [41],
except few regions [4, 21] like Seattle and Lombardy (Italy), where the percentage is
higher. Based on clinical data, elderly people have been found to be at greater risk of
experiencing acute respiratory distress symptoms with high mortality rate as compared
to people of younger age. Study also suggests that approximately 80% of the infected
individuals are asymptomatic carriers who experience mild or no symptoms but continue
to transmit the virus to otherwise healthy people. This has caused the detection and
containment of the SARS-CoV-2 virus transmission a very challenging problem for civic
authorities.
The COVID-19 pandemic is inflicting significantly high mortality, straining public healthcare systems and causing severe socio-economic distress globally. In the absence of any
potent vaccine or effective pharmaco-medical treatments available, all efforts towards the
pandemic management and mitigation have largely focused on non-pharmaceutical interventions like social distancing, lockdowns, contact tracing, quarantine and isolation.
Intensive testing, contact tracing, and isolation of cases has to a large extent enabled
disease transmission control in several places, such as Israel, Singapore and South Korea. Goal of these intervention strategies is to slowdown the disease transmission, reduce
mortality rate and ameliorate the burden and strain on healthcare systems.
Since the seminal work [28] of Kermack-McKendric in 1927 on SIR epidemic model [45],
several researchers have used adapted or modified versions of the basic SIR epidemiological model for modelling evolution of epidemics. Various versions of the basic models
are essentially systems of first order ODEs with an incidence function and dependency
on constant parameters describing the nature of the infectious disease such as rate of
transmission on contact, rate of recovery, mortality, incubation period etc. In practice
these parameters vary during the course of the epidemic and also across geographical
regions and local population. Another drawback of SIR type models involving intervention strategies is eventually almost the whole susceptible population become infected in
a short span of time due to the exponential rate of transmission. Intervention strategies
applied on SIR models only delay the eventual infection of almost entire population.

Generally, epidemics with latency periods [2, 3, 6] are modeled by compartmental epidemiological models of the type Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR). Mathematics
of epidemic models like SIR and SEIR, and its variants can be seen in [22], along with
different threshold numbers. Let N denote the size of a population, S(t) the number of
susceptible individuals at time t, E(t) the number of exposed individuals at time t, I(t)
the number of infected individuals at time t, and R(t) the number of recovered and death
cases at time t. Then evolution of the epidemic is governed by the system of first order
ODEs
Ṡ(t) = µN − βSI/N − µS,
Ė(t) = βSI/N − (µ + α)E,
˙ = αE − (µ + γ)I,
I(t)
Ṙ(t) = γI − µR.
Here µ denote constant rate of new recruitment to the susceptible population as well as
natural death rate in each compartment. Parameter β measures potential force of infection on contact, whereas parameters α and γ denote rate of transition from compartments
˙ + Ṙ(t) = 0.
E and I to I and R, respectively. One may note that Ṡ(t) + Ė(t) + I(t)
Therefore, S(t) + E(t) + I(t) + R(t) = N is constant for all time t ≥ 0 and the solution
space is {(S, E, I, R) ∈ R4+ : S + E + I + R = N }. The model is extended here along with
the contact network to perform a data based analysis for the COVID-19 spread and its
control in India.
Main Contributions : The focus of our work is to understand the different disease control
target interventions and accordingly predict the disease spread possibilities by estimating
the model parameters from the available data. In this attempt our main contributions
are listed below.
1. We have used two epidemic models – SEAIRD and control based SEAIRD – to
model the evolution of COVID-19 in India. The second model fine tunes the first
model towards the twin goals of capturing the real situation and making credible
suggestions to policy makers involved in the pandemic management and mitigation.
2. The disease free and endemic stability of the SEAIRD model has been established.
3. Presence of asymptomatic infections and their role in largely unbridled and quick
disease transmission is computationally established.
4. The control based SEAIRD model has two very interesting features. One being
a reverse flow from quarantine class (Q) to susceptible class (S) and another one
modeling increased awareness for social distancing practices among the population.
These features model the effectiveness of the general and individual level preventive
measures quarantine and social distancing.
3

5. The control based SEAIRD model parameters are traced back by matching the real
COVID-19 data of India for the first 93 days. Some model based predictions are
presented to understand the possibility of second wave, its size and time of arrival
under different lockdown policies.
6. Three lockdown policies are considered. One of them (LD-I) attempt to model
different lockdown phases (complete lockdown, zone-wise lockdown) in India. Additionally, two staggered policies are designed as suggestions to policy makers for
further bringing down the infection levels and mitigate the adverse socio-economic
impact.
Before presenting the technical details, in Section 2, we enlist some relevant definitions
and theorems useful in describing mathematical models of epidemics. A standard model
suitable for modeling COVID-19 pandemic named as SEAIRD is proposed in Section 3,
incorporating the age and contact structures to track the COVID-19 evolution in India.
In this model, the removed compartment (R) is further partitioned into two compartments, namely, recovered class (R) and death class (D). The infective class of population
is subdivided into two classes, namely, asymptomatic (A) and symptomatic (I). Presence
of asymptomatic infections and their role in largely unbridled and quick disease transmission is computationally established. There are some theoretical support for the new
SEAIRD model discussed in Subsection 3.1 for establishing the disease free and endemic
equilibrium points and their stability. We study the disease transmission under three
different lockdown scenarios namely, no lockdown, strict lockdown for prolonged time
period, and staggered lockdown phases of varying degrees of implementation.
An improvised SEAIRD model where the scope of the pandemic model is broadened
to incorporate quarantine (Q) and hospitalization (H) measures is considered in Section
4 to further control the disease transmission. The model parameters are traced back
by comparing with the real COVID-19 data in India. In Section 5, multiple lockdown
policies and social distancing strategies are experimented computationally, which suggest
the possibility of second wave of infections and possible optimal control strategy in next
two years time frame. This analysis is followed by limitations of the model, future scope
and challenges discussion in Subsection 5.1. Finally, Section 6, presents the conclusion of
this work.

2. Epidemic Model : Basic Definitions & Concepts
The general pandemic model considers a heterogeneous population that can be grouped
into n homogeneous compartments. Further, the compartments may be sorted such
that the first m compartments consists of all the infected cases. Let x = (x1 , · · · , xn )T
represent a general state of the model where, xi ≥ 0 denote the number of individuals
4

in each compartment. Thus, all states of the model are restricted to the closed positive
cone x ∈ X = R+ . Further, let
Xs = {x ≥ 0 | xi = 0, i = 1, 2 · · · , m}
denote the set of disease free states. The system of differential equations modeling disease
transmission in X is of the form
ẋ = f (x), f = (f1 , f2 , · · · , fn )

(2.1)

where components of f are of the form fi (x) = Fi (x) − Wi (x), i = 1, 2, · · · , n. Here Fi (x)
represents the rate of appearance of new infections in compartment i by all other means
and
Wi (x) = Wi− (x) − Wi+ (x),
where Wi− (x) is the rate of transfer of individuals out of the ith compartment and Wi+ (x)
is the rate of transfer of individuals into compartment i by all other means. It is assumed
that each function is at least twice continuously differentiable in each variable. Furthermore, it is required that F ≥ 0 and W is an M -matrix, so that, W −1 ≥ 0. The
next-generation matrix [14] is computed corresponding to the m infected compartments
and defined to be K = F W −1 ≥ 0. The next-generation matrix is used in computing the
reproduction number.
Definition 2.1. ([11])
In epidemiology, we take basic reproduction number/ratio, R0 , as the average number
of individuals infected by a single infected individual during his or her entire infectious
period, in a population which is entirely susceptible.
The reproduction number can be computed via different methods. We have taken the
next-generation matrix approach to compute the reproduction number as spectral radius
of the next-generation matrix K, that is,
R0 = ρ(F W −1 ).
Definition 2.2. ([1])
A point x∗ is said to be an equilibrium point of f , if f (x∗ ) = 0. An equilibrium point
x∗ is stable, if every initial point x0 which is close to x∗ has the property: the solution
F (t, x0 ) remain close to x∗ for all t ≥ 0. An equilibrium point x∗ is called asymptotically
stable if it is both stable and attracting. The point x∗ is unstable if it is not stable. An
equilibrium point x∗ is called globally asymptotically stable if it is asymptotically stable
and for all initial values converge to the equilibrium point.
Criteria for stability of a system of linear/linearized differential equation is given by
5

Theorem 2.1. (Theorem 7.2, [1])
Let J(x∗ ) be the n×n Jacobian matrix, corresponding to the system of equations ẋ = f (x).
If the real parts of all eigenvalues of J(x∗ ) are negative, then the equilibrium point x∗ is
globally asymptotically stable. If J(x∗ ) has n distinct eigenvalues and if the real parts of
all eigenvalues of J(x∗ ) are non-positive, then x∗ is stable.

2.1. Social contact matrix
We intend to mathematically model the spread of COVID-19 in India under the influence of various intervention strategies and control measures. In order to account for the
heterogeneous and local in nature contact patterns among various age groups, we consider a India specific social contact matrix of 16 age groups based on the Demographic
and Health Survey (DHS) data. Due to significant presence of asymptomatic individuals, there is a very high potential of rapid disease transmission. In view of mild or no
symptoms, the asymptomatic population would follow normal social contact pattern. We
incorporate the social contact matrix in our models for more realistic modelling of the
disease transmission and the impact of other control strategies.
Research using social-contact networks has shown its efficiency in measuring the transmission scale, and analysing the relative merits and effectiveness of several proposed
mitigation and intervention strategies [16]. Early epidemiological models were based on
population-wise random-mixing, but in practice, each individual has a finite set of contacts to whom they can pass infection; whereas, the essential service providers are prone
to higher degrees of contact out of which some of them may turn out to be super-spreaders
[40, 42]. Knowledge of network structures allow models to estimate the epidemic dynamics at the population scale rather than individual level. Several methods that allow mixing
of network or network approximation are reviewed in [27]. Detailed mathematical models characterizing early epidemic growth patterns incorporating inhomogeneous mixing of
population networks are reviewed in [8]. The heterogeneous social contact networks are
more likely to result in epidemic spreading than their homogeneous counterparts, thus
having a major role in determining whether an infection would turn out to be an epidemic
or persist at endemic levels [9, 51, 52]. Therefore, epidemic models with interventions
towards the goal of successfully preventing an outbreak need to account for social structure and mixing patterns. Contact patterns vary across age and locations (e.g. home,
work, and school), therefore, integrating them with the transmission dynamics models of
pathogens significantly improves the models? realism.
Let C(t) denotes the contact matrix of M individual age-groups at a certain time t. The
i j-th entry of the matrix C(t) represent the number of contacts of an individual in age6

group i with another individual of age-group j. By the reciprocity relation, the number
of contacts must satisfy
Ci j Ni = Cj i Nj , where 1 ≤ i, j ≤ M.
The contact matrix C consists of four component contact matrices, namely, workplace
(C W ), home (C H ), school (C S ) and others (C O ). Thus, C = C W + C H + C S + C O . The
contact structure data for India and its subdivisions are obtained from [43, 47, 49].

2.2. COVID-19 data source
The growth in SARS-CoV-2 infection is recorded for the available Indian data set. The
data may be influenced by different unavoidable constraints like variation in testing strategy and facilities of different states, nonuniform policies of state governments and public
awareness levels. But our model parameters are basically data driven, and intended to
predict and compute the total number of infections and death cases. The data available
at [25] are most reliable in terms of recording daily COVID-19 cases in India. This data
has been used in forecasting future transmission scenario; determining the rate and extent of infection spread; and determining the longevity and level of lockdown measures
along with the social distancing norms. Further, the available data with the mathematical model has been considered to understand the possibility of second wave of COVID-19
infection and its size.

3. SEAIRD Epidemic Model
Mathematical models have become important tools in analyzing the spread and control
of infectious diseases. Furthermore, mathematical models have been used in comparing,
planning, implementing, evaluating, and optimizing various detection, prevention, therapy, and control programs. In this section, we consider an SEIR type model for the
COVID-19 disease transmission with two additional compartments of population. One
of the compartments consist of asymptomatic individuals while the other one represent
the number of death cases at any instant of time. The entire population size N (t) = N ,
is divided into six distinct epidemiological compartments of individuals, namely, susceptible, exposed, asymptomatic, symptomatic, recovered from disease and died due to
the disease at any instant of time and their sizes are denoted by S(t), E(t), A(t), I(t),
R(t) and D(t), respectively. We assume that individuals enter the population by birth
or immigration with a constant recruitment as susceptible (S) and exit by death or by
infection as sub-case. We incorporate the social contact matrix in the SEAIRD model
via the incidence function to account for contact patterns among various age groups of

The modified SEAIRD model equations are
Ṡi (t) = Λ − λi (t)Si (t) − d0 Si (t),
Ėi (t) = λi (t)Si (t) − (χ + d1 )Ei (t),
Ȧi (t) = αχEi (t) − (γar + γas + d2 )Ai (t),
I˙i (t) = (1 − α)χEi (t) + γas Ai (t) − (γsr + η + d3 )Ii (t),

(3.1)

Ṙi (t) = γar Ai (t) + γsr Ii (t) − d4 Ri (t),
Ḋi (t) = ηIi (t),
subject to the following initial conditions at time t = 0:
Si = Si0 ≥ 0, Ei = Ei0 ≥ 0, Ai = A0i ≥ 0, Ii = Ii0 ≥ 0, Ri = Ri0 ≥ 0, Di = Di0 ≥ 0.

(3.2)

The model is schematically depicted by the transmission diagram in Fig. 1, where the incidence due to contact between infected individuals and susceptible population introduces
new members in the exposed class with β as the transmission rate on contact. Parameter
Λ denotes the rate of recruitment (birth, immigration) of new members to the susceptible population, whereas dj (j = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4) are the natural death rates in the population
compartments Si , Ei , Ai , Ii , Ri , respectively. The rates at which the exposed class depletes into A and I classes are αχ and (1 − α)χ, respectively. Further, the asymptomatic
class A transition to symptomatic class I at rate γas and to the recovered class R at rate
γar . The symptomatic infectious population either recovers at rate γsr or eventually meet
death due to the disease at rate η. All parameters in the model are assumed to be positive.
Feasible region for the system : In small time frames, a population may be assumed to
be free from demographic changes (birth, death, aging). Without demography our model
imply constant population in each age group. That is, Ni = Si (t) + Ei (t) + Ai (t) + Ii (t) +
8

Ri (t) + Di (t) is constant for all t ≥ 0, and 1 ≤ i ≤ M . If we assume demography, the
model is no longer conservative. Letting N̂i (t) = Ni (t) − Di (t), it is easy to see that

3.1. Basic reproduction number and stability
The basic reproduction number or basic reproductive ratio, R0 , is defined as the average
number of secondary cases generated by a single infectious person in a completely naive
population. Here, we introduce the next-generation-matrix approach for finding R0 of
SEAIRD model. From now on we remove the subscript index i while considering only
one age-group. By linearising the dynamics about the disease free equilibrium point
D0f ree = (N, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0), we obtain the transmission matrix, F , and the transition matrix,

Showing local or the global stability for nonlinear dynamical system such as SIR and
SIS type epidemic model were never easy for the researchers. People have tried multiple
approach and several years to show the stability of these models and prove them with
minimal conditions. The higher dimensional dynamical systems like SEIR and SEIS were
known to be globally stable at the disease free equilibrium (DFE) subject to R0 ≤ 1.
Global stability of the endemic equilibrium for these systems were conjectured when
R0 > 1 but remained open for a long time. This conjecture was solved by Li and Muldowney [35] in 1995. To establish this, they have used Poincaré Bendixson criterion in
three dimensions. Following this, the global stability properties of SEIRS type has been
improved by Fan, Li, Driessche, Wan [7, 17]. Thereafter, Korobeinikov and Maini [31, 32]
studied the global stability of SEIR and SEIS type models using Lyapunov functions. In
this paper, we discuss local stability results for DFE and endemic equilibrium. Recent
contributions [36, 37, 38, 46] may be referred for local stability results on epidemic models.
The stability analysis will support our mathematical model and the subsequent computational investigations. We now discuss local stability of the disease free equilibrium for
the SEAIRD model (3.1). For this purpose, we need to drop the demographic parameters
(natural birth and death) in the model.
Theorem 3.1. The disease free equilibrium point D0f ree is locally stable if R0 < 1.
Proof. To prove local stability of the disease free equilibrium, we need to establish the
stability of the system linearised about the equilibrium point. Therefore, it is enough
to show that the eigenvalues of the corresponding Jacobian have only non-positive real
parts. The Jacobian of the system (3.1) at D0f ree is given by

Since the rank of the Jacobian matrix is 3, its characteristic equation has three zero roots.
The non-zero roots, also three in number, are obtained as roots of the cubic equation
y 3 + a1 y 2 + a2 y + a3 = 0,

10

(3.5)

whose coefficients a1 , a2 , a3 are as follows:
a1 = γar + γas + χ + γsr + η

(3.6)

a2 = χ(γar + γas ) + (η + γsr )(γar + γas + χ) − βχ,

(3.7)

a3 = χ(γar + γas )(γsr + η) − βγar (1 − α)χ − βγas χ − βαχ(γsr + η).

(3.8)

By Routh-Hurwitz Criterion ( see, [30]:1.6-6), the roots of the equation (3.5) have negative
real parts if and only if a1 > 0, a3 > 0, and a1 a2 > a3 . From relation (3.6) it is obvious
that a1 > 0. Relation (3.8) may be rewritten as
!
βα(γsr + η) + βγar (1 − α) + βγas
a3 = χ(γar + γas )(γsr + η) 1 −
(γar + γas )(γsr + η)
= χ(γar + γas )(γsr + η)(1 − R0 ) > 0, if R0 < 1.
The last condition a1 a2 > a3 may be easily verified in some simple steps. Multiplying
(3.6) and (3.7), we obtain
a1 a2 = (γar + γas )(γsr + η)(γar +γas + γsr + η) + a1 · (γar + γas + γsr + η − β)
+a3 + βγar (1 − α)χ + βγas χ + βαχ(γsr + η).
In view of the above relation, we now need to show that the second term is positive.
From (3.4) and the condition R0 < 1, we obtain
γar + γas − βα > 0 and βγar (1 − α) + βγas < (γar + γas )(γsr + η),

(3.9)

since R0 is the sum of two positive quantities. Again, with the help of the inequalities in
(3.9), we obtain the desired inequality
γar + γas + γsr + η − β > 0.

Existence of endemic equilibrium point : We now discuss the existence of endemic equilibrium for the SEAIRD model (3.1) assuming demography. If R0 > 1, then relation (3.3)
result in the following inequality

βχ α(γsr + η + d3 ) + (1 − α)(γar + γas + d2 ) + αγas >
(3.10)
(χ + d1 )(γar + γas + d2 )(γsr + η + d3 ).
To obtain endemic equilibrium point for the SEAIRD model, we set S 0 = 0, E 0 = 0, A0 =

to see that denominator part of I ∗ is positive. To establish the positivity of I ∗ , first we
rewrite inequality (3.10) in the form
β(αχm + 1) > (χ + d1 )(γar + γas + d2 )m.

Theorem 3.2. The endemic equilibrium point D0end = (S ∗ , E ∗ , A∗ , I ∗ , R∗ ) of the SEAIRD
model (3.1) is asymptotically stable if R0 > 1.
Proof. As in Theorem 3.1, one may compute the Jacobian at D0end

In the next subsection, we computationally validate the effect of asymptomatic infections
in rapid transmission of COVID-19. The open-source python3 inbuilt ODE solver odeint
[23] has been used to simulate the SEAIRD model along with the social contact data of
16 different age-class available in [26], for all our computational results.

14

Figure 2: SEAIRD : Only symptomatic infected class is present without any lockdown (α = 0.0, β =
0.19, χ = 0.29, γas = 0.0, η = 1/30, γar = 0.0, γsr = 1/7, fsa = 0.1).

3.2. Asymptomatic and symptomatic infectious
A significant proportion of COVID-19 infections are asymptomatic in nature. Various
agencies have estimated the proportion of asymptomatic infections differently. On 21
April 2020, World Health Organization (WHO) declared about 80% of the total infected
population are asymptomatic. Later Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), India,
has declared 69% of COVID-19 infections in India are asymptomatic. Asymptomatic
individuals do not show any noticeable symptoms but continue to transmit the infection.
The basic SEAIRD model is incorporated with the social contact matrix, therefore, disease transmission by asymptomatic population would take place under the usual social
contact pattern. Whereas the symptomatic population may be assumed to transmit at
most 10% of the social contact pattern due to reduced contact levels. To understand
the contributions of symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals in further transmitting
the infection to the susceptible population, we distinguish the infected individuals into
two sub-classes asymptomatic (A) and symptomatic (I). First in Fig. 2, we consider the
model with zero asymptomatic cases, that is, all the infected cases are symptomatic and
obtain the corresponding epidemic evolution curve.
Next, we investigate the influence of asymptomatic infections A on the resulting epidemic
evolution curve. We assume that the contact patterns of asymptomatic individual agegroups are same as those of the usual social contact matrix i.e. C a = C. On the other
hand, it is customary to believe that contact pattern of symptomatic individuals would
be significantly reduced due to ongoing social epidemic prevention campaigns. Since
the contact rate of asymptomatic individuals is greater than that those of symptomatic
infected, we let C s = fsa C a , where fsa lies between 0 and 1. Let us assume a situation
15

Figure 3: SEAIRD : Both symptomatic and asymptomatic infections are present with no lockdown
(α = 0.8, β = 0.19, χ = 0.29, γas = 0.1, η = 1/30, γar = 2/7, γsr = 1/7, fsa = 0.1)

where 80% infections are asymptomatic and exposed to the susceptible subject to natural
social contact pattern. This situation leads to rapid spread of the disease and almost the
entire susceptible population gets infected as evident from Fig. 3. The susceptible curve
quickly falls to zero. Further, the active case peak size is almost three times the 100%
symptomatic infections scenario, see Fig. 2. A very important point to be observed here
is that when asymptomatic cases are more, the number of death cases is significantly
reduced. Furthermore, the peak of the active cases is attained around 140 days earlier as
compared to the purely symptomatic scenario. This indicates quick disease transmission
when asymptomatic infections are more in number. This model is perfect when no control
measures are adopted by the policy makers and when the population is very large in size,
like 130 crore in India. Then the active case count may hit 40 crore level and about
5% of the active cases, that is, about 2 crore individuals would turn out to be critical
cases needing ICU and ventilator support. Thus, overwhelming the hospital facilities.
Therefore, necessary control measures are essential to bring down the peak size of active
cases. One of them could be lockdown measures to confine the normal social contact
to home contact only. These measures have been adopted by most of the countries till
now. Estimating the expected impact of the lockdown, and the potential effectiveness of
different exit strategies is critical to inform decision makers on the management of the
COVID-19 health crisis.

3.3. Impact of lockdown
Rapid transmission and spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections across the globe has led to
a situation where more than half of the global population has been put through strict
lockdowns and other forms of social distancing measures. More than 90 countries, in16

cluding India has been under some form of lockdown simultaneously. This phase has
generated global economic turmoil and human miseries. In this context, modelling the
impact of various lockdown strategies is of paramount importance. Estimating the expected impact of the lockdown, and the potential effectiveness of different exit strategies
is critical to inform decision makers involved in managing the COVID-19 health crisis.
While in countries like Italy, Spain, Germany and UK, the peak of the pandemic occurred within weeks of the national lockdown. In India, however, 90 days have passed
since the lockdown was imposed, but the peak has not yet arrived. This indicates that
the spread of COVID-19 in India is not exponential so far but it is still growing. We
would like to understand whether a prolonged lockdown can just defer the advent of
epidemic peak or it would also reduce the peak size significantly and what would be the
percentage of reduction? A case study of China reported in [34], a significant increase
in doubling time from 2 days (95% CI: 1.9 – 2.6) to 4 days (95% CI: 3.5 – 4.3), after
imposing lockdown. Researchers also investigated the impact of lockdown in France [13]
and estimated the basic reproduction number at 3.0 (95% CI: 2.8 – 3.2) before lockdown
and the population infected by COVID-19 as of April 5, 2020 to be in the range 1% to 6%.
The average number of contacts is assumed to be reduced by 80% during lockdown,
thereby, leading to a substantial reduction in the reproduction number. But then question arises, can we extend the lockdown longer enough to bring down the number of active
case to zero. A study on France COVID-19 data [12], based on SEIR model observed
that the social distancing is not enough to control the outbreak. We can see in Fig. 5
that the lockdown can reduce the active case and also the peak may be deferred but full
lockdown can’t stop the growth of the epidemic. We are trying to see the influence of different lockdown strategies in a 200 days window. Full lockdown (100% implementation)
disconnect all forms of contacts and only the home contact is allowed, which is imposed
for 200 days. Staggered easing of lockdown, in Fig. 4, is made phase wise for 93 days only
and remaining days are fixed controls by only 20 percent lockdoown, which very marginal
and only for the containment zones. As per the lockdown strategy made by Govt. of
India there are five different phases until June 30, Phase 1 (25 March – 14 April), Phase
2 (15 April – 3 May), Phase 3 (May 4 – May 17), Phase 4 (May 18 – May 31), and Phase
5 (June 1 – June 30). These two lockdown strategies compare with 0%, 60% and 80%
uniform lockdown for 100 days.
Lockdown basis function: Lockdown implementation in the epidemic models is achieved
through the social contact matrix. For this purpose the contact matrix is assumed to be
a function of time. We consider a time-dependent control

where ton and tof f , respectively, denote lockdown start and end dates. Initially, the function value is ‘1’ and gradually decrease and meet at ‘0’ when lockdown is released. The
delay in implementation of lockdown is tuned by twon and twof f . Effectiveness of lockdown, expressed in percentage, may be controlled by parameter Pld . Partitioning contacts
into spheres of home, workplace, school and all other categories, the time-dependent contact matrix may be written as
Cij (t) = CijH + uW (t)CijW + uS (t)CijS + uO (t)CijO

(3.23)

where uW (t), uS (t) and uO (t) are the corresponding lockdown control functions on the
contact matrices of workplace, school and others. Fig. 4 is obtained by a suitable linear
combination of the control basis functions (3.22).
The observation in Fig. 5 in all cases except the staggered lockdown, can be seen clearly,
the peak of the active infections appear within the uniform lockdown period. With increased intensity of lockdown, peak of the infection gets delayed and also the peak size
reduces gradually. It is interesting to observe that when the staggered lockdown of 93
days (see Fig. 4) duration ends, the exponential growth of infections sets in and the peak
18

appears around 118 days. Delay in the advent of peak infection and reduction in its size
is significantly better in the staggered lockdown scenario, than that of all other uniform
lockdown scenarios except the unrealistic 100% lockdown case.
There are still some questions which need to be investigated and answered. For instance,
what is the optimal number of days for which the lockdown should be implemented and
what is the impact of lockdown for prolonged time periods. Again, the current model does
not have any scope for the interventions like the quarantine, hospitalization/isolation and
social distancing practices. In the next section, we also analyse the influence of various
intervention strategies on the real data which would eventually help us in estimating
relevant modelling parameters.

4. SEAIRD Model with Control Measures
In this section, we extend our SEAIRD model to an SEAIRD-control measure model by
incorporating two additional compartments of quarantined (Q) individuals and hospitalized (H) individuals, motivated by the works [10, 18, 19, 47]. A very important and
interesting feature of this new model is the reverse flow from quarantine class (Q) to
susceptible class (S) due to the preventive control measure quarantine, see Fig. 6. Later
in this section we will see the effectiveness of this feature in significantly bringing down
the infection levels. Let λi (t) denote the incidence function of the age group i due to
infected individuals from all other age groups. Then

We have already described about Ciaj and Cisj earlier. Here Cihj denote the number of
contacts of the hospitalized person in age group i with susceptible individuals of age
group j. The new control parameter ρ represent the effectiveness of hospitalization or
isolation measure applied on symptomatic individuals. The parameter ρ = 0, 0 < ρ < 1,
and ρ = 1, respectively, describe completely effective, partially effective, and completely
ineffective isolation measure. The epidemic age and contact-structured SEAIRD model
with control measures quarantine and isolation (or hospitalization) may be described by
the following system of ODEs:
Ṡi (t) = −λi (t)Si (t) + (1 − q)φqh Qi ,

Ėi (t) = λi (t)Si (t) − χEi ,

Q̇i (t) = α1 χEi − φqh Qi ,
I˙i (t) = α3 χEi + γas Ai − (φsh + δsr )Ii ,

Ȧi (t) = α2 χEi − (γas + δar )Ai ,
Ḣi (t) = φsh Ii + qφqh Qi − (δhr + η)Hi ,

Ṙi (t) = δar Ai + δsr Ii + δhr Hi ,

Ḋi (t) = ηHi ,
19

i = 1, 2, · · · , M,

(4.1)

subject to the initial conditions considered in (3.2) along with the additional ones Qi =
Q0i ≥ 0 and Hi = Hi0 ≥ 0. As usual i denotes the i-th age-group and parameters α1 ,
α2 , α3 are non-negative and satisfy the constraint α1 + α2 + α3 = 1. For the i-th agegroup, Qi (t) and Hi (t), respectively, denote the number of quarantined and hospitalised
individuals at time t. The transmission and transition parameters are described below:
β(t) = rate of infection due to contact at time t,
χ = rate of infected from exposed population,
φqh = rate of transition from quarantine to hospitalization,
γas = rate of transition of asymptomatic population to symptomatic population,
δar = rate of recovery of asymptomatic infected individual,
φsh = rate of transition of symptomatic population to hospitalization,
δhr = rate of recovery of hospitalized individual,
η = death rate of the population,
γsr = rate of recovery of symptomatic infected individual,
α1 = fraction part of χ from Ei to Qi class,
α2 = fraction part of χ from Ei to Ai class,
α3 = fraction part of χ from Ei to Ii class,
q = control parameter for quarantined class.
The parameter q describe the strength of the reverse flow feature, as discussed earlier, in
the model. Parameter values q = 0, q ∈ (0, 1), and q = 1, respectively, denote completely
effective, partially effective, and ineffective reverse flow. In our model, there is a latency
period or exposed period (1/χ days) after transmitting the disease from susceptible to
potentially infective persons but before these potential infectives gain symptoms and can
transmit infection, which is well discussed in [5]. We assume that no one gets the disease
during the exposed period. The exposed who are not quarantined become infective at
the rate α2 χ as asymptotic infections (A) and at the rate α3 χ as symptomatic infections
(I). The fractional part qφq h goes to isolated class and rest of the fractional part (1 −
q)φqh again moves back to the susceptible population, who are quarantined. From the
asymptomatic class, some individuals recover at the rate δar and some persons gain
symptoms at the rate γas . All the symptomatic members are monitored and leaving
from the symptomatic class to isolated class (H) at the rate φsh . Finally, all the isolated
members either recover (R) at the rate δhr or eventually meet death due to the disease
(D) at the rate η.

4.1. Controlled reproduction number
To find the control reproduction number, we linearise the dynamical system (4.1) at
a disease free equilibrium point (Si0 , 01×7 ), where Si0 = Ni , (1 ≤ i ≤ M ). Let Y =
[E, Q, A, I, H]T where each of the compartments E, Q, A, I, H represent M dimensional
vectors. From the linearised system (4.1), we obtain

trol reproduction number as it is guided by the disease control parameters ρ and q corresponding to the isolated and quarantined populations. Then Rc is defined as the maximum of absolute eigenvalues of the next generation matrix F W −1 i.e. Rc = ρ(F W −1 ). In
more realistic model, we need to consider the rate of new infection β as time dependent,
which will be discussed in more detail later in the social distancing subsection.

Figure 7: SEAIRD-Control : Figure shows active case profiles for different values of quarantine control
parameter q and fixed hospitalization control parameter, ρ = 1.0. The profiles are reducing in size when q
value changes from 1.0 to 0.0. The other parameters are as follows: αd = 0.05, β = 0.37, χ = 0.29, α1 =
0.7, α2 = 0.2, α3 = 1 − (α1 + α2 ), φqh = 1/10, γas = 0.1, δar = 2/7, φsh = 1/2, δsr = 1/7, δhr =
(1 − αd )/10, η = αd /10, fsa = 0.1, fsh = 0.1 under lockdown strategy of Fig. 4.

Effective control reproduction number : To find the time dependent effective reproduction
number Rce (t), we replace Ni by Si (t) and Ci, j by Ci, j (t) in the linearised system. Similar
to Rc , we compute the effective control reproduction number

Rce (t) = ρ F W −1 (t)
at any time t. One may refer Feng et al. [18] for control reproduction number of the
control model and how it is different from basic reproduction number. Again Feng [19]
has discussed the exponential and gamma distribution models of latent and infectious
periods due to Quarantine (Q) and Hospitalization (H) measures.

4.2. Quarantine and hospitalization as new interventions
In this subsection, we computationally analyse the impact of the control measures on the
epidemic spread. The contact matrix in the model is of order M (= 16), the number of age
groups. For each age group, there are 8 coupled Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)
in the SEAIRD-control model. Therefore, a total of 8M (= 128) ODEs are required to
be solved simultaneously. The open-source [23] python3 inbuilt ODE solver odeint has
been used to simulate the control based epidemic model. Our solver is a modified and
extended version of the python based open-source pyross [24].
The SEIR type mathematical models in epidemiology have been studied in the past with
control policies and validated with the real data. Those studies helped in choosing the
control parameters appropriately. Many SEIR type control models have been studied to
22

Figure 8: SEAIRD-Control : Figure shows active case profiles for different values of hospitalization
control parameter ρ and fixed quarantine control parameter, q = 1. The profiles shift from left to right
as well as reduce in size when ρ value changes from 0 to 1.0. The other parameters are same as specified
in Fig. 7.

measure the effectiveness of different types of control parameters. In 2003 Lipsitch et al.
[39] studied the control of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) spread from 2002
to 2003, by taking into account two interventions: (i) Isolation of symptomatic cases to
prevent further transmission and (ii) Quarantine and monitoring of exposed contacts of
active cases, so that possible new infections may be identified and isolated easily.
Fig. 7 depict the influence of Quarantine (Q) measure on the epidemic spread when
hospitalization is assumed to be completely effective, that is, ρ = 1. As q value changes
from 1 (ineffective quarantine) to 0 (completely effective quarantine), the active infections
peak size accordingly reduce. Next we fix the quarantine parameter at q = 1 and simulate
the control model (4.1) while varying ρ value from 0 to 1. Fig. 8 display the active
infections profiles for different values of ρ (0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0). One may see that
the profiles shift from left to right, indicating delay in peak arrival, along with peak size
reduction. A combination of this two control measures may lead to significant reduction
in active infections peak size along with delay in peak arrival.

4.3. Social distancing
Here we consider social distancing as a behavioural change in the general population,
which need some amount of time to successfully percolate in a society. As the epidemic
progress with increased intensity of infection, awareness level for social distancing norms
among the population also rises. Due to this behavioural change new infections rate
starts falling. To capture the effect of this behavioural change, we need to introduce
time dependent incidence parameter β(t) gradually decreasing with time. We consider
23

Figure 9: Here in the social distancing function
βmax = maximum value of β(t), βmin = minimum value of β(t), k = steepness of the function
or growth rate of the function, and tm = the midpoint of the sigmoid. This can reduce the contact
matrix or the rate of infection by βmax − βmin
fractions.

the logistic function as a model for time dependent incidence parameter β(t) and refer it
as social distancing function
β(t) = βmin +

βmax − βmin
.
1 + e−k(t−tm )

(4.3)

The parameters in (4.3) are explained in the caption of Fig. 9. We intend to model
the impact of social distancing practices along with lockdown policies. During strict
lockdown phase (80%), we assume that the impact of social distancing practices are not
very significant because the prevailing social contact pattern is essentially confined to
home. But as the lockdowns are gradually relaxed (< 80%), other forms of social contact
increase. This is when the impact of social distancing awareness and practices comes into
play. Therefore, we introduce social distancing function β(t) in our model during 60%
and subsequent lockdown phases with suitable time parameter tm .
We have seen the impact of the control measures quarantine and hospitalization in subsection 4.2. Their combined effect helps in further reducing the number of infections
and delaying the advent of its peak significantly. Thus, allowing civic and health authorities with minimum time to ramp up the infrastructure required for better managing
the ensuing epidemic outbreak. In addition to these control measures, if a large class
of the population develops awareness for social distancing and personal hygiene, the disease transmission can be slowed down further. In the next subsection, we simulate the
SEAIRD control model with social distancing practices.

4.4. Analysis based on real data
In this subsection, we numerically simulate (using Python based solver) the SEAIRD control model (4.1) laced with the social distancing function (4.3) and match the computed
results with real COVID-19 data of India till May 15, 2020. By matching the computed
results with the real data, we intend to estimate the model parameters to the best possible
extent. The lockdown policy in Fig. 4 is used to convert the contact matrix as a matrix
function of time variable. The initial time(t = 0) of the model (4.1) is May 04, 2020, that
begins with non-zero infection, and the computation is carried out for 300 days. There

parameters: αd = 0.05, ρ = 0.75, χ = 0.29, α1 = 0.7, α2 = 0.2, α3 = 1 − (α1 + α2 ), φqh = 1/10, q =

are three important rapidly growing daily counts named as active cases, symptomatic
and asymptomatic total, and hospitalized individuals and steadily increasing number of
deaths due to the disease, see Fig. 10.[a]. The active case count is seen to attain its peak
around day 163 (August 14, 2020) and about 5 % of the entire population is infected by
the peak day. Furthermore, 1 % of the population is estimated to meet death due to the
disease this year. Finally, the epidemic is seen to wither out after 300 days, diminishing
gradually in 135 days. The epidemic spreads with exponential growth for the first 50
days. Fig. 10 is again reproduced in a smaller window to show the match between the
25

numerically computed data and the real data up to May 15, 2020.
In Fig. 10.[b], we have plotted the numerically estimated growth of active cases in absence of both lockdown and social distancing function (‘Base line’). The ‘Base line’ is
seen to match with the real data only up to first 21 days before it gains its exponential
growth. Next, we have estimated the active case curve (‘Lockdown’) under the influence
of lockdown intervention. This curve is in agreement with the real data up to the first
45 days and then exponential growth has been observed. In another simulation run,
along with lockdown measure behavioural change due to social distancing practices is
also accounted for with tm = 49 days. Effect of this behavioural change is reflected in
the numerically estimated active case profile which agrees very closely with the real data
till May 15, 2020. Furthermore, the numerically computed death curve is also seen to
completely match with its real counterpart.
One may like to understand and compare the extent of reduction in infection peak size
and delay in its arrival for the two models proposed in Sections 3 and 4. If we carefully
observe Fig. 5 plotted for the control free SEAIRD model (3.1), the staggered lockdown
peak at nearly 17% is seen to be lowest among all other peaks (except the 100% lockdown
case) and also the most delayed peak that appears around 117 days. With the control
measures model, the active case peak is reduced by nearly 12 % followed by an additional
delay of 50 days in the peak arrival, see Fig. 10.

5. Lockdown Exit Strategy & Subsequent Waves
There are 29 states in India governed by democratically elected state governments. The
spread and impact of COVID-19 on each state has been radically different due to various
factors such as exposure to immigration, healthcare facilities, population density, urbanization, and the local government’s policies and strategies for the pandemic management
and control. Contact tracing and isolation [15] is one of the most efficient intervention
strategies to significantly control the infection transmission. However, this strategy is
not being implemented by the states uniformly. It can be efficiently implemented on
relatively small and moderately dense populations like Singapore, Hong Kong and South
Korea. For a large and densely populated country like India it may be possible to implement this strategy locally on a small scale due to relatively lesser number of tests per
million of population and shortage of man power in administration of medical services
[33]. Our model is not designed to study the contact tracing strategy explicitly but it
has been considered as part of our lockdown and social distancing strategy. Similarly,
border and travel restrictions are also part of the lockdown and social distancing strategy.
Accordingly the modeler would have the flexibility to choose the extent of permissible
26

social contacts during a certain time period in the entire course of the epidemic.

Figure 11: SEAIRD-Control : Subplot [a] depicts model simulation results under LD-I policy as in
Table 1 with social distancing parameters βmax = 0.379, βmin = 0.21, tm = 61, k = 0.5. Model
parameters are same as in Fig. 10. Subplot [b] display the agreement between real data and simulation
results of Subplot [a]. Also display the simulated active case trajectory (LD-I) where social distancing
is not considered.

Gilbert et al. [20] have described three different approaches to the exit plans of lockdown which primarily emphasise on a continuous process of intense testing followed by
de-confinement of population regions where herd immunity has been attained. Also suggest mathematical models are crucial to ensure that the proposed set of actions would
be safe, to make certain that the level of transmission and severe cases remain below the
healthcare system?s capacity. Some countries, like UK and Sweden, have envisaged that
early onset of herd immunity might be a good way to stop or control the spread of the
novel coronavirus. There are many reasons [48] to argue why herd immunity approach
is not very efficient in stopping or slowing down the spread of SARS-CoV-2 transmis27

sion, rather, entailing into potentially uncontrollable situation and significant increase in
effective reproduction number. Gradually releasing and re-establishing lockdown (when
active infections become too high) type on-off exit strategy is discussed in [44]. An analysis carried on UK COVID-19 data based on SEIR epidemic model reveals that on-off type
exit strategy helps in containing the critical cases below the available hospital facilities.

Lockdown (LD) Policies

LD-II

80%(21-41) — 60%(42-74) — 40%(75-92) — 20%(93-127) — 60%(128152) — 80%(153-192) — 60%(193-232) — 40%(233-359) — 20%(360-900)

Table 1 presents three distinct lockdown policies, namely, LD-I, LD-II, and LD-III over
a period of 900 days. Policy LD-I mean 80% lockdown implementation for 40 days starting from day 21 since the first reported infection (04 Mar 2020). The assumption of
80% lockdown is based on the fact that essential services remain functional. After the
first phase of lockdown, whole of India was categorised into either of three zones – Red,
Orange, or Green – depending on the intensity of infection. Red zones (80% lockdown)
correspond to containment zones; Orange zones (60% lockdown) for moderately infected
zones; Green zones (40% lockdown) for zones below some threshold infection level. To
represent the overall intensity of nationwide lockdown in India, we have considered the
28

60% Lockdown

Figure 13: Zone-wise lockdown and its averaging(Arithmetic Mean) is a part of LD-I

arithmetic mean of zonal lockdown intensities, which is 60%. Thus, in LD-I policy, first
phase of strict lockdown is followed by 60% and 20% subsequent lockdown phases of 540
and 300 days, respectively.
Similarly, one may interpret the policies LD-II and LD-III in Table 1. LD-I policy may
be referred as a strict lockdown policy implemented for a prolonged time period, whereas,
policies LD-II and LD-III may be pertained to an on-off type lockdown exit strategy as
discussed earlier. We analyse the impact of these lockdown policies in containing the disease transmission in India by incorporating these policies in our SEAIRD-control model.
Fig. 11 depict the trajectories of asymptomatic and symptomatic infections (A + I), hospitalised cases (H), total active cases (A + I + H), and death cases under the SEAIRDcontrol model with LD-I policy. The active cases trajectory is seen to have two peaks –
the first peak appear around day 300 and the second peak around day 700. Further, it
may be observed that the second peak size is nearly three times bigger as compared to the
first one and a gap of nearly 400 days between the two peaks. The advent of the second
peak, although after a gap of 400 days, suggests that the policy of strict lockdown for a
prolonged time period does not break the virus transmission. Rather, it accumulates a
large pool of completely naive susceptible population prone to get eventually infected in
a big way. Thus, a policy like LD-I, in addition to incurring heavy socio-economic cost
does not prove to be effective in eliminating the infectious disease. On the flip side this
policy presents a fairly long time period (400 days) for carrying out vaccine development
program and capacity building of the healthcare system. The effective reproduction number in this scenario starts its final descent after 600 days and eventually falls below 1, see
Fig. 14.
Fig. 12 displays the evolution of symptomatic infections under the SEAIRD-control model
influenced by the three intervention policy scenarios, namely, LD-I, LD-II, and LD-III.
In all the three scenarios, two infection peaks are observed. The peak size and position
of the LD-I influenced trajectory is seen to be in conformity with the trajectories in Fig.
11. With regard to LD-II and LD-III peaks, one may observe that both peaks in each
trajectory are nearly same size. The major advantage of LD-III peaks over LD-II peaks

to their lockdown policies and then how they are monotonically decreasing and finally became less than
one, when the pandemic has lost its strength for growth.

is the significant time gap between the two peaks. Therefore, LD-III may be perceived
to be an optimal lockdown policy. The effective reproduction number trajectories for all
the three scenarios are plotted in Fig. 14.
The basic reproduction number (R0 ) of COVID-19 has been initially estimated by the
WHO to be in the range 1.4 to 2.5, as declared in the statement regarding the outbreak
of SARS-CoV-2, dated January 23, 2020. Later in [29, 50], the researchers estimated the
mean value of R0 to be higher than 3.28 and median higher than 2.79, by observing the
super spreading nature and the doubling rate of the novel Coronavirus. Our effective
reproduction numbers are within the estimated range.

5.1. Discussions and challenges
Discussions: We have modeled and analysed the impact of general nationwide lockdown policies, quarantine and hospitalization measures, and social distancing practices.
It would be interesting to model the effect of local level intervention strategies, like
inter-state travel ban, shutdown during weekends, containment zones, multiple levels of
location dependent lockdown based on the intensity of infections and different means of
social distancing measures. At the outset it appears that lockdowns are being released
in phases but on careful observation one may notice that containment zones are still
under strict lockdown. This may look like a large part of the country is free from strict
interventions but it would be difficult to deny that on an average the lockdown intensity
in India has never been below 60% which correspond to LD-I policy as described in Section 5. Especially, if we restrict our domain only to the infected regions of the country,
then we may realise that lockdown in India has been strict for long time. As per our
model prediction the first wave in Fig. 11 will attain its peak by the end of December
2020 with over 12 million active cases and a possible second wave with much bigger peak
by the end of January 2022. The prediction of a relatively small first peak may alleviate the overwhelming strain on healthcare system of a large country like India. The
development of medicine and vaccine can only stop the second wave and its worst impact.
In our model the number of compartments are limited to eight. More realistic models
may have hundreds of compartments. With efficient computational algorithms like reduced order model strategies for faster and accurate computations one may arrive at
long term reliable prediction. This type of large pandemic model results are more closer
to the realistic data and helps in identifying the compartments and parameters having
greater influence in the epidemic spread or control. There are several possible compartments that we are interested to consider in our future work, like intra and inter-state
travel restrictions, regions where recovery rate is high due to better healthcare facilities,
multiple strains of the virus, transmission through droplets, availability of testing kits,
incorporating gender structure in the contact matrix, population density in urban and
rural India and lockdown releasing strategies based on age and occupation classes.
Challenges: There are multiple challenges we have realised during the simulation and
analysis of computational results while also targeting to match with the real data.
(i) The stability result for the SEIARD-control model is difficult to establish due to a
large number of parameters involved in it. Theoretical results on stability are open
for future work.
(ii) Theoretically, there is no proof of how and when the subsequent peaks will appear
after the first peak. Based on computational observations the possibility of a second
31

wave is predicted.
(iii) The model parameters are assumed to be independent of both time and age group.
If the model parameters can be estimated corresponding to each age group then
predicted numbers may change significantly.
(iv) As time progresses containment zones distribution also changes, and due to this, the
lockdown intensity varies with time and locations. How efficiently one can measure
the effective lockdown of a highly populated country at a particular instant of time
and its impact on the predictions?

6. Conclusions
In this paper, we have proposed a mathematical study of the evolution of COVID-19 in
India using the SEAIRD type epidemiological models. An improvised model that takes
into consideration various factors such as age-structured social contact pattern, lockdown
measures, contact tracing, quarantine, hospitalization, time dependent incidence parameter as another form of social distancing measure has been developed. The proposed model
is shown to match with the real COVID-19 data of India, active cases and death cases
till May 15, 2020. Further, we have studied the impact of three different types of lockdown policies with exit plans over a period of 900 days. Several interesting observations
are made in the process of fine tuning the mathematical model towards the twin goals
of capturing the realistic phenomena and making credible suggestions to policy makers
involved in the epidemic management. Here we summarise the observations.
(a) The SEAIRD-control pandemic model parameters are traced back to match the real
data for Indian COVID-19 cases.
(b) Effective reproduction number is computed for the SEAIRD-control model. Disease
free and endemic equilibrium points are proved to be locally stable for the SEAIRD
model.
(c) In Subsection 3.3, we have computationally established that slowly decreasing staggered lockdown is comparatively better lockdown exit strategy in terms of keeping
the infection levels low.
(d) The social distancing function in subsection 4.3 is another control function incorporated to slowdown the rate of new infection with time and account for behavioural
change in the population.
(e) The consequence of implementing strict lockdown for prolonged time period could be
the advent of a bigger second wave of infections, albeit after a fairly long time gap
and in the event of no progress in potent vaccine development.
(f) The staggered lockdown policies proposed in Section 5 are designed in such a way that
both the waves can be kept under control in order to facilitate hospital treatments
for the critical patients.
32

(g) Zone-wise lockdown policy implemented in India has been modeled to match with
the real data as accurately as possible. Our model prediction for July 20, 2020
is approximately 436,885 active cases whereas, the real data for the same date is
401,606.
(h) As per our study, peak of the first wave may arrive no later than the end of December
2020. The policy maker may not have enough time to control the second wave if there
is no progress in developing viable medicines or vaccines.
