Abstract— Bounce Back Loan is amongst a number of UK business financial support schemes launched by UK Government in
2020 amidst pandemic lockdown. Through these schemes, struggling businesses are provided financial support to weather
economic slowdown from pandemic lockdown. £43.5bn loan value has been provided as of 17th Dec2020. However, with no
major checks for granting these loans and looming prospect of loan losses from write-offs from failed businesses and fraud,
this paper theorizes prospect of applying spatiotemporal modelling technique to explore if geospatial patterns and temporal
analysis could aid design of loan grant criteria for schemes. Application of Clustering and Visual Analytics framework to
business demographics, survival rate and Sector concentration shows Inner and Outer London spatial patterns which historic
business failures and reversal of the patterns under COVID-19 implying sector influence on spatial clusters. Combination of
unsupervised clustering technique with multinomial logistic regression modelling on research datasets complimented by
additional datasets on other support schemes, business structure and financial crime, is recommended for modelling business
vulnerability to certain types of financial market or economic condition. The limitations of clustering technique for high
dimensional is discussed along with relevance of an applicable model for continuing the research through next steps.

Could application of Visual Analytics have led to a different
economic outcome from UK’s Bounce Back Loan Scheme
(BBLS)?
BBLS was launched in April 2020 [1] for supporting Small,
Medium sized Enterprises (SMEs) impacted by Coronavirus
pandemic lockdown. Until scheme expiry [2], UK businesses
from any location/sector could apply for loan of £2,000£50,000 (maximum 25% business’ turnover) from Accredited
Lenders [3]. £43.5 billion [4] is estimated to have already been
granted from which £15-£26 billion loan losses [5] are
estimated by National Audit Office due to failure of businesses
to pay back or fraudulent loan applications.
Aside from business owner self-certification, traditional credit
checks were bypassed for processing BBLS applications. Whilst
bypassing traditional checks could have been necessary to
expedite support for businesses facing challenges, potential
losses from future write-offs, frauds might have been
mitigated through an analytical decision making involving
historical business failure rates, sector concentration by
reviewing pattens for
•

What % of businesses fail every year i.e., would some
businesses fail even without COVID19?

•

Does business death rate change by UK Region,
Sector, Time?
What Regions, Sectors are more/less impacted by
lockdown and require more/less support from BBLS

Information needed for this research is available under - ONS1
historical spatiotemporal datasets [12] with UK business
demographics (Birth, Death, Active -Location, Sector); spatial
dataset [12,13] with Sectorial information by location; BBB2
spatiotemporal dataset for BBLS [14]; ONS1 business
sentiment [15] survey.
Visual Analytics applied to Baseline and Comparative datasets
is expected to provide insights into the efficacy of BBLS

Whilst research on role of visual analytics for governmentbacked financing schemes nor business lending assessments
by banks is available, there is evidence for application of
visual analytics on spatiotemporal datasets of mortgages,
network-guaranteed loans, government bonds to aid lending

Szulc et al. [8] et al used spatial correlation to assess impact
of credit rating changes on government bonds on the yield
on government bonds of neighboring countries and found a
statistically significant negative correlation using dynamic
spatial panel models on grouped timeseries and crosssectional data of ten-year government bonds and economic
factors (e.g., inflation, volatility, rating increase/decrease)
across 40 countries for 2008-2017 timeseries. Traditionally,
the yield on government bonds have only been evaluated
through credit ratings. Their research shows a geospatial
correlation of government bond yields
More generally, Adrienko(s) [9] discuss issues with standalone
computational methods and interactive visualization for
modelling real-world spatiotemporal datasets. They propose
a new framework for modelling such datasets through a
combination of clustering multiple spatial timeseries and
interactive grouping of geographic objects and spaces. The
proposed framework includes use of animated cartographic
displays, time graphs, interactive tools for cluster analysis and
statistical methods for modelling timeseries data applied on
transformed, grouped and filtered spatiotemporal datasets.
Yao [10] addresses similar issues by proposing an analysis
framework that involves slicing spatiotemporal datasets into

manually corrected. Regional and country information was
manually deleted from consolidated dataset, only
county/district information was retained. Quality of merged
database was checked using Violin and Timeseries plots.
Outliers highlighted by Violin-plot were manually reviewed
to assess if they should be retained or removed. Spatial data

Spatial Analysis & Pattern Identification – UK

Clustering - an exploratory unsupervised machine learning
technique, involves mining datasets for grouping similar/
dissimilar elements [16]. Clustering of spatiotemporal
datasets aid pattern recognition by enabling spatial feature
comparison of various clusters as well as study of specific
cluster for analyzing impact from temporal dimension
[17,18,19]. Hence clustering technique was applied to
compare patterns between Baseline and Comparative
Datasets.
K-means partition-based clustering method was chosen for
this research over Hierarchical (HC) and Density Based
Clustering (DBS) because of importance for including outliers.
K-Means method includes all datapoints for clustering
whereas DBS could potentially group outliers as noise,
distorting pattern analysis. Hierarchical clustering similarly
only considers grouping close datapoints without due
consideration for features. Though it could be used for
embedded cluster pattern detection in future as extension of
this research.
As K-Means method is not well suited for high dimensional
dataset [20], Principal Component Analysis (PCA) [25] was
used to reduce business demographics dimensions from 18
features to 2 [Fig3a] with 96% Explained Variance and Sector
classification from 16 to 2 features. Elbow method [21] was
used on reduced dimensional dataset to identify optimum
cluster size as 3 [Fig3b]

Cluster Evaluation - UK

Combination of higher Silhouette and lower David Boulding
scores were used for cluster quality assessment and
clustering method selection. Overall, three clusters were
chosen for Business Demographics and Sector Classification
datasets due to superior comparative scores. Three clusters

comparisons across all three datasets even though 2-cluster
scores were higher for BBLS [Table1]

for this consolidation
K-Means clustering was rerun. Quality checks for optimum
number of clusters [Appendix3] were performed by changing
the number of clusters and measuring combination of higher
Silhouette with lower David Bouldin score. Three clusters
were found as optimum for all datasets. Even though clusters
returned one member for two datasets, these clusters were
retained due to impact from its features. Based on visual
feature and cluster membership analysis for each dataset a

Pattern Comparison – London Region

To compare spatial patterns of historic business death rate
and Sector concentration with BBLS Loan applications across
all 33 London Boroughs, maps were plotted as per the three
clusters [Appendix4] with every Borough identified as one of
High-Medium-Low impacts separately for each dataset type.

Cluster filters were used to separate the Boroughs with
highest demand (average 13k applications, marked in “red”)
for BBLS [Fig5a] , highest rate of business failures [Fig5b,

concentration [Fig5c, marked in “red”].

To support spatial analysis through temporal dimension,
2004-2019 timeseries of Net (=new – failed) Business Growth
was plotted (Fig7a) for the High-Impact Boroughs to review
underlying annual business survival rates and identify any
discernible positive/negative trends that might have anyway
caused problems to businesses in 2020 even without the
pandemic. This highlighted 2009 and 2017 as years when

cluster colors exhibit decline in specific sector concentrations.
E.g., Accommodation, Public Concentration, Retail, Wholesale
concentration declined in Westminster in 2015 and growing
again in 2019. Similarly, sectoral concentration appears to
grow in other Boroughs. E.g. Camden with growth in
Accommodation, Education and Production. Such a timeseries
is useful to understand the temporal variation of Sector
concentration for researching its correlation with BBLS
applications.

Results

Geospatial cluster analysis shows businesses in Outer London
(OL) have been disproportionately impacted by COVID19
lockdown. Until last year 9 OL Boroughs, highlighted in Table
4a, had comparatively lower business death rates. However,
BBLS applications from these Boroughs have been higher.
Barnet is an exception in Outer London as its BBLS applications
appear to be proportional to historic timeseries trends of
business deaths [Fig8a].

Research motivation was to locate geospatial patterns to aid
decision-making process for government backed financing
schemes. Such patterns would help to model lending decisions
by segregating good businesses from bad business models and
help building a decision support system enabling sustainable
financing for economic growth model.
Initial application of clustering technique to UK-wide business
demographics and sector concentration helped identifying
three UK regions with high historic business failure rate.
London Region was chosen from this step for comparing
business death rates geo-spatiotemporal patterns with BBLS
applications.
Visual Analytics applied to London Boroughs clearly identified
geospatial patterns contrasting Inner from Outer Region
Boroughs for business death rates. However, when measured
through BBLS grants, Visual Analytics identified Outer
Boroughs with comparatively greater business impact from
COVID19 than Inner Boroughs. This spatial discrepancy
between pre- and post-pandemic business support need
indicates standalone clustering technique needs to be
supplemented with other parameters for defining future BBLS
eligibility criteria. Histogram plot of Sector information [Fig8]
encoded by cluster labels might mitigate help by identifying
concentration patterns of pandemic vulnerable sectors in UK.
However, the same sector (e.g., Retail) have been impacted
differently during COVID19 depending on operating channel
(e-Commerce vs Stores) and should be an additional
consideration.
Business Demographics Temporal analysis identifies 2009,
2017 with higher annual business deaths. Whilst 2009 is due

3. Financial support for businesses during coronavirus (COVID-19) - GOV.UK (www.gov.uk)
4. Coronavirus Business Impact Loan, 5. Standard Industry Classification

to aftereffects from 2008 Financial Crisis, 2017 should be
reviewed further (e.g., 2016 Brexit-referendum impact).
Sectoral Temporal Analysis identifies 2015 with dip for specific
sectors (e.g., Accommodation, Retail). This exhibits the
importance of temporal insights alongside geospatial
patterns. However, availability of only annual temporal data
doesn’t help in analysis of seasonality.
Iterative Visual Analytics methodology with geospatial and
temporal insights related to businesses has proved valuable
for identifying patterns through clustering thereby narrowing
focus of research from pattern recognition at National level to
specific Boroughs in London. Understanding of cluster
features would help in building future decision models.
Robustness of identified spatial patterns could be improved by
adding datasets from Government COVID19 Financial
support3 (e.g., Furlough, CBIL4), Business Models (e.g.,
turnover, distribution channels, workforce size), changes in
Consumer spending habits and Financial Crime (e.g., Fraud,
Money Laundering) datasets. However, adding more
dimensions would make clustering algorithm less effective.
Combination of Support Vector Machine with Guassian
Process for classification alongside Kohonen Self-Organising
MAP as visualization tool could be used for mitigating the
‘Curse of Dimensionality’ [23]
A Multinomial and Spline Regression model [22] could be built
from analysis of cluster features for government grants
decision making. Such models are used for Credit Risk
modelling in Retail Bank. The model could be trained on
London datasets and tested on the Manchester and
Birmingham spatiotemporal datasets that represents similar
level of business activities and BBLS applications. As the BBLS
scheme date has been extended till Jan2021, also depending
on pace of economic recovery post pandemic, this proposed
model could help in designing future financing schemes for
supporting businesses based on spatial patterns, temporal
trends, sectoral concentrations, business structures &
employees, consumer sentiments and financial crime
datasets.
