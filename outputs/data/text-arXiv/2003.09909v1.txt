Abstract
In this paper we propose a Susceptible-Infected-Exposed-Recovered-Dead
(SEIRD) differential model for the analysis and forecast of the COVID-19 spread
in some regions of Italy, using the data from the Italian Protezione Civile from
February 24th 2020. In this study investigate an adaptation of the model. Since
several restricting measures have been imposed by the Italian government at different times, starting from March 8th 2020, we propose a modification of SEIRD
by introducing a time dependent transmitting rate. In the numerical results we
report the maximum infection spread for the three Italian regions firstly affected
by the COVID-19 outbreak(Lombardia, Veneto and Emilia Romagna). This approach will be successively extended to other Italian regions, as soon as more
data will be available.
1. Introduction
The recent diffusion of the COVID-19 Corona virus has renewed the interest
of the scientific and political community in the mathematical models for epidemic. Many researchers are making efforts for proposing new refined models
to analyse the present situation and predict possible future scenarios.
With this paper we hope to contribute to the ongoing research on this topic and
to give a practical instrument for a deeper comprehension of the virus spreading
features and behaviour.
We consider here deterministic models based on a system of initial values problems of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). This theory has been studied

since about one century by W.O. Kermack and A. G. MacKendrick [1] that proposed the basic Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model. The SIR model and
its later modifications, such as Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR)
[2] are commonly used by the epidemic medical community in the study of outbreaks diffusion.In these models, the population is divided into groups. For
example, the SIR model groups are: Susceptible who can catch the disease,
Infected who have the disease and can spread it, and Removed those who have
either had the disease, or are recovered, immune or isolated until recovery. The
SEIR model proposed by Chowell et al. [3] considers also the Exposed group:
containing individuals who are in the incubation period.
The evolution of the Infected group depends on a key parameter, usually denoted as R0, representing the basic reproductive rate. The value of R0 can be
inferred, for example, by epidemic studies or by statistical data from literature
or it can be calibrated from the available data. In this paper we use the available
data for determining the value of R0 best fitting the data.
Compared to previous outbreaks, such as SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV [4], when
the disease had been stopped after a relatively small number of infected people,
we are now experimenting a different situation. Indeed the number of infected
people grows exponentially, and apparently, it can be stopped only by a complete lockdown of the affected areas, as evidenced by the COVID-19 outbreak
in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019.
Analogously, in the Italian case, in order to limit the virus diffusion all over the
Italian area, the government has started to impose more and more severe restrictions since March 6th 2020. Hopefully, these measures will affect the spread
of the COVID-19 virus reducing the number of infected people and the value of
the parameter R0.
The introduction of different levels of lockdown require an adaptation of the
standard epidemic models to this new situation. Some examples about the Chinese outbreak can be found in [5, 4, 6]. Concerning the Italian situation, which
is currently evolving, it is possible to model the introduction of restricting measures by introducing a non constant infection rate [7]. In this paper we propose
2

to represent the infection rate as a piecewise function, which reflects the changes
of external conditions. The parameter R0, which is proportional to the infection
rate, becomes a time dependent parameter Rt which follows a different trend
each time the external conditions change, depending on the particular situation
occurring in that period. For example, if new restrictions are applied to the
population movements at time t1 , we can hopefully argue that Rt starts to decrease when t > t1 .
Finally, we believe that relevant information is not only Infected but also Recovered and Dead numbers we modified SEIR model by splitting the Removed
population into Recovered and Dead.
In section 2 we describe the details of SEIRD model with constant and with time
dependent infection rate SEIRD(rm). Finally in section 3 we test the model on
some regional aggregated data published by the Protezione Civile Italiana [8].

2. Numerical model and methods
The SIR model proposed by Kermack and A. G. MacKendrick [1] divides
the population in three groups: Susceptible (S), Infected (I) and Recovered(R).
The equations relating the groups are the followings:
dS
dt
dI
dt
dR
dt

=

β

N
β
SI − γI
N

= γI

where N is the total population, β is the infection rate, a coefficient accounting
for the susceptible people get infected by infectious people and γ is the parameter of infectious people which become resistant per unit time. A more refined
model is the SEIR model where a new compartment E representing the exposed
individuals that are in the incubation period is added.

3

The resulting equations in the SEIR model are the following:
dS

dE
dt
dI
dt
dR

=
=

β
SI
N
β
SI − αE
N

=

αE − γI

=

γI

where α represents the incubation rate. The difference between the exposed
(E) and infected (I) is that the former have contracted the disease but are not
infectious, and the latter can spread the disease. SEIR has been used to model
breakouts, such as Ebola in Congo and Uganda [3]. In [2] the equations are
modified by adding the quarantine and vaccination coefficients. In our case,
unfortunately, vaccination is not available. A further model, the SIRD, considering the group of Dead (D) in place of the Exposed is analysed in [7] for the
forecast of COVID 19 spreading.
In this paper we propose a SEIRD model accounting for five different groups,
Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, Recovery and Dead. The system of equations is
given by:

dS
β

(1)

In order to consider the restrictions imposed by the Italian government since
March 8th 2020, we have partitioned the whole time interval [0, T ], considered
for the integration of (1), into two sub-intervals: [0, t0 ] and (t0 , T ] where t0
corresponds to time when the restrictions start to produce a valuable change

4

in the data trend. Moreover, since the applied restrictions should decrease the
number of contacts between Infected and Susceptible, we model the coefficient
β in (1) as a decreasing time dependent function β(t). A similar model for
the infection rate of SEIR equations can be found in [7], where the function is
assumed to have a decreasing exponential form. However, observing the data
trend, we believe that βt has a smoother decreasing behavior and we choose to
model it as a decreasing rational function:

 β
if t < t0
0
β(t) =
,
 β (1 − ρ(t − t )/t)) otherwise
0
0

ρ ∈ (0, 1).

(2)

In the present work we use a constant value ρ = 0.75 but we might calibrate it
in future. By substituting β(t) (2) in the S and E equations in (1) we obtain
SEIRD rational model SEIRD(rm).
We calibrate the parameters of SEIRD and SEIRD(rm) by solving non-linear
least squares problems with positive constraints. For example, in the SEIRD
model (1), we define the function u(t) = (S(t), E(t), I(t), R(t), D(t)), depending
on the vector of parameters q = (β, α, γR , γD ), and the vector y of the acquired
data at given times ti , i = 1, . . . n. Let F (u, q) be the function computing
the numerical solution u of the differential system (1), the estimation of the
parameter q is obtained solving the following non linear least squares problem:
1
min kF (u, q) − yk22
q 2
q≥0

(3)

where we introduce positivity constraints on q. The constrained optimization problem is solved with a trust-region based method implemented in the
lsqnonlin Matlab function. For further details about the optimization problem for identification parameters in differential problems see for example [9].

3. Numerical Results
In this section we report the results obtained by using the SEIRD model to
monitor the Covid-19 outbreak in Italy during the period 24/02/2020-20/03/2020.

The epidemic spread started on February 21st affecting the northern regions.
Lombardia in particular registered the first epidemic outbreak followed by the
Veneto region, Emilia Romagna the other Italian regions.
Since initially each region applied different containment measures to some restricted areas at different times, we chose to calibrate the SEIRD model on
each region separately. This study considers Lombardia, Veneto and Emilia
Romagna regions for which the largest amount of meaningful data have been
collected in the GitHub repository [8].
The purpose is to develop a model calibration and simulation method to be
eventually extended to all the other Italian regions reached by the epidemic
spread. All computations are performed using Matlab R2019b 2,9 GHz Intel
Core i7 quad-core 16 GB ram. The method consist of two main steps:
• Identification.

In this step the model parameters are estimated by

means of the trust-region-reflective algorithm implemented in the
lsqnonlin matlab function.
• Simulation. This step applies the SEIRD-SEIRD(rm) models with the
identified parameters in order to monitor the process for a longer time (up
to 240 days). The differential system is solved applying the ode45 matlab
function with the following initial condition: S(0) = N ,E(0) = I(0) =
Iinit ,R(0) = D(0) = 0 where the value Iinit corresponds to the Infected
individuals in the first measurement day.
3.1. SEIRD simulation
In this section we consider the SEIRD model (1) and use the following different measurement subsets from [8] relative to Lombardia region:
• S1 10 days measurements: 24/02/2020-04/03/2020
• S2 18 days measurements: 24/02/2020-12/03/2020
• S3 23 days measurements: 24/02/2020-17/03/2020

6

for identification of the parameters and than apply the identified parameters to
model the Infected-Recovered-Dead populations up to June 22nd (120 days).
Besides population plots in figures 1 ,2 we collect some meaningful quantitative
information about the model parameters (table 1) and the peak values for Infected, Recovered and Dead populations (table 2).
The results can be summarized as follows:

• The maximum Infected population is reached on April 9th 2020 for S1,
April 23rd 2020 for S2 and April 28th 2020 for S3.
• Concerning the values of the model parameters we have that the transmitting rate β can be estimated as βe = 0.3, the incubation rate α is approximately αe = 3 while the recovery rate is approximately (γR )e = 0.06
and the dead rate can be approximated as is approximately (γD )e = 0.04.
The following conclusions can be drawn:

7

• The SEIRD parameters, computed from the first 10 days measurements,
do not model properly the measurements. Indeed the plots reported in
figure 1 show that data of IRD populations have a slower increase rate,
compared to the model predictions.
• Considering the parameters obtained from S3 we observe that even if the
data fit is improved, the model does not seem to reproduce properly the
increasing slope of the Infected data, hence the previsions from this model
may not be entirely reliable.
Concerning Emilia Romagna region we have similar results. The plots in figures
3,4 show that the Infected population increase rate does not reproduce the data
correctly hence the peak values reported in table 3 may not be accurate.
The SEIRD model seems to be more accurate for Veneto region where the plots

table 4 represent the largest percentage of Infected and the longest time required
to reach the peak.
3.2. SEIRD(rm) calibration and simulation
In order to improve the data fit we split the parameter identification step
into the following two phase process:
• Phase 1 Identification of the parameters of the standard SEIRD model
using a the data subset S1, (i.e. up to time t0 = 10).

to the other regions which tests a larger part of population. Therefore the Infected people measured in Veneto contain a greater number of individuals who
do not have symptoms but can spread the infection. Following a recent study
on Wuhan Covid outbreak [10] the undocumented infectious can have a great
influence in the virus spread. These undocumented infectious often experience
mild, limited or no symptoms and hence go unrecognized, and, depending on
their contagiousness and numbers, can expose a far greater portion of the population to virus than would otherwise occur.
The improved modeling properties can be appreciated in population plots reported in figures 7 , 8 and 9. We observe that SEIRD(rm) reproduces the data
trends more precisely compared to the SEIRD model.

4. Conclusion
In this paper we proposed a SEIRD model for the analysis of the COVID-19
outbreak diffusion in Italy. In our new formulation the infection rate coefficient
has been adaptively modeled as an inverse function of the time, to take account
the restrictions imposed by the Italian Government in the social life on March
8th, 2020. The results obtained by fitting the data of three Italian regions,
Lombardia, Emilia-Romagna and Veneto, available since February 24th 2020,
show a very good fit to the data and give a prediction on the behaviour of
Infected-Re individuals. The forecasts about the maximum infection spread
report quite homogeneous results for both Lombardia and Emilia Romagna
(about June 20th), while Veneto has its infection peak around the end of July
2020, probably due to different testing modalities.
We highlight that it is only 12 days since restrictions started in Italy and, maybe
in the next few days, the effects of such measures will become more evident,
hopefully causing a further decrease in the infection trend. In this case, the
previsions shown in this paper should be updated by introducing a new time t1
at which the the decreasing slope of βt should change, for example by estimating
the parameter ρ in (2) with new data.
The proposed model is flexible and we believe it could be easily adapted to
monitor various infected areas with different restriction policies.
