Inferring the COVID-19 infection curve in Italy

Abstract Aim of this manuscript is to show a simple method to infer the time-course of new COVID19 infections (the most important information in order to establish the effect of containment strategies) from available aggregated data, such as number of deaths and hospitalizations. The method,
that was used for HIV-AIDS and was named ‘back-calculation’, relies on good estimates of the distribution of the delays between infection and the observed events; assuming that the epidemic follows a
simple SIR model with a known generation interval, we can then estimate the parameters that define
the time-varying contact rate through maximum likelihood. We show the application of the method
to data from Italy and several of its region; it is found that R0 had decreased consistently below 1
around March 20, and in the beginning of April it was between 0.5 and 0.8 in the whole Italy and in
most regions.

1 Introduction
The emergence of infections from SARS-CoV-2 first in China and then in many other countries of
the world has, at the moment, caused more than 100,000 deaths all over the world, and very severe
disease in a large number of people. Moreover, while the response to the epidemic with ‘lock-down’
strategies has probably prevented a much larger number of deaths and saved from dire consequences,
it is also causing huge economic losses that can affect the well-being of millions of people.
Thus most countries experiencing the lock-down have already started or are planning re-opening
strategies that could allow for a socio-economic recovery while maintaining the infections under
control. Such strategies will have rely on many factors: adequate planning of activities, in order
to maintain physical distances; large availability of testing facilities; technological tools that help in
tracking contacts of infected individuals; collaboration of citizens in adhering to the recommendations
of health authorities. In order to be able to handle appropriately the phase of partial re-opening, it
will also be crucial to have reliable and timely estimates of the trend in new infections and in the
reproduction number R0 .

Here we show how it is possible to obtain such estimates using publicly available data on deaths
and hospitalizations due to COVID-19 infections, and estimates of the delays between infections and
such events. Clearly, if one obtains reliable data from the health system or digital tools on many
other events, such as symptom onset or infection diagnosis, the method would yield more precise and
timely estimates. The method shown here could be adapted to many different information, as long
as estimates exist of the distribution of the time between infection and the event recorded.
The idea is very simple and was introduced in epidemiology at the time of the emergence of
HIV/AIDS: knowing the number of patients that during a certain period seeked care for symptoms
related to AIDS syndrome, one would attempt, moving backwards in time for the length of the incubation period, to ‘back-calculate’ the curve of HIV infections [6].
An important difference between HIV/AIDS and the COVID-19 infection, beyond the big difference
in the time-scales involved, is that it was generally agreed that (almost) all patients infected with
HIV would develop AIDS; hence, in principle, from the data on AIDS cases one could estimate the
actual curve of HIV infections of several years earlier. On the other hand, it is known that a large
proportion of infections with SARS-CoV2 are asymptomatic or mild and thus not diagnosed and not
reported.
Hence from the reported cases, one cannot recover the number of all infections, without other information. The output of the method will be an estimated curve of the infection times of the reported
cases. Assuming that the proportion of infections that are reported is constant in time, the curve of
actual infections will be a multiple of the estimated curve.
Italy was the first European country with a significant spread of COVID-19 infection, and has
been struck very severely with more than 20,000 deaths. We apply this method to the Italian data
published every day from the Protezione Civile. The method bears strong similarities with what has
been performed by Flaxman et al. [9] for several European countries, including Italy. In the Discussion
we will better explain the differences and similarities between our approach and [9].
Italian data on infections from SARS-CoV-2 have been recently analysed by [18]. Their method
of analysis was instead very different from what used here.
2 Data and information used
In this manuscript we use the data concerning COVID-19 infections in Italy daily published by the
Protezione Civile [2]. The tables report, for each region (NUTS-2 subdivision level) of Italy, the
number of daily new reported cases; the cumulative numbers of dead, of discharged patients, and
of swabs performed; the current numbers of hospitalized patients, of patients in ICUs, or in home
isolation. We decided that the number of reported cases is not indicative of the actual number of
infected people, as the number depends strongly on the testing policy, which has widely varied during
the epidemic. We chose to use instead the number of daily deaths and hospitalizations as useful
information to infer the curve of new infections.
As mentioned, the reported data include T Dt (total deaths up to day t) and CHt (currently
hospitalized patients), while our analysis is based on Dt (deaths in day t) and Ht (new hospitalizations
in day t). We used the following estimates
Dt = T Dt − T Dt−1

and Ht = CHt − CHt−1 + pDt + (T Rt − T Rt−1 ).

(1)

The first formula is obvious. The second one starts by taking new hospitalizations as the difference
between hospitalized of today and of yesterday; we have however to add all patients that were hospitalized yesterday and are no longer in the hospital: those are the discharged because recovered
(T Rt − T Rt−1 , where T Rt is the reported cumulative number of discharged) and the dead ones: it is
assumed that a proportion p of today’s dead were in hospital the previous day. In most analysis, we
will use p = 0.8, but the results are almost identical setting p = 1.
Finally, since data sometimes vary widely from one day to the next (possibly because of reporting delays), we regularize them through a 3-day mobile media in the past, Namely, we use
ht = 31 (Ht + Ht−1 + Ht−2 ) and similarly dt = 13 (Dt + Dt−1 + Dt−2 ).

Having decided to use as informative events hospitalizations and deaths, the method is based on
knowing the distribution of the time between infection and hospitalization; and of the time between
infection and death. We could not find in the literature direct estimates of these delays.
On the other hand, there are several estimates of the incubation period (time between infection
and symptom onset), and some of the intervals between symptom onset and hospitalization or death.
Assuming that the length of the incubation period is independent of the time spent between symptom onset and hospitalization or death, we can then obtain the required distribution by a simple
convolution.

Of the several existing estimates of the incubation period, we singled out those obtained by Linton
et al. [14] and by Backer et al. [3] shown in Fig. 1a.
Another important component of the method shown in the next Section is the distribution of the
generation time, i.e. the interval between the infection time of an individual and the infection time
of an individual infected by the former.
We found several estimates also concerning the generation time,. The ones that have been used in
our analysis are the one estimated by Ganyani et al. [10] using data from Singapore; the one estimated
by Cereda et al. analysing early cases in Lombardy [7], and that proposed by Flaxman et al. [9] The
three distributions are shown in Fig. 1b. Clearly, those by Cereda et al. [7] and by Flaxman et al.
[9] have a much heavier right tail than the one estimated by Ganyani et al. [10]. As the length of
generation time is influenced by the social context, it is possible that in Singapore the authoririties
were very efficient in identifying and isolating infected individuals, so as to avoid long periods of
infectivity. We thus decided to use only the other ones.
We found fewer estimates for the times from symptom onset to hospitalization or to death. Concerning the former, we found an estimate by Linton et al. [14] based on data from Singapore, and
one by Pellis et al. [16] based on data from UK, which are shown in Fig. 2a. Linton et al. [14] provide
also an estimate of the distribution of the time from symptom onset to death; another estimate is
proposed by Flaxman et al. [9] elaborating on estimates of severity [19]; the two distributions are
shown in Fig. 2b.
From the convolution of the density of the incubation period with the densities of the time from
symptom onset to hospitalization or death, we obtain f1 (t) (Fig. 3a), density of the time from infection
to hospitalization, and f2 (t) (Fig. 3b), density of the time from infection to death. Fig. 3 only shows
the values obtained, using the incubation period estimated by Linton et al. [14], as that has been
mainly used in the analysis.

3 Methods
Suppose that we know the density f of the time between infection and an event that is recorded.
Letting E(t) rate of event recording and j(t) infection incidence, and assuming that infections have
started at time t = 0, we have
Z t
E(t) = p
f (t − s)j(s) ds
(2)
0

where p is the probability that an infection gives rise (sooner or later) to a recorded event.
If E(t) is a known function, (2) is a Volterra integral equation of the 1st kind in the unknown p j(t);
under minimal assumptions, such equation has a unique solution, so that in principle p j(t) could be
recovered exactly.
However, first of all, E(t) is reported at discrete intervals, daily in the case of COVID-19 infections.

The second integral in the second line of (3) has been neglected, since typically f (u) ≈ 0 for u < 1,
while the inner integral in the first term is approximated with the midpoint rule. If needed, more
accurate approximations could be used, but the approximation in (3) seems adequate for our aims,
since many uncertainties exist on other aspects of the problem.
While, as stated above, there exists a unique solution p j(·) of (2), such a problem is notoriouly
ill-posed; thus, even small errors (or discretizations) in the functions E(t) or f (u) could give rise to
computed solutions completely different from the true solution. Regularization methods have been
proposed to obtain approximate solutions from a purely analytical approach [13].
Following the approach generally used in epidemiology [20], we interpret instead (2) from a probabilistic point of view, and we use parametric inference assuming that the incidence function j(t)
results from a standard epidemiological model.
Precisely, we assume that j(t) is the solution of
Z t
j(t) = β(t)
φ(s)j(t − s) ds + β(t)j0 (t).

Equation (4) is a simple modification of the model presented by Kermack and McKendrick [12]
(see, e.g., Diekmann et al. [8] for a more modern presentation and Iannelli-Milner [11] for a detailed
analysis) where j0 (t) represents the infectivity at time t of the infectives already present at t = 0
or introduced from outside during the epidemic, φ(·) is the infectivity kernel (density of generation
time in usual epidemiological terminology) and β(t) the time-varying contact rate. The susceptible
fraction does not appear in the equation, because we expect that, despite the high burden caused
by the COVID-19 epidemic, the reduction of the susceptible fraction has been very modest in these
months, except perhaps in a few small hot spots. However, a possible reduction in susceptibles would
be interpreted in (4) as a reduction of contact rate.
The two events that will be considered in this manuscript are deaths and hospitalizations due to
COVID-19. Letting Ht the new hospitalizations, and Dt the deaths reported in day t, we assume that
these are independent random variable, whose mean is given by (3) for an appropriate delay density
f.
Precisely we assume that either

Ht ∼ Poisson p1

(6)

In (5) or (6), j(·) is the unique solution of (4) where φ(·) is taken as a known function, j0 (·) known up to
a multiplicative function C and β(·) will be a function parameterised by some parameters (β1 , . . . , βm ).

6

Andrea Pugliese, Sara Sottile

Thus j(u) = Cj(u; β1 , . . . , βm ). Furthermore, f1 (·) and f2 (·) are taken as known functions, while p1
and p2 are constants to be estimated. Finally, when the negative binomial (6) is used, we take, for
the sake of simplicity, k, the dispersion parameter, as known (see below).
Then, with either (5) or (6), we have that E(Ht ) = C1 G(β1 , . . . , βm ) and E(Dt ) = C2 G(β1 , . . . , βm ),
where C1 = Cp1 and C2 = Cp2 . From the observed data {h1 , . . . , hn } and {d1 , . . . , dn } at the times
ti = t0 + i, i = 1 . . . n, we obtain a pseudo-likelihood function

where q is a parameter between 0 and 1. When q = 0, it is the actual likelihood based on the data on
dead patients, and L does not depend on C1 ; symmetrically, if q = 1, it is the likelihood based on the
hospitalization data, and L does not depend on C2 ; finally when q = 1/2, maximizing L is equivalent
to maximing the true likelihood under the assumption of independence of Ht and Dt .
The functions β(·) used in (4) have been chosen as cubic spline functions with knots at times
T1 < T2 < · · · < Tm (m ≥ 3) such that β(Ti ) = βi , i = 1 . . . m with the two extra conditions
β 0 (T1 ) = β 0 (Tm ) = 0. The reason for the extra conditions is that T1 has always been chosen as the
first moment in which cases in Italy were reported; it seems then reasonable to assume that, before
that, society was in normal conditions and contact rate was constant. Also near the end of the current
period of analysis, society seems to have adjusted to current ‘lock-down’ conditions, so that contact
rate is constant. Clearly, analysis of different period could suggest other boundary conditions, for
instance natural splines.
Since (4) is a time-dependent model, we cannot properly speak of the reproduction number R0
for that model. However, we can define R0 (t) as the value of R0 for the model, assuming that the
contact rate were frozen to the value β(t). Since in all the examples φ(·) is the density of a probability
distribution, we obtain R0 (t) = β(t).
Parameters were estimated by using maximum likelihood on (7), using the package bbmle of R [5].
Confidence intervals for all parameters were obtained with the same package using profile likelihood
methods [4].

4 Results
We applied the parameter estimation method discussed above to the Italian dataset. We chose as
reference final day of fit April 6, and start of the simulations on February 1, since it has been
establihed that around that day new infections started to occur continuously [7]. The function j0
providing the initial input to the model has been chosen to be equal to 1 (remember that the fit
introduces then a multiplicative constant) up to t = 2 and to 0 from t = 3 onwards.
As stated above, we estimated the function β(t) as a cubic spline with either 3, 4 or 5 knots. In
all cases the first knot was set on February 22 (the day after the information was released of the
first confirmed case of local transmission in Italy), and the last one on March 31 (a few days before
the final day). In case there were 5 knots the intermediate dates were March 3, 13 and 23 (general
lock-down was decided between March 8 and 11, depending on the localities, and strengthened on
March 23); with 4 knots March 6 and 18; with 3 knots March 13. Timings
First of all we tested whether there was a difference in data fit between the different choices of
delay functions. We show in Table 1 the AIC obtained with the possible combinations of functions
f1 (·) and f2 (·) and generation time φ applied to the Italian data (similar results are obtained with
regional data) fitting on hospitalizions and death data (q = 1/2).
It is apparent that the fit with the function f1 ‘Linton+Pellis’ and f2 ‘Linton+Linton” is much better
than with all alternatives; hence, only that one will be considered in what follows. On the other
hand, the model fit does not allow to discriminate the generation time distribution (also parameter
estimates are similar). For the sake of simplicity, we will only show the results obtained with the
function φ proposed by Flaxman et al. [9].

Most results have been obtained applying the estimation to the data of the whole Italy and
of three regions of Northern Italy (Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna and Veneto). The first two are the
regions with the most confirmed cases and deaths; Veneto is currently fourth among regions as for
number of confirmed cases and deaths, but was the second region where a case of local transmission
was identified; moreover, according to several reports, the response to the emergency was prompt and
effective, which shows also in the quality of reported aggregated data.

First we show the fit, using either the Poisson or negative binomial likelihood, to data of the four
geographic units (Fig. 4) and the resulting estimates of R0 (Fig. 5) with the corresponding confidence
intervals. To be precise, the confidence intervals refer only to the values in the knots (Table 2); the
curves are obtained by fitting cubic splines to the extremes of the confidence intervals, but do not
properly represent confidence intervals for the times outside the knots. The negative binomial was
fitted, assuming a fixed value k = 3 of the dispersion parameter, value chosen after some trials.

Fig. 5 Estimated values of R0 (t) for the whole Italy and three regions. The solid curves represent estimated values;
dashed curves corresponding confidence intervals (see text for details). The values obtained using the Poisson likelihood
are shown in black; those using the negative binomial likelihood in red.

One can see from Figures 4 and 5 that the central estimates are extremely similar for the two
likelihood; the main difference is in the confidence intervals that are much wider for the negative
binomial likelihood, as expected. From the AIC one should choose the Poisson model for the Veneto
region, and the negative binomial for the other units (although for Emilia-Romagna the difference
in AIC between the two models is not large). For the sake of simplicity, in what follows we will only
consider the Poisson likelihood, keeping in mind that the confidence intervals obtained are in any case
only indicative, since many statistical assumptions behind the computations are not really satisfied.
In Figure 6 we show (in logarithmic scale) the values predicted for new infections in Italy and the
three regions from February up to the beginning of May; all show a peak in new infection around
March 15-20, with somewhat different patterns. Note that all the values beyond the first days of April
are pure extrapolations with no statistical value.

Fig. 6 Natural logarithm of the predicted values of new infection. The predictions are up to a multiplicative constant
(an additive constant in logarithmic scale).

A second question asked is whether using data on both hospitalizations and deaths improves
the estimates compared to using a single dataset. We show the expected values of hospitalizations
and deaths in Figure 7 and the corresponding values of R0 in 8 for q = 0 (fit only on deaths),
q = 1 (fit only on hospitalizations), q = 1/2 (complete likelihood). Note that when q = 0, predicted
values of hospitalizations are irrelevant to the likelihood and are predicted only up to a multiplicative
constant; the program adjusts the constant to a reasonable value, but does not attempt to fit those
data; conversely, when q = 1, for death data.
Two conclusions emerge from this analysis: first of all, the results with q = 1/2 and q = 1 are
extremely similar, as the likelihood (7) is dominated (even for q = 1/2) from the larger numbers of
hospitalizations. The other observation is that prediction using only data on deaths are much more
unstable, especially for recent values of R0 (t); this can be seen by the large width (despite the choice
of Poisson likelihood) of confidence intervals for the last estimate of β for all region.
Concentrating only on the data from the whole Italy, we finally show the effect of the number of
knots (3, 4 or 5) (Fig. 9), and of the final day of fit (April 3, 6 or 9) (Fig. 10) on the predicted values
of hospitalizations, deaths and R0 .

Fig. 7 The points represent hospitalizations (blue) and deaths (red) from the whole Italy and three regions. The curves
are the fitted models with q = 1/2 (solid lines), q = 0 (dashed lines), q = 1 (dotted lines), blue for hospitalizations, red
for deaths.

In principle, the method can be used for data of any region. However, data from many regions
appear very noisy, especially when absolute numbers are low that it is very difficult reasonably fitting
a model to them. We only show the results obtained when applying the model to data from Piemonte
and Marche (the 3rd and 5th region for number of cases).
We fitted the model only to death data, although we stated that predictions that take into account
also hospitalizations are more stable, because hospitalization data seemed unreliable especially for
Piemonte (see Fig. 11).

5 Discussion
The main results obtained from this analysis are an estimate of the curve of new infections over time,
as well as an estimate of R0 . The estimates are valid also up to a few days before the final date of
available data, although clearly with wide confidence interval. The estimates obtained for R0 appear
to be consistently below 1 since the second part of March in the whole Italy and in most regions,
although there may be exceptions (some discussed below).
A recent publication [17] from the ISS-group has provided daily estimates for the effective reproduction number Rt for 6 regions up to March 12, using much more detailed data. For the periods and

regions when we could compare the two estimates (that actually are based on different assumptions),
the trends are quite similar, although our estimates obtained for the early epidemic phase are higher,
arriving up to 4.
The method presented here, which is essentially a back-calculation, is based on simple aggregated
data, and can be used on the most recent data, providing quickly estimates of the current trends,
estimates that can then be improved as more detailed data are available and analysed. Thus, we
believe that the method, although sub-optimal relative to an analysis based on more detailed data
(including for instance dates of symptom onset, and age structure of cases), can be helpful for public
health to provide quick and rough estimates of the trends in new infections.
As mentioned in the beginning, the method is conceptually similar to what has been used by
Flaxman et al. [9] for several European countries including Italy. Beyond technical differences (Flaxman et al. [9] used a Bayesian hierarchical model, calibrated to several European countries, which
is presumably more robust than our approach), the two main differences from [9] are the following
ones: Flaxman et al. [9] fitted only data on deaths from which, through an indirect method, they
were able to infer also the current number of infectives; secondly, in [9] it is assumed that the contact
rate is a piecewise-constant function that changed every time a new intervention was established by

the government, while we let the contact rate be a smooth function. While certainly each government intervention imposed a discontinuity in behaviour, we believe that using spline functions gives
more flexibility, and allows to estimate changes in adherence, due also to very frequent national and
regional decrees that adjusted the exact level of restrictions.
The estimates of R0 show a marked decrease already by the end of February, although a strong
‘lock-down’ was in place only in a very small part of the country (around 50,000 inhabitants) and
some closures (schools, movie-theatres. . . ) were in place only in a few regions (those considered here);
it is possible that spontaneous changes in behaviour [15] helped in decreasing R0 , although still quite
larger than 1.
It can be noticed that our estimates of R0 go consistently below 1 around March 20, more or less
in correspondence of the government decree that ordered the closure of all non-essential working
places. However, one has to consider that infections, when looked at this aggregated level, will always
show a certain inertia: as ‘lock-down’ goes in place, new infections in the community will strongly
decrease, but those that had already been infected will continue transmitting in households. It is
then possible that already the previous measures could bring R0 below 1 if left in place long enough;
more detailed data and models would be needed to solve the issue. Transmission within households
could also explain the apparent rebounding of R0 estimated for Emilia-Romagna near the beginning
of March (Fig. 5c).
Using data on both hospitalizations and deaths appears, as shown in Figures 7 and 8, to yield
much stabler estimates than using data from deaths alone; thus, we tend not to give too much weigh
to the most recent estimate of R0 > 1 obtained for the Veneto region, when only data on deaths are
used; indeed in that case the profile likelihood in β5 was not monotonic and, although the package
bbmle still computes confidence intervals, they do not appear very reliable.
As already stated, we did not consider data on daily positive tests. In order to use the number of
positive tests, we believe if would be needed to model how they depend on the number of performed
tests, and this seems rather difficult. We concentrated instead on data on hospitalizations and deaths,
as they should be less dependent on policy choices. It is certainly possible that, in the moments and
place where the sanitary system was under stress, requirements for hospitalization became more
stringent; in this sense, hospitalizations may not be purely depend on the health of the patients, but
also on the sanitary context.
Furthermore, a recent analysis of mortality rates in March suggests that the number of deaths related
to COVID-19 has been higher than the numbers reported, at least in some areas of Lombardy region.
Thus data on both deaths and hospitalizations may contain biases, but they are best data publicly

14

available. Data on daily admissions to ICUs could have been useful, but we were not able to extract
the information from the dataset.
We do not attempt to give an estimate of the actual number of infected individuals, but only of
the curve, up to a multiplicative constant. In principle, one could use the observed death rates [17]
together with estimates of the ‘true’ death rates to extrapolate the number of infections compatible
with the observed deaths as in Flaxman et al. [9]
Although it is mainly a technical point, our analysis allows to discriminate among the different
proposals for the distributions of times to death and hospitalizations. As can be seen from Table 1,
the model chooses the hospitalization kernel that gives more weigh to longer delays (red curve in
Fig. 3a) and the death kernel that gives more weigh to shorter delays (black curve in Fig. 3b).
The selected curves are such that the mean time from symptom onset to hospitalization is 5.12 days
(median 4.1) [16], while the mean time from symptom onset to death is 15.2 days (median 13.8) [14].
The data published by the Italian Health Institute [1] estimate a median tim from symptom onset
to hospitalization of 5 days, and from symptom onset to death of 10 days. This discrepancy between
the estimates we used and Italian data might explain why the distance between the peak time of
hospitalizations and of deaths is generally shorter in data than in our model (Fig. 4); the exception
is the Veneto region (Fig. 4d), where both peaks are well estimated by the model, possibly because
there the distribution of times are closer to estimates in the literature. One has to take into account
that our analysis is based on reporting dates; hence, the delays between hospitalization or death and
their reporting have also to be considered.
Clearly, results depend in an essential way on good estimates of delay functions, and on the assumption
they they are constant in time and among the regions. The method can be easily adapted to delays
changing in time, as long as data are available to estimate this.
We performed an analysis on how the results depended on some implementation details (such as
the number of knots in the splines describing the contact rates) or the starting day of the simulation
or the final day of data that are fitted. As can be seen (Fig. 9), the number of knots changes the
results very little; similarly changing the final date of fitting (Fig. 10) between April 3, 6 or 9 changes
the estimates only for the very final part of fitting; moreover, the differences in the estimated final R0
are minor, although extrapolating the simulations 30 days ahead they would bring quite a difference
in the predicted number of hospitalizations.
Looking at the crosses (data not used in the fits) in all Figures, one can get an idea of the short-term
predictive capabilities of the model.
One may notice that for a few days after April 6 the estimated number of hospitalizations have a
large increase, that appears inconsistent with the model and the rest of the curve. We found out that
the number of reported discharged patients in the four days between April 8 and 11 was over 2,000
per day, while previously it averaged around 1,000 a day with a peak around 1,500, and the number
decreased again from April 12 onwards. Since the reported number of hospitalized patients did not
decrease sharply, formula (1) estimates a peak of new hospitalizations between April 8 and 11 that
is very far from model predictions.
We can think of three explanations: perhaps data reporting was not precise, and several patients
reported as discharged between April 8 and 11 had actually been discharged previously, so that the
correct hospitalization curve would have a less sharp decrease after the peak around March 20-25, and
no peak between April 8 and 11. Another possibility is that a large number of patients was actually
discharged between April 8 and 11, freeing hospital space and thus allowing to hospitalize patients
previously in home isolation; in this case, the hospitalization peak of April 8-11 would have occurred,
but because of procedures of the health system. Finally, the hospitalization peak might reflect a peak
in new infections occured a few days earlier for unknown reasons. Probably the health authorities are
aware of the hospital situation, but we think that simple graphs like the ones presented here help in
identifying patterns needing an explanation.
Finally, one can look at differences among the regions. Results from fitting to data from the whole
Italy or from Lombardy are very similar, as expected, since around 40% of the cases in Italy are from
Lombardy. Veneto region presents curves with a much sharper peak, and generally the model fits very

Inferring the COVID-19 infection curve in Italy

well data from Veneto; this is probably due to the rather homogeneous spread of infection within
the region, and to a good quality of data acquisition and reporting. Emilia-Romagna is somewhat
interemediate in this respect, possibly because of the presence of two infection foci at the ends of the
region (Piacenza and Rimini). Data at the province level (NUTS 3) could provide a more accurate
picture (although the smaller numbers would amplify the effect of noise in data), but unfortunately
deaths and hospitalizations are not reported at that level.
A possible exception to the overall trends is given by the Piemonte region. There the infection
started somewhat later than in the other regions in the North, but by now it has reported the third
highest number of cases and deaths.
Despite our regularization procedure, the hospitalization data vary so widely from one day to the next
one (Fig. 11) that we did not succeed in fitting the model to those data, so that the fitting procedure
was applied only to data on deaths, that, as already discussed, provide less stable estimates, especially
for recent dates. With that caveat, recent estimates of R0 for Piemonte have been consistently above
1, and this corresponds also to the visual impression from data.
This is a case where the model fit is not optimal, but may raise an alarm bell, suggesting that more
detailed analysis are recommended for that region, in order to better understand the situation.
