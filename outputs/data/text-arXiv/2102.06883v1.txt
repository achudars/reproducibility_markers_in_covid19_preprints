Abstract
The coronavirus (COVID-19) is currently the most common contagious disease which is prevalent all over
the world. The main challenge of this disease is the primary diagnosis to prevent secondary infections and
its spread from one person to another. Therefore, it is essential to use an automatic diagnosis system along
with clinical procedures for the rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 to prevent its spread. Artificial intelligence
techniques using computed tomography (CT) images of the lungs and chest radiography have the potential
to obtain high diagnostic performance for Covid-19 diagnosis. In this study, a fusion of convolutional neural
network (CNN), support vector machine (SVM), and Sobel filter is proposed to detect COVID-19 using Xray images. A new X-ray image dataset was collected and subjected to high pass filter using a Sobel filter
to obtain the edges of the images. Then these images are fed to CNN deep learning model followed by SVM
classifier with ten-fold cross validation strategy. This method is designed so that it can learn with not many
data. Our results show that the proposed CNN-SVM with Sobel filtering (CNN-SVM+Sobel) achieved the
highest classification accuracy of 99.02% in accurate detection of COVID-19. It showed that using Sobel
filter can improve the performance of CNN. Unlike most of the other researches, this method does not use
a pre-trained network. We have also validated our developed model using six public databases and obtained
the highest performance. Hence, our developed model is ready for clinical application.

1. Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been spreading unprecedentedly across the globe from the
beginning of 2020. The clinical characteristics of COVID-19 include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough,
dyspnea, pneumonia, and fatigue during early stages [1], [2], [3]. The COVID-19 also affects the
cardiovascular and respiratory systems and may lead to multiple organ failure or acute respiratory distress
in critical cases and is highly contagious [3-7]. Therefore, COVID-19 infections are a crucial healthcare
challenge around the world and has become a global threat [8].
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a “public health emergency of international
concern” on 30th January 2020. Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is generally
used to confirm the incidence of COVID-19. But the sensitivity of RT-PCR is not high enough for the early
recognition of suspected patients [9]. Recently, deep learning techniques have exhibited great success in
the image processing domain, especially medical images, due to its potential of feature extraction [10].
Deep learning is used to discriminate and detect viral and bacterial pneumonia in pediatric chest radiographs
[11]. Chest X-ray is found to be effective in the early diagnosis and screening of COVID-19 [12]. This
non-invasive imaging modality can help to detect specific characteristic manifestations in the lung related
to the COVID-19. Hence, radiography examination may be utilized as a primary tool for COVID-19
screening in epidemic areas. Several imaging features can be extracted from the chest X-ray [13, 14]. In
heavily-affected areas and resource-constrained areas, chest X-ray imaging can be beneficial for COVID19 screening [15]. There are various advantages related to this imaging modality, such as rapid triaging,
availability, accessibility, and portability [15]. It is cheap and can be made available in most of the clinical
settings, even in low-income countries. One of the bottlenecks of the system is that expert radiologists are
required to interpret the radiography images. As such, computer-aided diagnostic systems (CAD) can help
the radiologists to detect COVID-19 cases accurately and rapidly. There are few deep learning-based
techniques proposed for such automated detection using X-ray radiographs [15-25].
The main contributions of this work are listed as follows:

New private database collected by the authors is used.
Data augmentation is performed.
Proposed model is tested using six public databases and the results are found to be better than most
of the existing state of the art methods.
Sobel filter is found to improve the performance of CNN.
Obtained highest classification performance for all databases.

Nowadays, machine learning (ML) methods are widely used for Covid-19. These methods can improve the
diagnosis accuracy of clinicians. However, there are few limitations in these methods. For example, feature
extraction is a challenging step in almost all ML methods. So, automatic feature extraction is a great
improvement in this field. Among the different ML methods, deep learning (DL) can solve this challenge.
It can do feature extraction automatically. In addition, when there are large amount of data, its performance
is better than other ML methods. Consequently, nowadays DL is used to diagnose different diseases [2632] such as COVID-19 [25]. An overview of the works done on automated detection of COVID-19 using
DL is presented in Table 1. In this table, the recently published DL works on COVID-19 detection using
X-ray and CT scan images are listed. However, almost all of them used pre-trained networks using public
databases.

This paper is organized as follows. The computer aided diagnosis (CAD) based on the proposed deep
learning to detect COVID-19 is described in Section 2. The results obtained is presented and discussed in
Section 3. Finally, the paper concludes with brief summary in Section 4.

2. CADS Based COVID-19 Diagnosis Using 2D-CNN
Nowadays, many CAD systems have been developed using deep learning techniques to detect various
diseases, including COVID-19, have attracted the attention of many researchers. The CAD based deep
learning methods require huge database to yield highest performance. This paper proposes a novel 2D-CNN

architecture to detect COVID-19 using X-ray images. The 2D-CNN with a number of convolutional layers,
max-pooling, and fully connected (FC) layers are used. In our methodology, support vector machine (SVM)
is used instead of the sigmoid activation function in fully connected layers to obtain highest classification
performance. The proposed CAD system is shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1: Proposed methodology used for the automated detection of COVID-19 patients using X-ray images.

As shown in Figure 1, X-ray images are first applied to the network. Then, the data augmentation technique
is adopted to prevent the overfitting and increase the number of input data. Then during pre-processing
stage, image resizing and normalization of input images are done. Then the preprocessed images are fed to
the convolutional layers of the proposed 2D-CNN network to extract the features. Then, the classification
operation is accomplished by FC layers by two methods: (i) sigmoid and (ii) SVM separately.

2.1. X-ray database
In this study, 333 chest X-ray images comprising of 77 images of COVID-19 patients and 256 images of
normal subjects were recorded at Omid Hospital in Tehran. They are collected from February 2020 to April
2020. The mean and standard deviation of their age are 49.5±18.5 years old. 55% of cases are female. Three
radiologists checked each image and determined whether a case has Covid-19 or not. Ethical approval of
these data was also obtained. Some examples of these data can be seen in Figure 2.
They show the typical X-ray images of normal and COVID-19 patients.

2.2. CNN architecture
Nowadays, 2D-CNN networks are employed in many medical applications, including the diagnosis of
COVID-19 using X-ray images [45]. These deep learning networks consists of three main layers,
convolutional layers, pooling, and fully connected (FC) layers [28]. The convolutional layers are
responsible for extracting features from images. Max-pooling layers are often applied to reduce the features
in CNN architectures. The last part of 2D-CNN is FC, and in the previous layer, there is an activation
function that is responsible for classification. Usually, the Softmax function is employed. The Sigmoid
activation function has been proved to perform efficiently in binary classification problems in this deep
learning architecture. The support vector machine (SVM) is another procedure that can be applied in 2DCNN instead of Sigmoid to obtain favorable results.
In this work, at first, the number of data is increased using data augmentation algorithm. Data augmentation
is done by using width shift range, height shift range, and rotation techniques. Using this method, the data
is increased from 333 to 1332 images. Then, a 2D-CNN with sigmoid activation function is used to classify
X-ray images. In addition, binary SVM is also used in the 2D-CNN network for classification. The hinge
error function is used to obtain best results when using SVM in 2D-CNN. More details about the proposed
2D-CNN architecture is shown in Table 2 and Figure 3.

2.3. Performance measures
In this study, to evaluate the performance of proposed methods, various evaluation metrics have been used
and they are given below:
Accuracy =

TP + TN
FP + FN + TP + TN

Sensitivity =

TP + FP

(3)

F1 − Score =

(5)

In these equations, true positive (TP) is the correct classification of positive class. False-negative (FN) is
the incorrect prediction of the positive case. True negative (TN) is the correct classification of the samples
in the negative class. False-positive (FP) is the incorrect prediction of the negative case. In this work,
positive class is symptom of COVID-19 and normal class is negative class.

3. Results and Discussion
In this section, the results of our proposed CNN-SVM and CNN-Sigmoid methods and its combination with
Sobel filter are provided. All simulations are done using Keras library have been conducted with back-end
TensorFlow. The COVID-19 X-ray images database is obtained from Omid Hospital, Tehran, Iran. In this
work, total number of 1332 (total images number is 333, which is increased to 1332 after the data
augmentation operation) images are used. The results are obtained in two modes: (i) CNN network with
sigmoid output layer and (ii) CNN network with SVM output layer with 10-fold cross-validation strategy.
In order to validate the proposed method, we have tested with another public database named as augmented
COVID-19 X-ray images database [46]. The experiment results are presented in Figures 8 to 15.
Figure 8 illustrates the results obtained using private database with CNN-sigmoid method with 10-fold
cross-validation. Figures 9 to 11, shows the private database results obtained by applying CNN-SVM,
CNN-sigmoid with Sobel operator, and CNN-SVM with Sobel operator, respectively with 10-fold crossvalidation.

It can be noted from Tables 3 and 4 that Sobel operator improved the performance of CNN-Sigmoid and
CNN-SVM approaches in detecting COVID-19 significantly. Table 4 shows the results of our proposed
method and other works on augmented COVID-19 X-ray images database. For better comparison between
the achieved results in Tables 3 and 4, the results are also illustrated in Figures 16 and 17. They show the
impact of using Sobel filtering in our algorithms. As SVM is a more robust classifier, when it is used in our
algorithms, the performance has improved.

Figure. 17: Performance obtained using different methods with augmented COVID-19 X-ray images database for COVID-19

Our proposed method is also tested with six public databases to evaluate the performance of our developed
model. The public database can be accessed from this link: https://www.kaggle.com [50-55]. The details of
the database and results obtained using our database are provided in Table 5. It can be noted from this table
that using the Sobel filter can improve the performance of our algorithm. In all tests, using Sobel filter has
a positive impact on the results. Also, CNN-SVM+Sobel performed better than others combinations. For
all databases, CNN-Sigmoid+Sobel performed better than the rest of the combinations.

Figure 16 shows the performance obtained using different proposed methods with our private database for
automated detection of COVID-19 patients using X-ray images. Figure 17 shows the performance obtained
using various proposed methods with augmented COVID-19 X-ray images database for COVID-19
diagnosis. Figures 16 and 17 clearly show that our proposed CNN-SVM+Sobel model has performed better
than rest of the methods on our database and augmented COVID-19 X-ray images database respectively.
Our proposed method has performed better even using six public databases.
Advantages of our proposed method are as follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.

We collected a new database to validate our developed model.
Our proposed method is also tested on six public databases and showed excellent performance.
Data augmentation is used to enable it works with small databases.
Sobel filter is used to improve the performance of our method

Limitations of our proposed method are as follows:
1. Computational cost of different deep learning algorithm is high.
2. Limitation of input data is another weakness of our algorithm.

4. Conclusion
COVID-19 is currently one of the most life-threatening diseases endangering the health of many people
globally. One of the main features of this disease is its rapid prevalence among people in the community.
In this work, we have developed a novel COVID-19 detection system using X-ray images. In this work, we
have used 333 X-ray images (77 COVID-19 + 256 normal) from Omid Hospital, Tehran to develop the
model. First the images are subjected to Sobel filter to obtain the contours of the images and then fed to
CNN model followed by SVM classifier. Our method is able to detect the COVID-19 cases correctly with
an accuracy of 99.02%. The developed model has also yielded highest detection accuracy using six public
databases. Hence, this justifies that our developed model is robust and accurate. In future, we intend to use
this model to detect other chest related diseases like cancer, pneumonia, cystic fibrosis, infection, and
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
