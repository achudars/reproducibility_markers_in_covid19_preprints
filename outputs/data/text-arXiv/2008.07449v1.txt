Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have
made a paradigm shift in health care which, eventually can
be used for decision support and forecasting by exploring the
medical data. Recent studies showed that AI and ML can be used
to fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, the objective
of this review study is to summarize the recent AI and ML based
studies that have focused to fight against COVID-19 pandemic.
From an initial set of 634 articles, a total of 35 articles were
finally selected through an extensive inclusion-exclusion process.
In our review, we have explored the objectives/aims of the existing
studies (i.e., the role of AI/ML in fighting COVID-19 pandemic);
context of the study (i.e., study focused to a specific countrycontext or with a global perspective); type and volume of dataset;
methodology, algorithms or techniques adopted in the prediction
or diagnosis processes; and mapping the algorithms/techniques
with the data type highlighting their prediction/classification
accuracy. We particularly focused on the uses of AI/ML in
analyzing the pandemic data in order to depict the most recent
progress of AI for fighting against COVID-19 and pointed out
the potential scope of further research.
Impact Statement The application of Artificial intelligence (AI)
has created a paradigm shift in healthcare. From disease detection
to pandemic forecasting, ubiquitous usage of AI has been proven
promising in healthcare. The recent novel corona virus: COVID 19
has thrown a challenge to the researchers and the health professionals.
Therefore, the researchers are seeking help from AI to fight the latest
pandemic COVID-19. In this review article we aim to explore and
analyze the research work that focus on the usage and application of
AI and machine learning to fight against COVID-19.

down the COVID-19 outbreak [2]. Therefore, various bodies have
committed themselves to conduct research focusing on COVID-19 to
support global response.
With new discoveries being announced at a breathtaking pace, artificial intelligence (AI) has re-emerged into scientific consciousness.
AI is a branch of computer science that can be used to build intelligent
systems. It is often instantiated as a software program [3]. Recent
application of AI in diagnosing disease s has broadened the frontier
of AI which once was a humans expertise. Medicine and the health
care systems are among the most promising areas of application of
AI which can be traced back to as early as mid-twentieth century[4].
Researchers proposed and successfully developed several decision
support systems[5]. The rule-based system gained success in the late
70s[6] and had been useful in detecting disease[7], interpreting ECG
images[8], choosing appropriate treatment and generate hypothesis
by the physicians[9]. Unlike this first-generation knowledge-based AI
system, which relies upon the prior medical knowledge of experts and
the formulation based rules, modern AI leverages machine learning
algorithms to find pattern and associations in data [10] [11] [12]. The
recent renaissance in AI can be attributed to the successful application
of deep learning to a great extent- training an artificial neural
network with a large number of labelled datasets. A modern deep
learning network usually contains hundreds of hidden layers[13]. The
recent resurgence of AI has been fueling a question of whether AIdoctors will replace human physicians shortly. Yet to be confirmed,
researchers believe that AI driven intelligent systems can significantly
help human physicians in making better and quick decisions and even
sometimes remove the necessity of human decision i.e. radiology[14].
The increasing data in health care resulting from increased use of
digital technology and the advancement of big data analytics can be
attributed to the recent success of AI in healthcare[14]. Although
AI research in healthcare is emerging, most of the research is
concentrated on three diseases: cancer, neurology and cardiology.
Guided by evidence, a strong AI can reveal the insight of the
medical data which eventually can be used for decision support and
forecasting[15], [16], [17].
As AI has been proved useful in healthcare, researchers suggest
that it may also be helpful in fighting against COVID-19. From forecasting of a pandemic to designing anti-viral-replication molecules,
AI has made a paradigm shift in health care. Recent research on
COVID-19 using AI suggests that AI can be helpful in detecting
COVID-19 infection, detecting infected population, predicting the
next outbreak, finding the attack pattern and even finding a cure [18],
[19] , [20]. The objective of this review is to explore the existing AIbased research that has been conducted to fight against COVID-19
pandemic. The organization of the remaining section is as follows.
The methodology to conduct this review study is discussed in section
2. The review data analysis and findings are discussed in detail in
section 3. Section 4 presents the main findings and the potential
scopes of future research to fight against the COVID-19. Finally, the
concluding remark, research limitation and future work are presented
in section 5.

II. METHODOLOGY
In this research, a systematic literature review procedure [21]
was adopted to attain the research aim. For selecting the primary

2

articles, the major databases such as IEEE Xplore, Springer Link,
ACM digital library, Science Direct, and Google Scholar were
searched for related articles. The search strings used to find the
literature were Machine learning and COVID-19, Machine learning
and Coronavirus, Artificial Intelligence and COVID-19, Artificial
Intelligence and Coronavirus, Artificial Intelligence and lockdown
and pandemic and COVID-19, Machine learning and lockdown and
pandemic and COVID-19, and Coronavirus prediction and outbreak
prediction and machine learning and artificial intelligence. These
strings were applied for all the above-mentioned databases as well
as Google search engine.
The search returned more than 634 articles. The exclusion criteria
include (a) duplicate articles that are found through several scholarly
databases; (b) articles that are not focused on our research objectives;
(c) the article was written other than English; and (d) the earlier
version of any article that has been published on the same set of
data and explored the same objective. After applying this inclusionexclusion process, we finally selected 35 articles that include original
research, review articles, and short articles including perspective,
commentary, and letter to the editor. The Prisma flowchart in Figure
1 shows the article selection process in different phases following the
exclusion-inclusion criteria.
The selected articles were reviewed systematically to extract
data primarily related to the article type, publication time, research objectives, study context, study outcomes/findings, methodology/algorithm/techniques used, dataset used, and study subject. Finally, the extracted data were synthesized and analyzed to summarize
the existing research on COVID-19 pandemic using AI and to identify
the potential scopes for future research.

III. DATA ANALYSIS AND FINDINGS
A. Type of Publications
To date (12th June, 2020) out of 35 articles, 27 (77%) were published as original research. Among others (23% articles), three articles
were the review articles, two were editorial and the remaining three
were published as research perspective (short conceptual article).
Again, 21 (60.0%) articles were published in academic journals, while
14 (40%) articles were archived as pre-print. Among the pre-print,
92.85% (13) were original research. All the selected articles were
published or archived in the online databases during January-May
2020.

B. Research Purposes and Objectives
We synthesise the existing research in terms of their purposes and
aims to explore the contribution of AI to fight against the COVID19 pandemic. A summary of the synthesized data is presented in
Table I to show the research scopes and purposes of the original
research. Most of the articles (n =16, 48%) were published focusing
to detect the COVID-19 infected patients using different AI-based
algorithms that include, for example, the Convoluted Neural Network
(CNN) model, Support Vector Machine (SVM), generative adversarial
network (GAN), and the transfer learning. The chest X-ray images,
CT images, mobile sensors data, and COVID-19 symptoms were used
to predict/detect the COVID-19 patients. These researches aimed to
identify, screen and detect the COVID-19 patients; and also to predict,
differentiate, or classify the patients into COVID-19 infection, no
infection, and other viral or bacterial infection. For example, Wang
et al. [22] proposed a CNN based prediction system named COVIDNet that identifies non-COVID-19 infected, COVID-19 infected, and
no infected patients using chest X-ray images. The proposed model
was pre-trained on ImageNet (open source) dataset and then trained
on the COVIDx (author- created) dataset that includes 13,800 chest
X-ray images of 13,725 patients that includes 183 images from 121
COVID-19 positive patients, 8066 images are of healthy patients and
5538 images are of non-COVID19 patients.
A total of seven (20%) articles focused on diagnosing COVID19 patients through AI (Figure 2). In these articles, the AI was
used to diagnose the identified COVID-19 patients to classify in
to patients categories (severe, mild) and tracking their progress[24],
distinguish COVID-19 from pneumonia [35], efficiently diagnose
COVID-19 using X-ray images[36], predict survival and death for
severe COVID-19 patients[37], identify patients who would develop
more severe illness [39], and to estimate uncertainty in Deep Learning
solutions to improve the diagnostic performance from PosteriorAnterior (PA) X-ray images of lungs with COVID-19 cases [40].

Fig. 2: Percentage of papers based on objectives
Two (6%) articles aimed to forecast the COVID-19 epidemic to
estimate the progress of the epidemic in terms of its size, lengths,
peaks, and ending time as well as predict the development trend of
the epidemic for the next certain time period in a specific country
or geographical region [18][41]. We found only one study [42]
focused the sustainable development that analyzes confirmed cases
of COVID-19 through a binary classification using AI and regression
analysis and explores the correlation among confirmed cases of
COVID-19 in four countries (China, Italy, South Korea, Japan) and
environmental factors (low, high & average temperature, humidity,
wind flow). An article [28] compared the prediction performance
of the proposed algorithm with the existing VGG-16, GoogleNet,
and ResNet50 method using two different subsets of data, while in
[43], an AI-based model is developed based on the existing studies

C. Context of Study
Some of the articles focused their research on specific countries
while others conducted research with a global perspective. A total of
10 articles (29%) focused on specific country as shown in Table III.
One of these articles considered confirmed cases from 34 provinces
of China for their research on a forecasting system of those areas
[18]. Another article focused on 42 provinces in Japan, China, South
Korea and Italy for environmental parameters, weather trends and
confirmed cases to measure correlations and also build a classification
model [42]. In one study CT scan of lungs from patients of both USA
and China [24] were used. In another study, CT scan of lungs only
from China [19] were used for training and testing automated AIbased tools for diagnosis and tracking. Epidemiological data of three
provinces of China (Hubei, Guangdong and Zhejiang), SARS 2003
epidemic data of all over China were collected and the prediction
was made for the whole China [41]. CT images of patients of Italy
were used as well in another study [28]. Data was collected from
only Wuhan, China in one of the articles [37] and Wenzhou city of
Zhejiang province in another article [39]. As we see most articles
concentrated on data from China as it is the original epicentre of the
pandemic.
Contextual articles focused mainly on epidemic forecasting and
sustainable development. Most of the disease detection related articles
and all of the recommendation type articles used global perspectives
as well as public datasets and are not context-sensitive (Figure 3).
Thus, it can be said that the disease detection techniques mentioned
in the articles are mostly not context-dependent; and for the epidemic
forecasting purpose researchers need contextual data. There were
two cross-country studies - one of them [42] focused on finding
correlation among multiple countries COVID-19 cases and the other
study [24] focused on two different country cases to enhance the
performance of their disease detection tool. Table III briefly shows
the details on the data used in these contextual studies.

D. Exploration of the Used Data Type
24 studies (68.5%) had used different types of data, ranging from
text to image, to corroborate their findings as shown in Figure 4.
The higher percentage (63%) with 22 original studies prove the
dependency of AI and ML based systems on proper data assessment.

Fig. 3: A brief on the context of data used by the literature

Seventeen (40%) of the articles used image data in the form of
X-Ray images and CT images of the chest. These images are mostly
used in disease detection and diagnosis. Seven studies (23.3%) used
public datasets among which four studies used the COVID-19 dataset
from GitHub repository created by Dr. Joseph Cohen, a postdoctoral
fellow at the University of Montreal. X-Ray images for other lung
disease patients, such as pneumonia, were collected from GitHub
repository, Kaggle repository and Open-I repository [52]. Two of the
other studies collected data from various hospitals from China and
the USA (Table IV). One study collected data from Societa Italiana
di Radiologia Medica e Interventistica [25], a hospital from Italy.
The other seven articles (20%) used non-image data, predominantly in the form of text and numbers with the purpose of disease
detection, epidemic forecasting, sustainable development, introducing
advanced concepts, and disease diagnosis and progression (Table I).
Thousands of data points were collected through a mobile survey for
a study [20] that included information related to location, age, gender,
race, travel and close contact to any affected person. Furthermore, the
study collected health data related to COVID-19 symptoms during a
period of 14 days. Clinical data including information on baseline

characteristics, medical history, COVID-19 diagnosis from hospitals
in Wuhan and other provinces in China were collected for disease
prediction and progression purposes. The study [42] used environmental and urban data accumulated from 42 different provinces in
China, Japan, South Korea, Italy to analyze the correlation among
environmental factors (low, high and average temperature, humidity,
wind flow) and confirmed cases of COVID-19. The study here
[41] used migration data and 2003 SARS epidemic for epidemic
forecasting of COVID-19. Finally, the study[47] used various research
papers and scholarly articles for the purpose of proposing potential
ideas to combat COVID-19 using AI.
We observed that nine (25.8%) studies used data that were collected from different provinces in China making China as the major
source of initial COVID-19 related Data.

E. Exploring the AI Techniques
Most of the research papers (n=29, 83%) aim to use AI to do some
kind of classification (COVID-19 detection, differentiate COVID-19
from other respiratory diseases) forecasting, and prediction (Table
I). The cost and time associated with the gold standard of testing
COVID-19: PCR - takes up to two to three days to get the results,

drive researchers to find an easier, cheaper and faster way to detect
COVID-19 using computational technique. Therefore, our study
found most of the research work (65%) aimed to detect and diagnose
COVID-19. Table IV briefly presents the objective, scope and the
results of using different AI algorithms.
COVID-19 has put researchers, health professionals at a critical
situation due to the lack of timely information and historical data.
Intelligent systems cannot work unless they are trained with reliable data. Application of AI and other related techniques: machine
learning, deep learning is done based on the previous experiences
i.e data and models. Given that very little information related to
COVID-19 are available, researchers mostly rely on X-ray images
and CT scan images. Although a very small amount of Chest-X Ray
(CXR) of COVID-19 is available, CXRs are prescribed as one of the
first diagnostic tests by the physician. Most of the earlier research
works use CXR images to detect COVID-19 (26.67%) and others use
chest CT images (Figure 4). The recent development of deep neural
networks has opened up a new frontier in image classification. We
found most of the research papers (43%) use different architecture of
deep neural networks (Figure 6) to classify images, both CXR and
CT scan (Table V). When it comes to image data, Convoluted Neural
Networks dominated over all other algorithms and techniques(Table

6

Fig. 4: Analyzing the Data used in the reviewed articles

Fig. 5: The percentage of literature used different data type
for different algorithm

IV). Using CNN as a base, several studies come up with their
architecture [22]. Our observation finds out among several CNNs,
the Res-Net architecture as the most used one (Figure 5). Using the
Res-Net architecture as a backbone, the models are different from one
another on several parameters i.e. several hidden parameters, epochs
and optimizer. Some studies also use a combination of different deep
neural architectures. For example, Ezz et al.[36] compared six other
different models with Red-NetV2 to propose the best one. Some
studies, for example, Wang et al. [51] use a combination of Res-Net
with other machine learning algorithms. The authors used Res-Net
for feature extraction from CXR and leverage SVM and decision
trees to develop a new algorithm. Other than classification, Biraja
et al.[40] use different architectures i.e. bayesian CNN, monte Carlo
drop weights along with Res-Net to assess the uncertainty associated
with applying deep neural networks to detect COVID-19. Due to the
pervasive use of deep learning networks and models, we have used
a separate a table, Table V to present the deep learning architectures
used and their results.
Other than deep learning approaches, traditional machine learning
algorithms have also been applied when it comes to non-image data
(Table IV). Using a combination of regression analysis and Group
Method of Data Handling(GMDH), Pirouz et al. [42] tried to find
a correlation and forecast based on demographic factors. Moreover,

Fig. 6: Literature frequency of different AI techniques

Yang et al.[41] combined epidemiological models with an ML model
to show the effectiveness of the disease containment in China and
predict the epidemic. With an addition to this, Loey et al.[33] used
neural networks (GAN network) for detecting COVID-19, whereas
Jiang et al.[39] used decision tree, SVM based algorithm to detect
COVID-19 from Xray images.
The authors depend on the train-test split method for validation of
their models as none of these models is used to test on real patients.
As a validation metric, the studies have used accuracy, specificity,
sensitivity, f-1 score and area under Receiver Operating Characteristic(ROC) curve (AUC). Among other evaluation matrics authors also
used False Positive Rate (FPR), True Positive Rate (TPR), positive
and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV respectively). Our
finding suggests that deep learning algorithms achieve a higher score
in most of the evaluation matrices (see Table IV, and V).

IV. FUTURE RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES
In this section, we have briefly presented the challenges and further
research opportunities on AI/ML not only to fight against COVID-19
pandemic but also for the future pandemic.

A. Importance of study context of future research
We observed that only one-third of the research (37%) used
contextual data while the rest (63%) of them conducted research

using data from more than one country. The countries or regions that
are affected more than others have more opportunities to conduct
contextual research. As China was the primary hotspot for the
pandemic, a comparatively greater number of contextual studies have
been conducted in China owing to the availability of more data and increased time to observe the nature of the pandemic. As the pandemic
progressed, data from other countries also became available. Hence,
there is considerably more scope for future contextual research that
will aim to explore and predict the similarity of the pattern of the
pandemic among Chinese studies and other regional studies.

B. Potential areas of research
The existing research has been conducted to detect and diagnose COVID-19, epidemic forecasting, sustainable development, and
patient management. We observe that a relatively small number
(11.4%) of research has been conducted on epidemic forecasting,
sustainable development and patient management. Further research
can be done focusing on these areas. We observed that studies on
epidemic forecasting and sustainable development used contextual
data. We think that epidemic forecasting based research should always
be contextual.

C. Collecting and storing various types of data
There are opportunities to collect different types of data (e.g.,
images, texts, videos, etc.) and making it available for the researchers
to conduct different experiments. Such efforts will be highly valuable
for fighting the pandemic.

D. Disease diagnosis and prediction research using a large
set of data
Most disease detection and half of disease diagnosis-based research were conducted using global data. However, we suggest
more research in this direction could use diverse global data in
the future for better performance. A few research studies (24%) on
disease detection and the other half research on disease diagnosis
also performed context-based analysis on specific regions. Hence,
future studies may consider other affected regions for disease pattern
exploration as well. It can be insinuated from the studies considered
in this review paper that a significant amount of data was not used
for conducting machine learning and deep learning research. Future
research could investigate if bigger datasets could result in better
structured, authenticated and generalized outcomes. Additional work
can be done to validate some of the original research studies ([25],
[43]) that did not use data and only proposed models. The claims
found in the studies can be explored more with sufficient data in the
future.

E. Exploring the effect and variation in research outcomes
based on different types of data
The majority of the existing research that has developed an AI/MLbased tool with the purpose of disease detection and progression
has employed training and testing methods. The methods, in general,
require related datasets to train and validate the systems to correctly
predict the outcome of a given problem, which in this case is detecting
the disease accurately. Several deep learning based research (48%)
studies have used chest X-Ray and CT scan images to determine

the presence of opacity in lungs that depicts COVID-19. However,
there are other lung diseases i.e., Pneumonia, COPD, Asthma etc.
due to which similar effects on lungs X-Ray and CT images can be
observed. Future studies can include other symptoms of patients in
the format of text to train the system along with the images of lungs
to determine COVID-19 from other diseases.

F. Explore the contextual effect and variation in research
outcomes
Only one cross-country research has been conducted with the
purpose of sustainable development, where correlation among confirmed cases, environmental and demographic factors of four different
countries were calculated and compared. Other cross-country research
studies, similar to the one stated above, could be pursued in the future
to determine if the virus spread depends on the environmental factors.

G. Managing the ICU surge during the COVID-19 crisis
It has been reported that the hospitals decided to provide service
only to the young people, leaving elder citizens who have less survival
possibility as the hospitals were out of capacity. Further research
can be pursued to predict which patient has higher likelihood to be
a critical case based on their medical history and symptoms. This
would help the hospitals determine which patient can be cured at
home and who will need ICU support. Research studies focusing on
ICU admission would be helpful on early releasing of some patients,
and thereby, leaving space for the patients who need it most. At the
same time, studies can also prevent early termination from ICUs.

H. Supporting the health care workforce
The lack of health professionals has been observed in highly
affected areas. They had to work beyond their limit making them
vulnerable to human errors. AI-assisted systems could be helpful
here. A rule-based AI can monitor all the data in the ICU and suggests

the professionals to take necessary steps. An efficient AI can help
allocate and control the flow of oxygen level: a crucial treatment
given to the COVID-19 patients.

I. Developing drugs/vaccine
Researchers all over the world currently have been working on
developing drugs and vaccines for COVID-19. Different organizations
have already been using AI to find a vaccine for COVID-19. From
data analysis to decoy generation of COVID-19, AI can be helpful.
Therefore, there are plenty of opportunities for improvement of these
AI algorithms (Rosetta[55] and Quark[56]). Furthermore, AI can be
used for simulation and analysis of different candidate vaccine.

V. CONCLUSION
This paper presents a systematic review of exploring AI and ML
techniques in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 35 research
articles were reviewed. These papers are analyzed and compared in
various dimensions including the data types, input features, the AI
techniques (the machine learning classification algorithms), as well
as their objectives. Overall, there are three main contributions of
our work. First, we have provided a summary of the findings in
terms of objectives, data sources, data type, and volumes. Second, we
have explored AI techniques that include various machine learning
and deep neural network techniques in the field and compared their
outcomes considering several popular evaluation metrics. Finally, we
have identified several research issues based on our analysis and
introduced corresponding new directions for future research.
Our study has a number of limitations, but at the same time, it
provides some avenues for future research. First, we have used some
specific keywords for searching the relevant materials. Although, our
search keywords provided effective results to achieve the goal of our
study, there might be a risk to miss some important materials that
did not emerge from our search queries. Second, we think timely
and up-to-date materials related to coronavirus and AI techniques are

9

the key things that we have identified, studied, and summarized in
this paper. Therefore, future works would be needed to collect more
resources. Third, in addition to exploring AI and ML techniques in
fighting the Covid-19 pandemic, future research can be conducted to
analyze data privacy and security in the relevant areas. Although we
have several limitations mentioned above, our analysis and discussion
can have significant implications for both the health practitioners and
researchers. We believe that our review opens a promising path and
can be used as a reference guide for future research in this area.
