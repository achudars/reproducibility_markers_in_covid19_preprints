Abstract
The spreading of virus infection is here simulated over artificial human networks. Here, the
real-space urban life of people is modeled as a modified scale-free network with constraints. A
scale-free network has been adopted in several studies for modeling on-line communities so far
but is modified here for the aim to represent peoples’ social behaviors where the generated
communities are restricted reflecting the spatiotemporal constraints in the real life. Furthermore,
the networks have been extended by introducing multiple cliques in the initial step of network
construction and enabling people to contact hidden (zero-degree) people as well as popular
(large degree) people. As a result, four findings and a policy proposal have been obtained.
First, the “second waves” have been observed in the simulations even without external
influence or constraints on peoples’ contacts or the releasing of the constraints. These second
waves tend to be lower than the first wave and to be caused in the “fresh” clusters i.e. by the
infection of people who are connected in the network but had not been infected. This implies
the bridges between infected and fresh clusters may trigger new expansions of spreading.
Second, if the network changes the structure on the way of infection spreading or after its
suppression, the peak of the second wave can be larger than the first. Third, the peak height in
the time series of the number of infection cases depends on the difference between the upper
bound of the number of people each member accepts to meet and the number of people one
chooses to meet. This tendency is observed for two kinds of artificial networks introduced here
and implies the impact of the bridges between communities on the virus spreading. Fourth, the
release of once given constraint may trigger a second wave higher than the peak of the time
series without introducing any constraint from the beginning, if the release is introduced at a
time close to the peak. Thus, all in all, both the government and individuals should be careful
in returning to human society with inter-community contacts.

Introduction
Predicting the spread of infection during a pandemic and taking appropriate precautions are
critical components in finding the best solution to a major public health challenge. The novel
coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), which was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China around
December 2019, spread rapidly throughout the world, causing Covid-19 disease. The disease
was relatively quickly declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) and, as
of May 2020, over 375,000 deaths had occurred and more than 6.2 million cases in 110
countries had been confirmed. In this context, various measures for the prevention of infection
have been presented by the authorities in each country, mostly following WHO
recommendations. In addition to personal preventive measures such as handwashing and
wearing face masks, social preventive measures such as physical distancing and drastically
restricted individual movements (lockdowns) were implemented. Such preventive measures
were implemented by several authorities, with varying degrees of success, depending on how
well they were implemented. However, the uninformed still ask questions such as “Is the
disease spread suppressed as expected when people reduce their contacts with others? If so,
whom should we avoid to contact?”
In this paper, we detail a model based on a simulation of infection spreading in a social network
of people in an urban environment for obtaining effective prevention measures to answer such
questions as above. The reason why we use the social network model instead of the population
models with differential equations such as the SIR models is that we aim to clarify the effects
of actions of people that generate, prune, or perturb local connections with neighbors so that
we acquire knowledge about measures for preventing infection spread. This benefit of the
network-based model has been pointed out in [1], where the difference from population-based

models (such as SIR [2] and its extensions [3-7]), the effects of preventive actions such as a
lock-down and its release and of infections via edges bridging far-apart nodes on infection
spread has been evaluated.
Various network models of infection have been built to predict the spread of infection and allow
informed decision making with regard to control and prevention [8–12]. For example, in [8],
the dynamics have been modeled to explain the increase of infections in the early stage based
on the power-law followed by exponential suppression. This model has been used and extended
to obtain an indicator of a failure of the current containment eﬀorts or the beginnings of the end
of the pandemic [9], and to compare the temporal trends of daily cases in countries [10].
Strategies for network manipulation have also been explored, one of which is the control of the
dynamics of disease spread via interacting with features of a disease network, such as infection
rate [11], while another is network optimization by removing/rewiring links that represent an
NP-hard problem [12]. The solutions for these problems include a top-down (e.g. to suppress
infection rates) and a bottom approach (e.g. to enable individuals to discern the critical innetwork contacts). Thus, working on network dynamics contributes to providing points to
consider in designing policies for controlling epidemic spreading. The guidelines for attention
and actions obtained from such research could be useful for designing policies for controlling
epidemics in a timely fashion.
A lot is known about general theories applicable to various propagation phenomena in a social
network. For example, it has been found that the cascades in skewed human networks are
triggered by large degree nodes, whereas small degree nodes may trigger cascades in other
networks [13]. In [14], the diffusion of innovation has been simulated in artificial social
networks resulting in delayed propagation to low-degree nodes from high-degree nodes, which
is of a greater impact if informative and nominal contacts from neighboring nodes are mixed.
The authors’ express an interest in the mutual influence between high-degree nodes and lowdegree nodes, in which the role of the latter becomes focused. An encouraging trend nowadays
is that the authors of [9] and [14], as well as others working on network dynamics, are
contributing valuable information to help determine optimal intervention strategies [15].
In our simulated society, we assume that people become interested in attending a place where
a lot of other individuals gather. This action may be directed not only to other people in the
place in particular, but also to something that is of special attraction, either abstract or real. In
this place, a new person attending may come into close contact with other humans, touch
objects, and breathe the air in the place. These are similar elements seen in the social dynamics
known to form a scale-free network [16] where new nodes get connected to high-degree nodes.
However, there are real-space and real-time constraints on the dynamics that are 1: the
restriction of time and the capacity of one’s interest (W: the number of other people each person
can meet after all), 2: the restriction of space (W may be interpreted as the area or volume of a
meeting place), 3: the interest in meeting other people (m0: the number of other people each
person meets by choice, either singly or in a group). In this paper, we aim to find some clues to
further the discussion using simple simulations involving two kinds of constrained scale-free
networks (SFN). From the simulated cases varying W and m0, we reach a finding of the effects
of bridges between communities on the infection expansion that is intuitively understandable
to uninformed people who desire a preventive measure an individual can take.

Materials and methods
The hypothesis
Each snapshot in Figure 1 shows a social network. Each node represents a human, a place, or a
thing in the place. Each edge represents a possibility that the entities represented by the two
nodes can interact. Each cluster in Figure 1 with thick solid edges means a group of people who
choose to meet each other. People in such a group are connected mutually via strong ties,
whereas the thin lines represent weaker ties between the groups via peoples’ personal interests
in external activities. Here, the red nodes represent people who have the current infectivity to
others who are chosen randomly by probability p. The blue nodes have not yet infected, and
the green nodes represent people who lost the infectivity to others.
Here, we set the following four hypotheses based on networked models of society.
Hypothesis 1: Heights of the peaks of the number of infection cases in the time sequence depend
on the upper bound of the number of people each member accepts to meet (W), and the curve
of this dependency varies on the number of people one chooses to meet (m0).
Hypothesis 2: The new waves, e.g., the second wave, of infection spreading may occur without
external events such as an increase of in-bound travelers or a release of the governmental
constraints on peoples’ contacts.
Hypothesis 3: The change in the social structure i.e., each person’s choice of whom to meet,
can be a trigger of a wide infection spreading.
Hypothesis 4: The release of the constraints on peoples’ contacts can cause a wide infection
spreading, if the release is introduced too early.
Hypothesis 1 can be understood by viewing the simplest Scenario A in Fig 1. As shown in the
top-right of Fig.1, W corresponds to all the edges connected to the member, and m0 corresponds
to the number of thick solid edges in a cluster (minus one as in Fig.1, for a cluster to be obtained
in the initial step in the Algorithms 2 and 3 mentioned later). A cluster can be regarded as a
community of people. The value of W–m0 represents the width of the bridge between
communities corresponding to the number of thin edges between clusters in Fig.1 and plays the
role to enable virus infections from one to other communities. For a larger W– m0, the peak of
infection cases increases because the infection spreads via strong tie quickly.
Hypothesis 2 corresponds to Scenario B in Fig 1. Here, due to a small extension of reproductive
period of the arrowed node, the virus gets infected to new communities. As a result, people
(nodes) in a new community get infected, which results in the appearance of a new wave.
Hypothesis 3 corresponding to Scenario C of Fig 1 considers the movement of edges to connect
infected people having the infectivity and non-infected people who have not yet acquired
immunity. Hypothesis 4 corresponds to Scenario D1 and D2, where the restriction on the
contacts of people is released and causes edges to emerge. If time has passed after the peak of
infection spread by the time of release, as in Scenario D1, the expansion will not be as severe
as in Scenario D2 because a certain portion of people in the community have already been
infected. In Scenario D2, the restriction is released at a time when fresh (most part is free from
infection yet) clusters still exist with links to infected people.

Fig 1. The four scenarios of infection spreading in a social network. This figure shows a
simplified conceptual graph. For example, the clusters generated initially should be
smaller than ones generated later in Algorithms 2 and 3 mentioned later.

Scale-free network as the backbone
The established model to generate a scale-free network (SFN) [16] is described as
follows. Hereafter, N means the number of nodes to be finally included in the society.
V and E mean the sets of nodes and edges in the graph respectively, of which the combination
is defined to be the graph G. The graph G starts from a clique of m0 nodes and incremented by
adding one node_i at each time. Then nodes other than m0 nodes are chosen as new link
destinations from node_i according to the probabilities given in proportion to the node degrees.
Here, m0 is the initial degree of each node (the number of edges connected to a new node), and
the ranking in line 8 of the Algorism 1 means the rank (in {0, 1, 2, …}) of nodej in choosing on
the probability given in proportion to its degree denoted deg(nodej). That is, the values of
deg(nodej), multiplied by a random value between 0 and 1, are compared for ranking the nodes
in G to choose the top m0 nodes. In the real human society, m0 can be regarded as the number
of people whom each person intentionally chooses to meet i.e., all other people one can meet
separately if preferable, not necessarily in a group. After the intended meetings, one may get
contacted by other nodes each of which (who, if the node is a human) chooses m0 nodes to meet.

It is well known that the distribution of the degree of nodes follows the power-law, that means
a few nodes in V occupy a large portion of the edges in E. Networks such as WWW and online
communities [17], cellular networks in biology [18], patients of sexually transmitted diseases
[19], etc. have been known to follow the power-law degree distribution. We basically regard
the generation process above of SFN as a model capturing real social behaviors of people
approximately, comparing with other existing models. For example, all the nodes are connected
to the same number of edges in a regular graph, which is inconsistent with the real inequality
of peoples’ social activities in the real world. The small-world networks [20] have been used
as a model to capture the contacts of people where local communities and their weakly bridging
ties play each role in the infection spreading [21, 22]. However, let us not choose this model
because we embrace an aim to clarify the effect of contacts with external communities caused
by connections due to unintendedly receiving contacts from others such as the thin W-m0+1
edges in Fig. 1. An individual in the real society may not distinguish between a bridge between
communities and other relationships, but can distinguish a relationship one intentionally made
with others and unintended relationships made by others. This distinction shall enable an
individual to choose edges if intended relationships are more choice-worthy. In addition, a
small-world network e.g. in [20] starts its own generation from a regular graph and moves a
certain number of randomly selected edges connected from each node, which does not match
with humans’ behavior intending to create a community in the real world. In the more recently
proposed Mediation-Driven Attachment Model [23, 24], each new node first picks an existing
node at random and connects not directly with this but with a certain number of its neighbors
also picked at random. This is an extension of SFN supposed to result in having each new node
connected to “rich” people linked to a large number of “poor” people of low degrees by
choosing link destination nodes by the probability estimated to be inverse of the harmonic mean
(IHM). Although this may make the network fit to the real society, we do not choose as the
model for this paper because the attendants of places do not have a bias to low-degree nodes in
the daily life human behaviors. Furthermore, the network of locations (i.e. rooms in this paper)
has been shown to form a scale-free network [21], and the networks we deal with model the
mixture of people and rooms. In this sense, the idea to borrow SFN as a backbone is at least
partially supported as a tool for modeling a real-space human society in this paper. Thus,
considering the suitability of each model to the intuitive understanding of the social life of
people, we take SFN as the backbone and revise it with introducing constraints corresponding
to the spatiotemporal restrictions in the real life of people as in the next section. Reference [19]
is an example supporting this choice in the sense a virus infection network has been shown to

follow the power-law distribution. We can find other literature utilizing SFN as a model for
the analysis of infection dynamics [25].

Constrained scale-free networks considering spatiotemporal
restrictions
The SFN may be, as discussed above, regarded as a natural model for capturing human social
behaviors as long as there is no restriction on the reach of social behaviors of each human. On
the other hand, the physical constraints in the real living environment restrict the width of the
room where people may gather, and the time - a person cannot meet as many people as one
would like to meet. Thus, the original scale-free network cannot be used as it is to model real
social behaviors of people. In this sense, let us revise the process as follows. Besides, we need
to deal with not only humans but also spaces of rooms as nodes assuming that these are working
as entities attracting people and that these entities are dealt with to meet the requirements of
humans. Furthermore, the virus is wrapped in saliva and cast into the air in meeting rooms. We
reflect the spatiotemporal restrictions as constraints in the two types of artificial networks of
people and things/places.
The first artificial network we use in this paper is SFN with Spatiotemporal Constraints
(Algorithm 2: SFN-SC). A feature of SFN-SC is that it starts from multiple cliques rather than
a single clique used in the sheer original SFN shown above. This means we can assume multiple
(K>1) groups of people that may attract people who may come later, which is a generalization
of the original SFN that corresponds to setting K to 1. A spatiotemporal constraint is given by
the next feature. That is, the degree of the link destination node (the partner of the new
connection) from the new node is constrained by the given upper bound of W at each time a
new node is added, as in line 10 of the Algorithm 2. If the destination node means a room, the
room capacity is at most W people for the protection of COVID-19 infection spreading. The m0
nodes to which this room directs via its m0 out-going edges as in lines 10 through 13 may
correspond to the facilitators (or attracting speakers) in the meeting. These facilitators are
people occupying a part of the capacity W but do not join in the group of the other people in
the room who are sheer participants. The facilitators direct their out-going edges to other nodes,
which means to inform about (e.g., call for attention or report the achievements of) the meeting.
If the destination node means a human, other nodes coming after to be connected to the node
mean people who choose to meet the person. Because these aftercoming nodes may desire to
meet in the same space at the same time, in both cases, i.e., where the destination node is a
room or a human, we add the lines from 17 through 24 for showing a group can be made by the
aftercoming nodes which may generate an infection environment.

23:
end for
24: end for
Thus, the two constraints below are assigned on each node X in SFN-SC:
Constraint 1: From other nodes, X accepts at most W edges including the edges X directed to
other nodes that appeared in G before X, as shown by 𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑗 ∈ 𝑉 in line 10. This means X
accepts at most W-m0 nodes from newer nodes i.e., nodes that appear in G after X.
Constraint 2: X directs an edge only to nodes that joined G before X, as 𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑗 ∈ 𝑉 in line 10.
By the combination of these two constraints, the degree of each node X is bounded by W. X
receives edges from newer nodes that appear after X only when deg(X) is less than W. If X
directed edges to other m0 nodes, it accepts additional edges only if W > m0. On the other hand,
if 𝑊 ≤ 𝑚0 , nodes newer than the 𝐾 min(𝑊, 𝑚0 ) 𝑖. 𝑒., 𝐾𝑊 nodes in the initial clusters
generated in line 2 cannot get connected to those clusters but generate new clusters that grow
to include W + 1 nodes.
However, it does not fit to our daily experience in urban life to assume that each habitant
contacts others spontaneously only when one newly joins the city, or that one chooses to contact
only people who lived since before oneself. In this sense, we create the other procedure in
Algorithm 3 where Condition 2 is expired (𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑗 ∈ 𝑉 in line 9 no more means constraint 2,
because V includes all the N nodes to be included in G from the beginning of this algorithm due
to the initial members of V given in line 1). Due to the constraint releasing, the degree of each
node X is not strictly bounded by W i.e. X can choose other nodes to contact after it receives
edges here. We call this algorithm of network generation “selfish” because one (node X) does
not accept edges from other nodes if X is busy for the contacts with W other nodes even if X is
responsible partially (i.e., the W nodes may include ones to which X directed edges for his own
interest), but X executes his right to direct new edges to m0 other nodes even in the busy
situation. This matches the real-world human society, where a busy person protects oneself
from new contacts but keeps calling others for one’s own business. It is noteworthy that X
denoted by nodei in Algorithm 3 may contact other nodej where j is larger than i, which means
someone who does not belong to V before nodei. This means X may endeavor to contact the
potential market embracing new people who are not yet popular if X has room within his edges
(m0), because X contacts not only those who chose to contact others before X does but also who
do so after X. As in Figures 2 and 3, Algorithm 3 expands the connection from a cluster to other
nodes (see the connections from node 10). The degree distribution of neither SFN-SC nor SFNSSC follows the power-law but the most popular nodes come to take the degree W or W+m0.
Thus, we mean to highlight the effect of unintended connections (represented by W- m0) by
controlling W and m0, rather than simulating the spread of infections in the original SFN.

The model of infection spreading dynamics
For each node in the network generated above, the three-step dynamics is considered here for
spreading the infection. The first is to catch a virus from neighboring nodes (i.e., humans, places,
or things in the places), the second is to get infected, and the third is to become an infector to
other nodes. Here note each edge in G represents the possibility that two entities (humans,
places, or things in the places) may contact. An activation rate p is defined here as the
percentage of “active” edges and groups (generated by lines 17 through 24 in Algorithms 2 or
3) connecting the nodes that contact in the simulation. That is, p|E| edges are used for the nodes’
contacts and all the other edges are shut off. And here, a contact of nodes means the nodes meet
closely enough, e.g. a conversation of 15 minutes at the distance of 2m, to cause an infection if
one of the nodes has infectivity. If people contact fully activating all the edges in G, p is 1.0. If
the frequency of contacts is reduced by 80% due to governmental regulation, p is set to 0.2.
These steps are supposed here to occur as follows, week by week:
Contacting the neighbors: the rate of p (a real value from 0 to 1) of all the edges in E and of all
the groups organized in the Algorithm 2 or 3 are randomly chosen. Then, for each node X, the
other nodes connected to X via an active edge or are in the same active group as X are taken
as the contacting neighbors of X.
Catching virus from neighbors: catch(i) takes the maximum value of infector(neighbor) of all
the contacting neighbors of nodei. In other words, a node catches virus if any of its contacting
neighbors has become an infector. An infector is generated on the following rule.
Getting infected: nodei is infected if catch(i) is larger than a random value which ranges by
uniform probability between 0 and 1, meaning one gets infected by the probability of 0.5 if
one catches viruses from any neighbors. The strength of infection is here given by a real value
infected(i) rather than a discrete judgment considering the uncertainty. The infection of a node
fades by a constant r (set to 0.7 corresponding to the recovery in 4 weeks) each week. This
fading means the inactivation of viruses or the node’s acquisition of immunity.

Becoming an infector: If a node is infected, one infects others that is represented by the value
of infector(i) equal to 1 by the probability of 0.2 on the announcement of WHO on April 10,
2020. Otherwise, infector(i) is equal to 0. infector(i) also fades by r per week.
Suppose here that anyone linked to other n people by the probability of p is expected to infect
others to generate approximately two other infected nodes (see https://rt-live-japan.com/ for the
data on effective reproduction numbers) for the two weeks. Here, an individual gets infected
by 50% in the setting above if one catches viruses, and infects others by the probability of 0.2.
Thus n * p * 2 * 0.2 *0.5 is supposed to be nearly equal to 2.0, which means p is approximated
by 1.0 in the usual daily-life communications if n = 10. Here, 10 is the approximated average
number
of
friends
reported
for
each
person
in
Japan
(https://chosa.nifty.com/relation/chosa_report_A20121123/1/). The effective reproduction
number 2.0 is larger than the reported number of infection reproductions in the period of
spreading [26], but set to this value to consider the situation people communicate as usual.
Infection dynamics have been also modeled by fusing a network-based and the populationbased SIR model [9:1, 25]. However, we take the infection process above in order to model the
probabilistic threshold system where each node X gets infected if catch(X) exceeds a threshold
and then infect others by a certain probability.

Results
We executed the simulation of 100 weeks/trial setting the number of nodes (N) in G to 1000
and 10000, and two starting infected nodes in the 0-th week, one in a cluster (meaning to have
degree W) and another out of any cluster.

The tendencies of infection (1): the second waves
Figures 4 and 5 show the average number of new infection cases per week on Algorithm 2 and
3 for 10 trials. Note each curve shows not a history in one trial but a mixture of the sequences
of the averaged trials. The number of initial clusters is set to K = 0.1 N/W in order to make
separate clusters for a large W. For example, if the number of nodes (N) is 10000 and W is 20,
we start from 50 cliques as initial clusters. In these figures and after, cases(t) means the number
of new infection cases in the t-th week.
As in Figures 4 and 5, we find several tendencies. First, the peaks of the second wave tend to
be lower than of the first wave (e.g., the third of Figure 4(a), the first of Figure 4 (b), the second
and the third of Figure 5 (a), and the first of Figure 5(b)) as far as the structure of the social
network is invariant throughout the simulated period. We detected the second peak in the 190
curves (39.6%) among the 480 cases (twenty values of W, three values m0, single and multiple
initial cliques, two values 1000 and 10000 of N, for the two Algorithms) we tested, of which
19 (3.9%) was higher than the first peak. Only 2 (0.4%) of curves had the second peak after
going down to less than 10% of the first peak, in both of which the first peak was less than 10
infected cases. Thus, no second peak in the severe cases exceeded the first. Here, a peak means
the time t where 𝑓(𝑡) =
max
𝑓(𝑠) setting Δ𝑡 to 5 weeks.
𝑡−Δ𝑡≤𝑠≤𝑡+Δ𝑡

In the next place, we changed the network at the 20th week from a multiple to a single initial
clique on the way of infection spreading that is an imaginary change without changing N, the
density of the network, or the infection status (infected(X), infector(X), catch(X) defined in the
model of infection) of any node. This means an experiment of Scenario C in Figure 1, i.e., to
change the structure of the entire graph G. As a result, as in Figure 6, we found the second
finding: We detected the second peak in the 54 curves (67.5%) among the 80 tested cases (eight

values of W, five values of m0, multiple initial cliques, two values 1000 and 10000 of N, for the
Algorithm 3 because here we aim to investigate the changes in the inter-cluster structure that is
richer in SFN-SSC) we tested, of which 21 (25.1%) was higher than the first peak. Furthermore,
11 (13.1%) of curves had the second peak following the structural change, after going down to
less than 5% of the first peak. However, as in the case of (W, m0)=(8, 4) in Figure 4(b), the
simulation using SFN-SC can result in the meaningless small number of new infection cases.
This happens because an initially infected node comes to be located in a small cluster isolated
from the other nodes in G due to the feature of SFN-SC as shown in Figure 2. For this reason
and also because SFN-SSC reflects the above mentioned “selfish” nature of humans in
contacting others, we take the exemplified curves from the results of SFN-SSC.

(Algorithm 2, N = 10000) for varying W and m0.

(Algorithm 3, N = 10000) for varying W and m0.

The tendencies of infections (2): for varying W and m0
The third tendency we find from the curves exemplified in Figs 4 and 5 is that the peak of the
number of infection cases tends to vary for various values of W and m0. In Tables 1 and 2, we
recognize two tendencies in the range of large W and m0. First, the number of infection cases
depends positively on W according to the values in the cells in each column. Second, the larger
value of m0 does not always result in a larger number of new infection cases. For W of 6 or
larger, the largest number of infections occur for 2 ≤ 𝑚0 ≤ 8 rather than for a larger m0. In
the cells where W < 6 or m0 < 2 (especially for less than 2), the number of new infection cases
are substantially smaller than in the other part of the table. More importantly, the maximum
number of new cases rises radically from W less than m0 to larger than or equal to 2m0. Focusing

on the range of 2 ≤ 𝑚0 ≤ 8, let us see the tendency as in Figure 7. For the cases of multiple
initial cliques (K = 0.1 N/W), two-step growth i.e., at W = m0 and W = 2m0 is observed. The
growth at W = 2m0 is especially obvious for the case of a single initial clique (K = 1).
In the Tables 3 and 4, the average timing of infection for all the cases is shown. These values
mean the expected timing of infections, setting the first infections in this network as the 0-th
week. In this table, the third tendency is observed: the average infection week tends to rise
radically from W less than m0 to larger than or equal to 2m0, and is reduced for the larger W.

The tendencies of infections (3): the releasing of restrictions
In Figure 8, the examples of releasing restrictions of 20% (p= 0.2) to 50 or 100%
(completely free communication) are shown. The restrictions are released at the 20th week in
all the 200 cases including the five trials of eight values (32, 20, 16, 10, 8, 4, 2, 1) of W, five
values of (16, 8, 4, 2, 1) of m0. Among these cases, we took the 55 cases where the peak of 20%
was before the 20th week and evaluated the correlation of X: the closeness of the original (i.e.
p = 0.2) highest peak to the 20th week and Y: the height of released (i.e. p = 1.0) after-wave
relative to the original highest peak. As a result, a strong correlation is shown between X and Y
(Pearson’s correlation was 0.81) as in Fig 9. X and Y are respectively defined below:
X := Maxp= 0.2, 20≤t≤100 cases(t)/Maxp=0.2 , 0≤t

≤100

cases(t)

(1)

Y := Maxp= 1.0, 20≤t≤100 cases(t)/Maxp=0.2 , 0≤t

≤100

cases(t)

(2)

In Eq.(1), Maxp=0.2 , 0≤t ≤100 cases(t) and Maxp= 0.2, 20≤t≤100 cases(t) respectively mean the largest
cases(t) for all the simulated 100 weeks and for the period after the release in the 20th week,
both setting p to 0.2. The larger X means the closeness of the 20th to the highest peak before the
20th week because X is reduced to be the less if the 20th week appears the later after the peak.
Note X is not the sheer temporal distance but the relative delay considering the decrease in the
number of infection cases reflecting our aim to investigate the influence of time reducing
cases(t). On the other hand, in Eq.(2), Maxp= 1.0, 20≤t≤100 cases(t) means the largest cases(t) after
the release in the 20th week. The larger Y means the stronger impact of the release because Y
approaches 1.0 from a smaller value if the value of Maxp= 1.0, 20≤t≤100 cases(t) i.e. the largest
number of infection cases after the release, is equal to or larger than the largest number before
the release. Thus, the result here means that the sooner is the release after the peak in a restricted
period, the higher wave is caused after the release.

Discussion
The first finding that the peak of the second wave tends to be lower than the first, if the network
structure is invariant, can be explained as Scenario A in Fig 1, where the infection cases
monotonously fade after the peak, and as Scenario B, where the second wave occurs in a
localized cluster in the network. Unless the localized clusters are connected, they get infected
from the initial cluster independently and fades without and interactive activation. Thus, this
first finding can be explained as the dynamics of a network with distributed local clusters with
weak ties.
The second finding is that the peak of the second wave could be higher than the first if the
network changes the structure on the way of infection spreading or after its suppression. This
occurs because the infectors come to directly touch non-infected people who have not acquired
immunity. And this implies a risk of an outbreak even at a time when the observed infection
spread is settled if people activate inter-community interactions.
The third finding is that the number of infection cases depends positively on W, the largest
allowed number of people one accepts to meet. On the other hand, m0 for the largest number of
infection cases tends to take an intermediate value (such as 2, 4, or 8) rather than the larger
value (such as 16). The author’s hypothesis for explaining this result is that the people one
meets tend not to have acquired immunity yet if the number of people to meet is restricted to a
narrow community and may cause infections to spread. This lack in immunity is supposed to
occur in the sparsely connected parts of the entire graph G because people on the nodes in such
parts are of lower degree and fewer opportunities to touch others. If there are large meeting
groups the hypothesis goes that the infections in these groups attack the nonimmune part of the
network. If m0 is constrained to 1 or 0 (meaning to choose nobody to meet), according to
Table 1, the risk is reduced significantly because the casting and catching of viruses occur in
lower probability. However, this is a too strong constraint for an ordinary way of living.
Thus, a realistic way we obtain from the third finding may be to reduce the participants in a
group (i.e., W-m0). As in the results of Figures 7 (and Table 1), reducing W-m0 to 0 contributes

to suppressing the number of infected cases. The reason for this is clear: if W is equal to m0 or
smaller, no new node can be connected to a cluster where all the nodes have a degree of m0 or
larger in both Algorithms 2 and 3. In such a case, no cluster can be larger and the spreading is
restricted to each small cluster. However, restricting each group size to 0 means having no
group, that is another hard constraint for businesses especially if the businesses need to create
contracts with new actors. Therefore, we should pay attention to the other threshold W=2m0, as
in the results in Figures 7 for the two types of networks generated from both single and multiple
initial cliques. The condition 𝑊 ≥ 2𝑚0 causes radically high peaks, which can be explained
by considering the two-step phenomenon caused as follows.
Step 1) A node X is added to G with m0 edges from X to existing nodes. As a result, m0 as a part
of the capacity of G to accept connections to new nodes via new edges is lost.
Step 2) X itself has a capacity to accept W- m0 edges, which comes to be added to the capacity
of G. Thus, if 𝑊 − 𝑚0 ≥ 𝑚0 , i.e., if 𝑊 ≥ 2𝑚0 , each cluster in G obtains the more capacity
with adding new nodes. Otherwise, each cluster stops the growth by a limited size because
each cluster in G loses its capacity to get new connections.
Thus, we propose each node e.g., person or a room, accepts less than 2m0 i.e., twice as many
people to touch as the people the node chooses spontaneously to meet. More easily put, it is
safe if each individual do not accept others whom one does not choose (keep 𝑊 < 𝑚0) and, if
this is too strict, one should not accept contacts from a larger number of people as one chooses
to contact (keep 𝑊 < 2𝑚0 ). One way to understand 𝑊 < 2𝑚0 is to rewrite this as 𝑊 −
𝑚0 < 𝑚0 . Because 𝑊 − 𝑚0 means the number of other people one accepts contacts from
without one’s own choice, this means one should keep in one’s own community that one chose
intentionally rather than accepting new contacts from external communities. This is
conceptually common to the finding in the literature [1, 27] that mixing heterogeneous people
or connecting nodes via a long-distance edge can result in infection expansion. The effect of a
bridge between communities is just one interpretation of 𝑊 − 𝑚0 and 𝑊 − 2𝑚0 under the
assumption that directing edges to m0 other nodes is an intentional action from a node. However,
the results of the timing of infection (Tables 3 and 4) add evidence of the creation of bridges
between clusters of nodes. That is, the clusters start to be bridged in the range of 𝑚0 ≤ 𝑊 <
2𝑚0 that enables infections through long paths in G taking a longer time than in each small
cluster. For a larger W, the paths are widened due to the added edges and the infections are sped
up to reduce the time for spreading.
Finally, the fourth tendency we found is that the release of once given constraint may trigger a
second wave higher than the peak of 100%, i.e., than the spreading without introducing any
constraint from the beginning if the release is introduced soon after the peak. Thus, we can say
the restriction, if introduced once, should not be released quickly without checking the results
of the step-wise release of restrictions. For example, the government should release from p=0.2
to 0.3 without allowing public places where people from different communities often meet (this
comes from the second finding), see what happens to the number of infection cases, and go
ahead to 0.4 only if a substantial increase is not found.
We find relevances of our results to previous work in the literature. The results in this paper
can be associated with the assertion that there is a risk of infection spreading in a society where
people in each household decide to maintain an in-person social connection with one person
from other households [28]. In comparison, the suggested policies above are not so strict but
realistic and practical proposals for the decision making of both individuals and policymakers.
In [29], by combining a stochastic model for state transitions and networked multi-agent

simulations, they showed the possibility that undetected (asymptomatic or mildly ill) cases may
still exist and cause complex social influence even after the peak of the pandemic wave. In our
paper, the asymptomatic cases correspond to nodes infected but not chosen probabilistically to
be infectors before they lose the infectivity. These nodes are not so densely surrounded by
infected nodes as infectors are, because infectors can infect neighbors. Therefore, the risk here
is relevant to the case of second waves in Scenario B. In [30], the slowing down of spreading
has been found to be caused by weight-topology correlations. The weight here means the
frequency of communications via each edge, whereas the topology corresponds to the location
of each edge i.e. whether it is in a cluster or a bridge. Interpreting that the frequent
communication across bridges between communities accelerate the spreading of infections, we
are verifying similar tendencies in different setting. An algorithm for reconstructing the strong
ties that are the invariant backbone structure of a network, divided from weak ties made of
transient links in the dynamic network structure, from data on the individuals' states in a
spreading process [31], has been shown to be useful for a targeted immunization strategy that
prioritizes influential nodes in the inferred backbone. Our conclusion may seem to differ from
this result in that we showed the role of bridges between clusters on the spreading, that seem to
correspond to weak ties between strong ties. However, the bridges between clusters we dealt
here are not necessarily as transient as weak ties and are really influential to various clusters,
so is consistent with [31].

Conclusion
The infection spreading has been simulated over human networks where the constraints are
given by the maximum number of people that each person accepts to meet (W) and the number
of other people one chooses to meet (m0). The real-space urban life of people is modeled as a
modified scale-free network with constraints on the constants on the two width factors W and
m0 above. As a result, four findings have been obtained as in the discussion, that we here put
within this one paragraph. That is, for suppressing the number of infections, we need policies
with attention to the bridges between densely infected clusters rather than just looking at the
clusters. Simply put as recommendations, the government should release once introduced
restrictions on peoples’ communications late enough, with careful attention to the result of stepby-step releasing. And for individual people, it is safe if each individual can avoid contact from
others whom one did not choose. This means staying with ones’ own intimate community if
one chooses to meet intimate people. Even if this constraint is too strict, one should not accept
additional contacts from as large number of people as one chose to contact during the period of
infection spread. It should be noted here the reader should not misunderstand that one can meet
as many people as one likes as far as the number of additional contacts is less than the chosen
contacts. The point is instead that one should look back at people one chose to contact so far
during the period of infection spread and then restrict the new contacts following the rule above
because the events in the network above have been simulated for this period.
In this paper, we related infection spreading to the bridges the changes in the structure of the
social network. Here we intentionally restricted the dynamics of the network to just one-time
change for clarifying the effect of a change. This is realistic for the release of p to a larger value
because the release of governmental restriction is usually one or a few times in a country or an
administrative district. However, we consider our future step about continuous change in the
network structure because the real society changes continuously once people in the public are
allowed to interact with others freely. Hence our new target of research on temporal networks,
to enable extended analysis for network epidemiology by referring to real data [32], via
collecting essential datasets using methods for finding and inventing useful data [33].
