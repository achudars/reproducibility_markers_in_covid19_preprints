Abstract: The spatial diffusion of epidemic disease follows distance decay law in geography, but
different diffusion processes may be modeled by different mathematical functions under different
spatio-temporal conditions. This paper is devoted to modeling spatial diffusion patterns of COVID19 stemming from Wuhan city to Hubei province. The methods include gravity and spatial autoregression analyses. The local gravity model is derived from allometric scaling and global gravity
model, and then the parameters of the local gravity model are estimated by observational data and
linear regression. The main results are as below. The local gravity model based on power law decay
can effectively describe the diffusion patterns and process of COVID-19 in Hubei Province, and the
goodness of fit of the gravity model based on negative exponential decay to the observation data is
not satisfactory. Further, the goodness of fit of the model to data entirely became better and better
over time, the size elasticity coefficient increases first and then decreases, and the distance
attenuation exponent decreases first and then increases. Moreover, the significance of spatial
autoregressive coefficient in the model is low, and the confidence level is less than 80%. The
conclusions can be reached as follows. (1) The spatial diffusion of COVID-19 of Hubei bears long
range effect, and the size of a city and the distance of the city to Wuhan affect the total number of
confirmed cases. (2) Wuhan direct transmission is the main process in the spatial diffusion of
COVID-19 in Hubei at the early stage, and the horizontal transmission between regions is not
significant. (3) The effect of spatial isolation measures taken by Chinese government against the
transmission of COVID-19 is obvious. This study suggests that the role of gravity should be taken
into account to prevent and control epidemic disease.

1 Introduction
Geospatial diffusion is governed by certain scientific laws which can be described by
mathematical language. The theory and models of spatial diffusion have been initially developed in
the period of quantitative revolution. Following distance decay law, the diffusion process is related
to spatial interaction (Banks, 1994; Chen, 2019; Haggett et al, 1977; Morrill et al, 1988). Generally
speaking, spatial diffusion is directly proportional to size and inversely proportional to distance,
which reflects how gravity take effects in geographical systems. The gravity models include two
types of decay processes: one is spatial decay based on distance, the other is hierarchical decay
based on size (Chen, 2015). Distance decay tells us that the place far from the source is less
influenced than the place nearby, while hierarchical decay tells us the place which has a larger size
tends to be more influenced than the place whose size is significantly smaller than the source. Spatial
diffusion and hierarchical diffusion are two main characteristics of geographical diffusion processes
(Berry, 1972; Morrill et al, 1988). The spread of animals and plants, the dissemination of diseases,
and the diffusion of new technologies are all subject to certain spatial interaction laws (Hägerstrand,
1962; Morrill et al, 1988). The diffusion of epidemics reflects a type of spatial processes in
geographical evolution. Once an epidemic occurs in a big city, it will spread from the center to the
surrounding area and from big cities to small towns. For geographers, it seems that all above is basic
knowledge which is unnecessary to be discussed. However, the concrete decay pattern and
parameters of the spatial-temporal change of a specific epidemic cannot be explained in general
terms. Only through calculation and analysis based on observation data, can we disentangle truth
from falsehood step by step. More studies should be made on the rules behind the epidemic for
putting forward effective countermeasures for the prevention and control of epidemic diseases.
Novel coronavirus pneumonia broke out in Wuhan in January 2020, and the COVID-19 rapidly
spread from Wuhan to the rest region of China with the help of Spring Festival travel rush. The
space-time characteristics and mechanism behind the diffusion process are worth exploring. Taking
Hubei Province as a study area and Wuhan as the center of spatial diffusion, we research the spatial
and temporal characteristics of COVID-19 spread in Hubei Province by means of gravity models
and spatial autoregressive model in this paper. The effects of city size and spatial distance on the
spread of COVID-19 are investigated. Where research methods are concerned, a series of concepts
2

including allometric scaling, fractal dimension, and spatial autoregression are introduced into
classical models. Gravity models are used to analyze the characteristics of core-periphery vertical
diffusion from Wuhan, and spatial autoregression is used to investigate whether there is effect of the
horizontal cross influence between different cities except for Wuhan. In Section 2, the local gravity
model is derived from the global gravity model with the help of the allometric scaling, and then the
spatial autoregression term is introduced into the logarithmic linear form of the gravity model. In
Section 3, the parameters of the local gravity model and the mixed gravity model comprising
autoregressive term are estimated by using least squares calculations. The main calculation results
and the corresponding statistical analyses are shown in this part. In Section 4, the chief viewpoints
as well as the limitation of the research are discussed. Finally, the discussion is concluded by
summarizing the main points of this study.

2 Models
2.1 Global geographical gravity models
The geospatial diffusion obeys the laws of distance decay. In different situations, distance decay
patterns can be described by different functions (Haggett et al, 1977; Taylor, 1983; Zhou, 1995).
The number of diffused objects usually follow negative power-law whose power exponent varies
between 1 and 2 (Morrill et al, 1988). However, when considering infectious diseases, it is not
enough to consider the inverse relationship between the number and distance only, but also the
hierarchical effect caused by population sizes of human settlements. Thus, the gravity models should
be taken into consideration. There are two types of gravity models. One is the global gravity models,
which describes the attraction between any two places within a region. The flow and distance can
be expressed by matrices in the model. The other is the local gravity model, which describes the
attraction between one single place and other places around. The flow and distance are represented
by vectors. In this paper, we mainly make use of the local gravity model, but we must start from the
global gravity model so as to explain it more clearly. A pair of dual mathematical expressions are
required to describe the global gravity relation (Chen, 2015). This pair of mathematical formulae
can be expressed as

Tij  KPi u Pjv rij ,
3

(1)

T ji  KPi v Pju rij ,

(2)

in which, Tij is the origin, i.e., the outflow from the source, Tji is the reservoir, i.e., the inflow to the
destination, Pi is the size of place i, Pj is the size of place j, rij is the distance from i to j, and u, v, σ
are the calibration parameters (Batty, 1976; Fotheringham et al, 2000; Fotheringham and O’Kelly,
1989), which are essentially cross scaling exponents. The models above are essentially a fractal
gravity model whose parameters can be explained by fractal theory (Chen, 2015; Liu and Chen,
2000). By taking double logarithms of both sides of equations (1) and (2), the multiple linear
regression analysis can be carried out based on the least square method.

2.2 Allometric scaling and local gravity model
The local gravity model is used to describe the core-periphery relationship in geographical
analyssi. In fact, if only one of equations (1) and (2) is adopted, the local gravity model is actually
used. Mackay (1958) once used the local gravity model to study the telephone connection between
Montreal and its surrounding towns in Canada. The local gravity model can be expressed as equation
(1), which can be simplified in form: one of the two codes i and j can be removed. Let's consider
establishing the relationship between the flow and certain associated quantity distribution. Take the
relationship between the passenger flow of cities and the number of people infected by the epidemic
as an example. Generally speaking, the relationship between the two numbers is a power law (Chen,
2015; Chen, 2017)

N ij  Tij ,

(3)

where Nij is the associated quantity of flow Tij, μ is the proportional coefficient, and α is the scaling
exponent (i, j = 1,2,3,…,n，where n is the number of places). This is essentially an allometric relation,
which is proved to be a priori relation (Bertallanffy, 1968). Equation (3) can be converted to a double
logarithmic linear relationship. In geographical studies, allometric relationships are common (West,
2017). The effectiveness of equation (3) can be verified by the analysis of observation data.
Substituting equation (3) into equation (1) yields

Nij   ( KPi u Pjv rij )ij   K  Pi u Pj v rij .

(4)

Based on the core-periphery relationship, the place i = 0 be taken as the central city, and then Pi can
be regarded as a constant P0. So equation (4) can be simplified as
4

N j   K  P0 u Pj v rj   Pj rj  .

(5)

This is a typical local gravity model. The parameters of equation (5) can be expressed as below:

   K  P0u ,   v,    ,

(6)

where η is the rescaled gravity coefficient, β is the rescaled distance exponent, and υ is the rescaled
size calibration parameter. Both distance exponent and size exponent are related to fractal dimension
(Chen, 2015).

2.3 Integrated model of gravity and spatial auto-regression
The local gravity model discussed in subsection 2.2 mainly describes the vertical transmission,
without considering the transverse diffusion. If only the diffusion of COVID-19 from Wuhan to
other cities in Hubei Province is taken into account, the number of confirmed cases is directly
proportional to the population size of the city, and inversely proportional to a certain power of the
distance to Wuhan. Whether there is horizontal diffusion between other cities except Wuhan is
ignored. In a word, the local gravity model only describes vertical diffusion effect--the relationship
between Wuhan and other cities without considering horizontal diffusion effect--the connection
between other cities except Wuhan. Such a method is inevitably being questioned: why the cross
correlation of other cities can be ignored? In order to consider the horizontal relationship, the idea
of spatial autoregression can be introduced. Spatial auto-regression method is based on spatial
autocorrelation idea. Taking natural logarithms on both sides of equation (3) yields a two-variable
linear form

ln N j  ln   ln Pj   ln rj .

(7)

Assuming that COVID-19 spread between other cities except Wuhan, we should consider the spatial
self-influence which can be described by the process of spatial autoregression. By adding
autoregressive term to equation (7), we have

ln N  ln   ln P   ln r  W ln N ,

(8)

where lnN corresponds to the vector of logarithm of number infected by COVID-19, P corresponds
to the vector of urban population size, r is the distance vector, W is the weight matrix based on
spatial distance, lnη is the logarithm of gravity coefficient, υ、β、ρ are regression coefficients, and
among them ρ is the spatial autoregressive coefficient. Although the expression of vectors in
5

equation (8) is not mathematically standard, it is simple, intuitive and easy to understand. The
significance level of spatial auto-regression reflects the effectiveness of the powerful spatial
isolation measures taken by the government of China. If the autoregressive coefficient ρ is
significant, it indicates that there is a horizontal cross relationship between cities except Wuhan at
a certain degree of confidence, otherwise the cross relationship is weak and the impact can be
ignored. The weak cross transmission of COVID-19 between the cities outside Wuhan can prove
the effect of spatial isolation measures.

3 Results
3.1 Data sources and algorithms
The aim at revealing the geographical mathematical regularity of spatial diffusion COVID-19.
The study area includes the whole area of Hubei Province, China. The geographical elements
involve the capital of Hubei Province, Wuhan, and all prefecture level cities as well as the interurban
road network (Figure 1). According to the local gravity model and auto-regressive model, three sets
of data are in need in this study. The first is the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases, which
represents the associated variables; the second is the urban population, which represents the size
measurement; the third is the traffic mileage between cities, which represents the distance variable
and spatial measurement. The confirmed cases number of COVID-19 in prefecture-level cities in
Hubei came from the daily report announced by National Health Commission of the People's
Republic of China, and the population size of cities was extracted from China City Statistical
Yearbook. As for the interurban distances by road, two datasets are chosen. One is the highway
mileage table included in Hubei Highway Atlas, which basically provides us with the distance
between each prefecture-level city in Hubei Province and Wuhan. The dataset of the distances
between prefecture level cities is incomplete data, so it is not suitable for spatial autoregressive
analysis. The second dataset is the complete distance matrix obtained from amap.com with the help
of distance analysis tool provided by DataMap for Excel. However, it may not reflect the travel
distance along the highways effectively. In computational process, the gravity model is based on the
highway mileage table while the spatial auto-regression is based on the distance matrix obtained
from electronic maps (Table 1).
The algorithm is multiple linear regression analysis based on the least square method. Gravity
model is a kind of nonlinear model, which cannot be implemented in regression analysis directly.
Fortunately, it is easy to transform this model into a linear relation by taking logarithms of both
sides. The nonlinear fitting method can also be used to estimate the parameters of this model directly.
However, the disadvantage of curve fitting may lead to a result that the overall information of the
dataset cannot be utilized effectively. The reasoning lies in that the bigger data points such as the
city size of Wuhan has an excessive influence on the parameters. In particular, it is worth mentioning
the size distribution of Hubei’s cities follow what is called primate law rather than the rank-size law.
7

Where population size is concerned, Wuhan stands head and shoulders above other cities in Hubei
Province. In this case, the impact of Wuhan’s population size on the model’s parameter estimation
based on curve fitting is overwhelming. After taking logarithm, the differences of city sizes lessen.
It is an advisable selection to make use of multivariate linear regression analysis to estimate the
parameter values of the local gravity model and the mixed gravity model with autoregressive term.

3.2 Results and analysis of gravity modeling
The analysis of geographical mathematical modeling involves three basic aspects. The first is
mathematical structure, the second is model parameters, and the third is statistics such as correlation
coefficient and standard errors. As for the mathematical structure, different model structures are
determined by different distance decay functions. Whether spatial auto-regression is considered also
affects model structure. The model parameters include constant term, size exponent and distance
exponent or distance coefficients. If spatial auto-regression is considered, autoregressive
coefficients should be included as well. The model statistics include global statistics and local
8

statistics. The global statistics include goodness of fit, F statistic and standard error of regression.
The main local statistic is t statistic of each regression coefficient. Both the F statistic and the t
statistic can be replaced by corresponding probability values (the P values or significance levels
shown by statistical software). The probability values are very intuitive. If a P value is less than
0.05, it will pass the statistic test of 95% confidence level; if it is less than 0.01, it will pass the test
of 99% confidence level. In this paper, the coefficient of variation is used in place of the standard
error of regression. The calculation formula is: “coefficient of variation = standard error of
regression/ the average value of logarithms of total number of confirmed patients”. The t values of
local statistics are replaced by corresponding probability values, namely, P values (Table 2). For
pure local gravity analysis, the parameters can be estimated by equation (7). Highway mileage (the
first type of road distance in this study) is adopted for it reflects the distance along the national
highway and provincial highway, which is generally consistent with bus route. The distance within
Wuhan cannot be defined as zero due to the logarithmic linear relation. The model can either ignore
Wuhan itself, or estimate an internal diffusion distance. After repeated tests, it is found that 0.25 km
is suitable for the internal distance of Wuhan city for local gravity modeling.

Note: The constant term is the logarithm of gravitational coefficient, while the size exponent and distance exponent
are shown in the model. The coefficient of variation is the ratio of the standard error of regression to the average
value of the logarithm of total number of confirmed cases. The three probability values represent the unacceptable
levels of constant term, size exponent and distance exponent, which are equivalent to corresponding t statistics. The
confidence level of the parameters = (1-probability value) * 100%.

Let us examine the structure of the gravity model suitable for epidemic spread in Hubei at first.
Model structure reflect the property at the macro level of spatial diffusion. The distance decay
function of the gravity model given above follows inverse power law. In fact, the negative
exponential function can be taken as the distance decay function of the gravity model as well. The
mathematical properties of two decay functions are different. As for the negative exponential decay,
the spatial autocorrelation function of is a tailing-out curve, while the partial autocorrelation
function is a cutoff-tailed curve. It implies that negative exponential decay essentially reflects a
local action which lacks direct long-distance effect, and therefore it is inconsistent with the first law
of geography. Both the autocorrelation function and partial autocorrelation function of inverse
power law decay are tailing off, so it indicates the long-distance effect, which is consistent with the
10

first law of geography. In the past, the spatial interaction model based on negative exponential
function can be derived from the maximum entropy principle without involving dimensional
problems (Wilson, 1968; Wilson, l970). So it is favored by geographers. However, the negative
exponential function have caused the contradiction between its locality and the first law of
geography (Chen, 2009). On the other hand, the gravity model based on inverse power law decay
can be derived from the maximum entropy principle as well by changing the distance cost function
(Chen, 2015; Wilson, 2010). The dimensional problem can be solved by fractal geometry (Chen,
2015). Therefore, both forms of gravity models are acceptable at now, and the selection between
them should depend on the effect of empirical analysis. If we do not take logarithm of distance, i.e.
using r instead of lnr, equation (7) is equivalent to the gravity model whose distance decay function
follows negative exponent rule. However, the statistic experiments show that the levels of
confidence of the model parameters is relatively low and the fitting effect is poor in general when
the negative exponential function is adopted. In contrast, the goodness of fit and the level of
confidence of parameters of gravity model based on inverse power law are significantly better than
model based on negative exponential function. After February 15, the model has tended to be stable.
Taking February 16 as an example, the local gravity model of epidemic diffusion in Hubei Province
can be expressed as

Nˆ j  26.3327 Pj1.0135 rj0.4324 .

(9)

The goodness of fit R2= 0.9507, F statistic is 134.9169, and the corresponding probability value sig.
< 0.0000. The coefficient of variation δ = 0.0580 < 0.1, and the degrees of confidence of all
parameters were greater than 99.96%. Referring to the previous calculation results, the mathematical
model expression of each date can be presented (Table 2). The results imply that the diffusion of
COVID-19 in Hubei Province obeys the inverse power law indicative of action at a distance. The
diffusion process does not well accord with negative exponential law so it is not a local spatial
diffusion process (Table 3).

Secondly, the model parameters should be investigated to see the properties at the micro level of
spatial diffusion. The gravity coefficient of the local gravity model contains the information of the
population size of the central city, Wuhan. The value of the gravity coefficient has gradually
increased, indicating that the epidemic situation of Wuhan was becoming more and more serious.
The size exponent firstly decreased, and then rebounded after January 30. After February 2, the size
exponent value gradually became larger than one. After February 15, it showed a downward trend
again and the value became less than one after February 20. The variation implies that the impact
of city size was not very prominent before February 2, and then the effect of urban population size
needed to be highlighted. After February 15, the human-to-human transmission occurred less
frequently because of isolation measures taken by local governments, and the scale effect declined
after February 20. The distance exponent also showed a downward trend before February 1, and
then gradually increased. The exponent rose sharply on February 12 (Figure 2). This variation
implies slow distance decay and rapid spatial diffusion before February 1. After February 1, the
space isolation measures taken by local governments gradually took effect, slowly increasing the
impedance of distance. Especially after February 12, the space diffusion became more difficult than
before (Table 4). Overall, the gravity coefficient reflects the epidemic situation and its impact of the
central city, Wuhan. The distance exponent reflects the distance from the central city and the impact
of direct transmission from Wuhan, while the size exponent reflects the size of other cities and the
impact of local secondary transmission of the epidemic.

Finally, the model statistics are analyzed for testing modeling effect. Model statistics are
statistical measures which used to evaluate the mathematical structure of a model or the level of
confidence of parameter values. An absolutely reliable model statistic does not exist in this world.
A model which cannot pass the statistical test usually has some problems. However, a model which
does have some problems can also pass the statistical test. Different statistic values should be taken
into account together in statistical test. From the perspective of global statistics, both the correlation
coefficient square R2 and F statistic decreased before January 31, and then showed a gradual upward
trend. These two statistics rose rapidly after February 13, and then declined slightly after February
16. The coefficient of variation kept declining without significant fluctuations. The square of the
correlation coefficient reflects the goodness of fitting of the gravity model to the observed data and
the degree of explanation of the logarithm of the distance and city sizes for the logarithm of the total
number of confirmed cases. The coefficient of variation indicates the linear prediction accuracy of
the model. Empirically, the coefficient of variation should be less than 0.1. The accuracy of
prediction has reached the standard since January 31. F statistic is used to test whether there is at
least one of two measurements, logarithm of city size and logarithm of distance, can effectively
explain the logarithm of total number of confirmed cases. The changing trend of F statistic is
generally consistent with the trend of above parameters. The main local statistic are the probability
values corresponding to t statistics, which reflect whether gravitational coefficient and scaling
exponent, which also known as cross elasticity coefficient, are significantly different from 0. No
significant difference between a certain elasticity coefficient and 0 implies that the variable has no
significant influence on the total number of confirmed cases or the calculation error is obvious. The
probability value of the logarithm of the gravitational coefficient showed an overall downward trend.
The confidence level reached 90% on January 31, and then reached 95% on February 4, and finally
exceeded 99.9% after a gradual increase. Most confidence levels of size exponent and distance
exponent are above 99%. Although the level of confidence of distance exponent on January 30 is
relatively low, it is not less than 95%. The probabilities of the two exponents rose slightly before
February 1 and kept declining thereafter. There are two possible explanation of the variation of
parameters and statistics: one is that the caliber of statistics has been adjusted, and the other is that
the system evolution is not stable enough. The problem is that January 31, 2020 is a time node from
all perspectives. One possibility is that the epidemic diffusion process reached a stable state in Hubei
14

around January 31 and the diffusion pattern was formed at that time.

3.3 Spatial autoregressive analysis based on gravity model
In order to investigate whether there is cross transmission of COVID-19 between different regions
of Hubei Province, spatial autoregressive analysis can be carried out. Equation (8) can reflect the
assumption that epidemic have spread through the interaction between different regions. Because
complete distance matrix cannot be built from the highway mileage data provided by atlas, the data
analyzed by GIS method based on amap.com is used as road distance between cities so as to build
complete distance matrix. The internal distance of Wuhan is taken as 0.25 km, which is consistent
with the analysis of gravity model. Firstly, it is necessary to take reciprocal of all values in the
distance matrix to generate the spatial proximity matrix. Specially, let diagonal elements to be 0.
Then, the spatial proximity matrix is globally unitized (normalized) to be transformed into a spatial
weight matrix. After that, the WlnN is obtained by multiplying the spatial weight matrix and the
vector of logarithm of the total number of confirmed cases. Finally, taking lnr, lnP and WlnN as
independent variables and lnN as dependent variables, we can carry out multiple linear regression
to obtain the parameters of the model and corresponding global and local statistics. The results show
that the value of t statistics for the autoregressive coefficient is too low, so the corresponding
probability (P-value) is too high. P value increased at first and then decreased. The highest value is
0.998, and the corresponding confidence level is only around 0.2%. The lowest value is 0.2672, and
the corresponding confidence level is around 73.28%. After February 16, the P-value corresponding
to autoregressive coefficient tends to be stable, varying around 0.285, and the corresponding
confidence level is around 71.5%. In order to be intuitive, the probability P-value of autoregressive
coefficient is added to Figure 3. The conclusion can be reached that the trend of horizontal
transmission of COVID-19 in Hubei Province is not significant. However, the trend was gradually
strengthened before February 16. Taking February 16 as an example, the linear expression of the
local gravity model with autoregressive term is as follows

ln Nˆ j  2.8802  1.0135 Pj  0.4075rj  0.6485W ln N j .

(10)

The goodness of fit R2= 0.9517, F statistic is 85.3619 and its corresponding probability sig. <0.0000.
The coefficient of variation δ =0.0596 <0.1, and the level of confidence of intercept is more than
99.7%. The confidence levels of size exponent and distance exponent are more than 99.995%, but
15

the confidence level of autoregressive coefficient is less than 73%. Due to different degrees of
freedom, the goodness of fit of equation (9) and equation (10) is not comparable with one another.
However, the adjusted goodness of fit Radj2 is comparable, the former is Radj2= 0.9436, and the latter
is Radj2= 0.9404. F statistic and coefficient of variation are comparable. The comparison shows that
the interpretation effect and prediction effect of the gravity model are not improved after introducing
the autoregressive term.
The insignificance of spatial autoregressive coefficient indicated that the spatial autocorrelation
of epidemic transmission in Hubei Province was not significant. The experiment shows that the
spatial autocorrelation is indeed insignificant in Hubei Province (Limited to the space of the paper,
the relevant issues will be discussed separately). The results show that, on the one hand, the isolation
measures taken by central and local governments have played an effective role; on the other hand,
the spatial interaction still exists to some extent. Based on confidence level of more than 80%, the
horizontal relationship of transmission of COVID-19 can be ignored. It can be judged that the spatial
autocorrelation of COVID-19 spread in Hubei should have been stronger without the strong spatial
isolation measures taken by the government. It was the space isolation measures that curbed the
disordered spread of COVID-19 in Hubei Province and China.

4 Discussion
The form of a mathematical model reflects the macro structure of a system, while the parameters
of the model reflects the characteristics of the micro element correlation or interactions of the system.
Accordingly, the statistics (e.g., R2, F, t) of fitting the model to observed data tell us whether and to
what extent the model and its parameters are convincing from different perspectives. In light of the
global statistics (e.g., R2, F) and local statistics (e.g., t), it is generally credible to use the gravity
model to describe and explain the transmission of COVID-19 in Hubei within the study period and
area. At the beginning, the credibility of gravity coefficient is relatively low due to the unstable state
of epidemic diffusion and the obvious random disturbance, thus the model could not effectively
reflect the epidemic situation in Wuhan. After February 1, the model became more and more stable
and the goodness of fit became better and better. The comprehensive results of model selection,
parameter analysis and statistical test can be summarized as follows. Firstly, the epidemic
16

transmission in Hubei has long-range effect at the macro level. Therefore, it can be judged that the
COVID-19 is able to spread to an infinite distant place theoretically. If the epidemic diffusion is
localized, the goodness of fit of the gravity model based on negative exponential attenuation would
be better that that based on inverse power law. In fact, the gravity model based on inverse power
law is more consistent with the observed data. After February 1, the distribution pattern of COVID19 caused by gravity effect tended to be stable. Secondly, the effects of city size and spatial distance
on epidemic situation are different in different periods at the micro level. Before February 1, the
distance decay exponent was low, indicating that the distance from Wuhan to other cities played a
major role in COVID-19 diffusion. In contrast, the size exponent is less than 1, indicating that the
role of population size of different regions is not prominent. After February 1, the distance exponent
gradually increased, rising significantly on February 13. The distance exponent reflects the direct
impact of Wuhan on other regions. The exponent changed implies that space isolation had taken
significant effect since February 1, and the effect of space isolation was more obvious on February
13. At the same time, the size exponent increased, indicating that the size of each city came into
play. The population size is more related to the secondary transmission, so the increasing
significance of population size reflects that the direct transmission from Wuhan was gradually
turned into the secondary transmission within every region. Thirdly, the horizontal transmission of
the epidemic between other cities is not significant. The level of confidence of spatial autoregressive
coefficient is not high. Although the confidence level of the autoregressive coefficient gradually
increased over time, it failed to reach 85% throughout the research period. This reflects the
significant effect of space isolation measures taken by government of China from another
perspective. Otherwise, there would be significant spatial autocorrelation between different regions
of Hubei, and thus the autoregressive coefficients of the mixed gravity model should be significant.
The characteristics of certain temporal process could be reflected from the pattern of spatial
diffusion, for the spatial pattern and the temporal process depend on each other. The growth of
confirmed cases of an epidemic usually appears as an S-shaped curve (Morrill et al, 1988). The
simplest S-shaped curve is logistic curve, which can be divided into three or four stages according
to the velocity and acceleration (Chen, 2014; Chen and Zhou, 2005; Northam, 1979). The initial
stage, the celerity stage and the terminal stage are three stages of a logistic curve. These three stages
are corresponding to the three stages of spatial diffusion process, which are the primary stage, the
17

diffusion stage, the shrinking stage or saturation stage (Hägerstrand, 1962; Morrill et al, 1988). Sshaped curves, such as logistic curves, are corresponding to the squashing function. The first
derivative of the function gives velocity curve with one peak, while the second derivative gives an
acceleration curve with one peak and one valley (Chen, 2020). In this way, an S-shaped curve can
be divided into four stages: the initial stage, the acceleration stage, the deceleration stage and the
terminal stage (Chen, 2014). Correspondingly, the spatial diffusion process can be divided into four
stages as well: the primary stage, the spatial diffusion stage, the hierarchical diffusion stage and the
shrinking stage (Table 5). In fact, the spatial diffusion stage is a process dominated by direct
transmission from the diffusion center like Wuhan, while the hierarchical diffusion stage is a process
dominated by secondary transmission from the central parts of other regions. The importance of two
kinds of diffusion patterns in two stages are different, which cannot be strictly distinguished. The
epidemic situation in Hubei Province is generally characterized by S-shaped curve (Figure 3). The
growth peak of the total number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 was approximately February 4
or February 5, and, in theory, the most severe period was from January 27 to February 15. Therefore,
the epidemic situation in Hubei Province can be roughly divided into four stages.

In geographical analysis, it's natural to use gravity model to study the pattern and process of
diffusion of epidemic. However, the characteristic of this paper may be the gravity scaling analysis
based on allometric relation, gravity model and spatial autoregressive analysis. The shortcomings
of this study are as follows. The first is the limitations of data. The urban population size is obtained
from the statistical data collected two years ago, and the total number of confirmed cases may not
be completely accurate. The second is the limitations of the research area. This paper takes the
18

administrative boundary of Hubei Province as the boundary of study area, but the spatial
transmission of epidemic cannot be prevented by the administrative boundary. The third is the
limitation of time. Since log linear regression analysis is used in this paper, the values must be larger
than 0. So the dates before January 28 were not included in the time series analysis of parameters
due to the incomplete data and the difficulties in comparing. Despite all these deficiencies, the
general trend of the COVID-19 is very clear. The day-by-day comparison showed that the modeling
results based on epidemic data not only reflected certain spatial regularities, but also revealed
significant geospatial information. Further study could consider breaking through the administrative
boundary and analyzing epidemic transmission from Wuhan in a larger research area.

Note: Due to the adjustment of the diagnosis standard of COVID-19, the statistical caliber has varied several times.
The most significant change took place on February 12, 2020. Statistically speaking, the growth rate of the total
number of confirmed cases on February 12 is an abnormal value. From February 19 to 26, the statistical caliber
seemed to be changeable again for the value is abnormal to some extent. Here are two trend lines based on two sets
of data with different statistical calibers. The first logistic curve is more consistent with the growth rate, and the
second fractional logistic curve can reflect the capacity of confirmed cases. The bifurcation point of these two curves
is around February 4 and 5. The growth rate of COVID-19 reached its peak on these two days.

5 Conclusions
As a basic mathematical method of geospatial analysis, gravity model is useful in researching the
19

temporal and spatial characteristics of epidemic transmission. Local gravity model was employed
to analyze the spatial diffusion from Wuhan to other cities in Hubei, and the spatial auto-regression
based on the gravity model was used to investigate whether there is interaction between all
prefecture-level cites in Hubei Province. This study demonstrated that the spatial diffusion process
of COVID-19 in Hubei Province of China was dominated by gravitational rule. Through the
comparison of model structure, the analysis of the model parameter evolution and the variation of
model statistics, chief conclusions can be drawn as follows.
Firstly, the COVID-19 diffusion from Wuhan to other regions in Hubei Province bears longrange effect. This can be judged by the distance decay functions. According to the matching
analysis of the local gravity model with observation data, the fit goodness of the gravity model based
on power-law distance decay is better than that of the gravity model based on negative exponential
distance decay. This indicates that the diffusion mechanism of COVID-19 is complex and the spread
is not limited within a clear boundary. That is, in theory, COVID-19 can spread from Wuhan to an
infinitely distant place. The reality is that COVID-19 once spread almost all over China from the
central city, Wuhan. This conclusion may be superfluous, but it is of some significance. It proves
that the epidemic diffusion is not localized, and the gravity model based on negative exponential
function cannot be used to describe the spatio-temporal evolution of epidemic effectively.
Secondly, the speed and the scale of spatial diffusion process of COVID-19 from Wuhan
mainly depend on city sizes and the distances from Wuhan. This can be judged by the
mathematical structure of the local gravity model. The total number of confirmed cases of COVID19 is directly proportional to a certain power of population size, and inversely proportional to a
certain power of distance. Before February 1, the impact of distance from Wuhan was prominent,
which indicated that the epidemic situation in Hubei Province was mainly caused by direct
transmission from Wuhan, namely, spatial diffusion process. After February 1, the effect of city size
became increasingly prominent while the distance decay exponent gradually increased. This
indicated that the speed of direct transmission from Wuhan to other places had been controlled to a
certain extent due to the isolation measures taken by Chinese government. The effect of the cardinal
number of infected people in each region is manifested, and the secondary diffusion, namely,
hierarchical diffusion mode, have emerged since February 1.
Thirdly, the vertically transmission directly from Wuhan to other regions and the secondary
20

transmission within every region are the main diffusion modes of COVID-19 in Hubei
Province, while the horizontal cross-transmission between different regions is not significant.
This can be judged by the results of spatial auto-regression analysis. The spatial autoregressive term
is introduced into the gravity model, but the autoregressive coefficient is not significant. In general,
the significance of autoregressive coefficient has gradually increased, but the confidence level failed
to reached 80%. The result shows that due to the timely isolation measures, the interaction of
COVID-19 spread between different regions in Hubei has not played an important role. This also
demonstrates that the isolation measures taken by the government of China are effective although
some people regarded “lockdown” as a clumsy method. Geospatial isolation is a necessary means
to prevent and control the diffusion of COVID-19 when vaccines and efficacious drugs against the
virus have not been developed yet.
