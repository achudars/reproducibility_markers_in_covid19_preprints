Abstract
The threat of the new coronavirus (COVID-19) is increasing. Regarding the difference in
the infection rate observed in each region, in addition to studies seeking the cause due to
differences in the social distance (population density), there is an increasing trend toward
studies seeking the cause due to differences in social capital. However, studies have not
yet been conducted on whether social capital could influence the infection rate even if it
controls the effect of population density. Therefore, in this paper, we analyzed the
relationship between infection rate, population density, and social capital using statistical
data for each prefecture. Statistical analysis showed that social capital not only correlates
with infection rates and population densities but still has a negative correlation with
infection rates controlling for the effects of population density. Besides, controlling the
relationship between variables by mean age showed that social capital had a greater
correlation with infection rate than population density. In other words, social capital
mediates the correlation between population density and infection rates. This means that
social distance alone is not enough to deter coronavirus infection, and social capital needs
to be recharged.
Keywords: New Coronavirus (COVID-19), population density, social distance, social

Introduction
The threat of the new coronavirus (COVID-19), which was discovered in Wuhan, China
in December 2019 and spread worldwide, is affecting the lives of many people without
stopping. Japan is no exception, although it is often reported that its virus death rate is
mysteriously low (Wingfield-Hayes, 2020). The number of infected people, which had
subsided in June 2020, started increasing again in July. Hirata et al. (2020) showed that
the infection rate tends to be high in large cities such as Tokyo and that the reason for this
is the high population density of these large cities, and then stated that population density
can be used as a proxy variable for social distance.

However, coronal infections cannot be prevented by social distances alone. In
fact, in addition to securing social distance by refraining from going out, time lag, remote
work, etc., the government is implementing anti-quarantine actions such as wearing a
mask, encouraging hand and finger disinfection, and refraining from loud conversations
as a basic policy for countermeasures against coronavirus infectious diseases, which has
been strongly sought by the public (Cabinet Secretariat, 2020). Among some possible
options, many researchers are paying attention to social capital as a factor that promotes
these quarantine actions.
Social capital is the sharing of values, acceptance of norms, unity, and trust
through reciprocity, and is said to play an important role in solving problems through
interaction and cooperation (Coleman, 1988; Fukuyama, 1995; Putnam, 2000). Previous
research has also shown that social capital is effective in solving public health challenges
(Asri & Wiliyanarti, 2017; House, Landis, & Umberson, 1988; Pretty, 2003). For example,
some studies show that the high level of social capital (trust and human connection to the
government, reciprocity, reciprocity, and solidarity) influenced the practice of preventive
actions such as vaccination, washing hands, and wearing a mask during the H1N1
outbreak in 2009 (Chuang et al., 2015; Ronnerstrand, 2013; See also the review by Pitas
& Ehmer, 2020). In connection with the coronal disaster this time, studies that analyzed
GPS information in the United States showed that residents in counties with high social
capital were more cooperative in going out regulations (Borgonovi & Andrieu, 2020) and
reduced the increase of coronavirus infection (Varshney & Socher, 2020). A study in Italy
also showed that areas with high social capital tended to have low outing rates and low
corona mortality (Bartscher et al., 2020). In a related study, research in the field of human
resource management based on a questionnaire survey shows that social capital
(reciprocal support between company support and employee organizational commitment)
enhanced employees' willingness to cooperate in the workplace corona countermeasures
(Kokubun, Ino, & Ishimura, 2020).
Why does social capital have this effect? This is because social capital
encourages information sharing and removes the uncertainty of choice (Chung, Nam, &
Koo, 2016; Li, Ye, & Sheu, 2014; Six et al., 2015), also encourages collective action and
deters the occurrence of the free-rider problem (Koutsou, Partalidou, & Ragkos, 2014;
Mosse, 2006; Ostrom, 2000; Pretty, 2003). Regarding the former, Kawachi & Berkman
(2000) argue that social capital helps promote the dissemination of health-related
information and prevents unhealthy conduct. Regarding the latter, an empirical study
conducted in China after COVID-19 showed that social capital was successful in the
prevention of epidemics such as refraining from going out and wearing masks (Yang &

2

Ren, 2020).
The latter, that is, the mechanism by which social capital restrains free riders, is
also supported by game theory research. Generally speaking, for people to take
coordinated actions in the relationships with others continuously, it is necessary to expect
that long-term benefits of collaborating will surpass the short-term benefits of
opportunistic actions, Therefore, to promote cooperative actions by increasing the
benefits of cooperation and lowering the benefits of opportunism, it is necessary to have
a mechanism in which a person who refuses cooperation receives "tippling" from another
person (Axelrod, 1984). For reference, Japan's murahachibu (making people who do not
follow the rules of the village out of line) is wisdom based on such a mechanism.
As mentioned above, more and more studies tend to show that social capital leads
not only to epidemics prevention up to now but also to the promotion of quarantine action
and deterrence of infection in this time of Corona. However, to the best of my knowledge,
no studies have shown that even if the effects of population density (social distance) are
removed, there is a negative correlation between high social capital and coronavirus
infection rates. Therefore, in this study, I would like to address this issue using crosssectional data at the local government level in Japan.

Review of previous studies and presentation of hypotheses
Population density and coronavirus infection rate
The relationship between population density and infection rate is shown in Hirata et al.
(2020). A study in China also confirmed a positive correlation between population density
and infection rates before the lockdown (Wang et al., 2020). These researchers point out
increased opportunities for human contact (smaller social distances) associated with high
population densities as a reason for the correlation. In support, some studies have directly
investigated the effects of social distance. For instance, a previous study based on the
results of an independent online survey showed that the number of infected people from
January to March this year tended to be smaller in prefectures with less face-to-face
communication, use of public transportation, and fewer meals outsides (Shoji et al., 2020).
Therefore, the following hypothesis is derived.
H1: There is a positive correlation between population density and infection rate.
Social capital and coronavirus infection rates
Previous studies have shown that social capital helps promote public health (Asri,
Nuntaboot, and Wiliyanarti, 2017; Chuang et al., 2015; House et al. 1988; Pitas & Ehmer,
2020; Ronnerstrand, 2013; Pretty 2003). Besides, more and more studies at this time of

3

Corona Eruption show that social capital encourages cooperation against coronavirus
measures (Kokubun, Ino, & Ishimura, 2020; Yang & Ren, 2020) and control infections.
(Bartscher et al., 2020; Varshney & Socher, 2020). Therefore, the following hypothesis is
derived.
H2: There is a negative correlation between social capital and the infection rate.
Population density and social capital
Small cities are more likely to form social links than large cities (Putnam, 1995).
According to one theory, the basic services provided by the government in large cities are
not provided in small cities with a low population density, which means that the unity and
turnaround of residents to maintain alternative services will be required (Browne, 2001).
In support, several studies have found a negative effect of population density on social
interaction (Brueckner & Largey, 2008; Dempsey et al., 2011). Therefore, many studies
have shown that densely populated and large cities have lower social capital (Andrews,
2009; Eriksson & Rataj, 2019; Rupasingha et al., 2006; Veenstra, 2002). Therefore, the
following hypothesis is derived.
H3: There is a negative correlation between population density and social capital.
Partial mediation effect of social capital
Furthermore, we would like to examine whether social capital correlates with the
infection rate even if population density is included as a variable. The result of one
empirical study recently conducted in Japan shows that the higher the population density,
the greater the impact of trust with the surrounding people on health (Sato et al., 2018).
This suggests that population density alone is not enough to predict people's health and
that social capital acts as an intermediary between population density and health. Further,
given that population density is not a variable that captures all social distances, and that
social capital is involved in the prevention of various types of epidemics, as shown above,
population density and social capital are thought to affect the infection rate
complementing each other. Therefore, the following hypothesis will be established.
H4: Social capital partially mediates the relationship between population density and
infection rates.
Full mediation effect of social capital
The population density used in this paper is merely an indicator of one aspect of social
distance, in which the population is concentrated in a certain area. Even in densely
populated areas, it is not impossible for people's efforts to reduce contact with each other.

4

For example, a US study using mobile GPS location data showed that the normative
element of social capital correlated with social distance measured by the length of time at
home (Bai, Jin, & Wan, 2020). Further, infection risk will depend to a large extent on each
person's social capital following norms and disciplines such as remote work, hand
washing, and disinfection. Therefore, the following hypothesis is derived.
H5: Social capital fully mediates the relationship between population density and
infection rates (Social capital has a greater correlation with infection rate than population
density).

Data
For the coronavirus infection rate, the cumulative number of infected people per 1 million
population by July 3, 2020, calculated by Sapporo Medical University (2020), was used.
For the population density, the “population density per 1 km2 of habitable area” for 2018
recorded in the Statistics Bureau (2020) was used. Both the infection rate and population
density were log-transformed and used for the analysis. For social capital, we used the
"social capital comprehensive index" recorded in the Cabinet Office (2003). This index
is calculated from the response of 3,878 people to a questionnaire survey consisting of 10
questions about "friendship/interaction", "trust" and "social participation", combining the
figures in other two comprehensive statistics about "volunteer activity participation rate"
and "community donation amount per person". It is standardized by the formula
"(prefecture value-average value)/standard deviation". This index is used because it is one
of the most comprehensive measures of social capital in Japan, and it consists of both
subjective information (questionnaire survey) and objective information (external source),
increasing objectivity and reducing the common method bias. Also, as a strength not
found on other similar scales, empirical studies have shown that this index correlates with
lower unemployment and crime rates, higher fertility rates, higher life expectancy, and
higher new start-up rates (Cabinet Office, 2003). Also, the average age for 2015 was
obtained from the Statistics Bureau (2017) for use as a control variable.

Analysis and results
Table 1 is descriptive statistics. The lower part of the correlation coefficient table is the
normal correlation coefficient, and the upper part is the partial correlation coefficient
controlled by the average age. In both cases, significant correlations are shown among
the three variables. Figures 1 to 3 are scatter diagrams showing these relationships. These
support H1 to H3.

Coronavirus infection rate: Number of infected people per million (logarithmic
display). For Iwate prefecture where the number of infected people was 0 (that means
logarithmic conversion not possible), we substituted 0 assuming that there was one
infected person there. Population density: Population density per 1km2 of habitable
area (logarithmic display). Social capital: A standardized index consisting of
“communications and exchanges”, “trust”, “social participation”, “volunteer activity
rate”, and “community solicitation amount per capita”.
Furthermore, the results of the path analysis shown in Fig. 4 indicate that the
correlation between social capital and infection rate remains even when population
density is controlled, that is, social capital partially mediates the relationship between
population density and infection rate. This supports H4. Furthermore, Figure 5 shows the
results of a model including age as a control. Here, population density makes the path of
infection rates insignificant, indicating that social capital mediates the relationship
between population density and infection rates completely. This indicates that social
capital influences the infection rate more than population density, and it can be said to
support H5.

Discussion
The results in this paper show that the negative correlation between social capital and
infection rates is still statistically significant in controlling population density. It can be
said that social capital partially mediates the relationship between population density and
infection rates. To put it another way, securing social distance is not enough to prevent
infection, and it is essential to foster social capital based on solidarity, trust, and adherence
to norms. Also, age-controlled models show that social capital influences infection rates
more than population density. As shown in Figures 1-2, Hokkaido is a good example of
this. Low population density should lead to low infection rates but shows high infection
rates due to low social capital. This can be said to be the result of supporting the argument
by Kitayama et al. (2006), which states that the culture of the pioneering spirit inherited
in Hokkaido is based on individualism and empirical research by Yamawaki (2012) who
verified it.
Looking back on this time's coronal disaster based on the results of this article,
the high infection rate in large cities such as Tokyo can be explained not only by the
narrow social distance but also by the weakness of social capital. While the dangers of
corona are being exclaimed, the reason why they go out to the so-called yoru no machi
(entertainment district) where the risk of infection is high is that the norms for limiting
their behaviors are weak. If this is a local city where a culture of traitor-tattooing is alive,

10

there will be an immediate rumor of "What is that person thinking?", which can be a
strong weapon that prevents his/her imprudent behavior. Especially in situations where
the experience values cannot be utilized like in the case of the Corona Era this time, it is
considered that the bonds and norms between citizens played a major role in controlling
people and taking appropriate actions, especially in local cities.
If so, from the perspective of preventing infectious diseases, it will be necessary
to take various measures to restore social capital in each prefecture, especially in the
heavily damaged large cities. In other words, instead of pursuing only the fulfillment of
one's desires, it is necessary to develop a culture where people respect cooperation and
norms and are willing to control their actions for the people around them. However, it is
important to note that these cultures can sometimes have negative consequences, such as
the exclusion of strangers (Portes, 1998). Furthermore, it has often been pointed out that
such exclusivity hinders the internationalization of Japanese organizations (Keeley, 2001)
especially in acquiring and motivating high-class or diverse human resources (Kokubun,
2018; Kokubun and Yasui, 2020). Everything has its pros and cons. It may also be said
that the reason why the prevention of epidemics in Japan, especially in local cities, looks
more successful than some other countries so far is that the good aspects of the Japanese
as an inakamono (rural person) works. Cultivating a spirit that is open to others while at
the same time strengthening unity is the right way to manage crises in a global society.
The national, local governments, schools, and workplaces must work in tandem to
achieve this goal.

Implication
In this paper, we have shown by cross-section analysis using prefecture-level data in
Japan that social capital plays an important role in addition to the social distance in
preventing infection in this coronal epidemic. This finding can be utilized not only for the
measures for the second wave of coronavirus expected shortly but also for the preventive
measures for various infectious disease viruses in the future.

Limitation
In this paper, we used population density as a proxy variable for social distance, following
Hirata et al. (2020). However, in the real world, a kind of social distance that cannot be
supplemented by population density is practiced, such as avoiding congestion due to
staggered hours. Further, the magnitude of these efforts has been shown in previous
studies to be influenced by social capital. Therefore, the difference in the definition of
social distance does not seem to significantly change the main conclusion of this paper.

11

Rather, the larger limit would be the small size of the sample. If the infection rate, social
capital, and social distance data with smaller units can be obtained from local
governments, it is considered significant to verify the reproducibility of the results in this
paper in future research.

Conclusion
The threat of the new coronavirus (COVID-19) is increasing. Regarding the difference in
the infection rate observed in each region, in addition to studies seeking the cause due to
differences in the social distance (population density), there is an increasing trend toward
studies seeking the cause due to differences in social capital. However, studies have not
yet been conducted on whether social capital could influence the infection rate even if it
controls the effect of population density. Therefore, in this paper, we analyzed the
relationship between infection rate, population density, and social capital using statistical
data for each prefecture. Statistical analysis showed that social capital not only correlates
with infection rates and population densities but still has a negative correlation with
infection rates controlling for the effects of population density. Besides, controlling the
relationship between variables by mean age showed that social capital had a greater
correlation with infection rate than population density. In other words, social capital
mediates the correlation between population density and infection rates. This means that
social distance alone is not enough to deter coronavirus infection, and social capital needs
to be recharged.
