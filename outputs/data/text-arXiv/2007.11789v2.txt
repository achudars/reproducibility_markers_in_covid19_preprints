Abstract
Nursing homes and other long term-care facilities account for a disproportionate share of COVID-19
cases and fatalities worldwide. Outbreaks in U.S. nursing homes have persisted despite nationwide
visitor restrictions beginning in mid-March. An early report issued by the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention identified staff members working in multiple nursing homes as a likely source
of spread from the Life Care Center in Kirkland, Washington to other skilled nursing facilities. The
full extent of staff connections between nursing homes—and the crucial role these connections
serve in spreading a highly contagious respiratory infection—is currently unknown given the lack
of centralized data on cross-facility nursing home employment. In this paper, we perform the
first large-scale analysis of nursing home connections via shared staff using device-level geolocation
data from 30 million smartphones, and find that 7 percent of smartphones appearing in a nursing
home also appeared in at least one other facility—even after visitor restrictions were imposed. We
construct network measures of nursing home connectedness and estimate that nursing homes have,
on average, connections with 15 other facilities. Controlling for demographic and other factors,
a home’s staff-network connections and its centrality within the greater network strongly predict
COVID-19 cases. Traditional federal regulatory metrics of nursing home quality are unimportant
in predicting outbreaks, consistent with recent research. Results suggest that eliminating staff
linkages between nursing homes could reduce COVID-19 infections in nursing homes by 44 percent.

Introduction

Linked to more than 316,000 COVID-19 cases and 57,000 deaths—nearly half of all U.S.
fatalities—nursing homes and other long-term care facilities have been disproportionately
afflicted by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic (Conlen et al., 2020; Kaiser Family Foundation, 2020). With an elderly resident population, many with underlying chronic medical
conditions, congregate living quarters, and routine contact with staff members and outside
visitors, nursing homes are particularly vulnerable to outbreaks of respiratory pathogens
(Strausbaugh et al., 2003; Lansbury et al., 2017). The U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the primary federal regulator of nursing homes, estimates that more
than 30 percent of all nursing home residents in New Jersey, Connecticut, and Massachusetts
had contracted SARS-CoV-2 as of June 28, 2020 and more than 9 percent of the entire nursing
home population died in these states (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, 2020a).
Evidence from the early outbreak at the Life Care Center of Kirkland, Washington demonstrated that nursing homes and other congregate facilities face extremely elevated risks of
virus spread (D’Adamo et al., 2020; McMichael, 2020). CMS guidance issued on March
13, 2020 significantly restricted visitor access to long-term care facilities—effectively locking down nursing homes to only residents, staff, and contractors (Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services, 2020b). Nevertheless, infections have subsequently broken out in nursing
homes, suggesting the unwitting introduction of the virus into homes by staff as one potential channel. In particular, the practice of employing nursing home workers across multiple
care facilities may play an important role in the spread of COVID-19, as a U.S. Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report issued on March 18, 2020 identified staff
working in multiple nursing homes as a likely source of spread from the Life Care Center to
other skilled nursing facilities in Washington State (McMichael, 2020).
Despite this early recognition of cross-traffic between congregate settings as an important
potential transmission mode, the extent of connections between nursing homes remains unknown due to lack of systematic data. Furthermore, although the CDC identified staff
members working in multiple long-term care facilities as a key high-risk group, CMS has
not provided any specific guidance on this practice nor on reducing contacts between homes
more generally (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, 2020b,c).
Using novel device-level geolocation data for 509,603 smartphones observed in at least one
of the 15,307 nursing homes in the continental U.S., we find that 7 percent of individuals
entering a nursing home also entered at least one other nursing home in the six-week period
following the March 13th nationwide restriction on nursing home visitors. We construct
several measures from network theory to characterize nursing-home connectedness, and examine whether such connectivity predicts confirmed and suspected COVID-19 cases. To our
knowledge, this is the first effort to measure and map the network structure of non-social

2 COVID-19 in Congregate Facilities

visitors to nursing homes. These data are anonymized, but, given the prohibition of social
visitors, this cross-traffic between homes is likely traceable to staff and contractors. We find
that the number and strength of connections between nursing homes—and a home’s centrality within the greater network—strongly predict COVID cases, even after controlling for
location, demographic factors, number of beds, and CMS quality ratings. Consistent with
recent research (Abrams et al., 2020; Konetzka, 2020; White et al., 2020), we observe that
traditional federal regulatory metrics of nursing home quality are unimportant in predicting
which homes suffered large outbreaks.

COVID-19 in Congregate Facilities

The high case count and death toll in long-term care facilities demonstrates the urgent need
to understand how transmission mechanisms within these facilities are distinct from broader
community spread, to guide targeted policy initiatives and testing strategies (Pillemer et al.,
2020; Ferguson et al., 2020). Given the incomplete case reporting by CMS, extant studies
of nursing home cases typically rely upon researcher-compiled state data. Three studies
(Abrams et al., 2020; Konetzka, 2020; White et al., 2020) examine the relationship between
cases, home location, home demographics, and CMS quality ratings for facilities in a number
of states. No study finds CMS ratings to be significant explanators of cases, although
demographics and urban location are predictive of cases. Two studies of individual states
(He et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020) find that higher CMS-rated nursing homes report fewer
cases. While all of these papers provide careful statistical analysis of COVID in nursing
home settings, no study directly measures connections amongst homes.
The importance of connections between congregate settings in SARS-CoV-2 spread has
largely been identified through case studies rather than large-scale analysis. The CDC’s
evaluation of the Kirkland, Washington outbreak pointed specifically to staff employed at
multiple nursing homes as a factor in spreading the initial outbreak to additional homes
(McMichael, 2020). Movement of staff and residents across three affiliated homeless shelters likely contributed to outbreaks in each location (Tobolowsky et al., 2020). Employees
at meat and other food processing plants are at increased risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2
given their proximate working conditions and frequent use of shared transportation between
crowded, communal housing and the workplace (Dyal et al., 2020).
The movement of incarcerated individuals and the cross-usage of staff across prisons have
been identified as risk factors for COVID-19 outbreaks; incoming inmate transfers were the
probable source of the San Quentin Prison outbreak (Kinner et al., 2020; Williams and
Griesbach, 2020). While we focus on SARS-CoV-2, the importance of linkages between
congregate settings has been identified in case studies of prior disease outbreaks. Each of
the three flu outbreaks at San Quentin during the 1918 influenza pandemic were linked to the

3 Nursing Home Staffing Practices and Regulation

introduction of a single transferred prisoner from a facility where flu was prevalent (Stanley,
1919).
In principle, if a congregate setting were completely closed to the outside, infection could
not enter. A key challenge in isolating nursing homes derives from their reliance on staff who
live in the community. A study by the State of New York (New York State Department of
Health, 2020) concluded, largely based on the timing of infections, that through no fault of
their own, nursing home workers were likely the main source of SARS-CoV-2 transmission
in nursing homes. They find that roughly one-quarter of nursing home workers in New York
State tested positive for the virus. Below, we describe briefly nursing home staffing practices
and how they may exacerbate disease spread.

Nursing Home Staffing Practices and Regulation

Even in non-pandemic times, nursing home staffing presents challenges. Resident census
and health conditions fluctuate from day to day, altering staffing needs on a daily basis with
unpredictable absences complicating the staffing problem (Slaugh et al., 2018). Understaffing
leads to poor service and regulatory violations while overstaffing increases costs. To help
manage this trade-off, care facilities often rely on staffing agencies to employ nurses and nurse
aides and provide them on an on-call basis (Slaugh et al., 2018; Lu and Lu, 2017). While
data are limited, a 2009 study suggests that 60 percent of nursing homes use a staffing agency
for some of their staffing (Castle, 2009). Given this partial reliance on staffing agencies and
the recent growth in nursing home chain affiliates (Cadigan et al., 2015), many nurses and
nursing assistants commonly work in multiple facilities. Nursing homes also receive services
from hospice workers, dialysis technicians, clinicians, medical transporters, and other nonnursing staff that visit multiple homes. In addition to this planned cross-usage, nursing
home workers may combine employment across multiple nursing homes as well as other
jobs. Survey data from 2012 indicate that 19 percent of nursing assistants and 13 percent of
registered nurses hold a second job of some type (Van Houtven et al., 2020). According to
the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median nursing assistant earned $28,980 in May 2019,
which makes a willingness to work multiple jobs unsurprising. However, extant regulatory
data at the nursing home level do not track the degree to which healthcare workers work in
more than one nursing home or other healthcare setting.

Data and Methodology

Examination of the nursing home COVID-19 crisis is hindered by the fact that CMS did
not require nursing homes to submit data on COVID-19 cases and fatalities until May 2020.

4 Data and Methodology

5

For our main data analysis, we use the disclosures of individual state Departments of Public
Health to determine cumulative nursing home COVID cases. From the 23 states for which
home-level resident case data are available, we collected data on cumulative resident cases as
of May 31, 2020 (or closest reporting period). In the Supplementary Information, we repeat
our analyses using the cumulative case data reported by CMS for homes nationwide, with
the caveat that CMS instructions for reporting cumulative cases allowed nursing homes to
not report cases occurring before May 2020.
Using the CMS address of record for each facility, we merge the nursing home-level COVID-19
case data with nursing home staff-network connections measured using anonymized devicelevel smartphone data for the continental U.S. over the period March 13 to April 23, 2020.
CMS had announced guidelines preventing nursing home social visitors starting March 13,
2020. Thus, over the period for which smartphone activity was measured, the smartphones
detected in nursing homes would likely belong to staff, contractors, and residents. Summary
statistics of nursing homes for both the 23 states for which we have assembled state data
and the set of facilities regulated by CMS in the continental U.S. for which we have complete
data are found in Table 1.

4 Data and Methodology

Smartphone Location Data
We estimate staff networks across nursing homes using anonymized smartphone-location
data provided by Veraset, a company that aggregates location data across several apps on
both the Apple and Android platforms after the smartphone user has consented to the use
of their anonymized data. Previous studies of these data have found them to be highly
representative of the U.S. on numerous demographic dimensions (Chen and Rohla, 2018).
Of the roughly 30 million smartphones we include in our U.S. sample, we identify 509,603
smartphones that appear to enter at least one U.S. nursing home in the six-week period of
our study.
We match all U.S. nursing homes with a shapefile delineating each facility’s rooftop boundary.
To do so, we match a nursing home’s CMS-provided street address to a latitude-longitude
location through the use of the Google Maps API, and then match that location to a satelliteimage machine-learned shapefile of the convex-hull of the building’s rooftop (provided by
Microsoft / Open Streetmaps). Using these rooftop shapefiles, we find all smartphones in our
data that have ever recorded more than two location traces in the same nursing home facility
during our study period, when visitors were explicitly barred. By identifying smartphones
that entered more than one nursing home, we estimate a nursing home staff-contact network.

Network Metrics
The contact structure among nursing home facilities within a state is represented by an
undirected network consisting of n nodes (the facilities) and n(n − 1)/2 possible edges (pairs
of facilities). We estimate a symmetric n × n adjacency matrix A, where aij = 1 if at least
one smartphone is observed in both facilities i and j, and 0 otherwise. Edge weights wij
correspond to the number of smartphones observed in both facilities.
A facility’s degree ki equals the total number of other nursing home facilities with a connection to facility i (i.e., the number of neighbors of node i).

This centrality measure is computed using the principal eigenvector of the adjacency matrix,
rewritten in matrix notation as Av = λv. We then normalize these values to range between

Empirical Specification
Our main specification examines the predictors of the number of cases in a nursing home as
a function of various explanatory variables. Specifically, we include the home’s demographic
characteristics, including the number of beds and the squared number of beds to allow
for nonlinearities. Following previous literature, we include indicator variables for whether a
nursing home has a large proportion (> 50%) of residents on Medicaid and a large proportion
(> 25%) of Black residents. We also include CMS quality measures of nursing homes as
done previously (Abrams et al., 2020). CMS rates nursing homes on a five-point scale. Our
specification includes indicator variables for one-star, two-stars, three-stars, and four-stars,
with the omitted category being five-stars (the highest possible rating). We include a binary
indicator variable that equals one if the home had infection control violations in its most
recent inspection. We define an indicator variable for whether a home is in an urban location
based on the CDC’s urban-rural classification (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
2020).
We examine whether nursing home connectivity predicts COVID-19 cases using the following
regression model:
sinh−1 (Casesi ) = β 0 + β 1 N odeDegreei + β 2 N odeStrengthi
+ β 3 W eightN eighDegi + β 4 EigenCentralityi

19 cases. All reported semi-elasticities are adjusted for the sinh−1 functional form. We
include as independent variables the four network measures that characterize a facility’s
network connectivity, as described in the previous section. The vector Fi is a set of fixed
effects, for the geographical unit of the home (state or county), and the vector Xi includes
demographic, geographic, and regulatory controls for nursing home i.
To control for reporting and other differences across states, we include state fixed effects.
In the Supplement, we include coefficients for all variables in Table S1. Table S2 replaces
the dependent variable with a binary indicator variable if the nursing home has had any
COVID-19 cases. Table S3 repeats our analysis using county fixed effects. This robustness
check is important given the finding in (White et al., 2020) that county-level SARS-CoV-2
prevalence predicts case counts in nursing facilities. Finally, Table S4 replaces the data for
23 states with the larger CMS dataset for the continental U.S.

Network Measures

Nursing homes display a wide range of connectedness to other facilities. Average degree—the
number of other facilities a nursing home shares at least one smartphone connection with—
across all U.S. nursing homes is hki = 14.3, but this ranges from a state-average degree
below 2 in Montana, South Dakota, Vermont, and Wyoming, to an average exceeding 20 in
Florida, Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, and Texas. Among nursing homes with confirmed
or suspected cases, as reported to CMS, average degree is 17.3 compared to 11.8 among
homes with no documented cases (t = 19.2, p < 0.0001), with a similar effect across the
entire degree distribution (see Fig. 1). Average strength—the total number of smartphones
appearing in a nursing home and one of its neighbors—is also greater in COVID-positive
homes (23.7 vs. 16.4, t = 13.4, p < 0.0001).
To illustrate how degree, strength, and other network measures differ across nursing homes,
we present network diagrams for a subset of homes in six states as depicted in Fig. 2 and
summarized in Table 2. Here, nodes represent individual nursing homes and edges represent
connections between nodes (i.e., at least one smartphone observed in both homes). More
connected nodes are generally towards the center of each diagram and nodes with fewer
connections are on the periphery. In each sub-network, a focal nursing home or “hub” is
shown in blue, with its direct neighbors (homes with at least one contact with the hub) in
dark grey and its neighbors’ neighbors in light grey. Node size corresponds to the number
of confirmed and suspected COVID-19 cases (from CMS data to allow for continental U.S.
coverage) and edge color corresponds to the number of smartphones observed in that pair of
homes.
A major challenge facing nursing homes is that every connection is a potential link to other
connections—and to SARS-CoV-2 transmission. In the Connecticut sub-network (Fig. 2A),

5 Network Measures

for instance, the focal nursing home had a large outbreak of 102 cases, yet is directly connected to only six other homes (degree = 6), with one smartphone observed in each pair
(strength = 6), well below our sample mean or Connecticut’s average degree of 13. However,
the hub’s neighbors are highly connected themselves, resulting in a weighted average neighbor
degree of 26, well above the state’s average.
The hub node in Georgia (Fig. 2B) has average degree, but with strength double the state’s
average, an indicator that many staff members are likely working at this facility and its 16
neighbors. Crucially, these individuals are potential conduits of SARS-CoV-2 transmission
given the home’s 189 cases by the end of May, one of the largest outbreaks in the state.
Likewise, the hub node in the Illinois sub-network (Fig. 2C) is not the most connected home
in the state with a degree of 42, yet this facility can play an important role in viral spread
by acting as a bridge between geographically distant nursing homes. In Massachusetts (Fig.
2D), the selected hub node is quite central to this network, with an eigenvector centrality
of 0.75, substantially higher than the state average of 0.16, because this particular facility
is directly connected to many other central nodes. The North Carolina network (Fig. 2E)
illustrates a hub node connected to each of four other nursing homes, which share several
contacts among themselves. Here, the focal facility faced a large outbreak of 181 cases,
potentially increasing the risk of transmission to its neighboring homes. Lastly, with more

states. With a weighted average neighbor degree of 61, this particular hub node is connected
to several other central nodes, but unlike the Massachusetts network, many nursing home
pairs in New York appear to share multiple contacts.

Regression Results

Table 3 presents multivariate regressions of cumulative nursing home COVID-19 cases as
of May 31 on a set of explanatory variables. Importantly, these regression specifications
include state fixed effects to allow for differences in baseline risks and reporting practices
across states; we include even finer county fixed effects in Supplementary Table S3. We
use the inverse hyperbolic-sine of cases as the dependent variable, given its non-negative
skewed distribution. Column (1) shows our base specification with our simplest network
explanatory variable, node degree ki —the number of “neighbors” or other nursing homes
connected to the focal home by at least one smartphone. Results indicate that, if a home adds
10 neighbors (average degree is 15), the expected number of COVID-19 cases increases by
13.7×1.95 = 26.7%. Column (2) replaces the degree measure with node strength si —the total
number of “contacts” or smartphones that appear in the facility of interest and in some other
nursing homes. This too predicts nursing home cases significantly: if a home adds 10 contacts
(average strength is 21), expected cases of COVID-19 increases by 6.79 × 1.78 = 12.1%.
Column (3) replaces the degree and strength measures with weighted average neighbor degree
k̄iw —the weighted average degree of a nursing home’s neighbors (Barrat et al., 2004). Here, an
increase of 10 (mean is 25.6) would lead to an expected 14.7 × 2.09 = 30.7 percent increase in
cases. Column (4) uses our final network measure, eigenvector centrality vi —which measures
the extent to which the nursing home is connected to other highly connected nursing homes,
normalized to range between 0 and 1 within each state. This measure implies that, as we
move from an unconnected nursing home in the state (vi = 0) to the most connected (vi = 1),
the total increase in expected cases exceeds 190%.

6 Regression Results

12

Column (5) is our final specification, which includes both weighted average neighbor degree
and eigenvector centrality, summarizing both the local and global connectivity of a nursing home. Intuitively, regression 5 compares demographically and geographically situated
nursing homes of similar quality, which are thus likely exposed to similar risk of communityspread. When infections co-vary with differences in staff-network connectivity and centrality,
these increased infections are likely attributable to shared-staff transmitting the virus across
multiple nursing homes. As a useful counterfactual, regression 5 suggests that severing all
staff-linkage transmission between facilities could reduce nursing home resident COVID-19
cases by 43.6%.
Consistent with other studies (Abrams et al., 2020; Konetzka, 2020; White et al., 2020), we
find that CMS ratings of nursing home quality are not predictive of infections, yet facilities

in urban locations, those with more beds, a higher share of Black residents, or a higher

Supplementary Table S1).

Discussion and Conclusions

Using a large-scale analysis of smartphone location data, we document substantial connections amongst nursing homes after nationwide visitor restrictions were enacted in March
2020. Consistent with the CDC’s conclusion that shared workers were a source of infection
for the nursing home outbreak in Kirkland, Washington (McMichael, 2020), our network
measures suggest that individuals moving between nursing homes is a significant predictor
of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Our general findings are robust to alternative specifications or
the use of the case count data available from CMS. Clearly, there are limitations to any
observational study. However, this is not an environment in which randomized controlled
trials are feasible or ethical.
These results provide evidence of the magnitude of the benefits that would derive from compensating nursing home workers to work at only one home and limiting cross-traffic across
homes. While some nursing homes and other long-term care facilities have undertaken actions to create a “staff bubble”, this is still not a component of extant regulation (Sudo,
2020; Rodricks, 2020). Absent such regulation, allocation of PPE, testing, and other preventative measures should be targeted thoughtfully, recognizing the current potential for
cross-transmission across homes. While the nursing home population is particularly fragile,
this research has implications for cross-linkages amongst other congregate settings such as
assisted living homes, prisons, or large workplace facilities such as food-processing plants.

Supplementary Materials

In this Supplement, we provide tables with additional detail from our Table 3 and three
robustness checks of our main empirical specification. First, we show all coefficient estimates
for our main analysis (Table S1). Second, we repeat our main analysis, replacing the inverse
hyperbolic sine of the number of cases in the nursing home with a binary variable that takes
the value of 1 if the nursing home has cases (Table S2). Here, for example, the results
in column (1) suggest that, when 10 additional nursing home connections are added, the
probability that a home has cases increases by 3 percentage points. In the data overall, 42
percent of homes have cases. The network measures are all statistically significant in this
alternative specification. Third, we repeat our main analysis replacing the state fixed effects
with county fixed effects (Table S3). This allows a smaller number of units within which
variation can be measured. The urban variable, which is measured at the county-level, is
omitted. Results are qualitatively similar to our state fixed effects data though, as expected,
significance levels diminish somewhat.
As a final robustness check, we repeat our main analysis using data from CMS rather than
data from the individual states (Table S4). This allows us to examine the 48 continental
United States plus the District of Columbia, but these data are subject to the reporting
limitation that homes were not required to add cases prior to May into their cumulative case
totals. The CMS data reports cases in 45 percent of nursing homes but reports overall fewer
cases than the individual state data. This is expected since the CMS data did not require
homes to report cases in the cumulative total that had resolved before May 2020. In this
robustness specification, point estimates for the network variables are slightly smaller than
in our base specifications but qualitatively extremely similar.
Finally, we report mean values and standard deviations of our four network measures, for
all 48 contiguous U.S. and the District of Columbia (Table S5).

COVID cases include confirmed and suspected cases reported to CMS as of May 31, 2020.
Degree refers to the number of nursing homes that a particular home is connected to through a smartphone
observed in both facilities.
Strength refers to the total number of smartphones observed in a nursing home and other connected homes.
Weighted average neighbor degree is the average number of connections a nursing home’s neighbor has,
weighted by the pair strength.
Eigenvector centrality measures the extent to which a nursing home’s neighbors are highly connected, and
is calculated within each state and ranges from 0 to 1.
