We develop an agent-based model to assess the cumulative number of deaths during hypothetical
Covid-19-like epidemics for various non-pharmaceutical intervention strategies. The model simulates
three interrelated stochastic processes: epidemic spreading, availability of respiratory ventilators and
changes in death statistics. We consider local and non-local modes of disease transmission. The
ﬁrst simulates transmission through social contacts in the vicinity of the place of residence while
the second through social contacts in public places: schools, hospitals, airports, etc., where many
people meet, who live in remote geographic locations. Epidemic spreading is modelled as a discretetime stochastic process on random geometric networks. We use the Monte–Carlo method in the
simulations. The following assumptions are made. The basic reproduction number is R0 = 2.5
and the infectious period lasts approximately ten days. Infections lead to severe acute respiratory
syndrome in about one percent of cases, which are likely to lead to respiratory default and death,
unless the patient receives an appropriate medical treatment. The healthcare system capacity is
simulated by the availability of respiratory ventilators or intensive care beds. Some parameters of
the model, like mortality rates or the number of respiratory ventilators per 100 000 inhabitants, are
chosen to simulate the real values for the USA and Poland. In the simulations we compare ‘donothing’ strategy with mitigation strategies based on social distancing and reducing social mixing.
We study epidemics in the pre-vaccine era, where immunity is obtained only by infection. The
model applies only to epidemics for which reinfections are rare and can be neglected. The results
of the simulations show that strategies that slow the development of an epidemic too much in the
early stages do not signiﬁcantly reduce the overall number of deaths in the long term, but increase
the duration of the epidemic. In particular, a hybrid strategy where lockdown is held for some time
and is then completely released, is ineﬃcient.

INTRODUCTION

Mathematical and computer modelling have proved to be very useful tools for controlling existing infectious diseases
[1–4] as well as for analysing and forecasting epidemics [5–7]. Modelling of infectious diseases and epidemics has a
long history [8–11]. The foundations of the contemporary theoretical epidemiology were laid by W.O. Kermack and
A.G. McKendrick [12]. Today, theoretical epidemiology is a mature ﬁeld of research [1–4].
In the last decades, the classical epidemic models have been reformulated in the framework of complex networks
science [13]. Complex networks [14–17] are very well-suited to encoding heterogeneity of spatial distribution [18]
and mobility of population [19–21]. New techniques, which go beyond the classical mean-ﬁeld approach, have been
developed and successfully applied to modelling of epidemic spreading in heterogeneous systems such as degree-based
mean-ﬁeld theory [22, 23], models of clustering [24], spatial and mobility networks [19–21] and meta-population
approach [25, 26] where one can superimpose hierarchical transportation network on the population distribution in
communities, cities, regions and countries, to diﬀerentiate between disease transmission modes in the regional and
global scales. The models are based on real-world data and are used to forecast real-world epidemics [6, 7, 20, 27–33].
In this article, we are developing a model of a hypothetical epidemic that leads to Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome (SARS) for a small fraction of infected people, causing respiratory failure and death. The idea is to mimic
some known features of the Covid-19 epidemic, qualitatively simulate death statistics during the epidemic and discuss
possible control strategies minimising excess deaths. The model simulates the spread of epidemic, the availability of
respiratory ventilators during epidemic, as well as reference death statistics. When constructing the model, we make
the following assumptions:
1. In the absence of a vaccine, immunity can only be obtained through infection.

2. People who get infected become infectious for about ten days.
3. People who recover are immune to reinfection.
4. About one percent of all infections lead to SARS.
5. The occurrence and course of SARS is correlated with the health conditions and age of the infected person.
6. SARS is likely to lead to respiratory failure and death unless the person receives appropriate medical attention.
7. Respiratory ventilation decreases the probability of death.
8. The death probability is correlated with general health conditions of the patient.
9. The healthcare system has a limited capacity. Especially, the number of doctors and the number of trained
medical personnel, and the number of intensive care beds and mechanical ventilators is limited.
10. The mortality rate from non-Covid causes, like cancer, cardiovascular diseases, or other chronic diseases, increases
during epidemic because of epidemic restrictions in hospitals and health clinics.
11. The epidemic may spread in two distinct modes: via local transmission or non-local (global) transmission. The
local transmission mode corresponds to geographic epidemic spreading through person-to-person contacts near
the place of residence. The non-local transmission mode, in turn, corresponds to epidemic spreading through
contacts in public places like: hospitals, cinemas, sport arenas, schools, universities, churches, airports, means
of communication, workplaces and many others, where people, who live in diﬀerent geographic locations, meet.
We are not attempting to develop a realistic model of Covid-19. Such a model would have to take into account many
detailed medical and demographic factors, as well as detailed information about geographical population distribution,
migration, social mixing, etc. Instead, we use Occam’s razor to develop a model that is as simple as possible and
that can be used to qualitatively estimate mortality for a variety of strategies used to restrict epidemic spreading.
The idea is to examine dominant factors shaping the death statistics during epidemic whose spread is inhibited by
large-scale restrictions on social contacts. We are mainly interested in statistical eﬀects.
Let us discuss how the above assumptions are implemented in the model. The numbering below refers to the
assumptions.
1. We are interested in outbreaks like Covid-19, for which there is initially no immunity or vaccine, and vaccine
development and validation takes several years. We model an epidemic in the pre-vaccine era over a time span
of 1000 days, when the only protection mechanism is herd immunity.
2. The duration of the infection varies from person to person. The model assumes that it is a random variable
deﬁned by the geometric law with the mean τ = 10 days. The value τ = 10 should not be understood literally
as ten but rather as the order of magnitude. The mean incubation period for Covid-19 was estimated to be
5.2 ± 1.8 days [34]. Based on existing literature, the incubation period is 2 to 14 days [35]. We do not distinguish
the incubation, latent and infectious periods. This simpliﬁcation does not signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the epidemic
dynamics in large scale, which is simulated as a variant of MSIR dynamics [3]. The rate of epidemic is controlled
by the basic reproduction number R0 . According to early estimates [34, 36, 37], the basic reproduction number
for Covid-19 ranged from 2.2 to 2.7, while according to an analysis of scientiﬁc literature on Covid-19 [38], the
mean value of R0 was found to range from 1.90 to 6.49. We set R0 = 2.5 as the default value in the simulations.
3. The model assumes that a recovered person is immune to the disease or, alternatively, that reinfections are rare
or do not lead to SARS. For some diseases, reinfections are marginal and may be neglected in the description
of epidemic spreading. There is currently an ongoing debate as to whether this is the case with Covid-19 [39].
The model does not apply to epidemics in which immunity fades over time and reinfections are likely to result
in SARS.
4. The estimated SARS fatality rate for Covid-19 ranges from 0.9% to 2.1% [40]. In the model, the SARS case
frequency rate is 1%. This value should be treated as an order of magnitude, not a speciﬁc number.
5. It is known that the occurence and course of SARS caused by Covid-19 is correlated with the age and coexisting diseases of the patient. We want to introduce such correlations to the model in a minimalist way. For
this purpose the agent population is divided into a part where SARS cases are less frequent and a part where
they occur more frequently. The ﬁrst part can be thought of as healthy or young people, and the second as
chronically ill or the elderly. We label the parts by H and C. The parts diﬀer not only by the frequency of

3
SARS occurence, but also by the SARS mortality rates. The split into the H and C groups may look artiﬁcial
at ﬁrst sight but it seems to be the simplest way of implementing the observed variation for Covid-19 of the
probability of occurrence and the course of SARS for diﬀerent age groups. In principle, the model is well suited
to implement many age groups having diﬀerent patterns for the occurence of Covid-19 SARS and other diseases,
but this would make the model more complicated and it would not dramatically change the qualitative picture.
So we stick to the simplest solution. We denote the part sizes pH and pC , respectively. To ﬁx attention we
choose pH = 75% of the total population and pC = 25%. This split roughly overlaps with the split of the
population of a European country (like Poland), into people younger than 60 years (H), and older than 60 years
(C). The implementation of mortality rates for SARS and other diseases as well as the frequency of SARS
occurrence for H and C subpopulations will be presented in detail in the next section where we discuss the
stochastic processes that describe the dynamics of the epidemic.
6. The occurence of SARS cases is also simulated as a stochastic process. An infected person may develop SARS
with a certain probability during the infectious period. In the model, this probability depends on whether the
person is mechanically ventilated or not. The respiratory ventilation decreases the death probability, so it is
important to support by ventilation as many SARS patients as possible.
7. The number of ventilators, or more generally the healthcare system capacity is limited. Not everyone who needs
a support may obtain it in time, when there are too many SARS cases at once. The limited capacity of the
healthcare system is simulated in the model by a simple stochastic process of distributing ventilators between
SARS patients. Once a patient receives a ventilator he or she will continue to use it until he or she recovers or
dies. The ventilator is then transferred to a new person who is randomly selected from all SARS patients who
are in need of one.
8. The death probability is correlated with the general health conditions of the patient. In the model, it is simulated
by diﬀerentiating the death probability according to the H and C groups to which the patient belongs. The
details are given in the next section.
9. The healthcare system capacity is simulated by the number of respiratory ventilators available (or the number
intensive care beds). The number of ventilators diﬀers from country to country. It is approximately 13.6 per
100 000 people in Portugal [41], 27.3 in Russia [42], 30.1 in Germany [43], 52.6 in the USA [43] and 26.6 in
Poland [44]. In the study, we use a value 53, which is close to that for the USA and 27 which is close to that
for Poland. When assessing excess deaths it is convenient to compare them to the number of deaths when there
is no epidemic. The daily deaths per 100 000 people within the period 2007–2014 were 2.74(5) in Portugal,
3.78(18) in Russia, 2.74(3) in Poland, 2.30(18) in the USA and 2.48(7) in the UK [45]. The numbers in the
parentheses correspond to the standard deviations calculated from the eight yearly values in the quoted period.
In our study, we use daily deaths’ values that simulate those for the US and Poland, i.e., 2.30 and 2.74 per
100 000 persons, respectively.
10. The number of deaths from non-Covid causes is expected to increase during the epidemic. The eﬀect is mainly
expected in developed countries where it is related to delayed diagnoses and late admissions of patients with
cancer [46, 47] and coronary heart diseases [48]. For example, it was estimated that the diagnosis delays caused
by one year of epidemic conditions would lead within 5 years in the UK to an increase of the number of deaths
for colorectal cancer by 15.3–16.6%, for breast cancer by 7.9–9.6%, lung cancer by 4.8–5.3% and esophageal
cancer by 5.8–6.0% [46, 47]. Cancer Research UK has estimated that 2000 fewer cancers were being diagnosed
per week in April 2020 as compared to three years earlier [46]. In Poland, in April 2020 only 50% of patients,
compared to April 2019, used the system of rapid therapy, which had been introduced some years ago to speed
up the treatment of oncological patients. Every third visit to an oncology doctor was canceled, the number of
diagnoses using MRI, computed tomography, PET-CT decreased by 30% [49].
The death risk for people with cardiovascular diseases signiﬁcantly increases during an epidemic. The number
of patients ST-elevation myocardial infarction dropped during the lockdown. More than 40% of patients with a
heart attack were admitted beyond the optimal time window [48].
These two examples show that protracted epidemic conditions in the healthcare system may have a signiﬁcant
impact on statistics of non-Covid deaths. Some eﬀects will be seen with a time-lag. Cardiovascular diseases
and cancer account for the largest share of death statistics. For example there were 647 457 deaths from heart
disease, 599 108 from cancer out of a total of 2 813 503 deaths in the USA in 2017 [35]. This is roughly 44.3%.
Thus, an increase in the number of deaths from these causes by a few percent may be signiﬁcant for the entire
population. People with other chronic conditions will be statistically more exposed to the death risk due to
restricted access to healthcare resources during a long-lasting epidemic. Elderly people and people with chronic

4
diseases are fearful of exposure to the virus so they avoid public places including hospitals and health clinics.
In eﬀect, they are more exposed to health risks. These phenomena are diﬃcult to model, since they depend on
many factors, which cannot be easily quantiﬁed, like the organization of the healthcare system, redeployment
of resources during epidemic, quarantine procedures in hospitals etc. Instead of seeking a complicated model
with many parameters which would describe all these factors we propose to investigate what happens when the
rate of deaths, due to causes other than those related to the virus, increases on average by a factor x during
the epidemic, where x is just an input parameter of the model. In particular, we study an increase of the daily
mortality from non-Covid causes by x = 1%, 2%, . . . , 5%.
11. Geographic distribution of the population is simulated in the model by geometric 2d random networks [50, 51],
see Section II A for details. Compared to classic random graphs [52], growing networks [14] or other classes of
random networks which are constructed in a non-geometric way, such networks are much better at mimicking the
distribution of social distances between people in a situation when social contacts in public places and non-local
transmissions are limited. In the model, one can distinguish local and non-local modes of disease transmission. It
is a simpliﬁed version of the meta-population dynamics [25, 26]. Local transmissions are modelled by infections of
neighbouring nodes of the network, while non-local ones by infections of randomly selected nodes, independently
of their position in the network. The non-local mode of disease transmission simulates intense social contacts
in public places where many people meet, who then move to distant places. The eﬀect leads to outbreaks in
remote places and therefore signiﬁcantly accelerates the spread of the epidemic.

METHODS

In this section we provide a detailed mathematical description of the model.
A.

Random Geometric Networks

Random geometric networks are constructed by the proximity rule [50, 51]. Two nodes are connected by an edge
if they lie within the given distance from each other. The simplest example is a network constructed by connecting
randomly distributed points in a d-dimensional Euclidean space. We are using this construction here for d = 2 to
mimic geographical distribution of the population which deﬁnes a network of everyday social contacts. For sake
of simplicity we assume that the points are uniformly distributed on a two-dimensional square with the periodic
boundary conditions. This can be done by generating pairs of coordinates (xi , yi ), i = 1, . . . , N , consisting of 2N
independent random numbers uniformly distributed on the unit interval [0, 1] and connecting any two points i and j
2
by an edge of the network if the distance between them is smaller than ǫ: ∆x2ij + ∆yij
≤ ǫ2 . For the periodic boundary
conditions the coordinate diﬀerences are calculated as follows ∆xij = min (|xj − xi |, 1 − |xj − xi |) and analogously
for ∆yij . The node degree distribution of the network obtained in this way follows the binomial law


N −1 k
P (k) =
a (1 − a)N −1−k ,
(1)
k
where a = πǫ2 is the area of a circle of radius ǫ. The mean degree distribution is hki = (N − 1)a, and the variance
σ 2 (k) = (N − 1)a(1 − a). When a is of the order of 1/N , then the distribution becomes Poissonian in the large N
limit. The node degree distribution (1) is identical as for Erdős-Rényi random graphs [52]. The two classes of graphs
are however completely
diﬀerent. In particular, the average clustering coeﬃcient for the geometric random networks
√
is hCi = 1 − 34π3 ≈ 0.586503 [50], while for Erdős–Rényi random graphs it approaches zero like 1/N as N tends to
inﬁnity [52].
B.

Agent-Based Implementation of SIR Dynamics

We use a discrete-time stochastic implementation of the SIR dynamics [3, 12]. The network is populated with agents
residing on its nodes. The population is divided into three classes of susceptible (S), infectious (I) and recovered (R)
nodes, which describe the state of each agent at time t. The states change in the course of evolution according to
epidemic rules which are implemented in the model in the form of a discrete time stochastic process. Time is counted
in days from the outbreak of the epidemic. Initially, that is for time t = 0, one agent, or a few ones are infectious,
while all others are susceptible. An infectious agent remains infective for τ days on average, and then it recovers.

5
This is simulated in the model by assuming that the probability of remaining infective till the next day is q and of
recovering 1 − q. The lifetime distribution of infectious state is given by a geometric law
Pi (t) = (1 − q)q t−1 ,

t = 1, 2, . . .

(2)

The mean lifetime of an infectious state is related to the probability q as follows
τ = hti =

X

tPi (t) =

t=1

1−q

(3)

which means that for
q=

τ −1
τ

(4)

the expected infectious period is τ days. We symbol h. . .i stands for expected value. Clearly, for τ ≫ 1 the probability
distribution (2) can be approximated by Pi (t) ≈ e−t/τ /τ . Once an infectious person recovers, he or she remains
immune and healthy until the end of the SIR of evolution. Later we will modify the SIR dynamics by superimposing
on it the death dynamics by modifying some of the rules described in this section. In particular, we shall assume
that a recovered person may die with some probability and then reappear as a susceptible newborn. This means,
in particular, that the R state may change to S with some probability. We shall discuss the death dynamics in the
ensuing subsections. The resulting dynamics is similar to that used in MSIR models [3].
If an infectious node, a, is in contact with a susceptible one, b, the disease can be transmitted from a to b, if
the contact is suﬃcient for disease transmission. Let p be a probability of transmission from a to b in one day. The
probability pt of a transmission within t days is pt = 1−(1−p)t. The lifetime of an infectious state is a random variable
(2) so the transmission probability for the whole infectious period is equal to the expected value hpt i = 1 − h(1 − p)t i.
This yields
hpt i =

τp
1 + p(τ − 1)

(5)

for q given by (4). A node has on average hki neighbours, so the number of infections generated by a single infected
node, in a fully susceptible population, is
R0 = hki

τp
.
1 + p(τ − 1)

(6)

This equation relates the basic reproduction number R0 to the parameters p, τ and hki of the model.
The epidemic evolution is implemented in a synchronous way. This means that all states are updated simultaneously.
States at time t + 1 are computed from states at time t. The following rules are used to update the states. If a node
is recovered at time t, it remains recovered at time t + 1. If a node is infectious at time t it remains infectious at time
t + 1 with a probability q. Otherwise, it changes to recovered. If a node is susceptible at t it changes to infectious with
a probability p∗ . Otherwise, it remains susceptible. The probability p∗ , that a susceptible node becomes infectious is
related to the transmission probability p, by the following relation p∗ = 1 − (1 − p)i∗ where i∗ is an eﬀective number
of infectious neighbours
i∗ = (1 − α)in + α

hkiI
,
N

(7)

and in is the number of infectious nearest neighbours of the node in the network, that is those which are connected
to it by a direct edge. I is the total number of infected nodes in the network. The parameter α ∈ [0, 1] interpolates
between the local and non-local (global) transmission modes. In the local transmission mode, that is for α = 0, i∗ is
equal to in , while in the non-local transmission mode, that is for α = 1, i∗ is proportional to all infectious nodes on
the network hkiI/N .
Later, we shall compare the results of local and non-local transmissions with the results for classic SIR models
[3, 12]. In the classic approach one usually uses the continuous time formalism. The epidemic evolution is described
by a set of ﬁrst order ordinary diﬀerential rate equations for the fractions of susceptible, infectious and recovered
agents: s(t) = S(t)/N , i(t) = I(t)/N , r(t) = R(t)/N . The epidemic outbreaks if s(0)R0 > 1. The quantity
φ(t) = i(t) + s(t) −

1
ln s(t) = const
R0

(8)

6
is conserved during the evolution [3, 12]. s(t) is a non-increasing function of time t and r(t) is a non-decreasing function.
The infectious fraction, i(t) increases for t < tmax and reaches a maximum for t = tmax such that R0 s(tmax ) = 1.
Indeed, as one can see from Equation (8), the derivative di/ds = −1 + R10 s changes sign when this condition is fulﬁlled.
For t > tmax the epidemic begins to die out and i(t) decreases from the maximum to zero: i(t) → 0 when t → ∞.
The fraction of susceptible population for t → ∞ gives the level of herd immunity s(t) → shi . The value shi can be
found from Equation (8). In particular, if i(0) is very close to zero and s(0) = 1 − i(0), then shi is a solution to the
equation ln shi = R0 (shi − 1). This yields shi ≈ 0.4172, 0.2032, 0.1074, 0.0595 for R0 = 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, respectively,
to give some examples.
We use the following input parameters in the Monte–Carlo simulations of the epidemic on geometric random
networks: the number of agents N , the mean node degree hki, the basic reproduction number R0 , the expected
duration of the infectious period τ , the probability α of long-range transmissions. As an initial conﬁguration, we
choose I0 randomly selected infectious nodes. The remaining nodes are susceptible. The probability to remain
infectious till the next day is calculated from Equation (4). The probability of virus transmission from an infectious
to a susceptible agent within one day is calculated from Equation (6) which gives

Modelling Background Conditions

In order to assess the impact of epidemics on death statistics, one also has to determine the death statistics and the
background conditions in the absence of an epidemic. This is per se an interesting and very complex problem since
it involves demographic factors, eﬃciency of healthcare systems, statistics of diseases, and many other factors. This
is beyond the scope of this paper. We only model here basic factors to assess how death statistics change during a
pandemic. The population is divided into classes according to health conditions. In the simplest version of the model
we introduce two classes that correspond to healthy people and people with chronic diseases. We label the classes by
H and C, respectively. The division is symbolic, but it allows the inclusion of statistical correlations between health
conditions and mortality in simulations. This is modeled by choosing the mortality rate in the C class to be much
larger than in the H class. The second important diﬀerence between the classes is that the death probability during
epidemics increases faster in the C class than in the H class. The details are given in the next subsection where we
discuss modelling of death statistics.
We assume that the size of the population is constant during the epidemic. The number of deaths is compensated
by the number of newborns. This modiﬁes the SIR dynamics that we described in a simpliﬁed version in the previous
section. Denote the fraction of healthy people at time t by h(t) = H(t)/N , the fraction of chronically ill people by
c(t) = C(t)/N and the fraction of deaths by d(t) = D(t)/N . We have h(t) + c(t) + d(t) = 1.
We implement the population dynamics as a discrete time stochastic process (Markov chain) with the following
evolution equation


pHH pHC pHD
(h(t + 1), c(t + 1), d(t + 1)) = (h(t), c(t), d(t))  PCH pCC pCD  .
(10)
pDH pDC pDD
The matrix in this equation is a stochastic matrix. It describes the transition probabilities between the states H, C, D.
The transition rates pDH and pDC add up to one pDH + pDC = 1, which means that the number of deaths is equal
to the number of newborns. The parameter pDH is the probability that newborns are healthy at birth. For sake of
simplicity, but without loss of generality, we additionally assume pHD = pDC = pCH = 0. The condition pHD = 0
means that the mortality rate of healthy people is zero or it is much smaller than the mortality rate of chronically
ill people. The condition pDC = 0 means that a dead person is replaced by a healthy newborn. Thus the total size
of the population is conserved. The condition pCH = 0 means that a chronically ill person does not become healthy
again. Under these assumptions the last equation can be simpliﬁed to



In our study we choose β and γ to reproduce the values d∗ = 2.3 · 10−5 or d∗ = 2.74 · 10−5 which correspond to the
daily mortality rates in the USA and in Poland, as discussed in Section I. We keep the ratio h∗ /c∗ = 3, so that the
simulated population approximately consists of 75% people in the H class and 25% in the C class. For this choice,
the paremeters of the transfer matrix (11) are

(13)

and h∗ = 34 (1 − d∗ ) and c∗ = 41 (1 − d∗ ).
We conclude this section with two remarks. Firstly, we have assumed that there is no direct transfer from H to D,
from D to C and from C to H within one day, by setting pHD = 0, pDC = 0 and pCH = 0. One should note that the
probabilities of transfers between these classes in two (or more) days are non-zero

Secondly, the square or a higher power of the transfer matrix (11) is also a stochastic matrix. In principle, one can
replace the original transfer matrix with any power of it, and interpret it as a daily transfer matrix. This will not
change the stationary state. The stationary state is a left eigenvector of the transfer matrix associated with the
eigenvalue 1 and it is identical for the transfer matrix (11) or any power of it. The transfer matrix (11) has three
eigenvalues. The one which has the largest absolute value is λ1 = 1 and the second largest is λ2 ≈ 1 − β − γ. The
eigenvalue λ2 tells us about correlation of states at diﬀerent times t, t′ . The correlation function decays exponentially
as exp(−|t − t′ |/T ). The correlation time T can be derived from λ2 : T ≈ −1/ log(λ2 ) ≈ 1/(β + γ). For the transfer
matrix (11) T is of order 104 . By raising this matrix to the n-th power and interpreting the resultant matrix as a
daily transfers matrix one can reduce the autocorrelation time from T to T /n.
D.

Simulating Death Statistics during Epidemic

Let us begin this section by recalling the philosophy behind splitting the population into parts H and C. The
mortality rate and the course of SARS for Covid-19 are known to be strongly correlated with age and co-existing
diseases. Elderly people and people with chronic conditions die from Covid-19 SARS more frequently than young and
healthy people. If one wanted to make the model very realistic one should divide the population into many age groups
and, for each, collect good statistics on SARS frequency and mortality and implement these statistics into the model.
This would make sense only if all other elements of the model were realistic. This is not the case in our study. The
model we develop is minimalistic but it should of course implement all important factors, including the correlation
between underlying diseases and SARS mortality. The split into two classes with distinct statistical properties is the
simplest way of doing it. For example, we assume that the frequency, pH,sars , of SARS cases in H class is much
smaller than the frequency, pC,sars , in the C class. For the sake of simplicity, we assume that the frequency pC,sars
is an order of magnitude larger than pH,sars . The values pH,sars and pC,sars have to be consistent with the average
SARS frequency which was previously assumed to be 1%:
psars = h∗ pH,sars + c∗ pC,sars ≈ 1%,

(15)

where h∗ ≈ 3/4 and c∗ = 1/4. In our simulations we use the following values pH,sars = 1/300 and pC,sars = 3/100,
which give the correct average. For this choice, the frequency of SARS cases in the C class is almost ten times larger
than in H. This is the ﬁrst major diﬀerence between H and C classes. Another factor that plays an important role
in the death statistics during epidemics is the fatality rate for SARS, which also should be signiﬁcantly diﬀerent for
H and C. In the model, we distinguish four situations, labeled by C0 , C1 , H0 , and H1 :

8
• C0 : Patients with SARS from the C class who are not ventilated;
• C1 : Patients with SARS from the C class who are ventilated;
• H0 : Patients with SARS from the H class who are not ventilated;
• H1 : Patients with SARS from the H class who are ventilated.
We assume that the probabilities of dying from SARS are 1.0, 0.3, 0.9 and 0.1 for C0 , C1 , H0 and H1 , respectively.
These values model a diﬀerent course of SARS depending on co-existing diseases and access to a ventilator. They
mean that respiratory ventilation increases the probability of staying alive from 0% to 70% for people with SARS in
the C class, and from 10% to 90% for people with SARS in the H class.
In the simulations, as input paramaters, we use probabilities of dying within one day. They are related to the
probabilities of dying in the whole period of infection by an equation identical to Equation (5) in which hpt i is
interpreted as the probability of dying from SARS during the whole period and p is the probability of dying within
one day. For τ = 10, the corresponding daily rates are 1.0, 0.041, 0.474, 0.011 for compartments C0 , C1 , H0 , H1 ,
respectively. During an epidemic, the number of people with SARS may easily exceed the number of ventilators
available. In the simulations we set V = 27 (or V = 53) ventilators per 100 000 people. These numbers are close to
those for Poland (USA), as discussed in Section I. A patient with SARS occupies a ventilator until he or she recovers
or dies. In the model, this takes ten days (τ = 10) on average. So, if for some time there are more than 2.7 (5.3)
new SARS cases a day per 100 000 people in Poland (USA), the demand for ventilators will exceed the healthcare
capacity.
The ventilator availability is simulated as follows. At any moment of time, the algorithm keeps track of the number
of available ventilators. If this number is larger than zero, and there is a new SARS case, the number is decreased
by one, and one SARS patient is moved between compartments C0 to C1 or H0 to H1 , respectively. The ventilator
is occupied until the patient recovers or dies, in which case the number of available ventilators is increased by one.
Initially, the number of ventilators is set to V per 100 000 people.
Another factor that has to be taken into account in assessing the epidemic total death toll is a lower eﬃciency of the
healthcare system during epidemic [46–48]. This has an impact on the increase of deaths from non-Covid-19 SARS
causes. The eﬀect is signiﬁcant in the group of people with oncological cardiovascular diseases [46–48], but also in
the group of people who require continuous medical assistance. To estimate this eﬀect, systematic statistical surveys
should be carried out. Here we just assume that the number of deaths from other causes than those directly related
to SARS increases by a factor 1 + x during an epidemic, where x is a few percent. In the model this is implemented
by changing the value of the parameter d∗ from d∗ to d∗ (1 + x) and recalculating the parameters β and γ (13) of the
Markov transfer matrix (11) for days when the number of infectious agents is I > 0.

RESULTS

Modes of Infection Transmission

In the model, the epidemic spreads on a geometric random network through local and non-local transmission modes.
The non-local mode is selected with probability α, and the local one with 1 − α, as described before. For α = 1, the
epidemic spreads by the classical SIR mean-ﬁeld dynamics [3, 12] which depends only on the node degree distribution,
while α = 0 it follows a quasi-diﬀusive dynamics reﬂecting the geographic population distribution. In Figure 1 we
show phase portraits for epidemics with diﬀerent values of α on random geometric networks with N = 105 nodes. As
one can see from Figure 1 the results of simulations for α = 1.0 are very well described the by the phase-portrait (8) of
the classical SIR compartmental model [3, 12]. The number of infectious agents it maximal at Smax /N ≈ 1/R0 ≈ 0.4
and the herd immunity is achieved for Shi /N ≈ 0.1 − 0.11, which is the place where the curve crosses the horizontal
axis. This value is close to the mean-ﬁeld prediction (8). The value of the basic reproduction number of the best
ﬁt to the theoretical curve given by the mean-ﬁeld solution (8) is R0 = 2.53. It diﬀers by one percent from the
value R0 = 2.5 used in the Monte–Carlo simulations. The diﬀerence can be attributed to the fact that the classical
mean-ﬁeld dynamics is deterministic [3, 12] and R0 is a number, while in the simulations the dynamics is stochastic
and R0 is the mean value of a random variable. The variance of this random variable introduces some corrections to
the eﬀective value of R0 .
The phase portrait starts to deviate from the mean-ﬁeld solution when α decreases (see Figure 1). As shown in
the right panel in Figure 1 the phase portraits for diﬀerent simulations for α = 1 lie on top of each other and are
consistent with the classical SIR solution. The curves for α = 0 have stochastic shapes and they diﬀer from each
other.

FIG. 1: (Left) Phase portraits of a simulated epidemic, with diﬀerent values of the long-range social mixing parameter α, on
random geometric random network. The simulations are carried out on networks with N = 105 nodes and the mean node
degree hki = 100. The basic reproduction number used in the simulations is R0 = 2.5, the infectious period duration is τ = 10
and the mixing parameter is α = 1.0, 0.1, 0.01, 0.002, 0.0 (from top to bottom). The results for α = 1.0 are shown in symbols
and they are compared to a theoretical mean-ﬁeld result (8) (solid line) going through the symbols. The value of the basic
reproduction number in the mean-ﬁeld result is R0 = 2.53. (Right) Two diﬀerent simulations for α = 1.0 (symbols) compared
to the mean-ﬁeld result (solid line), and three diﬀerent simulations for α = 0.0.

The herd immunity value Shi weakly depends on α (see Figure 1). The values of Shi /N ≈ 0.10 − 0.11 are almost
identical for α = 1, and α = 0. What depends on α is the height of the curve which is a few times larger for α = 1
than for α = 0. This means that long-range social mixing signiﬁcantly speeds up epidemic spreading. The eﬀect
is illustrated in Figure 2 where we compare dynamics of the epidemics for four diﬀerent scenarios which diﬀer by
the basic reproduction number R0 and the long-range social mixing parameter α. One can see that the spread of

FIG. 2: The charts show the dynamics of epidemic for four scenarios: (1) R0 = 2.5, α = 1.0; (2) R0 = 2.5, α = 0.0; (3) R0 = 1.5,
α = 1.0; (4) R0 = 1.5, α = 0.0. The population size is N = 105 , the mean node degree is hki = 100, the expected duration of
the infectious period is τ = 10 in all four cases presented in the ﬁgures. (Left) The number of infectious agents I(t) as a function
of time t expressed in days from the beginning of the epidemic. (Right) The number of immune agents: I(t) + R(t) = N − S(t),
where I(t), R(t) and S(t) are the numbers of infectious, recovered and susceptible agents, respectively. For scenario 1, the herd
immunity level 90% is reached in t = 199 days. In scenarios 2, 3, 4, the herd immunity levels: 89%, 59%, 50% are reached in:
t = 398, 444, 1678 days, respectively.

epidemic depends not only on the basic reproduction number R0 but also on the long-range social mixing parameter
α. Decreasing the parameter α models closing airports, schools, churches, sport arenas, etc., while decreasing the
reproduction number R0 models social distancing that is maintaining physical distance between people, reducing the
frequency of personal contacts, wearing masks as well as disinfection, quarantine, isolation, etc. In the next section,
we will evaluate the impact of these measures on mortality during the epidemic using Monte–Carlo simulations.
Let us make a couple of remarks to conclude this section. If one used, in the simulations, Erdős–Rényi random graphs

10
with exactly the same node degree distribution (1), then one would observe the classical mean-ﬁeld epidemic dynamics
[3, 12] independently of the value of α. There would be no distinction between the local and non-local transmission
modes. Spatial distribution of nodes plays an important role in imitating geographic epidemic spreading. Epidemics
spreading in classical random networks [53] are completely diﬀerent than in geometric graphs, or more generally,
in spatial networks, where it has a quasi-diﬀusive character [18].
The second remark regards the interpretation of results. The trajectories shown in Figure 2 represent single courses
of epidemic for the given parameters. The model is stochastic and non-linear so trajectories for other time courses
for the same parameters may look diﬀerently. For example, the epidemic may die out before it reaches say 1% of the
whole population, because of a statistical ﬂuctuation. We performed multiple runs to see how often it ends below
the 1% threshold. The results for the four scenarios from Figure 2, are presented in the column A of Table I. The
column T shows the average duration time of epidemic, rhi is the immune fraction of the population at the end of the
epidemic, and Rhi /T is the average number of daily infections. Averages were calculated only from those cases that
exceeded the 1% threshold.

TABLE I: Column A shows the percentage of simulated epidemics that expired before reaching 1%; T is the average duration of
epidemics; rhi is the percentage of recovered people at the end of epidemic; and Rhi /T is the average number of new infections
per day for the four scenarios shown in Figure 2.

We shall use the four scenarios in the next section to analyze excess deaths during epidemics. It is, therefore, useful
to take a look at the last column of Table I which contains averages of quotients of Rhi at T . The values correspond
to the average numbers of new infections a day per 100 000 people for scenarios 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively. Since the
model assumes that the frequency of SARS cases is 1%, this means that one can expect c.a. 4.1, 2.1, 1.4 and 0.35 new
SARS cases a day per 100 000 people on average, and much more in the peak. These numbers should be compared
with the healthcare system capacity, which is modeled by the number of available ventilators (or ICU beds) which are
V = 27 for Poland and V = 53 for the USA per 100 000 citizens, as discussed in Section I. A ventilator is occupied
on average for τ = 10 days, thus, the maximum capacity of the healthcare system to admit new SARS patients is
V /τ = 2.7 or 5.3.
B.

Assessing Mortality Rate for Different Scenarios

We are now going to compare excess death statistics for the simulated epidemics for six scenarios:
1. R0′ = R0 = 2.5 and α = 1.0. This simulates do-nothing strategy. An epidemic spreads without any restrictions.
2. R0′ = R0 = 2.5 and α = 0.0. This simulates a suppression of virus transmission through reducing long-range
social mixing.
3. R0′ = 1.5 < R0 and α = 1.0. This simulates social distancing and reduces the transmission rate.
4. R0′ = 1.5 < R0 and α = 0.0. This simulates a quasi-lockdown. Both the local and non-local transmission modes
are restricted.
5. A quasi-lockdown for 300 days, as in item 4, and then do-nothing strategy, as in item 1.
6. A quasi-lockdown for 600 days, as in item 4, and then do-nothing strategy, as in item 1.
The parameters: N = 105 , hki = 100, τ = 10 and I0 = 5 are identical in all simulations. The six above scenarios are
tested in eight systems which diﬀer by the numbers of ventilators V , the daily mortality rates µ, and the frequency
of SARS cases f . We consider the following systems:
1. µ = 2.3; V = 53; These values are close to the real values for the USA, so we call the system in short ‘US’.
2. µ = 2.3; V = 106; The number of ventilators is doubled as compared to that in the USA. We label the system
‘US-V2’.

11
3. µ = 2.3; V = 53; The frequency of SARS cases drops from the default value f = 1% to f = 0.5%. This can be
interpreted as a consequence of introducing an eﬀective drug that twice reduces the number of cases of SARS
requiring ventilation. We call this system in short ‘US-D’.
4. µ = 2.3; V = 106; f = 0.5%; This can be interpreted as a result of doubling the number of ventilators and
introducing an eﬀective drug. We label the system ‘US-V2D’.
and four corresponding systems for Poland:
5. µ = 2.74; V = 27; f = 1%; We call the system in short ‘PL’.
6. µ = 2.74; V = 54; f = 1%; We label the system ‘PL-V2’.
7. µ = 2.74; V = 27; f = 0.5%; We label the system ‘PL-D’.
8. µ = 2.74; V = 54; f = 0.5%; We label the system ‘PL-V2D’.
As far as the mortality rates and the capacity of the health-care system are concerned the ‘US’ and ‘PL’ systems
imitate the situation in the USA and in Poland, while ‘US-V2’ and ‘PL-V2’ simulate a hypothetical situation when the
capacity of the healthcare systems would have been doubled in the two countries. The ‘US-D’ and ‘PL-D’ systems, in
turn, simulate a situation when a pharmaceutic therapy would have reduced the number of SARS patients who require
mechanical ventilation. The resulting eﬀect of introducing an eﬀective drug and doubling the number of ventilators
is simulated by the conﬁgurations ‘US-V2D’ and ‘PL-V2D’.
The six scenarios in those eight systems are studied for diﬀerent values of the parameter x, which controls the
increase of mortality from non-Covid–Sars causes [46–48]. We scan the range of x from 0% to 5%. The results
are collected in Tables II–IX. Each entry corresponds to the average number of additional deaths after 1000 days
per 100 000 people, calculated from 100 independent simulations. The values in parenthesis represent statistical
uncertainties. Only cases of epidemics that exceeded the 1% population threshold were included in the analysis. The
resulting values should be referred to the expected number of deaths in 1000 days per 100 000 people in the absence of
an epidemic, that is: 2740 in Poland and 2300 in the USA. When analyzing data in the tables, it is worth remembering
that for scenario 4, the epidemic lasts longer than 1000 days (see Table I).

Let us, for illustration, present some results graphically. In Figure 3 we show an example of time evolution of the
number of additional deaths during 1000 days after the outbreak in the system ‘US-V2’ for six diﬀerent scenarios.
The ﬁrst four scenarios are shown in the left panel in Figure 3 and the remaining two in the right one. In the
left panel, we additionally draw two reference curves representing the worse-case scenario when no SARS patients
receive required medical assistance during an epidemic, and the scenario when there is no epidemic. For scenario 1,
the number of daily new infections is large and the number of SARS cases exceeds the healthcare system capacity, so

the number of daily SARS deaths is large. The eﬀect manifest as a steep part of the mortality curve. The epidemic
lasts a short time. For scenarios 2, 3 the epidemic lasts longer but the number of daily new infections is much lower.
In eﬀect, most of SARS patients obtain required medical attention, so the daily excess mortality rate is much lower

FIG. 3: The cumulative number of excessive deaths for diﬀerent scenarios in Monte–Carlo simulations of an epidemic for a
population of N = 105 agents on a random geometric network for the system ‘US-V2’ and for x = 0.05. (Left) The upper curve
corresponds to the worst-case scenario, that is, none of the SARS patients receive medical attention during the epidemic. The
four curves below correspond to the scenarios 1-4 presented in the main text and in Figure 2. The dashed line in the bottom
represents the background mortality. (Right) The graphs show the cumulative number of excessive deaths for scenarios 5 and

than in scenario 4. In scenario 4, the epidemic spreads very slowly. The number of the new daily SARS cases is small,
much below the healthcare system capacity. SARS patients are optimally treated, however, deaths from causes other
than Covid are increasing due to protracted epidemiological restrictions. The graphs in the right ﬁgure show what
happens when the lockdown lasts for 300 or 600 and then it is completely lifted. One can see that at the end of the
studied period the total number of deaths is roughly the same as in the ‘do-nothing’ strategy, shown in the ﬁgure
for reference.
As the next example, we compare in Figure 4, additional deaths 1000 days after the outbreak for all six scenarios
in the systems ‘PL-V2’ and ‘US-V2’ which simulate hypothetical situations of the doubled capacity of the healthcare
systems in Poland and the USA. The slope of the graphs increases with the duration of the epidemic as additional
deaths from causes other than Covid are increasing with time. In particular one can see that the curves for scenarios
3 and 4 intersect for x close to 2%. In other words, these two strategies are comparable in this case. For economic
reasons, strategy 3 is, however, much better than strategy 4, because it takes much less time. We also see in the
ﬁgure that strategies 1 and 6 lead roughly to the same number of additional deaths. In Figure 5 we compare the
eﬀect of doubling the healthcare system capacity, measured by the number of ventilators (or ICU beds) in scenario
1 (‘do nothing strategy’) and scenario 4 (‘quasi-lockdown’) in the USA. We use parameters as for the ‘US’, ‘US-V2’,
‘US-D’ and ‘US-V2D’ systems. In the left ﬁgure, we plot graphs for the ‘do-nothing strategy’. We see that excessive
mortality is approximately 23% and slowly varies with x. If the number of ventilators doubled, the excessive mortality
would drop to around 15%. The introduction of a drug, that reduces the number of SARS cases requiring respiratory
ventilation to 0.5%, would reduce the excessive mortality to approximately 8%, and if additionally, the number of
ventilators doubled, to approximately 5%. The picture is completely diﬀerent for scenario 4, as shown in the right
ﬁgure. We see that the graphs for ‘US’ and ‘US-V2’ basically overlap, meaning that the doubling of the number of
ventilators has no eﬀect on mortality in this case. The same holds for ‘US-D’ and ‘US-V2D’. Clearly, in scenario 4, the
quantities of daily infections are so small that the healthcare system has a suﬃcient capacity. Additional ventilators
are unnecessary in this case.

DISCUSSION

We conducted a Monte–Carlo study of epidemic spreading on random geometric networks to assess the eﬃciency of
non-pharmaceutic interventions in reducing the total number of surplus deaths during Covid-19-like epidemics. We
discussed strategies based on social distancing and restricting long-range social mixing. They have diﬀerent eﬀects
on epidemic spreading. Social distancing reduces the basic reproduction number R0 to some eﬀective reproduction
number R0′ < R0 . Restrictions on long-range social mixing reduce virus transmission between remote places. When
long-range mixing is large, an epidemic spreads via mean-ﬁeld dynamics. When it is small, it spreads via quasi-diﬀusive
dynamics depending on the geographic population distribution. We studied the two modes of disease transmission
here.
There are two sources of deaths which contribute to the total death toll during a Covid-19-like epidemic. One is
related to Covid-SARS, and the other one to other diseases. The number of SARS deaths depends on the capacity
of the healthcare system, which in the model is simulated by the number of available respiratory ventilators. If the
daily number of new SARS cases exceeds V /τ , where V is the number of ventilators and τ is the number of days
of using one ventilator for one SARS patient, some people with SARS will not be ventilated and will have lower
survival probability. This eﬀect was simulated in the model. If one assumes that there are 27 or 53 ventilators per
100 000 people, as in Poland or the USA, and τ is approximately 10 days, then V /τ = 2.7 or 5.3. As long as the
number of SARS patients is below V /τ , then the number of deaths caused by SARS is maximally reduced. This eﬀect
can be achieved by slowing down the epidemic. On the other hand, the number of excess deaths from other causes
may increase [46–48] with the epidemic duration so it is not beneﬁcial to slow the rate of epidemic spreading too
much. The optimal solution is to keep the number of SARS cases close to the capacity of the healthcare system, but

15
not much below it.
We also showed that a strategy of maintaining the lockdown for some time and then releasing it by removing all
restrictions has a similar eﬀect on the number of deaths in the long term as if the do-nothing strategy was introduced
right at the beginning. The deaths diﬀer only by the time when they occur: in the do-nothing strategy the mortality
is large at the beginning while in the other case it is large when the lockdown is released.
A strict lockdown makes sense only when one wants to gain time to increase the healthcare system capacity, for
instance, buying new ventilators, increasing the number of ICU beds, training medical personnel or improving medical
and epidemic procedures, or when an eﬀective drug or vaccine is expected to be introduced in a short time. Otherwise,
the optimal strategy is to keep the epidemic progress at the level that the number of SARS patients at any time is
roughly equal to the capacity of the healthcare system. If the number of SARS cases is much larger than that, too
many people will die of SARS. If it is much smaller than that and the epidemic will last too long, many additional
people can die from cancer, cardiovascular diseases and chronic diseases, due to later diagnoses, later admissions for
hospitalization and restricted access to health services [46–48].
Social distancing reduces the herd immunity level, see Table I. This means that after lifting restrictions on social
distance and restoring normal contacts between people, the percentage of immune people will be below the herd
immunity level for the unrestricted system. The system will be unstable, in the sense that a new single infectious
person may trigger a new outbreak. The situation is similar to a superheated liquid, where boiling may occur
spontaneously at any time. For example, the total number of deaths in the simulated epidemic is comparable for
scenarios 2 and 3 (see Figure 3), but the percentage of immune people at the end of the epidemic is 89% in scenario
2 and 59% in scenario 3 (see Table I). The value 89% is close to the herd immunity level for R0 = 2.5 while 59%
is far below it. This means that the epidemic in scenario 3 can restart from the level 59% when the restrictions are
lifted and a new infective person appears. This example shows that strategies reducing long-range social mixing bring
better eﬀects than introducing social distancing locally. They are, however, much more diﬃcult to implement.
Let us compare the current Covid-19 mortality to typical mortality rates in Poland. Rates are quoted as daily
deaths per 100 000 people. For example, in 2014 the daily mortality from all causes was approximately 2.71 including
0.69 from cancer [45, 54]. The daily number of deaths registered as Covid-19 deaths between March the 5th and
September the 27th, 2020, in Poland was approximately 0.031 [55]. According to the WHO data, the cumulative
number of registered Covid infections in Poland in the quoted period was 227.2 per 100 000 people (approximately 2
per mille). The rate of spreading for Covid-19 is much slower than the simulated epidemics (see Table I). Covid-19
has been spreading very slowly so far. If Covid-19 continued spreading at this rate the epidemic would need many
years to end, unless an eﬃcient vaccine is introduced. The number of registered cases is probably much smaller than
the real number of Covid-19 cases because mainly suspected cases have been tested so far, so the statistics may be
very biased. Assuming the number of cases is up to ten times underestimated, that would mean that at the end of
September 2020 approximately 2% of people in Poland are immune to Covid-19, and 98% are still susceptible and face
a Covid-19 infection. If the epidemic speeds up now too quickly, the eﬀect can be as in scenario 5 or 6, discussed in
this paper. According to the model, initial suppression of an epidemic does not reduce accumulated deaths over the
long term, but extends the duration of the epidemic. Most of the European countries decided to suppress the Covid-19
in the ﬁrst six months after the outbreak. Sweden took a diﬀerent approach. The comparison [56] shows that at the
beginning there were relatively more deaths in Sweden than in other European countries, but this comparison does
not take into account that the epidemic in Sweden is at a more advanced stage, which means that there are more
people who are already immune to Covid-19. One has to wait with comparisons until the end of the epidemic.
V.

CONCLUSIONS

Let us underline that the model developed in the paper does not attempt to simulate the Covid-19 pandemic but
only to imitate some of its aspects. The basic assumptions are that immunity can be obtained only by infection and
that reinfections are rare and can be neglected. Under these assumptions, the pandemic ends only after the herd
immunity is achieved. The model has been constructed in a minimalistic way. The scale parameters of the model,
like the number of ventilators and mortality rates simulated the real values. The conclusions drawn from the model
can be treated qualitatively. Let us recall the main ones:
• Strong suppression of an epidemic in the early stages does not signiﬁcantly reduce the total number of deaths
over the long term, but increases the duration of the epidemic;
• In the absence of an eﬃcient drug and a vaccine, the optimal strategy for reducing the total death toll for
Covid-19-like epidemics, is to keep the number of new infections at a level where the number of SARS cases is
as close as possible to the capacity of the healthcare system.

16
• In the early stages of an epidemic, suppression should be only then implemented when one wants to gain time
to increase the eﬃciency of the healthcare system or if the introduction of a drug or a vaccine is expected in a
short time.
In contrast to the model, in the real world, it is very diﬃcult to ﬁne-tune the parameters that control the rate at
which an epidemic spreads and to implement appropriate measures in society, without a vaccine.
