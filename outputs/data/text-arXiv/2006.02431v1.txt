Abstract
Researchers across the globe are seeking to rapidly repurpose existing drugs or discover new
drugs to counter the the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). One promising approach is to train machine
learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) tools to screen large numbers of small molecules.
As a contribution to that effort, we are aggregating numerous small molecules from a variety
of sources, using high-performance computing (HPC) to computer diverse properties of those
molecules, using the computed properties to train ML/AI models, and then using the resulting
models for screening. In this first data release, we make available 23 datasets collected from
community sources representing over 4.2 B molecules enriched with pre-computed: 1) molecular
fingerprints to aid similarity searches, 2) 2D images of molecules to enable exploration and application of image-based deep learning methods, and 3) 2D and 3D molecular descriptors to speed
development of machine learning models. This data release encompasses structural information
on the 4.2 B molecules and 60 TB of pre-computed data. Future releases will expand the data
to include more detailed molecular simulations, computed models, and other products.

Introduction

The Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by transmissible infection of the severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus [1–4], has resulted in millions
of diagnosed cases and over 353 000 deaths worldwide [5], straining healthcare systems, and
disrupting key aspects of society and the wider economy. In order to save lives and reduce
societal effects, it is important to rapidly find effective treatments through drug discovery and
repurposing efforts.

Here, we describe a public data release of 23 molecular datasets collected from community
sources or created internally, representing over 4.2 B molecules. In addition to collecting the
datasets from heterogeneous locations and making them available through a unified interface, we
have enriched the datasets with additional context that would be difficult for many researchers to
compute without access to significant HPC resources. For example, these data now include the
2D and 3D molecular descriptors, computed molecular fingerprints, 2D images representing the
molecule, and canonical simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES) [6] structural
representations to speed development of machine learning models.
This data release encompasses information on the 4.2 B molecules and 60 TB of additional
data. We intend to supplement this dataset in future releases with more datasets, further
enrichments, tools to extract potential drugs from natural language text, and machine learning
models to sift the best candidates for protein docking simulations from the billions of available
molecules. In the following, we first describe the datasets collected, the methodology used to
generate the enriched datasets, and then discuss future directions.

Collected Datasets

We have collected molecules from the datasets listed in Table 1, each of which has either been
made available online by others or generated by our group. The collected datasets include some
specifically collected for drug design (e.g., Enamine), known drug databases (e.g., Drugbank [7,
8], DrugCentral [9, 10], CureFFI [11]), antiviral collections (e.g., CAS COVID-19 Antiviral
Candidate Compounds [12], and the Lit COVID-19 dataset[13]), others that provide known
decoys (DUDE database of useful decoys), and further counterexamples including molecules
used in other domains (e.g., QM9 [14, 15], Harvard Organic Photovoltaic Dataset [16, 17]). By
aggregating these diverse datasets, including the decoys and counterexamples, we aim to allow
researchers the maximal freedom to create training sets for specific use cases. Future releases
will include additional data relevant to SARS-CoV-2 research.

Methodology and Data Processing Pipeline

The data processing pipeline is used to compute different types of features and representations
of billions of small molecules. The pipeline is first used to convert the SMILES representation
for each molecule to a canonical SMILES to allow for de-duplication and consistency across data
sources. Next, for each molecule, three different types of features are computed: 1) molecular
fingerprints that encode the structure of molecules; 2) 2D and 3D molecular descriptors; and
3) 2D images of the molecular structure. These features are being used as input to various
machine learning and deep learning models that will be used to predict important characteristics
of candidate molecules including docking scores, toxicity, and more.

Figure 1: The computational pipeline that is used to enrich the data collected from included
datasets. After collection, each molecule in each dataset has canonical SMILES, 2D and
3D molecular features, fingerprints, and images computed. These enrichments simplify
molecule disambiguation, ML-guided compound screening, similarity searching, and neural
network training respectively.

Description

A per-molecule identifier either obtained from the source dataset or,
if none such is available, defined internally
A canonical SMILES for a molecule, as produced by Open Babel

Canonical Molecule Structures

We use Open Babel v3.0 [42] to convert the simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES)
specifications of chemical species obtained from various sources into a consistent canonical smiles
representation. We organize the resulting molecule specifications in one directory per source
dataset, each containing one CSV file with columns [SOURCE-KEY, IDENTIFIER, SMILES],
where SOURCE-KEY identifies the source dataset; IDENTIFIER is an identifier either obtained
from the source dataset or, if none such is available, defined internally; and SMILES is a canonical SMILES as produced by Open Babel. Identifiers are unique within a dataset, but may not
be unique across datasets. Thus, the combination of (SOURCE-KEY, IDENTIFIER) is needed
to identify molecules uniquely. We obtain the canonical SMILES by using the following Open
Babel command:
obabel {input filename} -O {output filename} -ocan -e

3.2

Molecular Fingerprints

We use RDKit [43] (version 2019.09.3) to compute a 2048-bit fingerprint for each molecule. We
organize these fingerprints in CSV files with each row with columns [SOURCE-KEY, IDENTIFIER, SMILES, FINGERPRINT], where SOURCE-KEY, IDENTIFIER, and SMILES are as
defined in Table 2, and FINGERPRINT is a Base64-encoded representation of the fingerprint.
In Figure 2, we show an example of how to load the fingerprint data from a batch file within

4

individual dataset using Python 3. Further examples of how to use fingerprints are available in
the accompanying GitHub repository [44].

Figure 2: A simple Python code example showing how to load data from a fingerprint file.
(This and other examples are accessible on GitHub [44].)

3.3

Molecular Descriptors

We generate molecular descriptors using Mordred [45] (version 1.2.0). The collected descriptors
(∼1800 for each molecule) include descriptors for both 2D and 3D molecular features. We
organize these descriptors in one directory per source dataset, each containing one or more
CSV files. Each row in the CSV file has columns [SOURCE-KEY, IDENTIFIER, SMILES,
DESCRIPTOR1 ... DESCRIPTORN ]. In Figure 3, we show how to load the data for an
individual dataset (e.g., FFI) using Python 3 and explore its shape (Figure 3-left), and create a
TSNE embedding [46] to explore the molecular descriptor space (Figure 3-right).

Figure 3: Molecular descriptor examples: (left) load descriptor data and (right) create a
simple TSNE projection of the FFI dataset.

3.4

Molecular Images

Images for each molecule were generated using a custom script [44] to read the canonical SMILES
structure with RDKit, kekulize the structure, handle conformers, draw the molecule with rdkit.Chem.Draw, and save the file as a PNG-format image with size 128×128 pixels. For each
dataset, individual pickle files are saved containing batches of 10 000 images for ease of use, with

5

entries in the format (SOURCE, IDENTIFIER, SMILES, image in PIL format). In Figure 4, we
show an example of loading and display image data from a batch of files from the FFI dataset.

Figure 4: Molecular image examples. The examples show how to (top) load the data and
(bottom) display a subset of the images using matplotlib.

Data Access

Providing access to such a large quantity of heterogeneous data (currently 60 TB) is challenging. We use Globus [47] to handle authentication and authorization, and to enable high-speed,
reliable access to the data stored on the Petrel file server at the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility’s (ALCF) Joint Laboratory for System Evaluation (JLSE). Access to this data is
available to anyone following authentication via institutional credentials, an ORCID profile, a
Google account, or many other common identities. Users can access the data through a web user
interface shown in Fig. 5, facilitating easy browsing, direct download via HTTPS of smaller files,
and high-speed, reliable transfer of larger data files to their laptop or a computing cluster via
Globus Connect Personal or an instance of Globus Connect Server. There are more than 20 000
active Globus endpoints distributed around the world. Users may also access the data with a
full-featured Python SDK. More details on Globus can be found at https://www.globus.org.

Figure 5: Data access with Globus. All data are stored on Globus endpoints, allowing users
to access, move, and share the data through a web interface (pictured above), a REST
API, or with a Python client. The user here has just transferred the first three files of
descriptors associated with the E15 dataset to an endpoint at UChicago.

Conclusion and Future Directions

We have released to the community an open resource of molecular structures (as canonical
SMILES), descriptors, 2D images, and fingerprints. We hope these data will contribute to the
discovery of small molecules to combat the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
We expect forthcoming data releases to extend to molecular conformers; incorporate the results of natural language processing extractions of drugs from COVID-related literature; provide
the results of molecular docking simulations against SARS-CoV-2 viral and host proteins; and
include the trained machine learning models that the team is building to identify top candidates
for running various, more expensive calculations.
