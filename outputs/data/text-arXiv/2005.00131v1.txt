Abstract

Seismic noise with frequencies above 1 Hz is often called ‘cultural noise’ and is generally
correlated quite well with human activities. Recently, cities in mainland China and Italy
imposed lockdown restrictions in response to COVID-19, which gave us an unprecedented
opportunity to study the relationship between seismic noise above 1 Hz and human
activities. Using seismic records from stations in China and Italy, we show that seismic
noise above 1 Hz was primarily generated by the local transportation systems. The
lockdown of the cities and the imposition of travel restrictions led to a ~4-12 dB energy
decrease in seismic noise in mainland China. Data also show that different Chinese cities
experienced distinct periods of diminished cultural noise, related to differences in local
response to the epidemic. In contrast, there was only ~1-6 dB energy decrease of seismic
noise in Italy, after the country was put under a lockdown. The noise data indicate that
traffic flow did not decrease as much in Italy, but show how different cities reacted
distinctly to the lockdown conditions.

Introduction

1

Seismic background noise observed at frequencies above 1 Hz primarily consists of
cultural noise, which is generated by human activities (Stutzmann et al., 2000; McNamara
and Buland, 2004; Groos and Ritter, 2009; Green et al., 2017) such as trains (Chen et al.,
2004; Sheen et al., 2009; Ribes-Llario et al., 2017), road traffic (Hao and Ang, 1998;
Coward et al., 2003) and airports (Meng and Ben-Zion, 2018). These noise sources are
now known to be useful for studying the subsurface structures (Nakata et al., 2011; Riahi
and Gerstoft, 2015; Quiros et al., 2016; Ajo-Franklin et al., 2019).

The outbreak of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 disease (hereafter: COVID-19) was
first reported in Wuhan, Hubei, China, in December 2019 (Andersen et al., 2020). In early
to mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, facilitated by increased
travel during the Chinese Lunar New Year. With Wuhan being a major rail transport hub
in China, the virus quickly spread throughout the country. On 23 January 2020, Wuhan and
other cities of Hubei province imposed a lockdown in an effort to quarantine the epicenter
of the COVID-19 outbreak (Lu, 2020). All public transportation except for emergency and
supply vehicles were suspended. A total of 12 other counties to prefecture-level cities in
Hubei, including Enshi, the location of one of the seismic stations used in this study, were
placed on travel restrictions by the end of 24 January 2020 (Table 1). The World Health
Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak to be a Public Health Emergency of
International Concern on 30 January 2020. By chance, this outbreak closely coincided with
the Chinese Lunar New year of 2020, and the Chinese government utilized this coincidence
to facilitate lockdown logistics, essentially extending the traditional week-long national
holiday for several months. In Italy, following the rapid expansion of an outbreak of

2

COVID-19 cases in the north of the country in late February 2020, the Italian government
imposed a lockdown on many of its Northern provinces on 8 March 2020. The lockdown
restricted all movement except for work, health circumstances and essential activities. On
the evening of 9 March, quarantine measures were extended to the entire nation, becoming
effective the next day. This quarantine included some important differences from the
restrictions in China. For example, the lockdown did not apply to the public transportation
system, including buses, railways, flights, and ferry services. People with self-declared
travel exemptions were permitted to travel. On 11 March 2020, the WHO declared the
outbreak a pandemic. This sudden declaration of a public health emergency provides an
unusual dataset in which we can compare changes in seismic noise to the known timings
of social orders.

In this study, we analyze continuous seismic time series from seismic stations in China and
Italy (Fig. 1). We particularly focus on understanding the characteristics of cultural noise
before and after the lockdowns. We show that the lockdown of cities in China led to a ~412 dB reduction in cultural noise. In contrast, there was only ~1-6 dB energy decrease of
cultural noise in Italy, possibly due to ongoing traffic.

Data and Methods

We utilized data from the New China Digital Seismograph Network (NCDSN), in
operation since 1992, with the network code IC. Data from IC were obtained from the
Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology (IRIS) Data Management Center (DMC;

3

www.iris.edu/dms) from 1 January 2000 to 15 April 2020. Those stations are: station
IC.ENH, located in Enshi, Hubei province; station IC.MDJ, located in Mudanjiang,
Heilongjiang province in the northeast region of China; station IC.BJT which is located in
the northwest of Beijing, the capital of China; and station IC.QIZ which is located on
Hainan island in Qiongzhou (Fig. 1a). We also analyzed data from the Italian National
Seismic Network (INSN), with the network code IV. These data, including seismic stations
IV.MILN in Milan, IV.MONC close to Torino, and IV.RMP ~20 km southeast of Rome,
were obtained from the Italian National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology (INGV;
http://webservices.ingv.it) from 15 December 2019 to 15 April 2020 (Fig. 1b).

We analyzed broadband high-gain vertical seismograms (BHZ) and high-sample-rate highgain broadband three-component seismograms (HHN, HHE, and HHZ), with sample rates
of 20 Hz and 100 Hz, respectively. Ground acceleration records were retrieved by
deconvolving the instrumental response from the original seismograms. All seismic data
were divided into one-hour segments with overlapping time intervals of 50% (30 minutes).
Each one-hour segment was detrended, tapered with a Hanning window, and the power
spectral densities (PSD) were calculated. We did not remove earthquake signals from the
time series, because the effects of earthquakes are limited to short time intervals and
predominantly contain their most characteristic signals at lower frequencies. Thus they
have extremely small overall effects on the estimation of cultural noise. We show noise

power levels in units of decibels (dB) with respect to 10log&' ( -. ) . We also performed a
frequency-dependent polarization analysis for the high broadband three-component

seismic data to determine the source directions of the cultural noise (Samson, 1983; Park
et al., 1987; Koper and Hawley, 2010).

Results
Baseline seismic noise patterns at ENH

We use a twenty-year-long seismic record from station IC.ENH, located in Enshi, Hubei
province, China, to establish important baselines and patterns in the cultural noise,
illustrating the detailed ways in which this signal is related to societal behavior. The vertical
PSD for this station is shown in Figure 2. Enshi is a county-level city, about 460 km west

secondary

microseism peaks are distinct in this figure with an approximate frequency band of 0.150.5 Hz. Another distinct peak can be identified at high frequencies, approximately in the
1.5-8 Hz frequency band. As we will show, this peak is caused by cultural noise.

There is a clear increasing trend in seismic noise in Enshi between 2000 and 2020 which
shows a good correlation with the local economic growth and the number of civil motor
vehicles (Figs 2b and 2c). Black arrows in Figure 2a show the timings of the Chinese Lunar
New Year since 2000, correlating well with an annual lull in cultural noise due to decreased
traffic flow and closure of factories. The red arrow in Figure 2a indicates the time that
Enshi came under lockdown, resulting in a sudden decrease of cultural noise. We explore

5

the effects of this lockdown by examining vertical component PSDs for the first three
months of the year, comparing vertical PSDs between 2018 (Fig. 3a) and 2020 (Fig. 4a).

The 2018 data at this site provide information on various aspects of social life in a regular
year, including diurnal variations, a holiday effect, and seasonal variations (Figs 3a, 5a and
5b). We find that two distinct cultural noise spectral peaks are evident, with approximate
frequency bands of 1.5–8 Hz and 10-20 Hz. Diurnal variations are strong; there is higher
seismic noise during the daytime than at night. The largest change in noise patterns is
correlated well with the national holiday of the Chinese Lunar New Year, which typically
starts one day before the New Year day and ends five days after. The noise lull is the result
of cessation in typical travel and industrial activity. In 2018, this is evident from February
15 to February 21 (Julian days 46 to 52). During this period there is, on average, a 10 dB
noise drop in the frequency band 1.5-8 Hz, compared to the background level. In detail, we
show that the noise level started to drop 5-6 days before the holiday and did not fully
recover until another two weeks after (Fig. 7). This frequency band also exhibits seasonal
variations (Fig. 5a) which is longer strong noise signal in the summer than the winter
corresponding to variation in daylight hours. We infer that 1.5-8 Hz noise is probably
generated by the local factories, pedestrians (Alyamkin and Eremenko, 2011), and lowspeed urban road traffic (Green et al., 2017).

By contrast, the noise in the frequency band 10-20 Hz is relatively stable during the Chinese
Lunar New Year. This persistence allows the noise source to be identified. Long (1971)
found that moving vehicles on the freeway generate noise with peak frequency at about 10-

6

20 Hz, and that this signal can be detected within 5-8 km. The station IC.ENH is located
~3 km from the freeway G50 to its southeast (Fig. 1a). The G50 is a 1900 km long and
east-west bound expressway connecting Shanghai, China to the east and Chongqing, China
to the west. While we are not yet able to retrieve the record of daily traffic-flow volume on
the G50 near city Enshi, traffic data for a segment of this freeway named as Huanghuang
east of Wuhan can be accessed (http://www.hhgs.org.cn/) and we use it as the
representative of the general traffic flow on this road within Hubei province. The average
daily traffic-flow volume on the freeway during the 2018 Chinese Lunar New Year was
only 31% less than the daily volume on the regular days (Table 2). This suggests that the
cultural noise peak in the frequency band 10-20 Hz can be explained by the high-speed
cars on the freeway. This is further supported by the back azimuths of the polarization
ellipsoids in Figure 3b. The source direction of cultural noise in the 10-20 Hz frequency
band is from the southeast (back azimuths are ~ 120° – 150°) during the daytime, indicating
the noise arrives from the direction of the freeway. The northwest noise source during the
night (Fig. 3c) is probably from the downtown area, which lies in that direction. This
dataset also shows a period of freeway traffic control between 13 September 2018 and 26
October 2018, when freeway access was limited or cut off due to road repairs. Station
IC.ENH exhibits clear 10-20 Hz noise energy reduction during this period (Fig. 5b).

Our findings agree with previous analyses of frequency bands typical for road traffic
(Groos and Ritter, 2009; Boese et al., 2015; Chang et al., 2016; Green et al., 2017) and
consistent with a correlation between the cars’ noise frequency content and their speed: the
peak frequency band for the low-speed urban road traffic is 1.5-8 Hz, and for the high-

7

speed cars traveling on the freeway it is 10-20 Hz (Long, 1971). Overground rail
transportation could generate the seismic noise above 30 Hz in the seismograms (Chen et
al., 2004; Boese et al., 2015; Riahi and Gerstoft, 2015; Green et al., 2017), and the Chinese
Lunar New Year is the peak travel season for the railway stations. However, according to
our observations, there is a 5 dB reduction in the frequency band 30-40 Hz during this
period, suggesting that the noise generated by the rail does not dominate our seismic record,
perhaps due to the high attenuation and relatively far distance (8 km).

Comparison of living habits between China and Italy.

These data also reveal the various living habits of people in different cities (Fig. 5). For
station IC.ENH located in Enshi (Fig. 5a and 5b), China, as we mentioned before, we can
see the lull caused by the Chinese Lunar New Year in January or February (Fig. 2). In
general, people in Enshi show most activity from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. during the winter. In the
summer, people tend to be active for longer, from 7:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. There is a lunchtime lull year-round at noon. However, for the frequency band 10-20 Hz generated by the
traveling cars on the freeway (Fig. 5b), the lunch-time lull is longer and continues for about
two hours during the summer. This may reflect hot noon-time weather in the summer
discouraging people from going outside. Interestingly, the Chinese data do not show clear
weekly cycles; work and activity continue week-round. In Milan, Italy (Fig. 5c and 5d),
people work longer during weekdays (from 5 a.m. to 11 p.m.) and show clear differences
in behavior on weekdays compared to the weekend. We can also see the cultural noise lull
caused by local holidays, such as Easter Monday (April 22), Liberation Day (April 25),

8

Ferragosto (August 15) and Christmas (December 25). The cultural noise in the frequency
band 10-40 Hz lull caused by the 2019 Christmas holiday for station IV.MILN is ~1 dB at
the daytime and ~2 dB at nighttime (Fig. 8b). Interestingly, there are four distinct sources
in frequency bands 1-2 Hz, 3-8 Hz, 10-20 Hz, and 20-40 Hz for station IV.RMP which
located in the ~20 km southeast of Rome (Fig. 8e). We estimate the first peak in 1-2 Hz
(Fig. 9a), with a ~5 dB reduction during the 2019 Christmas period, is generated by
pedestrians (Alyamkin and Eremenko, 2011), since we expect fewer pedestrians on the
street during the holiday of Christmas. By comparison to the Chinese data, we believe the
second peak at 3-8 Hz (Fig. 9b) is generated by the local factories and low-speed cars on
the street; this band a ~3dB deduction at Christmas. Finally, the high-speed cars on the
freeway and the trains are responsible for the frequency bands at 10-20 Hz and 20-40 Hz
respectively, which exhibit a ~2 dB reduction during Christmas (Fig. 8f). However, there
is no obvious energy diminishing during the Christmas holiday for station IV.MONC (Fig.
8d), in which the noise is mainly from the freeway nearby (Fig. 1b). These observations
are consistent with our observations from China that there are still lots of traveling cars on
the freeway during the Chinese Lunar New Year holiday. The peak frequency of cultural
noise for IV.MONC generated by the traveling cars on the freeway is ~20-30 Hz rather
than 10-20 Hz. We estimate that this difference may relate to the different local geological
conditions or simply the different regulations of highway speed limit (80 km/hr on G50 in
Enshi, Hubei province in China vs. 130 km/hr in Italy). We note that there is a remarkable
difference in the level of cultural noise (1-40 Hz) between IV.MILN, IV.RMP and
IV.MONC, as stations IV.MILN and IV.RMP exhibit much higher noise. We believe the
reason is that stations IV.MILN and IV.RMP is in an urban area, whereas IV.MONC is in

9

a mountainous area (Fig. 1b). Italy follows the European Summer Time annual Daylight
Saving Time procedure setting the clocks forward one hour from standard time during the
summer months. In 2019, summer time was from March 31 to October 27. Figures 5c and
5d show a clear time shift of cultural noise energy due to these clock changes. The abrupt
time shift in the frequency band 10-40 Hz (Fig. 5d) at the time of clock changes is reflective
of the fact that this energy is generated by public transportation, such as trains, and buses,
which have a fixed schedule. We highlight how cultural noise data reflects nuances in
societal behavior in order to illustrate how these data can provide a detailed proxy account
of the societal COVID-19 response.

Cultural noise changes in China

In 2020 we observe a sharp decrease in cultural noise in (Figs 4a and 4d) which coincides
with the time when the city of Enshi went under lockdown due to COVID-19 (Table 1),
and the extended new year holiday. By comparison to historical data (Fig. 2), in the 1-8 Hz
band the ~12 dB decrease was equivalent to the abrupt cessation of roughly 20 years’ worth
of urbanization and development activity. In Figure 4a, a weak peak still appears during
the lockdown time in the frequency band around 10-20 Hz. This could be caused by the
official vehicles and the supply vehicles on the road (Groos and Ritter, 2009; Boese et al.,
2015; Chang et al., 2016; Green et al., 2017). The energy of this peak increases steadily as
more vehicles appear on the road from approximately Julian day 70 onwards. Directional
analysis of this noise reveals that it mainly comes from the southeast even at night (Fig. 4b
and 4c) where the national freeway is located (Fig. 1a). The systematic increase in traffic

10

as the lockdown eased serves as a natural experiment that we can leverage to better
understand the relationship between traffic and seismic noise. Seismic noise generated by
pedestrians and local industry is usually in the frequency band 1-5 Hz (Alyamkin and
Eremenko, 2011). On the one hand, the marked decrease of seismic energy in this
frequency band during the lockdown period (Fig. 4a) reflects the many fewer pedestrians
and cars on the street. On the other hand, the observation that 1-5 Hz social noise increased
~5 dB in a two week period from Julian days 71 to 85 suggests that Enshi started to
gradually reopen much earlier than the official lift of the lockdown. Note that the increase
in social noise at Enshi is correlated well with the traffic flow volume at the highway
segment 600 km away (Fig. 4d). It suggests that this gradual reopening is a province-wide
activity.

The lockdown of Hubei province came one day before the 2020 Chinese Lunar New Year
(January 25), the most important festival in the country. To quantify the energy reduction
in cultural noise caused by the coronavirus alone, we compared the daily cultural noise
energy variation between 2018 and 2020 using the day of Chinese Lunar New Year as the
reference time in Figure 7. It is worth noting that they show a similar pattern before the
lockdown of the cities in the Hubei province. However, after the lockdown, the cultural
noise energy in 2020 is much lower than in 2018. The average reduction was ~10 dB in the
frequency band 1.5-8 Hz and ~12 dB in 10-20 Hz for the station IC.ENH (Fig. 7c).

We conducted a similar analysis at several other stations located within urban centers in
China (Fig. 6 and Fig. 7). None of these regions came under direct lockdown. We again

11

compared the vertical component power spectral densities between the years 2018 (Fig. 6,
left) and 2020 (Fig. 6, right). We found that the peak frequencies of cultural noise appear
to be different for different cities. This is probably due to the relative distances to the noise
sources and the installation (environmental) conditions at different station sites (Trnkoczy
et al., 2012).

For station IC.MDJ, located in the northeast region of China, the cultural noise is seen in
mainly two peaks, similarly to at IC.ENH. One spans the frequency band 5-10 Hz and the
other the frequency band 10-30 Hz. The first peak seems to be consistent with the local
road traffic, and the second peak is consistent with the noise by the nearby railway that is
at a distance of about 3 km. A substantial change in noise is observed coincident with the
lockdown of Hubei and Lunar New Year. The duration and magnitude of this noise change,
when compared to the 2018 record, demonstrates that this change substantially exceeded
the ‘normal’ variation due to the new year holiday, indicating that industry and civilians
altered behavior in Mudanjiang in response to COVID-19 despite the lack of formal local
lockdown. There was a ~3 dB reduction in the frequency band 5-10 Hz and ~4 dB in the
frequency band 10-30 Hz (Fig. 7a). The lowest noise conditions persisted for ~20 days,
followed by a slow return to normal noise levels over a further ~60 day period.

Station IC.BJT, located in Beijing, shows only the lower frequency cultural noise, in this
station mostly at 2-5 Hz (Figs 6c and 6d). This may be related to site installation: this
seismograph was installed in a deep tunnel, which might suppress high-frequency noise
(McNamara and Buland, 2004). This 2-5 Hz cultural noise is likely to be generated by both

12

the road traffic and by pedestrians (Alyamkin and Eremenko, 2011; Boese et al., 2015;
Green et al., 2017). As with other stations, the COVID-19 effects produced a protracted
lull in the cultural noise, with a reduction ~4 dB in 2-5 Hz (Fig. 7b). At this station the
duration of the noise reduction was longer, more than 81 days. The return to ‘normal’
cultural noise levels was much substantially more gradual than at other stations, with a
slow increase in amplitudes from Julian day 30 and recovery to early-January noise levels
at approximately Julian day 100 (76 days after the Hubei lockdown started). At time of
writing (Julian day 102) noise levels at IC.BJT are still lower than the ‘normal’ background
noise levels of 2018, implying a persistent alteration in traffic and social patterns from
‘business as usual’.

Station IC.QIZ, located on Hainan island, which is famous for its tourism industry during
the winter, shows a similar pattern to IC.ENH (Figs 6e and 6f), with a dominant cultural
noise peak in the range 2-20 Hz that seems to include distinct sources in bands 2-8 Hz and
8-20 Hz. This is probably because both stations are closer to the freeways (unlike station
IC.MDJ) (Fig. 1a). IC.QIZ manifests a similar noise variation to IC.MDJ, with a ~30 day
lull, followed by a gradual return to ‘normal’ but still less than the background levels in
2018 over a further ~51 day period (Fig. 7d). The average reduction is ~10 dB in the
frequency band 2-8 Hz and ~8 dB in the frequency band 10-20 Hz. Interestingly, the higher
frequency (10-20 Hz) noise at this station seems to recover faster than the lower frequency
(2-8 Hz) noise. If the former reflects high-speed vehicular traffic and the latter reflects
pedestrian traffic, this staggered recovery may result from civilians feeling safe travelling
in their own cars earlier than they feel comfortable walking around.

Cultural noise changes in Italy during lockdown

Italy was put under a dramatic lockdown (Table 1) as the coronavirus continued to spread
in the country. Although it was one of the toughest responses implemented outside of China,
their lockdown policy was less strict than China. As a result, we might expect traffic noise
not to have decreased as sharply as we found in mainland China. We find only ~1 dB of
energy decrease of cultural noise in the frequency band 10-40 Hz in IV.MILN and ~5 dB
of decrease in IV.MONC after Italy declared its lockdown (Fig. 8). For station IV.RMP,
the energy reduction was ~6 dB in 1-2 Hz (Fig. 9a), indicating many fewer pedestrians on
the street. There is a ~4 dB reduction in the frequency band 3-8 Hz (Fig. 9b) and ~5 dB
reduction in the frequency band 10-40 Hz (Fig. 8f), which implies the decrease in trafficvolume was less than the reduction in foot-traffic. Our observations are consistent with the
local lockdown policies. The Italian authorities required that their schools, universities,
theaters, cinemas, bars, and nightclubs must be closed. Religious gatherings, including
funerals and weddings, and sporting events were suspended or postponed. Restaurants and
bars were allowed to be open from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m., and shopping malls and markets could
open on weekdays with a decreased density of patrons. Under such conditions, the cultural
noise should be primarily generated by transportation systems. Lack of any decreasing
seismic noise across the lockdown timing seems to corroborate the inference that the
primary noise source was public transportation, which was not impacted by the lockdown
(Pepe et al., 2020). It appears that the continuous operation of the public transportation
system maintained the persistently high level of cultural noise.

14

Despite this, a modest but significant decrease in noise level is observed at all Italian
stations, from a period beginning at the official lockdown until at least Julian day 106 (time
of writing). At stations with higher overall cultural noise (IV. MILN and IV.RMP), the
pattern of noisy weekdays and less noisy weekends continues after the lockdown, although
both shift to lower-noise than their pre-lockdown counterparts. In fact, for IV.RMP, near
Rome, the post-lockdown week days are less noisy than even the quiet pre-lockdown
weekends.

For station IV.MILN, the lowest noise energy appears in the first weekend after lockdown
of the country, with the lowest noise conditions persisting just for one day. We also note
that even the quietest post-lockdown day is not as quiet as the 2019 Christmas day. Since
Julian day 74 we observe a slow increase in noise over a further 40 day period, perhaps
indicating that civilians are increasingly willing to go outside in Milan. However, the noise
levels have not yet reached pre-lockdown levels. For station IV. MONC, seismic noise
reduced ~5dB following the lockdown over a period of 5 days. There is no clear trend of
noise increase at this station, perhaps indicating a more strict maintenance of social
distancing and stay-at-home behavior. Station IV.RMP, by contrast, recorded a nearimmediate reduction in seismic noise over the few days following the lockdown, and
actually manifests a gradually decreasing trend for the entire cultural noise frequency band
1-40 Hz. The decrease is particularly evident in the 1-2 Hz and 3-8 Hz period bands
associated with pedestrians and local urban traffic (Fig. 9). This trend may imply that

15

people in Rome are increasingly concerned by the COVID-19 pandemic and are adjusting
their behavior to be more conservative.

Conclusions

Seismic records provide unique signals that can elucidate human activities on a large scale.
In this paper, we examined variations in seismic noise between 1 Hz and 40 Hz, which
provide proxy information on cultural behavior. In particular, we focused on the effects of
governmental lockdowns and self-imposed behavioral alterations due to the outbreak of
COVID-19 in mainland China and Italy. Using seismic records from stations in China and
Italy, we show that the cultural noise in the range of about 2-40 Hz was primarily generated
by the local transportation and population sources and study the living habits of local
people by using seismic data. The lockdown of the cities and imposition of travel
restrictions led to a ~4-12 dB energy decrease in cultural noise on the background of the
noise energy in mainland China. According to our observations, different Chinese cities
experienced distinct periods of diminished cultural noise, related to the differing local
responses to the epidemic. A marked noise change was found even in cities that did not
come under government-mandated quarantine. In contrast, there was only ~1-6 dB energy
decrease of cultural noise after Italy was put under a total lockdown, due to continuous
public transport. Italian cities seem to be responding differently in terms of social behavior
as the lockdown continues.

The base image shows the cumulative cases of COVID-19 for different provinces in
mainland China as of 12 March 2020, based on data from the World Health Organization.
The insets show the seismometer locations in each urban environment. IC.MDJ is located
close to a railway line and a major road. IC.BJT is also close to the freeway and railway
line but the seismometer is deployed in the deep tunnel. IC.ENH is located north west of a
major freeway and south east of the local urban center. IC.QIZ is on the Hainan island and
is also close to the freeway to its north. (b) Same as (a) but for Italy, highlighting seismic
stations IV.MILN in Milan, IV.MONC in the area of Torino, and IV.RMC near Rome.
Inset maps show local maps: station IV.MILN was deployed in the urban area along the
railway line and freeway. Station IV.MONC is in the mountainous area but close to the
freeway. Station IV.RMP is in the suburbs 20 km southeast of Rome, Italy’s capital city.
