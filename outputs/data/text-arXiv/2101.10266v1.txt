Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged scientists and
policy-makers internationally to develop novel approaches to
public health policy. Furthermore, it has also been observed
that the prevalence and spread of COVID-19 varies across different spatial, temporal and demographics. Despite ramping
up testing, we still are not at the required level in most parts
of the globe. Therefore, we utilize self-reported symptoms
survey data to understand trends in the spread of COVID19. The aim of this study is to segment populations that are
highly susceptible. In order to understand such populations,
we perform exploratory data analysis, outbreak prediction,
and time-series forecasting using public health and policy
datasets. From our studies, we try to predict the likely % of
population that tested positive for COVID-19 based on selfreported symptoms. Our findings reaffirm the predictive value
of symptoms, such as anosmia and ageusia. And we forecast
that the % of population having COVID-19-like illness (CLI)
and those tested positive as 0.15% and 1.14% absolute error respectively. These findings could help aid faster development of the public health policy, particularly in areas with
low levels of testing and having a greater reliance on selfreported symptoms. Our analysis sheds light on identifying
clinical attributes of interest across different demographics.
We also provide insights into the effects of various policy enactments on COVID-19 prevalence.

Introduction

The rapid progression of the COVID-19 pandemic has provoked large-scale data collection efforts on an international
level to study the epidemiology of the virus and inform policies. Various studies have been undertaken to predict the
spread, severity, and unique characteristics of the COVID19 infection, across a broad range of clinical, imaging, and
population-level datasets (Gostic et al. 2020; Liang et al.
2020; Menni et al. 2020a; Shi et al. 2020). For instance,
(Menni et al. 2020a) uses self-reported data from a mobile app to predict a positive COVID-19 test result based
upon symptom presentation. Anosmia was shown to be the
strongest predictor of disease presence, and a model for
disease detection using symptoms-based predictors was indicated to have a sensitivity of about 65%. Studies like
(Parma et al. 2020) have shown that ageusia and anosmia are

widespread sequelae of COVID-19 pathogenesis. From the
onset of COVID-19 there also has been significant amount
of work in mathematical modeling to understand the outbreak under different situations for different demographics
(Menni et al. 2020b; Saad-Roy et al. 2020; Wilder, Mina,
and Tambe 2020). Although these works primarily focus on
population level the estimation of different transition probabilities to move between compartments is challenging.
Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and the University
of Maryland (UMD) have built chronologically aggregated
datasets of self-reported COVID-19 symptoms by conducting surveys at national and international levels (Fan et al.
2020; Delphi group 2020). The surveys contain questions
regarding whether the respondent has experienced several of
the common symptoms of COVID-19 (e.g. anosmia, ageusia, cough, etc.) in addition to various behavioral questions
concerning the number of trips a respondent has taken outdoors and whether they have received a COVID-19 test.
In this work, we perform several studies using the
CMU, UMD and OxCGRT (Fan et al. 2020; Delphi group
2020; Hale et al. 2020) datasets. Our experiments examine
correlations among variables in the CMU data to determine
which symptoms and behaviors are most correlated to high
% of CLI. We see how the different symptoms impact the
% of population with CLI across different spatio-temporal
and demographic (age, gender) settings. We also predict the
% of population who got tested positive for COVID-19 and
achieve 60% Mean Relative Error. Further, our experiments
involve time-series analysis of these datasets to forecast CLI
over time. Here we identify how different spatial window
trends vary across different temporal windows. We aim
to use the findings from this method to understand the
possibilities of modelling CLI for geographic areas in which
data collection is sparse or non-existent. Furthermore,
results from our experiments can potentially guide public
health policies for COVID-19.
Using self reported symptoms collected across spatiotemporal windows to understand the prevalence and outbreak of COVID-19 is the first of its kind to the best of our
knowledge.

Datasets

The CMU Symptom Survey aggregates the results of
a survey run by CMU (Delphi group 2020) which was
distributed across the US to ˜70k random Facebook users
daily. It has 104 columns, including weighted (adjusted for
sampling bias), unweighted signals, demographic columns
(age, gender etc) for county and state level data. We use the
data from Apr. 4, ’20 to Sep. 11, ’20.
The UMD Global Symptom Survey aggregates the results of a survey conducted by the UMD through Facebook
(Fan et al. 2020). We use the data of 968 regions, available
from May 01 to September 11. There are 28 unweighted
signals provided, as well as a weighted form (adjusted
for sampling bias). These signals include self reported
symptoms, exposure information, general hygiene etc.
The Oxford COVID-19 Government Response
Tracker (OxCGRT) (Hale et al. 2020) contains government COVID-19 policy data as a numerical scale value
representing the extent of government action.

Method and Experiments

Correlation Studies: Correlation between features of the
dataset provides crucial information about the features and
the degree of influence they have over the target value.
We conduct correlation studies on different sub groups
like symptomatic, asymptomatic and varying demographic
regions in the CMU dataset to the discover relationships
among the signals and with the target variable. We also
investiage the significance of obesity and population density
on the susceptibility to COVID-19 at state level (CDC
2020). Please refer to the Appendix for more information.
Outbreak Prediction: For outbreak prediction, we predict the % of the population that tested positive from CMU
state data. After pruning unweighted and other signals, we
are left with 36 input signals (Refer to the Appendix for
details about the signal pruning process). We rank these
36 signals according to their f regression (f statistic of the
correlation to the target variable) and predict the target
variable using the top n ranked features. We experiment
n features from 1 to 36 for various demographic groups.
Linear Regression, Decision Tree and Gradient Boosting
models (Pedregosa et al. 2011) are tested. Only the results
for the best-performing model (Gradient Boosting) are
shown.
Time Series Analysis: We predict the % of people that
tested positive using the CMU dataset and % of people with
CLI with the UMD dataset, using various combinations of
features in the CMU (36) and UMD (56) datasets for multivariate multi-step time series forecasting. Given the data is
spread across different spatial windows (geographies) at a
state level, we employ an agglomerative clustering method
independently on symptoms and behavioural/external patterns, and sample locations which are not in the same cluster for our analysis. Using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller

% tested COVID positive.

test (Cheung and Lai 1995) we found the time series samples for these spatial windows to be stationary. Furthermore,
we bucket the data based on the age and gender of the respondents, to provide granular insights on the model performance on various demographics. With a total of 12 demographic buckets [(age, gender) pairs] available, we use a
Vector Auto Regressive (VAR) (Holden 1995) model and an
LSTM (Gers, Schmidhuber, and Cummins 1999) model for
the experiments. We also look at the impact of government
policies (contact tracing, etc) on the spread of the virus.

Results and Discussion

Correlation Studies: State level analysis revealed a mild
positive correlation between the % of people tested positive
and statewide obesity level. Here the obseity is defined as
BMI> 30.0 (NIH 2020). These results are consistent with
prior clinical studies like (Chan et al. 2020) and indicate that
further research required to see if lack of certain nutrients
like Vitamin B, Zinc, Iron or having a BMI> 30.0 could
make an individual more susceptible to COVID-19. Figure
1 shows the correlation amongst multiple self reported
symptoms and the symptoms having a significant positive
correlations are highlighted. This clearly reveals that
Anosmia , Ageusia and fever are reletively strong indicators
of COVID-19. From Figure 5, we see that contact with a
COVID-19 positive individual is strongly correlated with
testing COVID-19 positive. Conversely, the % of population
who avoid outside contact and the % of population testing
positive for COVID-19 have a negative correlation. We
also find a mild positive correlation between population
density and % of population reporting COVID-19 positivity,
which indicate easier transmission of the virus in congested
environment. These observations reaffirm the highly contagious nature of the virus and the need for social distancing.
The above results motivate us to estimate the % of people
tested COVID-19 positive based on % of people who had
a direct contact with anyone who recently tested positive.
In doing so, we achieve an MRE of 2.33% and MAE of 0.03.

be analysed by combining the CMU, UMD data and Oxford
data (Hale et al. 2020). A particular analysis from that is
reported here, where we notice that lifting of stay at home
restrictions resulted in a sudden spike in the number of
cases. This can be visualised in figure 4.

Table 3: The errors of forecasting the outbreak of COVID-19
(% of people tested and positive) for the next 30 days using
LSTM model.

Error Metric - We find that a low MAE value is misleading in the case of predicting the spread of the virus; the
MAE for outbreak prediction is low and has a small range
(1-1.4) but more than 75% of the target lies between 0-2.6,
meaning only a small percentage of the entire population
has COVID-19. This makes MRE a better metric to use.
Outbreak prediction on CMU Dataset: Table 1 shows
best accuracy achieved per dataset. For every dataset, the
best ”n” is in 30s. We achieve an MRE of 60.40% for the
entire dataset. The performance is better on Female-only
data when compared to Male-only data. The performance is
slightly better on 55+ age data than other age groups. This
can also be observed from figure 2.
Top Features - Except for minor reordering, the top 5
features are - CLI in community, loss of smell, CLI in house
hold (HH), fever in HH, fever across every data split. Top
6-10 features per data split are given in table 3. We can
see that ’worked outside home’ and ’avoid contact most
time’ are useful features for male, female and 55+ age
data. Figure 2 shows mre vs number of features selected
for different data splits. Overall, the error decreases as we
add more features. However, the decrease in error isn’t very
considerable when we go beyond 20 features ( < 1%).
Time Series Analysis - As seen in Tables 2, 3, 4 and
5, we are able to forecast the PCT CLI with an MRE of
15.11% using just 23 features from the UMD dataset. We
can see that VAR performs better than LSTM on an average.
This can be explained by the dearth of data available.
Furthermore, we can see that the outbreak forecasting on
New York was done with 11.28% MRE, making use of only
10 features. This might be caused by an inherent bias in the
sampling strategy or participant responses. For example,
the high correlation noted between anosmia and COVID-19
prevalence suggests several probable causes of confounding
relationships between the two. This could also occur if

The change in slope from the start to the end of the graph
strongly supports our previous inference that the most important feature has a huge significance on the performance
and error rate and reaffirms our features selection algorithm.

positive COVID-19 tests and % of respondents who show
COVID-like illness. By clustering datasets across different
demographics, we reveal micro and macro level insights
into the relationship between symptoms and outbreaks
of COVID-19. These insights might form the basis for
future analysis of the epidemiology and manifestations of
COVID-19 in different patient populations. Our correlation
and prediction studies identify a small subset of features
that can predict measures of COVID-19 prevalence to a high
degree of accuracy. Using this, more efficient surveys can
be designed to measure only the most relevant features to
predict COVID-19 outbreaks. Shorter surveys will increase
the likelihood of respondent participation and decrease the
chances that respondents providing false information. We
believe that our analysis will be valuable in shaping health
policy and in COVID-19 outbreak predictions for areas with
low levels of testing by providing prediction models that
rely on self-reported symptom data.
In the future, we plan to use advanced deep learning models for predictions. Furthermore, given the promise shown
by population level symptoms data we find more relevant
and timely problems that can be solved with individual
data. Building machine learning systems on data from mobile/wearable devices can be built to understand users’ vitals, sleep behavior etc., have the data shared at an individual
level, can augment the participatory surveillance dataset and
thereby the predictions made. This can be achieved without
compromising on the privacy of the individual. We also plan
to compare the reliability of such participatory surveillance
methods with actual number of cases in the corresponding
regions and it’s generalisability across the population.

Feature Pruning
We drop demographic columns such as date, gender, age etc. Next we drop the unweighted columns because their weighted
counterparts exist. We also drop features like % of people who got tested negative, weighted % of people who got tested positive
etc as these are directly related to testing and would make the prediction trivial. Further, we drop derived features like(t), like
estimated % of people with influenza-like illness because they were not directly reported by the respondents. Finally, we drop
the features which calculate mean (such as average number of people in respondent’s household who have cli) because their
range was in the order of 1050 . After the entire process we are left with 36 features.

Time Series
In table 8 we continue to experiment with different spatial windows, like trying to predict PCT CLI for different locations like
”Tokyo” and ”British Columbia” using different combination of features. Further on table 10 analysis is done on more US
states with an LSTM based deep learning model to predict PCT CLI and we notice that there is no significant gain in using DL
models (probably due to lack of data). The pct community sick is another variable which we try to predict, and the results can
be seen in table 9
In figs [13,15] we do Dynamic Time Warping(DTW) to compare how well our forecasted timeseries curve matches with
the original curve. DTW was used due to the flexibility to compare timeseries signals which are of different lengths. This will
enable us to compare different temporal windows across different spatial windows to understand the effectiveness of the model
at different contexts.
