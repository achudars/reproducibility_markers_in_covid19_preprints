Abstract. We present a data-driven optimal control approach which integrates the
reported partial data with the epidemic dynamics for COVID-19. We use a basic
Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model, the model parameters are timevarying and learned from the data. This approach serves to forecast the evolution of the
outbreak over a relatively short time period and provide scheduled controls of the epidemic. We provide efficient numerical algorithms based on a generalized Pontryagin
Maximum Principle associated with the optimal control theory. Numerical experiments
demonstrate the effective performance of the proposed model and its numerical approximations.

1. Introduction
The outbreak of COVID-19 epidemic has resulted in over millions of confirmed and
death cases, evoking fear locally and internationally. It has a huge impact on global
economy as well as everyone’s daily life. Numerous mathematical models are being produced to forecast the spread of COVID-19 in the US and worldwide [3, 20, 9, 39]. These
predictions have far-reaching consequences regarding how quickly and how strongly governments move to curb the epidemic. We aim to exploit the abundance of available data
and integrate existing data with disease dynamics based on epidemiological knowledge.
One of the well-known dynamic models in epidemiology is the SIR model proposed by
Kermack and McKendrick [32] in 1927. Here, S, I, R represent the number of susceptible,
infected and recovered people respectively. They use an ODE system to describe the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases among the population. In the current COVID-19
pandemic, actions such as travel restrictions, physical distancing and self-quarantine are
taken to slow down the spread of the epidemic. Typically, there is a significant incubation
period during which individuals have been infected but are not yet infectious themselves.
During this period the individual is in compartment E (for exposed), the resulting models
are of SEIR or SEIRS type, respectively, depending on whether the acquired immunity
is permanent or otherwise. Also such models can show how different public health interventions may affect the outcome of the epidemic, and can also predict future growth
patterns.
Optimal control provides a perspective to study and understand the underlying transmission dynamics. The classical theory of optimal control was originally developed to
deal with systems of controlled ordinary differential equations [24, 11]. Computational
methods have been designed to solve related control problems [35, 16, 50]. There is a

wide application to various fields, including those for epidemic models, with major control measures on medicine (vaccination), see e.g., [28, 7], and for Cancer immunotherapy
control [13].
In this paper, we integrate the optimal control with a specific SEIR model, though
the developed methods can be readily adapted to other epidemic ODE models. More
precisely, we introduce a dynamic control model for monitoring the virus propagation.
Here the goal is to advance our understanding of virus propagation by learning the model
parameters so that the error between the reported cases and the solution to the SEIR
model is minimized. In short, we formulate the following optimization problem
min J =
θ

n−1
X

L(U (ti )) + g(U (T )),

i=1

s.t. U̇ = F (U, θ) t ∈ (0, T ],

U (0) = U0 ,

θ ∈ Θ.

Here U̇ = dtd U (t), θ is a time-varying vector of model parameters, Θ is the admissible set
for model parameters θ, and U = [S, E, I, R, D]> corresponds to the susceptible, exposed,
infected, recovered and deceased population. The loss function J is composed of two
parts: L measures the error between the candidate solution to the SEIR system and the
reported data at intermediate observation times, and g measures the error between the
candidate solution and the scheduled control data at the end time. This is in contrast to
the standard approach of fitting the model to the epidemic data through the non-linear
least squares approach [3, 20, 9].
1.1. Main contributions. In the present work we provide a fairly complete modeling
discussion on parameter learning, prediction and control of epidemics spread based on the
SEIR model. We begin with our discussion of basic properties of the SEIR model. Then
we show how the parameters can be updated recursively by gradient-based methods for
a short time period while parameters are near constants, where the loss gradient can be
obtained by using both state and co-state dynamics. For an extended time period with
reported data available at intermediate observation times, the parameters are typically
time-varying. In this general setting, we derive necessary conditions to achieve optimal
control in terms of the chosen objectives. The conditions are essentially the classical
Pontryagin maximum principal (PMP)[46]. The main differences are in the way we apply
the principle in each time interval, and connect them consistently by re-setting the co-state
V at the end of each time interval. We thus named it the generalized PMP. We further
present an algorithm to find the numerical solution to the generalized PMP in the spirit
of the method of successive approximations (MSA)[16]. Our algorithm is mainly fulfilled
by three parts: (1) discretization of the forward problem in such a way that solutions to U
remain positive for an arbitrarily step size h; (2) discretization of the co-state equation for
V is made unconditionally stable; (3) Minimiziation of the Hamiltonian is given explicitly
based on the structure of the SEIR model.
This data-driven optimal control approach can be applied to other epidemic models.
In particular, the prediction and control can be combined into one framework. To this
end, the cost includes terms measuring the error between confirmed cases (infection and
death) and those predicted from the model during the evolution, and terms measuring

OPTIMAL CONTROL ON COVID-19

the error between the scheduled numbers as desired and those predicted from the model
during the control period.
1.2. Further related work. In the mathematical study of SIR models, there is an
interplay between the dynamics of the disease and that of the total population, see
[4, 44, 22, 52]. We refer the reader to [41, 21] for references on SEIRS models with constant total population and to [38] for the proof of the global stability of a unique endemic
equilibrium of a SEIR model. Global stability of the endemic equilibrium for the SEIR
model with non-constant population is more subtle, see [37]. Apart from the compartmental models (and their stochastic counterparts [2]), a wide variety of methods exist for
modeling infectious disease. These include diffusion models [12], mean-field-type models
[33], cellular automata [56], agent-based models [27], network-based models [55, 30, 45],
and game-theoretical modelling [6, 48, 14]. Some focus on the aggregate behaviour of the
compartments of the population, whereas others focus on individual behaviour.
For COVID-19, a data-driven model has been proposed and simulated in [43], where
both the SIR model and the feed-forward network are trained jointly. Compared to this
work, our data-driven model is to consider the optimal control for SEIR with rigorous
derivation of optimality conditions and stable numerical approximations. On the other
hand, our data-driven optimal control algorithm may be interpreted as training a deep
neural network in which the SEIR model serves as the neural network with parameters to
be learned. This is in contrast to the study of residual neural networks using neural ODEs
(see e.g., [19, 15]) or section dynamics [40]. For other works on data-driven learning model
parameters using neural networks, see [5, 29]. SIR models with spatial effects have been
studied [8, 36]. A SIRT model was proposed in [8] to study the effects of the presence of
a road on the spatial propagation of the COVID-19. Introduced in [36] is a mean-field
game algorithm for a spatial SIR model in controlling propagation of epidemics.
Finally, we would like to mention that a variety of works have sought to endow neural
networks with physics-motivated equations, which can improve machine learning. To
incorporate the equations, parametric approaches have been studied [23, 17, 42, 47], where
certain terms in the equations are learned, while the equations still govern the dynamics
from input to output.
1.3. Organization. In Section 2, we motivate and present the SEIR system for modelling
the time evolution of epidemics, and integrate it with data into an optimal control system.
Both algorithms and related numerical approximations are detailed in Section 3. Section 4
provides experimental results to show the performance of our data-driven optimal control
algorithms. We end with concluding remarks in Section 5.
2. The SEIR model and optimal control
2.1. Model formulation. A population of size N (t) is partitioned into subclasses of
individuals who are susceptible, exposed (infected but not yet infectious), infectious, and
recovered, with sizes denoted by S(t), E(t), I(t), R(t), respectively. The sum E + I is the
total infected population.
The dynamical transfer of the population is governed by an ODE system
Ṡ = A − βSI/N − dS,

4

HAILIANG LIU AND XUPING TIAN

Ė = βSI/N − E − dE,
I˙ = E − µI − γI − dI,
Ṙ = γI − dR,
Ḋ = µI,

(2.1)

subject to initial conditions S0 , E0 , I0 , R0 , D0 . Here D(t) denotes deaths at time t, A
denotes the recruitment rate of the population due to birth and immigration. It is assumed
that all newborns are susceptible and vertical transmission can be neglected. d is the
natural death rate, µ is the rate for virus-related death. γ is the rate for recovery with
1/γ being the mean infectious period, and  is the rate at which the exposed individuals
become infectious with 1/ being the mean incubation period. The recovered individuals
are assumed to acquire permanent immunity (yet to be further confirmed for COVID-19);
there is no transfer from the R class back to the S class. β is the effective contact rate.
In the limit when  → ∞, the SEIR model becomes a SIR model. Note that the involved
parameters do not correspond to the actual per day recovery and mortality rates as the
new cases of recovered and deaths come from infected cases several days back in time.
However, one can attempt to provide some coarse estimations of the “effective/apparent”
values of these epidemiological parameters based on the reported confirmed cases.
2.2. Solution properties of the SEIR model. Classical disease transmission models
typically have at most one endemic equilibrium. If there is no endemic equilibrium,
diseases will disappear. Otherwise, the disease will be persistent irrespective of initial
positions. Large outbreaks tend to the persistence of an endemic state and small outbreaks
tend to the extinction of the diseases.
To understand solution properties of the SEIR system, we simply take A = bN with b
the natural birth rate, and focus on the following sub-system
Ṡ = bN − βSI/N − dS,
Ė = βSI/N − E − dE,
I˙ = E − µI − γI − dI,
Ṙ = γI − dR
with the total population size N = S + E + I + R. By adding the equations above we
obtain
Ṅ = (b − d)N − µI.
Let s = S/N, e = E/N, i = I/N, r = R/N denote the fractions of the classes S, E, I, R in
the population, respectively, then one can verify that
ṡ = b − bs − βis + µis,

(2.2a)

ė = βis − ( + b)e + µie,

(2.2b)

i̇ = e − (µ + γ + b)i + µi2 ,

(2.2c)

where r can be obtained from r = 1 − s − e − i or
ṙ = γi − br + µir.

From biological considerations, we study system (2.2) in a feasible region
Σ = {(s, e, i) ∈ R3+ , 0 ≤ s + e + i ≤ 1}.
It can be verified that Σ is positively invariant with respect to the underlying dynamic
system. We denote ∂Σ and Σ0 the boundary and the interior of Σ in R3 , respectively. A
special solution of form P 0 = (1, 0, 0) on the boundary of Σ is the disease-free equilibrium
of system (2.2) and it exists for all non-negative values of its parameters. Any equilibrium
in the interior Σ0 of Σ corresponds to the disease being endemic and is named an endemic
equilibrium. To identify the critical threshold for the parameters, we take ×(2.2b)+
( + b)×(2.2c) to obtain
d
[e + ( + b)i] = i [βs + µe + µ( + b)i − ( + b)(γ + µ + b)]
dt
≤ i [max{β, µ, µ( + b)} − ( + b)(γ + µ + b)] ≤ 0,
provided a key quantity σ ≤ 1, where
σ :=

β
( + b)(γ + µ + b)

is called the modified contact number [37]. The global stability of P 0 when σ ≤ 1 follows
from LaSalle’s invariance principle. The following theorem (see [37]), a standard type
in mathematical epidemiology, shows that the basic number σ determines the long-term
outcome of the epidemic outbreak.
Theorem 2.1. 1. If σ ≤ 1, then P 0 is the unique equilibrium and globally stable in Σ.
2. If σ > 1, then P 0 is unstable and the system is uniformly persistent in Σ0 .
By this theorem, the disease-free equilibrium P 0 is globally stable in Σ if and only
if σ ≤ 1. Its epidemiological implication is that the infected fraction of the population
vanishes in time so the disease dies out. In addition, the number σ serves as a sharp
threshold parameter; if σ > 1, the disease remains endemic.
In the epidemic literature, another threshold quantity is the basic reproduction number
β
R0 =
,
γ+µ
1
which is the product of the contact rate β and the average infectious period γ+µ
. It is a
parameter well known for quantifying the epidemic spread [18, 54]. On the other hand,
the contact number σ is defined at all times. In general, we have

R0 ≥ σ.
Note that for most models, σ = R0 , both quantities can be used interchangeably. This is
the case in our experiments when taking b = 0.
Remark 2.2. Extensive evidence shows that the disease spread rate is sensitive to at
least three factors: (1) daily interactions, (2) probability of infection, and (3) duration
of illness. The above assertion shows that making efforts to decrease R0 is essential for
controlling propagation of epidemics. Hence measures such as social distancing (selfquarantine, physical separation), washing hands and wearing face coverings, as well as
testing / timely-hospitalization can collectively decrease R0 .

Remark 2.3. The above model if further simplified will reduce to the SIR model or SIS
model, which is easier to analyze [25, 10, 53]. It can also be enriched by dividing into
different groups [34, 51], or by considering the spatial movement effects [26, 31]. In this
work, we use the SEIR model as a base for our analysis, prediction, and control.
2.3. A simple control. In compact form, the SEIR system may be written as
U̇ = F (U ; θ),

U (0) = U0 ,

where
U = [S, E, I, R, D]> ,

θ = [β, , γ, µ]>

are the column vectors of the state and parameters, respectively. Let g(·) be a loss
function (to be specified later) at the final time T , then the problem of determining the
model parameters based on this final cost can be cast as a dynamic control problem:
minθ {g(U (T )) subject to U̇ = F (U, θ),

0 < t ≤ T;

U (0) = U0 ;

θ ∈ Θ}.

Here the dependence of g on θ is through U (T ). The set of admissible parameters Θ may
be estimated from other sources.
For a short time period, the model parameters are near constant, then we can use
gradient-based methods to directly update θ, for which ∇θ g needs to be evaluated. We
define the Lagrangian functional
Z T
(U̇ − F (U, θ))> V dt,
L(θ) = g(U (T )) −
0

where V = V (t) is the Lagrangian multiplier depending on time and can be chosen freely,
and U depends on θ through the ODE. A formal calculation gives
∇θ g = ∇θ L

(∇θ U (t))> (∇U F )> V (t) + V̇ (t) + (∇θ F )> V (t)dt.

Thus ∇θ g can be determined in the following steps:
• Solve the forward problem for state U ,
U̇ (t) = F (U (t), θ),

U (0) = U0 .

• Solve the backward problem for co-state V ,
V̇ (t) = −(∇U F )> V (t),

V (T ) = ∇U g(U (T )).

• Evaluate the gradient of g by
Z
∇θ g =

T

(∇θ F )> V (t)dt.

0

In the context of the optimal control theory [46], such V exists and is called the co-state
function. We note that the (U, V ) dynamical system models the optimal strategies for
S, E, I, R populations.

Remark 2.4. It is remarkable that computing gradients of a scalar-valued loss with respect
to all parameters is done using only state and co-state functions without backpropagating
through the operations of the solver. In addition, modern ODE solvers may be used to
compute both U and V .
2.4. Data-driven optimal control. Now we consider an extended time period with
reported data available at intermediate observation times. The data are taken from the
reported cumulative infection and death cases.∗ In such general case the parameters are
typically time-varying, we need to derive a more refined data-driven optimal control.
Arranging the data in a vector Uc = [Ic , Dc ]> at times 0 = t0 < t1 < t2 < ... < tn = T , we
aim to
• find optimal parameter θ(t) for 0 ≤ t ≤ tn−1 such that the solution to the SEIR
system fits the reported data at the grid points {ti }n−1
i=1 as close as possible, and
• find desired parameter θ(t) for tn−1 ≤ t ≤ T that is able to control the epidemic
spreading at time T at desired values.
To achieve these goals, we first define a loss function by
J=

n−1
X

L(U (ti )) + g(U (T )),

i=1

where
L(U (ti )) = λ1 |I(ti ) − Ic (ti )|2 + λ2 |D(ti ) − Dc (ti )|2 ,
2

1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1,

(2.3)

2

g(U (T )) = λ1 |I(T ) − Id (T )| + λ2 |D(T ) − Dd (T )| .
Here λ1 , λ2 are user-defined normalization factors. This loss function is composed of two
parts: the running cost L which measures the error between the candidate solution (I, D)
to the SEIR system and the reported data (Ic , Dc ) at intermediate times; and the final
cost g, which measures the error between the candidate solution (I, D) and the desired
data (Id , Dd ) at the end time.
We then formulate the task as the following optimal control problem
min J =

n−1
X

L(U (ti )) + g(U (T )),

(2.4)

i=1

s.t. U̇ = F (U, θ) t ∈ (0, T ],

U (0) = U0 ,

θ ∈ Θ.

Motivated by the classical optimal control theory, we derive the necessary conditions for
the optimal solution to problem (2.4), stated in the following theorem.
Theorem 2.5. Let θ∗ be the optimal solution to problem (2.4) and U ∗ be the corresponding
state function, then there exists a piece-wise smooth function V ∗ and a Hamiltonian H
defined by
H(U, V, θ) = V > F (U, θ)
(2.5)
such that
U˙ ∗ = F (U ∗ , θ∗ ), t ∈ (0, T ], U ∗ (0) = U0 ,

The Pontryagin’s maximum principle states the necessary conditions for optimality: assume θ∗ and U ∗ are the optimal control function and corresponding state of the system,
then there exists a function V ∗ and a Hamiltonian H defined for all t ∈ [0, T ] by
H(U, V, θ) = V T F (U, θ) + L(U, θ)
such that
U˙ ∗ = ∇V H(U ∗ , V ∗ , θ∗ ), U ∗ (0) = U0 ,
V˙ ∗ = −∇U H(U ∗ , V ∗ , θ∗ ), V ∗ (T ) = ∇U g(U ∗ (T )),

are satisfied. Moreover, the Hamiltonian minimization condition
H(U ∗ , V ∗ , θ∗ ) ≤ H(U ∗ , V ∗ , a)

which is exactly (2.7). Correspondingly, the Hamiltonian (2.10) reduces to (2.5) for all


i=1 .
3. Numerical discretization and algorithms
In this section, we present implementation details to solve problem (2.4) via solving the
generalized PMP by iteration. We proceed in the following manner. First we make an
initial guess θ0 ∈ Θ. From the control function θl (t) in the l-th iteration for l = 0, 1, 2, · · · ,
we obtain θl+1 (t) in three steps:
Step 1: Solve the forward problem (2.6) to obtain Ul .
Step 2: Solve the sequence of backward problems (2.7) to obtain Vl .
Step 3: θl+1 = argminθ∈Θ H(Ul , Vl , θ, t) for each t ∈ [0, T ].
This is essentially the method of successive approximations (MSA) [16]. An important feature of MSA is that the Hamiltonian minimization step is decoupled for each t.
However, in general MSA tends to diverge, especially if the bad initial guess is taken [16].
Our goal is to adopt a careful discretization at each step to control possible divergent
behavior, instead of simply call an existing ODE solver for Steps 1-2, and an optimization
algorithm for Step 3.
Within each interval (ti−1 , ti ), we approximate both U and V at the same m points
with step size h = (ti − ti−1 )/m, so that the value of U required in Step 2 are already
calculated in Step 1. We use U i,k , V i,k , θi,k , where i = 1, ..., n and k = 0, ..., m to denote
solution values at k-th point in the i-th interval.
Note that population dynamics (births or deaths) may be neglected at a very crude
level on the grounds that epidemic dynamics often occur on a faster time scale than host
demography, or we can say heuristically that death of an infected individual and subsequent replacement by a susceptible (in the absence of vertical transmission) is equivalent
to a recovery event. Hence, in the numerical study, both b and d are taken to be zero.
Below we discuss the discretization of the three iteration steps for the case b = d = 0.
3.1. Forward discretization. We focus on the time interval (ti−1 , ti ). For notation
simplicity, we use U k , V k , θk to represent corresponding values at the k-th point. We
discretize the forward problem (2.6) by an explicit-implicit method with the Gauss-Seidel
type update:

of this update is its unconditional positivity-preserving property, i.e,
U k ≥ 0 ⇒ U k+1 > 0, k = 0, · · ·

VDk = VDk+1 ,

where k = m − 1, ..., 0, h = (ti − ti−1 )/m is the step size. For the starting value in each
interval, we have
V n,m = ∇U g(U (T )),

V i,m = V i+1,0 + ∇U L(U (ti )),

i = n − 1, · · · , 1.

Note that the above discretization is well-defined for any h > 0, hence unconditionally
stable since the system is linear in V .
3.3. Hamiltonian minimization. The Hamiltonian (2.5) is given by
H(U, V, θ) = −VS βSI/N + VE (βSI/N − E) + VI (E − (γ + µ)I) + VR γI + VD µI.
After plugging in U (t), V (t) that is obtained by solving the above forward and backward
problems with given θ(t), H may be seen as a functional only with respect to θ. We solve
it by the proximal point algorithm (PPA) [49], that is for any fixed time t ∈ (ti−1 , ti ),
i = 1, 2, ..., n,

θ(t)∈Θ
where l is the index for iteration, τ is the step size.
Remark 3.1. The use of PPA brings two benefits: (1) the objective function in (3.3) is a
convex function, which ensures the existence of the solution to the minimization problem;
(2) it is numerically stable: PPA has the advantage of being monotonically decreasing,
which is guaranteed for any step size τ > 0. In this way, the convergence of minimizing the
original loss in (2.4) with a regularization term is ensured, hence address the convergence
issue that MSA generally has [1].

The special form of H allows us to obtain a closed form solution:

(3.5)

µαl+1 = µαl + τ Ilα ((VI )αl − (VD )αl ).
Now taking the constraint θ ∈ Θ into consideration, we simply project the solution (3.5)
back into the feasible region after each iteration, that is
α
α
θl+1
= clip(θl+1
, Θ, Θ)

where Θ, Θ are element-wise lower bound and upper bound of Θ, respectively. That
guarantees the output is constrained to be in Θ.
Remark 3.2. The step size for each parameter may be set differently according to their
magnitude scale, and this can indeed improve the training performance, as observed in
our experiments.
3.4. Algorithms. The above computing process is wrapped up in Algorithm 1. Since
we can update {θi,k } simultaneously, we consider {θi,k } as a vector and still denote it as
θ for notation simplicity. We use k · k to stand for the L2 norm.

6:

8:
for k = m − 1 to 0 do
9:
V i,k ← V i,k+1 (solve the backward problem, refer to (3.2))
10:

11:
θl+1 ← θl (solve the minimization problem, refer to (3.5))
12:
θl+1 ← clip(θl+1 , Θ, Θ) (ensure θ ∈ Θ)
13: return θ, U
This data-driven optimal control algorithm provides an optimal fitting to both the
data and the SEIR model, it can help to reduce the uncertainty in conventional model
predictions with standard data fitting.
Initialization: We now discuss how to initialize the control function θ. A simple choice
is to take θ0i,k to be a constant vector for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n, 1 ≤ k ≤ m, where the value of each
component relies on a priori epidemiological and clinical information about the relative
parameter magnitude. They vary with the area from where the data were sampled.

OPTIMAL CONTROL ON COVID-19

We can also use the data {Dc (ti )}ni=0 , {Ic (ti )}ni=0 to obtain a better initial guess for µ.
More precisely, from (2.1), i.e., µ = Ḋ/I we take
Dc (ti+1 ) − Dc (ti )
µi,k
∀k = 0, 1, ..., m.
0 =
(ti+1 − ti )Ic (ti+1 )
The initial data for the forward problem is set as
U0 = [N (0) − Ic (0), 0, Ic (0), 0, Dc (0)]> ,
where N (0) is the initial population of the area analyzed, Ic (0), Dc (0) are the confirmed
infections and deaths on the day of the first confirmed cases, respectively.
The initial condition of the backward problem is given in (2.7). In the present setup,
the loss function g only depends on I and D, hence the initial condition is given by
V n,m = [0, 0, ∂I g(U (T )), 0, ∂D g(U (T ))]> .
Finally, we should point out that Algorithm 1 with a rough initial guess θ0 can be
rather inefficient when T is large. In such case, we divide the whole interval as 0 = tn0 <
n−1
tn1 < ... < tns < tns+1 = T with tnj ∈ {ti }i=1
for 1 ≤ j ≤ s and apply Algorithm 1 to
each subinterval consecutively. This treatment is summarized in Algorithm 2.
Algorithm 2
Require: {Uc (ti )}ni=1 , U0 : initial data, τ : step size for the minimization problem.
Require: {tnj }s+1
j=0 , θ0 : initial guess of θ on [tn0 , tn1 ]
1: for j = 0 to s do
nj+1
2:
θ, U = Algorithm 1({Uc (ti )}i=n
, [tnj , tnj+1 ], U0 , θ0 , τ )
j +1
3:
θ0 , U0 ← θ(tnj+1 ), U (tnj+1 )
4:
return θ, U
Remark 3.3. If parameters vary dramatically, θ(tnj ) may not be a good initialization for
θ on [tnj , tnj+1 ]. When this happens we switch to the rough initial guess and test by trial
and error.
4. Experiments
We now present experimental results to demonstrate the good performance of our algorithms.† In all the experiments, the normalization factors λ1 , λ2 in (2.3) are chosen
such that the loss with respect to the infection cases is at the same scale as the loss with
respect to the death cases. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) in the US, the median incubation period is 4-5 days from exposure to symptoms
onset, persons with mild to moderate COVID-19 remain infectious no longer than 10 days
after symptom onset, therefore, we set
Θ = {θ | 0 ≤ β ≤ 5, 0.2 ≤  ≤ 0.25, 0.1 ≤ γ ≤ 0.2, 0 ≤ µ ≤ 0.01}.
For the step size, considering that β,  and γ are almost at the same scale, which is 100
times greater than µ, and the permissible range of β is much large than  and γ, we set
τ = τγ = τ , τβ = 100τ and τµ = τ /100.

4.1. Covid-19 epidemic in the US. As of today [November 17, 2020], it has been
about 300 days since the first infection case of COVID-19 was reported in the US. We thus
consider the time period [0, 300] and sample the data [Ic , Dc ] at ti = 2i for 0 < i ≤ 150.
To apply Algorithm 2 we take {tnj }s+1
j=0 as {0, 30, 60, 90, 150, 210, 270, 300}.
Data fitting via optimal control with SEIR model. Figure 1 (a) shows that our
data-driven optimal control algorithm learns the data very well. In Figure 1 (b), there
is a noticeable peak over the second month, where the value of reproduction number R0
is very large due to a dramatic increase in infection rate β. After that, R0 goes down to
a lower range, with a slight rise around the 6-th month. Over the last two months we
observed another increase in R0 . Overall, the value of R0 stays above 1 and the pattern
of R0 is consistent with the increasing trend of the confirmed cases. For a short time
period, one may expect the transmission to continue the same way, then the learned
model parameters could be used for prediction over a short coming period.
Scheduled control. From the above prediction result, we see that without interventions, the amount of confirmed and death cases will increase rapidly. We would like to
see a slow down of the epidemic spreading as the outcome of various public health interventions. With the present approach, this can be formulated as a scheduled control.
Specifically, with a desired level of infection and death cases at the final time T , we schedule a sequence of values at intermediate times, from which we apply our algorithm to
learn the optimal parameters (control function) such that the state function reaches the
desired value at T along the scheduled path.

OPTIMAL CONTROL ON COVID-19

Figure 2. Scheduled control for the US in 270 − 300 days by SEIR model
For instance, starting from the 270-th day, with the goal of controlling the cumulative
number of infection and death cases at 9, 746, 063 and 234, 390 on the 300-th day, respectively, we set a pair of values for each day in the 30 days as shown in Figure 2 (a), then
learn the parameters from the scheduled data. The results are presented in 2 (b). Figure
2 (a) shows that the goal can be achieved by setting the parameters as what have been
learned.
To compare the situations with or without a scheduled control, we also present the
reported data and corresponding training results in Figure 2. In fact, the scheduled
intermediate values are obtained by assuming the daily increases were half of the reported
daily increases. From Figure 2 (b), we see that the most significant difference occurs in
β. This can be roughly interpreted as: if the contact rate β could be reduced by 0.02, the
number of confirmed cases over the last 30 days could have been reduced by 50%, though
the corresponding R0 is still greater than 1. For virus propagation to eventually stop, R0
needs to be less than 1, for which β must be less than γ + µ.
4.2. Experimental results for other countries. The coronavirus pandemic continues
to affect every region of the world, but some countries are experiencing higher rates of
infection, while others appear to have mostly controlled the virus. In order to see the
virus dynamics in other regions, we also provide results for some other selected countries
such as the UK, France and China. For the UK, {tnj }s+1
j=0 are taken as {0, 30, 90, 120,
s+1
150, 180, 210, 240, 300}. For France, {tnj }j=0 are taken as {0, 30, 60, 90, 180, 300}. For
China, {tnj }s+1
j=0 are taken as {0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210, 240, 270, 300}.
From Figure 3 and 4, we see that the confirmed cases in UK and France display similar
patterns. Figure 5 shows that China was hit hard early on, but the number of new cases
has largely been under control for months.

5. Discussion
In this paper, we introduced a data-driven optimal control model for learning the timevarying parameters of the SEIR model, which reveals the virus spreading process among
several population groups. Here the state variables represent the population status, such
as S, E, I, R, D while the control variables are rate parameters of transmission between
population groups. The running cost is of discrete form fitting the reported data of infection and death cases at the observation times. The terminal cost can be used to quantify
the desired level of the total infection and death cases at scheduled times. Numerical algorithms are derived to solve the proposed model efficiently. Experimental results show that
our approach can effectively fit, predict and control the infected and deceased populations.
The data-driven modeling approach presented in this work is applicable to more advanced models such as with spatial movement effects, interaction of different class of
populations, for which we need to formulate mean-field game type models over a spatial
domain, see [36] for the mean-field game formulation of a epidemic control problem. On
the computational side, our approach involves a non-convex optimization problem, which
comes from the multiplicative terms of the SEIR model itself. In future work, we intend
to extend our algorithm to more advanced models.
