At least as important as measuring the impact of COVID-19
on internet performance is using indirect metrics, such as data
usage, to estimate the success of social distancing measures,
while maintaining user privacy. We draw on two metrics to
explore whether we can detect the daytime and evening usage
of residential internet users, indicating work from home or
distance learning, as well as observance of stay-at-home orders
on weekends.

Abstract—The COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions
forced many to work, learn, and socialize from home over the internet. There appears to be consensus that internet infrastructure
in the developed world handled the resulting traffic surge well. In
this paper, we study network measurement data collected by the
Federal Communications Commission’s Measuring Broadband
America program before and during the pandemic in the United
States (US). We analyze the data to understand the impact of
lockdown orders on the performance of fixed broadband internet
infrastructure across the US, and also attempt to correlate
internet usage patterns with the changing behavior of users
during lockdown. We found the key metrics such as change in
data usage to be generally consistent with the literature. Through
additional analysis, we found differences between metro and rural
areas, changes in weekday, weekend, and hourly internet usage
patterns, and indications of network congestion for some users.

A. Average Monthly Downloads
A high-level overview of the effect of COVID-19 on fixed
broadband internet usage can be seen by analyzing the average
monthly downloaded data per test unit. As shown in Fig. 1,
we notice a sizable increase in overall downloaded data in
the months of March, April, and May 2020. This increase is
consistent across both metro and rural counties, although it is
more pronounced in metro areas. The three pandemic months
are the highest-usage months for metro areas. In contrast, rural
areas only have one month larger than their pre-pandemic
maximum of December 2019.
Interestingly, in the fourth month of the pandemic, we notice
a drop in overall downloaded data in metro areas, while rural
areas remain constant. This drop coincides with the relaxation
of many stay-at-home orders, indoor dining bans, and curfews
in cities across the US [32], [33].
B. Average Daily Downloads
Focusing on daily fixed broadband internet usage can allow
us to understand the public’s reactions to various events. In
particular, by analyzing daily averages over the course of March,
we can better understand the reactions to the various stay-athome orders, school shutdowns, and curfews from an internet
usage point-of-view.

VI. Hourly Data Usage Patterns
Hourly data usage patterns (upload and download) could
potentially provide insights into the behavior of fixed broadband
internet users before and during the pandemic. Some applications such as music and video streaming generally increase the
volume of downloaded data. Other applications such as VoIP,
video conferencing, or networked games influence the volume
of uploaded data.
In this section, we study the average hourly data usage per
test unit from multiple perspectives and attempt to correlate the
observations with changing user behavior patterns during the
lockdown. We contrast weekday and weekend patterns, analyze
the differences in uploaded and downloaded traffic volumes,
and compare with the data from the corresponding period of
2019 to eliminate potential seasonal differences.
The analysis in this section is primarily based on the
datausage table from the FCC MBA raw dataset. That table
keeps track of the total number of bytes received and transmitted
by all user’s devices within each hour of the day. For hourly
analysis, we needed to translate UTC timestamps to the test
unit’s local time using the unit profile dataset, as described
in Section IV. All graphs in this section were generated with
measurements from approximately 3,000 test units.

We conclude that people use fixed broadband internet more
and download more data because of COVID-19 and its related
policies (e.g., lockdown, quarantine, work from home).

download speed per test unit between January and March of 2020.

Fig. 6. Cumulative distribution function (CDF) showing the ratio of average
upload speed per test unit between January and March of 2020.

[6], an obvious question to ask if this increase led to changes in
perceived network performance, e.g., due to increased network
congestion. Knowing that the average volume of data per
test unit increased significantly, one would expect the average
internet upload or download speed to also change.

e.g., work from home, remote learning, and video conferences,
an increase in uploaded data volumes was expected (as Fig. 6
shows) and, consequently, a decrease in the average upload
speed. Similarly to the situation observed with the download
speed, while 70% of test units experienced a decrease in their
upload speed, this decrease was also modest, mostly less of
5%.
One potential limitation of the analysis is that test units may
get upgraded to higher ISP service tiers in the middle of the
analyzed time period. In that case, the performance of the
broadband connection increases and, consequently, download
and upload volumes may also increase.

A. Average Download Speed
In order to understand how the COVID-19 outbreak impacted
the average download speed experienced by fixed broadband
internet users, we calculate the ratio between the average
download speed that users experienced between January and
March 2020. Let 𝑆D be the download speed, we compute the
average download speed ratio as follows:
𝑆D % =

𝑆 D, Mar − 𝑆 D, Jan

VIII. Packet Loss Analysis

𝑆 D, Jan
Fig. 5 shows the result in the form of a cumulative
distribution function (CDF). We see that approximately 60% of
the test units experienced a decrease in their average download
speed from January to March 2020. However, the decrease was
not too significant, since for most of the test units, the decrease
was smaller than 5%. Therefore, while a significant number of
test units experienced a decrease in average download speed as
other studies suggest, not many experienced a severe decrease.
Cooper [41] argued that although some ISPs were able to
keep up with the increase in internet consumption, some cities
felt the impact of the increase in data consumption leading
users to experience a decrease in their download speed, e.g.,
the download speed in New York City decreased by 24% in
March.
B. Average Upload Speed
Similarly, we calculate the average upload speed ratio from
January to March 2020. Let 𝑆U be the upload speed, we can
calculate the average upload speed as follows:
𝑆U % =

𝑆 U, Mar − 𝑆 U, Jan

× 100

𝑆 U, Jan
Fig. 6 shows the result. Approximately 70% of test units saw
their average upload speed decreasing from January to March
2020. As people transitioned most of their activities online,

Apart from studying data usage and connection speed
patterns, we can also examine the effects of COVID-19
restrictions on packet loss. With increasing fixed broadband
internet usage during the lockdown period, network congestion
is also likely to increase. Increasing network congestion will
manifest itself in increasing packet loss.
Each test unit performs a UDP latency measurement periodically throughout the day. During the measurement, the
test unit sends a series of UDP datagrams to a pre-defined
set of servers. Parameters such as minimum, maximum, and
average round trip time are recorded, as well as the number
of lost UDP packets. The UDP test is only performed when
there is no user activity on the connection. Thus, the results are
primarily influenced by the performance of the fixed broadband
connection rather than local user traffic.
We use number the total number of sent and lost UDP
datagrams to calculate packet loss rate. To quantify the packet
loss rate for one test unit, we define the metric as:
𝐿% =

𝐹
× 100
𝐹+𝑆

(5)

where 𝐿 % is the packet loss rate, 𝐹 is the number of failed
tests, and 𝑆 is the number of successful tests obtained from
the MBA udplatency dataset.
Previous studies [19] suggested that the majority of the US
did not experience any degradation of network performance.
We thus focus on the subset of the test units that did experience

network degradation and study packet loss at the 95th percentile,
i.e., the 5% of the users with the worst loss ratios.
A. Daily Packet Loss
Fig. 7 shows the daily packet loss rate at the 95th percentile,
i.e., the 5% of the most “lossy” users, over January and March
2019 and 2020. We see a significant increase in packet loss
starting from mid-March 2020. Mid-March is the period when
some US states began imposing statewide lockdown orders.
In this time period, the packet loss rate grows by 40–50%
compared to early March 2020, which is before the pandemic.
Towards the end of March 2020, the packet loss rate was
80% higher than that before the pandemic, implying that some
network congestion occurred.
Since we do not observe similar trends in 2019, this suggests
that this increase is not due to noise and might be instead due
to the additional traffic generated by activities such as work
from home, distance learning, and video conferencing. This
increase also coincides with the increase in downloaded data
we observed in metro areas in Fig. 1.
B. Hourly Packet Loss
In this section, we examine the influence of the hour of the
day on packet loss. Fig. 8 depicts the 95th percentile of packet
loss over the course of a day in January, March 2019 and 2020.
We found the packet loss ratio changing over the course of the
day, with the maximum around 20:00. This is consistent with
data upload and download patterns discussed earlier.
In March 2020, the packet loss rate increased steeply during
daytime from 7:00 to 22:00, potentially due to the users’
growing online activities like remote learning or work from
home. However, this change was more evident during the
evening. For example, we saw about 59% growth from 18:00
to 22:00 when comparing March to January 2020. This time
period lies outside of traditional working hours, suggesting that
packet loss is most likely due to the increased traffic generated
by recreational activities, rather than remote work or distance
learning.
Our results are consistent with Candela et al. [42], as they
found the increase of packet loss might be affected by factors
like the type of server, Internet Protocol (IP) version, and the
time of the day.

IX. Discussion
Because we were working with large datasets, 300 GB of
data in total from January 2019 to June 2020, one of the main
challenges that we faced was to find an application that would
be able to process all this data. We decided to use Google
Cloud BigQuery and process all the data in Google Cloud
VMs. However, even in this configuration, some of the queries
that analyzed the data over long time intervals took up to ten
minutes to complete.
One of the biggest limitations in our analysis were outdated
unit profile and unit census datasets. These datasets are
published by the FCC as part of the MBA raw data. While the
raw MBA datasets are published regularly, unit profile and unit
census datasets are only updated when a new annual report is
published. This is understandable since some of the information
in those datasets need to be manually cross-validated. At the
time of writing, the 9th FCC MBA report was the most recent
report. That report covered September-October 2018, hence
our most recent unit profile and unit census datasets were from
2018. Having more recent unit profile and unit census datasets
would have allowed us to perform more accurate demographic
and geography analysis.
For the purpose of assessing users’ behavior from network
traffic patterns, we were limited by the fact that the FCC MBA
datasets do not provide application or service level information
about the traffic. Thus, we were not able to examine the relative
contribution of various types of applications (VoIP, YouTube,
video conferencing) to traffic patterns. Others have examined
such data in the context of COVID-19 related lockdowns, e.g.,
the authors in [2].
When used in isolation, the FCC MBA dataset provides only
a limited insight into how households deal with short-term
and long-term crises, e.g., natural disasters or epidemics. The
reasons include: 1) the lack of application-layer detail, i.e., what
network applications are being used and when; 2) sampling
bias; and 3) inability to correlate fixed broadband measurement
data with similar measurements from other related vantage
points, e.g., ISPs, network operators, or mobile networks.
For the purpose of emergency response and planning, it might
be beneficial to include a mechanism in the FCC MBA dataset
to track application usage in a privacy-respecting manner. For
example, the test unit could classify uploaded and downloaded
