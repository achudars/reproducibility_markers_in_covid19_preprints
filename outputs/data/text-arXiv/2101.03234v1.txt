Abstract
According to the World Health Organization, development of the COVID-19 vaccine is occurring
in record time. Administration of the vaccine has started the same year as the declaration of the
COVID-19 pandemic. The United Nations emphasized the importance of providing COVID-19
vaccines as “a global public good”, which is accessible and affordable world-wide. Pricing the
COVID-19 vaccines is a controversial topic. We use optimization and game theoretic approaches to
model the COVID-19 U.S. vaccine market as a duopoly with two manufacturers Pfizer-BioNTech
and Moderna. The results suggest that even in the context of very high production and distribution
costs, the government can negotiate prices with the manufacturers to keep public sector prices
as low as possible while meeting demand and ensuring each manufacturer earns a target profit.
Furthermore, these prices are consistent with those currently predicted in the media.

Introduction

The first case of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) was recognized in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and was then announced as pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on
March 11th, 2020 (United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2020a). This pandemic has become one of the world’s main public health challenges due to both transmission speed
and scale, and the fact that certain segments of the population are at increased risk of severe illness
and death (Santos 2020). As of early December 2020, there have been more than 66M confirmed
cases and 1.5M deaths worldwide due to COVID-19 (World Health Organization 2020).
Vaccine development is a complicated process normally requiring years of research and development. There are several ongoing efforts around the world to discover a vaccine that mitigates
COVID-19 transmission. New-generation vaccines including messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines
are highly effective and have potential for fast development, low cost manufacturing and safe administration. Thus, these vaccines can serve as an assuring substitute for conventional vaccines
(Pardi et al. 2018). As of Dec. 5, 2020, the Coronavirus Vaccine Tracker by New York Times

(New York Times 2020) reports that there are 58 COVID-19 vaccines in clinical trials on humans,
of which there are two leading manufacturers in the U.S. in Phase 3 of developing mRNA vaccines:
Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna. The collaboration between Pfizer and the German company BioNTech reports their vaccine to be 95% effective in preventing COVID-19 (Pfizer Inc. 2020b), and
their vaccine was approved for emergency use in the U.K. on December 2, 2020 (Thomas 2020).
(Throughout this work, we refer to the Pfizer-BioNTech collaboration as simply “Pfizer”). In partnership with National Institute of Health (NIH), Moderna began vaccine development in January
2020; on Nov. 16, 2020, Moderna announced its vaccine is 94.5 percent effective, joining Pfizer
on the frontier of the worldwide endeavor to develop a COVID-19 vaccine (Grady 2020).
On July 22, 2020, Pfizer announced an agreement with the U.S. government for an initial order of
100 million doses of its mRNA vaccine for $1.95 billion with a possibility of acquiring up to 500
million additional doses (Businesswire 2020b). On August 11, 2020, Moderna, Inc., announced
that the U.S. government committed up to $2.48 billion for early access to 100 million doses
of Moderna’s mRNA vaccine, with the option to purchase up to 400 million additional doses
(Businesswire 2020a). According to an article published on Nov. 17, 2020, Pfizer has set the
initial price at $19.50 a dose ($39 per patient), and Moderna has set its vaccine price to $25 per
dose ($50 per patient) (Jennings 2020). Schwartz et al. 2020 report the price of the Moderna
vaccine as $30 for the two-dose regimen.
Distribution of the mRNA vaccines is a serious challenge due to the need for ultra-cold storage.
The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines require different storage temperatures: −70 degrees Celsius for
Pfizer and −20 degrees Celsius for Moderna (Simmons-Duffin 2020). Moderna’s vaccine can be
stored in a regular freezer, making its distribution less costly. Pfizer has provided several ultra cold
freezers to store and distribute their own vaccine (Bouffard 2020).
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is the primary public health organization
in the U.S. charged with the responsibility of development and fulfillment of vaccines and ensuring
adequate societal immunization coverage levels. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services
released a comprehensive plan to ensure all Americans have access to the COVID-19 vaccine at no
cost once available (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services 2020). According to Schwartz et
al. 2020, the COVID-19 vaccine should be free to everyone in the U.S. under the CDC’s COVID19 Vaccination Program (United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2020b). The
CDC discusses vaccine coverage under five program types: Medicare, Vaccine for Children (VFC),
Medicaid, Section 317 (Vaccines for uninsured adults), the Veterans Administration, and private
insurance. We characterize the U.S. COVID-19 vaccine as a two-sector market, similar to other
vaccine markets. The private sector includes the vaccines that are purchased by private insurers,
and the public sector includes all other governmental programs. Typically public sector vaccine
costs are lower.
Several studies in the operations research literature use theoretical and empirical approaches to
analyze multiple aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic. These aspects include modeling the spread
of the disease (Ivorra et al. 2020), ICU capacity management (Alban et al. 2020), importance of
wearing high quality masks (Rosenstrom et al. 2020), ventilator inventory management (Mehrotra et al. 2020), the impact of COVID-19 on global supply chain performance and food supply
chain (Ivanov 2020 and Singh et al. 2020), and plasma donations during the COVID-19 pandemic
(Nagurney and Dutta 2020), among others. To the best of our knowledge, there are no theoretical
2

or empirical studies on COVID-19 vaccine pricing. This study fills this gap.
Previous work by Cummings, Behzad, and Martonosi 2020 models the negotiation of public sector
pediatric vaccine prices by the CDC in the context of a duopoly. The authors develop an optimization model for minimizing public sector expenditures while ensuring adequate public sector
vaccine supply and adequate profit margins for each manufacturer (preventing a monopoly). They
treat the private sector market as an exogenous duopoly price competition operating under the
surplus conditions of a Bertrand-Edgeworth-Chamberlin (BEC) equilibrium, as derived in Behzad
and Jacobson 2016.
This paper considers the U.S. COVID-19 vaccine market as a duopoly between Pfizer and Moderna. We adapt the model of Cummings, Behzad, and Martonosi 2020 to determine prices for
the U.S. public sector COVID-19 vaccines. The analysis suggests that even in the context of high
production and distribution costs, the U.S. government can negotiate prices with the manufacturers
that keep public sector prices as low as possible while meeting demand and ensuring each manufacturer earns a target profit. Moreover, these prices are consistent with those currently predicted
in the media. Prices are likely to decrease over time as the cold chain becomes more efficient.
Finally, the model presented here can be adapted to the context of an oligopoly when new vaccines
enter the market.
Section 2 presents our adaptation of the model to the COVID-19 vaccine scenario. In Section 3
we justify the parameter values used for our empirical tests. Section 4 presents the analysis and
discussion. Section 5 concludes.

Model

We use the same notation and largely the same model as in Cummings, Behzad, and Martonosi
2020. The sets, variables and parameters used in the optimization model can be found in Table 1.
The full optimization model is given in Figure 1, which we describe now.
We consider two manufacturers (i ∈ M ) of competing and differentiated vaccines. The manufacturers sell these vaccines in two sectors, s ∈ S = {pub, priv}. When selling in the private
sector the prices, ppriv
i , are determined in a Bertrand-Edgeworth-Chamberlin (BEC) duopoly game
presented in Behzad and Jacobson 2016. We also assume a surplus regime, in which each manufacturer’s production capacity, Ki , for the new vaccine is sufficiently large that each can maximize
private-sector profits unconstrained by capacity.
Within the public sector, the CDC negotiates quantities, qipub , and prices, ppub
i , with each manufacturer to minimize the total government cost while ensuring public sector demand can be fully met.
To reflect the fact that competing vaccines tend to have similar prices, the CDC chooses among
cost-minimizing solutions those which also minimize the absolute public sector price difference
pub
between the two manufacturers, z = |ppub
1 − p2 |, yielding the weighted objective function in
Equation (1).
The negotiated prices and quantities are constrained by the following considerations:
• Public sector demand must be met (Eq. 2). We introduce parameter rs , which is the percent-

Cummings, Behzad, and Martonosi 2020 include a parameter ρ representing a legislative limit

• Prices and quantities follow linear demand curves in each sector (Eq. 3).
• Each manufacturer i ∈ M must achieve a target profit Pi (Eq. 4). As a novel departure from
the model of Cummings, Behzad, and Martonosi 2020, we introduce per-unit production and
distribution costs di , reflecting the significant expense of the cold chain required to distribute
mRNA vaccines.
• Each manufacturer’s total quantity sold cannot exceed their total capacity (Eq. 5).
• Each manufacturer’s residual private sector capacity is determined by public sector quantities
and must exceed the bound U governing the BEC game’s surplus equilibrium regime (Eq.
6).
• The absolute price difference, z, between the two manufacturers is expressed as linear inequality bounds that the objective function drives to tighten (Eq. 7).

Note that Pfizer and Moderna are both anticipated to produce vaccines requiring a two-dose regimen. We assume all individuals will receive both doses, so we interpret quantities, unit prices, and
unit costs in terms of individuals served in two-dose increments.

Parameter Estimation

Here, we discuss estimates and sensitivity analysis ranges for the model parameters describing the
Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, summarized in the last column of Table 1.

3.1

Demand Curve Parameters

We estimate the linear demand curve parameters apub , apriv , b, and c in the same manner as Cummings, Behzad, and Martonosi 2020. This method uses publicly available demand and price data
to determine the average public and private sector intercepts, apub and apriv . Historical demand and
price data are not yet available for the COVID-19 vaccine, so we use data available for the influenza (flu) vaccine as a proxy. The flu vaccine is the most widely distributed vaccine in the U.S.,
with approximately 175 million U.S. individuals receiving the vaccine in the 2019-20 contract year
(United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2020c). This is the same order of magnitude as the number of U.S. individuals who could receive the COVID-19 vaccine during its first
year of production. In the U.S. flu vaccine market two primary manufacturers market vaccines to
people older than six months of age: Sanofi Pasteur (Fluzone®Quadrivalent) and GlaxoSmithKline (Fluarix®Quadrivalent). Table 2 summarizes public and private sector prices for these two
vaccines.
The new COVID-19 vaccines will require two doses per person, as compared to the flu vaccine’s
single dose per person. Additionally, the COVID-19 vaccines are expected to have much higher
distribution costs relative to the flu vaccine. Thus to estimate as in each sector, we use the reported
number of administered doses of flu vaccine from the years 2010-11 through 2019-20 to reflect
the number of individuals who will seek the COVID-19 vaccine. We double the prices given in
Table 2 to reflect the cost of a two-dose regimen, and we add the estimated two-dose production
and distribution costs di that will naturally raise prices. Because two-dose quantities in each sector
by each manufacturer are likely to be on the order of tens of millions, and prices are likely to be on
the order of tens, we set k = 6. Incorporating these modifications into the approach of Cummings,
Behzad, and Martonosi 2020, we obtain the following expression for the estimated linear demand
curve intercept:

manufacturer if the vaccine had zero cost.

We use the 2019-20 total flu vaccine demand of 174.5M as the baseline two-dose demand, D,
considered by our model, and consider values 10% below and above that baseline.

3.2

Production Parameters

The two COVID-19 vaccines are still in development at the time of this writing, so we rely on
information contained in press releases and other media to estimate production-specific parameters.
3.2.1

Total Production Capacity, Ki .

As stated in Section 1, Pfizer and Moderna have the ability to produce up to 500 million and 400
million doses, respectively, for the U.S. market in 2021. We use KP f = 250M and KM od = 200M
as the capacity measured in two-dose regimens. Moreover, Pfizer and Moderna have been rapidly
ramping up their supply chains, and it is expected that both manufacturers will have considerably
more capacity than this in 2021, permitting us to safely assume the surplus regime of the BEC
equilibrium. For instance, Pfizer plans to produce 1.3B doses in 2021 for global use (Bouffard
2020).

7

3.2.2

Minimum Profit Threshold, Pi .

Articles in the media question whether Pfizer and Moderna are trying to attain a profit with the new
COVID-19 vaccine (Radcliffe 2020; Nguyen 2020). The U.S. government has an incentive for the
two manufacturers to make a profit on this vaccine, as this stabilizes the market and also ensures
that pharmaceutical companies will be inclined to once again rapidly develop a vaccine if there is
another global pandemic in the future.
We develop three estimates for each manufacturer’s target profit. First, we divide each company’s
reported annual research and development (R&D) budget by its reported number of products as an
estimate of the average profit it hopes to recuperate from sales of the new vaccine. Pfizer reports
an annual R&D budget of $8.65B and 337 total pharmaceutical products, corresponding to a target
profit of $25.7M (Pfizer Inc. 2019; Pfizer Inc. 2020a). However, many of these products are overthe-counter products or generic labels for other products they carry. If we instead consider only
the 37 products Pfizer lists as its primary products (Pfizer Inc. 2020c), we obtain a target profit of
$234M. Moderna reports an annual R&D budget of $496.3M and 12 pharmaceutical products that
have reached the clinical studies phase (none are yet approved), corresponding to a target profit
of $41.4M (Wall Street Journal 2019; Moderna Inc. 2020). Because Moderna has not yet brought
a product to market, its COVID-19 vaccine could reasonably be expected to recuperate the entire
$496.3M annual R&D budget from the previous year, so we use this value as a second estimate of
Moderna’s target profit. Finally, we can use prior year revenue estimates using the flu vaccine data
reported in Table 2 to obtain a third estimate of the companies’ target profit, following Cummings,
Behzad, and Martonosi 2020[S.M. Eq. 7]. In this way, we estimate a target profit of $2.57B for
each manufacturer.
3.2.3

Two-Dose Production and Distribution Cost, di .

Per-unit costs associated with the production and distribution of either manufacturer are not widely
known. We use estimates of per-dose investment costs for the flu vaccine provided by the World
Health Organization (Friede et al. 2011)[Fig. 2]. In their figure, they report a mean per-dose cost of
$3.30 averaged over ten manufacturers and weighted by the quantities each produces. We can also
calculate an unweighted average of $15.98 per dose, and an unweighted trimmed mean (discarding
the smallest and largest reported investment costs) of $11.72. We again double these estimates,
reflecting a two-dose regimen of the COVID-19 vaccine, to attain estimates for di of $0, $6.60,
$23.44, and $31.96.
3.2.4

Other Parameters.

The remaining parameters are the product similarity, γ, the public sector demand percentage, rpub ,
and the objective function weight, µ. The degree of similarity between the two vaccine products
depends on factors such as the mode of delivery and adverse effects. In the absence of specific
information about the vaccines, we test γ = [0.25, 0.5, 0.75]. We assume that the public sector
represents rpub = 57% of the total U.S. vaccine market (Orenstein et al. 2005). Lastly, with
quantities scaled to millions, µ = 0.9 effectively identifies, among cost-minimizing solutions, a
solution for which the difference in public sector prices is minimal.

Analysis and Discussion

We tested the 1,296 combinations of model parameters specified in Table 1 using the BARON
solver on the NEOS server (Tawarmalani and Sahinidis 2005; Czyzyk, Mesnier, and Moré 1998;
Dolan 2001; Gropp and Moré 1997). The model is infeasible whenever both manufacturers have
the highest target profit of $2.57B, regardless of other parameters. The vast majority of remaining
infeasible cases occur when one manufacturer’s target profit is at this highest value. The high
prices required to support such a high target profit erode demand to the point of failing to meet
public sector demand. Of the 554 feasible scenarios, 214 yield public sector prices and quantities
that are nonzero for both manufacturers, reflecting the current expectation that both manufacturers
will participate in the public sector market. We discuss these 214 scenarios.

4.1

Prices

Figure 2 plots pairs of public sector prices of Moderna and Pfizer determined by the model for each
of the 214 scenarios, with shading determined by the total demand used in the scenario.
First, we notice that the prices output by the model are reasonable and consistent with projections
given in the news. The overall centroid of the data points in Figure 2 is located at a price of $34.39
for Pfizer and $35.09 for Moderna for a two-dose regimen.
Second, we detect three general bands of points, corresponding to the three values of total demand.
When total demand is projected to be low (157.05M two-dose regimens, in black), optimized prices
are generally higher than when total demand is projected to be high (191.95M two-dose regimens,
in light grey).
Lastly, we notice a general inverse relationship in the prices of the two manufacturers: higher
prices for Pfizer are generally coupled with lower prices for Moderna, and vice versa. Extreme
prices higher than $75 per two-dose regimen occur when, e.g., both manufacturers have moderately
high or high production costs and product similarity is low, meaning that the manufacturers have
effectively segmented the market to their advantage.
Figure 3 plots the public sector price distribution of each manufacturer by that manufacturer’s
production and distribution cost, di . We see that public sector prices generally rise with increasing
production costs. This is relevant because cold storage is quite costly (Morris 2020). However,
Moderna recently announced that its vaccine can tolerate a less stringent cold chain than initially
thought, and it is hypothesized that Pfizer might eventually come to a similar conclusion. Thus, we
can expect public sector prices to start high but eventually decrease as the temperature requirements
relax, lowering distribution costs.

4.2

Profit

The CDC has an incentive to ensure minimum target profits are attained by both manufacturers.
This can prevent the formation of a monopoly caused by one manufacturer leaving the market. Our
model identifies public sector prices and quantities that guarantee each manufacturer achieves its
target profit.

News articles have suggested possible prices of the upcoming vaccines by comparing the federal
research funding offered to each manufacturer in exchange for a contracted number of doses if
the vaccine is approved. For Pfizer, the federal support of $1.95B in exchange for 100M doses
indicates an effective public sector price of $39 per two-dose regimen (Businesswire 2020b). For
Moderna, the federal support of $2.48B in exchange for 100M doses amounts to a public sector
price of $49.6 per two-dose regimen (Businesswire 2020a).
Using our model, we can identify scenarios in which both manufacturers secure a profit with public
sector prices in the ranges cited. Table 3 gives the settings of the tunable parameters from Table
1 yielding public sector prices in the range of $34 − 44 per two doses for Pfizer and $45 − 55
per two doses for Moderna. Not only do the realized profits meet the projected target profits
for each manufacturer in each of the five scenarios identified, realized profit for one of the two
manufacturers substantially exceeds target profit in scenarios 1, 3, and 4.

Conclusion

In summary, we have adapted the model of Cummings, Behzad, and Martonosi 2020 to the anticipated COVID-19 vaccine market duopoly between Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna. This paper
extends the original model by incorporating production and distribution costs, anticipated to be
substantial for mRNA vaccines requiring cold storage. Using publicly available information about
the two companies and related vaccine markets, we use the model to recommend public sector
11

prices to be negotiated by the CDC under a variety of parameter combinations. Prices yielded
by the model are realistic, averaging $34-$35 per two-dose regimen. Moreover, several trends
emerge:
1. The CDC can negotiate prices with the manufacturers that keep public sector prices as low
as possible while meeting demand and ensuring each manufacturer earns a target profit, even
when production costs are high.
2. We can expect the public sector costs to decrease over time as the cold storage requirements
of the vaccines loosen.
3. If the vaccines are differentiated through factors such as delivery method and adverse effects,
we can expect disparate prices between the two manufacturers.
4. Prices speculated in the media are observed as valid outputs of the model, indicating that
such prices could satisfy the public sector demand, achieve the manufacturers’ target profits,
and minimize government costs.
As better information becomes available about the COVID-19 vaccines, the model can be finetuned. Moreover, while this paper has focused on Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, the two frontrunners in the COVID-19 vaccine race, there are other manufacturers currently developing COVID-19
vaccines intended for the U.S. market, including several that, as of this writing, are in clinical trials
(New York Times 2020). The original game theoretic model of Behzad and Jacobson 2016 applies
more generally to oligopolies, and the optimization model can also incorporate more than two
manufacturers. As the COVID-19 vaccine market evolves, the CDC and other decision-makers
can use this model to guide pricing decisions.
