Research in context
Evidence before this study
The global disruption of life by COVID-19 and the persistent uncertainties related to
widespread mobility restrictions has spurred multiple questionnaire studies on selfperceived anxiety and sleep. The prevalent concern is about disrupted sleep and
understandably the impact has been greatest on front-line health care workers. Less is
known about post-lockdown sleep in the general working population whose wellbeing will
be critical for restarting damaged economies. Widespread lockdowns also affect physical
activity, another powerful influencer of wellbeing. There has been virtually no research into
collective sleep and physical activity shifts in the working public.
Added value of this study
We analyzed longitudinal sleep/activity wearable tracker data from ~1800 office workers
collected before the COVID-19 outbreak, through incremental movement restrictions
culminating in lockdown that permitted socially distanced walking, running and cycling. In
addition to characterizing objective measures of sleep and physical activity across the entire
sample, we demonstrate how heterogenous groups with different sociodemographic
characteristics are affected by using novel rest activity rhythm and hierarchical clustering
approaches.
Implications of the available evidence
Contrary to popular expectation, sleep shifted later but may otherwise benefit from
lockdown. Substantial drop in physical activity is of greater concern. Longitudinal monitoring
of rest-activity rhythms through incrementally severe movement restrictions revealed
heterogenous patterns of sleep and physical activity across a population. Wide-scale
adoption of the methods described here may help identify groups at risk should further or
extended lockdowns occur.

ABSTRACT
Background
Mobility restrictions imposed to suppress coronavirus transmission can alter physical
activity (PA) and sleep patterns. Characterization of response heterogeneity and their
underlying reasons may assist in tailoring customized interventions.
Methods
We obtained wearable data covering baseline, incremental movement restriction and
lockdown periods from 1824 city-dwelling, working adults aged 21-40 years, incorporating
206,381 nights of sleep and 334,038 days of PA. Four distinct rest activity rhythms (RAR)
were identified using k-means clustering of participants’ temporally distributed step counts.
Hierarchical clustering of the proportion of time spent in each of these RAR revealed 4
groups who expressed different mixtures of RAR profiles before and during the lockdown.
Findings
Substantial but asymmetric delays in bedtime and waketime resulted in a 24 min increase in
weekday sleep duration with no loss in sleep efficiency. Resting heart rate declined ~2 bpm.
PA dropped an average of 38%. 4 groups with different compositions of RAR profiles were
found. Three were better able to maintain PA and weekday/weekend differentiation during
lockdown. The least active group comprising ~51% of the sample, were younger and
predominantly singles. Habitually less active already, this group showed the greatest
reduction in PA during lockdown with little weekday/weekend differences.
Interpretation
Among different mobility restrictions, removal of habitual social cues by lockdown, had the
largest effect on PA and sleep. Sleep and resting heart rate unexpectedly improved. RAR
evaluation uncovered heterogeneity of responses to lockdown and can identify
characteristics of persons at risk of decline in health and wellbeing.

INTRODUCTION
Adequate sleep and physical activity (PA) are two of the triad of lifestyle factors critical to
multiple aspects of health and wellbeing. Mobility restrictions imposed to contain spread of
COVID-19 massively disrupted the daily routines of people worldwide, but particularly the
structured lives of city-dwellers who represent 55% of the world’s population1. Lockdowns
interfere with time cues that mark when to wake-up, commute to work, organize meals,
care for dependents, socialize, recreate and wind down to sleep2. Heterogeneity in changes
to sleep and PA in response to lockdown can increase health disparities and are the focus of
this study.
Urban life predisposes persons to late bedtimes on weekdays and greater sleep extension
on weekends3 which elevates risk for metabolic dysfunction4. During the pandemic, greater
anxiety2 and increased engagement on electronic media5 for social engagement and news
gathering could drive bedtimes later for some, curtailing sleep. In contrast, working from
home6 could afford greater flexibility in scheduling, avoidance of commuting and reduced
stress for others, which could facilitate sleep. Pre-print findings in participants of a diseasemonitoring consortium suggest the latter7.
Physical activity benefits musculoskeletal, cognitive8, cardiometabolic health9 and sleep10.
Additionally, exercise outdoors positively influences mental wellbeing11 and morning light
exposure serves to synchronize the circadian clock12, checking the innate tendency to sleep
progressively later. Even if one does not have time for intentional exercise, walking on the
way to and from work can contribute significantly to physical activity 13,14. Mobility
restrictions serve to severely limit commuting but the extent to which outdoor activities are
limited15 varies significantly across countries7 modulating this limitation.
In addition to duration of sleep and physical activity of themselves, their respective timing
and distribution matter. For example, it may be preferable to accumulate physical activity
across the day rather than to concentrate it within a short period while retaining extended
sedentary time16. How incremental mobility restriction upsets the rhythm of sleep and
daytime physical activity is therefore of interest.

Since August 2018, over a thousand young working adults in Singapore were provided with a
Fitbit™ Ionic wearable sleep and activity tracker to evaluate health behavior. The intention
was to examine the effects of lifestyle factors and their modulation on chronic noncommunicable disease risk. This ongoing study provides a unique opportunity to
characterize how COVID-19 associated movement restrictions shift sleep and physical
activity patterns from previously established baselines using objective, longitudinal
measurement as distinct from questionnaire-based studies 5,17. In addition to whole sample
characterization, we used machine-learning data-clustering to show how lockdown results
in heterogenous sleep and physical activity transformations in different sociodemographic
groups. These differentiate our approach from data mining using public tools18 to access
aggregated data that offers broader coverage but is less useful for formulating targeted
interventions7.

RESULTS
Key characteristics of the sample and time series data
The data reported here represents 206,381 nights of sleep and 334,038 days of physical
activity data collected from 1824 persons from Jan 3 – Apr 29 th 2019, and Jan 2 – Apr 27th
2020. These dates refer to the morning of each sleep/daytime activity record, such that
sleep always preceded activity for that date. Participants were between 21-40 years of age,
51.64% of whom were women. Most were office workers who commuted to Singapore’s
Central Business District. They were relatively well educated (86.1% college degree) and
earned a median salary of SGD 4000-5999. Singles comprised 57.8%, married persons with
children 21.9%. Other details about sociodemographic features can be found in Table 1.
Average weekday daily commute time reported in this sample was 1.92h (SD: 0.71h), so
time taken to travel to and fro work could be estimated to be ~1h each way. Details on the
requirements for participation are described in Materials and Methods.
Singapore responded to the COVID-19 pandemic by instituting a host of infection control
measures that ramped up from the announcement of the first case in Singapore (Jan 23), to
the raising of its health alert (Feb 7), followed by stay-at-home orders for overseas
returnees, announcement of border closures (Mar 16) and closing of pubs (Mar 26)

constituting the first phase of movement restrictions (Fig. 1). An outbreak of infections in
construction worker dormitories triggered a lockdown that caused cessation of nonessential services (Apr 7). Schools, malls and retail outlets were closed, and workers had to
work from home. Outdoor activities were confined to walking, running and cycling with
appropriate social distancing. This can be considered the second, ‘lockdown’ phase of
mobility restriction (Fig. S1).
Baseline sleep and physical activity characteristics across the sample
Consistent with the highly structured nature of city life, participants kept to a regular sleep
and wake schedule during both weekdays and weekends. Sleep timing and duration was
highly consistent from week to week, as well as across two equivalent months in January
2019 and 2020 (Table 2; Fig. 1 A-D). On average, at baseline, bedtime was 00:13, waketime
was 07:07 and total time in bed was 6.9 h (total sleep time: 6.0h) on weekdays. On
weekends, bedtime was 00:53, waketime was 08:26 and total sleep duration was 7.5 h (total
sleep time: 6.5h). Weekday-weekend sleep extension of 38 minutes during this period was
present suggesting inadequacy of habitual pre-pandemic weekday sleep. Sleep efficiency,
defined as percentage of time spent actually asleep out of total time in bed, and which is
often considered as an objective marker of sleep quality, was generally high at ~87% (Fig.
1E).
Physical activity on weekdays showed a creep upwards from Monday to Friday, peaking on
Saturdays and sharply dropping on Sundays before starting another cycle (Fig. 1F). Overall,
participants’ step counts hovered close to the popularized ’10 000 steps a day’ threshold
week on week, averaging about 9700 steps. Of this, between 35-50 minutes was in the form
of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (Fig. 1G).
Sleep Changes with Incremental Mobility Restrictions
Sleep patterns were neither affected by the raising of the national health alert level, nor by
the WHO pandemic announcement. Only subsequent to border closures and institution of
non-mandatory split-teams at work, did weekday sleep timings start to shift (Fig. 1 A-D).
Weekday bedtimes were delayed by 11 min and wake times by 22 min. The imposition of

6

lockdown brought on a further shift in weekday bedtimes by about 19 min (total shift of 30
min from baseline) and a delay in wake times by 33 min (total of 55 min from baseline).
Weekend shifts in bedtime were more modest, with no significant shift until the lockdown
period and thereafter, a total delay of 19 minutes from baseline. Despite the magnitude of
this shift being more modest than the weekday shift, the most socio-economically impactful
public holiday period in Singapore, Chinese New Year, only shifted ‘weekend’ sleep timing
by less 12 minutes. As weekend waketimes were also delayed by 31 minutes there was
increased total weekend sleep duration.
Overall, total weekday sleep duration increased by about 24 minutes during lockdown
compared to the habitual weekday baseline; the increase in sleep duration over weekends
was smaller 13 minutes. The shifts in sleep timing over weekdays and weekends resulted in
the attenuation of the habitual and robust weekend sleep extension to 26 min during
lockdown. Sleep efficiency remained at ~87% throughout the mobility restriction.
Physical Activity Changes with Incremental Mobility Restrictions
Similar to the pattern of changes observed with sleep, step counts started to decline only
after border and pub closures, dropping on average by ~15% steps from baseline. To put this
decrement in perspective, it was larger in percentage and absolute count differential
elicited by rewarding increased physical activity during a previous physical activity
intervention program19. Following the imposition of the lockdown, there was a further
overnight decline, resulting in a cumulative 38% decline in average step counts. Before the
pandemic, participants were relatively more active on weekdays. This pattern reversed
following the lockdown.
Changes in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) broadly occurred in synchrony
with step counts, although decreasing less, about 31% over the week on average. However,
there were important differences. As MVPA likely incorporates intentional physical exercise,
it would likely be part of entrenched behavior that would be more robust to change, even
with lockdowns. This can be seen by continuation of baseline levels of MVPA until pubs and

7

gyms were closed where upon a downtrend commenced. Lockdown elicited a second
decrement in MVPA possibly contributed by stadium closures.
Systematic patterns of heterogeneity in sleep and physical activity uncovered with RAR
analysis
In order to investigate concurrent changes to the magnitude of physical activity, as well as
the duration and timing of sleep and activity within an individual across days, we explored
changes to 24h rest-activity rhythm (RAR) profiles with increasing mobility restrictions.
Characterization of patterns and shifts in 24h sleep-wake behavior based on actigraphic
monitoring of locomotor activity has been an area of interest for circadian researchers for
many years, as disruptions to the timing, amplitude and regularity of these RARs (e.g. by
ageing or disease) can influence health and behaviour20,21. While traditional methods
typically fit a 24h sinusoid to describe these rhythms, we have shown that this is often a
poor representation of real-world rhythms in populations with relatively fixed weekday
schedules. We employed a data-driven approach to identify profile clusters, or ‘basis
patterns’ of these RARs, using k-means clustering of intraday log-transformed step counts
(natural log) in 15-min bins across the day. For this analysis, we used all valid days with a
minimum daily wear time of 13h from all participants in Jan-Apr 2020 (125,851 days).
We identified 4 distinct RAR profiles: ‘Active 3-Peak Early’, ‘3-Peak Middle’, ‘Active 2-Peak
Later’ and ‘Inactive 3-Peak’, describing both magnitude as well as timing of preferred
daytime activity (Fig. 2A). Before the lockdown, weekdays tended to consist of more ‘Active
3-Peak Early’ and ‘3-Peak Middle’ days (Fig. 2 B), indicating the strong influence of work as a
frame around which life is organized (Peak 1: Travelling to work, Peak 2: Travelling to lunch,
Peak 3: Travelling home). In contrast, weekends tended to consist of more ‘Active 2-Peak
Later’ and ‘Inactive 3-Peak’ days, indicating temporally less structured / lower magnitude of
daytime activity. During the lockdown, both ‘weekend’ patterns increased their expression
during weekdays.
A control analyses performed on Jan 2019, Jan 2020 and during the lockdown separately
revealed that before the restrictions were imposed, the clustered profiles were virtually
identical (r > 0.99; Fig. S2, A and B). During the lockdown period, profiles became attenuated
8

but were still highly similar to the profiles estimated using the full dataset (r: 0.84-0.98; Fig.
S2C).
Impact of lockdown on rest activity rhythms differs dramatically across individuals
To identify groups of individuals who show similar changes in RAR profile composition with
increasing mobility restrictions, we performed hierarchical clustering on the proportion of
time each individual spent in the four canonical RAR profiles before and during the Apr 7
lockdown (Fig. 3A), and compared sleep and physical activity changes during the lockdown
to a baseline period (Table 3, Fig. S3 to S4). This analysis was confined to 670 individuals
who had at least 60% of data before and during the lockdown (missing days were excluded
from the proportions calculation, such that proportion of time spent summed to 1 both
before and during the lockdown). Supplementary analysis revealed that compared to
excluded participants, included participants tended to be older (~1y) and had a higher
proportion of individuals married with children (27% vs. 19%).
Group 1, whose dominant profile alternated between “3-Peak Middle” and “Active 2-Peak
Later” before the lockdown showed the most drastic change to a predominant “Inactive 3Peak” during the lockdown (>70% of the time; Fig. 3B-C), with a clear abolition of weekdayweekend differences in RAR profiles. They were the single largest group comprising about
51% of the sample who were the least physically active compared to the other 3 groups at
baseline (9517 steps in Group 1 compared to 12011, 10960, 11275 steps in Groups 2, 3 and
4 respectively; all ps < .001). This group also showed the largest drop in step count - a
massive 51% reduction in steps relative to baseline (-4833 steps in Group 1 compared to 2742, -2098, and -2966 in Groups 2, 3 and 4 respectively; all ps < .001). This group also slept
and woke late. Total sleep time was not adversely affected by the lockdown, and in fact,
slightly increased by 17.5 min (p < .001). Interestingly, in contrast to their strongly
attenuated weekday /weekend activity difference (pre-lockdown attenuation = -590 steps,
post-lockdown attenuation = +289 steps, p < .001), there was only relatively, modest
attenuation of weekday/ weekend difference in sleep duration (pre-lockdown difference
+37 min TST, during-lockdown, +23 min difference in TST, p < .001). This group was overrepresented by younger, single persons who likely have more flexibility with day-day
schedules.
9

Group 2 comprised 14% of persons whose dominant RAR was ‘Active 3-Peak Early’ (50-70%
of the time; Fig. 3B-C) before and during the lockdown, although there was a slight
reduction in proportion of the dominant profile on weekdays during the lockdown. This
group was the most physically active, averaging around 12011 steps before the pandemic
and 9268 steps when the lockdown was imposed. This group was over-represented by
married couples with children. Consistent with having childcare responsibilities that would
require them to wake earlier in the day, this group tended to retain their habitual sleep /
wake timings as well as sleep duration. It is possible that the slight reduction in their
dominant profile on weekdays during the lockdown suggests that they did not have to wake
up as early to prepare themselves for work and their children for school.
Group 3 expressed a clear weekday dominant ‘3-Peak Middle’ RAR profile and weekend
dominant ‘Active 2-Peak Later’ RAR profile, which was preserved during the lockdown (Fig.
3B-C). This group had moderate step counts (between Group 1 and 2) and moderate sleepwake timings. Apart from a later sleep and wake timing, they bore significant similarities to
Group 2 in terms of their consistency and intensity of physical activity. This group averaged
10960 steps before lockdown and dropped the least of all 4 groups and remarkably,
maintained their habitual duration of MVPA even through lockdown (p = .50). This group
was best able to maintain weekday weekend differences in routines. Group 3 was strongly
dominated by persons with a college degree but had even representation in terms of family
status.
Group 4 was mainly characterized by a dominant “Active 2-Peak Later” RAR profile on both
weekdays and weekends (Fig. 3B-C), that was only slightly attenuated during the lockdown
as proportion of time spent in the dominant state increased on weekdays. It was the second
largest group in the sample (27%) resembling Group 1 in terms of late sleep and wake
timings (p = .99, p = .22 respectively) but its members were more physically active (p < .001),
resembling Group 3 in consistency of steps, and intensity of overall physical activity (p = .48,
p = .49 respectively). This group also had more individuals who were married with children.

DISCUSSION
In young adult office workers living in a densely populated city, incremental mobility
restrictions to stem the spread of COVID-19 showed the greatest impact on physical activity.
A full lockdown, involving cessation of regular office work, school closures and limitation on
interpersonal interaction to nuclear family members, but not lesser restrictions had the
clearest impact. Rest activity rhythm analysis revealed significant heterogeneity the ability
to maintain habitual routines despite this major societal upheaval. Against popular notions
that sleep could be significantly disrupted, we found only modest evidence for this in the
early period following lockdown.
The strong influence of going to the office on physical activity accrues from three
observations. Most compelling was the overnight, 23% drop in step count when offices were
closed but walking, running or cycling outdoors with social distancing, were allowed.
Second, post-lockdown, weekend steps exceeded weekday steps, reversing the baseline
pattern likely driven by commuting-related weekday steps. Thirdly, the ~50-minute delay in
wake time and later commencement of a diminished morning bump in physical activity.
The widespread availability of broadband internet, mobile video conferencing and
establishment of business continuity plans have made it more feasible for persons to work
from home than ever before. However, until lockdown, physical activity records suggest that
the status quo of going to work largely continued. Alternative arrangements such as working
from home22 or shortening the workweek23 have been extensively debated 6 with relatively
little society-wide change. The extensive lockdowns globally, provide an unprecedented
opportunity to critically reappraise the pragmatics of these issues.
Contrary to widespread expectation that the pandemic would elevate anxiety which would
be reflected in poorer sleep2,17, we did not find support for this. Total time in bed increased
on weekdays and weekend sleep extension, a sign of inadequate weekday sleep, decreased.
Sleep efficiency was maintained from baseline through lockdown suggesting no significant
disruption in sleep initiation or continuity. Perhaps more interestingly, resting heart rate, an
indicator of cardiovascular risk24, dropped by ~2 bpm.

11

For persons in Groups 1 and 4, not having to wake up early to go to the office, likely
surfaced innate delayed sleep timing, thus lessening the impact of keeping to traditional
work hours. The overall later timings of bedtime and waketime, even for earlier sleepers
and risers relative to results published elsewhere 25, could be indicative of Singapore’s
‘westerly’ position relative to its assigned time zone. Later bedtimes and shorter nocturnal
sleep co-occur with chronic, longitude-related exposure to later evening light26.
The robustness of RAR profiles revealed over comparable weeks in January 2019 and 2020
speaks to their utility as basis patterns whose automated detection reduces the
dimensionality of longitudinal, sleep and physical activity data. This could simplify the
identification of persons who might benefit from customized counsel during extended
lockdowns. When data on the long-term impact on health, wellbeing or productivity
measurements emerge, RAR may be refined as a public health predictive tool.
Averaged over weeks or months, a step-count close to 10,000, preservation of MVPA, a
sleep duration closer to that recommended, and a lower resting heart rate are desirable.
Greater sleep regularity27,28 and lesser weekday-weekend differences29 in sleep timing are
considered favorable to health. However, the attenuation in weekday/weekend physical
activity differences seen here likely reflects social isolation30 that has long term
consequences on mental wellbeing.
Given these considerations, Group 3 may have the best combination of outcome variables,
being associated with the best preserved MVPA and well-preserved weekday-weekend
variation in physical activity together with more consistent bedtimes and waketimes. In
contrast, over half the sample in Group 1 showed a ~51% reduction in step counts and
relatively lesser reduction in weekend sleep extension in response to mobility restriction.
Although not statistically significant, there was a trend for resting heart rate, a proxy for
cardiovascular risk, to diverge between these two groups such that over a longer period of
observation, Group 1 might be at higher risk.
Sociodemographic variables influence RAR pattern shifts. Group 1 was disproportionately
represented by singles who may be working even longer hours from home, resulting in less
12

time for physical activity and profound loss of differentiation between weekends and
weekdays. This group of individuals could benefit from setting regular routines to provision
time for rest, physical activity and work, and to sleep and wake at fixed times at a time
when social cues are disrupted. In contrast, Group 2 who wake up the earliest and also sleep
earlier are over-represented by persons who are married with children. Having the
responsibility to care for the latter would serve to drive more temporally structured activity,
leading to the preservation of a three peaked RAR. The repetition of this routine daily
without recourse to weekend family outings, on the other hand serves to obscure
weekday/weekend activity differences.
Limitations
Limitations include a relatively limited time window of observation, the likely exclusion of
persons with highly disturbed sleep schedules who might have stopped contributing their
data, and the non-availability of health biomarkers. The collection of subjective sleep quality
measures might also have revealed changes not uncovered by objective sleep markers. For
example, increased hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis reactivity that relates to
perceived stress, seems to relate more to sleep quality more than sleep duration31. Related
to this, interpretation of the lowered resting heart rate findings could have benefited from
information about participants’ self-perceived stress. As most of the participants have
existing jobs, which for the present time appear to be preserved by various governmental
financial supports, the sleep patterns here are likely, less affected than for a socioeconomically distressed sample. Finally, as further lockdowns are likely and the period of
exposure to widespread mobility restrictions may be extended, the findings herein may be
time bounded in their generalizability.
Conclusion
Longitudinal monitoring of rest-activity rhythms through incrementally severe movement
restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic revealed heterogenous patterns of sleep and
physical activity. Widescale adoption of the methods described here may help identify
persons or groups at risk should further lockdowns occur as well as to gauge the impact of
different lockdown unwinding policies.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data source
Data was obtained from the ‘Health Insights Singapore’ (hiSG) study, a longitudinal
population-health study by the Health Promotion Board using wrist-worn wearable
technology. Initiated in August 2018, the study recruited 1,951 young adults working in the
Central Business District aged 21-40 years. Participants were given devices (Fitbit™ Ionic,
Fitbit™ Inc, San Francisco, CA) to track their activity/sleep and installed a mobile application
to complete surveys over a period of 2 years. Participants were rewarded with points
convertible to vouchers if they wore the tracker daily, logged sleep, meals, and completed
surveys and were allowed to keep the device conditional on meeting study requirements.
Demographic, health and lifestyle questionnaires were administered at study
commencement. A second survey conducted in February 2020 was used to update any
changes to family status. The National Healthcare Group Domain Specific Review Board
approved the study protocol. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects prior to
study participation.
To evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we studied data gathered between 2 Jan
2020 and 27 Apr 2020, starting three weeks before the first case was reported in Singapore
(‘Baseline’, Jan 2-22) and ending three weeks into the lockdown enforced by the Singapore
government (‘Lockdown’, Apr 7-27). To compare this to an equivalent period in 2019, we
used data from 3 Jan – 29 Apr 2019. Only individuals who had valid data on both years after
filtering (see below) were included. This comprised 206,381 nights of sleep and 334,038
days of physical activity from a final sample of 1824 individuals. All dates presented refer to
the morning of each sleep/daytime activity record, such that sleep always preceded activity
for that date.
Tracker-based data
Sleep and activity data for each participant were extracted from the Fitbit™ API. The activity
data comprised daily total steps, moderate-to-vigorous activity (MVPA) minutes (sum of
fairly and very active minutes), resting heart rate levels and intraday step counts in 15 min
intervals. For the comparison of measurements across time, data was filtered to remove
14

days when participants did not wear the Fitbit™ for at least 8h/day or when atypical activity
levels were observed. This was defined as records with 1) total daily steps > 50000, 2) total
daily steps > 40000 and sedentary minutes > 1320 min, 3) sedentary minutes = 1440 min,
and 4) no resting heart rate. Between 1041 to 1562 (mean: 1375) participants contributed
to each timepoint for physical activity data. Wear time averaged 18h to 19h (mean: 18.5h)
for each day. Not everyone contributed data on all the dates, but the large sample made it
less likely that any individual’s data would significantly alter group means.
For the computation of RAR profile clusters, only days containing intraday steps with no
indicators of long periods of non-wear, as well as days with at least 13h of total wear time
were used, for a final sample of 125,851 valid days.
Sleep data consisted of bedtimes, wake times, time in bed (TIB), total sleep time (TST), and
time spent awake after sleep onset (WASO). Sleep efficiency was (100*TST/TIB). As in our
prior work, we limited analyses to only nights with heart rate-derived sleep staged data, as
this ensured proper wear time during the night and excluded records manually adjusted by
the user. Records that indicated <4h TIB or >12h TIB were also excluded from the calculation
of sleep variables, as it could indicate inappropriate detection of sleep by the algorithm (e.g.
long periods of sedentary activity after wake). In addition, to exclude atypical sleep periods,
we removed sleep sessions that commenced between 8am and 8pm, sleep sessions that
commenced after 8pm but ending on the same day, and split sleep sessions. Importantly,
the number of records excluded did not materially differ for records before the lockdown
(4.61%) compared to during the lockdown (4.46%). After data filtering, between 766 to 1063
(mean: 898) participants contributed to each timepoint for sleep data (Fig. 1).
Identification of canonical rest activity patterns
For each day and from each individual, a rest activity rhythm (RAR) profile was obtained by
log-transforming the 24h intraday raw step counts using a natural log function. Each day
consisted of 96 15-min interval bins, starting and ending at 00:00 and 23:45 respectively. All
valid days across the whole sample from Jan – Apr 2020 (125,851 days) were subsequently
fed into a k-means clustering model to identify distinct clusters, or ‘basis sets’ of daily RAR

15

profiles. This approach enabled quantitative characterization of RAR changes from baseline
through lockdown.
The k-means++ algorithm in MATLAB R2016b (Mathworks, Inc., Natick, MA) was used to
optimize initialization of the cluster centres32. This was done by random selection of the first
cluster centre, and subsequently choosing additional cluster centres from the remaining
data points with probability proportional to their squared distance from the nearest existing
cluster centres.
A range of cluster values was explored (k=2-10) before settling on k=4 for a parsimonious
yet meaningful set of clusters. Euclidean distance was used as the distance metric.
Clustering of persons with similar changes in RAR profile composition during mobility
restrictions
To identify groups of individuals who show similar changes in RAR profile composition with
increasing mobility restrictions, we computed proportion of days spent in each RAR profile
both before and during the lockdown for each individual. Agglomerative hierarchical
clustering was performed using these proportions as feature values on participants with at
least 60% of valid days before and during the lockdown (N=670) using Ward’s method and
the Euclidean distance metric. This clustering method begins by considering each individual
as a separate entity, and clustering individuals that are close together in distance. This
process was repeated until all individuals were clustered. Inspection of the dendrogram
helped identify a 4-cluster solution.
Statistical analysis
One-way analyses of variance (ANOVA) and Pearson’s chi-squared test of independence
were used to analyze sociodemographic differences between the 4 cluster-derived groups.
In addition, 2 x 4 mixed ANOVAs were also performed on activity and sleep variables
between the different groups with time as the within-subject factor (‘Baseline’, ‘Lockdown’)
and Group, the between-subject factor. Only subjects who had a minimum of 5 weekdays
and 2 weekends in each time point (‘Baseline’, ‘Lockdown’) were included in this analysis

16

(N=667). For each variable, data points outside the 1.5 interquartile range were removed
from analyses. All statistical analyses were performed in R version 3.6.1.

Fig. 1. Time series plots between Jan 2 - Apr 27, 2020 (blue curves) and Jan 3 - Apr 29, 2019 (red
curves) for sleep (top panel) and physical activity/heart rate (bottom panel) parameters. (A)
Bedtime, (B) Waketime, (C) Time In Bed, (D) Total Sleep Time, (E) Sleep Efficiency, (F) Step Counts,
(G) Time spent in Moderate-to-Vigorous Physical Activity (MVPA) and (H) Resting Heart Rate.
Weekends (gray shaded regions) and public holidays (light blue and pink shaded regions) are also
delineated. Dates reflect the ‘morning’ of each record, such that sleep records always preceded
physical activity. Dates in 2019 were shifted by 1 day in order to ensure a matching by day of the
week. Key events during the COVID-19 pandemic period (‘Baseline’, ‘Increased Restrictions’, and
‘Lockdown’) are also indicated.

Fig. 2. RAR profiles. (A) Centroids for the 4 key RAR profiles determined by k-means
clustering of intraday step counts across 125,851 days from Jan-Apr 2020 from all
participants for the “Active 3-Peak Early” (green curve, n = 28,723 days), “3-Peak Middle”
(blue curve, n = 32,981 days), “Active 2-Peak Later” (brown curve, n = 30,635 days) and
“Inactive 3-Peak” (red curve, n = 33,512 days) clusters. Clusters were differentiated by
timing of morning rise and evening drop as well as magnitude of steps across the 24h day.
(B) Proportion of time spent in the 4 RAR profiles from Jan-Apr 2020. Before the lockdown,
weekday rhythms primarily consisted of the “Active 3-Peak Early” and “3-Peak Middle”
profiles, while weekend rhythms mainly consisted of the “Active 2-Peak Later” and “Inactive
3-Peak” profiles. After the lockdown, a clear increase in the proportion of time spent in the
“Active2-Peak Later” and “Inactive 3-Peak” profiles was observed, together with an
attenuation of weekday-weekend rhythms.

Fig. 3. Identification of groups with similar RAR changes before and during the lockdown.
(A) Hierarchical clustering of participants based on proportion of time spent in the 4 RAR
profiles before and after the lockdown. Visual inspection of the dendrogram identified 4
groups of participants with similar changes in the patterns of RAR profiles before and during
the lockdown. (B) Proportion of time spent in the dominant RAR profiles on weekdays and
weekends for each group, before and after the lockdown. (C) RAR profiles across days
(columns) by participant (rows) ordered by groups partitioned from the hierarchical
clustering. Groups are coloured by their dominant RAR profile colour for ease of reference.

RAR profiles were highly similar between Jan 2019 and Jan 2020 (r > 0.99). After the
lockdown RAR profiles were slightly attenuated, but still highly similar to the profiles
estimated using the full dataset from Jan-Apr 2020 (r: 0.84-0.98).
