Abstract—Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), due to its
extremely high infectivity, has been spreading rapidly around the
world and bringing huge influence to socioeconomic development
as well as people’s daily life. Taking for example the virus
transmission that may occur after college students return to
school during the outbreak, we analyze the quantitative influence
of the key factors on the virus spread, including crowd density
and self-protection. One Campus Virus Infection and Control
Simulation model (CVICS) of the novel coronavirus is proposed
in this paper, based on the characteristics of repeated contact and
strong mobility of crowd in the closed environment. Specifically,
we build an agent-based infection model, introduce the mean
field theory to calculate the probability of virus transmission,
and micro-simulate the daily prevalence of infection among
individuals. The simulation experiment results show that the
proposed model in this paper fully illuminates how the virus
spread in the dense crowd. Furthermore, preventive and control
measures such as self-protection, crowd decentralization and
isolation during the epidemic can effectively delay the arrival of
infection peak and reduce the prevalence, and thus lower the risk
of COVID-19 transmission after the students return to school.

simulation, Epidemic prevention and control.

I. I NTRODUCTION
T the end of 2019, the pneumonia epidemic caused
by novel coronavirus swept the world, bringing varying
degrees of impact on the economy, production, life, etc [1].
The virus spreads rapidly and widely, especially in the environment with high crowd density and strong crowd mobility. In
response to the sudden outbreak, China took various countermeasures immediately, such as extending citizen holidays,
postponing the return to work and school, and assisting the
disaster areas, which effectively reduce the impact of the
spread of the virus. To tackle the problem of suspend classes,
governments around the world proposed various distance
learning programs through modern technologies to guarantee
students to continue their education. However, due to the
unsatisfactory teaching quality, it is very important for students
to return back to school. Several common ways of prevention
on campus are shown in Figure 1. As a relatively special group,
college students spread all over the country, and will contact
with a large number of people on the way back to school. After

returning to school, students will inevitably gather together to
study and live. The above phenomenons will have a negative
impact on the epidemic prevention and control work, and the
large gatherings of dense crowd with strong mobility will
even accelerate spread of the epidemic [2]. Therefore, how
to manage the college students after they return to school is a
significant problem to be solved.
Regarding the spread of novel coronavirus, we can analyze
their laws and trends by constructing infection models. In most
of existing models, SIR model and SEIR model, which are
based on the dynamic systems [3], are adopted to fit the urban
infection curve. However, it is a completely different problem
on campus. Since the university is a relatively closed space,
where a lot of contact is unavoidable [4]. The average number
of people contacted each day on campus is different from that
of urban residents. The existing urban simulation model cannot
be applied to the university environment. Directly, novel
coronavirus is quite different from other previous infectious
diseases. For example, SARS and another infamous coronavirus, which broke out in 2003, researchers have also built
corresponding models to study its infectious characteristics.
Although the incidence characteristics and other aspects of
SARS are relatively similar to COVID-19, SARS dose not
have infectiousness in the latent period, which is different
from the present one. Therefore, we cannot reuse the previous
infection models. Moreover, the existing simulation models for
large scale population are usually macroscopic, which means
that they do not focus on individuals, hence cannot reflect
the differences among individuals. The microscopic simulation
model requires consideration of attributes of each individual
in detail. As the number of individuals studied increases,
the calculation time will increases significantly. As the virus
spread rapidly and widely, The simulation time is the key
factor to evaluate the model.
In response to the outbreak of coronavirus, governments
around the world have took various measures to lower the

2

influence. For example, China has developed a series of
containment and obtained satisfying results. To be specific,
the Chinese government approved the travel ban, encouraged
people to stay at home to avoid gathering, restricted social activities, etc. However, some countries or organizations
ignore the spread effect of the virus in the dense crowd,
which aggravates the situation. A case in point is "Diamond
Princess", where the virus spread rapidly due to insufficient
preventive and control measures in the early stage. Taking a
lesson from it, it is necessary to take strict measures to curb
the spread of the virus in the environment with high-density
population [5].
In this paper, we comprehensively consider various factors
that cause the spread of the disease, and propose a campus
virus infection and control simulation (CVICS) model of the
novel coronavirus, based on the characteristics of repeated
contact and strong mobility of crowd in the closed environment. The agent is the main component in simulation,
and each individual can perceive the surrounding environment
independently [6]. The movements of the individual are given
by social force [7][8]. At the same time, the spread of the
virus among individuals in different scenes on campus can be
simulated. The advantage of this model is that it can present
the state information of each agent in the environment at each
moment from a micro perspective, making the simulation more
realistic. Taking comprehensively consider the key factors such
as crowd density and self-protection into account, effective
preventive and control measures such as travelling in batches,
staggered travel and isolation are put forward. According to
several groups of comparative experiments, we can observe
the trend of virus transmission on campus. Through the intervention of group behavior, the infection rate can be effectively
reduced.
Our major contributions are listed as follows:
1. We propose a simulation model (CVICS) of the novel
coronavirus, based on the characteristics of repeated contact
and strong mobility of crowd in the closed environment.
We simulate the daily prevalence of infection among college
students, and propose effective control measures with analysis.
2. Considering the differences among individuals, we design
an agent-based simulation, introduce the mean field theory
to calculate the probability of virus transmission, and microsimulate the daily prevalence of infection among individuals.
3. Taking Zhengzhou University as an example, we simulate
the virus infection among college students during the epidemic
period. Then we propose control measures such as travelling
in batches, staggered shifts and isolation, and prove their
effectiveness on reducing the infection rate.
II. R ELATED WORK
Our work in novel coronavirus infection simulation has
focused on infection model and crowd simulation, which are
key to simulate infection trend on campus.
A. Infection model
Nowadays, the spread of virus is generally studied by
constructing various infection models, to carry out an accurate

risk assessment. In the micro models, the classic SIR model
divides the population into susceptible, infected, and recovering groups [9]. It is a good demonstration of the process of
infectious diseases from the onset to the end. The premise of
using this model is that patients suffering from such infectious
diseases can recover, and can produce permanent antibodies,
and no longer participate in the spread of the disease. Since
this model can well simulate the propagation of other media,
it has also been widely applied to other fields. As the types
of infectious diseases become more complex, the model of
infectious disease is constantly improved. If the infectious
diseases studied have an incubation period, the improved SEIR
model based on the SIR model will be generally used. The
SEIR model divides the population into susceptible, latent,
infected and rehabilitated, which can describe the transmission
process of the epidemic more accurately. When the SARS
epidemic broke out in 2003, most of the SIR or SEIR models
were used to fitting the infection curve of the city. Liang et
al. [10] conducted experiments through the establishment of
a propagetion growth model by considering the growth rate
and the inhibition constant, which showed that the infection
rate and its changes over time are the most important factors
affecting the spread of SARS. In addition, there are other
similar models such as SI [11] and SIRS [12]. Shi et al.
[13] produced an epidemic dynamics model through studying infectious models. In the study of infectious diseases,
researchers not only predict the number of people in various
stages of disease, but also need to consider the causes of
disease, transmission media, other relevant social factors and
so on [14]. It can help decision-makers formulate prevention
and emergency plans to prevent further the deterioration of
virus spread.
When exploring the infection situation of colleges or universities, the recovery state is not considered. Once the suspected
cases are found, they are sent to the school hospital for
isolation and then transferred out of the college to a designated
location for treatment. Different from the most commonly
used models such as SIR and SEIR to calculate the trend of
the number of people in different states under the epidemic,
campus infection simulation focuses on suspected groups that
may be infected and try to prevent the large spread of the virus.
Currently, the most commonly used models are not completely
suitable for the study of epidemics in universities.
B. Crowd simulation
The technology of crowd simulation has been widely used
in many fields. It can not only be used for generating the
simulation animation of the group state [15], but also be
regarded as an important way to help to design architectural
model and evaluate and calculate costs [16][17]. Common
crowd simulation models include rule-based models, cellular
automata models, social forces-based models [18] and agentbased models [19]. Among them, agent-based simulation has
attracted the attention of many researchers due to its selfadaptive interaction with the environment in a complex sence.
In recent years, more and more researchers pay attention to
the simulation model of infectious diseases. Kleczkowski et

Fig. 2. The system overview of our work. Agent model, infection model and environment model are established for crowd simulation in campus. In the
process of simulation, the virus spreads while the agent is active in the environment. At the same time, various control measures are taken according to the
simulation results.

al. [20] used the cellular automata model, which is a typical
microcosmic model. The simulation model studied the impact
of relevant information in the local space on the spread of epidemics. Eubank et al. [21] developed an agent-based epidemic
simulation system called EpiSimdemics. Barrett et al. [22]
developed EpiSimdemics based on the work of Eubank et al. A
scalable parallel algorithm was proposed to simulate the spread
of infection in a large-scale social network in reality. Bissett
et al. [23] describe an integrated method for computational
health informatics, which includes individual-based population
construction and agent-based dynamic modeling. At present,
there is still a great challenge for large-scale crowd simulation.
The macro crowd simulation model usually studies the whole
and ignores the heterogeneity among individuals. The micro
crowd simulation model focuses on single individual, but when
the number of people increase greatly,the computation will
increase dramatically, and it is difficult to guarantee the speed
and accuracy of calculation. Yang et al. [24] introduce the
mean-field theory to calculate the crowd movement, which formulates the multidimensional problem into two-dimensional
problem to reduce the computational complexity. It can better
handle large-scale crowd movement simulation problem.
Our model uses an agent-based simulation by method to
describe microscopic individuals. The agent-based simulation
model can vividly describe the impact of the surrounding
environment (such as other individuals and obstacles) on the
pedestrian behavior, realistically simulate the daily behavior
of students on campus, which is not available in simulation
systems such as EpiSimdemics. By observing the impact of the
interaction among people in different scenarios (classrooms,
restaurants, dormitories, etc.) on the spread of the virus,
corresponding measures can be taken to reduce the spread of
the virus.
III. C AMPUS VIRUS INFECTION AND CONTROL
SIMULATION

Our model is to study the infection situation of college students to help the effective manage of colleges and universities.
We take Zhengzhou University as one typical example. This
university is located in the Central Plains of China, with a
wide distribution of students, and the campus environment is
very representative.

Fig. 3. Pedestrian detection from the captured videos on campus.

The agent-based model is used to simulate the population
infection situation on the campus of Zhengzhou University
during the epidemic without control measures and after these
measures are taken, to better manage college students. In this
way, we can ensure teaching quality while preventing the
spread of the virus, and reduce the number of infected people
on campus as far as possible.
The system overview is shown in Figure 2.
A. Agent definition
Students in different majors have different learning tasks,
so they are divided into four categories according to their
majors. In the epidemic environment, each student needs to
travel in accordance with the regulations to try to avoid
cross-infection among different groups as shown in Table
1. Everyone starts from the dormitory, visits their respective buildings, and returns to the dormitory. According to
the Dijkstra [25] algorithm, the shortest route between two
destinations is obtained. In the simulation, the students walk
along the established path. As shown in Figure 3, we use the
novel YOLO V5 object detection model and DeepSORT object
tracking algorithm to track the pedestrians, and then use the
estimated trajectory to calculate the speed of their movement
and the Hausdorff distance between them. The walking speed
of staffs and students in the natural state is approximately
normal distribution in the range of 0.926m/s to 1.586m/s. On
the premise of large enough space, the distance between two
strangers is often kept at 1.55m or more.
According to the infection status of one individual, students are divided into three categories: susceptible, latent, and
infected. We set a metric 𝑃_inf for the agent to calculate
the probability that it may be infected, which can determine

the infection status. Within a certain range, if the distance
between two individuals the threshold 𝑇 (𝑇 = 1), it means
that the individual is in an infected state at the moment,
and the infection state has changed from susceptible state to
the latent one. After 7 days, people in the incubation period
will be transformed into confirmed patients. According to
the transmission characteristics of the novel coronavirus, all
students in school are likely to be infected with the virus, and
individuals are infectious during the incubation period and
the onset period. According to the latest research, the basic
reproduction number R0 is as high as 5.7. This means that it
is extremely disseminated and infectious where individuals in
latent state and infected state are infectious [26].
In order to simulate the spread of the virus more realistically, the general state, movement state, access state, infection
state and other attributes are added to each agent, as shown in
Table 2.
B. Agent-based novel coronavirus infection modeling
The infection distance is one of the most important factors in
constructing a population infection model. According to [27]
and our previous estimated result, the virus carrier can affect
other individuals less than 2𝑚 away from it. Meanwhile, the
number of days the virus is carried in the human body also
have a vital impact on the spread of the virus. It is reported
that the incubation period of COVID-19 is generally 3 to 22
days, and the experiment is set to 7 days [28]. During the
incubation period, virus are also contagious. We consider that
as the number of days when the human body carry the virus
increases, the infectivity increases linearly. The influence of

the number of days when a carrier carries the virus on the
infectivity of the virus is calculated by the formula (1):


𝑓 𝑖 𝑑𝑎𝑦 = min(𝑖 𝑑𝑎𝑦 /𝐼 𝑝𝑒𝑟 , 1
(1)
where 𝑖 𝑑𝑎𝑦 indicates the days when the human carry the virus;
𝐼 𝑝𝑒𝑟 = 7 means that the incubation period is 7 days, and
the infectious performance increases linearly along with the
increase of the number of days the virus incubates in the
human body. When the virus is carried for 7 days or more,
the infectivity is no longer enhanced.
We consider the influence of the distance between the
individual and the person in the incubation period on the
spread of the virus. The influence of the physical distance
is expressed by formula (2):
 1 √
0 < 𝑑 <= 𝑅
𝑅2 − 𝑑 2
(2)
𝑓 (𝑑 𝑛 ) = 𝑅
0
𝑑>𝑅
where 𝑅 represents the radius of infection and the value is
set to 2𝑚. When The distance between two individuals 𝑑 <=
𝑅, the lager the distance, the smaller the probability of virus
transmission. When the distance 𝑑 among individuals exceeds
𝑅, the individual will not be infected by the virus.
Air humidity, temperature, inhaled air concentration, the
mutual distance between individuals and other factors may also
have different impacts on whether a susceptible person will be
infected with the virus [29]. The combination of these factors
from other individuals within the individual’s perception range
will cause an infection probability for the central individual.
Therefore, we use the mean field theory to calculate the
probability that an individual may be infected with the virus.
It comprehensively calculates the impact of all individuals,
which can greatly simplify the complexity of the calculation.
Specifically, we divide the number of days when patients
carry the virus into 8 time periods. They respectively indicate
that no virus carried, carrying the virus for 1 day, and carrying
the virus for 7 days or more. The formula of the individual
infection probability is as follows:
𝑁
7
∑︁

1 ∑︁ 𝑗
𝑃_inf =(1-𝛽)
𝑇𝑛 𝑓 𝑖 𝑑𝑎𝑦 𝑓 (𝑑 𝑛 )
𝑁
𝑖=0
𝑛=1

(3)

where 𝑁 means that there are 𝑁 other individuals in the
𝑗
perception range of central body; 𝑇𝑛 indicates that the 𝑛th
person carried the virus for 𝑗 days. The probability distribution
is obtained by dividing the
of people in each period
Í 𝑁number
𝑗
𝑇𝑛 indicates the proportion of
by the total number; 𝑁1 𝑛=1
people in each period; 𝑑 𝑛 represents the distance between two
individuals. 𝛽 represents the group protection rate. In other
word, the proportion of the number of people who take selfprotection in all groups.
One day is divided into different time slices, and the infection probability is continuously updated with the time slices.
During the simulation process, the simulation calculates the
infection rate of the first time slice, then calculate the infection
rate of the second time slice, and select the maximum. At the
end of the day, the random value will be driven by uniform
distribution. If the value is within the infection probability
interval, it means that he will be infected.

C. Simulation environment modeling
Generally speaking, colleges and universities usually occupy
a large area and the roads on the campus are intricate. To
meet and manage the daily activities of teachers and students
during the epidemic, they will be prohibited from entering and
leaving the campus at will. The campus will be divided into
different functional areas, and each area will have only one
entrance. The crowd is just allowed to enter and exit from
this port, in order to prevent the spread of viruses caused by
the random shuttle of teachers and students in the campus.
The buildings in the same functional area are combined as
a whole. The winding roads are closed and not passable, as
shown in Figure 4.
As shown in Figure 5, the road network can often be
represented by an undirected graph. The nodes in the figure
represent road points and intersections in the road network.
The line segment connected by two nodes in the figure
includes attributes such as length and width. These attributes
can describe the detailed information of each path in the map
and the topology information between the paths clearly. Under
epidemic control, students strictly abide by school regulations
and start from their location to their destination within the
permitted time. It is represented by a route in the figure, and
the route has no closed loop. Starting from the dormitory and
reaching the destination along the route, each moving student
has a specific route. Students in the same dormitory building
have the same starting point and separate at the roadside, and
all routes have no closed loop. In the process of students’
movement from dormitory building to other areas, the starting
point is taken as the root node, the midway road node is taken
as the child node, and the destination is taken as the leaf node.

A multi-branch tree with the dormitory building as the root
node will be formed, as shown in Figure 6.
The multi-branch tree can be used to record the topology
of each required road segment, and the attribute information
of the road segment is described by the node attributes. The
𝐿𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑡ℎ attribute in Table 3 not only includes the length of
the path itself, but also the distance from the root node to
this one. For example, the distance from a node to its parent
is 5.1𝑚, and the distance to its root node is 56.55𝑚. The
𝑊 𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡 attribute is a sequence, which contains the time when
the crowd passes this road node and the corresponding number
of the crowd, taking the weight attribute <300,600,0.05> as
an example, it means that about 5% of the total number of
students will pass through this node between 300𝑠 and 600𝑠.
The time interval of passing through the node by the
crowd is inversely proportional to the width of the road.
According to the weight attribute, the crowd density of any
road node can be estimated at one certain moment. The time
the crowd passes through the road node can be expressed by
the following formula:
𝑡𝑖 (𝑠𝑡 𝑎𝑟 𝑡) = 𝑙𝑖,𝑡 𝑎𝑡 𝑎𝑙 /𝑣 𝑚𝑎𝑥
𝑡𝑖 (𝑒𝑛𝑑) = 𝑙 𝑖,𝑡 𝑎𝑡 𝑎𝑙 /𝑣 𝑚𝑖𝑛
Δ𝑡𝑖0 = 𝑡 𝑖 (𝑒𝑛𝑑) − 𝑡𝑖 (𝑠𝑡 𝑎𝑟 𝑡)

(4)

where 𝑡 𝑖 (𝑠𝑡 𝑎𝑟 𝑡) indicates the starting time for the crowd to reach
the 𝑖 road node, which is proportional to the distance from the
node to the root; 𝑡𝑖 (𝑒𝑛𝑑) indicates the last time for the crowd
to reach the 𝑖 road node; 𝑙𝑖,𝑡 𝑎𝑡 𝑎𝑙 is the total distance from the
starting point to node 𝑖; 𝑣 𝑚𝑎𝑥 and 𝑣 𝑚𝑖𝑛 respectively represent
the maximum and minimum speed of the crowd; Δ𝑡 𝑖0 indicates
the difference between the earliest and latest time when the
flow of people passes the path node.

6

D. Crowd simulation and control
1) Crowd simulation: Students depart from the dormitory
and go to the target functional area in turn, and return to
the dormitory after completing the visit. Under quarantine
conditions, infected and suspected infected persons need to
go to the school hospital for testing and isolation. Each agent
is only allowed to move along a given road to the destination
at the permitted time, and the rest of the time is not allowed to
walk around. Individuals may be infected inside dormitories,
classes, restaurants, roads and so on.
2) Crowd control: According to the characteristics of
virus transmission, three control measures have been formulated from the perspectives of reducing population density
and improving self-protection, such as batch travel (reduce
aggregation by reducing the number of travelers at the same
time), staggered travel (reduce road congestion by controlling
travel time), and isolation prevention (keep suspected patients
away from the crowd). Based on the experimental simulation
results, we analyze the impact of different measures on the
results of the virus transmission.
IV. E XPERIMENT
The experiment is based on 𝐶𝑃𝑈 3.60𝐺𝐻𝑧, 8𝐺 𝐵 memory,
and Windows 10 operating system environment. We implement the simulation in C++ based on PEDSIM 𝑃𝐸 𝐷𝑆𝐼 𝑀
[30] platform. The system allows users to set parameters by
themselves to calculate the infection curve, such as the initial
total population, the initial number of patients and simulation
step, etc.
Since there is no large-scale outbreak of novel coronavirus
in universities around the world at present, the real infection
data on university campuse dose not exist. We use the real
reported data of Diamond Princess in Japan to conduct the
simulation. The reason why we use this case is as following: First, both Zhengzhou University and Diamond Princess
Cruise are closed environment. Second, they have similar
categories of population. In university, the population consists
of staffs and students. For Diamond Princess, it mainly has
crews and passengers. They all move on foot at similar speeds.
Third, their daily activities are similar. They perform activities
in the closed environment according to the specific schedule.
For example, students need to attend class in their daily work,
so their daily route is the dormitory and teaching building. The
passengers form Diamond Princess live in their own rooms, but
they have the chance to walk around on the board. Although
the population size are not the same between the university and
the cruise, it does not affect the trend of virus transmission. By
comparing with the infection data curve of Diamond Princess,
our simulation model can be verified reasonablely.
We scale the number of teachers and students in Zhengzhou
University proportionally. Assuming that there is already an
infected patient on the campus on the first day. According to
the infection situation of the groups in different periods, the
approximate infection number and infection rates of all teachers and students on the campus is inferred. In the simulation,
each agent is only allowed to move along the established road
to a specific place at the specified time, and the rest of the

Fig. 7. Sample scene of the second upper deck and the sixth sun deck of
Diamond Princess.

time is not allowed to move around at will. Individuals may be
infected in dormitories, classrooms, restaurants, and roads. The
number of infections at the end of each day is obtained through
the infection model, and corresponding control measures are
implemented according to the results to reduce the infection
rate. In order to prevent accidental errors in the experiment, the
following experimental results are obtained through multiple
averages.
A. Model validation
Since COVID-19 did not happen in Zhengzhou University,
in order to verify our proposed model, the similar case
of Diamond Princess Cruise is involved in our experiment.
Although there are differences between cruise and university
campus, they are essentially closed environment world. The
cruise is 290 meters long and 37.5 meters wide, with 18 deck
floors and a total area of about 200, 000 square meters. During
the outbreak of COVID-19, there were 3,711 members on the
Diamond Princess. The first case of coronavirus on the cruise
was on Feb. 1st. A few days later, the cruise was ordered
by the Japanese government to quarantine, and no one was
allowed to leave the ship. The Diamond Princess is a special
and typical infectious disease sample in the global COVID-19.
It is also known as a highly infectious experimental model of
COVID-19.
The scene modeling of the Diamond Princess deck is shown
in Figure 7. In the experiment, passengers in public areas such
as decks and restaurants can walk freely, and they are allowed
to change floors to enter other spaces within a specified time.
During most of the time, passengers can go to the designated
room for leisure and entertainment. At this time, the overall
protection rate (𝛽) is 0. Our results are shown by green curve
in Figure 8. We use the reported infection data of Princess
Diamond as the reference to validate our method. it is shown
in the red curve in Figure 8; Orazio et al. [31] also use
agent-based model to simulate the Diamond Princess, who
mainly classify the infection status of agents in detail, and
their results are shown in the blue curve in Figure 8. By
comparing the infection curve obtained from the average data
of our experiments with the other approach, the results show
that our simulation model is effective.
B. Population size
When the total number of people changes, the probability
of individual contact with each other, movement trends and

7

Fig. 9.

other factors will change, which will have different impacts
on the spread and infection of the virus. The population on
campus is scaled to different proportions. The initial number
of people is set to 840, 1260, 1680, and 2520 respectively, and
the population infection situation within 15 days is calculated
through the model.
The results in Figure 9 show that the larger the total number
of people on campus, the more people will eventually be
infected, and the larger the proportion of the total population
will be. If there are no restrictions the number of infected
people will increase significantly over time. However, this
trend is not exactly proportional. When the campus population
density is too small, the total number of populations should
be appropriately increased, and the infection rate will rise
relatively slowly; when the population density is large, the
infection rate will also increase significantly as the total
population increases.
Figure 10 shows the proportion of the number of people
in each state per day when the total number of simulated
populations is 1680. The B-lurker curve shows the change
of the number of patients in the incubation period; the Binfected curve shows the change of the number of patients with
confirmed infections; The berfore control curve represents the
change of the total number of diagnosed and latent persons
each day. It can be seen that the curve grows slowly at the
beginning, and then breaks out. Almost everyone is infected on
the 21st day. Based on this, after students return to school, it
is necessary to take corresponding protective control measures

to reduce the impact of the virus.
C. Control measures
1) Batch travel measures: From the perspective of time
and space, we formulate intervention measures to reduce the
risk of transmission. The first control is to make students
travel staggered. Since teachers and students have basically
the same activity areas on campus, there will often be a
large number of people gathering in some areas. Therefore,
we should reduce the occurrence of such phenomena and
avoid large crowd gathering. Classes are commonly the main
component of the daily life for the college group, so first
of all, according to the individual attributes, the class time
is replanned for the students with course tasks. 50% of the
teachers and students with course tasks are arranged to have
classes every morning, and the other half of the students are
arranged in the afternoon. In class time, individuals are only
allowed to stay in the dormitory when they have no class tasks,
and all individuals are not allowed to move around the campus
at will. Planning student travel in batches in this way can
greatly reduce the degree of crowd density in most cases. For
example, by reducing the number of people and expanding the
physical space between students during class, it can reduce the
crowdedness of students.
Figure 11 shows the comparison of the infection results of
the population before and after the implementation of batch
control. The D-lurker curve represents the change curve of the

8

number of lurking people per day after the implementation of
batch control; The D-infected curve represents the number of
people diagnosed every day after the implementation of batch
control; Decrease control measures represents the total number
of infections per day after the implementation of batch control.
It is found that the upward trend of the curve is relatively flat,
and the final total number of infections is reduced by about half
compared with the total number of infections before control.
The effect of post-implementation measures is in line with
expectations, and the spread of the virus can be suppressed to
a certain extent.
2) Staggered travel measures: In the last section, we divide
the crowd into two groups by replanning the class time,
which avoided crowd contact to a certain extent. However,
the university group is huge, under the same batch, students
in the same dormitory building will still experience congestion
on the road. In addition to classes, the restaurant is also a highdensity place of crowed gathering . In meal time, the students
will flock to the restaurant. The crowd is very dense on the
way to the restaurant and after arriving in the restaurant.
According to the initial location and the destination of each
student, we calculate the specific travel time of the students in
different dormitories. For example, when students move from
the dormitory area to other areas of the school, a dormitory
building determines the travel time according to the location
between itself and other buildings and the path selected by the
students. By controlling the travel time in different buildings,
the road utilization at a certain moment can be reduced.
Through our algorithm, we can easily calculate the reasonable
departure time of the groups in each building area, reducing
the mutual contact between the groups.
Students are distributed in various dormitory buildings, and
teaching areas are also distributed in different areas of the
campus. Campus under epidemic control, multiple multitrees
are constructed according to the route of all students according
to their starting point. If two or more multitrees contain the
same road node and the time overlaps, it means that the two
paths may collide with pedestrian flows. It need to stagger a
little time, and adjust the departure time offset Δ𝑡 to reduce
conflicts. If multiple groups pass the same node on different
path trees, there is no overlap in the elapsed time, it is not
considered crowds collide.
If the road node 𝑖 appears at the same time in different
paths and the passing time overlaps, we calculate the road
congestion with the following formula:

where 𝑛 represents the total number of road nodes in the map;

of people; 𝜔𝑖 𝑗 indicates the weight of the flow of people from
0
the 𝑗th starting place passing through the 𝑖th road node; Δ𝑡 𝑖 𝑗
represents the time interval for the flow of people from the 𝑗th
departure place to pass through the 𝑖th road node. The offset
time of each departure place is adjusted to the minimum value,

In the experiment, the students are evenly distributed in 5 dormitory buildings. Students start from the dormitory building
to other functional areas of the campus, and they are required
to meet the constraints, that is, max (𝑡𝑖 ) ≤ 20𝑚𝑖𝑛. More
ideal results can be obtained through brute force traversal and
integer planning. The results of the starting time for classes in
different locations are shown in Table 4.
After class, students start from their own building to their
dormitories. According to the distribution of students, the class
time is divided into three groups: teaching building, library,
others (experimental building, administrative building). The
result of the preparation time to get out of class dismissal
are shown in Table 5.
The heat maps in Figure 12 show the crowd density under
different conditions on the path. We take Figure 12(a) as
an example in the map. Figure 12(b) means that there are
three groups of people from different locations moving in the
same direction at the same time. Figure 12(c) represents the
density of people on each path that is not controlled. It can
be seen that when pedestrians on multiple paths move toward
the same destination at the same time, there will be a high
density of people. Figure 12(d) shows that by adjusting the
travel time, the figure enables students to implement nonintersection travel measures, which can effectively reduce the
crowd density on the road.
As shown in Figure 13, T-control represents the change
curve of the total number of persons in the incubation period
and infected persons every day after the implementation of
staggered travel control measures. It can be seen that the
increasing trend is slow compared with the other two red
curves. By implementing control measures to reduce population density, the probability of virus transmission can be
further reduced.
3) Isolation control measures: The traditional method of interviewing infected people to track contacts is not so effective.
We use contact tracking method to find infected people in [32].

On campus, smart phones have almost become the necessary
supplies for college students. It is advisable for teachers and
students on campus to install contact tracking applications by
using smart phones to realize contact tracking. It is a good
way to track (and then isolate) individuals who have been in
close contact with infected patients before symptoms appear.
Because of the transmissibility of the virus, once a confirmed
patient is found, the person should be isolated immediately
[33]. Taking the compulsory measures can prevent the spread
of the virus completely. If one confirmed patient is found
on the campus, the student will be immediately sent to the
school hospital for closed isolation. By tracing the track of
the student, those who have been in close contact with him
are regarded as suspected cases and sent to the school hospital
for isolation and observation too as in [34].
However, since some virus carriers may still have no
obvious symptoms of infection after the incubation period,
that is, asymptomatic patients, such patients need to rely on
medical methods to determine their physical health, which
means the difficulty of epidemic investigation and control is
further increased. Three sets of experiments show the changes
in infection when there are asymptomatic patients.
The results are shown in Figure 14, the blue curve is the

trend of the infection rate with the virus on the first day and
being isolated and treated after 7 days of infection; The green
curve shows the trend of the infection rate of the population
when one person is infected on the first day and can be isolated
in time; The red curve represents the daily infection trend
when one person infected with the virus on the first day and
all patients will have a probability of 0.1 as asymptomatic
infections. The appearance of asymptomatic patients will make
the condition complicate. Only by detecting all virus carriers
can it be possible to completely control the spread of the virus,
otherwise the virus will still spread on a large scale.
As shown in Figure 15, the three curves of I-lurker, Iinfected, and isolate control respectively represent the changing trends of the number of suspected cases, the number of
confirmed persons, and the total number of infections after the
implementation of mandatory isolation measures. The number
of infected people each day after the quarantine measures is
less than that before the implementation of the quarantine
measures, and the total number of people infected on the 21st
day is only 24%. Compared with the control measures in the
previous two sections, it is proved that the implementation of
isolation measures can more effectively reduce the probability
of people infected with the virus. Isolation control measures
can effectively reduce the spread rate of the virus, but it does
not completely contain the virus. The reason may be that
individuals are infected by the virus in the moving on the
road, but the person of infected are not captured accurately.

10

universities take self-protection measures, the green curve
shows that the virus infection rate is 82%. The result is much
higher than that under the same conditions where the number
of people taking protective measures reaches 70% and above.
The more people who take protective measures, the lower the
infection rate. From the overall experimental results, it can
be inferred that if everyone takes protective measures, the
infection rate will be lower than that in the case of a selfprotection rate of 90%. Therefore, universities should actively
call on all teachers and students to protect themselves in order
to better control the spread of the virus.
V. C ONCLUSION
Fig. 16. Comparison of measures without control, batching, staggered travel,
and isolation control measures.

Fig. 17.

Infection curve of self-protection rate.

As shown in Figure 16, experimental results show that in a
high-density and closed area similar to colleges and universities, if one person is infected with the virus, there will be a
high probability of infection to others, even if control measures
are implemented. After implementing compulsory isolation
measures, timely isolation and treatment of suspicious patients
will further slow down the spread of the virus, but over time,
it is still difficult to achieve zero spread of the virus.
D. Proportion of self-protection population
Since the strong transmission of the novel coronavirus, some
people have high awareness of protection. Due to individual
differences, the infection probability of each person is not
exactly the same. In addition to the protection measures
implemented by universities on teachers and students, individuals also need strengthen self-protection. For example, take
some self-protection measures such as wearing a mask and
consciously keeping a distance from others. After the group
adopts protective measures, the spread of the virus will be
reduced, and the group infection rate will also decrease.
Figure 17 shows the impact of the self-protection rate of
different groups in universities on the virus infection rate
in within 21 days. The green, red, blue, and yellow curves
represent the daily viral infection rate of the population when
the population protection rate is 60%, 70%, 80%, and 90%.
On the 21st day, when 60% of the people in colleges and

In response to the outbreak of COVID-19, the government
has implemented a series of measures to prevent a large
number of people from gathering and aggravate the epidemic.
Taking the problem of virus transmission after students return
back to school as an example, we propose a Campus Virus Infection and Control Simulation (CVICS) model that is oriented
to a closed environment, frequent population contact, and
strong mobility. By constructing an agent-based simulation,
and taking into account the differences among individuals, we
introduce the mean field theory to micro-simulate the infection situation of each individual every day. The experimental
results show that our model can calculate the daily population
infection trend and individual infection status, and through
batch travel, staggered travel, isolation and other effective and
efficient control measures, it can reduce the probability of
population infection and curb the rapid spread of the virus
to relatively low level. During the epidemic, a series of tough
measures should be taken to reduce crowd gathering. Once
suspected patients are found, compulsory measures should be
taken to isolate them under medical observation. When the
isolation is strong, the source of infection is blocked, and
the spread of novel coronavirus will be better controlled. As
individuals, we should try our best to avoid crowd gathering,
reduce crowd contact, and enhance self-protection.
In the future, we will consider bicycle, car and other factors
in the simulation to improve simulation entitis. The medical
domain model will be added to the infection model to enhance
the scientificity of the data. Not only should we consider
these existing control measures, but also resource allocation
needs to be considered, such as adding disinfection and
vaccine measures, to further improve the virus infection model
accuracy. The improved model should be able to simulate more
complex crowd flow in large-scale areas, and fit real infection
data as much as possible.
