Abstract. A compartmental epidemic model based on genetic fitting algorithm
and a cross-validation method to overcome the overfitting problem are proposed.
This generic enhanced SEIR model allows to estimate approximate nowcast
and forecast of epidemic evolution including key epidemic parameters and nonmeasurable asymptomatic infected portion of the susceptible population. The
model is used to study COVID-19 outbreak dynamics in Algeria between February
25th and May 24th. The Basic reproduction number is estimated to 3.78 (95%
CI 3.033-4.53) and effective reproduction number on May 24th after three months
of the outbreak is estimated to 0.651 (95% CI 0.539-0.761). The Infections peak
time is predicted to the end of April while active cases peak time is predicted
to the end of May 2020. The disease incidence, CFR and IFR are calculated.
Information provided by this study could help establish a realistic assessment of
the situation in Algeria for the time being, inform predictions about potential
future evolution, and guide the design of appropriate public health measures.

Keywords: COVID-19; mathematical modeling; genetic algorithm; cross-validation;

1. Introduction
The recent outbreak of the highly infectious COVID19 disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan and other
cities in China in 2019 has become a global pandemic
since the first quarter of 2020 as declared by the World
Health Organization (WHO). SARS-CoV-2 was first
imported to Algeria on Feb. 17th, 2020 by an Italian
national who has been confirmed positive to COVID19 on Feb. 25th [1]. The Italian man has been
repatriated via a special flight on Feb. 28th and no
contaminated individuals by this first confirmed case
have been reported by the Algerian official authorities
[2]. As far as we know, the effective outbreak of
COVID-19 in Algeria started late Feb. 2020. Indeed,
the Algerian Health Ministry (AHM) reported in a
statement on March 2nd the two first confirmed cases
of COVID-19 in Blida province south of the capital
Algiers [3]. Since then the spread of the virus in Algeria
has gone through different epidemic phases [4].
Besides medical and biological research [5, 6],
theoretical studies based on either statistics or
mathematical modeling may also play a key role
in understanding the epidemic characteristics of the
outbreak. Epidemic modeling represents a crucial
tool in forecasting the inflection point and ending
time and provides insights into the epidemiological
situation. Such analysis can predict the potential
future evolution, help estimate the efficiency of already
taken measures, and guide the design of alternative
interventions [7, 8, 9, 10]. To the best of our knowledge,
few theoretical studies on COVID-19 outbreak in
Algeria have so far been achieved [11, 12]. The
lack of theoretical and clinical publicly accessible
studies about SARS-CoV-2 spread in Algeria exposing
the actual situation and analyzing possible evolution
scenarios is making the situation more confusing for
the Algerian public and scientific community. A lot
of studies on COVID-19 specifications and dynamics
around the world are published every day, some of
which include the Algerian case [13, 14]. However,
we believe that any analysis of COVID-19 outbreak in
Algeria should take into consideration many specific
aspects that are not considered in such universal
studies and online-simulators which use raw data
accessible on many databases. Beyond the fact that
the majority of those databases contain many wrong
reported data for Algeria, data nomenclature and
interpretation, as well as test methods proper to every
country should be taken into consideration for more
accurate outcomes. In our analysis instead of relying
only on official Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase
Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) confirmed SARS-CoV-2
infection cases, which are strongly affected by limited
test capacities, we rather combine them with the
official number of hospital admitted patients due to

SARS-CoV-2 infection in order to deduce the effective
number of new confirmed infection per day. This
choice makes a significant difference not only on the
cumulative number of confirmed cases but also on the
nowcast and forecast of the virus spread.
The paper is organized as follows: in the next
section we present the mathematical model we use
for the dynamical modeling of COVID-19 propagation
and some results of the model with reference to the
pandemic spread in some specific countries. The third
section will be devoted to the application of the model
on the Algerian case through the estimation of key
epidemic parameters and a forecast analysis. Results
will be shown and discussed in the fourth section. The
concluding section will include some ideas about future
developments of this work.
2. Model and Methods
At the very beginning of the epidemic, during the
free spread phase, it is common to assume an
initial exponential-growth, which is characteristic of
most human infectious diseases [15, 16]. However,
spontaneous herd immunity, protections and lockdown
measures will confront the geometrical evolution. A
dynamical model is then required to describe the
evolution of the disease.
2.1. Compartmental SEIQRDP model
The compartmental classical Susceptible Exposed
Infectious Recovered (SEIR) model [15, 17] has been
the most widely adopted model for characterizing
many historical propagating infectious diseases such as
the Spanish flu [18]. SEIR model is extensively used
to study the COVID-19 pandemic in China and many
other countries with variations best suiting the subject
region and time period [19, 20, 21].
Regarding the novelty of the time course of
infection shown by the disease and the required
protection measures, to simulate COVID-19 spread
we use a SEIQRDP model in which at time t the
population is split into compartments that represent
the different stages of a disease [20, 22]. S(t) represents
the susceptible portion of the population i.e. those
yet to be infected. P (t) represents the effectively
protected population, mainly individuals who tend
to strictly follow the standard advised protection
measures such as wearing masks, physical distancing
... etc. Hence, this part of the population is considered
as not susceptible to be infected. Introducing this
compartment is crucial to reflect increasing awareness
within the major part of the population as the
pandemic evolves and allows to take into consideration
the control measures taken by authorities to fight
against the pandemic such as closing public areas,

3
suspending public transportation and lockdown. E(t)
represents a latent state in which individuals have been
exposed to the disease but are not yet infectious, i.e.
the individuals in this stage have the virus but cannot
infect others whereas I(t) represents those that are
currently infectious. The asymptomatic exposed and
infectious portion of the population are not detectable
and hence non-measurable. The proportion of this part
of the population can only be revealed by theoretical
modeling of the disease. Q(t) represents quarantined
individuals considered as active cases, R(t) represents
individuals that have recovered from the disease and
supposed to no longer take part in the disease spread
and D(t) represents closed cases or deaths. N =
S(t) + E(t) + I(t) + Q(t) + R(t) + D(t) + P (t) is the
total population at time t considered constant at the
time scale of the epidemic evolution. The SEIQRDP
model represents the virus propagation by a set of
ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that associate
transition parameters to the mobility of individuals
between population compartments defined above:
Ṡ = −βS(t)I(t)/N − αS(t)
(1)
Ė = βS(t)I(t)/N − γE(t)
I˙ = γE(t) − δI(t)

(2)
(3)

Q̇ = δI(t) − λQ(t) − κQ(t)

(4)

Ṙ = λQ(t)

(5)

Ḋ = κQ(t)

(6)

Ṗ = αS(t)
(7)
where Ṡ refers to the time derivative of S. The positive
rate α called the protection rate, is introduced into
the model assuming that the susceptible population is
steadily decreasing as a result of increasing population
awareness and public health authorities actions [20].
All the other parameters depend on the evolution of the
epidemic, testing and health care capacities, and are
calculated based on the official daily confirmed cases,
deaths and recoveries numbers. The transmission
rate β represents the ability of an infected individual
infecting others (depending on the population density,
the toxicity of the virus etc . . . ) and βS (t) I (t) /N
is the incidence of the disease, i.e., the number of new
infected individuals yielding in unit time at time t [23].
γ −1 is the average latent time that an individual spends
incubating the virus to become infectious (infected but
not yet infectious) and δ −1 is the average infectiousness
time, i.e, time for an infectious individual to get
symptoms and get detected and quarantined. λ is the
cure rate and κ is the mortality rate while λ−1 and κ−1
represent respectively quarantine to recovery time and
quarantine to death time. These transition parameters
are used by the model to define a time-dependent
number of secondary cases generated by a primary
infectious individual Rt = βδ −1 S (t) /N known as the
effective reproduction number. It is a very important

parameter for the analysis of any epidemic outbreak
and provides a measure of the intensity of interventions
required to control the virus propagation. In general,
if Rt > 1, which mathematically corresponds to Ė +
I˙ > 0, the disease spreads epidemically and when
Rt < 1, the disease dies out. At the beginning of
the epidemic matching a situation of a completely
susceptible population, this quantity is known as the
basic reproduction number R0 = βδ −1 and obtained
by the next generation matrix method [24].
Even though many COVID-19 studies try to
calculate universal mean values of the reproduction
number and transition parameters in some specific
spots of the outbreak, they remain strongly related
to local data and could change from one country to
another and even from one region to another within the
same country. Such parameters are the kind of valuable
information this model could provide in addition to
approximate peak times of the disease (infection peak
time and active cases peak time) and approximate
numbers of the non-measurable asymptomatic cases,
active cases, and total quarantined, recoveries and
deaths cases. An a priori knowledge of those numbers,
though approximate, could help to optimize human
and material resources on the global and local scales of
a country. In this SEIQRDP model, key parameters
are extracted from official numbers of cumulative
confirmed cases, recoveries and deaths available at a
given period of the epidemic. The parameters obtained
either by direct calculation or by a fitting algorithm are
used to construct the variables curves that fit the initial
data. Those curves are then extrapolated to a longer
period, thus forecasting the evolution of the epidemic.
2.2. Fitting with a genetic algorithm
To calibrate our models parameters and fit the
real data originating from a specific region of
the world, many fitting methods are available,
most of which are widely used in epidemiological
studies and machine learning models. Single stage
problems such as calibrating the parameters of our
model are usually solved with modified deterministic
optimization methods such as the L-BFGS-B method
[25, 26]. However, a stochastic method would have
the benefit of taking into account the diversity of
the possible calibrations scenarios.
Evolutionary
genetic algorithms are one of those stochastic methods
that have a good reputation in solving optimization
problems. In the following section we will discuss
the advantages that the genetic algorithm method can
yield to our study.

4
Definition
A genetic algorithm (GA) is an optimization approach
inspired by Darwinian evolution in which an initial set
of candidate solutions called initial population, each
represented by a set of values making a genome, evolve
by breeding and reproducing while being subject to
random mutations [27]. The key mechanism in a
GA is that only the best performing solutions get to
reproduce and pass on their genes just as in Darwinian
natural selection. The evolution process is finally
stopped after a certain number of generations when
a defined stopping condition is met.
Application
In our case, applying a GA to find the best fitting for
the SEIQRD model parameters is a straightforward
application of the above definition; The genome is
the set of parameters itself and the breeding is the
process of creating a new set from two parent sets
by randomly selecting genes from either one of the
parents, and mutation is a random alteration of one
of the genes of the resulting new genome. The best
performing set of parameters is the one for which the
curves produced by the model match the best the
original data. This is measured by a normalized least
squares method. We can speed up the process by
constraining the randomly generated initial population
to be somewhat around already published values for
COVID-19 epidemic parameters [28]. Different runs
of the GA give slightly different solutions. From these
solutions, an error on the prediction made by the model
can be computed.
The overfitting problem
Since finding the correct SEIQRDP parameters for an
epidemic is essentially a curve fitting problem, the
predictive effectiveness of the model can considerably
be reduced if we underfit or overfit the available
real data, which we will call training data. If the
training data is underfitted, the model could simply
diverge or give overestimated numbers with very large
variance. On the opposite, if the data is overfitted,
the predictive curves produced by the model will be
strongly influenced by the given training data and will
have very low variance. Thus, artificially reducing
the error on the predicted numbers and eventually
leading to a non-realistic forecast. Overfitting remains
a major problem with epidemic dynamical models
[29]. In many of them overfitting occurs because
so many parameters can fluctuate over their range
of uncertainty that their fitted values can become
excessively influenced by noise in the original data
[30]. Therefore, restrictions have been applied to
some epidemic analysis including COVID-19 outbreak

in order to diminish the number of free parameters
and avoid overfitting affecting the pertinence of those
studies [20]. To overcome this issue, we cut off the
fitting process after a number of generations which is
large enough to actually fit the training data and small
enough to not go beyond overfitting limits. We will
call this number the optimum generation number Gopt
and we compute it using data from a given province or
country passing through a two-samples cross-validation
procedure. Thus, Gopt corresponds to the fitting depth
that ensures the well balance between underfitting and
overfitting in our model.
Computation of the optimum generation number
Cross-validation is a procedure where an original
training set is split into training and validation subsets,
and where the model is trained on the first subset
and tested for the second one [31]. In our case, the
original training set is the whole available data on the
COVID-19 epidemic for a given country or region for
n days. This data is then split into a training subset
containing the data of the first n − v days, and a
validation subset of the last v days. The ratio v/n
depends on the number of adjustable parameters in
the regression problem [32]. This ratio is around 1/4
for the SEIQRDP model.
To determine Gopt , we run our genetic algorithm
for fitting with the training subset.
After each
generation we measure the fitness of the best solution
with the validation set. The expected result of this
process is a bad fitness for very low generations
number G, which gets better with every new generation
until we start overfitting the training subset (high G)
resulting in a worse fitness. The value of G ≡ Gopt
for which the fitness on the validation set is the best is
chosen as the stopping point for the genetic algorithm
when applied for predictive purposes.
2.3. Computational tools
In order to allow the readers to take advantage of
the fitting algorithm and the cross-validation method
presented in this study for other epidemic cases, a
tailored set of Python programs developed by the
authors have been gathered in a Python package
and made accessible online with all the necessary
instructions for installation and efficient use [33].
This package is adapted for parallel computation
and includes tools to: download data from online
repositories, determine the optimum fitting depth for a
given city, region or country using the cross-validation
method, calibrate the SEIQRDP model by fitting the
real data with the genetic algorithm, and solve the
system of ODEs to produce the forecast. Hence, our
generic programs might be easily applied to study

determination R2 > 0.9.

any outbreak for which a compartmental analysis is
adequate in any region of the world provided that a
sufficient amount of epidemic data is available.
2.4. Model validation
Provided reasonably accurate data, our model successfully reproduces the evolution of COVID-19 in different
spots worldwide for which a sufficient amount of data
is available. In this section we present the results obtained using the SEIQRDP model to estimate the active cases evolution in Italy, Spain, Germany and South
Korea. For those countries we use publicly available
confirmed cases, recoveries and deaths numbers from
online raw data sets [34, 35]. We pick training data
starting from the date for which all confirmed cases,
recoveries and deaths numbers take non-zero values to
avoid computational bugs and optimize parameters fit-

ting. The active cases curve is then reproduced for 6
months following that date. In order to highlight the
efficiency of the model we use only an early part of
the official data to train the model instead of all the
available data. We have used 30 days training data for
Italy, 45 days for Spain, 60 days for Germany and 90
days for South Korea. Fig.3a shows that the results
obtained using SEIRQDP are in very good accordance
with official statistics for the number of active cases
in those countries. All the fittings have a coefficient
of determination R2 > 0.9 and as our fitting method
is based on a non-linear regression algorithm, we use a
normalized standard error SN of the estimate to evaluate the goodness of the fits. We remind that in order to
avoid overfitting the training data and obtain the best
forecast, we look for the optimum fitting corresponding to Gopt rather than the best one. For Italy, the
model is able to reproduce to a good approximation

of training data. Fig.1 reveals that the larger is the
training data sample the lower is the optimum number
of generations Gopt used by the genetic algorithm to
fit the data with a lower SN . The active cases curve is
one of the most pertinent in our opinion as it reflects
the amplitude of the epidemic outbreak as well as the
efficiency of the measures applied to control it. Moreover, the epidemic will end only if all the active cases
are closed. Germany and South Korea are very special cases and need profound analysis that is beyond
the scope of this paper, but one can clearly observe
the quicker decrease in their active cases after the epidemic peak time due to particular strategies to control
the epidemic.
3. Model estimation for Algeria
3.1. Data
For COVID-19 dynamics study in Algeria, we use
official public data provided by the AHM [36, 37]. Our
analysis specificity, that we believe makes its predictive
results for Algeria more accurate than different studies
in which Algeria is presented as an example [13], is the
fact that instead of relying on official numbers of RTPCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection cases, which
are strongly affected by limited test capacities, we
deduce the effective number of confirmed infections per
day by considering the number of hospital admitted
patients.
This number is considered as the effective number
of active cases in our study. The effective confirmed

cases number for a given date is then deduced by
adding computed tomography (CT) scans confirmed
cases to the official RT-PCR confirmed cases (see
Appendix A).
3.2. Epidemic parameters
Besides the more exciting forecasting use of the
SEIRQDP model, this latter is particularly efficient for
nowcasting. Indeed, fitting the official data allows us
to estimate key epidemic parameters of the early stage
spread of COVID-19 in Algeria. Even though hundreds
of studies are estimating those parameters for COVID19 in different spots of the world, a local estimation is
of major importance as their values are strongly related
to local population discipline, public health capacities
and severity of local containment measures at the very
beginning and during the epidemic period.
During one month after the first confirmed case
of COVID-19 in Algeria on Feb. 25th, the disease
has undergone a practically free propagation phase.
On March 12th universities, schools and nurseries
were closed.
On March 19th, all trips between
Algeria and European countries have been canceled by
Algerian authorities who have decided the first strong
containment measures against COVID-19 spread on
March 24th. A total lockdown of Blida province
and partial lockdown in many other provinces have
been applied. Coffee shops, restaurants and all nonessential shops have been closed, public transportation
suspended and grouping of more than two persons
forbidden. On April 24th, the authorities decided a

partial release of lockdown measures in Blida and other
provinces and allowed many commercial activities to
resume. This date coincided with the starting of the
holy month of Ramadan resulting in a brutal increase
of social and commercial activities. Due to low respect
of physical distancing and protection measures the
number of new confirmed cases increased significantly
and shops have been closed again in many provinces
since May 7th. In the light of this chronology of
measures we have estimated intermediate mean values
of the epidemic parameters during the free-propagation
phase (Feb. 25th - Mar. 25th) and then every
two-weeks intermediate period till May 24th. Those
intermediate mean values exposed in Fig.2 provide
valuable information revealing the evolution of the
epidemic in Algeria during its three first months and
the impact of the applied control measures.

3.3. Forecast
In order to forecast the evolution of the COVID-19
in Algeria we apply the SEIRQDP with a training
data period from Feb. 25th to May 24th. The crossvalidation method script is applied on the first 70 days
of the data set and tested on the 20 remaining to
calculate the optimum number of generations. For
the chosen set of data, we obtain Gopt = 20. Then,
the genetic algorithm and the rest of SEIQRDP set
of programs are applied on the whole training data to
calculate the optimum fit and reproduce the SEIQRDP
variables curves using the fit parameters obtained. We
present in this paper a forecast of COVID-19 outbreak
dynamics until the end of September 2020, time for
which the reopening of schools and universities is
scheduled. That step would represent a crucial period
in the disease evolution and will require a specific
analysis in due course.

Table 1: Summary of SEIQRDP parameters estimates for COVID-19 in Algeria compared to Wuhan (China). R0 is estimated on
Feb. 25th while the mean values of the other parameters are calculated for the three first months of the outbreak in Algeria.

4. Results and Discussion
Our model estimates that on Feb. 25th, in addition
to the first confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infected case in
Algeria at least 7 other individuals have been infected
without showing any symptoms. On March 2nd when
the two first cases have been confirmed at Blida, we
estimate that the number of asymptomatic infectious
people has already reached 10 individuals and at least
10 others have been in a latent period. One week
later the number of asymptomatic infected persons
have already exceeded 70 following our estimations.
Officially, 20 of them have been confirmed at that time.
Epidemic parameters model estimates for the
first three months of COVID-19 in Algeria are in a
good agreement with on-the-ground evolution of the
outbreak. The estimated basic reproduction number
on Feb. 25th is R0 = 3.78 (95% CI 3.033-4.53)
while the value of Rt on May 24th is estimated to
0.651 (95% CI 0.539-0.761) and the mean effective
reproduction number during the first three months of
the epidemic is evaluated to 1.74 (95% CI 1.55-1.92).
The notable decline in Rt during this period might
reflect outbreak control efforts and growing awareness
of SARS-CoV-2. By the same token, we distinguish a
significant rise of the protection rate α after the first
control measures on March 24th jumping from 0.0041
during the free propagation phase before March 25th
to 0.0089 on the period of March 26th - April 10th
and doubling again to 0.021 on the next period (see
Fig.2 upper-left corner). Interestingly, the protection
rate curve reflects the release of containment and a
lower respect of protection measures in the period
between April 27th and May 12th resulting in a decline
of α during the next period. The protection rate
mean value of the overall study period is estimated
to 0.015 (95% CI 0.014-0.017). The increase of the
transmission rate shown on Fig.2 lower-left corner is
reasonable due to the continuous propagation of the
virus and the apparition of many clusters in dense
population provinces. In addition, the low number of
daily tests and the relatively long test-to-result time
of the used testing technology increase the probability
that an asymptotic infectious individual spread the

virus before being quarantined. The transmission
rate mean value is estimated to 0.64 (95% CI 0.620.66). The mean latent time is evaluated to 2.7
(95% CI 2.6-2.8) days and the mean infectious time
is predicted to 5.9 (95% CI 5.7-6.1) days. The mean
incubation time (latent time + infectiousness time)
has a mean value of 8.6 (95% CI 8.3-8.9) days. One
remarkable point that can be observed on Fig.2 middle
panel is that besides the first period, the incubation
time remains relatively stable taking values within the
range [7.9-8.6] days. This reflects the fact that the
model effectively calibrates the global features of the
evolution of hidden variables representing the exposed
E (t) and infectious I (t) portions of the population
which are not measurable.
The decrease of the
incubation time after the first period of the study
might be a consequence of a better detection scheme.
In fact, a high diagnosis capacity allowing large scale
testing strategy and efficient tracking are essential
tools to reduce the onset to quarantine (incubation)
period since early and quick detection of infectious
individuals enables authorities to quarantine them
before showing symptoms, hence limiting the number
of their contacts. Moreover, this will help diminish
the effective reproduction number Rt and then better
control the disease spread.
In contrast to other epidemic parameters, recovery
and fatality rates shown on the right panel of Fig.2
are directly calculated from official data. The recovery
rate varies in the range [1.1% - 2.7%] with a mean
value of 1.9% and the fatality rate, initially estimated
as the highest in the world at the time, fell below 0.5%
since mid-April with a mean value estimated to 1.02%.
The significant decrease of fatality rate, even though
affected by the growing test capacities after the number
of RT-PCR daily tests have been increased and the CTscan diagnostic of COVID-19 adopted in the beginning
of April, could also be interpreted as the consequence
of better medical care. The fatality rate seems to
stabilize during the last month of the study (0.071% on
April 27th - May 12th and 0.058% on May 13th - May
24th) as newly deployed RT-PCR test capacities are
reaching again their limits. The epidemic analysis of

9
the parameters values is beyond the scope of this paper
as it requires information to which we dont have access.
Nevertheless, we notice that the key parameters values
obtained through our model for Algeria fall within the
values ranges estimated for the Chinese city of Wuhan
where SARS-CoV-2 first appeared [20, 22, 28] as shown
in Table 1.
The forecast simulations (Fig.3), based on the
available official data, estimate that the infection
peak time corresponding to the maximum incidence
occurred on April 24th-26th with 387 (95% CI 267509) new infections per day as shown on Fig.3d. The
effective reproduction number continuously decreased
reflecting a better control of the disease spread and
crossed the line Rt = 1 by May 1st (see Fig.3c). At
that crucial point the disease entered the attenuation
phase. The SEIQRDP model evaluates the active
cases peak time for COVID-19 outbreak in Algeria,
corresponding to active cases maximum, to be on the
period between May 20th and May 30th with 9794
(95% CI 8770-1024) active cases (see Fig.3a).
We estimate that the number of new infections will
vanish by mid-September. At that time the number
of active quarantined cases will be still above 500.
Assuming that the epidemic will remain ongoing as
long as all active cases have not been closed yet, the
model predicts the outbreak to end no earlier than
October 2020, with an estimated total quarantined
individuals of 24021 (95% CI 20768-27274), 15291
(95% CI 13272-17310) recovered and 8172 (95% CI
7093-9251) deaths as shown on Fig.3b. Notice that
the predicted total number of deaths appears to
be particularly overestimated compared to official
numbers (blue dashed line).
A solution to this
technical issue is under investigation [38]. This can
partly be explained by the fact that official deaths are
confirmed by PCR tests only while our model deals
with both PCR and CT scan diagnosed individuals.
We emphasize that the numbers we present in this
forecast are only estimations that could be seriously
affected by the behavior of the population and any
eventual measures taken by the authorities during the
period of the epidemic. A brutal release of containment
could result in a reversal of the curves as long as no
vaccine has been developed for large-scale use.
An important piece of information that could be
extracted from the official public data is the Case
Fatality Rate (CFR) corresponding to the ratio of
deaths to effective confirmed cases.
The Infected Fatality Rate (IFR), often confused
with CFR, is the ratio of deaths to infected
cases including asymptomatic cases which are nonmeasurable. For that reason, we calculate CFR based
on official data while the IFR is calculated through
the ratio of the official cumulative deaths to the

Figure 4: Case to Fatality Rate (CFR) and Infection to Fatality
Rate (IFR) for COVID-19 outbreak in Algeria between Feb. 25th
and May 24th. Light red shading represents 95% confidence
intervals of the model estimate.

cumulative number of infected individuals obtained
from the SEIQRDP model (see Fig.4). The mean CFR
on the period Feb. 25th - May 24th is estimated to be
5.3% while the mean value of IFR on the same period is
2.9% (95% CI 1.7%-3.9%). Notice that the mean IFR
for the three first months of the outbreak in Algeria
is higher than the global value estimated to 1.4% by
a recent study using cumulative COVID-19 data from
139 countries [39].
It is worth to know that compartmental models
including the SEIQRDP model work perfectly when
some conditions on the studied population are
assumed. Indeed, the SEIQRDP model requires a
well-mixed and homogeneous population. Well-mixed
population means that all individuals in the population
have the same chance to be infected by an infectious
one. Homogeneity means that all individuals behave
likely toward the disease and thus are governed by
the same rules of transitions probabilities between
different population compartments. Consequently, all
calibrated parameters in this study should be seen
as a statistical average over population. Moreover,
SEIQRDP model is fundamentally not additive i.e
the sum of different SEIQRDP models applied to
different provinces of a given country is not necessarily
equivalent to the SEIQRDP model applied to the
whole country. Because of the previous considerations
altogether, it would be very interesting to apply our
study on different major infected cities of the country
separately.
5. Conclusion
In this paper we have presented an enhanced compartmental SEIQRDP model for epidemics in which
a protection rate has been introduced and noteworthy compartments of quarantined and protected pop-

10
ulation have been added compared to the most widely
used SEIR models. Our approach is based on a genetic
fitting algorithm and makes use of a cross-validation
method to overcome the overfitting problem. We have
designed a generic open-source package containing all
computational tools used in our analysis [33]. This
package includes tools to pick up online data, calculate
the optimum fitting depth using the cross-validation
method, fit the real data with the genetic algorithm to
estimate the SEIQRDP parameters, and produce forecast curves. Moreover, the package includes parallel
computation functionality allowing for the programs to
be deployed on high performance computers for better
accuracy. We have neatly prepared this package in order to be easily utilized to study any epidemic for which
a compartmental analysis is adequate in any regions of
the world.
Based on official cumulative recoveries, cumulative deaths and deduced effective cumulative confirmed cases–including approximated CT-scan diagnosed cases–this model allowed us to estimate epidemic parameters for COVID-19 outbreak in Algeria
(basic reproduction number, protection rate, transmission rate, infectious time, latent time . . . ). We have
estimated intermediate mean values of key epidemic
parameters between Feb. 25th and May 24th. These
intermediate values exposed in Fig.2 permit to evaluate
the epidemic situation in the country and the effect of
the different phases of control measures during the first
three months of the outbreak. We recapitulated in Table 1 the basic reproduction number estimated on Feb.
25th and the calculated mean values of key epidemic
parameters on the whole period Feb. 25th - May 24th
and compared them to recently published results for
COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan. Such parameters estimations might be of high interest for further epidemic
studies of the virus spread in Algeria and the African
continent. Using our SEIQRDP model, we have made a
prediction of the disease effective reproduction number
time evolution (Rt ) which is considered as an essential
indicator of the epidemic situation. Fig.3c exposes the
evolution of Rt since the beginning of the outbreak
and an approximate period on which this parameter
has gone below one. Our simulations suggest the basic reproduction number on Feb. 25th to be R0 =
3.78 (95% CI 3.033-4.53) while the value of Rt on May
24th is estimated to 0.651 (95% CI 0.539-0.761) and
the mean effective reproduction number during the first
three months of the epidemic is evaluated to 1.74 (95%
CI 1.55-1.92). Moreover, we have been able to provide
a valuable approximate estimation of the daily evolution of the non-measurable asymptomatic exposed and
infectious cases in addition to the daily active cases
from the beginning until a very advanced stage of the
COVID-19 outbreak in Algeria (Fig.3a, Fig.3b). We

have estimated the periods in which these numbers will
be at their highest peak and approximated the maximum values they could reach. The model predicts the
outbreak to end not sooner than October 2020, with
an estimated total quarantined individuals of 24021
(95% CI 20768-27274), 15291 (95% CI 13272-17310)
recovered and 8172 (95% CI 7093-9251) deaths. We
have also estimated the time in which the number of
new infections will eventually vanish (Fig.3d). Even
though the SEIQRDP model we presented, as many
of SEIR derivatives, are effective in different contexts,
we are still studying Algerian case carefully because
the reported COVID-19 epidemic evolution in Algeria quickly reached the countrys maximum capacity of
diagnosis which is well reflected in the linear form of
official confirmed cases data. Furthermore, we should
note that, in a basic way, the SEIQRDP model is well
established to simulate a well-mixed closed population
and additionally, it is very sensitive to data accuracy.
In this instance, we stress the fact that our estimations depend strongly on the public available data at
the time this study has been achieved and we emphasize the specificity of our study considering an effective
cumulative confirmed cases number including approximated CT-scan diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infections deduced from the official number of hospital admitted
patients as illustrated in Appendix A. In addition, the
epidemic evolution could be significantly affected by future containment or release measures and then deviates
from the estimated forecast we presented. Furthermore, the scenario in which the epidemic vanishes after
a first peak without a secondary wave is one among
many others and not the most probable.
We are investigating many possibilities to optimize
our model to fit the COVID-19 evolution in Algeria and
elsewhere with more ingenious methods. Additionally,
a completely different epidemic agent-based model is
already in an advanced development stage and will
be used to tackle the virus spread from a different
perspective.
We hope this study can serve as a useful guideline
for Algerian scientists and Algerian government and
efficiently contribute to the fight against COVID-19
pandemic on national and international scale.

Appendix A. Effective confirmed cases

research entities started performing RT-PCR tests [40].

On Fig. A1, we expose the official number of hospital
admitted patients due to COVID-19 in Algeria (blue
dashed line) and the official number of active cases
(yellow dashed line) computed by subtracting the
official numbers for recoveries an deaths from the
official RT-PCR-confirmed cases. Notice that before
April 6th the two curves are perfectly superimposed.
The number of hospital admitted patients start to
significantly increase compared to the official number
of active cases after April 6th. Indeed, since that
time, the CT-scan diagnostic of COVID-19 have been
adopted by Algerian health authorities in addition to
the RT-PCR tests. Hence, we believe the difference
between the two curves represent the number of CTscan confirmed cases (green line). The deduced number
of CT-scan confirmed cases is added to the official RTPCR-confirmed cases to obtain the effective number
of confirmed cases (red dotted line). Notice that the
active cases curve displays a plateau on the beginning
of April which is in our opinion due to the fact that
RT-PCR testing capacitys maximum limit has been
reached. This curve started to increase again on the
second half of April after many hospitals and biology

Figure A1: Effective confirmed cases curve (dotted red)
compared to official RT-PCR confirmed cases curve (dashed
red) between Feb. 25th and May 24th. The number of CTscan confirmed cases (green) for a given date is deduced by
subtracting the number of official active cases (dashed yellow)
from the number of hospital admitted patients (dashed blue) for
that date.
