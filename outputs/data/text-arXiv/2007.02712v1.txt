ABSTRACT:
Background: Predicting an accurate expected number of future COVID-19 cases is essential to
properly evaluate the effectiveness of any treatment or preventive measure. This study aimed to
identify the most appropriate mathematical model to prospectively predict the expected number of
cases without any intervention.
Methods: The total number of cases for the COVID-19 epidemic in 28 countries was analyzed and
fitted to several simple rate models including the logistic, Gompertz, quadratic, simple square, and
simple exponential growth models. The resulting model parameters were used to extrapolate
predictions for more recent data.
Results: While the Gompertz growth models (mean R2 = 0.998) best fitted the current data,
uncertainties in the eventual case limit made future predictions with logistic models prone to errors. Of
the other models, the quadratic rate model (mean R2 = 0.992) fitted the current data best for 25 (89 %)
countries as determined by R2 values. The simple square and quadratic models accurately predicted the
number of future total cases 37 and 36 days in advance respectively, compared to only 15 days for the
simple exponential model. The simple exponential model significantly overpredicted the total number
of future cases while the quadratic and simple square models did not.
Conclusions: These results demonstrated that accurate future predictions of the case load in a given
country can be made significantly in advance without the need for complicated models of population
behavior and generate a reliable assessment of the efficacy of current prescriptive measures against
disease spread.

INTRODUCTION:
On March 11, 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the novel coronavirus
outbreak (SARS-CoV-2 causing COVID-19) as a pandemic1 more than three months after the first
cases of pneumonia were reported in Wuhan, China in December, 20191. From Wuhan the virus
rapidly spread globally, currently leading to ten million confirmed cases and half a million deaths
around the world. Although coronaviruses have a wide range of hosts and cause disease in many
animals, SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh named member of the Coronaviridae known to infect humans2.
An infected individual will start presenting symptoms an average of 5 days after exposure3 but
approximately 42% of infected individuals remain asymptomatic4,5. Furthermore, almost six out of 100
infected patients die globally due to COVID-196.
Currently, treatment and vaccine options for COVID-19 are limited7. There is currently no
effective or approved vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 although a report from April 2020 noted 78 active
vaccine projects, most of them at exploratory or pre-clinical stages8. As the virus is transmitted mainly
from person to person, prevention measures include social distancing, self-isolation, hand washing,
and use of masks. Strict measures of quarantine have been shown as the most effective mitigation
measures, reducing up to 78% of expected cases compared to no intervention9. Nevertheless, to
evaluate the actual effectiveness of any mitigation measure it is necessary to accurately predict the
expected number of cases in the absence of intervention.
While there has been some early concern about the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to spread at an
apparent near exponential rate10, real limitations in available resources (i.e. susceptible population)
will reduce the spread to a logistic growth rate11. Logistic growth produces a sigmoidal curve (Figure
1) where the total number of cases (N) eventually asymptotically approaches the population carrying
capacity (NM), which for viral epidemics is analogous to the fraction of the population that will be
infected before “herd immunity” is achieved12,13. This is represented in derivative form by the
generalized logistic function (Equation 1):

Eqn. 1)

𝜶

where α, β, & γ are mathematical shape parameters that define the shape of the curve, and r is the
general rate term, analogous to the standard epidemiological parameter, R0, the reproductive number,
which is a measure of the infectivity of the virus itself 13,14. For a logistic curve where α = ½ and β = γ
= 0, one gets quadratic growth15 with N = (rt/2)2, while for α = β = γ = 1, this equation can be rearranged to quadratic form (Equation 2)11 and integrated (Equation 3):

where N0 represents the initial number of cases within the population. The shape parameters of logistic
functions magnify the uncertainty in fitting these curves especially during the early part of the
epidemic. These difficulties are further exacerbated by the additional uncertainty in estimation of R0
for SARS-CoV-2, which is directly linked to the current uncertainty in the population carrying
capacity NM. And while the basic logistic function gives rise to a symmetrical sigmoidal curve,
asymmetrical curves such as the Gompertz growth function (Equation 4)16,17:
𝑵

Eqn. 4)

(𝒍𝒏( 𝑵𝑴 )(𝟏−𝒆(−𝒓𝒕) ))

𝑵(𝒕) = 𝑵𝟎 𝒆

𝟎

which emerges11 from Equation 1 for α = γ = 1, where r is replaced by βr and β approaches 0. With
this function the rate of spread slows significantly after passing the mid-point resulting in long-tailed
epidemics (Figure 1).
Traditionally the number of cases that will occur in an epidemic like COVID-19 is modeled
with an SEIR model (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, Recovered/Removed), in which the total
population is divided into four categories: susceptible - those who can be infected, exposed – those
who in the incubation period but not yet able to transmit the virus to others, infectious - those who are
capable of spreading disease to the susceptible population, and recovered/removed – those who have
finished the disease course and are not susceptible to re-infection or have died. For a typical epidemic,
the ability for infectious individuals to spread the disease is proportional to the fraction of the
population in the susceptible category with “herd immunity”12,13 and extinction of the epidemic occurs
4

once a limiting fraction of the population has entered into the Recovered/Removed category13.
However, barriers to transmission, either natural18 or artificial (i.e. quarantines, vaccines)13 can
extinguish the epidemic before the community is fully infected. Artificial barriers such as mandatory
quarantining in China19,20 or aggressive contact tracing in South Korea21 currently seem to have largely
stemmed the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Numerous political, social, and material factors prevent the
implementation of either of these responses in many other countries22, but it should be possible to find
alternative approaches which can be equally effective. For an epidemic as serious as COVID-19, it
behooves medical, scientific, and policy experts to determine as rapidly as possible which community
responses are effective and achievable within different populations. However, gauging the
effectiveness of these responses requires an accurate prediction23 of the number of future cases, and
overestimation of the expected number of cases will make neutral or even harmful responses appear to
be effective when those overestimated cases fail to occur. Thus, accurate prospective predictions (i.e.
before knowing the actual outcome) are preferable to retrospective analysis in which effectiveness is
gauged after the results of the prescriptive actions are known24,25.
This study aimed to evaluate if a simple model was able to correctly prospectively predict the
total number of cases at a future date. We found that fitting the case data to a quadratic (parabolic) rate
curve15 for the early points in the epidemic curves (before the mitigation efforts began to have effects)
was easy, efficient, and made good predictions for the number of cases at future dates despite
significant national variation in the start of the infection, mitigation response, or economic condition.

METHODS: Data on the number of COVID-19 cases was downloaded from the European Centre for
Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) on June 1, 202026. Countries that had reported the highest
numbers of cases in mid-March 2020 (and Russia) were chosen as the focus of our analysis to
minimize statistical error due to small numbers. The total number of cases for each country was
calculated as a simple sum of that day plus all previous days. Days that were missing from the record
were assigned values of zero. The early part of the curve was fit and statistical parameters were
generated using Prism 8 (GraphPad) using the non-linear regression module using the program
standard centered second order polynomial (quadratic), exponential growth, and the Gompertz growth
5

model as defined by Prism 8, and a simple user-defined simple square model (N = At2 + C) where N is
the total number of cases, A and C are the fitting constants, and t is the number of days from the
beginning of the epidemic curve. The beginning of the curve (SI Table 1) was defined empirically
among the first days in which the number of cases began to increase regularly. Typically, this occurred
when the country had reported less than 100 total cases. The early part of the curve was defined by
manual examination looking for changes in the curve shape and later confirmed by R2 values for the
quadratic model. Prospective predictions for the number of cases were done by fitting the total number
of COVID-19 cases for each day starting with day 5 and then extrapolating the number of cases using
the estimated model parameters to predict the number of cases for the final day for which data was
available (June 1, 2020) or to the last day before significant decrease in the R2 value for the quadratic
fit. Fit parameters for the Gompertz growth model were not used to make predictions if the fit itself
was ambiguous. Acceptable predictions were defined as being within a factor of two from the actual
number (i.e. predictions within 50-200% of the actual total).

RESULTS:
A simple exponential growth model is a poor fit for the SARS-COV-2 pandemic:
The total number of cases for each of 28 countries was plotted with time and several model
equations were fit to the early part of the data before mitigating effects from public health policies
began to change the rate of disease spread. In total, 20 (71 %) countries showed mitigation of disease
spread by June 1 (Figure 2). When the early, pre-mitigation portion of the data was examined for all 28
countries, the Gompertz growth model had the best statistical parameters (mean R2 = 0.998 ± 0.0028,
Table 1) although a fit could not be obtained for the data from 2 countries and many of the fit values
for NM were unrealistic compared to national populations (e.g. China and India had predicted NM
values corresponding to 0.014 % and 0.33 % of their populations respectively26 (SI Table 2)). Fitting
was also incomplete for the generalized logistic model for all 28 countries underlining the difficulty in
applying this model. On the other hand, the simple models were able to robustly fit all the current data,
with the quadratic (parabolic) model performing the best (mean R2 = 0.992 ± 0.004) and the
exponential model the worst (mean R2 = 0.957 ± 0.022)(Table 1). In only three (11 %) countries did
6

the exponential model have the best overall R2 value among the simple models. Furthermore, the trend
of the overall superiority of the Gompertz model followed by the quadratic was also observed in the
standard error of the estimate statistic as well. The mean standard error of the estimate (Sy.x,
analogous to the root mean squared error for fits of multiple parameters) value for the 28 countries was
1699 for the Gompertz model, 5613 for the quadratic model, 8572 for the simple square model and
11257 for the exponential model (Table 1). Likewise, plots of the natural log of the total number of
cases in the early parts of the epidemic (lnN) with time are significantly less linear (as determined by
R2) than equivalent plots of the square root of the total number of cases (N1/2) (SI Table 3, SI Figs 1,
2).

Quadratic growth models provide improved fits to the early portion of the epidemic courses:
While logistic growth models have been widely used to model epidemics16,27, uncertainties in
estimates of R0 (and therefore the population carrying capacity NM) make prospective predictions of
the course of the epidemic difficult14,27. (Figure 3, Table 2, SI Table 4). Here we define predictions as
accurate when they are within a factor of two (50-200%) of the actual outcome. For most countries,
the simple exponential model massively overpredicts the number of future cases. Predictions generated
more than 14 days prior were more than double the actual number of cases for 17 (61 %) countries
examined. In fact, for 15 (54 %) countries, the exponential model made at least one overprediction by
a factor of greater than 10,000 fold, while the quadratic and simple square models make no
overprediction by more than a factor of 3.3 and 2.1, respectively (i.e. using the first 10 days of data
from Portugal the exponential model predicts 34 million cases while the quadratic, simple square, and
Gompertz growth models predict 24957, 20358 and 18953 cases respectively while 23683 total cases
were observed while the total population of Portugal in 2018 was 10.3 million26).
Predictions using the quadratic and simple square models were much more accurate. Only in
four (14 %) countries does the quadratic model ever overpredict the final number of cases by more
than a factor of two while the simple square model overpredict by a factor of two for only one (4 %)
country (SI Table 4). For the quadratic model, the mean maximum daily overprediction was a factor of
1.6-fold (median 1.3 fold) while for the simple square model the mean maximum daily overprediction
7

was 1.3-fold (median 1.1 fold). Both of these models produced much more accurate predictions than
the simple exponential model (Table 2).

DISCUSSION:
The start of the global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has resulted in an unprecedented set of national
responses. These responses have varied considerably from a strict lockdown in China10, to aggressive
contact tracing in South Korea28, to mandatory shelter in place restrictions in France29, to giving
citizens information and allowing them more freedom to make choices as in Sweden30, and to other
countries attempting to accelerate their progress towards herd immunity31. The variety in these national
prescriptions is a result of the different socioeconomic situations in individual countries which have to
take into account not only the costs of these efforts both monetarily and in terms of lives, but also what
can be reasonably achieved depending on the relationship between individual governments and their
citizenry. Additionally, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 has been putatively linked to several inherent
factors within a country, such as average population density32, normal social behaviors22, and even
weather may have an effect33. The efficacy of similar prescriptions can vary in pairs of neighboring
countries (i.e. the UK or Ireland). Therefore, it behooves every nation to review the results of its own
policy prescriptions in order to make necessary course adjustments as quickly and accurately as
possible.
While predictions about the future course of an epidemic, especially one as novel as COVID19 are difficult under the best of circumstances, the severity of the pandemic has resulted in an
unprecedented amount of epidemiological data being produced with daily frequency. Because logistic
epidemic models have been in use for more than a century16 it is almost tautological that the rate of the
spread of SARS-CoV-2 cannot be well-modeled by simple exponential growth equations, further
demonstrated by statistical analysis of and the poor predictions made by the exponential model for the
future number of cases as compared to the quadratic (parabolic) model15. However, simple exponential
models do not generate entirely terrible fit statistics (Table 1), and this may account for the conflation
of the course of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic with truly exponential growth. That the exponential
growth constant term, k, is constantly decreasing after day 10 in 10 (68 %) countries (SI Fig. 3) further
8

indicates the overall utility of logistic models, which were explicitly developed to model the a
constantly decreasing rate of growth due to consumption of the available resource (i.e. the susceptible
population pool of the SIR model)16. But, while logistic models are implicitly the correct model, they
are difficult to accurately fit during the early portion of an epidemic due to inherent uncertainties in the
mathematical shape parameters (Equation 1) of the curve itself and the population carrying capacity
for SARS-CoV-2, NM, which still has a significant uncertainty as the virus has only recently moved
into the human population. Herd immunity is defined as 1 – 1/R0, and since current estimates for R0
vary from 1.5 – 6.514. This implies that 33 – 85% of the population will need to have contracted the
disease and developed immunity in order to terminate the epidemic. A discrepancy of this size will
significantly affect predictions based on logistic growth models.
Here we note the utility of the quadratic (parabolic) and simple square models in predicting the
course of the pandemic more than a month in advance. The simple exponential model vastly
overpredicts the number of cases (Fig. 2, Table 2). The Gompertz growth model, while often making
largely correct predictions often generates wildly inaccurate estimates of the population carrying
capacity NM (SI Table 2), and the generalized logistic model simply fails to produce a statistically
reliable result with the currently available data. Overestimation of the future number of cases will
cause problems because the failure of the number of predicted cases to materialize may be erroneously
used as evidence that poorly implemented and ineffective policy prescriptions are reducing the spread
of SARS-CoV-2, which may lead to political pressure for premature cessation of all prescriptive
measures and inevitably an increase in the number of cases and excess, unnecessary morbidities.
Fortunately, the quadratic model produces accurate, prospective predictions of the number of cases
(Fig. 3, Table 2). Use of this model is simple as it is directly implemented in common spreadsheet
programs and can be implemented without much difficulty or technical modeling expertise. In theory,
this model can also be applied to smaller, sub-national populations, although the smaller number of
total cases in these regions will undoubtedly give rise to larger statistical errors.
In no way does the empirical agreement between the quadratic model and empirical data
negate the fact that the growth of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is logistic in nature in all 28 countries
(Table 1, SI Table 2). We expect the suitability of these empirical quadratic fits is related to either the
9

fact that quadratic form of the slope of the generalized logistic function or the limitation of the virus to
a physical radius of infectivity around infectious individuals, or that it is still early in the pandemic as
no country has yet officially logged even 1% of its population as having been infected, or all three. Of
course, the true number of COVID-19 cases is a matter of debate as there is speculation that a
significant fraction of infections are not being identified34. However, because this method is focused
on the rate of case growth over time, the errors that lead to any undercounting within a given country
are likely to remain largely unchanged over the short time periods observed here and still provide a
reasonable estimate of the number of positively identified cases. While despite their similar predictive
power we largely focus on the quadratic model rather than the simple square model for the
aforementioned reasons, we must also note that quadratic curve fitting is natively implemented in most
common spreadsheet software while the simple square model is not. By monitoring the R2 values for
the quadratic models, it is a simple task to identify when the epidemic is beginning to subside within a
country (i.e. “bending the curve”). Here we recommend the use of an R2 value of 0.985 for identifying
when the rate of infection is beginning to subside, but more conservative estimates can also be made
by lowering this threshold.
Examination of the data collected here suggests that early, aggressive measures have been
most effective at reducing disease burden within a country. Countries that initially adopted less
stringent measures (such as the US, UK, Russia, and Brazil) are currently more heavily burdened than
those countries that started with more intense prescriptions (such as China, South Korea, Australia,
Denmark, and Vietnam)35. Vietnam was not analyzed here as it does not currently have a large number
of COVID-19 cases likely due to its early aggressive action against viral spread7,35. The effectiveness
of aggressive measures may also be due to the apparent quadratic rate of growth of total cases with
time (Equation 2); while growth in proportion to the square of the number of days is fast, it is not as
fast as exponential growth. Early reductions in the number of infected individuals and the number of
interactions they have with susceptible individuals clearly pays compounded dividends in future case
reductions as advantage can be taken of this slower spreading rate.
Quadratic modeling of the increases of COVID-19 cases within national boundaries currently
gives a more accurate prospective prediction of the growth in the number of total cases. This allows
10

for near real time adjustments to policy prescriptions and obviates the need to estimate the effect of
human behaviors on these predictions and instead focus on the available empirical data and fine tune
the needed responses and efficiently guide the direction of health care resources. Until an effective
vaccine or cure is available, social distancing, contact tracing, and other aggressive quarantine
measures are the most effective tools to combat the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and it is imperative to
monitor whether these measures are being effectively implemented. Accurate prospective modeling of
the future number of cases within countries will help to minimize the social costs and financial
burdens of these necessary mitigation measures.

Figure 1: Illustrative comparison of exponential, quadratic, generalized logistic and Gompertz growth
curves. The Gompertz growth curve (Equation 4, solid black line) representing the progress of a
theoretical epidemic for a disease with an arbitrarily chosen R0 value of 3.4 (r = 0.045, N0 = 1, NM =
70%, dotted line). The solid grey line is an equivalent logistic curve, note that while the midpoint for
both logistic curves is the same, the Gompertz curve reaches the population carrying capacity more
slowly, resulting in a long tailed epidemic. The initial part of the Gompertz curve (including time
points until 5% of the population has been infected) was fit to the simple exponential (red dashes),
quadratic (blue dashes) and simple square (green dashes) models. It is apparent from these curves how
quickly the exponential curve overestimates the rate of growth for the epidemic as compared to the
quadratic and simple square fit curves and how the quadratic model more closely follows the
Gompertz growth curve, evidenced by the smaller Sy.x value for the quadratic fit in Table 1.

The fit equations for each are as follows:

Simple exponential:

𝑁 = 𝑁0 𝑒 𝑘𝑡

Quadratic:

𝑁 = 𝐴𝑡 2 + 𝐵𝑡 + 𝐶

Simple square:

𝑁 = 𝐴𝑡 2 + 𝐶

where N is the total number of cases, t is the time in days, N0 is the initial seeding population
of the epidemic, NM is the population carrying capacity (the amount of the population that
must be infected to achieve herd immunity), A, B & C are the standard quadratic terms (or for
the simple square model equation). Additionally, the number of days of data used in the
fitting, the R2, sum of squares, and Sy.x statistical values are given. For the Gompertz growth
model, an adequate fit could not be achieved for Brazil or Denmark and this is indicated by
N/A.

data, inclusive.b

Good predictions are defined as the predicted result being within a factor of 2, predictions from 50 –

200% of the actual total number of cases). Thus, the quadratic model was able to predict the total
number of cases in the United states in each of the 45 days before that day, while the exponential
model was only within the defined good range for the 20 days preceding that day. The range of
minimum predictions (under predictions) and maximum predictions (overpredictions) is also given

be clearly seen that k is generally decreasing over time, often on each day but sometimes after an
initial bit of increasing. This indicates that the exponential rate is regularly decreasing, as expected for
a situation where growth resource is decreasing, as is expected for the logistic models family of
models, including the generalized logistic and Gompertz growth models.
