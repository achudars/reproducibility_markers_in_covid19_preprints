ABSTRACT
The capital market plays a vital role in marketing operations for the rapid development
of the aerospace industry. However, due to the uncertainty and complexity of the stock
market and many cyclical factors, the stock prices of listed aerospace companies
fluctuate significantly. This makes the share price prediction challengeable. To improve
the prediction of share price for aerospace industry sector and well understand the
impact of various indicators on stock prices, we provided a hybrid prediction model by
the combination of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Recurrent Neural Networks.
We investigated two types of aerospace industries (manufacturer and operator). The
experimental results show that PCA could improve both accuracy and efficiency of
prediction. Various factors could influence the performance of prediction models, such
as finance data, extracted features, optimisation algorithms, and parameters of the
prediction model. The selection of features may depend on the stability of historical data:
technical features could be the first option when the share price is stable, whereas
fundamental features could be better when the share price has high fluctuation. The
delays of RNN also depend on the stability of historical data for different types of
companies. It would be more accurate through using short-term historical data for
aerospace manufacturers, whereas using long-term historical data for aerospace
operating airlines.
The developed model could be an intelligent agent in an automatic stock prediction
system, with which, the financial industry could make a prompt decision for their
economic strategies and business activities in terms of predicted future share price, thus

improving the return on investment. The study is for the prediction of aerospace
industries at pre-COVID-19 time. Currently, COVID-19 severely influences aerospace
industries. The developed approach can be used to predict the share price of aerospace
industries at post COVID-19 time.

1. Introduction
As part of the transportation industry, the aerospace industry has become an
indispensable part of human life. Aerospace is the most active and influential field of
science and technology in the 21st century. The outstanding achievements in this field
mark the level of development of human civilisation. It also reflects the level of
comprehensive national strength and science and technology of a country.
In the aerospace sector, the most representative industries are aerospace
manufacturers (e.g. Boeing, Airbus) and aerospace operating sector (e.g. Alaska
Airlines, United Airlines). To expand financing, invest in new projects or new businesses,
and increase market competitiveness, many companies choose to be listed on stock
market. This is because that entering the stock market is a straightforward approach to
raising more capital for aerospace companies, expanding international market share,
gaining higher public trust, and creating more transparent and measurable company
values.
The price of stock markets is the critical indicator of economic growth in a country. In
2015, there were more than 60 stock exchanges in the world. At the mid-2017, the total
stock market value size in the world was around $76.3 trillion US dollars. The stock price
prediction is trying to confirm the future values of the stocks or other financial tools traded
in the stock exchanges (Malkiel, 1991). The investors and traders are interested in share
price prediction because accurate prediction may produce high profit through stock
trading. However, the share prices of aerospace companies fluctuate significantly due to
many cyclical and non-cyclical factors. Each factor has a significant impact on profit, but
these elements are not synchronised. Due to the uncertainty and complexity of the stock
market, the prediction of share prices is a critical challenge, and thus the stock trading is
a high-risk financial activity. Therefore, a slight improvement of share price prediction
could bring a substantial return of rate for investors.
Although financial market analysis requires knowledge, intuition, and experience, the
automation process has been growing steadily because of the availability of large finance
data and the development of machine learning technology. There are two conventional
methods for stock price prediction: fundamental analysis and technical analysis.
Fundamental analysis is to concern the stock itself (Harrington, 2003), while technical
analysis is to predict the future trend of the transaction values and volumes by
researching the past market data without concerning any fundamental aspect and
financial condition ratios of the company itself (Kirkpatrick & Dahlquist,
3

2015).

Correspondingly, the two sets of data, used in the two analysis methods, are called
fundamental stock data and technical stock data, respectively. Moreover, various
machine-learning techniques have been widely used in the finance industry.
This research is to improve the accuracy of share price prediction in aerospace industry
using advanced machine learning techniques, to provide decision-makers with
references about their stock price as well as various factors that could affect the stock
price in future for their economic strategies and business activities. We develop a hybrid
approach with two stages of PCA and recurrent neural network for stock price prediction.
Two types of aerospace industries are studied based on their history data. One is a
manufacturing company, denoted as MFG, and the other is an operating company,
denoted as OPR. We select 15 fundamental features and 15 technical features,
respectively. The three groups of experiments will be conducted based on the different
data types: fundamental data, technical data and their combination.
The rest of the paper is organised as follows: Section 2 provides a brief literature review
on the research of computational finance, especially the methods and techniques on
share price analysis and prediction. Section 3 describes the hybrid model for share price
prediction. Section 4 provides the experiments and comprehensive evaluation. Finally,
Section 5 provides conclusions and future work.
2. Existing Work
2.1. Fundamental and Technical Analysis for Stock Price Prediction
Fundamental analysis is the process of looking at a business at the most basic or
fundamental financial level. It examines the key ratios of a business to determine its
financial health. Fundamental analysis can provide an idea of the value of what a
company's stock should be. Hence, fundamental analysis concerns the stock itself, such
as the assets, liabilities, and incomes of the target companies by analysing their financial
statements, as well as the ratios of previous performance, such as Price-to-Earnings
Ratio (P/E ratio) (Harrington, 2003), which is the ratio for valuing a company that measures
its current share price, related to its earnings per-share (EPS). Fundamental analysis is

based on the belief in the business needs for the capital to keep operating. If the
company runs well, it should obtain additional capital awards which will lead to stock
price soared (Fundamental Focus, 2011). Fundamental analysis is conducted from the
global economy firstly and then national economy before analysing a specific industry
and a specific company. It is a top-down process. As the fundamental analysis is a
relatively reasonable and objective method, it is used extensively (Harrington, 2003).
4

Technical analysis is to predict the future stock price and makes the trade decisions of
financial derivatives based on the position and the seasonal change theory of the market
trend. The principles of technical analysis are that the price will reflect all the relevant
information of the market and the history trend will repeat itself (Edwards et al., 2012).
Both analyses can predict stock price to some extent. The main difference between these
two methodologies is that the datasets of fundamental analysis could update very slow.
For example, return on assets (ROA) and return on equity (ROE) are likely to upgrade
every three months, rather than daily as with technical analysis dataset, e.g. stock price
data (Larkin, 2014).
For the fundamental analysis, there are lots of indicators in stock analysis processes. 42
features based on the fundamental analysis were extracted by different analysts for the
prediction of share price. The 5 feature vectors, such as profitability, growth, liquidity,
solvency and operational efficiency, were used for tackling the value stock analysis of IT
stocks in Taiwan. The proﬁtability vector includes ROA, operational gross proﬁt,
operational proﬁt, net proﬁt after tax; the growth vector includes net proﬁt after tax growth
rate, ROA growth rate, total assets growth rate, revenue growth rate, gross proﬁt growth
rate; the liquidity vector includes quick ratio, liquidity ratio, cash ratio; the solvency vector
includes debt ratio, interest coverage ratio; and operational efﬁciency vector includes
asset turnover rate, inventory turnover rate, average days for sales (Shen & Tzeng,
2015a). Besides, the rate of return, the number of transactions, gross profit, gross loss,
the number of profitable transactions, the number of consecutively profitable transactions,
the number of unprofitable consecutive transactions, Sharpe ratio, the average
coefficient of volatility, the average rate of return per transaction, the value of the
evaluation have been used in the decision system on FOREX market (Korczak et al.,
2016). In order to select optimal stocks from the stock market and predict the future price
trends, Chen et al. (2017)

developed an improved fundamental approach with 14

features that were widely used as indicators in the analysis of finance and investment,
such as long-term funds to ﬁxed assets, current ratio, interest guarantee, average
inventory turnover, average collection turnover, fixed assets turnover, total assets
turnover, return on total assets, total stockholders’ equality, operating income to capital,
pre-tax income, net income, earnings per share, and the price-earnings ratio. More
features can be extracted from the daily stock market data. Moving averages and relative
strength index (RSI) have been used in a mobile app to classify stock market (Larkin,
2014). To support investment decision, night days K value (KD), psychology indicator
(PSY), moving average convergence and divergence (MACD), and RSI have been
5

applied in a rough set approach (Shen & Tzeng, 2014; Shen & Tzeng, 2015b). Besides,
to determine the future share price predictability of Hong Kong, South Korea and
Singapore, such features as 20 days simple moving average, 20 days exponential
moving average, moving average crossover, MACD, Kaufman adaptive moving average,
and the most optimised moving average have been used to analyse the increasing
profitability (Phooi M’ng, 2018). For the Morgan Stanley Capital International Emerging
Market, in terms of moving average, relative strength index, and moving average
convergence divergence, the prediction of transaction costs, using technical analysis,
provided evidence against the efficient market hypothesis for emerging market index
(Metghalchi et al., 2019). Technical analysts always consider the influencing factors from
various aspects. With the continuous increase in the number and spread of social web
media, the stock market volatility is affected by information release, dissemination and
public acceptance (Li et al., 2018).
2.2. Machine Learning Techniques for Computational Finance
To take full advantage of the strengths of advanced machine learning techniques to
produce broader impacts, effective practical implementations of predictive systems must
incorporate the use of innovative technologies. Stock prices prediction can be transferred
to two types of problems: (1) decision making or classification problems for price trend
prediction, such as fuzzy rule-based systems (ElAal et al., 2012), neural networks (ElAal
et al., 2012, Lertyingyod & Benjamas, 2017), and random forests with imbalance learning
(Zhang et al., 2018), and (2) time series prediction (TSP) problems for price value
prediction. Various machine learning techniques have been applied for TSP problems
(Jadhav et al., 2015,He & Qin, 2010). Especially, neural networks (e.g. recurrent neural
networks and feed-forward neural networks (Chandra & Chand, 2016; Khare et al., 2017))
have been proven to be very promising for solving TSP problems in the literature.
Classic artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been widely used for predicting stock price
(Khare et al. 2017, Göçken et al. 2019), digital content stocks (Chang, 2011), and the
closing price of PETR4 stocks (Andrade De Oliveira et al., 2011). Various types of neural
networks were developed for the stock price prediction, such as Bat-neural networks
based on the quarterly data for eight-year DAX stocks (Hafezi et al., 2015), nonlinear
autoregressive with exogenous inputs (NARX) neural networks based on the data from
the NASDAQ stock AAPL (Wei & Chaudhary, 2016), Recurrent Neural Networks based
on the data from NASDAQ stock exchange (Chandra & Chand, 2016), and Radial basis
function (RBF) neural network on the average prices of previous 8 months (Liu, 2018),

6

Recently, deep learning techniques have been widely used for stock price prediction, for
example, the deep direct reinforcement learning algorithm (Deng et al., 2017),
Convolutional neural networks (CNN) (Cao & Wang, 2019) and deep Q-learning (Jeong
& Kim, 2019). Support vector machine (SVM) was also widely used in this area. For
example, Long et al. (2019) developed SVM based on different kernels to predict stock
price trend based on based on financial news semantic and structural similarity.
Hybrid models always perform better than single machine learning models, and the
neural networks and SVMs are often an important component in many hybrid models,
for example, the combination of neural network and decision tree for the prediction of
digital game content stocks price (Chang, 2011), the integration of gray algorithm and
RBF neural network, trained by four different learning strategies (Lei, 2018), fuzzy time
series analysis with neural networks for the forecast of the Taiwan Stock Exchange
Capitalization Weighted Stock Index (Yolcu & Alpaslan, 2018), the integration of
piecewise linear representation (PLR) and support vector machine (SVM) (Luo & Chen,
2013), and the combination of CNN and SVM (Cao & Wang, 2019).
Evolutionary optimization with wrapper techniques are often used to optimize machine
learning models or select features for stock price (trend) prediction. For example,
Harmony Search and Genetic Algorithm was used to find the best structure of neural
network (Göçken et al., 2016), neural network with greedy algorithm based on the feature
reduction with wrapper techniques for the prediction of stock price trend (Lertyingyod
and Benjamas, 2017), simulated annealing algorithm was used to optimise feature space
and model parameters (Torun & Tohumolu, 2011), and a Markov decision process was
incorporated on genetic algorithms to develop stock trading strategies (Chang & Lee,
2017).
Many other techniques were used to improve the performance of computational finance.
For example, principal component analysis (PCA), as data pre-processing, was used to
reduce the dimensions of feature space to improve prediction accuracy (Lin et al., 2009),
and it was applied to clean up the original data set and produce a new data structure
(Chen & Hao, 2018), an analytic hierarchy process was used for feature ranking and
selection for a weighted kernel LS-SVM (Marković et al., 2017), and the information gain
oriented feature selection was run before the Genetic Algorithm with SVM in wrapper for
credit scoring (Jadhav et al., 2018).

3. Methodology
3.1. Problem Modelling
This research focuses on the classic TSP problem for stock price prediction. It is to
explore the advanced methods of share price prediction in the aerospace industry by
using some historical finance data. A set of features, 𝑥1, … , 𝑥𝑗 , can be extracted from raw
date to feed into a proposed model to predict the future close price, y.
Due to the uncertainty and dynamics of stock markets, the TSP problem is a strong nonlinear regression problem. The value of the time series at time t + τ is predicted or
forecast based upon the properties of the historical time series t, t – 1, ….., t – n+1 (where
n is the number of time steps within the duration of the time series). The non-linear
regression can be expressed as shown in Equation (1).
𝑦𝑡+𝜏 = 𝑓(𝒙𝑡 , 𝒙𝑡−1 , … … , 𝒙𝑡−𝑛+1 ) + 𝜀𝑡+𝜏 , 𝜏 ≥ 1

(1)

To solve this problem and accurately predict the future share price, two challenges need
to be overcome. The first one is to choose proper features, and the other is to develop
an appropriate model that represents the function f(*), mapping the non-linear
relationship between the historical data and the future stock price to be predicted, and it
should be robust for the uncertainty and complexity of data. There are hundreds of
finance features for share price prediction and each feature has different influence levels
in various industries, even has different influence levels for different companies in the
same industry sector. The parameter τ could be different for different industries, due to
their different data properties.
3.2. Feature Selection and Data Processing
After decades of stock research, more than 100 indicators and ratios have been
developed for fundamental and technical analysis, respectively. In this research, data is
collected from the Bloomberg databases, which is the most popular stock database. 30
features are selected, as they are the most popularly used in existing research. For the
fundamental analysis, 15 features in 6 categories are selected, whereas for the technical
analysis, 15 features in 10 groups are selected. The description and calculation formula
of the 30 features are listed in Tables A1 and A2 in Appendix. The collected raw data will
go through two stages of data processing.
For the fundamental features, data is collected every quarter after the companies
publishing their financial reports. For the technical features, data is collected every

8

trading day, synchronised with the close price. A sample is the data on every trading day.
To compare the impact of two sets of features on technical analysis, the quarterly
fundamental data is transformed to daily data by using the univariate linear processing,
which is decided by the beginning and the ending values of the feature in the quarter,
as shown in Fig. 1, where, assume all the change of a fundamental feature in a quarter
is linear.

When processing the technical data, to keep the integrity of the sample data, the samples
that miss some feature values are deleted. At the same time, the corresponding trading
day samples transferred from the fundamental data are also deleted to maintain the
consistency of the fundamental data and technical data.
3.3. Dimension Reduction with PCA
To overcome the curse of dimensionality, the technique of classic Principal Components
Analysis (PCA) is used. The idea of PCA is to project n-dimensional data onto kdimensional (n>k) hyperplane, thus minimising the projection distance from each sample
point to the hyperplane and maximise the variance. The implementation of PCA mainly
includes five steps (Groth et al., 2013):
(i)

Standardise the data samples by mean normalisation;

(ii) Calculate the covariance matrix of the data;
(iii) Find the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix above;
(iv) The obtained eigenvectors are combined according to the size of the eigenvalues
to form a mapping matrix, and the largest number of the top k rows or the top k
columns of the mapping matrix are extracted as the final mapping matrix;
(v) Mapping the original data with the mapping matrix of step (iv) to achieve the
purpose of data dimensionality reduction.

3.4. Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
3.4.1. The structure of an RNN
In the financial prediction problem, the current share price is highly related to the
historical values of indicators and its historical values. RNN is a type of neural network
that includes internal memory function through the feedback loops. It can store
information while processing new inputs. This kind of memory makes it ideal for the tasks
that need to consider history inputs, e.g. the TSP problem for share price. To predict the
share price several days later, it may need to consider the features and share price a
few days ago. Therefore, a target delayed RNN is proposed. The structure of target
delayed RNN is shown in Fig. 2, where,
𝑥 (𝑡) is a j-dimensional vector input (j features) in the time-step t;
ℎ(𝑡) is the hidden state vector with n hidden layers in the time-step t;
𝑦 (𝑡+𝜏) is the output on the τth day after current time t;
τ is the trading days of delay 1 < τ ≤ t
𝑈𝑡 is the direct weight from the input layer at time t to the hidden layer at time t;
𝑉𝑡 is the weight from the hidden layer at time t to the output layer at time t+τ;
𝑊𝑡−1 is the weight from the output at time t-1+τ to the hidden layer at time t, which
means the historical memory;

Fig. 2. The Structure of Target Delayed RNN
Therefore, the RNN output can be calculated in Eqs. (2) and (3)
ℎ(𝑡) = 𝑓ℎ (𝑈𝑡 𝑥 (𝑡) + 𝑤𝑡−1 ℎ(𝑡−1) );

(2)

𝑦 (𝑡+𝜏) = 𝑓𝑦 (𝑉𝑡 ℎ(𝑡) + 𝑏𝑦 ).

(3)

3.4.2. The Training of the RNN
There are many different algorithms for training an RNN. To obtain good performance of
RNNs, three training algorithms are investigated, such as Levenberg-Marquardt
Algorithm (Ranganathan, 2004), Bayesian Regularisation BP Algorithm (Mahajan et al.,
2015; Burden & Winkler, 2008) and Scaled Conjugate Gradient Algorithm (Zhou & Zhu,
2014; (Møller, 1993).
Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) is the most widely used optimization algorithm. LM, as the
damped least-squares method, is an estimation method for the regression parameter
least squares estimation in the nonlinear regression. This method combines the GaussNewton algorithm and the Gradient Descent algorithm and converts the nonlinear least
squares problem into a series of linear least squares problems, then solves the problem
by iteration. Hence, it outperforms simple gradient descent and other conjugate gradient
methods in a wide variety of problems. The details of LM is provided in (Ranganathan,
2004).
Bayesian Regularisation nets have been proved to be more robust than standard BP
nets (Burden & Winkler, 2008). The idea of the BR Algorithm is to retain all the features
but to avoid the excessive influence of a specific feature by reducing the underlying
population parameter θ, which obeys the Gaussian distribution, to improve the problem
of overfitting. By using the Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) method to estimate the
parameter θ, and then obtain the cost function. Denote the prior distribution before the
training set being trained and calculate the posterior distribution through the Bayesian
formula. It is considered that the value of θ should maximise the MAP so that the cost
function will be minimum. The details of the BR-BP algorithm was provided in (Mahajan
et al., 2015).
The performance of the Scaled Conjugate Gradient (SCG) Algorithm is benchmarked
against that of the standard BP algorithm (Møller, 1993). The basic idea of the SCG is to
combine the conjugate property with the steepest descent method. It constructs
conjugate directions of 𝐧 two-conjugates by using the gradients at the known points. The
minimum value in one direction is obtained by searching and optimising along the
direction. It does not affect the minimum value in the obtained direction when searching
the minimum value in other directions. After finding the minimum values for all 𝒏
directions, the minimum value of the 𝐧-dimensional problem is obtained. The details of
SCG is provided in (Zhou & Zhu, 2014).

3.5. Evaluation Method of Prediction
The mean square error (MSE) on the testing data is used to evaluate the prediction
accuracy of different models. The smaller the value of MSE, the better the accuracy of
the prediction model.

4. Experiments and Evaluation
4.1. Data Processing
The aim of this research is to analyse the share price of the aerospace industry. There
are two kinds of companies in in the aerospace sector: the aerospace manufacturers
and the aerospace operators. Two world’s famous companies, MFG, one of the largest
companies in aerospace manufacturing sector, and OPR, a famous airline holding
company in the world, are analysed in this study.
The financial data of these two companies for the period of 5 years from 1st July 2013 to
29th June 2018, containing 1260 trading days, are collected from the Bloomberg
database. As those samples missing some values in BA are removed, there totally are
1254 MFG samples for the experiments. All 1260 OPR samples are used for the
experiments. In the experiments, 70% of the samples are used to train the model, 15%
of samples are used for validation and 15% of samples are used for testing.
4.2. Experiment Conduction
The experiments are carried out on a laptop with Intel Core i5-7200U@2.50GHz,
RAM4.00GB and Windows 10. 216 experiments of RNN are conducted on the platform
of MatLab with different sets of the features, training algorithms, neurons, delay days
and target companies. A ten folder crossing validation is used for each experiment,
taking 10 times of random training, validation and testing, and calculating the average
performance (arithmetic mean) of the 10 times of tests. Fig. 3 depicts the experimental
parameter setting.

Fig. 3. The Parameters of Conducted Experiments
Before running RNN for prediction, all the datasets are processed with PCA to reduce
the data dimensions. Six studies are implemented in Python on the PyCharm platform
with 15 fundamental features, 15 technical features and 30 mixed features of data for
MFG and OPR. Two and three components are kept in each study for easy visualisation
of PCA results.
The two termination criteria and the learning rate of the developed RNN are set as below:
1) The training ends when it reaches convergence;
2) If it does not converge within 1000 epochs, automatically ends at the 1000th epoch;
3) The learning rate is 0.02; the number of hidden layer is 1.
4.3. Results on MFG
4.3.1. Data Dimensionality Reduction with PCA
Fig. 4 (1) – (3) illustrate the results of PCA on the MFG data. Fig. 4 (1) plots several lines
connected to form the 2D and 3D graphs for fundamental data, while Fig. 4 (2) and (3)
are scatter plots for technical features and mixed features, respectively. This is because
that fundamental data is transferred from quarterly to daily through univariate linear
function, while technical data is the actual daily financial data gathered from the
database. Fig. 4 (3) is similar to Fig. 4 (2) in both 2D and 3D graphs. This indicates that
the fundamental data of MFG has a small influence on the results of PCA, when it is
combined with technical data.

to indicate the cumulative contribution rate of the first few principal components extracted
by the PCA. Table 1 shows the variance explained the ratio for MFG.

4.3.2. Convergence of RNN training
Fig. 5 illustrates the training process of RNN with BR. It can be seen that the MSE falls
to the lowest position sharply at epoch 10, and then the error almost does not change.
The training process continues until epoch 683, with the best performance 4.2123 at
epoch 675. Through observing all the training processes of RNN with BR, it is shown
that BR always converges very quickly, but the adjustment process is slow. Namely, the
MAP in the Bayesian algorithm finds a set of approximate optimal parameters very fast,
and then the fine adjustment of weights is slowly.

4.3.3. The prediction results of RNN on the MFG data
The most accurate prediction of the share price of MFG is produced by the RNN on the
experimental parameters: “BR Algorithm, Mixed Features, 15 Neurons and 5 Delays”
with the average MSE of 3.482006. Fig. 6 shows that the errors are increased from time-

15

step 1000 to 1200. It means that although the RNN obtained by BR has the best
performance, the accuracy is reduced from June 16 2017 to April 4 2018. Namely, the
dynamics of the stock market prices has changed very much in the past year.

4.4. Results on OPR
4.4.1. Data Dimensionality Reduction with PCA
Fig. 7 (1) shows a unique trend for the fundamental data of OPR, which is different to
Fig. 4 (1) for the fundamental data of MFG, and Fig. 7 (2) looks more compact for the
technical data of OPR than Fig. 4 (2) for the technical data of MFG. Furthermore, the
most significant difference is the result of PCA on the mixed data of OPR. As can be
seen in Fig. 7 (3), the data in the 3D graph is divided into two clusters for the mixed data
of OPR, deferring to the 3D graph in Fig. 4 (3) for the mixed data of MFG. This means
both fundamental data and technical data affected the results of PCA for OPR. Namely,
fundamental data could play different roles for the stock price prediction in aerospace
manufacturer and operator.

(3) PCA with Mixed Features of OPR
Fig. 7. 2D and 3D visualisation of PCA components
Table 2 shows that 99.82% of details can be represented with 3 components for OPR.
The percentage for OPR is larger than the percentage of 95.94% for MFG. It should be
noticed that technical data and mixed data can be explained close to 100% in the first
component. This means the data with 3 components after PCA can correctly explain all
the raw data with 15 or 30 features. In addition, the results of PCA on the mixed data are
similar with that on the technical data for both MFG and OPR. This means that the
technical data has more influence on the results of PCA on the mixed data.

4.4.2. The convergence of RNN Training
Fig. 8 is the convergence curve of the best RNN on OPR. The convergence speed of
RNN, trained by the SCG algorithm with the ending epoch at 33 for OPR, is faster than
that for MFG, and the downward trend is relatively flat. This result shows that the SCG
algorithm, combined gradient descent and conjugation, does not need a onedimensional search that costs time.

4.4.3. Results of RNN on the OPR data
For OPR, the best RNN is produced with the experimental parameters: “SCG Algorithm,
Mixed Features, 5 Neurons and 15 Delays” with the average MSE of 1.319737. Fig. 9
shows the model outputs and errors for OPR. The error for OPR is evenly distributed
and smaller than that for MFG, as in the SCG algorithm, every direction has a conjugated
direction and all the directions could be searched.

4.5. Evaluation
The best results of the PCA and RNN for the share price prediction of MFG and OPR
have been shown in the last section. The experimental outcomes will be further assessed
with more dimensions as follows.
4.5.1. Principal Components Analysis
The benefits of PCA lie in the running time reduction, data visualisation and compression
to free up the computer memory space. The most important is the benefit of reducing the
computing complexity, when a large number of features is dealt with for the specific
problem. In this research, although there are only 15 (fundamental, technical) or 30
(mixed) features, the average running time of each test can be from 1 second to
maximum 92 seconds. Hence, PCA is necessary for this model.
Firstly, the running time of RNN depends on its structure. When the number of hidden
neurons and delays of RNN is increased, its running time is increased. The total running
time of data processing, results extraction and analysis of the 2160 tests are around 6
days within only 5-years financial samples. When expanding the feature sets or adding
the financial samples, the running time could be increased sharply.
Besides the improved efficiency, the PCA can keep more than 95.94% details, but the
number of data dimensions is reduced from 15 or 30 to 3. For the technical and mixed
features of both MFG and OPR, more than 99.99% variance is explained with one19

component. This means that data redundancy is reduced, and the significant information
of data is kept.
Additional 20 verification tests for the two test sets are done to examine the effects of
PCA further. The parameters are set the same as the best-performed tests of MFG and
OPR:


For MFG: BR Algorithm, Mixed Features, 15 Neurons and 5 Delays



For OPR: SCG Algorithm, Mixed Features, 5 Neurons and 15 Delays

But, the input data of RNN is the initial data without PCA processing. Tables 3 and 4
show the assessment results for MFG and OPR, respectively. From both tables, the
average MSE with PCA is lower than average MSE without PCA. This means that the
prediction accuracy with PCA is better than without PCA. Moreover, the average running
time with PCA is lower than or similar to that without PCA. The results have proved that
PCA can improve both efficiency and accuracy of the prediction model.

4.5.2. Optimization Algorithms of Weights
BR and LM account for the majority of the top 50 test sets for MFG, while SCG and LM
perform better than BR for OPR. For the MFG data, LM obtains the lowest average MSE
and running time among the three algorithms. Although the best performance is obtained
by BR algorithm, the average MSE obtained by BR is higher than that obtained by LM,
and the average number (773.1) of convergent epochs for BR is the largest among the
three algorithms.

Fig. 11. Average MSE of Different Training Algorithms on the OPR Data
When analysing the different algorithms separately, the BR algorithm is the only one that
does not converge within 1000 epochs when testing. Especially in the tests for OPR, 33
of 36 tests with BR are ended at the 1000 epoch, while this number is 12 of 36 in the test
for MFG. All these tests are carried out, using the RNN models with over 15 hidden
neurons and over 10 delays. This indicates that the threshold value of convergence may
not be suitable for the BR algorithm with many hidden neurons and delays.
To sum up, from the average value of MSE and running time, LM is the best algorithm
for MFG while SCG is the best one for OPR. Even BR performs very well in the single
test for MFG, it costs a lot of running time and has a high average MSE when the
convergence threshold of BR is set to the same threshold as in LM and SCG. Hence,
the convergence threshold should be refined.
4.5.3. Analysis Features
The experiments on the technical analysis features obtain the lowest average MSE for
MFG, regardless of algorithms, and the experiments on the fundamental analysis
features obtain the best for OPR, as shown in Fig. 12 and Fig. 13.

Fig. 13. Average MSE on The Three Sets of Features for OPR
For the MFG Company, as the dynamics of information is approximated as a linear
variation, fundamental data misses details of daily information, so the accuracy of the
prediction is not as good as the technical data, which represents daily information.
Besides, even though fundamental data occupies a small percentage of the influence on
mixed data, these filled fundamental features may conflict with the technical features,
thus producing negative impact on the prediction of stock price. Hence, the prediction
accuracy of the model on mixed features is reduced.

23

However, for the OPR Company, the stability of historical share price is poor, as shown
in Fig. 9. That will cause a high fluctuation of the prediction accuracy if the technical data
is used. The prediction accuracy can be improved and the high fluctuation could be
mitigated by using mixtures of fundamental and technical features. This indicates the
quarterly data has the positive impact on the prediction accuracy when the stock market
is strongly dynamic. This might be because that the linear approximation of daily
information from quarterly data could compromise with the dynamics of technical daily
data.
Briefly, technical features can be selected when the share price is stable, while
fundamental features are better when the share price has a high fluctuation.
4.5.4. The Number of Neurons
Many parameters can be adjusted for improving the prediction accuracy of a neural
network. Appropriately adjusting the parameters plays a vital role in share price
prediction. The method of trial and error is used to find the most suitable parameter
values of RNN on different feature sets for different companies.
Fig. 14 shows the relationship between the number of neurons and the average MSE on
the test data for MFG. The value of the average MSE increases for testing data as the
number of neurons increases. The best-performed number of neurons is 5. This might
be because that the more the neuron numbers, the stronger of the neural network’s
learnability, which might increases the risk of over-fitting with the training data.

Fig. 14. Average MSE for Different Numbers of Neurons in RNN for MFG
As to the OPR, the MSE continues decreasing when the number hidden neurons is
changed from 5 to 20. With the increasing number of neurons, the learnability of the RNN
is improved, but the complexity of the network is increased. It can be seen that the MSE
value has a tiny change when the number of hidden neurons is changed from 15 to 20.
Therefore, the best-performed RNN is with 15 hidden neurons for OPR.

Fig. 15. Average MSE of Different Number of Neurons of OPR
Briefly, it is vital for improving prediction accuracy to set the number of hidden neurons
appropriately. The experimental results indicate that there exists an optimal number of
25

hidden neurons for RNN, and the number of hidden neurons depends on the nonlinearity
of the training data. When the linearity of the training data is strong, the number of hidden
neurons could be small, and when the nonlinearity of the training data is strong, the
number of neurons could be large. When the number of hidden neurons is not enough,
the trained model cannot well represent the mapping function between the data and the
predicted value, the prediction accuracy will be not good enough. When the number of
neuron is larger than the best number, the prediction accuracy on the test data set could
be dropped, as the trained model might over-fit with the noise in the training data.
4.5.5. The Number of Delays
The delays is another important parameter of RNN to be adjusted for improving the
performance of RNN. It also determines the time looking back of the history data for the
prediction of share prices. As to the financial analysis, the most commonly used
indicators are 5-days moving average, 10-days moving average and 15-days moving
average. Correspondingly, the delays are set to 5, 10 and 15 delays. From Table 11 and
Fig. 16, it can be seen that the MSE of RNN outputs for MFG is increasing as the number
of delays of RNN is increasing.

However, the prediction accuracy of RNN for OPR has the opposite trend, compared to
the case of MFG. The MSE is decreasing, as the number of delays is increasing for OPR
(Fig. 17). Similar with the case of MFG, the running time of RNN is increasing, due to the
increasing complexity of RNN (Table 12).

Fig. 17. The Average MSE of Prediction for Different Delays of RNN for OPR
Compared Fig. 16 with Fig. 17, for MFG, the short-term historical data could have
positive impacts on its share price because the historical data is stable and do not need
to consider long-term historical data by data processing of fundamental data. In contrast,
for OPR, the long-term historical data could have positive impacts on its share price, as
the long-term historical data could compensate for the high fluctuation of short-term
historical data of OPR.
In brief, the relationship between MSE and the number of delays varied with the stability
of the historical data of different companies. Hence, the delays should be adjusted to the
optimal value for different companies.
5. Conclusions
The research developed a hybrid approach to predicting share price of aerospace
industry companies by using the combination of PCA and RNNs, trained with LM, BR,
and SCG algorithms, respectively. The proposed approach could help create automatic
27

prediction of share prices for different industries, not only aerospace industry sectors,
but also other industry sectors.
The share prices for two types of aerospace industries, manufacturing and operating
companies, are investigated, and a comprehensive assessment is provided. Various
factors, e.g. training algorithms, structure of RNN, and features, could affect the
prediction performance. The experimental results show that PCA could improve the
performance of prediction not only in efficiency, but also in prediction accuracy. For MFG,
the best prediction accuracy was obtained by the RNN with 15 hidden neurons and 5
delays on the mixed features, optimised by the BR Algorithm, whereas, for OPR, the best
prediction accuracy was obtained by the RNN with 5 hidden neurons and 15 Delays on
the mixed features, optimised by the SCG algorithm. Regarding the robustness, LM
obtained the best average MSE and shortest running time for MFG.
More importantly, the experimental results show that feature selection is related to the
stability of share market. Technical features could be selected when the share price is
stable, whereas fundamental features are better when the share market has a high
fluctuation. The delays of RNN are different for different types of companies. It would be
more accurate through using short-term historical data for MFG, whereas using longterm historical data for the OPR Airline.
The developed approach to predicting stock prices could provide decision-makers with
a reference or evidence for their economic strategies and business activities, thus
helping the financial industry to increase the return on investment. Although the research
was done based on the data in aerospace industry at pre-COVID-19 time, the developed
approach can be used for the share price analysis of aerospace industry at post COVID19 time.
The combination of fundamental and technical analysis in this research fills the gap in
the studies of stock prices that used to use only fundamental or technical analysis
individually. However, simply combination of technical and fundamental data may not be
good enough for the prediction of stock price for aerospace industries. Hence, feature
selection with optimisation algorithms will be future work. Currently, COVID-19 is
severely influencing aerospace industry, so, we will investigate the prediction of
aerospace share price at post-COVID-19 time.
